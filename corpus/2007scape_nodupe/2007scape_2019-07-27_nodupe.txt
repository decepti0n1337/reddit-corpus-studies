To be slightly fair, RuneLite says the alch value is 150m. It then seems more probably that it can alch for 150m than some random guy claiming that it can't be alched. This post 100% settles the dispute, but it's not hard to see where the doubters are coming from.
---
They really have a Hentai booth at an anime convention lol how far we’ve come
---
so people can get their alts hacked too?
---
No the other nazis
---
If you have the stats for elite then you should go for it. You'll eventually need it late game
---
But it didn’t work then why would it work now?
---
is the old one coming back or will they be coming out with something new?
---
I get downvoted for not agreeing with others. I'm used to that. I voted for him anyways. I just saw Zuhaar and didnt like his artwork and appreciated him more than his stuff.
---
Yes, there's a few things that have made its way to RS3 from osrs. A lot more the other way though. Like, way more. 
---

---
Almost the entirety of prif is rehashed RS3 content, apart from the layout of the city, and the skilling boss? Maybe 1 more thing. Other than that, all content in osrs prif was already released with RS3 prif in like 2014.
---
What's even dumber about that is she's all hesitant about if they need to kill iorwerth later (idk if i spelled that right)
---
From a role-playing perspective, I support losing status for any *true player death*. If you lose a contest and are teleported, are bested and knocked out, or otherwise experience a situation where you appear to have lost all of your hp, but didn't *die*, you shouldn't lose status.
---
Eeww, looks like a low-polly rs3 head now the chatheads in osrs are gonna be inconsistent, WHY WAS THIS DONE???
---
Me too, buddy.
---
Ah yes, the good old days. Let's also bring back dueling anywhere! At least that one was fun.
---
In case you're not joking, you are looking at a rsclassic sprite next to the usual rs2 one we still have.
---
I specifically remember using them as safespots
---
were any parts overly hard?
---
Sorry for the quality, thanks though.
---
i have a pin. but authenticators are easily disabled and bypassed. so I'm good
---
They better release the poll before all my bonded alts lose membership. Gonna vote to keep it the same just to troll haters. Also how do I buy a reddit promoted post?
---
Swampletics said video coming soon and wildernaut said a spicy one coming up too, hopefully gonna be a lit weekend
---
In all honesty I can see this as an experiment to see if a new design can become popular, and if people liked it then maybe use this design from now on, but clearly nobody wants this so hopefully it will revert.
---
KungPowPenis was already taken so I have to let people know while my username is Kunpowpenis my actual name is Kung Pow Penis
---
Loved the look of the library. 
---
Soundtrack reminds me of that spirit tower level from Rayman 3, good times.
---
Still, would've never attempted the puzzle without a guide and feel like it was made unnecessarily long just cause'. Gaps that force you to spend time just running around to the other side and the teleporters being far away felt a bit forced. Book swirls looked nice but were there just to be an inconvenience. Those 3 things didn't add any difficulty to the puzzle itself and only made it longer for no reason.
---
Loved the rest of the quest though, props to the OSRS team!
---
You can get them back for free from some elf in lletya flax fields according to comments on this post
---
I guessing your Poh fairy ring is closest
---
Lol rune dragons are 2m an hour and that’s not even with an avernic
---
Its just nostalgia making us think its great. Haha. I did enjoy the art styles though. D med looked insanely cool
---
I did both quests on release day, and I only do quests without guides. The fights in ds2 were tougher, but with that light puzzle in sote I'm gonna say that was the more difficult quest. With guides I'm sure ds2 would be the more difficult quest.
---
Leaking your real world location can lead to your account being recovered. It's best to keep that shit private.
---
It’s not really any time dedicated because you can just level your alt while you play your main.

Nothing that says you can't in the release post, so I would be quick to say yes.
---
Zezimas password is "Zezima" 
---
come on zezima u can do better than that!!! WTF
---
The old one, well it’s been coming back after they change it for an event for the last 5/6 years I’ve been playing atleast
---
It's a good day when you really don't know if you're on r/2007scape or r/Animemes
---
It's how badly the ice coolers are coded. The same problem happens with other low level slayer creatures made in 2005. When you get the slayer exp drop, it interupts you when you click another lizard. The exp drop happens like 3ticks afterword the lizard dies, which happens to be a really common time that a person clicks on a new lizard to kill. 
---
The end result is that if you want to efficiently kill desert lizards, cave crawlers etc, you have to spam click each new lizard you want to attack.
---
Oh shit I hadn't thought of that, that's WAY better than recharging a crystal every 3 times, thanks!
---
Lol. Try again
---
This is a leopard gecko.
---
So is it a boss version of demonic gorillas?
---
quack.................quack....... Quack....Quack....Quack!...Quack!...QUACK..QUACK!..QUACK!..QUACK!QUACK!QUACK!QUACKQUACKQUACKQUACKQUACKQUACKQUACKQUACK!
---
My first thought was that it looked like a leopard gecko
---
lol go try urself its not a drill this is for real
---
Yes pleazd
---
I need that autoclicker for my chicken game.
---
Yup. A few elf slayer tasks and you'll end up with tons of them.
---
Yeah i'm just as confused as you are when it comes to where they got these rates from. 
---
I tried an hour of pick-pocketing at 99 with full rogues and only got 2 shards. Did an hour of killing guards and same thing only 2 shards.  Everyone I talked to at the zalcano says they were barely hitting a shard rate of 40 p/h. 
---
If anything shards need a buff considering how reliant most the new content is on a steady stream of them.
---
Right?  The first video on his channel is 2014, and his first OSRS video is from 2015
---
I just don’t know what a ‘nazi’ is? Like Ashkenazi? I thought they won?
---
All human chatheads have looked like that since HD came out in 08 tho
---
Any news on all the elves being reverted?
---
Damn dude, this hits me. Thank you for making this.
---
You don't fit the style of the game!
---
old plox
---
on one hand gratz on 5 ranger boots...on the other hand fuck you for 5 ranger boots... 🤣
---
I did not notice this. I guess that works, just feels weird having a minigame without a minigame teleport. Thanks for the info tho, will help a lot!
---
For like 10 attempts i thought I was praying wrong.

and?

What are we still doing in his pockets? Just to suffer

Yup. It was 15 years ago, I was 9

what he said
---
It's an attitude you have in life: I demand perfectionism of anything I create and everything I do. I am not ever satisfied if something I created is not perfect to the very best I can *think* it to be.
---
And actually before you shout: this attitude my friends say is really positive -- my friends and coworkers see this as a positive trait.
---
spring 2020 isnt it
---
I wouldn’t stop doing those with your luck
---
Theres only like 2k max mains. Even if they all had 3 alts that's only 6k votes out of the 120k+ votes there were.

I'm past the days where I would live at the duel arena. What a ride that was.

This was my first time staking in a year, I just chucked 20m for funsies

20m : D

Nice!

There is great potential for this, unlocking skill bosses and such. They should repoll it with some new twists

Have you even seen this meme used before?   This is awful.
---
I wasn't a member back then, mom wouldn't let me :(
---
So you're good now? No itch to go back again? No looming thought of 'if i just did one more stake i could get back what i lost'?
---
rune platelegs?
---
they do it well sometimes when adding new methods and QoL but other times they really mess up. and often it seems more like just replacing old content on purpose, which is the dumbest.
---
Even if it never got added as a skill..
---
They could make an "Artisans Guild" which would essentially be the guild for the production skills that haven't got one yet (herblore, construction, fletching, smithing etc).
---
In there you could just add dudes/dudettes that give out contracts that either give extra xp or supplies for tasks (mixture of both maybe).
---
I'd prefer it as a skill, but if I couldn't have that. I'd take it in the game in some other form.
---
DS2 was more just learning patterns, then again I did invest into a DHL to do Vork post quest

I'm sure you got motivated to do more because of that lol

Or make the Boss rabbit a pet
---
I really like how they changed the elves (compared to what they did to them around eoc), but i guess it should have been polled since thats how this game works. Either way i dont understand why people were so quiet like 2 months ago when most of the models were showcased on a bts stream.

I what I'm really asking is if I can farm vorky without the elite void

If I recall the gargoyles boss when it sends you flying backwards makes you say oof. Could be wrong but maybe it glitched below the floor and made you say it?

Oh hell no. I did the agility course for almost 2 hours and barely got 15 shards. I did Zalcano for an hour and I had around 40.

Jamflex ringing the game, just trying to make this easyscape. Ash has abandoned us.

What about adding an ornament kit from some of these places (CoX, ToB, Gauntlet, etc.) after the achievement for ammys, armor, weps, etc instead of capes?

Different types of content creators for different types of people. 
---
A quest cape is one of the first accomplishments most main accounts get. So most people can imagine themselves doing what J1mmy does in his videos. It can be easier to relate his experiences to yours for this reason.
---
Where as Swampletic's is an insane human being that puts in more time than probably nearly any RS youtuber. He could have MAXXED an account from scratch in the time hes spent spent doing just a few of the grinds for his series. Some people like that dedication, it gives them hope that if someone can get 85 slayer through temple trekks then they should be able to get 85 slayer through regular game play.
---
The very same
---
Does this happen during a quest?
---
I'm just looking for a quick, easy to find dialogue I can get into so I can take a screen snip.
---
It’s still not “drama” though. Alt voting is a shit argument when it lost by 9% anyways and it definitely isn’t drama which is all I’m trying to point out. I’m really not trying to start an argument, especially when it already failed so who gives a fuck. I’m so tired of stupid, meaningless arguments about a skill that already failed the poll.
---
sub 10k subs 5-6 years ago was really good because you got to know people on the subreddit personally and actual game discussion went own. It's been downhill since then, with lower and lower effort memes being continuously posted and 2 week old accounts saying that they know what's best for the game while they were complaining that prayer is too expensive to train as they're buying their dragon bones.
---
Level 9 rc but only because of questing.

Oh I'm a fashionscaper, don't worry. But going to the skilling areas, you'll see very few people also fashionscaping. Just sad
---
That's the Phoenix King to you, pleb.
---
How do you give it to your main? Just trade it? Isn't that against the rules and flag you for RWT?
---
&gt; it was not deliberate
---
Are you saying that they accidentally created a 3d model?
---
It used all across Asia for different purposes and religions. It really is an ancient symbol.
---
I ended up going for lilsmokey, even though what Rendi did was way, way, way more impressive.
---
At the end of the day it's a contest of videos, not achievements. As a *video*, Lilsmokey's is just on another level to almost all current OSRS content creators.
---
I genuinely feel like Rendi deserves something for his achievement though, it really is incredible.
---
They have a chance to, yeah

ye i agree but its got arguably one of the worst if not worst sections in a quest in any game in the history of bad sections in quests in video games

You're not doing the game any good

Imagine how getting the levels up in the 90 bracket feel SadFace
---
Will female characters have ‘scissor’ ?
---
The quest was good but they really could have toned down the puzzle imo. It was far too long, and artificially so too. The way you could be 2 seconds walk away from a pillar, but because some books were in the way you have to spend 2 minutes running around to get to it. Without staminas it probably becomes a 3 hour puzzle. Even with staminas I got sick of it very quick.
---
Other than that though, I very much enjoyed the quest. Especially the final battle.
---
Im floored people thought i was serious tbh

Thats some shit lmao

I got 76 agility for graceful then zul-andra shortcut. All these quests people have been complaining about have been so easy for me.
---
You will 100% need to look into a toxic trident...
---
Its not even expensive to use for 1 single fight.
---
Nice cape
---
Idk why it needs a poll
---
I never said that models were accidental. They would have pushed them even further but technology wasnt there yet, and they lacked budget. Nobody can seariously say with straight face that for eg. triangle boobs were intentional and wanted.
---
They changed completely unrelated content such as zulrah npcs
---
Uh, bank pin?
---
Not sure if r/vxjunkies or actually coding speak
---
&gt;dumb as a **child**
---
I think it was a joke lol

But this is RS2, not RSC

you're the hero i didn't deserve

What video would even be the best video lol?  They're all basic commentary with no editing talking about a boring grind.  I respect his content but his videos are not even comparable to Rendi or Settled's

Upvote because wholesome 👍

Yo, you may have a gambling addiction.

Jokes on you, that was the intent.

  ( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)
---
Contentwise RS3 priff is too good.. All the content for 80+ skills is over there. It basically seperated the community, lower levels would hang around in ge/edgeville/burthorpe/wherever and higher levels would all be in priff. deffo because there was access to a GE in priff centre.
---
Actually this change makes it more like old runescape because originally there was no running in runescape and that's how this bug came to be in the first place.
---
the shortcut is garbage lol just use teleports. zulrah very frequently drops 4x teleport scrolls as well.
---
With the amount you've been posting it about it you'd think this is eoc v2. 
---
I generally don't understand how your life has that little going on that you can dedicate this much brain power focused on some **minor** none gameplay impacting change.
---
Like fuck I was devastated when they were planning to completely remove 4taa from rs3 and that would have effected literally all gameplay. I didn't post about it even a quarter as much as you're down about some chat heads
---
Look at the milkers on that bitch
---
Needed to justify their jobs
---
Other places with this mechanic that people may want to check are the monkey madness cave to zooknock and the wall beasts in the Lumbridge swamp dungeon.
---
Yup
---
Yeah just went from 1-83 construction in the last 2 days. I found that Oak dungeon doors can be done very easily, without even having to move the mouse. Just youtube “oak dungeon door guide osrs” if you dont know about it already. The coinbag that pays your servant and the call bell help a ton.
---
If we get the original, then poll a revert for the elf graphical overhaul.
---
Is it worth it over mahogany tables?
---
It's so easy tho
---
Imagine getting 600k agility xp an hour
---
I opened 20 earlier. Its waste.
---
Yea the first episode of swampletics was by no means the best. If the nomination was for a discovery episode maybe
---
Everytime a new quest with a bossfight comes out or a new boss the answer is always blowpipe+rigour
---
How about $11 for the full ash outfit?
---
Hmm i liked MM2 alot more than DS2, The Kurk's dungeon and the platform puzzles felt very hardcore and unforgiving, and i loved that. 
---
Boss-wise though DS2 takes the cake.
---
Lmao I'm fast as fuck BOIII
---
Wat
---
Yes, authenticator app.
---
I enjoyed the high intensity clicking. Just couldn't more than a few hours per sesh.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
i like runecrafting. it kinda takes a certain mindset to settle for the lower than usual xp rates but if you are capable of that its a nice skill.
---
enjoyed my 99 on it. and the 400M+ cash stack was also enjoyable.
---
maybe you failed an agility shortcut?
---
There's  a lot you can do to prevent or prolong your own death like wearing tankier gear, exiting up the ladder, running on one of the cannon hills and waiting for the mobs to deaggro, or just logging out. I would understand completely if they made it dangerous, but since your teammates can kind of screw you over, I understand why it's safe
---
What this guy said.
---
Why not just keep the old chat head
---
That's a dagger ....saeldor is a sword
---
Try using Runelite GPU
---
It’s upsetting because priff on RS3 was amazing but on OSRS it’s hot garbage
---
The bosses mechanics aren't complicated. Its very clear that they're heavily rng based and no matter how good you are, the rolling dice could just end your run.
---
try to bring a full inv of anglers and sara brews, eat above 99hp just after her healing phase (which is when she does her nuts mode attack) and remember to use mage. shit is easy af with a trident.
---
Tbf the classic servers were only shutdown a year ago....
---
So I can't get my weapons back until I do the quest?
---
change the chathead
---
Yikes
---
These guys don’t see a lot of daylight, give em a break lmao
---
Should have said ‘sit’.
---
Well looks like I’m gonna grind some more meds now.
---
What’s yo chair smell like
---
third option looks great!
---
Yeah the mining guild boost is invisible, so stews are your best option from lvl 80
---
What are the recommended stats for corrupted? 90+ In at least 2 combat skills 95+ agility?(this includes required levels for completing song of the elves) The Minigame is difficult to say the least.
---
Why the fuck are they changing this without a poll? If this was prayer flicking we'd have a fucking riot.
---
Seems like they're just rng based which is pretty silly.
---
I think the elven scouts around the forest might have replaced them.
---
More tedious, sure. Harder? Lolno
---
Will be interesting to see if anything good is announced at RuneFest this year. Just another quest? Menaphos? Or a raid?
---
Reminds me of this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ar24jg/when_youre_just_trying_to_use_the_gnome_bank_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
The effects reset completely if you use a brew..
---
When you purchase multiple items on the GE and complete the order, it shows you the price it was purchased at the end. That doesn't always mean the price you attempted to buy it at, if the item was purchased for lower. (i.e. I put on a buy order for a bucket at 20 gold and it completes the order at 8 gold).
---
**Does the ending order purchase price average itself over large orders?**
---
I purchase willow seeds 2200 a time, but that takes 2 days to purchase with the buy limit of 200. The price fluctuates during that time by 10-50gp a seed.
---
When I complete the order, is it averaging the price I purchased the seeds at?
---
rng you say? Smells like mix in here
---
I mean, they did term it "proposed" from the getgo; they knew this outcome was possible.
---
Except thats not how they work
---
I really enjoyed MM2, DS2 and now SotE quality quests.
---
Doing what?
---
137k/hr if you don’t burn any potatos
---
It really is like that, I have a much easier time looking for hookups on grindr than on tinder

Mod bruno should have been thurgo imo, but still funny af

Use a stew at 80 or d pic spec at 82
---
The trap mechanic has been in the game since I was a kid, I did UP and other quests with traps in the mid 2000s and it was there, kinda weird to change a mechanic that was basically an established and accepted fact of the game, but I guess they knew people would be taking a more in depth look at that area and wanted to make sure it "worked."
---
Alot kid, it'll take you straight to the top.
---
because any stat reductions trump the boost and arent replaced. Also divine pots have a shorter boost time than normal pots
---
No it’s double clicking on ur prayer infinitely to a metronome, which is also 0 skill. Saying it’s hard to prayer flick is like saying it’s hard to tick manipulate for fishing or mining
---
Make an ironman :) Really keeps the variety in the game.
---
Getting hit a whole food's worth of hp even when you pray perfectly isn't difficult as much as it is dumb.
---
Yeah fuck context right?
---
He is saying we shouldn't need a poll to fix something that was changed WITHOUT A POLL.
---
They can't change something then poll if we want it changed back lol. Thats just a way to get around the 75% thing, it shouldn't take 75% to change back, it should take 75% to change. ( though this poll seems to be a bit different )
---
Imagine
---
If you pray flick rigour/Piety, the mage wep is worse, though it’s still very strong. The t2 weapon hits 25+ and the t3 version smacks 35s. It still probably lower dps than the hally or bow though once you account for prayers.
---
it was a while ago tbh, it's in one of my earlier videos

best part of this post is seeing ppl "wow rs3 is so shit that needs to make that shit meme" and then ppl answering "but...this meme was made here........"
---
Jesus thank you, I needed this explained. I’ve been getting meleed too often
---
I dunno it looks pretty fun to me
---
Assuming they are dreads
---
I think Artisan is our best bet at this point. 
---
While I liked dungeoneering, i believe Ash has stated in QandA's that dungeoneering would take at least 8 months to produce, assuming they didn't work on any other content. So with that in mind I don't think the devs or the community would be willing to commit to that.
---
 From the way I've heard people suggest Sailing, I would assume it would take a similar amount of work, but that's pure speculation from me obviously. I'm personally not that interested in sailing myself but in the case that it doesn't require a huge amount of dev time, I wouldn't vote no.
---
Summoning had been passed around in the community but I don't think it has any chance of passing. At the very least, we can forget about the combat summons as those are probably the most controversial. I don't think beasts of burden would be accepted either considering how powerful they can be, but maybe a much less powerful one could be negotiated. Osrs also already has a pet system that the community is quite fond of so I don't think Jagex or the playerbase would be interested in changing that or complicating it with an additional system. Assuming these things are cut from the skill, there wouldn't be much left.
---
As far as Warding goes I think it was a good idea for a skill, but obviously the community had some issues with it. I think the main reason it failed was that the community is too split on what they want in a new skill, and artisan didn't cover enough people to pass a 75% poll. Some people want a skill that feels like it belongs in Oldschool while others want a skill that's more interactive and minigame-ish. Some don't want a new skill and instead want reworks of existing skills or additions to them. Others voted against because they only wanted one of the skill I've previously mentioned and some don't want any change at all. Artisan was an oldschool skill, so it's main training method isn;t very exciting, just like the other artisan skills, but instead it improves the game around it by bringing in new "rewards" and improving existing skills(I believe hunter, magic, and runecrafting were the most effectedby warding). It also brings in new additions to the economy and in a case specific to Warding, dissolving. It wasn't a bad skill overall, it still needed the polishing it was promised after a passing vote, but nonetheless it couldn't unite enough portions of the community for 75%.
---
This is the reason I think Artisan has some potential. Artisan provides a new skill, that also improves on existing skills, bridging the gap between some of the voters. Artisan setup would most likely be very similar to slayer, not just in how it's trained, but what you unlock, artisan specific skilling methods. These would be similar to what slayer monsters are to slayer, you unlock them through level up and can be assigned on task, but a task is not necessary to perform them. Some wouldn't be incredibly useful, especially in the lower levels, similar to how most low level slayer monsters aren't killed off task, even by people of the appropriate level. Instead, once again similar to slayer, methods in the higher levels would be more profitable. Overall this adds a new skill, adds new content to existing skills, while also increasing their potential gp/hr.
---
Theres definitely an annoyingly high amount of rng, on top of the time limit, which just makes things frustrating.
---
Like i realize what game im playing and everything, but there are limits and lines for good design that don't just frustrate the player. 
---
On top of that the rewards are bad, which i think everyone knew was going to be the case before the update hit. Doesn't help anything though.
---
[Here's a run I did of corrupt mode](https://imgur.com/Z6HRLVW), which I had almost no mistakes on the boss, as you can see I have like a third of my food left.

I want to upvote but this hurts to read, nice luck anyway damn
---
Dolla dolla bills yall
---
Hey man hang in there!
---
Totally agree. They poll small item graphical changes all the time but can't poll this?
---
A lot of people downvoting because they think this is minor but it isn't. The art design of the game is pretty important. RS3 looks very cartoony/WoW by comparison and OSRS shouldn't be going that route.

how can somebody keep playing WoW,  I don't get it. there's 3 types of quests, and it's really not that interesting trying to get BIS gear for raiding because it's locked behind rng not tasks/games/enemies/challenges.

This would be ideal. You might be able to find a relatively empty world, but its only a matter of time before the new wave of SOTE-finishers come in to check out the new Priff stuff.
---
(I'm not blaming them - they have no idea that they're "crashing" that world, they're just curious and want to try the new boss.)
---
For those that dont know, this is on the docks west of prif. So many Easter eggs in the update and I love them all
---
I'm not talking about the newish new players, I'm talking about people who have started playing when Mobile came out and continued, they'd be at that stage already.

I try to imagine that, but for corp, that has 2k Hp. How much xp would that be?

I like how everyone destroyed this guy because he didn’t/can’t read the update all the way and now he hasn’t replied back to anyone. Rip

I just can't bring myself to do it, so fucking garbage loot lmao

10 kc but can't see myself going back unless buffed
---
Doesn't really seem like it's worth the effort imo
---
Final boss is really easy, just safe up to max HP and you'll be okay. It's like 3-4 hrs.
---
Wait you’re trying to loot? Go play the game mate there is way better money than looting out there
---
Haha wtf is this.
---
Having t2 monsters drop t3 weapon ingredients at 100% rate is the giving away for free I was mentioning, as they are quite easy to find.
---
Just completed this quest the other day, first time doing it. Thank god im done with that forever
---
It would be cool if it had RPG mechanics like Dungeoneering with the Daemonheim Ring how you could pick a different class and level it up for unique power ups was super fun. Also how you could lock items like hexhunter bow and blood necklace was super fun as you increased your level. Mechanics like that would make The Gauntlet super addicting.
---

I don't consider most skilling a chore. Total level currently at 1702, I'd say the game is for me. I'm allowed to have opinions other people don't like.
---
How do i choose the difficulty of my tasks? 
---
and how can i see what task im on? 
---
sorry new to slayer
---
Hey that’s capitalism man
---
Slayer Helm isn't really useful until 65 Slayer
---
Low level task masters give far less slayer points than high level, see: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slayer_reward_point for reference
---
Because of this (and stats for certain tasks, along with tasklists of each master), it's not really recommended to start slayer until 85-100 combat so you can use Nieve right away, then switch to Duradel as soon as you hit 50 Slayer.
---
Something can be done but Jagex doesn't seem to want to invest more resources into it. It sucks but theres less in each tier of total level world
---
I was really proud of it for that.
---
Slayer helm or enchanted gem you buy from slayer master.
---
Check the slayer skill page for which is the highest level slayer master you can do and do that one.
---
Generally the higher the level req the harder it is
---
Don't really need 3 alts to fund that lol
---
as of this post there are 7399 max mains
---
Cant communicate my thoughts? My god you have zero reading comprehension. I literally explained it clearly enough for a 5 year old to understand, more than once.

Thanks for proving that I'm wasting my time trying to make you understand anything, nothing's getting in your thick skull. Now kindly fuck off, this conversation is over, you don't have the mental capacities to hold it.
---
Don’t worry we still had warding drama this month
---
It would be cool if The Gauntlet had RPG mechanics like Dungeoneering with the Daemonheim Ring how you could pick a different class and level it up for unique power ups was super fun. Also how you could lock items as you leveled up so you spawn with them always like hexhunter bow and blood necklace was super fun. Mechanics like that would make The Gauntlet super addicting and very fun.
---
I feel like The Gauntlet is a good base right now, but can greatly be expanded upon.
---
Im currently 87 combat and using  [Chaeldar](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Chaeldar) . Is that not correct?
---
You're fucked Mark. My dad is Jagex and I'm telling.
---
You want to always be using the highest master you can (Nieve in your case), or Konar if you don't care about XP rates at all.
---
???????

What if it detects how much was won in your accounts lifetime, and removes it from your account instantly and tells you to come back when you've earned it properly.

---
No? I'm not sure what makes you think  that.
---
This is based on the assumption every person would use an alt, it takes 3x the number of yes voters using alts to equal one no voter using an alt. It's a flawed premise to assume everyone would use an alt.
---
Sorry that I dont find getting Arthritis fun
---
Just for the record he could still be playing and no one would ever know cause it can’t track any more xp lol
---
Damn. The spiked since I last checked. No idea why that is.
---
He's probably quit until another skill comes out
---
Yeah sounds about right. Harder to get the stats for it than killing it though, lol.
---
Mine 3 ores &gt; imbue &gt; throw at the guy &gt; mine him

rinse and repeat, is there more to the strat?

mid fight yes, mid trip no.
---
&gt; They’re the only two quests I did semi-properly and didn’t rush through
---
Going off this — I don’t think I could tell you about any quest plot for RFP requirements. I brushed through those without paying any attention.
---
Looking back, I’m kind of upset that I did because I hear great things about the quests. I feel like I may have taken them for granted.
---
I’m actually ok with the update.
---
Do they have a 40 def rec? If so they're fine. Doesn't give any specialty accounts I can think of access to better options since zerkers already had 40 def anyway
---
Hell, it's still a thing on rs3. This change is definitely a surprise to me.
---
This is why no one takes "toxic" seriously... teleother is not "toxic"
---
Ayyyyy! congrats man!!! Yeah the 3rd tier plate boosts your defence quite a bit
---
Look into barrows, 1m/hr and pretty chill.
---
Knice
---
That would be nice if it were true. But no one wants to see him fail the same obstacle 14 times. No one wants to actually see him scroll through his bank to find the rope he needs. He could just skip ahead to the inventory setup and say "get a rope". There's a good reason most people I know will either watch his guides on 1.5x speed or constantly skip ahead, because he includes a lot of unnecessary footage.
---
Slippery slope is a prophecy based argument that if things confirm your belief as to what's to come, then your prediction is correct. If they don't back up your predictions, it just hasn't happened yet, and you're still correct. That argument is used by religious groups a lot to always be right.
---
Rng too
---
If you've started the quest but not finished it she will be outside lletya bank, not sure if you haven't started it though, check it. Otherwise hop on her usual spot
---
Imagine not being able to kill the Gauntlet boss without perfected weapons, yikes.
---
I think it's the fact that these chatheads are so jarringinly out of place

Put a spirit tree in your poh. It does not affect spirit tree limit anyways and you now have a priff tp in your house. No need for another tp.
---
Yo grats bro!
---
Yea but difficult with no possible way to improve (rng) is just demotivating, not fun, and bad game design
---
tried, just says there is nothing more to do here
---
Really low? 26. But at that point you wouldn't wanna be 99 range
---
I do, what does that have to do with the traps? Are they going to hit you for 60 out of the blue...?
---
The issue is inventory space, especially if you aren't using a guide, is at a premium during that quest. Learning that you can avoid the traps is part of it. Rogue's Den is literally based around this exact mechanic. If this mechanic wasn't in RD, it wouldn't be possible to complete.
---
Jagex was aware that running over traps for x tiles wouldn't trigger traps, and built the game around it to support that fact. I'm not sure how this is hard to see.
---
It's like people who think prayer flicking is cheating - It isn't - Jagex has designed the game around it and supported it as a mechanic, so it's VERY clearly valid.
---
ty ty will try
---
gotta get that shooting stars mining jaunt back
---
Shits staying dog shut the fuck up not everything's about or or needs your approval lmao
---
But her loot does increase if you're the MVP, this is known. The ash drops you get are all connected with the times you get the big loot drop.

Would an arma crossbow make a big difference over a dragon crossbow at galvek? If so I. Thinking about buying one then selling it back when I’m done

3-4 hours. Easier than ds2. Just heal up above max hp for her last attack.

There are so many of them with names from the Silmarillion! I've had a lot of fun just running around Priff trying to find them all! :D
---
garbage troll
---
can you take it off and get it back?
---
As if every single maxed main voted no.
---
There isn't one yet, you should just hop and find a world with like 5-10 players so you can get a reward. 20 or more people and you won't get a reward.
---
We should all get swastika tattoos. I'm sure everyone who sees them will be reasonable and listen as we explain what it really is :/^)
---
in the gauntlet theres a ton of rng factors and its time based
---
so you want to short run to get the shortest time, but the boss hits through prayer seemingly randomly and can combo you out, and the only food is a really slow fish thats even slower than regular food(by a tick)
---
Dude, girl, they look like shite
---
Quest was really good, new models were good besides Iorwerth, chat heads could use some work. Loving zalcano too!
---
I think a quest fight is a little different as it's a kind of challenge. I'd compare it more to other minigames like castlewars or something.
---
Not sure if you are trolling or not. Dungeoneering would have been fine as a minigame but not as a skill. That and the rewards were way to over powered.
---
Summoning also had issues that I think would now cause the skill from not passing. Collecting the charms was/is a pain in the ass and some of the summons were just stupid strong.
---
So no, if I would have to guess those skills, in the form they were introduced into RS2, would get an even lower amount of yes votes then warding did.
---
Next.
---
the fact that it hits through prayer basically nulls most skillfull work
---
Raids I can agree, but minigames should be enjoyable despite anything. I guess maybe they viewed gauntlet as diff cos it's a pet + gp farming minigam.
---
Big group, small, or solo? Trying to figure out how this things drops work
---
This wasnt polled smh
---
0/10 too obvious.
---
why’s your stamina blocked out?
---
For real tho he lookin good in this one
---
It is pretty arbitrary tbh.
---
They usually make bosses special attacks go through prayer but it's very much a case by case basis
---
Loot is fucked because runite is tied to alch price.
---
Yeah man! Everyone knows that being able to brew down and get your stats back with ovls wasn't why they were OP! These potions are literally ovls!
---
All i can hear when i see it is 'Bruuhhh where's my eyebrows'

I also just marked the safespot tiles so when I'd get caught I already had the path layed out a bit
---
What we have now is basically 2011 (minus the graphics). But to a lot of people who played through the trade restrictions and quit at eoc, 2011 isnt such a bad idea.

---
Dwogres or the little chaos dawrfs or the dudes with the hand cannons
---
I agree it should be hard, but making somthing hard by having it whack 20s through prayer is boring, lazy and fauastrsting for the player.
---
So kinky
---
Mate this entire thread is started because boaty, an extremely practiced PvMer who has completed more runs than you is complaining about RNG hits through prayer.
---
In this thread you will find dozens of other players that are not enjoying the RNG aspects of the boss among other things.
---
Its not a matter of the boss being hard, the boss is fucking pathetic, the issue is that sometimes you **will** die for reasons completely out of your control.
---
The inferno has absolutely no RNG aspects that will fuck you up to anywhere near the same extent.
---
yes you can transmog it red if you have completed it
---
What the fuck. I have 99 mining. I should be doing this?
---
I like this version of reposting so much more than traditional ones. You note it's a repost, screenshot showing the OP, don't steal anyone's idea without giving credit.
---
Let's date

He already has, this pic is like a month old twitter joke.
---
Olm is an amazing boss
---
You can hear what sort of sounds like an explosion when it hits you but by then it's too late and hard to react in time for next shot while dodging everything else.. And in corrupted its purple.. like y.
---
Inferno is honestly harder than those, simply because it was designed to be a solo encounter.
---
The difficulty from raids comes from teamwork IMO (standing together for bombs, soaking pools, killing spiders/crabs etc).

---
it should
---
Vote for Swampletics to win best youtuber, and then vote for Exposed video as best video, as Swamp mans first episode isn't a stand alone video its a series which is what the other category is for.
---
It being a skill gives a reason for more people to engage in the great content, gives you a reason to train it longer, and added a nice economic benefit to skilled players with selling floors. I loved dung and I want it badly in osrs, but making it a minigame or pvm type thing would feel terrible for me because now you are forcing me to completely plateau my progression in the game in order to do something I find fun. My experience is that most of the people who complained about dung being a skill were people who were bad at dung and too smooth brain to figure out how great it was as a piece of content.
---
Good there too expensive anyway
---
what the heck!
---
How do i use this?
---
You think i'm joking? these people don't just find someone at the ge and say "hey bring your 2 bill and come to pvp" these people use their social engineering skills they meet someone, befriend them, anti lure with them to gain trust etc it could take them 3 weeks of talking to one person and then they get a tbow but they are talking to maybe 100 people.
---
Yeah this isn't really a problem, not sure what you're holding onto that you don't need.
---
Never trained farming before, feel overwhelmed. How best to get started?
---
Pretending to be a cute noob for donations is a pretty common scam.
---
I think giving noobs a little boost (20k and full iron etc) can be good but handing a new player 10m is going to ruin a lot of the experience them
---
Maybe... now hear me out.... you’re just dogshit
---
One MVP drop can easily be worth as much as 6 + normal drops
---
They should really make him a pet.
---
Also there arent any good drops to play for. Blades gonna be under 30m in a few days and the reg loot is bad.
---
I believe it was Chaos Dwarves that dropped the Dragon Pickaxe. They also dropped the Handcannon which had a chance to break depending on your Firemaking level.
---
Blowpipe is overpowered, not ranged itself. Battlemage and Bastion didn’t pass because a lot of players don’t even know what they are yet.
---
I would recommend getting better at the game. Yes, the boss hits you through prayer. The game is too easy when you can negate all damage just from prayer. At least there’s some challenge for once.
---
They were specifically designed for your statement to be false.
---
Smoke burst then
---
the biggest balancing fuckup they did, blowpipe increased the dps with almost 1.5x from before it and they used too long to nerf that shit
---
If you brew down your stats the divine pot restores to the lowered level
---
Same to you brother. May the rng be paid forward
---
Have

You realize blade is bis 1 handed slash weapon right?  Price will probably be around rapiers price
---
stonks
---
Omar wa mou shindeiru
---
Song of the elves is a stunning piece of music though.. I turned it off after an hour too but is goood
---
What about blowpipe with addy? Isn't that still more dps?
---
Plus, rapier is 160m, blowpipe is 3.3m.
---
Looks like they both took a hit of that flute
---
Blessed spirit shield.
---
The market determines the whip price and thus how much a tent whip costs per hour.  It is pretty stable and that reflects the fact enough whips are being used as tentacle whips and thus being removed from the game that its in a balanced spot.  It would be nice if it were cheaper, but who cares if you want good gear pay for it and use it on good monsters.  There's a reason it is used a lot in raids and high lvl PvM, because its good and we dont need endgame gear just for normal slayer and easy monsters.
---
Seriously though, having a sink like this is really cool. Should have other sinks like this. Maybe have a slightly useful 1b untradeable. Maybe something similar to a bonecrusher kind of perk.
---
I believe zalcano loot is rewarded based on your participation compared to the MVP. There are 3 tiers of loot. MVP (double loot), "200k" table, and "~20k" table.
---
My guess would be that if you do the most damage, you get MVP. If you do say 80-99% (random numbers) of MVP you hit the 200k table. If you do 50-80% (again, random numbers) of MVP,  you hit the 20k table. Any less than that you get no loot.
---
I have had mass kills where I have thrown a rock and mined the boss once and got credit in a mass. I have also had a 5 man group where I threw 12 rocks and mined 14 times and got no loot.
---
I believe the 200k table is based on % compared to MVP because when I use a rune pick axe, the rate of the 20k table is SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Use a d pick and you almost always hit the 200k table.
---
But gauntlet is a boss like wintertodt. You do an activity "gathering" fight a boss at the end and get loot and maybe a pet. Literally the same rules as todt except you don't bring stuff in. Which you don't even have to for todt since it gives supplies
---
Its a runelite thing, 103 Ranged &amp; HP  it will continue to count in your total level.
---
That's why this alleged brainlet voted no. Not passing divine bastion means both divine range, and standard bastion, both have their niches.
---
Melee is bis at just as many bosses as range. Range is used excessively against trash monsters (shit like hell hounds), but there are tons of melee bosses.
---
Depends on what your goal is, do you want to make bank or just level?
---
Essentially the way it works is: 
---
1. You prepare a patch of farmland: remove weeds (with a **rake** in inventory), optionally apply **compost** (usually recommended).
---
2. You plant a seed or equivalent using a **seed dibber**. Each patch is of a specific type (herb, allotment, fruit tree, etc.) and only seeds of that type can be planted in that patch. 
---
3. Optionally pay the gardener nearby to protect your plant from disease. They ask for a specific type of farming produce depending on the plant being protected. Some patches can't be protected.
---
4. You wait however long it takes for the plant to fully grow.
---
5. You come back once it's fully grown, harvest the plant (with a **spade** in inv), and repeat.
---
Sky00 hello
---
I think it could have progress even if it was a minigame. Give it xp drops from all the activities in the dungeon and maybe even let us spend points on xp rewards.
---
The rewards (w/e they would be) would be incentive to do it, and progress dungeoneering could even be tied to a false skill of sorts. Give us ranks in dungeoneering at the end of each run but don't make it an actual skill. It would only matter in the dungeon but wouldnt have anything to show in the skills menu.
---
IQ level 200
---
I propose the paladin set to be the next variant of proselyte. Looks hella good tbh
---
Oh.... now I feel stupid.... thanks
---
Or.. they just sip a divine range and a divine super defence. Again, it's a saved inventory spot, that's all.
---
Max cash stack for each piece. And you have to buy them in ascending order, starting with shoes/gloves/ammy slots before moving into legs/cape/body/head
---
Salad robes aren't max gear...
---
&gt;Ive been saying this a lot and everyone shits on me for it. This boss is definitely doable and definitely challenging, but its not fun. Its a hodge podge of random mechanics just yoloed together for the sake of making a challenge. I feel like the fight wasnt though out, just yoloed  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I've got a good feeling it will be tuned up properly after a lot of community feedback, they're letting it run for the hell of it right now to see how we take it in and what we think about it.
---
I like how he asked for the item names and you specifically had to state how much the crown was, even though it’s in the title. 
---
Regretting it?
---
You bring nothing in, it's on a fixed timer and you restart. You risk nothing on death. You pop up outside the area. Wintertodt you respawn in lummy and drop your loot. It is far more of a traditional death.
---
Dungeoneering.  I quit when the precursor to RS3 showed up (whatever the hell that was called) but I'd come back for some basement raids.  I had around 400M xp so on 3 accounts.

Yeah I liked some of her stuff early on (like Konar) , but this like mod jed level updates with art. I can kind of appreciate the idea of fucking with autismo nerds by adding shitty art to replace the already shitty, but simplistic and nostalgic art, but fuck her if she actually thinks this is acceptable.
---
If u have every other bis gear yes if not then no
---
It's just RNG stacked on RNG. Sometimes I can't get a weapon frame, sometimes I can't get the resource rooms I need. Then going in under-geared is basically a death sentence because there's unavoidable damage.
---
Whips are seeing a steady downward trend if you look at it with the scope of the past year. In a couple years I can imagine the price of the whip being, at most, 1.5mill for a bunch of reasons.
---
of course as it gets cheaper to use the Tent whip more people will and so the price decline will probably stabilise more and more.
---
I know tent whip is used for certain content but I don;t think it's stabalising the price much right now. Pretty sure tent whip is a budget raids weapon that people dont use for very long, other than that it's dual arena.
---
whats your point?
---
Brilliantly put together :)
---
I wonder why they decided to do this with a random crown but didn't think to do this with something iconic like party hats so they aren't just throw away items.
---
No flick inferno is very possible, I believe it's actually meta for speed running.
---
Not in the same way. Clue scroll crates have the same chance to roll different numbers of items, and different items have their own weights.
---
WT crates have differing chances to roll additional rolls based on your score.
---
They finally fixed the claws spec sound :O
---
Your suggestion goes completely against the whole point of the tent whip
---
Disappointing comment.
---
What you described are overloads and if you bothered to read update blogs you would know they specifically mentioned they would not work like brews. They don't remove debufs. The only difference between devine pots and regular pots is that divine pots don't tick down every minute. If you do anything that would lower your stats a divine potion will not return to its maximum boost until you repot with an other divine or normal potion. Restores and super restores will not bring divine potions back to their maximum strength, they will only boost up to your base level.
---
How long did this take?

---
There’s a scoreboard in the room that has the fastest global time and your individual stats
---
I'll name him John Smith.
---
likely google play services then. have you tried restarting your device?
---
I think it’s the longest and oldest quest line in the game.
---
I bet we could get a 75% pass mark to make this mans account take 10x longer to level and only be allowed to world a rubber chicken so his scape isn’t ez.
---
one of the biggest reason I wanted warding to pass was so we could get rid of NMZ. It cheapens the entire game when everything is less efficient than sitting there and letting the game play itself. You can basically use whatever you have to get free exp that requires practically no attention. Go in with as much prayer bonus and drink them between episodes of your favorite show, or if you actually want to look at the screen use Dharok's and get even more hilarious rates.
---
I can't see why anyone would objectively like the old eyes better other than change = bad.
---
They look derpy as fuck and I bet they would absolutely be the source of ridicule if they were implemented today.
---
The current versions head is obviously pretty bad especially the chin, and the eyes blend in too much, but the shapes are at least natural and don't make the NPC look like their eyes are split staring at 2 different things. IMO the new head is pretty much perfect.
---
Not quite, DS2 needs 75 magic, ice burst needs only 70.
---
Sure, but if you're not that good at the game it will be very hard to do. The inferno was made with 1 tick flicking in mind.
---
Haha yeah, I'm definitely good now though, Jagex is powerless against PvP clans 🦀🦀🦀
---
LMS was added to the hiscores so there's always hope, but you're right
---
Yeah I did, I went through everything after it happened. Just didn't want to play RS again until now. I was just happy he didn't get rid on non-tradeables as I pulled my torso and avernics from my bank to do Slayer
---
The face, yeah, definitely. The hair... feels very off.
---
Ferocious Gloves, made from the Hydra Leather after completing Dragon Slayer 2 and requires 80 attack and defence to wear.
---
ferocious gloves. they are better offensively but have no def stats. barrows gloves are still a solid all around pick tho for melee.
---
sometimes phones are like humans and they just need a little time
---
That evil laughing reminds me of some eltorro64 animation
---
Ah memories, my most upvoted comment from before the Venezuelans started PKing regularly.
---
I dont see the connection to running here
---
but im upvoting for tiddies
---
Thank you! So b gloves are still basically a neccessity, as i was just about to finish off my reqs for rfd!
---
No comments? :(
---
they are really good?
---
Could rolled a 0, you have to do damage
---
Thank you I've dived in now!
---
hating dungeoneering as a skill is just unfathomable for me, it's more of a skill than let's say firemaking. at least in dungeoneering it did take you a lot to master running keys, finishing floors without dying, trying to finish large floors in teams was the most fun i've had in a game. you osrs players are just so fucking weird about adding a skill, i don't fucking get it stop being nostalgic pussies
---
Me smol brain me hate puzzels
---
best part about it is that no stats or guide will be able to do it for you.
---
Both ideally, what's good for making bank at what levels?
---
Just throwing the orbs seems to be best for me, So Imma stick with that, but the MvP thing is interesting, hope we get some confirmation from Mod ed soon
---
The spoiler is literally in the name of the quest...
---
you actually need b gloves in order to make the ferocious gloves (as well as Dragon Slayer 2) so yeah theyre def a necessity still!
---
If it came from genuine Tzhaar activities more often, I'd agree. As it stood, the onyx was a shopman-mode item, exchanged for chaos runes. Not much of value is lost.
---
Wait, for real?
---
"Who's a good boy?"
---
*clink, clink*
---
"That's right!"
---
Ahh well I stand corrected, didn’t realise people would be that stupid with money, I have no issue with luring personally and know full well of the lure. 
---
Just didn’t think people did that well from it
---
I'm not interested in making it easier, the damage can be the same or higher. It doesn't have to be as random to be meaningfully difficult.
---
Obviously you use BiS WHEN you have it.
---
There it is, the dumbest thing I read on this sub today.
---
You're telling me there is not difference between 99 and 117 defense?
---
Applying your logic you don't need range pots either but they sure as hell help.
---

idk felt like 10 hours, didn't keep track of time
---
red panda pet &gt; crab pet
---
gets removed within an hour cause you cant have any fun on there
---
Terrible idea, stop trying to streamline the game because you’re lazy/ can’t focus for longer than 1 hour. If I wanted fluffy runescape 3 type content I would play runescape 3, and not OSRS.
---
Was there a competition or something to submit entries?
---
Unistall and Reinstall
---
a raids 2 kc cape recolor, very original
---
Very nice! Always look forward to the videos
---
Well the real discrepancy is that Divine Super Combats passed (5 minute perm boost to Atk/Str/Def), but the magic and ranged variants didn't.
---
Cost of all the supplies while learning?
---
What’s the biggest cost? Blood runes? Or scales
---
it's a poor mashup of stealing creation and dungeoneering. i just want the real dungeoneering from 2010/2011
---
Great Post! but you mustve forgot to say to mod ash that you'll suck his dick ?
---
1b rapier and tbow hmmm
---
xGrace’s CC = Progrix
---
For a normal account, sure.  For ironmen its all a litany of pain anyway.   Good point though - I'm not saying this change should be reverted, just it always seemed onyxes were a bit of a holy cow in osrs, since the next tier of jewelry requires onyxes as well as itself, and the tzaar were p much the only reliable source.
---
My dudes I've tweeted mod ash and he told me that the elven scouts at the location where eluned used to be will do it. I just tested it and can confirm that it works!
---
5% chance of not using charges with the new crystal armor\\tools\\weapons (not including the blade of saeldor).
---
Ooh nice
---
I completely disagree. A death should only be dangerous if it feels like a real death. For example, when a boss one hits me and I can go to an npc and collect my items, it feels safe and I dont think a hc should lose their status. If i’m farming dragons and I die afk, or I go hunt the new chicken and it smacks me, that feels dangerous and i should lose hc
---
Twilight Sparkle used to be a unicorn but later gained Pegasus wings, turning into an alicorn which is a unicorn Pegasus
---
Yeah, they changed it to the pre-eoc sound effect from back in the day in rs2.
---
I'd imagine the nostalgia hungry angst filled kids would love this but apparently they like the hackjob sword sound effect that they threw together for osrs more? Y'all just lookin to get mad over anything.
---
You are lightyears away from being able to do raids
---
They changed it to the rs2 sound from back in the day, even as a joke this falls flat
---
I've noticed the other way around, I can chuck 5 orbs at her each time around and get nothing but if I touch her with a pick once I get something. It's probably just that you have to contribute and I keep missing orbs while you keep missing attempts to mine.
---
All I did was translate the original Artisan idea to a spreadsheet :P
---
Same on iphone
---
Boaty needs to go back and learn proper English sentencing
---
Why do you refer to it is as just ironmanscape when it benefits all types of accounts? You just sell it for gp what else would you want mods to drop??
---
Fuck slut. Got kicked cause I called her out on her botting.
---
Yeah it’s way better than mm2 or song of the elves
---
It sold for 205m. I bet it's gonna drop in price very quickly, since rapier is 156m
---
10/10 wouldnt mind
---
You realise that the gauntlet is basically dungeoneering right?
---
Soo fucking funny! Only seen it 5 times before 😂😂💯💯👌🤙🤙
---
Oof
---
Yeah actually the point is that he added it up to 666.
---
It's really that insane? Even if I have maxed gear?
---
Yes, that obviously is ideal intention of the polls. What do you think Jagex want? To please 25% of the players or to make their live as long as possible?
---
Of course Jagex won't come around and say "pls only vote for what is the best for the game." They also don't say that "Vote only in your best interest." You can vote for whatever reasons you want but that doesn't make those reasons not selfish.
---
The thought that all players should only vote in their best interest and vote no for all content that they have no interest or know nothing about is also stupid. Imagine if all players that didn't like questing voted no for every possible quest. How is that a valid rationale?
---
You're right about one thing though, that is how democracy works, but if we're talking about democracy, then why is it 75/25 and not 50/50? I'm not saying that 50/50 would be better for the game but democracy is about pleasing the majority of the people, and since 2/3 of the player base voted yes then democratically it should have passed.
---
Forgot the 500k on the recolor 😉
---
BTW do you know if you can use those recolor crystals on the cape?
---
What are the rules for the drama calendar anyway? I thought it was meant for jagex fuck ups?
---
Indeed :/. One thing i made sure of is to never dip into my cash stack, to only make the money i needed for supplies right then and there. Taking a day off every 2 weeks was perfect for me to make that amount of money, around 12-13m. This was me going ham on attempts though going through death runes and scales like crazy, i must be in the hundreds. Used addy darts and just brought a dragon dart switch to save money and thats what i was comfortable with. Only swapped to dragon on zuk, i used to swap on jads but theyve become cake for me now. I will say this tho, the money making day, sometimes it would take 3 hours, sometimes it would take 7-10 hours, so luck is definitely a factor there.
---
Food heals 20 and gives you a massive delay on DPS, meanwhile the boss can sometimes shit out constant 15s through prayer
---
I'm not saying it's a regular thing, just that it feels like absolute shite when it does happen
---
That's how I first heard about the game was asking another kid playing it at the library.
---
Dragon crossbow is cheap nowadays and you can go in with 20-25 of each bolts and should be fine
---
But I didn't.
---
Its just a fact that the boss can hit through prayer and deals almost as much as a single food when he does.
---
Compounded with the fact that food has a delay to stop you DPSing and it even a brainlet could work out that if you get unlucky, you die.
---
That's literally what boaty is saying in his tweet
---
You know why the word subscription means right?
---
MM2 and DS2 are my two favourite quests by a mile. The MM2 platform was fine ignore people.
---
If you’re woox level then you can do it
---
What's this crown called again?
---
The BiS gloves are still locked behind RfD and DS2
---
The two best alternatives are pricey enough to justify the stats IMO.
---
Seems fine with me in line with current balance of gloves.
---
Dont forget augury, but the people downvoting this comment have never pk'd with max mage before. Not saying a dhins nerf would help this.
---
The hard mode gives a cosmetic Cape that looks a bit shit.
---
Apparently the loot you get is improved too.
---
Oh well yeah that actually makes sense
---
Ngl 191 dragon implings caught is pretty impressive.
---
Comboing is where something consistently lands hits to the point that you can't do anything but eat food ,which is what this boss does with his autos.
---
You're thinking of being stacked out where you get slapped by a bunch of damage at once, which only happens when you fuck up mechanics
---
&gt;Textures
---
Imma stop you right there
---
I can't tell if you're trolling
---
If you have 99 combat with 60 att and 42 def + max gear it may be do-able but it sucks that you're missing out on some BIS armor. 
---
Do you have a main where you can practice on?
---
Mod ash as already said that they can't make it.
---
I’m not, it’s randomised rooms where you need to gain materials to beat a final challenge on the “floor”. It’s the closest thing osrs has to it.
---
1/11$ droprate
---
These chests are wild, I’ve opened 40 and nothing under 37k in loot
---
Oh right never knew that.
---
Do you charge them with the crystals from priff?
---
I was going to say, I think Jagex handled the warding poll very well. The community was a pile of shit.
---
Yea I agree that it can be pretty unforgiving at times, but I don't think any of the kills are ever impossible (in normal mode) and that every run can 100% end in a completion regardless of the bosses heavy hits (once again, in normal mode).
---
Corrupted is a different beast entirely though :/
---
Congrats! I’m at something like 14.7 and my highest is 91 range. Hoping to achieve the same feeling soon!

Man you're such a cringy dumbass spamming that shit everwhere like a 5 year old kid who just learned a swear word.
---
Forreal. It feels like it was made by somebody who wanted player owned houses, but couldnt come up with an idea for how to train it, so they just said 'fuck it' and put it in thinking they'd add more methods later than just spam building things in your house
---
Fast forward 13 years and I've seen numerous posts talking about how construction should not have any alternative training methods because it would ruin its integrity as a buyable.
---
Its a shame, because player owned houses are amazing, but training construction is worse than RC imo. The only reason it doesnt get as much hate is because it is so fast.

Buy it on GE is on my FL ingame, dont even know what this is but im rooting for him.

He is an amazing YouTube content creator, and idk why he doesn't get more views.

He is clever, fun, has great editing and over all interesting content :)
---
How much would you say you used per attempt?
---
If it means anything, I think OP's rant is a pointless one to be honest, and many other people are just bandwagonning on the hate because everyone loves having something to complain in this subreddit.
---
That stray pixel made me think my monitor was dirty.
---
fucker
---
I feel the same about Framed. The gridlock series is sweet.
---
Yeah man. I got one right between my eyes. People are so rude though, they just beat the shit out of me before I can explain how I’m trying to take the swastika back as a symbol of peace and love.

"Epic memester" :o

You are a beautiful person

Made my day

thats so weird
---
The music lines up so well
---
Only until thursday, the nerf may make it dead content
---
Now it would be average, it's at minimum 1 hour, usually about 90 mins, costs a lot of supplies and you may die and have to start over. Would be quite op getting massive slayer xp and an onyx on task though.
---
I use Lyzrdlite. But I don't see the difference between its left click only plugins and RL+'s. They're both overpowered in my opinion but it seems RL+ is the only client to get hated on for it.
---
Yeah man mining a rock smelting it and then imbuing it don't use mining smithing or runecrafting at all I can't believe I didn't see that.
---
You vote no for warding, I vote Yes to current chat heads! /s
---
Time to start again. Account ruined.
---
So 4.6m per hour?
---
what about a golden shower instead?
---
Cit nerd
---
But, swaplettuce...
---
Bro, this gives me more motivation to not give up on inferno. Ive been trying so much and got to zuk 6 times dying stupid ways. Gz man.
---
It's actually not a big deal because during Runescape Classic, a duping method was discovered and people duped so many phats that the price dropped just like it is now, and it eventually recovered.
---
Muscle memory panic
---
Yugioh?

I wouldn't personally trust either of those clients

buy from ge?

if ironman, pick up all seed drops and also do contracts at farming guild for free seeds (sometimes even useful ones)
---
Holy fuck. Normally I hate these “zomg muh reddit rng” posts but that fucking blows. Here’s to your back-to-back dh bodies.
---
Soon
---
Great question. The thought has definitely crossed my mind and if it was a few mil upgrade it wouldve been a no brainer, but the fact that it was 80+ mil for any set upgrade i wanted, combined with the fact i liked the extra challenge, that im a cheap person, and the idea that the harder challenge will make me even better at the game, I decided to stick with the lesser gear. Also everyone that doubted me because of that decision helped a lot, good source of motivation.
---
Damn I was just about to hack this dude's account then I noticed he censored the run energy and that stopped me right in my tracks smh....
---
Kids in Venezuela could've eaten those 220m
---
If it ain't torvesta or linksocarina, I couldnt care less.
---
But in the past it was gender specific based on what gender your character is.   I was confused the whole quest that I kept being called a "they"
---
When I did my 99 grind I was able to kinda cheese it by putting weight on both the 1 and 4 keys at the exact same time so they would alternate in chat. Made it so all I had to do was right click and left click.
---
Congrats! How’s it feel?

Time to get all the alts ready to vote no on changing the heads.

Love both of them too... Feels bad but I like J1mmy more. His By Release series is the best
---
Just bought rapier for 165m to realise this is the power creep all over again this game has just become a business all over again
---
150 atm.. i took a [long break](https://i.imgur.com/YqM58fI.png) from barrows because i was so done with it, thought i'd revisit it
---
guess it was a mistake
---
between the hops, basically you can have like 10 worldhops "stored" and you will get another hop every 30 seconds. If you're logged in for 30 seconds between each hop, you'll never get the "too many login attempts" screen.
---
Nah, players should be incentivized to actually play the game, not just afk everything
---
I'm gonna LS swap it, add a massive bousozoku body kit on it and write it off in the mountains of Japan in a week
---
Literally does not compute*
---
AGREED. By Release is the best series on Youtube... By far
---
It's fine mate, I figured out exactly what happened. The click of me running south east made me go right to the safe spot while the next two right before the wave were 1 tile left. It was barely the left tile and in the moment it looked right. It's hard to know the different between a couple of pixels when you're paying attention to multiple things and it's going fast. I always spam click when I move and I'm use to how I do it, I was never panicking during the boss as I've done it multiple times and even once before on another HC. The ping didn't affect me that much, as I had gotten to that point no problem and dodged 4 or 5 waves at that point and was at the 3rd phase of the boss already. I was never complaining or begging for my status back, I was trying to recreate the movement because I've never seen that before as you always walk diagonal at the end of the path, not randomly on the middle like that. Now that I know what happened, I'll move on.
---
Talk to the Wise Old Man in Draynor.

1. Pressing the logout button puts in a request to pause the caves. It continues until the round is over
---
2. Whenever you brew down and whenever you lose a significant part of the boost
---
3. People do it with considerably lower stats all the time. The caves really are ez, just tough for some because of the time investment
---
Hey that’s a lot of boltracks. Could get yourself 40k range xp at ammonite crabs with that.
---
I like Swampletics a lot. I really do. But J1mmy adds humor to his videos which not only makes it enjoyable but also funny.
---
I forgot to mention im a ironman lol, what monsters are good for seed drops ? I got 40 slayer
---
Riot world 66
---
I remember getting 75 and cutting 100 to sell for 100k whenever I needed some quick cash... same with sharks hahaha
---
Don't speak for us all, this is something only a small portion wants. #voteno towards the headchat change
---
Framed is good. He’s in my top 10. Tbh I’m not a fan of gridlock though because it’s not ironman.
---
RSC didn't age well so it absolutely needed to be updated. However the game was actually "balanced" and made sense during RSC so it was actually very entertaining. 
---
Skilling was actually worth doing, everyone was specialized into certain skills so each player was unique. The wilderness actually had appropriate risk vs reward and the combat system actually gave everyone a chance. Even to this day stuff like axe hut/pirates/greaters/rune rocks were all implemented because of RSC and were used by people actually playing the game rather than only pkers/guilds. 
---
The typical RSC player probably finds the Runescape of today pointless since everyone has already accomplished everything, there's no competition or uniqueness to player accounts. 
---
The max level is still 99? they've only added a couple of things per skill 15 years later? why is training at pirates in deep wild terrible exp compared to methods with no risk?
---
Runescapers these days play for different reasons like raiding, achievements, etc...so the type of people that play are just completely different.
---
I now feel immensely bad about just using Wiki quick guides and space bar mashing the dialogue for every quest.
---
It happened after he wrote a book detailing how jagex allows gold farmers to operate in every world free of bans.
---
I'll check'em out.  Never even been recommended to me so I don't have high hopes.

Reeeeeeeepost.
---
I thought you couldn’t boost for it/kill it off task?

now u need to do gauntlet hard mode so u can metamorph it
---
i wish i could solo bandos, i feel like i dont have powerfull enough gear, not sure
---
We still have four days left in July
---
Panda and raccoon are different type of animals lol.
---
Does this mean crystal keys should rise a bit?
---
There's no problem, just people are overestimating how good a divine range bastion would be, considering people will be pairing it with a divine super combat anyway (which somehow passed but bastion didn't?) for 90% of content.
---
The whip is a pretty big upgrade from a d scimmy, for a btw. This is an upgrade from the whip.
---
oh oops, just noticed, wooh! THANKS :D
---
Never heard of lilsmokey... He any good?
---
Not one 69 in sight.
---
Go back in your cave
---
If you go members, look up an efficient quest list. Some quests you can do at low levels and get quest exp that lets you skip 20-30 early levels.
---
If not members, do knight's sword for ez smithing exp. Dark mages are good gp because of the runes, but you need some decent melee/ranged stats and ranged armor to kill then consistently. Kill only the lvl 7s, I dont think the rune drops differ to the point where it makes a difference. the lvl 20s will hit too hard.
---
You have my complete respect for doing this just for the sake of figuring out what happens.
---
I got ahrims top on 7 kc. Gl to you
---
So the heart was absolutely a necessity because i started my grind at 94 mage, and the bats bring down ur stats, including mage, very regularly, so since i needed 94 mage to ice barrage nibblers every wave, having the heart means I wouldn't have to worry about this. In my opinion that heart is necessary below 97 mage, that +3 is enough of a safety net for bats to not cause too much of a hassle. A fun note is i also started with 95 range/ 96 hp and now theyre both 99 lol. Only from inferno. Also got a full att level only from sgs specs. Also 2 full mage levels, almost 3
---
How many did you catch?
---
Get your crystal keys for cheap while you can, the new chest is dropping loot worth way more than the keys are selling for
---
It's fun, the rewards fr9m Zalcano are just way better, and Zalcano is way easier.
---
I heard it has something like a between 1 and 3 hour respawn
---
Is it 1:1? Then yes
---
Platform section sucked ass but the satisfaction from beating it was worth it.
---
Every day we stray further from Saradomin's light...
---
why don't they just hire a prostitute or something if they can't get sex? or are they against that?
---
Honestly, the rest of the options impressed me way more. Rendi has absurd game knowledge and execution, coupled with great video editing. Settled has absurd dedication to grinds in addition to excellent editing.
---
Ballin. I mean I’ve played off and on since 2006 and my account is about at those levels on RS3. I’d be stoked to get those levels on my OSRS account!
---
Well. If were lucky they will patch it
---
lol haha
---
Integrated graphics just means the GPU shares a space with the CPU. Not that it's super weak. Modern iGPUs are eating into the middle range of dedicated cards.
---
OSRS is very light. If your GPU architecture is supported, it WILL make things smoother. It's about efficiency as much as it is framerate.
---
I definitely recommend dks, because you can immediately jump into it and practice whenever, whereas the inferno you would need to face some melee, blobs, and bots for 16 waves before u finally see a ranger, so it doesnt make sense to brute force it when you have no experience in their attack cycle. Not to mention the money ull get from dks! Have you completed fremmy elites? Would you like to add me in game and on disc? I would love nothing more than to take u on some dk trips, help u practice, and answer any questions you have
---
You need a hobby
---
My best advice? Don't focus on efficiency at all. Learn at your own pace and do things that you enjoy doing.
---
Best of luck. There’s a lot of good people in game but just as many toxic players. So be weary!
---
Elena’s chathead is on there.
---
Runecrafting bad lmao xd
---
Roughly 5 others. I was the “mvp” and had the ashes/double drop that kill as well.

Correction: the people downvoting have never been attacked by anyone wearing anything other than salad robes/mystic.

This one right here is the one you want
---
i don’t think paying 122 dollars a year for one game is a good deal man. That adds up over time, and i can play any game i want by the way. Imagine if this game was 122 dollars, or for you guys who have played longer 244, or 366? for one game? That seems like too much to me. I love the game but jesus that much money is ridiculous to me. Each to their own though i suppose.
---
Yeah i have the elites. That would be great. Can't thank you enough for that offer. Name ingame is LKAOZ. Let me know yours so I can also give you discrod #. Happy cake day btw

Pandas are actually more related to racoons than bears
---
Never heard of that one. What happened?
---
What's Runefest like?
---
"Ah!"

"Snake what's wrong?"

"Crab broke my knife"
---
Apart from Zalcano finally giving high level skilling a good money maker, my biggest takeaway from all of the new elven content is that Jagex made all of the new equipment drops very, **very** rare.
---
i've only played for a few days, i'm still low level, but i'll keep that in mind if I ever get a membership
---
I don't get it, is this about the new boss being nerfed or is a jmod just saying fuck the whole mining skill?
---
inb4, engine work.
---
They should edit the text for the task :/
---
Good luck have fun, I would suggest not skipping past all the text boxes, there is some really good dialogue that most people miss
---
Considering the huge division in the subreddit and the mass pro-Warding posts telling people to vote yes and the ‘people who vote no are neckbeards and didn’t read the dev blog’ I thought it was worth putting in even though it wasn’t Jagex’s fault.
---
Look at the bones!
---
How many people got their acc stolen for them? Or scammed?
---
Not wurth the trouble.
---
Get yourself items like twisted bow that are wurth more then your santa hat back in the day
---
Can no longer trade people at ZMI/ Ocuarania altar due to the high XP rates even though looking back on it - it doesn’t seem that Drama-worthy.
---
same as you! same years, same skill, first 99 too (I havet achieved it yet, but i'm at 95 str)
---
lol haha lmao
---
To clarify he said they could make it, it would just take at east 8 months of development time with no other updates. But obviously neither the devs or community will commit to that.
---
both 99
---
Lol
---
Drops are still random, baby.
---
Red pandas? Sure.
---
Giant pandas? They're just lazy grayscale bears.
---
Agreed. And unlocking transportation methods early makes the game some much more enjoyable.
---
Anything? 
---
*creepy smirk* 😏
---
I see a lot of people saying this I have yet to see any proof of bans so...source? Evidence to back up that claim?
---
I hear people liked barrows
---
That too!
---
Stake.com V2 ?

---
Your firemaking LVL is only 1 more that your runecrafting LVL, jeez
---
I don’t understand this meme lol. Like, do people really dc that often? I’ve legitimately never dc’d in this game...
---
I believe it’s the best xp in the game
---
Yeah what this guy says although I spend 15 hours a day AFK in NMZ. It's just so addictive ffs.
---
According to the clarification blog link in another comment

&gt; You may now only use your operating system's official default mouse keys program, **unless it is to remap a key to any other button**.

So it looks like its fine to use other software to remap keys.

Nice.

Yeah since yesterday I had this problem too. Report it in game by right clicking report abuse. I waited 17 minutes to get back in yesterday. I tried it this morning and it was still the same.
---
Meant engineering reverse what wondered always I.
---
We should have rare items from an insanely hard boss witch is impossible to kill without a large team and good coördination.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
Upboat for attention
---
100% agree. At the end of the day pets are really a by-product of doing content to most players besides completionists.
---
It's just starting to feel like Jagex is throwing pets on everything for the sake of doing it lately. Lets be honest once the launch week hype dies down, if Zalcano didn't have a pet drop do we see that kind of content having a long shelf life with its sub-par xp and barely passable gp p/h, mostly ironmen going for crystal tool seeds and shards if anything.
---
Can get stacked out for full hp easily in a few ticks
---
Playing for ranks is dumb one, and two people with your sentiment miss the point of a hcim I think. (Hint; it’s not play pillowscape so that you never are in any danger ever)
---
Dude nah man I love J1mmy, IMO his from release series is underrated and I get far more enjoyment from those over the swampman videos (those are good though too)
---
How long did it take before you got a clear? doing it on my zerk and it's been a nightmare trying to get one.
---
I personally voted no because I didn't like the skill, not because I want keep it OS. If the right skill comes along I'll vote yes.
---
i agree. and before the key nerf or whatever! id honestly rather play a 2011 version of RS3 than osrs in general.
---
Ash isn't a girl.
---
&gt; if they add warding it would be years before they add another
---
I am definitely not saying you're wrong to have that opinion, however it is the reason we'll never get another skill to pass at 75% as it entirely depends on taste. If there's a significant percentage of people who feel they won't vote for a skill *unless* it's the kind of skill that is to their taste then even if 90% of people want a skill there's never going to be a skill that 75% of people can agree is exactly the one they want. 
---
80% of people might want a skill, but it's obvious at least a quarter of them don't want a buyable; I highly doubt more than 3/4 of them want a gathering skill and, there's a large percentage of people who don't want combat to change so a combat skill is out, and there's a significant margin of people who don't want minigame-like skills as anything other than minigames.
---
can i break even on gp/exp if i barrage nechs not on slayer task?
---
A Friend was this year too...
---
Heyy welcome! If you ever need a clan chat to chill in join “evo clan” clan chat its a high level clan but a really good group of friendly people i joined 2-3 years ago now and never looked back.
---
Great vid! Can tell how much effort you put into the editing
---
Its a ahame runescape is so garbage now :/
---
How about some wheel that we can spin maybe daily that gives random xp lamps and you can buy more of these spins with real money
---
Raids dont give as many resources, without rares you probably get enough to pay for supllies. If you get 3m gp/h at COX it takes into account all the rares over time. On the other hand Zalcano give 3m gp/h from resources (might be even more now that people is using tick manipulation).
---
You just need to see what the mining and smithing rework did in Rs3 to the price of the uncut onyx (it went from 1.5m to alch price in less than 12 hours) to know that dropping large amounts of raw resources like that will fuck all the prices
---
I dont have 300g yet on OSRS. Just the stuff I left noob island with.
---
don't kill dharok if you dont want dharok gear
---
Man how can you wake up dead?

Warding doesn't pass. 
---
Know your place trash!

The answer is probably Lady Trahaearn. She is the old lady with the exoskeleton that you repair with the rune bar.
---
Twitch, his vod from yesterday or the day before both feature him doing tick manip
---
I used the guide on wiki but I teleported around the seals to save time. I also put mirrors down when I saw subsequent steps nearby. 
---
It was a lot more pain free than MEP2.

You weren't locked by previous mirrors, failed first agility shortcut twice at 77 with pie. 
---
It was just lengthy.
---
I have no lore background even though I've been playing for over a decade.

I stopped questing past roving elves, I didnt even start temple of light on rs3 even though I was maxed.

---
Ticking has been 100% confirmed ok by jmods, same with prayer flicking. Also it doesnt make sense, when they have actively compared it to wintertodt, for it to scale so heavily
---
So many restores. Holy shit
---
How do you tell if you got MVP?
---
Genuine question, what if they *don't* poll it? I understand the principal behind voting for every major update, but assuming that's not a factor.
---
how does that affect you whatsoever if it was added without polling? It would have absolutely zero impact on your game at all, just like ironman does now.

Tob is 8m/hr, CoX is just behind that at around 6-7m/hr and Zulrah and Vorkath are about 3-4m/hr depending on gear, levels and experience with the boss.
---
Didn’t know how many I needed, once the loot started flowing I knew I was fucked lmaoo
---
This reminds me of that time capsule ep of parks and rec when that Twilight guy is telling Tom that there's a second book... and a third one.
---
You’ll struggle to find anyone that will take you with 80 att if you’re planning on dps. Only way to get in group is to tank for low lvls unless you’re with a clan
---
I did puzzles easily but I thought the dialogue was poorly written
---
Hey you can add me, just DM me for my rsn :)
---
Warding fills a gap that has been present in the game from the jump: crafting magical items. It’s an amazing idea for a new skill that actually fits. 
---
Though what makes me most upset, I think, is training hunter and realizing how little it adds to the game and how boring of a skill it is to train. I’d trade my million hunter XP to start fresh on warding in a heartbeat because it’d be a more rewarding, useful skill, rather than just another set of numbers I have to get.
---
I see your point, but divine potions don't help kill time on bosses currently and a divine bastion also wouldn't have. They would've slightly made combat easier or more afk in cases where you didn't have to brew, but not faster kill times. At top end efficiency, they shouldn't particularly do anything other than saving supply costs on more potions. I'm confused why people would allow divine range but not divine bastion.
---
Give me an add! My RSN is Beetl, my combat is 70 so Ive still got a ways to go and I need rs buddies

You get double rolls on your loot and ashes on the kill.
---
Yeah but I’m not an Ironman, so I sold Ahrim top for 2 mil. Also got a Karil crossbow same chest
---
If you get the ashes drop.

ow word

After seeing how much people are freaking out over a stupid chat head I totally agree with you.
---
Sorry joke police officer, I'll make sure u/frog_avenger consults you before making any more light hearted jokes.

Nope. Zero support

XP should not be buyable. No limits will make buyable XP okay

This is a troll post btw lol

You know games necklace exists, yes?

Hcim hasn't even been out for that long. My hcim has been played on for a total of at the very most 3 months and it's rank 2700 ish. He's not wrong at all.
---
I actually prefer following the guide except when I decide to go for a specific unlock (like today I plan on starting the pirate chain so I can unlock cave horrors for instance) because having a checklist I can move down feels less overwhelming for me than just having a big ol pile of unorganized quests sitting in front of me.
---
How good is the new crystal armour?
---
110 kc, also didn't see any pet drops...
---
No! I'm actually enjoying doing it, will be updating as I go through, will try to finish the quest by tomorrow
---
I remember there being drama. Only for a few days but either way I guess it still fits the calendar.
---
It has 0 impact on the game for other people so I don't see how this should be polled no matter what.
---
All hail the all might Buttholes and kiss his savage toes
---
its an absolute beauty, I wish the corrupted version had more than a red recolor as blue imo looks the best

IDK man everything is temporarily. Enjoy yourself. And work on the reading comprehension, I used avoiding the wilderness as an example of a dumb thing hcim should not do. Also explained I don't play one. But thank you for the unsolicited and useless in deep wildy advice!

I'm ootl what partnership poll??

They are NOT microtransactions as they require you to play the content rather than purchasing it. It also takes alot of time depending on how long you do the activity which all comes down to persistence and dedication.
---
Not only that, pets contribute to gold sink for players who want to keep them forever and if they lose it, pay another gold fee to get it back.
---
Then why would you want to fish in catherby? Just go to draynor til you can do trout and then go to barbarian village. Killing cows and selling hides should be more than enough for some starter cash.

I got my personal best at wave 52 last night. Probably done 15-20 attempts and feel like I am terrible. I am using acb as well.

I do normals with t1 gear and one t3 weapon, so just upgrading to t2 armor and two t3 weapons with more food would probably be plenty for anyone

So tired of cultural appropriation. It’s not okay!

Thanks!

Nah less than a year. Ranks at that point arent even conpetitive. I didnt even tske precautions to stay alive. Never wore a RoL or anything
---
We already have many of the dungeoneering rewards in game already.
---
Note: *you* don't get to decide what the point of someone's HC account is. If they want to have an impressive PVM, awesome. If they want to use the gamemode as a new leader board to compete for ranks on, that's awesome. Don't you think that freedom of choice is what makes OSRS such a good game?

fletching is the quickest not the easiest. it costs like 100m to do darts to 99.

Can you share inventory and equipped items? Looks like things I can afford
---
It WILL have an impact on the game. Any major introduction will.  It would introduce more content to cater towards group ironman which will naturally create changes in the way solo ironmen play. 
---
&amp;#x200B;

It needs to be polled, to say otherwise goes against the whole concept of OSRS

She's written a bunch of books and has a popular TV show where she helps people with organization/clutter issues around their homes get rid of excess belongings (mostly only keep stuff that sparks joy when you see it) and better organize the things they keep after de-cluttering.
---
Yes, those are toned down versions of the rewards. We already also have: herbicide (herb sack), bonecrusher, rigour and augury.
---
Yeah that would be neat. 
---
Or they could keep it a herb patch but just have an elf grow something there like with My Arm's patch so the player doesn't actually get another herb patch.
---
Even if he buys bonds to sustain membership someone will have paid for the bonds
---
I just want my Ratatouille pet god damn it
---
Does it give mining xp? If so, how much?
---
This is wholesome :)
---
I think 1/1000 is too common considering they have absolutely no requirements and aren't a boss, but making it rarer makes it pointless.
---
okay what was the point of this post
---
Jagex wanted to temp put cosmetic stuff (house design/god tps) behind a partnership deal, it'll be free after some time
---
I'm holding a mirror: why do we fall over details of a new skill. yet at other points details don't matter and we just want "more bosses" - even though bosses weren't actually really part of runescape for the longest time, new skills were coming out faster than new bosses for a very very long time.

What about mtx?
---
Obviously the jug is metal, therefore one it should be added to smithing. Personally think it would be too OP of you could smith it before 97 tho
---
Destroy my tent whip so I could sell it once again.
---
Yea 59 minutes and 30 seconds is clearly only 89 seconds
---
To say that it wouldn't affect non group players whatsoever is naive. What if the content that is brought forward to group ironman is so meta that solo players lose out on not grouping up? Has one basic example like this crossed your mind?
---
Pretty sure this guy robbed a completely innocent bank.  Contact the authorities for me.
---
No no, I didn't mean to sound like you were wrong, I was just adding clarification for op and others that may have still been confused :) Sorry for any misunderstanding
---
That's not even drama, that's a blip in the sea of minor memes
---
11m in 2 hours at zalcano? Wat
---
TBF osrs is a very rng focused game.. And rng plays a factor in almost all pvm content. Personally I think this boss is perfectly suited for its' intended difficulty. We don't need another boss where if you can count to 4 and run around the room you take 0 damage.. The fact that it can easily hit 15+ through prayer makes the whole fight way more intense. That is literally the point. Gauntlet is supposed to be a challenging and intense minigame to race against the clock and fight a difficult boss with limited resources. I get the whole weapon frame drop being so rng based and t3 weapons being very rng based to find but the point is to adapt with each run. But speaking with 50kc+, i personally feel that its not that difficult to consistently complete runs within the allotted 10 min prep time. I'm always trying to get speed runs done so prep is usually anywhere from 3-6 mins for me. Corrupted on the other hand is VERY rng based and easily one of the most difficult things to successfully complete in the entire game. Being someone who has infernal cape and 1k+ cox kc, i found corrupted mode to be insanely challenging with only 1 successful kc in 20+ attempts. But this game needs more challenging bosses/minigames like this.
---
Mvp gets 2 drops and ashes drop as well. I believe anyone can get the pet, the mvp thing for that was just a rumor
---
Two attempts, two rolls at 1/5461 chance with two successes. 
---
Can use a binomial:
---
https://i.imgur.com/YD6Bb0c.png

where P(x) is the probability of x successes out of N trials, N is the number of trials, and π is the probability of success on a given trial.
---
N = 2
---
π = 1/5461 = 0.00018311664
---
x= 2 (successes)
---
https://i.imgur.com/5MyNurt.png

You underestimate what kinda ideology you have to have to be competitive in this game. 
---
The addiction you’re shaming in one person is without a doubt more widespread than you think.
---
Yeah, we eat using forks and spoons
---
I know how to play it, it's just the speed at which you need to keep up makes it exhausting. You don't get 3 rocks out of the first pick swing at rock, and Zalcano just shot it to destroy it?
---
Grats on the 0 or 20k loot buddy. Everyone else is already imbuing.
---
Would you like my real answer or a lie?
---
My apologies, all good.
---
yikes
---
The collection log is an item you can get from the varrock museum. It tracks loot from bosses, minigames, clues, etc.
---
What's forcing you to train a skill? All the rewards from the new skills can be made tradeable, just like how rigour and augury are both tradeable. I'm sure a big part of the playerbase is against untradeable strong rewards from skilling, like ovls and dung were
---
thanks lol. just wanted to post it so i have somewhere to remember it and continue bossing
---
Why the hell did this comment get downvoted? It’s accurate and useful.  Fuckin plebs
---
Shh. We don’t talk about that side of RuneScape here.
---
damn that's crazy I didn't know when someone says the word "ape" you automatically think of a human
---
I thought it being bound to chaos rune prices and stable at 3m was a good thing.
---
Ye, DG had such a giving and capturing gameplay, created many interesting niche subcultures/communities.
---
What sort of content do you think Jagex will bring that benefits group ironmen but not regular ironmen?
---
You're saying not doing new boss content on a hardcore the first few days its released is pillowscape? Jfc man get a grip. You cant be this dense.
---
Wow that's really in depth. Thank you
---
Absolutely. But 50% damage with ridiculous accuracy when food only heals 20 and has a massive delay is still dogshit.
---
Because this has nothing to do with her vagina, incel.
---
The Ice barrage sound, best soudntrack to wake up with. Decent ringtone too.
---
Yeah I mean that’s literally the only reason. It gives a reason to grind otherwise dead content, ofc that’s a good thing 
---
As for sarchnis, I sorta agree but not really Bc I think jagex we’re intending to give med levels the full bossing experience, complete with mechanics and the pet
---
Sara"he"1
---
Was that your gf? 10/10 was a dude.
---
I have everything but ahrim's top... fml
---
Yeah we both know why you purposefully omitted the "never add up **to enough damage**" part.
---
Majority of your damage taken is not the same as enough to consistently fuck up the majority of runs.
---
Group ironmen can use the same methods/shopruns that regular ironmen can. And regular ironmen can already do group bosses together. So your "content catered towards group ironmen" is highly unlikely.
---
Group ironman is basically just a few ironman linked together, not affecting you in any way.
---
On the contrary, jagex doesn't have to make everything solo friendly and any group content they do add is also good for non ironmen.
---
Or are you worried more group content/bosses will get added and you'll actually have to try and makr some friends.
---
Give me some examples of "group ironman content" that would be game breaking for the group of "normal" account players.
---
Someone would do this if Zulrah and NMZ hadn't pumped in billions and billions of Flax in the game.
---
Twisted bow will be worthless as more and more of them are dropped, especially when a better bow comes out in the future. People could get their acc stolen for a twisted bow too, what's your point?

Tiny Hands can't block people because he uses his Twitter for official president stuff. Every American has permission to see that info, by Court ruling.
---
If you want to buy them with gp then you get them off the g e and pay the convert price to make them tradeable again. After that turn your accept aid on your Ironman act and right click use the bond on your iron. It will bring up dialog boxes on both acts you need to select yes on.
---
No, PVMers only do top gp per hour content. Its really dumb but its the reality.
---
It's a perfect comparison
---
Because if it becomes taxing to be a solo ironman rather than group ironman, solo ironman will become obsolete.
---
Just as Wintertodt turned traditional fire making obsolete because you're at a disadvantage if you train the traditional way, rather than AFKing &amp; profiting in the mini game
---
Modd Howard

But the statement was completely irrelevant with what I said and not even the topic I was talking about. So while sure, there is a difference, it has nothing to do what my comment and you did nothing to try and tie it together either.

You should be able to put money in the goal sink to earn points on a leaderboard.

Let me take a step back here and clarify I'm not shaming any addicts, it's a disease. If my comments made you think I was, I apologize for not communicating that clearly. 
---
Having said that, people who suffer from addiction can get addicted to literally anything. There is nothing physically addicting about osrs, and anything can be psychologically addicting because of the way your dopamine systems can be manipulated. 
---
Osrs isn't the problem, addiction is.

its against the rules to post garbage music here

If you just want to camp something for a while and don’t want to do slayer tasks, then camp twisted banshees in the Catacombs of Kourend. They drop Bstaves and noted essence which is super nice. You can also start stacking up totems and ancient shards.

Kinda sus 92 minute first cape. If you got it legit then gz!

For context, I also got Tangleroot at level 60 farming (sorry)

I feel like this just has to be you rushing the chest without Killing then. If not, you have my thoughts and prayers.

Nice mage defence bonus

bankstanding buyables are bad skills.

i would vote yes for runecrafting2 tho.

Just reclaimed my gear from Ilfeen and went to recharge it.

Even if i didn't have enough points (they required 20k) you can still see the item(s).

Chaotics were cool yes but they also wreck havoc on everything as they are more powerful stat wise than their current in game equivalents. And summoning would need major reworking before the familiars you actually use would be allowed into the game. Sorry I would vote no to unicorn and Pack Yack as well as war tortise, bunyip, terrorbird, and almost all of the titans in a heartbeat.
---
Imagine paying to watch watermelon crops
---
yes we have their models but their stats are severely nerfed from what the chaotic stats were
---
Max mage would slap d'hide + Dinhs.

In that case, I know you posted this as a semi-joke, but this is legit a speedrun strategy. It’s free damage, there’s no reason not to take it
---
dont do the quest, not worth it
---
83-99 was where the pain kicked in, even with weighed down 1 key with doors.
---
I wouldn't say it's completely irrelevant but there was no need to tie anything together because again it was simply a statement, not something to be argued or debated.
---
dont worry about that
---
Oh shit, was the first one not joking? It looks like it’s from an original Nintendo DS game about barbies or bratz or something.
---
LOL
---
What do you mean?
---
Oh really? Tell me how you enjoyed having to clear every single low level floor every fucking time just to be able to get exp in the higher floors, shit and flawed design, the dungeons where fun, going through all the low level ones was not fun at all and ruined dungeoneering big time
---
Definitely should have started the title with the words "Unpopular Opinion"
---
OG dungeoneering but with each floor type spread across various locations on the world map
---
On the real, going to dungeoneering the very first time when it was released was pretty magic
---
at least i have tendies
---
Should I try this and let you know prob gonna get on and do the quest soon
---
Real talk, is there any video proof of someone getting an onyx from MLM gem bag? Isn't it like 1 in 30 million drop?

Use windows mouskeys to bind your mouse click to ‘5’ on the number pad. Then you can switch hands, switch fingers whatever you need.

I do a lot better when I find a world with a smaller group. Takes longer to kill but consistently getting good drops.

Hows about you suck my cock for 2 hours lavine, if you're not too busy posting cat girls to twitter?

Is it ballsy or just stupid?

Yeah same
---
i agree. there are a lot of ignorant people on here.
---
I heard some people are using tick manipulation to get better loot
---
All the npcs would randomly reaggro to the barricade, sometimes immediately after shooting them with bp. That part seemed so scuffed in my opinion. I think good rng got me through the 3rd time
---
When I first saw the Hunter skill I thought it was a pet skill
---
yes if you give noobs too much
---
Further devaluing actual skilling, nice.
---
What diary are you going for? I aimed for quests to get 47 thieving for Kandarin medium, if you're talking higher levels I got no better advice than anyone

Okay well I'll let her know shes wrong. Maybe then she can get into a doctor.

It's for mining rocks and mining the boss. Smelting and rcing are both already 1 tick actions

Each key costs a crystal key + 10 shards

Thank you for your loss 😂

Thank you, Swampman good Rc bad
---
I would vote for it as a skill, not as a mini game

Don't know, maybe I was lucky. Iirc the aggro was mostly on me after hitting them, rarely went back to the barricade

There's a guy there that sells bolt racks, the eastern samurai guy.

Swampman good
---
Yes. Less than 5k/hr
---
Maybe don't binge train a video game skill if it literally hurts your body
---
That wasn't an average that's what I got. I got a crystal armour seed from gauntlet which is a unique (2m) and I got a crystal tool seed at zalcano which is a unique (8.8m) overall zalcano is probably 2-3x better gp/hr.
---
Maybe she will get less taxes out of her check too once I tell her! Thanks for the help. My sister will appreciate it!
---
Take a better look at the picture bro
---
&gt;Tob is 8m/hr, CoX is just behind that at around 6-7m/hr
---
only if you grind it for hundreds of hours
---
Charge the scythe it looks better
---
He was probably doing it to test to see if it would do it, this likely wasn’t an accident. Doesn’t mean that you should keep bugs in a game just because it’s unlikely someone will run into it.

group ironman won't affect an account that isn't part of it at all, a skill will directly affect your account? why are you being dumb?
---
People really need to learn that the constitution protects you from the government. Private companies can do whatever the fuck they want.
---
And that's the Kilian experience
---
I trust the current development team and their direction they have planned for the game. I like that they poll major changes. I think you need to take a deep breathe and step away from your online gaming for a moment if you are this upset. 
---
They have made numerous other changes, some they mention in patch notes, others that they don’t, without polling them. This change isn’t ground breaking or game breaking. It’s also not a breach of the communities trust. They made a quality of life change and they are not required to poll this first.
---
Ill upload the history
---
No, Ry from WUPHF!
---
No it isnt how its been forever, its how its been for a lot of older content.  It doesn't protect you 100% at corp, not does it protect you 100% at raids or other content that has been in the game for a few years now.  The trend for new endgame content lately has been that prayer will not protect you from 100% of the damage, you must be new to endgame content
---
Surely you’re not that dumb. 
---
Why would you think ‘oh, the guy hating on rank chasing probably loves the OG tank chaser’
---
Nobody forces them to fall tho... You can easily grind out agility to a level where you almost never fall before doing the quest.
---
Doing the quest with only 60 agi SHOULD make you fall often that's the point
---
That's something that I'd really like to know. Sometimes I'll do tons of damage (blue circles and a few hits on mining her when weak) and get a double drop worth 300-400k. I could also repeat such actions and get 25k loot. Seems reasonably random but hopefully I'm wrong.
---
Him getting a level he says he’s going after isn’t a spoiler lol. This is like when people got mad because people were saying he wasn’t uploading until he got a whip....which he himself said’
---
I see. How many people do you do it with?
---
I’m wondering like if the loot is 50k/kill on average which isn’t crazy, is that still the case for large worlds with like 20 people 
---
Cause then that 50k becomes 1m per kill
---
Wasnt saying it shouldnt be fixed either, just questioning the oringal reasoning or intent
---
/r/outofcontext
---
Then... Just fuck off? Like why bother commenting. Lol tf go back to three tick mining.
---
Is that 5k of each/hr? If that's 5k rc xp/hr, I'd be doing it for profit + passive rc xp. I'm curious
---
i was at 160 chests with only 3 items. by 200 kc i had 7. granted 3 were spears....
---
is there a drama calendar from last year?
---
&gt; The reason that more experienced players are against warding is because they are more experienced and know more about the game, its history, and what's healthy for it.
---
If this was true then Warding would have passed. All of my maxed clanmates who voted no seemed to do so either because they didn't want to max again (because the max cape is just too overpowered to lose even temporarily, not because of the gp or time spent to get 99 warding) or because they viewed the skill as 'boring' despite 90% of the skills in OSRS being repetitive snooze-fests as it is. 
---
They were acutely aware of how much good the item sinks would have done, or filling in the gaps in the mage armour table, or making splashing a thematically fitting activity etc. In my opinion I view it as a lot of maxed players voting selfishly (which they're allowed to do, don't get me wrong) vs voting for the health or integrity of the game itself. It's sad to see, but it is what it is.
---
Your dumbass raged and went to the sand casino. GG bud

if he decides to leave and become a normal account why does that affect ironman mode?

There is no way to drag it "back" to osrs because it never existed on osrs.

Cannoning drags can be profitable? Thought cballs were expensive. Damn, TIL.

---
I guess I must have imagined all the other quality of life polls if they don't need to poll those changes.
---
It doesn't matter if its a small change or not. They poll retarded shit like removing the green pixel from the construction icon.
---
Not only was it unpolled, similar changes not only failed a poll, but caused a backlash on reddit where people were saying it's a bad idea. They just ignored all of this and did it anyway. 
---
You can keep belittling people for caring about this, but the fact is it's a clear step away from how they release content.

you uhh

you're special

Fairly sure you can attempt and fail to seduce her in biohazard. So they might be refering to the crush our player character has.

I remember when I first got members one of the first towns I stumbled upon had the flax picking.

It was more money than I ever made in f2p - I think I spent my first week as a member doing nothing but picking flax and making BS.

I started a hcim earlier and thought I would start cutting some trees behind lumbridge castle. Went to the toilet quickly and a lvl 6 mugger had me down to 3hp.

---
Waze. You're welcome
---
I mean, prif is still empty on osrs world map too
---
Yeah but it's not about the items. It's more about the fact that hey knew that dungeoneering was a completely different skill compared to any other existing skill at that time and I believe they had to overcompensate with best in slot rewards. Because if you take away all the benefits from dungeoneering, the skill itself was really just a minigame, considering that you couldn't use any items from your bank. And honestly those skilling and challenge rooms were about as fun as doing regular mining, fishing or any other skill.
---
It literally is pre eoc though it removes abilities and all that nonsense.
---
&gt;I think.
---
I'd actually support a Pet Cosmetic shop update.

20 is the highest I've seen so far, but it's pretty consistently hitting through prayer. So you're gonna be eating a lot...

I mean it was good as a skill but with how nitpicking people are there is no way to get a skill to ever pass in this game. Just due to the long list of reasons why people voted no some being small reasons
---
taking no damage would make it much, much to easy. 90% of my damage comes from his hits. too many people would rush T1-2 weapons, then kill him without food or armor if you could block all damage
---
A skill can't be dead on arrival, it's a skill. You have to do it to keep your max cape.

Yes you do
---
You can tick manipulatie the boss like you would mine granite
---
That is actually an awesome idea that I would support 100%. A good gold sink with some fun cosmetics
---
What's sad is that I didn't even see that.
---
I think the idea is to make important/unique characters stand out a bit more. Giving Elena a unique chathead is better than the default Woman chathead. It's just the current one we have is bug-eyed and gross looking.
---
Cause capitalism
---
Well, I've searched reddit for the all "loot from x Zalcano kills" and done some basic stuff on it. Basically, there is a large variance in GP per hour and it is heavily correlated with how many ashes your loot tracker is showing. But there are also times when you get 100k+ without an ash drop so that muddles it a bit.
---
Also it seems like crystal drops are set and don't depend on anything else, just on getting the kill.
---
I think the armor already does that. I'm at like 50 kc so far and from numerous trial and errors I would say T2 max hit through prayer is around 15, t1 it's like 19, and like you said t3 is flatout impossible to get.
---
They really need to look at t3 armor/armor in general. It's extremely underwhelming and not worth going for.

OP is just salty since a lvl 2 rabbit pwned him. Git gud scrub.
---
People are saying "high tier content for high tier players" even though the only reason this quest is defense locked is for the steel armour you have to wear.. 5 def requirement hardly qualifies as high tier.

That's a fair point.

Inferno you can block everything with prayers. Gauntlet you cannot. Gauntlet also has too much rng to be consistent unlike other forms of pvm... this boss really isn’t hard, it’s pinned to be unfair for the player (Especially hardcore iron men)

They completely changed it to just be offensive ranged armour instead of defensive melee armour... Kinda dumb considering the tank armour would've been great for inferno on my ironmeme

then watch monty python...?

wow they made extremely frustrating mechanics less so, you might aswell quit the game now mtx are right around the corner slippery slope

Wintertodt is like 300k an hour or so an hour versus 2m/hr
---
Just an FYI you now don't need to imbues it in nmz, it always has the imbue now
---
Lmao, first it's tripwire fail rates, next it will be MTX. Jagex is well aware of the shit show adding MTX with no poll would result in, these are far from equivalent.
---
Why lie about this? Makes no sense
---
Now this, gave me a good laugh.
---
That's just not true. Skiller isn't a term that only means level 3 skillers, it also includes people who prefer skilling to pvming even if they have combat stats. You just have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Man shut up it's a game; bet you don't even vote in presidential elections.

Not a fan of the circles spawning underneath you but other than that its a super fun game.

thanks bro, ill probably try push it to 85 or something
---
they didnt remove it, because it was never there on the skill sprite. it was a glitch and working on something else fixed the glitch so the green pixel was gone. they then went and deliberately drew a green pixel on the skillicon after people's complaints.

This response doesn't make sense in regards to his comment

its not what it used to be but theres something

and for sure alot more action that rs3

---
Yes it passed by 88%. Better to check the poll history in game as they dont give % to skip like the site does.
---
i mean it's not like they had a choice. Based on the 1/5967597 chance to pass MEP handholds and the 30 seconds between attempts, it's been taking the average player 5 years, 245 days, 18 hours, 17 minutes and 30 seconds (rounded to the nearest attempt).
---
Wololo
---
Bunch of astrosurfers out in force tonight too, it seems.
---
85 with a ranged pot will make it a lot easier. I did it myself with 87-88 range with a range pot. Good luck mate! The dragons you have to fight will also be easier with higher range. There are metal dragons, but you really only have to kill a steel and mith. The adamant and rune dragons you can safespot, just check a slayermusiq1 video.

but which way do you rotate it?

But what if there’s a real drop party? You’d miss out

Literally 2/3 of my stuff i've gotten from her won't sell, keep lowering prices but nothing
---
Oh no, they made a change to their own game.
---
I get where you are coming from. If that really bothers you, then don't play. I'm all in for stuff like this coming through. I'd prefer it be noted in patch notes. But hey I only read the bits that interest me anyway so I likely missed it.
---
They just released some amazing game content and you're here nitpicking away like a entitled child having a tantrum over getting the wrong car for their 16th birthday.
---
Cut them some slack yeah?
---
True, but I was talking about actual dunging. I wouldn’t consider smuggling items out to be actual dunging.
---
And look and them downvoting you. These players will kill the game again.

Almost impossible? I have 70 agility and am still failing checks. Am I just a poor bastard
---
If you've done Zalcano, can you post your gp/hr rate?  I'm particularly interested if you have under 90 mining.  
---
At 70 mining, I'm pretty dead set at 250k-300k/hour.  Swapping the rune pick for a dragon pick appeared to do little for the value of the drops.
---
Magic logs have always been within a few hundred gp of 1k. The price is tied to alch value. There's literally no reason for anyone to ever spend more than 1500 for a magic log. 
---
The osrs wiki has the upper limit of magic logs per hour at 130. Let's be extremely generous and call that 150. To get your proposed rate of 400k gp/hour, the price would have to be 2700gp per log. It doesn't matter how few logs are in the game, the only reason people buy them is to alch them for 1500 gp so nobody will pay that.
---
Your post is objectively wrong and fueled by pure nostalgia. Cutting magic logs is likely more profitable now than it ever was back then because of the existence of the woodcutting guild. The only difference is now we have more gear to buy than a whip and barrows armor.

With 89 range, 93 hp, 92 str, and 85 def and attack, do you think I can solo each of the bosses?
---
My cc says zammy will give me the most trouble, and that I should be careful trying to solo. Opinions?
---
This is a problem from the very beginning as they implemented this feature. On the tech side the game basicly logs you out and in again automaticly which will let the "login-attempt-counter" increase by one for each hop. Thats basicly the same as mistyping your password or username/email. 
---
They spoke a few times about that, but i think they never really said something about fixing it.
---

I agree with the point that the elf should be moved to the well, making life easier.

The irony here is that the comment you're replying to, is in fact, sarcasm.

A good method is to lurk in the ironman cc and just snipe them from ironmen

Got mine chopping oaks at 31 getting Animal magnetism quest req lmao

It's safe to say they're aware.  The also presumably are collecting data on every run and will be able to use that to help tune it.

I'm going to have to agree with you on this one
---
I miss OG Nomad so bad.
---
Didn’t blur out your stats or user, heh thx for the items
---
Problem is, getting good odds on an agility obstacle is already possible, it's the reward from agility. Giving people the rewards from something without having to do the activity is just ezscape. Don't want to fail the handholds? Train agility. Want to be able to skip the underground pass? Do Regicide. Etc
---
Lmfao this is so Jagex. “You can retrieve your items from the Underground Pass.” like way to be specific 😂😂 I swear they always find a way.
---
Damn bro haven’t u seen hcim but pvps narrows luck??
---
The rats deserve some kudos too.
---
What was the unicorn special? Was it a heal?
---
Nope 😅
---
I know right, sometimes I even hear people splashing in the washroom stalls
---
I know I could close the chat box, but I still wish Jagex would do something about the gigantic toggle to bring up the keyboard...

you're just mad that you could never compete
---
yeah lol
---
showed me his kc too, he was at 140 i think but said he got it at 85...
---
That isn't possible for something as simple as flax picking. Its easy to detect, but you can't just ban them on sight. If you ban them on sight then bot writters have a HUGE advantage over Jagex's bot detection. 
---
Think of it like pesticides or antibiotics. Use them too much and you risk more and more immune offspring popping up. In this case Jagex banning botters on sight would result in them getting a better understanding of why they got banned and how to avoid it.

Zalcano seems pretty good. It’s good money too

Why do people always bring up Artisan like it's the savior of OSRS and the one skill that could be added? It polled 56%. It's just a *bad* skill.     
---
Even Sailing only beat Warding by about 1%.
---
Feel bad for Ash.  He's gonna get a bunch of salty tweets as his reward for being open and communicative.

I'm not sure how many people agree but dungeoneering might be my favorite skill in RS3, and I'd love it in OSRS

dead content on arrival

Meh models sucked but the quest was good

They nerfed underground pass?

Check out what I got from 100 kills today lol [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cimzfa/to\_the\_people\_doing\_zalcano\_i\_think\_i\_used\_all/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cimzfa/to_the_people_doing_zalcano_i_think_i_used_all/)

Farming is profitable all the way up pretty much

If you are low level start right frickin now
---
Hello i am interested where do i sign?
---
because he probably offered to teleport you to the boss and this guy doesnt want to point it out because it specifically detroys his whole post and he just needs to rant
---
What if a person has the opinion that gravity isn't real and if they drop something it won't fall down? You can show them their opinion isn't accurate. If they decide to keep it in after seeing proof I'd say that is a bad / stupid opinion.
---
yeah. i dont recall  them ever being much more than that even before 2008 and pre-GE either. maybe 1.5k ea absolute tops. its only the players and their mindset that has really changed. i made my first mil from doing soft clays and killing hill giants and the first ~5-10m fishing lobsters and cutting yews. it was a different time.
---
I have an alt that i flip feathers on. Not bad when you only remember to check on it every 10 days
---
Its alive enough that you still need to pay attention when you go into wildy
---
Damn, calling out toxic cunts draws even more of them to the post.
---
Imagine going out of your way to fuck with other people in 2015+4 tbh. Sad times.
---
No, thank god. As many times as I had to attempt killing Seren, if I had repeatedly failed the trip wires and UGP obstacles I’d have quit trying far before I killed her.
---
song of the elves just came out get the requirements for that
---
Pee afraid, pee very afraid.
---
Lol wat, you are the minority here, bud.
---
literally no one said that
---
Plus he has tons of supply drops on top of all that.
---
I've got a macroing major ban that was only 2 day ban.
---
Waited 1 year and got the same exact offense and 2 day ban.
---
Third time's a charm tho, permanent.
---
Fun fact. No one on either game wants to spell out the full name so everyone just says Prif or Priff.
---
You can get it back from ilfeen
---
If they find out, I won't worry, i'll pee happy.
---
It's OK, they call themselves skillets because they're bad at the rest of the game
---
Chill
---
Pretty sure ur nmz points get reimbursed and you just have to go back and imbue it again
---
It's a sandbox mmo.. do whatever you want to do for fun.
---
I did UP on a 36 Agility account with summer pies today and it seemed close to the 60% success rate it was supposed to have
---
Yea I think mostly blue with like red accents on the horns and other pointy bits would be sick.
---
Making a quest "difficult" or very lengthy just by throwing layers of stupid RNG at people is terrible design, imo. 
---
There's a wide range of ways to make quests more difficult, acceptably annoying/tedious or longer without making it entirely not fun and a chore.
---
Assuming 3gp is still the price of flax(last time I played) and you have 28 inventory spots open, that’s a whopping 84gp per bank trip. Let’s get this cheddar, fellas
---
-$11
---
To be fair they put the npc at the exact spot that you go to enter the fight. So you have to run by it at some point anyways. They should probably have had a warning about it being a dangerous area or something but this is pretty similar to most death mechanics with things. Happened a bunch on release of gargoyle boss where ppl would die and run back without slay helm only to die trying to get past the Abby spectres.
---
🤢
---
Pretty similar to my stats, I have 80def 82range and 82hp, completed DS2 a couple days ago. Used Bastion pots, Ruby Dragon Bolt (e) until third phase and swapped to Diamond Bolt (e) to finish him off. Only died once due to being careless, second attempt I focused more and it was no problem.
---
i was going to punch you for this,  but instead im going to be a MAN about it and go talk shit about you  to Courtney and Michelle behind you back
---
Also using chins, he can fully focus on pray switching
---
You're saying a small change to 1 cancer quest makes QPC meaningless?
---
How did this change make One Small Favor, MM1 and 2, DT, etc not awful
---
"his accunt"
---
Yes, yes he is.
---
Yeah but nobody goes "nice fletching skillcape", buyables/easy pets existing don't take away from your grinded achievements. Good luck for your rift guardian!
---
Red panda themed raccoon. Boom fixed.
---
Most people who are complaining are also mad about the reqs, final fight of the quest, etc. they just want to be mad.
---
Who designed this? Same person who did the elf redesigns?
---
I’ll confirm zalcano, she shits out shards just as much as 15k drops.
---
That’s a terrible reward. I’d rather get some RC exp tbh.
---
Very worrying for the future of the game
---
Whats Lleyta
---
All reworked models, helm = tyras helm, body = easter event body, legs = 3rd age chainskirt
---
Red pandas are closer to raccoons than giant pandas I believe.
---
Do slayer and make some gp on the way
---
thats what threw me
---
Might be speculation about how many will come into the game now from chest and zalcano. Usually it seems like drops on release are super high because everyone farms the content so prices tend to drop a bit and the correct later when the hype slows down and drop rates are figured out.
---
Could also be like giant seaweed where it just counts for more when you spin it.
---
i dropped down the agility shortcut so i didnt get chance to run past the elf if i did i would have seen him and been fine -
---
If you're talking about your total kc pet is 1/4000
---
just thought it was a cool account is all
---
That sucks. Sorry bud hope you get some good rng to make up fornit
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment
---
Its not your game, be grateful they ask us for our opinions AT ALL!
---
That’s what she said!
---
Thats not the truth dude. I literally read it the day warding failed. You’re taking my words as whatever the hell you want. You’re being absurd flat out calling me a liar over something that I saw and read with my own eyes. 
---
Get over it man, the skill failed and won’t be added.
---
You'll fail the tripwires with 99 agility though
---
And then they danced some more.  
---
They danced away to the tune they loved.  
---
Until their shoes were wet with blood.  
---
Their arms were tired and their feet were raw.  
---
Their smiles had faded to a gaping maw.  
---
The music had slowed as the flute collapsed.  
---
Ian cried as the lute's fingers were scraps.  
---
Left to the crows, there was no more crew.  
---
And so came the end. Of Sea Shanty 2.
---
There's a fishing pet but you can pay noobs to throw darts at you to 2tick smh buyable pet
---
Shut up
---
You say that but all the underground pass ones failed
---
honestly this is beautiful. I truly hope you both are happy and scaping for the rest of your lives together &lt;3
---
120 kc isn’t dry friend
---
Your prediction is wrong. Cutting magic logs is slow and they would never go above 1200 gp even if they were removed from drop tables because then alching longbows would be a loss.
---
Not yet
---
Anyone upset about an agility obstacle that can require literally dozens of attempts to get past being fixed to not be that punishing seriously needs to get their head checked.
---
Wtf
---
I sat at school making lists of all the items I wanted and I would calculate how many yews I needed to chop and fletch, along with bow strings and nats to alch and get the money for them.
---
Yeah because randomly losing 70+ hours worth of work is definitely the epitome of difficulty.
---
Keep flexing your 15 iq braindead

2004 my buddy and I would chop the Willow trees in Lumbridge all day after school and sell the logs to the general store. It’s how I bought my first set of adamant. Good old days, I still have that account too.
---
Is there an official mass world? Or just world hop till I find a shit load of people?
---
Has anybody gotten his hands on a blade of saeldor already?
---
That's a long sentence.
---
How much? What does it do
---
Actually that's a video game raccoon
---
Honestly he’s pretty ballsy to try out the new content out. I would’ve chicken out tbh.
---
🦀$11🦀 or else
---
Except you do take abuse of the system via integrity changes and will continue to.  What is and not worth an integrity change is up to Jagex and something they have to figure out.  But the poll system has some serious shortcomings and Jagex has and will circumvent it.  If your opinion of the team is so low you think MTX is around the corner, idk what you're doing here man.  
---
If Jagex really can't be trusted, and something this minor gets you wound up then you should be able to see the writing on the wall and know it'll keep happening.  Personally, I don't like getting stressed about my hobbies and only invest hobby time in what gives me enjoyment, not what gets me wound up.
---
Okay I'm home and all setlled from work and errands...
---
If you're around let me know! If not it's all cool imma ding tonight anyways haha it's been eating me having it sit there so close!
---
Because if you spent that much time getting so much gp/resources from a legitamite source then you should already have a pet. Not to mention thatd be way too hard to balance since buyables vary way too much in xp rates and i would be pissed if some credit card warriors were getting their pets in 15 hours while other pets take hundreds and theyd devalue having a pet at all.
---
Must resist looking

Ok

stupid lucky
---
Thats the dumbest thing I have read in a while. So i guess its unfair that a Rich player can buy better gear too for bosses?
---
Base 80's was one of my favorite goals way back when... You could try that. Maybe go for the quest cape if you don't have it yet. After that lumbridge elite diary, one of the best in terms of rewards (no dramen/lunar staffs for fairy rings and the ring is super helpful during burst tasks)
---
Congrats! Are you guys gonna produce any little Runecrafting slaves soon?
---
Long term goal mory hard then go back to barrows for 100 chests
---
You just don't understand. Without repeatedly failing that one obstacle in MEp2 for 20 minutes straight, the entire game is worthless. I know I just don't feel satisfied unless I fail the stick traps at least 15 times with 70 Agility while doing certain treasure clue stages.
---
/s
---
The blade is not dead content. It's still the best slash weapon in the game. Once the prices settle down it will probably be cheaper than the rapier since it degrades
---
I saw a 98 combat in priff
---
He’s beautiful
---
Nerves of steel, man. *Nerves of steel.*
---
Hey man, well written with an alternate view point than I've heard about UP than in the past.
---
UP is a hellhole and also a monument of runescape, much like Draynor village it should be considered a historic site and protected for the future to enjoy (or not enjoy)
---
I second sarachnis u can buy its weapon too to make killing it more effective(it has high defense but weak against crush) at 800k-1m as it is designed for med level players.
---
Because he has a tbow on an Ironman, and you’ve never even had one on your main
---
Elon couldn't have done this. He just makes cars and rockets
---
'Selling 1k flax for gmaul'
---
Yea befor eit reaches Zalcano, you get hefty amount of that good good blue stuff. Also I think it helps getting better rewards, can't confirm that thouqh.
---
Considering the costs, you use around 2-4 broad bolts + 3-5 cannon balls each kill around 75 range, you profit around ~3k per kill. Thats pretty damn good for such a low lvl monster with no reqs.
---
Wait what quest changes did they make
---
I wish people would stop bringing up Integrity Changes to arguments about this change when it's clear that this has nothing to do with Game Integrity. Integrity changes (other than Vorkath) have always been nerfs that bring overpowered content in line with the rest of the content in the game or make the content less abusable by bots.
---
How did you get so many crystal shards so fast?
---
Ooohh, that explains the ashes lol. I feel am bit dim.
---
Only managed two ashes in 100kc, lol.
---
shitting is exp waste idiot. l2p the game
---
Get off this sub weeb
---
This tool voted no to warding so he wouldnt have to max his ultimate iron  again
---
Epitome of this toxic community. Idk what he was thinking
---
Lmao dude I went through your post history and you're legit one of those people that comment under porn subreddits and bash the girls yikes
---
How much are the crystal seeds worth at the minute?
---
I'm especially curious about the teleport seed and the amour seed, but also the tool seeds and the weapon seeds.
---
Also, where do the weapon seeds come from naturally now, aside from buying a fully charged weapon?
---
AFAIK no one play tested the corrupted version/even knew it existed
---
Is this the two guys?
---
I can agree with doing the optimal quest guide - so much content is locked behind quest completion that it is somewhat of a necessity to get some of them done. That being said, it's all down to how you pace yourself with it. Don't force yourself to grind out certain skills that you don't enjoy just to complete a quest, or you'll likely find yourself clicking through the thing as quickly as possible and skipping dialogues just to get it over with.
---
In regards to skilling; some people really enjoy it, others don't. My best advice here is to find a skill you really enjoy and emphasise training that. When you start getting bored, switch to something else, and so on. You'll be levelling way slower than if you were to go all 'efficiencyscape' but you'll definitely be having more fun.
---
The mother elf in the middle of Lletya, you save her two kids from the fire during song of the elves can't remember her name
---
+22 for jagex
---
Every update? what about the game integrity updates? Such as making hand in the sand to be required to buy runes from rune shop in magic guild?
---
Yeah that’s bullshit
---
I have no idea how phases and duplicated maps work, but while the disciples were missing, the stage for the mime event was still there.
---
Can you explain the significance of the 72k quest points OP? Just curious
---
&gt; The mep2 handholds and ugp gaps are infamous for their high fail rates and for the fact that failing those adds a lot of time to the quest.
---
Oh no watch out, they removed the bullshit rng that added like 1,5h or something to a one-time activity. Everybody's gonna get bloody get 4,6b xp by tomorrow now!
---
Grow the fuck up. I'd understand the crying if they literally like buffed the xp rates of some skill by 10% or whatever, but this literally does fucking nothing but make the game more enjoyable by removing the lottery-factor from the elf area.
---
Too add to this, and for simplicity the douhble L in lletya is common in Welsh and is (roughly) a CL sound as in clap so it's actually clet-ya
---
Please think before you interact with me.
---
&gt; I don't, rs3 already exists.
---
That doesnt stop you from wanting 2x RS3 tho. I can read.
---
&gt; Making the game easier dooesn't make it worse.
---
Yes it does. The game should be harder, not easier. Thats the whole premise of the game.
---
Yeah, like, how is not having a tbow not a bannable offence? Just buy one or two lol
---
On corrupted if you have max tier gear and do everything perfectly you can still die due to the boss hitting through prayer and hits not being good enough.
---
Dragon Slayer 2 is easily my favourite quest. I didn't really hate any part of it. MM2 was ruined by the giant sorc garden imo.
---
Then Elf Song is borderline everything unpleasant about quests taken to the extreme. Insanely large light puzzle, lots of backtracking/filler, excessive repetition, a random ass clue scroll part, traversing the elf area just like... in general., a final boss that has an undodgeable ability that does 98% of your max HP, and a shoehorned character death at the end.
---
This is why you always take a 1 click teleport when doing anything new.
---
No, I mean 99 str. Can you read?
---
Most of the afk maxers/casuals caught up hence the like 5k in the last 2 yrs
---
Then get a higher agility level Jfc that's the point
---
Rotate so your compass is facing the same way he is I believe.
---
Jesus. Chill the fuck out man.
---
Good point and that just creates another one for me that I should've added.
---
 Twitter/reddit/twitch is a HORRIBLE avenue for content feedback. It should all be done through ingame poll because it doesn't consult the masses, just the active on social media few.
---
I definitely should've mentioned how insane it is that such an extreme change to an iconic part of osrs was unpolled and Jagex refuses to even poll rechanges.
---
I think it has to do with some limitation on attackable creatures or something. You can probably find the exact answer if you look around.
---
Hmm, maybe I'm just mis-remembering then, I could have sworn that they cost more.. guess it could just be because I was younger and even 2m seemed daunting lol
---
that looks exactly like what i remember it looking like after the initial big graphic update.. i swear they're fucking mocking us at this point lmao
---
I'd love to have a pint with mod Ash. He seems like a chill dude.
---
Damn thanks for letting us know. Sucks so bad I feel you I hope you get your items back.
---
Getting past an agility obstacle has never made me feel better about the reward I get afterwards, it makes me glad I'm finally done with that shit... until the next quest makes me do it again. The fact that you suffered through bullshit and don't want to make it less bullshit for the people after you doesn't mean you're upholding a standard. It means you're an asshole.
---
I can't speak to why Jagex did what they did.  My intent was to point out these things have happened before and will happen again.  There is plenty of precedent for bypassing the polls
---
  Everyone can interpret it how they will.
---
&gt; NOBODY likes dealing with that fucking bullshit, there's literally not a single person that enjoys tedious, anti fun game mechanics like that which were changed.
---
... No one enjoys 500 hour grinds either but it's the prestige of knowing you dealt with cancer
---
Threaten me daddy 😳
---
I bought mine lol also recolored 4x.. rip
---
Double L is the weird one with the sort of hissing noise from the side of the tongue isn't it, rather than a hard C?
---
Dude you compared this to real life elections, and new players to children. That analogy only works if all children made the conscience decision to be born, and agreed to pay a monthly fee for being alive. Kinda ridiculous. Also what if a piece of content being polled is low level, and geared towards newer players. They just have to hope every high level player is completely unbiased with their best interests in mind? Fuck that.
---
Also I think 1750 is really insanely high as a req for voting, plenty of long time players don't have the time or desire to get a total level that high. That doesn't mean they shouldn't get a say.
---
be happy lil settled
---
The fact it drops things that weren't polled. The boss fight is boring and not how I like boss fights. It is also different from the rest of runescape so it doesn't fit the style.
---
Look previous ideas for bosses were good, however this implementation is just terrible. I liked the ideas brought up for previous bosses but this is just not the way it should be.
---
I don't know what your damn requirements are, but you've used the term "real RuneScaper" several times without elaborating and like you have any authority on the matter.
---
Yes, that's normal.  NPC shops increase and decrease the prices on items as the stock decrease and increase respectively.
---
Damn you came through on the burner to back up Main.
---
Tight.
---
You can say the same about any boss that hits through prayer. 15 or so corrupted kc and I’m yet to walk into the boss properly prepared and died due to anything other than screwing up the mechanics.
---
thats very true lmao, did he tele there and bank it?
---
No other quest nearly requires you to have higher stats then the quest requires in order to save an hour so it's clearly not the point. 70 agility was considered high when the quest came out
---
Yes its called economics, less supply and more demand meand higher prices. Osrs has an economy
---
You people act as though this is a bad thing? 'Cause it's not -_-
---
Bunyip was that and raw fish eating
---
Yak would bank what it is carry with the scroll
---
Titans 80+ dealt too much dmg and tanked way to much
---
I was taking a break from osrs so I never did. Took forever when I came back to finally get 72
---
The only "exaggerating babies" are the one's complaining that the change was made to begin with, when it's a positive. If it's such a nonissue to you, then why are you even against it? "Nonissue" (as you put it), sensible changes don't need to be polled.
---
And your whole last paragraph is just your opinion, again. And I think it's funny that you make a comment about my mentality about the game, when in reality your static, inflexible "keep the game the way it is even if it's flawed" mentality is the real issue with OSRS. It's what will prevent us from ever getting a new skill. THAT'S pathetic.
---
They still poisoned me like 3 times during the quest and I’m 99 agility lol
---
They arnt fake i just got my double xp code!   (GF234232Account129842) 
---
NVM the code deleted my bank and changed my password.   ill get back to you to let you know if i still get double XP though.  ill go punch some cows and see
---
huh so your telling me even though i added him hes not my friend, almost like it requires consent like some sort of a request or invite or something. i wonder if theres an colloquial expression, slang, or vernacular sort of term to describe such a concept.
---
It's doable relatively consistently pretty much the second you can use blowpipe. However, you also have to absorb the cost of learning him which if you're bad is a solid 3-5 hours of just deaths.
---
Sup Benton County Arkansas gonna scam you IRL now.
---
imagine thinking ur calling out all the spooky strawmen all the while chucking strawmen of your own the whole time
---
Wiki says it's literally just cosmetic rune armour
---
Ah fair enough, I assumed stores would have set prices. Best get to mining and chopping some trees I suppose lol
---
This ain’t it.
---
Do I get my badge now?
---
It wont be fast at low levels because you wont hit hard or alot.  Cannon is the best for your level till 75 for the blowpipe, just wear your most accurate gear and your cannon will hit more often. Tbh i cannoned to like 85 then chinned to 99 lol  but nmz is a great way to afk it once you get the blowpipe.
---
Why does my brain immediately go "North patch is West duh. pfft this dumbass"
---
Although you can spin flax into bowstrings for crafting xp, actually just picking the flax and selling it will yield no xp in any skill. 
---
The only other cases of this I can think of are things like picking up the rune spawns in the wildy or the plank spawns by the barb agility course
---
I dont think anyone here knows about the one in lettya lol
---
Get the dwarf cannon. I mainly train range with that
---
Did it cost $11?
---
The quickest range exp I can think of is 'Chinning' in the monkey madness dungeons.  Potential to multiple opponents with one ammo, potential for lots of exp.  
---
  
---
Might be faster, buts that's the fastest I can think of.
---
Anguish + void would help a lot
---
Jed saying Elysian like a hungry wolf. He knows what it is.
---
Douchbag.
---
I dont think it is.
---
No worries! Normally I'd recommend only using burst to heal and iban/trident for damage when full, but I did it at 99 hp and would basically have to blood barrage the whole way to be full by the time the next special attack came around. Not sure if it's easier when you have lower hp.
---
But yeah, probably burst all the way to be safe, and make sure to overbrew/eat an angular when you're going to take the attack. Then just heal back up to full during the other phases
---
... Okay?
---
Are you saying it's a shame bots that were picking flax should've been getting minor farming xp?
---
&gt; Jagex refuses to even poll rechanges.
---
You mean like how they put out a post next day mentioning plans to poll some of it?
---
Also, while in-game polls may reach more players, they cause a lot of problems with feedback. Artists can't exactly wait a week to see if a design needs tweaking; then another week to see if the new design is better. Also, a poll can't give good feedback; for example, where would the poll option be for "lower the ranged strength by 7 and it should be good"? Then there is the issue of polling too much; there have been complaints about this in the past when we had polls for a few weeks in a row.
---
Also, the high-level veterans you think should have more of a say are fairly prominent on social platforms. Though I do agree they could have done more opinion polls for the direct of stuff like the new elf graphics.

I’ve played this game for years now and I’ve don’t think I’ve ever seen an amulet of fury not hug the 3m line
---
At least you got one claw already 😔
---
I’m not the guy you responded to initially, I was just explaining what he meant.
---
Why? The premise of the game is to be fun. You aren't even a real runescaper because you don't click on your pickaxe and then click on the ore vein every single time you want to attempt to mine. You aren't a real scaper because you aren't maxing out at 1500 xp/h. Go back to club penguin you 3 year old. Thats the same argument you are making but from a different perspective, and it makes no fucking sense.
---
Yeah kinda sad. A lot must be entering the game now.
---
&gt; Or we disliked having to spend time finding groups, discovering the people in those groups were stupid, then have to find another, etc etc.
---
I was able to key sub 20min and consistently stay under 25min with a group of randoms on the official dungeoneering world. 
---
And I'm not very fond of group activities at all. I've never joined a clan and never wanted to. 
---
Basically, I looked at my teammates as pawns, I mark a GD and drop the gatestone and often my team will clear it pretty fast. Most times my team had a couple decent players (they can clear a puzzle room by themselves and gate key doors on their own), but there were times where 4 teammates were all idiots which sucks but not very common. 
---
In a sense, you can train dungeoneering "solo" with a team if you were good enough, which it doesn't seem like you were.
---
At lease you got one claw already 😔
---
I have one on my hardcore while soloing raids but ok
---
&gt; Dude you compared this to real life elections, and new players to children. That analogy only works if all children made the conscience decision to be born, and agreed to pay a monthly fee for being alive
---
what was wrong with my analogy? just because a player pays a sub fee doesn't mean they should be able to vote in the context of my idea. Sub 500 total level members can't vote. 
---
&gt;what if a piece of content being polled is low level, and geared towards newer players
---
new low level content passes ALL the time and is loved by high level players because it is easy to farm and introduces new pets. Hell F2P got voted in by a much smaller community than we have now and that is the quintessential low level experience.

---
&gt;Also I think 1750 is really insanely high as a req for voting, plenty of long time players don't have the time or desire to get a total level that high. That doesn't mean they shouldn't get a say.
---
Then we fundamentally disagree. 1750 isn't insanely high and the grind is akin to a typical osrs high level grind. If you aren't willing to dedicate the time to a simple grind, then why should you be able to vote on content that REQUIRES the same grind? 
---
Some people's opinion is worth more than others, that's true in every facet of life.
