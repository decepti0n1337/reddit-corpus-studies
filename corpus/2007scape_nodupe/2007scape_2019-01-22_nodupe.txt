im playing oldschool runescape not a private server/rs3

---
---
It's a toss up.
---

---
Tome i think costs more to cast than flames, but both are good options.
---
You could always just say fuck it and splash to fire surge.
---
73
---
The shields are on a separate drop table chance from the other drops as well as themselves. Also,  got the dragon hide and bones, but my client hides them. Sorry for the confusion.

Alora RoldSchoolPuneScape?

---
Just an expression. I did not purchase a ticket.
---
Think about it this way:
---
making hundreds of posts saying "wow I like this game, good job Jagex" isn't particularly constructive or helpful. We already tell Jagex we like the game with our 11+ dollars per month.
---
On the other hand, making a post about what needs to be fixed or adjusted *is* constructive. The Old School team is *very* small for a game this popular, so having the community be so involved is actually helpful. Jmods have said so countless times.
---
We're passionate about this game and we want it to be the best it can be for years and years to come.
---
Brilliant. Now do one of sandwich lady.
---
Bro beans
---
It would take away the classic feel of the game and also make it very difficult for anyone to figure out what kind of gear the opponent would be using in pvp. That is why I am against it
---
The shields drop separately to the other drops.
---
So get 75 attack? Do I quest it or actually train it? What strength? I don‚Äôt want any strength levels correct? 
---
Why is it nsfw lol
---
r/tipofmypenis

First off thank you for pointing out that you can retrieve an extra anti-dragon shield I forgot about that and hence the reason for this post, which was to learn more. I will say though that saying I can 100% avoid the wildy is false. There are slayer tasks that require you to go there and if you're low enough level or have few enough points you can't avoid these.
---
I'm not an overly generous player but I do help people out if I happen to be good on gp or if I feel like they'll use it better. If they're at the GE on a populated world they're soft begging 90% of the time, not directly asking but making it known they want free stuff.
---
Odds are though anything he says would be wasted on her to begin with
---
This a joke?
---
Dyes are the thing that would break the classic feel not everything since 2013
---
As I am killing Vorkath currently these numbers are not consistent. (Try it yourself on OSbuddy if you like). Not sure why the numbers aren't streamline. 
---
Rune bolts (unf) tanked after Konar drop table release, could be a factor
---
Just get a job and get membership
---
The thing is, I‚Äôm trying to see this from Jagex‚Äôs perspective. Is an ‚Äúalive and healthy‚Äù game one that preserves the same level of challenge, or one that has more players? Because the way I see it, the older players are leaving one by one. As a company, they can‚Äôt sustain themselves off of one customer base that isn‚Äôt growing. If you really love this game and want to continue enjoying it, wouldn‚Äôt you want to support changes that keep new players coming in? If they run out of money, we have no game. 
---
No new players = no servers. 
---
Chocolate???!! CHOCOLATTTTEEEEE!!!!!!!
---
This is unacceptable, someone help this man out.
---
This devalues my colorblind ironman D:
---
Whats his crafting lvl?
---
Improved Account security would be the first thing on my list.
---
Any advice on killing Killerwatts? I feel like fighting one is hard enough and I don't wanna skip the task or make a million trips.
---
&gt; It is also an objective fact that some users would be able to make their relatively weak passwords significantly stronger if they were allowed to use special characters and case sensitive characters
---
Then your password is currently shitty. As I said, a smokescreen for dumb fucks. Continue to live in your ignorance. 
---
Hey man, Lova gave us the amazing elite clue step to hand in a box of armor
---
Good bot
---
Neat.
---
You know that doing a regular task doesn‚Äôt remove your wilderness slayer task streak right? They are completely separate lol
---
But mining and runecrafting are fun ü§î
---
I hope you step on a Lego.
---
tldr its a pretty typical "pretend to recruit someone to anti lure/lure with me"
---
Lova = Lovakengj
---
Lol. Pkers are toxic for pking in the wilderness? Out of all the things in the game you chose to complain about this?
---
For Section 12, does it only apply to actions that occur in Jagex's games, or does it also apply to actions outside of their games, like if a player stole something or got a speeding ticket?
---
Do other games have legal conditions like this?
---
Yes, any slayer master won't assign something you can't reasonably do.
---
And that‚Äôs perfectly okay. You can continue to use the weaker and less fun client and I haven‚Äôt a care in the world. 
---
Good luck my friendk!
---
‚ÄúWhy would you want to raise your cholesterol?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I can lower it.‚Äù

damn

Prepping? Abusing an outdated mechanic..
---
Corp should reset 100% when no-one is in there.
---
:D
---
Was that not the case?
---
No but i appriciate the effect 
---
Idk how long you‚Äôve played for but a lot of people are overly passionate about updates in particular because we watched our favorite game get beaten into the ground by Jagex 10 years ago and haven‚Äôt forgotten about it. I would be really upset if that happened again.
---
It‚Äôs cool, twisted bow is SO oldschool.
---
?
---
Stick to a mix of defense and str gear. Torso + barrows legs for instance is good. Don't waste pray pots when you can eat cheap fish.
---
Was a different era back then. Would be fine now with the quality of skill now a days. 
---
Run into dusk and dawn, die, tele with slayer ring, pick up logs, tele to bank and repeat 
---
Where do I see this blog post?
---
Let me introduce you to the world of videos of top 100 ehp players rambling for 20 odd minutes in a monotone voice about what skills they'll do next and why the updates to the game sucks.
---
No /s btw, b0aty formula progress videos are so bad that this is actually more enjoyable.
---
EET FUK
---
Barrows tabs are nice.
---
Ensouled heads are a waste of time IMO as long as the wildy altar stays OP.
---
I just starting doing kourend favour and I have zero desire to get them all to 100%.  Rather just get shazyien for lizardmen tasks (I wouldn't if I was a main) arceus for barrows tabs (again I wouldn't if I was a main) and hosidious for all the OPness.
---
I completely agree with you. What I‚Äôm trying to get at, however, is that I see backlash to every change/update on this subreddit that is homogeneously negative. I don‚Äôt see this as constructive. I see it as general distaste towards any sort of change, yet the poll system is still bringing these updates into the game. 75% of the players enjoying new content, but I don‚Äôt see them here. 
---
Read the description. I didn't say all were, only the types I listed. The point of this post is a discussion to see if there is something about those groups that I am missing/not understanding. 
---
Yes you get duplicates
---
tried but u can‚Äôt alch trash :‚ÄôC
---
Well you see the difficulty with postmodern account values is that it doesn't function on a basis of reality, they only see the social context of your total level and cash stack.  And to have a civilized society we can't treat people as a number; it's absolutely abzurd
---
I don‚Äôt either. And I hate to be this cynical but this has got me thinking, does Jagex or some Jagex employees get kickbacks from certain hijackers? Think about it, if they implement an authenticator delay, that would have a huge impact on the amount of RWT in the game. When a person hijacks an account, they immediately sell off all the gold to gold selling sites who in turn sell it back to players. 
---
Given the track record of Jagex in the recent past, I wouldn‚Äôt be very surprised if some segment or individual of the team is preventing an authenticator delay from being implemented because if that happens, they‚Äôd no longer get a percentage of what is stolen and sold to gold websites.
---
I hope to God that this isn‚Äôt the case and I have no evidence to support it other than: why in the ever loving hell haven‚Äôt you done more to help secure accounts for your player base.
---
The reversion was provided in good faith by one of our administrators citing that the information came from an RS3 exclusive event. In the future, add an imgur link to the edit description to an edit you're unsure of. In the mean time I've reverted it back.
---
Defence bonus is important but there‚Äôs a balance. I recommend using a max hit calculator and finding out at what strength bonus you‚Äôll get a max hit. The increased max hits work out to you getting hit less. A fighter torso or bandos chest plate and a berserker helmet for give almost as much strength bonus as a fury for example.
---
Haha thanks bro. I was being cheeky. Lova doesnt exist. It's dead content.
---
Gz on 57 farming. Gz on insane rng that is making a lot of people very upset.
---
While I admit that getting new players is a good thing, I don't care about net growth (and actually see it as generally a bad thing). If the game has to become worse in my eyes to get popular, then it's slowly dying anyway, and in a way that I can't combat by throwing more money at it. 
---
terrible. like 5k an hour
---
Dang you're right! Crap. Best content
---
Idk ask Google they don't have one 
---
I‚Äôm listening...
---
Keep that dumb shit in RS3.
---
Petrol enema, friendly guys Donnie in most times of the day cause we have people from Australia Canada USA and europe

Theres a bunch of ways to make 60k super quick like picking white berries, gathering mort Myers fungi.  Get a d scim with that money and some monkfish and camp gargoyles for an hour.  Now you will have about 500k and can probably get gear for raids (use void) you could do zulrah, I'm sure you could still get like 1m/hr at vorkath with 500k of gear
---
Only 50m that's garbage. You can make like 50m a day begging if you know how to do it right
---
The vast majority don‚Äôt pray flick or even care enough to consider it. Bandos is priced due to being BIS, not because it‚Äôs worth the price for the average player. 
---
For 600k you can buy Torags plate/legs (for 20k prosylyte) 
---
Do the sums.
---
Nobody liked that.
---
Imagine having to pray mage lmao
---
Yee haw 
---
My bad! :D
---
Yee haw

Was it in w362 by any chance? Was standing there a while ago and some dude was planting a lot of flowers
---
Dubl d stop plz
---
No worries. 
---
I really hope Jagex can do something to get this and other's like it taken off YouTube.
---
This was on a Torvesta video, but I'm sure they show up on other 07 videos as well.
---
I accidentally typed my password in game the other day and I didn't even get hacked. There is 0 reason anyone should be able to guess your login name in this day and age. 
---
ughh these posts are getting old. Probably because you browse 2007scape reddit and watch B0aty on youtube. 
---
If you get bored of fishing you could work on quests or swap to another resource gathering skill and do that until your brain hurts. 
---
Farm runs litterally take no time. I never knew anything about farming &amp; I still barely know anything. (I'm 88 farming tho.) Just do the easy/cheap fruit tree runs. If you do these once a day, you'll have 75 farming in a month, maybe even quicker cus you can do almost 2 runs/day. (I'm doing 6 fruit tree patches, farming guild one included) It will become sort of a daily task, which is really helpful in the long run &amp; doesn't take any afford at all.
---
Too fucking right, I swear somtimes I brought 20 too many sharks, other times I'm like wtf a full inventory isn't even enough and don't get me started on their weird ass aggro ranges.
---
Don't have the level to help, but you could try the Reddit clan chat in game as well.
---
Not everything has to be polled. Void nerf was necessary for the integrity of the game as it was just way over the fucking top powerful. Duel arena tax was also good money sink, which I and many other big time stakers didn't mind. 
---
My optometrist said I had a problem with Blues &amp; Greens but it wasn't enough to be a problem. I thought that was it.

Where are those
---
Thanks! 
---
I mean, some people just don‚Äôt care about those extra features. For example, I use my phone for Reddit and sometimes osrs mobile. That‚Äôs it. I rarely text or make calls, I don‚Äôt really use apps, I rarely use the camera. Am I missing out on some things by keeping my phone from 6 years ago, absolutely. Do I care, not one bit. Same goes for some people with OSbuddy.
---
The happy cartoon characters are inviting. Seems legit. 
---
More incentive to actually do well, implying harsher punishments if they fuck up.
---
You are over encumbered.

Hold E on item so you can drag it with you.

I missed the past DMM tourney, how bad did they lose this time?
---
Also apparently they still "own" the high total world Wilderness spots like Rev Caves.
---
Couldn't you have waited for your buy limits to expire and bought at market price? You wouldn't have used them all before your next batch was ready would you?

You want to southwall trick her. YouTube it, but basically one guy takes while other stands 3 squares from corner. Tanker hits Sara runs to corner. Guy standing hits sara and runs to opposite corner along south wall. When she reaggros to other guy he runs back to corner and other starts hitting as Sara zig zags back and east to west on south wall. 
---
I am happy that at least *one* person agrees with me, out of the thousands. Thank you. I can let this thread die now.
---
It's good if you're trying to grind it out quickly. Best xp is going to be from doing tree runs, but that's pricier and you're limited by the growth time. You'd hit 70 in a couple weeks from ~10min/day though.
---
Increasing their wage would not change their work load.  Hiring additional members could fill out missing areas but paying people more wont do it!

Tower of life has like 10 spawns just west of it. Bring fire strikes and you can get a lot of mage exp

\[Here\]([https://imgur.com/a/FyQHj35](https://imgur.com/a/FyQHj35)) is what I PKd from one of your clue scroll brethren who "risked nothing". I don't know what's in your inventory until it's on the ground.
---
I get it. still unrealistically frustrating
---
Tithe farm is not exactly an efficient method for training farming. At your level your xp rates are going to be very low so you will need to spend over 15 hours there at the very least to get the 700k experience you need.
---
[See this post for xp rates.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/7a7png/what_are_the_lower_xp_rates_for_tithe_farm/)

I would definitely not recommend it. Trees and fruit trees are the way to go.

Ouch. Well baby steps Jagex it was sort of overdue.
---
Spawns are scattered around the main area and respective general encampments... I'd consider skipping that tasks as it'd take a long time maybe. 
---
How about the 99% of other people who arent
---
No one is paying attention to names of who they‚Äôre killing, when I used to PK I wouldn‚Äôt even usually read them let alone remember them. Also, PKing usually isn‚Äôt about what you get or profiting or being efficient. Sometimes it‚Äôs just fun to kill people on a game for no reason and that enough is a reason. 
---
By your logic we don‚Äôt need rune items drop on any drop table either because I‚Äôm maxed.
---
OP is retarded

See you on tomorrow.

I'm glad i dont watch streams.

Alright thanks, what is god protection? Do i need a specific one for the zamorak area? thanks
---
Y fletch
---
no
---
correct
---
Yes, like i said it's fine if you want to argue the ability to trim it as long as you have done at least the quest or diaries already, but the ability to combine the affect through the music cape makes no sense. 99 runecrafting cape is harder to obtain than other capes so by that logic it should be able to hold the abilities of other capes?
---
Best story ever

im a bit jealous i did 175 runs over 3 days last week... my loot was good but not this good. 
---
alright i was thinking about it, im skiping this thanks
---
it reminded him of a stacy that rejected his incel self i guess
---
Gzzz. i should be getting my untrimmed by the end of the month. Hit 98 yesterday. 
---
Choosing to trim that one cape and not the others is the dumbest crap I've ever heard lol.
---
While a delay would be nice, 30 days is just plain retarded. Imagine breaking your phone and being locked out of rs for a whole month.
---
Really? 
---
the cape can already be trimmed but you NEED THE ACHIEVEMENT CAPE AND QUEST CAPE TO DO SO ALREADY. what i am purposing is the cape to have those added benefits to it. and no, 99 rc is easier to get. do you even have your diaries done? it takes forever! 
---
rest in peace, trappdaddy &lt;3
---
No... You get hunter exp from birdhouses.

I live in a country without a dedicated server and thus experience minor delays (a high ping). This is especially frustrating when I'm competing for resources or when I'm in close combat. I heard of this program called Battleping and being the cautious, rule abiding player that I am, I just wanted to ask if the use of these programs that help lower ping for online games are allowed on Runescape. Thanks in advance!
---
u can trim it already but you need achievement cape and quest cape to do so before you can. so what i am purposing is the benefits of QC and AC to be added to the music cape (t) since you cant have music cape (t) without the other 2 capes. 
---
This video cured my mesopotamia.
---
This looks to be worded badly, i think it's trying to say the egg laying timer matches the timer for getting poisoned. Don't they already lay eggs poisoned?
---
Wearing god related items will make sure they‚Äôre all not aggressive towards you. For example zamorak you only need to protect from him if you‚Äôre in his area, so wear something like an unholy blessing in the ammo slot etc. You can find more examples here in the god related protection section. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/God_Wars_Dungeon

To be fair here, I make 11/hr after taxes. Many people don't have the $11 to dispatch to Jagex for entertainment.

600k!

only place where its actually decent is in cm raids
---
I feel ya. I gave it a couple tries at my 85 cb stats but then decided against it as the dps was not getting me there. So I decided against my 99 Smithing goal and am now grinding out cb to try again.

They‚Äôre awesome. Hard to crease toes+look great. Only time I wont wear them is with chinos as leathers look much better

It's legal in many places

Damn, that bottom picture looks like the eternal struggle in Africa. Who will infect who first, the mosquito is packing Malaria, the man is packing AIDS. The fight is on!

Dude you can just fucking plant shit and wait 90 min to get 100k just like that

Not exactly a stupid suggestion since getting back to abby specs takes literally 15 seconds.

Wondering what combat stats are recommended for them. My stats are currently: 82 ATT, 88 STR, 82 DEF, and 81 Range.
---
Now now now... wait a minute. This man is correct . It's like should stupid people vote. I demand a poll to remove polling 
---
You only drop the clue in below level 20 Wiley. Above level 20 wildy you will lose your clue scroll. 
---
A way to protect your clue scroll is something called a clue box which when in 20+ wildy you lose your clue box instead of your scroll.
---
Im not sure exactly. From what I can gather its really fucking expensive as a hobby. Raw colored glass rods are expensive and then you need torches/ventilation/tools. 
---
I've been doing this for a good while with monk robes and a crier bell. Good to see more people join.
---
I appreciate that this is hand drawn
---
I should have used poisoned bronze arrows :P
---
Wonder if they used an NPC to hotfix it.
---
they must soak a lot of heat when its sunny though. black shoes arent the best choice of colour/shade.
---
Why be me human we can be live in scaperune
---
So it's still a visual change like I said
---
Cool I‚Äôll give it a try. Putting off getting barrows gloves cuz I hate questing and just did lunar diplomacy REEE
---
Plz poll bludgeon redesign 
---
Dont you want the devs to bring Old School Runescape HD?
---
You're 100% right on both parts. It's not a huge deal but it really should be fixed.

Laughing out loud

My suggestion is for it to unlock 2x max volume so you can blast sea shanty 2

You have to spend in game cash to not get hacked?

I will get to it, dad. Plz be proud of me.

Fuck u noob
---
There‚Äôs also much less lag the further from ge you get tbh 
---
Cant afford tassets. Next best step?
---
How do you find it within Runelite?
---
Dragon only requires 60 attack.
---
I suggest making a main so you can do all the pvm for money without worrying about levels.
---
As for making a pk acc, it‚Äôs pretty fast if you have some money to work with.
---
Just do vamp slay, waterfall and dwarf cannon on a new acc.
---
Then cannon to get like 65 range, and get 62 str and 40 attack.
---
Don‚Äôt get any prayer levels yet.
---
Then you can practice poking in f2p where you risk chump change.
---
Once you are good at that, you can get 50 attack and become a gmaul pure which are super op.
---
Is it a waste of time to shadow/smoke burst dust devils at 66 magic? Should I spend a few hours alching to 70 or just go ahead and do the task?
---
Obsidian legs if they raise your max hit. If not then dragon or torag legs.
---
Thanks. Sorry for redundancy, helm suggestions?

is it too much? Too soon? Should I delete it?

I actually know him lol, he was in osrs advice w314. we've bossed a few times too :) good guy shwoop
---
I wouldn‚Äôt if you plan on grinding Vorkath for a while. You‚Äôll get around 60-70k range xp per hour at Vorkath so if you‚Äôre gonna be there for a while you may as well just level up there instead of spending a bunch on chins. Your kills will be plenty fast at 92 range with DHCB and rigour. 
---
konar she gives bomb head kappa
---
I switched to Konar for some more variety, 20 points per task from the elite diary is a nice bonus too. 
---
We also know what time you‚Äôre gonna be home and going to bed too. Nice.
---
This is a management problem. They obviously prioritize releasing updates quickly over releasing quality updates.

that question is so they can get data on how many of the new accs are returning players and how many are active/new players. as for making everyone complete tut island its a antibot thing. bot detection rates are high on tut island.

Looked on main page no post any new update either.

Last I remember there was a post asking what the community thought, said they weren't doing any unique, and said they liked some guy's drop table.
---
They could of done some hot fixes?
---
Link plz?
---
Duradel, I only touch Konar on the 10th task and that‚Äôs still a rarity given how many points I waste to get a decent task from her. New drop table isn‚Äôt worth the inconvenience of assigned slayer locations. 
---
I‚Äôm 58 with full graceful and run out of energy all the time

I didn‚Äôt know you could use skill to influence which random integer rolls for the stacked AGS+Gmaul special attacks

did u turn your eyes off and turn them on again to fix it

The only one with an ancient staff is the one that doesnt have a glory of any mage gear lol.

Definitely rot.

I hope to be as good as you one day :/

More discussion is being put into the games mechanics itself than how great and funny this picture is.

U mean slayer right?
---
If you‚Äôre poor and like doing slayer then yes

It‚Äôs a pretty low effort task so I do them, but probably block if you use konar and don‚Äôt want these, as they are weighted at 10.

Unfortunately slayer level does not matter in terms of boss difficulty it seems. I don't think everything needs to be strong though. Thermy drops occult (more commonly) and smoke battle staff. It has a couple uniques and I think that's fine.

Shes always been this way when you get the baguette

30 minute raids? Try half that time now. With the advent of prescouting and prep/dps alts, you can easily get sub 20 minute raids constantly with mininal downtimw

I personally loved nex obviously the drops would need to be different but he was a fun boss to kill with a group of friends

It already works that way.

I don't know, if you're the kind of person who can, for example, grind a skill to 99 you could probanly put that determination into good use, and might learn something from him.

Yeah uhh....unless you for sure know this, probably not cool to say that.

Not every boss should be 3m+/hr. Its fine for how easy and little effort it is.

I only do Konar every 10th task for the point boost tbh not worth it otherwise

I even got him his fcape back in oct 2017. Learned about his passing via FB. Came to reddit to see this later in the night. Seriously thank you all. He will be missed

Actual community? Nice No true Scotsman fallacy. Reddit is just as much the 'actual' community as the silent majority who don't use reddit/twitter/whatever. Difference being that the players who voice their opinions on this subreddit, and other social media, actually care enough to actually interact with and give feedback to jagex. You can't fault them for actually doing so and you can't fault jagex for actually listening.
---
Many people in this thread are also failing to realize that if Jagex polled the weapon and it failed, they wouldn't have the opportunity to poll the weapon in the future. At least now they can reserve the idea for a future update. It's actually in both sides their interests that jagex did this move.
---
Don't blame the sub for doing what it's made for. Also I bet people like you wouldn't be so butthurt of this subreddit if it was your opinion that was being adhered to.
---
Not sure 40-50 seconds is just a few lol

Hey im new, why is it bad?

there once was man from...

I'm not gonna make fun of ya for watching a phish stream cuz being proud of posting this warning has greater value for us

gz on thr snapdragon seed
---
Nah man, don't say that. Take the time to learn how to use the authenticator, it's worth it.
---
Authenticator apps are more secure than SMS.
---
The reason why people get hacked through their email is because their email account was never secured in the first place. You should protect BOTH your account AND your email.
---
Both Gmail and Outlook support authenticator apps, so look into that.
---
Once you have your authenticator on both your RS account and email, you'll be more secured.
---
Good luck! :)

---
Nice man! That‚Äôs a dope pet. 
---
they can dig all they want and find old passwords, old emails, old users, it would be a nightmare to actually attempt each different possibility that im sure that if someone tries to get into anything that I own it will only leave them with a headache and the only time loss I would suffer is picking up my phone and tapping a few times to just reach the jolly conclusion that someone somewhere tried to pull a fast one and failed.
---
Just because your believe something different than what I believe doesnt make your opinion valid and mine invalid.
---
It has nothing to do with an "understanding of the internet". You're talking about people who watch streams. Not "the internet".
---
I'm pretty sure no reasonable person will watch one asshole and decide all active players are just like that one asshole, and therefore avoid playing a game. 
---
My opinion is simply that Jagex shouldnt worry about stuff that happens outside of their game. This is an issue for Twitch to worry about. Not Jagex
---
Damn I miss those days ;(
---
Except it is just a game.
---
Fishing is awesome, and you can make pretty decent money with it. Especially if you are a member. When you get high enough to unlock minnow fishing it is like a fun little mini game, if that's what you enjoy keep at it until you get a 99. Or stop before that and try something else if that's what you want to do.
---
people used to have it harder back in the day with no auto-clue solvers and sht, I'm ok with leaving this level of "difficulty" in
---
Never thought Id see that place
---
Later virgins
---
its a good last hit before u lure it to the next vent due to attack speed you don't lose too much ground either
---
While I don't enjoy it, I respect you RS3 vets for keeping it afloat so OSRS doesn't get raped with MTX. Thank you for your service
---
What about drop trading items for my main to sell? Or does that not work the same way as gold dropping does
---
Im 99 so i approve of this
---
I'm not one to shit on artists, but the fact that mediocre artists get insane recognition for drawing borderline hentai just rubs me the wrong way. I wish we had more stuff like this

seconds saved are worth quiet a bit.

The game should just block the account once it detects its logging in somewhere else. Have had the same discussion wirt Ubisoft, when my account got stolen. I logged in from Turkey, Ukraine and Russia within an hour. Clearly compromised doesnt it? Block it, send a message via authenticator or email. 
---
Q
---
Looks like they're supposed to talk in a cc to maybe seem more like real players
---
How does the venom kill the minions? Do u have to attack each of the minions when the fight starts
---
don't feel bad I am pretty sure im well off =) if warding passes ill have probably multiple max cash stacks
---
are there really people out there that could pick out each herb simply based on shade of green? Seems like pointless update to me.

Use Jagex's official support pages, not reddit for this.

Every time I see a harrlander I automatically think it looks valuable. Quickly realize it ain‚Äôt.

Pleasant finding a GD reference in here. Love is real

He was just an amazing guy.

He will be very missed in the RuneScape and pin community.

This guy asked the real question.
---
If I wasn‚Äôt broke I‚Äôd give you gold 
---
My condolences. How did he pass away?
---
Pretty good idea, just give it the same requirements as bare hand catching implings.
---
A delay on the removal of your authenticator, so if someone gets access to your account and can't break through it there is enough time to resolve it with Jagex before you lose your stuff (usually it's 7 days). Currently, if they have enough information they can get the authenticator removed in a matter of minutes, making it way easier to lose your stuff. The only reason they won't add a delay is "to give people quicker access to their account if they lose their phone or something". Which is most likely a cover up for their parent company not wanting to expend the resources for it, that's my best guess. Either that or they're completely fucking retarded because 2 step authentication without a removal delay is beyond a joke.
---
‚ÄúYou do realize that not everyone feels like sitting down and playing a click based java games for hours on end every day.‚Äù This is very true. For those who haven‚Äôt played. But you‚Äôre 3 accounts deep, with each dedicated to something different. The first step in addiction is accepting. You‚Äôre just like us

Reported acc sharing

How does it not devalue anything? It completely kills off any str training weapon below 70. Abyssal dagger/ blessed sara sword/bludgeon all become useless for str training.
---
nice I just finished it today as well 75 def 87 ranged wasn't that hard overestimated it
---
Is that a book showing collections? 
---
Poisoned Karambwans instead of cooked Karambwans...
---
you say this but I just checked and S O N is still streaming like 4 years after getting banned on twitch. 
---
So does osrs my dude.
---
Authenticator removal delay would be pretty pointless then, especially if its someone who doesnt check their email often. Checking your email is more annoying than a simple message that you can just close. 
---
Don‚Äôt use the controlled whip style. It would be more efficient to use ss
---
You dont need to seek validation from an osrs reddit post from people you dont know for an achievement nobody cares about.
---
You should be happy with yourself, and need no one else to think, you need to tell yourself  "Im worthy."
---
You were aleady worthy and are worthy now. 
---
DAMMIT YOU GOT ME WITH CLICK BAIT
---
Caught me
---
I played osrs from it's release date and thought I'd never go back to RS3, but switched to RS3 like 6 months ago because that's what all my friends play. Thought I'd go back and do zulrah for a couple hours to see if I could get pet (over 4k dry ;~;) and it was so weird to not be able to switch prayers or eat with a keybind... Switches were still on point but oml I almost failed kills because switching prayers and clicking food, even with f-keys, was such a hassle lol
---
Yes but to a significantly lesser degree. The true trim list for osrs is a lot smaller than rs3
---
Maybe add 10,000 charges to the bone whip, and it shouldn‚Äôt devalue anything too bad locked behind a slayer requirement 
---
Would be gangster to make a similar build - damn the viability.
---
Oh man higher force... I miss my old clan
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they went over why they couldn‚Äôt do something like this during a livestream. The teasing was there would need to be a lot of work recoloring every quantity of seeds, like when there‚Äôs just one seed or three and etc they‚Äôd have to recolor each all of those varying pile sizes for every seed.
---
I forget if they said they‚Äôd do it eventually or not but they did address it.
---
Military maybe?
---
RNG. :(
---
In OSRS if it worked exactly like in RS3 you would, yes. RS3's tools have no such boost attached.
---
It doesnt make sense to throw a random slayer requirement on an abyssal whip when the other two variants dont have one. Making another 10k charge whip feels very forced considering there already is one. Bone whip is not needed in this game, another use should be found for the tail. 
---
You could drop trade items of equivalent value, there isn't a difference between drop-trading gold or any other item. The only exceptions to this are items that cannot be dropped such as chinchompas.
---
OfFiCeR RiGhT HeRe!
---
Now days it‚Äôs no5hing buy ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.. ‚Äúyou do it again I run‚Äù ‚Äúsafer!‚Äù
---
Well, for example, they could ask you a really simple and innocent question, such as; "hey, my isp is so shit, been dcing like every day, i was thinking of switching providers, what do you use? Are you happy with their service?", Now, this is seemingly a completely normal question, nothing really too odd there, but if you start answering questions like that, they suddenly know which isp you are connected through, which is one of the questions you get while trying to recover your account.
---
I think you're all colour blind. We already have different colour variations on those seeds.
---
Did not know, still very expensive to use.
---
But only now you don‚Äôt have friends :(
---
Nice. i did it with 70 def 81 range and I agree 100%
---
Crafty bastards

Seconded

No. You could just camp range pray at Jad. It's easy enough as is.

No he is saying rs3 gp will be worth less so your swapped osrs gp will swap back for more rs3 gp if you swap it back

Inspired by this pixel art: [https://imgur.com/a/vqcvqln](https://imgur.com/a/vqcvqln) If anyone can find the original artist let me know.
---
I've never really done much with pixel work but I decided to try my hand at it. Let me know what you think and give some feedback so I can improve on it!
---
Pretty stupid tbh... In a game where they focus so much on account security, they can't even make passwords case sensitive?  
---
Seems like a small measure that would make a big difference
---
Ok

It would be nice for irons to not have to blow through your scales though

Bish I'm poor
---
Well, If you wanna be like that... neither of them are actually on the floor, but around the ankles.
---
at 50 construction you gain access to every house portal.  
---
This would cost about 1m GP based on whenever I last trained constrcution (read: a while ago)   
---
Generally speaking, Rimmington and Yanille are where the POH Parties are on 330 (access to other player's maxed houses for easy teleports and prayer training)  
---
There are some other minor benefits to the other Portal locations which I will list off the top of My head:  
---
Taverly: Some quests, Farm Patch...  
---
Pollnivneach: Thieving Training, Easy Carpet Access to Shantay's Pass (North) and Nardah (south), Smoke Dungeon, Kalphite Cave 
---
Kourend: I don't know how an impending update will affect this but currently my main use for this tele was easy access to Sand Crabs on my 1 defense pures. However, assuming you don't have xeric's amulet or any other teleports to Kourend this would be great for early access to the entire continent.  
---
Relleka: Easiest Access teleport to the entire area for a while, good for quests and clues. Eventually you will unlock other teleports (fairy ring, diary teleport) for late game vorkath etc.   
---
Yanille: Quests, NMZ - which has a minigame teleport already, that's about it really. 
---

Can iron men see items on the ground that they can't loot? I thought they just wouldn't be visible for them
---
and you got some barrows armor from it??
---
never would have guessed.

Because I think most peoples biggest complaint with RS3 is the MTX other stuff maybe but I'm pretty sure that's the universal #1.
---
The funniest is the people camping runecrafters going to mage of zammorok

The best they can hope for is an amulet of glory a black pick, and a bunch of 4gp pure ess.

Hi Marxx, it‚Äôs Tiki :)

Grats on the loot

Really? Wtf did they do
---
Right, so I think talking to yourself is actually very useful and helpful. If you are by yourself you can have a ‚Äòreal‚Äô conversation with yourself and learn from it, if you‚Äôre willing to take it seriously. You can ask yourself questions such as ‚Äòwhat is bothering me‚Äô and try to answer it  while keeping the satire to a minimum. 
---
It might take you 10 seconds, 5 minutes, or several hours of attempts to come to a satisfactory answer. Then it‚Äôs time to ask yourself if it really bothers you, why it bothers you, and what can be done about it.
---
For example:
---
What‚Äôs bothering me?
---
I don‚Äôt know how to fill my time.
---
Why does it bother me?
---
I feel empty and apathic.
---
What can I do?
---
Find something meaningful. Not something that is instant gratification like, I don‚Äôt know, eating cake. Find something that takes effort but is worth it.
---
How? Nothing is enjoyable to me.
---
Well, be honest. In the past couple of weeks, have you never enjoyed anything? Not one thing. And is there nothing you can think of? If that‚Äôs true then maybe medication is necessary; a psychiatrist is able to give you a better answer than me.
---
The benefit of writing is that as you reach the crux, the learning point of the conversation, you can write that down and greatly increase the chance of remembering it.
---
I have to dash off for now, we‚Äôll take more later.
---
Jesus. If you only mine iron ore it would take 20k ore wouldn‚Äôt it?
---
Or you know, use the leprechaun. 
---
Run energy was updated again about a year or two in RS3 to regenerate even faster. 
---
I was 20 minutes late to a date because I got 99 fishing... I should have saved it for after the date... I also should have lied about why I was late. 
---
Hey! I like abby dagger
---
The feel of the game is the same though. They added QoL while maintaining the integrity of oldschool
---
Double dweeb*

Who was he?

Oh he definitely is
---
First Snap I planted in farming guild, assuming it was disease-free, died. I was so bummed out. I understand the reasoning behind not wanting to make it disease-free, but thematically it makes no sense.
---
The names are chemical formulas 
---
Having a coin pouch on osrs could be fine if we lose it on death. Thought it was kinda dumb i could carry around 1b on rs3 without a care on the world
---
Why not I've an item that functions in a similar way to herb sacks and looting bags, in that you can dump tools in there to save space, but would have to take them out to use them. I would essentially like this for teleport and farming equipment. 
---
Now make it into a meth pipe and we got ourselves a winner 2277 total in no time
---
Wow I really didn‚Äôt know that half the strength of my password comes from the random assortment of caps and non caps, time to change it
---
Tip: drag the green phase onto the green vent between attack ticks. Buffing his attacks doesn't matter if you are able to pray correctly and it will speed up your kills because you can weaken the blue phase quicker, similar to what you did with the blue phase on the blue vent. good luck!
---
I'm aussie I just call it runescape like I did back in 2007
---
Master-
---
how did you get the gp for construction?
---
You don‚Äôt see the irony in that? If the argument is that the polling system is broken, what is the point of polling the fix...
---
Big oof
---
Swapped it from rs3, also some blue dragons and amylase crystals.
---
Not this again
---
memes 4head
---
They can't hack your email if you never registered one. 
---
Assuming you‚Äôre northern hemisphere it‚Äôs probably because seasonal affective disorder gives you symptoms of depression that runescape numbs/ exacerbates depending on who you ask 
---
he's retarded
---
Maybe make some RS comics, those tend to be a big a hit in the overall community and not many people doing it.  
---
Great work btw!
---
I'm jealous. I can't even get one pet and almost 4k. 
---
What is
---
Personally it's more realistic that you have to carry the tool that you need for the job. Money pouch makes more sense cause you can have a backpack and a wallet and they are not exactly the same. And no way to lodestones because that's just too ezscape. 
---
Did they take newspaper comic strips and just edit over it?
---
Fucking died of laughter when I saw Hitler.

Then died even more when I saw a aboriginal covered in ants! Lmfao

Dude, most cupboards are big. If you don't have a big cupboard, then you got scammed at whatever two-bit business you bought it from. My cupboard is massive because I buy quality products for quality prices.
---
Jesus fucking christ, does it ever make me angry just thinking about under-sized cupboards being sold by the thousands to clueless consumers such as yourself. Do yourself a favour and do some research on this stuff before you spend your money.
---
Me not knowing that.

Yes you see them

I tried serp for about 50 kills or so, used a lot of scales and lowered mage accuracy. and i  i can get 2 kills at least off of 1 anti venom.
---
Wtf is a toolbelt
---
Jagex can ban you for no reason. It's their game, they give you the right to play on it, you have no right to be allowed to play runscape. 
---
That this even needs explaining.
---
Adrenaline and testosterone 
---
That desk fan speaks to me on a personal level
---
I think everyone‚Äôs thought that it‚Äôs just kind of gone unspoken
---
And this ah yep guy also has the audacity to say he's only accepting donations of 100k and over lmao
---
Bonds don't transfer between the games.
---
used to walk around flexing in the bronze armour set i made, had a fat stack of 400 gp. Then this nice dude approached me and asked me to follow him for a cool surprise. I blatantly followed him into the wilderness (no ditch no warning no nothing just this weird skull popping up). "What's this skull here in the corner?"  "Oh. don't worry about it." A couple minutes later he brutally murders me and i lost all the hard work i put into my account. Cried for hours.
---
Best time ever.
---
UI QoL is not the same as game mechanics QoL. 
---
it doesn't work this way.  
---
Fair. I‚Äôve never used them, so I wouldn‚Äôt know.
---
I also assumed they were an account thing.
---
If you don‚Äôt mind, next time you go vorkath can you link me a screenshot of your inventory and gear? I‚Äôd love to see it. 
---
Yep, absolute peasant. Then in the next sentence of his macro script it says ‚ÄúI just need a little bit of money to buy addy armour or something‚Äù
---
What a joke.
---
If you hop all the worlds, you'll more than likely find a free spot for almost anything (except Shamans and maybe GWD). If for some reason every world is full in an activity, just find an alternative method to doing it or return later. I mean for example sand crabs aren't the only monsters in the game, you can go do NMZ, or rock crabs/experiments where you're guaranteed to find a spot. 
---
I think your idea would just kill the vibe of the game though and make it too singleplayer. 
---
ü§î but i dont feel that way ü§î
---
Lol that‚Äôs awesome. Boys and girls club is where I first played. Then they blocked it üòî
---
Thanks for the response. I'll sell the karils and just get god dhide then. I've been told void range is BIS with bp here so should I just finish up PC instead of doing that? Should I buy eternal boots or anguish? Or just save up for tormented bracelet?
---
I think super energies are pretty cheap right now.  Not the best xp/hr but decent enough for the money saved.
---
the Whip is basically a poor mans tentacle. Which I would welcome for the benefit of mid tier players. There‚Äôs too much hate on the bone whip, heck, there‚Äôs too much hate on anything new
---
Serp is only good if you want to learn zulrah, other than that it just eats scales and slows kills. Don't use it. 
---
This is why I don‚Äôt understand people who real world trade or buy bonds
---
I really don't see it
---
Devalues my colorblind only Ironman
---
get both zenytes before anything else. 
---
Armadyl is BIS, kinda forgot to mention that but I'll edit it in. I wouldn't worry about Void since it got nerfed.
---
I loved resting and bards, they are quite useless for endgame imo since we now have staminas. I loved sitting around chatting with people. Standing around feels odd
---
Honestly seems like someones attempt at holding cc's for ransom.. 
---
Fun idea, don‚Äôt like the power creep. I will vote no to anything over t75 weapon
---
Congrats to you on your pet! 
---
Nice
---
Well if you want a serious answer: I doubt the small percentage of ironmemes wearing a ring of wealth and the smaller percentage of mainmanmode who do so would have a big impact on the economy. Especially seeing as how you barely ever would be in a situation where the ring doesn't pick up coins cause you have a full inventory.
---
If you don't want a serious answer you're shit out of luck cause I don't waste my time talking to some iron noob nobody who can't even dks like lmao they're weird ass fish who learned to walk like how the fuck can you be afraid of them lmao spynolyps are more dangerous than the kings themselves lol noob
---
Jokes on you I got all my stats in rs2. I'm just too lazy to get max melle again
---
Is sceptre still not bis if you're scorpia pet hunting?
---
Yep. And sometimes he even shit talks you if you call him out. Imagine having nothing better to do with your time than beg for virtual money.
---
this shit just gave me nightmares thanks
---
Okay thanks for feedback! Saw some guy on twitch last night with like 33k kc he said void is bis. I have 99 range if that matters.
---

---
weird flex but ok
---
its worse when you get a +5 in all the other skills except the 1 you're trying to boost
---
You say rs, but it is my experience on reddit as a whole
---
do you loose all of your slayer points if you get a task from a different master?
---
Wtf, im terrified wasn't planning on gerting any sleep anyway
---
When I tried getting the new scrying thing in my poh it fell off 3 times before I could make it.
---
No
---
i got dragon knives on 17kc... 
---
Wanted to add a little tribute to the inspiration :) also I have one on my desk
---
:')
---
What do you mean by cheaper prayer method? Ensouled heads?
---
I just got it at 56 agility :). 
---
i think it would be a better idea to just add more spots/methods for problematic things like this. just making everything instances and killing the open world player interaction aspect would be pretty shitty. 
---
the world is dead empty in most places already because only a few select activities with limited space are actually worth doing.  spreading the activity in across multiple locations seems like would be a win/win solution to me.
---
if it even needs a solution, the whole thing seems kinda like a non-issue to me. most i have had to ever hop was probably like 20 times for a dust devil spot during slayer.
---
Wasnt trying to get you...?
---
Do you mean just re-animating any ensouled heads you find whilst doing slayer?
---
you do have invention perks for tools tho

I have 99 fucking farming and I still haven't got this stupid fucking tree fuck

if you ever take a fucking picture like this again
---
Wasnt trying to get you. You should just seek help for your problems.
---
Yup, ensoled heads are pretty good gp per xp. Also good easy xp for ironman/uim if doing slayer.
---
Honestly I think the toolbelt wasn't too bad. I don't think we should have it in osrs, but especially for things like questing it's just a pure qol thing.
---
I would prefer something like the dwarven multitool they made way back. Still makes it an inv slot, but it's just easier to take that one and be done with it. 
---

---
real LPT: to prevent self harm, whenever you get this step, drop the clue scroll
---
Spot on. Can buy from ge too, just figure out how much you're paying for the prayer xp and see if it's worth it for you. Mind include rune cost if you do though.
---
I guess spending tens of thousands of dollars isn't doing anything but sure.
---
"Fake news" lol. OSRS is only growing due too mobile, and I've seen many new to rs3 players. Because of osrs mobile players read about our mobile and come over in anticipation.
---
Even if rs3 Mobile is beta.

Yeah my man, i main her

whatever floats your boat

HAHAHAHA GET IT . . ..

RIP Trapple.. I didn‚Äôt know you long but you gave me a lot of great advice and helped so much. You were an amazing dude. I promise next time I‚Äôm online I‚Äôll do MM like you told me to do a million times. ‚ù§Ô∏è. -Loanful

LOL 
---
Restores give 1 more pray point per dose, and they're only 250 gp more than pray pots, always just buy restores instead of pray pots cause I'm lazy.
---
The tea is guthix rest and you use it to tick eat. The damage an attack does is calculated when it is fired, so if you eat something while a projectile is in the air (like for instance vork's magic attack) you'll only get hit for the hp you had before eating. Guthix rests heal 5 hp per sip, but they act like a potion, meaning you can keep attacking. What this basically means is if you're &lt;31 hp and vork fires a mage attack you drink the guthix rest, meaning you'll always be left with at least 5 hp and can still attack vork. You usually don't need it, as you can heal the damage done during attack phases when it does the spider attack (or the acid phase if you don't woox walk).
---
Are you of the retarded variety?

Lol, you doin okay there?

theres a prompt for dropping valuables that would prevent 30m from being on the ground in the first place

I feel like different designs for the herbs and seeds would differentiate them better but no one on osrs seems to like change so it's easier to leave things be.

Something "smart people" here think will protect their accounts.
---
* No other mainstream service provider delays 2FA removal
---
* You can't just instantly remove 2FA unless you have access to the email account RS is attached to (which for most people, should be a far bigger concern, and is preventable with 2FA on the email account)
---
* It doesn't fix the issue (the hijacker still has the info to potentially hijack the account, or to keep attempting it)
---
What's the fix? Currently, you can do a personal data update request and clean-up old information on your account (old information likely present in database breach dumps if your account is old enough). For currently-relevant information, you have a responsibility to not be posting it publicly.
---
Incorrect, the rate limit is only applied to successful login attempts.
---
I'd suggest making sure high alch warnings are on, it will bring up a warning everytime you try to drop something or alch something over what ever value you set it to.
---
I don't know if they could do a warning when you leave your house like that, or ever will but I know the source of the issue can be addressed. There are at least half the safety precautions 
---
Initially it seemed really good for the economy imo, it gave use to many "useless" items and made them worth getting as drops or collecting. The problem came later with summoning batch 2 when BoBs had doubled inventories and titans were introduced, beginning the era of endless boss farming compared to previous 5 bandos kills per trip or whatever
---
LMFAO

Fuck ironmemes

Picking up ashes sounds horrible. If there was a way around it sure.

At this resolution the line between pixel art and "MS Paint art" might become a bit blurry, I'd recommend working in a much lower resolution so you can really use the pixels to define the shape of what you're drawing, instead of having them be 'just lineart', if that makes sense?
---
Another thing is perspective, the piece you've linked here has an orthographic perspective, basically meaning 0 FOV. Notice how there is no curvature in any objects, they're all viewed from the same angle. Your piece seems to have more of a perspective nature to it, which can be hard to pull off correctly. (Notice how you took over the wheels of the chair from the D.Va piece, but because your drawing has a 3d perspective to it, it just looks like your chair is going to fall forward any second) Neither of the two are inherently a better solution, but they both come with a different approach.
---
I recently got into pixel art myself so I'm by no means a fountain of knowledge, but I'd recommend you check out this page, it has a bunch of different tutorials on perspective. (a link used to be here but my post got shadow deleted, so just google "lospec pixel art perspectives")

Better hope Jagex doesn't find out you're breaching their terms of service on Reddit, or you might end up with a mute/ban :&gt;
---
Anyways I realize there is very little progress to be made, you seem quite stuck in your way and in no way open for civil discord. 
---
Anyways although I don't think you are much better than the person the OP talked about (whatever his name is), I'm sorry for calling you a moron.

Have a nice day :)

Literally my best memories in runescape, W141 was the shit.

Can you allow us to kill Galvek to complete a Wyrm task (given by Duradel - because *Konar will always assign at Karuulm*)?
---
I just watched the video, what exactly is the method?, I use rock cakes, no overload (use super combat), absorption pots and dharoks, only needing to guzzel every 2 minutes. I normally achieve 70k xp/h and 200,000points P/h while afk
---
You try to pick it up and the game says you can't.
---
Or you just remember that it couldn't be your loot in the first place.
---
Jagex needs to enforce people to go through the Stronghold of Security, multiple times apparently lol
---
so by just typing my rs id and pass they can disconnect me from my internet? wow
---
Use the wildy altar unless you're a hcim. It's twice the xp per bone.

Pretty much any online game has communities. Having a community is a very "gamelike" quality.
---
Hey! Unexperienced rs player here playing IM. i've been playing on and off the last couple of months and wanted to say it's actually really cool to learn the game as a IM. The fact that i don't have experience with the GE makes it so much easier to not "compare" like most people start doing that have normal accounts and start playing IM. oh and if it really gets annoying later i can always deiron my account right? :)
---
I don't understand how to properly gear for barrows. The wiki guide is so confusing. It says you can wear melee gear because the barrows brothers have low magic defense, but it doesn't state anywhere exactly how low you can/should go on your magic bonus.
---
And I also don't see why you should wear melee gear if you will use protection prayers. Should I not use protection prayers and instead use food?
---
Then they suggest to use ranged against ahrim but shouldn't I simply come into +ranged gear then?
---
Could we claim a Herb Sack after completing a certain amount of Farming contracts for the Farming Guild? That'd be a great secondary way of obtaining it, just how the Rune pouch comes from two quite related sources.
---
Use the hilt on the truck and you can catch Mew
---
Why does that sock have a huge sole?

If you skull you can protect 1 item with the prayer. A good hint is to turn off the attack player option in the settings menu then you can never skull.

Okay thanks. One more question: Can you have both a krystalia task and another slayer master's task at the same time? Or only one task, no matter what master gave it to you?
---
You get the slayer helm bonus against all the monsters. 
---
You live in Leeds then?
---
Can somebody explain why this hasn‚Äôt already been implemented or the reasoning/response Jagex has to this?? Because I‚Äôm about ready for fally boys. 
---
Nice thanks

lol
---
Although the plugin was removed, it was disgusting that Developers blatantly code it into a 3PC and the amount of time it took jagex to instruct them for removal. 
---
In my opinion the hydra tail drop combining with a weapon does not make it bone-y to me. With the recent introduction of the bone whip/flail I remembered some other content that could be put to use for this. 
---
The unused Fossil Island "Rare Fossils"-boss. He could have a drop that, when combined with a whip could become a bone whip. Seems more logical than a hydra tail.
---
Alternatively, if a new boss isn't scheduled, introduce an npc that can use the rare fossils, for a chance at a new upgrade/ornament kit for the whip. (Maybe the Odd Old Man from Rag and Bone man, the items fit the personality) 
---
Great, now we just wait for the community to rant about aerial fishing being even slower than fishing trawler. Then they change the pearl drop rate to 1/30 and make it the new meta for angler outfit... 
---
Fix the fishing trawler minigame instead of this nonsense. 
---
They should also add Total level requirement for high level content, for example someone with 1 slayer shouldn‚Äôt be able to vote on the Hydra polls atm.
---
A minimum of 90% just be safe, dont want all these mobile bois running the game.
---
fuck that lol, i can still call them retards and whales even if they are paying for my game's servers
---
if a random guy on the internet calling them a retard stops them playing their shit game it's on them
---
100%
---
Bit of a crooked shaft
---
You can get it anytime after unlocking the tzhaar task.
---
Iirc, they're not going to be adding a bone whip and/or any other suggestions as making a weapon that would be a downgrade of the bludgeon for crush or a slight upgrade for the whip makes no sense toward the aspect of Sire and Kraken upgrades with Hydra being a higher slayer requirement.
---
Thanks been playing since around 05ish and this is the first time ive put any real effort into this skill and i get rewarded with 57 farming for my hard work! 
---
They did. However I probably see this getting hyped now, since they didn't mention it being slower in the poll, thus people will complain about it being even slower than fishing trawler. Then Jagex will probably change the pearl rate to be even lower until there is a new fast way to get the angler outfit.
---
Thanks I hate you to :)
---
People've been saying it either looks bad or the art style of it isn't oldschool/clashes since it came out. 80% sure a plea to redesign it has been on several old Q&amp;A's, it's just not something that comes up in conversation anymore so people don't bring it up.
---

yeah.. no, it's not a big deal, but the door objectively too small, there is no explanation for it being so small, but that's okay. this is meant as constructive criticism!

Hard to find a balance on what the poll % should be when you have so many different groups of players that can't always come together and vote on something as it may hinder their aspect of the game, just to name a few, pvm'rs, pk'rs, pures, skillers flipper merchers and combinations of all of the above. Raising it means marginal groups can block what the majority want, lowering it means controversial decisions can be made, there is no winning with this sadly. I think where it is right now is the """sweet""" spot
---
Don‚Äôt fuck up. You got this. I believe in you
---
yeah same i found out yesterday when I had to drop an air rune to make space for oak doors
---
The goal wasn't for the Saradomin brews, but for bird nests.
---
https://i.imgur.com/3miyJnm.png
---
Exactly my first thought as well... Jesus. These "inconveniences" are what make the game what it is. Coins, tools, run energy, it's all there to make you THINK about what you're doing. Anyone who ever played WoW knows what too much streamlining and pandering does to a game / playerbase. 
---
You said it, man.
---
Wouldn't a Slayer requirement (rather than Total level) be more suitable in that case? My main gripe with that approach is that it limits your say on content that you'd aspire to play one day. 
---
I like the whip idea, I just don‚Äôt like the model.

i have never thought of it as purple

I'd marry her and let her dominate me in bed

actually dipshit you can literally press alt+printscreen then open imgur and press ctrl+v and it's done

Same reason as ammy 1 m makes the A a long vowel (aye sound) 
---
A double tap to open the keyboard would work the best. That would allow single and long taps to go through the chat box (for left and right click actions)
---
I mean... It was a feature in OSbuddy and already had spent time developing. The feature came along pretty naturally. You're implying they somehow knew of the bug beforehand?
---
Full-screen rs? üò≥

It is an untradable outfit. Another person having it literally does not affect you at all.

Failing obstacles can hit up to 15. They probably forgot to heal above 15hp...

You get outta here.

No? I haven't played rs3 since 2014 but I think it's stupid how people on this sub seem to ignore that most of the updates this game gets are literally just reskinned things from rs3
---
nice
---
Yes hydra did a kill time redorder.
---
The others are likely recorded as they are solo which only you influence kill time. If its multi combat others can influence the kill. Since kills are awarded to the the player who does the most damage, there probably isnt a way to differentiate for kill timers currently to tell of there is damage other than your own. There's code to prevent irons from drops, which in response would be close to the same thing as the timer, but would probably require engine work to implement into kill timers for multi bosses.
---
sorry, but that happened like 2 years ago. or is it 3 now?
---
Bonecrusher also takes up an inventory slot for a bit of qol. What's your point?
---
Runelite.net is safe to use.
---
Bonecrusher saves inventory space because you dont have to collect bones and bank them. 
---
He was probably picking up his girlfriend
---
Sometimes its nice to just not attack Jad, just let him keep attacking you for a minute or two while you get into the rhythm of prayer swapping. Imagine some classical music while doing it, like as if your prayer swaps are a work of art. Then once you've gotten the gang of it, click on him once, go back to painting. When the healers come out, poke one, paint, poke another, paint, poke another paint, move away from Jad so the healers are at a distance then click jad and finish your painting.    
---
Man I'm weird, but that's always my mindset when I fight Jad. Find your happy place and give yourself all the time in the world... unless you're low on prayer pots, which you won't be, because you've 3 or 4 too many.
---
Iver 6 times drop rate, also only good items
---
Stfu plz
---
I'd say that is a scam of some form at least. You're basically pretending to be something you are not for personal gain. You're not explicitly saying anything untrue but it's still deceptive. It's similar to someone buying cheap wheelchair, sitting on the street looking like a hobo while hoping someone donates to you because of your deceptive appearance. English is not my first language but I wouldn't say it's farfetched calling it some kind of scam. 
---
If it would work like herb sack or looting bag then it would be different 
---
Still an unnecessary drain.
---
Rest In Peace. &lt;3
---
you would be surprised how many people bring d picks or eternal glories
---
How are the developers actually this bad
---
Only for their special attack
---
I'd like to see this, but based on the skill levels like JagexSween mentioned. Or maybe a combination of both? It would be interesting to see what people with low slayer levels vote on a slayer related poll compared to people with 90+ slayer.
---
What is the pin community?
---
Do you know the meaning of the word "immersion"?????
---
I play on a uim and my stats aren't good enough for raids yet but I'm looking for a new cc with active members. RSN: Glitter Mage
---
Opinions on adding a mini quick-chat feature for (perma) muted players for activities that involve teamwork with strangers such as Barbarian Assault, Raids 1/2?
---
That seems like a good idea, as in the past I've reached Jad easily but then panicked too much and missed a prayer.
---
What would you suggest is a better brew to restore ratio?
---
One step closer to RS3 easyscape
---
That is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.  
---
There is basically no counter to this if your team has good enough coordination.  
---
And the people that are reporting you in this thread are idiots.  
---
OP is at least shedding light on the issue, hopefully allowing it to be patched.  
---
Obviously OP is going to abuse it, I would too. Why wouldn't you? But hes at least saying it should be fixed.
---
Wait, is the mole actually the one who scratched the anti dragon shield?
---
hmmmmmm
---
*Will ye help an old pirate?*

Honestly I think teleports take away a lot from the feel of the game. I loved learning the best routes to take, and exploring the different paths and lesser known areas.

Reposttt
---
Most f2p Skilling methods are garbage for gp. Just buy memerbers for a month, get some farming exp and survive on selling weed to kids.
---
While I do want Jagex to acknowledge this on stream.
---
I do want to inform the community that /u/JagexJD is working on this issue with Twitch. He regularly posts here about it. I'd like to [point this post out in particular](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/agqgcf/to_help_fight_against_some_of_the_phishing/ee9la3i/?context=3). 
---
This
---
I don't, but they had the feature before runelite, it's a fact ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Not necessarily an ava's device for runes since it doesn't attempt to save runes you use, but I digress. I think the fact that it takes up an inventory space is a nonissue. It isn't meant for high-end pvm where every inventory spot counts. It's aimed more for your casual joe doing slayer where it doesn't really matter if you have 10 or 15 or 20 slots free.
---
They should make it so you can't gain experience in any skill if it's a higher level than your gnome ball level. 
---
Congrats!
---
I would love this if I didn't read it in a comment in this exact sub last week
---
To be honest Lance is easy to kill vorkath with it its only 1 min slower than dhcb but that's probably because massive ruby procs 
---
Interesting content.  I believe if you were to shorten the video, like maybe remove some of the nuances and just explain in the video what you did to gather certain supplies etc, you would receive more traction here.  
---
The internet is filled with people who have the smallest attention spans.  
---
But good work man!
---
Fishing trawler is easyscape. At least you have to do something when aerial fishing.
---
Tbh, I'd make a new account. Even if you get this account back, it's at risk of getting recovered again by the same person.
---
Example, PureSpam, an OSRS streamer has a void alt that got hacked. Even though he is friends with mods and could easily get the account back, he refuses to do so because the "hacker" will just recover it again since they know all the info.
---
Just another reason why Runescape needs to update their security options.
---
maybe?
---
1/95 for hellies and 1/100 for greater demons, but I guess yeah, Im just a low level noob and killing 150 mobs without any drop feelsBadMan :D

yeah, trying to be a little more efficient than afk and you get those 1xx drake and wyrm tasks... i have to instantly skip them in order to have fairly decent exp rates.

Is it weird that I can hear the music when I look at this picture 
---
Because it was it wasn't worth polling since most hated it.
---
Jagex customer service is so disgusting. Why is twitter/reddit the only way to talk to someone? And it's a lottery to get a response. 
---
It doesn't need a buff. You're getting free rewards for something you were already doing. 
---
lol i doubt u can profit high alching
---
Yes
---
Fair enough, I don't agree though. The cosmetic reward should be the token that you've done a lot of the content, if you get that reward passively while grinding out the useful rewards that loses its purpose entirely as everyone will have it
---
it IS different though, one involved an individual that expressed suicidal thoughts which changes the tone drastically the other was a silly but obviously not serious statement 
---
I‚Äôm of the opinion everything can be joked about, however there‚Äôs a time and place for it.
---
Poor guy. It‚Äôs always the people who are amazing at just being people too. Trapple, i never knew you but, RIP buddy!
---
I could've sworn the farming guild was in kebos.
---
Yeah I want my account locked for a day or two if my authenticator gets removed. Its that simple, give me that option.
---
Suicide unfortunately 
---
Some people may also be unsure if they want to play the game long term. Afterall free to play is similar to a demo of the game. So they play free to play to grasp any desire to play further. Additionally others do not have the funds to pay for the membership. I'm sure there any plenty of reasons why. 
---
Yes and nows as good a time as ever. DHCB and Dragonfire wards are  "cheap" as they've been in a long time right now.
---
Hopefully! My only fear is fucking up a prayer and getting 1 shot by Jad.
---
So did his profit/h decline in anyway or not?
---
What about the clue in tarn‚Äôs lair?
---
No...?  You're comparing apples with oranges. 
---
Requirements:
---
* Konar only has a 75 combat requirement.
---
* Clue Scrolls have various skill and quest requirements.
---
Time &amp; Effort
---
* Konar's droptable takes no time and no effort, as you want to do Slayer anyway.
---
* Clue Scrolls take extra time to do as you have to go out of your way to complete them.
---
The loot:
---
* Konar's droptable mostly consists of resource drops.
---
* Clue Scrolls mostly consists of cosmetics.
---
Yes, not necessarily the meta, but worth doing
---
You still have 16 more levels to go.
---
Sad but true
---
Hey aren't you the guy who 8 is unload?
---
The New Nite PepeHands
---
curved bones are 1/5k, long bones only 1/500. the guy is most likely lying or has somehow skipped every task that can drop long bones
---
dhcb is actually more expensive than ever lol
---
sad
---
Did you actually spend 2 full days (48 hours) at fishing trawler or are you exaggerating the shit out of it? lol
---
With a 1/8 chance of receiving an outfit piece it would on average take you 6 hours to get the full set (saying about 8 games per 1.5 hours). Anyways aerial fishing will be 40ish hours minimum for low levels to get angler outfit. So not worth it unless people really get that unlucky.
---
Good times, I remember skipping dinner cuz it was warring time. Sorry mum
---
In any game with open pvp, there will be people who do this. While I am not gaining anything in wealth from you or whoever I pk, I am gaining enjoyment with posts like these. There's a risk, you know there's a risk, yet here you are calling that risk toxic when the risk was there all along. 
---
Wait wtf! Me and Trapple were good friends!!! Omg.. I don‚Äôt play for one weekend... I gotta stop by Pinscape today
---
Depends. Some simply can't afford it, others like the sense of accomplishment that a self-made member gets. I personally agree with you, buying one bond makes it loads easier, but I see the appeal both ways
---
I went 4 tasks without a drop, just keep going. Also, occasionally I thought I wasnt getting drops, but my guess is I was getting herb seed drops that I assumed were outside the drop table considering I was doing like, wyverns or abberent spectres and those are "normal" drops for them but also are on the kdt.
---
I‚Äôve been telling him that haha
---
Same with like gargoyles and rune items
---
"ice"
---
It's only 130m. It was 170m last  month.
---
So what is the meta right now? Besides doing raids c:
---
5th
---
If you were ever at the GE in 362, he was probably bankstanding there xp wasting üòÇ
---
I kinda want to play RS3 Ironman since that game is so foreign to me now. 
---
How is flipping wasting time?
---
Pharoah's Sceptre is under miscellaneous I believe.
---
Unless you're going for 200m the outfit isn't worth getting.
---
damn he missed his protect from missiles switch
---
Thanks :)
---
I did that at the minimum agility you could have and hated life
---
Not even being able to have a basic support centre or a place to submit tickets for help really annoys me considering how active the game is with 150,000 at peaks. Don't get me wrong there is some amazing talent at Jagex but there are some really lazy people within it if they can't set up something so crucial and basic
---
Bruh lol
---
I dont remember the clan I was in, but it was my fav part of the game.
---
Divine/spectral/chaotic weps upgrades just for that back in the day.
---
It was fun as fuck. I'm so sad there's nothing left now. A mini-game with leaderboards, incentives and even ingame guilds would help.
---
I'm so edgy guys LOOK AT ME PLEASE, LIKE SERIOUSLY PLEASE NOTICE ME
---
362 I‚Äôm sure, he was always there :(
---
6 kills*
---
np
---
As both an RS3 and OSRS player this made me laugh
---
It honestly feels timesaving to grind out more agility levels for mep2. Those handhelds are demons from the 5th layer of hell.
---
The abyssal dagger as hideous as well it's got some of the worst graphic design ever.
---
‚Ä¢ Set a bank pin
---
‚Ä¢ Enable 2 factor authentication 
---
You got issues mate. I watch every upload. There's no "evidence." go plagiarise more tv shows and get a new hobby.
---
GOT DAMNIT THIS IS A FUNERAL PRIRATE 
---
Being poor doesn't change what is defined as end game content, though. 
---
Store that shit in the leprechaun 
---
I would much rather see a new gem added from a skilling update to make a set of skilling jewelry. It could be a very rare reward (similar to zenyte and onyx) but it could only come from some skilling content (where it would make sense). 
---
A new, rare gem could also help with the lack of profit from skilling recently.
---
1. This is completely irrelevant to the question and probably not even true
---
2. No shit? But if you log in and see your authenticator is pending cancellation, or you attempt to login and your password has been changed, you'll at least have time to change your shit/recover before they get into your account.
---
3. ?????????
---
4. A delay on account recovery would hurt the user more than it would help.
---
Lol :)
---
meme based on real life circumstance.
---
I actually have never met or even heard of this guy, but it's so nice seeing the OSRS community gather in times like this. RIP Trapple, I'm sure you were a good man and I'm sorry you lost your battle to depression. üò≠‚ù§
---
ty for the b0nk l3wt. 
---
100 would do again. 
---
I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw the abyssal bludgeon in-game. I thought it was a glitch. It does not look like a weapon your character is supposed to be holding. Like the model of a boss's weapon wrongly spawned into a players hand. It's a beautiful model, but it looks extremely out of place.
---
boring repost  
---
Delay on account recovery should be in yeah. But there's nothing to stop them sending messages to your email or phone when a failed login attempt happens. Notifying you someone's trying to get into your account. Also yeah it means you won't be able to access your account for a few days if you forget it. But I'd rather that then being hacked and losing everything I have
---
Authenticator? Bank pin? Lol
---
*open Sick Nerd post*
---
&gt; I got roped

The real headscratcher is, why do bonds drop for christmas, right when there's top demand for them due to the premier club deal?

it‚Äôs him

Lol wc
---
Assuming I am actually interested in doing construction. I earn around 370k/h. Currently there is no way for me to make any of those skills except agility which I still need to train to get graceful
---
I vote yes to reasonable ones
---
I do miss rest and musicians. It's stupid that to do things like clues or going to the back of the Slayer cave I either need a stamina running or I need to constantly teleport to a house.
---
email 2fa is good if you have a "cold" email that you don't use for anything other than 2fa
---
can you set your email 2fa to be different than your rs email? 
---
Could magic weapons with a signature spell, for example ibans blast or slayer staff have their signature spell selected for autocast when equiped. They can be bothersome to use and already have the drawback of carrying their runes seperately compared to staffs with their signature spell built in
---
Just use the snipping tool for christ sake! It ain't rocket science!

I read all of Bob's dialogue in her cat voice.

And? Are you getting 200k loot from pks every 3 minutes?
---
Did you click a twitch phishing link
---
Fuck it dood
---
Should we also add a magically imbued anvil that picks up all rune drops? But why stop there, we should get a magically imbued high alchemy that aloha all alchable drops for us the adds the coins to our investory!
---
Karamja gloves 4 has infinite teles straight to duradel
---
I fucking hope it's seasonal

wtf op pls nerf
---
You missed the part in the chat where I call you a thot üòò
---
Actually, I don't play RS3 because it's P2W.
---
Why don‚Äôt you test it first?
---
...but rapier is tradeable and would just appear on the ground? You mean the avernic defender?
---
I'd also like to add that the tool belt in rs3 was not an item in your inventory, it was an item that you just had, you never had to interact with it and you always could use the tools without them being in your inventory.
---
I wouldn't be against an item like a herb sack that could store tools.
---
Air bstaff always worked for me. Breakeven or slight profit.
---
This is my first sketch with a new drawing pad so I definitely will!
---
runelite only counted the kills that i got a drop on
---
it was about 80 kills into my task that I got all that, and I got nothing afterwards
---
Nah man, I don't really go on twitch and sure as hell don't click links
---
99 is a 99... great job =)
---
Can you please make it so that disabling bank all equipped items will also work for bank deposit boxes. Right now you can remove it from the bank, but not for the deposit boxes and that's kinda annoying
---
The copypasta is probably like 7 years old man
---
You won't need that many restores. If you're worried take some more brews as it's your first time. 
---
Hey... I have all 3 of these. I feel personally attacked :c
---
This post doesn‚Äôt even do a good job at making your point. How does what you said make this a ‚Äúreally fun‚Äù game?
---
/s
---
Not sure, as my email recovery/2fa doesnt use another email, much better for me to use my phone
---
Bank pin was in the works, and got a new phone so authenticator was deactivated. 
---
I swear I read somewhere that it's against ToS/game rules to use other accounts to aid an Ironman (outside of obviously allowed areas, raids, pest control, etc.) via grabbing aggro and what not
---
still doesn't prevent every YouTuber lol
---
Could a small portion of the community see the drop tables before release? NOT THE RARITY just what is on it. (Aka well known streamers/bigger names.) 
---
Most of the new drops are flooding in resources or alchables onto drop tables. 
---
The arrows are also in a certain shape.
---
specially when you buy them from the guy in varrock
---
That‚Äôs one hell of a useful DPS calc. Is it accessible to the public?
---
Yeah only people with 3b banks can afford to waste 50k/h on stamina pots
---
It literally doesn't matter if it doesn't help those without an authenticator, it's their loss for not having one. You're basically saying we shouldn't keep improving car airbags because it offers nothing to those who drive older cars without an airbag.
---
Again, you're (for whatever reason) arguing that just because it doesn't help people who don't actively log in, we shouldn't implement a feature that would benefit people who **do**. 
---
Joke is that op is gay
---
Don't be an Ironman then...
---
Yeah that's what I do till it's full if guam then I need to drop some. I'm not saying it's a huge problem just saying changing colors of seeds wouldn't fix everything
---
All patches of the same type will skip a cycle, so if it decides that your fruit trees skip a cycle, all of them will so they will stay in sync.
---
To be fair I wouldn‚Äôt want to have customer support if I were them either. It would be 99% people crying for nothing just to get free stuff. OMG MY INTERNET WENT OUT AND I DIED AND LOST EVERYTHING REFUND PLS

Stamina potions are more OP than resting in RS3 lol

just had my first task, it's shite, gj jumboflex

You can dumb down any argument if you're an idiot but you know that's not the same thing.
---
Yes! I'll PM you the link. 
---
This was cringe as fuck
---
I‚Äôm just not sure it‚Äôs on my end because it hasn‚Äôt happened to other accounts that play on my internet, it‚Äôs only been mine. My brother and friend have had no issues.
---
Our internet is DSL though 2.8/.8 speeds so I could definitely see that as being the issue. 
---
even after witnessing other people falling for them?   
---
That is the prime example of stupidity. 
---
The skilling necklace was recently updated to teleport you directly inside the farming guild should you meet its requirements. Can other guild teleports be similarly updated?
---
There is no need to be upset.
---
imagine giving gold to a pasta lmfao
---
About 5 years ago, I got permanently banned for botting. The web interface gave me no way of appealing, and there is no formal support system from Jagex, so I was stuck. I had to create a new account, post of the forum in vein hope (these threads never work). It wasn't until an (*unpaid*) PMod comes along, and does a very thorough search through my forum posting history, searches me on Google, finds I was a YouTubers and ultimately concludes that the likelihood of me botting is very low.
---
It took about 2 weeks until a JMod came along and actually looked into the case, to find it was a false positive from the automated system.
---
It's just absurd that I was graciously saved by having a clean posting history and a (small) YouTube channel. Surely this means there have been many accounts unfairly permanently banned?
---
Huge overhaul needed, dedicated support team hired. Community managers are just not enough, they don't have the time to do both jobs.
---
and here i thought this was gonna be some amazing meet. (still is tho)
---
Goodbye
---
I was excited to get 1 noted rune pl8 legs out of 130 last night 
---
Unfortunately, just about 60k worth in Rune item Drops. The one before that was blessed dhide boots, so I can't complain!
---
Ok? Takes 10 seconds for a support agent to send a copy paste message and close that case. 
---
For me it's the whole shared experience thing. Sure I could go out of my way to do that, but I know the vast majority just bought from GE and did the quest quickly. Idk it just makes me feel kinda like a dumbass doing things the hard way when everyone else is being so efficient (unless you're a btw which I'm seriously considering for reasons like this). The culture is so efficiency focused in OSRS and I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. It's similar to enjoying mining mythril cause it's higher level and you like the color purple; it doesn't make logical sense to do that when iron is strictly better exp/hour. Going back to the quest thing, it used to be about "oh this guy did that quest damn he had to put so much work in" to "oh he bought stuff on GE another quest done check". And you can't really walk around and be like "I didn't buy items from GE". 
---
I mean sure that would be interesting, but there is really no need between teleport tabs, fairy rings, poh, minigame teleports, etc. Home teleport changing to any city seems fine, like a wow hearthstone, tho. 
---
It's just redundant content that weakens current viable and sensible content. 
---
That's what you get for jumping on the bandwagon before checking if the wheels are stable.
---
Nah, some of if actually is. Then there's the part of the community that finds out someone recently came from rs3 and starts shit talking them. I have friends on both sides of it, people seem to want to feel superior based on the game they play even if what they say is incorrect.
---
Literally every person that plays oldschool RuneScape has gone through the same thing. deal with it. 
---
Powercreep? Did addition of diaries or shift click drop cause twisted bow to get added or what?
---
You gotta play off accuracy as well tho, the accuracy of the crystal haberd is significantly higher than dds
---
us osrs players welcome you with open arms. and were glad to have you
---
Takes a just few hours to make enough for 65 construction, even with shit stats
---
Rs3
---
Can I ask the question that everybody is thinking? What happened to him?
---
They both use the same phone app, but they're different codes. If you don't have authenticator on your mail, it's basically the same as not having one on runescape, as someone highjacking your email can immediately recover and remove your rs auth
---
Welcome, good sir. I hope you continue to enjoy the game! 
---
You ain‚Äôt alone.
---
When are the new death mechanics being implemented?
---
I mean sure I guess. Sounds fine. Idk why I got downvoted I was just clearing up some confusion that two people had lmaoi. 
---
Thoughts on allowing the Revenant weapons (Thammarons, Viggoras and Craw's Bow) be dismantled for 20,000 Revenant ether, similar to Zulrah's items?
---
This would 
---
a) Stop them crashing to obscenely low values, which I think is fair considering their rarity.
---
b) Be a sink for them, helping them maintain value long term.
---
c) Be useful for ironmen who get duplicates. 
---
Most aids photo I've seen in my life

Can you fix player pathing? I tend to get a big gap between a player simply because pathing is so bad. 
---
Yes but those go hand in hand..
---
I think it's originally a basketball player.
---
Takes more than 10 seconds to investigate people that get phished then blame it on jagex themselves. Or people that bot or use some other 3rd party program and then cry and ‚Äúfalse ban‚Äù we‚Äôve seen it multiple times on reddit alone I can only image how many wasteful tickets they‚Äôd get
---
i would if i made the money jagex was making 
---
The wheels have well and truly buckled. Long be gone my bandwagon jumping days. 
---
im a bit of a noob in pking but what combat stats should i aim for or do you have? pking looks really fun!
---
At least on rs2 you needed to fill the toolbelt with stuff once. Then a long time later I made a new acc and every single thing was already in there, like wtf
---
No, I‚Äôm not. Maybe it seemed like it, but I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick.  
---
Let‚Äôs start over, alright?   
---
My original point still stands.  
---
Things get added to the game that make certain things easier, I personally think it‚Äôs a good thing, sinc it attracts new players. People will get the angler set easier than, you get something else easier than someone else.  
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say is, don‚Äôt spite people because they have it easier.
---
Got two sentences into paragraph and I knew it was the mod Ashe milking things lol
---
Time to grind 91 rc I guess
---
I'll make a better OSRS with School and Hookers!!!... forget the School!
---
How do you feel about adding more bank tabs to help with bank organization? This doesn't mean more bank space, just tabs. I feel it would help due to all of the new items coming into the game and make it easier to navigate your bank on mobile.
---
12 medium clues though. gf
---
I've been hearing that phone 2fa is easy as heck to spoof and might as well not be 2fa'd at all. 
---
Not sure how accurate that is, apparently it needs to be through an auth app. 
---
Whilst true, the meta remains to use the dds over the crystal halberd except at the corp beast, and that's only due to the corp's passive.
---
Could the Greater Magical Trap in POHs please be able to teleport people to the teleports available in the Portal Nexus?
---
Ever since upgrading I can't send people to various places anymore.
---
"I got scammed plz 100k"
---
No, and don't let it become an 'instead of school' activity.
---
Alright, i was just getting your reasoning. ill upvote
---
&gt;Im such a shill I must type bigly words
---
&gt; Having such limited run energy (even at high agility levels) only serves to make the game more frustrating
---
No it doesn't. Apparently you forgot what it's like to be a mid-low level but you use run energy to evade aggressive NPCs. It's a resource, just like HP and prayer, up until you're a high level that isn't worried about taking a few hits from tortures gorillas on your way to demonic gorillas. 
---
Because it was a shit suggestion

I play this game to watch the little numbers go up. I love it when the little numbers go up.
---
If you're making the permanent switch, could look at swapping some GP over so you're not totally starting from scratch. Welcome to the dark side! 
---
I still don't think I have 43 prayer in RS3 and I've been playing RS on and off since 2004. 
---
With GE, stamina potions, the plethora of teleports, and Slayermusiq guides, questing is super easy and fun to do.
---
How much of the current active playerbase play on ironman accounts? A breakdown of HCIM, UIM, and IM would be really neat to see.
---
it's not about bonds it's about the mentality of wanting a game this full of content for free
---
imo - then go play fortnite or smth.

It's good everywhere.

Somehow, he can't seem to take screenshots üòÖ

I'm just wondering why it's a trend lol

Are you playing mobile and have thumbs the size of basketballs or something?
---
Holes that sink

Would be kind of upsetting if they get to this before boss KC. 
---
Why?
---
15 is a nice number
---
Considering we all pay their bills in keep them in business how do they owe us nothing?
---
Zuk is just a fucking rock, not scary at all and Sosasteg is a small doggy

So what do the visages have to do with this?
---
Tbh this is actually an amazing drawing. The detailing, the colours, texture... everything. 
---
Really fucking solid work. 
---
Please can you poll a re-design of the Abyssal Bludgeon? It's so ugly and out of place, I don't want to use it at all.
---
milky
---
IDK, did it for a couple levels to get 80 for the better blast mining exp. In terms of things I've done for my max cape it isn't the worst. I'd definitely say slayer is 1000* worse because, without alts, it's 1000* slower.
---
I really hate skills that req alts for decent EHP (so, slayer), more than things I can do myself.
---
i guess so bcs of some whales buying ingame GP using bonds only but ye my point is not about the bond system it's about that i wanna play but don't wanna play mentality
---
Except Treasure hunter interface
---
Can we get the ability to toggle our quick prayer on and off with a keyboard button?
---
Can confirm, have failed multiple classes
---
Then don't use the new one and let the people who want the bone whip use it... 
---
I remember the Keanu one, it's probably the most used one at least.
---
i love this constant circlejerk about hating rs3 here tho
---
I'm absolutely loving this boss. So satisfying that when you get good at it you don't even take damage. (Other than the first attack being RNG.)
---
Had it down after a few kills, refined my method, then got the claw and went back in to relearn how to do it with melee.
---
My favourite boss in the game to be honest.
---
Nature spirit gave me 13, and i decided to do the Soul's Bane quest so I could do the Varrock hard diary and that gave me 15 def. Either way i would max at 86 combat
---
Konar is good fun with nice extra drops. But higher masters are better xp. Your call
---
Biggest difference you‚Äôll notice is actually having a dev team 
---
I smell a bit of autismomifinioonus
---
Reddit complained and jmods saw and took it as the community as a whole not wanting it. Hence no poll.
---
Doesn't the second to last poll question make the last question irrelevant?

actually, it started with Keanu Reeves.

but there is a fucknig slayer helm in ur own and ut task is 28 bronze drags? r u fried?

I semi agree with the need to carry money for so many things. Once you get to late game it‚Äôs such a nuisance to need 50 gp to ride a Minecraft around zeah, or 200 gp to pay a farmer to chop a tree, or 1k to hitch a ride on a charter ship. 
---
I think the money pouch is pretty absurd, but I would love to see more quests or one-time fees to take away this need to have cash all the time.

Or just a minimum wage job...

You could plank make for a few hours. Its normally profit but if you put it towards con it'll just lessen the cost of that and give you some pretty decent magic xp. But bursting tasks is gonna give you the best xp by far
---
You should be able to do him with those stats. If you aren't, I'd suggest using rune darts, as it helps with DPS. Maybe try a kill with karils top and bottom for the added defense, and see how that does. With those stats, I'm not sure how much better void is over karils.
---
Hahahahaha rip fair enough, any luck with mobile now? 
---
When is it my turn to post this
---
If you're account was stolen originally there's nothing they can do. They believe they are contacting the person who sold them the account.  Plus I've seen this site threaten it before, it would be extremely hard for them to do anything if you are in a different state, especially if you're in a different country 
---
It's runelite cashing In LOOOL
---
I swear I‚Äôve seen so many people get rangers on their 11TH clue ... illuminate?
---
You the fried shrimp, my man. He's talking to the other guy
---
Does it count as instanced loot maybe?
---
Is it really going to make much a difference honestly? There's leaked emails and passwords but I don't think they're in pairs. So you'd have to take an email account and then try it with those 21 million passwords hoping for success and even then they might not even have an osrs account? I know that it's bots doing it so it's not exactly hard work but surely the length of time it would take makes it not a big deal. Then of course there's those of us that have old enough accounts that we don't use email to log in.
---
I am a fully licensed unionized electrician. I have a mortgage, car payments and 2 children to provide for and I don‚Äôt have 30 hours a week to justify paying cash for an OSRS membership
---
I love the last suggestion, the rangers would be a sick pet.
---
Very true.
---
I'm saying "jagex hasn't addressed it hur dur" is stupid and wrong. Regardless of your opinion on hiding polling, this is a fact.

Is that with or without a slayer task may I ask?
---
Use Runelite and turn on the RSBuddy prices to get accurate prices. The GE slowly updates on purpose to avoid price manipulation 
---
Can't wait for the abyssal whip price to drop so I can accomplish my childhood dream and afford it.
---
That's genuinly impressive if that's the case..
---
PM me daddy
---
Looos nice can send?
---
Yea, that's pretty much what I'm doing. Used to play back in the day and had pretty high slayer. Only 60cb at the moment, but plan on using Konar once I hit 75 (Assuming she hasn't been nerfed by then)
---
I finally sucked it up and did the 1616161616 for my ornate pool and jew box but I didn‚Äôt know the stews needed all those quests and the cat bullshit
---
Might just 16161616 for 5 more levels lol
---
tl;dr : they can't sue you.
---
Jagex owns your account and you in theory "rent" it from Jagex and can claim it if you are the original owner.
---
its nothing more than the runescape black market trying to scare you into submission of your account.

be careful for fishing links you'll get over the next little while, don't log into anything outside of runescape's sites. and enable 2 step authentication.

the only reason he included that is because he didn't want to be downvoted. kind of sad it went over your head

Can pvm slowly ruining skilling be addressed? The game is slowly turning into RS3 with old combat
---
How would one do that?
---
Yes, more slayer buffs!! That's what we need! Please jamflex until this skill hits 150k exp/hour and 12m gp/hour it simply isn't good enough

I've never saw black rocky desert

With bp and 91 range he's in absolutely no danger whatsoever of running out of prayer with that many restores, so having an additional 2 won't achieve much

it's one of those things that like you know you need to just sit down and do but it's also a super boring stat to level even to 43 so I can get why people would put it off

OP's suggested colors would basically not help me whatsoever.

Can anyone say we-wee-weeeekly repost?

I've finished all the quests. Plus when I quest I just want to basically sit back and chill and follow someone doing it.

calm down there Mr manly man . It‚Äôs literally $11. You don‚Äôt think other plays have those same responsibilities? You‚Äôre not alone my friend. US average for electricians is $25.75 an hour. $4120 a month before taxes so just to be safe let‚Äôs call is $3000. $11 out of $3000 is &lt;1% of your monthly income...

 So because a few people would abuse/misuse the system (which literally happens with every service in the world) the rest of the playerbase has to get shafted?

True, but there are a lot of NPC's that have right click travel options to skip that dialogue. It would be nice to be able to skip through that.
---
I mean you're right but OP isn't wearing his slayer helm (I'm guessing because it's not imbued?)
---
Imbue that helm dude. If you're gonna do shitty tasks like this at least help yourself...
---
Shades of green won't help shit bud
---
The game's mostly the same - if our perception was the same. 
---
Clan wars fights have died, f2p fight have mostly died. Part of it is that there are way less people and the ones that are left care too much about losing and refuse to fight.
---
it's not free, u are losing efficiency in doing konar tasks, the majority of the time u need to go out of the way for doinng her tasks  
---
(dust devils in smoke dungeon for example - the most efficient and comon location would be on Kourend)  
---
that's why in the eyes of the "main community" it's not worth using konar as Slayer Master, it's onnly worth it if u are chasing some of the new slayer monster
---
lol just hop
---
I think initially we should have to use tools which take up a space each but I can't see why we can't earn a tool belt later on into the game. not necessarily like the one in RS3 but maybe an actual item we carry which just has all the tools in it.
---
lol just drop faster
---
MEP2 sucks fat dick.
---
Don't @ me.
---
Yea i got hacked last week for everything but was able to recover my account but still lost 55mil worth of gear. Glad to have the account back but i didnt even bother making a ticket or notify jagex because they wont replace items. 
---
They stay there for an hour I believe. Not sure if it's a bug or it's intended.
---
And the demographic the authenticator delay would help most are people who bought their accounts. Jagex has said time and time again that their priority is to return accounts to their original creators, and adding after-the-fact security measures such as authenticator delay would enable people who purchased or stole the accounts of others to secure those illegitimate accounts against original creator recoveries. 
---
Funny how all of these "still no authenticator delay" posts seem to conveniently omit this part. 
---
Someone break out that 2008 to 2018 meme Of the happy kid playing RuneScape and the sad  adult playing RuneScape

I agree, using runelite makes you a fuck up.

This is the part where he says something like "You don't _have_ to pay them anything" or something like that

You don‚Äôt get hacked from using runelite.....
---
‚ÄúManly man‚Äù ?. Wow, thanks dude!

I feel sorry for those American electricians if

 $25.75/hour is the median salary.

Again, can‚Äôt justify spending real money to play a game when I can pay fake money to play it the same way.

lmfao just keep the account. No legitimate right of action here
---
If your plant/s are diseased and the skip happens, they'll die.
---
I don't know man I don't think it's that serious... It's sort of like football rivalries, like The Minnesota Vikings vs The Greenbay Packers. That's what I think it is when osrs players make fun of rs3 players. 
---
Now for the game itself, not the players, there is animosity but it would be justified considering that every returning osrs player lost their account due to rs3 turning into a game that they didn't sign up for. It's like watching your best friend turn into a junkie and change from what he used to be to a completely new person. Now obviously it's not that extreme lol but it's the same idea basically. 
---
Or a herblore one?
---
Needed help with support the other day. Sent in a ticket at 6AM GMT, got a response 4 hours later that was pretty helpful and contained information that actually helped me. Maybe you guys don‚Äôt get help because you guys give out account information then expect Jagex to save you from people who have your recovery details.
---
I'd guess he's thinking how pre-eoc a rapier would drop coins. But talking in osrs; avernic defender. Gl picking up those 1 million coins.
---
Bit scuffed as I wasn't fully potted and wasn't paying full attention so I forgot to preemptively lure the Hydra to vents before it changed phases. Still pretty pleased with this though so decided to share

Satisfaction

This is correct. All accounts are owned by jagex and this is their legal way of solving these types of issues.

They do have a support staff, their website is just shit and it makes it hard to use.

Can sound settings be added to the list of things to receive some love during QOL month?

3. Perhaps notification sounds

Sorry to hear your having a bad time.

if players are harassing you, block them and switch works. Reporting in the extra step. when you report the player you have the option to mute them your self's
---
Some people are just toxic and that extends out side of rs.
---
Now because you didn't get results doesn't mean Jagex does not care.
---
its seems you are very emotional about the subject so i'm not gonna tell you how to live your life or play a game.
---
Wtf Tithe Farming is easy shit. You can get three runs done in an hour easily. 
---
Just realized you that place up North. But seriously. It‚Äôs $11. Definitely doable if necessary. Most people bite the bullet the first month and then switch to bonds. Herb runs are your friend plus super easy to do from mobile. 
---
After playing both this and WoW, WoW's customer service was solid.
---
Now that we are paying like $8-$10 to play Scape, they absolutely need to up the customer service. No item restoration and essentially telling players "tough shit" when they get hacked is embarrassing.
---
Every game has many bullshit tickets sent. You think Blizzard dosn't deny thousands of tickets a day? Riot Games? Any other big company? It's called customer service and Jagex has none.
---
They're all tied to the alch price of whatever you make with them. Doesn't really do much.
---
Id give my whole acc and much more back if it meant i could see my friend again.
---
Classic copy pasta is classic :') 
---
You literally returned to RS3 a month ago. Wouldn't really say you "made the move" when you hardly got into the other game.
---
eh, my account is not worth the effort for someone to spoof 2fa, find a cold password, and steal my pin
---
now if you're a core runelite dev and sneak some of that malicious shit into the closed source portions, all you need is to spoof 2fa I guess lol
---
I can't say it is, but I can only share my experience. Also have shitty internet.
---
Pay the farmer 
---
it's amazing people think these things would be so overpowering that it would completely change how you think about the game.
---
resting worked pre-eoc rs and was absolutely fine, and was a nice addition to the game. a tool belt can be incorporated into the game in a different way than it is in RS3 and could be equally a nice addition as resting. why do people want osrs to be tedious just for the sake of being tedious?
---
Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?

I remember seeing it about Zucc ages ago

Just mute and move on.

Hey dude! Would be glad if you could send me the Link! Ty!

You realize OSRS only has a small team of staff right? They‚Äôre not a blizzard, riot or any of those other companies. 
---
Konar for some more variety, Duradel if you want XP/boss tasks. I'm 118cb with 90+ combat stats and tried Konar for a few tasks, ended up back at Duradel since. Nice bit of content but it's more focused towards med-levels.

Use Scimitars and I believe Slash trains strength. If you hover your cursor over the attack style,  it tells you which stat it trains, if you‚Äôre on mobile Idk how to see but definitely use a weapon
---
Yeah i don't see why not. You guys already have the Steel key ring.

I dont think so. Atleast if agility caused it

Explain the influx of hacks of runelite users
---
Taking back my upvote ty.
---
I disagree tbh. The only impractical thing ous probably the shoulder blinding their view. 
---
Realistic melee combat is much more about not getting hit at all, rather than shielding a hit. In this case the plated arm is a good tool to protect from self injury when parrying or deflecting strikes. 
---
Verac also uses a flail. Not to say verac want a master of their weapon but a flail is the most unpredictable weapon of melee combat. Self injury from a flail is common. Flails are also primarily blunt - force weapons. While they can typically have spikes, most of the trauma inflicted comes from the shear force applied from the metal ball, multiplied by the angular velocity from the chain. 
---
These 2 facts, coupled with the fact that plate armour is notoriously bad at protecting from blunt force injury (the stiff metal transfers the energy readily as it doesn't want to bend to absorb the shock) means that armour wouldn't protect the user anyways.
---
For verac's case as a flail user, more range of motion and restricted movement is more advantageous than any protection platemail would provide from an attacker. 
---
See also plateskirt vs platelegs; same logic (less restrictive movement is better for a flail user) 
---
I just hope with so many people switching to OSRS that these people who switch have zero tolerance for MTX because this could potentialy be detrimental to the existence of OSRS if we get more people who don't mind MTX.
---
Welcome nevertheless.
---
flipping isn't raising the prices. Im assuming a bunch of people are buying them for magic trees to get to 85 farming, considering magic saplings have just about doubled in price in the last 3 weeks.
---
Thank you and yes I am on mobile. Slash won't train my defence tho will it? 
---
Sounds like you're just going to use the account for pking though? 
---
Maybe no point going for graceful really then just go wildy course?
---
I retalked to Steve right away but I didnt have an option. Must be a bug
---
Yeah, exactly. Especially given that I did the quest when I was about 10 or 11 or something, it was a very very long time ago, not very long after I started playing the game. Ectofunctus existed in the game, I believe, but I don't think I'd ever gone to Morytania at that point, and certainly gilded altar didn't exist. 
---
Actually now I think about it, I had been to Morytania, because I had this idea that I was one of the few players to ever do Nature Spirit. It just seemed to be so far away from the rest of the content of the game, and I never saw a single player in Morytania the entire time that I was there doing that content, that I assumed very few people actually ever bothered to go there. I felt very unique with my silver sickle.
---
Damn are these things starting up again?
---
I would add *high intensity, non afk to this
---
That music choice though.
---
Fair point, honestly there is no reason for herbs just being all green, when there's many other colors, there's whitish, brownish, and yellowish herbs IRL.
---
While it is not difficult to hover over them or having runelite or whatever, I can understand OPs complaint, but since this would be QoL I can also understand how a lot of OSRS hardcore players would hate it.
---
No need to be conscending tbf...
---
this is the second time you posted this, so here's my response...
---
if players are harassing you, block them and switch worlds. Reporting in the extra step. when you report the player you have the option to mute them your self's

Because I work in construction and you can't walk with a pickaxe strapped to your hip. They are carrying tools, hammers tho... Maybe if it takes an  equipment slot
---
When you say you are going to poll something, can you just poll it to get the result rather than removing it the day before because of a tiny percentage of players on Reddit going crazy? If something is going to get voted down, allow that to happen rather than dismissing it before the rest of the playerbase gets the chance to have their say, I'm certain 99% of the playerbase don't use or even know about the OSRS Reddit.
---
I swear I drew something almost exact to yours. 
---
Then again, didn‚Äôt everyone do that when they were younger and played? We all had dreams.  
---
I'm with you. Unlocking all the teleports and knowing that I don't have to do all those runs anymore is an accomplishment. I made 200 troll basalt TP's last night and I loved every minute of it, because skipping the little annoyances is satisfying AF.

It ain't much, but its honest work
---
Vast majority doesnt have a 50mil or less bank, the average bank value of normal players was around 400mil according to the data stream. If you have a 50mil bank why are you crying about a 1 str bonus upgrade over a whip? Regardless the new whip wasn't filling any gap, it was a forced way at fixing a dead weapon by creating a new weapon that was not needed. Whip doesn't need three different variants. Really retarded to see arguments like this when players cry that they have a smaller bank...and people are out to get them or something. 
---
There are some very expensive places to live with pretty shit income. Charleston for example. I'm management at a retailer so I dont necessarily have to worry about it, but I know the associates here get paid as little 8.50/hr where apartments in even slightly decent areas are over $1100/mo. If you get an apartment for $800 - $1000 per month you run the risk of getting shot. I know Charleston is a one of a kind place, not many like it in the U.S. in n terms of cost of living to income aside from like California, but these places do exist

Yeah it sucks, honestly don't understand how rs still doesn't have any kind of colourblind mode

Thanks for the comperation

Yeah it isn't but I found I got them commonly enough that it was worth a block. I don't have a ton of tasks unlocked yet and still use Nieve.  
---
I may change my mind in the future but for now it's been working out. 
---
You got greedy. Could have sold for 3m. 
---
No name, no shame b
---
There have been great suggestions for this. I've seen some that were kind of similar to raids, but for skilling. To give a quick example of some posts I've seen: Entering a cave (resources would randomly spawn throughout it), and the further you go, the better the resources. The idea included dangers such as periodic damage due to gas, traps, poison, etc.
---
I definitely agree it should be locked behind quests, but preferably not end-game quests. Things like One Small Favour and maxed reputations on Kourend would definitely help keep bots out, but make it so even pure skiller could take a shot at this kind of challenge.
---
:)
---
If anything got a buff to make it comparable to a whip, then the whip will no longer be the ‚Äòbase‚Äô item you‚Äôre referring to. There‚Äôs only so many options that players will consider, and that‚Äôs the best ‚Äòbang for your buck‚Äô. A Bone Whip would be the next tier of that, once you can actually afford it.
---
I have always just used a naga 
---
Y‚Äôall talking about ugly items but forgetting how gross zulrah uniques look. ‚ÄúHey guys lets make these items fluorescent bright colours that we have never used in this game before‚Äù 
---
What is with these posts lately, cool a normal fire giants task. Next
---
As was said by someone else, that gap is filled by the tent whip. No need for another undegradable weapon inbetween rapier and whip in my opinion. 
---
The sad reality is people getting their accounts hacked = you buying another membership.
---
I think no degradable stuff is what will bite us in the end.

This is supposed to be the master meme sub but the majority of you lot don't even recognise this as basic ass copypasta.

why do you need alts to train slayer? im a noob

You report, ignore, set to friends, hop worlds.

Its incredibly simple 
---
how is it a literal game mechanic lmfao. Rigour is literally the best DPS upgrade for its price. Actually 75m for rigoru is fucking cheap, looking at how strong it is. 
---
Ouch.
---
imo, do it the same as tentacle in terms of degradation but reverse which item gets used, whip already has a perfect whip sync and the price is nice, have it so the hydra tail gets eaten after 10k hits or something or maybe even 20k, and keep the whip.

I met Trap in person after learning he lived four hours away from me. I spent a full weekend with him for his birthday last year. 
---
Nick was a pillar of our community and one of the most welcoming and down to earth guys I knew. He was always ready to talk and was there if you needed ANYTHING. This man was everything you could want in a clan mate, and more than everything you could want in a friend.. and I miss him so fucking much.
---
I used to joke about how much you bankstood, trap. Well, I‚Äôll be doin it a hell of a lot more, just for you.
---
I have hellhounds and black demons blocked too. I dont use cannon so these 0 money task are so annoying and take ages

Then why do it like that? Much better to cut yews which are worth more and then buy planks with the profit...
---
Do you normally double BGS spec or was it for the PB attempt? Sick pb tho
---
It's fishing and woodcutting. You click and wait 2-4 minutes. You're acting like it takes pro starcraft 2 levels of actions per minute to handle that.

Cons: a lot of people don't give a shit about any of that stuff and pay hard earned money to play the game the way they want to.

Oh didn‚Äôt know that, thanks
---
No, the bankpin should be a stand alone feature. 
---
I also disagree with the authenticator delay in general It doesn't protect your account, your account stays compromise.d If you want a delay that badly it should be upon account recovery. Where Jagex locks the account for a few days upon a successful appeal. This way Jagex can gather all recovery appeals at once, assuming you're actively playing.

---
? look at the one i mentioned, with low level TBing.
---
theres people who say "kill me for video!" and they drop 500k.
---
its much bigger than a normal kill, and its a donation.
---
so thats confirmed evidence.
---
later on in the video someone is talking to him while dying, saying "love ur vids &lt;3" or something.
---
that guy dropped 3.5mill i think.
---
but yeah theres no evidence.
---
if random people are willing to lose millions just to help him make a video, why wouldnt he spend 0 GOLD to fake his own kills, if that gives him a bigger salary every month?
---
yeah no evidence, hes saying no to free money.
---
Do you know how averages work? 400 mil average doesn‚Äôt mean most have 400 mil banks. It means some people have one/multiple accounts worth billions, while others fall significantly below the 400 mil mark.

I know that those small bonuses don‚Äôt seem like anything to you, you probably wouldn‚Äôt even use it. But to me, it would‚Äôve been a great upgrade.

At least you only lost a couple day's worth of shit lol. It blows my mind people on here cry about getting hacked and losing 5 mill. Secure your account before you play.

Then secure your damn account.

While planted the Kronos seed has a chance to make your crop/tree/herb/... skip a growth cycle and the chance of your patch getting diseased is calculated every growth cycle. Does this mean that the Kronos seed also reduces the chances of your patches dying, or was something added so the patch death rates aren't affected? Also if this is the case, how does this compare to the Iasor seed?

Haha when your name is DoShrooms on runescape and a random event pops up so you screenshot the exact moment it says ‚ÄúDoShrooms!‚Äù And you post on le reddit for upvotes for a half-assed meme epic style 
---
This sounds like fun. Just minigames.
---
If they're leaving rs3 they're not gonna want to make this game like rs3, retard 
---
For real just looking at the names is easy enough. A lot of the time they ain‚Äôt even close. Also a stream with thousands of people but nobody talking? Yeah if that isn‚Äôt fishy to someone then, well, enjoy the burn.

Remove polling. It's a problem

JagexGambit said in a comment in an earlier post that you guys were considering making melee more viable as whole for the Alchemical Hydra.
---
Is that still happening?
---
Anyone who is tired of another ranged meta boss and tries melee will agree that melee just sucks here.
---
Yeah this gets upvoted a lot but then people vote for things to make the game easier and more like RS3.
---
can u dont

Dude same. I made a cannonball alt, put 20m on it and did it for a few hours before getting off. Forgot about the alt for a few days and try to log on and its perm banned. Appealed it and they said they weren't wrong in the ban. Not that bothered by it but Im not gonna make a thread about a lvl 3 cannonball alt because I don't wanna be flamed and told I shouldn't bot.

Holy crap the RS3 sub is salty.

Blast mining. at 99 700k/hr is possible. At 90 its about 600k, and at 80 its around 450k. AND it's good exp.

I don't know if this is exactly what you mean, but you can click the lock button in the top right when you've selected the gear you want to compare against. This greys out your selections to show what you had and then any changes you make will be compared to the set you locked. The outputs won't change directly, but instead show a plus or minus value indicating how much they will change with your proposed selection switches. When you click the lock button again, you are given two options. You can either change your selections to the new ones if they are better, or you can discard and it will revert to the selections you locked. 
---
If you have a suggestion for a better way to do this, or another option that would suit your needs better, let me know! I eventually want an options menu which allows users to customize their experience a bit.

Thank you for the feedback!

I have no clue either, I just assume everyone is messing around to be honest

so something with an even higher req than rune rocks?

Can we add a new spot to mine volcanic ash to the farming guild?  It's already next to a volcano, and the farming requirement would be a deterrent to bots.

I was thinking of start there as well,and yeah I prebought everything already

What pins?

So you're saying that there's a conspiracy of large scale voting fraud? 
---
It‚Äôs part of the grand exchange plugin, there‚Äôs a checkbox in there. It shows up when you select an item to buy/sell

For a noob using range, it would provide a drop of extra def so it's not that silly IMO ;)

Wait, people use this place?

Scarecrows protect sweetcorn and last indefinitely til removed, and with sweetcorn seeds being less than 10gp and yielding 150gp per sweetcorn, it's a very good turnover long term if you decide to do that.

Hey, sorry to go a bit off topic but do you know where to find chill clans? I went on the Runescape forums and all of those clans have like an application you have to fill out? Maybe I just didn't look hard enough, but kind of hoping there's a better place to find clans?
---
It is IMO just a more frustrating version of demonic gorillas. It is quite a bit of money if you go on drop rate but unlike vorkath or zulrah you're relying a ton on rares since of the 5m/hour hydra makes you, 2m/hour of it is just from the claw (these are also the stats for tbow getting 25 kph so if you don't have tbow it will be worse). 
---
Ofc it's a game and you should do what you want, but by the end of a task of around 175 I was really ready to be done with this boss forever. I've got 2k vorkath and 3k demonic kc and I'm not bored of either of those, 175 hydras was enough for me though. 
---
Hmm, I had no idea. I'll edit it in now.
---
Thank you! I figured the mole would look scary to a newer/younger player lol
---
The Jmods once talked about making it so autocast mage weapons would ‚Äúremember‚Äù the last spell that was selected when reequipping. Is there any hope to see this actually implemented? Perhaps as part of qol month? 
---
Can we have some novice quests on Kourend that develop on the stories of the day-to-day life of the individual houses? I'd love to see some quests where you do some mundane task like help a Hosidius farmer repair his equipment or help a Piscarilius fisherman get some special bait.

I calculated it our the other day and determined that paying for magic trees is actually overwhelmingly not worth atm. Coconuts are wild haha. 
---
Yeah pretty much. Removes a lot of variety from slayer as you‚Äôre prioritizing greater nechs, smoke devils, dust devils. And doing really fast tasks like baby black drags, dark beasts and trolls to keep slayer points up so you can skip the rest of the slow tasks that are too uncommon to justify blocking.
---
Wait what you're serious? Yeez those things are garbage
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

99 farming and it seems like I cant keep fucking anything alive.

This will save about 10-20 clickes pre slayer task? Is it really "easyscape"?

That's exactly what niche means? It's not universally good, just a small specific use

Item restoration on a game where most things are tradeable is not the same as restoring a bunch of soulbound items on wow.

I had this issue fixed it just by running as admin, happens everytime you dont tho so set in its properties to always run as admin.

I just did underground pass on my alt and it was crazy how different this was after each time doing it. First account in 2005: 8 hour quest. 4th time doing the quest in 2019 on an acc with 48 agility: 90 mins.

I guess I don‚Äôt consider raids to be niche, considering it‚Äôs one of the most popular pieces of pvm content and one of the best moneymakers.

ent hider is hardly ridiculous, not being swarmed by other people at wintertodt is only slightly beneficial outside of being nicer to look at, and yeah i agree clue scroll solver is op as fuck i always thought it kind of shouldnt be in there, id still end up googling it even if it wasnt tho. not done gorrilas yet cause fuck MM but yeah sounds op as hell and probs shouldnt be in there either. menu entry swappers is also slightly better than normal cause no right clicks but it aint game breaking. there are a couple of things that shouldnt really have been added for integrity purposes, but theyre spouting off straight lies just for karma lmao

I wish pure essence had value, like back in the old days. It get‚Äôs dropped in such insane amounts now. Same with flax.

Hot tip from my experience merching release/dev items, the hype *never ever* comes through - all the money is to be made selling stuff to people (like you in this case) who buy items at peak speculative prices on the hype chance it will be worth *even more* on actual release (and it never is).
---
I‚Äôm with you, this shit is old af. I‚Äôm actually more surprised this many ppl never seen it before
---
Wtf i just killed 170 of those and they only dropped bones
---
I mean it's not that much different. Bossing is becoming overly relevant, new content is being added on a weekly basis... Is it really OSRS if the old content is covered in new content? Or is it just a different RS3?

Works the exact same as herb/tar, so does mahogany/teak logs since they added crossbow fletching.

For everyone asking, Trapple was a dear friend of ours in the clan Pinscape. The clan is based off a bunch of us who buy/sell/produce Runescape enamel pins from the Facebook group ‚ÄúThe Runescape Pin Grand Exchange‚Äù. Trapple was a member from the beginning and was a star rank in our CC.

Except unlike demonic gorillas, you know exactly what to pray here and can avoid 100% of the damage at hydra minus first attack. 
---
right? its just straight ridiculous, i agree with some of the stuff theyre saying, clue solver is op but its just cutting out the step of me wiki'ing it. but why lie about stuff like "runelite is just botting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" thread is so backwards
---
What? 
---
It really was even crazier a few years ago. It might have been right around that time, but they had changed to a completely no tolerance policy on botting. If your account was caught by the automated system and you were banned, you couldn't even submit an appeal.
---
"There are no false positives. Our system is perfect. If you are banned for botting you are banned forever."
---
I shudder to think how many people were wrongly banned during that time period.
---
Absolutely don't use a proxy or VPN, that's just asking to get your account locked since they'll be data centre IP's and most likely already used for botting.  If anything, change your own IP.

I mean you still bought/found the tools and own them. It removes the need to walk all the way back to your bank to retrieve a tool, then walk all the way back to where you need to go. Nobody likes backtracking in video games.

This may be unpopular but I think that polls have been leaning this way since 2014 the GE / bond update. After that it turned into what the devs want vs what the community wants. Now hear me out I know lots of major updates didnt pass since then but that was the start of repolling, rewording, voting against a negative, ect

Can you allow us to kill Galvek to complete a Wyrm task (given by Duradel - because Konar will always assign at Karuulm)?

Could we claim a **Herb Sack** after completing a certain amount of Farming contracts for the Farming Guild? That'd be a great secondary way of obtaining it, just how the Rune Pouch comes from two quite related sources.

firstly, why the fuck would you want to waste precious bank space on bronze armour. secondly, the thing you're asking for does exist.

They are protection payment for the new dragonfruit trees which is why they are rising. Nothing to with flips

They've learned at this point that they don't have to be believable because because most of the community won't fall for it no matter how realistic they seem, and the rest of the community will fall for it no matter how unrealistic they seem. Some people are very, very dumb.

Can the dragonbone/bonecrusher necklace be given some offensive stats?

The fact i relate to this is disturbing.

If you use rune lite change your left click to drink for the wine, then drop for the jug. Then you shift double click for a quick drink and drop. 
---
I know it‚Äôs not great but better than nothing
---
Yes it does. It's literally the same staff except it can auto cast the Sara god spell. Also it cannot turn into a toxic staff of the dead.

But they moved clan wars to the gamers grotto when it did, did they not?

That's cute haha!

Yikes feel bad for how you‚Äôll fair in real life if you can‚Äôt get over some mild harassment in a game over the INTERNET when you can literally just click block to remove them from your life entirely.

I mean honestly even if you‚Äôre extremely sensitive I can‚Äôt imagine how you could be this soft, the real world is 1000x tougher than some little bit of harassment over runescape but maybe you haven‚Äôt been thrown for a real loop in life yet.
---
What I read was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too poor to afford tent whip plz give me bone whip‚Äù. Why don‚Äôt you just go make some money? Its 2019 if you can‚Äôt make enough money for a bone whip you got bigger problems. You could literally afk nmz, throw some darts, and alch some shit to get raids stats and spend 20m on scuffed raids gear and make bank. 
---
I didn‚Äôt slay before the update. 60-80 now
---
That's how I treated my major, now I have no degree 
---
Neither of these are RoT members lmfao, and we only control 2.2k. If you were trying to get us banned at least bring up some ddosing stuff like the single community lmfao
---
that's a fucking bullshit argument, with mtx you are able to progress faster in the game so you're at a huge disadvantage right away, not to mention the biggest gripe i had with rs3 is all the crazy cosmetics everywhere, many people begged for an option to toggle other cosmetics off, but jagex obviously doesn't want that as less people would hurt purchases.
---
For avoiding the lightning special on the blue phase you want to run to the middle of the north wall when the lightning gets close to you, then run south which lets you always avoid getting hit by it while also luring the Hydra to the blue vent for when it turns red. I have a sample kill I uploaded here and timestamped dodging the lightning ([https://youtu.be/i3PlvsoXCU0?t=45](https://youtu.be/i3PlvsoXCU0?t=45))  
---
For the flame special attack which you can usually cancel unless rng is a bitch, you want to walk in a straight line when he starts throwing out flames while making sure you don't block yourself off from being able to get in range to melee him when it's finished. Also something to add is that if you do trap yourself inside flames during the special you can run through them since running effectively teleports you two tiles in one tick
---
Sometime from rot complaining about ragging lul
---
Those quests are worth doing anyways. Well all quests are. Boring to start but not that bad once you start doing them.
---
Yet it is true..... RuneScape is better game 
---
Bitterkoekje's dps calculator already exists tho.
---
I just came from RS3 over a month ago and questing is actually the worst part for me bc I've already been through it before. Some of the bigger quests that follow storylines aren't too bad, but I'm slogging through it. Currently at about 200 qp. Slayermusiq makes it not to bad though.
---
Why do people do that instead of clan wars or poh host
---
Four primary reasons:
---
1. There are lots of rushers out for your loot.
---
2. They hybrid.
---
3. They couldn't complete a quest they needed or do pvm on the side
---
4. Accidentally got prayer exp so went all the way 
---
similar way, some bigger companies have call in lines but they only make tickets for you.
---
for example blizzard : [http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/contact.html](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/contact.html)
---
bonecrusher is overrated either way
---
the reason they chose the Zamorakian hasta is because it's the best hasta. Attaching it to an inferior hasta and giving it stats superior to the best hasta would make that drop probably hl to alch value.
---
Sure the dragon hasta would be worth something then, but it's kinda stupid to make an drop that you could get from a chicken (on a Konar task) worth more than one of the characteristic GWD drops
---
You know ironman mode exists, right?
---
Some sort of King of the Skill-Esque event based around a few mini games with a cash prize incentive could be a really cool way to make the content live again for a bit. Maybe you can grind thru so many wins thru cwars/LMS to qualify and the final group is like 200 players. This would give the masses appeal because everyone can qualify and it‚Äôd give the pros appeal because they would qualify

Exactly, i use this method all the time when I have complaints with all sorts of businesses.

---
Do Rot even control the 2k worlds? Pretty sure they only control 2.2k... thats a different discord 
---
Yeah the few times I tried melee early on I ended up trapping myself and went back to ranging, should I just be only trying to make a smaller ‚Äúbox‚Äù than I do with ranging since you start off closer or what? 
---
Thanks 
---
Thanks man, good luck!

Wtf trapple died???

The game would be better and more progressed than it is now if polls had been scrapped. Change my mind

He threatened to kill him. Pretty sure that could be a permanent ban.

not quite that blind.. I just over exaggerated it. It would be nice for the update for those with higher resolution monitors
---
This. G403 is godly. Perfect shape, amazing clicks. The only thing I don't like is the scroll wheel because it sits a little higher than I'm used to. 
---
Agreed, rereading it I can see the poor wording go in either direction.  The additional note of the standard roll being remove was not mentioned in the poll blog, which is why I was inclined to believe they were simply repeating themselves.
---

It's just a recolor. It's only expensive because its  new

It might be alright if not for the earrape.
---
Oopsie!
---
They wish they had plugins. Seriously, they're so jelous about that
---
Duradel is far better xp than konar so I would recommend him. Konar is worth using every 10th task though for the boosted points
---
You replaced a word in your interpretation of what they said, though. They say "the standard drop" not "a standard drop." "This will be in place of **the** standard drop rather than an additional one." That sounds like it's referring to the additional drop given by the Konar drop table instead of the standard monster drops to me. Otherwise, to me, it sounds like they're not changing the additional drop, so would you get two Konar drops, one from a normal drop and a second from the key you bring back to her?
---
I 100% agree that it is worded poorly, though.

I knew this was a joke right away because by the looks of it Sick Nerd doesn't go to the barber. I think he cuts his own hair.
---
revs is team content, obviously it was only a matter of time before someone organized to lock them down.  the issue is more that the 2k worlds are the only worlds where (as an iron) you can't just get perm ragged by pures. You can still get ragged but there aren't many 2k total pures so its a little more manageable.

Hi and welcome to my guide
---
How do you show loot like that?
---
No need to worry, it's easy with semi-decent stats. My HCIM friend with stats in the 70s does it with ease. With 90s stats and decent gear I don't even use any food most of the time
---
(fellow HCIM btw)
---

---
&gt;How do you decide how far to take each QOL change?
---
Since when is that an impossible task? Why do you not apply the same logic to literally every other change or addition? 
---
Also, make it so I can collect ecto tokens without my ghostspeak amulet.
---
Trust me when I say Rs3 is jealous of damn near everything we have.
---
Adding it to temple trekking would be awesome as well as other areas! Agreed! 
---
ah thank you, I looked there but apparently I am blind lol
---
That's an interpretation, but we won't know if it's their interpretation until they either clarify it or the update passes. That's the problem with these ambiguously worded poll questions.
---
but you still use the tool and animation for whatever your doing. its just like the leprechaun but on your belt
---
A person who understands it‚Äôs a stupid idea to stop people getting xp to cater for the minority 
---
Legit, the circlejerk post on the RS3 sub I'm making fun of has tons of people in the comments wishing they had plugins.
---
The game is just one big One Small Favour quest
---
Why? It gives no XP/gp
---
That's exactly what they want you to think!
---
I have every herb, ore, bar, log, arrow, bolt and a very extensive farm tab and still have space. You can clean a lot of stuff out if you try more.
---
Can we bring rune h platelegs and playebody in the game . Or some new armour for zerks new content either for end game max or for 1 def pures
---
thank god my membership is still only $5
---
&gt;My point is that if you start to take away mechanics, where do you stop? Why have run energy, tools, teleport spell costs, etc?
---
You're not offering any answers or clarification at all, you can't just present the slippery slope and act like that's that. Why should they stop at where they currently are? 
---
I second Noobs Playin! Im a mid level noob and its a great chill clan chat, no dicks. Come say hi üòã

How
---
Ok pal
---
Nice! Having higher magic increases your magic defence, so its useful to have for fighting mages.
---
I'll give runelite a go! For mobile it's just the Jagex one, right?
---

---
The exp is no where near as good as the Chaos Altar. And how many charges for your bone crusher do you need? It takes all of 10 seconds to get like a thousand charges on your bone crusher. 
---
why the fuck would my brand new whip + tent only have half charges, terrible idea
---
It's rare and can be used for pking for some extra risk so it's great.
---
I think if you drop the legs 2 claim the legs 3 then pick up the legs 2 it works. Not 100% though
---
Ohhhh that makes sense. Do you fight a lot of mages? 
---
My only account is a maxed rigour tank and I only PK so I never bothered with b gloves for 1 extra range bonus

I do want blue Ava‚Äôs but I‚Äôll probably never do ds2 either

Clicked this expecting coyppasta.

Slightly devalues using npc contact from LM spell book to get a new taks as well. Only slightly though. 
---
200 qp is like just hitting 93 in a skill when you're aiming for 99 lol good luck my dude
---
I absolutely would not play without runelite or osbuddy.
---
Tons of features that make things nice, but the main ones like showing the name of drops on the ground are essential. I'm not spending half my time right clicking piles to make sure I don't miss a ranarr seed or something. 
---
If you are only going from 36 to 43 and need to save money then use just use big bones on a gilded altar.  You'll only need ~400ish.  It takes a bit longer but is much cheaper than higher level bones.  
---
If you don't know what I mean by gilded altar, go to world 330 and go to the house portal in Rimmington.  Somebody there will be hosting which means you can right click the portal and type their name in to go to their house.  OIffering bones there will give you like 3.5x the xp.  
---
Note all of your bones as there is an NPC just outside the portal named Phials who will un-note your bones for you making for quick trips.  Just bring like 20k in cash because he charges a small fee and your stack of bones, then you have 26 inventory spots to fill with un-noted bones.
---
It's not, you just won't see their customer support tickets because they're not public. I've had to context jagex on 3 separate occasions about my account security and payments and I got a response within 24 hours all 3 times.
---
Pen tablet is great for fast and precise motion, such as tick manipulation!

You should use cash for bonds and stake with that.

You can make decent money planting Yanillian hops, as they're used to protect Mahogany Tree's on Fossil Island. Over 100k a run. Really easy to run as well. They're the only things keeping those patches from being dead content though.

Patch 1: Chronicle -&gt; Run South
---
Patch 2: Fairy Ring ALS -&gt; North out of McGrubors Woods

Patch 3: Yanille Teleport (NMZ Tele, Watchtower, Yanille Tele, Redirected house tab)

Patch 4: Castle Wars -&gt; Bank various equipment -&gt; Hot air balloon to Entrana

This is exactly what I do: cactus as well

I have yet to see Raid bots, and any high-requirement bossing bots (Only reason zulrah is botted is because it barely has any reqs, if the zulrahbot gets banned, they make a new one within a day.)
---

---
well this discussion didn't go so well. Try again in another 2 months?
---
Everyone should feel the frustration my friend went through. Imagine getting a false positive from the bot detection system, make a forum post to explain your situation, to only get dismissed by mods and flamed by the entire community for botting even though it was a false positive. Its honestly infuriating to see people replying to jmod comments praising them for their reddit presence. Jagex should be raked over the coals again and again for using a public forum like reddit as customer support. How can you support the amount of players osrs has concurrently, and have such a shit customer service portal? Honestly unacceptable. The worst part? They have higher priority on new game content over working on account security or putting together a better customer service portal. For Jagex it's all about bringing in new players, not retaining the ones you have.

Sorry again bro

Hide poll results lmao

What the fuck man
---
Same. I pumped a bunch of bonds in the game and stopped when they went down to almost 2 mil. Scares me knowing that I might have to deal with customer support. 
---
The more I hear people talking about this, the more excited I get about it. There could be so many great ideas for end-game content that employ skills rather than combat. I'd love to see skilling borrow some things from PvM, such as genuinely difficult activities, rare drops, risk, etc.

---
I agree partially here. I feel as though a blanket increase on the hop limit is needed, not just for wildy. They added more worlds because of the influx of new players, a logical step and was greatly needed. 
---
The problem is that if you get to the spot you want to set up in and it's full, you often have to hop and hop and hop until you find an empty one.
---
I don't know exactly how much it should be increased, but 15 over 15 (wait is this right? I thought it was 15 over 5 mins) is too low. It's frustrating trying to find a slayer spot when on a konar task and you need to wait at the log in screen to find an empty world. That or you need to crash someone which is just shitty. 
---
Poll passed therefore the community wants it or is at least okay with it. I don't see the problem. 
---
&gt;"Why is death a mechanic in the game at all? Just tele to lumby when you hit 0 hp if you like that lol!"

The whole phantom chord line are easily the best mice I've tried. The sensor is very accurate and it essentially feels wireless. I still can't believe other manufacturers haven't caught on to the chord design yet. 
---
It looks real nice with my mining cape. It's a nice fashionscape option and imo the best looking of all the mystic colors so far. Price will likely stabilize soon, I wasnt able to buy it anywhere near market price in the days following the update.
---
i never said it was the same. im saying some kills are probably staged.
---
we KNOW that some kills are donations already. so you were wrong on that part.

now framed has another vid out full of people not protecting items? and he got the first mobile pk in the world ;) good thing he plays 30 hours a day so he finds these guys

There was a post of a guy with almost max cash stack and tons of expensive items. Good password, 2fa, everything. Still got hacked. Jagex needs to hire better employees. 
---
They could already be rigging polls and you just feel safe that they‚Äôre not because you can see poll results. Hiding poll results until after it closes won‚Äôt change anything except ridding you of a false sense of security.
---
If you could make it so when you have all your selections set, click a button and it adds the dps, accuracy, etc to a compare list. I'm guessing with the current setup you can compare two setups? But being able to compare more would be useful. One thing I find with the popular excel spreadsheet everyone uses is if I want to compare two melee setups, then two range setups, then one of those range vs melee setups, there's a lot of changing 
---
Allow me to give some insight to this.
---
I am the person flaming in those pictures, and can tell you this is because the user who took these pictures (RSN: Slay Furdays)
---
has been 1 item ragging the 2k worlds for 10 hours a day over a week now. He is purposely disrupting the game for hundreds of pvmers and greets us with the same kind of treatment.
---
It's in my experience, that if someone is going to try and break you they are to be met with the same tactics brought upon themselves in full force. This user has been relentless in attempting to harm our community, and so I will respond with fury.
---
Your first goal IMO should be to complete all free to play quests. Do not underestimate the value of questing even if you find it boring. A long term goal path for quests would be: dragon slayer &gt; lost city &gt; monkey madness &gt; recipe for disaster. There are so many resources out there so be sure to use the wiki and YouTube frequently. Good luck!

I have to agree on this. People want to make RS3 the boogeyman while abusing the fuck out of their own ezscape additions. Bossing is an utter joke when you have the client telling you exactly where to stand and when to move. NMZ, the constant power creep of items and mob drops, etc. are just as pathetic as the issues in RS3.
---
Thanks I hate it

Yep ive practically given up on ever recovering my main account...

Lmfaooo

Probably can't afford membership and feels elite by maintaining bonds.

Lol what? Even with oak dungeon doors you're pressing 2 keys...how hard is it? It's not even that intensive compared to tick manipulation methods.

I dont see how these two things are supposed to be unrelated. It's easy to get hacked BECAUSE Jagex sucks.

Oh I do, petition to not have them take 16 hours.

Can you add hydra to duradels task list?

Don't worry, we will get them to change the item to something more fitting. But right now the drops are even more artificial then this method. 
---
Can any Runescape Mods answer any of my questions?

I would like to know if I am still safe on my other accounts if I do stake again, gain a massive amount of GP or a friend gives me 500m? Or is it just going to be a immediate red flag everytime from now on?.. which basically ruins my OSRS career.

I‚Äôm skiller, and when a PvM player can get more resource and gold than a skiller, I personaly belive the game is moving in wrong direction.

Seaweed spores are already so easy to get, you can literally get them on the ground. I would be pissed if I got a seaweed spore instead of a magic seed. Now if they replace the hop seeds with white Lilly and seaweed, that would be better since unlike the hop seeds they have a farming purpose. Just adding them to the seed pack is not a good idea.

Can you guys make the Thammaron Sceptre from Revs cast a unique spell using only ether and is 4-tick attack so that it's not so expensive to use and risk runes in the wilderness? Making it decent for killing revs and wilderness mobs is the entire point of the staff and right now no one uses it. 
---
It's how the bow and mace work but doesn't make any sense that the staff is so unlike the other two. 
---
That‚Äôs fine yeah. Generally unless your alt is harming game integrity by using a bug or something it‚Äôs find
---
/u/JagexGambit, do you mind clarifying this question?

Let's not pretend everything up until 2012 was great. I personally didn't like HD graphics, summoning was shit, and dungeoneering wasnt great. Also the entire wildy removal debacle. 
---
Fuck trump and racists.

The ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù isn‚Äôt what keeps bots away. It‚Äôs the requirements.

They aren't, but obviously they need to clarify because dumb people don't understand poll questions
---
At some point, you mentioned that alchemical hydra would be better gp/hr than vorkath &amp; zulrah. How do you compute the gp/hr of bosses?  
---
Gp/hr is based on three inputs - quantity of drops, value of drops, and kills per hour.  
---
Obviously jmods have access to the exact drop tables so you know the *quantity* of items received, but for alchemical hydra, (currently) over half the gp per kill comes from uniques (claw is 83m as of writting, and is an estimated 1:1000 drop, so 83k/kill from claw on average). In order to conclude that alchemical hydra is better gp/hr than vorkath and zulrah, you would need to put values on these uniques. *Roughly how do you guys estimate what the values on these uniques are?*  
---
Also - kills/hr. How do you estimate how many kills per hour players can realistically obtain?
---
I love u
---
Really? I‚Äôve honestly never had a bad experience with their customer service. Anytime I‚Äôve had to deal w them it‚Äôs because I accidentally forgot to cancel the billing cycle for membership.
---
For example they aren‚Äôt obligated to give you a refund for cancelling your membership, but I‚Äôve gotten a refund every time I‚Äôve asked for one.
---
Amazing job, man! Love the style
---
Yeah maybe don‚Äôt use the n word lol
---
Ah, guess I missed that =]
---
I mean they would obviously have to alter it in order to deduct charges instead of destroying it. As for the standing at a sand pit, yes, but one of the features of the bottomless compost bucket is that each compost added counts as two so it would double the speed of collecting sand.
---
Holy shit. This is gold
---
You think Jagex has more than a million people on their servers? Aww how cute
---
I meant if someone is banned for no reason and they can't get their account back. If someone gets banned legitimately then that's fair.
---
yeah im with this guy. Would have to apply this to all the guilds then I feel like, athough with the teirs it makes a little more sense, but im still against.

I once simply forgot my password and it took me nearly 3 months to recover the account. I had all the information, access to the email and used the same IP and all that and they still didnt accept my recovery questions. I had to contact customer support by email and after bugging the fuck out of them for nearly 3 months they finally allowed me back on my account.
---
It wasnt hacked or anything, I just quit playing for like 2 years and couldn't remember the password because it was an unusual one that I managed to forget it.
---
That's not their fault, but the 3 months it took to finally get a reply is.

I wanted access to content that mains would, so I made a new account. In one month I‚Äôve got graceful, bglove, and some decent melee stats.

The way I see it, you went thru all of the quests / bosses / content in a harder mode with way less defense, so why devalue that by making a main? 
---
You can make plenty of money on your zerk to fuel a main. Once the main takes over as the money maker, you‚Äôll always have a really good zerk to go back to if you get an itch to pk

Yes you are, because you are taking a totalitarian stance to your argument rather than providing any useful insight as to why you are correct as well as having a mental breakdown and instantly throwing anyone who would say something like that for any circumstance whatsoever in the "bad apple" bin.

You're now attempting to cling to any hope of defending yourself with a desperate "I'm right, you're a loser just accept it".

Come argue when you get rid of your God complex and accept the fact that you are triggered and have a mental disorder to take your view to the extremes you're demonstrating.

I had an original white ultralight, and while that was still incredibly nice because of the weight, the chord on it was especially stiff compared to other mice.

I think you have to get in contact with certain clans which will  swap gold from RS3 to OSRS for you. As far as I'm aware, there's not a feature in-game that allows you to do the swap.
---
I think it will probably cost between 5-8 RS3 gold to get 1 OSRS gold, depending on who you contact. Just be cautious, as some clans may not be legit, and they could potentially just take your money and run.

Can the slayer helmet have a toggle ability to switch between different colors you have unlocked? It would be a quality of life change and would save some bank space.

Seemed to me like another bash of rs3 for the circlejerk. It's true that worlds can be pretty quiet, but that's whatever for me. Hopefully mobile does to rs3 what it did for osrs. Mining and smithing rework already has bumped player counts to numbers previously only seen during dxp weekends, which is a good sign.

Like what? The only things I can really think of from 07-12 that are missed are quests.. which granted don't make sense to me. Fairytale 3? Elemental Workshops 3? The rest of the Goblin series? Kinda feels like quests are the big thing missing from OSRS right now.

You like the work (membership), but don't want to pay for it (with real money), so someone else buys the painting at the normal price. You then do an excessive amount of extra work (grinding steel bars at blast furnace, maybe?) for that someone else until that someone else gives you the painting.
---
It's still not nearly that simple, but most people just have an excess of free time to play the game, so they'd rather grind out in game money to give to someone else who then gives the money to Jagex to pay for their membership.

I mean, f2p is technically just the demo for the full game, so of course there are strong incentives towards membership. At least we have access to energy potions now, so we can technically restore stamina. Its just limited, but better than nothing definitely.

Aww yisssss, glad you like it! I use ReactJS with Redux to make this. I used a few libraries as well for certain parts, such as react-semantic-ui for the dropdowns and popups, and I used mathjs to handle the calculations. Overkill calculations got quite large, to the point that some of the numbers were too big for a regular int. Mathjs uses modified operations that utilize strings instead of numbers which extends the size you can work with. I sent you the link, thanks!

I'd probably switch if I could go to one reddit post once in a while and not see people trash talking rs3.  Yeah great it has mtx fine, but that doesn't make it a shit game.  The pvm is still fun and there's plenty of fun things in it.
---
Please name them so I can explain to you how wrong you are. Additionally prayer isn't even close to the same thing since there is no stackable infinite 1 item prayer source in the game like there is purple sweets

Steam does this with steam inventory items. Every item has a unique ID. It'd be harder for RS as you said but definitely a cool solution.

I really don‚Äôt need this, I‚Äôve really tried, please take your comments elsewhere

Hopefully they explain it clearly so everyone can be on the same page. If people happen to be voting for something while misunderstanding it, it will just create a lot of bad PR and reddit drama. Sort of like the Rev Caves where everyone originally voted "no" on the uniques, so instead of new uniques, we got alchables.

Also consider using points to skip certain tasks like black dragons or ents. 
---
Thank you for the suggestions! I'll make sure to edit those. Honestly, the max sets were mostly because every time I made a change to the code for something my hotloader would reload the page and remove my selections. It was annoying me so I googled "max osrs gear" and used the first things I saw, haha. For now, I can add what you suggested, and in the future I'd rather have customizable presets, so that users can input the gear they actually have (especially cool for ironmen who don't have "standard" loadouts). I think it should be easy by just saving it on a text file locally and load from it as well. Thank you for the suggestions though!
---
Exactly!! So PLEASE vote NO and get everyone you know to vote NO on it! It's currently winning and we cannot let it pass.

This happens a lot and there is no cure for it to my knowledge. They lock us in with emails that don‚Äôt withstand the test of time and without the email then what? Account doesn‚Äôt really exist without it. I personally am not a fan of any of their new ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù. And to be honest with you it‚Äôs trash. My buddy ‚Äúhacked‚Äù me as a prank, never knew my password and set up an authenticater on HIS email. Idk why they left recovery questions in the dirt for a broken system
---
Thank you this does not improve my def tho right? And what level should I take this quest on? Right now? Also should I improve my atk if I'm going for a strength pure build?
---
Ah, quite right, my apologies. I took DPS to mean max hit instead of damage per second, and I guess each enemy has its own defence and that's why that options there. 
---
There is buy the boots are fast enough to get around
---
Mobile is out so I dont think it would be bad
---
Depends on your capability to grind the same thing consistently. Personally I get bored of doing the same thing after some time and need to switch it up, so going between GWD, Zulrah, and slayer would be a decent way to build the cash stack up 
---
For the love of god please. 
---
It's a gigantic problem in this game. PvM is just making skilling more and more useless every update for non-ironmen. Perhaps some high level challenging mini games with good rewards. I think people would get behind that. 
---
This was my favorite grind. The excitement of getting my beloved dragon defender and facing down those massive lvl 101 cyclopses as a lvl 70 was amazing. 
---
Get fucked idiot 
---
Ahh, I see. Yea that would be pretty neat to just take the "important" information and save it somewhere like a list and then maybe pop up a screen with 5 or 6 different "loadouts" that shows their damage output and all that jazz. Then if you click one it can change your selections to that? 
---
Great idea, definitely something I'll write down to look into. 
---
You're mad cause I hit the nail on the head and your dumb ass probably got fucked over.

It fits the game better. Its like how you have 3 godsword shards instead of just dropping the godsword itself.

I can see if the library I used for dropdowns allows me to change this property. If not though, they're searchable so you should be able to get it down to a few items fairly quickly with a search term, right? Or are you still finding that the options you are given after entering a search term are too many?

I‚Äôm glad you understand. It‚Äôs just so ironic that this is gonna be the end of my account. I was sketched out enabling it in the first place, and it was for the fucking fancy boots. Thanks jagex. Whatever happens I‚Äôll always love this game, and jagex, but what a shitty way to go..

It is happening to cc's with any amount of players in it, you can ask anyone in pvm/pvp clan, it's fairly well known

I mean i would probly chin some of the last levels at least
---
You can change the size of your exp drops by right clicking the xp orb in game and you can customize the color with runelite
---
A good tip is to use w30 and set your house tele outside (you can also make friend house the left click option in runelite)
---
That way u can use all the end game teles without the reqs, also pool and fairyrings

My app  actually does take overkill into account, and it does so on the fly. I definitely have thought about pre-calculating the numbers in the future though, because it would take a lot of the stress off the app when changing gear and such. As you said, it's not impossible it's just a bit of a pain but I'll most likely do it because the gain in speed will allow me to add other calculations without slowing it down. I'd eventually like to be able to "optimize" but that would require iterating through selections for every slot and finding the "best" then showing the user what it found. It could be optimized for xp/hr, or dps, or a certain defensive stat, etc....   I have looked at those threads you linked but the way I do it is to literally simulate every possible combination of hits that would lead to the death of an enemy. Then I calculate the "odds" of each of those outcomes and average to get "average hits to death". Combined with attack speed and the monster HP, this gives a pretty accurate estimate of the actual damage being dealt to enemies over time. I say estimate because even though I'm using a library allowing me to work with very large numbers (like max hit \^monsterHP ) sized numbers, you still have to pick significant figures so that you don't murder performance. I picked 200, which I believe makes any sort of rounding negligible for most practical purposes.

Yeah that's not actually too bad when searching. 
---
When you click on a blank equipment slot and click off, it locks in the first item (e.g. bronze platebody), it would be nice to remove this.
---
Also if you can change the potion/prayer hover-over names so they are neater, or if it's possible to have assigned names like "Eagle Eye +15% ranged accuracy"
---
Overall the usability of it is amazing, it's just in dire need of a better aesthetic in the long term.

That sounds like a good update to me. Maybe a brew the boosts RC by 1 and a mature by 2

I definitely designed it with only PC in mind currently. I do want to have a check for screen width (to detect mobile users) and have an alternative layout that's not so broken, but it will take me some time to get that together. Thank you for your suggestion though!
---
App froze so I closed and re-opened. The UI did not reload properly and has missing assets: chat box, chat box buttons, status orbs, and the world map button. However, the missing chat buttons were really nice. Would be awesome to have an option to hide chat buttons to clean up the screen a bit.

Ahh, I see. Thank you for your reply! :)
---
Seems logical, but how will jagex be able to track the money? Say they drop trade it, ‚Äústake‚Äù it, get ‚Äúpk‚Äôed‚Äù. You can‚Äôt trace everything. You can certainly ban the hacker, but you can‚Äôt ban seemingly innocent players.
---
I love osrs and all but the one thing rs3 will have is good ass fucking lore. Shits so god damn juicy but OS can't do that due to smaller teams unfortunately. So many interesting characters and you look them up and half the time there isn't even a character model. 
---
Right? There's so much opportunity for a skill to bring something awesome to the table. 
---
Like RuneScape is the only Medieval RPG I can think of where SMITHING is a completely worthless venture. I want to be a big badass blacksmith that makes weapons worthy of a god to wield, something to show off I'm committed to my craft and chose to work a forge over killing dragons. That's the fantasy RPG I can get behind.
---
f2p became a thing
---
You dont see that black hole in the ground behind me?
---
The really shitty thing with PVP is if it got QoL updates to make it more accessible to players it would be 100x times more popular but the bar of entry is insanely high right now and their is no easy way to learn even if you meet it. 
---
I get where you're coming from, but 3rd party by no means "play the game for you"
---
Sure there was a point when it did(it's basically do zulrah for you), but jagex came down on that and made then simplify a lot of shit
---
Like b4 farming timers would be able to use the game to tell if ur plants r diseased or dead or fully grown, now it's just a simple timer that starts when it sees a plant and what grow stage it's jn. It used to pull invisible data and use that, but thats unfair
---
I'm a cheap bastard so before i grinded out 99 cons i used dust &amp; fire runes and used home tele for the ones that needed water runes lol
---
Nice constructive argument. Game will be dead in two years. 
---
How does this scam works ? You show him 60 m in trade window and then something ?
---
Yep. Other "gods" squabbling forced our one true lord and savior to be like "aw hell no" and fuck their shit up.
---
We also need to campaign this "NO TO Q16" on public roads
---
Should have a community manager tbh. Most games do these days.
---
Found an old graph that levels events in the game, it looks like that's around the time GE was implemented too.
---
Wow. Very low effort meme

That hole in the ground behind me.

Got you, bro. I sent it.

Would be interested in seeing the github and possibly contributing if you‚Äôre open to it
---
It's impossible up to a point. If you don't get carried away it's very possible
---
Okay
---
Nope, they can only note tradable items. 
---
This is exactly why Jagex had to implement the [item incinerator](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Item_Incinerator) in the bank. So can people could easily get rid of large stacks of untradable items, like Serum 207s.
---
This. I had the same problem with my authenticator and email. And i got it back after putting a other email and recover my acount. It only took a couple hours lol. It helped me because i had put my private transaction info in the recovery system from when i bought a bond.
---
(Sorry for my english)
---
I can make so many comparisons to RuneScape and having a 9-5 
---
You're getting ~80-100 metal dragon tasks, killing them all, and banking all the bones within 30 minutes?
---
You're right, making playing as an ironman actually fixes the "problem" whereas your suggestions do not. 
---
9/11 was an inside job
---
Ignore this piece of shit, we do care buddy. Good job on the video.
---
Purely attack and str. You can do it at level 3, easy quest and quick xp. I‚Äôd just finish waterfall, get 40 attack for scim or sabre and then you can get whatever strength you want after that. 
---
They can backtrace the IP that logged into my account. Ban the primary account that is used on that IP. If they have trade logs they could check those. My character wasnt PK‚Äôd. Untradable gear was still on, they disassembled my slayer mask and took the black mask. Other components were still in inventory. 
---
Anyone whatcha guy spend like 3 grand to max ah account off I think they were lava lamps?  Like 12 hours to max 
---
Uhhh, you really don't know what you're talking about

Youre probably right, i didnt look too far into it. Was just a thought

I find it funny all the people who hate you then come ride your dick once you post
---
Just to clarify I dislike you
---
I think this tasks is stupid. It's like they forgot that there are only brutals there when they added this to her low level task list
---
You are right on that system part as it when I just tested it, it gave me the same error message. 
---
Twisted shortbow
---
no, i would rather deal with inflated prices then deal with a ge tax.
---
Wtf type of hax lol. Im almost 100 barrows kc with 2 pieces lmao rigged hahaha nice
---
Do all your questing first. Aim for mith gloves and check the quest rewards making sure you dont get any def xp. Waterfall quest will give you 30atk &amp; 30str from lvl 1. As a pure you cand decide on 50atk,60atk,or75atk depending on what spec weapons you want to play with. Then base your str off what combat you would want to "max" at. 75atk 99str 52pray pure is 88combat. 
---
This is my opinion, but in 2014 Warlords of Draenor was released (took until about 2015 for people to see the shittiness that expansion was. Late 2018 saw the same thing with Battle for Azeroth. 
---
Each of these WoW expansions were/are some of the worst expansions ever put out by Blizzard. The ~huge~ spike from the mobile release was helped by god awful current WoW expansion.
---
That's just my two cents
---
My account is safe because I don't talk to anybody 
---
Repost within 10 minutes or else your mother will get deadly ill.
---
But Jagex staff and income IS limited. They aren't making incredible amounts off of OSRS to warrant huge customer support staff. And even then, the customer support staff has to check with the people already on the player punishment/banning staff about the ban. Then, you have to hire more of those because of limited man hours.
---
The other alternative is don't try to use the tech they have to mass ban bots/suspected RWTers.
---
Or, they introduce more MTX to increase the revenue, then increase customer support.
---
Or we could cut down on updates and content and focus solely on customer support so this doesn't happen.
---
OSRS is pretty big, but the funding and profits aren't enough to make things flawless.
---
2% isn't perfect, and no doubt there is room to improve the way customer support is run. But given the state of the game and the revenue, it's way healthier to focus on the 99.999% of the players that will never have to be in that situation.
---
It's a budget thing.
---
Thats a little harder because its items. If they sold the items after traded they cant take them from people who bought them on the GE. And giving you the cash they got from the items doesnt help and Iron Man. Sorry dude.. 
---
Why are you so upset over a video game lmfao
---
i dislike you
---
&gt;For now, contracts arent scaled on how long the plant takes to grow, just on the difficulty of the contract. However I believe they are polling to make it based on time it takes to grow 
---
Thank fuck for that, I keep getting easy contracts on my iron to grow cacti which takes 9 hours
---
I'll look into that functionality on the dropdowns, but I think I can change that. I agree it's annoying if you misclick and it changes on you. 
---
As for the hover over names, I agree it could use something nicer. I used the default html "title" property to give some sort of feedback for people who may not know the prayers/potions super well, but later on I found a popup library that lets you use any html you want for the popup, which means you can make it look super nice and vivid. I will use this to replace those buttons eventually. 
---
Thank you so much for your kind words about it so far. I'm definitely more of a coder than I am a designer, so I know it could use a lot of aesthetic help and I hope that people like you are nice enough to make suggestions and help me out. It definitely doesn't fall on deaf ears, I need all the help I can get when it comes to stuff like that. 
---
Thanks again!
---
Those are actual coins 
---
I did the google search ;(
---
I always do dragon bones, since those don't cost too much (~100k for 39). I did dailies for at least a year and a half, but only got elite for max 6 months (to put things in perspective). I also got 1.5m bonecrusher charges from it, which is nice.
---
No it doesn't. You can't trade as an ironman....
---
No.
---
I finished 100 molch pearls and grabbed my pearl fishing rod.  A little bit disappointed, though. I was hoping to make it an oily pearl fishing rod as the blog post said we would be able to do.  However, it does not work. You do get a customized error, your character will say "I probably don't want to oil this rod up..." Boy, is he wrong.
---
I did report it as a bug but I don‚Äôt know if it was intentional or not. Was really looking forward to using this baby on infernal eels.

gf account
---
I would like this link as well, looks impressive. :)
---
So what you're saying is that the polling system is working and we're getting good content in the game? 
---
Both Konar and farming contracts had to be polled... and yet you're agreeing with OP. 
---
Oh....is that why Skilling is extremely profitable? 
---
You could also use a most/lava battlestaff and pop those soul runes in your pouch
---
To be honest, I was fine, even if a little disappointed, with the Alchemical Hydra's difficulty at release but it seems it just keeps getting easier i.e. this new agility shortcut and not having to wear the special boots with the elite diary. To get to grotesque guardians you still have to go past Abberant Spectres, I don't know why Hydra is any different and gets a shortcut meanwhile GGs doesn't.
---
Yeah imagine actually following the story and working out what to do for yourself.

You know quest guides were originally created so the 8 year olds that can't read could complete quests too?
---
Seed vault devalue my seed box
---
Im suprised you have kept playing RS3 for that long. How does it feel to see more than 3 people at the G.E. L0l.
---
no whats even more cringe is those post saying my friend died today lets take a picture of our rs chars in a Church yeah im pretty sure you friends was everyone to remember him as the guy who played a 18 year old game
---
She looks hot, is she available?
---
Jagex and making game crippling decisions, name a more iconic duo
---
That 70 rc is more impressive than anything else, holy fuck man
---
I don‚Äôt think my keyboard is able to rebound keys but I am getting a mechanical keyboard soon so I hope that has rebindable keys. Yeah what you described sounds so much better than AHKs as well.

Dude, fuck off. For me it was a huge achievement, I saved up to make it easier for myself bought a blowpipe and did it. Sure it wasn't that hard, but there aren't many super hard things in RS outside of PvP. It felt like a real accomplishment and it was my first boss ever.
---
Now I don't got posting to the sub about it, but for my friends group we all go nuts for each other when one of us gets there.
---
Aren't the unlock-able emotes needed for elite and master clues?
---
Genie, Mr. Mordaut, maze and Jekyll are all fantastic randoms. 
---
Can I have a look? :o
---
Yikes
---
I bet some of the Rs3 mods are deluded enough to think their version of mobile will have the same effect
---
RuneLite is great as long as you turn off a lot of the plugins. Most of them are just stupid. But it has some I wouldn't live without, like chat history (keeps showing chat when you world hop), stretched mode (I can actually see the UI on a 1080p monitor without putting on my glasses), GPU rendering (big FPS boost) and old 2005 UI.

REEEEEEE

gf wife

The place of runescape. It looks very out of place inside the game. It wouldn‚Äôt fit anywhere else because it looks bad.
---
\&gt;thinking I'm being anything close to serious
---
that's good to know. i was definitely under the impression that hard clue scrolls would have more valuable rewards than this? but i may be wrong
---
If it's taken them until now to leave over MTX, they have a very high tolerance for it.
---
Which ones are still offered?
---
Indeed :P. It doesn‚Äôt bother me If a screenshot Isnt taken probably. But for some people it seems to  care üôà
---
Going for my first attempt at Jad. I've got 70 ranged, 61 def, 63 prayer, full ancient d'hide, archers ring, avas accumulator, ammy of fury, and rcb. 
---
I know that 75+ ranged and blowpipe is optimal, but can I tackle this with my current setup?
---
Rodger that - will regroup and reapproach, Captain!
---
This is why I amethyst mine.
---
But why NO to it as well? What does it matter either way? 
---
I used to annoy my mum as a kid so much telling her all the different things I was cooking in Runescape. Different varieties of fish, all the cool gnome food (RIP anyone ever bothering to make any of that these days, XP waste I guess), etc.
---
I‚Äôm new to mobile, but used to play pre eoc. How do you do construction away from your house? You used to be able to make items in like a noted form instead on installed in your house. 
---
From what level will it increase? What bosses do you suggest with my stats?
---
The only thing I'll ever be jealous of RS3 for.
---
tob is 10m/hr lol 
---
Ultra fertile is not equivalent to 1 super compost, its equivalent to one ultra compost. They give the same effect. 
---
same, just 1920x1080. I'm a little jelly.
---
What do you mean with that?
---
It has the graphics and the MTX and is more forgiving to players. It will be good for the younger demographic who is used to mobile gaming.
---
Hi can bank pin number size be increased? Heres my non artist rendering: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aipo0x/can_the_bank_pin_screen_get_a_update_so_its/
---
No such thing in osrs. 
---
If you have 75 ranged blow pipe does work on these things. 
---
tbh i think alot of people here dreamed about konar and i can tell you it wasn't about slayer monster.....
---
The game is 2007scape because it was the *closest backup they had to 2006*. They wanted 2006, but couldn't get it, because of the huge demand for the 2006scape private server proved that there would be demand for an old school style game.
---
OSRS is not 'non-EOC scape'. It's meant to be in the style of the game of 2005-2007. 
---

aww shit thank you for telling me, I have pearls in my bank that I never spent. One thing I noticed was that the october post mentioned the oily rod being possible, while the january post did not.  It could seem that they just forgot or didn't bother mentioning it, but now that it's known to not be possible, what a shame
---
Can herb patches in Chambers of Xeric scale up with the amount of people in the raid? For example, for each additional Olm phase, add another patch to farm herbs in. This will help significantly with the time it takes for large groups to prepare for the final Olm fight.

seercull

Lmao
---
You can easily do bandos I've made 100m+ from that alone. And I have 85 Slayer and I can usually make at least 5m a day from doing just slayer
---
Only 6 hours? pffff the sneaking around in mm2 takes longer than that
---
Got mine at 30m xp.  Got my second before 31m
---
Is it possible to introduce a method
---
 to 
---
make bank item placeholders without the actual item itself.
---
How do you have the level to kill Thermie and only 995 kraken kills? That‚Äôs some booty rng 
---
So the Abyssal Sire, The Overseer, The Abyss, Abyssal whip and Abyssal demons looks like they're not from RuneScape?
---
So it‚Äôs just adding an extra step for using Konar To get her loot? 
---
They are p2p
---
Finally an intelligent comment
