That feeling when you realize the 5 other people at zulrah are all bots
---
---
---
Bursting jellies for hard clues is a lot more sustainable than magpies (it is actually profitable), which can fund the other tiers
---
Tbh a rly nice suggestion. I believe lots of people wanted void quests in osrs like back in the rs2 days, so a good way to implement that and this weapon. But I wouldn’t want this sword to be available for free or reclaim for 750k like it used to in rs2. It has to be a extremely rare drop from the new boss the pest queen or something like that. Shame some people don’t think any further and jus think ‘Korasi sword bad’, with right adjustments it can be rly good content.
---
Although if you are optimizing for prayer vestment robes would be better.
---
This is a game you are suppose to have fun at least you feel proud about milestones you hit in game while people who cheat most likely do not enjoy it. As much 🙂
---
I wonder how absolutely massive that person's dick is
---
Lol, I did the same grind and got pretty much that exact reward, though I only spent 14m from 72 to 82 herb.
---
Far from it ;)
---
Woah, holy shit, people are human beings and have opinions on things they see? Holy fucking shit.
---
This would make it so everyone at work doesn’t have to know I’m a virgin:)
---
He did the math.

720kc to finish vorkath personally. Great boss but dang dude. 9k gl
---
Oh gee, let me just update Jagex's database so that hackers can't recover my account due to information gathered during a database leak.
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Ranching sounds really cool I saw a post about it before. Like maybe getting benefits from different animals or such things :)
---
Man I’m just telling you what they said lol if you have questions watch the Q&amp;a
---
The majority of stuff in the ongoing LMS poll and this BH poll will fail.

Looking forward to a massive spare of *integrity changes* in the near future.
---
Because every other company requires 2fa to access the account page that disables the 2fa. Jamflex let's you completely get around 2fa by just logging into the website and turning it off for the game.
---
You got a problem with gingers!
---
Nice neighborhood. Guarantee my neighbors would snag it.
---
muh graphics
---
It's not incorrectly, (source, work for a company sending out a lot of emails in response). Professionally the term seems to be despatched in terms of on behalf of a company whereas in terms of person to person dispatched seems to work. Although dispatched is the original UK term and despatched is an Americanism.

New quest idea, the hunt for sarachnisman or veninatisman

My grind was from 55 lol. Had a few other steps that factored into the cost but at least 90% was from shitty ass herb. ~sigh

I'm training farming but don't have much money left after 99 pray.. got like 10m left to spend

God forbid mage gets a decent armour after osrs was released. All mage armours are shit man just look at those stats and compare them to dhide/rune. Mage is bottom trash armour un bote accuracy and defence. Stop asking for a nerf please.

Literally a toaster can get 50 FPS in this game 
---
I play 2 accs at once and use 7% cpu on 1 core of 12
---
i think it works in PvP as well, but im not sure how long the timer is. it took me around a minute or a minute and a half of waiting for him to xlog, not sure when he closed his client though but it felt like i was waiting there for 3 minutes.
---
most likely enough time to kill someone in a PvP situation, unless you happen to be boxing a monster that won't kill you, or you won't kill fast.
---
Maybe you should stop giving out personal information so easily then like your birth date. Probably social engineered for recovery questions/details
---
it's been 2 months you stupid asshole
---
Try getting someone from Jagex to respond to using only their website. It is easier to max your account than it is to receive any customer support.
---
If the Zuriel's staff passes the poll, will you consider adding miasmic barrage to the game?
---
Join a clan, search the OSRS forums.
---
The No req. Clans are usually full of helpful people.
---
depends on complexity, usually 50-80$ for ME, This took about 5-7 
---
hours.
---
It was fun but horribly imbalanced
---
Nah it could’ve been a lot worse. I wasn’t expecting 3a or anything, but was hoping it would come out to 10-15m or so to kinda offset the cost.
---
Bandos KC? I'm at 1250 and still hunting a pair of spare boots for master clues
---
How is this not a balance of limitations?  Its a balance of an ironman and a regular account.
---
Quest cape unlocks a loooot of items and content, you’ll thank yourself later!
---
Even if they don't remove the shop's gold ore, it would be nice to see Dondakan's mine improved. Ir does feature gold veins in the wall; it would be neat if they had multiple ore per similar to MLM. The same could be said for the ore veins in Haunted Mine. Even if multiple ore per vein doesn't make those mines quicker methods of obtaining it, being slightly more AFK would be a decent perk.
---
Yum I would love to get me a bucket of green slime water right about now

waow it's just like the dark knight rises xD

That's your own fault. Get it together.

Holy shit, I just realized they're anglerfish.

like half an hour for 1 fruit.
---
Glad you had fun. I know for most people this doesn’t seem like that big of a deal but RS is a game and games are made for fun. You should go for a fire cape if you have the stats it would be another good/fun challenge for you.
---
is there something special im supposed to be seeing here?
---
This was discussed in a recent Q&amp;A. I'd check the videos or transcripts.
---
Runecrafting is shit anyway
---
With the email yes. You don't even need that for RuneScape. You can just use whatever login and logon the website and disable 2fa.
---
Nope. I got barrows gloves long before this

Wintertodt, Farm runs, and Fletching while training Agility

I don't like it.

Upvote for effort tho.

The wiki for RFD says you must have started legends quest.

For something like that, you should contact the mods, idk what else you can do
---
i accidentally teleported there the other day and was like "i thought these were only 3 times a day" and so i teleported like 15 more times right then and didn't hit any limit....
---
On the damage buff, it would kill any reason to get elite void mage unless it gives negative magic accuracy.
---
Someone make one.
---
No one cares about ur comment
---
And then you get send an email to confirm it. Literally everyother site on the internet, will have "send email to disable 2fa" option, that works without having to login into the account. What runescape does is in no way less secure that literally any website that uses 2fa.
---
That whole auth delay topic only shows how stupid most people here are and absolutetly do not understand security.
---
Context: Warshan has collected over 600 tier 7 emblems from playing bounty hunter, worth well over 600m gp. With the new bounty hunter rework coming out, Jagex is deleting all emblem tiers aside from tier 10, effectively robbing one of the most dedicated BH pkers in the game.
---
Zuk vs david he lured me for 900m do not trade anyone you will get yeeted
---
This is what peak performance looks like
---
eh, its sorta a small thing and you probably wouldn't know anyone. ill hit you up sometime though
---
Desert Treasure pet dude
---
The ringmaster outfit from the circus was my goto fashionscape for years. I'm still wearing it on RS3 even though I haven't played since 2012.
---
Glory only gives +3 Def... Personally, I think it should just get Power Ammy Stats (+6 to Atk, Def, and Str) while keeping its +12 Prayer. This would make it a good bit weaker than Glory, Fury, Torture, and such while still being decent.
---
1/66 is decent rng? :o
---
I thought it was gargoyles and a granite maul
---
Honestly give the dude lifetime membership and his reward for the troubles.  This is ridiculous that it takes so long and requires many attempts for these people to get their prizes. Bad PR on the JMods end.
---
You choose to limit yourself.
---
Imagine logging out cause someone wanted to overpay for your armor.
---
If you are over 100cb just go there in full void range and spam Att, I got like 3 people scrolling me in a few seconds. Sure it's a pain but unless you can make 7-11m (ba services prices) in an hour it really isn't worth it.
---
Oh ok cool
---
I love you.

https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Farming#Fruit_trees
---
&gt;Once a fruit tree is fully grown the player may check its health and harvest it to receive 6 fruit. A fruit tree will continue to grow fruit over time, unless it is cut down and its stump dug up, with a new fruit regenerating every 45 minutes.
---
I am the noob. Im that level 91 dude you see killing cows
---
Wish they could sort out the KotS shite at some point so they can make a new similar content (fastest+most quest points? w/ special rewards for quickest to complete milestone quests, like barrows gloves, legends quest, and the grandmasters)
---
With a tracked signature parcel for the reward
---
TFW you lvl 95 with 94 range and no firecape

Okay. Well. Im stupid...

I’m 26.5m xp no groot

Because i can :S
---
Some people set their public chat to off
---
You can nearly do magic which are good profit and xp, if you wanna train herblore you can make sara brews from birdnests
---
When the inferno came out, I was really hoping Zuk would have a final phase that required Melee. Instead, they make it impossible to Melee. They likely were trying to imitate Fight Caves, which is fairly ranged based due to safespots.
---
While this is all true and reasonable, you are forgetting that it would cost them much more than just 150K a year. They would start losing a LOT of money in subscriptions, and I believe that's one of the core reasons they don't just up and wipe the motherfuckers from the game.
---
Get you a job where you can just ignore your customers for nearly two years with no repercussions 👌
---
Updates?! Haha
---
To be fair to Acorn, she started well after KOTS, so good on her for getting this sorted.
---
How do
---
disagree. items get devalued all the time. d chain is basically a napkin these days compared to the past because of updates
---
Varrock diaries for battlestaves is nice.
---
If you train at NMZ, herb boxes are also easy money each day.
---
To look around at the sights along the way a bit more
---
I’ve always thought if I ever made an ironman I would transfer a couple mill from my main and a bond.... no hate please..
---
Lol sucks being sick, but hey, you’ll thank yourself later for getting that seaweed. Hope you feel better
---
If you just stay there and log in every 40 minutes, it is pretty easy to farm 1k/day.
---
Thanks!
---
Poor f**ing soul. Bad rnd always makes me cry
---
What would you suggest then. Increasing xp from the hunter area, buffing the reward chest table, lowering the cost of the shop items, etc?
---
As it is I felt having multiple rewards from the same activity (the shop, rewards chest, and hunter xp) would make it feel more worthwhile.
---
Yeah I renewed my OSRS membership to afk and feel like I'm making progress.  Maybe I'll hit up NMZ for getting my combat stats up and looking like an absolute pro with low slayer :P
---
Its one crate at a time so what ever runes you got from that puzzle is all for that puzzle
---
I think you need to run around the balcony, if you cant figure it out if you log out you should leave

So you're saying you're using the same password in more than one place? Because you're notified when an account recovery is in process.
---
At 74 mining, full prospector, dragon pick, and a charged glory.. If I'm focused, 55k-ish exp/hr
---
And like 400k or so in gems per hour. Depends on rng.
---
Well it was already one letter away from artistic
---
I recently started one and unlocking transportation is super important. I ran over to barbarian assault and unlocked the minigames tele. Afterwards went to gnome stronghold for some agility. Past that it's up to you how you wanna do it. Its recommended to do wintertodt at a low hp due to the boss mechanics. Best wishes on your ironman. (Look up some series and see what they do too)
---
Uncalled for in chat but gz

No more pets please.

But you can’t on an iron man can you?

You literally click left to dodge Vorkath fireball it goes in the last sq you stood in...

Surprised I don’t see comments about that hiatus ciatus guy in lumbridge. He’s even been polled to be removed. I personally don’t care lol

Probably an honest mistake by saying LMS. Wouldn't have changed the argument though as Dagon'hai robes from LMS would be equally bad.

Hate to break it to you but your email is everywhere

Rooftops restore run energy upon each obstacle completed, and the marks of grace still have monetary value (unless you can sell graceful pieces back to the shop).
---
I am feeling much better today, thank you.
---
Yeah you cant get more than 3 dupes so it rolls good seeds instead. Better than trading them in for a supply crate
---
Also, thank you to Jagex and Runescape for creating the outlet where I was able to pass the time and meet these great people.
---
P.s. Idk if discussion is the right flair but I did not know which other one to use
---
Yea. That slot is replaced with a specific seed. I know warm gloves is a magic seed.

30k USD is barely above the poverty line in Minnesota. Sounds awful
---
Of the options you listed, Sara sword is the best.
---
For str training in general, the order goes..
---
Scythe&gt;rapier&gt;bludgeon/blessed Sara sword&gt;abyssal dagger&gt;Sara sword&gt;d scim
---
This is assuming on a Slayer task. Otherwise, technically the best would be full obsidian in NMZ, or Sharon if your hp level is above 90
---
Bankers duh
---
Splashers must be destroyed.
---
It doesn't have to be like it was then. They've released content from that time period that's a bit less powerful in plenty of situations. For example, polypore staff vs trident or chaotic maul vs elder maul. A runespan that was just as afk but less xp would be nice in my opinion.
---
Rooftops aren't always the best agility exp
---
Like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli.
---
James who
---
Well it’s obviously not optimal. It would be better if it showed the correct stack
---
A lot of gwd is done duo. Any pvm content can be really. There is no group content on f2p, I think they made some minigames like castle wars and lms f2p if you wanna look into those
---
Ahhh that makes since. Preciate it my guys. What's crazy is I had 2 before that crate as well
---
She’s cute tho
---
You need to remember that for hunter, your contesting against chins, birdhouses and herbiboar.

Unless it’s BETTER than these for a vast increase in cash, it would be dead content on release.

&gt;  it was a beginning to the end

Ok regardless of whether you liked the skill, it still started the "level 120" thing undeniably. 50k+ XP was extremely slow back then too. It was unbearable when it came out on the level people complain about runecrafting in this sub. I would actually rather RC.
---
sorry g i dont think it works that way

He does have a point, get your keys and save the aviensee kills for in the room so you get more kc in the room. That's 40 more chances at the rares too. It will also save like 30 minutes every time you go in. No point making the game harder than it needs to be. Work smarter not harder

Yes, yes it does. You must charge it by giving it those tasty tasty cigar stubs.

This is it. The best one lmao
---
Saw this twice tonight at the GE, two different accounts.
---
Itd be cool of you could get a full set of armour and weapons that are connected to your family crest like those sheilds helms and banners however you must combine an item with it to then give the family weapon those stats. Say you choose to have a family war axe, you then can combine say a rune axe to the family one destroying the rune one and giving it those stats or simular stats. Upon death in PvP situations it could just drop the item that was bond to the family weapon slash armour. So that way you can have a customizable look that also uses the stats of items you must first obtain.
---
You literally have NO IDEA what you are talking about. You become an ironman on tutorial island and cannot trade whatsoever. The only thing you can do is accept converted (tradeable) bonds from other players, in which they use them on you and you receive them.
---
!RemindMe 10 hours
---
Mimic made third age much more common, it'd still take anyone like 15 years to complete if master clues were the only things they ever did, but it's likely that it will only trend toward being more completable as time goes on.
---
The champion guild guy who helps you start dragon slayer, that guy took me on an adventure of a lifetime and made me lose my full mightily back in the day. You quest giving, glory enticing bastard.

It isn't just for one guy, I proposed the most simple solution, giving compensation for all tiers levels based on their conversion rate for a tier 10's equivalent to 2m. Plenty of others have tiers in their banks, but if you've noticed BH is pretty dead atm.

Many areas with volcanic properties have the option to use them as furnaces (Tzhaar/Wildy), could the same functionality be added to volcanic mine? It seems unfitting that there's not furnace vent or area to smelt your ores nearby. Additionally, will there be an anvil or camp expansion coming to fossil Island as well?

I get sooooo many mind runes from barrows on my ironman.  Is there any real use to them after you've passed the earlygame beyond runecrafting?

I’ve done both of those quests but haven’t tried Zulrah yet. Yeah, the wave grinding is what prevented me from going right back into the caves after a death.

Are Thammaron's robes supposed to do something? I can't find any info on them, and the robes seem stupidly underpowered stat-wise. I looked at mystics just to be sure, and they're far better, save for the hat which is the same stat-wise...  
---
Anyone know?
---
I did about 10 kills with bgs and bp. It didn't seem worth the hassle with missing specs, not having enough spec to do more than 2 kills, and losing a bit of space for food. I went back to acb and it's much more chill, ruby bolts (e) can hit 100's, and I have more room for food. If anything I'd bring the bpipe for spec healing, but bpipe and bgs definitely isn't my thing.
---
Dwh spec has the same effect whether you're hitting 1 or 80.
---
For the vast majority of monsters, you're better off hitting an 80 with the BGS than 80 with the DWH.
---
What made you decide on this style as opposed to the classic look?
---
Rude dude
---
How would this work? First I’m hearing about it. Would the group share a bank?
---
Join slut
---
Even if it's BIS I didn't find it worth the hassle. I tried 10 kills and they were a bit faster, but I got less kills per trip and the specs are finicky.
---
Because apples and mac and cheese are for eating not gaming and phonecalls.  You can however use them for music, that is fine. 
---
Also maybe changine the resolution thru the computer settings rather then using streched on runelite might work. Im not sure i dont use apple products.

I think he's relogged once or twice

Bronzeman mode
---
Accidents happen
---
without bgs spec, bp with addy darts is ~14% higher dps (assuming all other bis gear) - keep in mind acb dps will decrease as hp decreases
---
with a 40 dmg bgs spec, bp is 19% higher dps

Where do I sell my Settled stocks to fully invest in this new series? I sense STONKS.
---
Do you mail letters to the creators of South Park for how horrible their show is too?
---
Ty!
---
Then people will just start using zybez
---
Probably would not be fun tbh, there are quite a few raid mechanics that require you to dodge certain floor hazards. You could maybe just keep yourself constantly moving to bypass some of these but others that you have to react to will be very difficult.
---
I never said that wasn't also a problem.
---
What are your kill times like? How many an inventory? 
---
Using BGS and blow pipe should only take up 1-2 additional inventory slots vs ACB.

Yes, all dragons except elvarg are susceptible to dhcb and dhl

Ahrims has mithril tier melee defense.  So earth is your answer.

So I change to 2h and click player all before an arrow hit?

Someone tried this with me at the GE yesterday. I was equipping for vorkath, and as soon as I equipped my arma helm, someone ran up to me and started talking. In the end he wanted me to trust trade him the helmet. Which I find funny since it wasn't even the most expensive piece I was wearing
---
I wish I had lifetime membership to osrs. That's a prize right there.
---
Bgs is better than dwh at vorkath cause his def is low enough where bgs hit drain is better than dwh’s percent drain
---
Indigenous people calling you master feels wrong
---
Literally saw this on facebook just now, dats me.
---
I dont want to be rude to the guy but some people shouldnt have tattoos or shouldnt show them. yikes
---
It’s pretty depressing, they’re jumping ship from their dead game and romanticizing updates that killed their own game in the first place..
---
Pretty much yeah, although since this is a free to play method, prayers don't have as much a role, so I'm not sure if that's entirely necessary, at least when starting out. But yeah, that's the gist of it, shoot an arrow and then right away switch to the 2H and attack and hopefully you time it right so the hits stack. You'll probably get better timing with practice. Honestly it's a cool very cheap no risk pking style so worth trying, I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun doing it!
---
We did ...

Stop posting this

You say that... but jagex will word it in a way the community votes for.

I think its you that doesnt understand, the last tracks i need are in tob, because i didnt know you can spectate means im nowhere near the level of skill to do it? Just because something is true for you doesnt mean it applies for everyone else, iv been attempting, and im iv made plenty of progress, as iv mentioned im no where near the end but im still giving it all iv got and learning along the way, 
---
And now once i spectate and get the tracks with that method and obtain my cape ill be skilled all of the sudden?  No, honestly i dont think youve ever even attempted a solo run in your life or have your music cape do you?
---
Bwana bwana bwana bwana bwana bwana bwana.  They hate us cuz our dicks is bigger

honestly if you just keep trying in the ba world you'll get a queen kill reasonably quickly. the solofremmy cc does ba quite a bit apparently, if you're still struggling to do it by the weekend pm me or reply to this comment and i can help you find a team

Is it possible for my buddy and I to duo Bandos?  I’m 90/92/85 with 90 hp, 70 pray and 70 magic. 
---
He is 75/99/75 with 90 hp, 70 pray, 75 magic. 
---
We are both new to gwd not counting me doing it years ago before EOC.
---
According to the misplaceditems website on August 27th (the date I found for WoW classic release) there were about 56k players on at noon and on the 26th there was 59.5k players. Today at noon was 48.6k. So who knows how much it affected the player count.
---
I think it would have looked better if it was a d scim tbh. I don't really like the green part.
---
Trimmed quest cape, regular quest cape is annoying when you have a trim option and cant trim it.
---
Venezuela would like to know your location
---
Have done multiple times as well, forgot to mention. Thanks for the suggestion anyway. Going to update to latest iOS and see what happened.
---
I have tried 23 times and failed 23 times. 99 ranged 99 hp 91 defense with rigour and void.
---
Whenever I get close to finishing I disconnect randomly, almost as if all the Runescape gods are stopping me from fulfilling my destiny of no longer being a noob.
---
Someone help me escape this eternal torment.

Thanks, I’ll see what I can find.

You know if you think about it hard enough we are all group ironmen whose group has grown so big it has a literal economy
---
Sire is an rng boss, either you go 500k an hour or 3m an hour. Badboss
---
You can do it kacy
---
Its practice, but I wouldnt necessarily say good practice. Wear dhide, bring a couple sharks, brews, a restore, and as long as you dont miss a pray melee switch and get boaty'd by an ags or something you've got a pretty good chance at escape.
---
They should pay for your ticket to London and should give you a free tour and hand that prize to you.

Also dinner with mod Ash.

Can the call options on the horn in barbarian assault be reordered, it makes no sense that it goes controlled, accurate, aggressive,  medic then defensive.
---
I'm not fat i'm practically halfway to 99 agility

Beat you to it. GGs, sit.

Amazing idea this should be posted every day and should be Implemented  without polling because it doesn't effect any other player in the game , Imagine if fally was the meetup place for trades like back in the day

Do you think I'd be able to duo raids with my stats? I know I'd definitely need 78 Herblore but I'm at 90 Attack/91 Strength/87 Defence/90 Range/83 Magic. I definitely would love to start learning CoX though it looks so fun!
---
I'll have a look, thank you!
---
Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm all about trying to be grammatically correct, but I saw something the other day with people saying that those who use "him or her" and get all uppity about using a singular "them" essentially just have a stick up their ass

Go up the  ante and de iron your ironman and go stake :) gl

This is defiantly on trashy. Maybe /ATBGE but this is nowhere near trashy.

Dragonstone design is terrible as well, I wish the mods would keep consistency with the existing world designs

Since Ironmen = BTWs, can we make Mithmen = FYIs?
---
what type of runes are you buying
---
Exactly  you know for a fact most people that rank high are just gonna be playing multiple  accounts at once by multilogging, mithrilman all the way,
---
100% range so far! I would consider trying melee if I had max melee stats. But since I don’t, I figured range is the way to go since it is 99. (110 now actually lmao)
---
who? why? so?
---
Seriously impressive though
---
&gt; defiantly on trashy
---
&gt;nowhere near trashy.

autocorrect?

I remember Bonbloc’s pk compilation with korasi and spec transfer, fucking hell it was crazy

Are we all in a coma and this metaphor is just a metaphor about how we aren’t able to move on to the next life because our bitch wife Karen won’t pull the plug?

It should hit to hard since runescape is a very minimal imput game, a lot of players do other things when playing.

---
I just did my first giant seaweed run and both patches died when ultracomposted. Is it worth paying for them to be protected and if so what’s the best way to get nummulite? (Ironman btw)
---
Most people don't care and most players goals aren't to max every skill or be efficient 100% of the time.  Most players just play the game to relax at the end of a shift and chill.
---
Update us please !
---
Or just dont boost xp with an outfit?
---
Is splashing for hours afk against the rules?
---
Some people take pride in improving and doing things well instead of just being lazy and mediocre.  There's no "wrong" way to play the game, but there is a "right" way to do specific tasks and achieving perfection in this game is a lot more realistic than most other games because of the slow-paced tick system.  
---
  
---
Personally enjoy a healthy balance of doing some things at max efficiency (really enjoy 3-ticking chins for some reason) and being lazy and afking some stuff while doing other stuff (I never alch or multi-skill for rooftop agility).  Everyone is different  so just try to be empathetic and not judge others for doing what they like.
---
Congrats! (:
---
Rainbow boots are cool and chill 😎
---
It’s like Ironman except you get double xp rates for thieving and the pillory guard and prison pete random events aren’t optional.
---
Nieve since she likes to flex ely on me whenever i get a task
---
Lmao I read the title on mobile before scrolling to see the picture... 
---
Then I had to read it a few times over and now idk if I’m upset or what but take my upvote
---
I wore fighter boots because I was a fighter, not a gay clown lol!
---
Takes half a second to turn.
---
Also remember there are people out there enjoying the game just aimlessly playing and that’s okay!  
---
I have people on my friends list who are non iron man are at bandos bossing level and picks flax so they get more money and crafting exp for fletching... but hey they love it!
---
And another big part of it is. To be efficient, if that is what you want you need to know the best current method.  So content creators and the like can continually get traffic from people researching that which also makes it look like such a vocal majority!(which it probably still is but you get the point) the other half are just enjoying the game literally how ever you want so you don’t see as many posts. 
---
Just my thoughts on it, but I believe most people are honestly a mix between doing what they enjoy and what is efficient.
---
Congratulations! Which pet is that?
---
i sold and bought a few names here. the seller has to use 2 bonds, because you hold your previous name for roughly the time you had it if you only name change once. its all a trust thing, once the seller changed his name twice the buyer can change their now. You can use scythe for names, i personally bought mine from friends. HOWEVER, names can only be bought with gp, NOT irl money. It is a bannable offence buying with irl money.

Hosting to make money is fine.

Pretending you don't care about the money and that you "host for the community" is different.

You never played rs3, did you?
---
Is the Slice of Life boat tattoo a nod to the tv show Dexter? If so, that’s some impressive fandom.
---
Ask yourself (or the company you work for) what would be the profit of doing so. Because if you spend xyz per year to take action you expect a much more higher return. It is the same logic you apply whenever you ponder to sue people / other companies for illicit activities. If the cost is much bigger than the return - and sometime the return is uncertain - it is just wiser to take no action at all.
---
I like it!
---
With 10x frequency rates at all traffic stops!
---
Very good, I enjoy the prims and arrows.
---
the game looked like absolute ass though
---
Sometimes i feel like clicking these links and when prompted for login details, give them a fake one so they will get anxious and keep trying to login but fail and just waste their time. Better yet, write a script and give them 1M fake login credentials and let them try all 1M logins LOL.  
---
But at the end of the day, better not click any links as they may contain keyloggers.
---
Yea, I respect your opinion but you're fuckin wrong.
---
How do you kill vorkath while frozen? I thought he's immune to damage during that phase
---
Yeah, you only need to interact once every 20 minutes, a lot of people take a wireless mouse and put tape on ithe bottom and just click every now and again while watching movies or whatever
---
Sick bro

i really did not miss those god awful graphics holy hell, no wonder i quit when "hd" update came out

---
I like u
---
I like this idea love how it could fit in with lore too, people crying that it's in the wild just dont know how to play the game properly I hope this gets seen by jmods great idea
---
my point exactly, there's almost nothing worth maging in PvM that doesn't already have zero magic defense, making magic accuracy a pointless stat.  So having mage robes slightly better than ahrims but with no defensive bonuses doesn't really change anything.
---
yeah getting a tattoo of a weapon, what could go wrong.
---
Q
---
I’m guessing lance does over 10 dps on a specced hand so .5 isn’t much more
---
&gt;It's how the jmod (incorrectly) spelled it in the messages
---
Both are correct technically, dispatch is just the more popular spelling
---
If you pk a runecrafter bot you wont get anything good anyways
---
Complex? Just wait until you get into quantum mechanics
---
Ah right I've done that before but the spawn always disappears
---
Had to read thrice, took ~10secs this time around.
---
You're supposed to judge things on the issues where they matter, not by suming up all the issues where they're meaningless. It's dishonest lol
---
I guess so. Welp guess I shouldn't critisize people about taste or opinion. That one's on me, my bad.
---
It wasn't. These boots have nothing and never had anything to do with orientation. They're just some cute, cool-looking party boots.
---
Yes, you're right. Stockholm Syndrome can happen when someone gets held hostage and eventually they will appreciate that the hostage taker (?) takes care of them by giving them food, water, etc. and they can even get feelings for them. It's quite scary.

10/10 quality meme.

While all that may be best practice, receiving this email doesn't mean they have any of your details, so it wasn't strictly necessary
---
There's probably something that i'm also missing, and people that spend a lot of time there (making alts, etc) would probably be more qualified to give you an answer - I moved on once I got 99 - but I found that I lost some exp due to Ice Barrage freezing some of the monkeys in odd places. If they hadn't been trampled yet, but were frozen, they would get other monkeys that spawned stuck behind them - meaning that even if I was running in between the two tiles to trample them, there were still some that were frozen/stuck behind frozen ones.
---
I ended up switching to Smoke Barrage and found that I was getting more consistent results.

You lick them?

That's like, totally your side of the story man

Why do you even want that sht lol. Just take the free membs fuck cringy physical rewards

For all the hate and ignorance you spew enjoy all the downvotes

Korasi sword was an item people would risk though, most wont risk bss

Ffs took me nearly 800kc to get one lol
---
Nice.
---
I appreciate this isn’t your decision and your doing your job, which we all really appreciate despite the posts and comments in our sub. But...
---
At this point would it not be a good idea to stop doing physical rewards entirely because all I see about kots is post after post “I didn’t get my thing”.
---
I haven’t done kots as I don’t have time but even if I did, I doubt I would knowing the rewards are going to be with me soon tm.
---
Either do it well or don’t do it.

Take my upvotes

Honestly I would be so down for an Oldschool Runescape anime adaptation.

You should try lavas, it's really not that bad and I prefer it to the abyss tenfold.

After iron is black, why not call it black man

I do follow the sub and play the game and I have no clue what I'm looking at.

One of the big reasons this version of the game (old school runescape) started in the first place was because the main game (now Runescape 3) introduced microtransactions that many feel the game made pay to win. As a result, Jagex (the developers) have promised they will never add them into this version of the game. This post is meant to be one of those “they had us in the first half not gonna lie” kinds of posts by making you think you’re about to see a pro-MTX argument that will get people upset, when instead he’s just innocently adding a player named “MTX is good” standing next to another player named “here’s why.”
---
i still don't get the joke
---
Stats?
---
How are these not changed yet? They look so ugly.
---
But MasterChief, all the historial Spartans died
---
That hit too deep... I'ma go throw my sadness into my osrs gold
---
To understand this sub, one must understand that they will never be satisfied, never content.
---
Always longing for nostalgia that cannot be reproduced.

This doesn’t need to be a new game mode, just DONT use the GE if you don’t want to lol. Kinda silly imo.

You can make any mode you want!

Don’t worry OP little dick Timmy has no friends to play mini games with and sucks at socializing, he can stay at the barb village fishing spot catching salmon with the bots
---
Lmao wasn't that one of the BETTER parts of rs2? The expanse of minigames, that people ACTUALLY played. A mini game comes into osrs and it's dead content within 2 weeks unless it gives efficient exp, or good money.
---
Yeah I also learned orbitals in chem 101
---
I started the post 99 farming grind so prices are adjusting to fuck me a little harder. Expect 200k magics next week.
---
This is what peak performance looks like bois
---
🤦‍♀️
---
A lot of things have shot up in price this week. Great example being Zulrah scales. Whereas things like tassests are on their way back to down their all time low.
---
Perhaps with school starting people are moving their focus from pvm to skilling?
---
BigRedJapan
---
Hopefully someday it will be as active as pre eoc, full cc's to find high risk fights and full pk worlds. In osrs I have never seen the pvp world above 800 people on peak times in like 4 years
---
Not a fan of this content
---
When will someone make a true one tile per episode iron???
---
Players with billions of gp enjoy controlling supply of important materials to continue to inflate their already excessive amount of currency at the expense of those who have less then them, just like America.
---
Consider my farming rush paused.
---
Doing that consistently for 100 days means you have 200m which is a lot.
---
Not one I played much but I know others who really enjoyed that.
---
It’s probably on but he didn’t know about the 6 hour change to 20 mins so it’s just him being attached until he logs out

you stopped liking the idea right after you said black? cmonBruh

Why should they cut the exp? Just dump all xp gained into rc no matter the mini game, casting barrage @ f.o.g? Easy rc xp and seems fair too
---
It just defeats the purpose of this being OSRS then. Why not change the name to “kinda old school runescape” if we’re just going to dabble in the times where runescape was in its free fall?
---
I've only done like 4 beginner clue scrolls being f2p at the moment, on most of them I get almost nothing but on the second one I did I got the fucking shoulder parrot. That was a nice boost to my account right there.

I remember making new accounts just for the 10k they give you at the end lmao.
---
Dolo lavas is 45 minutes, dolo sarachnis is 80 minutes, solo lavas is 90 i think. These are for elite, hard, med and easy are from implings. Gl on the 4500 hour grind.

We don’t play mini games, there’s money to be made.

Pretty sure that fall had nothing to do with what I'm suggesting. Agree to disagree.
---
Ah it’s nice that they still get the normal appeal system.

aha ye this sub is mainly low level players who get their first fire capes etc, barely any EHP nerds here.
---
they imply theyre a generous streamer and say hey give me ur fury mate, and they look rich so u think hmm what could this guy possibly want with a fury? it must be a test and if i give it to him he will give me riches beyond my most wild imagination! so you give him your fury, fingers trembling, heart pumping, what will he give you, tassies? a dhcb?? could it be a TBOW?!?! as the single bead of sweat drips down the back of your neck you realize this is it, your big break. your mom was wrong about you, you arent doomed to fail everything, you finally are getting everything you deserve.
---
Then he says "thanks idiot" and disappears, along with all of your self respect.
---
I guess, but that’s your opinion. Minigames were never on the top of my priority list. I think they’re kinda pointless but obviously it depends on what you’re playing for. I have fun doing other stuff some people might like to waste time with minigames. I just don’t wanna slowly edge towards rs3

I grinded out mta really early on my acc just so I could have bones to peaches as a super welfare guthans. I am glad I did.

He's adding MTX is GOOD to his friends list, and he's presenting the user Why it is. Don't try to think to far into it, it's just silly humor.
---
or make it a VLS (uncharged), and you have to charge it at a NPC for like 2m gp for 1 hour of combat charges. So then you have a VLS(charged), and if you die with it, your opponent gets the VLS(uncharged).
---
And I OOPa sksk
---
What in the name of 144p am I watching
---
Rune drag maxes at 1.2m/h you play for 10 hours? Sweet
---
Yeah i do agree with your post and pitch in general. I did after a while just stop doing all daily like content but the majority did give a shit and everyone was vocal with no one disagreeing. Rs3 devs have stated for years about avoiding dailyscape updates because they know how the players feel. 
---
The whole being equal as current training methods but more fun with group based content eliminates any of those problems, while not making it doa content.
---
get a dhcb and elite void and kill vokath a million times.
---
Law runes
---
Good thing I wasn't making a blanket statement against all untradeables then, isn't it?
---
The little wave is too funny lmfao
---
It's a nitpick but I would expect 'Animate Anvil' to be cast on an anvil to make a living anvil. If you want to smith anywhere you should summon, conjure or create an anvil; not animate one.
---
I like the idea of a barrows-style minigame located in the wilderness, but I dislike pretty much all of the specifics of this suggestion. We don't need pvp weapons.
---
Mostly slayer bosses

!remindme 18 hours

who cares it's just an object.
---
Someone explain this?
---
#woosh
---
Just search "osrs max hit calc" you will find a melee and ranged one.
---
Thanks for understanding
---
yeah and his camels name is Ali too
---
&gt; doesn't matter its not as good as ancestral if it's 1/50 its cost
---
Why do you think it would be 1/50th the cost? It is being proposed as a rare drop from a rare key from unpopular content; it isn't going be a mil per piece.
---
And "any suggestion that harms the present is just bad" seems like a ridiculous standard. That is pretty much claiming any new BiS content is bad because it harms existing BiS. Either way, this doesn't harm Ancestral that much at all. The full set bonus is nearly the same as 1 piece of Ancestral; so an Ancestral Hat and Ahrims would be 0.5% damage less than Dagon'Hai but way better stats everywhere else.
---
The biggest drawback is that my proposed Dagon'Hai requires the full set for any damage bonus. This means you can't just switch on a body and legs like you can with Ancestral and Ahrims. You can't use it with a Serp Helm at Zulrah. You can't use it with a Slayer Helm when Bursting. So yes, it would provide an armor with Magic Damage before Ancestral, but it doesn't hurt Ancestral's value much since it is significantly better. An increase of +18 or more Attach and 3.5% damage isn't trivial and it is way more than you get from upgrading from Barrows to Bandos or D'hide to Armadyl. Tassets weren't ruined by stuff like Obby Legs; Ancestral wouldn't be ruined by a set like this.
---
Zulrah drops it in high quantities.

Those monkeys are encountered during mm2, which he can't access without first completing mm1.

Hi there.
---
This is happening to a few players at the moment. Jagex are aware of the issue and are investigating.

You've already found the work around - use your mobile phone's mobile data connection via a WiFi hot spot to do the login.
---
Yeah it's weird. If you drop one on the ground they look just like a normal potion but with sparklies floating around.
---
So when we get penguins back I guess I can't count on you to help me hunt them 🙂
---
tbf 3 dose and 4 dose regular potions are also pretty hard to tell apart.
---
Imo dwh is only useful at cox and tob. And even then, like you said, solo Cox its not worth the spot, rather take an extra gear switch for more dps since its def is already low. I think this is why dwh is falling, not super useful outside of tob, tekton, maybe vanguards, or group Cox.
---
Nice lol I see framed is getting some pk clips on his new account
---
Famous last words...
---
Pest control and barb assault aren't empty tho
---
you should go to specsavers then ngl
---
regarding the vls:
---
pking has changed so much from when the original pvp weapons were released, most people know how to combo-eat (and do so) - kill potential decides if a weapon finds real use or will be dead content.
---
as it stands the vls has a lower max hit than the ags, uses the same amount of spec, has a higher attack requirement and degrades to nothing.
---
the Vls as it was released in LMS and DMM is a real high level alternative to the ags, which is basically the only all around good spec weapon for pking at higher level since you need the higher accuracy to hit through Barrows armour and high defence levels - the lower max hit (less kill potential) would be traded for the 2 additional specs, which is fair.
---
Also if you kill a guy and smite him for the vls you only getting 1m cash, when it is supposed to be on the same level as a 15m Godsword, is incredibly frustrating not even speaking of the situation when the opponents vls turns into dust mid fight, even reducing the guys risk.
---
TLDR: Make the Vls non-degradeable to have it retain some kind of value and keep it at 25% spec.
---
Ok, ignoring the upgrade to toxic part, Sol and sob is better than sotd?
---
Sometimes I wonder how the servers are still online. Gl bro. 🦀
---
We were discussing whether or not the "a." still made it appear as a valid address or not. Clearly it does.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Now you're arguing that it should be obvious that [Runescape.com](https://Runescape.com) is not valid because it is different than [Jagex.com](https://Jagex.com)? Jagex sends emails from the [Runescape.com](https://Runescape.com) address all the time. A regular user would have no way of knowing which address it should come from. They would only know that [Jagex.com](https://Jagex.com)  and [Runescape.com](https://Runescape.com) are both valid addresses owned by Jagex. 
---
There is no way to tell from looking at the email address, it looks EXACTLY like a valid email from Jagex. You would have to check the source of the email, which is different than the address. 
---
Here's a helpful guide on how to check the source:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ct0va6/guide\_how\_to\_spot\_phishing\_emails\_and\_other/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ct0va6/guide_how_to_spot_phishing_emails_and_other/)
---
Is the hcim symbol relevant?
---
Birdhouse runs are nice over time.
---
Are there any future plans of allowing the obsidian set to work with obby rings? Would bring some use to an underused item. Could even allow the set to work for obby staff.
---
Yes, it's a hidden plot thread
---
no you good
---
Why not just allow them to become a toxic staff of the dead? 
---
I don't really know why you would need 2 be other staffs with slightly different kit. I almost wanna say make them toxic Sol and toxic sob, so the only difference then would be cosmetic. But I don't know what the Sol and sob do differently than sotd...
---
only in india you would get a well with water so filthy it is green.
---
Look for 5 if you are learning
---
Django...hehe
---
Sure you can but as someone that has played many game modes officially and unofficially, the official ones feel much better. Adding them hurts nothing.
---
3m for a queen carry? That's a straight up scam and I want in
---
I’m pretty sure, if they could, people would safespot every boss.
---
Very nice. 99 prayer would give you max combat and 2022 total.
---
Never ever play with sound lol
---
Yeah now the one social aspect of osrs is gone and you just dump everything on an automatic selling machine.  "Real interesting"
---
Currently doing vorkath for money for it actually
---
Cause jamflex is not the sharpest needle in the haystack my friend
---
Not sure why jagex doesnt just patch safespots as soon as theyre found out.  If they have to rework the bosses so be it, but safespotting them is super lame.
---
!remindme 6 hours
---
I remember it being 4-5 hrs using the op runelite plugins made for it.
---
Song name?
---
I got the same one! it tells me to come play and tells me all the experience, levels, and quest points I gained last month.
---
I always thought it was Django but now I see I'm the cute F2P noob
---
i did not need such a personal attack
---
He said get a dhcb? Where did he mention bgs or dwh lol
---
I like to smith cannonballs for AFK gp (I know it’s terrible gp/xp rates, but it’s great for me, because I have a lot of time to AFK on mobile but very little time to actively play).
---
I’m about to hit 70 Smithing. When I do, I’ll have 36K cannonballs in the bank. My question is this: Should I sell them, or should I use them to train slayer?
---
These are my current [stats](https://imgur.com/a/9PFCpp0).
---
I currently have a little over 1M saved up. 
---
Short term goals:
---
1.	Earn enough money to be able to support mid-level questing, training, etc
---
2.	RFD
---
3.	Level up farming (preferably by farming Ranarr)
---
4.	Begin learning/training NMZ
---
Long term goals:
---
1.	Base 70 in all skills
---
2.	Unlock a better money-making method
---
3.	Hard achievement diaries
---
4.	Level Str, Mage, Range to 80+
---
I guess my original question sort of bleeds into “what’s best for my overall account progression,” so any advice in general is greatly appreciated. Keep in mind, I’m a filthy casual.

I like it but it will get no votes because "wah I have to enter the wilderness at all"
---
How much does it cost to go from 70 to 83?
---
it really isn't that bad tbh
---
It sounds fun but do you remember trying to get any obscure quest item or large amounts of things without getting ripped off? It was a huge pain to find niche items.

Yeah and I just mentioned V West Bank lol. Why downvote me?

I’ve been doing pc grind for a while in the 100+ boat. I usually just grind out a piece at a time and take a few weeks off.

It’s pretty standard this time of year.. people are back at school so less people are farming the bosses, everything goes up.

What's the best time to play BA? I'VE spent the last 3 days here and only been able to find 1 team that knew what they were doing and stayed past wave 2. I've tried both in the morning (930-1230EST) and later at night (after 9pm est) both times only 1 of the BA world's even had people in it. Is there a Cc or anything? I know what I'm doing so I'm not interested in paying.
---
East side beast side
---
Always heard of that term, but never actually knew what it meant until I made this Reddit post. Loool
---
That's classic rs, people these days dont even say pl0x
---
Yea I really hate how Staff of Light and Staff of Balance can not get the same Magic Attack bonus of Staff of the Dead. Plus the venom effect. It makes them both very inferior to Toxic Staff, and it really makes no sense to own them.
---
If they want to buff the God Spells because they are the coolest combat spells in the game, then that would be good.
---
I did not.
---
Staff of Light has a niche use in GWD because it counts both as a Zamorak and Saradomin item. The staff of balance is essentially just the staff of the dead, but better looking.
---
It depends what you’re looking for. These are my 3 go to ccs, depending on my mood.

Extremely unbearably toxic, just not ok = Zezima cc

Semi toxic edgelords  = OSG cc

Watson’s house in Hosidius has a board that shows which STASH units you have built and which ones you have filled. Go check it out, take a screenshot, and work your way through each tier building and filling them, then you won’t have to worry about it ever again.
---
It is the collection log. It’s a book you can get from the Varrock museum, and it tracks all your drops from every boss. Even shows loot from clues and other stuff as well.
---
&gt;lol!

I Just did "SHAKE:( . Y . )" in game and sadly laughed out loud at my 9-5 job, my maturity level has not increased.

Thanks! Don’t the healers respawn? I could probably out dps two of them, didn’t think about that.
---
What if mithrilman was ultimate Ironman with trading but no GE
---
It's insane to start straight with a "hey let's buff rev's drop tables".
---
What the fuck is wrong with you, alch yourself.
---
Oh I missed the Ancient Cavern too. That's easy rune scims, there's brutal greens and mith dragons in there too. Waterfiends are great for runes, staffs, etc. too, and you can utilize all the barbarian skills with the allowed areas. Plus free planks and even (with WC guild) a carpentry store for construction.
---
Still though, lacking an end-game goal. No ToB or Inferno in sight haha. And if level 3s can kill the Penance Queen I can't imagine it's a crazy hard grind to solo, if it's possible. You do the damage with the eggs not your 99 STR after all.
---
I went in for the bgs spec and got one hit by a fireball no lag just great timing. Anytime it lagged it just paused it basically, no extra attacks
---
Should be on reddit more, this has been happening since release
---
Nah this is probably Windows key + L
---
Oh hey thanks friendo
---
I struggled with clicking undead spell on the spider I kept misclicking but other than that I think it went pretty well. I think with a blowpipe and woox walk it would go a lot faster but I was 73 range when I tried so I’m gonna do nmz till 80 and try again with pipe
---
Yep, and it's Fluffers that gives Evil Bob the adult humans who ungrow to children... probably.
---
What if this barrows-like thing only had an entrance in the wildy? It just fits the lore well but doesn't have to be pvp in the crypts
---
Nope
---
i was thinking maybe like a master tier, same as clue scrolls. something that would require near max skills. i love achievement diaries so i think it would be fun to have something end game to aim for
---
Get your Varrock Herald here!
---
28 bolt tips too Jesus Christ
---
Yeah I agree thats another banger but paying off scores is always number 1

I'm not sure why you don't have a full inventory of food...
---
More dangerous npcs outside Lumbridge in general.
---
Yeah I figured it out! Had to repair the fence before spiders worked..
---
There aren't really any for you, unless you have abnormally high skills for your combat level (like 80 smithing, fletching or runecrafting etc)
---
Your best bet is to do as many quests and achievement diaries as you can. 
---
Basically all good moneymakers either require tons of startup cash or high levels for skilling/combat.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide
---
Definitely must just be a coincidence...
---
Yeah you'll definitely want to get that down because that little ice thing does some HUGE damage. But other than that woox walk is not necessary. You should be fine to do it without.
---
"you've been here 5 hours"

Look into running dragon bones for people at rimmington world 330. There are clan chats for it but I don’t know any off the top of my head. They get paid 1-2m/hr with no requirements needed.
---
Have you ever actually visited TD? And I don't mean going to one specific comment that someone had to pick out from millions of others in order to satisfy their agenda, I mean just going on to the sub, looked at the top or hot posts, and maybe talked to someone in the comments.
---
Also, didn't a certain someone get in trouble for calling places shitholes? How come it's okay when you do it?
---
The quest Indeed does less damage and has significantly less health. Yes.
---
This is really helpful, thanks.
---
&gt;	Did you also want to be recommended what pieces of gear to buy and potential better money-making methods?
---
Yes, and yes please! 
---
My gear is not very good, here’s what I use currently:
---
Melee
---
1.	Neitiznot 
---
2.	Torso
---
3.	Obby legs
---
4.	Dragon boots
---
5.	Combat bracelet (I know, I know)
---
6.	Glory
---
7.	Warrior ring
---
8.	Ardougne 1 cape (lmao)
---
9.	Dragon scimitar
---
10. Dragon defender
---
Range
---
1.	Archer helm
---
2.	Black d’hide body
---
3.	Black d’hide legs
---
4.	Snakeskin boots
---
5.	Black d’hide vambs 
---
7.	Mith darts (for training) / D’shun crossbow
---
8.	Book of Law
---
 I’ve yet to buy an “actual” ranged weapon/ammo. I’ve heard that the MSB(i) is really good, but I haven’t done NMZ, so...
---
Not even going to bother listing my mage setup, because I honestly don’t even have one. I’ve mostly been training mage using non-combat spells, and have only used combat spells for safespotting certain quests (for now).
---
Easy birdhouses and herb runs are great passive money.
---
&gt;We have approx. 12 more sets of prizes to send out and I'm sorry for the delay, without fail these will be send out on Monday (you should receive a text to say dispatched).
---
So that was not true lmfao.
---
Actually worse in some respects because they got rid of the spec.
---
Hell, it's about time someone made this meme
---
Hell yeah nothing like end game pvm being abby demons... that shit is so action packed and fun... 
---
The game was trash aside from nostalgia. Hence why it had sub 15k players at peek hours.
---
Zerker ring is a must if you want to do bandos/zammy. Bgs and karil's top would also help, as well as Guthans for healing. If you haven't got one already, tent whip is useful for bandos.
---
Also, which other bosses are you interested in?
---
You know what would be a good balance to how powerful blowpipe is?
---
Expensive as fuck to use it.
---
Also, if all zulrah bots get banned, players will simply farm Zulrah to sell scales anyways.
---
Yes, bots feed market items players don’t want to farm for shit profit, but if those bots go away and the profit rises, players farm said items.
---
Consider using a dragon crossbow instead of armadyl.
---
With the dragon crossbow's shorter range you can do the discount woox walk and attack during acid phases.
---
It’s nostalgic. It’s not fun. It just gets annoying when the nostalgia fades.
---
You enjoy training combat without potions, something that is objectively worth it both GP wise, XP wise, and inventory space wise, AND doesn't take any extra effort?
---
That was the hint that I was being satirical, clearly some of you missed it.
---
I saw the title and was ready to come in here and be angry. I’ve been bamboozled
---
Im gonna tell you what everyone is going to tell you . Long term goals barrows gloves, range is one of the better stats to get up and very effective through your quest grind as well as magic. I also recommend extra money that sitting in bank to invest in g.e flippingoldschool has good guides to help you with that. Ge tracker will help with your investments. If you start now in 6 months you will have a nice pay day when your closer to
---
Maxing your combat stats, that gp will go a long way when doing your slayer grind. 
---
You can also go the afk route mother load mine, woodcutting, fishing, fletching to 99 spend loot on other skills
---
Same. I ended up needing to pve to make money to buy ships and even that was pvp in the sense that I always needed to run from anyone that showed up on the radar. I give my Eve experience a 2/10
---
And it should stay dead.
---
thanks pal
---
I mean more people would be willing to if they were more profitable, but the fact of the matter is doing 2-3 group kills at Callisto for a rare chance at a 1-2m split just isn’t very practical, especially since most wildly bosses require high stats to take down effectively, and PKers add more risk. At that point, most people would rather just do group CoX, TWB, or even GWD. I’m not saying wildly bosses need to be insane profit, but that’s definitely a big reason as to why group killing them just isn’t very popular. Their drop tables are better fit for solos. Wildy bosses in general also just have pretty mediocre mechanics that are annoying and difficult to manage even in groups, like Ven can stack you out in just one tick without any warning.
---
Have fun in New York.
---
Cleaning cloth won’t save this man
---
calling a place a shithole because of the people or culture is different from calling a place where questionable rhetoric is talked about a cesspool.
---
You don't need a restrictive game mode to play that way.
---
I think he means "Runescape, 3 years ago".
---
I think this what was I was looking for. Thanks!

That sounds about right

I'm an ideas guy

Ahhh so this is what the average osrs redditor looks like.

This is some good fucking content lmao
---
Just did this quest the other day, pretty close to unlocking the harmony patch woooooooo
---
As much as it is easier to think of it that way, Reddit is not a single entity but a community, and a successful post does not directly reflect the overall opinion of something like a person. Of course you don't understand this subreddit if you construct it as something that doesn't make sense in the first place. 
---
And even before the point about it not being a single entity, this post does not call for removing the GE. It calls for an optional mode that removes the GE. Where even is the contradiction?
---
For kill count, yes.  Range made it quick and easy, and without Ava's I was going to run out hella quickly. The two less food never really affected my trips.
---
I as a reviver of this meme I say this is my top favourite one of them tied with Jonah Jameson one! XD
---
Good deal. I think I have what I need as far as gear goes other than getting karils. I’ll continue to do some research and watch some videos on bandos and zammy
---
Also sends a 30 second clip of what you're doing to your entire address book; excluding your grandmother because her old heart doesn't need to see your shame.
---
Judging by what they said, after the rework the only way to get the rune pouch for HCIM especially would be via slayer. 1k points does take a long time to accumulate but really the rune pouch isn't one of those MUST NEED items for ironmen till a bit later on, after which you SHOULD have 1k points/be working towards it anyway.
---
Nice. Darts seems relaxing but XP is too slow. I gotta grind from 75 right now. Platebodies isn’t as intense as gold but 120k/hr with Priff anvil.
---
Cheeky untrimmed. I love untrimmed HP and Slayer.
---
CookedBeefosrs has logged on.*
---
&gt; Sure you can but as someone that has played many game modes officially and unofficially, the official ones feel much better. Adding them hurts nothing.
---
Picture had potential. Poor title. 2/10
---
Why not post that and add water to this meme? I do not want to steal your work by posting it before you.
---
the osrs meme economy slowing moving towards things that look like a face . Everything else will be obsolete within the year
---
Pretty good rng on seers and archers tho.
---
*unzips* - go on
---
Except it's still worse and the only reason the staff is worth that price is that it has the trident dps which is the second best dps spell, just behind fire surge with tomb of fire.
---
He really needs the 200 Rune Deaths
---
&gt;people or culture 
---
Umm, nope. Have you actually looked at some 3rd world countries? Would you want to live there? Sure it's rude and disrespectful, but it's certainly not about race.
---
&gt;questionable rhetoric
---
Ah, you mean talking about how illegal immigration is problem? How a certain demographic is responsible for around half of violent crimes committed in the country in spite of their much smaller percentage of the population? Facts aren't racist.
---
What's racist is when places like Chapo and r/politics advocate for violence against men and white people.
---
Because that's the only thing people talk about with BA, buying torsos. Made me assume it was a dead minigame outside of that.
---
For sure, good luck. Tanking bandos is pretty easy, you just walk under him every two hits or when you have to eat. Also bones to peaches are so helpful, but some guides should explain the rest of the little things
---
Flex Paste.
---
Why would you be dry for anything? That's not how probability works
---
I still don't get the pvp armors are considered overpowered and the weapons aren't.
---
Tob != slayer
---
&gt;What would have to change in RS3 to make you play it again?
---
Making the game and menu's simpler. Osrs has a nice charm to it because its relatively easy to follow. Ive played a ton when eoc came out and comming back to it now still makes me confused.
---
&gt;Would you play if the combat system was toned down a bit to only a handful of abilities?
---
Im personally a fan of the simple click and wait system osrs has going on and would prefer no abilites. Iff I had to choose to play WoW or RS3 for its abilities I would go for WoW. I still feel like WoW simply does abilities better and makes them more unique.
---
&gt;how RS3 could be saved and made playable again for the people that split off from it post-EoC.
---
I simply dont think it can. The player that RS3 simply got a different mindset on the games future compared to osrs player. 20-30 events where you sit in a hole for dung xp or dancing on a table for prayer xp simply wouldnt be accepted in the osrs community. Double xp weekends are loved by rs3 and hated by the osrs community.
---
What is it??
---
Pretty sure they weren't going to have the special attack anyway.
---
Because I already have one variation of this meme on the front page, I dont want to seem like Im karma whoring.
---
Thought this would do. Still getting hit for as high as 10 and 11 damage. Might just try flinching it.
---
which is a bummer, really.
---
i spent a day safespotting vet'ion and came to the conclusion, after trying to just tank him vs safespotting, "i hate both of these."
---
When Swampman hits a significant level.
---
On mobile so cant use my normal dps calc but vls was worse dps than chaotic maul which was worse dps than chaotic rapier. Tent on this game is same accuracy but worse str than c rapier. Ags isnt used strictly as a spec wep either. Plus like i said, we really need a dps boost to 1v1 combat because u currently cant kill someone on a full tb if they are competent.  U also cant combo someone out with just a vls whack so its not a big deal because again, almost all fights end with a tele. It doesnt matter if you outlast. Getting more kills but losing every outlast is better than always outlasting and koing less. Its partyly why u still see pures in wildy past 80 cmb. Even tho a zerk is always gunna outlast a pure, a pure can camp 99 hp and just hope for the 70-30 maul then tele/log.
---
For melee I would upgrade glory to Fury and Warrior ring to Berserker ring (Dont forget to imbue it!) I would recommend getting Berserker ring first before Fury
---
For ranged I would upgrade Archer helm to Guthix(Or any cheaper god hide)coif 
---
Black d'hide body/legs to God hide (Only if you have the spare cash, the 1 prayer isnt that big of a difference) Snakeskin boots to God hide boots (Again, if you have the spare cash) 
---
D'hide vambs to God vambs, Increased prayer for like 7k. Exchange for barrows after.
---
Glory to fury (Only increases prayer for ranged but its a solid upgrade for melee.)
---
Get MSB(I), Also get a Ava's accumulator if you dont have it yet.)
---
Book of law is Alright until you have spare millions for a upgrade.
---
Aye. It do be like that sometimes.
---
I’ll pray for u brother
---
What? My point is that rich players won't even have to consider the idea of keeping the unique and selling it. Only poorer players would have to forego the pet roll for the hard needed gp (even moreso since this idea will raise the prices on these uniques) Because of this, poor players will effectively have a lower chance at getting the pet literally because they have less gp in the bank.
---
Slu1 and aful. When I see either of these names I feel great relief.
---
Hey there!
---
I think your stats are fine for bossing. With that said, you may want to invest in 80+ range/def if you’re going to go zulrah/vorkath for faster kills and easier trips.
---
So wait, you’re telling me we can’t just buy the helm in the GE excluding iron men..?
---
It’s so satisfying when you finally finish all of those quests and realize all you have to worry about is the new ones that come out :) gz
---
 If you'd like to join my cc feel free to. We're all super tight knit but also very chill and relaxed and are all equals and run the cc in a unique way.

---
Yea but tassets are best in slot, these robes are not.  Nobody would pay the current price for tassets if there was some 80 defense legs with 6 strength bonus
---
Agreed, its greal QoL, but I don't think its so incredibly game breaking that having a delayed pouch ruins anything

10% chance for it to knock you off and then go on to stomp on you for a max hit of 73
---
“Sup I’m aids as fuck and drop nothing useful”
---
ah, I didn't even catch that! I bet you are right
---
They would also have more gp from a sink increasing item prices

Appreciate it. That was by far the hardest Achievement Cape grind yet.

I can’t tell if you’re trolling or what. You make no sense. This is completely incoherent. Are you saying you got banned for botting?

damn, miss the OG hero pure pk vids in varrock wildi
---
It wouldn’t be far behind. It’s objective that it would be too strong with that healing effect. Maybe a healing affect as a special attack, not as a passive though.
---
I just meant them being untradeable is a boon, other seeds are buyable

You look hungry to me!

!?!?

5. :( lvl 70-75. The xp is awful.
---
Indeed! Cant wait to play the new Fremmenik quest! Sounds and looks a lot of fun.
---
Yes i kept dying at zalcano from this
---
Niceee
---
Kush clan - pvm/pvp/chill
---
Yeah the new quest looks like it’ll be great. After getting quest cape it’s more enjoyable to do these quests because you know it’s the only one you have to do lol
---
It's horribly antiquated design, but runelite makes it much easier, especially tele and alchemy room.
---
Ahhh the wamen easter egg
---
Master diaries would be sick as fuck. I think there is definitely room to add them in
---
I don't think HC should limit the content we can get in OSRS (and I believe Mod Ash has said something similar). HCIM chose to limit themselves and are a minority in the game.
---
i mean you could just set it up to minimize the current active window and have an Excel sheet or something open underneath
---
Pretty sure it's Elena. I tried to find a video of it after the quest, because I accidentally clicked the wrong chat option at the siege in the underground pass and missed the conclusion.
---
Would "Goblin Diplomacy" be doable for low lvl players?
---
LIB or DEM I cant remember which
---
u/mazrim_lol would like a word with you
---
Then you literally just repeated the text on the post?
---
Thats why i was confused
---
And summoning a camel boss immediately afterwards
---
It’s max hit is based off the max melee hit but the attack is magic based(more accurate on melee armor) and accuracy rolls from slash bonus. The max hit is in the 70s. It’s just a korasi sword from rs2
---
Look at his Rex KC. He stopped killing the other 2.
---
Your title and the actual contents of your post are confusing.
---
That’s title seems clear, but the post itself makes no sense. I don’t understand what you’re suggesting.
---
If it’s simply that bosses who have a pet drop should also drop uniques that can be used towards a roll at the pet, then I don’t see the point.
---
1342 of those dag kills are just on Rex. He got seers and archer within like 100 kills combined for the other two.
---
Wiki says the rate is 1/30
---
I didn’t even know med clues could give master clues because I’ve done 83 and haven’t gotten a single one lol. How do I get rangers before a master clue with a 1/30 drop rate.
---
Within 111 kills total of Supreme and Prime. That's under half of droprate.

Lootshare took the ge price of items and split the drop up into gp thus causing gold inflation. It was the start of the demise of RS3’s economy
---
Touché, good sir.
---
Have you thought that maybe not everyone browses reddit 24/7
---
Especially when they talk shit while you die when they’re getting 12 d bones to split across five people lmao
---
It’s called a joke
---
Out of pure curiosity, why would you be again shardshare?  As I see it, it would be a way to evenly distribute loot without introducing GP into the game (like coinshare did)

Yeah, one for the SoB (which already is in game in the form of Guthixian icon + SoTD) and one that is currently in the middle of a poll:
---
&gt;Should we add an ability to purchase a dragon's tear from the LMS Reward shop as described in the blog? When used with a Staff of the Dead, the staff will have identical stats to the Staff of the Dead but with a special attack that fires a magical fire ball at your opponent hitting similar to a ballista spec. This special attack will cost 65% per use.

Yeah, I just got done killing him my 42nd time in that 122 task, starting to feel pretty over it haha

Of course! That's not really the issue. There can be fun and flavorful magic in a medieval/fantasy RPG, but historically RuneScape has always been fairly grounded. Even when things get crazy there is an underlying sense of authenticity and grit that comes with every story, race, or item. 
---
New updates (like Vorkath, SOTE) have pushed the game further and further into high fantasy. Think of it like the difference between WoW vs. Arthurian Legend. 
---
Merlin is the greatest wizard of all time in those Medieval tales, but would get absolutely destroyed by a level 1 BElf. Even magic in Medieval fantasy tales like Lord of the Rings is more grounded and subtle than RuneScape these days. 
---
I want to experience the game with no frills, no fancy spells, no unrealistic fast travel methods, nothing that takes away from the grounded experience of the Medieval era. I also want to share that experience and educate people on what those times were really like! :)
---
Being finished with the inventory &amp; they’re hitting zeros, throwing that line out will never get old
---
Which step and what diary are you talking about?
---
&gt;	The msb(i) is not imbued through NMZ, it is just a scroll you can purchase from the GE and use it on any old magic shortbow. It’s only like 25k IIRC.
---
Well that’s... certainly a lot easier than I thought it would be!
---
&gt;	Doing underground pass (an rfd requirement) will let you use Ibans blast, which should get you through any quests or slayer tasks where magic is required/most beneficial. It’s a very powerful spell.
---
I haven’t actually used Ibans blast yet, but I have completed Underground Pass! I think it might be my least favorite quest so far lol. But I’ll definitely look into giving that spell a try!
---
&gt;	I’d say your upgrade order should be: Sara Sword[str training]/whip -&gt; Fury -&gt; Berserker Ring, with a black mask ahead of any of that if you choose to do slayer)
---
This is very helpful. Though, I’ll probably skip the whip since one of my long, long term goals is to PK with a med build.
---
&gt;	If you’re interested in slayer (which will become somewhat profitable around level 75 slayer), I’d recommend getting a black mask and a saradomin sword and working your strength up to 85
---
I am very interested in slayer, I just haven’t prioritized it yet. Perhaps I should. Regardless, I’ll keep this in mind for sure.
---
&gt;	I prefer to make most of my money passively through farming. I do ranarr runs. I also do birdhouses, cactus spines, and yanillian hops for money, but these are all just extra. Ranarrs are the bulk of your profit.
---
 This seems like the most practical option given my available playtime. I love doing birdhouse runs!
---
&gt;	If you want to mainly do NMZ, I’d recommend investing your cash into full Obsidian armor, with the berserker necklace and the obsidian sword.
---
I’ve heard this recommended often, but never understood why. Would you care to explain? Is there a reason full obby is recommended for NMZ but isn’t recommended elsewhere?
---
&gt;	Runecrafting is actually a suprisingly good end-game AFK moneymaker. At 77 rc you would unlock bloods and these are supposed to be very afk and offer over 500k gold per hour.
---
Another long, long term goal of mine! I actually really enjoy RC, but I’m waiting to train it until I finish more achievements diaries to help get through the earlier levels of RC.
---
Thanks for your response, mate. Really great stuff.
---
Punished by both Gods, for using a light ballista, and wearing Guthix D’hide. Left to roam the battlefield alone deprived of both friend and foe.

I’m personally a mage, I find being a mage the most entertaining and also hits the hardest.. also I’ve always been into robes and those kinds of outfits, I recommend becoming a ranger because they look really cool too

This is the best one yet

Would that be a double negative?
---
That was coinshare. With lootshare the item is still dropped.
---
Sn-iff-co-caine
---
I say “r-done” but I’m probably wrong
---
This is happening to me. I believe it’s just the servers because the streamers I watch always freeze up in game at the same time as me. I’ve been doing Vorkath for 2 weeks so it kinda freaking me out, but luckily I haven’t died as a direct result of lag yet.
---
Lmao in your rage you forgot to black out your sensitive info and that was your second mistake.
---
Thanks for the account kiddo I’ll be taking it fr ur hands
---
Did the large frogs become gay or did gays turn into large frogs 🤔
---
&gt;	The magic shortbow scroll is a tradeable scroll worth about 40k at the time of writing this post. You don’t need NMZ for it.
---
Huh, TIL! Thanks
---
Good eye. Now see what the guy has equipped next time my guy before commenting.
---
From the wiki: 
---
Regardless of how much damage the player dealt to the monster, if they share LootShare with the group that dealt the most damage and are within 16 squares of the defeated monster, then they are eligible for LootShared items. When a player receives a drop, the value of the item(s) on the Grand Exchange is subtracted from the player's chances of collecting another item, which is called commonly "LootShare points" (lsp). When a player receives a high valued drop from a monster, it is very likely their "LootShare points" will be depleted. The surrounding players also in the LootShare group gain a fraction of the "Lootshare points" based on the number of players in the group. Effectively, the chances of getting a drop increases every time someone else in the group gets a drop.
---
DW it isn’t a scam come trade me fally bank on the pvp world and I’ll give you rune
---
Pkers camping it would drive up the drops prices making it even more worth while risking getting pked for a drop.
---
People would start to wonder why you have been reading the same book for years hah
---
i do
---
I pronounce it Ardougne(how it supposed to be pronounced), but some people like to pronounce it Ardougne, which is fine too i guess.
---
They’ve always denied saying this whenever it comes up on the OSRS discord.
---
I really doubt it’s difficult. Isn’t the vet’tion safespot behind the rocks and flinching it? Just remove the rocks
---
Jeez that's wild. Maaaybe I'll try my luck haha
---
They can't do anything to get rid of private clients. Unless you want more outrage.
---
If they nan 3rd party clients as a whole, then this games gonna be dead so fast. The Majority use runelite and osbuddy.
---
but how can you tell if it's gonna b your last hit? what if it hits a 0, then another 0 at lower attack speed? How do you decide if it's worth it to even try chally?
---
If you find that entertainmenting (OSRS, funny? I think not!), it just indicates that you have a most juvenile sense of the entellegence. It is pathetic that such childish activities can entertain one who's mind is so underdeveloped (unlike mine, I matured quickly for my age). I think you have much growing up to do, although I fear that even whenceupon you do so, you will still be just as immature and dumb as is the currency of the situation of your brian right now. Don’t worry - I have many, many friends that I have had stern talkings to about maturity and whatnot.
---
It is the shame of the century, the darkness that glimmers as the light fades away into the snow. (Sorry, sometimes I let my axtensive creative writing skills bleed into my critisisms) My point being, develop your IQ so that you may find entertainment in more mature matters then this. :)
---
Happy ‘Scaping everyone (That’s RuneScaping for short)!

waaaaat? You mean I wouldn't get hacked/recovered if my personal info is secure, my email has 2step and my rs account with authenticator and never shared my rs account??? dont be dum dum AUTH DELAY PLS I KEEP GETTING HOCKD JOMFLEX PLS
---
Plate of bacon
---
There are plenty of non safespot methods for all the bosses. Callisto duo or trio with veracs is better than safespot even.
---
Don’t worry bro I thought the same thing. I got my heads for slayer helm at like 200 something. I’m at around 700 now and still no pet tho
---
camels drink water
---
Fucking lol
---
Start over and make an iron man it’s been the most fun I’ve had in the game in years. End game stuff is kinda boring just doing slayer non stop everyday or bossing it’s the same thing.
---
You aren’t pink skirt but this will do. 10/10 meme

Very clearly a robot. The future is now, old man.

That is insane. Gz!

Damn bro life ain’t this serious

Lol refund hackers? If people are stupid enough to type their username and password into a ojising site and then also not have 2fa. They deserve to get hacked for being so dumb.
---
damn you found my deep wilderness mining and smithing superheat mage pure ultimate hardcore ironman's anvil, guess i'm fucked
---
Which one?
---
I personally liked the corrupt dragon equipment. It added more variety to F2P without making it too broken. To add, the Rune Gauntlets along with the Rune Berserker Shield also existed upon its release which definitely made a difference in DPS when it came to using the equipment together.
---
I personally don't think the re-release of corrupt dragon equipment to F2P will be game changing.
---
Most people aren't unfortunately
---
The formula is the sum of monsters' combat levels + 2*(number of brothers killed). So if you're killing all six brothers that's plus 12. All brother combat levels total to 656 so we take 880-12-656 equals 212. That's the sum of crypt monster combat levels you're looking for.
---
I never got to utilize lootshare in rs2. I’d be down for it being added to osrs. I’d actually be cool with going to gwd this way. And raids would be less sketchy with randoms
---
Can you believe it? People use programs to be more efficient in the game where people will spend days in game to find a process that is 1 tick faster or gets 1 more hit in the cycle compared to the previous meta. Who would have guessed.
---
This game doesn't promote taking the hard way. It promotes taking the most efficient way.
---
I'd argue acc security and clan system is likely something most people care about. 3rd party are pretty much used by everybody and I haven't really seen people be against current death mechanics. Customer support is a meme until you have to deal with it though
---
You gonna repost ya repost of ya post next bro?
---
There's that crazy shit where you aggro, walk south to a grey tile, walk one over and north 5 spaces, dance twice, bow once, dig, equip a rune platebody 3 times, then call your grandmother.
---
I got my first b ring on 63kc the other day! And dragon axe and warrior ring on like 20 and 40kc
---
... But classic's botting problem is even worse? makes no sense
---
where has this notion come from, im a skiller and do all that, never had a problem with sore wrists.
---
3rd party clients are more broken than 1:1 AHK, but reddit doesn't care because they abuse it
---
I wonder how much of the playerbase is actual players and not bots.
---
Fuck I’ve never had this elite step before. What’re the reqs, besides dragon slayer obviously
---
Why his finger look like its ready to dds spec his anus?

J.e.w. should get you there! Careful though, lots of goblins around

Yeah for the 2nd or 3rd time now

Been killing mole a few times a day in hopes of the pet. No luck so far lol.

Make it be like a textbook / reference book
---
Aim for 50 firemakinng then go do wintertodt, you can get 99 in a week or two and itll give you starting cash to get gear for slayer.
---
9000 kc rn no baby
---
I agree with all of these except account security.
---
Account security is fine, we need people to be smarter with their computers and emails, there’s no account security fix that cures player stupidity.
---
It's a youtube link...
---
Was it a big team or a small team? I brought tanky enough gear and some brews/restores, and if it was a small team or solo pkers I could easily tank my way out and tele, it's only the really big teams that killed me, or small co-ordinated teams with like 5 people with 1 spear to slow down my eating/running + some ballistas/godswords.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Sounds good I'll try it out. Thanks!
---
How do bonds put gold into the game?
---
Its hard to go back to the basic client after you have such a nice ground items option, everything else is irrelevant to me and it seems to me a lot of other people are mentioning the same thing
---
I only commented on this meme because it's stupid. I'm saying everyone who finds this funny is a defective human being.
---
Brand new account with 1 comment.
---
his fucking face
---
do you think the game will drop to 8 players? there will still be people to talk to, if anything i found the early days of osrs with lower player count much more social than it is today
---
ohh big man you don't listen to anyone! nut case
---
Pretty much. When I said Gravite, I meant that more as an example of a new tier of weapon; it doesn't have to use its stats or even name. But even if they were still 1 hour degrade to dust like Corrupt Dragon, I still think it would be better to add a new tier for all style than just three melee weapons. If we were to just do a Melee, I'd rather it be just a KO weapon like a Baxe or 2H without primary weapons like scim or longs; a KO weapon is more useful for all styles (e.g. like Bow to 2H kind of stuff) while primary melee weapons would put it far ahead of others.
---
Got mines yesterday; first one

["We'd like to reiterate that we will not be banning any players specifically for using third party clients"](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/third-party-client-update?oldschool=1)

Since his currently not in combat you really think it is a spec switch? I will be honest I am not up to date on cwars meta but starting out with your spec switch seems odd
---
She said "give me a minute my hands are hurting from making the last two"

I think it's a brilliant idea and she'll crack on as soon as she's back from the kitchen making me a sandwich. Triangle of course, I'm no savage.
---
I’m unhinged lock me away! Last time I said ‘Nope’ I woke up in a straight jacket
---
&gt;No, they can't.
---
are you saying no one has ever been hacked because of the account recovery form?
---
please take a screenshot instead of taking a picture of your screen with a camera
---
These have been out for a while, I just don't think there was a median where people are in a fight long enough to notice it.
---
Now you're constantly fighting the same people over and over again so you can notice it.
---
That and it's not something you have to dig through obscure forums and pay someone a monthly subscription for.
---
Yes it was
---
What's idiotic is saying that because they're worth money, they must have good customer service, while also dismissing the idea that more valuable companies have worse.
---
Jagex isn't going to spend more money because you scream at them, they're a business first, foremost, and only, so more CS means less somewhere else, probably devs.
---
Disagree to the no polling part. This would be a significant change to the game and I think it's fair to poll it.
---
&gt;its driving people away fast
---
Is it? I bet it's just an extremely visible but very tiny percentage of people that are quitting the game over any perceived issues. And I bet Jagex has more accurate data on that than any players do.
---
You wouldn’t even see her before you’re knocked out on the ground and all your shit is stolen
---
What do you mean? There's no rares in osrs like rs3 (party hats, santa hats ect.) but expensive drops usually fluctuate depending on bis lists for current content and meta. Obscenely expensive stuff tends to drop in price as more people start farming it.
---
B rings have been pretty consistent in price always seems to settle around 3 - 3.5m
---
Gpu rendering does that to me when teleporting
---
It was merely a crude joke
---
that doesn't answer my question, why does mlm need any buff
---
bruh whats your league name
---
I agree completely, it doesn’t make sense why they avoid it so much.
---
If you got your info linked, you're probably not being safe anyway to be fair. Anytime news of some database getting leaked, check haveibeenpwned and change all your passwords. Also use a different password for everything so they can't get everything if your neopets account from 12 years ago gets leaked
---
I guess the counter argument can be the skill cape perk is useless.
---
Hey that'd make a great minigame
---
Yea I don't really understand it.
---
If there were really a market of that many people who preferred the player interaction, then there'd still be people in fally.
---
Inside job.
---
morgan braden
---
While zulrah bots are a big issue the price drop also may be due to power creep
---
It's a noob wasting stats from not wearing a helm,cape, gloves, or necklace slot?
---
They're never going to let 3rd parties interact with real Jagex code. They care barely keep their internal staff from fucking things up for their own benefits.
---
Their client already does absolutely everything they want it to: lets you play the game. If there's something specific you want in the game, ask for that as a feature.
---
Only met one small team of 3, but the rest were all solo pkers.
---
And no, I don't bring any supplies. I bring a torag body, bulwark, crafting cape, and the ds2 orb with protect item, and then just suicide with it after each inventory.
---
I figured I couldn't be bothered bringing noted bones and try to tank people out with how frequently I ran into pkers as it takes me like 20 seconds to crafting cape tele, bank, and tele to ghorrock and run south back to the altar vs spending up to several minutes tanking people to get away.

at the least make passwords case sensitive.

Outta my pussy hole made me laugh.

I too, would hate someone to be in my pussy hole.
---
Who? The guy ranging with no helm?
---
most players in classic bot and classic bots are not banned. I don't really see how a game with literally no anti cheat is better than one with one
---
3rd party client are a major issue that will probably never be fixed when they allow Runelite. It was best pre 2011 when noone cared enough but now anything to with pking sweatballs have scripts for unfair advantage
---
u/jagex_wolf

Or barrows gloves?
---
My brain is still in recovery mode from taking in your important, high level ideas.
---
My brain isn't big enough. Explain
---
"it's always been a problem" is absolutely NOT a solution!
---
spare 30 m for dhcb? Lol gratz
---
I’d pay a drunken sailor 75gp each time for that shortcut. Let’s employ some NPC.
---
Easy mistake bro
---
Holy shit just realized that’s not his eyes
---
You can try zulrah or something like that for money :)
---
Wait wait. Are you asking for a new engine? A new game engine...? Please tell me youre not
---
the pker needs to be unziping his robe bottoms
---
There are a few things that I would dislike on classic client. Shittier camera, can't see more, stiffer animations, no GPU rendering (this is a big one), no ground overlays and a few more
---
😩
---
Still need to get my kill, but grats on the free bp.
---
EXPOSED
---
If they have access to your email account, it doesn’t matter if you have an authenticator delay, they will delete the communication from Jagex and just get your account slightly later than they would have anyway. 
---
It all comes down to email security, if your email is secure, nothing else is required here, if it’s not, nothing else is sufficient to protect your account.
---
it isnt true
---
Claire Augustus
---
Touche, was actually doing a clue; so not fully geared
---
Reading through the rest of the thread a lot of people are saying security is fine as long as you aren't an idiot while a couple said Jagex promised a security update. Who knows anymore. Community will never be happy RIP
---
Strictly speaking yes, but his friend still stole 200m.  
---
He also mentioned not wanting to risk his account, I find it weird he wouldn't just ask his "friend" to risk it for him, it's the least he could do.
---
That's now how this works... that's not how any of this works.
---
The dev team isn't just a massive conglomerate that can only focus on one thing at a time. There are different teams that handle different projects, and different sub-teams within those teams which handle different aspects of development.
---
This is getting out of hand...
---
why does everything need a point? the world doesnt exist to serve the player, its an environment for the player to exist in
---
Wonder where you got the gear to go to vorkath after gerting cleaned.
---
Gujizz
---
why do we need a lobby?
---
why do we need mtx when jagex is already making record profits?
---
Shiccy Shiccy Bang Bang
---
I’m here with my Bandos, where you at? 😆
---
have you talked to a seer?
---
I fucking love this thank you 🙏
---
Does 25buttholes count as a suggestion?
---
Thats a lot of tears!
---
I can get double that with mith plates so idk. I may try a little blast furnace to try it. I did it when i got 60 and hated it. Kept mistiming
---
What do you mean? It's the same issue - the recovery system being broken allows BOTH changing email without confirmation AS WELL AS authenticator removal.
---
Instantly removing authenticator has nothing to do with authenticator removal delay? 
---
&gt; It all comes down to email security, if your email is secure, nothing else is required here, if it’s not, nothing else is sufficient to protect your account.
---
Going back to your email comment though, do you feel that is still a safe and accurate statement to make?
---
For those who aren’t aware of staff of armadyl from back in the day, it was a staff that was used to cast the spell storm of armadyl. Storm of armadyl require the staff, and an armadyl rune. The spell was unique in the sense it was 1 tick faster than other spells, being same as a whip or trident. Didn’t have any other special effects, but it had a max hit of 50-52? And it was super super accurate. Look up old storm of armadyl pking videos to see how strong the spell really was back in the day. If something similar was introduced in osrs, I don’t think it would be too OP. This would most likely be used more in pvp or than pvm. Mage needs a buff, and I think this would be just what it needs
---
Wait wtf are expert mining gloves
---
Have you considered staff bashing? That is assuming their client only goes off of the weapon in hand. If it only reads the weapon they will pray mage while taking melee damage.
---
How did you make the cash? Staking?
---
I got cleaned at the duel arena for 2B once. My friend lent me gear and a T Bow to use some time after that and I never scammed him. It ain't OPs fault. Some people are just pieces of shit and some aren't.
---
I'm grinding 93 crafting at the moment and have 80k glass i have to blow, so i hang around more social areas lol
---
I'm over 1700 KC without one, this brings me great sorrow
---
Wasnt it like... marsh calisthenics or something?
---
I believe it took me about 3.5x the droprate to get my KBD heads, and the dumb thing was that I bought the helm recolour beforehand to force myself to grind KBD...such a stressful week lol. Then I got vorkath head on 6 kc for Ava’s and then guaranteed head at 50 for helm
---
Lend us a tenner
---
the def is pretty negligible but the prayer is huge
---
lool, for me yeah, i think so, Rs was becoming a bit stale for me.
---
As i said somewhere down below, i have Irl friends who's accs i can use if i ever get the itch again to play
---
Almost seems that pvp is a lost cause at this point
---
Why did you get banned?
---
J U I C Y D U M P E R
---
*laughs in twisted bow*
---
lootshare was such bs
---
Take your time, legend
---
tbh I can't stand watching whenever gambit hosts(which is almost always) , too many umm ahhh ehhh uhhhh
---
Skittle sounding. Maybe with a nerds rope instead?
---
Botting has been a problem for over 15 years now. Of course we all know its a problem, but if there was an easy solution the problem would've been fixed.
---
Holy fucking shit. I just had such a reaction. Thanks.
---
Yeah I have found reddit to be pretty bad for politics. It's too bad. Real issues don't get discussed in good faith much.
---
Look at what runelite or osbuddy can do, now look at what something like alt-1 can do on RS3, where they're not allowed to interact with the client. It's vaaaaastly different, and vaaaaaaastly less appealing to people to actually want to use, especially if you risked getting perm banned for such a minimal impact.
---
If they so desired they could vastly limit the amount of outputted information, or see when that information is accessed.
---
But again, just the threat of being perm banned and forever losing your account if you do use something is enough to make the vast majority of people just walk away from them.
---
&gt;	The whip is really a tremendously powerful item for it’s cost, with it’s only drawback being that it can’t train strength.
---
Honestly, the only reason I don’t want a whip for now is because I want to try PKing with a 75atk/70def med level build. 
---
If I ever decide to max out my Atk/Def later on down the road, though, I will pick it up in a heartbeat!
---
&gt;	From the wiki:
---
&gt;
---
&gt;	When the platebody, platelegs, and helmet are equipped together, all obsidian weaponry will be given a 10% boost in melee accuracy and melee strength.
---
&gt;	https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Obsidian_armour
---
&gt;	The berserker necklace ... increases the amount of damage the wearer does when wielding an obsidian melee weapon (Toktz-xil-ak, Tzhaar-ket-om, Tzhaar-ket-em, or Toktz-xil-ek) by 20%. However, in exchange it lowers the wearer’s melee accuracy and your defences against all combat styles.
---
&gt;	https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Berserker_necklace
---
&gt;	So, again, since defense and accuracy are mostly irrelevant inside the NMZ, maximizing strength is the best way to go, and obsidian offers the best raw DPS outside of Dharoks armor with ~94+ hp.
---
Wow, that’s really interesting and helpful! I guess I know what my next melee upgrade is going to be!
---
Lol @ bondie problems.
---
Fuck it I think they should have a 1/1k d pick! They'd be hard to find so you can't just farm em. Man I really want this now.
---
Because motherload mine is so click intensive that it deserves an xp boost.
---
Lootshare helped a lot with grouping people.
---
&gt;Why would anybody be jealous?
---
&gt;&gt;You started with the comment about how non-ironmen are jealous 
---
Yes clearly I brought up jealousy. 
---
You're so dumb its causing me physical pain.
---
not aesthetically pleasing
---
I also want to start doing tithe farm to get the farmers outfit, among other things. Thoughts?
---
mlm is not click intensive
---
What customer support?
---
If you feel like you're getting the most out of your time on this game, you're doing it right.
---
The mobile client can go above and beyond 50 fps, so clearly the engine isn't the issue... It's the fact that the default client hasn't been updated in a decade.
---
Or just not being anti social and grouping up in the first place ? Lootshare is a game killer
---
Amazing analogy, absolutely hilarious please go don't speak
---
You only start to interact with people towards later game. Minigames are dead and there's only two quests (Shield of Arrav and Heroes Quest) where you directly interact with another player. I can tell you from a personal perspective, I only have 2-3 friends and I only talk to one of them and he's venezuelan lol. Every person I meet on this game that tries to be my friend is a lurer/scammer trying to get my tbow or is someone who I add and never talk to again. I also only do solo cox because I can't get a reliable duo and no one who I talk to wants to learn how to do it. I've joined a big pvm clan before, the experience sucked and it made me not want to join another clan again.
---
Absolutely true.
---
I got two snapdragon seeds and 2 brimstone key drops on my last slayer task and I’m pretty sure Iv peaked
---
90% of it yeah.
---
At least you can't burst for free or 6 hour guthans keeping your accounts logged in for 24 hours a day anymore.
---
I don't have a problem with NMZ as it is now it's just basically the same as bandit camp or a 3/4 spawn crab spot with the benefit of not having to deal with cancerous crashers every 10 minutes.
---
nice
---
Because Selling Gold is against Rules
---
Interesting thanks for sharing.
---
This was spoke about in the security blog under authenticator delay. Whether they are still doing that is anyones guess
---
Addy bolts for vorkath?!
---
Geez how long that take?
---
This lol
---
Like don’t get me wrong, the gains are amazing, but less so when you just chuck 100m and get 200m 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I like rs3 if I'm on my Iron man, the games decent as long as you don't abuse mtx.
---
dark world order has a decent series on it
---
A
---
The droprate for any zulrah item is 1/127 so you are not that dry, gl though
---
Somebody dropped a cherry ring pop, WHICH IS DELICIOUS BY THE WAY, and this steroid syringe which means one of you chuggernuts is juicin’!
---
That’s not unrecoverable. But a bond, sell it for 5 mill, use the 5 to gear up and do barrows. I’m over 8 mill in profit form 50ish runs
---
Gratz, that's insanely fast. Im glad when I get a sub 25 minute trio lol.
---
So that we can keep playing osrs fucker
---
oh fuck youre right, Im a doofus
---
I once put up a popular suggestion post about making attack and defense potions free-to-play since they're dead content in members. While I got a couple thousand upvotes, the vocal majority tore me apart for even suggesting the slightest change to F2P PvP. 
---
Corrupted Dragon won't be received well by the F2P PvP community, could end up doing far more harm than good.
---
To be fair, some issues mentioned aren't small.
---
-Certain clients (not even talking about runelite) have plugins which shouldn't be allowed (either being basically botting or making certain pvm activities insanely easy).
---
- account security
---
- customer support
---
etc. (read rest of thread for more stuff).
---
These aren't small issues.
---
The staker needs to take the risk of RWTing themselves in this case.  It's their fault, they need to fix it.  Giving OP IRL money with the intent of RWTing is like trying to pay back an IRL loan by robbing a bank, and giving the stolen and dyed notes to the person who gave the loan.
---
No problem, and thanks :)
---
Also applies to real life as well.
---
Nice! got it last weekend, it's tight
---
1. Starts
---
  *  Wolf, Ash, Husky, Gambit, JD (Briefly), Bruno(Chat)
---
2.  Deadman Seasonal is discussed.
---
  *  JD: We know there's been a lot of chat recently around what is happening here, with E-sports and the future. We are at the point of having hired head of E-sports and she's feeling out opportunities and putting together her plan. Toward the end of this year or perhaps early next, that'd be released. It's a big jump between where we were/are and where we want to be! When providing feedback and interacting with Jmods please always be constructive - no abuse please.
---
3.  Gambits Polo Shirt - check that out!
---
  *  Coming to the Merch store tomorrow, only in white for now. 
---
4. [IMAGE] Cerberus Fight - @ArtisteOsrs
---
  *  
---
5. [IMAGE] Fighting against Olm - @katecollects
---
  *  It's a gif - check that out!
---
6. Can we get a red text message in the chat box when we start a new quest? This would help players that wander around organically talking to 'quest start' icons on the map.
---
  *  Like the idea. Was discussing this when looking at the new player experience. We can improve the quest list we have too - to allow filtering and showing pre-requirement quests etc. 
---
7. Thoughts on adding more Grapple Agility shortcuts, as well as the option of adding Grapple to the Ava's collection bags?
---
  *  Maybe? Can change it but would likely make it so that grapples can break as usual. Those kinds of shortcuts are pretty graphics and dev heavy to make so would want them on content that gets used! 
---
8. Nerf Gold Ore buying from blast-furnace shop, add an alternative activity for this?
---
  *  Husky: Support! Don't want to absolutely gut Ultimate Ironman smithing but would be open to looking at solutions to avoid shop-scape! If you have any ideas feel free to send them in!
---
9. Could we make it so that the Monks of Entrana tell you what item they object to?
---
  *  At the moment their code simply checks to see if you have more than zero items in a certain weapon/armour category without actually identifying what the item is... But it should be possible.
---
10. Is Fremennik Exiles the last quest in that series?
---
  *  Nope! ED and Wolf have discussed a possible Grand-Master quest after as well as off-branches that haven't been touched anyway.
---
11. Fremennik Exiles will be released before the end of this month.
---
  *  Mod Wolf confirms this.
---
12. Upgrade POH combat dummies, max hit against dragons when using Dragonbane weapon or Wilderness weapons too. 
---
  *  Ash: Don't see anything stopping us with having another one (it might take a while).
---
13. What is your thought process behind corrupt dragon weapons included in BH reward blog?
---
  *  You'll notice a lot of few there are from RS2. Wanted to add things that were familiar but interesting enough to give an opportunity to add value, also to improve the F2P PVP experience. 
---
14. Currently a players first 99 cape can be kept untrimmed by a drop/teleport method, could the Trouver Parchment that came out with LMS be used to do this legitimately?
---
  *  While we could we wouldn't have a record of 99's that are already done. That would leave out a lot of players that already have multiple 99s. 
---
15. What are your opinions on maxing your POH as soon as possible? 
---
  *  Husky: YES! Always yes the pool is amazing and helps so much. 
---
16. The examine option is being prioritised on mobile, instead of being able to pick up items on the ground?
---
  *  Engine confirms this is a live bug, they are going to expedite this and get it fixed!
---
17. Why was the unique from Sarachnis that would lower the dark bow's speed by one tick removed?
---
  *  Husky: It wasn't 'removed' exactly, it was being discussed as an option on a dev-stream. Changing it by 1 tick wouldn't of changed it's problem. Ultimately; that buff wouldn't be good enough, we didn't know exactly where to go with it and we had a good unique in the Cudgel.
---
18. Were any accounts rolled back for abusing the Last Man Standing bug?
---
  *  Yes, we have a list and they are being looked at and will be addressed.
---
19. With Warding failing at the polls, has the team put any thought into other ways mid/high level pvm gear/alchables and clue items may be removed from the game?
---
  *  Husky: Haven't seen suggestions on that scale since Warding failed. --- Sinks need to have a reasonable reward and impact but not to be pointless. We can do things to item sink in many ways, chiselling Zulrah things for scales, Tentacles to upgrade staff, Construction in house etc, feel free to send suggestions! 
---
20. Could we make it so that there are more than 5 audio settings for volume?
---
  *  Could maybe yeah, but not something we have in the works right now. In the meantime set it near what feels right then balance using your computer volume slider. 
---
21. When is Bounty Hunter coming?
---
  *  Polling hopefully at the end of this week for a week, development will begin shortly after with a Beta sometime after RuneFest. Would like a full launch to come by the end of the year.
---
22. Can you slow down the number of updates per month so that the game doesn't change too rapidly?
---
  *  A lot of them don't actually change the game in a big way - for example Maz's POH advertising board coming tomorrow is more of a QoL or minor update whereas larger things like Song of the Elves and other quests are much less frequent. We have found that if we take weeks off or slow down update frequency it doesn't really change the end result. 
---
23. Can you make it so Stale Baguette is store-able in POH?
---
 * Coming next week with a few other items (Flippers etc).
---
Mass exodus would happen the instant they add MTX.
---
Holy crap the clan system is so useless! They need to add in useful member rank permissions.
---
If that worked, coinshare would have never existed.
---
&gt; That's now how this works... that's not how any of this works.
---
They've literally said that's how this works. One of the most common responses to mediocre suggestions they do on the Q&amp;A is "if the players want it, we can do it, but would you rather us work on x instead?"
---
Get mems asap, don't bother with f2p
---
Done :) 
---
/u/bitterbeggar too!
---
Jagex has blackballed me.
---
It’s a shit storm until you unlock teles, but yeah it’s a pretty good and rewarding experience
---
Hopefully. Personally when I level up my alt, if I ever get around to it, I'm going to grind 99 prayer at level 3 combat so I'm too low level for any pkers to get me lol. Eventually someone will bring a level 30 pure but most people probably won't have one lol.
---
well I mentioned the abyss, which most people don't use after 77. I didn't think that I needed to explain that.
---
Probably smart if you've got the cash up front
---
Saw an Orc legitimately FLYING over Hillsbrad yesterday and then I saw him again today.
---
I misclicked on the addy rocks at least 30 times from 85-86
---
I bet when you fart it sounds like hail stones on a tin roof
---
I use to see him a lot too when osrs came out
---
No I believe it’s FAG but I could be wrong
---
"I lend money to an addict and he won't pay me back!".
---
I don't know what you were expecting.
---
Oh 100% agreed. I just don't have the time to get into it like that anymore with house, school and work. I will keep it mind if I end up coming back in the future. After all, no one quits RS it's just a series of breaks.
---
Did you earn the gp or sand casino
---
So me and my bro in law boss together And we did our first ever raid and was also a duo.... was 3hrs so this brings me hope and hurts my soul.  Gz!
---
This isn't 2005 any more, most people will have a smartphone that is likely automatically setup to receive notifications when an email is received, hell, people play the game on their phone. Even if it were 2005 it wasn't uncommon to find desktop email clients setup to download emails as they were received.
---
But let's assume neither of these are the case, why then would it not be displayed in game upon logging in that a request to remove the authenticator has been received? Why would it not be visible upon logging into your account on the Runescape or the Jagex billing website? You get notified every time you login that you've changed your bank PIN settings, why would the last ditch effort to protect in game items have a better security model than the 2FA authenticator which protects legitimately sensitive real life information?
---
&gt;It all comes down to email security, if your email is secure, nothing else is required here
---
My email is secure because my email provider allows for mobile 2FA and informs me if somebody tries to remove it. My Steam account is secure because Valve allows for mobile 2FA and informs me if somebody tries to remove it. The 2FA on my RS account is less secure than the in game bank PIN system, which is already inadequate when compared with RS3.
---
Come join our community! Full of players who just want friends, to boss with others, and even raid. Open to all. Just don’t be toxic ✌🏻 
---
CC: Twelvey12 is how you can join!
---
yes!
---
I mean if we can poll what we would like we can have a healthy amount if mtx not in the actual game of osrs with the lobby with adverts or more stuff to do with bonds. Rs3 isnt going to last forver the rate its going at.
---
Your brawling gloves man!
---
I literally mentioned this in my post dude. U can also just sit in bh world (where u cant do that) because every person looking for a fair fight sits in that world or constantly checks it. And for people pking as a group of 2-3 u can just enter and exit a door at the same time over and over again until one of u has pid for a box. If u get caught with ur pants down, then i think its fair that you get killed most of the time.
---
*go collect this thing*
---
*go talk to this person*
---
*kill 25 of these things*
---
*talk to this person*
---
*get 20 of this item by killing this thing*
---
*kill some boss*
---
clean rinse and repeat and you have blizzard questing
---
OSRS isn't going to last forever if it continues to be as stale as it is, regardless of extra revenue from Adverts or MTX.
---
I was trying to find this video the other day! Thanks for posting. So iconic
---
What do you mean?
---
So there's no good solution than trust right
---
Either way we are fucked i guess.
---
I was, but I don’t think ppl got it lol. That or it just wasn’t funny
---
How is asking for the same gameplay that runs better even close to eoc
---
You can burst for free, but you need 5 people to make it efficient.
---
Jesus dude nice. Split I tb’d. Meetcha at ge
---
Why ya grinding xp post 99 may I ask?
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009
---
Then why are we talking dude. I'm not your tech support. I'm just letting people know there are safer ways to protect their accounts. Your phone number is safer. If yours doesn't offer it use a different one
---
Thank you so much for doing this - this saves the effort to listen/watch 1 hour stream when you can read them within a few minutes. \^\^
---
Brand new content is good for everyone, auth delay just helps people who share their accounts details with others :( half of customer support complaints are people trying to recover sold accounts and more group content is literally new content.
---
I've more or less mastered flame phase with melee but yeah it is pretty damn annoying, I died a lot when I first switched to lance, I might try claws there tonight, dwh is pretty neglible and you're right, bgs is probably better realistically.
---
is this bait? you’re effectively asking why there’s a limit on inventory space. if you can’t figure out a reason then please don’t vote in any future polls.
---
wait thats it? lol
---
The cheap stuff is mystic.
---
só?
---
Honest question where did dummy thicc come from? I've just started seeing it today
---
&gt;People are jealous because they understand that getting drops on an ironman is way more fun and exciting but they cba to start a new account and put all the effort into getting it to the end game when ironman mode really gets cool.  
---
Copied directly from one of your posts.
---
Just looking for some advice! I'm combat level 105 and fairly well rounded, with most of the stats being around 80. I've done every quest besides MM2, DS2, and the new elf quest. I actually stepped away from the game for about 10 months after doing every other quest and am just now getting back into it. I want to finish my quest cape, but I'm very scared that I'm not going to be mechanically skilled enough to do this safely without losing all of my gp (I only have like 30m).  
---
Any tips for getting back into combat, or any tips for these quests specifically?
---
Lol alright well let me lay it out very clear then. Dagonhai robes should never be put into Old School Runescape unless the appropriate quests from RS2/3 are also added to the game.
---
Good
---
Good luck
---
i think its a pre-written maybeee but that raises question what if they win. Do they manage to raise in time and say sit
---
Hate to hammer on this, but you can make arrowtips and other ammunition as well.
---
He didn't say 45 minutes
---
mining cape stacks with diary, comparing infinite teleports to finite jewelry is ridiculous, con cape to poh is absurd
---
this is clearly a comment from someone who doesnt have most of the capes or especially the absurdity of the max cape
---
Doesn't help when your IT can see what app your PC is running tho :^(
---
PREACH IT SISTER

baiii life!

I’m not sure where it is I don’t have photo creds, from my buddies insta who lives in SoCal. The next pic was the Hollywood sign so i guess if that’s near there

Nose bum

What's up with the 3rd party clients? Is there a problem with them now? Sorry for the dumb question, I haven't played in a good while...
---
Unless they’re superior. 5 superior bones is the best pk they’ll get all day
---
They've also said many of the "bots" were just players/gold farmers.
---
Yep
---
Or you could have hopped
---
Ty
---
Not everyone wants to play like an ironman and not everyone has a ton of trustworthy friends in this game. This would open up a lot more opportunities for pug groups and would be great for high-end PvM.
---
Honest question here, what good is castle wars? Like why do it? What rewards do you get that are worth it in game?
---
