Wishing you the best, hoping for a speedy recovery then you can get back to cutting willows and catching lobs w the boys

This would be a good platform to add that debuff system from Dominion Tower, when you'd progress further and further it would disable worn inventory slots, buff monsters, trigger poison on your character(s) and etc.
---
Why people willingly drop items still is beyond me. 
---

---
Gg mate live and learn
---
Slow stomp magic, fast stomp range ezpz
---
I did a single easy clue and got a fuckin ham joint drop. Like okay, solid fashionscape, but at least on my regular Ironman I could have drop-traded to my main for the gp
---
This entire fucking game is a gigantic grind fuck off it doesn't make a difference if you're killing 10k dragons or cutting 10k logs it's about the same level of interacting.
---
why did you have to drop stuff and why would you drop your entire bank instead of, like, anything else?
---
This makes no sense.
---
I didn‚Äôt even realize that you needed a house to get the exp for construction and nearly made it to 99 on T.L with no construction exp üôÉ

The hell are relics?
---
Yea man it literally ONLY happens on twisted worlds. and it's constant, I dc within 5 minutes usually. Not much I can do it seems
---
Wow! It is almost like you didn't read my comment where I said i came back after two years to fuck around. I know it must be hard though, that's a lot of words for you. Good job you're doing great!
---
While that's true, most overworld bosses are super campy, lacks intuitive mechanics or otherwise feel archaic, are all subject to outside griefers, and lack a group rewards system. Raids and the like manage to avoid all of these issues.
---
Runelite is also having issues, but they modified the client to bypass it temporarily.
---
it's like if every impling was a lucky and everyone was swampletics
---
surprised they let you use a phone in your cage.
---
If the guy had dinhs relic then he got three dragon axes. No need to keep three
---

Hopefully they drop dt2 with a desert expansion then do leagues there

Ok calm down there prayer gang Peter.

That plugin is not allowed by jagex so runelite removed it a long time ago.

He casts tele other
---
Why 80?
---
Thats part of the lure, you drop your expensive items in return for like, a lot more. I thought the lure was purely the teleport, so I tried to take the money, not use the teleport, and pick back up my items.  What happened instead was..well it didnt turn out well lol.
---
I believe he was not as popular as the rest

Good luck my man!

Seems like a video card problem either a crash or failed to load drivers, and if you enabled GPU that might be the reason of why it won't boot.  
---
I would reinstall video drivers and reboot.
---
It's been going on for past two days. Doesn't seem to affect the majority of people playing though, so jagex doesn't seem to really care.
---
A mod basically said just spam open the client until you get lucky.
---
Nice one :) is this with QP cape? You'll get to that 200 mark soon
---
It must suck to look in the mirror and think, ‚ÄúSomeone else needs to feel shittier than I do right now.‚Äù Mean spirited, hateful, sub-7th-layer-of-hell-IQ mentally inbred troglodytes don‚Äôt last in the real world, hun. Get a life.

Yeah, he posted a "I'm back" video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heWwxBi5gAM with some pics and such. He also just did a 24 hour livestream.

Went on to the actual rs forums and found a solution. I‚Äôm not the only one with the problem getting the client to load.
---
If anyone else has an issue with ‚Äúloading config - 0%‚Äù spam click the launcher to open 3 windows. Do this until it finally loads. All three will load, and it took me 5 attempts.
---
J1mmy Productions, very nice. You gonna do a video on twisted leagues, J1mbo?
---
I thought they would capitalize on the popularity of Swampman and do it there. I can see all the npcs in all grey with grey hair now lol
---
Good luck!
---
Anybody know some good social clan chats that I can join?
---
Good luck my man. Go into surgery with that face and you'll come out 10x stronger!
---
Good bot.
---
He was hovering 130-180 viewers on his 24 stream the other day. Not amazing, but not bad either.
---
I think rather than nerfing EE, the other two should be buffed to be equal. Accumulator to 95%-100% and dark altar a higher exp buff. The relics are meant to be powerful!
---
Ah dope as :)
---
Take Endless Endurance you'll thank us later. Also don't forget to shout "Walker" every time you see someone walking.
---
Good luck my man.
---
They have been. There was a post on reddit a few months ago where a player was left freewalking on the ardougne agility stall and other posts where players were affected by rollbacks
---
True, ill see if that 1 ranged level makes a difference.
---
Agility bad
---

Yea this Twisted league is so much better than DMM

Money is only as good as what you spend it on. I don't understand this arbitrary number goal you set yourself, mine are usually "get X amount of money to put it into Y", but if arbitrary goals do it for you then go for 1B platinum tokens, that will keep you busy.
---
I love it. I hope you do one for Konar.
---
Customer service desk/cash office closing. Usually do AFK Skilling since I can‚Äôt put too much attention into it. Just click a few times, do some work for however long (varies from skill to skill) and come back. Also do flips while at work.
---
You still need to get those nuggets
---
Because there isn‚Äôt really anything similar to pets in terms of cosmetics, most actually do something or aren‚Äôt 1/2-3k.
---
People are upvoting this because they recognize the names. Wilder having more power than those two is not a hot take, he really might be the hardest puncher of all time. He has ungodly power.

I'd love a perma league world, even if it's just 1 world like W45 dmm. 2 months is obv.plenty of time to do most things but for those that only play a few hrs a session it becomes stressful. plus with all the work wiped after 2 months it's demotivating unless you're part of the select few that can play ~18 hrs/day
---
ZMI gives 34k an hour if you bank effectively up to 75, and after 75 you can get like 45k an hour. It's all about using bank fillers and using two pouches.

No. You can clean finds for a 1/97.5 chance for a 500xp lamp in a skill above 30. Have also had no clean pendants..

Eventually a clan becomes so demoralised that they either stop returning to the fight or they start one item suiciding for two hours, like RoT did.

This is funny because I have considered having my kids learn to do farm runs instead of letting them play on their iPads ... hmmmm
---
Speculation around zulrah lock maybe?
---
How afk is it?
---
The hit splat appears first but on the same game tick when you have pid. The poison tick was clearly a full tick before the 2nd poison tick
---
For those confused, the guy should have fallen on the same game tick Oda got hit by poison. His opponent hit 0 hp on a game tick, then another game tick occurred and Oda got hit with poison. At this point the opponent should have done the death animation on Oda's poison tick, but he didn't. There's controversy going on that the opponent stalled the death animation somehow (with absorption pots?). His name is also very unusual and has double name changed a few times.
---
Edit: He ended up doing a 5b stake against the same guy again and won. Then he doubled down and went 11b and won. So he got his money back off the guy, but sucks he lost to the nonsense in the first place.
---
yeah streamer with 2k+ average viewership scams 400 bucks 
---
real context is the pmer is at palms to lend him 5b to chuck for the stream stretchgoal
---
fishing lvl?
---
bug abuse or lag?... what happened jagex?
---
You may not get any more comments, but i felt like this was super fucking heartfelt, really earnest and true, and overall a super great post! So, while you may not be bathing in karma, I hope you feel good about taking the time to reflect on your life and relationships and also sharing a great piece of content to maybe inspire others...thanks bro!
---
You must've missed the clip of sicknerd and devious talking about it and how it was being talked about in a secret content creators only discord. (which is literally what i posted). 
---
Put all the little pieces together and you got questions. Questions aren't harmful, but they sure as hell were being removed and censored. 
---
Any mention of it was absolutely being censored by the mods.

Shame you didnt post this before I tried it with groot. Good to know theres a reason behind the roaming tekton though. I hope they dont patch it, roaming pets are fun.

Hm, might try it some time in the main game then. Especially with the runelite library plugin which is just straight up OP

Waaaaaah
---
The procedure is pretty neat. I could explain it in extreme detail if you wanted, as I‚Äôve seen dozens. Up top is basically the gist. The point was, for some a gruesome seeming, massive surgery, you‚Äôd actually expect a HARSHER recovery than I believe it to be. It‚Äôs actually quite crazy
---
House
---
Music definitely missed the mark but I‚Äôll give a passing 6/10
---
I've heard slayer helm going for 50m, but we will see. 6k points requires a bit of effort if you dont play often. But over the span of 2 months, I think it's pretty attainable for most people. We will see when it happens.
---
When I got back into old school runescape, I had used an account I created for RS3 but never used. I had started as a skiller and people would do this to me and it was really annoying. I later found out that account had a server mute because someone hacked it and used it to advertise, so I realized everyone just thought I was a bot.
---
u wish
---
making the game more fun = go back to fortnite ok lmao btw im almost 2.1k total. skilling just fucking sucks. nothing about it is fun at all. it should be legitimately used as a torture method somewhere to do runecrafting pre-77 or to run 400 laps of agility for one fucking level. absolutely awful game design.
---
why did he panic turn private off as soon as it popped up?

Shittiest post on this reddit

I‚Äôve been enjoying WildMudKip‚Äôs series a ton, Mr Mammal‚Äôs is pretty entertaining too, both seem to genuinely be enjoying playing and having a great ass time
---
Honestly yeah because if someone comes across the osrs page and sees a bunch of streamers 3tick fishing I guarantee you they‚Äôll either leave within 5 mins or fall asleep. Oda is the most entertaining despite his zumbassity on top of being one of, if not the most skilled pking streamer
---
Fuck hippy rangers.

Man i went to his 99 construction party back in the day, there was so many people i lagged so bad i could barley move or see anything lol

Statistically challenged is a good TL account to watch too, he‚Äôs also one of the few to pick the abyssal accumulator.  He‚Äôs famous for his wildiness only Ironman if you haven‚Äôt seen it.
---
You ever stop and realize we use feathers as bait but not things like worms?
---
This is scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel as far as content creation goes
---
I'm fairly certain the ranged gilded items are not available from hards - only elites and masters. Finishing a significant amount of elites is very difficult without having either 83 hunter or 95 slayer in order to get that mystic piece.
---
What
---
I don't think I'd be opposed to endless endurance at 99 agility and buffing up the benefits to other levels.
---
Not the real reason.
---
fuck all of you losers accusing someone of rwting when there is absolutely no context provided, this guy has been trusted with money that all of your banks wouldn't even be close to a quarter of it.

Hey! Mine was the 8th!

How is ‚ÄúNo‚Äù a no but ‚ÄúYes‚Äù is a yes, it seems that ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is reflected ‚ÄúYes‚Äù yet remains no. I get ‚ÄòNO‚Äù and ‚Äúwtf‚Äù just not the difference between ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and ‚ÄúYes‚Äù
---
Thanks. Honestly, I'm just happy to get it off my chest. As you can imagine with my past it is sometimes hard to express my emotions to others face to face so sharing it here just felt right. I know my aunt would be happy if she read it and that is worth way more to me atm then a million karma.
---
I‚Äôve been supplementing with XP lamps from varrock museum/fossil cleaning - getting the fossils from Sulliuscep cutting.

Less per hour than just training directly, but it‚Äôs great WC XP.
---
Yeah agility cape perk doesn't seem too wonderful tbh
---
As a kid I ALWAYS saw them as a beds and never understood why it was the icon for plate skirts.
---
Yes.
---
Think thats the general idea and that is frowned upon by most people. There‚Äôs nothing stopping me from going to Alfie or any other big streamer and giving them 100m to chuck into the arena. I might enjoy watching streamers stake, feeling like im part of the stream by giving him money. 
---
To me, it boils down to the community being taken advantage of. Maybe not with malicious intent, but nobody wakes up and thinks ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait to give hyphonix 1b tonight‚Äù. They only get viewers gp because they‚Äôre streaming. Maybe the streamer says ‚Äúalright im down xx gp, better call it a night‚Äù then a viewer gives them money to not stop staking.
---
piss in bottles to recycle
---
RNG  is a a bitch
---
That 'maintenance' was a band aid fix to stop the exploit caused by server crashes. They probably broke something else. Try using a vpn from a different location to yours to login.
---
I flushed my DNS and was able to login.
---
is this even grieving or is it just a strategy to make sure he stays higher on the twisted league scores? 
---
Yea it‚Äôs a dick move for sure but isn‚Äôt this whole thing a rat race to the top ?
---
Thought this was some almighty cheat code at first but it seems super inconsistent. Have every type of impling tagged, catch/see it caught with the spawn tile rendered and the marker only shows up half the time anyway. Honestly more frustrating than just going at it blind like I had been because it just doesn't seem to make any sort of sense.
---
Also how many were you killing an hour?
---
One isn't inherently better than the other but the "Yes" one follows the suggested route on the w√≠ki, so more people are likely to use it.
---
Everyone should be splitting the farm the same way so they don't accidentally mess each other up by going the opposite way somebody else expected
---
Thanks for the kind words. Also, I feel like my aunt would want me to tell you that even if you may not know it there are more people in your life than you could imagine that love you unconditionally and no matter what you are going through they are there to help you. 
---
Additionally, from my own experience, I would say this, know that everything has an opposite in life. Your darkest days just mean that your brightest days are just ahead of you. Hang in there and things will get better :).
---
You can at any level, just slower xp.

Yes

lmfao brilliant

1 dragon dart/arrow drop and you're set tho

I'm not entirely sure, but you could try just resetting your router, which should also reset your IP. I'd imagine getting a VPN would give a similar effect.
---
I'd gladly pay 10 bonds for endless run.
---
wow you shit on that dude lol
---
That probably puts it on par with infinite stamina for solo raids. If you haven't done solo raids before, stamina is a requirement to be anywhere remotely close to efficient. Dragon darts/arrows are appreciably more dps and they would be great for solos, but not a requirement.
---
Iron?
---
thats why pking content is the best
---
Same thing happening to me, first time this happened to me.

Edit: Clearing cache fixed it for me.  %USERPROFILE%\\jagexcache\\oldschool\\LIVE  Type this in search bar and delete the folder. Restart game.

I dont know about yoy, but i do the last one
---
I think the process is irreversible.. Sorry m8
---
I doubt they would. You can always bond another acc then trade the rewards to your main (unless your main is an Ironman)
---
I think it's because pid in pvp is randomized every stake now instead of when you log in. Just because your pid in that stake is better than your opponent's doesn't mean that your pid for the server is better.
---
Just ban him please
---
they have downtime every week when the server resets
---
Lmao maybe its another pker loot and he came back for it
---
Leagues are a new game mode where you start from scratch with a new character and complete various tasks to gain points. Points unlock relics which give bonuses during the league and can also be used to buy rewards in the main game after the league is over. Each league has its own special rules.
---
Twisted League is the first league which started a week and a half ago and lasts until mid-January. You play as a Zeah-locked ironman and gain 5x experience in every skill.
---
That's probably what I'm going to end up doing, I just know that they're planning on giving some rewards that will carry over (very small rewards), including pets, and so I'm going to want to play the next league on the same account D:
---
Nice one :)
---
Please tell me I'm not being whooshed rn
---
Damn dude thanks. Apparently I've been living my Runescape life like an ogre the past few weeks.
---
Only watchin Ricecups series. This is one of the main reason a lot of youtubers new series suck at the start is i domt wanna watch the same quests/skills over and over and over

Is base 85 good enough for corrupt gauntlet?

How so? The comparison is the top viewed OSRS stream. They tend to be the most viewed stream as they viewbot.

&gt;	serie
---
Well i understand where youre coming from, but its not the teams fault, its meta change and the fact that the wild is dead already, look at 2008 pvp/bh or when wild came back in 2011 vids, its so active everywhere and mystics was good to pk in, now it isnt anymore, everyone knows what their doing, tickeating, ags gmauling &amp; teleing, i honestly think the wilderness and pvp is hopeless
---
It could honestly go down the road of path of exile. Where leagues became the main game and standard is still there but not competitively played anymore. I don't know how if feel about thst. If everyone would support it then I'm more than happy too but if there's too many people against it, I don't want them to take a gamble that could stuff up the future of runescape like that.
---
25% cause you gotta roll 2 separate 50/50s
---
Or well, all twitch content that is
---
You can make a good youtube series on the basis of many many hours of grinding condensed into the highlights.
---
Watching entire grinds on twitch is basically just being there for the streamers personality and waiting for the occasional Pog moments. I generally have streamers I like on as background noise while playing the game myself and only really watch their screen when they go mental over a drop lmao
---
Depends, if it's a 99 then it's always  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@, but for most other things it's a simple "Nice"
---
I was especially peeved with the way the J mods talked about it on stream, too. Where they were 100% settled on relics having these downsides. It's like... why? Why intentionally make the game less fun in one way, but fun in another?
---
Why not just... make the game fun in one way, and leave it at that? The difficult decision part should be about the bonuses the relics give vs each other. Not regret down the road cause it turns out the relic itself actually hinders your gameplay. No one at all finds that fun.
---
They existed before twitch prime btw
---
What song was playing in the clip?
---
So funny when Mammal calls them beds
---
Mudkip, bekt and mintmadcow for me
---
Even now he can get calles Mister Baiter
---
Absolutely well said. I'm fine for part of the design to be a negative alongside a positive. But in a 2 month mode meant to make you feel like a super different way of playing the game, they didn't do a lot with the relics and kinda stayed safe while having some be really poorly balanced.
---
Fair. Perhaps just allowing players to then plant the hard fruit tree they 'skipped' at least could be nice.

According to the wiki abby demons drop elites which should mean they're still 1/10 with the relic from them. Either way OP only has 8 elites and he's only 79 slayer and 35 hunter. So he's doing something else for them to turn them in.
---
Yup. Guess I need to camp vorkath for 4 days too. Damn.
---
Chromatic dragons (like blue, red, and black) including brutal versions have their fire damage reduced by prot mage.
---
Metal dragons (like iron, steel, rune) can only have their fire damage reduced by antifire shields and potions.

I took a year off uni to finish a few exams I had left over and found a job so I didn't just slack off at home. It was some manufacturing gig where I had to oversee 2 machines that did everything on their own, I just had to click start every few minutes. I mostly had the afternoon shifts, which allowed me to study for my exams and when there were no exams, watch Netflix/play osrs since no one was there to watch over me.
---
You lose it. Just pick it up and switch worlds to F2P. You'll likely not die there.

Thank you.

Just play the game normally u rat

It took me at least 20 tries with maxed combat stats, mind you that was near release without looking at any guides.

I'd say it'll be very hard and there are better ways to spend your time, but if you really want to, I'm sure you can do it.

I felt the same way, until I forgot about it a few hours after the last time it was posted

Lol die on different hill my dude. Everyone knows this shit already.

Why try say staking is better odds then when its clearly not.

Honestly so funny every time he does it.

Simple yet effective

This mode has brought me more rage than my entire Runescape experience... I've now learnt to always bring knives when fighting in multi-combat areas...  
---
You touch my monsters, I attack every monster in the vicinity...
---
Google Jad Simulator and practice for a bit, it uses 2011 Jad model but the animations are the exact same as OS (Legs up and held in air = magic, stomp = range)
---
And 1 hour challenges
---
? XD pid is 50/50 and style switching probs gives like 1% odds if the other person isnt doing it, which gets taxed anyway
---
I don't view it as trolling. Most people genuinely don't understand there is a difference between having a 50/50 chance to win a stake vs 50/50 odds to profit over time. Which probably explains why so many people do buy gold to stake then say *staking isn't 50/50!* when they get cleaned even though they're right where the maths says they should be.
---
This would be a bots dream, coding a bot would be so simple!

I've been loving Hosidius and the nearby Forthos dungeon. Never spent any time in Zeah really til twisted league.

No, it's not, I was disappointed
---
player with pid = game counts that he died first
---
Lol dude most people think that the more times you loose the more chance of winning you have.
---
Ill have to get some pics in, soon hopefully. Dropped it off with a buddy tonight since he freaked when i found it and wanted to go through it. Good luck deciphering our chicken scratch writing if i do though haha
---
Yeah, that's what I was thinking with having it sink bandos
---
Hahaha true Cx
---
Im making a defence pure atm, but I see people mentioning fire cape as BiS for an only defence account.  
---
My question is how do you completel fight cave as a defence pure? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Do you stab it with the poison knife and let it bleedout over 50 hours or?
---
I really wonder how many people are going to quit playing the main game because they‚Äôve gotten so used to endless endurance/5xp??? Nah jk nobody quits osrs.
---
Bandits
---
they are both attacking same tick but their hitsplats have similar difference than the poison hitsplats had
---
they both died to poison same tick but because this obnoxious guy had pid, game saw that he died first and gave win to other player
---
They told me they had some dank Ranarr Weed.
---
gzz
---
guy has no talent and is annoying as fuck. U gotta be a 10 yr old edgelord with down syndrome to think hes funny

Everyone is a region-locked Ironman. XP rates are 5x faster. Accomplishing certain goals unlocks fun "perks" that totally change the core gameplay. E.g. get 3x resources from all harvesting skills, infinite run energy, faster attack speed, etc. It's mostly for fun and not super competitive or even team-based at all.
---
justic main use is rune drags, and tanky gear might hold demand if jagex stops designing raids around ignoring defence bonuses and involving zero sources of rng chip damage
---
Yip. Peoples belief in fallacy's and lack of understanding is precisely why the house always leaves well fed.
---
DAE RC BAD LUL
---
Step 1: acquire botfarm
---
Ofcourse the server would have its own economy if thats what you're saying and I see it could potentialy hurt the game in a way but one could only dream
---
Probably will not happen but it would be cool for lots of players, hardcore fans will always be gatekeeping but I think a decent amount of people would be down
---
Nope. Still 50/50. Either it happens or it doesn't.
---
You're joking right? Herblore is piss easy thanks to farming contracts. If I used all my banked herbs I'd almost have herblore be as high as my highest combat stat.
---
They should add Thieving guild with Ardy knights tied up on chairs.
---
the automatic prayer bonus was cool when i killed chickens for feathers and passively gained 20 levels... but now that i'm 46 prayer, looking to start raising my herblore for prayer pots, now I kinda regret it. I wish I chose endurance or accumulator. 
---
But i feel like after a time, the endurance wouldn't be noticeable. running seems faster cause the default is walking... but if you run everywhere, it starts to feel slow because there's no faster setting.
---
When is the last dayagain?
---
What  do you think about rebalancing or giving new niches to classic weapons  up to rune? Currently only a few types of weapons are objectively worth  using. Changes could include:
---
* Increasing maces speed by 1 tick to be on par with the scimitars.
---
* Switching  warhammers requirements from attack to strength, so they can become low  level KO weapons and give strength pures a chance in F2P PvP.
---
* Adding ranged strength bonus to longbows.
---
Same issue here
---
see you on the front page tomorrow after you make the edit.
---
Who was it that decided Ironmen should have access to Bounty Crates and be able to earn high level resources from them?  
---
Nightmare Zone's resources can be obtained elsewhere without any level requirements, doesn't require interaction with other players, and yet that still had to be polled.
---
Finally dude holy shit
---
took someone in my cc up to 86 thieving, so your rng isn‚Äôt bad at all yet
---
Oh of course! You're right. PID stayed the same after all.
---
Thank you. I really appreciate this.
---
fire runes are barely more expensive than pure essence lol
---
Nice
---
Do you think it's a problem that Ironmen are able to earn incredibly high amounts of GP using Bounty Hunter? It seems to go against the idea of preventing them from upgrading emblems if they can just spend the points from those kills on alchables anyway.
---
and then you find out they're iron and you took their visafe
---
You god damn worthless junk of crap. You just got banned from /v/ and you start your little shit posting here? BIG MISTAKE KIDDO A VERY COSTLY MEGA BIG MISKTAKE
---
It's possible, but insanely difficult now.
---
On release it was simple to do fight caves, as the serpentine helmet envenomed monsters just for attacking you. 
---
Now you have to venom them with a poisoned bone dagger which is insaaanely inaccurate at 1 attack, and knowledge of the waves and prayer flicking so that you can flinch monsters properly is extremely important. 
---
So yes, possible, but a lot more difficult than it used to be.
---
Yeah it's special worlds like dmm
---
I would really really rather play 100 games of wt than 20 games of tithe.
---
Do you have any way to see how many has something in the col log?
---
Could be pretty cool to see a list of top 20 most rare and most Common things in the log
---
This shit is retarded as fuck
---
I respect the grind more than the GP stack. Such a nice feeling though to have that diary unlocked
---
- If it's going to require 40 defence, it should have the stats of rune. Also, the cost should be higher too.
---
- The prayer bonus should be +5 helm, +9 body, +7 legs.
---
- No to the attack/strength bonus or set effect.
---
- The full set should cost maybe 250k gp from NPC. Since rune is 10x the price of addy roughly.
---
It took an unbelievable amount of time though yeah?
---
Corrupted gauntlet was changed since release, so that as long as you know what you're doing in both the prep and boss fight, you should be fine.
---
I'm sure there are guides already out there, but I'd recommend going for T2 armour and T3 Staff and Bow. Melee is technically stronger but is slightly more annoying to use.
---
It's what happens when you're about to be kicked out from the 6 hour login timer
---
I think i've messed up on twisted league, I chose Lovakengj for my 20% favour instead of Pisc. 
---
How do I get planks for early Pisc favour? I have like 10k gp :|
---
Dropr ate is the same, just easier to get and do clues
---
With a statement like this you might need some arguments to back it up. This is just a crap post
---
Remove skull tricking from the game.
---
 https://imgur.com/yJ5RXv4
---
Majority of the player base is for this idea
---
Ok yeah Im using mac. ty
---
are the chosen slayer tasks not way too crowded?
---
I can't really see any benefit to this, it would be  more noisy and more physical effort than clicking a mouse and you'll still have to empty the pouches every few moments anyway so it's hardly afk.
---
Would honestly recommend doing some pyramid plunder, it's enjoyable, has good reward potential and has xp rates of 150k+/hour
---
Take this here upvote son, hold onto it until you have 5000. Use it wisely.
---
They answered a very similar question on the 6th of this month (52 minutes in):
---
&gt; In the same way that we can report nasty/toxic/rule-breaking players, could we report positive engagements?
---
&gt; Yeah we could but would need to have absolutely no game-benefit or useable value since it would be unrestricted. It works for single-player games when players are good VS bad but doesn't quite fit our game. --- Husky: In some games like MOBAs where you might not get to chat, it works well and has benefits whereas communication isn't really an issue in our game.
---
Why is the value of my loot displayed incorrectly when i log into runelite on the website? In the game client it showed as worth over 9mil at 140 kills, then it was reset, but i just added it manually and it works out to be around \~10.2m in loot (156kc), however the website tracker says this is only 3895k. 
---
The loot is shown correctly, however the value of the loot is far off. What's up with that?
---
Cmon man.. A Friend.. legendary outlaw?
---
How is that niche pk that is exatly what pk is do you think pk is 10 guys running on one. Well i quess you do it since you dont have the skills to kill any one 1v1. Pls explain to me what pvp is then
---
You have talked about locking Zulrah behind further requirements before, but in the last few QnAs it‚Äôs been complete radio silence on the topic. Is it possible for you guys to update us on this? Is it going to happen or not?

Good luck mate. Seriously. Hope all goes well.

You have my upvote friend, hope your dad is able to get back into his account, also if you are living in HK then congratulations &gt;.&gt;

Play a Uim restricted to a zone without using your right hand and only eat vegetables as your uim is a vegetarian.

Can you in any way adress the ongoing rumours, concerning serious bug abuse?

Yeh I was worried that everyone will just think this hence why I said we have account start address proof along with photo identification

The account start address and address he lives in now is same name

Same thing here... And no response from Jagex. 11$ btw.

Was the issue resolved?
---
Since I started osrs 4 months ago this has been the case. Mith darts/arrows/(I think) knives are cheaper than steel.
---
There's no warning when you drop the eternal teleport crystal despite it being untradeable, and created from an item worth about 3m. Can this be fixed?
---
i don't think so most likely gonna be cosmetic item
---
It sucks how reddit is the only form of customer service for a game as big as rs :/
---
Calling someone a bigot because they said something about a game just shows you‚Äôre taking this wayyyy to seriously bud.
---
Try asking on discord support. This isn't Runelite support.
---
Thank you so much :‚Äô(

I never thought anyone would read this let alone help us

Means the world to him and therefore to me

Thank you again acorn!

Literally.
---
Directly replying to someone who is already offering assistance only runs the risk of discouraging them to do the same in the future.
---
The problem you want solved is much bigger than a single employee offering assistance
---
They will be cosmetic and offer no stats. Looking to get some form of reward clarification newspost out as soon as possible.

Didn't even need 5K upvotes :o

sadly I think your best bet is to try to equip everything while questing and check wiki for details on how to keep said items. most of the pure cosmetic is from clue scrolls or from minigames.

This illness sounds a bit like some form of early dementia from the vague description.

If it is that sucks but spend time with him now while he still has most memories intact.
---
Have a relative with it and it started slowly from her 50s and shes nearly 90 now and me a grandchild she took care of for many years, she has no clue who the hell i am now because she remembers me as a 5year old.
---
Sorry I'm a noob. What's bridding?
---
I get that, but I meant because the dude above comment "an jmod," meaning he would've had to be reading "jmod" as a sound starting with a vowel, if he meant to type it that way.
---
Realistically, it was probably just a grammar error/not native English speaker.
---
So is it all fixed now?
---
I meant because the dude above comment "an jmod," meaning he would've had to be reading "jmod" as a sound starting with a vowel, if he meant to type it that way.
---
to be fair, lance isnt really mandatory anywhere, and has less impact than at least 10 other items
---
Thanks!
---
You probably run around with a ddefender and trimmed d boots I bet lmao
---
You answered security questions? Or previous answers? Which would be an automated service. Not customer service, people have issues with no human interaction, even when it is signed by a jmod its still the same copy/paste messages. 
---
And the 'support'ALWAYS redirects you to the support site which is useless for most people.
---
Planky the plank
---
Ok boomer
---
He was diagnosed with something else actually

I hope he doesn‚Äôt also get dementia too it would be devastating 
---
I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your relative, I hope things are well with you
---
Items are a bit too strong but people in the comments don't seem to realize that balance can be applied while the idea of upgraded prayer armour and a prayer cape can remain.
---
Can we get more impling spawns for Twisted League? Or can you add lockpick in some shop in Zeah?
---
If not, can you move every steal artefact task to elite and master tier?
---
It's almost impossible to get your hands on lockpick since there is only 1 place to camp implings and competition for them is huge...
---
Also why doesn't impling catches provide 5x xp?
---
gz mate
---
Just saying, as nice as it is that you're helping these people. Reddit should not be your customer service hotline. It's starting as jokes "only 500 upvotes for a jmod reply!" But soon this will need to be addressed. OSRS is the most community centered game I've ever seen. Except when it comes to account security and recovery. Makes me scared for the future of old school if I'm honest
---
This support ticket is getting some heat, but not quite there yet.
---
np
---
What? That is less help than a HCIM
---
yeah, you use a middleman service like Alex's or Assassin's, and you normally pay a fee. 
---
normally 20 percent of the name price if you're selling it, but since you're just transferring it through accounts, I don't know how much he'd charge.
---
i can link you the server if you add me on discord at @izzy#0001
---
It‚Äôs when you use multiple types of combat styles during the same fight.
---
Typically mage and range with a melee spec wep. 
---
Mage normally being ancients.

Will  you please fix the issues some of us are having opening the client? There was a sticky post about it!!! A mod basically said just spam open the client until you get lucky?!
---
For those who don't know quite a few of us are getting the error, "There was an error loading the game configuration from the website.", whenever we try to open the client. It's been going on for the past 2 days now!
---
Don‚Äôt post the name anywhere, have bonds on both accounts and be quick. As long as the name isn‚Äôt something super sought after you should be fine.
---
I assume because the next comment says *jmod that he originally typed something else.
---
Mod Ash isn't in customer support, can people seriously fucking stop bothering him with shit he can do nothing about? He responds to several messages per day that people sends him about their locked or hacked accounts and he always says that he can't do anything about it cause it's not his area.
---
Farming says hi.
---
To be fair he did rank it as bottom of the barrel which would imply almost everything else is better. But also he said ‚Äúcontent creation‚Äù. So as far as osrs ‚Äúcontent‚Äù as a whole goes then yeah, it sucks big aqp in comparison.
---
Temple spiders can lick my grunt
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Bro 60% of the game is poorly designed. There are so many fundamental aspects of the game that are "bad game design" but the metas and identity of the game have formed around those bad designs, and it's ridiculously unlikely that they're going to just up and change any of them if you argument is just "it's bad game design and I don't like it," without even presenting any alternative or reasons for your opinion
---
slayer helm with no stats tho
---
Scumbag Op
---
I got mine on 5th attempt. Got like 40 dragon darts in bp for jad and out dps'd healers. You can do it!
---
As someone that is currently doing firecape with mobile on my 4th attempt all 3 attempts to jad. You dont get fucked by rangers even with 70 def  as long as you focus them first. They die super quick with 75 range
---
and?
---
I like it, do you want to continue with 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs?
---
amen
---
That's my bad. I forgot there were two versions of that shield (despite using one myself). I coded it to only work with the charged one. We'll fix that in the upcoming weeks!
---
You asked for a summary. There's a summary. If you can't put in 2 minutes of effort to read a post, why bitch about the shortened version?
---
I like 8 brews, 8 super restores 3 range pots and 9 prayer pots and i have extra super restores left over
---
Huh, didn't even know that Falador had a [king](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/King_Vallance).  TIL.
---
The appreciation bar needs to be at least 30%.
---
I do jad about once a month for slayer and I always bring a few mantas for the ranger rounds haha, guess whatever works for you. Gl with jad my dude
---
Another league task completed. Let me collect the task real quick. Wow only 10 points.

Your gonna have to post a fake sob story man there‚Äôs not really much of an option here
---
Your daughter she come to my house and kick my dog

Yes sir!

I would definitely recommend using sharks or manta Ray's instead of Sara brews. You're gonna waste a ton of restores that way.
---
Forget clan wars exists?
---
Seagull gang in Port Sarim boi

You're gonna need batter Reddit post than that

How do you work that out

Twisted horn will have no stats not the slayer helm.

Congratulations! The likelihood of going this dry is around 0.06%. It is super scary to think that while the number seems tiny, at the time i'm writing this there are 83,557 people with 95 slayer, and if they all went for the claw, there would be around __50__ people who will go as dry, or even dryer.
---
And i was salty when i got my claw at 1.6k kc...

Why does Charlie the Tramp (when on Treasure Trails) sometimes suggest giving him an item which the player does not have the correct level to gather or craft? I have run into a few instances of this happening throughout my playing time in the last couple months and it is a major pain in the butt. If this IS intended behavior, why is it? If it is NOT intended behavior, when can it be fixed?

Is it possible to split TL relic unlock points from total points?  It's extremely  annoying how getting a lucky pet or drop is a significant headstart to your league.  You should still be able to get the points for overall, but unlocking a tier 5 relic 500 pts sooner is a huge slap in the face to people who don't get lucky on a pet or a golden tench.
---
If you aren‚Äôt already, I would bring dbolts (e) and a rcb to use after using your gmaul specs. People in that cb bracket usually don‚Äôt have enough QP to have started dragon slayer ==&gt; can‚Äôt drink antifires ==&gt; dbolt specs will get you lots of kills. 
---
Also, I think it‚Äôs really important/beneficial to know ***why*** you‚Äòre dying instead of focusing on the fact that you‚Äôre dying at all. Get screen recording software and record/clip each fight when you die so you can go back and watch. Seriously, this was something that helped me the most that isn‚Äôt mentioned enough. 
---
Honorable mentions would be learning about PID, the tick system, and what other builds‚Äô max hits are. Obby maulers wreck people at this cb, so make sure you aren‚Äôt keeping your hp too-too low.

I remember back when I was 8, all the "cool" players use to hang out in the middle of Varrock next to Zaff's store. I would ask for money and they would give me 1K gp. I remember once some dude game me full black armour with mithril scimi and that made my day.

There's no good way to know what rank you truly are. There could be hundreds of people ahead of you who haven't claimed their points yet.

Around 40cb or so I convinced my parents to buy me membership. My cousin had gotten it the week before and had bragged about his eye patch and bronze spear. As soon as I got membership I farmed the lumbridge goblins to get my own bronze spear. After killing a few I got it and proudly strutted all the way to Varrock to show it off in the town square where all the high levels would stand around in their 1bil blue P hats, santa hats and Hween masks. Those were the good ol days.
---
I don‚Äôt think so because if you hit it  with a different account irons can‚Äôt get the loot as far as I know
---
I agree, but for learners I would still prop the defence personally.
---
While I'd agree with the sentiment, the fact that clans can lock down rev caves and use scout bots almost anywhere in the while without consequences, I'm against any new content that just further benefits scouting clans.

I'm 99 farming and still no pet. What did you buy?

Being naive in a game full of other kids who were just trying shit and guessing until we got better was amazing!

It‚Äôs pretty game changing for UIM. It would probably save them anywhere from 20-30 hours on grinds for spices. If not more time.
---
Most of these issues that get massively upvoted on Reddit are either people that are bullshitting and just want Jagex to respond to them, or people who cannot provide sufficient evidence that they own their account. Fairly rare cases all considered
---
A med/piety still beats those pretty easy if you build it right. I did low hp methods when I built my med and was like 85hp 86str or something like that and I wrecked voiders even low level voiders with rig.
---
Meds have taken over every single bracket above like 85cb
---
Not really, rangers are like 1/20 in leagues; just check all the other post pulling them.
---
Ill look into that thanks
---
The cape needs a nerf but it'd be cool if they made the challenge as hard as or harder than fight caves if they want the cape to be a defensive version of the fire cape.
---
Bully his little brother. Haha
---
 How many per hr you think?!
---
The exponential half is 92, correct me if im wrong
---
Racks and Tob changes both passed?
---
I'll check them out, I love his pking videos.
---
Spice Racks passed, the poll results show the people qho skipped, but the final percentage is based off the results without the Skips. Spice Racks passed with 81.2%
---
I know what you mean, but it‚Äôs still early enough that you could start now and end up in the 1% which I believe is dragon tier.
---
Black armor! Yes! It looked the absolute best!
---
Air traffic controller at Heathrow
---
I‚Äôve played private servers where you could ride sleds anywhere. All the animations already exist. Just a matter of allowing it outside that quest area. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt really make sense without snow but kinda fun. 
---
Maybe they can be a seasonal thing when jagex turns all the grass to snow for christmas.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure this is against ToS
---
Thanks! Same boat for me haha
---
I just wanted to do hard diaries =(
---
Just easy clues. Yeah they say 1/128 for man/woman and sand crabs . My runelite says iv killed 167 sand crabs and 203 man/woman.
---
Poor guys. I bet they don‚Äôt even enjoy the game because they depend on it for money. How do they afford computers though?
---
Yeah
---
Everybody loves the old Jmods.  
---
Archie , MatK, kieren, Ronan, Ash  
---
My Fav was Matk and Ronan, i love them and i miss them ( NO HOMO )
---
No, he can‚Äôt, separate caves.
---
are you clicking the plant to water? using the watering can on the plant is much faster as you cancel the planting animation. and then you can start the next plant once water appears on the soil
---
but if you count to 50. and then to 50 again. you understand?
---
I also had a med at that combat bracket for awhile before I maxed it.
---
I would argue the lower Hp caused me to get ramboed out a bit more then I liked. I would say it competes but I wouldn‚Äôt say it wins the majority. I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs more of a 45-55 fight.
---
The wiki says so.
---
According to the 2nd Law of thermodynamics getting two 50/50-drops in the same roll equals 100% chance of getting it once getting it. Anything else you require assistance with? Don't worry, im not a sick fuck like rest of these scammers.
---
I do the opposite, end up googling non related things and typing osrs at the end out of habit
---
Posts about it don't stay up very long - I'm afraid no one knows the full details. 
---
If there's an urgent situation, I think the players deserve to know
---
No this has been an ongoing issue for years now
---
Is their costumer service a department that like helps you pick out costumes?
---
This is a great idea, I didn't even think of this
---
What are you referring too lol
---
Settled has pushed the game to its limits over and over again during his series. He has manipulated obscure mechanics, completed grinds that any sane person would consider impossible, and learned every nook and cranny of Morytania. I will always consider Zezima to be the greatest player in the context of his time, but Settled is an amazing player and he's far more than just someone making videos. 
---
I'd have to say that if we're ignoring the context of the time they played in, then Woox is the single greatest player though.
---
On your own strength or paid for it? Heard it was pretty expensive!
---
They would have to do some expansions though. Many skills are VERY tedious in morytania (e.g. only one hunter training area will for sure always be full), especially at low levels. Zeah worked so well because it has so many decent training spots, including barb fishing, the library, wintertodt, the catacombs, etc. 
---
I could see them adding new training areas for it though to balance out the lack of training methods for many skills
---
lmfao, enjoying your 1/2 prayer drain
---
*oh wait...*
---
pkers wanted prayer reordering because having the boost prayers in different places for different account types is shit
---
Jagex don't run this sub

---
what would happen to be the name of your first pet if you had one?
---
Its also good for stuff like Leagues where you have to play on a more limited account or future proofing in general, like what if they release new prayers that you want to use instead, then you'll have to relearn your muscle memory.
---
You did the maths so I don't have to. Thanks.
---
Literally unplayable
---
How long did you hang out in the general store for the random to spawn
---
Why? These people are making a living and putting food on their tables the only way they know how... this is the one time I think it‚Äôs okay, fuck our game these people are impoverished
---
It was in their most recent Q&amp;A, Hardcore Harvester specifically would've been really overpowered if it were toggleable.
---
If Cerb is easier, primordial boots go down, and that's essentially the only reason the boss is worth killing except for the pet. Everything you mentioned can be avoided if you just practice the boss a bit. The ghosts also provide an inoperable prayer potion sink and give the spectral spirit shield value.
---
While do people screenshot rather than link the article?

I'll level with you, I haven't even played TL. I started playing osrs again yesterday but have been following the memes for years üòÇ

Killing hill giants. I found out that rune 2h's hit so slow you can steal people's kills between attacks. Was a lot of fun seeing how confused people would get.
---
Is there a way to document a backlog of questions? So many of these Q&amp;As become echo Chambers of the same questions because they get asked once, you say "Great idea!" then they're never mentioned again. It'd be helpful to know questions are even remembered at all.

If you only caught 7 since release, you are doing something wrong.
---
Yeah, that makes sense.
---
Unfortunate that you needed to put that disclaimer in lol, if only people read parent comments and didn't forget them after every two comments.
---
Account sharing used to be against ToS, but Jagex made it "legal" now. I forget when but it's no longer against ToS.
---
Has to be over 30% on the bar
---
All accounts started fresh with OSRS
---
Strategy:
---
1) don't get hit
---
2) kill the enemy
---
Hey, no offense, but none of this has anything to do with BIS. Maxes would just be a crush weapon for niche uses, warhammers would give pures a reasonable 1h weapon, etc. it gives more leeway for contextual BIS depending on the scenario. That‚Äôs not a bad thing at all.
---
It works!!!!! THANK YOU! &lt;3
---
Taking into account the uniques and crystal shards, the average Corrupted Gauntlet kill is over 500k. Money isn't the issue. I'll agree it's tedious though.

Getting the 20-30 mill to get your POH to that point is not that small of an effort for probably the majority of the playerbase.

In the recent poll both questions 12 and 13 regarding spices passed. Since both passed, instead of taking the one that has more votes as stated in the poll, can you please poll the community on which one we would prefer be implemented?

Adult life sucks.

Yea which is more of a selfish no then anything. Sort of like the dude who said he quit playing osrs because of Twisted League... Does he not know it doesnt effect him if he doesnt want it to?

It could be another means of escaping Morytania or a camp for the Myreque.  It makes sense to hide from monsters that are weak to sunlight in the desert

Bowstrings, blast furnace, masterfarmers, gambling bots etc is the kind of bots you'll see a massive increase in during prime. No startup cost, low requirements and scalable. Prime member bots are getting banned much more frequently than regular membership so you dont see them in higher level activities.

Your char will start fresh but the account you created in 2006 can be used to access OSRS. The "RS3" Char will remain when logging into the rs3 client

Tbh there should be a pet for every skill. Doesn't matter if it's "buyable" or not.

I wish I had the money from 3k kills. I did 200 kc and got tired of it. How do you manage?

Bounty hunter bots are not using prime, Mod Weath confirmed this already.

You character when logged out sat there in a tent untill you logged back in

Wow. Actually a mistake since i couldnt fit the word shield in. I Guess i didnt notice when overlooking
---
Nice.
---
Math went wrong here somewhere, if their giving rates of 2 mill an hour it should be $40 a week, not a month.
---
So like, realistically. Twisted league is meant for players with experience right? Being locked to those areas only, I imagine requires a lot of game knowledge. Am I right or wrong? I'm interested in RS leagues because I come from Path of Exile and I'm always curious how other games do it you know?
---
Do yourself a favour and never gamble.
---
Nope, definitely should of gotten denied. You need to go relearn Pvp sorry
---
Ok so im pretty sure all the non-appstore apps dont have new osx support . Either use time machine to restore old osx or wait until runelite or osb has support for it. Not sure how to revert osx to the older version u might wanna youtube that.
---
Gz! Got mine at 2kc a few days ago and was absolutely stoked
---
I don't. Around 2500kc I took a 9 month break because I got burned out of it (also college too).
---
Equally, having rooms like the thieving room in a pvm setting isn't good game design.
---
I will agree with that. However, the drops are a lot more exciting for money snake. I am only at around 800 kc using tbow.
---
Main clue farming technique?
---
The grind how it is right now is burning out already. Personally I'm more of a console gamer and whenever I want to play something else like OSRS, Its such a chore to do all these tedious task over and over again just to have fun with endgame content which I will never reach at the pace im going. Like in 3 hours in lets say COD I can get a gold weapon skin, in 3 hours in OSRS I have 32 fishing for example.
---
I like RuneScape and everything around it but the grind is just tedious and unhealthy so a x10 server would be great for people like me.
---
Timestamp? I'm about halfway through now and they haven't mentioned it.

Not like a dream job for me or anything but I am basically building maintenance and sit for 70% of my shift and play.

I think it‚Äôs the Russian ‚Äòe‚Äô
---
Because the website locks you out if you don't have an account. Here's an image of the article: https://i.imgur.com/6THk3XL.jpg https://i.imgur.com/n5e2Qs2.jpg
---
You don‚Äôt have any argument other than ‚ÄúI feel strongly.‚Äù 
---
1. It‚Äôs not really ‚Äúrebalancing.‚Äù Just updating other weapons so they‚Äôre possibly more useable for other account types. Not sure why you need to clarify bronze-rune...of course that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre talking about...
---
2. If it‚Äôs not a big deal and wouldn‚Äôt matter (apparently everyone does waterfall quest? What about f2p...?), then why do you feel so strongly?
---
Certain boss monsters in quests have weaknesses that could make crush useful. Mid-game stuff that can be interesting to have to choose/decide.
---
3. Maces have a prayer bonus, so there are other items to consider here. Dragon mace/shimmy also have different quest requirements, so I think there is enough variance where someone might use one over the other due to something like that. And if not, who cares? Not like it has a negative repercussion.
---
4. No amount of range damage bonus would matter for a longbow? You serious? What about like...+800 bonus? Please understand that there IS a point where a more accurate, harder hitting bow would be useful, even if it‚Äôs niche. You claim that it would have to be marginal, but the dude didn‚Äôt say that; it can be a significant bonus!
---
5. Why do you care if str pures get a buff? Is that a bad thing? Turning dead content into a niche buff for certain accounts? Does that even affect you whatsoever?
---
How do you guys do 20 at a time? This always results in me losing a few because my character gets stuck watering for way longer than he should. It's quite infuriating at times to be honest, but I have been doing four runs of 17 and two of 16 in the meantime which lets me submit 100 at a time.
---
There are seperate games. Your old account is on the old game. Everyone starts fresh on osrs

Honestly anything they could come up with would just hurt players without RL more. Oh, this task could be any of 3 places to dig? Guess I'll have to hope I go to the right one first! This would just make clues more monotonous and RL would still show all available options. This would literally only be a negative all around. If a person can solve it, a machine can be coded to solve it as well.
---
Yes definitely use a blowpipe (rune darts if possible, addy are fine also) It helped a ton when i was just getting into vorkath.
---
There's little niche things you can do to make kills go by a lot easier and more chill. One thing i did at the start was bringing a slayer staff so you don't have to go into your mage book and cast the spell on the spawn. Another being using CTRL to run. Instead of paying attention to if your run is on/off, try using CTRL to dodge fireballs and you won't have to panic trying to turn your run off during the acid phase.

Are you constantly swapping between your alts with different prayer locations? Because I'd love to see you consistently switch between the two accounts with 0 failure with 0 warmup in a fight. Weird elitist dude lmfao
---
What a trash community.
---
BARBARA WHERE ARE MY PANTS
---
Wait the equip from bank ones passed? Ffs I voted no on those but yes to reorder prayers
---
pmod ain‚Äôt gonna save you LOL
---
Yeah, 
---
Well the meta is probably to kill a lot of shamans on the way to 85slay for whip 
---
 dwh is very necessary to run raids 1 semi efficiently. 
---
If that‚Äôs in your plan for TL
---
currently undetectable. one of the methods they mentioned for catching left  click blackjack (or pray reordering for example) is to screenshot your client screen- it would not be difficult to build some sort of image recognition system to distinguish between what a normal spellbook/blackjacking menu looks like and one with reordered prayers/left click options.
---
Nope. Sounds like you want the benefit of different pvp brackets without learning where to click though. Unlucky!
---
Reporting people for that lmao
---
Calm your proverbial man tits. I don't know why this failed the poll but somehow I doubt this failed poll was a result of some grand conspiracy against pkers. Please stop trying to play your victim card whenever things don't go your way.
---
Is it really much of an advantage? Like you said people can use old muscle memory to put them where they're used to it's not like it's easier it's just muscle memory
---
Okay, looking at the top down I realize it is the same amount of movement to do it your way or my way.
---
I thought I was the only one. I‚Äôm obsessed with TL YouTube content. I don‚Äôt even play myself anymore. Here‚Äôs a list of series I have watched or am currently watching;

---
Oof what a huge inconvenience that you can‚Äôt withdraw 3.
---
Look man like I get what you‚Äôre saying but also you‚Äôre kinda being a cunt about it.
---
Can you provide a proper explanation as to why skull tricking is not reportable as scamming? It seems to have a lot of the features of scamming and I'm not sure why it is considered acceptable in the game.
---
You‚Äôre just unlucky
---
That account was in the hands of hax unit in 2014-2015, Quint &amp; yb have screenshots on their reddit accs of them logged into it, so take anyone claiming to be durial321 with a grain of salt.
---
But why force people to have 20 useless prayers surrounding the three they intend to use?
---
This is not just pvp but really anything that requires fairly accurate and timely prayer switches, or even just qol.
---
The fact this doesn't pass after timely had to remove the feature is simple going to drive players to shady clients.
---
The 0 is from the arguments made against endurance
---
1. Most skills are easier to train in members areas, but you can get the early levels out of the way in f2p. For example, mining, woodcutting, and fire making are pretty much the same until level 50. 
---
2. You can see equipment stats by clicking on the equipment tab and clicking the ‚Äúview equipment stats‚Äù button at the bottom left. If you don‚Äôt own/can‚Äôt wear the equipment, you can look up the stats on the wiki or use a third party client. 
---
3. You can reset aggro by running away until the enemy is no longer rendered then running back. You can also go up stairs or a ladder if there is one nearby.
---
tEaRs Of gUtHiX
---
Durial was Jagex population control, stay woke
---
something something slippery slope ezscape MTX
---
it makes no sense that we can use hastas though, why is that done but not any Dragon weapons?
---
the meta is msb/rune scim until 85 slayer and a whip or maybe you get lucky and get a hasta or a sword
---
Looks good! Keep it up.
---
For real, selling that would probably break the osrs economy for a few weeks.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be difficult to build.
---
It would be extremely difficult to perfect.
---
Before implementing you would have to trial run it and get close to 99.9% accuracy in running it.
---
Also with how many prayers there are. you‚Äôre running a lot of variables to read. 
---
But who knows. I don‚Äôt expect them to be able to detect it for atleast a year.
---
The community would rather chop off their clicker finger before allowing an update to pass that doesn't benefit them directly.
---
For people playing a pure and a main it‚Äôs an advantage because they don‚Äôt have to think about what account they‚Äôre on, and for those that used it closer to when CoX was released and didn‚Äôt want to learn the new positions gave themselves an advantage. 
---
Nowadays it‚Äôs more like avoiding a disadvantage. They spent so long cheating that now they have to learn how to play properly and it will potentially put them at a disadvantage for a little bit.
---
WHERE'S MY SUPER SUIT?
---
Why does everything you type feel like a Donald Trump comment lmfao. And you just admitted that you don't switch between your alts constantly as well as don't even PK so you're really basing your entire argument on baseless conjecture that you came up to justify your no vote.
---
I know I am. I‚Äôm just happy and being smug about it because ezscape updates constantly pass and one failed.
---
"Fix your scuffed pures today"
---
gotta call an expert for each one
---
I am at work and full opened that.. oops
---
Yup,
---
I was just saying that the long term meta might include doing a lot of shamans once you‚Äôre range is high enough if you‚Äôre looking to get dwh for raids.
---
Jagex is a business. They want to grow and *expand* the playerbase, not make all the new players quit...their priority isn't rooting out and removing everything in the game that makes the experience for newer players less tedious because someone said it's too easy for them
---
I don't understand why the fuck there's such a big part of this community that wants all new players to suffer and have such a meaninglessly tedious/artificially difficult experience with this game.
---
It's a fucking video game. UI elements should be convenient to use.
---
But that‚Äôs the point of this tournament. It‚Äôs locked to a specific region and resources are limited. There‚Äôs a reason they made very few alternations to TL zeah compared to vanilla zeah.
---
40k/ hr at zmi. 
---
1 hr grind for permanent clue step
---
Agreed because the grind for obtaining a Rune scimitar through smithing is only a long term and unique grind for F2P ironmen. If the Rune scim drop for Cockroaches stay members only or have another rune weapon drop like a Rune mace I think it would be a great mult-area addition.
---
Almost everything gets 55-60+.. The 75% cutoff has kept a lot of bad shit out of the game. I'm very happy with 75%
---
Yep his answer works for that question. Just run away and run back
---
Only bc vh closed rip vh
---
Just because it‚Äôs this certain way doesn‚Äôt mean it needs to stay the same way.
---
I have the past 2-3 years of Q&amp;A in transcript/archive and am working to centralise them all into a spreadsheet to make searching and filtering easier. Hoping to get that done in the next few weekends so that they can be public start of 2020.
---
In terms of OSRS teams backlog being published, this was last spoken about 08 may (about half hour in):
---
&gt; Can you publish the working backlog?	
---
&gt; We'd like to! Don't see any harm in players seeing and knowing. Would also mean that players can see where some suggestion is and what progress happens. Think Ayiza was looking at making a public version of the Jira board so might have to check in with him and see where this got up to.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bmcduk/old_school_developer_qa_transcript_08052019/
---
It would be nice if each question/answer that is like a suggestion or 'can you make', if they are answered like "Yeah we can do that but at this stage we won't add it to the backlog" or "Yeah great idea it's going on the list to offer at QoL time."
---
&gt; anything that requires fairly accurate and timely prayer switches
---
I mean that's why I voted no. Accurate clicks are one of the few aspects of skill in this game (a garbage determinant of skill yes, but that's a different discussion). Making prayers easy to click reduces that by a bit.
---
Its worth logging into rs3 to see the tzhaar city. Beautiful place with my favorite soundtrack in all of gaming.
---
its useful for PVM anyway, especially for bosses where you have to change your attack style
---
Clearly don't watch or just a troll, dude is at the DA because people don't fight him, and the small amount of people that do ask him to risk like 5x more and he does it and still wins almost every time.
---
And how is having someone talk you through the inferno any different to watching a video or reading a guide? What a stupid comment.
---
Agreed, I maxed on mainscape and never felt as much joy during the entire time as I do playing TL. I think leagues are the Future of OSRS. Whether it's to attract a new audience or convert the old playerbase doesn't really matter to me.
---
then why are you bringing up muscle memory? Wouldnt it be worse to change your prayer orders around?
---
No overall. The PvP community updates have a smaller community why are they being held to the same expectations...
---
1/1m for those two spesific
---
And like 1/250k for two uniques of any type?
---
Same. I thought about it alot. All the other areas are small compared to zeah too. They would need to start making completely new areas to the map and have a new twisted league like every 2 years to make it work imo.
---
I'm not gonna respect a website that makes me login just to view their shitty article lol
---
Re read the thread and look what I typed.
---
Haha yeah my bad I just picked the colors of two of the tithe plants, I should have done blue and orange.
---
If you start tick manipulation e.g. making a teak stock with a knife, 2 ticks before the ore will reappear in the rock, you can mine the ore out the rock the tick after it reappears, rather than starting the 3 tick action the tick after it reappears, saving 2 ticks for every ore you mine which adds up
---
at first i was like this, wanted the dscim etc. i think its fun and fair now, grind for dragon sword or whip kind of makes it enjoyable and content restricted
---
Why? You might as well tell them Abraham Lincoln is George Washington. Utterly pointless and not really funny.

Just be careful when leaving the safe spot, you can get gangbanged pretty quick in there with multicombat.
---
I honestly really enjoy actually seeing other players. It's been so much fun, even doing things like hard clues where Sara wizards are crowded it's not that bad. I have seen nicer people on twisted league for the most part than on usual RuneScape... 
---
I rather it be busy, otherwise it'll feel like one of the many dead private servers with 200 players tops.
---
Yeah why don't they just add MTX already without a poll? Don't like it? Don't use it.
---
There are no comments being removed, you‚Äôre making this up in your head
---
My bad, I rushed through the post cause it was 3 in the morning..
---
True
---
Keeping hp as low as possible utility training mage and cannon training range.. I am leveling hp as slow as possible rn. I used brew restore trick in pk for additional hp.  And take a sara and restore everywhere I go especially if in the wildy for slayer or something
---
I don't like it either, but you have to make money to publish
---
This ones for "Kivip" or something close to that. Guy would hook me up with full mithril armour he hand forged any time I asked back in 03ish. You're a legend and I've never forgot
---
But how is skill expression reduced by setting up your prayers how you like them? By that logic they should lock your gear switchs to random locations in your inv, having them next to eachother is just to easy lets lock weapons to the top right and armor to the bottom left.
---
"been here for 4 hours"
---
"Hop then" 
---
Sounds like a claim to me.
---
got scammed buying dragon bones, guy put up the whole stack then took it down and replaced it with my desired amount in big bones... never went to fally park again
---
Gotta love the innocence of them cute noobs
---
Probably why it failed. 
---
Pk bad. Skilling and PvM good. Ect
---
Thanks for confirming :) another quick thing which would be great if you could check tomorrow or something please, I completed the task for getting an addy ore from blast mine which is hard task and should give 100 points but I‚Äôm pretty sure it only gave 10 points?
---
What about reordering eagle eye and rigour so you don't need to have different muscle memory for zerker versus a rigour pure?
---
You chose to limit yourself.
---
No xD i left my back door open and she randomly spawned in my room xD
---

---
I had been skilling agility and was something like lvl 30-40. Then I went mining and thought this following npc squirrel is annoying. Then I asked my high level friend how can I get it off
---
Am I right to assume that the points given from a slayer master for every 10th task are also given at the 20th and 30th (etc..) task instead of just at task number 10?
---
To add to what others have said, you can also teleport to your spawn point via a low level Arceuus spell if that's something that might help.

Oh heck! Gonna be a bad day for the doge!
---
The voting system was quite poor. A number of people expressed the "I'd vote for any of the other three over A", but their vote was split
---
high IQ logic right there
---
devs happy with the current state of bh? bots still farming it, players successfully dont want to play anymore
---
Im like 200k away, but I know the statistics so cant really kill myself when its not even 50/50 to get it at 99
---
You've got some high stats for just playing for a month. No life squad.
---
You miss the entire point I made, people who didn't participate in TL shouldn't be able to buy rewards if they didn't play it.
---
I personally don't mind walking. Being an Ironman for the first time and feeling helpless was very nostalgic to me. So taking my time and being casual for once is a nice change. 
---
In game when players ask me why I didn't choose endurance, I usually reply with "I'm rp, i like to walk naturally". People sometimes get very frustrated over that lol
---
Agreed there was a high percentage for skip, i still dont know what jagex can take from this lol
---
ooooh that number 6 is nice. get dwh now so you can use it later kind of thing.
---
different tasks requires different skills.  
---
Also we both know that's not how the prayer reorder was gonna be used.
---
It's as if the world was hit with a nuclear blast and left shadows
---
Wow this is hella disappointing ... I used to have my prayers reordered in RuneLite, and switching to mobile would always mess me up cause I didn‚Äôt know where to find prayers fast enough. It made Zulrah more difficult than it needed to be. 
---
 
---
Everyday we stray further into chaos
---
Every other dates uses UK time. Why would it use US time?
---
Which is why it didn‚Äôt pass. Any PvP content that doesn‚Äôt benefit non PvP rarely passes. Since this would help PKers kill others in the wild, it failed.
---
1m
---
2m I‚Äôll do hero‚Äôs too
---
You mean all the QoL updates? I‚Äôm talking about meaningful content man.
---
That would be excellent!
---
The irony of their comment though, saying "We'd like to!" as a way to centralize all the "We'd like to" answers but never actually did it xD
---
ty
---
Stay mad lmao
---
i dont have agility for it unfortunately
---
I'm definitely going to try it, everyone is an iron man and you're locked with the interesting skill buffs as well as the increased exp.
---
This is the only one I actually cared about passing üôÉ
---
I don't even PK, just god forbid I get to rearrange my character's abilities to a format I like
---
I've been watching pawn stars a bunch lately and now I see this and feel like my personal space is under attack.
---
I just drew it my dude
---
tried to give him the moustache but came out a bit black and smudged
---
I feel like this helps PvMers almost as much as it does PvPers. I mainly PvM and as a long time player I am used to the locations of eagle eye and mystic might. Therefore I would appreciate having Rigour and Augery swapped to those locations because that it what my muscle memory is used to. You don‚Äôt need to be a high risk PKer to use those prayers.
---
I thought osrs had all the jacked dudes at laptops tho
---
He's talking about RS3
---
If you needed to enter the warriors guild to get it, wouldn't that make it impossible to obtain on an obby mauler?
---
They are discounted from the vote entirely. Mathematically it's partway between a yes and a no, favoring slightly the side over 50%
---
Best I can offer is 47,500 and I‚Äôm taking a risk here.
---
I remember back in 2005 when I'd see 20+ kids in the park playing all kinds of sports, mine being basketball. But now the park is dead. Barely anyone goes outside anymore, everyone's indoors playing games on their iPad. Such a pity.
---
Yes. Also works with other dragons (matching color).
---
Why are you speaking for your entire clan? Do the individual members not have their own opinions and make their own votes?
---
Because if you don't claim them, then they wont register on your account and would go to waste once the league ended.
---
I don't actually understand the benefit of this. Is it for UIM or something? That just sounds less convenient then just keeping the shakers in your bank...
---
People sell their mains all the time when they get bored and come up needing cash in life.  People will absolutely pay for these stats.

WOW! look at this rule breaking advertising and clickbait!

Saw this on r/gaming from u/datzick, thought I'd share it with you guys too.

I think youre reading this wrong. Seems like dudes spite voteing no as pvm/skiller like haha fuck u pvpers i voted no! Haha
---
People assume with little to no evidence that someone has bought gold or and account on this sub and everyone piles and and upvotes it, then everyone else coming in the thread later reads that as the top comment and takes it to be the truth.  It‚Äôs one of the worst things about Reddit in general but this sub is especially bad about it.
---
Macroing major? My girlfriend‚Äôs arm movement just happens to be pixel accurate and extremely repetitious.
---
I didn‚Äôt even read your post, but I saw the title and gave you an upvote as my small gesture of support towards your goal because I know you needed it for any chance to here back from Jagex
---
Wow, thats some mad luck; jealous asf
---
Cabelas?
---
Love this pawn stars parody
---
Wow mods actually being helpful for once?what a time to be alive
---
that could be attributed to Jagex getting a better sense of what definitely wouldn't pass, and not including such questions into the poll altogether
---
Tbh im still surprised no one really quits over poll results it has to feel pretty bad to want an update you know is reasonable and fair and having it declined because of a certain threshold not met.
---
Not surprised
---
Oops sounds like DoA content
---
You‚Äôre complaint is asinine, clearly majority of players wanted it (non irons included).
---
that's a good way to get your entire shipment destroyed lol
---
def can‚Äôt tell that‚Äôs a Robin Hood hat :OOOO
---
And destroy the game's economy
---
lol 90+% of content polls pass.  The only big piece of content that didn‚Äôt get added was warding, which it‚Äôs obvious that a large contingency of the community does not want a new skill, resulting in all of them failing so far. 
---
Save me the dramatics of the conservative runescape audience killing the game.  Just because 1 specific update you wanted didn‚Äôt happen doesn‚Äôt mean the game is dying
---
You got me there bro
---
Reports to jmods hahahahah
---
That's why i'm jealous of those who got the phoenix, who knows if the next league will even be in Zeah
---
Why is this so upsetting to everyone? I guess cos you got used to it on Runelite. 
---
I voted yes, I had them set up for zulrah when they could be switched with runelite. I‚Äôve just got into pking recently too, maybe I‚Äôm not experienced enough to know just how helpful it is when pking. Is it that big a deal to click somewhere else?
---
Cried. GL
---
Somewhat offtopic, but I find it quite pleasing with so many skip votes on ToB questions (content that only a small part of players do) -- gives impression people actually are reading what's written, and not just mindlessly voting yes or no if they don't understand the meaning of the question
---
So it's a skirt sleeve?
---
Oh God what is that last face.  
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Balancing the tasks is the main point of their comment. Work on your reading comprehension and don‚Äôt get all emotional about your own point.
---
What's wrong with it's face
---
It cracks me up watching all the normies be ironmen for two months
---
This is literally what happens on 80% of slayer tasks, in the main game. Maybe this is a good lesson for all the normies.
---
That‚Äôs a massive cheesy potato to be able to fit a whole shark on it.
---
Stinky pitts
---
Even non-Twisted League, I felt so good when I traded in all the random heads I‚Äôd collected before I finally got around to doing Kourend stuff.
---
Yeah I get that, I was just pointing out that OP was being pedantic about the "every month" comment rather than the point of the message which was: "lol repost".
---
cowhide farming wiill never die in my heart üò•
---
There should have been a smithing task where you turn in shayzien armor supply boxes.
---
You can tell from miles away this is PvP QoL looking at the toxicity of the comment section.
---
Jesus this comment section is a war zone
---
Send me the info, i have always wanted to stake but never wanted to make an account for it. Lol
---
I chose to play a game where I'm self-sufficient, not wasting supplies not getting a drop killing a boss from full health just because someone tickled it a few minutes before.
---
&gt;but I have seen several PKing YouTubers post how much it helped them
---
And that's why I voted no. Fuck making it easier to clap my cheeks.
---
You little slut
---
Let the hate flow through you.
---
No i just ment where i had my prayers setup.
---
Why are you writing a guide when you‚Äôre so wrong on many points? The point of a guide is to do something correctly, and correctly goes hand in hand with efficient much of the time.
---
70 def is fine for vorkath; I got my first 1200 with 70 and the other 1200 with 75. I had 4-5 kill trips with blowpipe and 5-8 with crossbow. Having 99 would just mean I used less food, but I would not get any more loot since your invent fills up by the 7th kill, 8th if you‚Äôre lucky (or rather, unlucky with shit loot not worth picking up other than bones).
---
Combo food and brew - not worth it or necessary. Vorkath max hit is 30 with ranged and magic, so you can recoup 20 to 22 hp with mantas or sharks. You‚Äôre not being comboed out or being hit for 40+ unless you make really big mistakes, so you can forgo combo food. Even when you make mistakes like getting hit by the one shot fireball or stopping and getting hit by acid+rapid fire dragonfire, you will have enough time to eat several sharks if you get out of the danger zone quick enough. Otherwise, you just die, making combo food useless.
---
Finally, while I agree with not eating during normal attacks you can‚Äôt camp 30 hp or risk less, especially when using blowpipe. Bringing a Guthix rest is a must as it converts venom to poison and heals 5 hp, while acting as a one tick food, so you lose no DPS.

&gt;pvp updates
---
And that's the important difference: I vote yes for PvP content. I vote no for PK content. Notice how those two sentences are different. I am in favor of improving consentual combat between two players. I want them to have more fun. I am not in favor of one party having an easier time killing a second party that is only trying to escape.
---
and what about the rest of the poll?
---
I'm just one vote, but I personally dont see it being as necessary as people think, especially if you have used prayers for more than like 3 days. It's not needed IMO, I have no use for it and it feels cheat client.
---
Now, I'm not saying it's not useful perhaps to someone, but in my long experience and current playing, I don't see it being needed.
---
Nah... That was one of the core tenants of OSRS existing. We wanted to get away from P2W. Bonds were bad enough but at least they provided something in return: in-game membership. Straight allowing RWT is against everything OSRS used to stand for. Albeit I don't play anymore and most people playing now might not care just like they stopped caring about powercreep ruining pre-eoc.
---
But why? If we have a set amount of possible designs, we should look for a community favorite and having people simply vote their favorite makes every choice in the poll equal. Personally I think that Jagex' design should be equal to the other designs. Just let the community favorite win.
---
Your proposal would make the poll biased against Jagex' design, requiring as little as 25% votes to keep and as much as 75% to ditch. Technically your proposal could end with 26% not wanting to change the armor, but 100% of the people who did opting for C. In that case, A would still win - even though C was obviously more popular.
---
If all of them were equal, the vote could end up with 24.7%/24.7%/25.3%/24.7% and C would win, because that's what the community preferred.
---
Surely not though, since you could already re-arrange prayers via 3rd party clients?
---
Loot from all the bots doing zulrah over 1 weekend.
---
Huh? I‚Äôm pathetic cause I don‚Äôt want other human lives to end because I‚Äôm lucky enough to be born in Canada instead of Venezuela? I‚Äôm pathetic cause I value my *entertainment* less than a human life? The game we get to play for fun is their only escape from death. Think about that. Get some help
---
God I really hate this community sometimes.
---
ok dad
---
I knew what i was voting for
---
I might've misnamed the poll, I was talking about the one that was like last year as a result of Mobile OSRS.
---
Bingo, you cracked the code
---
This was an inside job by jagex. You telling me it just happened on 6/6/6 by coincidence?
---
Congratulations, BashStriker. You win the "most retarded post of the day"-award. You also win the "Daddy Jagex, let me lick your boots\~\~"-award.
---
Since I know you're confused, I'll spell it out for you: Licking boots is not a good thing. Wanting a government to ignore the rules and make the laws they want to make is not a good thing. People who support this need a lobotomy. Kindly request one from your doctor.

This. It was crazy how confident we were as a community about things like this.

Why do we even consider people who skip the question as part of the vote ? 
---
I feel that if you chose that option, you might be indifferent and/or not know enough about that content. I know for the ToB question , I skipped Bc I just don‚Äôt understand ToB enough. It should be between the yes and the no votes.
---
username checks out
---
Because it makes it easier to prayer switch for pking making it easier and less skillful and more people would start learning pking so the high end pkers vote no. You know the ones who also complain that pking is dying because no one knew wants to start trying it.

---
Yikes. Grow a pair kiddo.
---
Shame it took you 100 hits
---
I do see where you are coming from. I was very interested in TL when I first heard about it. Although, while having a high lvl main that I'm very much invested in, I was worried I wouldn't want to take a two month break from the Max grind to play an alternative game mode despite how interesting and fun it looked and how it seemingly had few rewards in which would benefit my main. As the release date got closer, I remembered my Max Rs3 account that still has members and I don't use much. So since the release of TL I've been happily continuously gaining sweet xp on my beloved main while also being able to enjoy TL on my alt and have an absolute blast. So imo the mode is solely for fun and gives me such a unique feeling that I haven't felt since starting OSRS. The benefit is also that if I manage to do well enough in the League, then I can purchase items with my relic points that are going to be trade-able in the real game which will surely net some profit. Although I can't be for certain, but I'd imagine the Twisted Horns will be a very desirable item for players who didn't participate in the League or don't have a head drop but have 1k slayer points. So in the very least, I'm hoping to grind hard enough to gain access to buying the horns, or any other expensive in-game item, so I can have that extra cash on my main, but most importantly, experience this fun grind for relics and do it with an amazing community.
---
wow really I totally thought someone killed a boss one billion times. 
---
thanks for elucidating the matter we were all lost without you
---
That's definitely a fair point and one I agree with.
---
Its literally impossible to do that though
---
I mean I didnt, so
---
Of course they've considered it. The idea for twisted league was most likely "how do we turn swampletics into something everyone can play" and from there they looked for areas more suited to the less sweaty of us (sorry settled)
---
you forgot fairy ring everywhere
---
Awesome to see! But did you really get *that* unlucky on pets, or did you enter the wrong droprate on it in the simulator? (1/4000, I assume you went with 1/5000).

---
Just do Vorkath or Zulrah, it's way more gp!!! /s
---
Come on people, variety is nice. Barrows may not be the best money maker, but it's certainly not the worst, and it's fun! Still to this day one of my favorite minigames/bosses/whatever you want to call it.
---
Barrows is pretty steady cash and I would estimate to be upwards of 1m/hr without barrows items. Your actual gp/hr from there will vary quite a bit because it depends on your luck with items. You could stay around 1m/hr getting 3 karils cbows in a row, but you could also bump it up to 2m+/hr by getting some ahrims robes.
---
As for gear - the best gear you can afford, really. You want to prioritize magic damage (not accuracy). A trident will get the job done, but fire surge with a tome of fire I imagine would wreck them at an added cost. Melee wise, same idea, best melee setup to quickly get tunnel KC. On that note, tunnel KC should be 2 skeletons 1 worm (i think? you want 88% and no more).
---
Nah chief, theres some brain dead people playing this game but its next to impossible to misinterpret it
---
That's assuming one player. If you had an army of bots itd make it exponentially faster.
---
Definitely feel like TL isn‚Äôt vanilla drop rates
---
More like
---
&gt;Poll to make most-used interface in the game less cumbersome and more flexible 
---
Passes, obviously, because 90% of players don‚Äôt care if the xp rates are affected and just want the game to feel nicer to play
---
&gt;Poll to allow rearranging prayer interface 
---
Slightly controversial, likely because many people don‚Äôt want to bother learning a new set of icon placements that they are used to and also may not like the idea of becoming slightly less competitive by not optimizing the prayer locations and relearning
---
Tell me again how many runes it cost you to hit 99 magic?
---
If you look in game at poll results and look on the website, there are different percentages shown. Pass/fail only counts yes vs no. Skipping doesn‚Äôt count towards if something passes or fails. The website shows total % of all votes, unnecessary information, while in game it shows the actual pass/fail %
---
I can smell the auto typer in this pic
---
Question
---
why did they add this but not the same for hardcore harvester?
---
No, what he said makes perfect sense. Lol
---
It was a couple months ago. I just havnt had that experience. Always been easy to get in contact with them for me.
---
Skips aren't counted as no. As long as yes votes outnumber no votes by more than 3:1, it will pass even if 99% of people choose to skip.
---
There are a lot of hypocrites in this game no surprise
---
That can't be right. That's 1.4m per kill?
---
First you'll need to level up your screenshotting.
---
How?
---
It was a function for a year or two in runelite though and I never thought "wow this guy is really getting me I bet he has his prayers reordered the prick".
---
Muscle memory is a thing that a huge majority of PvPers already have.
---
Its actually hilarious because when the spellbook resizing poll failed the majority of people blamed PvPers for spite voting, and now when almost the same thing happens again, people blame PvMers
---
Hi, I informed someone of a technicality in the time clocks where the overwhelming majority of players who experienced the event did so on 6/5/06.
---
You didn‚Äôt do anything but be a dick. 
---
That‚Äôs a discrepancy than people care about everywhere
---
I think that retrieving your items for a cost isn't really a punishment when those bosses literally have consistent 300k loots and its 100k to get your stuff.
---
Server stability isn't really a good argument for me as I feel like saying 'game board's broke, so now we just play around the broken parts' is a really bad argument.
---
i fixed it dad
---
Antifire potions are pretty useful in twisted league. With antifire and protect from magic while using ranged you have 100% protection from brutal dragons. The only way to get more antifires is to kill brutal blue dragons.
---
I fucking hate that the "I had to suffer so you have to suffer" mindset is SO prevalent in this community. Can't improve anything without people whining about it.
---
I'm not sure but damn that fashionscape is on point! haha! I'm working towards getting every hard diary completed and doing barrows as well. Twisted League has thrown a wrench in my progress lol
---
Where did I forget that? I mainly talked about the house being a teleport hub for everything.
---
That includes:
---
* Fairy ring
---
* Obelisk
---
* Spirit Tree
---
* Almost all jewellery (silver and slayer ring excluded)
---
* Almost all teleports on all spellbooks (pretty much all now with recent polls)
---
* Achievement diary cape teleports (can hang on cape rack)
---
Saw someone say "I hate yews, they smell terrible when burned".

Shout out to the unnecessary pitch up and pitch down during the song.

thank you i‚Äôm so glad you like it!!

What do you base that opinion of fof?

Because in this thread I see people blaming PvPers and people blaming PvMers but absolutely nobody saying "I'm a PvPer or PvMer and it's easy scape waaaah"
---
In preparation for Morytania locked twisted leagues.
---
Faster to get ready.
---
i agree!! so excited whenever i see an update
---
That's only on the website results. That was a known and warned about side effect of changing the polling system to allow skip votes. And nobody cared because the results are available ingame accurately.
---
this interaction between them has me laughing every time omg
---
thank you! :D
---
It looks like more than 1b zulrahs
---
Thanks for an actual reply bud. Appreciate you.
---
Haha thanks dude!
---
Sorry I voted no, but I think my reason is arguably justifiable. 
---
I think an element of the game requires being agile regarding different circumstances. I have a main which I use to PvM with with rigour, and I have a pure that I dick around with and have to use eagle eye. I see it as nothing other than an element of skill to be able to quickly do your prayers with both accounts, without creating a place where it would always be (like with prayer reordering).
---
Yes his opinion is just flat out wrong, having a different opinion should be punishable by death. Take his spade
---
Do you really need validation that badly? You've had like 5 "achievement" posts in the last two weeks.
---
Right now, main game feels slow and twisted league feels great. In 50 days when everyone is maxed in twisted league they'll realize the mode has no longevity (of course, it's not supposed to) and will understand why the grind in main game has sustained the game for so many years at this point
---
That's... What they've already done.
---
But it doesn't matter, because they have no way of telling when people are using it.
---
I was playing during this time but not on the same world. It was crazy hearing about it. It was almost mythical at the time

What someone not posting from a pure account, is this even OSRS reddit????

Isnt there a runelite plugin already that reorders your prayers?

Skip was the second most voted option. Many people probably don't care which one gets picked.

Calm down

You don't have to use Runelite and yes I just had to right click on the XP globe and hit ''setup''. Thanks a lot!

---
He used god wars as an example of an area where the risk of obtaining a pet would be nullified by banking actually.
---
I don't actually know how the game handles rolling a pet if you have one out, and a full invent, and kill a boss. Interesting question.
---
Collection log highscores please
---
Neither I wanna go check on my alt but at work ahha
---
Exactly. And you should be able to if you have the forethought and skill to do so.
---
You're talking about a grind at gargoyles, where he has 2 open inventory spaces, prayer flicking the entire time, hoping for one of 2 drops. This grind is going to take even longer than temple trekking. Not to mention he had to go to RF before he could start it, and took a vacation for mental sanity.
---
Imagine voting no on something that doesn‚Äôt have to affect you and makes the game more enjoyable overall. Leave it to the osrs community.
---
During pking a lot of your activity is limited more by your APM than the ticks in the game engine. Gear switching, prayers, combos and specs all require fast and precise clicking. Reordering prayers makes this easier.
---
No. He goes out of his way to produce great content that the entire community enjoys and spends more time on it than a full time job. It doesn‚Äôt benefit him to take this long, he does it to ensure the video is amazing each time. He produces this content for YOU and you have the audacity to bitch and moan. Sit down and wait like everyone else.
---
A couple hundred hours
---
 7 hours a day which he plays at least subtracting the 11 for runefest and taking 15 days off still leaves 30 days for 210 hours so hows it been 56
---
You're taking this way too seriously lol
---
Nice now I can cosplay as drug addict.
---
And then multiple people up voting it.
---
Listen it was just a silly comment
---
This community is full of petty insecure losers who hate people different than them. Even if that difference is how you play a video game.
---
Can I be honest with you? 
---
You‚Äôre kinda fucked unless you have an amazing strategy for these last 3 rounds and then Jad himself. I would just Yolo it and pray you can make it to Jad. You won‚Äôt need brews at JAD anyways so pray you make it to the end with a few doses of restore.
---
This sums up this subreddit lmao
---
No he doesn‚Äôt go out his way he chooses to play rs instead of getting a job
---
I doubt it, there was enough pushback on this design that they had to design, model, and poll two alternatives. They could have saved a lot of work by starting with a less offensive (so to speak) design.
---
managed to get a really scuffed kq kill on my iron early on for hard diary and it didnt count even though i did literally all the damage. fun
---
Range is already OP
---
Not good enough
---
Takes about 3 hours of infinite run in library to get 80+ sooooooo y‚Äôall wrong again lol
---
they can earn way more than $40 a month lmao. If a venezuelan farms zulrah for 8 hours a day at 2m/h thats already $4 a day.
---
Bad troll is bad.
---
lmao who buys magic potions
---
You try perfectly prayer flicking at gargoyles with his gear, no auto rock hammer, or food for 7 hours straight every single day. You‚Äôre hilarious. If I were settled I‚Äôd quit making videos because of ungrateful entitled fucks like you who can‚Äôt appreciate the work he does for YOUR entertainment
---
Getting skull tricked in edge dungeon and losing my D2H and Dlegs
---
Uh fuck no lmfao
---
1 solution , chest. 
---
Price we have to pay should be based around the boss/monster loot table we die at rather then based on gear.
---
For example if you die at dumb place on a slayer task lets say due to dcing, like while barraging nechs. One guy with bis mage shouldnt have to pay lets say 5% im just throwing a random number where one other guy with proselyte pays that same % for that same death. 
---
If the avg monster kill give you 25k, then price to pay on death should be around that in my opinion
---
These last 2 months have been the busiest of my life. I've been away from home for at least 3 of the last 7 weeks. You'll see when the video releases this week why the hold up has been so long. Gargoyles aren't all sunshine and rainbows :) sorry for the wait.
---
i assume it's because of dwh specs and such
---
I voted yes to a few because I know I'll do activities in the future but the last ToB question made no sense to me, so I skipped it.
---
r/hedidthemath
---
who even cares about this ugly armour, it's dead content it should be removed.
---
People on here wonder how people get scammed so easy and here you all are begging for access to this guy's account he's gonna recover
---
Nice projection bro!
---
Great work! The edits are improving over time, as is your speaking!
---
Almost 1k kc. I have 2 necklaces. I think we have the same rng
---
Devalues my Clue Scroll teleport book locked ironman
---
Says the guy who still hasn't finished painting his son's wall after 255 days
---
The Arc teleports in POH. Did they add it yet or do you know if it‚Äôs coming this Thursday?
---
It feels a lot nicer than rs3 honestly, so i‚Äôm about 50/50 on it
---
You hardly need brews even on the last few waves unless you're a low level.
---
I started this thread trying to be a troll I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve actually seen this and replied I‚Äôm gonna delete this thread sorry
---
I remember in my early days I used to hang out at the general store and watch the items going in and out of the store just for fun. It was really cool just to see the icons of items that were out of my reach.
---
Beat me with it üò£
---
Well, I don't remember tbh. I always kept track of the gp/hr not the kills.
---
Jagex: Do you want to hide and change the magic tab icons around, to make things easier in certain situations?
---
Community: Yes
---
Jagex: What about prayer?
---
Community: Yes but actually no because some of us hate the game improving.
---
Sorry you interrupted my final point about how Jagex probably considered calling Ectofuntus, Ectofunctus, because of the funky smell that's likely emitting from that area of Gielinor
---
Thats what happens when you go to the small town stores. Gotta take that baby to varrock
---
