&gt; and there's a censor for a reason

I personally hate it when people say this. Regardless, a perm may be harsh. Lets see what you actually said though?
---
The whip vine looked better than the tent whip too
---
Yup. Not today. Lol
---
Dude this is literally the reason I won’t alt zulrah
---
remove non-BIS spade
---
Ah

hey look its someone who's having a really bad day because no one loves him and no one ever will because he's a fat ugly idiot :(

Sorry for doubting you.

26k from 99 ranged, and 50 more abyssal demons left on task. so probably sire
---
Can you give any example of an overpowered paid plugin OSBuddy offers that RuneLite doesn’t?
---
Fuck man... rolling in the dough with your three rune pickaxe fancy ass.
---
still.  Id personally be gaining a couple million xp a year.  Thats cool
---
My dad said if he found a player in RS3 he would come back. I'm still waiting. Dad we miss you.
---
Dude. Profit means after expenses. If I owned jagex personally I would get the profit because that's the money left over after expenses. Jagex isn't a person, and it is "paid" by the expenses being covered. What are you even talking about.
---
the spec lets you instantly dig to keldagrim and can be used only in the wilderness
---
Dragon boots need slayer as well...
---
This is a must we need more expensive items!
---
Not comparing the two but didn’t woox do it with no inventory too? Some people are just insanely good
---
Wait wait wait.  You’re telling me you can do the varrock agility course tick perfect without any falls for 13200 exp/hr and that is definitely faster than an unfailable method that can be spam clicked to never miss a tick and gives 13320 exp/hr.
---
Please tell me more.
---
Nice work! Where do you burn them at?
---
Nice
---
I think the only unpopulat opinion i saw was rc good
---
Yesn't
---
\&gt; The Angler's outfit is one of the most important skilling outfits   
---
\&gt; It makes zero sense how un-interactive    
---
Skilling? Uninteractive?  My god, we're doomed!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\&gt; The literal only benefit of this game is the Angler's outfit which grants a measly +2.5% fishing exp when worn. 
---
\&gt;The Angler's outfit is one of the most important skilling outfits 
---
Honestly I dont even need to commentate this, youre so assmad youre countering yourself.
---
\&gt; The mining outfit is bought with golden nuggets gained from mining, makes sense. 
---
Mining isnt interactive or exciting, and it certainly qualifies as just clicking.  By your own logic, why arent you furious at mining?  Having gotten both, prospector is much worse to get than angler - and prospector has a use.
---
\&gt; If you're not spam clicking like everyone else, you're late to patch holes and don't get credit.
---
Not remotely true.  Just being on alert allows you to sametick, same as repairing the wt brazier.
---
Does anyone have a guide on training Runecrafting without actually crafting runes. My goal is to hit 55 *eventually*, but I'm happy passively training it over a couple of months using lamps and the like.
---
Here's my plan so far:
---
* Complete the Abyss Miniquest, Eyes of Glouphry and Ascent of Arceuus early on.
---
* Unlock Tears of Guthix and keep Runecrafting as my lowest skill
---
* Get some extra Runecrafting XP from the Arceuus Library minigame
---
* Use all of my lamps from genies, quests and achievement diaries on Runecrafting
---
Am I missing anything else?
---
Lol chaos alter is far faster and far cheaper than ensouled heads.
---
Amen! This right here. I have a crazy amount of goals cause I love planning stuff out. But then I do whatever’s fun, while still working towards one of the goals.
---
be gone with ye easyscape scum
---
Actually i Prefer ZMI Over MLM tbh
---
They released a statement two days ago saying plugins like m left click construction were not okay.
---
Atleast he can play the game now
---
Gross
---
What if we do this for all 3rd party clients and only allow vanilla to have the one click clean?
---
Yes, the two that I was referring to have now been removed I’ve been told, but they were 1 click dragon bones onto altars and removing multiple clicks while training construction. Both of these go against OSRS AHK policy where 1:1 click ratio must be maintained.
---
I do this to a small degree, so I’m curious what your groups are.
---
\&gt; doesn't mean spam clicking on the same spot for 10 minutes is fun. 
---
You really dont need to spam click lol, just be ready to click when the water shows and youre fine.
---
What review?
---
Jiggleplex employees actively avoiding you xd
---
Thanks for the reply.i guess I'll aim for ham storeroom and agility. Ty!!
---
It doesn’t matter, it’s 0 time xp
---
Lmao that’s golden
---
I figured you were talking about those, none of those plugins were paid. But yes they have indeed been removed after Jagex released their statement.
---
Dude you're really good at this sort of thing.
---
Lmao you're a fucking sperg
---
Spec is d b axe but “Reeeee” text instead
---
Pro: gain 50% movement speed (equal to 120 agility)
---
Cons: leaves trail of feces and urine for pkers to follow
---
The great thing about a main is you can do everything a Ironman can do aswell.
---
Took me absolutely hours to get my angler outfit, sure I went well over the drop rate in the end and was considering ending it all after about day 3.
---
Definitely needs an entire rethink, the rewards are shit, the content is shit and the time it takes is shit
---
An Ultimate Iron Man account who never leaves Morytania, search ‘settled’ on YouTube and sit back and enjoy the ride
---
Then what’s the point of the wildy, it’s supposed to be a high risk high reward for PvMers. Some people actually enjoy the feeling of danger while skilling or PvMing in the wildy, and even then, if your smart, at worst you’ll probably lose less than 250k, which shouldn’t be much to people who are able to boss
---
And also because it’s an addition into the wildy doesn’t  make it instantly a pvp update, and I know you didn’t say that but a lot of people will and literally there’s no point in having a wildy if there isn’t content in it, you might as well just go on a pvp world or clan wars at that point
---
And give us irl marks of grace that we can exchange for healthy sandwiches at subway

It depends sometimes I do blacks and risk it of the biscut and sometimes I do reds for safe money

I think nobody would have a problem with this
---
Each their own, i'm on the account build grind in f2p before spending $11 so I'll be able to maintain a bond.
---
Let me tell you, f2p rc bad.
---
Getting perm muted in a 2019? You said some pretty fucked up shit
---
No inventory is definitely easier, relatively speaking. Your DPS is WAY higher so you have to prayer flick for a much shorter time. Less window to fuck up. Xzact had to be almost perfect for 10 hours.
---
L0l dude have you seen the reasons they hand out perm mutes, it's fucking pathetic.
---
"Bis gear comes from tob"
---
"mentions justiciar"
---
top kek
---
&gt; Telling a maxed player it’s more fun to train hunter than to do the second hardest and most dangerous PvM content is absurd.
---
Nowhere did I mention "fun" 
---
Keep making stuff up.
---
Imp catcher is like that too. I love it
---
Youre right. People love people do stupid things.
---
Theyre noobs. Go do wilderness content.
---
Damn this is a sad comment chain of virginity
---
In*** for the title
---
Like imagine you’re getting told Raids 3 is being worked on, a JMod gets upset and cans their work, and you end up getting something like The Gauntlet 2 years later. Like don’t get me wrong I love the Gauntlet and it’s like raiding sure, but it’s no raids content like CoX and ToB  we can all agree. I’m not mad but holy shit it’s upsetting to see the potential take such a nosedive when 2 years ago I was jumping out my seat we were getting such new hard quests, especially for something as special as a BiS piece...
---
Bit of a backstory: Chat wanted him to gamble his inferno and offered him 300+ subs + a bunch of bits. He got distracted by chat and then that happened. He previously killed that guy 2-3 times for 160m risk each time, hence felt comfortable to not pay as much attention as usual.
---
By building your own client in a Java IDE.
---
Song of the Elves has a pretty good one where an NPC who was supposed to do something while you got the requested item goes "coincidentally, I've finished my task already as well."
---
Yes they have! And they reduced their HP so with BP/rune or dragon darts and rigour and 90+ range you can out DPS the orbs on the 3rd phase do you don’t have to go running around like a madman.
---
Get some wildy pets. More impressive than some useless tob items hes not gonna put to use, honey.
---
Go play a different game, ffs. I’m so glad jagex has outlined just how much people have been CHEATING on this game that I love. Cry babies saying how much the vanilla client is “unusable.” Tell me how I play with it then? You’re literally just a whiny bitch. The content isn’t unusable, you’re just looking for something to make the game easier for yourself.
---
You know I used to not really care about pkers and their updates, I'd vote Yes on everything, but now after having been flamed by many different obvious pkers you guys have literally just been digging your own grave because people like me who were on ur side despite being a pvmer now actually hate you guys, not even because of the gameplay (which idc about because I don't go into the wilderness and even when I do idc if I get pked) but I simply hate you guys because overall ur just flat out terrible people . So good on you guys for making enemies.

It’s same as how you wouldn’t expect tassys to do so much more than a set of platelegs because it’s a skirt lmao

What’s a pretty fast way of collecting fossils? I’m trying to complete museum kudos and am looking for a good way to find them.

That's what I'm thinking as well.
---
Shit at least swan song had more of a fight than Exiles haha
---
Holy shit i didnt know until you mentioned it but its exactly like spy vs spy. Thats a fat reference that i dont think many people will get
---
It may have been a grandmaster quest before but keep in mind it was released as a master quest, I do agree for a master it was short  but I thoroughly enjoyed the quest.  I think this helm shoulda have been worse then the serp helm and when the grandmaster quest is released it beat serp helm. But that’s just me.  Bu for a master quest I think you based a lot of expectations of the original post of it being grandmaster and that’s where your disappointment comes from. Although I do understand where you are coming from!
---
I figured proselyte was porcelain.
---
Luckily the CC I'm in will have about 4 volunteers in about 15 seconds to help me out so I see no issue with it. Just join a clan
---
Stfu, I’m at base 70s and don’t want easy scape. You guys are trying to justify your cheating. Jagex has finally clarified that you are CHEATING which I have always said about most third party plugins. I love this press release. Go play a different game if you think the mechanics are too tough for you.
---
People LIKE doing dragon slayer though. It's a fun milestone, and it allows you to wear rune platebody. Not everyone wants to rush torso.
---

You're either a great troll or genuinely stupid.

Amen brother. Fuck these cheaters. So happy we can officially call them what they’ve always been: cheaters.
---
So much yes
---
Runecrafting is just agility with more annoying steps.
---
life is pain
---
"da bad men calld me names"
---
If roasting speds ends up preventing any future PvP updates for OSRS, then that's A ok with me pal. I wouldn't want it any other way
---
:/ sorry. Try sending a ticket via jagex website and explain and ask them to transfer you to the correct department if possible. Never hurts to try.
---
It's definitely one of the easier Master level quests, but I think it is comparable at least in requirements (though 60 fishing just to fish the pet rock from the geyser is hilarious) and end boss.  The length and storyline fell flat for me. It's a 30 min quest that felt like it was missing parts of the story here and there. Swan song at least had a story and length that was in line with the reward, a new fish and some meager xp.
---
Is it faster to mine at the 3 coal rocks in the dwarven mine or the 7 in the southwest Lumbridge swamp mine? Barb village is always packed.
---
43 mining, adamant pick, f2p, ironman if any of that matters.
---
gay
---
Lmao okay bud have fun with ur choices
---
They’re adding several new positions, like a marketing team manager and shit. In other words, they’re down sizing j mods in order to pay administrative costs (ie: marketing team). Golden age of OSRS dwindling man
---
This. I like all their step styles, because its a super dumbed down version of every other clue. You've got Sherlock style clues, hot and cold style, and go here wear this and do this style.
---
But hot and cold could do with an arrow flashing on minimap or something. Make it noob friendly. And one step would mean you get exposed to clues without wasting a lot of time for a few hundred gp.
---
Lol real
---
I think sulliusceps?
---
Upvoted. Gl
---
You're "butthurt" and it's hilarious. I made the right choice
---
Well played
---
Comment with what you were saying
---
Use humidify spell on grimy herbs. Now you get 150-450herbexp per inventory. Could become new meta.
---
Nah, I’m not a cheater.
---
So, I used to play on my main, approximately level 105 combat with decent-ish other skills. I took a break to build a pking account, after being inspired by some Youtube videos. Well, long story short, that evolved into me making 4 MORE various pking accounts, over the course of about 7 months. Currently, I haven't played OSRS in about 3 weeks because I'm playing a little bit of WoW Classic with an IRL friend who is super into it. But my urge to play some more on my old main account has been getting at me, I just haven't wanted to buy membership while I'm busy playing another game.  
---
TL;DR:  
---
If you aren't entirely uninterested in the idea of Pking, try researching/Youtubing various easy-to-make pking accounts and see if any seem fun! I spent 6-7 months building accounts and pking on them after I got bored of my main.
---
Okay now I'm convinced you're trolling.
---
Indeed, the biggest problem is that you are not even trying to "beat" the trawler minigame: you try to beat the inactivity timer.
---
Looks like Mat K saw something coming in May and everyone followed suit in September. Hopefully this doesn't continue. ):
---
Nah I'm just indifferent cuz my game isn't gonna be affected at all lmao
---
have fun at the bottom
---
yeah, mains just buy all their shit lol. it's kinda sad. like at least 1 out of every 4 people are just buying gold, if not more. i don't get it either. wtf is the point of playing the game if you just buy max gear straight away and you're this clueless.
---
I too forget somedays which sub I’m on then I realize they’re all a win.
---
Cheater
---
Agreed I feel like I paid so much more attention to previous story lines. The build up was way better for them. Knowing you had fucking Galvek a few ships away ready to start dropping OHKOs on you makes the fight and the purpose the more real. I didn’t even know where tf this snake came from but I don’t think I even used any food.
---
Isnt that what one click blackjacking was or am i mistaken
---
Very true actually now that I look at it. Sire is more of an arbitrary time gate whereas grotesques are more of a dps check.
---
Cheers.
---
I just got to point where I’m burnt out on my hcim. Got a rune scimitar, platebody, and skirt. I just ran out of gp so no more magic training. 
---
Just doing a little bit of farming now everyday since thieving and wt sound horrible right now
---
what about just the wc guild? lol im stupid
---
Stop botting
---
I like how the bird has a little pair of sunglasses.
---
Legendaries offer the same stats as ascended weapons which themselves only offer an incredibly minor upgrade to exotics. So minor, it's not even worth it.
---
That's a carrot on a stick for a cosmetic difference, not a total game-changer like T-Bow and Blowpipe.
---
Wow, 30 upvotes and you're the first guy to point it out, thanks haha.
---
&gt; Bryophyta, Obor,
---
Didn't know about those, thanks!
---
If you’re gonna bank em, ideally woodcutting guild on a quiet world. The prif ones are a really good choice as well.
---
Personally if I’m gonna be dominantly AFK, I just hog the one tree in Port Sarim, close to the deposit box on the docks.
---
If not banking them, or if you don’t care about the walk, lumby graveyard is almost always empty.
---
I tried reposting on Reddit earlier today because this post got removed, and the new one I made got removed as well so I think reddit is out of the question. Not to mention apparently it's against Rule #7 on reddit. Tried twitter already, they didn't help..
---
Also I can't seem to find any contact page for Jagex, they just loop you back to the RuneScape support pages which have no contact method. =/
---
you can roll the same pet more than once, but you won't actually get another copy of it
---
you just get a chat message saying you would have been followed
---
That sounds good 1 most of the time but sometimes it'll be 2
---
If they haven't re-broken into your account in all the time you've spent away from the game then I'd say your account is secure. Make sure you enable 2 factor authentication and a bank pin!
---
You'd be surprised how many people play dice bots lol. It's pretty lucrative.
---
Legitimately curious.. Besides making it so phase transitions don’t eat your attack, what would you change about sire? He’s my 2nd favorite behind Cerberus
---
200 corrupted kc and I have seen 2 seeds
---
I gave up awhile ago
---
So given how the polls work, the ones that say they don't want things devalued are actually a minority? Since it would have to be below 75% to have prevented these weapons from coming into the game in the first place?
---
Probably a multiboxer and not bots.
---
Buyable skill. Xp for eating a particular item is dynamic based roughly on GE prices and volume: Theoretical xp rates of up to 1mil xp/hr for eating twisted bows and third age equipment.
---
Go to your mini-games tab and scroll down until you see Shield of Arrav. Click on it and then click "join" to enter the SoA public chat.
---
There's an attachment that takes it back to 50%, just gotta risk a bit more
---
I would be in full support of this change
---
We don't know your gear, stats, setup, or switches?
---
No problem dude
---
Actually a great idea.  I hope jagex takes note of this.  The media would gobble this shit up, plus I would definitely use it.
---
I actually did like it when you couldn't actually ID it until you had the herb level for it.
---
Huh, I thought observatory was still required. Til
---
No wonder no one new is playing the game is a nostalgia machine that is all :(
---
Lol went to bonnaroo this year and you're not wrong

And you lose all coordinates if you die above 30 wilderness with the book in your inventory
---
Lol
---
Gz lol
---
&gt; "Spear"fishing
---
&gt;shooting the fish with bows
---
Bow fishing is an actual thing

I would think you could just get the book back with the coordinates you unlocked still unlocked
---
10h doing a boring and repetitive task and youre 2% of the way
---
what did runescape do to us
---
Where’s the fun and excitement in that 😅
---
I like this. Nothing op, just good stuff.
---
Change pw.
---
Alot of them borrrow accounts
---
play better, raise your stats, get better gear. those are how you get more kills per trip and per hour lol.
---
that's a vague answer to a vague question.
---
Temporarily gives you EoC abilities so that you can just murderify every pker in a 2 square radius.
---
damn 3 pet and no head yet
---
Sweet yea I made sure to have both of those on my account. Thanks a lot!
---
Cute I like it :)
---
nah, you can pre-heart at bank if you want but you don't even really need to
---
What’s the point of this? Isn’t he just gonna be pking people with rune? Seems like a lot of work for not much profit. Idk tho I don’t pk.
---
Is that a spoiler? He did it all last episode too.
---
Ah nice, im actually doing something similar too.
---
Not sure if the quest still is, don't think so though
---
that doesnt make them log off.

People often forget the one in varrock palace

“I don’t enjoy this mini game, you should get the set from somewhere else”
---
Fishing trawler shouldn’t be afk, it kicks you for afking for a start. The set is there to make the trawler used again, it’s a piece of content that was abandoned due to no reason to do it except the rays and turts. Now there’s another reason to visit and experience the mini game.
---
Faster
---
why are any of these necessary?  would these be tradable?
---
How are other people in the comments calling an amulet with no quest req that is stronger than magic secateurs not op?
---
I think more people would read this if it wasnt an image. None dark mode really sucks.
---
On Android 9 it says this app doesnt support split screen, guess ill have to update soon
---
He's already level 8!
---
dont forget your gmaul for infinte spec or claws if u can afford them
---
That's not the alternative... And this rant isn't intentionally directed at you, but:
---
The alternative is not addressing it. Instead, they picked it apart and mentioned anyone can make glassdoor reviews and it didn't match up with their experiences. They even laugh at the chat suggestion "blink 4 times if your lofe is in danger" or whatever the case it was.
---
Im really sick of this stupid shit fear monger. Oh no! MTX ARE COMING! ALL JAGEX IS LEAVING SHIP!! 3RD PARTY CLIENTS ARE DONE FOR!! THIS IS THE END OF OSRS AS WE KNOW IT - SUMMER IS OVER AND PLAYER COUNTS ARE DECLINING!! AHHHHHHH
---
Save your breath for the real criticism IMO. And if one does criticism, do so with critical thinking
---
I think you need an Onyx to make the Zenyte shard into an Uncut Zenyte
---
Oh of course I should have known
---
Def WC guild, super close to a bank, just play on an unpopulated world
---
i like the fire stone: just a cool piece of content with the downside of an invent slot. maybe it could stack with the infernal pickaxe by producing a bar when something gets 'smelted' for smith xp (and no additional % or coal required: straight 33% not 43%). 
---
the ring of bearing is pretty niche, as i'd rather have the explorer ring for its pray bonus, energy regen, and cabbage teles. but maybe for questing and those long, early morning farm runs where you're doing your herbs, fruit trees, regular trees, celastrus, calquats, cactus, all at the same time.
---
the amulet, aside from the potential seed return, is actually worse than magic secateurs as most farm runners will wear a skills necklace so you end up losing an inventory space for that, and the weapon slot is never really used during farm runs. plus, secateurs are allowed on entrana. i don't see it being used for seed return as it's only herbs that die, and they only die 10% of the time, and if you do 3 herb runs a day and 6 herbs per run, you might get 2 deaths (1.8 deaths exactly), so you'll get a seed return once every \~12 days. meh, not really worth it.
---
the boots is an interesting one because there isn't a single item that reduces run energy drain, and wearing them means you can't get the graceful effect, so you'll need to switch between the boots: swiftness for running and graceful for walking/standing. there's an invent spot right there. might be useful during quests and that early morning farm run.
---
overall it's some pretty cool stuff, none of it is OP, and someone will get use out of all of them somewhere.
---
I’m assuming your the one in the chaos robes in what looks like an obby cape as well so...
---
It's also the only way to get the phoenix pet.
---
I think around 4 hours is the life span of a generic f2p bot.
---
I would level agility this way. Give us 1 xp per 5/10 steps. Use gps tracking to make sure they're not just taping it to a vibrator.
---
Those are actually really good imo...
---
He said it was from ezscape, despite this being the design from 2008-2012, when RS2 was slower and more tedious than current OSRS.
---
I always drop clues with hot and cold. Fuck the reward.
---
Not to mention the games themselves are different, ocarina and s64 were classic simple but effective platformers... those are few and far between nowadays. All that comes to mind is uncharted
---
Thanks I love it
---
Oh wow.. I’m only at 85 crafting on my Ironman now and this is news to me. That sucks fat balls. Looks like I’ll need to go grind out another 300 barrows chests.
---
I hope its not something like you fell asleep and accidentally pushed a couple buttons. I've done that before; dozed off while at WT and found myself trying to fletch my sara brews.
---
Little does he realise that he will be chasing that endorphin rush he received when digging up the reward casket for the rest of his runescape life

Lavas are neither fun nor good exp. It's best for rc yea but ist still dogshit exp.

Appreciate you!

Very freakin nice! I'd be stoked!

I havent seen it done since 07. Doubt it would work anymore on anyone short of total noob.

no sure why downvoted but ok

Isn’t there a spade in one of the houses just south of the garden?

you either get it or you don’t

Someone mentioned that I should try my hand at these a while back, and I'm satisfied with the results. A few more images are available on the blender sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/dc4964/lego_barrows_brothers_old_school_runescape/).
---
They're **not always the minority**, but with our current 75% pass rate the people who are opposed to change and vote no in polls have a much stronger vote. For every person that doesn't want the new content, it takes 3 yes votes to counter them.
---
One example, the Warding poll
---
&gt;**"Should we add the core skill, Warding..."**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Yes 66.1% (82633 votes)  
---
&gt;No 33.4% (41726 votes)  
---
&gt;Skip question 0.7% (788 votes) 
---
Similar with Sailing in 2015
---
&gt; **Shall we release the Sailing skill?**  
---
&gt;Yes 68.0% (50131 votes)  
---
&gt;No 32.1% (23665 votes) 
---
As you can see there with warding, 82k people voted yes to what would be a massive update, only 41k voted no. 
---
With 82k people voting yes, even around 27k people voting no would have kept it under 75%.
---
Jesus good eye lol, my girl was playing and yeah it is skywell. Its a good ass fucking game but apparently corp is better lol, even if i didnt get an ely yet
---
dumb question but do vanity items (santa hats, chefs hats etc) change armor? i got some cool clothes but im new so i don't want them to degrade my defence
---
Same thing for bots, they literally can't do anything without hiring more people which they won't do because money
---
Try the whole Souls series. I guess you won't regret it. Imo games that stay true to what you said.
---
Its a nice break from slayer and bossing. And they add up even if u dont get crazy rare stuff
---
Osrs Just made me so fucking patient irl.
---
Takes 2h on this line just to do some easy paperwork? *Just like grinding runecrafting baby*

It’s just so you can not interrupt your attacking to eat if you only need like say 5-10 hp in order to not die, bringing 1 can possibly lengthen a trip by a small amount cause you don’t lose ticks eating regular food

I use the vanilla client since there are rarely any plugins that interest me and I don't want to deal with all the bloat that comes with clients, even if the game may run better after I comb through all the options. Though I have considered using clients for my maybe someday eventually HCIM for a few features like increased render distance and skyboxes.
---
Though what you describe is one of my issues with clients. They've become the standard to the point that even most new players will use them and they may not fully realize everything the client is doing (i.e. how many times I've seen complaints about Jagex breaking something with an update when it was a client). But even if you do use a client for some specific features like performance, compatibility, some useful QoL, or such, you'll likely get exposed and grow accustomed to a lot of other stuff you didn't sign up for so to speak which can warp your perception of the game. And that, in turn, influences what the community is willing to vote into the game, which kinda undermines polls to an extent.

Thanks famm

well idk what to say man =/

Your house smells like farts

I stopped my f2p experience after completing most of the f2p quests, since you'll want the quest points for recipe for disaster in members anyways and they dont have high requirements. No real reason to spend time in members doing f2p questing.

You can't imbue it any more, since Song of the Elves was released. Crystal weapons don't degrade any more.

I don’t know about these clients much, but as far as I’m aware they release in versions right? What’s stopping players not updating their clients if the plugins aren’t actually detectable?

Poorly worded opinion, looks more like a rant than anything. You think they care what you wrote? Lol

[Here is the transcript](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dbk9eg/old_school_developer_qa_transcript_30092019/) for the stream.
---
As for their statement, it is pretty reasonable despite what some are claiming. The guideline they gave was "We consider features which enable you to bypass gameplay mechanics to be unacceptable, like those which might indicate where projectiles would land, where NPCs might spawn, or which protection prayers to activate.", which of course is open to interpretation as guidelines and rules tend to be. But they gave some examples of unacceptable features and will continue to add on to it in the future.
---
It is also worth noting, they do say that only features on that list are considered against the rules and that if they update the list, they will give warning ahead of time so players (and clients) have time to comply. So any client that is removing a bunch of plugins because they might fall under the guideline is acting way too preemptively.
---
We need this for different types of clues, I believe. Like Reldo hot/colds and anagrams. Awesome idea man
---
This is what happens when you guys complain. I hope you guys are happy! 
---
I died in 2012 losing the dclaws I sold my entire bank for. Logged onto a friends pure though Dclaws = pk kills. Fucked up protect item and died instantly. Quit for 7 years lmao

---
Honestly such a bad addition to the game imo.  Treasure trail tables already had SO much trashy cosmetic garbage, then they added a full tier basically dedicated to being worthless trash.  Those valuable drops should've just been added to easys (Which already are absolutely irrelevant to mid-late game players, let alone beginner scrolls.
---
Also fucks the drop tables for lower clue scrolls I believe? Honestly shocked they ever passed.  Would've made a lot more sense to make easy scrolls F2P or something.
---
At least this one was real, as compared to A Friend who just watched as his HC died (how many times now?)
---
Alright first off construction won’t give you carpal tunnel unless you do it for hours on end daily. Mahogany tables cap at 900K+/hr and 99 is just over 13M exp. So don’t use that straw man. Secondly, nobody is forcing you to Black Jack. Pyramid plunder and Ardy knights exist for a reason, sure they’re less exp but way less effort so it makes sense. The issue with 3rd party plugins is they made/make every previously high effort high reward activity way more brain dead or easy which is something that absolutely shouldn’t be encouraged when there’s less effort but more reclined activities available.
---
They dont see it coming
---
Bro of course pure gear has less requirements than main gear. That's like the whole point. Pures are a much lower level than mains and their gear is a lot worse. Just because an item is BIS for Pures does not mean it even comes close to the BIS main gear. 
---
Your argument is that a pure can go to the GE and just buy all this gear, but it's because it's barely mid tear gear. Do you want every low level gear item to be locked behind a quest?
---
Also, this post is implying that all these items are solely put into the game for PvP and balanced based on their impact on PvP. News flash, that ain't the case.
---
Seems more like he's exaggerating to make a point that the vague statement doesn't really specify anything.... Except for the very new features OSB have added that were clearly pushing the limit.
---
I killed crazed archaeologists and was a bit unlucky for the drop rate. but i did get a shard.

'unpopular' here meaning 'obvious consensus'...?

Nooo wayyy :( . i remember that one

I plan on designing more Lego RuneScape objects and characters, but if I really decide to build an injection molding setup - then we'll have some real parts and it would be epic.
---
I feel like im having a stroke while trying to figure out which way to read this.
---
Calm your fucking tits. Ur just trying to exclude the pure community from bis weapons pures already exclude themselves from the defensive bis and are already disadvantaged. Offensive gear is used for high offensive stats and since pures have that should have access to that content. Your not taking away a pures ability to at least be on the same level in the offensive respect. Incase ur dumb ass isn't aware best in slot defensive gear bolsters the offensive capabilities of these weapons, this is why a maxed main will always hit harder then a pure and why u should fuck off.

You have bad posture
---
&gt;Why cant we have a left-click offer bones option on altars? 
---
You can already use 1 bone then afk the whole inventory, if someone wants to click a lot they can get more xp, but there should be significant effort since its 2-3x the xp hour of afking.
---
Every skill except construction has a low effort / afk alternative method, and even construction can be done without having to move your mouse. You just want the xp/hr of the intensive methods without the effort.
---
Newborn? Chill time? 2 am?
---
Bank tellers don't have left click options, the booths Infront of them do, and are 1 tick slower when running to the bank for things like smithing.
---
Look, you clearly admit you arent using public client based scripts. How am i being smart? The whole topic here is releasing a bot client no?

That's what I thought at first lol

Runelite.net was actually a running website before runelite got the domain. You can still see it in the way back machine I think

Yes and no. The average for uniques is 1/256...so the average amount of uniques at 1000 kc is 4. You're at 7, almost double that. That said, it kinda sucks that you keep getting Onyx, which you really only need a few of as an Ironman. You probably want the fangs, I assume

This guy is SUCH a bitch. Remove your fucking OP plugins. There’s a CLEAR LINE that makes 1click con/alter/black jacking possible and fucking being able to 1 click a house portal to join a host’s house. Like grow the fuck up. Such a sore loser. RuneLite won.

Probably because number 2 has 200+ people, so most just click to that thinking "well everyone else is using that one so it must be better". And then they keep reentering that

It's a lot harder than most jobs lol. People shit on streamers for having an "easy" job. If it was so easy everyone would do it. You have to be naturally entertaining and out up with the constant cancer of twitch chat. Most people can't do either of those things, much less both.
---
And that's not even getting into things like barely being able to take breaks or the whole face cam thing. I've never personally streamed but I've thought about it, and it seems like a lot just to get going and build a following.

Soup Nazi was on the funniest skits

You’re welcome. I don’t think there is anyone worth their salt who would claim the official client is lacking. I do, even tho I’m happy playing on it, my reasoning is there was a need for other clients to fulfil some people’s desire to play. Anyone who plays a 3pc can’t argue the base client doesn’t need work as their own activity undermines that position.
---
They're all rare drop table. Has nothing to do with abyssal Demons drops. It's a 1/64 chance to hit that table.
---
Everything on it has an absurd rate because of how the table works.
---
at the end of the day we have a poll system for a reason. if the majority wants to implement the basic entry swapping 3p clients have then do it- we already got things like this for mobile.
---
letting client devs run wild though obviously is not ideal. the fact that the vanilla client isnt a priority is just crazy nowadays. it made sense early on but the osrs team is not small, they can definitely hire a client dev or two. osrs has clearly produced a number of people capable of working on the client and who would obviously be willing to work part/full time if they got offers to.
---
yeah people shouldn't be muted unless it's targeted repeated harassment
---
I mean, most pures are alts, so makes sense. Especially considering skill requirements(or even rewards) of a lot of quests
---
1. Agreed
---
2. Agreed
---
3. Loot Logger is IN THE GAME. All you have to do is set "valuable drop notification" to 1 gp.
---
4. Bank tellers don't have left-click. They're right-click Bank and left-click Talk. Bank Booth is the one with left-click in default client
---
5. Reduces lag and makes clicking on things easier at Ardy Knights, Wintertodt, Gilded Altars, and other places where there are too many people in a single place
---
6. There are more Shark spots on the South dock, in case you didn't know. Still annoying to check the spots, though
---
7. \*shrug\*
---
8. Yeah, puzzle solver doesn't "reduce clicks" it just takes the brain work out of it. And I have to agree, after I've done a handful, they're just tedious. Clue rewards aren't good enough to warrant that time
---
Nice.
---
He asked that someone skymeme his death. This is the only way I thought I could make it work.
---
I wouldnt have issue with pkers if they werent toxic. If i get pked by some silent dude I just dont care.
---
I am, I do. I am asking for a simple QoL update to cater to a certain play style that I and some others might appreciate. People don't have to agree but I wouldn't expect to get shit on so much for posting something that isn't a meme for once
---
they could also just merge the two.
---
Just work on base 80s, then 85s then 90s. Makes it all a little bit more tolerable.
---
Is it worth it to buy a bunch of earth talismans to runecraft lava runes if I don’t have 82 magic for magic imbue? I want 55 runecrafting for exiles and I only have 23 right now.
---
Oh that would be interesting
---
Make the rewards items non-unique and make them items that noobs would appreciate but experienced players wouldn’t care for like a guaranteed steel item or an enchanted amulet.

Bots would run riot?! Jeeze, imagine that!

Yes and wilderness content is respected. Non dangerous content is not respected because it doesn't differentiate you from a normal ironman account. Not sure what you aren't understanding here.
---
i went according to his account photo xD
---
but also vampire slayer isn't even a questline or involving any lore or worldbuilding it's basically just a one-off quest that tells you nothing and builds towards nothing or leaves any unanswered questions or mystery
---
I love watching Wild Mudkip videos
---
Splash?
---
What theme and rewards would you want?
---
No ones shitting on you, believe me, you’d know about it if they were at least in my case. You raise a fair point but I feel you’d get the same response from the Jmods if you asked this on a live stream. There is already so much work load for the Devs to do. Could you really justify taking them away from other commitments and projects to get this change implemented when it’s such a niche request that will only effect a small % of the player base? Like I said it’s a fair question but there’s already means to do what you’re asking in the game.
---
Thanks, Jad came out better than i thought id do
---
&gt;But yeah make more generic comments that are as dumb as the clue step itself since it's out of place and makes no sense.
---
The only thing out of place here seems to be you if you think an MMORPG should change something to cater to a solo player. Go play a single-player game if you can't stand asking someone for help in an online game.
---
&gt;I.e; personal account growth.
---
Do you know what the semi-colon is for? Anyways, "personal account growth" is the entire game. Pretty broad strokes there, bud. Clue Scrolls are meant to be a distraction from the grind with a hint of hope that you might get rich. That's all they are. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
1: why censor the rune/cash amounts
---
2 : thats a 150k drop, if you dont want it ill take it 
---
Nah but in all seriousness, if youre big dick mc moneybags with a pricey setup, I see how that can be annoying but if your low level then...
---
Lmao absolutely not
---
Is it the mustache?
---
I don't feel like ironman limiting at all. Quite the opposite. There aren't metas to conform to for gaining gp and you can do every bit of content. The game also caters a majority of its updates to the ironman mode, so there's always fresh content; unlike the end game scene.
---
Weight only affects drain, minimum drain is achieved at 0kg. Recovery is only affected by agility level and graceful effect.
---
That said, the additional weight reduction is useful for negating drain from heavy items.
---
Lmfao

Honestly I agree, makes no sense why jad and cox are safe content.

Should I raise defense levels at all? Range?

Bruh I play an iron man simply because it limits what I can do. I can’t simply buy my quest items, I can’t simply buy a skill. I’m limited in the choices to get to a goal. The fact Ironmen are limited is the reason I play one. The very nature of an Ironman is that they’re limited.
---
Just figured I'd chime in and add onto your first point: I got 120 Construction in RS3 doing prawnbrokers (Slightly better than tables, but still just as click-intensive) and don't have carpal tunnel, anyone who calls it the carpal tunnel skill is majorly exaggerating.
---
the price would naturally go up from the buff and the book has no accuracy or defence bonuses
---
you need some?
---
Not great money or xp rates and there are no afk methods, but it's vital for many activities
---
4.5k kc at vork on 2 accounts and no pet :,) Gratz
---
Go into your runelite  settings.property files and modify your zuk KC to something ridiculous, like 69 or 420. Mines set to 1200 and it gets people every time
---
So you honestly believe that he is reacting rationally to the news post and the attitude of the community toward OSB and its recent plugins? You think there's no spite behind what he's saying? You also believe that the recent OSB plugins that people have been calling to be removed are also present in RL (or were until this announcement came out)? I'm against anything that reduces clicks, but menu entry swapper in RL vs 1 click black jacking seem to be different to me. You believe otherwise?

You can get carried or learn non-sweaty tactics but there is a pretty high skill ceiling and some advanced tactics that take practice. I wouldn't says its extremely difficult and you can find teams at all skill levels so jump in!

Yup and they're still fine.

OSB are just throwing a bitch fit over something they're completely misinterpreting for... Some reason?

Guess theyre annoyed that they're not Jagex's golden goose now.

I can admit to this now but the best scam of all time back in real 07 was when whips were 1.5m I would offer 1711k for it so they would accept quick. Then decline and say sec and trade them 1171k for it. I think I made like 9m in a week. I thought i was the richest best scammer ever.

If Jagex wanted all menu entry swappers gone (including left click banking) they would have specifically said all menu entry swappers.

The fact that they specifically mentioned the blackjacking plugin and such implies heavily that they only wanted to remove those specific types of plugins, but didn't want to appear too focused on a handful of particular instances

Vanilla client does a fine job with displaying valuable/untradeable drops in red.

I guess I don't have as negative of an outlook on things, idk.

It certainly amazes me.

they started to go up when scythe was crashing, im assuming people sold scythe and stopped doing tob and did other activities that involved blow pipe, outside of that i dont think jagex has banned enough bots to effect scale prices, seeing how the same 13 zulrah bots are still running on 2k worlds that have been running for the last 4 months now.

If your account is built to pk, you’re going to struggle lots. Your best bet is to try LMS or pk in BH worlds. In the wild, you run into a pker, you will more than likely die if you don’t know how to properly switch prayers and eat. Running into pvmers is usually free loot. Jet Jeep practicing, I usually reccomend making a separate account to pk with if you’re starting off.

I know there's a thing in RS3 with construction where if certain rooms were removed, the contents would remain if rebuilt in the future. I feel it would be a good idea to test if this would be the case here as well, as I'm sure mods can view account logs to verify your story regardless what happened, without needing you to have the room counter evidence. That helped establish your stories legitimacy to get traction, but wouldn't be needed by jmods.

You're right, new content/armours would be way better.

I only say this as a OK cos the power creep can be too real sometimes, not sure we already need a new bis mage set

I wish I could upvote this twice
---
attach the step counter to my right hand and ill have 99 agi so fast lol
---
Maybe he has to deal with travel expenses if he gets an interview and would like to calculate his steps?
---
Yeah, not even fossil island with max view distance lags that much.
---
If many people on Glassdoor say it is low then it would probably be true? Though i also recall mat k saying in one of his streams after he left jagex that the pay is competitive with other UK game developers. Who knows, i guess you can find out by applying lol.
---
He’s just gonna have to grind out 2k total and play at 4am. In fact this could be like the entire point of the series, to finally be able to use the GE. Would watch.
---
Like nearly every single player on oldschool?
---
New lvl 1 range pures are now meta
---
lol
---
Petition to change character skin color to the whitest tone when losing HC status.
---
Very informative and entertaining. 10/10 will watch more content of yours.
---
Brilliant! Keep it up.
---
You know what really grinds my gear?
---
Mate what, maltesers are great
---
Very true, I would be very keen to see what jagex could come up with.
---
Devalues my 40 runecrafting.
---
Lol imagine talking shit when you're in the 2k world
---
This message brought to you by the 2200 world gang
---
Remember tears of guthix as well. It's a minigame(I guess?) Done weekly. It gives a xp in your lowest stat. The more quest points you have the longer you last. 100% worth doing, I rarely see people mention it too. It takes 2 minutes max lol
---
Regulars are gay, ultimates are leagues above us in brain material unless they die in the wilderness.
---
I bet most non losers' minds never go there at all and he didn't have to try very hard
---
Lmao relax. Everyone is still using these clients. Hell still a bunch more using op plugins. At the moment, it's an honor system. A lot of stuff is impossible to detect. Clue scroll solver is allowed lmao?
---
Yea, mage is decent dps vs full rune, but unlikely to KO because the max is so low.
---
welcome to runescape
---
focus zulrah as that seems like your current best money maker. you will make 13m back in literally no time.

the game only begins after bought cape

---
Hey doggo
---
Can you show pictures of your house? Really interested :)
---
I like the way it is designed to be rewarding once you hit the unique table, but no offense, but you guys have made so many slayer and default bosses so rewarding each time you strike them down. Look at Zulrah? how will these ever be near as rewarding? will you keep buffing them until they become inferno tier content? 
---
No seriously, before you change plans of how drops should work, perhaps step back and take a look of how you balanced other bosses/slayer creatures.
---
I freaking love gauntlet but there is really no way I wanna do that for the blade hunting and it is not rewarding enough like any other content you have created the last years.
---
THIS WAS NOT POLLED!
---
There's definitely some mechanical issues going on here. I will get it on film.  
---
As for the space between items in your inventory, and attack option in safezone. That's something anyone can confirm. This needs to be fixed.
---
The only way the jaw keeps its price is due to people not unlocking/skipping the task, because it is **tedious**, especially for a Level 60 slayer monster. Those things are harder than most, if not all, regular slayer monsters with that low of a requirement. That's really weird game design imo.
---
Was the safespot that bad? I've been here 6 days and killed around 1700 in it (no drop), it's so rare off task that it doesn't seem to matter if you range them, its also a lot slower. Why remove it?
---
I've probably made like 10-b from flipping and merching over the last 3 years. 
---
So yeah... figure out the right stuff and time is your greatest asset. 
---
That said, I regularly lose all of it staking lmao. 
---
With 13m you can easily flip basic stuff that'll net you 100k-200k margins easily. Spend like 1 minute max setting that up and go play the game. 
---
Ranarr seeds and snapdragons are a super easy, consistent one.
---
I don't PK and if I didn't read player concerns about Q1, Q2 I would ask why is that even a question. It's almost impossible to lose any piece of gear in PvM, so nobody knows the pain of regearing.
---
if the filthy pvmers vote no cuz they dont like wildy and had some toxic experience with pker brats then fuck it imma be voting no for all pvm contont from here on out  this grudge cant be 1way only im striking back this time
---
wah
---
I got my first zen on 27 total kc and have now gone over 700 dry haha
---
where was the bitching done here, didnt see a single post on reddit complaining they were easy, now there was complaining there wasn't enough spawns for the demand but that is to be expected for a new update.  The only place i saw a single post about them being to easy for a bis, was on twitter.  If they are going to look at just twitter on the 2nd day of release, that idiotic and it should have been a poll in the game.
---
what a joke. basilisk knights are already dead as shit, their drops are god awful save the jaw. Always halfwit mod team who just listen to a few people on twitter who do a single trip.
---
Why is that any better? Sounds like it just compounds the problem.
---
I just hit 70 RC and have no idea how to keep my sanity to 77. About 21 hours of ZMI and most of that time I'm on a PC with just one screen and no GPU draw distance extender (or on Mobile, same thing) Just gonna have to pepper an hour of ZMI every other day with some tears until I suddenly hit it
---
&gt; The response time for account security issues is a matter of minutes to hours, not days to weeks.
---
The age of less information tbh
---
Right now you just know most things by going on YouTube for a second or Google lol
---
basilisk has a weight of 8 and vanaka has a weight list of 392.  weight list divided by weighted number times 100% gets you your percentage.  without blocks that would be 4.9%, where do you get 2.2-2.7??  If anything blocks should increase the percentage by decreasing the weight list number.
---
Shouldn't supply and demand take care of gp/h (market situation is not perfect, but still)?
---
He literally turned from HCIM to pale iron man
---
Spec : Digs up 2 caskets
---
Alternative Spec : Tunnel out of deep wildy 
---
Also we obviously would need a gilded variant
---
Your artwork is amazing
---
i would rather runecraft for 100 hours than train thieving for 10 hours. that shit is so click intensive i think my carpal tunnel just got carpal tunnel
---
Black G was the real fashion shit tho
---
Is it worth using fire surge instead of a toxic trident at cave kraken for higher xp/hr? My magic is lacking far behind my other combat skills, so I really want to get it higher.
---
Me too. I was expecting it last year but they gave no new colors and when I asked people told me they hit some limit on skin colors. But then they polled like 4 new ones in that partnership poll, so clearly people were talking out their ass, as usual. I'm hoping for red or yellow. They polled orange and grey which I never thought about but those would be fun too.
---
That helm on a person who used their mums credit card would require a massive effort my dude
---
lol this is a render isnt it? fooled me until i read this comment ngl
---
its late, but goddamn really nice dude.
---
Looool
---
What I'm saying is you will get used to it and it won't be an issue after some more practice.
---
From vannaka it's 8/392 which is 2%ish assuming you haven't got his other tasks blocked.
---
If they had an 8 weighting from duradel it would be 8/296.or lower since I assume people's blocklist revolves around duradel.
---
Where do you get the 4.9% from? Not saying you're wrong in just curious
---
All of this
---
Pretty much no reason to max anything but the combat skills, since everything else generally stops around 90 at least with boosts, and thats already less than half of the way to 99 so you save a ton of time just stopping there
---
Maxing gets you the max cape which is bragging rights and combines a bunch of skill cape perks into it but that's hundreds of EHP to get that over just stopping at diary recs
---
You’re incredibly stupid if you don’t recognize how easy they are, they didn’t even need to look at any social platform for that feedback. And of course people aren’t going to vote against their own interests. If you gave people the option they’d vote to make half of the endgame content easier so they could get BIS gear. It’s a joke that the BIS helm comes from these in the first place but the fact they were so damn easy didn’t really help.
---
Time for game integrity changes huehue
---
This is absolutely golden, hopefully he keeps playing; and one day he’ll get nostalgic about a 4 chaos rune clue that took him almost an hour!
---
Pvp will stay dead as long as there is no ranking system for newbies. Sure you look cool doing 6 way 1 tick mage switches, but noobs getting slapped 20/20 times are gonna go back to pvm instantly. Thank jamflex for creating a wildernis where pvmers go to make money, so they downvote everything the pkers could use to kill them :)
---
Bonds lmao. No shame. Probably bought like 100 throughout the year.
---
He's made 3 posts...
---
You hear that in the distance? Sounds pretty weird. like the wambulance
---
don't they stack as you pick up more and more though ?
---
This is one of the best suggestions ive ever seen on this sub and the timing couldnt be better. Get this shit in game right now, tweet ash.
---
quite the opposite actually pkers want pkers in the wild but it being so neglected and getting hardly any updates its either focus pvmers an skillers or hop for 50 worlds eventually find a fight bank an hop another 50 worlds
---
RSN? if u have more than 10 kills ill give u an ags
---
You are comparing apples to oranges, our old BiS melee helm came from a boss that had a steep learning curve for most players.  Sitting afk praying mage shouldnt introduce a better helmet for a lower difficulty
---
Gotta catch 'em all
---
Deeper and deeper....
---
I've been told to kill myself more while killing abyss runecrafters than I have when being focused by clans/fighting other pkers
---
I don't know who you talk to or play with, but everyone I do is glad this game got changes and updates.
---
I'm so proud of this community.
---
You got the thing you grinded for, why should you get GP from it too?
---
Yes!! Now I'll have 17 more magic experience
---
BH kills or the KDA rate in wildy?
---
Tbf I actually do think korasi shouldnt come to osrs. But I guess for most people your comment is true.
---
That's because the Black Mask/Slayer Helm is a niche item that you can't use in most high level PvM.
---
i dont expect you to understand (not in a dickhead way) but its just different theres real risk and rush from actually getting kills deep wild. lms is fun for a few games a day jagex did a good job with that its pretty fun
---
Oh nice! I didn't know they were a beginner clue item. I'll be hunting that for the collection log for sure.
---
Oh of course, I forgot nobody does slayer.
---
Why?, it's fine where it is.

They flip a coin, heads it's a dodge mechanic, tails it's a 1 shot mechanic.  I guess the coin landed on heads this time.
---
Dude what about we sell exp directly to the players!
---
If anything he will aquire new followers doing a low level HCIM.
---
h
---
Fearmongering at its finest. Even Ash said on Twitter that he saw the plans through 2020 and said they looked fine if they could execute them. 
---
Jmods just aren’t paid enough to stick around forever.
---
i'm not a fan of having the jaw drop rate be higher on task, because then what's the purpose of killing them off task? take abby demons for example, you can get 85 slayer then chose to grind them off task or continue to get tasks and get your whip thru slayer. but now your essentially forcing ppl to kill basilisks/drakes/wyrms on task which i don't like. I'd rather have the choice without being punished
---
Are you the plague?
---
Oh damn bro you right. Gives me more time to play other games while also having solid xp gains
---
It’s a game, so I’m not too concerned with productivity lol
---
How many Slayer helms do you see at raids?
---
People attacking the polling system like this isn't what the community wants or what has been deemed the fair way of adding content. 
---
Polling systems suck and jagex should never have made the game based on letting people vote. 
---
That being said, this is the system the players chose.
---
True but holy heck is con tedious. 
---
Build dungeon door
---
Remove dungeon door
---
Occasionally ask your plank slave for things
---
Repeat 
---
At least with the other skills there’s more variety to the skilling and it’s not all in one place.
---
You still make a good point, some skills aren’t that rewarding that aren’t even fun
---
That Abby Dagger update would’ve been sweet! I don’t pk but would’ve gotten it for pvm :(
---
Lol that could be anyones kdr
---
It's not. The goal was to basically make budget tbow in some niche situations
---
I got one from a clue forever ago and kept it because it looks cooler to me than what it sells for. Might sell it tho.
---
I suppose one of the coins for vorkath landed on its side.
---
It's happened and that's how free trade was removed. You can't blame people for being people
---
CHIN LIVES MATTER
---
It could lol. A consequence though of not giving out my RSN is that I'm not going to be taking his AGS anyway ;)
---
Versus prayer flicking? What more do you guys want? It's a super simple game. Go to rs3 if you want engaging combat
---
Once turned in 5 keys and 4 yeiled Dragon Fruits. Nearly told konar to pull her pants down so I could suck that dick.
---
my vote was more centered around pvm, not pvp. people use looting bags to suicide at bosses and then camp them for hours. those people dont need 200 looting bags in their bank. they can walk to the guy and get one. pvp didnt even cross my mind when i voted no for this.
---
Clearly no bias in the fact the 1 item you get from PvM passes and anything PvP related fails
---
It really is impossible to please everyone on a topic like this. This is explicitly what part of the sub/twitter was asking for(while I assume the people here complaining now were content with how it was and *not* posting), but the other part has come out of the woodwork.
---
Even if you were spite-voting against pvp updates it makes no sense. Looting bag suicide is the meta for bosses like cerb now, so being able to buy multiple saves you from having to trade the BH guy every trip.
---
Funny how people now whine about the Basilisk Knights being too hard for a level 60 slayer monster, but no one bats an eye about the fact that they drop a BIS helmet. A level 60 slayer monster. From a master quest. Dropping a BIS helmet. The whole thing was stupid to begin with; this helmet upgrade should have been a raids 3 drop. It's silly seeing the best players in the game do ToB and CoX with a BIS item from a master quest. 
---
A BIS item should be hard to obtain. Stop whinging, either git gud or deal with it.
---
Just run away from it lol
---
Me redditor. Me think only twitter complain about things. Me ignore reddit quest release thread where everyone make fun of jagex for how afk basilisk are. Me very big brain redditor. Me intentionally leave out information and make shitty comparisons to be more dramatic crybaby. Me complain every monster not gargoyles me complained every monster is gargoyles. Why jagex make me actually look at game screen no fair &gt;:[
---
This is what all you idiots sound like.
---
Don't see where it says they are verified
---
I didn’t vote no but I wish Abby dagger was flipped around and had better stats
---
Tbh they were great for People with only slightly above 60 slayer who had the other quest reqs. Now with buffed HP/Deg they can only be killed in greater numbers by high levels. Those will not bother, since they can just farm Vork/Zulrah or raids instead for more profit and less gambling.
---
Yeah I know I’m just having trouble keeping concentration. One lapse and it’s all over.
---
I am just sad dagonhai is not locked behind some bigger content. #WGSdreams
---
They technically don't have to. The thing that Matt is trying to do is drag all of the clients in the mud by setting the precedent with his bad interpretation of the blog. So when it comes to plugins that weren't explicitly mentioned or even slightly referenced to if Runelite is still having some of these plugins he removed let's say 1 month from now he'll go in full reversal mode and start flaming the clients for not following Jagex have them get taken down or revert his changes to show that Jagex has no power over clients.
---
PvP weapons would probably pass if it’s from a slayer boss lol
---
New update didn't make them require any more attention, auto retaliate breaks you out. It simply made the task take slightly longer. Stupid change really.
---
If twitter and streamers had as much power as you think they do this game wouldnt be as shit as it is. Reddit is doing a better job killing this game than anyone else.
---
Fuck yeah
---
I have a clan also that do raids daily. anywhere from 1-3 groups going at once, or we do masses with the clan. CC name Horizon PVM, my IGN is Im intuit.
---
except Cerberus has a profitable average loot without it's unique, not to mention having way more unique than just one, same thing for GWD bosses, but those are a much higher requirement so i'm not sure why we are comparing them, a much more closer comparison could be skeletal wyverns or gargoyles, things that are constantly farmed for their good avg loot per kill.
---
Get yourself 99 con and crsfti g for unlimited bank/house teles!
---
If they add weed to the game I’ll come back
---
Who?
---
Is this their typical temperament?
---
I really don't think the dev team have put any thought into this, why would you release a new bis helm that is dropped from monster that req 60 slayer to kill and a couple of quests.  
---
lets look at what the req are to get bis drops from other bosses/monsters.
---
bis gloves requires 95 slayer, (only dropped from boss) and you need to have complete ds2 to craft them  
---
bis magic ammy requires 93 slayer.
---
bis boots(prims,pegs and eternal) require 91 slayer and only dropped by a boss.
---
100% ;)
---
then why bother even release them especially behind a master quest when they are not going to be worth it for anyone but ironmen and bots?
---
Can you pickup max cash stack if you have 1 gp in your inventory?
---
thanks for drawing this, I love it so much
---
Nah, just passively train your magic with bursting tasks, you’d be surprised how much do you can get from them. Also if you’re questing or skilling you can change to lunars and cast magic imbue every 12s I believe for some passive magic xp, it all adds up in the long run.
---
Rookie mistake. 😂
---
I would recommend lava's until 75 then do whatever method you feel like. 
---
They're not that bad if you're on resizable since you never have to move your screen.
---
fucking exactly! thank you!
---
Actually insane how only stuff that benefits non pvpers passes a pvp poll
---
So painfully true
---
But they're a 60 slayer monster... they're lower requirement than Dust Devils. They're not a demi boss or a farmable creature reward from a grandmaster (like gorillas for example). They're simply a level 60 slayer creature that was semi-worth killing, now is even slower.
---
I'm missing the joke?
---
Comparing a boss to a level 60 slayer monster after saying someone else is comparing apples to oranges.
---
&gt; Okay.jpg
---
Spite voters gonna spite vote. Games going to shit, and going to shit fast. It's obvious anything PVP related gets voted no and anything PVE and PVM gets yes voted. Sort this mess out Jagex.
---
Fighting people who aren't necessarily geared the same as you is fundamental to the design of the wilderness. do you think people really gave a shit about whether or not their opponent could fairly fight back in 2007? 
---
Elvemage killed random green drag killers in his most famous PK videos. The lawlessness and food-chain nature of the Wilderness is its appeal. It's why stuff thats a bit more sterile and contained in nature like LMS doesn't have as much appeal for some people.
---
Yeah this might be the dumbest comment in the thread
---
It... it still is a pray mage afk monster. The mechanic does nothing but slow the kills/hr, which just hurts gp/hr more and does nothing to make the monster interesting, difficult, or better to do.
---
Nor should it need to be... its a lvl 60 slayer creature.
---
I'm well aware. Already well integrated into Discord for when it finally does.
---
...yes
---
"I was fighting people who didn't want to fight and they told me to fuck off"
---
Gee, I wonder why
---
they're literally a farmable creature reward from a master quest
---
The implication is that if you have "only" 1 kc, you must have bought the cape. It's unlikely anyone would need to buy the cape multiple times, so people expect you to have a kc greater than 1 to "prove" you didn't buy the cape. Utter nonsense.
---
They simply can't.
---
is tormented bracelet a joke to you?
---
Yeah from those pictures it looks like that but i watches the clip a few times and yeah... never seen anything like that
---
What... are you even saying...?
---
Torvesta borrows almost all the accounts you see him using other than his main and maybe 2/3 other accounts overall
---
That realisation of “it’s over”
---
haha yeah I have 3 skills left to max; RC, mining and agility, so I just cycle through each of them as I get bored but I find agility more bearable than the others :p
---
Jagex prefers tradable items to let players feel good about getting a big ticket drop and selling it for loads of money.
---
I had literally zero clue that Knights were getting buffed until someone in my CC mentioned it. So dumb.
---
The problem I see with that is lots of PVP content/updates affect everyone
---
Whereas LMS, bounty hunter, and PVP world's I'd be absolutely happy with you doing anything you wanted and I think that's fair game but where it affects other types of players they should get a vote.
---
Just my opinion no hard feelings 🙂
---
gmaul in general is a pvp weapon, which, as you know, already comes from gargs + GG, even before the change with the ornate handle. in this case, why not? it fits thematically at least
---
Yeah lets just ignore how OP all of the PvP equipment is aside from Zurials staff
---
Quit your bitching
---
They are doing it on purpose. Basically the definition of if I can't have it then you can't either mentality.
---
All RNG. Got two basilisk tasks in 4-5 tries at Duradel.
---
I thought there was a dodge mechanic. Wtf is everyone complaining about then.
---
Personally i don't see why you should make a 60 slayer monster hard or difficult compared to every other slayer monster aside from brand new ones like Hydras.. which are what.. 95 slayer?
---
They consume a bunch of prayer potions and food, and offer little to no gp/hr. The safespot nerf was good, as otherwise people will just infinitely camp with ranged alts. 
---
They won't keep their value forever, thats a fact of supply and demand. Their requirements are easy, so if they're worthwhile to do, people will do them / alt them. And then the item drops until its not that worhtwhile to do, and thats where it will sit (i assume ~8m like the gloves).
---
yeah because there wasn't anything worthwhile to do in the wildy for normal people.
---
Except they didn't. They specifically said that any entity swapping is bannable. If they wanted it to only be for higher complexity, more unfair actions they would have specified that, but they didn't. They specified all entity swapping is against tos.
---
So yes, left click to bank = ban
---
They made them tankier AND buffed them to 300hp? That’s fucking ridiculous. I’m sorry.
---
Not if you don't instance it
---
Nice obby cape my dude
---
You can dodge it. It freezes you in place, you miss 1 or 2 attacks depending on weapon, and basilisk gets one hit in you. But your auto retal breaks you out of it, which might not be intended as it completely negates it being an "anti-afk" measure.
---
You're just retarded. Did it in one try with welfare gear. It's a hard boss, don't get me wrong, but not something that should kill you 3+ times.
---
A fucking swift bonk on the head with the accompanying BOOOONG.
---
Jad himself won't be an issue, but some of the earlier waves might be a challenge, particularly the ones with rangers, mages, and meleeers. Important to know how to safespot so you don't get torn up.
---
Yes and faceguard is easier to get, keeps it balanced.
---
Jagex cant make the slayer level higher or the big brain 1200 total redditors would complain they're only catering to twitter.
---
Uhh guys maybe we should avoid complaining about basic combat mechanics
---
When a new +1 str item comes out in the future your points don't stand. New helm is objectively the best option everywhere as soon as strength stats increasing again.
---
These “rules” are from 2001. Times change. People change. Rules change. Yet somehow the most essential parts of the osrs client are still missing. Why the fuck does a popular game in 2019 STILL doesn’t support any type of GPU support? Why is everything ran off of 1 CPU core? Why is flash still a thing? Why is the OFFICIAL OSRS client a minority compared to runelite/osbuddy? Because it’s complete and utter dogshit and it takes months/years for the 2 1/2 developers that work for Jagex (which I have no idea why they work there, they get paid literal shit compared to others in their field) to implement changes requested by the community. 
---
Just because they are the “rules”, doesn’t mean they are correct. 
---
Now, I’m not saying 1 click automation is correct whatsoever. Fuck this 1 click on the same tile bullshit. No one enjoys it. But at the same time, the changes that Runelite has brought have modernized OSRS a bit.
---
Yeh exactly. I reckon the weighting is probably similar across the board but people with different experiences and luck spread it like gospel and it gets chewed up and regurgitated as fact.
---
its not worth wasting that much time tryirng to find a world. in the end its only 25k.
---
It is a good thing that it did take a shitty turn. Coming back to it with a  5-6 year break renewed the nostalgia and let me get my life together before being sucked in again.
---
im pretty mad, i wasted 1900 points plus unlock/extend and not one fucking task. now their buffed and not worth doing at all? for like 3k loot, im not doing a 3 hour task for like 600k gp.
---
Not everyone is unlucky enough to go 1.7k dry either
---
Dang this is awesome
---
Why would a master quest reward thats a harder version of a level 40 slayer monster need to be higher...?
---
The new slider for minimum dead zone... is this supposed to move the panels on the side of the screen (inventory, levels, prayer tabs) further out towards the edges of the devices screen? I logged in mobile to mess with it and nothing changes when I move the slider.
---
&gt;"We want it like God Wars, a very scarce drop-table with a high value rare reward"
---
Yes, please, keep doing this. Fuck Moneysnake/dragon shitting out such consistent high drops, AND Moneysnake having multiple uniques too.
---
And rough
---
Gonna take my chances dawg
---
Hydra Hasta item when
---
I need to ask, what is sliilgvhetr
---
(Sorry, had to do this)
---
You want the content in the wildy, you gotta be prepared to take the risk of another player attacking you.
---
You're not FORCED to use that content, nor are you particularly required too. It is a choice you've made.
---
What is it?
---
This sub had a massive rage boner against the new mage robes with excuses like how it will make it easier for pvpers to freeze them yet it passed cuz it's obtainable via slayer. Devs can disguise these pvp weapons as a slayer reward and it would pass no problem
---
You seem to be knowledgeable about this. How do you choose between dragonstone bolts and opal bolts?
---
The blowpipe is mostly used for bossing and high level PvM as the cost of the blowpipe is like 1m/h. Revenants is also popular for the blowpipe, but regular slayer you should not be using the blowpipe for.
---
I only died once the first time, but when I went back to make an rda, I died like five times.
---
I'm assuming something about demonic gorillas? If so, an easier quest requirement? That guy's an idiot and that might be how they actually converse with people.
---
I’m fine with the extra attack, even with upping their non-crush defense to encourage attacking their weakness. But pushing an already very tanky monster to even higher defense and higher HP? That’s a bit wild.
---
They are stronger than most other slayer monsters. Dust devil at 65 is twice that at a much faster pace.
---
That’s not fighting people of the same skill level though? Where’s the fun in fighting something that’s not even a person? The main objective of a bot is to run away. It’s not PvP.
---
Correct. To finish up 99 Con with the left-click plugin, download OpenOSRS (formerly known as RuneLite+). They still have the left-click Con plugin.
---
Yeh idk how he thinks DS2 is an easier req than Exiles lol.
---
&gt;eat less to not have fat fingers
---
# It's big brain time
---
Reading must be awfully hard eh? First off - there is nothing difficult about the clue step. There are no level reqs, no quests, nothing. Also I'm not complaining about the time taken itself to find another person. Its the principal that other clue steps that could take several minutes at least you are engaged with the GAME and doing something, vs fucking standing around begging someone to waste their time to hop into a duel with you. If you dont see the difference then you're a fool. Asking them to change or remove the step is not being pampered in any way, so nice try at a "omg u jus want ezscape!#@" comment. Not to mention I've advocated against the idiotic ideas made by people on this sub to change the game to ezscape. 
---
This is a single fucking clue step. It wont have any effect on the market, literally ANYTHING other than if it got changed you would actually be doing something in the game and interacting with the game world. 
---
Also I dont need someone whose probably 21 talking about "this generation" when you got a ways to go, seeing how you probably grew up with flatscreens and HD. Please use some sort of intellect next time you decide to make a generic as fuck comment when no ones asking for something "easier" when first off, if you think standing around wasting time typing to other players to come help you is some sort of "difficulty" then you've probably never played a game that doesnt have a big fucking green arrow telling you where to go, what to do, what buttons to press, etc. 
---
My god its not that hard of a concept. Clue steps like the hot and cold, or go fish "x of x" or dance atop the agility pyramid actually make you DO something. This is the ONLY STEP that requires another human to complete, if they had dozens of similar steps then ok cool theyre pushing clues to be a group activity. But there is one. And it doesnt fit. Its about as dumb as your shitty comment about being entitled. Yeah, so entitled because pointing out the one clue step that is different from the hundreds of others that requires no skills, items or quests. Makes a lot of fucking sense huh? What entitlement! How dare I ask for a more engaging clue scroll step that actually fits the fucking agenda of clues. 
---
The amount of dipshits these days
---
Are you actually stupid? Learn to read.
---
yes ignore my other points, besides i'd argue 99 fishing is easier to get than 96 ranged.
---
Just wait until he gets nothing but cabbages
---
&gt;Gorillas have no slayer req
---
You need 69 slayer to do the quest therefore 69 slayer to do gorillas
---
Your points stand nonetheless tho
---
Like the poor kid on here the other day who said “I’m not doing ToB anymore since scythe is “only” 600m now”
---
Its still afk, the spec is broken by just having autoretaliate on.
---
Quest my dude!
---
Look up the achievement diaries on the wiki, pick an easy diary and go complete all the tasks. Repeat for all of the other areas. And then move your way up to medium, and hard.
---
By the time you're doing elite, you've just about got through the real tutorial ;)
---
I don't think you know what Pures actually use. Just because they have access to it doesn't mean they use it.
---
You can talk all you want about theoretical BIS pure weapons but no pure is using a scythe along with their black dhide chaps and monk robe top lol
---
People think he’s being dramatic but if Osbuddy has to remove these features then so does RL. Ground overlays, left click talk to banker and half of these other things on the list are QOL.
---
20% of voters justify their answers as ‘I don’t like pvp’ that’s a serious problem that’s needs to be addressed now.
---
You should only be able to vote on pvp related polls once you’ve attained a certain bounty hunter score. If you don’t participate in pvp, your opinion is not valid or wanted, just keep tic fishing and stfu.
---
If pvp got somewhat frequent updates through polls like everyone else, then all of these measures you mention wouldn't be needed in the first place.
---
What are you talking about? Jagex has given clear guidelines and all these plugins violate those guidelines. Nothing dramatic about it.
---
Don’t even joke about it.
---
Inc 98 rc
---
I mean at least you can afk safespot with range.
---
VOTE NO FOR PVP BUT VOTE YES FOR NOTED DROPS CUZ IM A IRONMAN! RADA RADA RADA I GOT PKED FOR A SPADE O
---
Dis you think she especially made them for you?
---
"It makes you come off as a massive snarky, high-horse asshat"
---
He has max cape, infernal cape and an ironmeme account, and spends 90% of his Q&amp;A time shooting down anything affecting metas. Ask yourself, do you really think he cares?
---
Couldn't even survive a full week.
---
&gt; Very high level BIS items, like tier 75 gear, 100% should drop from bosses or tough/high-level monsters.
---
That's like, your opinion man.
---
Why not introduce these pvp items, well I don't know... a pvp world? The whole idea of the wilderness and locking clues, training methods, slayer bosses etc behind it, just to have a full clan come and kill me 10v1 really makes me want to downvote any pvp related buffs.. The thought of 10 idiots with Zuriels and VLS sitting at Chaos Elemental for a 100k drop split between 10 people  is silly to me. Pvp worlds are 10x better for the state of pvp because the wilderness for the most part is just toxic clans ruining PVMers slayer task by logging in under them after being scouted by a level 3 alt..
---
Players who enter the wilderness to PVM are putting themselves at risk of being PKed, participating in PVP, and have every right to vote in PVP polls.
---
Your problem is you define PVPers as only those who do the killing, and ignore those being killed. It takes two to tango.
---
Would love this to happen
---
11$
---
Oh shit it will remember casts now too  with the memorising attack styles/spells between weapon switches. Didn't even think of that
---
Long time PvMer here - trying to get into some PVP recently. I hate how the PvP updates are always trashed because of PvMers who don't want to give any more advantages to the PvPers. Example of this was the bounty hunter imbues (how that didn't pass I don't know!) 
---
Personally I love the fact that quests/clues/content ensure that the wildy is visited by all players. Otherwise what is the point in it?
---
Im not sure if my viewpoint is fair, but I would personally make pvp related update polls require a slightly less percentage to pass. E.G. 65%-70% rather than 75%. My logic behind this is that the pvp community is far smaller than the PvMers and skillers so they can effectively veto any changes with ease.
---
You can't keep voting down something just because you don't want to do it yourself (that's my view anyway)
---
just poll all updates it isnt hard jagex its what ur success is founded on. or u can kill the game again and keep pushing the limit until ppl get mad.
---
I'm 55 and I play runescape with my mom every single day. We just finished bandos but now it's time for bed. We both collect disability, but hers is worse because shes older.
---
I voted against it as i feel they are a big powerful upgrade. so being able to have multiple was crazy for me. I feel like you should be lugging around loot in your inventory to make the risk vs reward a bit bigger, picking what item to keep and what to leave on the ground is a big part. You could be caught by a team whilst fucking about dropping shit. So take your looting back at your own risk! Subsequently I voted against lower drop rates for it, but alas that passed.
---
Might as well update the graphics while they are implementing combat evolved
---
&gt;That's like, your opinion man.
---
Yes, you may disagree with me on this if you wish.
---
I agree 100%. But if they were officially declared to be against the rules, I would learn to live without them. My continuation of playing the game wouldnt hinge on something that, as you said, doesn't make a huge difference in gameplay. My point is that I see a lot of people on these posts saying they would quit if they couldnt use plug-ins A B or C. I would hope that the player base would have more of a love for this game than to drop it over something so trivial.
---
Holy shit, they've made the chinchompa into a real thing.
---
Agree.  This seemed like a great med level slayer monster- similar to cave horrors.  But one where you have to pay attention instead of going full afk like every other option at med slayer level.
---

---
sure but imbued heart and most slayer monster drops are decent, this one on the other hand is a relatively tanky monster that has garbage loot on average with one single redeeming drop that's very rare.
---
Only you wouldn't see the cashstack because you logged in after it was dropped

---
The sextant doesnt give you the location, you already have the location and the co ordinates. The sextant just helps you get to the location that you have been given by the clue so you could google the spot and click the sextant... have you ever used it?
---
The extended range is fine but I'd rather see a buff to the special attack so its not just another weapon you use to poke with after gmaul specing instead of a straight stat buff.
---
Ah yes, I'm sure the money and technology isn't there yet.
---
Same here on Note 8. It's back to where it was before last week's update with no effect of the slider at all
---
Honestly they should double the drop rate of everything but the jaw as well to compensate. Would make the jaw harder to get like people wanted, while not making the task absolute trash if you don't get one.
---
I'm 55 and this made me laugh
---
I will pipe up here and say as a pker i voted no. Not because "pvp update reeeee" but because looting bags are pretty powerful.
---
Yeah that's what happens when you make the NPC easy as fuck.
---
You want value and you want easy mechanics? Lol
---
Hmmmmm how about zulrah
---
Can I ask you what exactly did they change? I can't go online today.
---
Actually excited for this. I love Diablo/PoE seasonal modes, hope this scratches the same itch.
---
why is this not being polled?
---
then don't blame if pvm'ers vote in their own best interest. Pvm'ers are getting lured by high gp/hr and BIS items that drop from PVM content. ironman can't buy them, so why would they vote for something that makes their playtime less enjoyable?
---
Depends how casual you're talking an hour a day? Then probably, if you're okay with seeing slow progression and not bothered about end game, then play, but if you want to see yourself progress and reach rewarding goals then the game is a heavy time sink.
---
I have no problem with wyrms.. dhcb rips through so hard.. never done drakes
---
IMO this way more interesting than DMM. Hope it does well.
---
As you run through the chaos altar into the wildy, thats fair. But I don't think pvm slayer was the right way to do this. Larrans keys should have dropped randomly from players once you killed them. Not just from wildy slayer...
---
Needless to say the devs at OSBuddy are being childish and dramatic to drive home their point and instigate further angst in the 3pc using player base. Most of what they put in that post will not be pursued as bannable.
---
Yeah but you can't really blame em can you
---
!sticky
---
Got one on 600ish kc :$
---
I voted yes because it gives people the option to. I personally don't like em but i'm not gonna say no cause I don't want it.
---
Wish pvm voters did this....
---
Yah. I meant use the sextant until it gives you the same coord as on the clue; i.e. the dig location. When the sextant matched the clue, it would log the location in the book/map.
---
Nah, the free to play thing  is part of the challenge
---
Defo didnt misunderstand. I voted no.
---
I think it was the karamja gloves version of saying "nice cape"
---
I honestly didn’t see any posts about how easy there were care to point 1 out ?
---
Players with maxed stats and maxed gear: REEEEEEEEE TOO EASY REEEEEEEEE
---
Players with 60 slayer after killing 2-3 basilisks: Aight, I'mma head out.
---
I replied directly from the notification I had, so didn't see the edit
---
There is a grace period for editing for typos etc
---
I feel looting bags are pretty strong, I miss the days of juggling stuff. So I feel even 1 looting bag is enough.
---
It has bad stats because they didn't want anyone to complain about powercreep.
---
 The first rendition had significantly better defensive stats. However, everyone complained because Jagex did a terrible job at explaining how hard it was to get, so they took everyone's criticism at face value and made it useless.
---
Yeah and it's still 2 styles farmable boss with more hp so you can't farm the unique super fast
---
Wyrms are just a tedious and long last that I have blocked so another free block would be lovely and same I have never done drake's but from what I hear they're pretty much the same
---
ok but birdhouses were actually OP
---
i voted yes for them all specifically cuz i dont want to get pked. give pkers weapons to pk each other. dumb cunts voting no dont have any idea what the yare doing. all we had to do was have them not be available outside the wild. fuck i was hoping theyd work on wilderness npcs so  theyd have more value for pkers
---
Does the freeze do no damage?
---
Because most OSRS players are broke as shit, to the point where they spend hours grinding out a $7 bond.
---
As leagues are it's own separate game mode, we are not polling it. However we are going to poll any rewards which make it to the main game, as you can see in the blog post
---
Jagex needs to stop updates to please a couple of Reddit neckbeards. They DON'T represent the entire community.
---
Things are fine the way it is.
---
We do have a common enemy. We (the majority playerbase) know what we want out of OSRS now, and fundamentally wasting dev resourced on shitty PVP updates that will be dead content in under 6 months gets in the way of what we want.
---
Not to mention slayer helm is used everywhere on task, except for times when void is better anyway. This is the BiS melee DPS helmet *when not on a slayer task.* It's actually a pretty niche BiS, in my opinion.
---
Didn’t beat my well known 15000 dry streak so sit
---
Sure its enforceable if you want to wipe out half the player base.
---
If all 3pc were banned and there was no established plan to significantly buff their own client, yes I would probably quit. But that would largely be due to the client itself running smoother and more reliably than vanilla on my pc, not necessarily a handful of specific plug-ins.
---
Yeah stupid low level players, why not just get maxed like the rest of us? /s
---
It's a joke. Don't think about it too much.
---
Best advice for an ultimate ironman. 
---
Don’t do it.
---
The last time someone tried the Wildy disappeared.
---
&gt;Way better to just assume the worst out of people though.
---
The lack of response or "edit:" on top of the edit asterisk by your comment drove me to that assumption, can never be sure about what the truth is on reddit tho
---
&gt;Also, TIL there's a certain delay where it doesn't say the post was edited? Why?
---
Yeah its 2 minutes, I assume the idea is for fixing typos and the likes
---
*Absolutely* voting no on main game rewards.
---
I absolutely agree. I get that not everyone wants to have rare items be the only way to profit, but it's both exhilarating to finally get said rare items, and the only way to keep prices high on good gear. If you don't want to farm rare items, you have plenty of options already with vorkath, gargoyles, rune dragons, etc.
---
Having a balance of types of drop tables means that everyone has an option for the style of content they want.
---
Right which makes it pointless since you dont actually have to use it to find it, so again therea no way the game can tell if you googled it or used it legit so pointless
---
Makes sense, then it's run ecrafting. That's what rcing is
---
I think they were fine as they were for the amount of effort you had to put into killing them. One task with the bracelet of slaughter(around 320 kc) took my several hours and multiple trips with prayer restore and high healing food. Besides the 1 basilisk jaw I received the loot table was pretty trash.
---
I was gonna do the quest today... not anymore
---
The shortcut is a reward for completing the diary. It is meant to be valuable and not easy to get.
---
The shortcuts did not exist before the diaries were added
---
Then explain why zenytes still hold a ton of value today?
---
When will twisted leagues come out? Very excited for this!
---
Tooo op
---
Nearly 20% coming up saying nah pvp is bad. What they really meant was “this is what you guys get for voting no on new skills then saying sit when I do my clue”
---
The rewards that carry over to the main game are super cool, but should honestly not be tradable. Isn't the whole point of them to be able to flex that you participated in a league? If they are tradable that will only be the case for ironmen.
---
Literally just sit in mmz lol or level through slayer and such. Why the fuck is he 75 att and def and complaining? How am I even getting downvoted for this ?? Lmaooo
---
Wow, this is very encouraging
---
I dont know how i feel about tradeable rewards transferring into  the main game.  It basically creates ultra rares that could be worth absurd amounts, and if they give up on leagues, there will be a finite amount of them in the game forever.  
---
That slayer helm recolor is fucking dope tho
---
I can't wait to play as Master Chief in RuneScape
---
Im incredibly hyped for this but have one complaint. If i want the rewards in my ironman i have to basically give up main game progress. I can’t make an alt to get the points for my iron or just buy them with cash. Would it be possible to link a second account to my iron so that it (my iron linked to this secondary account) can use the points in the main game u/jagexacorn this way, like a main, irons don’t have to give up main game progress to get these rewards. Mains can make alts to play and trade the main their rewards
---
It's just as enforceable. Jagex is actively fighting RWTers but can't do it effectively because the ones profiting off it can go under the radar with ease. No different to the war on drugs.
---
If you have some innovative way to ban all RWTers then let jagex know. You're solution would help them a lot...... for a few days at least, until the RWTers find a way to get around it again.
---
RWT has been jagex's biggest battle for the last 20 years. It resulted in the removal of the wilderness, free trade, etc. It has caused WAAAAAY more damage than anything else. They aren't ignoring it.
---
Football players get CTE, tennis players get tennis elbow, dota players get depression. Suffer for your hobby.
---
Negative feedback
---
Don’t do it then? You could do construction 15 minutes a day and be done in a month? Nobody’s forcing you.
---
do we need a separate account or is it just a separate world like DMM
---
Yeah, I'm one of them. Your community is shit and I'm getting back for all the times I've seen famous PKers gathering all their friends, fans, and alts to mass vote no to PVMing/skilling content. Sucks to suck bud
---
Lots of crying in this thread
---
He's right though, it's too easy to obtain. BiS melee helm that adds a max hit over serp helm. Instead of doing 512 click intensive zulrah kills (unless you have tbow), you do 1k basilisk kills either afk or prayer flick them. Not only do you have a better max hit, it's also undegradeable and doesn't cost a shitton in scales to use. If it were obtained through a slayer boss like cerb I'd understand, even though I don't think it should have a higher str bonus than serp helm either way, but literally every other BiS items require some form of engagement (except for slayer helm and occult necklace).
---
Overlooking is the key to it. I thought about the fact that it's a continent and a lot of time will be spent standing still. I thought about arrows primarily, but thinking about saving 80% of the runes, yeah that's pretty good. Dark altar is geared to help you get prayer high and early, abyssal ammo is gonna be strong for range/mage troughout and endless endurance will be great value overall.
---
I'm the opposite , I tend to play Pretty casually  with Netflix , TV on in the background maybe a podcast 
---
Got runelite and it didn't change my playstyle whatsoever 
---
Still tend to avoid high xp / click intensive methods over chill ones even with my xp per hour shown 
---
To me it's just been handy to have all the extra information . Loot tracker , xp per Hour and potion information 
---
I could play vanilla , but man what a boot in the nuts.
---
I see PvP and I instantly vote no. :)
---
The general is known for that, all the guy does is complain about something and tries to start a shit wave on twitter all the time and threatening to leave the game as soon as something is not in his best interest, like the recent client drama
---
Looks great but locking it behind a game mode is just dumb. It should be a rare drop from olm or some other cox drop. 
---
Thematically that makes zero sense. If the game mode itself isnt enough to entice people to play it then it shouldnt be a thing period.
---
Newer player asking, what’s BIS?
---
I mean, if you played in the previous league, I can see how getting a lesser-populated world for you to compete in, in the next league, could be a lucrative reward. 
---
That said, it kinda feels like it gives previous league players too much of an advantage over the next league. 
---
Idk. Maybe it won't. 
---
I guess we'd have to see some data for it.
---
tbh i'm surprised its not classed as an untradeable that needs repairing to use/access any loot in there again. that'll be next
---
What a poopy head
---
Only if you're stupid enough to try and buy a code from someone else.
---
Where can I find people complaining.... this update is fucked. Literally losing interest in this game by the week
---
&gt; Master: 2277 Total Level 
---
Getting some 99s at Zeah will be extremely frustrating like Agility without courses and reaching to 77 Runecrafting.
---
How can you tell without knowing the 12 other relics?
---
But then "its ded content" and reddit would call it a waste of developers time...
---
OMG 6 entire range pots for a while task?! That’s fucking nuts!
---
itswill_rs is usually a very fun stream
---
nah
---
This. This sub is dumb af, its life span is literally just people finding something to bitch about until the jmods finally notice, get it changed, then they move on to something else to complain about, and it all starts over again. With some overused memes inserted in random places. Everyone wants everything to be nerfed so that their achievements in a game they've played most of their lives might actually mean something. Runecraft training for example: it's practically an unwritten rule that adding something to make it more entertaining or even a tiny bit faster is absolutely forbidden, else the sub will fucking riot, why? Because it'll devalue those rc capes. But ya know, "rc bad". There's lots of other examples, but that one is the most obvious. I'm quite sure I'm gonna get heavily downvoted for this, because people seem to think that downvoted=untrue.
---
This is why skip question exists though. That is what I do at least.
---
I replied to this above, hopefully it makes sense
---
&gt; So we see this feedback a lot and here's my thoughts on it.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If it's untradeable then you only get them on your alt unless you pause all main-game progress which a lot of people won't like. Most people are going to like the rewards being tradeable so they can do this. Ironman accounts are hard done by this, there's no way around it though we don't have the tech to let you log in to more than one world at once.
---
&gt; Also, there are benefits to being tradeable. They will be rather expensive when the league ends and everyone gets them and people get to feel like they earned something which helps their main account progress.
---
&gt; And finally, we do want a way to show off your progress in the league, this is why the trophies are untradeable. Each league the logo will change so if you want that prestigious dragon trophy, better play and get it!
---
&gt; Hopefully this means the rewards have something for everyone :)
---
Is castle wars f2p?
---
I figured just based on where it was on the map it couldnt be
---
Except for trophies. Acorn said that trophies are untradable and exclusive to that "season"
---
I’ve suggested it before and will suggest it again. Have an option to enable double click acting as a right click.
---
I'm in the beta but it isn't hard to find the files if you really wanted them. I believe the beta still has a device check tho so if you don't have a supported phone model you might still be SOL
---
Long term pvmer.
---
Option 3 is the only option that isn't ridiculous. Lock op pvp weapons to pvp and BH worlds.
---
IMO the wilderness is at a fairly decent level currently in terms of pkers vs pmers. Lots of chances to escape, lots of chances to pk. Risk is equal to the reward.
---
Like if you currently can't kill the majority of pvmers, even in charity gear, you're not very good.... The only way you'll get the op BH rewards is if they're tradeable or you bot your way to them if that's the case....
---
Library Books award RC exp, actually it's a meta method for UIM pre-77 for Bloods
---
I love getting back at the Pking community by voting no. You guys all come out in droves when it's pvming/skilling updates, so enjoy the payback bud.
---
Because its good game design. The next best helm is easy and free, while you pay/or grind an absurd amount only for slightly better gear
---
Well then maybe if players would vote based on what benefits the game as a whole rather than them personally, then these discussions wouldn't be necessary.
---
No
---
Biggest problem I foresee is people finding sneaky ways to escape the island. Sounds like a brilliant ltm idea though
---
Yikes.
---
Finally a Reddit opinion I can agree with.
---
Could we have a rought ETA of when we could expect to see this in game?
---
Ah yep good catch. But that one shouldn’t be tradeable anyway imo
---
This comment section is concerning.
---
I skill and pvm a lot dude. Im right around 2k total. I enjoy all aspects of the game.
---
How many 99s do u need to get to a 2200 world?
---
rewards from outside the main game entering the main game? thats a big no from me. otherwise looks cool
---
RNG master tasks seem annoying, imagine never getting that skilling pet
---
I mean it's not up to Sick nerd on how Jagex changed them. He offered constructive criticism, he didn't know Jagex would blow their load so early.
---
F
---
I imagine many players will feel lost in the beginning, and that's a part of the fun with Leagues! New rules, new challenges and new goals to achieve. Happy you're excited!
---
Love Adam but he is an insufferable fuck at times. Breaks my heart
---
Lol I hope your day gets better friend. Breathe

#swampleticsbutkourendletics
---
Interestingly enough Iron's can pick up the bones from other player deaths and they can also pick up ashes from fires other players lit.
---
This looks so fun, can't wait. The cosmetic rewards are all pretty on point too.
---
As a PKer I vote no everytime, as it seems to be the only to get JaGex to force changes against the will of the playerbase who only slay in this game.
---
I've been playing my account fairly often (definitely not addicted, definitely playing for fun as opposed to maxing) for about 3 years and I cant beat Vorkath, so I doubt people are just picking up the game and immediately grinding their hearts out in order to afford bonds from bossing. Obv there are people that do that, but I'm talking from the perspective of the average casual gamer.
---
Getting spite voted by players who never pvp isn't right either. The polling system needs to be reworked for pvp.
---
Im confused why they didnt wait till runefest to announce this. Wonder what wonderful things runefest holds for us
---
Oh yeah let me wear Slayer Helm to Zulrah/Vorkath/Callisto/Vene/Vetion/Chaos Elemental/Revenants/MA2 bosses/Barrows/Saradomin/Bandos/Corp.
---
Niche.
---
Although yes I do admit 60 slayer is way too low for them, should be increased.
---
He didn't, but ok
---
Wow I had no idea that this wasn’t even the last one, that makes all of this infinitely more retarded.
---
Starting to believe there’s a reason why so many mods are leaving and they’re unable to say anything because of an NDA.
---
Me too!
---
The rewards should be prestige and not buyable
---
The d wants what the d wants
---
I have literally 0 interest in pvp, I've been doing mage arena and wildy diaries regardless and I think got pk'd 3 times. Its annoying as hell but it happens. Only other time I got killed was someone thinking I was an abyss bot but he gave me my stuff back. I still vote yes for the content that I think benefits the game but I think we need to find a compromise that please both parties I just don't know what that is
---
Best in slot
---
how would someone get 2277 total in 2 months lol? you should try be more realistic creating tasks. even with a boosted xp rate, no one would get 2277 total in 2 months
---
Was it Shakira?
---
so cool
---
I think bh/pvp worlds is the only place where it would work as well. The only change I feel would be needed is an MMR system to match you with other players, everything else can stay the same. I don’t think smurfing would be a major problem because $11
---
K.. Now add 3 kids... Boom.. Max in 6 years
---
No ava's device was mentioned in the blog. That will make raids a little difficult and lizardmen kind of annoying. Any thoughts?
---
People would pay absurd amounts for status symbols like home teles or house themes if they're rare enough. You can sure as hell bet that if there's only 100 of those in game then every person with 10b+ is going to be fighting over them, driving up the price
---
Clearly we should buff Abyssal Demons then
---
What about boaty? Watched his stream only a few times, but he sounded ok
---
This is to good
---
Looting bag suicide is meta for bosses like Cerberus and Kalphites Queen. This makes it harder to do that quickly since you'll have to spend at least 30 seconds reobtaining one for every trip.
---
I personally voted no because I don't want it to become easier for people to abuse looting bags for these purposes by making them available en masse via a banked stash.
---
I mean if you don’t get the kill within your spec window the other guy is not going to die? Wth are you even talking about. You ain’t killing anyone without specs on the 50 attack bracket as a gmauler. 
---
You are not an obby to chance someone with a big hit, you don’t have the luxury of a range to godsword smack, you don’t even have vengeance if you were a low lvl voider or a low lvl zerk. Get real, if both specced there is no point. 
---
Btw you can’t spec insta tab anymore anyways 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Completely agree, hopefully next season isn't so weird and more if not all of the game is opened up. Still very easy to make the gameplay unique without area locking. The area locked ruleset just makes the gameplay a bit too odd and slow. Everyone likes watching swampletics but no one wants to spend the amount of time playing his way. With these area locked iron man modes the exp multiplier has to be pretty high if theres going to be more than a handful of people who play the duration of 2 months.
---
I still can’t get over how stupid that staff looks lmao. The bat shouldn’t be pretty much as big as the player. Would look so much better if the bat was half that size
---
My point is really that the new faceguard isn't the super powerful BiS that needs to be end game, max-combat content. 
---
Almost all my combat is slayer, and I'm not Mr. EHP at all. The new Nezzy is basically the minimal improvement of could have been, and the Justiciar, Verac, and Serp helmets all have legitimate applications. 
---
Slayer helm is still much better at Zamorak GWD, for example. The faceguard is probably BiS Raids, max strength PvP,  and maybe Bandos GWD? I'm willing to be wrong, but I think simply stating "it's BiS" isn't true to life. It's BiS, sometimes and never while on a slayer task.
---
If you're using divines maybe. Otherwise you're 100% wrong. What if you brew? What if you don't have all bis? What if you're a scrub with only a fire cape? Doesn't apply if you're being cheap on potions or or pking hybrid style. If you want to be just as tanky you could easily swap tassets for legguards and have even more prayer bonus. Prayer &gt; some random venom damage. 
---
The only thing that saves this item is it's high cost to entry, but that won't last long it'll be down to 6-8mil eventually. And it probably won't stop dropping since the reqs are so low.
---
Will 3rd party client be disallowed?
---
best in slot
---
Its not like you can't have a fun time with another guy.
---
I'm always impressed with these. What guide did you use?
---
This is said before, have to say it again: Twitter is mostly shit. Most of the people there are shit, who can't do anything but spout political drivel and searching for ways to ruin another person's life.
---
At this point I think 4chan feels like a more welcoming place than Twitter.
---
The new quest I'm pretty sure is just experienced level btw.
---
Looks pretty good, and rewards aren't too much. I like.
---
2 months seems like a lot, feels like most will get burnt out long before then, and even the most dedicated will either achieve their goals before then, or give up.
---
Maybe something more like 1 month, or may be 6 weeks? Still plenty of time for us casuals to get our fill, and for the hardcores to do their challenges.
---
Are those not the 3 starting relics? Or am I missing something?
---
Actually I thought about it over and the infinite run one might be very useful considering how big zeah is and the fact that you can't train agility IIRC?
---
but yeah, my point was, all of the relics that have to do with prayer aren't very relevant since any good player knows how to one tick flick.
---
The fact you're being upvoted at all makes me lose faith in this subreddit.
---
I never said we should nerf the quest requirements? Nice strawman though. And again, Vorkath is locked behind a quest that is far harder than Exiles AND is an actual boss, so mot comparable.
---
Most people play on one account at a time, so this probably isn't worth it for them to do. Ironman btw
---
Just buy all the pieces and bank the collection that’s what I did
---
All those dudes with k-pop profile pictures
---
I'd never kill these for gp. This is strictly a balancing issue. 
---
Compare these to any slayer monster over 60 slayer...They're ridiculously OP and tedious.
---
Name the bracket and I’ll wax that ass whenever you want bb prefer 85-90 range but I have a couple baby pures—I’ll bond up one just for you
---
Sucks you just wooshed.
---
Fun mini game for you: Take a drink every time a PvPer on this subreddit calls you ‘entitled’.
---
It’s their favorite (and only!) insult. 
---
“Lol at all the ez scape kids who think they are *entitled* to good game design”
---
Yup. Got me.
---
GP takes time to get. Time has a value. This means gp has a value. Once again you can blame the players, they are giving it value, but there's nothing special going on here; it's always been this way and will always continue to be. Not just in osrs but this applies to pretty much everything in life. 
---
If you want to actually fix the problem then it requires some deeper thinking.
---
Who wanted an upgrade? A couple streamers and people on twitter?
---
Absolutely love this idea, I will be voting yes to all of it. That slayer helmet though... Personally I think it could use a redesign
---
It was more of a joke, not a roast :) but that’s funny I actually think I’ve seen a YouTube vid of someone doing exactly that. Gearing up with baguette to look like a scrub and then swapping to smack with an ags or something crazy
---
This thread is amusing. The quest is a master quest. They should never ever have been a level 60 slayer monster, should have been 90+ at the very least seeing as they drop the clear bis helmet addon. 
---
The buffs are perfectly fine, however being level 60 slayer isn’t fine whatsoever. 
---
Thinking Jagex did these buffs because of twitter is also amusing when twitter never get what they wish for if you think about it logically, but the reddit/casual community seem to think otherwise because they are biased a. Jagex knew they fucked up, trying to fix the issue but they can never fix it with how low the requirements are for them. 
---
This is the problem with games these days, casuals like the OP of this thread &amp; many in here kill the games they play by making content too easy because they want to be satisfied in the short term not the long term. Killed so many MMOs &amp; other games it’s so sad to see.
---
imagine! and you could only take your most trusted friends otherwise you run a risk of getting teamkilled within the raid??
---
who are we kidding tho, this is safescape nowdays, any and all risk is gone outside the only peice of content that wont pass a poll.
---
The jaw is worth 30m... Lol 
---
If anything it's another dwh drop low reqs but has a much much lower drop rate.
---
Yes, because they're prestigious, to some extent. Some people are even saying that these rewards are only prestigious if you're an ironman (because otherwise you could just buy them)
---
Keep shit drop-tables with a big ticket item. Look at fucking Bandos, garbage until the good drop.
---
"STATE OF OFFERING A QUEST,UPGRADE,MISSION,GOAL OBJECTIVE, PROGRESSION  BUT MAKING THE CONTENT UNDESIRABLE OR DIFFICULT TO PROGRESS BY SHOWING PRICED $ POWER UPS OR GOLD TO MAKE IT EASIER. 
---
OR SHOWING UPGRADE OPTIONS WITH DESIRABLE OR DIRE NEED ADVERTISEMENTS MAKING THE CONSUMER FEEL THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BUY IN ORDER TO CONTINUE PROGRESSION "
---
I don't get what they did, people said they were boring so they increased their hp &amp; defence... which makes them more boring, so no I wouldn't have done that, pretty weird change
---
Aaaand dead content. That was way quicker than I expected.
---
Yeah, I was pretty stoked to add another decent-looking task to my list. I unlocked Basilisks from Duradel/Konar and spent the points to extend them. 
---
Now suddenly I'm seeing that they're going from pretty okay-seeming mid-level task to a "sucks to do" task - pretty sure I'm just going to lock the task again and be glad I didn't mill through a thousand points skipping task to get a Basilisk task.
---
I’ll say it before the brainless can, “BuT cErB aNd VoRkAtH aRe BoSsEs We CaNt KiLl ThEm AnYwAys”
---
I honestly don't think there's a single place I would use ahrims over it. You basically only care about mage attack at zulrah and raids. You certainly would use dagonhai at zulrah, and if you were experienced at raids I imagine you would use it there too
---
They all do the same thing, how do you expect Jagex to catch one swap and not the other?
---
Thanks ! :}}
---
People often talk about BiS and the psychological hooks associated with them.
---
Im not personally a huge fan of one best item only available from one place (ie. raids) and no comparable items available from anywhere else.
---
I have played alot of WoW and I don't like that there either. Granted the game isn't as raid focused. But in general, there are a lot of items in World of Warcraft compared to RuneScape, and in comparison it often makes RuneScape seem a lot more shallow and dull.
---
You know, I'd much rather have more items like amulet of defense in the same power range. Something like amulet of accuracy obviously compares to items like amulet of strength and amulet of power, but is obviously weaker.
---
I don't know, I feel it would be better if the game was inundated with items than if it was not. And that the best items were not always from raids or just from 1 type of content in general.
---
Like it's totally cool that places like raids and barrows have a set effect that's not available anywhere else. I just wish singular pieces of equipment were just not gated behind that.
---
Whip has maintained it's use throughout updates even though it's no longer BiS (and frankly one item shouldn't remain BiS forever). Alot of players on OSRS are opposed to new updates out of fear that some former content would become obsolete (a common problem in WoW, where this happers alot more frequently and at least for me causes burnout).
---
However, a new item, despite being, say, level 80 or something, wouldn't necessarily have to be as easy to get as a level 75 item. By making items progressively more rarer, you not only increase their price, you also create a progressive system where lower level items won't become useless as time goes on.
---
Another way you can keep higher level items expensive is to make them degrade to dust.
---
Say, if you got a charged, degradeable item from raids (which is harder) and a similar, slightly less or more powerful item that degrades to dust from other content, I'd be fine with that.
---
Overall, it would be nice to see more obscure items added to places than just raids that cater to more players than just the top raiders. A place like a raid is a good way to put a lot of items in the game at once, and move the game forward, of course, but I don't think it should be the only way.
---
Things like treasure trails (already for niche items like 3rd age), smithing, quests, etc. shouldn't be neglected.
---
A recent example is something like the Crystal Tools from the recent Elf quest. These tools are very useful skilling, but gated behind very high combat and questing requirements. And that is obviously fine, but the game should have other comparable and worse content for account types too that cannot access the elven city, such as skillers or people who do not enjoy alot of questing.
---
To balance it, these new tools could be harder to get (ie. rare from clue scrolls) or high skilling requirements (such as mining + some minigame) and they would have to be replaced sooner than Crystal Tools or be more expensive in other ways, and/or be complementary to crystal tools such as a skilling ring or outfit occupying a different slot.
---
Overall, I feel it would be better for the game to have more items, not less, and I think this can be balanced despite what community usually thinks about BiS. I mean, I'll be honest, im a lapsed player and that is largery because I accomplished most of my goals pre-eoc and I want something new to pursue. But also because I don't feel certain aspects of the game aren't as great and could be improved.
---
It could be beneficial to make it f2p. Get new players to come and experience an exciting new game mode but then they'll be free to play in the main mode tempting them to buy membership
---
So what? The option to do them still exists
---
I am mid level and would probably not be able to fight either.
---
So i go kill my black demons and basilisks and blue dragons like a good boy. 
---
I dont tell jagex that they should increase the slayer requirement so that other people with higher combat stats but lower slayer cant do demonic gorillas.
---
Well for barrage spells yea, but you don't often see people using something like water wave.
---
Jokes on all of you, that's MY right hand
---
No matter what the XP rates are, people who have more time to play will do better.
---
We'll have to see what the final product looks like after their testing, I'm confident they won't make it NEETman mode.
---
Give away down in the comment section below!
---
I'm with you.  I have been hoping for a speedrunning mode or something similar for years.  I'm not really hyped about leagues because in the end, it comes down to who can play the most, not who is the most efficient and knowledgeable.
---
Their drop table is really good. They drop the jaw.
---
Reddit it's spoiled with the expectation of consistent money from everything all the time. They forgot the actual old-school design philosophy of really valuable rare drops. The GWD works this way, steel dragons work this way, abby demons work this way, gargoyles used to work this way, kq works this way
---
After the consistency buffs to everything, we finally get some diversity in monster drop mechanics and then we get the sub 1200 players throwing a fit.
---
Or just let me have my reward, the difference from 67 -&gt; 68 is 51k, from 70 -&gt; 71 (when I can use it) is 69k ^(nice). Neither actually grant me a full level, I can understand locking it from a level 1 using it. Just a bit frustrating my only option is to either runecraft or use it on literally any other skill. I mean that's hardly an option at all, but I guess it's an option, rc bad :(.
---
they should change their name to pvm/slayer weapons and disable them being used in pvm for the lols
---
Sire is not 3m per hour, unless you're getting like 35-40 kills per hour or you're getting insanely lucky. Either way, it's not 3m or hour. Source: 1k+ kc on a 126combat in max gear
---
Im not a big fan of pet drops being facts that can determine how high you can place. Unelss there is some sort of luck bad luck protection. I feel like this type of game design feels VERY bad for the players specially competitive ones (since it all comes down to rng to determine if you can complete the task or not).
---
If you dont like doing this task, dont extend it dummy
---
Seriously. I managed to do 100 kills over the span of like 5 days or something and was so burnt from it I actually stopped playing for like 4 weeks.
---
Regarding med-level content. They just need to stop level 65/70 armour being BIS (looking at bandos/armadyl mainly). I know they don't want to make GWD1 dead content but the way RS has always worked in the past is release best gear only so gear that used to be the best is now 2nd/3rd best which then goes to med-level players.
---
IMO they could easily add a GWD2 or similar feature, with 2 new team bosses (not solo or locked to slayer only....) for new BIS melee and range gear. Could add more bosses to it to add other armours/weapons if people wanted.
---
Now AFAIK Bandos is hard to do realistically on a med level account because you'll just get crashed by a duo of maxed players.
---
Honestly with what the blog posted. All menu entry swappers and shift click changes should be taken you. He definitely is throwing a tantrum but they say in the blog anything that reduces number of click or how you interact in selection is against the rules..
---
Left click banking a bsnker? Tools at the leprechaun? These are all against the rules with what they state... Despite how trivial and improving they are to quality of life...
---
I don’t even know. I just feel as if this is BS. :/ they should implement some in the regular vanilla client then.
---
Thats...a micro transaction. Isn’t micro aggression thrown around by people with blue hair? I’ve heard it a lot but don’t actually know what it’s meant to mean. Assumed you knew.
---
Truu. It'll make em run away or pray tho ;)
---
Might as well rename is Asperger's Ironman.
---
Yeah, should have just stuck with using OP Plug ins and flamed Jagex for not meeting community standards
---
you seem extremely salty over words on the internet
---
i think youre the loser there bucko
---
The poll is just about the rewards, right? Seems to me like Jagex is trying to gauge what rewards are wanted and whether or not they should be tradable. Neither of those seem very closely related to the difficulty of the tasks.
---
Why wasn't this polled? You've killed content before it's even a week old.
---
Just uncheck the unlock, 0 pts to block it
---
So the real issue is they need to buff the Basilisks AND the quest to force the "mid-level" players, just like all the other alternative slayer mob for high-level loot.  Not "force" players onto this slayer mob (even though they have a lower level alternative) to a "mid-level" player.  
---
Again, your logic is flawed.
---
What does back in the day mean to you? This old-school it's way way easier than actual old-school.
---
Thumbs up
---
And a long grind like everything in OSRS isn't a timewall? At least CoC doesn't expect you to be bored while clicking like an idiot if you don't want to pay.
---
OSRS has allways been structured like a mobile game without the paywalls on it. Harsh truth but truth nonetheless.
---
Not that I know of, my friend in CC showed me these settings though. [https://i.imgur.com/kb9LkRa.png](https://i.imgur.com/kb9LkRa.png)
---
if by "thriving" you mean "overridden with goldfarmers, bots, and alts" then sure.
---
No you can see perfectly fine! There's no release date **yet**.
---
This is exactly my reasoning. Hope jmods put some thought into this avenue of gameplay.
---
It’s a lovely cycle :)
---
Side note, I read your flair and realized I only hear the word “completed” in C Engineers voice. I think I need to take a break lol
---
As a PvM-exclusive player, I still vote yes to any PvP updates that make sense, like the majority of the ones that are proposed. I don't understand the clear hatred most PvM players have for PvP updates.
---
I understand that the current state of the Wilderness isn't great, as it promotes a predator-prey relationship, but PvP updates could eventually change that and make PvP in itself a rewarding experience. If we get to that point we might see some PvMers get their sticks out of their asses.
---
Plus, the PvM content in the Wilderness is hardly exceptional, so the only real reason to go there is as an Ironman for a dragon pickaxe.
---
Omg to do all of the quests 0.0 that would be a task worth doing. You guys are convincing me
---
Bots are why it's rarer. 60 slayer isn't very high. There are already bots at kurasks.
---
Well except the piles on mobile are still fucked up
---
You’re assuming he has 10hp. We don’t know. Anyway 10hp accounts are stupid.
---
did you make a new account with him?
---
LOL when has this happened?
---
What a loser. It’s just a game. He died to smoke devils lmfao.
---
Manga Junkie!
---
Right but it gives people direct incentive to vote no. I want to be able to do clues and wildy bosses without dying. I'm voting no to anything that makes me more likely to die.
---
Nex was a very popular boss pre EoC. I know its a team boss and not a solo slayer monster but things can be done.
---
Sorry the other 5 are just close ups, the pics from my insta
---
Uh well here's my experience:
---
Stuck initializing game 
---
Uninstalled an other app and a few songs
---
Reopened app
---
App updated guessing didn't have space for update
---
Stuck initializing game
---
Restarted phone
---
Game runs
---
It's finicky on iOS.
---
Is that a bloodborne character?
---
Already been talked about and we settled on shift drop. Shift drop works fine, doesn’t dramatically change xp rates, and has been widely accepted since introduction.
---
I hate to say this, but pkers need to mass spite vote against all PvM content until Jagex does something to prevent spite voting from both sides.
---
So whats the problem with another unique? It’s not like they can do 2 of them at the same time.
---
fyi thats the worst relic by a long shot. the highest prayer you can use is mystic might. (other than somehow getting augury/rigour from raids lol, good luck w/ that)
---
and if you can one tick prayer flick, you essentially have infinite prayer points, which means getting high prayer is next to pointless.
---
the accumlator+endless endurance ones are 10x better than the auto bury one.
---
Can you link some of these tweets? The only complaining I saw was on reddit, there were a handful of players on here annoyed that a monster with such low requirements that could be afked dropped the new bis helm.
---
This was on me, my pixel downloaded the update but didn't push it. Updating now, hopefully works!
---
Whip is degradable because of the tentacle whip dude.
---
Blowpipe isn't degradable but it is at its equivalent of alch price as it is exactly the price you get for dismantling it and selling the scales, so that's effectively the blowpipe's baseline (which it is at).
---
I'm pretty sure all non-megarare dragon equipment (combat) is alch price. Skilling dragon equipment is consumable as well due to smouldering stone upgrades.
---
I think you've forgotten that pretty much all your example are degradable lol.
---
I think it's more that they have a BiS drop that's the issue with them being too easy.
---
yep such game integrity to make level 60 slayer monsters stronger than level 85 slayer monster -.-
---
Rip
---
That's not spite, that's self preservation. I care more about my interests than I do about the interests of the people trying to kill me and make the game worse for me.
---
I'm disregarding items that may or may not exist that may or may not address the problems I listed, and justifying a thousands of hour RNG-based task with needing to "commit the time" for it. Got it.
---
I obviously wasn't calling the BiS helmet drop ass, and nowhere did I say I wanted more alchables. Runescape is a game about feeling rewarded for your effort, and these simply don't feel rewarding about 99.9% of the time.  I also prefer not to look at the game as a GP per hour sim, so maybe we just play differently.
---
Lmao i knew id get downvoted for this. Everyone wants dopaminescape and doesnt care about long term stability of the game, yet complain when the game quality degrades
---
Well would you rather they made it OP for training and for drops too?
---
Nah that makes too much sense
---
It wouldn’t be perfect but it would be 10000x better than we have currently. There are bad apples in every aspect of the game. Just because a few people will make smurfs, doesn’t mean everyone will. Just because there are people who use automatic prayer switchers in PvP right now, doesn’t mean everyone does.
---
Gotcha thanks for the clarification either way it looks great, props to the artist then. Yes I agree for me too is one of my absolute favorite items it looks just so good and badass.
---
You know. I wouldn’t mind the buff but they didn’t even buff the drop table did they -_-
---
The Twisted League will act as a pilot League, which we are hoping to learn from! If we notice that players are unhappy about the length, we will adjust it for future leagues.
---
Literally a 0.06% chance at Obtaining Olmlet for an average 100k point trio raid with even point distribution. Not RNG btw.
---
It literally says they’ll have relics that helps with rng. People don’t read shit.
---
Nice one mate.
---
Putting dust, chaos, and law runes in pouch gives you crumble undead and home teleport and saves you an inventory space
---
Black masks.
---
YESS
---
I really dislike that there will be a tradeable slayer helm upgrade
---
Imagine thinking any of the words he used were "big"...
---
But the reddit neckbeard represents them? 😂😂😂😂
---
I like this, it keeps spots from being incredibly crowded, makes the items keep their value and I guess prevents botting (visit Gargs/Wyverns in open area non-total world if you don't know what I'm talking about).
---
What’s your current slayer level? Most stuff under 1-3k id just leave on the ground. Low level slayer you want to power through it to get to better xp/gp tasks.
---
to up the ante, wear a red shirt and walk sideways like a crab
---
Maybe to avoid gold farmers camping it?
---
I still hate it though
---
Not really, prims also give attack bonuses where dboots do not. Also, having a muta attached to the Serp the high level community will wear that over the new helm since mutas are much harder to obtain than a helm attachment anyone can buy
---
Again you think pvp is only pvp wolrld 1v1s. You cant have those goals and opt out of the risk of being killed, none of those things you listed require any real gp risk. Adapt dude. Like my irl ironman mate did for his rcb, he kept getting killed, so he risked less, he figured out who he could fight back on. He understood the different active periods for different timezones. He got me to come protect him for an hour, cost him a pint.
---
Say you want those things without the added risk of the wildy. Your god cape would be trash and imbued only slightly better. Clues would have some other high skill req or item req steps. Dpick would be a way way longer multiple 1000 kill rng grind. Those capes are for people willing to do all content. 
---
Can you pretend to be the glass half full guy for a second. Even a mmo player that fears all pvp will like the concept of a lawless place where any player can kill you and take all your loot and gear but if you risk it, there are great rewards. Even if the example player never set foot in those lands because being hunted alone was to much for them, they would appreciate it and those who do risk and more so those willing to go and fight! This is hard to find in modern MMOs. Have you read into stories from dark scape where people had to smuggle vaulables and loot from the low, med and high tier banks/GEs. The paths between were dangerous and people could kill you for everything but you could make bank trading items and such. 
---
In the past i would have agreed with you on your last point but i think right now jagex actually is focusing on pvp reworking as a whole rather than wildy content for pvmers/skillers.
---
Also note that 3x was their starting point for internal testing, and can easily be changed if it'd be beneficial.
---
l0l entitled pvmers
---
Yeah, wearing the same colour shirt is nice and a great idea, but let's not hope it will actually do something.
---
&gt;Maybe encouraging hybrid defence styles, switching armour to defend properly to teach people how to gear swap.
---
Problem with this is 100% protects. Even if you nerf protects to be like 80% effective or what not at the content, it'll still be DPS-scape.
---
I'd argue Boss design is pretty limited, but the reward space is insanely vast if they keep power levels in check. I they already took most of the phases from/remastered pre-eoc bosses.
---
Why is everyone still surprised that the only thing Jagex cares about is Slayer and ultra-high level content?
---
Yeah, oh well. We'll see what happens in the next few weeks or months. I wonder why people are down voting me, yikes.

If you wanna permanently ink yourself with childrens cartoon characters wearing pixelated armour from a decades old medieval fantasy game than you do you bro. Maybe get a funko pop tattoo of your favourite marvel superhero.
---
No shit. I was trying to be nice and not directly calling him a greasy basement dwelling incel for being mad at people who have lives and still play this game.
---
But sLaYeR GuD people vote yes to any fucking slayer powercreep they can because they don't want to do any other content. And to be fair, that's hardly their fault, jagex puts virtually no effort into making engaging and rewarding non-slayer content
---
Should never have been added
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but... All this grinding for..
---
 Cosmetics ? Lol
---
Although I do understand that this isn't what the twitter neckbeards had in mind, their complaining did cause it to happen. And considering jagexs "hotfix" track record I don't know why they were expecting any differently than to basically screw everyone over.
---
RuneFest is supposed to be an inclusive event. If bulls play the game, let them attent RuneFest.
---
The point of the vagueness in the response is to prevent people from trying to find loopholes around it. The fear that you might get banned from doing something kinda prevents you from doing it in the first place.
---
I don't get why people still complain that the statements are vague when they it's done on purpose in the first place. 
---
Protip: If you think you might get banned by doing a certain thing, then that's probably the case to begin with.
---
yes.
---
Q
---
I've honestly thought a lot about that concept. Similar to that ice kingdom being added to 55 wildy via that one grandmaster quest in 2010 scape. I support raids 3 in the Wildy
---
Imagine how smooth your brain is to call out a spelling error. Do I have to mention he misspelled "difficulty" as well or are you too brain dead? Lmao
---
If you bring a ranged weapon like a crystal bow, you can safespots superior gargs and nechs without dealing with any mechanics or damage.
---
Pausing main game progress definitely sucks but that slayer helm is too nice not to do it.
---
&gt; to the lore  
---
&gt;Fuck everything
---
L0L shoulda passed warding
---
1 flip for each drop table roll
---
Go to RS3 then.
---
I think about it like this: pvp has a lot of issues and introducing stronger weapons solves none of them. No reason to crowd out legitimate fixes to pvp's problems with bandaid patches *and* make life suck even more for pvmers in the wildy.
---
Problem with Nex is that curses don't exist, so they'd have to introduce curses into OSRS so Nex can utilize them. Via soulsplit, deflects, and turmoil drains.
---
There's also the fact that some of her phases were ported to other bosses, so it might feel a bit copy-paste unless they add OSRS-flair to the boss.
---
I can’t stand all this new POWERCREEPS
---
Every new BiS item that surpasses the old one needs higher requirements to obtain than the predecessor. Adamant used to be BiS, but you wouldn't want a new BiS item to be released to shops for 3k gp accessible to everyone.
---
We're at a point where BiS items are obtained as rare rewards from difficult monsters, bosses, and raids. This update goes against that principle.
---
&gt; It says i can use my current account, do i lose progress in the account?
---
your current account on the main game will not lose stats. if you chose to play the new gamemode your stats will be wiped on that account after the 2 months is over.
---
&gt;does that mean my normal account becomes locked for 2 months, or i just cant log in to both gamemodes at once?
---
you just can't login to both at the same time. and yes its membs only.
---
200? Just toggle the unlock, that costs 0.
---
Fine, I'll concede that the AGS has better KO potential. As expressed in my original post, I remember seeing the VLS hit pretty consistently through prayer which is what turned me off from it. Purely anecdotal I guess.   
---
  
---
On the flipside, then, if the AGS already exists as a better weapon that does not degrade in 12.5 minutes, what value does the VLS add? I voted yes in this poll just because I wanted to see the game spiced up a bit, but I feel like there should be a better reason.
---
No one is forcing you to play.
---
In before the buffed drop rates carry over to main game and ruin the economy
---
I DONT GET THE MEME

My brothers account got hacked. He claimed he was maxed and a billionaire. I ended up putting in an appeal for him and getting it back when mobile was released. He was combat 42 with his highest skill mining - 61. 
---
Still pronounces it “room scape”...
---
Good point. Also adding a way to get anti dragon shields will be crucial.
---
after all it is an official thing ::renderself ... kinda
---
That doesn't make any sense.
---
Tag God Ash on Twitter might help .might get a response at least
---
knowing my luck in osrs I'm probs be getting 1 arcane with no pet...... yup ain't playing
---
I just might, thanks for the suggestion
---
You would love anyone's sandwich mate, that's why your mum still makes them for you at lunch time.
---
I agree but half the playerbase would have a meltdown if actual tier 80 was introduced. Will probably never happen
---
I remember seeing people complain on the RSOF that they could only participate in RS3's double xp weekends for one day. Complaining because they have a job and shouldn't be "penalized" because of it. Some even suggesting in a thread it shouldn't be limited to just the weekend.
---
Entitled asshats run amok in all fandoms unfortunately.
---
i think you got the wrong sub
---
Based off how easy they are to unlock and their non-jaw drop table values, they definitely feel like they should be mid-level, whether Jagex intentionally meant for that to be the case or not.
---
It was very badly communicated imo.
---
&gt; The original Neitznot helm was BIS for a long time and it was never hard to obtain and I think that is alright. It also was cheap and allowed players to PK with it without having to risk too much. 
---
Adamant was originally BiS as well. Doesn't mean everybody should be able to buy the next BiS item for 3k in a shop.
---
Each new BiS item has had higher requirements than its predecessor, pretty much without exception (can you think of any?). That's a great principle to follow. But it has pretty much ended now.
---
Get fucked PvPers
---
Was there a challenge to begin with when killing them?
---
if anyone wore that in public they'd be mocked
---
O thats reassuring, might try it when they release :)
---
Its a Master, not Grand Master. Also, 60 slayer for a BiS helm is already a joke.
---
? Bruh they drop like 20-30k avg in normal loot + fairly common 12m uniqu
---
the literal first thing I did on a brand new account I made a couple of months ago was do the fally easy diary, I only had the stats to do the required tasks. I couldn't even use the exp lamp reward I got as I had no skills above 30.
---
Finally one of your comments I can comment on.
---
Maybe ya know, don’t range them, then.
---
I think before devs release a monster they should have dedicated people, about 3 of them to sit there and do the task for an hour and a half then report with feedback. That way monsters wouldnt be outrageously bad from the get go and would atleast have some thought put into their actual kills. 
---
If they already do this then god help us all.
---
looks more like sandwich non-binary human to me
---
Got the jaw 722KC.
---
All done lol
---
If they're too hard, do regular basilisks.
---
You know that's an option, right?
---
No, this is them before the change.
---
Every world with 3-5 people safespotting them
---
Super easy once you find a team that knows what theyre doing.
---
Also, not all clue nests leave a nest after you search it...
---
You know you don’t have to do them right? If that’s too much for you just don’t do it.
---
Thank you haha. Yeah, very true, it's a mystery. Though regarding the whole 3pc thing, I hope Jagex clarifies what's allowed and isn't to 3pc developers. I heard from the runelite discord that the devs reached out to Jagex and are waiting to be told what to remove,so we'll see!
---
Sick nerd is honestly a little prick. I don’t get why people like him, he talks like such a cocky douche 24/7 for no reason. Had to quit watching him.
---
Lol, I'm not doing it wrong. How many kills per hour do you get?
---
Democracy baby
---
Give your chinchompha an extra nose boop for me please.
---
Just because someone said something about a streamer doesn't mean this an opportunity for everyone to jump on and say I don't like said streamer. Poor reaction that says more about yourselves.
---
Dragons are pretty light when you take off their wings, while seals are heavy because of their blubber. Simple as that
---
1k kills dry but since a few streamers got lucky it's nerf time. Fucking idiots balancing content.
---
Actually sounds good. Good job, Jagex
---
What's the fucking point then.
---
Like Jesus Christ why do people accept this kind of content. Why instead of a cool fight that takes skill we get this fucking thing that takes no challenge.
---
:') ty op
---
Rice cup made a video of him doing sire in absolute max, 25 kills an hour with the scythe 24 with arc. I agree with you. And especially now that the bludgeon isn’t the 45m it used to be.
---
A decision made 13 years ago when there wasnt a huge focus on power creep and balancing.
---
In regards to:
---
  **If I don't compete in this league will I still be able to get the Twisted League rewards in the next league?** 
---
I feel this kind of forces iron men accounts to play the league, because they won't be able to just buy the rewards from other players? Have there been any thoughts on acquiring them through another way?
---
I saw in the newspost that League Points can be spent on both relics and rewards. Do you foresee people being too miserly with their points to buy enough relics?
---
I was hoping they'd use separate "currency" from what the final rewards use :(
---
How many ring slots are available to your character? I think that answers your question
---
I don't think faceguard should be BiS is my take.
---
This needs more upvotes
---
Ye I was mainly comparing to sick nerd who got it at 80 and started complaining that it was too easy.
---
I wouldn't consider picking up items worth under 3k in the early game. Early game your main focus should be xp. Think of the game as you would real life (scary, I know!). Time=money. The higher your level, the more money you make in the same amount of time. If you spend extra time banking/looting mithil kiteshields, you're extending the time it takes before you can get 15m+ drops from high-level PvM. You have to use judgement in deciding what drops will be an "investment for my future high level content". While yes, those small drops would add up over time, not near as much as the time put into it when you are making 1m+ per slayer task or 10m+ per high level boss tasks.
---
Git Gud broke boy
---
Red Cape season is back baby!
---
These things are basically drakes now but with 20 lvl lower slayer req
---
Yea, but very minimally and Reddit was still crying. They’re still bis for zerks.
---
Congratulations bro!
---
Honestly I feel bad for you PvP folk, I've no clue what keeps you playing the game when you get basically 0 updates...
---
demonics are actually good money if you kill them efficiently. They're on par with zulrah etc.
---
Jokes on you i actually am.
---
Thanks!
---
Most pvm'ers in the wildy are there for wildy Slayer or revs.....both are willingly. They are accepting more risk for more points or more gp/hr
---
I agree that maybe there should be wildy bosses or if there are they shouldn't have pets but high tier Skilling/money making should still be in pvp areas. That's the trade off 
---
- this is coming from a main pvm'er
---
Monster shoots a slow projectile through the air that you have to dodge. See vorkath fireball
---
Who is doing it?
---
How does it not make sense, COX is zeah content, this is a zeah league, so the rewards will be based around Zeah. COX is already one of the best money makers in the game, it doesn’t need a buff.
---
zenytes are 1/300 and the drop rate doesnt change off task
---
I bought her for 5gp fair and square. Buzz off
---
Unless you are ironman
---
Tbf tho, Slayer helm isn't like 35m
---
Technically blackjacking isn't the case as it's fundamentally the same as the bank booths. You're simply switching the left click option on the standing NPC to knockout and if you have attack options off pick pocket is the default left click. It also has 2 different Id's for when it's standing and knocked out. 
---
It's abusive don't get me wrong but it's not in the same category as the prayer, you're selecting a bone and using it on an alter in one click which makes no sense.
---
It’s for the bounty hunter store. But they Should Just keep specials how they are IMO
---
At 118 strength it does, go test it. You’re the one the seemed excited over the +2 attack bonus so figured you should be reminded of the negatives bonuses serp has. So the faceguard not only gives a max hit but is also more versatile.
---
doesn't change the fact that "Mid level monsters don’t drop BIS." is not true
---
The slayer helm recolor is for the main game
---
Yeah, I discovered that when I was getting kills so I could write my above comment. 
---
This update is just plain ridiculous honestly, not balanced for the players that it's meant for and it's not even implemented properly LMFAO. So it's just as afk as on release but now it eats through more of your supplies whose costs are not recouped from the other drops because the devs thought players wanted drops to be more GWD-esque on a freaking slayer monster!
---
Yep. I've never see a company reverse a game decision, but this time I think they should. The Basilisk jaw is super valuable right now, but it's not gonna stay there. Eventually everyone will have a Faceguard who needs one, and the price will tank. 
---
Mark my words, if they don't revert this change then this time a year from now when the Basilisk Jaw is like 2-4mil someone will make a post going "Why the FUCK are Basilisk Knights so hard when their drops are so bad?"
---
There's something poetic about this getting down voted
---
You lost all credibility when you made those sweeping statements, “neckbeards”, 10 people on Twitter. I get it, Reddit is a hive mind of casuals, but not everyone likes everything being an AFK-fest. Likewise, slayer level of a creature should have no indication on their difficulty; Hellhounds include Cerb and Goblins include General Graardor for example. I get it you lot have group orgy sessions over slayer, but not everything has to be slayerscape.
---
 Serp was +5 strength, and considering it costs scales to use, people were fine with it being BiS since zulrah was an interactive boss and the helm needed to be charged. Nezzy has prayer bonus, comes from an AFKable monster, and on top of that has +1 strength over it's harder to obtain predecessor. 
---
 Literally all the serp helm is good for atm is poisoning a single nylo at the very end of a ToB raid. The defensive stats people on Reddit claim makes the serp useful is the least useful part about it (outclassed by Justiciar anyway lol). It has never mattered in the context of PvM, and people will choose whatever gives the most offense. The only logical approaches are to either make their drop source harder (this current version of basilisks is not exactly what anyone would call enjoyable/interactive though), or nerf the nezzy to +4/ 5.
---
I unlocked basilisk slayer tasks and extented them... RIP slayer pojangs :'(
---
If they were gonna ban people using the client I would hope they would say that outright. Until then, I’m going to keep using runelite
---
Warding lel
---
You are a fucking actual snowflake fucking retard and your mentalitly is what will kill osrs. You instant gradification fuckwit
---
id like to bend you over that golf cart and see just how expensive those baked goods are
---
There is no hop limit anymore afaik
---
In all seriousness. i think we should add it to harder level content and erase all existing black masks. That would set a better precedent for how easy slayer is.
---
Was killing basilisk knights before buff for a jaw off task 1000kc dry and now I don’t know if it’s worth to keep killing them
---
you don't need to dodge if you have auto retaliate on it doesn't do any damage
---
But 58 slayer for slayer helm which is meta for a shit load of bosses is ok? Not everything needs a super high requirement.
---
My polished pet rock!
---
That’s why it’s the wildy and it’s a PVP area. High risk high reward. We want to have fun just as much as you guys do. We have fun differently and it seems there’s always a problem on how we are allowed to have fun, unless it pleases everybody else. It’s a shame.
---
Okay okay enough trolling, they should revert the changes since the quest came out. By changes I mean all the skills I just leveled to be able to do the quest after work today because it's not like it matters now.
---
Even if that was possible, the helm cant be equipped before you complete the quest.
---
Weird, how do you see 10.1 rather than 10?
---
H
---
I suppose I really mean "always BiS for a given combat style." E.g. anguish is always BiS necklace *for ranged.
---
I still think there is a gap in content for people in the 70-80 combat stat bracket, and I think adding the Nezzy faceguard in that tier, for between 4-10m gp, is a good compromise. 
---
As I stated before, I still think Verac's and Serp helmets retain BiS for many off-task, melee bosses (Bandos GWD is the example I have in mind here, assuming I'm not doing the mage method). I might be wrong, there isn't a good amount to data available yet. I can't cover every case, because I don't know every detail about the game. But I think I'm well-informed enough to have an opinion with some weight. I'm also willing to be wrong, as I have mentioned already.
---
I bet he had -berg in his name 😂
---
This
---
Right and many people have voiced that Zulrah should be locked behind MEP2 or SOTE. However, you could also argue a mid level player could kill Zulrah anyways as you only need a blowpipe, trident, and 80 ranged/mage.
---
It was 10 my bad. I'll edit my post.
---
To be fair, you could say that about any 1-99 guide since the wiki has amassed so much information. I’m already almost maxed but I like his videos because I’m general, they always teach me something new. He generally goes over all the decent methods and both afk and fast which I like.
---
I think it was also more or less updates that weren't asked for. For example, 99 is the max level you can get. New gear updates are slowly creeping to the 99 cap and once we reach it a decision has to be made. Should you increase stats to 120 or make hundreds of niche items. A question to be answered when the time comes but doing it now makes no sense. I think that's what happened alot on rs3
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question but what RS grinds are both high intensity and 300 hours?
---
&gt;The point of the vagueness in the response is to prevent people from trying to find loopholes around it.
---
Why find loopholes when you can apparently just wait a year or so after their previous statement on actions needing to remain 1:1 , and they'll let osb keep their broken 5:1 menu swappers for a week and a half without consequences before saying anything about it?
---
agreed 100% reddit just salty they cant afk now (even though you can still afk lol)
---
I've found that just doing zero fletching doesn't get me to the minimum 500 point threshold
---
Why are veracs horns photoshopped on?
---
Which is so fucking useless and a waste of time. If you want points, just solo lmao like wtf.
---
Lava eel fish until you get enough for an Onyx. You'll also get onyx bolt tips as well while saving up.
---
The pvping community is ~5% of the entire playerbase, wayyyy more pvmers voted no to warding than pvpers. Think for yourself and stop making imaginary enemies.
---
&gt;Why should PvP be any different?
---
Because not minmaxing your account's defence and prayer levels puts you at a serious disadvantage. If you really want to grind out dozens of BH kills for uniques, you have to either max combat or make a new account with a build in mind.
---
No other content in-game is easier with a lower level, besides wintertodt.
---
But ash keeps his boots on
---
Really sucks - You basically have to halt your progress in order to get these cosmetics...
---
They should change it to 88 slayer because that is my slayer level.
---
Where does it go on female characters then 🤔
---
Yeah it drops three BIS, should be three times better than a basilisk.
---
Train agility! That will help with absolutely everything. Then start questing for the rewards.
---
At least we only lost Mat K when it comes to useful mods.
---
People like him are the reasons why pvp is dying. Yes there are more reasons but even seasoned pkers like myself, I run into more people like this guy than like you. I don’t expect a dm but if you spec and tab right after, fuck you.
---
just get a ring of life it's not expensive Jesus /s
---
The most I've lose in one kill is probably about 40?
---
that sounds horrible friend, i am so sorry, it’ll be worth it though once you hit 70
---
Correct! A godsend for ironmen that hop world's constantly
---
I mean I'm all for this for the skillers/pvmers, but you guys literally dropped LMS a month and a half ago and since then have kinda neglected giving that an actual league too + item rotations + build rotations + actually fixing mage.
---
Blask mask is literally the best item in game. The slayer requirement needs to be 99. You must become a pro slayer before wearing a pro slayer item
---
You can use rune knives without a safe spot
---
Yes I have done over 2000 pre nerf without any luck and that alone was a pain! I am not happy with the update and don't see how some bad reviews from people forced a rush buff. Unfortunate!!
---
This x100000 times over you nailed it man! I’m a way better pker than pvmer cause I dedicate my time to pkin but I love both sides of the game and I’ve watched over the course of a year the pk community die
---
I can see where you're getting at.  It's grindy at times but you don't have to play for 12 hours a day to progress. I've played around 8-10 hours a week for the past year, some weeks not even 2. But that doesn't mean I don't progress. Frankly I would argue it to feel twice as amazing to reach a goal when you've spent months for a 99 or what ever.
---
If you think neit faceguard is gonna stay that expensive you're dellusional.
---
Nice, same percentage as the special already hits
---
should be "earnt'd've"
---
But it's not a PvP weapon, you could use it for NMZ or whatever
---
Good tip is to use an ancient mace spec on a house dummy to get prayer points before you go in.
---
Sell the acb bro.
---
Honestly you reddit casuals need to fuck off.
---
Yeah the serp will be so good at poisoning that 2 single nylo in ToB! Can't wait to spend 140k an hour to do that.
---
RS3 is literally gambling for unique gambling-only items and xp boosters, OSRS is just gold which is a straight conversion based on the current market.
---
Are you planning on showing her the thirst she's caused here?
---
Some people may think you’re joking, but what the fuck are skill capes? People complain about updates that make skilling easier or more simple. Why? It leads to more people owning their “dearly beloved” cape
---
Nope, you gay bro. Sorry.
---
The faceguard is still better than serp as a melee helmet. Sure, serp has an additional niche, but it's still a worse helmet that is more difficult to obtain. It also has a huge cost to use, which again makes it worse than the faceguard.
---
Isn’t the jaw already 1.6 mil?
---
Droprate is  unrelated  tto being dry
---
Yes, we desperately need some changes to the way content is introduced/changed. Maxed/nearly maxed Sweaty NEETs (who are still active players right now) make up probably one of the smallest demographics in the entire playerbase, and they objectively should not be allowed this level of influence.
---
Sure, they're maxed and play an obscene amount, good for them. Maybe they can influence polled choices, but they should never be allowed to get content changed in-game while skirting the poll system.
---
You don't even include defense stats? Only levels?
---
Its funny how people on reddit keep repeating this suggestion because they saw manked making it once but they dont realise that BH is literally so dead that finding a fight in the first place is so hard that this suggestion would not help at all.
---
Why isn't an investment done to create this tech? I'm sure account reworking is at least a 4-6 month endeavor filled with a lot of risk. But it's constantly tied to many other features such as simultaneous rs3 and osrs, and constantly cited as a blocking factor for many other things
---
That's an extreme example but the downvote button is awful for discussion. It means any unpopular opinion on the subreddit will always get downvoted, which causes less people to see that opinion, and it creates a domino effect where more people disagree with that opinion just because they see downvotes.
---
This is the only thing holding me back. I’d love to continue to play my Ironman while being able to show off rewards as well after a season.
---
What if the rewards were coded similar to Heroe’s Quest or Bonds where the item is “Used” on an Ironman to give it to them? As there is no actual non-cosmetic benefit, isn’t this something that could be done? If so, I imagine Jagex would be very happy to get the two memberships per month from other Ironmen that would do this.
---
that cum eating idiot ruins everything
---
? I didn't delete anything.. lol this is just a long thread of comments you can click the "Show parent comments" option though
---
Cool! Fuck PvP! Let’s make this game even MORE ironman centered!
---
That's some tinfoil hat shit m8
---
They said that's just the current baseline, they have yet to do a balance pass on it, and they stated they intend to do a balance pass on it.
---
Yes, the cosmetic rewards that are polled will be for the regular game. They're currently all set to be tradeable (except the trophies).
---
Think you're on the wrong thread mate
---
Flair
---
If only they polled most of the PvP weapons to be only available in PVP worlds, they just might have a chance of passing.
---
Oh yeah, definitely.  First back in 2010 bunch of people jumped ship for WoW, then OSRS brought back people who quit the game years ago, and now Jagex is about to lose what little community remains in RS3.
---
&gt; Making people grind for hours on end in front of a computer screen for something that doesn’t matter in real
---
I forgot all video game players play their preferred games with someone pointing a gun to their head like "DON'T YOU DARE STOP NOW"
---
Man I can't believe this has so many upvote
---
Yeah you're mad, but out the tin foil hat away...
---
ah well, never was able to leverage it so I guess I dont know what Im missing. hopefully they leave MES and customizable shift click alone, I agree the bury/pickpocket options due sound problematic though
---
It’s 100% the buyers fault.
---
Low level crafting = spin flax into bowstring and making molten glass.
---
I’d assume so, the Endurance one is insanely strong. I’m gonna guess the next set is probably one for each damage type, maybe you can pick from prior relics as well?
---
Hmm okay that's my bad
---
Got a friend who sold like 5b because he was bored with the game. I mean, I get wanting some money but why do people think that's so ok.
---
Nah that was my cba moment realise you were to dense to understand and to stubborn to change. Maybe it's just how you are though, hence why i keep replying. You interested me, anyway check u dm in a second.
---
Imagine power mining where the bots are lol
---
They would be rewards from something that actually needs good rewards, and would have real drawbacks.
---
Neither is true of the faceguard.
---
Basically this. Pvp weps are way too strong. Back when they first came out in rs3, the max hits were significantly lower than what they are today. Now with neit faceguard, inferno Cape, avernic, imbued rings etc they absolutely shit on everything.
---
Yeah it's a fucking joke. I don't care if the mode is good or fun. It's unpolled content that is stealing loads of dev time/resources away from future content we actually want.
---
I don't get why they were needed they have 1 good drop in total. Make around a 500-750k profit per hour, they have decent amount of health and hit pretty hard. Even their good drop is really rare off task(I'm 1.6k kills dry) , you get maybe 50-75 kills an hour at most. I see no point in making them harder.
---
Honestly [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9vwufl/where_tf_my_uber_driver_taking_me) one is still my favorite.
---
Is it limited to members?
---
Hoes mad x24
---
Twitter has to be the worst place for the Jmods to get advice.
---
That place is full of the sweatiest, ugliest, virginist of all OSRS players.

so you are saying you want stronger abby demons?

Isn't serp 1/512? I agree though

Hello my name is Slaysta and welcome to my efficient downvote farming guide.
---
Yeah i knew which one it was i went back up to laugh at something again. And it says deleted. Ill see what my reply was to it.
---
We have different definitions of being "forced" to do things... nobody is forcing you to go for all pets, you can just not get the wildy ones.
---
I think they were fine because of how bad the other drops were trash. With how they are now they need to buff the drop table to compensate.
---
Clap
---
also happy cake day
---
Edited, not deleting it cause I'm a man
---
I can't imagine they didn't think of that though, right? Just replace those drops with the finished products(insignia drops as wand, claw drops as DHL) and you've got some seriously coveted gear
---
i go to a lot of parties man, the best parties....we talk about cool guy stuff at parties...

^(im so lonely)
---
Hail Mod Ash
---
elsewhere in the thread a jmod mentioned that yes, it will be
---
Hey why don’t you create account security and fix broken parts of the game before implementing idiotic nonsense like this, idk just a thought.
---
&gt;go to rs3 if you want engaging combat
---
I think you mean: play an mmo that has nothing to do with runescape if you want engaging combat.
---
Yea I dont get it
---
The drop rate is kinda dumb, it should be a boss drop in all honestly
---
raising the requirement doesnt accomplish anything
---
Jfc dude fuck off
---
If it was wasn't apparent people balancing content don't play their own game, here it is.
---
OK this is gold
---
420 hp and theyre green heheheheh thats like weed
---
If you can't pick prior relics I might have to go abyssal accumulator. Unless trident is available on zeah somehow doing Cox with burning runes will suck dick.
---
You don't have to play. It's only a cosmetic reward...
---
That's what I'm talking about, I like the grind I just hate the bullshit outdated UI that's super inconsistent.
---
To be fair it did come out at the start of 2018, about 21 months ago. As far as OSRS content goes its fairly new, but its definitely been out for a while now.
---
Your suggestion would make the drops of Knights worse lol
---
aren't granite balls a significant buff to regular balls?
---
I was talking about RS3, they already have double XP.
---
Either dead content or overpowered ezscape rs3 garbage as usual - no winning with this community
---
I'm not sure how I'm stubborn when I said I was all for the updates but seeing as how they didn't pass offering a suggestion and alternative..? All I've done was state my perspective and reasons for other players and reasons why they don't like the wilderness, and my own reasons for not liking certain aspects
---
How?  
---
If I went to kill Zulrah and didn't get a Mutagen I'm not dry on the Mutagen.
---
I can undestand not wanting the pvp weapons bullshit but if you votes no to question 1 or 2 you are a cancer to this games longterm health.
---
This is a good idea in theory, but osrs players love to abuse mechanics. There would be no downside to risking 0 gp and tanking your rank. If you did this enough you could even set up bot farms more effective than the old ones as you have a ton of accounts at 0 ELO. They would just have to swap off which bots were killing and which were dying to tank the ELOs effectively. Plus people could grief and tank their ELO with 0 risk to fight weaker pkers. 
---
Though I think this idea would work great if the amount your ranking went up or down was dependent on your and your opponents gp risk. Just not sure how hard that would be to implement.
---
Thumbs up for you
---
Sad that all these people waste their lives away on a video game. Have goals in life people.
---
I’d call that lucky. 6 onyx’ and a serp are pretty lucky by themselves nevermind the muts.

very much doubt he didnt change name

Then people will have to choose, that's not bad.
---
I saw that, but I was hesitant about posting since he didn't seem happy that support had released his info - while exposing jagex's stupid twitter support model, it also exposes his information to a larger range of people.
---
You: 
---
&gt;Did you read the results?
---
Also you:
---
&gt;The results don't matter cause no one is going to admit it
---
And a pet is master level! That shit is gonna unlock for at least 1 redditor on day 1 and there's gonna be outrage before they change it, then nobody will sniff another pet again after that
---
It barely makes a difference, just makes them more tedious like hunlief or hydra where you need to count the attacks. Kind of a pointless change.
---
Which means that the price of the faceguard will remain very high and keep the monsters as profitable
---
Oh, you’re right! Hadn’t thought about that. All I saw was the run and prayer bonuses, then I got tunnel visioned.
---
Flippy said they have thought of it here.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dcam7z/old_school_runescape_twisted_league/f27lvr5
---
I was sure they have but crazy to think bout everything you're missing....
---
No bandos, void, Arma, ahrim's when you're starting out doing Cox???? What gear can we expect to have? Mystic and a slayer staff?? Haha
---
I don't disagree that their voice definitely has an impact on the game, but, I'm definitely not going to fault them if they actually want to have and share an opinion with others, especially if they aren't themselves directly inciting any mob mentality. It's entirely on the viewer, not the streamer, if they act like some white knight for the streamer's opinion of content, instead of forming their own.
---
Bullshit bait, he changed his twitter handler.
---
Now replace the title with "runelite nerds seeing osb players having too much fun with plugins" and everyone here throws a fit
---
yeah even with 3x xp or even more i shudder at the thought of barb fishing to 99 agility
---
The tip is for precision.  The opposite end of this stylus has a normal tip so you can switch between the two
---
Is the Gargoyle Bosses bullshit all over again. Basilisk Knights will become absurdly dead content soon.
---
sry bro not every1 on reddit is a homo
---
1.2m from 2 keys. Not bad
---
they are meant for the high end players. Basilisk still exist you know?
---
Black mask came out a long time ago

If it came out today it would be behind like raids3

Bairly
---
Then take a break if you're that weak.
---
Yeah I agree on everything, I just hope they can get replaced by people that also care about the game :D
---
Idk about that tbh, I've seen tons of guesses about droprate, but without knowing the actual droprate it's hard to tell, and who knows where the Jaw's price goes from here.
---
This is true. If you want to be a normie then go be a normie. Let the neets get a little something something too.
---
No but then I like don't get stuff :( I want stuff! I can get stuff and just wear a silly shirt, right??! GIVE ME STUFFS!!!!!!
---
Delete this post. You are spouting huge bs with this.
---
Someone mentioned that Relics and Rewards used League points. Are these the same currencies?
---
All other slayer helmets are aquired by untradable drops so this doesn't sit well with me. 
---
Also if I'm not mistaken, this will only be available for this one league (2 month period) which sounds absolutely ridiculous to me if correct.
---
just poll it next time?
---
But that’s not what the statement said. It said next attack, demonics plugin tells you what the current attack is
---
you can only hit a 48-48 in a 20 second window after using 4 different pots to boost up.... all you had to do with void range was equip it and wait for your spec bar to fill up.
---
Well of course but a high majority has been doing this
---
Not taking a side with Jagex, but that's Adam's job, not Jagex's.  Adam would be the one contacting Jagex whether x plugin is allowed.  It is his client that has to abide to Jagex's rules, not the other way around.
---
Got my first magic fang on 2116kc.  Sad Ironman, btw.
---
I think they are mainly doing this to keep the value to the jaw higher.
---
Although, a good start would be to make the Knights have more than the current level 60 slayer requirement.
---
Seeing something like this happen because of a small minority complaining has completely taken away my enthusiasm to play the game. Very disproportionate level to reward system on an already recently rare drop (1/750-800 on task). I’m 1500 dry on my iron before the buff to them all on task. So now I have to burn through more points and now use prayer pots at a slower time to kill or I can do them off task for shaman like DWH drop rates for a far more useless item than DWH. The design choices and reaction for this item are so bizarre. How much do I have to donate to streamers to complain to Jagex about DWH drop rate now to get them to make it 1/1k on task. Oh wait most streamers already have that item and we live in a “Fuck you, I got mine” community. The whole situation is more of a fuck you from Jagex than the stupid third party client stance that was “officially posted” which was already the same stance we knew they had.
---
I'm just glad I got in on a day 1 quest. Got the drop over 1k kc and sold for 31m. I'll be happy when it drops and I can get the face guard for cheap.
---
I'm really just happy with new content lol.
---
Im glad you like my interpretation! Means a lot, thank you!!
---
&gt;What does this even mean?
---
Ironman btw?
---
Not that that makes this complaint sensible, when you make an ironman you sign up for things becoming dead content once you get their uniques.
---
Honestly I'm not sure OP is intentionally lying or just doesnt understand the defense mechanics (if he is lying then all of this goes out the window obvy). But belittling someone as part of the 'reddit cancer' is kinda pompous and shitty, which was my point
---
So you think you should only be able to fight people of a similar skill level in the wild?? What the fuck????  
---
How would that even be a metric for this game.  
---
Holy shit people like you are why polling should be removed.
---
Last question in the FAQ on the post from Jagex:
---
&gt;**Q: If I don't compete in this league will I still be able to get the Twisted League rewards in the next league?**  
---
A: You will be able to obtain league rewards from previous leagues using the points you earned. Some of the rewards are also being polled as tradeable so if you don't want to wait until the next league you can always try your luck at buying one. We will not make discontinued rewards with leagues.
---
This seems so cool but please make it to where ironmen can get rewards without having to play it on the ironman account.
---
No shit
---
Because big meaty human fingers.
---
Wouldn't know, I hangout on reddit :/
---
Ironman scape
---
I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a bad reaction to a sudden change of heart on their content. This “update” just made the quest reward dead content. At least The Gauntlet had some relevance for 2-4 weeks, they managed to kill this content in 6 days.
---
👀
---
Everyone who doesn't agree with me is a greasy sweaty nerd XDXd. I fear for the future of this game looking at the posts directed at the buffing of basilisk knights. They were obviously way too easy and a buff was needed.
---
the problem is the devs didn't make the decision, streamers vomited out their opinion and jagex jumped on it like a bitch in heat.  the fact that one streamer spent literally 30 minutes there and got jaw and then complained for 8 hours how easy it was and how easy it is to get is stupid, dude got lucky and instead of continue to kill them he left.  streamers will be the death of the game, content should not be buff'd/nerf'd to fit their chances to getting views.
---
How hard is it to quit and play a harder game.  These 'elite' players play this game 24/7, of course everything's going to seem easy to them.
---
people are also calling them dead because the drop table is so shit -- not to mention the 5x rarer jaw drop off-task which kinda makes no fucking sense for a monster that is (newly) this cancerous.
---
Well, all of them really.  It depends on how intense you want to be, but I wasn't even talking about intensity.  Just the sheer amount of time doing the same movements.  It's like 3000 hours of mouse clicking to max an account or something, and I'd like to do end game content sometime before I die so I have to keep up as high an intensity as I can for as long as I can. 
---
When you're just grinding the game as fast as you can it's all intense.  I've played this game for years and know 90% of the lore and areas so exploration isn't even the fun of the game anymore.  It's the trying to get to the top and become successful.  Don't get me wrong I enjoy the game, but if I'm not intense about it I lose out on more than half the potential gains and I'd be playing for literally 10 years before I could be where I want to be.  
---
So tl;Dr: if you aren't efficient you miss out on a lot.  When you're efficient any grind really sucks.  It's a double edged sword that cuts you either way, unless you're Mr. Settled and love to do extensive grinds which in that case you're a special breed
---
why do, you have, so many, commas?
---
also why do people who sell Ferrari not own them? just because u are selling something doesnt mean you can afford to own one
---
you got god wars specs reskin, thats good enough.
---
Yeah, 6 hours per day to max before the league ends sounds a lot more realistic. Still physically impossible for normal players, but possible for dedicated players with full-time jobs. 10 hours a day locks the achievement behind NEETs and streamers. Two groups that don't need any promotion or ego boost.
---
Pvmers dont want any rewards from pvp lol
---
Spot on lol
---
Just providing more info in case anyone reading who is unfamiliar with BA speedrunning/leeching is curious
---
Mid level monsters shouldn't drop bis.
---
im not sure you know what a boss is..
---
Birdhouses definitely did need nerfed and I think they found a pretty good middle-ground for the konar table. Birdhouses were flooding the game massively with seeds and nests from people making brand new accounts/bots to solely do them, which is ridiculous. Konar's table just never really made sense.
---
I think you've missed the point Sick Nerd was trying to make tbh. His entire point was that the new helm is bis, better than a helm that inarguably is far harder to get. If the Neitiznot Faceguard was only +4 I doubt he would've complained at all. Also from what he said, it sounded like he wanted something akin to demonic gorillas level of difficulty along with a lower droprate (and iirc he didn't even give an opinion on the droprate being better on task).
---
Getting something 10x under drop rate on day 1 and then bitching about how common it is, when the content itself is not tailored towards people in max gear. What a spoiled child.
---
I'm gonna miss you &lt;3
---
Every flip would be lidded.
---
To be fair, most of us came from the original game (now rs3). With that in mind, we let the devs do their job and they wrecked the game beyond recognition. Several times over.
---
I agree that many potentially awesome updates are being shot down, but along with that, many potentially terrible updates are being prevented. We are trying to protect something we love from the entity that has destroyed it once already. If you want a version of the game where the players don't make the decisions, rs3 is always a few clicks away.
---
Rune PlateDADbody

Cute

I’m with you, mate, fuck em. Except I also think this way about the PvP updates. OSRS PvP isn’t gonna be a popular “e-sport,” stop,...

They might add those drops to other creatures around zeah? Come on think a bit.
---
Here's a free tip in argumentation (I play a btw, I can't accept payment): Starting off your post by saying **everyone who disagrees with me is a cumstained smoothbrained NEET they're mean they're bad I'm right I'm right I'm right** is a surefire way to make sure no one will take you seriously. You already pissed the reader off before you even got to your points and arguments.
---
You can literally remove the first sentence of your post and there would be no loss of information. All you added to the conversation was **people who disagree are... uh... BAD!**
---
I really don't get why everyone is so pissed off about this. Can barely pass a +1 from fucking raids but some random slayer mobs dropping BiS is more than fine, it's perfect for you guys. It's not like it's even gonne be dead, you get slayer tasks for it and it has a BiS drop. It's never gonna be dead and it doesn't have to be the place where the entire player base will camp till it's dry because it's that good.
---
FUCKING LMAO
---
The drop table is pretty old school, they're good money when you factor in their unique drop.
---
Not every slayer task should drop a million alchables and 20 noted ores/logs.
---
With the league rank worlds, will those only be accessible for league play or in the main game?
---
His company is 2.5 million in debt irl and a massive baby
---
That's what she said
---
2 hours of GWD is garbage money if you don't get a unique. Same for Abyssal Demons. Same for raids. Should we change all of those loot tables too?
---
Konar is still the best slayer points in the game for hardcores but I'm sure people (not necessarily you) will complain and say Jamflex is catering to ironmen. Not everything has to be incredible, she serves a good niche and works perfectly imo.
---
I mean, I obviously have no proof as it wasn't polled, but I'm willing to wager it would definitely pass.
---
wilderness is a zaros area, not a zamorak so yea your lore is way off.
---
Yep right upon release. Oopsie whooosie with the spaghettis
---
You must be new to osrs. Plenty of things the devs have proposed have been passed and implemented. The one thing I can think of that had decent support but not enough to pass was warding. Could you give some other examples of things “potentially awesome things that wouldn’t make it passed polls”? Because I doubt you can.
---
me reading: heh people who use rs pics for twitter are such nerds
---
then i saw the end of the sentence and i was like o fucc
---
U srs... *logs out*
---
Believe i remember this also.
---
And have RoT own raids 3?
---
Oh I guess you can do that too, I never thought they were worth praying against
---
&gt;i dont know of any monster that does this apart from zulrah and it has killed my countless of times now its incredibly frustrating to lose kills to when you already killed the boss
---
if you stay here long enough you will see that there is one monster that is hated even more for this mechanic 
---
imagine noobs going for their first fire cape,wasting an hour, killing jad and then not getting cape because that mofo had one last hit in him lol
---
Yes that's true, but that being the case there really wasn't anything wrong with how they were on release other than the safespotting.
---
Still better than nothing I suppose
---
Sometimes, yeah. Plenty of times I'd rather chill, skill and watch a TV show than sweat at TOB.
---
barrows? For example, Karil's leathertop [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Karil%27s\_leathertop](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Karil%27s_leathertop)
---
Yo fuck off please
---
Yea too much content in the wilderness either puts you in multi where you have no chance of fighting back against a team, or it puts you in single but you waste your +3/+4 items on specific PvM gear or several inventory slots for the activity (like 6 slots for boxes + chins). It puts you in a prey vs predator situation. 
---
Give some content where you're encouraged to bring the same gear you would bring for PKing, as well as the content making sure you're always filled up on supplies so you're ready for a fair 1 on 1 fight at all times, but you simply risk more wealth the longer you stay doing the activity, and suddenly you have yourself a real good time with some fair PvP fights inbetween doing the content.
---
One example would be if we had a special monster that roams singles areas (the monster could be aggressive or passive depending if we're worried about it affecting the dangers of the wilderness), and it basically emulates a pker. It can heal itself a certain amount of times etc, and it can even perform special attacks and has animations to pull out different weapons and armour. It wouldn't be as dangerous as a real pker, but would encourage you to bring pk gear to tribrid with. The monster could act as if it has a ton of food, making it very slow to kill, but if you manage to spec it out like in a real fight you can kill it much more efficiently. It would also refill your special attack bar after killing it so if a pker is waiting to jump on you, you can fight back right away at full strength. The monster would also drop a bunch of food, restores, a super combat, a range potion etc in addition to whatever loot it has so that you are always ready for a fair fight. The supplies could be a special non-tradable one so that pkers nearby can't use the supplies you got.
---
The monster also helps newer pkers learn how to pk (like someone playing a FPS game against bots for the first time before real players), so they're even more ready to fight back.
---
Yes. You can tell by when you need to flick the jad phase. The damage is calc'd before the projectile appears.
---
Getting tryndamere vibes from the godsword getting dragged along the ground.
---
Nice artwork btw
---
Congratulations!!
---
Is there a certain order you did the quests in? I’m working toward mine right now and I have about 200 QP I’m just not sure what order I should do the rest of the quests in.
---
Actually not the same logic. D med helm is not a UNIQUE reward
---
Your mom works at Denny’s. Boom roasted.
---
Dont forget to mention to buff sea beast after release due to how "ezscape" they can be
---
Time is weird.
---
I double checked. Released Jan 2015, nerfed May 2017, rebuffed Feb 2019. So was at + 3 for almost 2 years, and at +5 for almost 2 1/2.
---
Yep BiS helmet should be 1/4 on task and 1/10 off task. Also should make it afk and drop table AT LEAST equal to hydra. Fucking jamflex. /s
---
Maybe my comment was worded poorly. I have been killing them in maxed str gear on task, and justiciar off task, both pre and post buff to try these monsters out. My request is that a jagex moderator does a single extended task of basilisk knights in mid-level gear and stats, and then explains why they felt the unpolled changes they made were required.
---
Will look you guys up when I get back home tonight. Been looking for a clan to join.
---
Tob isnt sweaty? I watch Netflix and do tob at the same time...
---
And that’s what I do. But they’d have more yes votes from me if I knew what the heck it was.
---
Thank you! We are very welcoming
---
He’s making a point that rooftop and graceful weren’t originally in rs2 while people’s argument to not at t80 is because it wasn’t original. It’s perfectly relevant in this context. 
---
Sounds like you’re the salty one.
---
That's the kind of game RuneScape has always been if you know how to play though. Are you seriously expected to give the game 1500 hours of undivided attention to get a Max cape?
---
What?
---
I pay I afk, remove this unpolled bullshit
---
\&gt; B gloves takes a LOT of effort. 
---
Not remotely.  Plus once you have them you can buy em for pennies.
---
\&gt;I’ve seen plenty of people fail to jad, it’s somewhat of a challenge also lol it’s not best in slot so
---
Its been best in slot for most of the game.  I died to a fire giant two nights ago, doesn't make em challenging.
---
\&gt; Black mask is just a grind and it’s not bis it’s slayer niche 
---
Its bis for slayer.  Slayer is a huge chunk of pvm. Hell, its BIS for \*this\*.
---
\&gt; Zulrah is also a challenge compared to others
---
Pennies pricetag on bp says otherwise.
---
\&gt; dags can be a challenge if you’re tribriding 
---
The best ring (that gives more str than this helmet btw) you can get literally by brainlessly safespotting rex.  You know, that thing people were whining about this about.
---
So
---
We didn't get a 1 hour death mechanic because we wanted it, we got it because of subhuman DDOSers.
---
I was watching Sick Nerd when he did the quest, and got the jaw super under droprate, and when he proceeded to complain for literal hours about it being too common. What scenario was I making up?
---
My thoughts exactly
---
I pay, I afk
---
Oh for sureee. Thank you!
---
Not surprised... same thing happened with the konar update. Slayer was actually monetarily rewarding at medium levels with the exception of slower xp. Well they turned the drop table into shit after a few twitter gods with 99 slayer cried saying it was too easy to make money. Now the drops suck and the xp is still shit, the content was dead in less than a week.
---
There's no difference between the two.
---
a\*b\*c = a(b\*c)
---
Really any objective that offers a way to win besides straight eliminations since that would be too similar to LMS and bring the same bot problems that LMS sees. I figure setting up a bot that prayer flicks + attacks while doing a separate objective would be far more difficult than one that only has to worry about killing and not dying.
---
The objective could be as simple as King of the Hill or something more original and complex. As long as balanced PvP is the core of the game and it isn't prone to bot-infestation, I'm sure it would work.
---
Why wasn’t this polled? Like other feedback changes?
---
How does it not matter if the helm is BIS? Do you actually want power creep?
---
Why was it not polled?
---
What does 65 att unlock? Just the leaf baxe?
---
Already have with Dihns + Entangle update.
---
More need to come. Particularly for purely pvP content such as BH + LMS
---
What gives 120k runecrafting xp in Fossil Island? Been checking the wiki, but couldn't find anything?
---
It won’t work cause they’ll always get streamers to play test for them
---
Good for you I guess, but I and probably most players couldn't do both things at the same time without massively neglecting one of them. If TOB isn't sweaty then nothing in this game is.
---
It’s a fucking point and click game I said remotely challenging compared to other stuff. Nothing in this game is really that hard but I’m using the retrospect of the game overall. Your argument is basically there’s no challenge in this game yet people are bitching about making the jaw harder to obtain lol
---
&gt; There's gotta be some other solution. Seperate PVP/PVM content more? 
---
Skull tricking is a big reason why PvMers don't fight back, which leads to a frustrating experience for them because if they don't want to risk getting skull tricked, they have no course of action available to them besides fleeing. Therefore, they are incentivized to vote against items that increase the offensive capabilities of pkers.
---
Some pkers also engage in trash talking in an attempt to goad people into coming back with gear to seek revenge (that the pvmer will usually lose due to their inexperience). That may increase short term profit for the pker, but that has caused much of the PvM community to develop a hatred for pkers.
---
I'm actually in favor of giving PvMers more tools to defend themselves and removing skull tricking.
---
&gt; If people honestly think this is a sensible solution, then it's really fucking sad that we got to this stage. 
---
The update would have been objectively good for PvMers; the weapons are too expensive to be used against them and increased activity in the PvP community = more resources being consumed = increased value of items PvMers and skillers produce. However, pvmers are too shortsighted to realize that and/or want to get back at pkers for killing them in the past. 
---
Therefore, pkers need to do something to force pvmers to the negotiation table, because right now they control the destiny of pvp updates that won't even affect them. If every Yes voter for the PvP weapons had voted no on the latest Fremmy quest, they would have prevented that quest from getting into the game.
---
Teach your children to play for you
---
r/elsajean for the curious
---
It's their right. Move on. Not only is your idea petty it's impractical
---
I will just say that this is one of the best updates I heard about in a long time. Can't wait.
---
He’s talking to you Lavine
---
Too late
---
Many welcomes
---
poll system will be the death of this game
---
Wack*
---
I was honestly disappointed when I found they were so lame. I was expecting something cool and engaging like demonic gorillas. The drop rate of the jaw can easily be modified to keep it at a similar expected number of hours. The new special is not enough, they are just slower now but not more interesting.
---
atleast twitter wants the game to become better for everyone, meanwhile reddit just wants the game to become easier for themselves.
---
Well I mean Nezzy was bis for a long long time, then serp got a buff and was bis for a little while, and now this new helm is bis
---
l0000000000000l
---
BH and LMS are fine though. It's the cancer Jagex wants to inject into the main game that we collectively told them to fuck off with.
---
All osrs streamers are called Adam, can get confusing :(
---
Stop witch hunting people lmao, I literally voted yes for warding, stop generalizing so hard. 
---
I just didn't like one update, believe it or not I don't always get my way because I'm a streamer, ALOT of people didn't like this update, not just me. 
---
I was also saying that Basalisk knights were boring before I got the drop, because they are, I don't think the buff was correct, but it should've happened, just differently.
---
Obviously taking a boring monster and adding more defence &amp; hp isn't going to make it more interesting, but keep using me as a scapegoat for this trainwreck anyway.
---
Meric did some research into it and he tweeted at support like 3 years ago and his name was in his twitter name at the time.
---
Great! These rewards are way better than offering cash prizes.
---
Agreed, please don’t let this game turn into Destiny.
---
It's fun!
---
The task is still completely afk able why are people complaining.  Just pray mage and use the door to range
---
I just hope they call it "twisted robes" and not "twisted ancestral robes". The latter sounds like a handful to me.
---
Dude what. If they were untradeable you would have to earn them... by playing leagues. As it is right now you don't have to play leagues, you can just earn them with dough. Go read the blog.
---
Okay so people would use fighter torso instead of bcp and nobody would use armadyl cuz it's barely better than black d hide and prims are like 30m for +1 str lol. Nobody would use ancestrial cuz you need 2 pieces for 1 max hit. Why would this make the game better again?
---
This is referring to the mixed opinion of the community when Jagex buffed the new monster they released last week when higher level players complained it was too easy.
---
The main argument for both sides is:
---
Higher level-" Its BiS helmet it shouldnt be easy to get for the reasons all the other BiS arnt easy to get."
---
Mid level- " It was voted in for mid level content on a mid level quest and voting retroactively after max levels players grinded it out for a week only making it harder for us is lame."
---
At least thats my grasp on it.
---
I haven’t been back to Fight Caves since beating Jad (don’t have time or supplies). Do people have dozens of fire capes from beating him so many times?
---
You must be blind then because people are constantly complaining about resources coming from bossing or slayer. 
---
You're getting 3-5k Hunter and 3-4k farming XP per run on top of the GP you're getting from the nests for absolutely no effort at all.
---
Skilling could do with more money makers but a ln activity that can barely be considered skilling is not the way to do it. It's already made Hunter much easier and farming much quicker, it doesn't need to be an insane money maker at the same time.
---
Yeah I’ve only ever used Konar for hydras and points boosting on my iron. She’s trash.
---
But crashing emblem farms tho
---
Every thread.
---
Shamans are not afkable though, thats all they wanted to do with the new basilisks.
---
I’m 99 slayer and I still only boss on slayer tasks. For me, I only viewed the nezzy helm useful for training and pking, and the slayer helm was used everywhere else. But if course it depends on play style.
---
where
---
You have a real job and are playing fort nite? Wtf lol you’re definitely the oldest person I know who plays that game
---
how’s it feel being a celebrity on this sub?
---
woosh
---
Yea, but is it that big of a difference? Just checked and I got it at 110kc, im sure the odds of either were astronomical at that point...
---
Options:
---
-Abyssal Accumulator
---
You save 80% of your ammunition and runes.
---
Endless Endurance
---
-Your run energy drain-rate is reduced to 0 and your prayer drains at half the speed.
---
Dark Altar Devotion
---
-Bones dropped by creatures are automatically buried and award 4 times the experience. Ensouled heads now drop two at a time.
---
So they used the poll to assess the problem of spite voting, and well, yeah there's now hard evidence spite voting tanks the PvP polls. I'm not sure about forcing them as QoL but for sure they won't be polled as they were previously.
---
Really glad Jagex took a stand against this plugin. Most of the plugins they "banned" were from recent osbuddy updates. This has been a plague on rl for awhile. If you want the money from killing a mini boss, then actually learn the mechanics, don't have an engine do half the work.
---
I get where you're coming from but I'm glad it's not much of a higher slayer level, it being mostly a quest requirement to get keeps it more consistent with the other fremenik helms
---
you should see the passive on the cool ranch one, its op
---
its a meme you dip
---
All of my friends play it. It’s actually really fun if you have a quality squad. We’re all in our 20s, 30s
---
Honestly yes a unique mechanic is fine. Idk if the extra max hit and hp was necessary, but I'm all for more interactivity.
---
I can see your point on this, but at the same time, community polling is how this game started and I like to think it's necessary to vote on almost everything that comes in. If it's not an integrity kind of thing, POLL IT. I'd rather see the game stay the same with all polls coming in no - basically the community saying keep it the same, than updates coming in with no input from the community and following a path of RS3 or some similar catastrophic event.
---
Yeah don't go placing yourself above them now champ
---
What would you suggest? Quitting might work and from the RS3 playercount alot have and I don't blame them for it. But is it unreasonable to pay for a game and expect some agency in the games direction instead of being milked dry on MTX and fake statements. Interested to see your opinions on this.
---
Lol welcome to the pvp community this your first time
---
Correct me if I'm wrong as I'm not and have never been into PvP however wasn't PvP very much alive when we had Chaotics/Turmoil/Storm of Armadyl/Vesta's/Statius'? Wouldn't these give higher max hits than what we have now?
---
I know Bandos and Arma wasn't on OSRS on release, however they were copied and pasted from content released in 2007.
---
I'm not denying there is some power creep. I just find it amusing that we are still have BIS gear that is gained from a mid level boss that was originally in the game in 2007.
---
Excited for those relic buffs above all else. They seem sick.
---
I was literally thinking the other day that I'd like to make a catacomb-locked HCIM with the goal of killing Skotizo and Sarachnis from scratch. Looks like I'll be doing exactly that in this mode!
---
I don't get why you're getting downvoted comments about it. They could at least voice their opinion.
---
I agree, the time with summon and dungeoneering right before EoC was great. The only people complaining have 5 alts and don't want their max capes to either go away from a new skill or because new content changes meta. It's the same reason I hear quest cape people say they don't want new quests. I also don't get why we can't pass a skill for crafting magic armor or rework the mining/smithing like RS3 did. Why the hell do I need like 65 smith to make gear I can wear at 20 def and buy for like 10min of stealing silk.
---
Wow! Can't wait to see more!
---
Maybe 3 was a little low? 10? All with ancient maces and spears.
---
Who provides that feedback? I haven't seen it polled. 
---
GWD is fun, has multiple chances at high value drops, and can be done in a group. You can use guthans, b2p and blood spells to heal to extend trips. 
---
Basilisk knights are boring, have one drop that will not stay at 30m and cannot be done in a group. You cannot use the same healing options available to you in GWD because you must use a mirror shield, resulting in a heavier drain in supplies. Was this not meant to be med-level content? 
---
Look at the Serp helm. the only reason that retained its value was because of the implemented dismantle for scales option.
---
if basilisk knights are not meant to be med level content, please come out and say so and update the requirements to match the newly buffed creatures.
---
I'm dying from cancer my dudes
---
Tell him about OpenRS
---
It drops a 25m item. That’s fucking ridiculous.
---
They despawn in 15 seconds. Unless you're watching your screen all the time, or have third party client notification enabled, you will miss it.
---
Cave Horrors should have a jad phase, increase their attack speed to 1 tick and quadrupling their hp, to ensure that only the real slayer masters get a chance at the 1/10000 black mask also it'll be 5x rarer off task.
---
I think it's necessary to vote on the details of updates more than the concepts of them, at least with large updates. Leagues is a good example.
---
But after 99 slayer I’ve went for more end game pvm like raids Corp and GWD which I can’t really do on task, and when I’m meleeing these ill be using the jaw and the helm. 
---
Niche means something specific so what’s more niche an apple slicer, or a knife?
---
An apple slicer is great for slicing and apple, and better at slicing the apple than the knife. However the knife is better at cutting just about everything else, hell I could shank somebody, open a bag that’s giving me trouble, I could carve a tree with it. I can’t do that stuff with the apple slicer, but the apple slicer is best for slicing an apple, this makes it niche. 
---
The slayer helm is best for slayer, the jaw can be used in every other melee situation. Get it now?
---
That sucks dude. Don't think you're the driest though, think I've seen 3 or 4k kcers without claw
---
You’ve gotta be really casual to play on and off 3 *years* and not be at least close man.
---
“Some scribbles”
---
Sick piece my friend.
---
I suppose Prif has always been there, just never accessible.
---
As far as I'm concerned this Prif is dead content to me. There is nothing there that I've had to use yet, don't know what everyone else's take on it is.
---
what's openrs? is it like a more op version of runelite?
---
I know most the talk is about the basilisk update, but for all the mobile players out there, the ability to resize the position of the toolbars is a really nice feature.
---
This picture smells like axe body spray, spilled monster energy and boof weed
---
No, they remove a death penalty. That's not QOL, that's risk changing.
---
What? They were in the game for years before EOC
---
run craft bad slayer good you may now laugh
---
What’s openrs?
---
I didn't think this was a surprising thing :P
---
Hey bud I think you got the wrong door, Tutorial Island is 3 blocks down.
---
This sounds absolutely amazing. Definitely going to try and get some old buddies to play this.
---
This is just going to be Mithril Dragons 2: Fremmenik Boogaloo.
---
One pricy item does not make a task worth it without max setup.
---
You forgot to add an excessive amount of dust in that accurate description
---
Bazongi
---
True 15-20 quests required, but to be fair they're all pretty easy with fairly low requirements. Personally before this update I was fine with their difficulty but wasn't against a buff, I mainly just wanted the slayer level requirement to be increased because 60 is pretty low for a helmet that'll likely be BIS for years. And yes, you can bypass getting one yourself by just buying the jaw, but the difficulty in acquiring it directly affects its cost. For being better than serp in most places without degrading either, I want it to be very expensive and stay that way, because items kinda lose their magic if everyone's got one.
---
As exciting as this suggestion is, they will never add PvP content into the game. They will always fail polling. And jagex won't do a thing about it.
---
What is the point of even expressing this?
---
To be fair the slayer helm is still a pretty good choice for things like cox, zulrah, etc.
---
Items that are literally pvp only are weird
---
No matter how good they are they wont actually cost much and dont add to 90% of the game
---
I dont want pvp only items for the same reason i dont like the idea of different combat math being used in the wilderness
---
I gotta check something.
---
What part of Virginia you from? I've got friends in Richmond.
---
20 capes, and they have to be "TRUE" capes that you only gain if you don't use Justiciar armor and/or Twisted Bow
---
At least give cave horrors a projectile that is a guaranteed one-shot so people cant just "afk" for a mask!
---
that sucks bro, giving it another go?
---
basilisk jew
---
No thanks.
---
Yea true, I think its hard to measure the number of people *Not* going to an event and red shirts show them a message that they can easily see. Also I think that Runefest remains an important interface between Jagex and its community and without it communication would be much worse. Perhaps I am being naive and saying that supporting Jagex with Runefest and other things that the playerbase enjoys is better than spending it on MTX. They'll probably just increase MTX to offset the loss from runefest if people boycott anyway. Just my two cents.
---
Or they can switch to OpenRS lol
---
CCCCCCCCHESTBRAH
---
Thank you for the support
---
This is me currently getting b gloves lmao
---
Or just pay 25k.  
---
Literally 1 kill.  
---
No need to juggle food.
---
No need to deal with idiots.  
---
Peace and quiet in anti-socialscape
---
this is actually a great idea, I could see a lot of people playing that
---
i hope she smashes me with that big baguette
---
Can we please get the slayer points refunded that we spent to unlock basilisk tasks from Duradel? I didn't sign up for this, I unlocked it before the buff...
---
 🦀  🦀  🦀 Privacy 🦀  🦀  🦀
---
Nah that's a roadman not a Russian
---
no u
---
Then maybe they get drawn in and play it, attracting them in would be the point.
---
I think I read that jagex is going to update the gauntlet to add more variety.
---
So you've just listed a few spots where even to very high level players it has its place. Saying tbow makes it not useful is applicable for fg as well 
---
Because let's be honest, where is fg useful as the best/obvious option? Maybe dks cos prayer bonus and tribrid benefit, it's a solid option at Cox, especially if you wanna avoid helm swaps because of tribrid benefit again, ToB it's pretty good.
---
But where else? Everywhere else you're always on task so use a slayer helm, or tbow beats melee setups so you use ranged gear.
---
&gt;PVP is not fun, this is objective truth
---
&gt;PKers never fight other PKers in the wilderness
---
Peak Reddit.
---
I guess rune is a bad example, perhaps I should have said berserker helm back before isles quest was released!
---
Gz!  You're still forced to do like 3k kc to get scales for CoX and stuff, but this helps you progress with the game without having to get choked on 2k dry.
---
Gl with the entire game opening up!
---
Level 115 with 32 rc. I’m doin it for the helm
---
True but will stick to my opinion that an empty world is fair game.
---
Sorry for your difficulties dealing with this, but no. You need to get past this brother. Be strong, dismiss that motherfucker with the power of your left click.
---
So they added this as a "work around" kind of thing to fix the bug that this poor dude encountered:
---
 https://twitter.com/StaunchOSRS/status/1130774775192645632?s=20 
---
God Ash implemented this.
---
What if he is an Asian chick?
---
Damn Zezima must’ve gotten cleaned in the sand casino
---
Disagreeing with you = being bitter, playing more than 30min per day on a game = all day, guess that's how that is for you.
---
Me need slay content me skill to slay better
---
I'm with you on that, no rank worlds. You shouldn't get reduced resource competition in one league for placing higher in a previous one.
---
What the fuck are you even on about?
---
The hypocrisy of you is unbelievable, you're trying to preach some spiritual bs whilst simultaneously trying to insult someone in the same post lmao. Get a grip kid and just solve the basic puzzle instead of crying and failing to insult people on Reddit.
---
Regarding rewards and their 'rarity', I have alternative suggestions to offering all past-rewards every league:
---
* Offer them only during a 'legacy'/'flashback' type league that runs only once or twice a year.
---
* Offer previous rewards if their respective league ended X+ months ago.
---
* Offer previous rewards only if there is a thematic/region overlap.
---
I mean for a bis helm it sounds reasonable to make it challenging with little benefit to not flood the eco with new helms.
---
FUCK
---
you need to add a way to get trident for raids

While I don't agree with the comparisons to abyssal demons as in the time they came out rs was very different I do agree this update was bullshit. This should have been polled at least. Instead they cater to a handful of retards who got their lucky jaws and feel like screwing everyone else over.
---
Tbh 2500 sara brews is a bit much as a drop no matter how you slice it.
---
According to the progression system, its 92.
---
A fork of Runelite with plugins that the Runelite dev banned.
---
You're dumb as fuck. Got it.
---
I mean it's just a slow grind, I was in uni for pharmacy for 4+4 years, while working, and while having a gf. I still afk trained when I could, i did the content available to me, i didn't cry when i couldn't get bis drops, snd  i felt genuinely rewarded when i learned higher level content. Level 60 slayer is ~270k xp that's literally nothing in the scope of runescape that's shouldn't be the level to add a biz helmet at
---
3x is just the base rate, more comes from relic. They may also increase the base rate more later, once other parts are locked down then they can test balance.
---
If this had gone to a poll I would have wanted it voted into oblivion, partially due to the vagueness it was presented with and conflicting information.
---
Now? I think this is very promising, definitely not for me so probably won’t partake, but I think this is a strong addition to the game, very happy
---
Only if you make the drop rate lower off task, we can’t make it too easy now
---
Spite votes even killing QoL updates that help PvMers; we did it Reddit!
---
Dog just called the slayer helm niche lmfao. How many slayer helms do you see a day vs serp/neit. Delete this nephew.
---
Yeah. I'm confused why there's backlash as well, which is why I thought I would explain the lore. I think people would just rather it were more challenging to get the robes? But it's not like this is some bis new mage gear. It's mid level mage gear that should come from a mid level source. If anything Larran's chest is a more diverse reward system than adding yet another boss.
---
I don't know for certain how max hits compare, but I think I recall hearing that DDS has the same max now as it did in pre-eoc.
---
Also, SoA was absurdly busted and people hated having it in pvp.
---
Why do you have to carry it?  Just use it.
---
he had fun with friends, things that are both foreign concepts to you
---
their version of feedback is that greaseball sicknerd crying on twitch for 2 hours
---
If it's not worth it to do, then people will keep them locked on the way to 99, so they aren't a good addition for diversity on the way to 99 like you suggested. Which is bad game design if you want to add stuff people want to interact with. They don't need to inflate xp rates, but they need to be somewhat worth doing.
---
I guess if we're strictly talking about doing BKs on task, then getting a jaw with a 1/800ish drop rate on task makes them decent money-wise even if the reg drops are about 4.7k avg and they aren't very good xp. If you're unlucky and can't get a task, then they kinda suck.
---
I'm lonely, I just want friends :(
---
If basilisks were treated like actual basilisks, then I can see a mechanic where you're forced to entangle them and kill them from afar.
---
On top of that, why not also allow us to give our equipment special effects with engineering?
---
The problem is that the second one IS what we voted for. If mid level content shouldn't have a bis helm then they should have saved the drop for the final fremmy quest.
---
having in mind all the accounts will be ironmen saving runes/ammo will be a huge deal tho
---
You weren’t disagreeing, you came out the gate talking shit about people that aren’t end game. It’s really not a big deal to me though. Who plays in 30 minute sessions? It’s more like you get back into the swing of things for a few months and fall out again and repeat over time. Anyways have fun, it’s just a game.
---
Not sure why anyone would be surprised by this. This exact plugin was pointed out specifically in the unofficial client blog as one of the ones Jagex doesn't approve of. It was only a small matter of time before it was removed.
---
Ye when you look at a snippet from like a 10 hour stream
---
What is the end goal here? Seems cox is really the only end goal. You can't even properly(not lamps and weird round about methods train half the skills. What bosses are there outside cox? What is the point of training your skills? Not much outside things to help with cox. They took away a whole lot of possible game play by limiting it to cox.
---
Fair enough, some people will like this but I hope other seasons aren't so restricted and don't take out half of the fun(the new economy and carving out niche's within that economy by being a specialized crafter, smither, pvmer, slayer etc.).
---
Damn bro bring it out! Way more money to be made ragging 1750s pvmers and pkers than looting. Just from the kill pics I've seen on disc(1659 total lvl D:) 
---
Glad to see your a man of culture as well! Plex got very upset when I followed him from edge bank to the Waka canoe saying he's a shit planker cuz he can't afford rev teles! Lol, dude uses adamant or rune axes as well even though a bronze axe works the exact same.
---
Best of luck, I hope the bh update goes well. Stackable looting bags would be dope. Cant tell you how many times I've died cuz I dropped/ate a bunch of food to pick up loot then died because I didn't have food to tank.
---
Hahahahaha get fucked loser, learn to play the game.
---
Hah! What loser doesn't know how to dance to dubstep?
---
No but literally everyone just stands there at those concerts. At the massive ones everyone just jumps. May as well start including all edm in the "braindance" genre.
---
Wow i got mine in under 200 kc
---
That's fair. But if it's pure cosmetic I guess it doesnt matter either way to me.
---
Fair point. Are there rune/arrow shops on Zeah? I don't know the area too well tbh
---
They should make a quest from this!
---
Some quit, majority just don’t get their contracts renewed. 
---
In terms of the contracts, as a player base we keep saying no to content. This means they don’t have work to complete, this means that all those people aren’t required, contracts don’t get renewed.
---
Yes, duh
---
Im not very experienced so idk about the weapons themselves
---
But having pvp-only weapons would make the pvp vs pvm divide even bigger
---
Youre not even close to halfway done any skill and youre complaining you wont be able to farm an end game boss? This might not be the grind for you lol
---
Level 60 isn't mid tier its 270k xp, that's literally nothing in the scope of runescape
---
I'm just as butthurt about the Basilisk Knights being another TBow mob as you are, but this applies just as much to Reddit- if not more- as it does to Twitter and streamers (particularly Sick Nerd in this case).
---
Most recent case in point- the ability to own multiple rune pouches and looting bags was shot down by Reddit spite voters that don't bother to read the questions, even though it's a QoL update that PvMers would have very much appreciated, even outside of the wilderness. This subreddit also tends to think that it comprises 100% of the playerbase, when the latest poll seems to indicate it's around 20% at best.
---
Slayer helm was added in 2014 to OSRS.
---
When this idea was initially presented, I was skeptical, but open to the concept.  I have to admit, after this blog I am a lot more comfortable with the idea and like the rewards thus far.
---
I’m still curious about the Relics ... once unlocked/claimed are they just for *that* individual league, or are they unlocked for *all future leagues*?
---
Yeah i think people are upset because not  every new thing is getting a massive fanfare and new quest with it
---
Literally, your demented, you need to learn how to give constructive criticism like an adult instead of like a shit faced little 18 year old fuck.
---
Seriously grow the fuck up and act your age, you literally came into this thread with a problem off the bat, your literally fucking upset about me trying to talk to the community and talk to other's in regards to current updates.
---
What did you say again?
---
"blah blah blah people go without blah blah blah, don't let the door hit you on the way out!".
---
Gl in life there bud, when things don't go your way, its everyone else's problem, everyone else caused it right? Gl mate. 
---
You also refer to me as kid repeatedly and stuff? Literally are you capable of holding a normal conversation on a keyboard? or do you got sometype of keyboard Aspergers?
---
Hopefully when leagues come out his content will get more exciting to watch
---
Unpolled change but why?
---
Blows my mind people actually think we needed a slayer update in the first place. How many this year?
---
thats trash too
---
I have. Those disgned princeaples work when you have end game gear less then 100m. We have gear 1B+. Come back to me when you manage to farm 1B from Abby demons.
---
I'm so glad someone else said this. I block every single one I see. They are the worst (technically good) osrs players out there.
---
It’s more damage and it heals you. Less time healing = more time dps’ing.
---
This is some entitled sounding shit right here
---
not gonna lie, no idea who’s supposed to be the asshole here because you’re both being such incredibly whiny bitches
---
Or more obviously, just buy the helm.
---
Big brain thinking here.
---
But they give a mittens magic discount
---
Honestly, why do you care?
---
a buff that needed to happened, too.   
---
I saw one comment\\post about how the dude had to actually use pots for an extended task (!!!!) the horror.
---
Absolute beast - would totally recommend getting elite void
---
ok then play the game, if youre actively playing you'll also get to max combat pretty easily in 3 years. this is an ALTERNATIVE for people who have limited time, or dont want to do other methods.
---
1 star lmao. Great pay for little work is at least a 3 in my book
---
Congratulations sir on being the dumbest person on this sub for the day.
---
If he wasn't before, losing his void would have definitely made him a spite voter
---
Like I said... if you’ve been playing casually for 3 years you should be above base 85s. Even if you play an hour a day on average.
---
I didn't sell anything to anyone. Guys, If I had done something wrong, I would not be asking for help, but I did nothing wrong, please ask them to help me. I know I can only create another account, but it bothers me that it has been banned for a reason that does not even have to do. I appreciate that account, don't let it die unfairly.
---
Congrations to ur wizdom
---
So you don’t reach 500? I don’t fletch and can get to ~650 easily, especially with a lot of relighting the brazier
---
those are my next goals!
---
The hour a day was literally just making a point, I haven't actively played in a long time and even when I did I didn't spend that much time on RS per day because I was in University but it really is just easy to level in OSRS.
---
He hasn't made a video in like 2 months and i dont watch twitch much so i never know what hes up to
---
Lookin great tho
---
USA USA USA USA
---
:(
---
it worked poorly, extremely buggy and unsecured
---
Read the full thing. It says "As we’ve said, this is not an exhaustive list, and we reserve the right to add features to this list in future. We’ll continue to monitor community concerns about other specific features and offer more clarity if it’s needed." followed by "However, we don’t want players to be left in constant fear of possible bans, so we’ll give advance warning if any additional features are being considered for the list."
---
That means the list doesn't contain everything but they will add it to the list before it is bannable. They won't ban players for plugins that aren't on the list without warning. The guideline mentioned is only what is unacceptable; what is bannable is what is on the list. If features like the ones OSB highlights here are unacceptable, they will be added to the list before they start banning players. Simple as that.
---
As for the ground item plugin and loot tracker, it is a stretch to say they are against the rules because you don't have to right click to see items. If a whip is on the floor, I can visually see that already; a plugin that adds the name wouldn't break the guideline because a click is not required. Same for a loot tracker; you can get ingame loot notifications so you can already know every drop without seeing it.
---
Sentinel @ 274 (range/crush) vs Graardor @ 340 (anything but mage) is 100% more defense? Is that how defense levels work?
---
slayer bosses defo regular monsters maybe like high lvl mobs with alot of hp like adamant dragons or rune dragons idk but dds works fine at those if u dont have dragon hunter lance/xbow

missing the point lol
---
Elitism? You’re joking right? I’m just being honest and I’m not saying he’s bad because he’s low CBL. I’m just saying he should be higher if he played even an hour a day average for 3 years.
---
To be fair you risk nothing as a pure. You can always learn, everyone had to at some point. Its discouraging to start but not a big deal if each death is &lt;100k tbh
---
Of course you are, I ask all the time too. There's just no reason to make this game easier than it already is. It's such a simple thing to just see the bird nest and pick it up
---
Lol I thought they were actually fun.  Fuckin hate them now.
---
It's only 30 m because it's hard to get, it should be around 1 m
---
Wow this is amazing well done buddy
---
Abberant spectres are an entirely different thing. You pray mage and take 0 damage. And they're fast to kill.
---
Knights are slow to kill, deal decent melee damage even against a maxed melee main, require constant prayer, and now have an attack that slows your kills more if you don't dodge it.
---
They're a 60 slayer monster. You need that to be able to kill them. 55 RC is a joke as well, that's a few hours without even taking into account that most have quested and lamped and tears'd their level past that easily. It's still a low req.
---
Lol No Mercy I love it 🔥 video
---
Because it's the same problem. Degraded stuff never rewards what it should. It's slightly under half a weapon at the maximum all the way down to a single shard.
---
When we could have a system like revenant ether for the wildy weapons. Where they need to be charged to a bare minimum. A system that was actually designed with the wilderness in mind. Unlike every other degradable in the game has been.
---
People take breaks. My account is only two years old and it's barely into the 70s because I had to start putting more time into my work and most days I don't get time to play at all.
---
"I need to acquire spade" - every pker ever.
---
How about we just lock all slayer monsters at 99 slayer? Seems only fair to me
---
Didn’t berate you lmao
---
You asked why you couldn’t go back and change a slayer task to a completely different slayer task (tzhaar vs jad), comparing it to dropping an untradable, one use, item and later reclaiming it to use. 
---
They are so damn different, that comparing them is fucking silly. 
---
Maybe your IQ isn’t low but your comment lacked basic critical thinking. If you thought about your comment, and thought “yeah, this is a good thing to say, this is a valid point”, then yeah, maybe your IQ is a bit lower than the average. 
---
But to comment about me berating you...and equating me calling your dumbass out to me also having a shit life? Jesus Christ dude get a grip.
---
Thanks for watching 😁
---
60 slayer is a drop in the bucket of 99 slayer or maxing. You train combat stats while doing it and it's bloated as fuck with tons of bonuses, bis gear, task-only bosses, konar keys, wildy keys (that are *still* getting buffed, see: dagon'hai robes), emblems (soon to be removed though) etc. Balancing decisions should not be made around level 60 slayer when that's a whopping 2% of the total xp to 99.
---
Stfu
---
It is. OP just didn't know it and has been runecrafting with the lamp :D
---
Maybe he didn't play an hour a day lol, maybe he had better things to do than play an mmo. And "bad" lol. Runescape isn't exactly a high mechanical skill game.
---
If twisted bow doesn't exist and melee meta is back serp would be a costlier and better choice in a lot of situations because the +1 strength doesn't offer a max hit, and the defensives, poison immunity and venom damage easily outweigh +3 prayer bonus, which does nothing if you're flicking.
---
Maybe you need to learn to read and/or use a dps calc.
---
Dwh?
---
Although I agree f2p has some really bad aspects, such as the mass bots. There's no denying that f2p players are needed. People aren't always willing to invest money into a game without first trying it, hence why almost every major AAA game company do BETAs, so people can try the game before paying money for it.
---
Could have just stayed 60 if all you wanted was to bully pures.
---
They're only best in slot for range and that might not even be true soon
---
Well you basically took a mid level slayer monster and made it so you need super high stats to actually kill it effectively. Why even gate it behind 60 slayer at this point lol?
---
I would love to make an ironman pker, but holy shit that's time consuming and I hate questing/pvming/skilling enough, can't imagine having to get my own resources everytime without a grand exchange 😫
---
what's the point then?
---
It depends on order. If bp existed and then tbow and slayer helmet were added, the slayer helmet would be the better item. The order matters because slayer helmet scales based on items.
---
Yeah I noticed a disclaimer at the bottom of the blog that these would not be discontinued rewards. I maintain the belief that the rewards should be untradeable though.
---
not all i want to do but yeah i know lol
---
Getting the existing playerbase to play the game in new ways. For a game to which it is notoriously difficult to attract (and keep!) new players, this is the future in my opinion :-)
---
Don't you dare add dildos to red slayer helms cheeks.
---
Not a bad idea overall, just some design considerations
---
With a funny title
---
Thank you very much! I can do a personal commission for a price depending on what you were looking for (send me a pm), but if it’s just an idea you wanted to throw out there, just post it on this thread and maybe you’ll see it in the future. I’m always looking for inspiration!
---
Time to graduate kids...  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/)
---
The defense bonuses don't add.
---
If you want to calculate what the equivalent defense would be with +0 bonus it's:
---
[(Def +8 ) (Bonus +63) / 63 ] - 8
---
So 250 with +90 bonus is equivalent to 618 defense with +0
---
Wow rude
---
Well it's named master for a reason :)
---
run craft because run needed to craft mind blown
---
You have two design routes:
---
A) All task add +1 point, so the dumb ones are skipable (250 raids, dwh hammer drop, maxing, skilling pet, omlet with dust..).
---
B) The dumbest tasks give exponentially more points in an attempt to match the exponential extra work they take
---
With option A) casual players will have heavier weight at creating these uniques than the top 10% of bottle-pissing lads
---
With option B) if points are exponential as the task work, few will create most of the cosmetics
---
All those things were OP and so was this.
---
You plebians think you guys are all knowing with your mid-level accounts and think that somehow your opinions should weigh as much as streamers who play osrs professionally with thousands of hours clocked.
---
You don't know the number of jaws that came into the game.
---
There's a reason jagex mods take in faux, sick nerd, b0atys opinion. It's because they literally helped build the game up to what it is currently.
---
Who the fuck are you.
---
I’m more on the side that the game should be fun and not pandering to only end game players when basilisk knights were fine
---
I know that is what it said, but when I claimed my Varrock Medium lamp, it also let me get the Easy lamp that I had dropped long ago. 
---
[Those are literally the only two lamps I ever got on my pking main](https://i.imgur.com/kqNoMxV.png) so the memory is pretty clear.
---
But then the boss would have to have a low max hit. Otherwise you're taking 3 hitsplats per attack, since it would be insanely easy to get combo'd out, and that's just awful design.
---
If you want damage to go through protects to want incentivize tanking, then you just need typeless damage that's not reduced by protects but the accuracy of the hit is reduced by armor, similar to Nomad.
---
&gt; to keep serp bis
---
And this is why your opinion is weighted in a bias. You want the serp to remain the best option in all circumstances except slayer task. 
---
Faceguard doesn't offer a max hit in all situations, and doesn't have the same defence stats as serp or poison immunity or venom damage. So it hasn't even entirely trumped a 5 year old item.
---
And zulrah is easy mate, just because it was hard for you doesn't mean it's hard. You can build an account from scratch to Zulrah ready very quickly, and 75 mage 75 range is stupidly easy to do it at those levels. I did my diary kill all those years back with those stats and downed it first try. 
---
So no I don't think faceguard is badly designed, I think your stuck in a mindset of wanting a low req old boss to continue dropping bis melee helm for anything off task, alongwith a heavily used near bis range weapon and the old bis mage weapon.
---
Nobody forced any change, but having best in slots come from an afk monster when it could have come from a different source is dumb as hell (one of the frequent rhetorics of jagex is it's hard to find rewards for pvm bossing/raids, and they waste a potential one on an afk slayer monster)
---
Name any spot you'd use a serpentine helm over the nezzy.
---
nice logic
---
Hover over the combat styles  it will show you what damage type they use (Lunge is Stab, everything else is Slash) as well as what experience they give.
---
However, Arclight has a much higher slash bonus (+38) compared to stab (+10) so you'd be better off using slash anyway.
---
The xp/hr difference between granite cannonballs vs normal cannonballs is on the order of 3%. I tested this less than a week ago while grinding out 99 slayer. Only *the* most efficiency-obsessed people would bother buying them and 30gp is a fairly generous fraction of the cost of a cannonball comparable to its relative increase in max hit.
---
nobody in their right mind would kill them for money once they drop below 10m. so it will rise again. its called economics.
---
I wish my scribbles looked 1/10000th is good. Practice makes... and all that bullshit but you have real talent. I really like your style and although the background isn’t detailed I really like its menacing vibe. Beautiful piece and would love for you to post more. Thanks for sharing and further thanks for not having to include a sob story about how your dog just got done battling her 8th bout of chemo.
---
D
---
I remember reading through the thread and he got roasted by the dozen posts i saw at the time.
---
🦀🦀🦀JAMFLEX IS POWERLESS AGAINST NECKBEARD DEMANDS 🦀🦀🦀
---
Literally revert the changes, make it so you cant safespot, and make it so they ignore prayer/sometimes defense. Now they arent as afkable but still doable without wanting to kill yourself.
---
nope, i used a max hit calc, max hit increase of 1 over helm so about 2%, op af. nerf justified. pack your bags, guys, its over!
---
the serpentine helm can do significantly more upwards of 20% more dps than what this helm will give. suffice to say, it doesn't work on certain bosses, but over the serpentine, the +1 str is negligible, not even worthy of a rational (mathematical) increase in max hit.
---
yea it would be neat everyone in mystics and magic shortbows again lol
---
So you need a 40m weapon as a mid level with 60 Slayer to do it efficiently.
---
Mate, your post history says it all.. 
---
You deserve to be muted, there is always evidence on a mute and you refuse to share it.
---
You keep purposefully misunderstanding my comments just to be a jerk.
---
dragonstone is used if you expect them to not have antifire protection. Usually in higher stakes fights they will be
---
*trips you with snake tail because you murdered their king*
---
Fremenik Trials is a 30 minute quest that introduced a new BiS and made the previous BiS,rune full helm worthless.
---
Fremenik Isles is a 30 minute quest that introduced a new BiS and makes berserker helm obsolete.
---
The Fremenik Exiles is a 30 minute quest and retards keep shitting their pants about it.
---
Serpentine works on literally no meta bosses.
---
MMOs are traditionally competitive like this, RuneScape is no different. If you can't compete for a spot, find a different one.
---
looks like she’s taking him out of the wilderness, not in

I love watching c engineer gank people on his pvp hardcore lol
