Ash has split from the team and now runs his own private server

hope you don't plan on BH pking because BH is dead past 90 combat, at peak time there's like 5 people.
---
Even with one in like 10 000 ppl being that dumb the average kill value won't probably even cover barrage/pot costs. Why do people have such hard time admitting that they just get enjoyment out of annoying other players?

lmao voting no takes less time then reading this shit so yea kid its gonna be a big YIKES xD lmao memereddit73 and no vote from me.

The only thing that would make this better is if you were a HCIM

A Spade is a multi-functional tool in RuneScape. One of its major uses is in the Farming skill, though it also comes in handy on many quests and Treasure trails (clues). They are sold in farming shops and an infinite supply can be gained in your house by making a Tool store 2 at 25 Construction. Alternatively, they can be derived from a Rogue kit.
---
Some general stores stock them:
---
Lletya
---
Lighthouse
---
Shilo Village
---
Tai Bwo Wannai
---
Little Shop of Horace (Hosidius)
---
Also, spades spawn in the following places:
---
Falador's Estate agent building
---
Rimmington mine
---
Upstairs of Varrock's general store
---
Inside Draynor Manor, in the easternmost room on the ground floor
---
Lumbridge Swamp shed (entrance to Zanaris)
---
Blast Furnace
---
2 spades in the hut by the Barrows entrance
---
In Edmond's garden (East Ardougne)
---
In the sheep's pen to the west of the saltpetre mines in Zeah
---
Spades have had many appearances in holiday events.
---
A spade is also used to gain entrance to Barrows.
---
Thanks for not reading my comment.
---
'just buy 5k glass' nobody who can use is ge is going to do this dogshit method when there are better, faster and cheaper options available.
---
I wouldn't suggest using it to personally search the wiki, but if context requires it on reddit, I think it's pretty useful.
---
Lmfao this is why every pvp related poll fails miserably. Most of the votes come from people who have little to no PK experience and have zero idea what pking is actually like or what pkers are looking for out there
---
By thinking and not following. 
---
how is that relevant at all to a suggestion post?
---
This is for pearl harbour
---
Birdhouses and implings were what I meant by "stole design space". Birdhouses absolutely should have been construction, it's a small stretch to say that implings should have been agility, and a bigger stretch to say that chins shouldn't exist and that explosive ranged weapons should be created using firemaking.
---
That's not to say I think hunter should just be removed. There's plenty that could be done with the concepts of traps, lures, and tracking that doesn't involve the RNG waitfest we have now.
---
Oh you’re definitely getting hacked with this info out there 
---
What point exactly are you making? That people in the wild who don't want to be attacked shouldn't be attacked? I don't think I have to say anything for anyone to see how ridiculous your point is.
---
yep, just sit at 60+ hp u will never ever die
---
The addition of the skill permits the addition and manipulation of content, xp rates and locking/unlocking of both without really screwing up an entire other skill, no matter how useless (runecrafting) or overloaded (regular crafting) that skill is.
---
To be honest, with the way the skill is shaping up, runecrafting could just be added to Warding and we can call it a day.
---
I was too young to even try years ago (or at least I thought), and after getting back in osrs 6 months ago after a couple year break, I didn’t really understand it was capable until the YouTube gods showed me the way haha. 
---
Let’s say I got a nice lucky Jad spawn on my third attempt and got it done. 
---
Use the jad simulator. A quick Google search should suffice 
---
Except that you can still do it via RL, even if the official client doesn't let you.
---
Not that RL is required, you can modify interfaces just via memory manipulation - no clients required.
---
It's hard to learn and very click intensive/frustrating. 
---
People get private scripts. People create their own bots using bots that allow essentially visual scripting.  And bots are always being updated.
---
Though detection rates aren't exactly low. Many people do it manually or have at least some manual play every now and then to avoid heuristic detection.
---
I can rotate if I open the image and not the post.
---
Brilliant concept, numbers can always be tweaked later. Goodluck on this one.
---
This shit is basically Summoning 2. Hear me out. Summing when it first came out was hard to train as you had to be rich. If and I highly doubt warding will come out but if it does it will drive up the prices of dissolving items which rich players will only have. Sure it will fix the overflow of common items but you basically make a skill with too many expectations. Warding doesn't have to be a skill. It can be three. **Magic, Runecrafting and Crafting can easily fulfill the function of crafting magical equipment.** The sailing idea was better than this one but still hard for many players to look at a new skill and think it will be good for the game. Add warding to the game but lower the expectation of it, don't let it be its own skill to train and let it be shared between the skills you already have. I love the idea of crafting magical items but I would much rather that crafting be shared between the skills we already have and already do said thing.
---
I mostly pk in PvP worlds, is there a big difference?
---
This is the most busted account I’ve ever seen 
---
Bruh u read a lot in to; "streamers lol" 
---
To think icon size determines how good of a brid you are is small brain strats. Streamers don't like anything that reduces the skill gap (therefore learning curve) because they are literally paid to play the game. Moreover this learning curve isn't even the interesting bit of bridding. It's just an abritrary area which has been offered improvement through QOL, and shot down because of obtuse streamers. IMO.
---
Literally yes, but they won't 🤷
---
Personally i vote yes to them minus the ones that gives player jumpers an advantage  
---
Hmm yeah, I was thinking that, but a degraded crystal axe won't remove the dragon axe.  Seems like it shouldn't affect demand at all, like the infernal equipment does.
---
No. I said my point is that people who hunt people who can’t fight back are cowards, and shouldn’t be lumped in with actual PKers. If you took a moment to read instead of writing me off, you might have understood that a lot sooner. 
---
Prayer wouldn't drain, hydra became invulnerable and locked into place. Seems to happen when you try to log out or hop worlds right as it spawns. Filled a bug report in game already.
---
Ahh that's hot.
---
Entrana would be top expensive imagine your own private island
---
I was a bit skeptical in the beginning, probably because I despised the "Vote yes to Warding or get fucked" hivemind mentality which happened here in the days after RuneFest. Will it pass? Unlikely, but what's strange to me is how most people seems to have decided which side they're one, even though we've never ever seen anything from this skill beyond the rough concept from RuneFest.
---
What kind of person pays for a month of membership during February??? Smh

---
Fandom wiki is nowoutdated, unmaintained, and has many many inaccurate or completely broken or destroyed pages.
---
I would use this for pretty much everything. I’m literally always questioning if I forget something or if I grabbed the correct number of items I usually get. 
---
They should let you melt equiptment for smithing too.  Get back half of your materials or somthing.
---
Say it, say the line.. 
---
[removed]
---
Items needed are x,x,x,x,x... 5 secs later... okai first I am going to deposit all the items and grab x,x, and x. 
---
you dont know what they have in their inv if it bothers you that much dont enter the wilderness not even being a dick but a slight inconvenience to the clue scroller is nothing they can just tele back up in less than a minute 
---
It's a good idea, but there'd definitely be a few kinks to work out- like how the client decides where to teleport you if multiple choices are available, criteria which have to be met to make you tele (because it'd get real old real fast if you were teleported after dcing whilst at no risk of imminently dying) and some kind of toggle to let you turn it off when it'd be inconvenient, or if you'd just rather not use the feature
---
Yeah months are actually calculated as 4 weeks now. I noticed when I resubbed a few weeks ago. Technically February has 28 days so they aren't super wrong  
---
You have no idea what you are talking about. Actually, this is a great example of PvP thriving. As long as there is Wilderness content worth doing for PvMers and skillers, PKers will follow, and naturally, also PvPers fighting eachother.
---
I did this same thing few months ago at the NJ place

You always have the TL;DR for an overview and the design doc if you're interested in a specific part.

You posting the same thing on repeat daily bro?
---
You mixed them up

My argument isn't that vorkath should be removed, it's that it should be lower long term gp/hr compared to gwd/cerb 
---
This went one of two ways as a kid. Either you were a noob in 2007 who brought their rune plate and dragon longsword (entire bank basically) to the wildy in hopes of killing some monsters or what have you, then this doucher walks up to you and ice barrages your balls into the broadside of your butthole while his friend teleblocks you. Then they say "haha fgt" and you clench your fist in little boy rage as you vow to never play runescape again.
---
That, or you were the chad pker killing the noobs for their shit. There was no middle ground back then. 
---
Teach me your ways, oh King of Memes.
---
Thanks for providing the proof.
---
All these bosses can be killed within 2 to 3 minutes tops 
---
You misunderstand. The incentives are actually insanely overpowered - the chaos altar should not exist, and overtuned wilderness boss tables are an artifact of warping the game around bad design to try and force players to engage with it. The game would be far better if players not interested in PvP weren't forced into an area where you're constantly griefed by other players. PvPers should have a place to engage and a way to highlight the best parts of PvP content, but they shouldn't just get an area dedicated to Jagex shiting out terrible updates into the to force more 3-itemers into the wilderness to die to people with social and emotional issues.
---
The design is terrible, and I'd really love to see it just properly removed and replaced.
---
Yeah, tell me more about these oats. I'm listening.

Yes, world lag freezes the server itself. Do any pvm anywhere and when the world lags you'll stop taking hits. Before, when it didnt freeze the entire world, you would stop lagging and come back to multiple hit splats on you.

At the same time ,that's why it's challenge,not 1 of each ,all 3 are attacking you at same time  3v1

A membership month is good for 4weeks

Probably because you were so level. Bunch of people pk there without plus 1 and just use salad robes, hides and d dagger. Most time you can kill someone burying bones with just that
---
Really awesome idea, I would love to use this.
---
Even Venezuela and a green dragon is there
---
Couldn't agree more. I personally think not using guides makes them as well otherwise doing a quest step by step looking at a guide makes it feel more like a chore to me.
---
Fierce. 
---
Or walk out of the room? Lmao you’d also have to bring the item with you to get the dc benefit just like you would a tele, there’s literally no unintended benefit outside of the actual dc save.
---
It’s pure genius. 
---
What? So in this game where you can literally cast magic, you don't think the ability to craft a magical item would be a real skill? This isn't real life. If there are magical items in an evironment, then you can bet there will be a profession regarding the creation of those magical items. Your logic of it not being a skill in the sense of it being a profession, holds literally negative weight in the context of a VIDEO GAME.
---
I mean I'd rather all the Diaries use existing NPCs. But that doesn't mean it was out of line for new NPCs for Diaries to be counted in base Diary poll. We've never polled every single thing of an update and we polled less back then.
---
You should get the bio hazard gas mask too
---
Takes about 13 hours to hit the drop rate for chaos ele so it’s not like they cost him a lot of time. I know someone who lost a tbow at chaos ele recently so it’s always worth it for pkers to attack someone even if it doesn’t look like they’ll get much loot.
---
The whole reason that content in the wildly is considered balanced is because the risk of dying is factored in. Makes no sense to complain about getting pked. If he really cared about the pet he could have dropped all his items so the pet would be protected.

Technically they ARE legitimate suggestions. Just not sand-related.
---
because last time the pvp brainlets voted no on the grounds that it would make pvp take less skill. this time jagex tried to gather up all the kinder gardeners in a fenced off corner of the room but it seems like they still escaped
---
It's not at all griefing though.  You're doing content that was introduced in to the wilderness by design.  It's supposed to add a "risk factor" to the content.  No matter how difficult content can be, players will master it.  Having it in the wilderness adds a factor where pretty much anything can happen.  If you do not want this kind of gameplay, enjoy the thousands of hours of content that's outside the wilderness.  It is that simple.  Just an fyi, the wilderness was removed in late '07.  
---
It already is, just pay people to grab essence and keep trading you in the altars.

I personally don't find lynx Titan impressive. It's not impressive to do the same thing to determent of health. Even throw out the health, dedication isn't necessarily impressive.

Acvuracy bonus is calced by: (effective level) * (stat bonus + 64) or in this case 1*664 which is prrty low. 
---
I think in full ances and arc no prayer ur character has about 120*(150+64) which is about 26000
---
And the accuracy formula is close to, in this case 1-(664/26000)*100% which is like 95% accuracy
---
I did this all quickly out of the top of my head, and the numbers are probably a bit off, though this should give u a general idea why their mage def is shit even with 600 magic bonus

IIRc they said they would have to mostly re-code almost all of BA to make that work, even though they would love to do it. Doing that would probably change how it works because they wouldn't be able to replicate it causing BA to be entirely different to how it currently functions causing the meta to drastically change essentially breaking BA.

Before the wilderness ditch, you had your character would stop walking before entering the wilderness and you had to click ok on a message warning you that you were entering a PvP area and other players can attacking you before you could walk any further north. If you're too stupid to ignore that message, then you're also too stupid to not click on the wilderness ditch.

Converting flax to bow strings at the flax keeper is worth it if you have completed Kandarin elite diary. 250 free bow strings daily (30K) and takes about 30 secs.
---
Maybe there's a misunderstanding, as I also agree with you, there should not be a split. But literally every combat related poll has had the split between PvP and PvM for a few months.

I just dont get how rearranging prayers so that you dont click the wrong one is dumbing down anything, its like people think removing the 1/10 chance of someone misclicking is some op bullshit. You either have prayer to use or you dont, having prayers in a desired order isnt giving anyone an advantage. If you depend of people misclicking prayers you probably just suck in general. Oldschool Runescape hardly requires cat-like reflexes to play

Yeah except it adds more security and hurts absolutely nothing.

Why anyone would buy into this idea of the old wiki being "inaccurate" is beyond me. Who in their right mind would create a fucking encyclopedia for a game this complicated? Clearly they have other motivations.

Apparently I’m out of touch with everything what’s this all about?
---
The elder maul had exactly one use against a niche boss that had absurdly high defence.  Said use was recently removed.
---
Every other example has a crazy high damage modifier, or hits 3 times in 1 swing.
---
The leaf axe is a pretty easy example of this.  It had nearly double the stats of the leaf bladed sword, but STILL needed a 20% damage buff to compare.
---
There's a reason why the blowpipe is the highest dps weapon to ever exist.
---
I did I just never said PvM is low skill and that it consisted of people who hate PvP and think all PvPers are assholes so I wasn’t really sure how it applied to me. I tried to explain my position. It has nothing to do with my opinions on PvMers and everything to do with the fact that PvP polls are heavily influenced by people who don’t PvP. 
---
No, your character wouldn't stop moving. Your character would continue moving to the last point you clicked on, or would continue to follow a character you were following or trading.
---
The reason they added the ditch was because they couldn't think of any way to prevent this other than an object that physically stopped your character like a wall that could only be passed through by clicking on it.
---
&gt; If you're too stupid to ignore that message, then you're also too stupid to not click on the wilderness ditch. 
---
The message is irrelevant. Your character continues moving even as the message pops up. It's not about ignoring the message and continuing into the Wilderness; it's about that message not serving the same function as something that actually stops you.

Good to know you still get slayer xp.

If they count it as a fail you should have to kill healers aswell

This has been an ongoing problem with the community about Jagex. How can a company have zero human to human support but Blizzard can have a 24-hour call center?

Their excuses are the same each time, “there are 24-million accounts”. But I still don’t see the connection to how embarrassingly terrible they are. 
---
Your story is very similar via the outcome so I sympathize with you. Good luck
---
I think many skillers (at least the ones who have a leg to stand on) would like skilling based bosses/activities that reward them, more than just one or two per skill, instead something on par with a PvM boss.
---
I get what you’re saying but it’s not practical for just one second. I could see it after 3 seconds or something though. I feel like the jagex servers have probably frequent episodes of 1 second disconnects, especially given mobile.

Go ahead and tell me what good your authenticator delay is when the person now has access to your email (like you say in your scenario) and can now see any and all personal information required to submit a recovery appeal, which will immediately remove your auth upon successful recovery, along with your current password and email.
---
They'll have your billing history and access to any other personal information to impersonate you. Or in this perfectly crafted scenario are you signed in on some burner email and the entire laptop is dedicated to nothing but RuneScape with nothing related to your personal life?
---
Your example is a joke for a single reason: it is not reasonable. It is not reasonable to use some fanciful scenario where someone steals your laptop and thinks "hmm, I bet this guy plays RuneScape!" 
---
By the time you've realized your laptop is gone, you would have had more than enough time to lock down virtually all of your personal information. This also assumes the person stole it while your laptop was signed in. If someone is going to steal your laptop and finds that it requires a password, they're going to do what anyone else does- wipe the drive. 
---
All in all, there is no feasible scenario where your account can be accessed without ideal conditions. Your scenario is not applicable to the overwhelming of every single hijacking that will ever occur, and therefore not reasonable.

Alright, well a lot of people are upset for whatever reason. I'll download it.

Yeah no bank pin which is definitely my fault I won't deny that. But the items don't really matter if I can't even get control of the account back to begin with. My recovery questions and such are all obscure enough that even my close friends wouldn't be able to figure all of them out. The problem is that apparently someone else knows more about me/my account to get a valid recovery request than I know about me LOL

Thought id revive this discussion because of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DTo7LI_JEo . There is a lot to criticize about this video but there is nothing wrong with how he got his average chest rewards. Regardless of mory hard diary and any personal analogy, special drops boost your average chest value by 40,718 using the drop rate of 1/17 and averaging barrows loot values. Now using his data over 1000 runs, the average rune values in his chests were around 70k. He had mory diary though so we decrease this by 33% (an increase of 50% can be reversed by a decrease of 33%). This would be 46,200 rune value average in a chest no hard diary. With the special drops that is 86,918 a chest. Using ibans staff, he averaged 11 chests per hour. However he used very high level gear like ancestral, so we will assume 9 chests per hour as you had it before. This gives us 782k/hr still. The cost of ibans staff would probably be around 30 max (it only costs 243 per cast). This allows for 123 casts Prayer pots assuming one dose per run for tunnels (dont need one outside tunnels using proper order) will be 22,446. Food shouldnt really be much but ill be generous and give it 10k since this is a hypothetical new player. 9 barrows tabs is 27k. In total this is 80k in costs. This leaves us with 700k/hr profit, 100k more than the original debate and im using extremely generous costs. If the player was 75 using fire wave itd be even more cost effective and 75 isnt a high requirement. These costs allow the player to be as low as 50 magic. Of course they might need more prayer if they are so new they have 50 magic so you could double the prayer cost and they are still making significantly more than 600k/hr. I think for the most part this settles it.

---
The 100% chance is really messing with comparisons with the ely. Because its more reliable, you are safer at lower hp, and therefore in gwd might save food during a general kill, and instead heal up on minions after.
---
The divine was much more expensive in rs2. Because the drop rates were identical the supply was as well. The question is if the demand was because it was much better or if it was just percieved to be better.

The devs of OSBuddy have a much closer relationship with Jagex so they're in a much stronger position to become something akin to an official launcher. Unfortunately this is one of those situations where who you know matters more than what you know. I would much rather Runelite become official as well. Of course, neither launcher is ever going to become official so it's a moot point anyway. Jagex should seriously consider an official multifunctional launcher with plugins though. Then maybe they wouldn't have to constantly poll minor bullshit and just let users customize their experience as long as it doesn't negatively affect other players or result in an unfair advantage.
---
I’ve never personally done the calculations, but I assume if you have a perfectly optimal task list Duradel is better, based on posts I’ve seen on this sub. Tasks like blood velds and greater demons are block/skip, iirc the only tasks you actually do are average tasks, dags, suqahs, black dragons, and maybe trolls?
---
This
---
Okay
---
Fair enough, sorry for the previous lazy replies.  I was on my phone and have fat fingers, also should have given more thought before replying.
---
You sure know a lot about the meta after having not played for a year... 
---
Farming ranarrs and snapdragons for profit is a very popular mid level money maker, my man. Runelite tells you when they are done. It's even more profitable than ever considering you'll get a ton of free seeds from doing farming contracts...
---
Not a tough guy. Just kill people when I’m in the wilderness. I can’t imagine crying about dying in the wilderness. Go to nieve if it’s a problem for you champ.
---
Less dirty than the sand casino 
---
I don't feel strongly one way or another but I don't see any reason to remove him. He's basically wearing a bunch of gear everyone wishes they had back in 07, and basically dresses like a fashionscape noob, which is a very real thing in osrs and always been a thing throughout RuneScape. 
---
Like really he doesn't seem out of place at all to me. Go to get on any world except 2200 world and you'll see someone in similar gear
---
Obvious troll lol
---
Yeah that's where we disagree. Can still get some great xp with cannoning + blowpipe... And when I was only skipping for fast barrage tasks / jad/zuk tasks from Duradel I was losing points faster than gaining (Which in the short  term isn't a big deal, but on the grind to 99 that adds up quick)
---
I do 5 runs a day, ultracompost, magic secateurs, never pay attention to them in-between, and maybe one dies every 50-ish seeds. You should average something like 120-150k a run with ultracompost and magic secateurs.
---
Extra farming location plus people undercutting id imagine. 
---
Cant smite the unkillable.
---
Also its 4 prayer points difference if you ags spec roll a 70 with smite on a divine, but not even 50 damage 
---
Whoa calm down bud. Wouldnt want a big tough guy like you coming after me now. I'm just a "snowflake" remember?

I never called u a snowflake fella you got the wrong guy. 
---
They're both literally the exact same in terms of "what is familiar." There aren't any design differences to warrant that opinion. Runelite just has even more features, is open source, and the rest of what others said in this thread. Also nobody should support the "pay to unlock features" model rather than donating out of generosity, as someone in the thread already said. Again, this sounds like laziness.
---
Whoosh

Just simply saying you’re braindead
---
__Where is ultimate ironman info__
---
__Downvoted by casuals__
---
Do Ranarrs have a lower chance of disease? Using magic secateurs and ultracompost I was losing at least 1 toadflax patch every run before I left.
---
People like you amuse me.
---
i’ll take the claw if that’s all you wanted...

no you dont have to monitor them.

99 farm avgs 9.5 including deaths.

Well I would assume it’s because you didn’t have 2FA on your account AND your email. I’ll also assume you didn’t have a bank pin. If you did, you may have clicked a phishing link or you have a keylogger. If you didn’t have any of those...that’s why lol
---
They also added more patches lol. They recently polled a 10th herb patch. Also there's more things to farm than herbs so that might've contributed. Farming definitely isn't in a position that it's a pointless. More profit-based herbs like ranarr is several hundred k in just several minutes.

WoW's dailyscape and Runescape's dailyscape are not to be compared. I remember in MoP I could literally spend the entire day doing dailies. Fuck that.
---
They don't, but you should definitely not lose that many herbs. Your death rates with ultracompost should be much, much lower than that - probably no higher than 1/20 for anything at the lowest level farming to plant said herb.
---
And you're probably the guy who talks big on the internet and backs down in person. Just like now.

You go do it with the same client and upload the video here please 
---
So this is supposed to combat the issue of skilling resources being more easily acquired through slayer.. by doing slayer? Not sure if I fully understand that logic but I'd say there's way better ways of tackling that issue. 
---
Wow awful information
---
In order to balance the skill to its smithing counterpart its only fair that warding unlock craftable mystic at 99 and that is that. 
---
Doing that method works for max xp gains but comes at a loss of net points (meaning afaik it's not a viable method to do all the way to 99). Exception being ofc if you're allowing some non-optimal tasks through that are "quick" (wyverns) or have boss variations you want to grind for pet (hydra, gargoyles, boss tasks, etc.)

What do you guys recommend I should use dukes training xp on? Was thinking magic as it’s my lowest skill by far at 65 while everything else is 80+.

Why be childish cant we have a proper discussion?

Why are you all being so toxic the point of this post was humor. His anger was humorous not toxic. If you don't enjoy the video just keep it moving and don't leave your shitty comments. Let us live lol this was halarious when it was going down obviously why he went so hard.

It’s not like jagex can physically ban every single account.. there are so many that some of them will inevitably slip through the cracks

What ever happened to mod mustang?
---
I'd love to see a video of that, never heard of anyone getting 100k/h consistently. Actually the only tasks that can come close to that is smoke devils and maybe speed run infernos, and there's no way you're maintaining points while skipping for only those two tasks.
---
And the "backwards calculations" were done by taking the weights off the wiki, comparing between nieve and duradel, assuming blocks with what would be the most likely constant skip tasks between each master, and calculating the percent chance of a skip worthy task v.s. a non-skip worthy task (counting bonus points) to ensure point stability.

OSRS already pulls in more revenue than RS3, so they're just milking the RS3 cow to death. Also the whole deal with OSRS was that there wouldn't be MTX beyond what is voted in by the community, and bonds are the only thing that ever really had a chance. RS3 will always have MTX, and OSRS will only ever have bonds before the ship sinks.

Fire surge (49) (51 wish ahrim+aotd spec) Ags spec (84) Gmaul spec(48) = 181 (183) damage in 1 hitsplat.  Can still stack someone from brew hp through a divine in one tick. Smite and the divine effect drain 59 prayer points.

Yeah but RS3 has the better graphics and Higher level PVE i believe it would perhaps be more popular if they didnt keep having annoying treasure hunter popups constantly, say they reduced the promos 50% it would go along way in making it grow back to its glory days and then it would be the main game again, its like OSRS AND RS3 going on a hike and rs3 has to carry all the bags.. and you wonder why no one wants to be like rs3.

How is it any better than just clicking on a tablet. It's not like you can tele out of deep wilderness anyways. I am not sure how consider that abuse able.

Food, pots, teleports, range, melee, magic, loot
---
&gt;Such the expert! Your lack of experience really shows everyone you know your stuff!
---
I'm sorry, are you suggesting that you need to have extensive personal experience in order to understand a subject? Because that seems a bit silly. I'm sure you know not to drink floor cleaner, even though you've never tried it yourself. 
---
&gt;Did it ever occur to you the drop rate is much lower is because of the wilderness difficulties? 
---
Funnily enough, all other wilderness pets have lower drop rates than the Chaos Elemental. Scorpia, found in a cave located literally right next to the Chaos Elemental, has a 1/2,000 chance of dropping a pet. Venenatis, Callisto, and Vet'ion all have a 1/2,000 chance of dropping their respective pets. Chaos Fanatic has a 1/1,000 chance of dropping the same pet as the Chaos Elemental. The fact of the matter is that the Chaos Elemental pet is, at least, twice as likely to be dropped as any of the other wilderness pets. 
---
&gt;Again if you're going to pull the  "It's easy to get because the chances are lower" card, you can't do it in the same breath as "Oh I don't do that".  Burden of proof is on you, friendo.
---
Objectively speaking, there is a 1/300 chance of getting the pet from the Chaos Elemental. Each kill of the Chaos Elemental has a 0.33% chance of rewarding you with a pet.
---
Objectively speaking, there is a 1/2,000 chance of getting the pet from Scorpia. Each kill of Scorpia has a 0.05% chance of rewarding you with a pet.
---
Are you denying that you are objectively more likely to get the pet from the Chaos Elemental than you are to get the pet from Scorpia?
---
You can verify these figures on the Wiki if you'd like, they're easily accessible.
---
&gt;Case in point, OP's fight didn't even last a minute so it's easy to tell he didn't have very good gear, probably middling, and most geared towards the boss fight. 
---
There is nothing in the OP indicating the length of the fight or the gear they were using. 
---
Even mid-tier gear is worthwhile for a PKer if the kill is easy enough. Making 100k-300k in a short period of time is nothing to scoff at- especially if the kill "didn't even last a minute". 
---
&gt;If you're going to lie, make it believable. Wilderness past lvl 30 restricts teleports hard, that level of risking is not ideal for solo pkers 
---
Perhaps you should actually venture into the wilderness before accusing others of lying. Multi-combat areas in deep wilderness are frequented by teams and individual PKers alike. If you've spent any time at revanants, lava dragons, Annakarl, or the altar you would know this. While multi is not ideal, it is where the highest rewards can be earned. 
---
&gt;because a group can stumble upon them and they'd have to run from lvl 50 to 29, and I want to meet the marathon runner who can elude a PK group that can make it that long. Otherwise, you're restricted to levers which is still a gamble for a solo to make it when they can have multiple people casting root. For Chaos Elemental the only quick way out would be obelisk
---
There is *so much* wrong with this - someone hasn't done their research. 
---
You don't have to run to level 29 wilderness. You can teleport at level 30 wilderness with certain teleports. Anyone who has done or even researched wilderness content knows this.
---
You don't have to teleport to escape a team. You can get gap and log out by using environmental features to your advantage. You could also use mechanics such as ladders(rogues castle), caves(scorpia), and gates(resource area) to evade combat long enough to log out. 
---
Running to a single-combat area will also negate the numerical superiority of a team. In single combat areas, you can lose your pursuers by running through aggressive monsters such as hobgoblins or spiders. You may also box these creatures while you wait out your teleblock.
---
Entangle(root?) isn't a very useful PvP spell as its freeze time is halved by the protect from magic prayer. A player who has been frozen has a grace period between freezes where they can move. In black d'hides with protect from magic and mystic might/augury active, you would likely have no trouble escaping people on the standard spell book.
---
&gt;Again, the worth is very minimal if you're going after unskulled. You're going to get a lot less than what you could merchanting or grinding valuable skills.
---
I'd really encourage you to either try this sort of PKing out yourself or watch some folks on Youtube or Twitch do it. You can make quite a lot of money if you're good at PKing. 
---
Unskulled people will generally have risk when skilling or doing PvM in the wilderness. This is either due to their gear or the items they accumulate in their activities. People training prayer at the altar will likely be risking between 60k and 300k per inventory of bones(dragon v superior), assuming they don't have more noted bones and coins. People training slayer(which can include boss monsters) may have mysterious emblems worth around 140k each. People using Verac's for the set effect can be smited for their flail. People killing wilderness bosses will risk, generally, all of the drops they have received since last banking. People skilling in the resource area may have hundreds of noted resources. Runite miners can risk up to 600k an inventory, while those recharging dragonstone jewelry can risk up to 150k. Lava Dragon hunters may risk hundreds of thousands in drops. Mage Arena II contenders can have hundreds of runes in addition to their gear. Revenant killers will risk hundreds of thousands before banking. People hunting black chins may have hundreds of them. 
---
While some folks certainly may not risk as much, that doesn't change the fact that they're still worth killing. Even someone with a 50K risk is worthwhile if it only takes 2k in supplies and twenty seconds to kill. 
---
&gt;Yeah, the smaller things will add up quick, but by the time you find a target, manage to kill them, take your black d'hide and 300 mithril darts, run back to Edgeville bank, then run back into the deeper parts of wilderness
---
Nobody PKs like that. It's not worth banking until you've accumulated enough loot or you begin to run low on supplies. If I kill someone for black d'hide and 300 mithril darts, it goes into my looting bag and I hop to the next world. That said, with access to the wilderness hard diaries and a house containing a pool and an obelisk, you can get from the chaos elemental to a bank and back in less than a couple of minutes if you *really* wanted to.
---
&gt;but you're not going to catch them when a person's inventory is heavy enough to warrant these items dropping most of the time because they'll be making a break for the bank.

It's interesting you should say that, seeing the whole point of this post is OP being caught by PKers after receiving a special drop. That Chaos Elemental pet could have just as easily been a dragon pickaxe(1/256 chance), which would have caused them to risk one of their previously protected items at least.
---
&gt;So a person's spade isn't really worth killing a player over, and nothing is really worth killing someone for a drop they'll never receive. 
---
You're not killing someone for a spade. You're not killing someone for a pet. You're killing someone for the potential loot that they have in addition to these things - what is difficult to understand about this?
---
&gt;Again, unless you're killing people who are skulled, who are guarenteed to drop their really high value equipment, 
---
Please at least familiarize yourself with the topic before making these silly claims. No, you're not *guaranteed* to drop high value equipment. There's a prayer called "protect item" that lets you save your most valuable item, even if skulled, provided you have it activated when you die. PKers aren't even guaranteed to *have* high level equipment - when I PK my maximum risk is about 300k. When I do content like revenant caves where good gear isn't necessary, I only risk around 120k. That's less than someone recharging glories. 
---
&gt;As for killing people for fun, then wheres the fun when theres no challenge?
---
Ignoring for a moment the fact that there usually *is* a challenge(people run, people try to teleport, people try to gap you, people try to use mechanics like ladders, people try to fight back, people try to tank, people try to get a box) most of the time, one major aspect of fun is the uncertainty of what is to happen. Unlike things like skilling which are rather linear, PKing is unpredictable - one moment you could be stomping someone and the next a clan could log in and drive you off. It's variable and enjoyable.
---
&gt;How do you get any practice on something that doesn't fight back? then what are you even learning?
---
I'd really encourage you to give PKing a go. 
---
If you're hybriding(bringing multiple combat styles), you need to learn how to effectively switch between them. You need to manage your gear, prayers, and special attacks to ensure a higher chance of success. That takes practice, even if you're fighting someone who isn't doing anything but flicking prayers and eating. 
---
You may learn how to time teleblocks or freezes to be most effective. You may learn how to avoid being gapped or how to effectively follow a fleeing target. You may learn how to avoid aggressive monsters or how to stay out of range of your opponent while still dealing damage. 
---
&gt;GASP!
---
Remind me again how much gold I'll make practicing with friends at the duel arena? I imagine I'd actually turn up with a loss, seeing as there would be nothing to cover my consumables. Add that to the fact that some things can't even be practiced there, and it seems like a bad idea.
---
&gt;Yes, a long time ago when things were a lot more harsh and there were less elements in the play to ruin your day. 
---
The wilderness is a *vastly* different place than it was a "long time ago". There is high-risk high-reward content that makes this sort of thing worthwhile. Give it a try sometime, you might learn something.
---
Ok if its trolling for having an opinion im just wondering why you guys wont pull your weight abit? even like 1 promo a week, runescape 3 is dying cuz its just popup after popup buy keys get keys 50% off blah blah , obvious solution is remove it completely but from a business point of view that will never happen so if they reduce it, then the money gotta come from elsewhere, If osrs is bigger like you say (Prob not by much) then even 25% of the promos that rs3 has would be enough revenue to reduce rs3 mtx by 50% ? then we both happy you feel?
---
After 6 days of hardcore grinding I got my imbued mage cape, both void mage and void rangers, 76 range for the fairy ring (from 60 kill me), and I can't quite afford the scales, blowpipe, trident, and suffering. If I buy the scales, blowpipe, and trident, I'll only have 3 mil left. Is it okay to just use recoils? Or do I keep training mage and making money? I'm at 78 right now.
---
I'm not sure if this is 100% accurate or not but from what I've read one of the ways the bot detection system works is by noticing small movements in your mouse. If you're not moving at all for hours on end it might trip the system. Not entirely sure on this.  
---
Imagine how the African Americans felt after they found out they got this month!
---
Nice rune plate 
---
man i hope people dont think this is real lol  like im sorry but no one would show themself off just for a gp unless your a dumbass
---
Rs3 could be p2p having the same playerbase and they would still never make as much money as osrs 
---
I've been scrolling reddit so long I'm pretty much brain-dead, so I clicked without acknowledging the subreddit it was from, and by then it was too late 😢
---
Hmmm that's a tough one, I've gotten into a lot of arguments with my friends who think gaming is boring etc and hate their boyfriends for playing them/don't understand how anyone could like them. 
---
Maybe try to wean her into games with some boardgame remakes you can play online together etc. Otherwise I'm not really sure how to help, depends on how stubborn she is I guess
---
Could be, but still good xp and best pet chance.

Nice

If it makes you feel better, the filler is basically just tiddy episodes written by some anime sweatshop writer.  If you know what's filler you can just skip to the next overly drawn out arc.

When 2 ket-zek spawn, take note of where the orange one spawns (I usually stand in middle of the caves praying mage), kill the red one first then before you kill the orange one, sip your range/prayer pot, make sure your high hp. When the last zek is dead, prayer range and watch his animations  
---
Nickher, why?
---
I mean it's very possible the guy was just learning pking. It's what I'm doing right now is going around attacking people at chins getting my clicks and switches down, and I usually run when another pker who seems like they know what theyre doing starts attacking me.
---
Cuz they havnt got the mtx balance right, i believe if it was less frequent/pushy it would be exploding with thousands more players, 1 promo a week i dont think alot would mind.. RS3 got way way worse. ill be emailing this thread to a dev i think when i get abit more support/input.
---
just finished my first playthrough of that game 2 minutes before looking at this post
---
Since all of my previous posts to you seem to have been wasted, I'll be much more direct and just let it go after that.
---
OSRS makes more money than RS3 does. OSRS is pulling RS3's dying corpse forward. MTX in OSRS will kill RS3 faster than leaving it all as it is right now. RS3 needs to pull its weight.
---
So I've been part of a cc and it's related Discord for a few weeks now. A moderator, some other member and I were doing corp like we did a few times before and we got the Spectral drop. The mod to which it dropped did not share the split with me right away. I understand that not splitting is not against the rules. However, the guy (he had been awkwardly flirty on vc and pm's in the past) told me that he'd only give me my split if I were to send him a few pictures of my butthole in multiple poses and me jerking off to the backstreet boys songs. I ended up doing it because it's a lot of money, but thought (and still think) that it's pretty Sexy and hot.
---
It's basically blackmail which i dont mind but still I was wondering whether I could report the guy for it? Does it fall under rwt, maybe?

---
Cmb 88 isn't even that bad. Get 99 str.
---
Obvious bait is obvious
---
Well thanks for agreeing with my point on why its dying, but heres the awesome thing it doesnt have to bro, if OSRS has just 1 promo a week which i and majority wouldnt care about (Less pushy) then that would pay for rs3 mtx to be dialled back atleast 50% then win win ? 
---
You know what, this argument is pointless. You're obviously not reading or thinking about anything I'm saying if you're bringing up Konar or think that spending days doing wildy slayer for more skip points to max xp/h is at all what we're discussing. Have a good day my dude.
---
It does actually break a couple rules. I wouldnt expect a non btw such as yourself to understand.
---
Good job, noob.
---
why cant runescape be real life man
---
There is no content in the wilderness that is essential for PVMers to do or have access to, other than mage arena 2 cape. 
---
Anything else is entirely your own choice so stfu and stop complaining when you die. If it angers you that much stick to 2 tick woodcutting
---
Thanks homie
---
Why not make the male one like the female one?
---
"I'll be emailing this thread to a dev, I think when I get a bit more support." 
---
Yeah you do that buddy. You're not going to get any kind of support from anyone on this sub in regards to MTX. You're in the wrong place to get support for it, I'm telling you that right now. 
---
There's no such thing as balance when it comes to MTX. 
---
Obvious troll... if you dont have anything constructive to add dont comment thanks.. cuz believe it or not some of us want to save both games dude
---
You do realize that they made OSRS for all the players that were against a lot of the things that were wrong with RS3 including mtx? So your logic is to do something that will definitely decrease the popularity of OSRS and potentially increase the popularity of RS3. Which by the way isn’t even based on any facts, that’s your opinion. And what is also your opinion is that RS3 is currently deceasing in popularity due to constant promos. If that is the case, wouldn’t a simple solution to that just be to run less promos? And yeah I get that Jagex needs money to operate but OSRS currently brings in more revenue without promos..which says something. 
---
Btw I play both OSRS and RS3, personally I think they are both fun in their own way and I still think your suggestion is absolutely ridiculous. Your solution is literally curing a disease by dividing it up. 
---
I think the difference is that pkers force themselves on you and the toxic ones are people who shit talk those they’re killing that aren’t geared for a fight or just not even fighting in general. Toxic Pvmers are 100% avoidable and you literally can max an account or do any content in the game without ever interacting with them.  The idea behind pvp is player interaction, whereas the only times you’ll really be experiencing toxic pvm is pub raids or the like.
---
Ancient mace?
---
think I can see Divine laying in the trash there :(
---
bro, i'm so jealous of you
---
Honest question, isn't the fire cape an inefficient +1?  Compared to like just a b ring
---
I feel like adding a whole skill is just unnecessary for most of this content, especially for the purpose of creating magic armour, and if anything, would feel jarring to not be a part of other skills.
---
Runic energy should be gathered via the runecrafting skill at the already existing altars, it's already the skill that deals with runic energy so why do we need two when the one we have is already almost as barebones as it could be?
---
You could craft unfinish(unf) versions of each armour piece using crafting instead, you then finish it with a spell or by taking the equipment to it's appropriate altar and using runecrafting, or perhaps a combination of both, similar to how arceus prayer training works where the animation spells won't work too far from the dark altar.
---
Thats like being critically injured and just saying oh the dmg is done dont worry about going to hospital.. dude its never to late to save the once more popular main game.. have some respect , 1 promo a week is nothing, itll lift a huge burden off rs3 that brings in the funds to support your devs from osrs..

But can you do it with two dicks in your mouth

That's a surprise tool we will be using later

Cuz its riddled with buy key popup crap, i believe if they toned it down to acceptable levels like a promo once a week it would be alive again... how is that hard to understand?
---
while he was sitting still?
---
He lost potential views. Nobody really watches tob anymore. Unless its a hcim. in which case its the most hyped content in the game.
---
You seriously cant say nothing was lost. For your normal player who doesnt stream you are right, for a streamer that red symbol is huge
---
Holy fuck you’re stupid. It’s efficient to use Konar for a single milestone task. You shouldn’t need to do wildy slayer because efficient slayer is points positive but if you are unlucky then that’s an effective way to accrue points. 
---
You’re just not listening to what I’m saying and are instead sticking you your awfully done maths. Enjoy lowering the iq of the gene pool my guy.
---
What’s your goals man?
---
Upvoted for visibility also want to know.
---
They polled having the quests since it would've been a lot of dev work to rebuild them, and the poll agreed to no quests. Just seems strange to poll 1 item off the original drop table.
---
Nerfs are part of the game. Only wanting buffs only leads to power creep.
---
Yes, they are. 
---
anytime m8
---
Jesus wth... tbh though that looks like a future secret quest area maybe? Or maybe it’s a secret jmod only hideout where they play a pirate game in the ship :) 
---
1 promo a week would be so awesome i wouldnt even care about it and neither would majority osrs players care either only seems to be a reddit minority.. currently the constant th promo spam every time you log in flashing is too much, its kinda like buying a bottle of tequila with your buddy, yeh you could drink the whole thing yourself but youd become very sick, or split it with your buddy and have a great night buzzing, same thing here , i believe if they reduced mtx by 50% it would be so much better and bring players back possibly over taking osrs in population.

Is it common knowledge these days that Zuk attacks are separated by 7 ticks? I had no idea when doing my cape like a year ago, would have been nice to know at the time! Are Zuks regular attacks equally spaced too? Not that they're hard to dodge, just curious. 
---

Now that is a real concern. While I never personally have a problem with ping, I could see why people might find it unplayable. Especially Australia, for example.
---
Yep, I'm not sure when it happened but it's been a bit and very noticeable when doing things like olm. So when the server lags everything that is currently on your screen will be there when it unfreezes, so if you have crystals beneath you and it lags all you need to do is spam click and it'll resume the second that it left off at so you don't get shafted by them.
---
8032 tokkul, ur account is now mine buddy gg
---
No its lose lose because I guarantee you the second they add mtx to osrs there's gonna be outrage and people are gonna leave. Its never EVER gonna pass a single poll on osrs so dont even try. Rs3 would also lose because less mtx = less money and we all know new players are gonna drop from nowhere.
---
y u do this jag x
---
i want the drop not the key
---
and a lot of the people who do have it unlocked dont even use it
---
source: me

And most RL users already use this anyway... People are weird.

What PvM is there other than Slayer zulruh vork other than raids?
---
I believe alot will support 1 measly promo a week a fraction of what rs3 has to endure, your just a reddit minority, still waiting for some more opinions before i call it a day, cuz if it was other way round i would support it, its 1 promo bro its nothing? have you logged onto rs3 only to be spammed with a flashing TH icon every 2 mins? that is only time it bothers me.. 1 promo a week sounds like a dream.
---
yeah but i do other shit in between runs... its just very annoying to be the minority affected by this update but i guess i have to suck it up

More info pls

100,000 damage taken
---
100% Proc Elysian:  
---
100,000 \* 0.75 = 75,000 damage taken  
---
75,000 / 16 = 4,688 doses of Brew, or 1,172 Saradomin Brews  
---
4,688 / 3 = 1,563 doses of Super Restore, or 391 Super Restores  
---
1,172 + 391 = 1,563 inventory slots
---
Divine:  
---
100,000 \* 0.7 = 70,000 damage taken to HP  
---
100,000 \* 0.15 = 15,000 damage to Prayer  
---
70,000 / 16 = 4,375 doses of Brew, or 1,093 Saradomin Brews  
---
4,375 / 3 = 1,459 doses of Super Restore, or 365 Super Restores  
---
15,000 / 32 = 469 doses of Super Restore, or 118 Super Restores  
---
1,093 + 365 = 1,458 inventory slots  
---
Here's where you messed up. When drinking a Saradomin Brew, every 3 sips, you take a sip of Super Restore to restore your stats, which also restores Prayer. Because your Prayer is restored automatically as a result of restoring your stats after healing with a Brew, you essentially save...
---
1,563 - 1458 = 105 inventory slots.
---
can someone explain why this is happening?

That guy was on crit1kals stream last night

No, those 2 next to start belong to the west side when im mining west. Some of the western rocks take too much running to reach, the ones at start are shorter.

Sure, I suppose this is extra true with chaos ele pet as it's not very rare. I just don't understand why anyone would find joy in doing this to another player is all. It's the fact that you would screw someone over when you don't get much of anything from it. Ik it's just a game but still.

This moron, or troll, would like to poll rs3 players  asking if they think osrs should get mtx, so that rs3 can afford to do less mtx. He thinks it will allow rs3 to 'prosper' and that osrs needs to pull its own weight. He also thinks most of the player base won't care because it'll only be once a week. 
---
What he doesn't realise is that osrs makes more revenue than rs3 without any mtx, and a huge portion of the players there left rs3 because of the mtx. He's just a sad boy who would rather see osrs burn than stop playing a dead game
---
Ah the old trick, if your post doesn't make it to the front page in 2 hours, shuffle the words randomly and repost it
---
This. I’ve done 2 chests and got 1 drop (DH helm)
---
Poll: Should captcha be added?
---
probably saddo irl trying to make people angry
---
Mtx would kill osrs so fast lmao
---
The other day I “married” two guys at Ge and then we had a gay orgy using in game emotes. Easily the most fun I’ve ever had playing rs. 
---
In a barely legible way too
---
nice, now you can finally play the game
---
Okay i get it. You want mtx in osrs. We don't. Please stop posting about it. If osrs gets mtx, I'm sure most of us would quit. Don't need to keep posting about it. 
---
I feel attacked but mostly ripped off
---
OK so what would be the downside of a weapon that was twice as slow as whip but hit twice as hard. unbalanced in pvp?
---
So it'll be useless like smithing?
---
Lets assume the MTX poll passes and MTX is implemented in OSRS, why would Jagex lower the amount of MTX in RS3? Jagex stands to make even more money if they just put MTX in both games. Your argument doesn't make sense and it will never happen.
---
Gz. 
---
Side note: your friend seems like a pest.
---
Yeah its getting there. Arrow tracking, trident, food, potions, teleports all accounted for, the ability to add anything from a drop down menu and edit/delete the amount. Just finishing up the gui and adding cannonball tracking
---
so laggy its hard to watch tbh
---
[[zpoon doesn’t lick salty bollocks]]
---
Why are you spamming this nonsense? You have received zero support, yet you keep trying. I am willing to bet my left nut that not a single person who plays Old School RuneScape supports micro-transactions/promos. If you don't like the fact that RuneScape 3 runs on micro-transactions.. Stop playing it. 
---
I seriously hope this is a troll. Otherwise you might be the dumbest person to ever post here, which is saying a lot.
---
That's it.
---
I feel like I should edit my post because I'm not aiming for raising the max hit much. If we make an extremely accurate weapon a tick or so slower than the whip, it can have identical max hit and still be better in a high defense situation. Now this means it will be worse than the whip at med/low defense monsters.
---
RS3 isn't the main game anymore. OSRS reached double, maybe even triple the playernumbers nowadays so don't go spouting bullshit here.
---
Biggest and only issue I had with warding was the idea to add new obelisks into the world they looked like an eyesore tbh.
---
Any way you could post this on imgur in like 2 separate posts or something? I’d love to read this but my phone zoom makes all the letters blurry :(
---
Has Jagex addressed in any way shape or form the Authenticator Delay or Hiding Poll results? Memes aside, it really is such a simple yet popular request and is on the basis of commonsense.
---
My accounts been hacked a few years ago and my authenticator was removed immediately, I was at work all day out on site so I was nowhere near a computer to stop it. Authenticator was essentially useless.
---
And I will admit I sometimes won't even bother voting when I see an overwhelming amount of no's or yes's that I think my vote won't do anything so I don't bother.
---
If Jagex has addressed this, I would really love to know why they won't do it without sounding irredeemably unprofessional &amp; stupid.

If you have 40 prayer and are perfect at prayer flicking you can beat the fight caves with basically anything.

I am using dhcb and dragonfire ward and I'm getting destroyed by the mage attacks. It's so bad I sometimes get 2 kills per trip. I want to mage pray because ranged defence in maxed vorkath gear is \~170. Mage defence is \~126. But I'm being told to pray range. I don't get it.

Once you kill him the first time, the lack of pressure and stress makes it more fun to kill him again. 25k slay XP BTW.

I do Nazi what he did there. Anne Frankly you should explain. 
---
While I do think this is a good idea, as people who are not streamers (although less likely) can record their screens along with streamers, I don't think it will ever be implemented. Jagex's customer service is already trash, and they probably can't accommodate this increased workload.

Just go to bounty world and they can’t pj you, problem solved..

---
Vote now on your phones!
---
I'm not sure what you mean when you say I'm adding them, I'm simply taking the total amount of prayer points the ely trip has due to the restores you said it would have, and the total amount of prayer points the divine trip has due to the restores you said it would have as well as the points that would be lose because of the divine. You could point out where I said something about adding different restore values, maybe I misspoke somewhere and I could try to fix it, but I'm going to summarize the main point I'm trying to make more clearly below so there's no confusion, so let me know what is it about the 2 paragraphs below that you disagree with.
---
The main point is that, like I said, the inventory you describe for the ely trip would have 1563 doses of restore, like you said in your calculations, which is 50016 prayer points, giving us 50016 seconds of prayer usage if we have 1 prayer point per second being drained. 
---
The divine trip you said has 1459 doses of restore, the divine drains 469 doses worth of restore if we use up all our brews, which is the number you gave, so that would leave only 990 restores for restoring the prayer that we lose from having our prayer turned on. 990 * 32 is 31680 prayer points of regular prayer drain we can recover, meaning the divine trip can only last 31680 seconds, a much shorter trip than the ely's trip.
---
Are you implying that the guy who figured it out, also didn’t test it? You’re not making any valid points?
---
No. We don't need this. Go to RS3.
---
Agreed. HCIM combines all factors including external ones such as DCing. Implementing such a feature would make it stupidly easy
---
Just call it "runic armor" :)
---
What are you aiming for more points or more xp?
---
Yes it is, I've talked to him a couple times in-game and he confirmed. Cool account.
---
&gt; warding is to magic armour what smithing is to melee armour and crafting is to ranged armour.
---
So either useless or a source of alchables. That doesn't exactly elicit confidence in the skill idea.

Level 1-2 takes 9 lamps, 2-3 takes 5, 3-4 is 4 lamps, 30-31 is 5 lamps, 50-51 is 22 lamps, 80-81 is 222 lamps. You use more lamps at higher levels so you can’t just take the average xp of each level, it needs to be a weighted average, and the higher level lamps will have a much greater impact on the average xp/lamp since there’s more of them.

Even if you assumed just 1 dboot every 4 hours per world, that's over 300 mil in a day lol
---
I haven’t played this game in a long long time , for reference , I stopped right around the time the grand exchange was first unveiled. My old account is long lost , I attempted to get it back a few years back and it wasn’t viable. I’ve been mulling around the idea of getting back into things , specifically playing the “old school” version which to me is the only version I know. 
---
So my question is this , has the game changed to the point where it’s no longer recognizable to what I was used too ? I’d love to be able to experience the fun of my childhood again. 
---
well, i want to complete my clue?
---
"Welcome to old school runescape" at the top, I'm sure this is legit
---
Multiple recoveries normally lock an account until it's manually reviewed. They're pretty good at determining who the real original owner is. 
---
Also are you positive your email is secure? Normally you need access to the accounts email to disable the 2fa, unless it's disabled after a recovery.
---
Ah, a downvote farmer
---
Has nothing to do with your current exp. Reason: thousands have found a way to train crafting without it 
---
It fucking annoys me so much youtubers haven't done the bar crawl and end up with 20 empty vials in their inventory.
---
it doesn't bother me *that much*, but it's just an unnecessary inconvenience. It's not like I sit there fuming banging my keyboard if I happen to die during a clue scroll step.
---
They should split to question.
---
1a - do you want this feature
---
1b - should it be split for PvP and PvE
---
Out of curiosity, how big loots do you get from those who forget their valuables in their inv?
---
You did this quest before you got 99 defense impressive, must have been a really difficult fight.
---
The free version of runelite had the same features osbuddy premium used to have. I don't know if that's still the case.
---
Rimmington
---
It came out a year and a half ago but I agree with your idea
---
Ok lets just remove all f2p content.
---
Thank you old school team! 
---
I think it's awesome, just being able to see what you're wearing already on the fly is so convenient.
---
That is some poor plating.
---
Why a defense pure? Nobody makes defense pures.
---
It looks like a weird hat, maybe a coif. It certainly isn’t something I would call a helmet
---
yeah he knows, he just means that this is a fresh install, so his custom settings aren't applied yet. 
---
Its 10 bucks dude, skip a coffee or energy drink or one beer a week and that'll pay for a month...
---
How much tithe did you really so though? Seems like you haven't finished the set so last day only?
---
This isn't 'farming' mysterious emblems at all, this is just BH pking.
---
Farming emblems is having multiple accounts set up to kill eachother to gather lots of emblems. 
---
R/streetwear
---
It's apparently disabled after a recovery, and the hijacker has changed the email tied to the account. Not sure how Jagex decided an email address that was never tied to the account was the owner while my address that has been on the account for many many years isn't the true owner lol
---
He's also ranked #1 in BH for a UIM
---
r/whoooosh
---
Jeez...
---
I’ve only just recently started playing this game again, where is this?
---
r/streetwear
---
It's not a big deal. It's just an unnecessary inconvenience. And the frustration at least for me comes from the fact that there's very little I can do (except hover logout like you said) if a random person wants to waste my time. I'm not interested in this game's PVP at all, so trying to anti-pk is equally a waste of my time doing something I don't enjoy. 
---
damn straight
---
Took me a sec
---
Pro tip: dont die
---
True, does anyone know why gems crashed
---
Yeah let's just cater the game toward ironmen again. Sorry idiot you don't get anything special this time 
---

A swastika is the other way around. This is the sign of peace in hinduism.
---
With those stats, there isn't really a "fast" way of making money.
---
Combat - depending on the monster(s), you can get decent loot, not sure which as I'm not really a combat person.  \[Slayer included\]
---
Non-Combat skills - again, low-level skills won't be as beneficial.  
---
Money-making with the following skills/levels would be more beneficial  
---
Mining - 65+  
---
Smithing 40+  
---
Fishing - 40+  
---
Cooking - 40+  
---
Woodcutting - If member, 15+, and convert oak logs into planks (100gp per plank), can sell each plank for like 300-400+.   Alternatively, it would be 45+ for maples, yews, etc.  
---
Those are probably the mainstream ones.
---
squatters rights bro
---
Damn thats sick! 
---
I've never been a fan of Combat in general, but I love the Defence Cape.
---
Which is why I've been debating on end-game; 99 Magic/Range/Pray/Def.
---
Though, I'm not really sold on much besides Defence, and I love Skilling, hence why Defence-Pure to begin with.
---
smh didn't do the entirety of [/r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/6386cf/high_resolution_image_of_final_rplace_image/)
---
But sometimes that doesn't help and then you add 3-4 more sites. I once did it and even some shady gold selling site reporting about the thing came first before wiki result...
---
You just gave your friend your phone let's be honest.
---
&gt; Log Horizon might also be something to look into
---
Seconding this. I'm watching it now and I absolutely love the social politics.
---
Feet!
---
Overused ‘joke’
---
You know the drill.
---
I’d recommend only using the crystal bow while you’re learning sire. The extra range makes messing up a little more forgiving. Once you’ve got a few KC under your belt and you’re more confident, definitely switch to the blowpipe for better DPS.
---
Does this mean we can finally unban the dude that was [permed for lighting a swastika fire?](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8i896x/two_years_ago_i_got_permabanned_for_lighting_a/)
---
it would require some actual work and prowless at their job. Jagex simply cannot do it
---
I'm not looking for 1m an hour more like 350k in 4 hours. I just need 350k now. I'll look into the planks thanks.
---
Pretty good idea you can look up a guide and set your own runelite one if you're busy somewhere else. Also fix your actual bank my man what's with the scattered potions everywhere?
---
Tbh i use the bow to save me from having to use staminas
---
So accurate, even the ammy. Would love to see more of these fundamental RS moments!
---
Still only takes 2 sire stuns bout 95% of the time too
---
Hey can I post you on reddit
---
Just play the game and not worry about money. The money will come in after you gain levels.
---
blowpipe is better objectively speaking, the range of the crystal bow saves you some run energy which can be nice at low agility levels
---
I mean it's a glorified extra drop table with extra steps. I don't care the mechanics or the key functionality, I'm just concerned about economy impact on these item values
---
What possible reason could I give for not wanting to hide them? It’s an unnecessary expenditure of energy and resources. Y’all keep saying it biases results, but just because everyone else is voting for something you don’t want doesn’t mean you have to vote for it, are you silly or something??? It’s like if you see 83% of people voted yes and you were going to vote no, you can still vote no... there’s nobody holding a gun to your head....
---
Y’all want Jagex to coddle you like this but it’s entirely unnecessary. Remember when nothing was polled and they just gave us shitty updates without even asking? We’re lucky enough to have polls at all, y’all need to stop peddling minutiae.
---
Whats the point in that? Jagex servers dc 1000x more than my net does
---
Yes
---
At 77 range with eagle eye, maybe not
---
Mine your best ore and sell that or smith iron or steel bars.
---
Gold jewelry is a small profit if you buy the bars and not the ore.
---
Cut and fletch your best log and sell the bows.
---
Fish your best fish and sell them.
---
With your stats, there aren’t really any great money makers unfortunately.
---
I only have 30 something kc so far so my mechanics arent great yet.  I can manage to get 2-3 kills per trip now but I still fuck up sometimes. 
---
No u
---
No you both
---
There's no reason to over complicate the gathering process. Why should runic energy exist when runecrafting already crafts runes, and they are overabundant?
---
Make it take base materials and runes to make a piece, and other steps can be removed.  For example; Making a splitbark body should require 5x bark, 10x nature runes, 20x water runes, 20x earth runes (theme the rune costs). Adding all these extra steps and items is needless.
---
If you want to spice it up, you could have 2 crafting steps; 
---
* 5x bark is turned into a Splitbark Body (u) - generates 40% of the overall XP - These are tradeable but with no stats and unequippable, literally (u) bows.
---
* Splitbark Body (u) is then empowered with runes to become a full Splitbark Body - generates 60% of the XP
---
The whole splashing on pillars should be changed to splashing on the altar directly generates extra magic xp as if you had done damage or some shit. It should have nothing to do with a new skill and just be a nice update to push splashers into denser areas.
---
This won't really help out stats but looting in pvp world's or edgeville pking worlds can be pretty good money. 
---
I'm not looking for millions. I've only been playing for 3 days ik my stats are shit. I've been playing RuneScape for years I had full torva and Max cash stack. If you can't contribute anything useful don't speak.
---
If you keep a full inventory or items (so turn of vial smashing) then you don't need ice gloves
---
not so different from my real boss
---
Someone misspelled anus.
---
About 1-2m depending on how many teleport scrolls and runes they have.
---
Ik I'm not worried about money it's just the quest guide I'm following says to get 350k from bowstrings but bots have ruined that.
---
&gt;It’s like if you see 83% of people voted yes and you were going to vote no, you can still vote no... there’s nobody holding a gun to your head....
---
The issue is people don't vote their mind when they see biased results sometimes. That's the problem.
---
Thanks. I've just learned about new one this week when old one kept redirecting me to the page for Spade faming tool.
---
Planks would be easiest then.
---
East Varrock bank, chop some tree's down.
---
Logs I think can be sold ~30gp each on Grand Exchange.
---
100gp to convert to planks north-east of East Varrock's bank (outside the walls).
---
And then, the planks should be around 250-400gp each.
---
Even if you don't feel like woodcutting, so long as you have money to buy logs and convert them, you should be able to make profit.
---
Heheh
---
Not with 77 ranged.
---
Just kill the healers ? 
---
Looks like vomit
---
Put yourself in combat and see what happens?
---
Doesnt make a difference, still too far away.
---
Ik just need 350k asap as this quest guide requires it
---
Its hard to aggro them ánd get your prayer flicks and positioning right if you’re inexperienced. I had the same problem back in the day
---
I am guessing your issue might be related to using alien blue, I loved that app myself but it hasn’t been supported for over a year now and stopped supporting new things and such. I switched to Apollo switch is a lot like alien blue but actually maintained. Just figured I’d mention 
---
75 attack that low is basically useless and you're a free smite. Definitely get 99 strength. 
---
lame i dont understand this
---
Can you elaborate on the blowpipe part?? 
---
3/5 is an unfortunate fraction to use
---
Thanks for the help man. I'll do the planks. Haven't played in 10 years completely forgot everything about early game.
---
IGN is Orawyn I'll add you thanks
---
I wanted the same thing so I did a bit of googling, there’s a little [video on Youtube](https://youtu.be/YmMagBQ3b9Y) where someone shows the whole thing!
---
make another one of her with dagannoth rex
---
How is it compared to mlm? 
---
How do you remember your name at computers where you are not signed in automatically? 
---
I sure wouldn't want to rewatch someone do Wintertodt for 40 hours every month.
---
No OSRS will still very much feel like the game you played many years ago. Theres a lot of new content but even that feels within the bounds of where the game was back in 2007. It’s very nostalgic still. 
---
Yo op what guide are you using dude? 
---
  
---
Also why not just fish?
---
You could do the quest on a maxed acc on the unrestricted world but that’s about it. 
---
Only enough for the full outfit, the last round of tithe farm completed the farmers top and also the 99!

It's 5 years old but seems to be working out well.
---
And I haven't played early game in 12 years I know nothing about it anymore. Would fishing be able to get me the 350k in about 4 hours?
---
What’s your thoughts on this being an expansion to rune crafting rather than a stand alone skill? 
---
If you get 35 smithing you can make cannonballs 100k+ an hour 
---
Much faster. 
---
lol wussy retards like you are the reason community is so pussylike

He says all this shit about being sorry he killed him... then why did you? Idiot

O

you're retarded

Yeah.

Do it the other way around. When someone changes back tabs, bring up the associated gear thingy associated with the tag.
---
Oh, thanks for explaining, I dont think that book is very known in sweden I guess
---
what i always do is manually hide them i don't fuck with the treshold just press shift and click on the X and it will always hide the item

As others said just so highest tier trees.

If you don't wanna break the bank do papaya, calquat, mahog, hespori, spirit

why did you post a picture of yourself
---
Ur also physically able to steal money out of a wallet u found on the ground before returning it to the owner, but if you do ur a dick.
---
Last I checked there was only one ZMI world, which having other people around makes it far easier to make the run and is one of the draws to using this altar in the first place. I also dont think hes asking for a ban, it seems more like OP would prefer it if the click option were to be removed, similar to how pets behave now.
---
Lumbridge is definitely a turd sandwich 
---
No one and I mean no one on this sub or in the OSRS community is going to support a promo week! You don't get this do you? Seriously are you retarded? OSRS is not the game that needs saving, RS3 is. Quit being a delusional fucking idiot. 
---
Quit wasting your breath with this post. Do us all a favor and go log into one of those Double XP phishing sites. Then fucking neck yourself.
---
After reading this I want this so much that it made me sad knowing it probably won't happen... You clearly put in a lot of effort and even thought about reviving lots of currently dead content.
---
Great job!
---
I think they picked this one specifically cause some complain about skill gap, not so sure its that big of a deal though
---
It took me less than 10 minutes to get the full outfit btw. It's extremely easy to acquire.
---
Welcome to current year, where everything has to be 100% convenient to the players otherwise they will complain about it.

---
**THERE IS NOTHING TO LEARN**
---
that dude needs to fuckin chill out
---
I'm personally of the opinion graceful is overrated but for the activities that you do use it for it is very good e.g. it makes runecrafting far less irritating.
---
Let them complain! Nothing is more destructive to this game than giving the community everything they want..
---
Implying disconnections are never server sided
---
If it's that much of an issue for you, even on blowpipe longrange, just bring a crystal bow or some sort of longbow to lure the healers. Change your prayer, change weapon, change your prayer, click healer, change your prayer, etc.
---
You really shouldn't worry about trying to out dps 4 healers, the fight will go too long even if you can eventually do it and you will make a mistake
---
Why do you need run at sire??? 
---
Someone turn this into a brainlet meme
---
Wiki is a decent resource but by no means exhaustive.
---
Yes. I’ve been teleblocking them in wildy last night. They run to level 20 and stand still. Then another attack triggers auto retaliate so I entangle then surge spell to death. 
---
Wait for the ones that have been there a while. More bones. 
---
That's exactly what random events were for before you could skip them. They attacked and teleported players away from their spots to inconvinience bots who ignored them in order to slow down their bot efforts
---
&gt;But too much abuse would come from it  
---
I don't understand your pov on this at all, why would people take that type of risk? 
---
It's pretty decent on members world but on F2P is pretty awful.
---
unDERT
---
Tfw pvmers jump over the ditch 
---
&gt; They are filling a several niches (making magical armor, deprecate rat splashing, some rc tie ins, etc)
---
A skill shouldnt be implemented to "fix splashing" you should just "fix splashing" not make a skill to achieve whats easy to achieve.
---
&gt; with a skill that makes sense in a world where magic exists.
---
No it doesnt make sense. I have already pointed this out to you. I need not repeat myself. At the very best warding would just be a skill like alchemy, enchantment, but it would never be a stand-alone skill.
---
Yeah so keep swiping your credit card for xp lamps 😂👌
---
All the throwaway account have stolen 4 letter usernames, what a waste
---
Inflation = devaluation of money, so then they'd cost more money. Sure, inflation happened to rs3 (look at swap rates) but that's not why whips are worthless 
---
helo im ababy
---
Yeah you can cast magic, that doesnt mean we make alchemy, conversion, curses, charges, superheat, enchantment their own skills, rofl. Theres zero justification for that. At worst warding is a very dumb idea, at the very best its just another spell in the spellbook.
---
It’s rarer than 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 letter names.
---
Account protection is xp waste though 
---
not worth it with a cooking cape really
---
You mean.... hornless unicorn riding skill? 
---
So sad. RIP 
---
Because Wildy Alter exists
---
How is anything more important than these sexy drawings you make? Unless it's the spicier version...
---
No, its not. Its a craft though, it reveals that in the name. Its deeply justified in the lore since in order to play as the human race on OSRS we needed magic, otherwise we would play as elves, and there was a scarcity of runes in the game which is why runecrafting was invented so we could survive. Is there a scarcity of magic armour? No, rofl, magic armour has only gotten better, theres also no justification or explanation of it in the lore. Fabricated nonsense that doesnt make sense.
---
Back in 2001-2004 you were promoted to make friends and interact with other players to buy/sell stuff. My friend and I helped Bluerose13x from mith up, so not only were we rewarded with adam, then rune items whenever we wanted, we got reliable gold, could focus other skills and got to help a player/friend reach a real milestone. With the GE, you don't know where your items are going or coming from and you don't need to interact with anyone at all. Everyone just afks at fishing spots or bots, so there is no conversation to be had.
---
Bots weren't nearly as popular either. Now you can just bot a few days, sell your stuff immediately and transfer the gold or sell it before you're banned...if you even get caught. Prices didn't flucuate nearly as much before the GE either. The price of lobsters has dropped significantly within the span of 1 week, pretty much making my time that I invested since starting back up worth between 25-40% less than just 1 week ago. Highly demotivating.
---
With the GE you can just buy the stuff you need to train whatever, instead of going out to get it and experiencing the world. Yeah it's convenient for the most part...but it takes away a huge part of what made Runescape.
---
why would anyone vote yes on something that's going to bite them in the ass?
---
Are you saying the skill should never have any updates or what are you saying? Genuinely don’t understand your point or why you’re commenting
---
Who......? 
---
Yes, I actually did read it and I appreciate your effort to clear up the potential of the warding skill. Unfortutely a scuffed divination and invention and runespan skill just doesn't get me too excited. Runescape has some boring skills, no doubt about that. But the new skills that got introduced like construction, farming, summoning and dungeoneering even hunter are in my opinion way more fun to me than this. Just cuz it useful doesn't mean it has to be a new skill. Cuz if this fails, all future new skills are gonna suffer from this failure. We'll see what the community votes and I'll accept the outcome of the polling system whatever it is :) 
---
The poll thing I don’t really mind, but it’s absolutely retarded that there is no Authenticator delay. And the reason is so fucking stupid too. “People mind get locked out of their accounts for a few days” boo fucking hoo it’s better than having their items stolen. 
---
You don't need to get through the 2fa or even get into the email. When someone gives enough information about you, jagex will change the account email to their email. 
---
Trying to take a photo of me Achieving 123,456,789 XP , thought I'd try and make my health, prayer, run and specc energy count up as well, forgot that combat gives xp obviously when speccing the Dragons downstairs.....sorry for the bank flex
---
Why are people always dropping mithril pickaxe? I always pick em up to alch. First off why are they consistently dropped more than a lot of other &gt;500gp items? Where are they getting them and what are people using them for (obviously besides just mining until they can use Addy)?? 
---
This changed my life!
---
Sorry. But more customization is great. Fuck this sub's option phobia, it is really pissing me off now.
---
well, becoming a member certainly makes the grind infinitely easier. are you a hc? I did a significant portion of my grind in f2p before becoming a member because (im dumb) i wanted to have a "jump start" on things before membership.  
---
you can add me in game and i'd love to talk about it "Ara Mitama"
---
Well, it doesn't change the fact that they were aiming for 2006 &amp; 2007, they probably would had tried with the later backups if that was the only choice but doubt it would have had that much of success

"shaking", because someone feels bad about taking someone's bank JFC.

---
Okay mr 2277 total level
---
the fact that you assume everyone that disagrees with your dumb and pussylike opinion is a pker tells everything about dumbfuks like you. also you nerds literally have no argument against what I said that's why you resort to insulting instead of trying to prove me wrong, that's why tardos like you need to be put down

I just finished get 95-99 prayer in one day with superiors. Saving a ton of time using them over normal dragon bones was worth the 100m
---
Barrows or Zulrah will be best I think.
---
Runescape and real life are philosophically one in the same. Repetitive grinding to reach a goal. And just like in Runescape, you can only have a chance at good rng if you are actively grinding objectives.

True this

What wep should I get for them? Toxic Blowpipe or Staff of the Dead + Fire Tome for Barrows?

i will never understand how people can use these clients. it turns osrs into a ugly Chinese mmo...
---
Ok but why did you blur out the GE price on the first row? What’s the reason?
---
Only few problems would be with the few coop quests and some minigames, like ba for torso, unless you could locally use several accounts at the same time.
---
Nope, got mine at 470 and the only unique I had was the draconic visage at like 15kc
---
In fact, I'd go even further and say it's not at all true. There are numerous scientific studies that show how easily people give in to herd mentality and just go with something they know for a fact is wrong just because the mob says otherwise. Additionally, most people's thought process starts and ends at "new content = good". They don't care what it is, and they don't care if long-term fans like it. They believe that game devs are infallible and that any content they want to add is fair game and that everyone should just shut up and take it. So yeah. u/Rpgwaiter, hiding poll results is important because it *forces* you to have an opinion of your own if you are going to vote. You can't just bandwagon 
---
You’re fucking amazing
---
My brother got me one of these back in the day. It had really poor info even then. But I suppose its scope was limited to F2P so there wasn't much to go on about.
---
Haha I used to have that card in my sliver deck
---
You're literally asking how to get 100k an hour with those stats and outside of merching its probably not possible at all. 
---
I personally thought you were trolling. If you don't have stats, you either sell bowstring, pick up other people's loot, make planks, do any other tedious shit like grinding unicorn horns into dust or actually get levels...
---
no respec at all
---
Imagine being a person that gets off on ruining other people’s day.
---
It just hit me... If Jagex take old passwords as a form of account recovery, does that mean that they store it in plaintext and that the Support team has access to them?  
---
That's a big yikes.  
---
The quest is easy, 250k is basically free, 2500 casts is a lot. 
---
If you're unvaccinated you can start right now!
---
Not dry, great RNG, shit items. Big difference.
---
Yea I know, stuff get scraped all the time but this just seems like a project doomed from the start. I can't recall the last time a major update had this much controversy and so divided amongst the community. With that in mind realistically I think we will see a high 60s to low 70s yes for Warding when polling comes along. 
---
Jagex give us funding, but they don’t host the servers.
---
Check out this [awesome Jad guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R80nL7csRY) by b0aty. I also had a lot of trouble with healers but by walking on specific tiles you can force the healers into a pattern where it's easier to lure them behind Jad. It's how I finally got my cape after 7+ attempts. And like a previous commenter said, always pay attention to Jad first, then do your move command/prayer sip/attack command.
---
All I wanted was an answer like this, instead I just got downvotes. And also cannon balls are 100k plus an hour and I can do them so it's possible.
---
Well the pic has 1 smithing
---
Cerb only has 1 good drop- I would like cerb more if her other 3 uniques held value
---
Because OSRS is the real easyscape.
---
Yes it is hard lol. The odds of stacking that much damage is extremely  low 
---
Yh my bad I finished knights sword after this and just grinded from 29-35
---
I drool over burning amulets
---
I usually start by setting up a gp filter to only show stuff over at around 400gp or more
---
#black(chins)livesmatter
---
Difference is that this guy has probably been doing the fight caves since OSRS got released. 
---
Tap alt twice.  Problem solved. 
---
Tbh I get you, but for this subreddit of people who hate ezscape, I would have just said, looking for low level money, and not posted stats.
---
[Took me 8 tries.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eLo2P9kZ9k)
---
sadly this wont happen, jagex are ruining runescape again... :(
---
This community holy shit. I don’t even play osrs I just love it here 
---
Yh I get it. It's just the guide was saying bowstrings but it's 5y old so I wanted to see if there was something else outside of that for the 350k
---
all you had to do was literally put the name you thought it was into google and there he is
---
why
---
Nothing. Skills have to make sense  for them to be added. It means, you can intuitively think what would and could be skills in this game. So if you cant come up with something by just thinking "naturally" then it probably shouldnt be added. 
---
The ditch seperates the wilderness from the rest of the world.  The world is more interesting if it seems a little more dangerous. 
---
He does great work, support
---
&gt; i really wonder why someone who has so much money invested into his hcim being successful
---
but he doesn't. He can just make a new one and get just as many viewers if not more. He's the top RS streamer, people tune in whether hes red or not. 
---
&gt;I don’t think people being weak minded is something Jagex can fix.
---
That isn't something Jagex can fix, agreed, but if they hide poll results till after people vote then it wouldn't matter if people were weak-minded.
---
Level 3 w/ firecape btw.. In rs3 though.
---

---
Void takes 12 hours
---
Zulrah takes almost no time to learn
---
He’s right. If you’re part of the skilling discord, look at the slayer info tab.
---
Otherwise [here](https://imgur.com/a/Vhft6tS) are some screenshots. They go into more detail too
---
Basically there are different zones in this minigame, one zone has the zombies which drop pieces of the clothing (this is the zone you'll look for, it's the same room every time). 
---
But it's not a guaranteed drop from one zombie, but luckily they will keep respawning so you can just stick around until you get your piece. If they stop spawning then pick up some of the planks they drop and they should start spawning again.
---
You can only get one piece per run though so you'll need to find the zone 4 times.
---
I did :)

My brother and his friend lured me for my addy 2h in 2005. I was 7 at the time, so I cried to my mom and she made him give it back to me. He still brings it up to this day. I'm 20 and he's 24. I don't know why either of us remember it.
---
Of course, he will still be, but him putting 2100 hours into something and him losing it, hurts more than we can imagine even if its just dumb pixel OSRS. 
---
You got this just breathe 
---
Can't you just download it and zoom in more?
---
&gt; hurts more than we can imagine even if
---
I died on my HCIM with higher total and more hours recently, I don't need to imagine :p I'm not saying that pain isn't there, just saying the financial loss is not actually massive
---
Get your hunter up :) ez game
---
Good boy
---
Since I'm an ultimate I am so fucked if I get hacked. Pin only saves LMS coffer but EVERYTHING else is free for the taking. Unique one off email/password for all of accounts with authenticator...
---
You got gang banged 
---
Post your rsn, I want to see a jmod comment on this
---
More than likely the account wasn't originally yours or someone got all your info and is using it to recover the account
---
Someone posted his viewers peak, and it was when he was always bossing, and he peaked on his other account when he DC'd, of course we don't know how much financially but he added 3k+ viewers from December, that can be a lot of $. 
---
You progress back up normally
---
Did you though, why are you here
---
I like it! Pubs/Inns are significant in most fantasy games but, aside from some quests, useless in osrs. Letting you chill on the bar stool with a beer to catch your breath sounds like a good thing to add!
---
Good gp.
---
Oh, you will return...they all do.
---
It's not worth doing without chinning, the difference is extremely high. 
---
Why is the dragon axe rising in price all of a sudden?
---
you basically just splash with melee, but instead of it being 13k/hr it’s like 6K 
---
Nieve task is terrible he suicided p2 because one guys whip broke and he was using a bgs
---
Older accounts still have security questions. Answering them is not usually enough to recover an account, though. Users must answer to several other questions for the recovery to pass, such as previously used passwords, account creation date, old isp:s, etc.  
---
Personally, I can't recover my oldest account (forgot password, email does not exist anymore) even though I can answer to the recovery questions that I have set myself long time ago. Answers to the other questions are just impossible to remember (like what was my ISP 15 years ago).
---
Did you have a spade? If you did, you were asking for it
---
GWD only has Troll Stronghold, Zulrah is starting regicide(so only underground pass), Raids 1 has 0 skilling req although having skills levelled are beneficial(ie dont be a leech), Raids 2 only has Priest in Peril as a req.

&gt; Reddit Karma
---
&gt; 89 (CC lads know what’s up)
---
&gt; Actually happened
---
By God it’s a karma farm
---
Yup intense mindless clicking is really fun, that's why everyone loves rc.
---
That's way better than afking while waiting for someone to appear.
---
Same here!
---
what counts as unrestricted
---
I don't understand what's going on here 
---
Shut up Serene.
---
cheers brother :) much appreciated, hope i can get in contact with him 
---
at least with rc u get hella money
---
That's my only guess. You can't be that good at the game to have gotten a fire cape and NOT know about the wildly mechanics. 
---
Either that or he grinded something for ages, bought barrows off of the GE and used a fire cape service. 
---
How would you calculate that? GP/XPs?
---
i said the same thing. I quit but stayed active on the sub.
---
here I am playing daily again
---
Just because you are low level doesnt mean high levels are not allowed to make easy money.
---
Now you get free dynamite daily since kebab diary... That's why
---
I mean, I’ve played a ton of mmo and none of them support or tolerate scammers. Why is runescape different?
---
That should make it cheaper not more expensive 
---
I dig it as long as it doesn't remove the stuff from your bank setting up the inventory and auto equipping it. Neet
---
The meme is that if you don't cover up specific stuff when you post a screenshot, someone will hack your account. People will comment shit like "forgot to cover up hp, gf account" so people started covering up random shit as a joke
---
That's what I was expecting lol
---
I haven't played for years, this sub has top-tier memes though, more entertaining than most
---
nah i'm still here, i made a mistake. ill still live on. just needs get fire cape and defender back haha
---
He probably had a friend do it for him. I’ve done like...9 firecapes for my buddies. It’s not even hard to get a firecape in the first place. 
---
I browse because I still have interest in the game so I like to see the major events and clips, although all the dogshit tier "memes" are putting me off quite a bit.
---
Haven't actually played since 2012 or so.
---
Unfortunately, no. That is the fastest f2p method.
---
The guy praying range and dying to the blue dragon seems to be purposefully giving up his HCIM status.
---
Better build for clanning would have been staying 75 atk and getting higher pray.  Maxed 75 atk pure with 99 pray is 93cmb. 
---
For deep wild no honour pking a good rule of thumb for a low level pure is keeping your hp level at about 5-10 levels higher than your combat level. So for example I’ve got an account with 60 attack, 70 strength, 87 range and magic, 45 prayer and 71 hitpoints at 66 combat, which I use for low level no honour pking. Quite a lot of 60 attack no honour builds have similar stats to that.
---
I remember Kripparian doing this when he was playing D3 Hardcore
---
hehe that's me, cheers man. i hope i can get in contact with him soon, bit of a big mistake lol
---
My clan is a devoted cashstack carrying into wildy clue hunter. We have a solid 5k members. So yeah there is LOTS of us.
---
The “please don’t hurt my feelings” movement, I think. There are so many games that have come out over the last few years that just.... put things in people’s hands for free. Even in real life now it’s about making absolutely everything fair, and some people have been coddled long enough in this era to become entitled little kids. Those are the people that complain about pvp.
---
Wildy slayer is 300 points per hour.
---
You should have  not using ilegall macros, now don't cry.
---
definitely not doing that again lol, never quitting runescape though hehe
---
Where and what is this axe hut?
---
Wait, what? Lmaooo. It's SINGLE WAY COMBAT, you aren't supposed to be tanking 15 people pjing. Even if you go successfully tank, you now have no food left but the dude you were fighting stil has near full and would probably run or tele before getting killed anyway leaving you to get killed by his butt buddies.
---
I didn't know this was a thing this is where I'll be training
---
How autistic can you actually be
---
Isn’t all that stuff going to be optional? if you don’t want to switch up your prayers then don’t. It’s just a bonus 
---
Come on jamflex at least do the authentication removal delay please

I actually prefer female arma helm over the male one but voted yes anyway because I'd prefer more consistency.

If it was really for reddit karma, this picture would have been entirely too easy to fake with a low level friend. It's not proof.

The item, when used in conjunction with divine spirit shield nearly broke every major money making boss. 
---
This sub has the best memes on all of Reddit. 
---
&gt; told his clan what level I was so they knew who to send
---
I ran this exact lure for a while - we only contacted people who were the right level to begin with. I didn't have a bunch of different accounts to get everyone, so basically only combat levels 89-91 were at risk (as I think I was level 90 at the time).
---
This lure ultimately got me a h'ween mask set on RS2. Apologies if you were one of my victims.
---
Unlock as a task and hose down everything with a blowpipe. You only have to aggro one or two healers also due to the fact an on task blowpipe does absurd dps
---
Not the guy, but i barely play (all though i’d like to), im just too busy playing other games. One day, i very well may just quit again, but even if i did ill always be subbed here. This sub is by far one of the funnier subs and more enjoyable communities of all the playerbases of other games/subreddits, i love it here lol. Plus, WAAY more original content then r/funny honestly fuck that sub.
---
They dont reset accounts and haven't for several years
---
yup and i also made like 10k for 4 minutes of collecting seeds.... from them dropping them.
---
Good money making method for new players
---
What is rwt?
---
Bought my sang a while back and have been watching it's price. It definitely spiked with the release of the lance because as someone else said, the lance increased global interest in CoX which is one of the places sang is most useful. I think this trend was picked up on by merchers. This can be seen in the staff's value bobbing up and down very frequently with the general trend being up. And since the staff has a low trade volume, the effects of being merched are more apparent (volatile price swings).
---
Sang is not an item to buy if you're going to be constantly stressing over its price - buy it if you're going to use it and write it off as a loss ahead of time, then you can be happy if it happens to go up.

Here's the tweet he stole this joke from.

I don’t see the point. There’s currently billions of password combinations and I don’t think adding uppercase letters is going to improve anything security wise.

Even EOC would be preferable to continuing this conversation just to give you an idea of how low you've set the bar.

---
because he moms credit card purchased it all, good thing he lost it all
---
Kebos release 
---
Maybe they could add certain zones you could hop in, like how's there's single and multi combat zones; I honestly couldn't care less about getting killed in the wild, I know what I'm risking, but it just feels shitty and breaks any immersion when someone pops up next to me and attacks me while I can't even Tele.
---
I need to make a pk account honestly

You must be new.

The potential for new tiers of magic armor alone makes this skill worth it to me especially to give f2p mages an upgrade

Id quit too if I lost all gear I purchased with moms credit card

I quit, but not for rage reasons, I'm just here for the dank memes really

It's raw

When enemies are stacked, whichever enemy you are interacting with currently goes to the top of the option stack. (I know this is true for PvP, not 100% certain for PvM)
---
*PULLS OUT MEAT GRINDER*
---
The obsidian sword, when combined with the obsidian armor set, has a 10% increased accuracy and damage. Perhaps with these bonuses, maybe even with using the berserker necklace too, the sword can reach similar DPS as the Dragon scimitar. 
---
here's a really good player using all of the cw mechanics to his advantage, he's great at predicting what other people are going to do

More password combinations only helps reduce the amount of hacks that are brute forced. Most hacks are not brute forced
---
They're labeled as unrestricted on the world selection list.  Unrestricted worlds are essentially test worlds where a player can go change their stats to anything and get any items they want.  Mostly used for practicing bosses and pking on certain builds.  It has no effect on your account in the main game.
---
Thank you West for looking in!
---
I really hope Warding passes, but not in a way that isn't atleast acceptable for everyone. I think posts like this will contribute a big deal to the discussion between players and developers to iron out potential issues and flesh out content we'd actually like to see. 
---
And not kneejerk misinformation people compile from bias and half-truths.
---
Looking forward to Jagex's point of view, and updates on the whole topic. =)
---
I'm almost entirely sure that it should be 'quiets down.' Quietens just isn't a real word. 
---
and only has level 53 RWT
---
But you can't loot? does the loot come up after a while? 
---
Will do. 
---
I read that, but do the stats not get updated when you equip it? if I switch out the obsidian sword I get way lower stats than with the dragon sword
---
You cant brute force a runescape password it doesn't matter anyways
---
There's nothing in the rules about it, I don't see a rwt reporting option ;]
---
Support support support.
---
Right it's not like the polls have any kind of integrity besides that. Don't get me wrong, I love how the system works, but as far as asking fair, unbiased questions for the sake of polling content, it's not like seeing poll results is the big flaw
---
That's a good skill 
---
Click the empty square.
---
i fail to see how any of this makes any sense whatsoever
---
sparc mac uses the duel arena as a proxy to rwt ask me anything
---
Vote no
---
Yeah could be. Thanks for the answer i think i will just buy one.
---
No, the stats don't update in the stats panel. It's just like wearing a Slayer helmet on task. It'll show at the bottom that you have a damage increase, but it won't reflect in your actual stats.
---
hi its me warm loaf gimme my money back
---
Had a similar situation but non-pk related. A guy legit got caught by the dragon hasta(p) scam(its trade value was double ge price for a time period) and he was begging people to help him make some money back because he had just saved up for a fury and traded for it because in trade window it looked like a great deal for him.
---
He eventually gave up and gave away all the hastas and quit. The man hadn't even hit 100 combat. The whole g.e. was crying for the man.  😞
---
I agree but instead I see it as a good thing. Runescape became completely fucked with 3. This is a chance to try and continue the game again but without the relentless fuck ups.
---
This... this is definitely depression or something
---
Stop training your Reddit Karma Farming skill and go play the game.
---
Is there a "only show the stuff you can pick up" version of this? I like seeing items I get as drops but don't need to see others.
---
Ironman btw
---
Thanks for the detailed answer. Im not to concerned about the cash so im just gonna buy one and hope for the best.
---
If I was, I deserved it for being young, dumb, and gullible. :)
---
Can you afford a berserker necklace? If so obsidian sword and armor will be the best against monsters without high defense. I would try to get some quests done and get the d scim for high defense monsters however.
---
he does seem to be doing a lot of clicking...
---
See I was looking around and read this too. But the thing is that I know that I used my email to make the OSRS account because it was the account with the ban for macroing. I made the account after 2010 so I assume the only way I could log onto the account was using my email for a username (i don't think I'm using the wrong username is what I'm trying to say). 
---
After appealing my ban and it going through, I tried to log onto the account using the info and I was back to tutorial island (keep in mind that it was a permaban that was appealed). So maybe they just delete the info on permabanned accounts because they assume that if they permaban the account, they will never read an appeal for that (says so in their FAQ on permabanned accounts) and they just go on to delete the data stored for it.   
---
Idk but I've already emailed the support who sent that my account has been unbanned in hopes for an explanation on it though.
---
common for deep wild pking
---
Perfect. Hey by the way once this guy gets banned or leaves I’ll take his place. Then I’ll take a picture of myself and post it here just to hear you whine more. And if you need your money doubled I can do that for you too.
---
Did you play on osrs or only on rs3? 
---
Thats one of the reasons i don't even bother usin 3-part stuff. I never got hacked before in my life. I have some decent bank, and i'm not famous (like youtuber or streamer) so if anything "magical" happen, i'm done. Too bad it's impossible to open more cleints using jagex default cl. I really wanted to test some stuff with 6\~7 accounts.
---
Perhaps a daily chance at your choice of a reduced size task. Multiple limiting factors would be the important part; daily, uncertain, reduced task size - perhaps reduced or even no slayer exp reward. There needs to be a significant trade-off for being able to choose your task if it were to even be considered as an option.
---
All it'll do is reduce the amount of votes per poll which os already incredibly low
---
too bad it requires 48 thieving, i think?  
---
i’m currently 27 haha. so if you have any tips on training from my level, i’d appreciate it xD
---
Wanna buy a box?
---
Thanks for explaining
---
OSRS will be max alive for 5 year max. thats literally the max it can go. The eco already fucked hard and the gear is getting too overpowered it will legit be like before but without a graphic update.
---
Killing 1 KQ is a hard task, getting the head is elite though
---
green is for the farmers and rich herb lore people 
---
Bandit camp is a hot-spot for clan fights if a team is hopping there they'll kill anyone just in case its a scout. 
---
On the real though you need 8 runes compared to 3 on ancients. Seems fair.
---
damn that’s nice. but the people there are probably just a couple of alt accounts?
---
Devastating.
---
Yeah that is not the case for barrows, I literally thought about this today. Your barrows npc always is on the bottom from others. ALWAYS. No idea why and it's especially annoying if ur on mobile because right clicking is aids 
---
Elder chaos robes for mage
---
idk dude, i still use my devout boots and vestment robes and i don’t really see any issues with splashing on them, mind you i have tormented brace and sol. 
---
Most third party clients aren't really cheating. It just makes accessing information that's available elsewhere more convenient
---
Lol i know the guy who lost
---
How did I completely miss last years? Eh was lack luster anyway
---
Ive got a friend that is very inexperienced but he was able to get a fire cape after a ton of tries. I seriously could see him doing this
---
You can also use a free amazon prime trial to get twitch prime for a 14 day membership.
---
We know, but you can't replace the account's settings no matter what you do, because the synced settings(defaults) will always overwrite them.
---
Yea, I'm aware but not looking to risk that much to be honest, I'm poor af. Would prefer to be skulled and kill green drag bots or something like that.
---
theres so many more features thats 100% considered cheating that pretty much everyone uses such as: antidrag, relocate prayers, freeze timers, tb timers etc...
---
yeah everyone that uses runelite is a cheater in my book
---
Surely it's based on the number of roles in the crate? Say if you get 3 roles in each crate every game it would be an average of like 300 games instead of 1000 1roll crates? 
---
It's  not worth it if it's a task over 30 wild, banking takes like 10 secs with burning Amy and glory.

To those of you that motivated me to do Z.m.i. I thank you. 
---
TBH the grind sucked and I still hate rc.
---
is this the whole question or did you mean to reply somewhere else? cuz if that's the whole question....wew, lad. anywhere you want really. quests are a good starting option as well as just exploring the map and trying all the skills out.
---
I’ve been doing the same thing as I’ve only played for about 2 years and the only bossing experience I have is JAD, and he even took me a long time before I managed to kill him. Zulrahs kinda a bitch to learn, might as well learn it where I’m not throwing money away.
---
That headband though
---
As a shit casual I always wished for an offline version of the game balanced for solo play. Increased xp and unique drop rates so that beating the game only takes hundreds of hours instead of thousands. 
---
I know, they even threw in matching boots!
---
Imagine not having yellow text on a black background
---
I knew he'd get back at me one way or another regardless of what I would have done, but I'm sure I did my fair share of embarrassing him throughout the years. We have a great relationship now, so I think I can let it slide, even though stealing my gp would typically be unforgivable lmao
---
Anything competitive, e.g. resources or drop parties
---
I see. So you're saying that the reason that the other guys attacks hit 'first' is also due to pid? Meaning that despite the poison hitting sparcmac first, they actually died in the same gametick; and the poisons actually hit at the same time despite appearing differently? 
---
So really, the other guy didn't really win and this should've ended in a tie, right?
---
Idk...this isn’t even two separate internet connections in the video. Just looks like two Ethernet/WiFi adapters connected to the same network.

If you want to have good bis but not risk much I would say go with your setup and bring time of fire. It’s an extra 500k but with normal spells it hits so hard. You you can hit 40s with fire surge and 30s with fire blast

Hahaha wow, that's some powrrful delusion you've got there.

Doesn't that involve everyone's loot, which doesn't really solve anything?

That's not what I said. The guy was stupid. But the mentality of "I'll kil anyone just in case" has a peak for some pkers.
---
The guy was stupid, but the pker didnt realize just how naive until he noticed literal bank on the ground. So he felt bad.
---
Hard to say, probably the influx of new players reaching the point they want the axe combined with fewer people doing DKs.  It's still super cheap compared to dpick, and worth buying.

I lost everything once and haven't been back, it's been 10 years.

There's people botting the farmer pickpocketing there for sure. They never miss a beat while pickpocketing and they always take the same awkward path to the bank and then stand in the bank for 20ish seconds to DROP their seeds instead of bank them, and they're usually there for like 10+ hours at a time.

Omg. Gargoyles is like the place to afk. I fell asleep there too but panic woke up before dying and tele'd out.

Lmao sit retard

Nice!

I usually just rock a black dhide set and some general mage defense armour (snakeskin boots, coif, anti-dragon shield) You’re way less likely to get killed and you risk like 10k

I got lured for 40m yesterday. I’m still playing.

No, he means the ancient art of pkers turning you into metal bars

Take red chins with you. When Jad is half health use the chins on him, or target individual healers, but using it on him should do the trick in aggroing them. After that, kill them all off so you don't have to worry about them fucking you up. Also, remember, 1 action per prayer switch, don't try to do too much. The people who tell you not to kill healers are stupid, as the healers can literally rape you and force you to not only be worried about the switches for Jad but also about your hp, prayer, etc. Just keep it simple and kill them.

Thank me for your cape later

Hmmmm

&gt; most of updates are like mostly done already before actually polling.

No they're not, they poll it to see if people want it, then they develop it. the work that goes into it beforehand is coming up with and fleshing out the design enough to poll it.

flip soul runes on the GE, they're low enough that even if you can't profit from selling them back on the GE, you can't lose money because you can sell them to ali morisane in al kharid for 150gp each.  
---
I typically buy them at 146-147 and sell at 149, so that's 120-180k a day for setting up a buy order. you can sell them to ali directly but it takes about 10 minutes to sell 60k runes to him so I just sell at 1 gp less to save myself all that clicking.  
---
I could say flipping on the GE in general but this is slightly different since there's zero risk of losing money.
---
when you say "herbs" do you literally mean only planting in herb patches or do you mean farming, because doing the neighbouring allotments for ultracompost is also a good money maker in addition since you're already there, plus saves you a bit of money from using your own ultra instead of buying it from the GE.  
---
6 watermelon seeds + 25 volcanic ash + 2 ultracompost to make sure you get 15 items to put into the compost bin makes 15 ultracompost in return, it's about 7-8k in input costs and 17-18k in output.  
---
bush patches, cactus patches and fruit trees are also passive money generators since they only need to be planted once and repeatedly harvested for free. bush patches you want janger or white berries they're both about 450gp each, cactus you want regular cactus rather than potato cactu and you want palm trees for your fruit trees.  
---
if you were willing to do varrock diary for battlestaves consider also doing kandarin medium/hard, medium increases catherby herb patch yield by 5% while hard increases it by 10% and the requirements for medium you probably have already.

I don't see the devalue argument as much as the making things easier one, because you'd still be dropping it anyway, but it def would speed up xp by a lot so. I get it.

As a broadband technician I never understood why internet streamers who stream to make a living don’t have a secondary isp, almost all businesses have a primary and redundant isp provider in case their primary goes down ( no matter how reliable their primary is. This is to prevent downtime in the case of outages and it is very unlikely that both will go down at the same time. Back to the relevant part if steamers do this as a career they should absolutely have a redundant isp especially when they are providing content that absolutely relies on no downtime.

Fucking hell is this community toxic.

I also think this would be a good option, and it would be very bad for barb fishing because of feathers being lost in a pile of fish. ;)

Would need a "lock" for some items or drop all of same item perhaps.

If you don’t get the joke just don’t comment. This whole thread of comments is about balance. This is a reference to a show where they attempted to create a morally neutral superhero by combining the DNA of Lincoln and Hitler. The aim being for a  “perfectly balanced” superhero.

Back in my day, like 3 years ago, you could enter in with 100 tokens, and just leave the room before the timer was up then reenter. So I got all defenders with 100 tokens

The pre elite version should be hot fixed. Random teleport destination instead of fixed to deter abusing it.

---
if you wanna be fuckin amazed, look up the account Crafter. my friend stumbled upon this unit doing low level slayer.
---
It's not stealing, man. Stealing implies some sort of dishonesty or law breaking.  The game *very clearly* let's you know that the area you're about to enter is pvp enabled and that **you will lose your items if you go in and get killed**.  It's the way the game works, dude. It's not theft. If you make the decision to enter a pvp zone, then that means you're accepting responsibility for the fact that you are risking what you're holding on you.
---
I did tithe for the last xp drops, couldn’t wait any longer so I got my last 350k xp at tithe. Pain full but worth it for the last xp drops

by luck meaning stable enough connection for the fight plus a bit of rng numbers for lower levels/gear.

Exactly! Seems like u can't even mention pvp in the discussion anymore without getting downvotes. Sad.

How come that when I post [a topic about Vorkath bank running](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/armjd9/fremennik_elite_diary_negatively_impacts_vorkath/), all I get is downvotes and people not even reading what I'm trying to say? Not a single argument as to why it shouldn't be the way it currently is. I sincerely think the diary perk mentioned in my topic should be changed to toggle-able. Are people in this subreddit just not reading actual suggestions (one that even fits the QoL feb month perfectly if you ask me) or is it all about the memes?
---
/u/Mod_West

I saw a chance for a joke. That is what would increase xp rates thiugh and make the game too easy. What a lot of people in rhe community like is the challenge of leveling. So when xp rates might increase older players get annoyed.

Hahaha

I did a project all of last semester on Venezuela and it’s some of the saddest shit I have ever seen.  I know it may “ ruin “ your game experience but the living conditions they face are terrible. I feel nothing but sympathy for the people of Venezuela, and the corruption they face.

Yeah I just meant right click drop all, like how you'd deposit them.

You don't know how.much time he has to play. If I lost my bank I would quit. And it's only 2m
---
&gt; Linux or Unix system  
---
Windows uses process IDs as well  
---
&gt; I bet this is the same PID as in RuneScape generated upon login
---
Why would it be? The player ID is determined server side it's not like a process is spun up when a player logs in.  
---
The game simply requires a way to address each player uniquely and to order them. A username **could** be used but integer comparisons are more efficient and convenient than string comparisons for this.  
---
When you log in you're assigned the lowest available PID, at least that's how it worked in Classic. When the server processes a tick it just goes through the list of active PIDs from lowest to highest and processes actions for each user.
---
Spoken like a true meta defining normie lol.
---
Next thing you know they'll add redwood trees
---
I get that you're trolling, but this topic really isn't about a time save or anything. It's about the fact the pre-elite run is BETTER then the elite run. This obviously shouldn't be the case.
---
This post is going to get deleted m8
---
I still need to get mine, ive been holding it off for so long because last time I died 3 times and then just gave up and now I'm thinking about doing it again. GG tho dude hopefully I join the ranks
---
That's what I thought worked, tried it a few times before researching and finding out it was patched.
---
Tell that to my firecape 
---
Is it that hard to print screen? 
---
That’s not very good is it - I’ll see what I can do :)

I think PID could’ve swapped the second he got hit for full HP.

Some people are actually fine with the vanila client, as long as its working.

:(

ooooooooo wahhhhhhhhhhhh

I always wondered how people get 99 farming first. What did you use from 85+? And congrats on 99 club :)
---
never be nice to people especially the wildy

Pm me brother
---
Nah, the Fremmenik quest line should unlock within players the ability to unlock one of three passive effects; one of which is called, “Berserker Endurance” which lets you drink beers from pubs to restore run energy and offer a short 10-15 second stamina burst. 
---
 
---
Another quest line or mini game called “Managers Delight” should make beers free from all pubs and there should be a right-click “get beer” option. 
---
The questline is essentially having to manage the disasters that occur across all the bars in Gielenor using something like a communication-orb to receive messages from the bar employees freaking out because another drunk werewolf is smashing glasses in one bar and in another bar a drunk wizard is levitating the tables and chairs to impress a woman.
---
Oh boy the good old "I hate being forced to go into the wild"
---
God. Damn. Take some responsibility for your own decisions for once maybe?? The game doesn't force you to do jack shit. Nothing about the wilderness is in any way META or forced. You choose to go there.
---
And no, your point that the majority of pkers don't even fight other pkers is just flat out wrong.
---
Nah ive atually gotten off quite a few times.  Do the laugh emote while she raspberrys and tell me thats not hot.

”I feel sick but I did it anyway”

These guys are pieces of shit, caring about a game more than someone starving haha.

it's just an overlay edit to hide my run energy to protect my account. though when i was younger i did used to think turning the run energy on and off like that could give me infinite run, i was sadly mistaken

maybe

just do math bro

isn't it "hhhhhhhhh"?

I have to use it on my laptop running Linux. Cause for whatever reason RuneLite just refuses to run.

if u die in f2p with p2p stuff, does it just drop to the ground and f2p players cant pick it up or cant even see it? could u go back and pick it up urself?

The worst kind of death.

Your point is an old one. It's already been suggested quite a few times. I'm not sure why you got some downvotes (it happens, timing and whatnot), but it's not that big of a deal that you lose one inventory slot.
---
I'd recommend suggesting it on the Weekly Q&amp;A thread for the mods to review.

How did you have mobile? Woah...

How many kills can I get a trip with addy darts n bp/dwh no elite void?

Why this triggers so many people is beyond my comprehension 
---
You may be depressed if you are allowing a game to run your life. I've been there. Try a new hobby, job or class. Meet people, make friends, even if you "don't" like them. Social validation goes a long way psychologically.
---
that would be 1/37 solo crates. it would take 37 crates of 27 rolls each before you're "dry". 
---
Yep. Unfortunately as it isn't tracked today, you'd only get the kc from the moment they updated onwards.
---
Also, they were mentioning they wanted to revamp the trawler as a whole to make it more engaging, so it was kinda put into the backlog for now.
---
9K upvotes, gilded several times. Now THAT'S an oof.

Making someone quit after pking and taking their bank is the ideal situation

Yeah I meant offense. Meh it doesn't matter because iirc it was polled and failed. Too many easyscapers

“This is not a dating site”

As I said you can get pedantic about the word forced all you like but claiming nothing in the game is forced doesn't really address the issue. You actually put the word in my mouth and now are using it as the sole basis of your argument lol
---
I'm confused... considering you already got to the lever, why didn't you just tele into KBD instead of trying to box your "friend"? Or did you get barraged right outside the lever?
---
Anything to support mah boy, his last video talked about a huge chunk of his videos getting claimed:/

He got them lamps

Nah I’ve never heard of a nazi

Ah fuck. Well, thanks for the advice; changed both my password and my pin
---
Your ds2 quest montage to paint it black is one of my favourite RuneScape YouTube videos. Keep up the great work.
---
7, that's pretty much every patch they could ask for.
---
Ok but think about the literal thousands of activities that *arent* right next to a fucking pub that would still make stams useful
---
Getting 1 KC at Zulrah, which is a completely safe death, is not an "elite" task at all
---
I was TBed
---
Damn, so they TBed you right as you got to the lever?
---
It's even worse than bronze lmao
---
I wouldn't mind it giving a percent-based run energy regen increase. It makes it better for lower levels and in f2p where they don't have agility at all. At low levels you can't afford stams/energies anyway and those are mobile items you can bring to places whereas a pub is a location you need to spend time in. Reducing the level 1 agility 7.5seconds to, say, 6 seconds, isn't that big of a deal considering you need to stand in a pub to do it. You'd get more done and be more efficient if you just walked while letting your run regen meanwhile. This is an idea that sounds good but is actually just a trap for lazy people that makes you inefficient while making you feel better about not having to walk. This is the opposite of easyscape RS3 shit.

As long as gay marriage is not allowed im cool with it

idk new mustang might be tempting

Wasn't group ironman confirmed for years?

Itt: everybody defending their boy client

Just look up my account: “Youthful”.
---
I just don’t like people who are new to the game wanting EZScape updates because they find some things too grindy. This is oldschool runescape, not RS3.

incase you didnt know this.. you can easily pay for membership with bonds. they can be bought for in game currency.

And here I thought “unrestricted worlds” were PvP everywhere worlds.... omg. 
---
Wrong sub, snowflake
---
If it has been suggested quite a few times as you say, doesn't that mean more people want this? Although I agree it's not that bad losing an inventory slot, it's more about the fact that a diary should be rewarding you instead of being a punishment. And thanks for recommending me to suggest it to the Weekly Q&amp;A. I'll try and do that if my timezone won't interfere.
---
Genius idea!
---
Too real
---
"Gay marriage for pkers" perfect!
---
Everything looks great, but the peaceful pendant looks SUPER powerful. 
---
Do you have rigour? Range level? Depends on a few things but 2-4 is standard.
---
password manager
---
You’re a normal account. You are ezscape lmao. Nobody is mentioning making it less grindy. This suggestion is shit but it is in no way making it any less grindy. If anything it’s making it even worse because nobody would go to a bar for run energy lol 
---
Rigour and 96 range 
---
If you’re super nerdy then you can use darkbow for last hiting blue phase. Since you’re using sang staff, let yourself intentionally get hit by an attack during long green phases with veng and heal back up. Usually this is enough to get you to 30+ kills consistently. If you cba then go vorkath and switch back once you get tbow.
---
I see
---
the other guy must've had a higher pid. pid is pretty much a list which the server reads from top to bottom to see who's actions goes first. because they both died within a game tick of each other, the server sees the deaths at the same time, then reads the list from top to bottom. because the other dude was higher on the pid list, the server stopped at him going "okay, you died, no need to check that other dude, he wins."
---
When someone executes near-perfect pvm it does make it look easy. Reality is timings are difficult though.
---
Example: Me. watch woox solo raids. Try solo raids. 3 hours later. 300 points.
---
How come ironmen are the most racist people in this game? Do you think it stems from their lack of friends irl?
---
It's Google Chrome Remote Desktop :)

I would genially play this

I can give you one if you want.

Almost spat my drink out reading that

That's the WoW lol

Keep trying. Took me 8 tries, and was completely worth it. Was tired or wearing a legends cape everywhere.

gf pking polls?

11m xp at 155k xp/h = 100 hours?

Wtf are those stats? I love weird accounts like this
---
Name checks out
---
It's cheeto dust not chocolate, and I understand how frustrating it is to see one part of a game you like constantly update but the parts you enjoy go untouched. There have been a few ideas tossed out that might fix it like people who have a certain number of kills in bounty hunter but the way that it is right now we're unfortunately not going to see any updates until pvp becomes more popular and gets more positive votes.
---
Opening them and doing the clues is quite good
---
went to G.E sold that peasant obby cape 700k now uw0t 
---
&gt;vote isnt going the way I want it to. Must be a broken system reeee
---
Lol better luck at the 1.2b xp point!
---
I lost 180m once because I was being a stupid whale at kbd, and I lost 250m once because I didn't bank my cerb setup before logging out. Still here.
---
Blackscape man btw
---
I have an actual suspicion that you are a total berk.
---
&gt;But I thought clue scroll killers were the topic we were on?
---
Since when? 
---
&gt;So you're saying you just don't like any pker who kills any pvmer in the wilderness? Or are you just trying to deter the argument to cause confusion?
---
Why are you supplanting me into this? I'm saying if you're player killing you have to accept that people won't always be happy with you for killing them. Like how is that even complicated? You're preying on them and doing something that objectively negatively affects them. You want a thank you card and a gift basket or what? 
---
&gt;I mean my combat level is 124 so I'd argue that I know the game pretty well.
---
One could say that it went over your head in your rush to a 99; simply use crafting to make cloth and mage to enchant it maybe use woodcutting to make splitbark and that kind of stuff.
---
I don't know why your focus is on ehp and leveling. Perhaps your real desire is a new stat to compete to mediocrity in?
---
You seem to care about it I guess? Maybe make a suggestion and if Jagex is nice enough they poll it.
---
Did it occur to you that it may not have been when it was first posted
---
Pid is unavoidable. If two actions occur at the same time there has to be some way to decide which gets processed first since a computer cannot compute both at the same time. Its not really an "advantage" so much as I have 2000 calculations, what order should I perform them in?
---
Dude, don't be a dick, RuneScape, old and new, is meant to have fun, not be overly competitive. Quit gatekeeping.
---
&gt;just 10 hours a day

You made all that duelling?

Karen please dont take the bandos set

What a wonderful idea for a problem the mods have been trying to find an answer to!

Nope, it disappears.

Try not to hurt someone with that stupid.

Why are you depicting Settled, our Lord and savior, as a brainlet?

You should be banned. BANNED I say!

Job, sleep, RS.

Well played

Pvm/pk/dueling and some flipping

People are at castle wars ever day sabotaging destroying barriers on their own team and theres no way to report them because they dont talk. cwars clans not only stack the teams (thats wahtever...) but then they get on alts and do this shit and you literally cant report it.

is that actually confirmed or just a meme?

Buying gold from a gold farmer.

They hate the yews.

I like OSRS but I also work to keep my other stuff in check, like social life, fitness, and studies. It’s not healthy to only do one thing, but as long as you take breaks you can stay motivated and healthy.
---
Or people just forget to bank. I accidentally tele'd to Lava maze with my full graceful and died. Frustrating but it happens. 
---
No, but it's proven that when people view results they're more easily swayed to join the leading count. 
---
Turns to alch price if im not mistaken, though I think stackable items just turn enough gold for 1x of the item instead of getting a big stack of cash.
---
So you're saying op is chad at making these memes
---
Smart idea, but it won't save you from a world DC.
---
Is it a bad idea to train melee mostly on controlled when using a whip? 
---
Dude, are you ever worried about being hacked? Have you ever had your account stolen?
---
I want to do the same you have done, but the stories of people having their account stolen with bank pin/2 step and recovery make me not wanna play for fear of losing it all in the end
---
Yes. You can +5 spicy stews, but it's tough to make it to all of them in time, so it take forever to get enough spices.  If you dont't have an immedite need, just keep going to 96 and use garden pies. 2 levels with fruit trees, calquats, and Snape grass won't cost much and will only take like 2 weeks.
---
Does anyone still play Castle Wars? I haven’t played in so long. I’d like to play a couple rounds just for fun. 
---
Thanks for the advice buddy 
---
Jesus. 
---
Eh, I have basically retired. I don't have much anymore, like maybe 15m?
---
Soon we'll have Roblox marriage, then every RuneScape couple will have to divorce, and that's to close to irl, which the reason I play games is as an escape.
---
You could use the tournament world to practice with no risk. Not sure how long they’re staying for but it’ll save you having to build a whole new account.
---
That, and the general store there buys stuff at high alch prices - lots of people (mainly ironmen) world hop there to sell stacks of stuff that wouldn’t make money elsewhere.
---
This is one of the oldest tricks in the book my man.
---
I love you
---
No he didn’t, do the quest again. You’re sent to him by one of the wizards at Wizard Tower to show him the talisman and he’s like “yo wtf is this bruh”

I love you both

Damn you got lucky there haha

Clan chat: osrs soa

Thanks Guthix I have good internet connection

The entire reason for old school RS is the wildy. 
---
When the wildy was removed the game died.
---
You don't think that's a legit reason?

Yes please this is so annoying
---
Yes, that's how 90% of players train construction
---
It's 50/50. This situation could have just as easily happened to sparc. The other guy doesn't deserve shit.

A few things

Rapier and avernic is better than bludgeon at cerb
---
Who tf uses bow at vork
---
Sang staff is also really effective at kq as well
---
Yeah it does
---
But tim didnt win, he died first....as seen in the clip
---
Shit I forgot my runescape character is married.
---
Alright man lol. Have a good day, maybe try and get laid so you’re not so tense and angry all the time 
---
You can 180k/hr+ with an alt and 1 ticking
---
Lmaooooo ultra fan found
---
It all really depends on you.. I had no problem getting to jad multiple times, but I always panicked. Keep calm and do one thing at a time. Pray switch, aggro a healer, pray switch, next healer etc. Also don't forget you can log out between waves to watch more of a guide, drops you right back where you left off

Sick account, gratz!

If you read through the original post warm loaf found the post and is trying to get in touch with him

My only tips would be to a) trap as much as possible on italy rock, never turn prot from mage off after 30, and dont be afraid to turn steel skin on if you need to run through a 180/tank a ranger.
---
It doesn't matter that his poison splat appeared first, What matters is when they died. If you actually watch the clip you see them both performing the death animation in the exact same tick. Because the other guy had pid all his actions that are performed on the same tick have priority. His death had priority, so he lost. 
---
btw im not attacking anyone its just a joke...BTW
---
Maybe make it so you have to buy a glass of beer to trigger the run energy restore over time effect as well? That way not everyone is just running into the bars and just standing in the door way the entire time. They could add a right click buy to all of the bartenders so we don't have to go through dialogue.
---
This is real fun to think about because as you said. In a lot of games, pubs and inns serve a legitimate purpose and aren't just background buildings.

General Reposti. Was on the front page today already

I saw him last night doing a farm run as well. I was pretty confused when I saw this.

Any tips on actually fighting jad I get to him no problem and then die I’ve got a lot of brews and restores left as of now 
---
He did? Great, I’ll delete this then

Bwuh!?

Minigames like throwing darts and arm wrestling. The option to buy drinks for other players. Maybe some ways to hit on the women/men. And bar fights with other players where you have to use hand to hand combat (but don't lose anything on death). Live bands that you can request songs from and even participate. You get "band points" if you play concerts with a certain group long enough. The higher your points the better you play and the more NPCs come to watch.

Lmfaoooo too meta

telling people to vote for something is not scummy that's how voting works. people voice their opinions to try and convince other people to vote for things.

---
Have been looking for a social clan to learn the bossing ropes and to have peeps to talk to about osrs. Hopefully will see you in game soon haha
---
you could always start playing in osrs 
---
You're grasping at straws now, please throw down some more cheap insults to prove my point about your pk efforts. Go read bud.
---
No, because the process of opening the jars and doing the clues is better gp/h than catching the implings its better to open the ones you catch, however the best option is to buy them and open them.
---
Can't do jack shit on the normal servers for weeks due to ddoses
---
Should be fine, just don't get overwhelmed when healers come out - one prayer swap at jad for one action like : Swap pray - drink pot - swap pray - target healer  etc
---
We look forward to seeing you! I'm quite sure we could be of help to you as we grow!
---
Came here just to comment that lmao. Good to see I'm not the only one that will antagonize the NPCs I'm killing when bored
---
Now all you have to do is clean your bank c: gz tho
---
boi that's advanced not giving a single fuck, every time i'm at revs i have my eyes glued to my screen
---
No DHCB on vorkath, lulwut?
---
I never really understood what exactly 100% accuracy meant. I've seen kq hit 0s before.
---
I upvoted purely for your ending. Well played.
---
Where the fuck is DHCB lmao
---
Lmfao, "box me" yeah, easiest way to make you skull. 
---
Haven't earned what? Is it fun to need 80 agility to not walk everywhere? And also the energy potions thing was a joke right? 40 run energy when you have 1 agility isn't even a minute of moving 
---
Why? What you just posted proves clue uniques are worthless in rs3 while they have value in osrs.
---
So hes a decent human because he wants to give the guys stuff back lol? So I guess the rest of us that actually PK in the wilderness, and keep our loot are terrible people? 
---
Its 1m exp for 23m gp lmfao
---
acktually wear a ring of wealth at gargoyles since it can auto pick up coins and they add up 200k ish per task towards the end

Only the realest remember CloudBrowsw

You forgot the point about how after divorce, one of the players, typically the male, owes the other a larger share of the joint bank account to help the other maintain their previous quality of gameplay.  In addition they owe the other player maintenance payments to make sure they can get back on their feet, leaving the male player without much money, and the female player with lots of it despite the fact that the female player most likely just danced at the GE while the male grinded money snake
---
What makes you say that?
---
No DHCB on vorkath, and no BGS or DWH for blowpipe... o-ohkay.
---
Nobody plays it, honestly. These days all anyone ever cares about is efficiency. It’s pretty sad. I’d like there to be a mini game overhaul to introduce some extremely useful rewards to dead mini games like C Wars.
---
I wouldn't, but someone would yeah.
---
Indeed two different things
---
Very nice people in this clan, loving it! totally recomending it for new people! all of our members in our clan chat are friendly, and always will help if you have any problems!
---
shut the fuck up serene
---
I only do revs on a weekday morning when time permits. 10am uk time on a 1750 world is the best I can do atm
---
How is that? Any mask in osrs is a couple k while they are 300-400k in rs3, addy g is also what 10k in osrs? 300k for the plate body alone in rs3
---
honestly, isn't a bad idea 
---
If you use auto retaliate in the tunnels it fucks up your pathing. Thanks for the downvote btw.
---
Ah rip. I'm always at work at that time. 
---
Cancel all other projects, focus purely on this.
---
when a monster rolls a hit it rolls from 0 to max hit. an attack can 'hit' and then roll a 0.
---
I can't get it to work for RuneScape. I think games are too resource intensive. 
---
Team verf and settled
---
For my own sanity I am choosing to believe it is.
---
imagine being on here so much you can tell every little repost LOL. New to me and I found it funny and thats more important than some nerd caring hes seeing it again :)
---
You're thinking of wow when you ding your health heals up. You know what's funny is I always had this memory of smelting bars leveling up your mining in RS. Turns out that was in wow and my mind just confused it
---
Probably a mixture between Reddit and RS.
---
Best of luck to you, FreshBread 🙏🏽
---
Cause they rake in cash on monthly subscriptions.  If they can't support server costs if the player base dwindles then an offline copy could be a good way for them to cash out.
---
You just learned that today?
---
Good to know i'm not the only returning player who never got a FC. Currently grinding ranged to 75, and defense to 70 before I give it a go.

Playing rs3? Sounds like gay marriage to me
---
I have this thought at barrows alot. But lately i was thinking it could help at shamans too, for when they jump attack and land on top of the other shaman. Full support
---
Imagine not being able to come up with original posts and copying others. Also imagine being so irked by my comment that you feel the need to reply instead of just enjoying the imagine. God damn I feel like John Lennon with all this imagining 
---
accuracy roll decides if you hit and if you hit, your hit will deal a random amount of dmg from zero to your maxhit with all hits having an equal chance of getting chosen.
---
I feel the added osrs lore has a more sarcastic approach, not taking the game too seriously. Which I love.
---
Rs3 well, before eoc lore was amusing to read. After eoc they went hardcore on the lore and sure it added links to things, but there's too many holes for the lore to be followed. 
---
Just out of curiosity, can anyone explain the downward trend of seed and herb prices? Specifically ranarr, snap, and torstol?
---
I know, but I think he is trying to say that kills like this actually happen when you legitimetly pk

imagine seeing this exact image with the exact same title trending 2 days ago, nerd.

It already disappears though?

It's not even a repost as far as i am aware. These types of posts appear all the time, so it's possible thar it's similar to another one. And you also make a very good point, Kurai :)
---
I'd actually fucking love this so much.
---
But a politician (in the public eye) gives reasons to vote a certain way. Sparcmac is just using his influence to shape the game illegitimately. Yes the fault lies in both groups the influence-er and the influence-y. Maybe you don't view it as a shitty/scummy thing to do, but I do. Although I didn't see anything about him promising giveaways at certain percentage. If this is true would someone post the VOD? Because that is actually beyond reprehensible.
---
Strykewyrms already exist in RS3.
---
You dont do bandos enough then, or have never seen a team who knew what they were doing. 
---
Its bis. Even 85 range with addy darts is better dps than max melee. 
---
I think it would be better if it matched the black on the white graceful
---
I still don't get the top right one. Can someone explain?
---
Imagine
---
Didn't downvote you buddy, I was just wondering why you shouldn't use auto-retaliate when doing barrows. I use auto-retaliate for barrows all the time and I've never experienced any pathing issues.
---
That's not what disruptive behavior is lmao. What do you think jagex is going to do? Ban him because you're crying on Reddit?
---
What color graceful is this?
---
But we can't be prejudiced against PKers!
---
ok "buddy"
---
Weird. For a community thats so afraid of "ezscape" thats a lot of people using a helptool making the game easier.
---
I didnt make the post tho???
---
The twisted bow does work at vorkath, it isn’t efficient by any means. Similar to Corp, the tbow can be used, just not the best to get kills.
---
Make pubs also a place to brew! That's way you can expect to find some players there for Skilling instead of just quickly resting and leaving
---
Thats not how wealth inequality in the US works.  People aren't getting worse off, there just isn't any wealth growth among 95% of the population, while there is a very significant growth in wealth among that top 5%.

oops, edited thanks
---
If I remember correctly you regen 1 hp when you level. So if you're hp is currently 15/20 and you level to 21 it would be 16/21
---
Thank you for your service to our great game and contributing to other being able to use in game gold to buy those bonds you purchased with real money for their own in game time.
---
Personally I love the bond system for this. Jagex is a middle man for essentially trading gold for game time.

Whether or not this is a troll thought it deserved some input lol.

It would make it more difficult for bots to deal with and slow exp rates

He’s talking about how poisonous things have to be ingested for them to work, while venomous things can be injected into you. Like how a snake is venomous but a mushroom is poisonous.

the game is already balanced for solo play though. Unless you mean you want an easy mode since you play casually

ok most likely going to sell bank for it lol thanks to you that shared opinions, i appreciate it!
---
I’ve used the twisted bow in combination with the blowpipe. I’d shoot zulrah 5 times with the blowpipe and for the last hit switch to the twisted bow before switching to mage gear. Sometimes I’ll get a nice 50 hit in transition :)
---
I've met some nice people at the wilderness altar just training prayer. I'd still be careful about trusting them though.
---
This I'd why u put ur computer next to ur wifi thingy 
---
Did you not insure it?
---
Good idea actually. 
---
You're so cool. You deserve a trophy. We should hold a ceremony for you as the king of OSRS because you've been playing for SIX YEARS. Jagex should make an NPC in honor of you. Bow before YouthfulRS because he has been playing OSRS longer than you have been born. YouthfulRS is the only one who deserves to make suggestions because YouthfulRS has been playing the longest. Everyone should envy you, and shield their eyes from your greatness. 
---
He was demoted now he's the Private First Class Beast.

Hah-hah

LMAO This line was the sole reason I came to the comment section 
---
Ah okay so it's kind of like slashing with mage, except there's not actually a way to differentiate it in game
---
I use thee normal whip on all,  or rune c bow 
---
You’re asking for trouble if you didn’t insure it.
---
For me, it's actually the opposite. When I am doing well and achieving my goals in life, OSRS tends to fall to the side. However, when I am struggling with life and don't feel like I'm going anywhere, I tend to spend a lot more time playing OSRS.
---
I think it's due to the sense of achelievement and control you have in the game. If you want to beat a boss, you know the steps to do that - whether it's grinding combat stats, finishing quests or practice, all are achievable with time and commitment, and whatsmore, there are no surprises that impede progress (e.g. a uni group member bailing or equipment breaking down at work). It's a guaranteed way of obtaining a sense of achievement and a feeling of control on your life.
---
These feelings are typically missing when I'm struggling in life, and are typically abundant when I am succeeding - hence why OSRS comes and goes. 
---
A max player in rs3 using a whip would be like a max player using a rune scim in osrs. Its shit tier next to their t90s-t92s
---
it’s so easy with a blow pipe, like you’ll have plenty of supplies when you get to jad so if you don’t panic your prayers you’ll be good
---
Get owned kiddo dumb pvmers btfod again

Higher range for sure. My pure is sitting at 50 att, 75 str, 1 def, 85 range, 43 prayer, and 85 mage. Combat level 64.

This is not a dating site!

Aww crybaby

Yeah good point

You're not saying why it's scummy though. You're just saying what is scummy except this time with more words. Yes sparc Mac is using his audience to push votes. We have already established that you think this is scummy. I still do not understand why you find this scummy

He’s bribing viewers to vote how he wants by promising a giveaway on his channel at certain % votes and when the poll is over.
---
So yes. He is literally offering players something in exchange for their votes.
---
But even aside that, if that weren’t true, do you not understand how someone could vote in ‘bad faith’, picking their votes solely based on what their favorite YouTuber has told them is good? And you don’t think that’s a problem?
---
If everyone truly voted for what *they themselves* wanted, it would be fine. But when someone has no real opinion on a topic but chooses to vote to ‘buff X item because Y streamer has a ton of them banked and would be really excited if it passed’, that’s an issue. It’s a subversion of the democratic system, and it’s bullshit.

4 downvotes I said the same thing as you guys loooooool

I wonder if they can allow you to build a wall with limestone bricks or planks

Gratz man. I'm really putting it off. But if you did it with red dhide and strawberries I can do it with black dhide and bp..
---
You bought your account and are now pissed that the OO recovered it.
---
Jagex should just buy runelite
---
Would make it possible to reverse-engineer the source code for all of the present game mechanics, which would allow Private Servers to *truly* be superior to the real-deal, especially considering LAN play.
---
They'd have to be insane to take that risk.
---
Splashing isn't a big deal imo. Trading decent XP rates for AFK is a fine compromise.

Runecrafting slow, but profitable

Agility sucks all around

Time to 3 tick fish for 200 hours again!

Is the lance any good at KBD? I’ve never even heard of KBD with a twisted bow tbh lol. Maybe ever since the super anti fire potions?
---
How does this game mode work? It looks really interesting! I’ve only ever heard of God Wars, never heard of this minigame 
---
He deserved it. He brought his bank and untradables to deep wildy
---
Inject that shit right in my veins. I can't get enough restricted ironman content.
---
depends if you prioritise a bit more xp or a bit more afkability i guess
---
What if I told you, every other week you had to do slayer or raids or vork or GWD with 176ping.
---
The game was dying like 7 years ago with eoc stuff but after OSRS was released it started growing and the recent release of mobile made it grow even more. Definitely going upwards for the time being.
---
tl:dr it was changed that way in 2015 due to the ddosing and dcs. both are still a problem in todays game and the majority of osrs players now started after these changes so they are used to it.
---
my wallets
---
If you basing it off experience skills in the low 90s are mid level....
---
95 and I get less than half the nests I did before the nerf when I had around 80 hunter 
---
If you have the username “Karen” you get to keep all the boss pets
---
It has been this way almost since OSRS release. It was overly punishing and gave people incentive to DDOS the servers/individuals which was bad.
---
It's so worth it. I had to do this too, but once I got it set up I could have my settings on any pc I got on

Damn, I really don't get how it's broken. I'm not seeing it at all, haha. It seems to me to be moderately good at everything. Only situations where I could see it being useful over other offhands are when you're frequently switching between melee/mage/range (DKs, raids situationally, PKing, etc.), and where defense isn't an issue (otherwise I'd choose BSS over this any day of the week). I'm not trying to be blindly defensive or whatever, I just...really don't get it. Can you ELI5 what makes it broken, exactly? (I'm late enough in the game where I don't even use prayer books except for burst tasks, so I thought this could free up some bank space and unlock some dead content (three god books that never get used). I probably wouldn't even use it myself except for tribridding, and a high repair cost (a la fire cape and other untradeables) for death in the wildy could balance that. It seems decent and fair for a ~5m item to me.)
---
Well, exposing yourself like that is kind of, like.
---
Asking for it?
---
Dunno. Maybe you should stick with the muted chat. 
---
THIS IS SO CUTEEEEEE
---
&gt; It can have that effect by default for all that matters.
---
By that logic, it should also give the slayer task effect by default.
---
I know it’s a joke but I want it now
---
Wait, is group ironman actually coming out? I just made an ironman yesterday, should I stop if i wanna do group?
---
I don't have any darts, because I smithed everything into platebodies for cash, and I won't imbue MSB, both of the reasons because HCIM. That leaves me with RCB + Broads, and I think that's decent enough. So I'll probably buy 10k bolts and see how much xp I get from that, and then multiply. Thanks anyways!
---
Well judging by the fact that he streamed a new hc today I’d say he is
---
Yeah i am crazy lucky lol
---
Not sure about the new subtab; it seems to overlap a tad with the Account Management Tab we recently got. But perhaps we could have a "Summary Tab" as the first tab to give some totals, but maybe not time played and some of the other information found elsewhere?
---
can't be so bad right? the worst case scenario is people breaking into zoos to eat the animals, sounds like breadline paradise

sounds cool, maybe the pubs could along with serving beer they serve special drinks which are otherwise like run potions,

Right right I see

Is the bottomless compost bucket fixed so you get double compost from the bin or do you still need to fill buckets then add them to the bottomless bucket?

*MM btw.*

Look there isn't any point bickering with you anymore, see ya round

Sounds like you use your rs email for other things, which gets collected and sold to basically whoever wants to buy the mass email lists. These ppl are sending out mass phishing emails to these email lists and hoping some take the bait.

Change the email tbh.

Also https://haveibeenpwned.com/ is a thing.

Extended antifire potions do resist the fire attack. Not sure about normal antifire

I don't think he's a brain let or anything. I just think he should be held a bit more accountable for his decisions than some people here seem to think he should
---
It isn't useable at any boss, prayer is the limiting factor on every boss In this game. As for pking it will be just free smites in multi and in singles no one will fight divine prods just like in rs2. Idc if it passes or not because realistically it won't affect the game. It will just be a cool shield to look at but not great anywhere.
---
It’s a pvp minigame, capture enemies flag and protect your own
---
you know how to fix it? 
---
yeah you can move everything around if you want which gives your own feel
---
The only way this wouldn’t be super OP is if it was tradeable. 
---
😕 I thought ya'll liked jokes about rs3.
---
it's been like 3 days but feels like a week, hope they fix it soon. Facking proximus idd! 
---
Jog on 
---
It won’t ever rise up again
---
I was thinking of creating a new email just for my rs account, the one I am using now I use practically for everything.
---
Report in game. Not here. 
---
I feel the account management tab is more for - as the name suggests - managing your account. Membership status, bond purchasing, customer support, etc. This was meant more as a game information window &amp; a means of getting a single image overview of some core statistics &amp; progression-centric data that’s available in multiple places in game. As well as trying to give the collection log a slightly easier to find home. 
---
Obviously what goes in such a hypothetical tab (and the best name for the tab) is up for debate. A lot more could be added (or omitted), I mostly just included the basics that people often want to see &amp; share when talking about account-wide progression. 
---
you can probably have someone video them scrolling through their music tracks to see which areas they unlocked
---

once ironmen drop them they are gone forever, if a normal account decides to get rid off them they will incur no cost if they decide to get them back for the collection other than ge fluctuations which would be very small, he was referring to how the finality of the process of getting them is on ironmen

It depends on how you define effective. Max mage with range switch on Zulrah nets faster kills and more kills/hr. Tbow only is much easier and better gp/hr due to supplies.
---
That is not true, for solos in certain bosses it will make your trips last longer then compared to the elly. "Free smites" never happens unless you are incredibly lucky or have a good team to lure someone. It won't affect the game? That is ignorant and it shows why polls like this shouldn't be added to the game when people just want a cool shield to look at when they can't even understand how it will affect the game.

If thats the case then they should just make it so you dont lose items at all when you die, period. 
---
I didnt know it had been implemented in the game for that long though, I thought it was more recent than that (in 2017 I thought). 
---
If your items just despawn after an hour and dont show up to anyone else, then why wouldn't they just make it so you dont even drop items. Technically your internet could be down for a long period of time depending on the attack/how savvy you are dealing with that.

BP with dragon darts is actually better DPS than scythe. BP with rune is slightly less than scythe but still better to use because you take less damage

okay so my only option is get the arceus book or keep ancient in my poh and tele to lunar altar since i have lunar isle tp in my house

How long till he dies on that one and starts his 11th Ironman series?

i like the idea of the gloves cooling you off, makes sense, maybe ice arrows when equipped help as well
---
Hey thanks man!
---
No. 
---
Building each altar require a 'signet' which can only be obtained if you have the requirements to use the spell book. 
---
And the occult altar requires all signets. 
---
It's shouldn't be a big deal to unlock the Arceuus spell book. It takes about half an hour with the Runlite/OS Buddy plugin.

Dcs happened way more back in the day IMO vs now. Knock on wood but since I started playing i can not think of a time where i ever dced, I use RL (only played for few months though). 
---
Point being though is that theres no incentive to staying alive anymore, or making sure you are qualified to kill a boss. If they changed it due to ddos attacks and dcs they should make it so you just dont lose items on pvm death. Your items will never show up to other players, but im sure there can be cases where said players internet is down for an extended period of time depending on what happened.

Currently to get the same bonuses you'd need to equip 6 different items at once. What you are suggesting would be the best hybrid item in the game, by far. It has no negative stats, and very reasonable stats in every single category, as well as a prayer bonus. Right now people use spirit shields as a hybrid off hand because they don't have negative bonuses, except only the arcane has any offensive bonhs and it costs over 100m
---
Theres a method discovered by woox which is actually comparable to lava runecrafting from what I remember.
---
It involves using imp boxes to collect and bank the various books before turning them all in at once for runecrafting xp, accoring to his video it maxes out at 70k xp/h at level 99.
---
Free smites in multi is true, they can just ancient mace you like they already do. Also even if they don't ancient mace if a team specs you for 99 health it would drain 40 prayer instantly with divine which is over 1/3rd your prayer points, so really it would only take a few maces. As for soloing bosses easier, name one where damage taken is the limiting factor. If you flick bandos properly damage isn't an issue. Armadyl is a prayer limited boss, same with zammy, and sara. Corp you spec to nothing for solos, hydra u can avoid 100% damage. People kill 50+ cerbs a trip. U use tbow for zuk so even acb+divine would be worse. Raids u look for damage as priority. The only current uses for Ely are inferno,sara,and tanking gwd bosses and that's because it doesn't effect prayer.

Only because leveling is weird. If you have base 90 stats you have access to nearly all high level end game content.

For some reason my account had recurring payment, even though I thought I turned it off. I was disappointed.
---
And your point is? The potions have a recurring cost attached to them because they're finite. As long as you can keep buying them you can keep using them. That cost never goes away.
---
Pools have a high, one time cost to them in exchange for infinite uses. They also have a skill requirement. The downside is, you can't take it with you and you have to travel to it every time you want to use it. Those are all necessary setbacks for such a powerful feature.
---
Pubs would have no cost, would have no skill requirement, and all you'd have to do is to teleport to a place with a nearby pub. Even fresh off of tutorial island you can home teleport every 30 minutes to Lumbridge for absolutely free which now has a new pub. 
---
Almost forgot to mention the explorers ring, which can restore 50% of your run energy a limited number of times a day. We do not have a run energy problem, and being a low leveled player who can't afford energy potions does not mean the game has a problem. 
---
An argument I can partially get behind is for ironmen. At the end of the day, though, they chose the extra challenge.
---
I feel like you guys read the shitty title and thought I meant it has additive bonuses, and didn't click on the first image. My fault for not being clear; I'll try again with a clearer title in the future. Unless you're saying roughly +8 offensive/defensive stats, +2 str, and +6 prayer is super OP. In which case I don't get it. Compare to a much better defensive item with no downsides (Blessed spirit shield (or any spirit shields)), much better melee offensive item (most defenders), or much better ranged/mage offensive items (mage's book, wards, bucklers, visage shields, etc.). Right? Except this has more Prayer bonus, which isn't exactly game-changing.

yes but doing giveaways for votes off twitch is another matter should do something about that

Or if you're deadset on not doing favour, you can just build another altar in your house. I'd recommend doing arceus favour though

Ezscape much?

that other guy is like *I'm next*

Oops. At work speed reading

It felt even way better when your combat was high enough that it didn't attack you anymore

yeah im gonna do it eventually

just too lazy atm lmao

That's me

Very hard to do and takes much focus. My pixel hat is off to your good sir.

Arceus spell boom is crazy easy to get. Definitely should just knock that out then get the altar. Altar is a game changer
---
What are the ideal stats for an obby pure? 
---
From what I understand they plan on making it eventually. It requires some engine work and the engine team is working on making Mobile better and/or working on RS3 Mobile
---
I was actually pretty impressed, this question has something like 12% skip rate. It does seem ironic that all of the shills who complain about unhidden poll results all of a sudden wish to abuse the system
---
Agreed original death mechanics were better, at least let some npc at lumbridge it something collect your items after you died( like at zulrah but this would happen everywhere) and you have to pay like 5-10% value of whatever you lost to get it back. Even at zulrah/Vorkath you just pay 100k to get back possibly 100m worth of gear it’s pretty stupid. And yes why even after the hour runs out the items just disappear? Makes no sense, if after an hour the guy didn’t come back up at least let it become visible for other people to loot it. 
---
I'm in Cs. Basically no matter how fast the computer is some things cannot happen at the same time. One of the things that likely happened was the gametick checked for deaths as a more important action, and since he died later in the tick, he passed the death check until both were processed on the same tick. 
---
Leading to a situation where this could happen, and pid would allow them to give the death to the guy with pid. 
---
Some of the options seem filler just for the sake of filler, but the interface would be simpler, with icons that are in a consistent place. I mean, huge improvement for that alone.
---
Nah man 
---
Gargoyles for sure dude. Also, get barrows gloves while youre at it. Makes pvm so much better. Make sure to grab all your untradeables too, torso/f cape/b gloves/ d def. Your combats are more than high enough. And you dont need to do much skilling for b gloves either. 
---
Camp gargoyles for a while though, get yourself 70 pray when you can and then get those untradeables. Then either go back to gargoyles to get a decent cash pile OR do konar slayer tasks. Konar is great for mid tier slayer - gives incentive to do tasks that normally drop no loot. Also DO YOUR CLUES! :)
---
whats that?

Oh yeah. I never heard of that. That's some fraud shit
---
Not an insult
---
I haven't played since the first year OSRS came out, but I still read this sub and watch some vids
---
I think it’s just pure PVP it would be OP for. 
---
Having offensive stats and strength bonus is actually pretty game changing in terms of an offhand for pures. There hasn’t been a new BiS that I can remember apart from the new books but it’s balanced because you can only choose 1/6. 
---
When those are combined it makes it pretty OP imo but would be suitable if it couldn’t be used in PVP unless it was dropped on death. 
---
Yes, absolutely--but any of those six items you have in mind have *way* better stats for what they do, and typically in RS, you're only doing one thing at a time. If I was ranging, any of the top 5 ranging shields could do it better, right? I agree that it'd be one of the best hybrid items in the game, but how often are you really hybridding? And even when you are--again, I think the +40-60 defenses from the BSS, for instance, outweigh the ~+8 offenses from this item, in the overwhelming majority of situations. I think it would be a sick item for sure, and an option worth considering while hybridding, but OP? Broken? I just don't see it.
---
This is getting some traction, come on Jagex!

Catherby lobster fishing by far.  I wish it was like it used to be, tons of people just telling chuck Norris jokes

the wiki found me an interesting choice by buying cadantine blood potions and wines i could make bastion potions at about 350k xp an hour for about 6 gp/xp

i think he makes more in a day than u make in half ur lifetime, think hes gunna be alright
---
Just never happened to me yet. I don't die :)
---
Unless drop rates or game mechanics change it will only continue to fall
---
Gold sink I imagine for that last part. Tbh if you have a whole hour to run back then just make it so you dont lose items at all. Or i like your idea of havin to pay someone to get the loot back. Maybe a flat value though. 
---
I just think there should be incentive to actually staying alive, learning mechanics before bringing your best most expensive gear to a boss/pvm in general. 
---
scumbag sellout paying for votes

god i wish that were me

im not. i just signed off the game and went outside lol

Fuckin amazing.

iirc, that lowest combat record for Jad is like 27 or something.

Wouldn’t it only be double dry since you can only get the pet after the elite dairy which requires 1k plucked?

“If you have more than 1 cape, all capes in your bank will have the same effect”

Love your videos and streams. Such good content.
---
I could certainly see the Raiding Party tab expanding. It'd be useful in BA, especially, that interface is such a pain in the ass. 
---
If the PARTY tab gave a cross-chat feature, it'd be useful in every minigame in RS.
---
With your stats I recommend either farming gargoyles like mentioned previously? Or even with your rc level your almost into the moneymaking portion of it, but making money that way is boring af. Honestly you just can't go wrong with slayer unless you plan to burst every task you'll always come out on top
---
I agree. This would mostly be game-changing for PvP, and *especially* for pures. But, for instance, using the hidden requirements for GWD could help. Or we could give it a 40+ defense requirement. Definitely would need to have penalties/risk for using it in the wildy, like the repair fees for other untradeables. Could also simply make it cost 1m+ to reobtain from the Sage. It couldn't abide by the same rules as the individual God books, in terms of "oh I died with it, oh well it's free and no risk," for sure.
---
It just seems a bit out of place to have another Account tab alongside quests and such when we have an Account tab that is underdeveloped. It may be better to not add a 6th subtab for general information to make sure there is room for more in the future and we don't need to redesign it again. 
---
But aside from questioning adding a new tab and what is on it, the design is nice.
---
Yeah I’m not too concerned honestly it’s a game, I’m  just disappointed this kind of thing still happens 
---
Good idea but maybe for a completely different new weapon. Instead of changing existing content.
---
People do still pk in non-pk worlds. There's hotspots in the wild such as hill giants was a hot spot in 2006. Most notable locations where people pk at is the gate of kbd layer(solo) and the revenants cave(clans).
