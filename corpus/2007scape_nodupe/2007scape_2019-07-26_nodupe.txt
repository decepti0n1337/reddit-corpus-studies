The majority of players never agreed to the introduction of discontinued items. I hope this is not legit.
---
We all know it's mod ree
---
likely because you don't hear them repeatedly for a good portion of your existence, or because you don't see the double standard that commonly occurs when they're flipped around, or simply because you're not affected by the ones that are commonly posted.
---
Fair enough, I thought you were just nit-picking which really undermines the hard work everyone has put into this wonderful update.
---
You're just making yourself look worse dude. I'd stop check out the downvotes on your comments
---
Good question, the way I see it they're either too stupid to realize or they're too proud and disrespectful to care.
---
Wow these new HD character models look great
---
Ditterbitter made a good tribrid guide, checkout his youtube channel. Then get your ass kicked for many hours and you'll improve over time.
---
The level of woosh this guy just experienced is very satisfying. I find a lot of people who try to woosh people, get wooshed lol.
---
Models is the term, in this case chathead models.
---
Definitely look like night elves. I think it‚Äôs pretty neat!
---
def tanks r the best bet, but they take forever to train
---
What comments lol? If I cared about downvotes I‚Äôd be out here farming for karma like you.
---
Thanks for the laugh
---
Ohhh so when you take a teleport it puts you on the ceiling not the "top floor?" Very cool
---
Even if it doesn't respawn regularly, it's almost a given that it'd reset/respawn on a server reboot. Unless they manually remove the NPC from the game next week.
---
Finally someone made this into a meme! 
---

---
That dwarf has given me so many mini heart attacks and broken my eardrums couple of times. I use Sound Effects to signal when my invy is full and when a pker attacks me. I fish crabs, nothing else
---
rare doesn't mean discontinued
---
What does the grail do?
---
yes
---
Not sure but I'm pretty sure I saw pics somewhere of her streaming on twitch? Like a design stream? Maybe it was Q&amp;A, idk. But yeh if you care that much, definitely give your feedback
---
That was an actual thing pre eoc on RS3, they changed the high alch values for nats p quickly.
---
I think they look good tbh. Only Elena is fucked
---
no one knows it was added today
---
Thats just idiots panicing thinking its rare item. And merchers are happy.
---
:O
---
why should someone have less say over the direction of their government just because they live in a city?
---
I can‚Äôt see anything past that horrible graceful coloring
---
learn what a gp sink is
---
Very strongly against. They polled making various things easier, and were met with an emphatic "no".
---
it was added today, if you wiki dragonstone armour the set comes up but nothing else.
---
learn to read the update notes
---
Hail slaanesh
---
Sometimes we forget to put in the /s don‚Äôt worry about it chip
---
they definitely did not skip shoulder day
---
I didn't know I was colour blind until those colour blind memes came around a while back and I unironically couldn't read one of the real colour blindness 'tests'. So thanks internet... I guess.
---
Yea, wasting XP. Befor BU I played a little, but now I can‚Äôt as I feel that I need to get my shit together instead of grinding xp. Although I would love if osrs was fun to me now.
---
it didnt cross my mind to check that. thank you for being so kind and helpful though.
---
Doric's I believe! Spotted another one in MEP1 today as well with the bear fur and silk.
---
80 Hunter or 90 for bare-handed.
---
It hides that youre online! Doesn't work for seeing somebody in-world, though.
---
They should make it sparkle like magic logs. That'd be sick, and seems appropriate for a 250m item
---
once a year LMAO
---
How many fanatic kills do you have?
---
I appreciate the post, but I can't read any of the numbers lol
---
Knowing when an account is created is one of the things that can help when recovering an account.

Zalcano is fem-demon. So its not gay if U have boobie and a pp

Got my first 99 ever a few weeks ago (ranged) after starting the game way back in 2006 and picking old school up around 2017. I was in the exact boat as you, I always wanted a 99 as a kid but never came close. As I got this 99 it was literally a childhood dream coming true, it was amazing! Congrats on yours as well my friend!
---
Apparently they migrated after some undead queen decided to burn their tree down.

---
Just tell me where it is so I can go pick it up for you bro
---
Ok have fun buddy
---
*Jagex changes tiny minimal thing that doesn't affect gameplay or game feel in anyway*
---
community: you fucking ruined the game
---
Add vengeance and ur good to go
---
I heard of one selling for 500m
---
Gz!
---
Requirements for the guantlet?
---
Dude for real. "Lost motivation" like what?
---
No one cares about anyone elses username. I've always just hit random in mmos and other video games.
---
What exactly?, if you mean the weapon and shield being reverted into seeds the blog told us that already, just go to Iilfeen to get back your weapon/shield at the charge it had.
---
Can u get me some bonds so I can start playing again ?
---
oh i didnt know, tyvm
---
Excellent work Jagex, I loved the quest and the final boss was really well done especially with the atmosphere. Now I can wear my quest cape again. The new areas are really detailed and feel like the belong in our universe.
---
like the electoral college did that three years ago?
---
Is the rabbit actually gone?
---
Congratulations!
---
i like the new models except Iorworth's pale purple skin. The faces tho...need lots of work
---
Is it like a playtesters list or something? I don't understand the significance.
---
it's like the 6th time this has popped up
---
This better not be true wtf
---
I feel like the memes actually are the way the community expresses their appreciation for everything Ash does. 
---
He really shouldn't feel like focus isn't on his marvelous dev work.
---
Roller coaster tycoon 2 graphics look amazing still because they are so basic.
---
Roller coaster tycoon 3 graphics... Yiggity yiggity yikes.
---
Big tiddy kind?
---
I would 100% make a non refundable mounted twisted bow if it was a thing.
---
search this sub for "zulrah bot"
---
Yeah, he's the our darling because he loves working on the game as much, if not more than we love to play it
---
I think the regular gauntlet is actually really fun because even with the worst rng you can still get a completion. But still the loot is really bad.
---
I see it as the best piece of content I‚Äôll never play after this week
---
4k RC exp
---
33k Mining exp
---
9k Smithing exp
---
Across around 4hrs perhaps? kills are around or under 2mins
---
Q
---
you‚Äôre kidding, right? Wouldn‚Äôt that have to be a hell of a lot of people bonding their alts for it to make a difference?
---
Lol don‚Äôt you know it‚Äôs not ok to have a different opinion on this sub? What‚Äôs wrong with you man??
---
No wait, make it green
---
[Umm wat](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/chv3y0/the_holy_grail_is_osrss_first_discontinued_rare/)
---
How many in your group??
---
Are the shields and bows still tradeable after you trade your seeds back in for them? I don't see bows or shields in the ge anymore.
---
4-5 hours ish
---
Somewhat off topic; it‚Äôs so uncanny seeing him called out here since I actually know him personally from outside OSRS!  More on topic though, thank you and all other admins and contributors for the great wiki work!  I try to contribute here and there but without you all the wiki- and quite possibly the game- wouldn‚Äôt be as great as it is!
---
&gt;So warding? 
---
Yeah, thats what I'm saying. 
---
&gt;&gt;If we're going to impliment everything that people voted no on, then make it interesting, don't just make it the exact same content as before but "better".
---
&gt;
---
&gt;The interesting part is you can now create mage armor.
---
Okay, people are happy to downvote based on presumptions and perhaps I should have been more thoughtful to explain what I'm trying to say.
---
How is adding the *same* skilling method a good idea? People already don't like doing abyss runs. How is adding more content to them make the game better?
---
I get that people want mage armor, sure fine. But lets be real, most of the gear will be forgotten or unused. How much of the gear in game right now is completely useless except in fringe cases?
---
Why not try to push dev time into coming up with new ways to do runecrafting (sure making new gear) instead of the same boring way we currently have to level it?
---
did it in the 2200 world varied from 30 to 10
---
Looks like you got luckier than your friend gz!
---
Well Elves were always known for doing "CRYSTAL" meth
---
So it's literally just vork but you get Slayer xp? I guess that's technically better than doing it off task ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I thought the numbers multiplied when I first did it lol
---
varied alot, fastest i checked was 1min 30s
---
Egg
---
Watch five minute cutscenes about dwarven mercantile policy and THE RED AXE
---
The hits are otherwise pretty low, maybe you could keep your health on the lower end and tick eat that attack to be able to stay alive long enough to kill the boss. Otherwise I would try to get some brews
---
No, i‚Äôm not kidding. That poll had the biggest turnout yet as far as i know, and i‚Äôve seen lots of people admit to doing it.
---
Yes, it was a lot of people bonding a lot but it was mostly players with high-level mains and very big banks so they certainly had the ability to do it
---
What are you doing with dis information :o
---
Man, I'd say it's surprising that this sub is downvoting you for giving an actual answer, but it isn't lol
---
barrows was harder to get to back then but it wasn't more difficult to do, and it was far more consistent money, because of how ridiculously high the drops were back then.
---
Wait what happened? What‚Äôs I miss now?
---
D
---
Top tier meme
---
Click bait. It‚Äôs only during the quest to prevent players purposely falling down as a shortcut
---
Ahhh! 
---
Never mind, I like the new model actually.
---
Hi mommies! What's your name? What's your pronoun?
---
Credit to u/katamanaro for the original .gif
---
How does this relate to money sinks?
---
Thanks
---
What? That did not happen. Show me the poll where 85% of people voted for rares...
---
Every 99 is exciting when you first start it, then insanely demotivating and depressing at 95-98, then extremely exciting again 98-99.
---
Judging by your inability to screenshot, yeah you are dumb.
---
Where about is he located?
---
What setup do you use to kill?
---
I agree, I think boss drops like Zulrah/Vorakth are a terrible design.  Im happy they moved away from it on this update.
---
Nice
---
Yeah, I just did this quest two days ago. The old Head Mourner was clearly an elf, but with a sick mustache. Even if you were spacebarring you could still see it.
---
i tried to tick eat it for a couple hours by going in there with only a couple lobsters and didn't succeed once, idk if i suck or its not possible. in any case it won't be an option for me. im slaying demonic gorillas hoping for like 30 brew drops, i guess that's  my only chance lol
---
Absolute unit
---
A cyan light and a magenta crystal make a dark blue light.
---
Awww shit here we go again
---
Well no, because Elena is a human. So that argument doesn't really work.
---
Looks sick m8
---
That‚Äôs genius
---
Blue dragon in cage below heros guild, get just over 4k per kill, guaranteed about 60k per inventory
---
If anyone wants one, PM me or buy from GE for 100m
---
Can I come with you?
---
No problem, if you're unsure of anything let me know :)
---
I'd support that as long as the precursor elements to the items aren't tradable, and the xp from making whatever items was abysmal.
---
If the items were craftable at certain level milestones and gave next to no xp, I think that would be fine.
---
If you actually read the dialogue after each seal it tells you the floor and general direction of the next seal so it is actually really easy to find
---
This guy slaps your girls ass, wyd?
---
No it's not likely that they'll go down in a meaningful way. If you see the price graph you can see they ALWAYS drop on Sunday and are due another 'drop' but look to only drop a few hundred k.
---
That aside if it's at all possible to buy membership with real cash that would be the best use of your time/effort. I.e. Spend an hour or two making cash in real life for a month of membership VS spending 8-10 hours grinding for a bond in-game.
---
Ok cool cool, i think rewards vary on levels of skills
---
Damn Jagex, you still know how to surprise me
---
Automatics are terrible. They are built for cripples, get over yourself.
---
You pay more money for a worse transmission for the sake of being a lazy reactive driver.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat without mm2 done and only 70 herblore, so no brews for me. Using blood spells I got the bitch down to about 300 health on my third attempt, that‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôve gotten. I think that‚Äôs the best bet.
---
If they are designed by these mods they will not fit in
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more.  I find myself loving the older, classic graphics over the newer games with better graphics.
---
Any insight to what your final gear set up will be when you tackle the inferno?
---
its all runescape classic
---
I‚Äôve seen guides in which up to 70K xp/hr can be achieved though woodcutting redwoods. I can‚Äôt seem to even get 60K/hr (I hover around 55K/hr). I have 91 woodcutting; using dragon axe at the woodcutting guild. Anything I‚Äôm missing or are guides just exaggerating?
---
He isn‚Äôt a girl and he isn‚Äôt pretty so no one will suck up to him and give him a pass for art that clearly doesn‚Äôt fit
---
that would add all the issues of devaluation for ironman while solving absolutely nothing except increasing xp rates for an already fast skill.
---
I‚Äôm glad I wasn‚Äôt the only one.
---
I have an account with name "Onal". Still wondering how the fuck i'm still not forced to change it lol
---
sadly at the time of this comment he will upload guide around 20-44 hours cause of upload speed :( 
---
 Source:(his community tab)
---
That's no glitch...
---
Take away the EXP goal they crave or skillcape and see if they still have fun tick training.
---
because jagex is trying to turn this into low budget wow
---
The second I spawn I reveal the first room; I aim to collect 6 of each resource on my first trip away from the central room (This doesn't always work out however). I make sure I collect at least one weapon frame on this firs trip as well. I try to balance my time between farming and killing on this trip, since you need a fair few shards to make items. Once my inv is full I tp to the central room and make one of each basic armour along with a bow (upgraded to level two). Remaining resources are dropped in front of the singing well. I cook any fish I have and drop them by the range. 
---
Next trip is to finish the 9 of each resource I need overall (so another 3 of each in a perfect scenario). This trip is also to farm up some cash and create 2 potions for the fight, I take one sip of a potion to help with gathering. I always look for a dark beast or bear for the level three weapons upgrade. once I have one, I use the remaining time to fish as much as I can. Then it's back to the centre to upgrade and cook before I go in. This often comes down to the last few seconds. Then it's fight time.
---
Obviously it rarely works out as smoothly as this, but it's my game plan. Hope that helps :)
---
Lol this is incredibly dumb. Not only is anno a regular English word but we can't start banning names that might be offensive in other languages. Literally every name is offensive in one language or another
---
Looks like when you overdo the mods on a game and have to do a clean install because of how bad you fucked it up.
---
It has a spirit tree, fuck off
---
No way in hell so far, I got lucky and got an armour seed which I sold for 5 mil, but the average value of my ~12 min C Gaunt kills is about 100k.
---
What are you on about? There is no 99....  
---
I summed up all his skills, assuming slayer is 56(almost impossible to get 99 slayer with those cb stats) and farming 81, total level 1478 is correct. There is no 99.
---
damn how big is your dick
---
This will still never be me with the inferno lol
---
I mean it literally also posts a paragraph in your chat upon login telling you exactly what happened and what to do with your crystal gear.
---
Aim to get the Weapon Frame ASAP, I also try to get enough shards for the upgraded Bow but IDK if that's optimal. I currently have a 100% success rate with the strat of:
---
Rush Upgraded Crystal Bow  
---
Get 25 Fish and 9 of each resource, 3 herbs, dropping them all in the main room once I get a full inv  
---
Make a teleport crystal each time, eventually making 3 of the potions while I gather resources, decanting to 2x 4-doses and drinking the leftover dose so I have enough run energy to run around  
---
I'm bad at keeping track of the hits so I make the Staff after I get my 2nd weapon frame
---
I've done a few Challenge Mode Gauntlets too but the strat doesn't really work for that bc it's too RNG to get the 2nd weapon frame and enough fish
---
That's me' mate!
---
I will pitch this idea
---
His total xp...
---
You‚Äôre totes right, I completely love the old school graphics. I‚Äôd be a bit devastated if they updated it all.
---
Technically RS2 was in beta in 2003, and all models were made in 2003. Here's some pics from the RS2 beta, which should be around December of 2003  here you can see some of the dialogue heads that didn't exist in RSC, but are still unchanged to this day. https://m.imgur.com/a/G9ctf

I think OP got lost in the desert
---
Adding the ge to Prif would never happen simply because of the whole RS3 thing. Also, I feel like adding the ge to Prif in general is just not worth it. Besides that, I think with the new Skilling boss, the gauntlet (this is sadly going to be boring quick since it seems to be very repetitive and not super randomized) and some of the other mentioned things should keep it from being dead content. I am sure they will tie more into prif down the road and also you got remember there are a bunch of people who want to get the reqs to go to prif. Basically, I wouldn't jump to conclusions or worry about it being dead content right now.
---
No worries, this would get to front page for sure if the timing was right.
---
That's not what he said..... he said his first 99,
---
not his first 13,034,000
---
limited dev team
---
What a guy
---
So I know how to pull the info into google sheets when it is in tables but it looks like [RSBuddy.com](https://RSBuddy.com) everything is built in divs, any ideas how to target those?
---
11$ btw.
---
Elsie upstairs in Varrock church?
---
To each their own. But he asked for opinions and someone stated they view it as sketchy and I agree. But like anything you and everyone else are free to use whatever you feel comfortable with.
---
Thank you! I hope you get the blade soon, would love to know how rare it is
---
Ahh yes banking the logs is what‚Äôs bringing the rates down for me. Thank you!
---
Ardy Cape takes literally a couple minutes, about 100 gp. There's literally no excuse. Shame on you for letting this travesty occur.
---
Provides slash, Mage and Prayer bonus. Obby cape offers only defense bonuses.
---
Any ome buying them is gambling thats on them
---
You can use the words Gay, Slut, etc in usernames but can't use Anno? Pretty silly Jagex
---
Boi why u on this subreddit then
---
That's dumb as hell they made it a secret. Whoever found it first is raking in cash.
---
Probably some lore reasons. I think he looks pretty cool. Wen't from being a generic male elf to a unique character that stands out.
---
With what I‚Äôve seen from the blog it‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôll be dead content soon.
---
Like fossil island, which they‚Äôve neglected
---
Good job bud. That quest was a pain but felt very rewarding to finish. 
---
What are your next upgrades going to be?
---
Not even sketchy, it's literally a cheat client.
---
This.
---
I had a blast doing the quest. Read all the dialogue, and figuring it out as I went. I really feel sorry for spacebar jammers who will miss out on great story.
---
73cb lvl atm, should I be hitting up Konar as soon as I hit 75? Or would I be struggling with her tasks? Cheers
---
Completely different, actually the BH store is practically the opposite, it brings new items into the game, doesn't take anything out. Well, it does indirectly take out supplies used for pking or wildy slayer/bossing to get emblems, but probably negligible compared to how much they are used elsewhere. It's not barrows or anything high level, so it's mostly used for alchables which eventually make gold.
---
Iorwerth is also mentioned in the books, which also pre-date runescape.
---
shill
---
He's so far gone he'll spite vote no when warding is repolled and complain when it doesn't pass.
---
if you're picking anything off any tree you're doing it too slow
---
That would be nice! No worries!
---
Vile temptress! Injecting your essence into old  school is unforgivable
---
Good guess, but doesn't look like that was it. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
I'm aware. If he's just getting MM done he obviously is still learning and probably hasn't done much content. 
---
Obby cape is dumb and way too expensive, but people have been using it as an adjunct until they get a fire cape forever. It's a normal new player mistake.
---
Love how the no voters are now the intellectuals of this sub. Probably the same bunch that screamed ree in McDonalds when they didn't get their Szechuan.
---
ok thanks for the reply. this issue is long resolved. im sorry i offended you
---
I gotcha. I haven‚Äôt really looked into RL+ much but I know they have an inferno plugin (?), a scouting plugin (Sick Nerd tweeted about it for PvP), AOE for Raids and a few other things that kinda go into a boundary pushing area for me. Or they at least have additional plugins Runelite opted to not include at Jagex‚Äôs request or themselves thinking their broken.
---
That's a bummer to hear, do you think there is a way to be more efficient with it? The new sword should be pretty worth.
---
I would wield the fuck out of that staff
---
I still haven't -_- got stuck at the stage escaping the cell and getting the items, rage quit (story of my RuneScape life)
---
Game runs at the same fps. Only the animations get interpoled and new inbetweens get added for all animations, the basic fundamental animation stays the same. Longer view distance changes the art style how exactly?
---
It‚Äôs not much but, I appreciate all of your hard work.
---
I can't even fucking find where the boss is located.
---
Also what gear and invent setup did you use?
---
That feel when she isnt an elf and the elves look more human just with glazed over faces and different skin colours.
---
Are you using linux?
---
Yeh, just wear black d-hide
---
Is there a wiki for the lore?
---
You‚Äôre all missing the point, every piece of content that you bring up requires some level of skill to learn or do each time. This takes no effort, is skilling (not meant to be big profits in the first place because no risk, and don‚Äôt say you can die you just go grab your shit no cost), and beats most other profit making methods.
---
Didn't censor your total exp, thanks for the account kiddo
---
This looks like how my grandmother dresses if you remove the staff.....
---
You can, got one while mining runite
---
Because they subscribed to twitch prime
---
I haven't done it yet, but the lack of scaling is wintertodtesque.
---
You both just didn't get the joke so...
---
Well glad to know somebody else is in the same boat as me lol
---
It's funny that a mermaid underwater at fossil island has a more normal feeling chathead to me than this human
---
awww so cute. But actually its a ring you can buy that turns you into bushes!
---
(it won't)
---
For me it's the matchmaking.
---
That's it.
---
He jumps at them and bites their throats
---
Haha yes only slightly worse than some of the most difficult content in the game (raids)! Perfect comparisons nice man. Good shit.
---
Absolute legend
---
I said the same thing when I saw the fanmade changes to the Sonic movie trailer.
---
How long did it take in total?
---
I think I saw that painting in the game little nightmares
---
Jesus Christ its Jason Bourne
---
Came all the way back here after looking through all your stuff to say you're seriously talented and hilarious!!
---
When I first went on the guide it was pretty empty since it was early into the update but someone had put Kyatt Top and Bottom as a item requirement for the quest even though u don't need it. Bought the items for like 15k instead of the normal 3k. That guy prob made bank doing that depending on how many he sold, outstanding move.
---
Wearing it, I imagine.
---
Considering I literally just failed it mid quest this post is pure bullshit.
---
A true man of the people.
---
Bit of a shame. I'm having fun with it but out of 5 completions I think I've gotten about 50k loot 4 times and 80k once. Plus 5-7 crystal shards each time. PB is 11:40 so far.
---
Hopefully the sword isn't super rare. Even 1/50 would be like a 10 hour grind if you don't fuck up. Considering I'm finishing maybe 1/3 attempts I don't know if I'll be getting teh sword anytime soon.
---
She's definitely good at her job in terms of making art and models. I think the crystal armour and such looks great and fitting for example.
---
But the huge departure from OSRS' style in these chatheads isn't a reflection of her talent, it's a reflection of her ignorance to existing works.
---
Cry to your mum kid
---
Streamer "puggin" has it
---
I need the beer to calm my nerves after I just shit myself.

Called the ring of nature btw.
---
Ring of Nature that is.

*Inhales sharply* No
---
Id care more about them trying to make cows look "modern and HD" in an old engine that can't do that and instead create some rubber looking cow-thing. They can add more cows provided there's reasoning and balance put into the process
---
Every spade is 1 xp
---
For me it crashes the app.  :(
---
There really isn‚Äôt any such item on this version of the game.
---
what if they were imbued?
---
Nice well rounded account btw. Keep it up!
---
Nice man looks like you picked the perfect amount of supplies. Also 69 mins is a great time for a first ever attempt. Awesome work.
---
Also for flairs you just comment a specific letter by its self and it will set it so for instance commenting D will flair it as discussion H humor. I forget the rest
---
This is the greatest fucking sub lmao
---
Fuck, this would‚Äôve been nice when I did regicide on my alt 2 days ago
---
I went with what the Wiki said was good, turned out to be perfect for me.
---
So I just need to comment a single letter?
---
what a God
---
&gt; I bet that if you're invested enough to have that strong of an opinion about mtx, you aren't leaving anyway.
---
ftfy. It works all ways
---
I did, it's just theres a lot of limitations on where to move depending on which elevator you're using, so it's a lot of running back and forth to find the right ones, and even then they can be meh directions.
---
Just got this step! I just tried talking to Eluned, wasn't her. Need to finish roving elves to try Mawrth in Lleyta
---
That would make them worth 2-10x max cash stacks eventually.
---
Everyone would sell everything just to buy one.
---
I am also an accountant. Are you me?
---
everything crashes in the summer... students are home from college visiting friends and not playing. No big PvM update this summer. Happens every summer

Why doesn't she have a nose????
---
Zulcano became easier now lol
---
You're delusional if you think as many people were voting yes with alts. The amount of people who didn't want warding hated warding more than the people who wanted it liked it. Not to mention majority of the content creators against it as well.
---
I can't even tell the difference
---
I hope we can vote to reverse this stuff. All of the new heads are worse across the board. It's shocking that they tried to improve something that already looked outdated and crappy and somehow did worse.
---
hey man i know u said not to be rude but just wanted to let you know ur being rude
---
It's a *killer!*
---
Just find a popular world and it‚Äôs a kill every 2-3minute. Definitely do not solo it is not worth the time or effort.
---
What the fuck is an Ardy cape?
---
I got these kills within the last hour and 1 more which wasnt logged. Made 52m.
---
ok
---
They respawn every several hours.
---
Also they launched an Ad campaign.
---
Why advertise when quests come out? Why doesn't Jagex stream PvM challenges?
---
It‚Äôs only during the quest once there is an instance active below you
---
Might be the game still thinks you're in your poh
---
yes doenst work. i destroyed the cyan crystal, and it said that destroying it will reset the maze, and nothing....
---
There is 1 spawn per world and then they have a several hour respawn timer.
---
This tweet is in the future
---
It's a nightmare, good job.
---
Konar is fine if you don't cannon and haven't unlocked the good burst tasks.
---
that is fucking BRILLIANT. good job jagex.
---
Some dude gave me the cape and the helm. He was quitting and I thought the shit looked cool so I asked for it. I think they‚Äôre good items.
---
In this particular instance, I think it's fine. It telegraphs that something big is coming while giving you plenty of time to heal up to full.
---
It's actually a pretty tame fight compared to the other Grandmaster OSRS bosses (Glough/Vorkath/Galvek).
---
that 3rd age range set looks sick as fuck, specially the crossbow
---
Gz nerd
---
Looks more like Jed
---
There may be a list somewhere, but you could write a script to make a table for you. Just have it loop until you get an error and each step have it log the id it's on and then append to the variable the  name of the item.
---
My dude you honestly think Elenas new chathead looks good? You‚Äôre trolling
---
Personally I prefer catacombs since you can afk with bonecrusher for like 4 mins at a time.
---
Bob random event as well lol
---
Fighter torso gives a strength bonus which will help give you a higher max melee hit, so will be a better choice than rune.
---
Noone cares m8
---
Was this light puzzle less AIDS than mep2?
---
Imagine spending 250$ on pixel game to stand at  GE  24/7 and  and flex on kids
---
i guess its just a matter of my last year of college starts in october, I wont have anytime to play due to work, school, and being married. So I'm trying to use the play time while i have it.
---
You seem to have the titles backwards. How can you seriously think a bunch of identical faces with different hair are "soulful", but actual individual models for these people to reflect their characters is "soulless"
---
your dragon example is bullshit. it's not because of shops, it's because of the shitload of drops from monsters.
---
Spoilers: communities don't consist of a single person.
---
Looks very good. Runescape is developing fine
---
I think the problem is they wanted a less human looking model. Yours is more hd than the base model but still looks human. They tried a new facial structure and it just looks dumb, but the goal wasn't just to make it look newer.
---
Just like the castle wars doors close every system update, the rabbit will spawn too.
---
Rune isn‚Äôt bad but there‚Äôs much better equipment available for you. Others have suggested you work towards the fighter torso and the dragon defender. You should also go for the berserker helmet.
---
IIRC Guthix brought Seren into Gielinor with the elves, so this memoir could be from that time.
---
Well it looks cool as hell. I don‚Äôt know how stats work so I just went for the Armor that has the game‚Äôs name in it. Figured it‚Äôd be a safe bet. 
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
Fighter torso is BiS (Best in Slot) for melee torso slot until bandos chest plate which is late game
---
Sailing sucks and Dungeoneering is a minigame
---
Oh. Am I not allowed to generalize? I guess thats only for little boys with less hair on their face then I have on my nuts.
---
Go fuck yourself you beautiful little angel
---
nope
---
it's literally the same way it's in rs3, and it's completly fine there, why wouldn't it be here
---
Harder and longer puzzle, but much less AIDS because no hostile NPCs constantly picking at you.
---
Yeah and you don't do anything so what's your point lol
---
So is pooping on their toes but that ain't for everyone either
---
102 combat still sporting my Obby cape. Man.
---
If the fight didn't take like an hour every god damn attempt I'd have it by now. I've made about 3 attempts and after that I can't be bothered. I'm sure other people look down on me for my laziness, but it's such a waste of time.
---
My guess is he‚Äôs gonna camp lucky for a long long long long time. Go for blessed dhide and rcb.
---
oh no
---
Is the content enjoyable? I thought it at least sounded fun, honestly would farm it if I was enjoying it enough at least for a while. Plus the sword would be good for bossing, I'm sure that's what it's meant for. Charging it isn't too big of a deal for sure wouldn't use it to train but if it helps down bosses faster I'm sure it's worth
---
thats good
---
where's the video!!
---
having it collecting dust in my bank
---
It wouldn't work for long obviously. There are tons of people that are untrained in many aspect of game design, yet they would vote on most of the things. Things like marketing, data, customer research would have to be made public which would only be abused by the competition. It would also make the process of changing stuff in the game increadibly slow, the content most probably wouldn't be connected at all and the game would have no integrity at all. Additionally sooner or later the game would kill itself since there always has to be a majority and there's a big chance the majority will be retarded. They'd start adding content that will not necessary be good in the long term, but it could pull different similar minded people into the game, amplifying the issue.
---
TL;DR It wouldn't work
---
Ive loved everything shes designed tbh, except Elena...
---
you cant sell it back
---
Alch yourself. Thanks for the downvote, kiddo
---
Flexing is peak efficiency
---
I think that's an overreaction. But calling out art you don't like is just that, stating you don't like something.
---
Still a waste of money. Priff all day
---
It's because Elena plays a fairly large role in the new quest. All of the Elves have that same updated chat head and character model. Doing the entire quest with all the elves then just talking to her with her old design would seem fairly out of place.
---
A crown fit for the most wealthy of elves.
---
Hmm then why aren‚Äôt dragonbane weapons effective against zulrah if it was created by the dragonkin?
---
Thanks, my dude. I said this in another post, but I‚Äôll repeat it - 
---
I don‚Äôt know how stats in this game work so I just went with armor that has the game‚Äôs name in it. I just started doing Slayer because some guy in the Varrock bank was spamming about it. 
---
Is that armor good for Slayer or should I look elsewhere? I‚Äôve been using that cool ass black mystic armor and a smoke staff that I had to save up for like god damn 3 months for. I guess the positive is that I save so much on fire runes now.
---
im part of a very large zerk clan but its mostly just skillers, your free to join.
---
When I was younger I thought turning an item into gold meant I turned it into a gold bar
---
Spent ages killing goblins to get money for a nature rune to try it out and transform a useless bronze dagger into a gold bar
---
Was so disappointed when it turned into 4 coins
---
that was just pocket change
---
0kg
---
Naa OP is a shit starter. Read that stupid fucks comment history.
---
People that are "confused" are just looking for drama too. This isn't something to be confused about. I guess if you suffer from a chronic case of retardation you could get confused.
---
250 million golden coins
---
Pretty sure it's untradable. Might possibly be tradable in its uncharged form and I didn't realize it? Was under the impression though that it being untradable was one of the main incentives for doing the gauntlet.
---
around 500k ea
---
Yes and he is a smart guy
---
if it is, great! u got hydra,vorkath,zulrah all 3/hr. Afk rune dragons 2m a hr? why cant skilling be there to?
---
Aka wow-clone
---
Oh god why...
---
In the niddle of this quest. What a jerkkkkkk
---
TIL anybody in half-good gear is automatically a neckbeard
---
To be fair, it seems you are Level 85 and the exp rates listed are for 90... But the course does seem a bit lackluster. I think the main issue is the Shards; it is like 18 Shards per hour when the best methods are supposed to give 50 per hour. I can understand if they didn't want Agility to be as good as The Gauntlet or Zalcano, but 18 is pretty terrible. At its best, the course seems to a close rival to Ardy for exp, but it is more annoying due to trees obstructing your view and small clickboxes and it requires more attention for shortcuts. So if the Crystal Shards can't compete with the Marks of Grace, it probably won't be that great of a course.
---
I'd say the Crystal Shards at least need to be increased by 1.5-2x the current rate. On top of that, the exp could be a bit higher and the clickboxes could do with some tweaking, especially if the darn trees will keep getting in the way. I like the idea of a chance of more than one portal per lap. Overall, I am pretty disappointed with the course; even excluding the shards and exp, it is a pretty bad implementation of a good concept since a portal to skip ahead one obstacle is the lamest way to do a changing course like I suggested.
---
You sound butt hurt.
---
Its way way longer man. It is plenty of time to eat up. Loot 20 things and tele out.
---
Its tradable you just gotta charge it with shards
---
I guess any monster in the slayer cave has a chance to drop that item? Fully a guess and woox got it today sold for like 4m tho I think
---
I'm really just running around trying to ask anyone in game any 0 people know....
---
That's how I like it big boi
---
Slayermusiq is the reason I obtained my quest cape 2 weeks ago, and will be the reason for me getting it back after his upload üëç
---
Lol why would they do this? One of the cool things about osrs is all the humanoids are consistent, everything looks similar and shit. Jiggleflex never ceases to amaze. Stop and appreciate the fact that a team of professionals who look at oldschool all day and are fellow fans of the game gave the OK on this.
---
Try Lady Trahaearn in Prif.

I'm sure women everywhere are crying out to thank you for saving them for the patriarchy in the comments on a meme from a forum dedicated to a 15 of year old medieval rpg clicking simulator.

I'm sorry if my claim regarding the front page was misleading. Here's an example that was further up earlier, though, and is still pretty far up: https://i.imgur.com/JdOvALZ.png
---
In this case it's not *that* bad, and if it was an isolated instance I'm sure I would agree that the punctuation is technically not incorrect and thus not a problem. The problem is that the majority of the dialogue is like that, or worse. There is no other quest in the game that contains dialogue that breaks style rules in this manner AFAIK.
---
Congrats! I also got mine today after the second attempt.
---
One free change every month. Each extra namechange costs one bond and you will not get credited membership for them.
---
Haha for real though. I remember being able to pickpocket farmers for seeds in preparation for when Farming was released, and some worthless seeds sold for ridiculous amounts cause nobody knew what to expect üòÇ
---
Completion of Dragon Slayer 2, high/maxed combat and expensive gear.
---
It's a cosmetic upgrade for the dragon pickaxe. And no, you're not the first one. Saw one drop like 8 hours ago.
---
Whats herbiboar xp rate compared to red/black chins at 80 hunter, and should I be using hunter potions with either method?
---
i suppose that mod would rather flick the bean
---
Try joining the deliveritems cc, seems like a lot of friendly people in there. They appreciate tips though
---
WHAT you can‚Äôt be friends with yourself?
---
a complete set looks so unnatural and reminds me of 2013 eoc rs. it looks better when its just the body, legs and helmet
---
The rabbit is a boss that appears as lvl-2, but has like 2000 health and outrageous defense. It drops (at least sometimes) a crystal grail, which dropped with a shown value of like 15m. Woox sold it for 4m, I believe. I don't think it has any uses.
---
Apparently, there was one rabbit on each world, and so far they have not respawned.

Idk man I made 15m off 100 Zalcano kills.
---
R.I.P. Princess Chest. My 90's Tomb Raider nostalgia will no longer be triggered by zulrah runs. &lt;/3
---
Not gonna lie, I honestly do not believe that there was anything that RSC did better than rs2.
---
Ex. Failing a spell in RSC meant having to wait like 15 or 20 seconds to try casting another.
---
If memory serves, armour did not negatively impact magic and it is why the Mystic Battlestaffs don't have any improved magic bonuses over the regular variants and their only extra bonuses are mele. As you would mele and mage with the same equipment
---
Make ur own ultracompost and do tithe farm.
---
This is pretty cool man!
---
Gf
---
If we had OSRSHD, then the whole game would have newer graphics you donkey. That's fine but no one wants newer graphics mixed in with older ones.
---
I wish we could see a, ‚Äúmaking of‚Äù because I have zero understanding of animations and production of this manor. So to me, I can appreciate it, but I can‚Äôt fully grasp how much time and effort really went into making a production like this. Someone help with an explanation plox.
---
Was just on the house party world, like 20 dudes there. Some were complaining about not getting drops but I maybe missed 2 in 35~ KC.
---
I've heard W2 has a mass going too.
---
Too soon
---
if you do snape grass on all allotment patches + herbs it's about 25k xp every time.. So you can easily get 100+k farm xp/day if you do a run in the morning, one when you're home from work (or whatever), one later and one before bed for example.
---
I've had days where i got 300k farm xp in a day just from trees+fruit trees and snape grass.
---
Also, of course do mahogany trees while you're at it.
---
I never seen a ss in there. Bare minimum is whip, or even the upgraded ones are minimum. A dragon hunter lance is VERY useful as well as blowpipe. 
---
For the rooms before boss, having these items are important: salve ammy ei(will be very useful but not a sin to not have them), dragon pickaxe (bareeeee min is rune pickaxe but i never seen one before). 
---
Once again, weapon you must have are trident swamp and blowpipe. Highly encourage dragon hunter lance but a whip is bareeeeeeee minimum. 
---
Amulet slowly upgrade to bis (like torture etc), otherwise use fury for now. 
---
Stats wise i guess as high combat stats as possible? Herblore is 70+ to make restores and brews (check ingame i forget lvl). High thieve and mining and wc lvl are bonus for some rooms, not necessary (above 60 will be nice)
---
Graceful and a skillcape? With your vast resources?    
---
Come on over to /r/fashionscape we'll get you sorted out.
---
I believe the word is "parody"; but you're definitely entitled to your opinion. :)
---
You need ten anyways for master stash so no big deal
---
Yes I did talk to her, however I noticed that I got a clue scroll in my inventory from Baxtorian is that how you find Meilyr after the glowing symbols? It‚Äôs giving me coordinates that are new and not on the wiki so I guess I‚Äôm screwed either way
---
Yeah ima need some chathead reversions ASAP
---
These people will also quit mid level. And should just shut up.
---
New chat heads are an abomination
---
I mean, too be fair, I doubt the team of professionals is gonna make a mod redo the design after it‚Äôs submitted. Maybe they would make suggestions during the project but never make them reset the design because it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt look old school‚Äù.
---
You're not dumb for stickin to your guns and doing a quest without spoilers friend.
---
Like everything
---
Don't worry buddy 103 here and still have it. Just recently got barrows gloves after sitting on 193 QP but no DT for time.
---
Gz. Why you wouldn't show him instesd is beyond me.
---
In the new update, they changed the models of a lot of NPCs and theres a lot of negative feedback. The girl in the post (I think) was one of mods who helped do this.
---
1, lol. 1 attack and 1 strength.
---
+1 remember to speak to Oziach FIRST
---
Awful. I wish they would stop making new chat heads, they either look (as in the above case) objectively bad, or in the case of some (like that fella in Kourend who tasks you with rebuilding the statue,) too detailed and kind of unnerving. 
---
For all of the good assets they make, doesn't seem like they're close to capturing the 'old school' feel with some of their faces yet, which is understandable, faces are something people are pretty sensitive to and are no doubt difficult to get right.
---
In all honesty though, I don't see why changing old models (especially for characters) is something that sometimes apparently doesn't need to be polled
---
They added so many Easter eggs. Me and friend went exploring early and found a lot of em. Only one I didnt understand. But trust me. You won't be disappointed
---
strongly oppose jagex dropped the ball with this highly anticipated update the only good things was the last fight in the quest some of the lore in the quest and zulcano
---
Any good zulcano guides? I've no clue what I'm doing, thought I got two kills, but I'm still at zero. The extent of my knowledge is orange medallion bad.
---
Agreed.  It‚Äôs honestly not bad at all.
---
No. Honestly osrs looks good and even better today. Jagex cant into new graphics just look at rs3 everything is hella fugly. Its like the art department is on a bad acid trip with a Malaysian flu fever.
---
They're really close together and very white
---
Thats still like under 20m right lol?

So pretty easy. Not respectable, but nice.
---
Are you wearing a ham logo?
---
No people are gonna do this all the time lol
---
I don‚Äôt think they look that. No idea why everyone is complaining. Why is everyone so critical of everything??
---
Almsot no one? Ive asked a lot of people in discord voice channels and they all use smooth animation and textures, more so than the render distance. 
---
How did you come to the conclusion that no uses those plugins. Its rare i find someone not using them unless they arnt aware of the plug ins.
---
Log into the normal client and log into runelite. Even with just render distance and gpu, it looka extremly different,
---
I think all of those plugins are more like shaders in a game rather than texture replacments or changing models etc. So its enhanced rather than changed.
---
Because people would be less ignorant if they tried it, worked with sailing.
---
&gt; no lol
---
the dude came out today and I was there for 3 kills and got nothing, cut me some slack lol. One of the other guys I was with got nothing as well, so only 1 out of 3 got a drop any of the kills I was there for, kinda logical to assume it's just one drop but glad I'm wrong.
---
You know if you need to be present for the entire kill to get a drop? Trying to figure out why I didn't get anything, think I did around the same damage as everyone else.
---
I'm out of the loop. Someone explain this meme to me :(
---
I got that yesterday after right clicking someone immediately after leaving my house. Didn‚Äôt actually get to see if it would kick them out of the world though lol
---
Lletya
---
Where to open it with? Got the download now
---
Can u sell if back?
---
tbow alchs for 2.4m
---
It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre ever going to talk to her after the quest anyway
---
And yet the thing we all wanna see if the tiniest damn thing on the screen.
---
Looks like garg pet
---
Im all for this. Takes money out of the game directly. Nobody benefits from getting it from a clue or whatever, so the only way they enter the game is to make 250m disappear. Works great imho.
---
I've never seen a streamer or YouTube video using it and none of my friends use it. I didn't even know texture smoothing was a thing until now.
---
You and your friend may be newer players to the game idk. Id wager on most people playing since 02-04 using default textures and animations.
---
They can't finish a skill then poll it. Too much work.
---
Glad i can still give off that vibe while still fucking OP's mom
---
Hd looked badass as fuck. Dungeons, fire, water, fields, mountains.. they all looked so good. The bubbly player models not so much, but the look was definitely nice in some aspects.
---
Warding was a huge project and not worth company development time if it wasnt something the community wanted. Would be a waste of hundreds of billable hours.
---
I absolutely agree. I don't like anyone having the attitude of "this stuff sucks im way better" when moving into an existing business / service. She needs to adapt, not the reverse.
---
I think her ingame models are fine, and have her own flair while not seemingly out of the world-style. But the chat heads... they grabbed my attention from minute one and i still haven't shaken that feeling of them just being 'off' for lack of a better word.
---
If people don't play some parts of the game, they turn into dead content (and I think OSRS has a lot of it), also you can't play stuff like minigames alone and additionally this people vote in the polls so they are influencing everything.
---
I guess the wings gives it the similarities.   
---
Thanks mate!
---
I think Runelite only serves to enhance the existing graphics. Funnily enough i'm not that much of a fan of smoothing the player animations. It makes everything look a bit wonky because it wasn't designed with 60fps smoothness in mind. But the render distance and proper scaling to modern displays? Thats just QoL, its not changing art assets.
---
I'd say OpenGL or "OSRS HD" is a better example for your point.
---
Logging in at wc guild near magics is a recipe for heart attack

Go to the center of Priff and go up the stairs. Just south of the stairs is a memory machine. You can add the crystal to it to get a memory from Seren.
---
I‚Äôve enjoyed my 75-99-75 acct. keeps combat clean enough to pvp but allows you to pvm at a high lvl. 83 cons 78 herb 77 pray. Those are the expensive stats.
---
It‚Äôs *kind of* OC. 
---
I think the dude you replied to is saying it‚Äôs not OC because of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/c7r7re/separating_the_boys_from_the_men/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) post. Idrc though I liked both.
---
we wouldn't miss ya. I think Elena looks hot as fuck now
---
That was 2008 brother.
---
Yeah I felt greasy typing it. I know that a number of people don't think of that economy of it though, like they get caught up in the process of 'saving money' by earning a bond in-game that they forget that they're paying with their time in a big way. 
---
Like those people that drive across town to use a coupon.
---
I agree.

Oh. Well. I like both. What do I do now?

Do you see orange text saying "download from server" on the right side after clicking the orange plus icon?
---
After clicking the "download from server" text does it bring you to a page that says "Get the latest Linux images"

After that scroll down until it says Ubuntu 16.04 Download and click that and it should download

Toxic masculinity is real. Though I guess here isn't the place to talk about that stuff.

If you actually played that long how do you still not know what you wanna do or how you wanna do it, to the point that your first thought is to ask such an open ended question on here? I'm not buying it...
---
Like I've literally never PKd and only have one main account I've used since I started playing, but if I wanted to start fresh and make a PK only account I wouldn't make a post saying "wat do i do?" because I already have a pretty good idea just from playing the game normally
---
Forgot to switch accounts OP?
---
Gz man! I finished it myself for the first time just a couple of weeks ago. It feelsgoodman
---
&gt;Having two similar accounts, or logging in under someone is not an example of that.
---
If literally nothing else, it makes you a desperate bitch who honestly spits in the face of a legitimate interaction and just makes you a joke. This mindset is why the wilderness is dead, and why everyone hates the entirety of the wilderness and the filth that dwells within.

Not all new content automatically has to be the best. Crystal shards instead of MoG is a great way to change it up and it can be expanded upon in the future.

Its an election, and OSRS is a democracy. Any contentious issue that gets voted on in the real world or digital world can and will get toxic. That's the nature of politics.
---
Do ppl from /r/all ever have any idea wtf is going on with our memes?
---
I'll tell her haha.
---
keep in mind allowing everyone free roam of the map can cause severe engine strain on new releases like today. Its gunna require engine work
---
Nooooo way papayas are profitable
---
Best no, but it atleast has to offer an alternative motivation, outside of getting shards for say armour and things, there doesnt seem to be a huge motivation to be here
---
As someone from the beginning, your completely wrong and basically everyone uses the added features that the clients use. 
---
Majority of the streamers use them unless they are doing a specific thing, like boaty and his 07 only account.

The default animations and graphics are shit, get your head out of the past.
---
runelite (and osb back then) have always been a stable 50 fps in almost all areas for me. the default client really doesn't run at the same fps. it's like 20-30 fps MAYBE, it's a fucking dog shit embarrassment lol.
---
Armor or no armor, the boss is still very accurate. Just make t1 armor and try to get 2 t3 weapons asap.
---
Man this is incredible, I assume it‚Äôs digital art but the way it emulates the big hard strokes and is really angular and all the earthy tones just looks incredible. Keep it up man this is awesome.

[Pretty irrelevant but the East/West mix up makes me think of this.](https://youtu.be/RuJNUXT2a9U)

weak, waiting on wiki and not the god slayermusiq1
---
Any suggestions?
---
not everything in slayer needs to be super profitable or profitable at all for that matter. The community being spoiled by zulrah and everything that followed as well as a lack of death mechanics has let the playerbase feel catered to and entitle. 
---
Besides all superiors are linekd strictly to a slayer monster there are no none slayer superior variants
---
Long live the monarchy, god save the Queen!
---
Nothing quite like a good glass of plonk and a pipe while doing achievement diary‚Äôs..... Amazing work mate!
---
You don't need the color wheel for the quest, if can't be found then perhaps it has been removed from the game.
---
This is really good keep it up maj
---
I agree.  I think the rarity should probably be higher than that just because of the FAR lower requirement though.  Maybe 1/300 or 1/512 or something.
---
Zulrah is classic runescape ?
---
‚ÄúMake ironman easier for me‚Äù
---
Jagex made something fun? Holy shit good for them
---
Yeah the wiki wasn't perfect, but I got it done without much trouble.
---
Do you have a list of kill by kill? The number of items you get seems really inconsistent to me.
---
It makes sense now for me,  I think I'll give a try for the next one without the wiki. ^^ Thank you!
---
Where is he located?
---
...Mate you took my screenshot.  I'm honored.

The helmet sounds like this one: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slayer_helmet
---
Gives increased accuracy and damage against monsters you're assigned for your slayer task, with the stats of a rune full helm. It's pretty awesome.

She also designed the crystal armor which looked like garbage
---
you chose to gimp your account - play accordingly

Holy shit, what a legend
---
He is serious. And dont call him Shirley!
---
That move is max hp based so you'll either need brews or to be totally topped no matter your level.
---
Oh nice so more like 2.5-3m with max stats
---
no u shaddap mom said it's my turn to be Tim
---
Pros:
---
- Pretty compelling story
---
- Light puzzle was fun, not having enemies was a big improvement (had to cheat for the last half cause I was in a hurry though :( )
---
- Final boss was really visually striking, kudos to the designers!
---
Cons:
---
- CHAT HEADS
---
- Only using "they" for the player's pronouns was confusing at best, annoying at worst
---
- Combat was good for the most part, but the boss can potentially deal huge damage and IMO it's hard to deal with that attack without using a guide to know how to, and then navigating back to the boss is a pain
---
- Running out of run energy in the light puzzle. Not a big deal if you're just following a guide, but I used a ton of energy/stam pots trying to figure it out myself. My humble suggestion: The dialogue said the maze had strange physical properties or something like that, so I don't think it would be out of place to give infinite run energy while in the maze. Interested to hear others' thoughts on that
---
Ty for the update yagex :)
---
It's based off some metric of participation, like if you don't do enough in a kill you just get trash like 10-30k, but if you do a lot you get a 300k drop, usually you average out to around 100-150k in my experience, at 30 kills/hr
---
These snozzberries taste like snozzberries.
---
Once you put a mirror in and bring up the rotate mirror interface, they can't attack. But if there's nothing in it they can.
---
I wouldn't worry too much about fighter torso... it's a bit of a nuisance if you haven't done it before. I would recommend fremennik trials and maybe fremennik isles for a helm upgrade, and aim for warriors guild to get a dragon defender.
---
Gz on the dungeoniiring pet! /s
---
What the fuck
---
How big of a group?
---
Doubt it, they specifically updated the mirror UI with this update. Sounds like a unpolled QoL to me.
---
Rn it's looking like Zalcano is the Vorkath equivalent, I was getting &gt;3m/hr when I did it on the 2k total world with a ton of people.
---
I had to see if anyone was complaining about them. They are only used for slayer training and bosses you would use sharks for. so overall, not the overload we were thinking.
---
"Everything has to be human!!!!!"
---
Yzma and Kronk are back at it again with the potions it seems.
---
Yes they would. That's literally what an art direction is about, and the reason people draw concept art before production starts
---
Criticize the art and jagex don't target the individual person it's just toxic  and let me tell you a game dev secret, it's a group effort.
---
Some of those people 100% just stole your money and voted what they were going to vote in the first place.
---
Tbh i don't get the complaints, i think it is good that the elves get their own look, after all they are not humans, as for the actual design i think it fits the osrs style, it ain't pretty but this isn't RS3 with smooth hd graphics.
---
The new dungeoniiiring boss.
---
It is a fucking crime that we haven't got this man a golden gnome yet!
---
Now that crystal equipments stats dont degrade and dont need imbues why arent they coded like recoils or any other item with charges?
---
Normal pkers do
---
Of course.
---
The rabbit of caerbannogh or something like that,   the holy hand grenade of Antioch is required to kill it.
---
Fuck I was wondering what the story behind that mountain and the knife and all that was, that‚Äôs a cute little Easter egg
---
If you actually did the light puzzle on your own without a guide then it feels very reward (imo). Overall i think they nailed it could really care less about the chat heads. Theres plenty of content in osrs that looks wayyyyyyy worse. And why isnt anyone taking about how amazing prif looks?
---
i love you
---
I'm cool with the low rewards with chance of really expensive unique if the fight was more consistant. Right now I basically just hope I don't get smacked up through prayer and I can hit hard through the last 1/3 of hp.
---
Yeah at this point I'm pretty sure your a (fairly dedicated, fair play) troll.
---
It's pretty obvious that I'm not a bigot and you're trying to play to the stereotype of 'anyone who disagrees with me that women should be praised for having the humility and angelic benevolence to play a video-game is a bigot'.
---
Just finished the quest, that was actually very enjoyable and the final boss was sweet and not too difficult.
---
Didn't notice it either and i fully read nearly all
---
Woah. This is awesome.
---
I'm so close to 70 strength. Can't wait to get a defender

If you brew as soon as your attack animation starts you don't waste any time at all. You get slightly lower hits but as long as you restore pretty quickly afterwards then it's nearly negligible
---
Too expensive
---
Ahahahahhah literally can't breathe, so funny!
---
I joined about a few days after HD came out. Even if I‚Äôm not connected too much nostalgically by the standard graphics, I have to agree that this mix-matching needs to stop. I‚Äôll only be happy with full standard or full HD options, never in between because it looks really weird.
---
4Head
---
It's 4 attacks and then switch, all specials count as an "attack" that moves the cycle forward apart from his stomp.
---
It scales up to be about the same (slightly more in testing) than ardougne course by 99 Agility so I guess it's okay? Depends on how much you value using the Blade of Saeldor I guess.
---
No motivation for maxing a skill thats like 300k per hour? lol... gl maxing other skills.
---
I thought I was just being an idiot and wasn't capable of counting to 4, that'll make life easier.
---
Total to vote should be 1250
---
Man if only we could get skills polled that the game actually needs rather than just making a new skill by taking elements from existing skills and pre existing content from the rest of the game.
---
They can change the music file to make it less taxing but that may change the sound of the track. I haven't taken a look into the music track file but I think the track has quite a lot of effects happening at once at certain times (like pitch changes, velocity changes) that makes the music player a FPS eater.
---
NGL though, I really hate closeups of the player's face during quests with exaggerated emotions - such as Death of Chivalry or some of the other newer quests.
---
Because while we have updated chatheads, up close the Derpy faces animated with horror expressions just looks so bad ü§¢
---
I mean motivation as in what am I getting out of the game for doing this. Runecrafting has the lowest Xp rates but I am benifiting in the way that I can get money from it. With firemaking it‚Äôs pretty much useless for anything but quest requirements
---
Seren means Star in Welsh if anyone is interested. If you're not interested please don't read this comment üò°
---
Oh it scales? I had the feeling I was missing something, this is good news!
---
Now your username is actually the case I guess xd.
---
Protect that tree with your LIFE
---
Wait, in what world is that a girl?
---
Also worth mentioning the attack where zolcano will look at the glowing rock and fire a projectile at it.
---
It does ridiculous damage and I see people tanking it all the time when it's simply a matter of taking a step away.
---
It also changes what rock is glowing so you should use the attack travel time to run to the centre before seeing what the new glowing rock is
---
You literally said gaming is a male hobbie. That is bigoted. I also said women don't want special treatment, just equal treatment. Obviously, you ignore all of this because, you admit, you're trolling. I've said what I've said to educate others, I know none of this is getting through that trolly skull of yours.
---
Necklace of passing and run southwest, thats what i did.
---
I just knew it looked familiar...
---
That‚Äôd be a most toxic show. Sounds good.
---
Don't worry, ge will be put somewhere else soon as well. ;)
---
No idea, I couldn't find change notes either.
---
smooth animations look like shit
---
Can't seem to find that item on the wiki. What is that?
---
Making easier? Don't you mean less anoying?
---
#YELLOW EGG IN BARB ASSAULT IS 60M
---
\*Unfailable, I'm dumb
---
This might be the only non dead content they have of priff
---
Lol. Stop getting tilted. It's a joke. Just laugh.
---
Look at the waist, chest, shoulders and legs. It's not about the fact they are elves, wow characters use janky models with weird proportions like that. I've not seen anything like that in ANY OTHER MMO, until this.
---
I think Jagex is receiving a lot less praise than they deserve at the moment, all this new content has been amazing to try out and the quest is possibly my favourite quest in the game: amazing story and dialog, plus great puzzles really making you use your head. Thanks Jogflex, good stuff.
---
do the artists feel pressured to make stuff look better/more detailed? I mean, it makes sense for an artist to want to make the graphics in oldschool look "better" and more detailed (with good intentions), and for them to feel very limited by having to purposely make "bad" looking graphics. I personally think the old "bad" style is a core part of what makes osrs old school.
---
Basically I'm saying you are missing out on a fun puzzle.
---
What's the proper term then?
---

You mean buying gold isn't p2w when you need to farm a fuck ton of gold for raid buffs?

Instant level 60 isn't p2w when the classes that do top dps fluctuate every raid tier?
---
Such a nice pet, congrats man
---
That's a thicc ass goblin
---
No just 87
---
Sadly we seem to be heading down that path.
---
Can you go through the abyss to the death altar and take the shortcut to the lower level?
---
The boss always does four ‚Äòactions‚Äô which can either be an attack (including melee) or a special attack. Once four actions have occurred, he will switch to the other style of attack, and you should protect accordingly. He also loves to switch his protection prayer right after he‚Äôs made you switch or do something. Just to keep you on your toes of course.
---
Yeah they no longer look like wood elves. They look like the bad guys even though you only find out they‚Äôre the bad guys at the end of Regicide (or rolving elves)
---
And like, EVERYBODY played or knows somebody who play*ed* RuneScape, but there are far, FAR fewer people who *still* play, so like a lot can look at the picture and be like "It's RuneScape" but still be confused as shit
---
Ahh okay, sorry, I was not sure about the meaning lol. Anyway, I'm motivated to do it with my iron one fay ;)
---
Hey, we frequently protect pages with new content. We actually did this with Song of the Elves for a period of time, when there was an edit war/confusion about the seals. We don‚Äôt like to keep things protected for too long as it prevents genuine users, who may not want to sign up or may just want to make a quick edit, from editing.
---
Rest assured that we keep an eye on new pages and deal with anything bad when we see it. We have a bunch of automatic filters that block certain things from being added to pages too. If anything gets particularly bad, as it did with people fighting about the seals on the wiki page, we do protect the page to logged in users (it is obvious that people who have made an account have less determination to vandalise or be unhelpful).
---
But why change them?? If it's not good then what is the point of wasting development time and money on it. These are the kind of decisions that should be scrutinized because a. It's making the game look worse and b. It's a waste of money.
---
Doing nothing is the only waste of time.
---
Oh that's a good idea. I'll give that a shot when I get home. Thanks :)
---
Ah ok, thanks bro.
---
How does it feel that the most expensive cosmetic in game looks like shit but still has awesome vanity points
---
Let me know if it works out
---
Do we have to constantly check twitch and twitter to make sure we're there to complain? They should understand what fits in the game, its pretty obvious to anyone whos played
---
LOL
---
Without t2 armour I get completely shredded through prayer in Corrupted mode. I‚Äôve managed to get a kill with only tier 2 weapons though. From my anecdotal experience, armour is important in C Gaunt
---
casual racism is fun haha
---
praise the Great Lord brother, soon our time will come
---
It won‚Äôt be. She specifically tweeted she dislikes osrs art style and wants it changed
---

---
Try downgrading your pc for more frame drops
---
Meanwhile I've gotten 1.4m in 50 kills...
---
I‚Äôve been playing since 2005 and I think RS3 was ruined by ridiculous updates. Old school should stay old school in my opinion.  I mean...that‚Äôs the title of the game, right? I can just get on RS3 if I want to play RuneScape with too many updates. Sounds like a lot of the people complaining on here should do the same.
---
You know you only *pretend* to be a white knight in the quest right?
---
How is mocking a religion racist?
---
Now that I think about it, even though the puzzle was really annoying and really really annoying, I think it made the quest feel more special at the end
---
These are the type of people giving up on the diary journey after being unable to complete easy task #3.
---
Don't give vandalisers publicity, it's what they want, and just leads to more vandalism. Just report the edit on the wiki and move on.
---
Im so fucking confused
---
Near the poh portal.
---
To prevent accusations of undermining  the incoming global 2A (currently only seen in america)

Oh god oh fuck

Hold your balls pray and wish for good luck

99 miner here. Making 3mil/hr currently at zalcano masses. I have a feeling it‚Äôs going to get nerfed soon so profit while you can.
---
Not trying to flame you but if they got into your account and disabled the authenticator that means they have access to your email. That isn't jagex fault.
---
I‚Äôll try
---
No proof provided. Shitty low effort, low intelligence post.
---
This is amazing
---
Haha, didn't even notice, i love those little things!
---
When the group starts calling you They in conversation while you‚Äôre in the conversation... who wrote this?
---
Not nice
---
Yes they can, I finished the quest and was in last night.  I even tried the gauntlet briefly but not long enough to get a good handle on it.  Thanks for the reply!
---
Am Welsh, i approve of this
---
I love the camel cannon so much.
---
very low effort
---
didn't even let battery run out to 1% &amp; set time to 13:37 or 4:20
---
see me after class
---
This isn‚Äôt to make runecrafting better, it‚Äôs to add armors and always to make them
---
oh wow even rs3 memes are complete white lol
---
You gonna buy any of those 500k crystals that change its look?
---
It‚Äôs s chat head that looks a lot better than the original. Why are you so bothered? Literally makes no difference to the game or your life.
---
Why not? They look different to others, but still fit in old school just fine.
---
99 miner here. Can confirm it‚Äôs around 3mil/hr atm. I also was lucky enough to get crystal tool seed which I sold for 6mil at 100kc. Abuse it while you can. I think the high end of rewards will bear nerfed soon.
---
hah, gay jokes!
---
Who would ever wish to do so?
---
Not sayin it looks good but I kinda like it.
---
if buying XP didnt exist i would call RS3 superior to current BFA, altho that said i cant wait for classic release
---
Because it is funny to watch people get upset over nothing.
---
Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
---
Wrong opinion
---
The guy you first meet at the enchanted valley, I swear he is wearing some warlock or mage helm from wow I remember seeing the exact helm when i played.
---
This is literally the entire point of Ironman bossing, obtaining uniques. What you‚Äôre looking for is a main.
---
Veteran here, these are disgusting and this certainly should have been polled. These were legendary characters and jagex decided to just change a whole race? Updating elenas hair would have been one thing by itself but christ. These chat heads are awful and the elves look like wanna be WoW characters. I want them to revert it but understand the quest and cutscenes are all made so i suppose players like me are out of luck. I genuinely do not want to continue doing the quest, it really offends me that much. I dont want hd, we didnt vote for hd, stop trying to force hd. This has been my ted talk and thanks for your time.
---
The quick guide was perfect from when I did it around 5pm yesterday
---
Imagine being so tilted by a graphical update
---
It‚Äôs such an arbitrary style change, but y‚Äôall are making some big deal out of nothing
---
&gt; When we specifically wanted it returned to the 12 year old version because the new graphics are horrific
---
Bull shit. Bull fucking shit, and it's sad that you won't realise this is bullshit because you're at the bottom of a dead thread and you already got your confirmation updoots
---
The subreddit constantly talks about how much they would love RSHD if it was something that was possible/legal, and how much they enjoyed pre-eoc graphics. 
---
Nobody gives a FUCK about old school graphics specifically, they wanted old school because they wanted a game without EoC or microtransactions. People like newer graphics, after all, have you seen anything in any of the raids? Nothing about those graphics are "Old-school," people are only complaining about this specifically because it is changing pre-existing models, or "World of warcraft elves lul" as if the very existence of elves in this game isn't just following the standard fucking fantasy guidelines after the creation of lord of the rings
---
I was pusi slayer until I decided to tell a beggar to f off. He reported, gg
---
With that attitude, you wont. You have to go for it and believe yourself, doesnt matter how many tries. Just dont give it up and ull get the cape eventually.
---
Of those things you listed, maybe only Kurasks and Wyverns are half-decent moneymakers, and are quite limited in how you can kill them. 
---
The others aren't terrible, but they're not macro-efficient in terms of money making. You're better off powering through chromatic drags and skipping turoths until you can train slayer in a more afk or efficient fashion at the higher levels.
---
you don't even know what a meme is. You're a disgrace.
---
Delete your post.
---
What about it? It was polled and lost legitimately. Nothing about it was dramatic
---
Yea but he says hai to me. So it all evens out.
---
You won‚Äôt come close to this rate without over 90 mining.
---
Thanks for this. Didn't know farming level affected yield, thought it was just bad RNG. I'll definitely be unlocking more patches soon.
---
If you honestly think they‚Äôre not bad you‚Äôre fucking blind.
---
What are you on, it's way too late for that. Oldschool is nothing like 2007scape at this point.
---
it looks like the spoiler of a Need For Speed car
---
Thank you for making my new desktop background.
---
The problem with acb for me is triples and zuk. I do triples with bp but i waste alot of restores on that wave. This is where tbow absolutely wrecks triples. Zuk is also easy with tbow, since you can kill jad super fast and probably only do 3 sets of mage rangers. But no matter what, you just need to keep fighting and not give up till you get it, even with an acb.
---
Show this to the dude who's almost 5k dry
---
It's in the collection log so it'd be pretty fucked if it was discontinued
---
You do really good work on these models, I‚Äôm curious how long they take you? The crossbow and staff are really well done. Would love to see this stuff come into the game
---
Yeah seems like a good use of company resources.
---
Considering the private servers are getting the files illegally as Jagex's work is copyrighted and not open source, they could sue them and take them out.

&gt; "No new skill will pass because of the threshold."

&gt; "Yes but have you considered that PvM content has been passed because it is the only thing generic enough to break the ridiculous threshold?"
---
Absolutely nonsensical, and of course your flair is slayer
---
In what ways lmao?
---
You mean addictive.
---
Also, you can do non-grindy content.
---
Its not even bad looking
---
They do, they don't lose stats anymore when degrading since they're all automatically "imbued". However you don't need to imbue them anymore, but they still degrade into a seed after a certain amount of usage.
---
Yeah, whereas this was an unpolled redesign of an entire race
---
ALL HAIL KING STEVE
---
Doesnt this defeat the whole point of Ironman? Lmao
---
No, it's absolutely not.
---
&gt;I repainted mona lisa. This is my OC.

No it fucking isnt. OC implies being the first to have the idea and to put the idea to life. This is nothing but plagiarism.
---
probably need more than 10 for maxed out poh anyway
---
That's awesome man, congrats

Dense cunt

Style and pallet is fucking sick. If you have non-osrs art would love to see

????
---
It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs just this boss specifically... but every boss they add nowadays. The stuff really adds up. Throw bots into the equation and it makes gathering skills worthless to do. 
---
They could surely spice up drop tables to include ‚Äòpieces‚Äô of loot that stack together for better rewards. This adds variety to the table without the constant resource feed. That‚Äôs just one idea off of the top of my head.
---
A random creative idea I just thought of would be to add boss specific untradeables that are slightly better versions of loot. Possibly something like a type of bone that gives more prayer XP. (Really the untradeable unique ideas are endless).
---
The untradeable items would reward the player for doing the boss themselves. It incentivizes the player to do the boss more. It doesn‚Äôt devalue anything - because in the time spent killing the boss you could have gathered more bones (or whatever else it is) elsewhere. It‚Äôs a nice bonus for your hard work and effort. 
---
These are small ideas, but in the grand scheme of things would be way better than just throwing rune bars as a drop and calling it a day without thinking of the consequences.!
---
Money! Alchables! There is literally zero drawback to this!
---
...wait.
---

To be fair Ireland in ck2 is a really good tutorial island, but nowhere near as good as the og tutorial island

Imagine thinking I like rs3 just because I voted yes to warding. You need to go back to your insane asylum. You're a complete fucking idiot.
---
Dude literally knew they wouldn't stack, kept going, then complained they dont stack. Guy is a total brainlet.
---
Thanks buddy: bradbishopcreation.com
---
Imo the only real issue with the new update graphics is that the new chat heads are fairly longer than the previous ones, and its blatent they're having a conversation.  They should adjust it to at least be even.  
---
Oh and the brand spanking new house in West ardy that is significantly cleaner, nothing to see here folks no secret base or anything.
---
Yes
---
Great, I love that they are trying to get some gold out of the game! More of this please
---
unplayable
---
The only bad thing is how bad the performance is in there
---
dig in the prif onion patch
---
Well done man! I'd never compare your gear/achievements to someone else. 
---
I found that's how I burnt myself out when I originally played, I was always rushing trying to keep up with friends, this time around since I'm practically on a fresh start I'm taking things slower and just doing what I want to do when I feel like it and my enjoyment of the game has increased dramatically.
---
So what's your next goal?
---
Psssst.... You do realise that a lot of different people play this game and have differing opinions, right?
---
F
---
This is incorrect advice. If you eat after crumbling you lose attack ticks, you have plenty of time to eat before and then crumble even if you accidentally fire a shot as vorkath freezes. This way you lose no attack ticks. 
---
It's a small optimization so if you're constantly getting hit by the scorpion I guess eat after but it is technically speaking slightly better to eat before.
---
&gt;"No new skill will pass because of the threshold."
---
Not what the first guy said, but alright
---
If you don't hear back in a few years that's normal.
---
Ok now this is just fucking false. This narrative of her hating OSRS art style is based on 1 tweet taken out of context. In the tweet she was talking about a specific character which actually looked stupid. She has NEVER said she hated the whole OSRS art style.
---
I don't like the new characters either but come on, stop putting words in her mouth.
---
I won‚Äôt do a quest until slayermusiq has put out a guide. Owe him my quest cape. Rly is a legend

It just happens sometimes. I'm 99 farming and still get 5 herbs sometimes.
---
I can't wait for the MTX and buyable XP lamps.
---
yeah thats gonna be a triple yikers from me dawg
---
You're the only reason I didnt ragequit that light puzzle. Thank you.
---
ill give you 11 hours, final offer
---
When they can't fix authenticator delay..
---
You can turn off that text in your settings. So it will appear normal
---
Except it's the opposite?
---
Final puzzle has 22mirrors 6 crystals i think, have fun
---
Triples are doable just fine without using any brews. You should only use about a restore tops on triples. Jad is also not a problem for zuk so much as just the overall fight taking a long time- the zuk jad part specifically though isn't bad.
---
Clicking to move on the minimap rather than on the ground can auto-path around some traps if I remember correctly...

I lost 10 hallys and 10 bows, got the seeds back but not the money? I paid a few mil for each and now all that gold is gone and they're full price for me again too, so stupid.

these are the same people that think giving the government control over healthcare/housing is a good idea

I managed to get all four, thankfully.

crystal shards for the armor? helllooooooooo

some people don‚Äôt need it done on the first day enough to justify following extremely early rough drafts, painstakingly rushed info and constant refreshes.

Did you give up halfway or why is the minimap border in the middle?

It is a big deal in this case because with Ultracompost, the minimum is SIX:  [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ultracompost](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ultracompost)

Try actually learning stuff instead of brute forcing the lower waves
---
Bro shut up, this is getting so old so fast with these posts
---
Even so, she doesn‚Äôt need to say it, the work speaks for itself
---
This needs to be polled
---
11$?!
---
Reddit experience requiem.
---
I see where you're coming from but I don't know about this one (and in general polls targeted only towards pvpers, pvmers, skillers, etc). This would likely reduce the number of votes considerably, and though person X might not be a skiller, in my opinion they should still have a say on skilling content. They might change their playstyle or make a new account later on, or perhaps the changes to something they don't currently do would incentivize them to do that activity.
---
There‚Äôs a final boss but imo not as hard as ds2
---
They will probably explore ways to make crystal stuff stack. Probz working on it now because it really makes no sense to make something worse in a regard. 
---
Probs will not get change to faces, they suck but think they got to much pride invested in it now.
---
There was also one where patrick said "item dissolving"

Pretty sure it's a B0aty thing about his luck of something... Not sure I don't keep up with the streamers, but I recall a while back it trending in this sub, and having to ask.

There are no level 3 goblins in Lumbridge

i dont feel so good

Incel detected.

Yeah kinda sad bow easily overlooked that was. CULTURISE PEOPLE /s

Ughhh

Dragonstone armour
---
He got KOed by a 73 ags spec by skill specs
---
Did he say it was a bad thing?
---
Oh I vaguely remember that yeah, thanks
---
The library puzzle will test your desire to play the game but other than that it was a great quest!
---
If one herb is breaking the bank for you, you might want to look into alternative moneymakers.
---
Perhaps my satire wasn't clear enough.
---
I'm sure they'll fix it of course. I am rather concerned about the art direction we've seen over the past few updates (my opinion of course). It seems to appear more refined with smooth animation, which in my opinion isn't completely loyal to the original game aesthetic.
---
That's subjective tho of course
---
Nice to see that mechanic back. Good ol nomad
---
Oh. I thought it was supposed to be a good number.
---
This is honestly my favourite work i have seen so far on this subreddit, I'm going to use it as my background!
---
&gt;Second from the right
---
Thanks doc.
---
Lol what?  So we‚Äôre not allowed to dislike the work now because she‚Äôs female?  She could be a male or a female or a space person with 5 different sets of genitals, the new art would still look out of place
---
I just tried this and it works a lot better now. I get about 40-41 fps in prif and 50 everywhere else. Thanks alot!!
---
Hahahaha this is a good meme
---
From what I've seen it does up to 98% of your max hp or something like that. It is also probably like most attacks where it can't hit over your current hp. Damage is calculated when the projectile is launched so let's say you are sitting at 70hp, projectile launches, you eat before it hits you. you now have 90hp but it calculated to do your full hp at the time (70) then you only take 70 damage.
---
Yeah found out that they dont do returns and yea it sucks.  Anyways im not gonna cry about this like most of ppl think immediatly when you ask them normal question. Just feels weird and unfair that your works from whole week can be deleted just like that and everybodys will be like, "meh cant do nada nub" :D Stillg ot over 500m bank ill get over this lmao. But yea ofc im gonna message jagex about this helps or not. Maybe in future some other nub doesnt loose hes shit :P
---
Lol I seen this earlier still don‚Äôt know what to think about it though...
---
I Just did the quest after dying to that attack twice. 
---
follow the wiki guide.
---
Trick is not to care about your health at all during her 1st 3 specials. Then as soon as she does the healing pillars attack, kill them and brew over max health. As soon as she hits you, do 2x dose brew 2x dose super restore. Then repeat. Dps should be focus during attack 1-3.
---
Honestly use the wiki guide. Got me through it!
---
Bosses requiring overheal is not a fun mechanic..
---
You're completely missing the point but okay
---
Ok tyvm
---
They'll definitely fix it considering the outcry.
---
Sorry but you've lost the DWH. It's not a bug as such it's known about and people have been warned enough times about the roll back. Unfortunately there is nothing you or jagex can do about it. I wish you better luck in your future endeavours!
---
Thank you for actually understanding my point.
---
Unironic petition to open up a server for 08-12, if people want to play that shit version of runescape so be it.
---
Castle wars, clan wars, dueling for fun, fight pits, nearly every mini game that doesn‚Äôt offer a ‚Äúuseful‚Äù reward (I.e. fighter torso) is dead because of the dominate mindset of efficiency.
---
REEEEEEE I'm getting 7k less per run! Jagex needs to drop everything and fix this!
---
Best girl ?
---
I also had the issue where if I wasn't fast enough, or had bad luck mining the rocks I wouldn't do any damage to her shield and wouldn't get a drop at all.
---
"*Not only is it* x, but x bad thing"  implies it is.
---
"It may be a gold sink, but my bank space is being punished" is much clearer
---
When he was doing 27-29 Hunter with baby imps he mentioned that he's going to get people to help him scout.
---
I like new elena
---
Sorry what? 
---
The warning doesn‚Äôt say to bank everything. The warning doesn‚Äôt even say to log off. It just says the server will log you off auto at that point.
---
During the last rollback fiasco (twisted bow), people who were disadvantaged got their items back.
---
Which further proves my case against a nerf
---
I can hear "Shooting stars" meme here. Quick, someone make a video.

Felt cute, might delete later x

Imagine having this mindset and being an osrs player. There are so many unfun grinds you have to do, why play at all if you think that way?
---
Hey Steve I messed up and botted some flax while mad on "arrow pumped" when I was mad at the game to get banned. Any chance I could be unbanned? I promise it was flax, if ya don't mind having a look id really appreciate it...
---
I was in the same osrs facebook groupüíô RIP doggo
---
Haha. I like this one.
---
Keep leaving useless replies
---
We‚Äôre not RS3.
---
Just casually mining with the rarest item in game, nbd.
---
I'm 80 hp 81 magic and it took me 3 tries of running out of supplies before switching to a trident and bringing darts for the healers, then it went smoothly. Only drank brew just before and after the big hits.
---
Aw don't give him his stuff back
---
Should have delayed Priffdnas' release then, and add a crystal cow field.
---
Imagine being this much of a baby over respawn pints in a 20 year old point and click game.
---
To make it gender specific? Ugh, I‚Äôd rather the game already know my gender and implement it into the dialogue so there‚Äôs no confusion. It‚Äôs a story linking the character not my personal history.
---
Otherwise the text is so difficult to read.
---
Same here! I will still watch and follow Slayermusiq1's guide but I'll read the quest text this time to try and understand the story rather than space-skip.
---
I got kind of used to these weird as hell chatheads in RS2. I still like old one better but I don't think it's that bad. I still think it's weird how they didn't redo her parent's chatheads or art style but messed with Elena, that's far worse in my opinion, since you have to deal with all of them in the quest and it's incredibly jarring.
---
It's ok to admit you're afraid of new content
---
The game changes.
---
ONce zulrah /G.E cam out it was over.
---
that being said I think your looking at it wrong. I view this game is a re-imagining of 2007 or a really awesome private server. I feel for all of the people who are always against updates because the game loses some "nostalgia" for them.
---
iIyou still somehow have nostalgia still props to you. Mine died in 2015 and i quit for 3 years. came back not to long ago, with a different view. granted I don't play nearly as much as I did because honestly the game isn't that much fun with all the OP shit.
---
Because this was not in the poll, it does not seem intentional. I guess it will be fixed in the next update.
---
&gt; with nearly every texture, map square, character, etc. receiving a more detailed look
---
Right from your source
---
12 brews, 4 stamina‚Äôs at bottom of inv, full graceful and d pick, 
---
death dot on the mining spots to dodge falling boulders, 
---
use on furnace then run across and rc it, 
---
stand on blue circles if you can and throw at zulcano then mine the boss
---
Run away before he stands up and mine more.. 
---
move before he destroys the mining spot,
---
Rinse and repeat
---
Gl trying to dodge orange floor.. pathing makes it impossible most of the time
---
Well fuck stop the presses let's do a rollback
---
For melee in NMZ i need to buy
---
Obby plate, legs, helm, and sword with a zerker necklace.
---
Do I need the obby shield or can I use dragon defender?
---
What's with the weird looking capes weve been getting recently? Theres also that red and yellow one that pops out of your back.
---
It's time.
---
Massive gratz, got mine on the 1st try too. Enjoy it :)
---
It's a fairly braindead game and chill
---
WE ARE NOT THEM!

---
The stats requirements for the quest is way too low, 70 is a joke, should be 85+, preferably 90
---
Top quality!
---
Thank you!
---
Those were decent tho
---
People flipped hard, don't know if you were here back then.
---
Most clans want you to have atleast 25 of them at all times.
---
Now I play the waiting game.
---
Ur right, they should go and update all the rest in the game too
---
Re-Poll sailing so I can rename my character to ‚ÄúThe Big Boat‚Äù.
---
Mod Ash said they won't
---
hahaha yess
---
Your character runs north/south first before pathing east to west
---
&gt; everyone
---
Classic reddit arrogance
---
Right, lets ignore the fact SotE is an amazing, story driven and epic finale. Instead lets *all* focus on chatheads and nitpick the elves' fashion sense
---
The community is being very obnoxious and disrespectful imo. We get it the chatheads are too high poly.. design team will touch them up
---
&gt; This is a complete redesign of an entire race of the game
---
Old Elf models just got genocide'd no big deal
---
It‚Äôs not like the game is suffering and is losing players.
---
Welp just be happy with what we got then lol it's not like we own anything in the game we just rent everything really.
---
Yeah not being able to use the teleport seed at the end was a bit of a killer
---
&gt; The polling process would take forever and it wouldn‚Äôt leave any mystery.
---
I have a large feeling that if people saw these models, it'd go as quick as the partnership poll and not even be a question that people don't want it.
---
the quest was honestly much more tedious than hard, I think 160k is plenty tbh... especially with how much it unlocks
---
I think it's fine. Really can't care less and 2008 graphics are my favourite anyway. The new faces are still low poly just different proportions.
---
Seems legit.
---
Defender. Only the weapon needs to be obsidian to benefit from the armor + necklace passive.
---
Careful mate, they might call you a white knight
---
Are you saying there are absolutely no new players whatsoever coming into the game only to find Lumbridge being dead and quit shortly after the tutorial?
---
Currently that's not the case with altscape and the still growing population of new ironmen, but it's a step in the wrong direction.
---
Fire staff + 1 nat 
---
you know what to do
---
K. But they didnt even looked like elves before except long hair.
---
99/99 quality
---
Jagex has said they have no plans for the switch imo
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre either making a bunch of trips to Scorpio or taking a loss. Sorry friend.
---

---
Alright, thanks for clarifying that. I remembered seeing on the wiki that it mentioned to tick eat it, so I figured it wouldn't overhit your current hp. I just used brews on it and didn't test it myself
---
That would be so funny if the new bIS was an ak-47. Forget your blow pipe
---
Go to the bank in lletya. Theres a woman by the flax that you can go to to reclaim your shit
---

---
I got 120 coins from that. Thanks for the tip, bb.
---
It's a waste of time training everything with an obby Cape, unless if you plan on quitting soon I'd try harder to get that cape
---
Before I read this I thought it was a painting.
---
But then how would the 1250 players vote for warding? The game will die if they don't get their new skill, they have nothing left to do in game.
---
But this is the Jagex drama calendar, not the community drama calendar
---
Trident should be more than enough. Am a pre-trident iron and I did it with Flames of Zamorak + Charge and 18 brews/6 restores at 89 Magic.
---
Some guy on /r/ironscape managed to do it with blood blitz and anglers at 84 Magic, which was impressive. Nobody else has posted about being able to replicate it. The consensus seems to be that brews are very much needed for this fight though I guess if you get good healing RNG you can use blood spells.
---
Buy an occult/torm for the fight and sell it back after you're done if you need extra damage%.
---
And it should flap like it does when you're holding the barrel chest anchor.
---
But this one still looks more dated than anything added in 2008
---
IMO the lighter kinda ruins it for me, maybe change it to like a fire rune?
---
She does the 4 attacks in the same order over and over and they get stronger every rotation.
---
She starts with the move where she pulls you in, but you can just run away to avoid damage. She follows that up with the clone phase, then the healing phase, and finally the big hit phase.
---
After the last phase, she will always rotate back to the first one and do the same order
---
There are quests harder than jad
---
Fair enough I guess, I actively enjoy pvm challenges like fight caves despite their length so its never been an issue for me
---
I had my first 2-3 attempts 2 week after I started playing this game with 61 ranged, 50 defense and 43 prayer because of how eager I was to try the challenge
---
Use brews. Had 8 left after the fight and I'm not maxed
---
Right, imagine caring about a video game in 2019 like omg what are you 12 amirite
---
to hell with the rest of the icons, is that an autoclicker you naughty boy
---
You are pairing red with your yellow clothes, of course it is going to look terrible
---
shut up they look great if you don't like it go play RS classic
---
They're easy if you're a serious player but I doubt every single person on Reddit wants to grind 70 agility 70 hunter etc
---
It was busted af oh man oh my I‚Äôm talking afk 200m thieving with stupid profit

---
Even noobs like you
---
Imagine being upset over memes on r/2007scape.
---
Ah fuck I hit the pot of weeds too hard
---
Um yes there is. There‚Äôs no reason we need these terrible graphic change to osrs. It changes up the feel of the game, of actual existing content, all so Jagex can feel like they are doing something to attract the modern rpg gamer. You even admitted it looks terrible. We have every right to be pissed off. We don‚Äôt want RS3 version 2.0, that‚Äôs why plenty of us voted no to warding, yet we still get this shit forced on us. 
---
We don‚Äôt want these changes, period. Keep oldschool RuneScape old school
---
ive heard its around 54k an hour but there‚Äôs no marks of grace, not sure if theres any other incentives
---
10/10 for honesty but I'm afraid it's a no
---
yeah i would if it still existed
---
Balls of steel.
---
The very best players deal literally 3 times as much damage as the average player using the same gear. 
---
In wow you do 3 times as much damage using raid gear compared to dungeon gear
---
Rs3 also has far more actions per minute, it's base combat system is generally far more skill based. The bosses they make for it have been going down hill though
---
Finish the phase but as he‚Äôs standing up run away otherwise you‚Äôll take knockback damage.
---
Any ore you‚Äôve mined in any phase gets destroyed in the next phase..
---
If in a 10-15 man team you wanna mine like 4-5 rocks to throw in each phase .. anything more is a waste
---
It was the same with Plague's End..
---
Blessed chinchompas - req 80 ranged and 70 prayer to wield. 80 hunter to catch. Jagex poll this.
---
mod archie sure has gained
---
So the talk option thing was intentional? Wish they would just make the rates lower and allow the 1 click.
---
She also designed the crystal armor which was so bad they complained even during the sneak peek
---
That's what I mean. Broad shoulders, same hairstyle, slim waist, and killer pecks. Maybe art-style was the wrong word but again, Jagex probably weren't copying WoW and were instead inspired by it.

&gt; My biggest gripe is graceful. I hate the graceful rework. When it first came out it actually looked like it was meant to be in the game (color could have been a little better though). And now it's BIS for any activity that requires running and banking so you have the pleasure of seeing "non-oldschool" aesthetic every day all day...
---
FeelsFuckingBadMan
---
I wish the boost didn't require the FULL set all the time. Imagine if certain high agility milestones it required less pieces (75 agility you need only 5, 85 you need only 4, 95 only 3) and then maybe even paying marks for like "imbued" pieces that count as more than 1 piece for the set bonus.
---
That way, sure you might have to wear like 2-3 graceful items, but you're able to do a lot more fashionscape. I don't get why they keep releasing cosmetic shit when literally no one but GE bankstanders can even wear them.
---
Implying I can beat the regular gauntlet
---
Username checks out
---
It was 1 click and it went until you failed busted and you were given a set that when worn reduced your fail chance significantly.
---
if we're acting like the ones before this were bleeding with artistic achievement...
---
I think new style on the faces is a good move.
---
Wasnt just bonus rooms.
---
If RNG wasnt on your side, the kwy you need would be behind an impaasible door.

Forcing a reset and resucing xp tates immensely
---
Upstairs area of the Karuulm Slayer Dungeon
---
It's actually one of the best browsers
---
Pretty much this. Literally just a gold sink and I'm poor af.
---
And on top of this everyone wants them to add black graceful, but that shit is gonna be SO obnoxious once it's added.
---
Literally everyone and their brother will wear it 99% of the time. No joke, it's would turn into fucking NinjaScape in no time flat.
---
Shitty MS paint skills but you get the idea
---
I loved exploring Priff. this was the first time I've ever done a quest this major on release date, so it was really cool to see everything that is barely even documented on the wiki yet. Exploring this game in a generally unknown area is a hell of a lot more fun than reading it all on reddit/the wiki
---
If youre not sleeping or eating right, sure. Thats probably.
---
Nope
---
Well, the mod that did those posted them on twitter and asked for feedback several times in the streams. If you didn't voice yourself then, why complain now?
---
OSRS does not have double xp weekends
---
The reason they got invention is because they wanted constant bigger and better bosses and monsters that shit out more and more alchables and gold. Then they needed a way to remove all those alchables. How about the OSRS devs take a lesson from RS3 and stop fucking up the economy. Surely that would be easier and more agreeable than not making an entirely new skill.
---
Not gonna lie, I actually thought I'd never kill jad. Once I finally did, I got a 10kc in the same weekend going for the pet and I only need to bring like 1 Sara brew and like 6-8 restores now. Not sure what clicked in my brain but it's really simple now
---
No, OSRS will never have double XP weekends.
---
Weird take bro, how many people do you think actually know they were designed by a woman?
---
Okay I thought I was just crazy. Thank
---
Had to use 2 full brain cells for that one, huh?
---
Everything looked like it was made out of play-dough, what are you on about
---
&gt;Did all the people with the original vision for RuneScape's style just leave Jagex, and since almost all other MMO's have that high fantasy style, newer employees are only familiar with that?
---
Yes, actually. You hit the nail on the head exactly.
---
It is not more gp/hr than vorkath.

---
Don't you know there is no f7 key on Jagex keyboards? Give them a break
---
What's the end goal in a fight like that, do you just keep going until one side runs out of sets? Or like gets bored? How do you determine a winner
---
The skilling outfits for WC and fishing aren't even worth the effort to get in the time they save for just getting 99. It more comes down to people overestimating how useful they are.
---
Guess I need to make a compilation of the hundreds of dialogues that have terrible sentence structure, too. I got downvoted brutally for pointing it out even though it's extremely obvious.
---
Did not know you guys did this. Thats awesome!

But can you low alch it tho?
---
Oh no being able to make 3 mil/hour after completing several annoyingly long quests, and only in groups which will probably diminish as the novelty and pet hunters are finished.
---
Lemme flex the blade real quick
---
Oh damn yikes. Sounds really hard lol
---
&gt;Jagex shouldnt do dumb shit without first informing the players.

It's their game, they do whatever they want. Heck, they can remove polling if they wanted and you can't do shit about it other than quit.

---
The protected item screen does indeed mean nothing. Runelite has a nice plugin that fixes it if you're using that.
---
So yes, you'll keep your void outside of the wilderness as it is untradable + your 3 most valuable items.
---
after you take her down with the ores and you start mining her. If you see a +35xp thats 1 hit. +70 is a double hit.
---
Perhaps they're gay?
---
He‚Äôs a wiki mod. Not a JMod.

Imagine thinking sailing will ever pass
---
Would still be nice if they didn't actually exist though
---
Lol @ pretty low requirements. For those few hours a week I play they are relatively high.
---
While I can not argue culture wise that night elves are dark elves their design Id argue is influenced by drow from DnD.  We are really only concerned with the choice of purple here bc body shape is just generic elf.  Drow are typically dark or pale skinned but a lot of them have been interpeted to have purple or blueish tinted skin.  It is hard to say of this is influenced by wow but many people interpret "dark skin" to have hints of purple.  Even Drizzt the most well know Drow can be seen with hints of purple in some artwork but maybe thats just my colorblind eyes seeing what I want.
---
I feel like a lot of the lower level dart smithers doing it for money may still be at vwest but the higher level sweaties will prob transition over to prif soon enough
---
Yeah I can understand that
---
I think its silly to be scared of the difficulty but if its just about not wanting to invest the time then thats totally fine, different people set different goals for themselves after all
---
i think they hired her as eye candy rather than her ability to design osrs models
---
I had a crystal bow 9/10 (i), do I have to pay to get it back? I realize it won‚Äôt have an imbue
---
Expecting a bit much mate ;)
---
The game I've been obsessed with for 15 years has been ruined by 0.5% yeah
---
Reward for quest: ability to become dragonborn
---
Tbf I actually love a lot of the RS3 content from recent years.
---
It obviously needs balance but player-owner-farms and big game hunter are both a ton of fun imo. Invention is a great item sink with rewards that are good for that version of the game.
---
It‚Äôs been years but ports scrapes the surface of what sailing could be and is a cool concept.
---
Land out of time is an amazingly huge new area and integrates things like agility in a cool way to get around
---
Finally the mining/smithing rework just makes too much sense. The game correctly has tier 1-90 stuff and with the inclusion of skills going to 120 it‚Äôs a good balance of being able to make good armor but not the best. 
---
Stone spirits replacing ore drops from monsters helps the skillers while still being an alright drop from monsters. If you don‚Äôt know what these are, pvmers don‚Äôt get ore drops anymore, they get ‚Äústone spirits‚Äù so when people are mining and they have these spirits in their inventory they can get 2 ore per successful swing. So the miners fully control the ore market
---
Well tbh we're just talking about osrs which is 6 years old
---
Usually one side will call it off when they feel like they can‚Äôt continue. Sometimes a team will be able to transition rapidly through piles at one point and get 10 kills in a minute or catch the other team in few barrage piles to swing the fight. Fights like those aren‚Äôt about the loot, they‚Äôre about asserting dominance
---
well also actual discussion of the quest usually has spoilers and its only been a day so many people havent had time to do it yet, so those posts probly wont get as many upvotes
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a nice account regardless of virtual levels. Guy must have an axe to grind.
---
Demonic gorillas first imo. They ugly cute like a bulldog or a pug
---
We really do live in a society.
---
sadly yes, all crystal equipment that had a little bit of wear became a crystal seed
---
Lumber outfit takes like 20mins..
---
And risk being attacked by Dr Robotnik/Egghead constantly? I think not! Already have a tough enough time with the dark wizards outside varrock.
---
Says the guy who's never been treated in any of those countries :')
---
Using Grindr to get people for Shield of Arrav. 
---
That‚Äôs smart
---
Probably thinking of Memory Yak, an ex dk rat
---
I'm saying this is just a temporary solution, just until you finish leveling up to a higher level
---
Did you vote yes or no to warding ?
---
Heading to the wild to let them know I lee that fucking T H A N G on me
---
say that to mcdonalds freak
---
Ehhhhhh. Not really. They spent months asking the community what they wanted with the skill and adjusted ***a ton*** of its content to fit the demands of the community. And the community voted no. They put in a good amount of effort trying to cater to us, and it still didnt pass, just before a huge update happened that opened a new area and finished a grandmaster quest line. I honestly dont expect that kind of effort for a whil
---
&gt;right away
---
You realize she's been with jagex for like 8 months right?
---
&gt;they aren't willing to fix
---
She is though https://twitter.com/Geeeeeeee/status/1154739967748378624?s=20
---
Yes.
---
You get 20 xp though so this is entirely pointless
---
i imagine working in the video game industry is complete and total ass, they eat a lot of shit by just doing their job
---
Are you a mod?
---
no, crystal equipment doesn't degrade no more
---
wheres the pet?? /s
---
Uhh sometimes I get +70 without varrock plate 4
---
You get crystal shards
---
Thanks I managed to do it using this technique. Still have trouble with the boss itself but im getting better.
---
Still cost money to turn it into weapons
---
And then the game dies. The end.
---
They gotta cater to ironman content creators so they can get free advertising.
---
Everyone has the right to do whatever they so please, as long as they're willing to deal with the consequences.
---
Doing a bunch of if statements would be retarded, yes. That's why no one in their right mind who writes games with a lot of dialogue with varying pronouns does it like that.
---
They should already have systems in place for that, though. You should be able to write something like `"And then [he] plunged [his] dagger into his leg."` and if the player is a woman, it'll automatically convert those to `"And then she plunged her dagger into his leg."` without any bigger problems.
---
If they by chance *don't* have a system in place for it, they should build one ASAP instead of pussyfooting around it. It adds more polish and sounds a hell of a lot more natural than someone you've supposedly been with for this long epic journey who apparently doesn't even know what gender you are.
---
I've gotten double hits in full graceful then. I do have the diary, just wasn't wearing the armour. Maybe that's what can cause it?
---
But that's because they have different values fir loot amount or something right?
---
&gt;millennial buzz words
---
Lmfao
---
Way better than hearing people complain nonstop about shit they add/ want to add on reddit.
---
well runelite+ and lyzrdlite are being played on daily without much risk. If the client only has visual modifications they shouldn't ban you
---
Oh god oh fuck not the Minecraft porn
---
I totally missed the other apps first time.
---
Ngl I really didnt like the arm swaying looking slightly up character models of HD
---
Yeah you need to learn some mechanics. Imo the most important thing is to learn the timing to not get melee'd when running through him to dodge tornadoes
---
One of them was partially related to Tobey.  Ted Raimi, the guy who plays Hoffman is Sam Raimi's (director) brother.
---
Wait (sorry, still a returning noob) there's a new dugeoneering minigame? Where?
---
Not really, no other companies let their playerbase control and manipulate the game like this.
---
Present Jmods are just paying for fuckups of previous jmods.
---
Hey mod Stevew I lost a very sentimental name in a similar fashion by trying to name transfer my name to my main account and was taken by some level 3 I assume is a bot. (it has no stats) 
---
It would mean the world to me if you could please just restore the name back to the original account before the lvl 3 bot or whatever took the name. I can pm any account details needed sir and this would really cheer me up during some tough times I've been having.
---
POLL POLL POLL POLL EVERYTHING POLL IN MY ASE
---
Yeah it has very little to do with difficulty, the hardest part is dealing with the healers. The time is the worst. If I could just go back to jad without having to go through an hour of waiting I‚Äôd have 100 capes by now
---
The only thing I could think during that cutscene was "WHY ARE THEY PURPLE???"
---
Why did you have so many to start with
---
I still have to look at the abomination that Liliwen has become every day when I check my tree
---
Come to Sweden (where I live, incidentally) and wait for years to get sub-par care and talk shit after that, will ya? Socialism is hell.
---
This needs NERFING asap
---
What a cool looking blade
---
&gt;This doesn't change anything in the game
---
The art is changed. It literally does change something in the game.
---
It's from yday, they spiked to 10k i believe after everyone needed it for the new quest.
---
&gt; The chatheads are awful but I agree with reducing the threshold to 66.666%, there's no way anything big passes these days with the player count being so much higher. 
---
Nice joke
---
Hey polls aren't passing, so let's just lower the threshold to make them pass
---
Yeah that's a good idea
---
Said no one ever
---
Better than dying because the healthcare is shit.
---
Off my nuts, nerd
---
Have you tried manually taking a mirror off not using the lever?
---
If there are other new chatheads you don't like then let them know on twitter/discord.
---
can't wait to get 70 agility in like 3 months and check it out
---
Stole this comment just now
---
&gt;All crystal shields were converted into crystal weapon shards, and players were able to go refund their shards for shields at no charge. That‚Äôs not a huge issue; however, so multi fights can last for hours and if you are being camped you could die 40 times. Now, unless you are able to sacrifice more bank spaces for shields, you will be punished and have less defensive bonuses on returns
---
I have a bad feeling they will just ignore it, not care and move on to other things.
---
You don't have to pay. The elf who makes them for you will tell you that you are owed whatever crystal weapons/shields you had, and will make them for free with a weapon seed.
---
where‚Äôs the stats for people buying crowns tho
---
this is real though, people like that exist. I was talking to someone at work whos parents just bought her a brand new car. (not new to her, brand new off the lot)
---
She was complaining about having to pay for her own gas. This is after she's said "I don't even need this job"
---
Did anyone else struggle with that final boss? God damn the damage you need is so tight I had half a brew and 1 restore left when I finally killed it.
---
When did they hire Karthus?
---
How do you move your cursor? Sorry if it's obvious and I'm just dumb
---
Sounds good. My only concern is polling 3 options could cause votes to be split between them. For example, if current gets 40%, old gets 30%, and proposed gets 30%, it should be clear that the more players prefer an older style than the current style even if current had more votes and if you polled only current and proposed, proposed would likely have surpassed current.
---
Also, I am glad to see the Agility Course received an update so early on. Same for the Shards; they are currently way too low from most activities given how many are needed to upkeep the items (e.g. 8 per hour from Agility, 8 from a Crystal Tree, or like 10~ per hour thieving with rogue).
---
I stopped wearing those. If I went for 99 with it on, it only saves me a few hours of skilling anyway. It's good if you're going for post 99 though.
---
&gt; Song of the Elves - Day One Report
---
All I want to know is how many people have bought the 250m crystal crown?
---
No you gotta roofie him first you amateur.
---
Bless up
---
I don‚Äôt bother making t2 armor, I rush t2 weapons while gathering pretty much anything I pass by with about 20 fish being enough for boss and going back to t3 monsters ASAP, sometimes I even kill t2 monsters without a t1 weapon for lots of shards, average about 8 minute completions.
---
 A who and a what?
---
You people are such losers lmao. Genuinely thinking I should stop playing this game because I don‚Äôt want to be associated with you pathetic basement dwellers
---
This was part of the downfall of RS3.
---
It wasn't just MTX &amp; EoC/Removal of PKing; Doubling, sometimes tripling of xp rates across the board took the satisfaction out of the grind and ruined it for a lot of people.
---
I had the wiki guide open and refreshed it occasionally and it was always updated with new stuff.
---
this looks like  dark souls boss, what is it? ninja gaiden?
---
Ah really? That must be it, I think when I did the Underground Pass quest, I was only 56 Agility so I failed a bunch. That's my memory of it, so I just assumed you failed unless you had like 85-90 Agility or something.
---
Now that's some real ironman loot right there
---
Can u sell to a high-alch store to get 150m?
---
Mf even has a notification from McDonald‚Äôs
---
This. Polling only Elena feels like a half-measure when people have voiced a lot of complaints about the design of almost all the new elves and their chatheads not being osrs-y.
---
On the flip side, there are documented cases where homophobes in Easter Europe countries will catfish gay people to come over so their homophobe friends can jump and assault/injure them
---
Yeah the steps I used said head east and reflect the light north at the next beacon. Not beacon #7 faces west. Got it all done with ease.
---
It‚Äôs definitely this and im surprised this is the first time I‚Äôve heard anyone say it.... wtf
---
yea we figured out how to get all the lights to each side but it took us a while to figure out where to put the color crystals lol.
---
Only get this because of playing smite
---
Kthxbie
---
What do you mean he‚Äôs right there
---
Really civil there my guy. Nice argument too. Should they just replace the chat heads with dongs since we're never gonna see them after the quest anyway?
---
Would you mind composing a great thread quick for us pea brains on how clicking a rock for 18 hours a day should be an e-sport and shitting your pants to skill is admirable devotion to the game?
---
Nah Herblore is ezscape these days with Farming Contracts. I nearly doubled my XP (by getting 7 levels) just from one month of farming whatever I got from contracts. It's actually insane.
---
Yea I guess there are other sources of brews for sure but might as well go get brews since it is necessary down the line for other places like GWD/inferno.
---
The whole fight was a brew sipping and safing simulator. You only need a good dps, which means a trident with occult, and mage boosting gear like the heart or mage pots. Fire surge in damage boosting gear should also work. Then full inv of brews and restores.
---
 All the other damage she does is very marginal compared to that one attack. For this reason, having high dps with brews is the key to winning easily.
---
I disagree with your opinion that this is copying WoW. Dark and light coloured elves have literally existed in fiction since Norse mythology with D√∂kk√°lfar and Lj√≥s√°lfar. They have also since been used in various popular Fantasy books and games, including The Elder Scrolls and Dungeons and Dragons to name a couple.
---
All aboard the karma train
---
The real question
---
That proposed chathead looks much, much better - and I'm even someone who defended the new one. Will definitely be voting for it, it's a clear improvement on the original.
---
Hopefully people actually look at the images before voting, that new one definitely deserves to be in.
---
It also makes a lot clearer that a fairly large part of the issue was how grey the eyes were.
---
Here I am with 50kc and only seen 1 purple.
---
Would you be able to explain the rationale behind buffing the Agility course xp/h? It was [polled at 62k xp/h at lvl 90](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/song-of-the-elves-poll-blog-ii?oldschool=1), why the increase after only one day? Given Ardougne, a level 90 course, is slightly above 62k/h, this would make Priff the better course with a 75 Agility requirement, not even factoring the shards and the shortcuts.
---
don't give spite voters any ideas
---
Ah yes. Chatheads. The game is shit now
---
They should just revamp all of the graphics and give those of us who don‚Äôt like it a toggle to turn it off.
---
Is he a gnoblin ?
---
I only did gauntlet once and i just ran around and died to the boss after 10 minutes lol. Looks really fun though, I'm trying out all the new stuff a little bit today.
---
Doh. Pretty sure I knew that and it didn't even occur to me. Thanks for pointing it out. =)
---
I agree idk what it is but I absolutely despise over the top fantasy shit. I really enjoy the minimalistic style of oldschool
---
Thank you for keeping the overall integrity after all these years. Been giving  a few per month and will continue to do so.
---
You can't alch it
---
I agree. I always thought they looked awful. Trimmed Armour sets were always subtle. But today it's just crazy. Like the dragon pickaxe lol wtf is that. I also hate how they changed the seamen staff for no reason other than it had the same appearance as something else. Looks like an rs3 pole of shit
---
It was intentional in the sense that the aesthetic was more dungeons and dragons and less WoW. Just look at the dudes who made the game, absolute boardgamers.
---
it doesn‚Äôt give that xp rate at 75, it scales pretty hard on your agility lv
---
Out of curiosity, how did you learn to do landscapes?  Looks beautiful
---
I agree. She should've had more attacks that would also have been dangerous. Such a boring boss design mechanically
---
Ah - you saw right through us. We'll have to go even more subliminal next time.
---
Well poll question 3 is worded rather poorly lol
---
You don't like on grindr
---
I think the more flamboyant stuff is just mostly to deal with the non-human races, which honestly makes more sense to me. Look at the gnomes. They ride around on fucking turtles and large birds that aren't found anywhere else in the game. Their outfits might not be as "edgy" as this new art style, but it differentiates it from the humans. 
---
Elves were barely discernable from the humans, other than the pointy ears. This update gives them a more unique look that signifies you're no longer in a human area, but that of elves which in nearly all fantasy writing has inspired awe in those who witness it. 
---
I know Zeah has a much different art style than the rest of Gelinor too, due to advancements in graphics from Jagex, however a similar principle applies here. Hosidious and Shayzien house both look relatively realistically medieval, and if you complain about Shayzien armour looking not medieval enough, look at Burthope, which is a similar art style, just less defined as Jagex didn't have as much technology back when Burthope was released. The pirates look just as old-school as port sarim, so nothing weird there. Arceuus? They're immortal mages. How else are they supposed to look? Lovakenj? They look like all the other dwarves, just with more detail. 
---
These graphical changes help define the different races of RuneScape. RuneScape has always been a high fantasy game (at least as long as I can remember, I started playing in 2005 or so). There is magic, dragons, ents, imps, goblins, etc... It's always been a high fantasy game. The humans all look relatively medieval to me. Other civilizations I'd expect to look different, which they do and I appreciate. 
---
Tldr; Other races should look different to humans. Please remove stick from ass.
---
Who knows at this point.
---
You joking, right...? What gear did you use?
---
So gauntlet is still not worth doing outside of pet
---
Has the ZMI US world gone? Man I cant use the german one at all without DCing
---
Can the new slayer dungeon receive some attention? The rooms either need to made smaller or add more spawns to each room as the NPCs are so spread out. Also could the Bloodvelds/Nechryaels be the ones that are in the Catacombs. For a grandmaster quest I see no reason in killing regular Bloodvelds in particular when the ones in the Catacombs offer better drops/ more afk, chance at totems and Ancient Shards. Finally I see no use in the southern shortcut in that cave.
---
My comments were at -11 and -8 respectively before making this post.
---
Only if we pay
---
There are plenty of other stats we'll share when we can (possibly on next week's Q&amp;A)! I'll see if this is one we can get - I'm fairly certain we chose to track it.
---
I have qpc wym
---
and any action? nope. The scene is dead
---
hydra too please. serpentine form‚Äôs aura can pass as a weirdly shaped shadow, but the rest just make me sad
---
Ahrims with a toxic trident, occult amulet, seers ring, book of darkness, infinity boots. I also have 78 mage. Maybe there's an easier way to kill it I just used the strategy from the wiki though.
---
&gt;RuneLite isn‚Äôt perfect :(
---
Yeah, it doesn‚Äôt track my farming cycles that well. I collect coconuts and cactus spines several times a day, and I pretty much have to time it myself. Also if I start a slayer task on mobile, RL thinks I‚Äôm still doing the last task I started on it. 
---
Other than that, RuneLite is dank af.
---
Yes, it's true and there's even videos of girls complaining about the colour of their brand new car but it's still disgusting.
---
I think you'll have to live with that senior expensive decision. 
---
Afaik you cant do anything with it
---
All stand on one tile so when the boulder falls you can move 1 spot right or left &amp; can keep mining
---
these cheap children animation are literally made by a bot/algorithm. Its gonna just grab shit and use it
---
 I dont think you understand osrs art syle, period.
---
Which other chatheads would you want to be polled? All of them or some specific ones?
---
I doubt they will be offering to change all the new models and chatheads like some players may want. But I do hope some specific ones can be addressed.
---
A few that stand out for me are the hooded long hair male elf chathead like Arianwyn. I am not sure exactly what it is, but something with the hair and hood just makes it feel off. Others like Baxtorian look fine; it might be that his is less zoomed in than the others so perhaps if more were zoomed out a bit it would help?
---
Then there is the pale purple skin if the Iorwerth clan. While I don't find it to be as bad as some players, I will admit that it feels unneeded. Given that a large part of the quest is questioning who is good and bad, having the "bad guys" be a different skin color from all the other elves kinda undermines this. Their armor would still make it clear which side they are on and what clan they belong to, so I think they could be the same skin colors as the rest of the elves instead of contrasting so much.
---
And the last things are the NPC Weapons and Armors. It seems a lot of NPCs, mainly Guards, use an alternate version of Crystal gear that looks a bit strange. Rather than giving them a different style, sky blue Crystal Halberd, why not just let them use the classic style like the players use? Same for those bright blue shields (though that may be more of a "clan shield" than a crystal shield, but it doesn't look great).
---
voted 'No' here :)
---
Celebrating with a fresh cold one from BB villiage. :)
---
A new skill can't exist coming from a shitty 2019 mindset.  Modern game designers don't think with an oldschool mindset - they think in terms of excessive power creep and "qol improvements."  Unless you have a time machine and can bring a rs dev back from 2006, I will vote 'no.'
---
I died twice due to lack of full focus. Third attempt was really easy because I knew exactly what each attack was like. As long as you make sure to read the guide carefully first it's fairly simple.
---
Talking to Edmond in the beginning of the quest he mentions ‚Äúbuisness‚Äù
---
We'll aim for early next week depending on feedback
---
5m/ea teerible prices atm
---
Damn not Liliwen

Ugly af
---
Yooo dude i just saw this post. Do you want to organize a clan war event with me?
---
My clan isnt maxed or anything but we love doing clan wars for fun.  Ususlly can get around 15-30 people to come down and play. Open to all game types too.
---
Lol really? You might be in the wrong game then bud...
---
10 shards for a crystal tree seems really low considering its 8hr growth.
---
I get its "passive" but like come on lol 
---
Though I didn't try to let it regrow or whatever and see if i could get more shards that way. I'll have to check that when this next one is done. 
---
Whats the jmods thoughts on the gauntlet after day 1? Hows it holding up?
---
And I really need that red panda as a pet. How can we make that happen?
---
Big brain money makers for F2P. Time to buy a bond and work on the stats so you can keep up membership
---
Imagine being so immature that you spam posts complaining about people making memes and criticizing bad graphical updates.
---
Can I just say that I think Zalcano is fucking fantastic. If the direction of OSRS gatherables is mobs shitting out bank notes, then the likes of Zalcano is honestly the best possible direction for it. 
---
* Thematically appropriate
---
* Rewards heavily tied to skilling requirements of the boss
---
* Not excessively mechanically challenging, but not braindead either
---
My one minor complaint is this; I think there should be a population cap on the room - mass Zalcano's seem to range from  the aforementioned braindead-ness(?) to just downright frustrating in terms of even trying to qualify for a reward. The most fun I've had with Zalcano so far has been with 4-8 players, where it becomes more of a high-effort balancing act to complete the boss efficiently. I also think the pop cap would go a way to inherently balancing the loot table, by ensuring it is a consistently high effort kill.
---
That said, I will reiterate that I really really love how you guys have gone about Zalcano, I sincerely think you've done a fantastic job.
---
When I say I don‚Äôt care about the OS graphics, what I mean is that I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre low pixel, outdated, etc. etc. Part of the charm of this game is that it‚Äôs like a blast from the past. There are almost no games with such minimal graphics and such an active playerbase. I think when people complain about the graphics, what they mean is this game doesn‚Äôt have to try to be modern. You can create ‚Äúnew content‚Äù in the art style and cut from the same cloth as the golden days of the game (04,05,06 etc.)
---
He is literally a fucking hero for doing the quest so god damn quick. All other quests this long took him like 2 weeks, specifically dragon slayer 2 if I remember correctly. The work he puts in could never be appreciated enough
---
Could poll question #3 be worded differently?  Or maybe some information on what problem the poll question aims to fix.  Details and specifications are essential when it comes to polls.
---
Are you saying that Zalcano is too easy with its increase of crystal shards at 2 times the rate of "Other activites"?  The poll would then give the community the option to either make Zalcano harder or make "other activities" (gauntlet maybe?) easier.
---
A bigger divide than Romeo and Juliet
---
I feel like if you can get to Priff you don't really need to do anything but blast furnace anymore
---
24 225 000 xp in a year from only redwood birdhouses? This madman did 13.8 birdhouse runs per day. That is insane.
---
You *can* do it. But you will definitely struggle and have to be super conservative with prayer and supplies since at 61 Ranged the RCB wont be hitting much, youll piss through prayer once the 360‚Äôs come out.

You probably have to remove the color to it to alch it

Thanks so much!
---
It's not about the chatheads, it's about instantly being called a manchild just because you see a pointless change and say "hey I kinda don't like this, can we consider changing it back". Reddit is a shithole when it comes to having actual discussions

I'd say it's like 70/30 split. Bet definitely depends on the area.
---
ü¶ÄThe community is powerless to Jagex's bullshit face modelsü¶Ä
---
I've been fixing wording to fit. Better in the context of where you're at :D you're a god send buddy
---
I agree that it's a reddit problem, but 2007scape is exceptionally toxic. I would argue it is one of the worst subreddits when it comes to toxicity.
---
If sote didn't release, what would you have done with the 250m GP?
---
I still dont think straight up nerfing it right now is needed. At least not until we have more data on the loot and how it scales with levels/strategy during the kill.
---
Im yet to try it myself since ive been at work pretty much since the quest came out, but from what ive seen it can be as low as 40k/kill. The loot tabs weve been seeing here on Reddit are most likely 99 mining/d pick, with optimal strategy
---
Yeah I‚Äôm totally with your last point. Where‚Äôs the consistency? I thought elves used crystal equipment. Not whatever that teal colored stuff they currently have.
---
No, saw someone get it yesterday. One if the first though
---
There's been quite a few already but gz
---
No sorry
---
They said they're looking into making it less laggy
---
pker man bad haha good one man
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion, but as someone who played from the start of RS2 until around 2005 I actually prefer the old "crap" assets to the new ones.
---
Picking up the same again when OSRS launched was a bit of a shock as apparently a decent amount had changed between 2004-07.
---
Not holding my breath for 2004scape though.
---
The whole point is to make them look like
---
Elves and not just random
---
NPCS
---

Hey dude my clan would love to have you. Were a decent size with a range of levels and always willing to help out.  If you join our discord we do weekly 4m giveaways to our members.  My ign is tedgridy so feel feee to shoot me a message either there or here and we can get you set up.
---
Addy plates and rune platelegs are way more chill than gold ore at bf though.
---
Yeah that consistency is insane
---
Also the pet is sick.
---
Thanks.
---
You're not even good enough to bI'LL MAKE YOU EAT THOSE WORDS
---
Im salty about warding not passing so ive become a permanent spergling spite voter
---
The gear is worth less than the crown???
---
Would be nice
---
love you too hon
---
Kill vennenatis
---
Agreed. I think the big eyes they used are pushing it, but in general the new ones look so much better. Hair actually looks normal.
---
Elena is human.
---
Daaaamn you got ripped off, mine only cost 10k
---
Brilliant.
---
This will be my revenge for warding.
---
It's not like people are protesting outside Jagex HQ for this. It's really annoying when the "why do you care so much" crowd keep exaggerating how much people really care. 
---
There's a lot of players who like the style of the game and they want it to be preserved. Is it so bad if they're vocal about it?
---
La lumbriga
---
Reminds me of the gecko pet from summoning
---
I understand that. We did show the models to the community beforehand and the response was positive but I get where you are coming from completely.
---
Interesting concept but barrows only would get boring
---
I think he meant more so "Not only is it [Factor impeding its viability], it's also [Another factor impeding its viability]". It doesn't speak of whether or not the first negative should exist, but that there is a second negative which serves no benefit.
---
What am I looking at?
---
Don‚Äôt take all legends at face value... they‚Äôre known to be a little embellished ;)
---
This is awesome. You should make a picture of this guy all grown up in max gear killing a boss. Or a guy in max gear looking back at this picture remembering when he was just a noob with a joyful tear falling from his eye.
---
Holy fuck its ugly
---
sorry, didn't want to get in an argument with the person who decides what makes games fun
---
New ones are nice
---
How many hours total?
---
2k doesn't seem reasonable at all lmao. I get the sentiment but I'm pretty sure once you get to about 1600-1700 you should have enough of an idea of the game to be able to have a say in it. No need to lock voting behind hundreds of hour of playtime
---
I don't have access to ilfeen yet, but am I correct in the assumption the crystal shields I had before the update (that were tradeable), are no longer tradeable?
---
If so, is that maybe something that should have been polled or at least mentioned in the notes? 
---
Maybe I'm wrong, thanks if anyone is able to confirm.
---
The blog post says they are going to continue monitoring the drop tables. They did not state that they made any changes as of yet.
---
&gt;this upset
---
How upset? How is he overreacting? You're acting as if he's having a meltdown over it or something. Maybe you should try saying something of substance instead of "omg why are you so upset, chill out, it's not a big deal" shit.
---
Step one: start training slayer. Step two: .. well there isn't any other step
---
To be fair, I've had three breaks from the quest so far, and I'm probably gonna go finish it off on sunday or monday.
---
Definitely not a quest I'd like to do in one sitting
---
Looks like the black version of Jim of The Office
---
Hey. Sorry. Me again.
---
Currently in the Name Changer and it still says "Name Rejected" when I try it.
---
I can understand it if the cyan is a clan color like how Iorwerth uses the purples and teal, but the cyan weapons and shield instead of crystal gear is strange.
---
Wow is the only mmo to exist amirite
---
Can‚Äôt believe you just assumed my salary üò≥
---
Invention, divination, and dungeoneering all sucked the most massive of cocks on release so take that shot elsewhere please.
---
If you play multiple accounts in the same instance of the client it will mess up like that. Are you playing multiple accounts?
---
How do you get them back at no charge?
---
I prefer mature stout dwarves.
---
Nothing new?, tried a bug report or perhaps contacting Jagex on twitter?
---
You can, but that wasn‚Äôt a requirement before the obsession over efficiency.
---
There are 3 checks and balances in our country. By your rule the minority inland population controls 2/3. How do you justify it?
---
I kept an eye on the guide throughout yesterday and I swear the limestone/limestone bricks thing changed a dozen times. I think it ended up only needing 8 limestone bricks, but at one point it was 24 limestone and 16 limestone bricks
---
Remember when Vannaka wears a 2h steel sword AND is holding a shield?
---
Gonna finish it up tonight to get my cape back, easily the best quest story (DS2 close 2nd) and I'm already looking forward to the Frem grandmaster! Great work guys!
---
I‚Äôve always been of the opinion that PVM shouldn‚Äôt bring an abundance of resources into the game, stone spirits are stackable and at least imo make mining meaningful
---
True
---
It's such a banger that the client can't handle it?
---
Shiny attack is mage (looks like Vorkath mage attack) Dark one is range.
---
She is sortta south of the poh portal I think.. the name is like ilfeen or something
---
It's a gold sink. It's not bugged. This is intended.
---
Copypasting what i wrote  
---
I find it kind of out character how Elena approves of the idea to murder the east ardougne guards so readily, guards who are probably just doing their jobs + the fact that people are willing to revolt because of some taxes lmfao  
---
Other than that the story is pretty good aside from the fact that my boi baxtorian doesnt get any poontang
---
Yeah lumberjack especially saves you around 3 hours for 99 but can easily take longer than that to get it
---
That boss fight was a snore fest NOBODY wants to replay that boss it‚Äôs not challenging it‚Äôs tedious and instead of making it challenging you just added unavoidable damage for pseudo difficulty
---
I knew it looked off when I ran in there for Roving Elves the other day. Too bad I still can't put it on my fucking key ring.
---
Don't think so. When I was doing it yesterday it seemed very random as sometimes I'd get a low amount of something and other times like 10x the amount without really doing anything differently.
---
But no f2p 99 RC... that would kill me
---
??
---
Hey I just did that a few days ago. Now I don‚Äôt know what the hell i‚Äôm supposed to be doing
---
So you're implying they're good now?
---
Rs classic sucked massive cocks on release guess osrs is still bad
---
It's second best in slot for Seren
---
The only way that happened was if a person with a high lvl in said skill left the dg party.
---
If they go as hard as RS2 did in 2008... yes. That is part of the reason for OSRS.
---
Yeah the whole first part is just "We're the fucking baddies flat out"
---
The measurement is feet not toes!
---
The intitial graphic enhancements pre eoc were actually pretty good
---
Don't @ me
---
Next time try running the poll before you change content, not afterwards. Incredibly biased way to push content.
---
Right, we should simply ignore every 'insignificant' shit update (graphical in this case) because caring about consistency is something only sweaty manchilds do
---
I was loving it yesterday with 5 people, but it's absolute dog shit today.
---
In a world with 40 or so people that will mine one rock, run north, run south, throw that rock, instakill boss, mine it, and repeat.
---
It feels like fucking agility training at this point with how the xp scaling is non-existant.
---
what do hovering over K tell you?
---
Why try to fix aomething that isn't broken and nobody complained about?
---
Better than looking like a clown threw up after eating a rainbow birthday cake and then killed himself
---
yeah its disappointing to see all posts about the character models with very little posts appreciating what an amazing quest we got. 
---
every combat seen was immersive and intense (even if easy), and the story sucked me in.
---
Can you tell us how many people have purchased the crown for 250,000,000?
---
Was my sarcasm not obvious enough, lmfao
---
Not true. Happened in most if not all of my single runs past a certain floor. Sometimes 3rd mostly 4th plus.
---
Except we're talking about the subreddit population. Not everyone has a quest cape. Also its just a game and not everyone has time for it, because you know, there are more important things in life.
---
Where can we find a link of the suggested updated heads?
---
M
---
This is an opinion poll, not a design poll. They can just choose do whatever they want after the poll ends, and 75% doesn‚Äôt matter
---
I think we've all got a different appreciation for bloodvelds
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cgxtgp/well/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cgxtgp/well/)

I'm not at the level to say for myself but aren't bloods way more afk?
---
It was but 2007scape is no more anyway :p
---
O LORD, bless this Thy hand grenade that with it Thou mayest blow Thine enemies to tiny bits, in Thy mercy.
---
That is what I'm worried about; that they'll just look at what has the most votes and go with that.
---
This is why I do new quests ironman style
---
I dont think that the artist sucks at their job or that anything looks bad (minus the dark elvs, iowerth, and airanwyn w/e). but it DOESN"T look old school.
---
Seren and her part look really good imo, but they also feel like they fit which is a big deal. Other examples are galvek, vorkath, demonic gorillas, olm, that dragonkin npc. All of those were done in a way where they feel like they fit, and they look good while doing so. I want more stuff like that
---
Excccelent.
---
Also can I get some help with the flair, on mobile not sure how to do that
---
They are, but if you still do them after unlocking souls, you're just being a bitch
---
Spoiling the new quest? smh. These ambiguous references won't work for those who haven't done the quest
---
Thats how they got 99. Making the eternals
---
Why cant there just be the old head?
---
Seems like we fundamentally disagree on what the baseline should be. I view the proposed as ‚ÄúI like newer-looking models over the old ones‚Äù and you‚Äôre arguing that proposed is ‚ÄúI like older looking models over the new ones‚Äù
---
I was really disappointed with it tbh.
---
I wasnt necessarily expecting it to be on par with Galvek, but the final boss just being "Hit her and safe over full hp" felt so shit.
---
Yeah max players aren't too bright. Watched the same guy with a max cape die 3 times before giving up.
---
This is awesome, I love OSRS artwork
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true. Based on the Reddit hive mind, I think it‚Äôs safe to say the current chathead is going to do very poorly in the poll, so it‚Äôs essentially between the old and the proposed designs now
---
Just wait till you see the weapons going for a billion haha
---
&gt;mod bean
---
lmfao
---
That moment when most things they poll are things people want, but don‚Äôt poll stuff like this

PussSlayer69's mortal enemy
---
What's different about souls except the xp/hr? I'm just now grinding for 77 so I don't really know much about Zeah RC
---
I literally just voted for you then got on Reddit to see you re-earn my vote! Love your stuff üòçüòç
---
You're only posting this because the Mod who prefers using a pixelated avi likes these cute creatures!
---
Your entire comment is summed up like this;
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Crystal stuff is cyan in rs3, so that's possibly where it came from.
---
Eh not really. Intricate designs are always favoured more. You can design a good childrens book with simple designs but if thats the bulk of your pge its not showcasing much talent.
---
You're a shit argument
---
\[colorized\]
---
same, I think my bronze defender took like 160 kills so I thought I was doing something wrong. then pretty steadily got the rest and dragon defender on 7 kills
---
They're just much better exp with less profit.
---
Please stop ruining the Rune/addy smithing metas
---
Already got fixed. See the new "SotE Day 1 Recap" blog post.
---
Lining the lights up was cake, the colored crystals were giving me a hard time with the order they had to be put in
---
Nothing happened in Ardougne. The plague has been quarantined. King Lathas has our safety in his best interests.
---
just so you know pvmers control the market, skilling is outdated
---
D2 and D3 were from different parts of blizzard, may as well not be classed as the same company.
---
Everything about the Zulcano is a super smithing buff, either the high end of its drops get slightly nerfed or ores, bars and gems may see a bit of a dip soon.
---
Bro those deals from the app come in clutch sometimes
---
Chaotic good
---
More people with 99 range the price was always going to end up dropping.
---
I fucking love this
---
Can see Auenke's signature thunder thighs too üòÇ
---
Gives me flashbacks to MEPII. How much worse was this sequel?
---
the original chad
---
Lol they nerfed it already in a hotfix just now according to the blog.
---
isnt that because there is nothing in the game that tells you what your slayer task is.  RL only knows because it was online when you started the next task.  So if you start a task on mobile or the real client, RL won't know about it
---
ahhh okay, thanks for lettin me know, are the crystal shards worth going after in comparison to marks of grace?
---
I'm about to buy chins, they are at record lows, imagine the money you could make if jagex ever does anything
---
Can you tell us how many people purchased the crystal crown?
---
Thanks so much for the support!!!!!
---
Lol! Best ending I could've imagined!
---
What are you even on about? Skillers don't skill for money
---
they price get lower the more of them you buy down to 150k each. We would make around 2m /hr each pking.
---
Yeah, I agree. I consider GWD the first major update which started this style transition back in 2007.
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the point, still over 100$ lmao
---
you are thinking Western euro (Scandinavia mostly).
---
Eastern is yeehaw in their ways of thinking.
---
ily

I literally haven't seen a single soul talk about this, what are you on about?
---
&gt; McChicken sauce
---
Mayonaise?
---
Source: Used to work at Mcdonald's.
---
Wait do you work for Jagex then or how did it make it into the game?
---
Incorporating multiple skills for the creation of an item? Nah, we need an entirely separate skill for that.
---
you alright there pal
---
I can understand if you did not mean to sound aggressive, but read it again tomorrow you'll see it is a mean comment.
---
My clan was looking to recruit a lot of people but yeah most people carried around 50. But if you die like 10 times in a war just come back in rag lol
---
The crystal system works differently now, you get regenerate what was replaced in your bank for free. Check out the update blog, it goes a little bit more in-depth.
---
I didn't lag idk what people are talking about
---
With a map it's probably very doable, without one it took me 7 hours to solve
---
Chatheads are the most dated thing about this game. These look so much better, making them discernible elves.
---
Easy fella
---
Rune dragons, or Skeletal Wyvern alts are pretty good. I only have one Alt I use for Rune Dragons if I'm not using it for anything else. It's pretty easy to afk rune dragons in justicar and dfs and it's about 1m an hour in regular drops. Super easy to do other things on my main like bossing DKs or other slayer bosses. I know some of the more no life player base though typically uses 3 at wyverns or rune dragons.
---
People like you vote in the polls... sigh. Lol
---
Very good, but that little butter knife isn't going to protect you much. Here, take these.
---
make it max cash stack and I would vote yes, only the elite should be allowed to flex this piece of equipment.
---
It‚Äôs a 6 hour grandmaster quest, I would hope your noob ass couldn‚Äôt kill it first tryn
---
Whats best?
---
When examined that‚Äôs what you get.
---
Was hitting consistent 86's when my max hp is 89, I don't think it can hit above your max hp. People say it's a bad mechanic but I think the point is more to make sure that you're killing her fast enough and you can't just dodge for 10 minutes and make *very* little progress. It's also nigh impossible to cheese her like you can other bosses (Glough)
---
You have a slow HP drain with a massive hit at the end of each cycle, meaning you only have X cycles before she starves you out
---
Some people on youtube have speculated that rewards are based on an invisible MVP/point system like Raids.
---
Obviously not confirmed, but could explain the big variance in rewards
---
not nerfed yet your impact is just 0 so u get about 0.
---
I like Rats IRL, they make awesome pets. I'm sad now, can you do something a little happier for next time? Please?
---
looks great man, what kind of software do you use to draw these?
---
Nice rune scimitar, thanks for the account.

People been buying stupid shit for decades, like actually paying live savik√§ngs and stuff just to get a sword in dead game

Dude weed lmao

What is your sample size though? Coincidences like this occurs all the time in an rng environment.
---
Hey, you're the one who jumped straight to responding to a perfectly reasonable comment with "Calm your inner man child down" so might as well ree a bit
---
&gt; everyone‚Äôs opinion on what is ‚Äòold school‚Äô varies person to person, regardless of background.
---
No kidding. I was just a kid in 2007 and only got to experience so much of it before I had to grow up with post-HD RS2, yet I've come to form some conservative opinions on the game's visuals.
---
For instance, a fresh and new one at that, the dragonstone armor. I personally consider it *sacred* that no armor in OSRS should have random gems or glowing lights no matter the reasoning... You can imagine my shock when I found out you went and chucked something just like that into the game.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
I do mostly like your environments, but my tastes just don't allow me to appreciate your equipment designs as consistently.
---
Procreate on an iPad Pro
---
The change itself should have been polled
---
Deliberate :-)
---
It's actually very useful for Turael skipping
---
Something about clearing out entire areas of mobs without them respawning is super satisfying
---
Felt the same way about Shayzien
---
If Slayer had like "extermination" tasks of some kind I'd fucking orgasm
---
Didn‚Äôt think I needed the /s but whatevs
---
Bombing seems to be the most important part, in my experience today. Maximizing damage during that phase is really what set aside different player's drops.
---
Well you start talking to lowest slayer master, take task from him and do it.. then repeat when u Can go to another slayer master, you can spicy things up trying Konar
---
incredible, what an amazing achievement /r/2007scape just accomplished
---
No worries, back off to the mine I go!
---
Nice scam
---
Using the explorers ring alch most likely just calls a universal high alch method. So it would most likely work the same.
---
The nostalgia is strong with this one..
---
OOTL what does this item do, how do you get it and why is it so expensive?

World 415 (2,200+ total) has people die all the time. Myself included lol. It‚Äôs not the most mobile friendly boss when you‚Äôre trying to path in between those red spots on the floor :(
---
you mean to tell me the music player in RS is actively playing the music from a set of instructions rather than just loading up an OGG or something similar and playing it back?  
---
I guess that explains why the client download is so small but jesus
---
Legal right I suppose but it still comes down to you can do whatever you want in life as long as you're willing to deal with the consequences.  That's more so what I'm referring to.  I can stab someone, doesnt make it right  but I did it and now I'm gonna have to go to jail.  Even if someone prevented me from stabbing said person, I still attempted to stab them and the only thing that stopped me was someone else.  Laws are subject to change all the time so clearly it isnt set in stone what's right and wrong.  Take abortion for example, if a woman aborts her child in a legal state, is she now wrong to have done so wherever else it's illegal?  No because laws arent universal.
---
Agree hundred percent
---
This is gold
---
Hardware is irrelevant it‚Äôs the engine
---
He has connections to jmods
---
No.
---
In talking about having the ability to do something not a moral conviction of right and wrong lmao.
---
The outrage over this is actually ridiculous
---
&gt; Boss should NOT hit through your prayer
---
that would make the entire fight pointless, as every damage then would be avoidable.
---
Remember the dragon scim redesign in rs2?
---
Especially when she splits
---
Untill we hear otherwise I think its just hitting, what you are saying should be the case but the fact I was throwing one single orb when I was testing my theory and still getting good drops (200-350k) is kinda odd
---
What has been asked is nowhere within his purview in any capacity. Even as someone with ‚Äúconnections to jmods‚Äù.
---
Never saw the battle royale video... but I honestly enjoyed the firecape video the most
---
You guys have higher than 50 RC?
---
True, I guess I was mostly thinking of total lvl worlds
---
How can this possibly lag any machine not made in the 2000s? Is this just the most badly optimized game of our time?
---
~80kc today, focused entirely on testing this. I would not have made this post if it wasn't reliably reproducible.
---
I always wondered if you could die of you got bad luck and, if so, what would happen.
---
Someone said you needed a kyatt outfit, I spent like 30k on that shit.
---
i wouldve picked this game up alot faster if i spent my time sober, but i had more fun doing it my method.
---
These kind of pics should be getting the major upvotes.  Not that hentai neckbeard FA incel shit other posters post of npc chicks.
---
After collecting all of the emeralds sonic can turn into hyper sonic!
---
Well for best start on fresh iron you should rush 200mil fm xp at Solo Wt games for free 99 cons, fletch and wc, then rush 200 mil thiev xp at ardy knights for nice starting cash and finally grind 140 mil fish xp at barb fish for free 99 agi and str.
---
No clue but if I had to guess rune dragons with lance and justiciar I hear is good profit and super afk, tho ds2 is a heavy req for an alt account, let alone 3.
---
Might be some other afk pvm. Could maybe be triple blood crafting but 77 rcing on 3 alts sounds like a pain compared to afk nmzing 3 alts to max combat and then pvming.
---
Yep
---
I disagree on most points here. I'll agree they may have modelled the elves off of WoW elves, however I think they needed a definite graphical update because honestly I hated going to Tirannwn because of how boring the elves were. Lleyta is kind of nice due to the wood design, but the elves themselves don't look much different from the rest of the game. There are slight differences yes, but think about how elves are portrayed in almost all fantasy of any kind. They look like Robin Hood lost some weight and got slightly taller. The only part that was right was the amount of pain in the ass it was to get through their forest.
---
And to your point about the sword and sorcery style, I'd like to also make the point that dragon armor has been in the game since 2002. I think Jagex has always been geared towards high fantasy, but especially in the older days it didn't have the graphical power to support these kinds of graphics. 
---
Newer content does look different than old content because, y'know, it's newer. The definition has increased and their engine is being pushed more with newer content as Jagex learns and develops more as a company, and as well as tech has evolved. The graphical capabilities of all computer hardware has skyrocketed in the past 5 years. That means more color saturation, the ability to increase the definition of models, and even animation physics can be improved upon even whilst still using the old engine. They hire new (I know the word new is scary to osrs but bear with me here) artists, who know different artistic techniques and styles, however their concept art has remained somewhat similar over the years. 
---
In fact, from what I recall of their concept art from way back in the day, it was always pretty high fantasy style. Now, I had relatively strick parents as a child and so I didn't get to play osrs until I was a little older, so I joined a bit later than most players, and I mostly remember playing RuneScape around the time summoning came out, which was 2008/2009ish I believe. I did play before that but I don't remember much. However, when summoning came out I do remember all of the art that came with it was vibrant and color saturated and exciting to 10/11 year old me, however this was before they had updated the graphical engine I believe, so it still looked like osrs. 
---
Regardless, the point is that RuneScape has definitely had a high fantasy art style for a very long time. You could say the "old" elves bear a distant resemblance to Legolas, however in lotr his character just on looks alone didn't look as strikingly elvish as maybe Elrond or Arwen.
---
Anyway, that's all I have honestly. I think the devs did a good job and have adequate information to back up my claim. If you still disagree, you're welcome to have an opinion. Happy scaping good sir/madam/attack helicopter.
---
Still prefer the old chathead. its mentioned that the elves will be inconsistent if they are reverted to the original style. yes they will be - because the art style of the new ones is different. the new ones are the problem. match the art style. of the original not update and be inconsistent around the game
---
Make it 1/2000 from the Konar Slayer chest or something like that.
---
Mate I appreciate your suggestions. I think what people don't get is that I don't need to sell the boots to buy those items.
---
I got the berserker's ring already, and I have enough money to buy the archer's.
---
As for the necklace, I think it is a bit ironic that you're asking me to sell a 30M item to buy other half of its price. I rather distribute the money along with the other combat styles, that's why I got furys instead, and I'm left with plenty of money to invest in mage equipment.
---
As for the obsidian armor, what obsidian equipment is better than what I currently have?
---
Neitz helm, fighter torso, verac's plateskirt, dragon boots. I think getting a obsidian piece would be a downgrade
---
There is literally nothing realistic about runescape. You have wizard robes, dragon-hide armour, spiked red dragon equipment, all the god wars armour, narrows equipment, vampires, the daggonoths, vikings, zombies, ghosts, demons, goblins and their politics, the most powerful weapon for a long time was a whip.

So yes, it‚Äôs always been very much fantasy based. A castle here and there is not equal to ‚Äúrealistic-medieval‚Äù, especially in the low-poly context of Runescape.
---
RS2/osrs has a cartoony feel to it, it shouldn't strive to have overly realistic graphics IMO. The clunkiness is a bit of a moe point for the game.
---
This looks like a sick animation still lmao
---
Love the new chat head, though I was also on the side that thought it was fine
---
Not gonna lie, tiles poly and mob poly does not fit into original osrs at release. Updates like both raids and other new bosses with a few exceptions are far from original Runescape art style and it bugs me how oversaturated areas are with purple and other weird ass colors are.
---
More importantly, what about the crystal tree in prif you can plant
---
&gt;survey for people who completeled the tutorial
---
Do you know how many people got the beta invite, logged in saw how garbage it was and just logged out?
---
This is like saying only people with 2277 total should vote on a new skill since you know they completed the game and know how things work.

Where?
---
Hmm or maybe because the major content piece of the year got released yesterday? Nah must be those filthy No voters.
---
1m isn't much in terms of buyables tho
---
Looks like the start of a very weird porn video
---
We measure actual human feet in barleycorns.
---
Bought it for the quest sold it the next day, made like 600k lol
---
The depth of field on those objects in front and in the far background is superbly done! Jagex should hire you for official artwork, no joke.
---
Keep current. Memes are good
---
Dogs bury bones to raise their prayer levels
---
I honestly only got to the taxes part of the quest without a guide and then just checked the wiki for it for the hell of it. Couldn‚Äôt believe Christmas came early and a full guide was already up day 1.
---
What are the chances of a Varlamore reveal this year at Runefest, a new big area based on the style of Dark Souls.
---
I get turned on just thinking about it.
---
MTXing, can only be leveled through process of buying XP lamps, partnership deals, daily spins, and unlocking cosmetics/skin recolors.
---
skillers still exist? like the ones who stay 3 combat lmao? do they realize you can skill exactly the same whether you level your combat or not
---
very funny, just post a screenshot from rs3.
---
How are you dying?  Shouldn't have any problem if you just keep Protect from Ranged on the whole time, and brew over max HP as soon as you take out the healing pillars.  Use a trident, maybe rune pouch with your best blood spell for extra healing if you need it.
---
If your willing to be risky the pvp world is usually empty
---
I don't really have a whole lot to say on your first point, a lot of this discussion centres around the fact that Zalc sucks in crowded lobbies, and your experience seems to further speak to that.
---
On your second point though I pretty strongly disagree. I was in a similar situation to you at first - I thought the circles were total bullshit, but its honestly just practice. I can pretty confidently navigate my way through most of the layouts, you just gotta get confident with the way your character paths. The circles also do hugely decreased (maybe even zero) damage to you if they spawn under you, as long as you haul ass outta there. 
---
Its frustrating to learn, I know, I've been there - but its entirely conquerable, I promise.
---

---
Bars' prices are based on high alch mostly.
---
If you grind out 500 TL the 500 TL worlds in f2p are much less crowded everywhere
---
What a legend, embodying the model of RS economics, buy high, sell low.
---
&gt;  ...all while making a story that didn't jump the gun with going extreme (seeing a runescape God in person in person for instance or "threatening to destroy the whole world")- it was an overall interesting conflict.
---
How did RS3's Plague's End (Song of the Elves equivalent) jump the gun? That quest is barely any different from SotE. Also no gods are seen in that quest because that quest got canonically closure in the 5th age.
---
New hosidius and forthos dungeon are exactly osrs style. You and all the artists do great work but I really think there needs to be a focus shift back to that style. The higher poly models in my opinion are fine, but you can have higher poly without making everything so exaggerated and dramatic. Song of the elves is the worst offender in this area IMO, but that's just one (fairly important imo) nitpick in a sea of things you guys knocked out of the park with the quest.
---
don't worry we can vote it back down for you
---
nigga it took me like 5 attempts by the time I got the clear I was taking a break every 5 waves watching an episode of television smoking a bowl just waiting until I felt to start the next wave
---
if you are on runelite there is a plugin I believe called "menu switcher"? It allows you to switch the first click options around for most things.
---
Right in the nostalgia feels
---
Hey Gold was pretty okay for the most post
---
Anything but the current one, imo old one looks best though.
---
nah man bonds were going up before the new quest lol they're actually going down now slowly since we already killed warding
---
Real talk if you made a cartoon series, I‚Äôd sign up to receive it weekly/monthly, whatever it may be. I know turning fun into work isn‚Äôt always the best idea - but this could pan out well for you!
---
You got my Golden Gnome vote and you deserve it. I hope you win!
---
Don't use a shite free VPN then
---
I always remember wondering how one could get his body armor lol
---
Yeah I have trident and full ahrims setup with 20brews and the rest restores. I‚Äôve gotten her down to 300 hp but ran out of supplies because of the no block 90‚Äôs every 4th phase. I do only have 75 mage but just can‚Äôt do enough dps before my supplies are gone :/
---
Crafting. Cause I usually can't be bothered to and I need more levels for clues.
---
Ya‚Äôll never seen throwin‚Äô darkies before? Same as the white ones, but 3/5th the cost!
---
Still a lot less than blast furnace gold ore.
---
Photoshop does have video editing capabilities I actually used it for the third time ever last night and then it failed to render and crashed making me lose my edit of a 10 second clip.
---
99 FM at Wintertodt was fun as hell. Just about all of the conversations there were hilarious.
---
I agree with you but at the same time it makes it hard to actually have wars or events when you can't count on most of your clan. So it really depends on how you wanna play the game because reqs help with some stuff.
---
And yeah, all the serious clans out there who actually wanna be one of the best, whether it's pure or main clan, will require at least 50 pk sets at all times so you don't just stop showing up in a war because you ran out of sets.
---
Hoping people vote for the old Elena
---
Yo. So the problem I had on my first attempt was that I ran out of pots (took 19 brews and 7 restores).
---
The reason I ran out was because I was healing too much. You only need to be (over) full health before the big attack. After the big attack, just make sure you have say 60 HP left. Concentrate on doing as much damage as possible.
---
Also, kill the healers as fast as possible.
---
I did it on my second attempt with these points in mind.
---
The Serp helm, as an amorphous green snake coif, was always a terrible replacement for the iconic, sleek design of Neitiznot for BiS.
---
Just running out of supplies getting her down to around 300hp
---
If you are doing it on world where there is 10+ people try doing on world with 10 people max, you will probably have more damage dealt and more rewards
---
Mining at motherlode mine for coal bag then smithing at blast furnace
---
It's a money making guide, but wont be as good money per hour because lower levels will have less kills per hour and kills per trip because dragons hit more often. It would be 100% worth it to put your main in NMZ to base 90's before you kill them. Weapons in order Lance&gt;Hasta&gt;Abby dagger. Didnt put rapier cuz clearly have the money for a lance at that point and just use that lol
---
It's more than 100xp, and the xp increases dramatically with items that use more bars
---
I sponsored my friend to 2 bonds. He sustained his bond just by doing birdhouses from the lowest level. He was only 300k short. 8 runs a day.
---
This looks awesome.
---
I have seen this type of post already but I agree! It was great fun.
---
Yeah I pray range the whole time and click away when she pulls me in. I make sure to get her healers the instant they spawn. I can only take so many 95‚Äôs during the 4th stage before I run out of brews tho
---
Other way round, bout time jagex started graphically updating the rest of the game
---
That's your roll.
---
I can‚Äôt believe that thing didn‚Äôt fucking pass
---
Put it into cooking and make money off of it. Or fletching.
---
sit
---
Hmm that is surprising.
---
Are you only healing prior to and after the 90+ hit?
---
I personally used void and found I never missed, I know shes weak to mage but perhaps with your lower level its an accuracy problem?
---
Looks pretty good with lumberjack imo
---
I've never tried it, but they do seem to have decent mage def. It could be worth a try. 
---
Additionally, if you're struggling hitting, it may be worth trying to use a warrior's ring instead of berserker ring, for the additional accuracy.
---
this shit looks like Everquest 2 lol
---
When I was playing around with the cache, the music files were in MIDI format. So, yes it's an instruction set.
---
I gotchu bro. eksdeeeeeee
---
Stuck at work, waiting to get home and finish SoTE :( Got thru the item puzzle before going to bed last night
---
If someone asked me what the worst looking object in game was, I'd say the lance. The easter egg armour looks better.
---
Love everything else though. Thanks West
---
Almost everyone gets graceful by 60 running the Canadian agility course starting at 40. You can get it even earlier if you start rooftop courses earlier. 70 is much farther away.
---
Bad example, since [RS3 infinity robes](https://i.imgur.com/wC5N9NP.png) match my description **even more**, so that proves that the trend I described is real. Anyway, 1-2 exceptions doesn't mean my overall point is wrong, but they aren't even really exceptions. Mystic robes sets literally have only 2 colors per set, that's exactly the kind of minimalism I was talking about. They look pretty tame compared to RS3 stuff.
---
Why don‚Äôt the quest icons disappear on the map after you complete? I personally would love that so I know which ones not to check again.
---
I thought it was a cool idea
---
A cosmetic that's always at a set price and you can't sell it back?
---
That's an awesome way to do ultra rares imo
---
not that this really matters but for lore's sake, Zalcano is a female. She is the sister of Skotizo! They were both zamorakian generals in the godwars, and she was cursed to stone by zamorak for her brother's betrayal.
---
It‚Äôs meant to be high level content, it‚Äôs not dungeoneering that‚Äôs kind of like saying get rid of triple jads in inferno to make it more accessible imo
---
Actually pretty damn cool
---
I had my alt doing 99 fishing there (4 stupid long months btw) while I played my main. Was like 20cb from my str levels and no other stats besides that. Didnt talk much myself. They're not bots, they just hate their life and want to end that grind already.. or maybe that was just me.
---
They do not fit in the style of the game at all.
---
Lilsmokey
---
I like WoWs artsyle, but only in the context of WoW. It suits such a high fantasy environment, but it doesn't work at all in something like runescape, which has roots as a medieval world, only with dragons, demons, and magic.
---
You asked for averages so that's why I said that, everyone has a different playstyle it's hard to get an answer. To contribute as much as I can though, I'd consider my playstyle like how you described, not 100% grinding but still trying. So for me I started my acc in dec. 2018 and have 71 days played (~1700+ hrs) and I'm not even 2k total yet. (1941 total lvl, 105m xp. Got QP cape in March, 99 fish in april, 99cook in may, 99fm in june and almost 70 base). Normal acc btw. I'm not the best moneymaker tho so that might skew the rates a bit.
---
Are you using a trident? If yes your amulet of the damned is useless.
---
Bloodvelds are fine, these ones are cannonable like the gnome dungeon and they drop crystal shards so I have a reason not to use nieve's cave.
---
Nechryael are completely pointless though because the xp/hr is just so mind-blowingly higher from barraging catacombs.
---
if your cash stack is just sitting in your bank, try this: put in a buy order for 1000 vials at 1gp each.
---
if none buy, you lose nothing because the money was just sitting in the bank anyways
---
if some buy, you can instantly resell them for double or triple, so you make money.
---
that's a simple example, obviously the more money and the higher margins you work with, the more you stand to make (or lose).
---
most items have natural fluctuations in pricing just through supply/demand depending on how many got farmed from week to week, but sometimes other factors like new quests/training methods can affect this.
---
You mean the greenish-blue, brown, and purple color scheme they use for literally every update now? Yeah... It's soooo beautiful...
---
My first rat was in a cage in the open air, on RSC tutorial island 8)
---
Its funny how people crying about the gauntlet xD i only got 2kills in 30 attemps but i try and get better and better. I like the challenge very much
---
"get guys I'm guy"
---
You having a stroke there?
---
There‚Äôs a whole money making guide on the wiki
---
hey that pretty good
---
It's like 160-180k xp/hr but really click intensive unless you use a cheat client because you can't 1 click pickpocket them.
---
GP/hr is insanely high for now bc you get 7-8m if you manage to pickpocket an eternal elf crystal.
---
I don't find it hard to complete with T1 armor and T3 hally/bow but I am almost maxed melee and range.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to having the standard mode have a longer time, maybe 15 minutes. I don't think it's super needed though. Haven't tried Corrupted so can't comment on that.
---
I'd like an unlimited time mode, that's pretty much identical to the normal one just with unlimited time.  Maybe don't have it drop loot so it's just used for practice.
---
I have, thanks for the shitty attitude. He does quests etc... Read before you make yourself look like a child again.
---
It's the Arceuus library lol.  It's like that's the only scenery they know how to make anymore.
---
Awesome thank you Raze, I agree :)
---
Thanks so much for the tip
---
I did the middle first, and didn't bother screenshotting small areas of the minimap, so I took the whole minimap instead. Then I realised it's probably better if I made it cleaner. Figured it didn't really matter much anyways, you could still see the important bits.
---
im not dutch and not all beatrixes are dutch, only dutch thing i know is "kanker hoer"
---
They're just too pointy.
---
Remember when sharks were over 1k each? 
---
Yeah I don't mind it.
---
If you think the chatheads look good, you should actually commit suicide.
---
Thanks everyone I'll try my first flips right now
---
well jokex nerfed it already so waste of perfectly good 30 seconds
---
Gameplay wise, the quest was pretty much just mep3 with a standard grandmaster-tier bossfight on the end. Nothing special there.
---
But the plot and characters in it were absolutely amazing. I don't think i've ever been able to say a quest absolutely nailed the characters ever before, and god damn im happy to be able to say it now.
---
Wooooow this is so nice, I wish I had extra money to give gold to this &gt;\_&lt;
---
More Anime x Oldschool runescape art please :D
---
Doesn‚Äôt help that OP made that rat cute.
---
The entire dungeon is dead content lmao. Literally why even bother doing any task in there.
---
For whatever it's worth, when something makes *me* think it doesn't fit Old School it's because it has overly fine detail (Serpentine helm; simple concept but way too many colors) (Obsidian armor falls into this in a different way; the glowing bits are too thin and hard to see) random meaningless patterns (Graceful), or something egregiously unnecessary or impractical that does the design in question no favors (Neitiznot helm gets away with its wings because it's otherwise simplistic and winged helmets are cool... the hole in the middle of the crystal armor's chest doesn't do as many wonders for it).  
---
Also, sorry to be pedantic, but I did say *armor*. Magic robes are fine to an extent, and for my mockup 3a magic gloves I thought about it pretty thoroughly before I deemed the gems fair game. They're quaint and lone on each side, you can't even see both gems at once outside of a front view, the decoration they're contained in is distinct rather than just the same shape as the gem, and they get to piggyback off the pre-established amulet to imply they have magical properties.  
---
That aside, I guess I'll just close this comment by thanking you for your kind words. Despite my qualms with the art direction of modern OSRS content, I really do appreciate what you guys do for the game and I hope you continue to give it your best for years to come.
---
I didn't even know they changed the artwork until I saw this sub constantly bitch about it.
---
Is it bright or lack of attention span, I died twice because I was watching youtube.
---
Gotta be Rendi
---
Yes he does quests, majority of your slayer monsters are locked behind quests... 
---
maybe you should learn more about this game before piling up with a shitty account idea that no one will give a fuck about.
---
Definitely suspicious. Jamflex should look into it. It would be an easy bot farm to decimate too (if it is one), since getting back to the ability to do them takes forever (fishing + anglers)
---
Varrock west sucks to Smith at
---
Ah, so say 40-50 shards per hour, doesn't seem too overpowered with those rewards then imo
---
i had the exact thought when i saw the boss. it has to be an easter egg... she even has clones!
---
Try blood blitz with ancient staff. The heals from blood spells help a lot
---
Imperial stouts fucking lit
---
The fact that this is what RS3 people are saying proves that we voted right.
---
I nowhere said I like the chatheads, I just think we should also highlight the positive parts.
---
People complained about the chat heads, which I agree are a departure from the aesthetic of the rest of the game, but otherwise a lot of the artwork was really good. The first time I saw the memory of Seren in the library I had to sit back for a bit and admire it. I can‚Äôt wait to see which quest line they decide to extend next! (Please desert treasure)
---
Right so citizens of your kingdom are being kidnapped and forced to work to death in the mines. If those citizens revolt and overthrow the king they become the bad guys?
---
Support
---
I can feel my mental walls that protect my inner safe place being bombarded with new content. I am not winning this battle, and I'm afraid those walls will be nothing more than a pile of dust.
---
I'm not saying that. I'm saying that it's a cosmetic-only item, not BiS, etc and it's not likely to be high priority for them.
---
Goreu in Lletya
---
I think the point is that while runescape is and always has been a fantasy game, the gear traditionally looked like actual armor and was, for the most part, realistically practical.
---
Woah that is freaking cool! I really like all of them, you should be very proud. When you say you guys aren't credited properly, does that mean you didn't know the story would be in the game until it was released?
---
Huge if true
---
Damn yeah that was my favorite period of RS as well
---
Played back in the day in 2004. Def. just getting back into it. So yeah I‚Äôm a noob lol
---
I think rapier is kinda overvalued atm compared to other items
---
Oh, that‚Äôs why i couldn‚Äôt find Runescape on my phone earlier the icon changed. I thought it somehow got deleted lol!
---
Swamp man for best video maker, Chestbrah for best video.
---
Fair point. Doesn't change the fact on how it scales. 
---
Either way the poll system is fluffed with alts. I voted yes on 3 accounts (main, iron, pure[WIP]). I don't see this as doing anything wrong...
---
Is it maybe unfair that I have more say then someone who maybe plays 3 to 4 times as much as me just on 1 account, maybe. 
---
Personally I like the 75% threshold, and I think alt voting isn't that bad. I like to think my votes helped keep the underground pass gr... err... terrible.
---
In short I prefer to have the power to prevent something from getting in then voting it in.  With over 40k votes for no. Even without alts I am fairly certain it would have failed.
---
I thought it was teabags and biscuits?
---
Wasn't the king doing it off the premise that he was keen on benefitting from what the elves were after?
---
if only you were a RS3 player, you wouldn't need the am i gay app
---
150? In some wars youre expected to have 300+ sets of pk gear
---
of course i didn't, it's a quest and quests are food for my spacebar
---
also rs lore omegalul
---
It's made so that they protect over other things like dscims, etc.
---
I‚Äôm 20 days 10 hours on my normal account with only 1283 total
---
They have
---
The staff looks wonderful! Very well done and aesthetically old school.
---
Do you have any idea how much the RS3 players don‚Äôt like that everyone chills at pride because all other areas are obsolete
---
I do not like the fact that the items are constantly changing in the selection and having different numbers. Its a quality of life change that would keep it consistent and always have the same hotkeys regardless of resources; also do not close the menu after a craft. Since it is timed every second counts.
---
any changes to brutal blacks at all in the past 6 months or so?
---
I'm doing it for fun, for me, I'm just asking for some suggestions. I never said I was recording or posting updates.
---
I'm doing it because I want to do just fun things I find in game to be good. So stfu and bounce on you freak. Stop making up arguments that and saying things I'm not even saying you absolute boring freak.
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/ClearCarefulRaisinStrawBeary](https://clips.twitch.tv/ClearCarefulRaisinStrawBeary)
---
Please improve gauntlet rewards and/or xp. It's such a fantastic minigame but you're lucky to even average 500k/hr in profit with existing mechanics. Combined with the abysmal xp you receive (Maybe 1k xp/hr in most skills from the minigame) it's just so unbelievably inefficient to play.
---
Dungeoneering was one of my all time favorite things in 2011scape and I adore this minigame, but it's so hard to justify spending my limited free time here when it's just so bad for the time you spend.
---
Also maybe try to make it a little less rng dependent. For regular gauntlet it's fine. But corrupted REQUURES basically maxed out gear and tons of supplies. Most of the time you're extremely unlikely to get enough supplies for boss even if you haul ass.
---
[Black armor is what you want to use though. Slightly more tokens/hp and it won't break.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Warriors%27_Guild#Animation_room)
---
Escape his video was really good
---
dont ask why.
---
No kidding either
---
That‚Äôs super interesting, if it is indeed the case that challenge mode only offers an extra role with no added chances of drops it would probably be best to farm normal gauntlet for pet then
---
I miss RSC
---
Who?
---
Thanks man!
---
Huh, that's weird. I used similar gear at 84 magic and only used like 6-7 brews I believe. Are you using an occult necklace?
---
RS3 just mad OSRS has a community based game, and we can't be forced MTX or shitty game ruining updates without our consent.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty unpopular
---
Started playing Old school today and this pops up wonderful
---
There is no argument to be had because all you are saying is "WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE WHAT DOESN'T FIT JAGEX IS ALWAYS RIGHT THEY CAN DO NO WRONG"
---
Okay smart guy, let's take all the RS3 characters and add them to OSRS, because it's just updated graphics right? So clearly it fits the aesthetic!
---
source?
---
A cosmetic shop like this might encourage bond purchases to buy the items, basically enabling MTX in osrs.
---
As soon as you get to the point where you don't want them, you're definitely getting them every other task :)
---
As others suggested, if you magic is high enough try healing up with blood spells. Bit more time consuming but I reckon that should work
---
Well that's ridiculous. Congrats!
---
Yeah. It also doesn't factor in banking. 
---
I'd love to know the super hidden Jagex method of apparently more than doubling the amount of shards he gives.
---
youre comparing apples and oranges
---
Ill try
---
99 firemaking, baby wooo!!! It might be the easiest 99 to get but I love it
---
I'd rather not allow you to have access to my Google Account. This is also quite pointless. If you want someone to tell you to do something for a reward do slayer. Or set your own goals in your own time. This would be a waste of time creating. Sorry you spent time on this garbage.
---
Thanks for sharing, man. Super glad you like this.
---
Arianwyn is a dude???
---
good
---
So i need to complete the quest?
---
Well, you at least correctly used the Unpopular Opinion preface...
---
rip your karma I guess.
---
Well look on the bright side, that's max exp in a combat stat.
---
Have you found it‚Äôs more important to get the hits on her shield or the pick hits? Also how many pick hits do you go for? Thanks!
---
Ah, thanks so much!!
---
Tone down the purple on Iorweth and the dark elves at least please.
---
I never thought someone could get so butthurt about such a slight update to a character model in fuckin' runescape.
---
Exactly my point lol
---
I was expecting a really Pissed off player in Dave's basement with a kitten.
---
Would be great if i couf get loot aswell. boss is okay but i did 6 kills and only got 2 lot drops off them. no afk, actively participated. dont ubderstand why in had nothing....
---
You just pissed of some fat neckbeards...be ready to walk away from them, lol.
---
Basically a ‚Äúpreditors ez sheet‚Äù
---
Doesn't Settled put crazy amounts of effort into his videos?, i didn't vote and i don't know much about this stuff really, i do watch their videos on youtube and i think they're all great really from different point of views, they all have their own angles of producing content for osrs community.
---
yeah, remember that 15k player base, woah it was excellent
---

Here you go, they're cute

Dimitrix won in the end
---
woulda cummed for my boy zaros
---
Yeah well i laugh and enjoy the content
---
WeirdChamp....j1mmy is that you?
---
like I said, it wasn't perfect but the concept is still a good one I think.
---
Lol, you're so wrong its funny.
---
The fact that you used the term "good" puts bias into your claims already because "good" is subjective. A good game to you may not be good to others.
---
WoW most certainly has more than 4 servers operating worldwide. Just like most games, if not all.
---
It is NOT uncommon to relinquish hosting to various 3rd parties and most games actually do since it is a lot cheaper than hardware, staff to manage it, software licenses, etc. To own everything outright would cost an excessive amount beyond buying server space/hosting (think like 5x+). How do you think most SEA games come to the West? Damn near every Korean title is linked up with a publisher in the west to handle servers.
---
Genuine question, would it ever be possible to embed images into polls?
---
I have a feeling that the Elena poll will have a huge amount of votes to pure revert without actually looking at the options, even though the newly proposed one is very clearly an improvement on the original and inkeeping with the original style.
---
I'm fairly sure that if the images were there to see next to the options, the result would be drastically different to just a link being next to them.
---
So your reasoning is essentially just that you don't like his content as much.
---
I'm upset because the original faces in the chat boxes are something that is old and nostalgic to me. I hated the 2008 HD update and onward when the faces changed dramatically to what they are in RS3. Seeing the beginning of them changing now makes me fearful that we are going to see more changes like this in the future, and wipe away more 2007 nostalgia as time goes on. It may be small to you and you don't care, but to some people, the little things actually matter.
---
Just the music alone brings me back 10 years...

I think the thing that's impressive about Settled's videos is the amount of planning and dedication that goes into them. There's so many restricted ironman series out there, but he has genuinely perfected the idea, to a degree i've not seen in any other genre of Runescape content before. I think the only series that's ever rivaled it is B0aty's original One Man Army series, but in terms of quality and impact on the community.
---
Opinions can definitely be bad, stupid, and uneducated. The whole "everyone's opinion is valid" is nonsense. Everyone can have their own opinion. Not all are valid.
---
Well, to be fair, the swastika is tilted. The non-tilted one is just an Indian(?) symbol I believe
---
Definite second here
---
IMO dungeoneering as a minigame in osrs would be dope. It is definitely a minigame more than a skill. Been trying the gauntlet and it feels like dungeoneering done properly
---
I never thought it was unclear tbh
---
What spell should I go with?
---
WOW, thanks so much for this super detailed feedback! I am still learning, and I really appreciate your advice, and thanks for taking the time to provide examples and extra info! I'll save your comment for future reference!
---
Reading the comments, I just wish I understood any of these words lol. I've never gotten really far is RuneScape or been a member
---
Fuck that lol. I like who they polled making it easier. Then when that didn't pass apparently Jortplox just said "Well FUCK em then".
---
Despite killing all those innocent guards, that shit was mega fun
---
Okay honestly the biohazard change is the one that fucks me up the most that should be criminal
---
Bonds are already mtx though
---
you can watch the streams at  [https://www.twitch.tv/samurai\_pr](https://www.twitch.tv/samurai_pr)   :D, walking with so many alts make people go crazy , lol
---
Surely that would be overpowered? Zuk would just stay hidden away.
---
The combat in the game is not an issue. Its actually quite fun to do some of the higher level bosses in rs3. Loved arraxor and had fun with telos. The issue with rs3 isn‚Äôt the combat system. 
---
The issue with rs3 is the beyond excessive micro transactions and a theres no challenge in progressing your account. If there was no 6 hour log you could never move your mouse and go to 200m mining, agility, fishing, and crafting (although crafting is much slower) with methods unlocked in their Prifddinas, not even counting the silverhawk boots that turned agility to a buyable, passive skill. 
---
At least that‚Äôs my 2 cents
---
Wtf!
---
250mill shop cosmetic? Sorry I‚Äôm on vacation and out of the loop
---
no problem, i'm glad you took it well. happy to help.
---
It was "vague"
---
That would be pretty fucking funny if it was J1mmy trolling Settled
---
This is sick. I would buy this as a print in a heartbeat!

Yeah I‚Äôm a little let down that the new skilling boss is good for profit but not xp...

I just got it as well 1 kc , sold 246m haha grats man!!!
---
You have a teleport Crystal or a fucking house teleport....
---
No, 120 virtual levels is 104m
---
I‚Äôd rather train runecrafting though zalcano with 4K do per hour than train it normally
---
What makes you think this gives me access to your Google Account?
---
It's better than pre-Ardy courses, as it's a lvl 75 course. When you hit 90, there's no reason to stay. However, they're going to be polling buffing it to 66k/h, which would make it better than Ardy. Also, in another question, the amount of crystal shards could be increased from the lesser giving activities, such as agility.
---
I went with Iban's blast, dunno if it's the best
---
Saying the other guys put in more effort and more jokes and Swampletics just has some kind of unexplainable hype that he doesn't deserve is unfair. It's a series about Runescape. Watching him do all these crazy grinds is way entertaining and just because he doesn't rap or make a dick joke every 40 seconds in his videos doesn't mean he doesn't deserve the hype.
---
Classic Googolplex releasing something that has stupidly high rewards only to nerf it into oblivion a week later.
---
Other content creators are excellent. Implying that settled doesn't put effort into his videos is why you suck. 
---
His content is niche and takes so much time to complete. That alone is mentally draining. 
---
Will settled win a golden gnome? who knows. Does he deserve to win one? yes.
---
Hell, buff it to 50 at least an hour. Current rates best I can tell being 42ish/hr (and as you pointed out not even realistic) means you'll have to do around 2.4 hours of zolcano to fully charge the blade, which then only lasts for 100 minutes of combat.... something doesn't seem right here.
---
Except you can't buy exp?
---
Didn't find it here, is that in another sub?
---
Imma give it a shot, thanks man
---
Because Watching trash kids die is fun
---
He plays the game alot and does something basic editing, but I think people like J1mmy should win the Gnome. 
---
J1mmy has a consistent upload schedule. Swampman doesn't upload for weeks. Yeah it might be because he doesn't have much content to show but...he chose to restrict himself. 
---
J1mmy's editing is on another level. He makes quests look like actual movies. It's awesome. I just don't think Swampletics deserves the Gnome as much as the other YouTubers. **He even has a video out showing us why we should vote for him. It's hilarious!**  And made me realize how much he deserves the Gnome
---
The point is to not run out ever and not have to go buy crystal shields every day or every few. And because I wanted more than 50 lmao? I know some RoT members with more than 700 before this update
---
WOW

You and me both

To be fair, this had to be always an unintentional loophole of the traps. Strange there was nothing in patch notes though.
---
The only item sink we need is death mechanics reverted so you lose ur items on death. We dont need anything other than that. There would probably be 30000 less bandos tassets in game if we had that.
---
The white recolor that you get from 100% favor is the best looking graceful don't @ me

Good luck, might take a bit of rng

I‚Äôve actually heard that rats make surprisingly good pets. A giant rat may just be a cheese-loving dog.
---
Yup you got me not like there‚Äôs ways to convert the shards into something sellable. Lied right through my teeth. Good catch your a genius.
---
...lol
---
I don't get what the appeal of Swampletics is either so don't feel too bad about it.
---
Update: this also applies to the floor traps where you're *supposed* to put a plank over it.
---
I wonder if this applies to other areas of the game too, like rouges den?
---
You couldn't buy xp in 2010 nor could you buy bonds for gp. You babies can downvote me all you want but it's a fact that osrs is more ezcape than 2010. This coming from a guy who played nonstop from 2006-2012
---
specifically woodcutting
---
I'd argue not having a map is absolutely fine from a classic difficulty standpoint. There's something enjoyable about either building a complex mental map of the environment, or drawing your own map based on what you see.
---
I don't mind it being added since it can be ignored, but as someone who lives for that shit I really enjoyed the process of mentally mapping the whole area

I always wondered if you could max out those skills in the training island when I was younger
---
I've noticed this and I started paying atttention.  I saw that  I sometimes click on my endless compost a tick early as I finish harvesting the last herb and it doesn't register (no xp drop) and so the herb grows without ultra compost unbeknown to me.
---
I don't care about anything that's currently in the game except the existence of graceful and blowpipe
---
Maybe they have and he has declined idk? They def should though.
---
Man imagine not being able to get 70mining and agility and having to waste the whole game tick smithing at varrock. Gross.
---
That‚Äôd be cool
---
Last time you checked..? WoW has 4 server locations, and many 'worlds' (servers) at each location, google wow world machine, they're very sexy dedicated servers. Shut up acting like you just happened to research this before replying to my comment lmfao.
---
 What games use 3rd party server host, mordhau? Minecraft? thats about it. Name another that's popular please. 
---
You're retarded about saying 5x the cost lol, its an upfront cost vs paying fees indefinitely...? 
---
You think korean games are a good example? Korea has dumbass internet laws, and anyone you have to pay fees to connect to korean servers (see sc2). They have to find a 3rd party.
---
literal shakening
---
I'm wondering this as well, I did an hour of Zalcano on w2 and another hour in a world with 4-8 people. Both times, I got maybe 20-30 shards in that hour. Ironically, I got less shards in the world 2 mass. So I would LOVE to know how people are getting 100 shards an hour.
---
Art is subjective.  
---
And i can definitely appreciate the art/graphics in older games such as Super Mario Bros. 3 and Old School RuneScape.
---
Very Nice
---
amazing!
---
I do like his videos. I said that in the post. I genuinely don't think he puts in as much effort as other content creators. And it shows. His videos are really generic. He just plays the game alot, and gets low xp rates. That's not enough to win the Gnome compared to other content creators, imo.
---
You guys are godly thank you
---
Well there's 2011 private servers so you can go play that

They bite, every pet rat ive ever been in cotact with seems to hate me.

Do you even watch his videos kid? Do you remember his video where he did the Haunted Mine quest or A Taste of Hope quest? Both of those videos were so exciting to watch
---
Since I must leave feedback here:
---
I don't like the new models or new chatheads. I'd prefer they stay the same low-poly level that we all came back for and love and expect. It's already jarring with the rest of the game, will other models be updated to match? We are headed to RSHD, which is not ehat I came for. Other people I have talked to feel that if the game continues in this artistic direction of purple and neon highpolyscape, we may as well quit.
---
Please do not write off our feedback as bitter sweaty neckbeards that certain users like to demonize us as. The artstyle is important, and our opinions should be as valuable as everyone elses. Please do not alienate us like you alienated the playerbase before.
---
How long until you could get back in? I'm legit at 10 minutes.

Essylt literally looks like a sheep and arianwynn's face is a mile long

Other than that I don't mind the elves' chatheads but leave the humans normal pls

Combat isn't remotely an active skill, what are you smoking

You let your mom use your computer?

I believe it is to help alleviate some of the server stress from the new content. I doubt it will be permanent.

Did you try to see what happens if you skull with it?

It's solo dungeoneering without teleports or puzzles or key doors and only 1 possible boss. The focus is on that boss fight at the end of each run. You collect resources for a bit and get teled to the boss if you run out of time. But yeah, you traverse rooms similar to dg... but this is nowhere near as fun.
---
None.
---
Fox the current skills and add HDs graphics to increase current quality of the game before introducing more stuff.
---
I hope it's just something with their servers and not them changing the limit. It was working fine this morning, now it's messed up.
---
Too bad
---
only on this subreddit do I check comment history b/c people on here change opinions like shirts in order to suit w/e side of the drama backlash currently has the moral highground.

Haha same, I actually enjoy watching videos more than playing the game

What stats and gear should I have to fight sarachnis? I have base 76/76/76, but struggled fighting her.

Can't remember the quest but, there is a quest where someone asks who you are, and you have the option to say I'm a Wayfaring Stranger.  
---
My Johnny Cash boner couldnt have gotten any harder lmao
---
It's worse than Seers with Kandarin diary done pre-90 AND doesn't give Marks of Grace. It only gives Crystal Shards, but only like 5-8 an hour. It also isn't as AFK.
---
Community didnt want it. Not sure why thats so hard to believe
---
Ended up doing in a world with like 12~ other players (at least when I entered). At that size, it wasn't too bad, but it was still fairly easy. I can definitely see how at double that size it would have melted before you could get a hit in on its shield.
---
Personally, I'd be okay if they capped both skilling bosses at like 5-10 players per instance. Though I doubt that would go over well... Even with 10 it would probably still be pretty quick and easy, but it wouldn't be as bad as it can get with larger groups. But even if we were to give more time to contribute in larger groups, I still think the group scaling and reward structure is a problem with skilling bosses.

I remember sitting at my cousins desk. I didn't have internet at the time. He was showing me this new game that was "like WOW but not". He helped me make an account. SirNotsuoh6. I had no idea what I was clicking into. The map was HUGE. There was so much. Walking around to the desert. Being mad that I had to pay gp to cross the gate. Killing goblins. I remember finally getting my 10k from stronghold. I thought I was SO rich.  Good times. Thanks for the nostalgia.

yeah I did actually lmfao, blowpipe especially should've never existed tbh

Lol yeah I do, and  those were my favorite

If you bums need health insurance get off runescape and get a job, that way the government can‚Äôt decide who gets healthcare and who doesn‚Äôt :-)

If you‚Äôre using Runelite, I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a check mark or an X by quest icons, depending if you‚Äôve done or not.

Or maybe some of it just isn‚Äôt fun

get it guys he's gay, he likes men, isn't homosexuality a funny joke

no it's just limitations of their engine. probably too much poly in one area

Oh, I'm sure the exp is terrible. I haven't kept track, but I have like 243K for the week and I've probably spent 4+ hours pickpocketing; so like 60K per hour at best. That said, I also averaged like 5M+ profit per hour today, which is pretty good for pickpocketing. I found a nice spot to do it too; right outside the POH portal there is a small house with an NPC that doesn't seem to be able to wander out. So I pickpocket, POH tele when HP is low for restore pool, then out of portal and like 5 steps back to NPC. At the moment, it is probably the most profitable content in Prif since the seeds seem to be like 1 in 100 or 1 in 128 (I average about 1 pre-doubling per hour or so). But I am not sure how Zalcano and Gauntlet are with their uniques and I could be getting luck with seeds. Still, I got 4 drops (8 total) so not the best sample size but decent.
---
Yeah? That's the real grind. It's probably very difficult for most people to do something that he's done. That's what makes his content enjoyable. I sure as shit won't do any temple treks I don't need to. 
---
If we're going strictly based on effort, organizing 24 content creators to do a battle royale from all different timezones probably was the most difficult. 
---
Good thing it's opinion based and your vote counts :)
---
I disagree with your examples being any more worthy but I understand your sentiments here - it is a bit of unfair weight on the scales given settled hype
---
Probably not. Someone made a post about failing the fight with 75.
---
I didn't know you could get MVP at Zalcano.
---
Now I just need to improve that Cooking level
---
I would hope they don't think that works lol. A skip vote is basically abstaining from the question, it's neither a no or yes and shouldn't count towards the overall threshold.
---
They're quite quick though, not bad
---
How about you follow your own advice and go proofread? My argument was that it was unreasonable to set up servers worldwide. You are a damn cig-baby lmao, got the memory of a goldfish.
---
Kinda like slayer?
---
Has anyone tried Zulcano with a rune pickaxe? Is it viable?
---
It looks dope to me
---
Zolcano definitely seems a lot more than 1.4 shards per kill.It definitely wouldn't surprise me if it was approaching 100 per hour.
---
Still think gauntlet should be brought up closer to 100 an hour though, I think that once the hype dies down the gauntlet will be absolutely fucking dead considering how bad the profit is compared to other PvM activities.
---
And a healthy supply of shards will make people able to justify the use of divine potions,
---
It took me 2 days lmao. That light puzzle
---
We can all cry together, its ok.
---
the client can only handle rendering so many bank spaces.
---
thats why they added stuff like stash units instead of more bank space
---
Unlikely it will affect the price of those ores because most of the value is tied to it's alch value. It just adds a few hundred mill an hour to the gp in game.
---

People do Zulrah at the same time as stuff like blast furnace? Maybe it's just that I haven't done Zulrah since ToB and Chambers came out, but seems like it'd be so hard to do bf and zulrah at the same time. Feels like you'd get any bars done, but I guess I've never tried it maybe it's easier than it sounds.
---
Congrats. Are you planning on grinding out Zulrah for money?  I‚Äôve been grinding Vorkath for money. Currently 180 KC and no pet.
---
No, I wouldn't remotely describe that as active.  Active to me is something like 3t4g or lava racing

The wilderness has never been designed to be death match style and I can‚Äôt see that changing. Clans would still benefit because every clan doesn‚Äôt have 20 people I guess I should say small teams. The wilderness is dying and so is solo pking (I was a main well before an iron so I get it). But I‚Äôd be willing to bet you‚Äôre going to discourage new players by doing this. There‚Äôs a substantial learning curve to PvP and if players who are experimenting are more than likely to have to finish fights now than before after a few deaths most players are just going to say fuck this and give up. I‚Äôm all for improving PvP mechanics and simply trying to revive it but I don‚Äôt think this would be the way. The primary goal atm should be encouraging new players to pick up PvP even if it means experienced players have to make some sacrifice or lose a small advantage. Like I said I‚Äôd rather PvP for 5 hours and have fights that involve kills or not than hop around for 5 hours and have a handful.
---
haha i made like 5m the first week merching those. bought poison and reg ones for 20k.
---
Well, I suppose so. I like artisan as a idea, don't get me wrong. I'm just unsure wether it wouldn't kill off some content, that's all.  
---
Also I feel like skilling is more diverse than combat would be without slayer, don't you think?
---
This is sublime.  
---
I particularly like the pour, the pipe, and the faces
---
Ardougne Massacre never forget

So is the city instanced since you can‚Äôt see it from the outside? If so, is there a cancerous load delay like there is in a poh?
---
it degrades pretty fast and all bis (not sure about armor) u need to farm alot of shards
---
It's not even brutal in a deserved kinda way. Just "hurray you got the prayer right, now you only get hit for a 20 which is just as much as a piece of food heals".
---
another man's trash is another man's treasure.
---
That's pretty subjective.  I've seen things similar to J1mmys content in the past.  Having gotten quest cape a few times in osrs the content just doesn't appeal to me as much.  I would never even attempt what settleds doing it's literally insane for any normal person to do.    I think the quality could be higher but when you're trying to meet the demands of the community with releases J1mmy definitely has the advantage by a large margin.
---
It is instanced but there isnt a delay thats noticable from what I can tell
---
Cool. Guess you have a different definition of active. Because to me, anything that isn‚Äôt afk is active. Makes sense right? If you have to be paying attention (obviously nightmare zone not included) then you‚Äôre being active. Sure you can afk for like 5 seconds here or there, but with slayer tasks, and especially bosses, you‚Äôre more active than most other tasks in the game. Prayer flicking, armor switching, following techniques that take actual practice, etc.
---

I'm just going to stop here. It's pretty clear a basement dwelling keyboard warrior with a "private server" knows more about it than I do.
---
Have a nice night/day man. Cheers.
---
I mean it depends on who you‚Äôre fighting. I was killing Vene for an hour today. I was risking well over 1M. (Slay helm, archer (I), Craws, Anguish, and pegs plus Bandos dhide and PvM loot) When I black chin hunt I risk chins + probably a few hundred K. But I can absolutely assure you if your suggestion happened I‚Äôd be risking way less.
---
Money snake is more money. Like Rune dragons is 1.3m maybe at absolute best. I guess it's moreso what you're in the mood for tbh.

Yea ......

---
Ok nice
---
That's what I thought tard, why are you talking about the big picture? We're having a specific discussion on reddit. Not proposing an idea to your boss beta-fuck. 
---
Big claims for someone who hasn't proved shit. Wouldn't make it far as a lawyer I can tell you that much.
---
Someone who is actually pking against a pker could still possibly just tele or could freeze and walk under, or freeze and go behind a tree. This post is targeted towards pkers vs pvmers and the lack of equality between the two. I suppose smaller teams would have a better advantage, but that still is more pkers than none.
---
Rip rng
---
Uh. What? I can make it to 2K. I‚Äôd be if I ever levelled combat beyond the 70s. That‚Äôs wholly irrelevant to me thinking a new skill would add to the game however. Always with the pathetic pixel-dick measuring contests when it comes to RuneScape, huh?
---
I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd bring me back to the game immediately. I didn‚Äôt even say that. I‚Äôm on a break. I play the game in periods at my own leisure. I‚Äôve believed the game would gain from that specific skill ever since they first came with the idea.
---
Nothing can be done, it‚Äôs been going on for years at this point
---
I love this post so much. I remember my cousin showing me this game so long again and my first time doing the tutorial. I played and played and played as a free player and pretty much never left lumbridge. I still use the orginal account but just for oldschool but I did log in to my old account to look at my stats they were not good but just seeing it made me think of all the good times just killing goblins back then and nothing more.

Maybe

lol dont get worked up too much about chat head you see for a total of 3 minutes in your entire life.
---
Have you seen zalcano's loot table?
---
Neat I've been wanting something like this for a while. I know specifically I'd make Decisive Battle from Evangelion play instead of Attack 1.
---
Yeah, no. That‚Äôs totally unfair. So pures who only do combat, or skillers who only like 4-5 skills cant have a say on the game, even if the question directly impacts their skill/combat of choice?
---
You can brew in the same tick you attack, just click back on the boss right away
---
¬´We dont want rs3 content¬ª
---
I feel as thought there‚Äôs a large niche to fill with weapons like the dragonbane weapons and Arclight/Keris, this seems like an easy way to expand on that mechanic and perhaps spur adding new weapons that work better against different types of monsters in game.
---
Or give your vote a value equal to your total lvl
---
There's singing bowls in prif. I get my shards from gauntlet/zalcano
---
Well if the question is asking about combat related things and you are a skiller, why should you be allowed to vote on it?
---
It would definitely be harder without seeing it as you'd have to reflect the light down/up and hope you remembered s thing being there. But thats when you could just toggle seeing it back on to double check.
---
Use a singing bowl in prif with both in your inv

Bruh they're literally adding money sinks with every update

Congratulations, you played yourself.

Just checked, it's equivalent to Shilo (11 tiles) but completely free to use. 
---
For comparison, Edgeville is 14 tiles.
---
Ge tax is an awful idea, rather not lose another 10m+ everytime I sell scythe

That‚Äôs not at all what I said but okay

I miss classic scape
---
Like I said. Even if you‚Äôre targeting the PvP vs PvM area you‚Äôre going to have pvmers risking way less or banking way more often resulting in them being at PvM hot spots less often. Experienced pvmers will still escape against solo pkers, and inexperienced pvmers will be risking even less and maybe escape. So really it‚Äôs not beneficial because personally I‚Äôd rather have inexperienced players still have the same chances to escape while risking more and just hope I can kill them or hope they don‚Äôt know how to tank/box or get gap.
---
Unless I'm misunderstanding the wording the poll question #3 is a poll to keep the current rates, and if it fails then to nerf Zolcano down to 50 shards/hr. I was attempting to show that zolcano is barely if even 40/hr as it is from what I can tell. How would it be a nerf then to bring it "down" to 50?
---
Cheers mate.
---
It looks like a dick, but with Fallopian tubes instead of balls.

wasn't that confirmed yesterday when people were getting multiple kills?

During the elves questline you can say you have feelings for Elena and she reciprocates. The sweet talk bits are throwbacks to that. For the finale of the questline, I feel mentioning that is pretty reasonable. It's also funny because we're technically married to prince/ss Miscellenia.
---
Questioning why the player does shit is pretty fair. We're like an incompetent murder hobo in that world, doing random shit for literally everyone, good and evil alike. Considering half the players literally spacebar through every dialogue in the game, it's a little amusing to have.
---
The models are pretty whack, I agree. 
---
I think you're asking from a bit much from a game where penguins formed a clandestine organization based on world domination
---
Now that you know my profession, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt say that what I am saying is ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù considering that I know what the signs of depression are, and study them for a living. Also to make you feel even dumber than you already look, OP already admitted that he is unemployed and plays this game 8 hours a day. And for the third and final dagger in your pathetic internet rant (that is most likely due to problems in your real life that is all spewing out onto me because you lack the self confidence to confront people in the real world who are hurting you), OP gave me some great tips on Runecrafting, and I have already increased three of my levels. Actually had a pretty good conversation on here. 
---
So my piece of advice for you Mr. Grumpy Gills is quit trying to look for reasons in life to be angry or victimized. Especially in situations where you are the only one mad. I hope you have a good day and turn things around in life, and don‚Äôt be afraid to seek help instead of just bottling things up and being angry on the internet.
---
I usually don't care much for fanart but goddamn this is amazing!
---
It's a redemption story. Cool to see him come back from a shitty decision
---
you got me
---
Take me back please
---
I don‚Äôt believe so. People were getting kills in different worlds but it wasn‚Äôt respawning. So people thought it might be a discontinued item and the price shot up quick. Thanks for the response u/kungpowpenis
---
talk with the wise old man he can delete the non usefull quest items, also for the love of god get an authenticator
---
IMO, a new skill to level would add a lot of potentially interesting content. Especially one that bridges a crafting gap for an area of the game that isn‚Äôt. I always liked crafting skills and I think a magical one would be cool. I think there‚Äôs merit to the idea that this could be governed under a different skill(s) but in all honesty I just think a new one adds all kinds of interesting potential. But if I‚Äôm honest I get why people would potentially not be sold on the idea. Jagex‚Äô presentation was a little lackluster at least when first presented.

How much of a difference does elite void make at Vorky? I'm about to start grinding it (89 ranged) but I'm not sure if I should go for elite void first or not. I have a BGS
---
I had to take a few minutes to walk around this place when I first got there, it looks stunning. Unfortunate that they released this on the hottest day of the year though, my GPU was screaming at me to leave the area
---
I'd need to see the droprates to make an educated guess but Probably 40-80m based on its spot in the meta, unless it's absurdly rare like 1/1000 or something, then maybe 100-150m?
---
So stop doing unnecessary changes.
---
Are you complaining about their appearance, existance, or the content they are locked behind?
---
Dude. This is so fucking cool. Please make more!
---
I had the same issue it foxed for me when I turned the slayer plugin off reloging checking my task and turning slayer plugin back on.
---
This made it to the front page of reddit
---
RealisticLOL
---
No I‚Äôm saying using 4 of each resource and making 1-1-2 is has objectively better stats than 0-2-2 in corrupt mode. Not better as in you save some time and inventory space it‚Äôs actually stat wise more effective armor. The extra inventory space is just a bonus
---
Hope so, those are the best kind.
---
U met him at the hentai booth lmao
---
Significant content - *I sleep*
---
Chatheads for like 8 characters changed, a dock added, or a tavern made out of an old house - *Real Shit*
---
If it passes zolcano keeps current rates and everything else is buffed, if it fails rates stay the same except zolcano which gets nerfed. I mean yeah I do think their numbers are inflated but you can just vote yes to that and the rates will go up which is what you want.
---
Lmao, I wasn‚Äôt going south enough and kept walking right past the second one
---
Lol say that about the zulrah helper
---
Warding failed its poll. You can be upset but appreciate the polling system helps filter out content that doesn't fit the game.
---
This elf rework was never polled. We should all be in an uproar that the polling system was completely bypassed, throwing the integrity of old school to the side.
---
The polling system is what makes this game so great. I think it deserves a lot more respect than it gets and people need to stop bitching about it.
---
You can turn them into death runes though.
---
Omygod shes doing the pikachu face
---
What would be the proposed improvements?
---
Most who want an improved client have already switched to runelite. Even those who want a minimally upgraded client use runelite but then turn off certain plugins. Jagex likely wouldn't be able to add any thing that stumps runelite, and any original client changes would likely make more players angry than happy, as most who use the old client do so purposefully to have a more barebones experience.
---
How do you not have an Authenticator
---
No explanation to how it‚Äôs done but the same type of thing is in game already - poison splats on the ground at olm you can run over by skipping the tile, but the same thing at xarpus in tob damages you if you run over em
---
What‚Äôs wolhat?
---
A suggestion I saw in another thread yesterday that worked for me was to turn music off in-client. That cleared the frame drops right up. My FPS was still down, but it was no longer 5FPS with the client damn near crashing.
---
Hahahaha.... Wow!
---
Clicked on his name, did a search for 'kid' and got 23 hits on 1 page lmao
---
Mith darts arnt worth using since u still burn scales to use em. Use addy darts.
---
If you have some construction level, store outfits in your POH. Also get an authenticator you dip.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head friend. I didn‚Äôt play Halo, but watched Red Vs. Blue when YouTube was the shit. Eventually decided to try Halo and I contribute that in part to RvB.
---
Thank you I never knew this but it was needed knowledge.
---
Or u might get mugged like rigondeaux
---
Have drop parties until your bank is empty, then start from scratch.
---
Can you show your numbers of where you think 1.4 is wrong? Through a variety of posts it looks to be accurate best I can tell.

The above range from \~1.22 - 1.64/kc. So maybe it's more like 1.5 but still, I'd think it's a fairly accurate assumption. If you have proof otherwise I'd appreciate seeing it.
---
As to the gauntlet's viability in general. Shards will always be in need though depending on how many you can get from the variety of activities it's possible to have a surplus over time. I'd think as they're only a plus to potions though there'll really never not be demand for them so their effective "price" based on the dust is likely to be relatively stable. My only guess to the average loot being mediocre is they assumed the "rare" loot will compensate and/or didn't want to reward an activity with no risk too heavily. As you aren't even allowed to use your own supplies it's pure profit, just a time burn.
---
Like..cities IRL or a Varrock and Lumbridge cities. It would be cool to change voice chat rooms while entering different cities in game. Like native proximity VC but...not.
---
It's an established mechanic that has been this way since osrs came out.
---
WTF what happened?
---
No both sides are just dedicated. It takes less than 2minutes to return so if its 20v20, you wont ever clear the other team. Youd have to kill 20 in 2minutes. So what happens is the loser is what ever team gives up first.
---
The game has moved on from launch, the idea that stuff has to stay the same nearly killed osrs back then and is still holding it back.
---
Potentially. I can't say if it does or doesn't yet but hopefully it only uses a charge on a hit like some other weapons do. That'd make it more reasonable though still fairly short lived compared to other weapons.
---
Why would it be so much less than the rapier?
---
Anguish is useless at vork since you use salve. That said it is a big upgrade for other stuff, so you should probably get one anyway. Rigour is really big for killing vorkath so it should come first. You could buy pegasians on the way to being able to afford rigour, selling the boots when you need to. DHCB is also really good in that it lets you do 4-5 kill trips depending on loot. After that you can get pegasians or the dragonfire ward. The ward is better for vorkath, but you don't really use it anywhere else. The pegs will serve you better if you do other ranging. With the ward and pegs you will be in max gear. The only thing to improve would be your range level, if you aren't 99.
---
Right. It still has charges, but the stats don‚Äôt go down with lower charges.
---
Blowpipe is literally the most broken item in the game so comparing it to that is silly. Compared to msb it does seem a bit weaker than it should be.
---
 &gt;maybe you shouldn‚Äôt say that what I am saying is ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù considering that I know what the signs of depression are, and study them for a living.
---
playing 2-3 hours a day is a sign of a depression whereas asking socially inept and condenscending questions on a runescape forum, of all places, isnt? its baseless because all you had to go on was 99 rc in "3 months straight"(which can be achieved very easily while studying/working) before you made your uneducated assumption.
---
&gt;OP already admitted that he is unemployed and plays this game 8 hours a day.
---
you didnt know this when you asked your moronic questions. ever heard of a correlation? do you go around asking most people with 99s if theyre unemployed because their time invested on a video game is indicative of depression or unemployement? and then what do you do with that information? god damn illiterate buffoon; your stupidity is insulting.
---
Forreal, if people haven‚Äôt seen it they should check it out
---
very true

Not sure what you want to achieve with this post, whether it's just showing off that you're different or trying to convince others, but just vote for someone you think should win.
