Well there goes my quest cape
---
Yes because someone who has 10s of millions of gp to throw away can sink it all into hydra in konar and make millions of gp as long as they want. Stupid idea. 
---
Its all here... in your head... and runecrafting will help you on the way to maxing, no doubt about that.... no? well... better be.... AGILITY!!!!!

It's called programmed thoughts. You can tell they're NPC's when you compare Settled to the other content creators, and realise that their content is basically the same.

People over exaggerate MEP2. It's literally 45min quest with staminas and a quest quide.

So what no skipping with points anymore?

At least in the states violating a games terms of service is not unlawful, but puts users at risk of losing their accounts. As long as someone posts that they you have to understand they are not at all liable and you are...then they’re usually fine. 
---
Imagine training prayer at a POH in 2019
---
At 74+ farming you get about 90-100k xp/hr at tithe farm while getting the outfit. It’s a win win to get the outfit and other items. Getting the outfit will not hinder your gameplay. Who cares though, it’s just a game.

Quest is needed for hard clue so a few of us like myself begrudgingly did it

Congratulations, /u/Sloob . To the top you go

I DON'T SEE IT YET REEEE
---
Hadn't really thought about the Gp scaling too much. But i'm probably gonna assume maybe 500k or more at 99. As people have stated, if you get Hydra tasks, you can just make easily make money back and keep skipping
---
So it was a lie.

So this isn’t the right place? 
---
That's pretty much any skill in RuneScape lol
---
Ok, imagine i hit under 10 for so many hits (the number of stakes doesnt matter as its also dependent on the duration of the stakes and so the opposing players hits) then the odds are much more likely that ill hit big during the next hits. Not guarenteed, but more likely. Therefore if you wait until you hit low for an extended period of time and then switch to bigger stakes, or even the martingale system, you will end up winning theoretically. Obviously this wont happen every time, but its more likely than just doubling up and hoping.
---
Jagex sent me a mini poster when they modded my pure back in 2006. That's the only thing I've ever seen given away, and it was under the radar.
---
Im not tho lol i genuinely didnt know they were called “warm gloves” not pyro gloves. Then pointed out he still got pieces of the mini game armor before the pet
---
Yes.
---
Wtf chill!
---
literally did the same thing a few months ago but didn't make front page :thinking:
---
You are aware that this wasn't possible since the release of combat dummy and spec pool so about 1.5-2 years ago. 
---
Damn, beat me to it
---
So I was thinking about how the current farming guild works with their contracts. I have a plan as to how it would work lore wise for runecrafting, but essentially, a person would task you with going out and crafting X amount of runes of a specific type (You'd only be given tasks of runes you have the level for), and in return you'd get points towards the shop, and maybe some bonus experience.
---
What is it supposed to be, then? Is it not based on RS? Do other MMOs have slayer skills? Makes sense I guess
---
The game doesn't even use your gpu

Not so fast

Calling u/swampcomments

I was talking about in general, rather than this specific video. The fact that I wake up on Wednesdays and I know it's Swampletics day speaks enough to me

Can someone tell me what "2007scape" is? I always see this subreddit but have no idea what it is. I'm interested tho 
---
Posting new swampletics = instant karma
---
This guy is so fucking popular, what the fuck
---
Nope. You can get duplicate totem pieces by leaving a piece on the ground. People use this to continue getting pieces when they already have all three, but have banked some of them and don't want to bank right away.
---
You say that like it unfair you need combat stats for a quest...

If doing hard contracts, should I have a potato cactus preplanted instead of a regular cactus?
---
Actually in general I'd like to know what the recommended pre-plants are, and the like guidelines on skipping. I've been super inefficient and planting what they ask and only skipping when I don't have the seed. Should I pre-plant say, a magic or yew tree and then only check it when I know I won't be at the guild for a while, and then if I get a maple contract just skip it?
---
What are the most common hard farming contracts, so that I can pre-plant whatever it is? Right now I have a poison ivy bush that I'm actively harvesting from, same with a potato cact, plant herbs every herb run, and snape grass/watermelon + a celastrus.

He explains shit very well. Like how he was explaining the barrows drop table and rates. 
---

---
So how does this work? Graador just never hits you?
---
Oh gotcha, I didn’t know you could get duplicates as long as you leave it on the ground. I’m missing the top so I figured it was just because I killed them on the same tick.

Im happy now.

Another pro is that while exploring, f2p will see morytania, this super cool haunted place, just on the other side of this cool temple. They can see something that they would get from membership right across the river.
---
can confirm this happened
---
doesn't matter really, but you're gonna need a little bit of money if you wanna train firemaking. If you're planning to do both at the same time you can do that too, but it won't be too efficient
---
I did long ago, my justification was always I made 20/hr so I can buy 25m or w.e for 1 hour of time or spend 8 hours at zulrah. As someone who worked fulltime and had plenty of extra cash and not free time it worked well. Then I realized no matter how much cash I had the fun was in earning it. Even with 500m I was just trying to earn more. Alas I no longer do because it does not create more fun.

Yes, it also ruins the gameplay and the general purpose of the game.

Can give a make all/fletch all/ Enchant all but not an option to dig up a plant? smh
---
I straight up missed out on an hespori kill because the weeds 1ticked me and prevented planting. I didn't realize it at the time and was like oh neat the hespori gave me a seed back.
---
Im not sure if you mean "west of fally" as only the small amount of land between falador and the sea, or *literally all* last to the west of falador, such as burthrope, underground pass, castle wars, etc

I demand clarification god dammit

Yeah but what's the point then? Might as well dry up your bank account and do all the fastest skilling methods so you max.

hey look, a wild repost has popped up

i guess it's finally time for you to complete quest now :)

you could train your WCing to 60 and fletching to 65 and make a Yew Shortbow. There are Yew Trees south of the Ghost Port and north of Slepe.

Lol how do you figure that a few 70 stats is elite? Or even that if it is for elite players, that is pointless? Not that I even agree this constitutes elite lol, but the idea that just because it is high level content means it is pointless is laughable.

yeah, kills me how mind numbingly boring most of them are.

In some situation definitely, in others maybe not. Maybe some people really enjoy end game content such a TOB. Instead of investing 500 hours, they can auto click in NMZ and spend $100 USD and have everything they need in probably around 40-50 hours of actually gameplay. Time is all relative, an hour to someone may seem like nothing, but to others they may only have 4 hours a week of free time. 
---
I don’t condone it, but not everyone has the time/commitment to the OSRS grind like other do but enjoy some of the content the game offers. 
---
I've seen builds similar to this back when people where dumb, and did staking outside of maxed levels.
---
It was common to build 70 attack, 70 def and 45 str for armor staking. You'd just throw on whip and Barrows once the stake started.
---
I'm not saying it's a good idea i'm just saying accusing him of running a ponzi scheme is kinda outlandish.

Seems so strange to me lmao, like why not...the reqs are really not that high

Gz on the 99 though!
---
If you’re buying gold you most likely don’t care about maxing. Just Sand Casino or some endgame context. Rare cases maybe you are just trying to flex on some noobs for some self esteem

Why'd you delete the post? Hahaha everyone caught you out on your lies so you had to try and cover it up, classic

Raids still have the twisted items, elder maul, and ancestral robes. The scrolls should be removed just like how the shortsword, harpoon, and throwing weapons were.

Smithing is 70 for ds2, 91 for ardy elite, 90 for kandarin elite, 88 for lumb elite and a few other high level stuff. Mining has 70 for frem elite, 70 for western elite, 72 for my arm/qpc and only high level mining req is 85 for wildy elite, which I'm sure thered a good chunk of people who won't do anyways since spooky wildy. I'll give you hunter tho 60 for quest (mm2) and 69 for western hard diary.

It's pretty much crystalmathlabs but in a table which I think is a little more presentable for a quick overview (though admittedly not anywhere near as in depth as CML)

Can't link to it because of subreddit's link whitelist (intending on raising it with the mods if the page gets enough interest - I'd like to track other user data to as I feel it's a nice quick overview), but here's a screenshot from a few hours ago: https://i.imgur.com/Kg0zeps.jpg

I remember reading an [interview](https://www.tip.it/runescape/times/view/39-the-exclusive-zezima-interview) Tip It did with him years ago. The part that stuck with me was him training crafting, prayer and herblore via killing 49k blue dragons which he had figured out to be the most efficient method at the time.
---
Another couple of things that stuck out to me on a re-read was 831 hours of fire runes for 91 runecrafting and the fact that a lot of his training was done in classic which was much slower - especially the bank notes system which he references.
---
Hunter is actually quite fast though? red Salamanders are like 80k-90k per hour. 
---
Lol r/nfl leaking
---
Thank god for this. Thank you, god. 
---
If you wanted and assuming you have access to skills necklaces, I think the Fishing Guild is just as far of a run as the Ardy teleport is (might be a tad longer) and you can take the Gnome Glider to white wolf and run to catherby patch (again, might be slightly longer) and all you would have to do is recharge 1 necklace every 2-3 runs (56 runs per invent) 
---
But it’s also up to you and how your account is set up. I have it to where I can manage to do a farm run if I’m on any spellbook because it’s a hassle to change your spellbook off ancients and back onto ancients when doing slayer. You could have all the necessary Lunar teleports in your house and just stay on Standard if you want, but it just depends on how you prefer to do things
---

Nah dude ::teleport

I can't wait until most people realize that a 70 agility requirement on an elf quest is basically a soft 99 agility requirement + summer pies to have a 20% chance to succeed whatever hell puzzle obstacles they're currently concocting at Jagex HQ.

Hey everyone. How do I return to corsair Cove ? Ive complete the corsair curse quest and I used to get there by talking to cabin boy colin on the northern dock in Port Sarim. After the update where they moved Veos from the south dock to the northern cabin boy colin is no longer on the ship for me.
---
He can train fletching to 80 and make a magic shortbow from magic logs dropped from skeletons in tarns lair. 
---
Options are certainly available. 
---
it is a charter ship you just pay with time 
---
I got my quest cape a few weeks ago. I just need 2 herblore levels which I'll probably get just from cleaning herbs on farm runs by the time it comes out
---
Figured Team Blue Cape needed a new chemical
---
That place doesn’t exist haven’t you heard 
---
Not at all trying to compete with CML, the page is just an introductory learning project to PHP and MySQL for me, but I feel that the information is presented a bit better in the table I've made for those that aren't interested in EHP and just want a quick overview without anything too flashy.
---
Raids 2 is more like 10-15m/hr
---
Agreed, but 'engine work'

That’s very weird.

Irl the bank reversed transactions and it doesn’t matter.

It's free with a ring of charos (a)yyy
---
It often peaks at over 100k players a day. It’s free to play and completely online. 
---
It’s similar to WoW in that it’s an open world with quests, skills and boss fight content. But it is much much simpler in its play style. 
---
F2P exists but it is still seem as a demo for the full game really, hard to say what RuneScape is similar to, kind of has its own vibe.
---

---
I mean there's already a quest with a 65 def requirement.
---
Settled saw a market for well thought out and produced content and ran for it. His success is deserved. 
---
Currently #39 on /r/all
---
Thanks so much! Just a note - the formula for "xp to 99" in the prayer sheet is wrong. It currently subtracts the xp to 99, from the total xp in a 99 level skill, which means the number of required bones goes up the higher the level you have!  
---
  
---
The formula was: =ArrayFormula(ROUNDUP((getXpByLevel(99) - Stats!$F$17) / $C2:$C))  
---
The formula should be: =ArrayFormula(ROUNDUP((Stats!$F$17) / $C2:$C))
---
Im not op, but wondering if you know how much better the bludgeon is over an abby dagger with a d def?
---
Mmm cock 😊
---
A lot of you won't really care about this as the ardy silk stalls are they way to go really but why can you only examine the silk stall in Al kharid?
---
If you're able to steal from silk stalls, then it should just be all silk stalls, not ones in a certain location 
---
That's like saying you can cut a tree in lumbrige but you're not allowed to cut any in draynor (its just an example. I know you can) 
---
So if you can steal from silk stalls and unlock the ability to steal from silk stalls, they should all have the option to steal from them
---

Did this guy think he would get upvotes for saying something stupid?

Prezleek would be the name of that comic artist

What would you use it for?

So true. I got my first 99 after 13 years of on and off play last weekend and ended up with another two days after. Probably won’t play for a while but I’ve been riding that high for 3 days now.
---
I know that the ancient maces spec can go over your max prayer
---
I am not sure as i haven't used an alt in a while but to try and combat this you can make two seperate runelite accounts so that the presets are saved to each account but you would have to login each time you switch accounts. 
---
idk if this works it's just a suggestion
---
Same I gasped when I saw that dharok hit him. 
---
Do runs between the shop in Mort'on and Burgh the Rott. Planks are 1 gp each.
---
Agreed on MEP2, but that being a requirement was kind of unavoidable considering Song of the Elves is a sequel to it
---
They already discussed on stream a while ago that they would eventually poll superior elves on slayer tasks that would have a chance at dropping Eternal Elf Teleport Crystals 
---
Such a low chance of getting that particular bow, especially with only 5 brothers. I don't think it's very sustainable to do that.
---
I have mine set exactly how you wish yours to be: It just flashes red to notify me, I'm not sure I've ever seen a message box pop up that covers my screen. 
---
So it's definitely possible to just have it flash red
---
If he eventually gets 75 slayer why couldn't he do gargoyles?
---
https://twitter.com/JagexKieren/status/705428283509366785  
---
this is the evidence. basically with each roll, first you check for a unique item drop, and if you don't get it, choose a number between 1 and your potential reward.  
---
each non-unique roll rewards a random amount of one item type, so a roll of 881-884 could be 1 bolt rack, 885-888 2 bolt racks, up to 1002-1005 which could be 40, et cetera. with 6 brothers killed you have 6 rolls meaning it is possible for multiple rolls to reward you with the same item type.
---
e.g. if you get ~200 blood runes from a single chest it's not a single reward giving you 200 blood runes, it's probably 5 or 6 rewards giving you 35-40 each, totalling 200, but the game interface doesn't show that though.  
---
so each time you get bolt racks, those bolt racks could have been runes instead which with the exception of mind runes, are worth more than bolt racks.
---
You must have forgot I don't giv a fuck mate
---
It may be because I play on Mac

How does it feel being the first player to actually want Torags hammers?

---
She is thousands of years old and her memory is not all there. Thus we can repeat the same story over and over as she just forgot over the course of the week. 
---
No you're right, so yes I do mean mainly us/Europe. My point is just that I think for those who were born in late 90s/early 2000s see 2007 as so long ago as if it was the beginning of technology. I was born in 91. And yes I realize people every era before you say it about the next lol but I strongly believe the difference between the 90s era and now is much more of a gap vs previous. And the 90s had a lot of revolutionary stuff to. Now THAT was the old msdot days, floppy disk days to boot up your pc, command prompt days before windows to play games, etc. 2007 had a bloody xbox 360 and 1080p LCD tv's lol. Now runescape classic is a diff story. Honestly I think by the time rs2 came out i had a flat screen - I cant fully remember but I'm pretty sure I did. Loved my crt monitor days though, playing hours on end of Diablo 2 LOD. Fuck me d2 was so good. Morrowind, baulders gate..ah the days. And some original RS.

You are crazy if you think it won't, lmao. They are already making content before it passes polls. Look at Priff, Hosidious house rework, and even Kebos. Before Kebos passed it was already made and fully designed. With Priff, the entire layout, rewards, and even art assets were created and it hadn't passed yet. Hosidious house rework isn't even polled yet and Mod West ha spent months creating it from the ground up. 
---
If you think for a second that Warding isn't going to pass, either legitimately or not, you are insane.

Are you fixing the 0's too? If an item is inactive in RSB (you'd think this only happens when it's not traded, but it happens from time to time with items that are traded a lot, although I don't know the reason). Over 1000 items display 0 at the moment. That's the real issue with RSB, their up-time is pretty good, but if you run an UrlFetch request for every of the missing 1000+ values, you will exceed the 6 minute script execution time.

Can I boost my attack to temporarily wield a dragon axe? Need it for a master clue scroll but only have 56 attack atm.
---
&gt; since RL hasn't made their own yet.
---
It's not that they haven't made one, it's that they don't want one as part of RuneLite. IIRC Adam feels it would be more easily abused  to manipulate prices than OSB's due to RL being more accessible.
---
What is it?
---
Kinda? The default action for an OS is to keep playing. Generally this kind of mute is done application-side.
---
Not sure how I'd do this without changing runelite's code
---
I bought the exact amount of nats to alches, and you can see i have left over nats.
---
The value of the alches comes to 2,168,160 GP and you can see i do not have that gp.
---
I lost 59 onyx bolts that would of alched for 531k, which is what i am missing from the total gp that i should have.
---
I was alching and training agility, but decided to afk alch for a few mins while i was watching a YT video and looked back and had no alchs left. I even ran around the track one more time to confirm they were not on the ground but i am very confused to this happening i have never seen anything disappear before and tho its not a huge loss, i have those items for profit for a reason.

I really wish the mods would remove the obvious karma whoring shitposts though..i dont even know who the mods are for this sub. Ive never seen one comment.

A game mode you officially opt into that isn't about gaining an advantage and a player choice to keep combat low are not at all similar. You're free to make any combat build you want but it doesn't need to be able to do every piece of content. Buffing pures which are already "overpowered" does hurt other players.

Stop reposting this.. saw you post the same thing earlier.

I'd love a whole thread about stuff like this. I started playing Runescape classic for about 4 weeks before RS2 launched and took over so most of this stuff was before my time. Its really interesting.

Wow you're great. Thank you!

TFW the Jmods take time on the Q&amp;A to discuss changes posed by the community that literally would only exist to give Swampletics new cape color options

Konar (which autocorrects to ‘Jonathan’ on my phone ???) is pretty good for money and especially at your current level; the downside of course is that she can assign you some pretty lacklustre tasks that may take quite a while to complete. Nieve is as good a money maker as your slayer level is (higher the better), but overall will get you a better xp rate than Konar.
---
As to when you should switch, many people advise to move on as soon as you have access to the master, but you might find that getting your combat level a bit higher than the requirement helps with the speed of your tasks. If you are using Konar though, I can’t imagine that the difficulty of Nieve’s tasks would be any more severe than hers.

Added challenge while also being able to define your own path. Basically the same reason you would do a normal iron man but to a more extreme level. Region locked iron men can actually be interesting to watch because they usually use dead content and it’s refreshing

No. Time of the offers does not really matter for bulk offers. They are all put into the same pool, sort of.

Yes, you can. 3t just makes you roll the chance to gather more often, your success rate is irrelevant. GL on your speedrun

i remember watching the first video, and he was like "yep, thats how this channel is going to go. If you don't like it, you can stop watching"
---
and i did. Didn't really seem like a great snowflake build imo
---
The comments suggest this was duel arena. My first thought was hacked
---
Tbow is less DPS than scythe. Graardor doesnt have high magic dmg
---
&gt;The level of priority given to an older offer is influenced by how much older the offer is. Offers that are days older will receive near absolute priority, while offers that are placed around the same time might split about 75%/25% in favor of the older offer. So offers placed around the same time at exactly the same price roughly take turns.

Common misconception - [the RDT is it's own drop table](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rare_drop_table), it has nothing to do with a drops price or anything along that line. So to answer your question, no, it won't increase the chance of an Emblem drop

Have you ever gotten a farming contract of something which has it's patch already occupied with something growing? It's essentially drawing a "lose your turn" card and I've had to wait the next day just to resume a contract several times even when using the 2 contract resets. 
---
That's one of the reasons why I would want to dig up plants. I don't see that much reason why not to implement it, I guess you could exploit it for small XP gains? I sure as hell wouldn't want to train farming that way.

Yes but you need to bear in mind that you need a way to tick manipulate. Guam tar can be made at 19 herblore or you can get 32 crafting to put kebbit claw on some leather vambs. I think the newest way to do it is celastrus bark with 40 fletching.

Are you serious? Let's say we share experience with our partners... What's stopping me and my buddy or even my alt and going to Nechryaels or Smoke devils and gaining 200K slayer xp/hr as the new meta? It's even worse if it didn't share killcount because you'd essentially double your slayer task. Come on man, use your brain for a second.

It **shouldn't** share XP or KC.

I just started the trek of getting all the hard dairies done and i think I'll also feel that sense of not knowing what to do next once i get them done. 
---
Melee and range defense are based solely on defense level and defense bonuses. Attack bonuses  and levels don't matter.
---
Magic is a bit different. It's like 70/30 magic and defense levels and then factors in magic defense bonuses.
---
In the Warlords case I think he'd be pretty weak to magic because his magic level is so low and his defense level counts less against magic.

More of a callback to the previous comment that this is about if you'd rather have your bank pin stolen or your RS pin. He said his bank pin cause his bank will have his back. You clarified that the bank will reimburse him but not go to that extent. I brought it back saying his point stands that losing your bank pin would be better because your bank still does more than jogger flex even given your correction. Of course that's a joke, because even tho your bank does more you also lose a lot more from compromising your bank account.

Sharing KC wouldn't be the end of the world, but it would halve your effective experience for a task, punishing you for doing slayer with a friend while also doubling your effective rate of slayer points. Imagine two people using expeditious bracelets on a task, you finish tasks in like 50 kills.

Ofc you should buy it -_- if you have cash laying around buy it. It has a 15% damage boost, its more accurate and it has a 15% chance saving runes which makes barraging and bursting 15% less expensive. Go for it my dude. Besides its price is kinda stabile atm meaning that you can sell it back.

You should do it Zeah &gt; Ecto &gt; Cabbage &gt; Ardy &gt; Weiss &gt; Troll &gt; Catherby &gt; Farm Guild
---
in that order. There's a reason why that way is the best, partly because the Ecto tool leper is far away from the herb patch, so you can pick your herbs at ecto, plant, then tele directly to fally farm, and while running to the herb patch you pass a tool leper on the way, so you can note your herbs from ecto here, farm falador, tele to ardy farm, etc.
---
You end up saving at least 6 seconds regardless by not having to note herbs at ectophial, which is the most inefficient farm patch.

---
Swampletics is playing a very restrictive version of the game, and people enjoy watching the interesting ways he gets around his limitations.  
---
Specifically, he is playing as an ultimate ironman, meaning he can’t trade with other players or store items in the bank - he’s got to carry everything around or leave it (to despawn). Trading is valuable because it lets you specialize in one trade and skip working in all areas - making unpopular skills like runecrafting profitable for those who train them up high. Ironmen have to make everything themselves, so it’s harder.  
---
Besides this, he’s sticking to one area of the map, so he can’t access all the different quests/resources on the map, so he’s even more limited in what he can produce/use. The difficulty and cool tricks, I think, makes his videos so interesting.

If you're an iron though and have run out of watermelon seeds for whatever reason, weeds are good for compost.

It’s not better go than herbs. Op is tripping. A yanillion hop run will make you 90-110k gp per run. That’s still great money considering it’s just 4 patches but it’s still not as profitable as a single herb run lol.
---
i mean i get the argument your making, but thats runescape if that bothers you why are you watching for any runescape content in terms of difficulty because it can all come down to rng or flicking. you kind of just have to take it with a grain of salt and enjoy it for what it is.

i mentioned the quest bosses that swampletics fought, not because they were hard, but because they were entertaining and maybe thats where you and I differ.

You sound like difficulty is a factor for you in whether or not you're enjoying the video when thats just simply not the case for me. I dont watch settled because he's doing something hard or grindy. i watch him because of the way he frames it and the content he is doing is so fun. I love watching him having to learn how to play the game.
---
When watching his series, he often skips over the grinds almost completely. he gives the bare minimum required to give us the why and what for the grind, the moves on to learning and figuring out new things.

Doesn’t have to be hydra boss for diary. You don’t need a task.

Are rune arrows worth the price hike from adamant arrows for range training?

Dopamine is associated with wanting, serotonin with liking. The anticipation of the reward (e.g. looking at the tomes he's gathering from temple trekking) would release dopamine, whereas the getting of the reward (in this case reading the tomes and getting the XP drops) would release serotonin.

For actual PvM and skilling you don't really want a massive resolution game screen since much of the game is played through the inventory and minimap. So having your inventory and minimap relatively close to your character is generally preferred.

There’s no bridge. You can just walk across it. I did the same thing when I did the quest there lol

I think you just have the wrong conception then. Meta in any game is just the best thing you can reasonably do, but not always the one everyone often does. I mean if youve ever played any competitive game most people dont play the meta often because they dont know the meta. However as long as the meta is the best and its reasonable, then its meta. Considering bond prices of 3m right now which is legit a little over an hour at vork for two whole weeks of membership an alt is not unreasonable. Now paying someone else to do it, it would depend which update once again. If you chose the "create more killcount" itd absolutely be meta. It wouldnt be expensive to have someone partner yo ufor like 5 seconds so yo ucan get your task with extra kc.
---
\&gt; I don't see the problem in updates that "benefit" players with a lot of gp or real life friends haha. It's an MMORPG, you *should be* rewarded for bringing friends in. If you don't have friends and want to spend GP to other players for whatever benefit, then that's still part of what being an MMO is.   
---
No one ever stated MMORPGS are meant to benefit social players. Most modern MMORPGs encourage social activities without forcing you to maintain personal relationships for a benefit. For example WoW LFR. Are the raids social? Yes. Do I have to keep some kind of personal relationships just so I can do my raiding weekly? Fuck no. Not even for hardcore progression, just submit you application for a good guild and if youre good enough youre in and show up for raid. Dont need to be personal with anyone. And honestly it is better that way. If you wanna be social you can, but it isnt made to be a necessity (with how impactful this sort of change would be, it WOULD be a necessity). Now updates that benefit players with more GP is a gray zone. People dont want everything to be "pay more, be done quicker" because it can ruin the pacing of the game (yes they could just NOT pay extra, but no one is going to cripple themselves to pretend they are enjoying the game more). This is why people like things like barrows gloves being strong and make fun of combat bracelets. You cant just \*buy\* barrows gloves. Now that being said paying for better rates is still a thing in a lot of skills, its just a balance. As it is slayer already has it: cannoning. So why would we make it even faster for richer players. Not to mention we arent talking a slight advantage here, its pretty big. Either halfing their KC time (same KC but shared) which doubles their point rate, or more than doubling their KC time (double the KC, but shared WITH bracelets of slaughter) which gives a hard to calculate, but significant xp bonus. Basically, when being rich already gives you a huge benefit in slayer (like massive, cannoning is so fast) why give them yet another speedy method with no benefit to normal players.

Stop making up shit unfunny posts, maybe?
---
In a full cc, one qp turns into pages and pages of spam. Gotta nip it in the bud
---
This was added because you get xp for planting seeds and on farming release people were power farming by planting/digging up stockpiled seeds
---
Or just ban it in the inferno like purple sweets?
---
I had 70kc and 4 items before the collection book was out, they weren’t in the log. Besides 400 kc and that low of bolts? What ya doin not even killin a brother and getting 88%+
---
Saved
---
Are we all just forgetting Lynx Titan??? Man spent like what, 9 years getting the highest accomplishment in osrs
---
1. Yeah but no one likes talking also around 80% of players aree bots or people on several accounts at the same time.
---
2. It's free to play.
---
3. It's similar to cookie clicker.

Imagine the flex. Rangers and arma helm would be such a grind, but also so sick.

First thing I thought of too.

*OwO, what's this? * It's your **1st Cakeday** Pika_DJ! ^(hug)
---
Mist staff and tome of fire is the way to go. Gives you everything except earth. If you have con cape and don't care about the normal trees because they're suboptimal for people who don't want 200m, you don't need the earth runes for teleports ever anyway. You can get by on the home tele on the rare occasion that you need the Lumbridge tele.
---
Yeah I will just get my scythe out to get bandos xd
---
No, if ive got a tree growing (usually yew) and it asks for a maple or magic ill just skip it. the level of contract barely matters 
---
No thanks.
---
&gt;I think it would a great opportunity for veterans to get away from all of the bots and spam in Varrock.
---
Total worlds (mostly) solve this issue.
---
There's a runelite  plugin for that.
---
I'm gonna be so heartbroken if he gives up, the series is gonna start getting really exciting around chapter ~6
---
I once got 5 greater abyssals from a task of 203 in slayer tower
---
Found a pic later. 70 agility hunter and herblore I think 
---
This is just kiting
---
Hence the meme.
---
What's your farming level? Which trees do you do?
---
I'd recommend just doing herbs and papaya once a day. More herbs if you want as well as the farming contracts. Otherwise, don't bother with normal trees. They're too expensive unless you plan on getting 200m.
---
Yeah, tens of thousands probably
---
Been touched on by them before on q@a, the tracking between partners has the same limitation thats going to be improved with the engine updates for group ironman and update clan system, so most likely it wont be touched till after these updates
---
Exactly this and the above comment, first time I did it it was hovering above the theoretical because I hadn't accounted for residual exp
---
Probably not... he had no idea what he was doing. Put zero time into learning about the game or how to present a series. Gave little indication on goals or things to look forward to.
---
This was one of the worst attempts at a series yet
---
If you have really bad gear to begin with, then get the body and legs first. Otherwise, it really makes no difference, 'cause you'll want all the pieces anyway
---
&gt; Use 8 poison ivy for payment on the calquat tree.
---
I should do that on my ironman for a bit. I've stocked up a few thousand whiteberries for super def since I never considered the poison ivy for calquats. Thanks for the reminder!
---
You can try altscaping.
---
For example, fishing Lobsters is 50k per hour. If you fish on 4 accounts, then you would get approximately 200k per hours.

I think that's the joke..

No

---
r/wooosh
---
13 def pures can get in i think

Hes right in a way. If eoc wasnt so disgustingly bad at release we wouldnt have osrs 
---
3 giants keys (1/128 drop rate) at only 25 kills.
---
Nice 
---
Go watch from the start.
---
I went through the whole playlist as I did Canifis agility. I'm level 58 agility and I think I started at level 54.
---
Gang bang
---
Waterfall quest is the most bang for your buck quest in the game so do that first 
---
I would pick a few skills and focus on that for the first 14 days while making cash and also do some quests at the same time to give everything else a boost
---
IMO you have 3 choices , pick pocketing while aiming for 50 agility to get rogues set , Blast furnace - also benefits from agi and killing skogres and zogres that trains up your range and is decent money especially if you gamble on the chests and wait it out on the ge for a bit .
---
Imo go with pickpocketing , you can do agi too - Recruitment Drive, The Tourist Trap (using experience on Agility two times) and The Grand Tree  and shoot for a rogues set for double the money , then if you get bored of pick pocketing you can also do blast furnace and that also benefits from your agility .
---
That's the point I'm trying to make though, most furries or bronies don't think what happened at Rainfurrest was right, or even funny. Any furry I've talked to sees rainfurrest as an unfortunate incident where yet again a very loud (in a different sense) minority caused a lot of ruckus and associated themselves with the furry community, as far as anyone knows the people who did the majority of damage to that convention may not of even associated themselves with furries.
---
I understand where you're coming from with people dressing up in animal suits is weird, but who are they really harming by dressing up and having fun with their friends? the way I see it it's no different than going to a fancy dress party, or a halloween party and laughing at yourself and having a good time.
---
I definitely do understand that some people take their obsession with this fandom _way too far_ and alienate a lot of people, but those people aren't accepted or held up as an icon for the community, largely they are mocked or just silently rejected by the majority of people with common sense.
---
Now he just needs 4 phones. :)

But besides being accurate it sucks. Buffing it to average is op? It's still not gonna be close to blowpipe dps with that boost.

He's right tho. Swampletics is the unitest unit
---
TIL. /s
---
how do I get over my anxiety of doing group pvm? I so badly don't want to be the guy who is inconveniencing everyone else due to lack of experience that I have yet to even set foot in GWD or raids
---
Of course it's worth it
---
Very cool! Wanted to make it myself for a very long time, glad you made it.
---
Maybe you can add a curve for the book of knowledge? And maybe an everage of both since they have an equal chance of happening? 
---
Why are you getting the seal?
---
paterdomus?
---
I actually don't mind tears of guthix, I get that the exp is slow but is runecrafting really that bad?
---
I mean games necklaces are easy to come by, quests are fun and buff your experience/hr.
---
If they just made it a daily cool down rather than weekly then runecrafting would actually be bearable.
---
Grr 
---
Rainbow boots, dskirt, bandos chest, dragon defender, dscim, savage? gloves, idk what the head is, also glory. Did I do it? 
---
Still better than DisneyMTXscape
---
Did you use an equation to work this out, or just do it manually (as it is only 42 levels so probably wouldnt be too much effort to do manually)? If so, what was the equation. Too tired right now to work it out myself :P 
---
You can make fire runes too. They are good XP with dueling rings

Keep going it's not too bad of a dry streak mate
---
I can't say I speak for everyone but people watch all kinds of stuff as they like different things. Some guys are genuinely entertaining and their commentary in streams makes the play through better. Some are just lazy and don't want to play themselves but still watch the game in a little bit similar way as watching tv series. I mean people watch documentaries, ceremonies, politics and everything. There are also some lonely souls who enjoy their only human interaction through monitor for unknown reasons. And it's completely normal to not like something.

is there any way to get the smoldering stone back from my infernal axe?
---
So did you yet half the updates that come out things ironmen ask for to make things easier. Soft clay, sandstone and so on.  Pures don't even want updates catered to them like ironman get. They just want a chance to participate in content as is having zero effect on anyone else.
---
Is this Settled on different account?
---
Id say that some content is dead content because it's not meta but still okay (like Pollnivneach and Rellekka agility courses), and other dead content is just utterly useless. I would put the dark wizard's tower in the latter category
---
lmao pures do inferno. Pures would have easily done mm2(which they should have been allowed to do) and ds2(which obviously shouldn't have been available to them).
---
To actually answer your question: as you discovered already, no, they are not instanced. Instances were added to osrs far later than randoms :) 
---
ur playing on a bot client... of course its gonna be buggy
---
I'm sorry you wasted all those points since I guess you didn't know, but the diary only requires you to kill a hydra. It doesn't have to be the Alchemical Hydra. You can kill one of the regular ones off task

On reddit he said it was his favorite update of all time
---
Not to be a negative nancy, but I'm kind of tired of these "*Played for 20 years, just goy my Firecape*" posts. There's just so many of them... Felt like venting a little. Grats though, I guess.

Yeah he wants to really hone his skills right before he quits, obviously. 
---
Idk what the stat requirements are for bone voyage because I did it ages ago, but if you can do it then try out the ammonite crabs on fossil island. Either that or do slayer
---
[I mean if demographics are anything to go by, runescape itself is a game aimed towards children](http://i.imgur.com/D1lo2sp.png) Is anyone who likes Spyro, Crash Bandicoot or Star Fox a cringelord because they liked media that was marketed towards children with cartoony graphics, minimal swearing and violence? What about people who cosplay characters from their favorite video games, when video games themselves had to establish their identity as not only for a younger audience by releasing games like DOOM or other popular shooters marketed towards a more mature demographic?
---
Ultimately there is some level of immaturity associated with both video games and liking cartoons aimed towards little girls, but why does everyone have to be an immaculate image of maturity and manliness and can't enjoy something that may not be marketed directly towards them?

I played RuneScape when I was like 10 and didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

Now i watch so many PK vids and swampy boi.

Very funny and original

"meta" literally is an acronym for "most efficient technique available"

If this was "just kiting" you wouldn't have to drop items for it to work.

Getting all those nats would take a long time and the drops he would get grinding those nats would make him loads of money but the magic xp and extra cash would def be worth it

Yeah jesus man, I was so eager to see if he gets mind runes or not. maybe even coins. All that excitement is now spoiled. Might just switch to mistalin mystery only uim series.

Uhhh just in general I guess, no plan. Quest monsters, pest control, random mobs. Aside from that what about the melee void? and mage? you addressed the range part but is what that guy said true in regard to the others, so mystic robe gear&gt;void mage and the few pieces of strength gear i can get&gt;void melee?
---
Depending on what your planning on playing, I'd consider picking up a 1080TI and overclocking it rather than even looking at 2080, Whilst the 2080ti has pulled out ahead with some decent synthetic benchmarks, In most situations the increase is marginal at best.
---
TLDR ; unless you can afford to drop a whopping ($1500-2500 here in canada) fat stack of cash for a 2080 ti in the hopes that games will better utilize DLSS before it becomes more affordable, I can't come close to recommending it for VR at current pricepoints.

Oh I am very aware. Just continue to play and you'll see what a struggle it's going to be, you're most likely going to swap gold from your OS to your RS3 account. When I got back from a 10 year break I had to work my ass off in RS3 to max my childhood account because nobody ever gave me free gear and gold.

Imagine getting scammed for your bank and seeing this animation right after

because "top level" is literally slayer online. People have figured out how to min/max everything long ago so at this point it's easier to mix it up than to pretend your 7000th zulrah kill was fun.

I sure did, but I the temptation got to strong. I regret it.

Nahh I'm with this approach. Recently started a btw account and considered subbing immediately but why bother when you can churn out a lot of early content for free??

no like what i'm saying is i got logged out before the timer hit 0, it had 5 minutes left and i lost my items
---
It's too bad to play smart when all you got is assumptions and low resolution pictures of the outside world.
---
Speculations are not investments. Investments actually aim to create income flows. Speculations just arbitrate the imbalances or consequences created by policies, either from governments or central banks. Bitcoin or gold are speculations, not investments.
---
Similar to buying ahrim staffs before jagex made them valuable for pvp.
---
If you had reading comprhension, you would have got from my first post that I'm mentioning that the central banks are propping up the stockmarket with their unlimited funds of created money (quantative easing programs).
---
If you're ignorant about it, it's not my fault. Think of it like some jmods are creating thousands of billions of gp to buy up scythes and tbows. Well that's what QE is. It's dumb.
---
There's a reason why nobody gets it, because they can't even explain economic cycles, cuz they understand batshit.

BTW, another wrong from you, bitcoin's lighting network solves the "digital cash" functionality. And I wasn't talking about cryto as a whole, I was talking about Bitcoin.

I've been AFK Farming NMZ with a prayer bonus of +26. I was wondering is it worth swapping Dragon Boots for Devout Boots bump the prayer bonus up to +31 and increase the time between needing to Pray Pot or is the +4 Str bonus better for dps?
---
If you are really anxious about it you can always try to solo raids 1 and GWD is very doable solo as well.
---
As far as TOB goes try to surround yourself with people who help you instead of being mad at you for being inexperienced. You can't help it if you're inexperienced remember that, so no need to be anxious. Every raid you do you will get better at it no matter how bad the attempts go. Look up guides in the meantime as well for whatever you're planning to do. 
---
Theres loads of clans as well which consist of nice people helping each other out. 
---
Keep your head up and stay positive :).
---
Sorry, we're working our way through everything as quickly as we can. There was a lot of things that passed during the month!

---
people sub to do agility 🤔🤔🤔
---
If you're under a certain combat level (105? 110? either one of those, can't remember) you do not get the same amount of points for killing bosses. They now made it so that if you're in a team with people over that combat level, you will get the full amount of points, but pures doing solo raids still will not get full points.
---
I don't think it's a huge deal, since I can't imagine there are many people playing pures doing solo raids, so it's mostly fixed, but it kinda bothers me because the premise of the mechanic is just dumb. Lower level combat players or pures already get less points per hour because their stats are lower and in some cases can't use the best gear. And they usually use more time and resources completing a raid. There's no need to diminish their points/h further with some arbitrary rule...
---
If youre under 115 combat you get like 30 percent less points 
---

i get what you're saying like but again as i said to the other person who commented, i wasn't able to log back in when the system update timer had 5 minutes left, it didn't hit 0, so i assumed i could just go back and get my items plenty of time, not the case...i lost like 2 mil, isn't to bad but still a mild inconvenience 
---
?
---
Time to update the drama calendar again....

Not a surge in bots - it's just a new activity which can be botted

No, they're actually useful tasks lol
---
ok ok 5 seconds, is that ok?
---
1,5,10,x are on the mobile deposit box so that's why I included them. Personally I find the placeholder workaround kind of an inelegant workaround because you can't do it from the deposit box so it has to be set up before hand. I did just test using the item on the deposit box and it worked I wasn't aware of that. Thanks for the tip. When I fish karambwans on PC vs mobile it just seems like a missing feature. Items like bones or jewelry you would have to right click use on the deposit box.
---
An dictionary?
---
Maaaaaate at the end of the day it’s just a game
---
More bots mining more iron because of he Ring of Forging F2P update. More bots = More supply = Lower Prices
---
Can confirm, this is happening.
---
That might be kind of promising if I weren’t on mobile.  I’d definitely consider it if RuneScape ran well on my computer.
---
I'm an idiot I was about to say I'm a Lions fan but I get it now lol.
---
The idea that you open the casket and get sucked into it to fight the boss sounds like an epic idea, support!
---
This is one of the best ideas i’ve seen on this sub ! But just keep the casket as a pet  random items following tou just seem lame to me
---
It all depends. Those who bought previous bear market and holded are still x5.

There is the so called Runescape 3 which has evolved into a pay 2 win piece of garbage over the years. Then there is the 2013 released backup from 2007 version which has polled updates so they won't mess up as dramatically this time around. Both versions are subscription based currently for $11 a month. F2p is an option but generally considered a waste of time after completing the final f2p quest dragon slayer. Casually playing is an option. I'm only putting in 10 effectively played hours a week which means I will max my account in about 3 years. This is just the "normal" way of playing. There are countless ways to play your account and some of the options do not require a large time investment.
---
I've reported it &amp; tweeted Ash but not sure what to do. Rollback coming I'd assume so just have to wait.

Why doesn't settled go for a yew shortbow?

For fuck sake, if my account gets banned for picking up an item and selling it I am not going to be too happy. I was one of the first people there and just saw a twisted bow on the ground before I even knew it was a glitch, thought I caught someone fucking up a drop trade. 
---
That's the thing, there are legitimate transactions still happening. Plus someone could've insta bought one for super low. I guess they are just fucked? This is officially the most retarded bug in osrs history

This is an outrage, I don't know what to put in the drama calendar now!

Yup, as someone who plays both OSRS and RS3, Archer Rings absolutely never recovered and this will happen to Twisted Bows. Archer Rings aren't a bit deal in RS3 as they're low tier, but a Twisted Bow is the highest level and second most expensive item in the game. 
---
This absolutely requires a rollback or Twisted Bows will hit atleast 500m, possibly 250m permanently.
---
Damn son February has been a great great month. The monthly calendar could damn near be daily at this point. 
---
Great, so instead we'll have a permanently fucked economy.
---
Why blame jagex? You are the one that is abusing a bug. And abusing a bug is against the rules.
---
so all the bugged tbows stay ingame?
---
How many would come in on a normal day compared to the 1 per world per minute or so?
---
Meet stumplytics, my 28 tbow tree stump locked only ironman.
---
This post isn't even slightly believable. There's armies standing on the spawn locations on every world, osrs gold is under a dollar per million gp. This guy's "friend" got PID on 5 bows, sold them on G.E. and organized a GP for cash transaction in the 15 minutes since the patch went live, before any gold buying websites took precautions... OP is a stupid liar, lol.
---
Sold my bank a week ago for a tbow. If the tbow price doesn't recover, not sure where to go from here. 
---
what im wondering is ... what if someone saw it, quickly bought a Twisted bow for 500m on the Ge. Will jagex remove that twisted bow too? And refund his 500m, or take the tbow and not refund the 500m? Questions... Just rollback jagex honestly.

If you actually read the information they put out you would know whats happening with that. Try to be more informed rather than opinionated

He needs a car so fuck up the game royally and create tons of extra work, much of which will be after hours?
---
If you have a duped tbow, go die on a pvp world/wildy and maybe you will bait your pker to sell them on GE
---
Huh?
---
Guessing around 180 member worlds, spawning tbows every 1 minute for atleast 30mins. Yeah thats nothing /s
---
Yikes. Good work. Can't say it surprises me given his flair:
---
&gt; Don't bother replying to me if you're black.
---
This is retarded, i literally saved up money for 6 months straight to buy 1 for 1178m 1 week ago
---
Yeh probably, I looked up shitty pmod quotes and that’s what I got
---
That's not really possible, it would be waaayyy to much effort to do that. They haven't even got a backup from preupdate so rip. They have to account for so many things.
---
This always happens dude any items on the floor at the time of update are gone when the servers reboot. Sorry
---
The worlds reset when updates hit, so everything you had on the ground is gone. 
---
A CoX changes blog was posted WEEKS ago.... 
---
Post release QA, wonderful
---
I’ve been away for a few days. What’s the tbow debacle now??
---
scrap the 2019 drama calendar and release a february only calendar
---
Actual brainlets 
---
If you’re pissing off a ton of customers by your “mistakes” then you should still be fired. I don’t care if they did it accidentally, there should be some level of quality expected at Jagex but it seems like they just don’t care anymore.
---
LOOOOOOL how can you fuck this up that much with such a small update
---
wat
---
Glad I didnt run into that. The amount of insane fucking joy I would have felt getting a Twisted Bow only to have my heart ripped to shreds by it being a bug would have probably made me go to sleep.
---
Gold sellers probably don't buy gold directly after an update for this exact reason
---
had 1.42b bank if t bow crashes im down to 600m of i bogla gold and im out. for ever.
---
Slowly going down hill, More and more bugs have been entered into the game fairly quickly recently, maybe slow down on the updates yeah? cool thanks. 
---
I don’t see how they can’t. They don’t have the staff to even track all the trades and account swapping of gold to make this right. 
---
How would we know that?
---
HONEST MISTAKE? HOW U CODE THE T BOW TO SPAWN IN FUCKING FARMING GUILD?!?!@?!
---
If they don't rollback I don't want to hear a jmod say integrity ever again.
---
Giving out thousands of free 1Bil items seems pretty good for the game economy 2bh. 
---
We're gonna have to poll which controversy is the best for February I'm afraid
---
He's done a lot in this 2 months
---
What a useless thing to lie about. 
---
&gt; Managed to die right before the update happened
---
If only there was a timer that would inform you exactly when the servers go offline for an update. So that you can get to safety before you get disconnected... 
---
Also everything gets reset with a server update.

---
Yeah i'm wondering the same thing. The chain of sales on the GE; person sells T Bow, buys arma, person selling the arma buys skilling supplies, gains xp. Roll back surely?

---
&gt; We will use means other than a rollback to address the bug. This is to avoid turning Old School off for several hours and interrupting your in-game experience. We are working with our Analytics team to identify and track the Twisted bows that entered the game.
---
Tbow alchs for millions
---
Yeah, jagex do not plan on doing any rollbacks as stated by mod ash
---
Pro Tip: Don't sell your new twisted bow. 
---
They stated on Twitter that they won't be doing a rollback.
---
&gt;It's been supposedly hotfixed but it's still occurring from what i understand
---
Just did a farm run on my iron, they've put trees round it but there's still like 90+ people there trying to telegrab it
---
[FTFY](https://i.imgur.com/x43fiT5.jpg)
---
Is it even possible to become a pmod anymore? 
---
From the tweets it seems the T-bow would be removed and the cash would not be refunded.
---
What happened?
---
pmods back in the day were helpful and friendly ppl. some still are of course. and some were awful back in the day too of course....
---
but seriously ive seen so many toxic pmods in osrs. like any status symbol in a Multiplayer game, it seems to attract real jerks who have a big ego.
---
It wasnt a topic aimed at people like you who 'dont know that' was more aimed at the people who do...
---
Wrong time to post this, buddy
---
Yea they use to do mass rollbacks, but these days I don’t understand why they are scared of them. This will impact the game more than they know. 
---
Seems like we need to update the drama calender so we can have weekly entries.
---
no site will pay u rn
---
Who gives a fuck about a ban tho if you were able to sell though. Probably the first ones to notice made thousands of dollars off this in a couple minutes.
---
because they stated exactly what will happen on twitter
---
You make absolutely no sense. I have quite literally never seen any efficient-minded player ask for the constant stream of shiny new updates the team is giving. That only ever happens because people are too lazy to stick to one thing for a decent period of time, which is the exact opposite of what an efficient player would do.
---
Honestly man, why would you report this instead of making a quick 100+bil and sell for cash, about 100'000$.. The real brainlet here. 
---
Weekly calendar. 52 fuck ups
---
The hype is definitely something that can lead to a mental breakdown or a state of constant anxiety. This is a good thread and I hope that he can learn to deal with the massive hike in popularity which I don't think anyone in the OSRS community has had to deal with - maybe Ice, and looked what happened to him lmao
---
Might as well turn monthly controversy calendar into weekly controversy calendar.
---
What's bad too is the expectation that you use Twitter, not everyone is going to see that message 
---
How many buckets have i picked up 🤔
---
February's finale
---
leave it there
---
Just get rid of all the shit you made from it , where no will will be and no action will be taken.
---
No they shouldn't. The UK doesn't have the same "FIRE EVERYONE FOR MISTAKES" attitude that stupid americans have
---
Sell it to me
---
They said they wouldnt remove bows that were bought by offers placed prior to the bug
---
What's the song? :D
---
The tbow but literally being talked about in every post? What do you think lol
---
got a pic?
---
Did you read his flair. 
---
This
---
This makes me feel like they are somehow unable to rollback. Everyone and their mothers want it and it would be easier for them. But still no? They must be somehow unable to rollback.
---
GP sold for IRL Money.. Banned Accounts sellers and buyers
---
Can't believe they didn't roll back
---
looting bag
---
This has been a good month depending on how you look at it.
---
/r/whoosh
---
The community would probably vote in favor of it... 
---
fml guess I'm just gonna have to take an L on this one
---
Die at zulrah
---
Lmao I love how tbow spawned just as you gave up clicking
---
What about a tbow in the g.e? It could be someone quitting and dropping their shit
---
Rollback or riot 
---
It was just a status thing back then too. Just suck up to JMODs if you want it. I guess people respected them more because they compared them to GMs from wow who could actually do cool shit
---
Will buy for much higher. Pm mrpotshot
---
If they removed every bow the net loss would be 0, those transactions are just money changing hands. Absolutely fucked for the people involved but the economy as a whole will survive. Bils, potentially 10s of bils entering the game will have a ripple effect that doesn't go away. Roll back mandatory
---
Time to ditch the monthly drama calendar in favour of a weekly drama calendar!
---
Imagine having the same attitude to anything else. A service worker messes up your order &amp; you immediately demand them to be fired. But even better, it's on a virtual game.
---
Confirmed morons.
---
How are they going to account for the damage done via the GE?
---
People who happened to sell a tbow during the glitch fest and didn't know about the stupid as fuck spawn.
---
Or people who could've been just picking these up and either alching them, killing bosses with them (especially on things like UIM/HCIM's) and other shit that's essentially untraceable.
---
If they don't do a roll back, they're more retarded than the person who put the spawn there in the first place.
---
Well if they actually dont then I'm probably gonna just de iron and rwt tbh the integrity would be long gone
---
"Damn this place could use some bitchin' sticks laying around" - the artist, probably
---
It will go down to 50m or so. 200m is overpriced.
---
How? They'll ban anyone who sold it or remove the gold they got from it. Shouldn't have any lasting effects 
---
You got me. I am mad.
---
I'd be okay with it just being this image: tbn:ANd9GcS64AxpTtz7oifBtbjM3qv0N7HgZwfkJE1wg6EI3ekyx_0DfsK6
---
no they are not, pm me
---
And then everyone stood up and clapped 
---
What about people who had old offers in for T Bows, they’ll get fucked over because of Jagex’s mistake
---
Well yes, but actually no. 
---
I'm sorry. What's going on?
---
I replied below, I was just telling you what they alch for man
---
I would just drop it and let it despawn.
---
oopsie
---
Latest update had a rather significant bug: Twisted bows were spawning just outside the farming guild. 
---
But thing is, hiring straight from the player base pool, that’s the joke
---
Need Fry trying to pick the Tbow off the floor instead of a hammer
---
Should get a rune pouch with lava/mist/steam runes, it contains a teleport to everywhere woth only 1 inv slot
---
You do know they'll get wiped and accounts will be banned, right? 
---
didn't ask.
---
If my 88 agility gets rolled back I’m pulling the trigger
---
The dev who worked on this left recently, so Maz has taken over this project. So since it's still being coded, we probably have to wait a few weeks more still.
---
All tbows that came into the game will be removed, so yes.
---
Twisted bows started spawning outside the farming guild. The once 1.1B item is now selling for 400m and falling due to the thousands of them being sold. 
---
Yeah it's pretty disgusting a fucky wucky on their end gets someone banned because they didn't know.
---
Sort your shit out jagex. People have quit before in the masses and we'll do it again
---
Nah mong this is balanced, I can finally do the inferno!!!1
---
this guy gets it...
---
Yeah, there are billions of fire runes in the game, what's a few thousand bows? 
---
Die at Zulrah/vork lmao
---
Just roll it back. If you just came across it you’d probably think someone was quitting and just dropped shit. Imagine never seeing this reddit post or the tweets. You’d just think you got lucky as shit. 
---
Literally nothing will regain it's value after this. They will delete T Bows and Cash but thousands of people are still fucked out of their money. 
---
Time to use telekinetic grab
---
Ignorance *is* bliss, so I don't doubt your feelings of warm and fuzzy self-assurance.
---
If I was responsible for causing thousands of people to lose a large amount of wealth I would understand being fired. There is literally no reason to place a tbow anywhere in game even for testing purposes.
---
That's why they're selling for 400m right now? Oooh damn... That's a yikes from me
---
If I buy a tbow in ge that wouldn’t be abusing a bug would it?
---
TFW base 70s working on base 75s. :)
---
It also wasn't hotfixed when they said it was, probably a distraction while they tried to actually fix it.
---
Yeah, I'll be whatever colour you want me to be
---
Pm me too
---
The guy who was supposed to code in the hespori QoL update fucked up. Instead of coding in a hespori flower he accidentally created a tbow spawn in a specific spot in the farming guild every 60 seconds. It's an honest mistake it happens to everyone, no harm done only 400b gp spawned into the game every minute :).
---
I think a rollback is warranted even if only one item of such high value enters the game in some sketchy way.
---
But hey, I'm not the manager of OSRS.
---
And lose my iron man i started 2 weeks ago?? Yea fuck pkers i worked hard
---
fake screenshot
---
scythe spawnpoints when?
---
No way? Is that real...? Why are the two most expensive items from raids one spawning? Odd..
---
Except hes not running a ponzi scheme he is just retarded
---
It was going on for over 20 minutes though so that’s 2000-4000 twisted bows 
---
So glad I could lose 700m without even logging in today
---
Yeah how the fuck do you manage to make 10:00 out of this. Make it 30 fucking seconds
---
"Hey guys, Jamflex fucked up and put a Tbow here" *Shows spot, pans to GE pictures from subreddit selling @ less than 100m* "And *this* is what's been happening to prices and selling" *transitions over to bans being handed out* "If you did happen to get one, or have the money to buy one, DON'T. It's too risky today to mess around with it"
---
End scene.
---
It was probably saved as a last used item setting sort of thing and the artist dropped one and didn't notice.
---
The process has begun.
---
*hourly
---
There's a video of woox using that mechanic in DMM for the Robert the Strong fight from DS2. He stands under Robert and spams red x actions, flinches him, then walks back under and repeats.

---
[https://twitter.com/JagexWolf](https://twitter.com/JagexWolf)
---
Fuckin wot
---
Acting as if the only solution is a rollback seems a little odd though. The number of people who picked up or traded a twisted bow is probably far, far less than the people who received a nice drop.
---
Obviously the best solution is to not have a fucking twisted bow spawn make it into the game but we're well past that.
---
Coins are obviously less traceable than items hence why the rollback was necessary for the max cash bug. But if Jagex has learnt from past mistakes (Archer Rings in RS3) there will be systems for them to trace each item and remove them from the game while refunding players who bought the bows.
---
This is what one of my friends is doing, my other friend is dropping, logging to another world, logging back, looting and repeat 
---
They accidentally added a tbow spawn outside of the Farming guild, so it would just reappear on that tile on every world every 30 seconds.
---
LMFAO HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN LOOOOL
---
honestly, something has got to have the a similar number right? only so many possible combos.
---
enjoy ban idiot. 
---
Nice Maple Shortbow in the weapon slot.
---
Stands there spamming straight after it’s spawned but then goes to hop right when it’s due to spawn lol
---
petition to refer to swampletics fans as swamp lizards

I can't load the update page. Getting 404 error

Make a calendar just for the February fuck-ups

I totes noticed this too and thought it was some kind of drop party?
---
Just slap a tbow on A Friends forehead and use that as a picture
---
people who bought the tbows on the ge are being banned 
---
Elysian spawn in 2 weeks boys
---
Is this legit? I doubt Jagex can ban this fast.
---
Elys are next. 
---
i mean .. i hope they at least confirm if theyre gonna do it or not. I don't  know whether to log on and play or not
---
Because maybe a player had dropped a twisted bow? Why would you ever assume the game broke or something? Not everyone is on twitter or forums looking at shit.
---
Look at how they dealt with the pure's gaining exp. "come to our twitter or forum" , No you morons
---
people who are new to the game, children, people who just assume that somebody dropped one, people who aren't aware of their value?
---
Definitely loving the series, but if he needs to draw it back, will support him no matter what. He did just recently complete a maxed UIM after all, it would be hard not to burn after something like that.
---
Nope, and they are currently adamant (the jmods) about it being a small thing that doesn't warrant it.
---
The Tbow price will be permanently fucked by this.
---
Same thing happened in RS3 with archer rings
---
Thanks mod west, very cool
---
I think that A Friend was aware of this Twisted Bow bug in advance. He then intentionally broke up with his girlfriend so that he didn't have to share all the wealth he gained from selling the Twisted Bows. Wealth that he'd spend on ~~black jack~~ shady cryptocurrency-gambling and €35 hookers.
---
Too late
---
88-99 Con. in 1 hour ?
---
Also even if it was true, gf your account.
---
The tbow spawn isn't in Morytania you dumbass.
---
yeah no prayer pots necessary for absorption, for the lunar ones after the magic requirement I think it's easier to use melee stats for the combat level requirement. But if you end up doing the dream mentor route then your points per hour become so much better with DT enabled (remember to bring ice gloves) 
---
This is interesting. I decided to make a quick script to calculate it too.
---
For people interested, here is full data.
---
https://pastebin.com/CEi4YB93
---
If there is interest, i can change the numbers for Tombs and an average of both
---
So you see an item drop 60% in price and think that's natural?
---
Do your really think they can't pinpoint every single t bow that was force spawned illegitimately? Of course they can! By NOT rolling back and hand picking them out, it allows the player base to continue playing while not taking away legitimate drops attained during this time. 
---
lmfao now they are banning people for their own fuck ups, can this get any worse?
---
Honestly I might restart with a normal account if I were you.  You can always chose to find things yourself if you want, but locking yourself out of trading now might burn you out later.  This game has lots of grinds in it, and without being able to trade some of them get truly tedious and time consuming.  Something that takes a normal account a couple hours to grind out will take an ironman 10 hours etc.  Sometimes I like going and finding things myself, but sometimes I just don't have that much free time and would rather make the most of my playtime
---
okay but not everyone uses twitter or even social media at all
---
they could communicate, gee i dunno, in game?
---
Does it matter? this happened the night after he got his maple short XD funny asf.
---
No in another tweet they mentioned tracking the twisted bows that got into the game from the spawn.
---
They should have rolled back 10 minutes after it happened. Now they hesitated and think they can fix it by removing items haphazardly.
---
All fake.
---
This just happened dude, obviously a roll back is coming
---
This is old and a different location
---
Hard code it all!
---
Just stop, holy shit.
---
What a trainwreck
---
I'm out of the loop here what happened??
---
Best idea so far 
---
I should be the one making that meme :(
---
Assuming OSRS has a properly managed code base at all
---
But... the drama calendar needs to be updated. Yet we had the shortest month, but most drama lol
---
Why the fuck wouldn’t they just rollback when they had the chance?
---
Jagex accidentally created a t bow spawn outside farming guild lol.
---
T1 Aloha af
---
There will be people that already had offers in the ge. Some people won't even read what happened. There's no need to ban your own players over a giant mishap on your behalf. 
---
I'm sorry but without the players. Jagex will be back to 2012 era number of players. 
---
Stop holding on. Just let go
---
Wow what a fucking genius. You’re implying that they actually go manually look into your account instead of deleting the item by using the code it has.
---
A lot of people liked it, based on the amount of upvotes on the post.. 
---
It's more because he said "that is a bad idea", which it clearly is, however somebody didn't get the memo
---
It’s a conspiracy, especially since they’re not rolling back
---
#Save Me Swampy Boi
---
Man I always miss the good shit... I'm guessing it's gone now?
---
Everyone is focused on the tbow drama
---
I enjoyed it, thats all that matters KEK
---
 Biggest issue is regardless of how many tbows actually entered the game  players now think the game got flooded with them and that perception will cause a permanent hit on the tbow price.
---
What happened this time? 
---
I hope that epic joke was worth destroying the economy and loosing ya job.
---
That's one.
---
the mod who put the tbow spawn in probs had malicious intent
---
His series is really good but it's not the best thing ever. It's just extremely overhyped. He can chill tf out if it's too much pressure who really cares. It's his account and his life, he can do whatever he wants and if you have a problem with that then you have mental problems. If he takes a month for his next video then so be it, the fake fans who only jumped on the bandwagon because it was a meme will either tone down or leave and then the true fans will remain and be supportive
---
Yeah absolutely, but say they alched it, or sold it on the ge before it was deleted.
---
What happens to the guy whos bought the bow?
---
Or
---
He buys some items with the cash, what happens to those items, are they deleted, returned to the owner, what?
---
With items and cash potentially changing hands rapidly, this is going to be an extremely hard thing to unfuck and there will be a lot of fallout
---
THIS IS WHY WE WAIT UNTIL THE LAST DAY TO UPDATE THE CALENDAR BOYS!
---
That doesn't fix the economy prices, btw if you want to sell an archers for almost double the normal price go for it right now.
---
You deserve a ban tho. You promised all 1m each and you still haven’t delivered.
---
There's no rollbacks, the jmods are going to manually remove all the 400 per minute tbows spawned into the game. 
---
i dont want roll back this is too much fun ;D i dont own t bow so i  can care less ;d
---
It is. Stand by what I said they can ban the account after I dump everything I wouldn't care after that point.
---
I would investigate said moderator
---
Sure, but it's not just the tbows. If some person got a bow, sold it on the GE and then bought items from that gold then they have to track all of those transactions. Who gets refunded and who doesn't?
---
Thx! Did you make it in excel? 
---
Well, I guess I'm not trying magic today, what a bummer, 4-6 hours of downtime.....
---
Yeah, it sucks.. 
---
I quit a long time ago so doesn’t matter to me. Just pointing out the irony.
---
Erm? Its a rollback mate.... Anything that happened after the update will be gone.
---
It's been confirmed it's being rolled back but thanks.      
---
Oh ok. I don't know shit
---
You'll get banned if you buy a scuffed tbow. Happened to a friend of mine. Permabanned for buying tbow for 120m.
---
would a rollback like this revive hardcores who died in the last 3 hours
---
The comment below is not wrong but what he was talking about in this clip was an item that made minions in the game incredibly strong (Banner of Command). The problem was that these buffed up minions were extremely hard to kill and every player built it no matter the role because of how strong it was. The item was later hotfixed because of how ridiculously strong it was and the problem could have been completely avoided if someone just tested out to see how strong the buffed up minions were before releasing the patch.
---
Clown 
---
I will keep that in mind for whenever I attempt to repost! I forgot those exist, thank you!
---
Alternatively, what do you think about using Elven Crystal (most likely from the Crystal Tree patch being developed) to make the Tincture vial? Or is that too RS3? I'm pretty sure you can make flasks out of crystal in that game..
---
Hell i would take the game being down for a week if it means it stays alive
---
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, WE GOT HIM
---
&gt;thanks we needed this especially because i was trying to knowingly abuse the situation
---
Thanks lads, I was really worried when Ash kept saying there wouldn't be a Rollback, would've been a disastrous day for the economy.
---
How is that tin foil hat... the 2nd most expensive item in game just starts spawning on the ground...? Find that hard to believe it was just a random fuck up. Could have been any item, and it just happened to be a t bow? Cmon now, don't be stupid. 
---
Already rwted over 10 of these. College debt paid off! 
---
Nah your friend wasn't banned for this bud. Nice try
---
Suicide jokes! How edgy! 
---
If they were last night they most likely will stay. Update hit this morning did it not?
---
no chance
---
pog
---
We basically needa poll the winner at this point, launch the polls boys.
---
Do we even trust them rolling back anymore 
---
4-6 hours for rollback
---
What kind of car are you looking for and why is it a blue Audi?

I'm fairly experienced in the gold merching business, so I know who to contact. It's really not hard to get rid of 10B ish when you know the right people. There's the normal gold merchers, but I also know a few people that are always willing to take bulk.

No pet for you :}
---
I guess its for the best though. Rather lose 3 hrs of progress than serverly damaging the rs economy
---
You weren't spam looting tbows? Legend. 
---
Same. I’m at work twiddling my thumbs now. 
---
Yea man he totally didn't abuse the bug or anything. Definitely not a category of report related to bug abuse. 
---
This is me everyday
---
I hate living on the East Coast, I always miss stuff like this because it’s patched by the time I wake up 
---
well youre in luck today, stop going to sand casino now and play the game or sell ur gold and quit :D
---
try not getting the pet during a twisted bow glitch next time
---
Please never become a detective. You will become the full time toilet cleaner with that head on your shoulders.
---
How 'bout you rollback into bed
---
SQUARE.
---
The economy and game would have been permanently damaged.  
---
Items like Archer Ring and other rares were already doubled in price.
---
Pressure has been moved from Settled to Jagex.
---
Thank you for your purchase at /r/2007scape and have a nice day!
---
I mean it sucks if this actually happened but they can easily check to see if you did receive it so don't think they're stupid lol.
---
I almost feel like if my progress is being rolled back, then my membership time should be rolled back the same amount. I spent time that I played for to get my stats up, now I have to do it again.
---
Sucks to be u 
---
Because not everyone is up to dat with the updates, when they happen, and the problems that occur. I didnt know about an update, I just hopped on this morning right after waking up and did my farm runs.
---
What movie was this from? Seems so familiar
---
They’re rolling back

&gt; in the future we can lock full incestrial behind Rune Mysteries

i would love to get my hands on incestrial set

lets just ruin the whole game economy so you can get 99 :^)

A guy that has maxed his ultimate Ironman. He wanted to restrict his account even more, and made a morytania locked account. He cannot leave morytania, and is going to try to do theater of blood with the best gear possible to obtain from morytania. The apinnoffs are just that. Same concept, just other goals and other parts of runescape. There is a guy in zeah(Ironman, not ultimate) and one in karamja(ultimate). Hope that helps

Welp got my onyx uncut 2mins after the system update countdown started. Ty jamglex 
---
The sun never sets on the Drama calendar
---
open your eyes you fuckwit
---
Servers are down for a rollback right now. 
---
I agree with that
---
My guy if losing 2-3 hours max of exp hurts u....Maybe you should quit and focus on mental health.
---
So this means the guy I scammed for 10m will get his money back?
---
I would have to imagine they're only banning people who abused it... Like picked up multiples and tried to sell them. That is by definition bug abuse which is against the rules
---
If they didn't decide to rollback, there's no way they would have been able to find every single twisted bow.
---
Firstly, do they even have a log to track who's picking up items from tiles? That would take way too much storage space (think about every single item in the game and every time someone picks one up). 
---
Even if they somehow did, what if I just dropped a twisted bow and let my friend pick it up or just let them PK me for it. That instantly becomes way less traceable and would very likely slip through.
---
They should have just made the rollback judgement call the second they realised what was up. This is a massive fuck up. 
---
30 seconds
---
Apex is all the rage now
---
I think they’re currently rolling back
---
There are infinitely better things to do with your life than play runescape pal. I think you need a bit of a break from it anyway lol
---
Omg I’ve never seen those elves, that’s horrible.
---
On a different note, I’ve actually mentioned a few times that it’d be cool to add a new tier of gathering tools. I know I’m a very small minority, but with the combat upgrades we get and the complaints of skilling not being as viable, I think it’ll help. Dragon has been the highest tier for a very long time so I don’t think there’s any problem with it personally 
---
It's either you lose that or everybody else loses their reason to play.  
---
Cya
---
Yeah itll only be rolled back to around 3 hours from right now
---
Right decision, good work
---
Relevant username? :D
---
Got solo Sara hilt, rip 40m :,D
---
Yet here you are lmao
---
How long is it supposed to roll back?
---
These fucking unpolled updates.
---
best thing to do is just forget and suppress any memory and notion of ever getting it in the first place, as far as you know, you never got it. now you can continue grinding happily
---

---
&gt; We can now confirm that the game will be rolled back to a state just before the update landed. All the details have been updated in the linked Announcement post.
---
The game is being rollbacked, it will take like 4-6 hours.
---
Lmao they turned the game off anyway so they have to do a rollback now, right?
---
You can drive out of the uk with the euro tunnel 
---
Just curious, why would you attempt to do a fire cape with all this going on?  I imagine you didn't know beforehand.
---
why does that change anything? Not denying it just genuinely curious 
---
Iz that a twistie bow in your pocket or are you excited to see me?
---
H 
---
I'm pretty confident they do use magic numbers. That's not what caused this issue from what I have heard, but I have seen screenshots of their code base with magic numbers.
---
Google is a tool used by the self reliant who don't need to be spoon-fed.
---
why are people like you allowed on reddit rofl. go back in your hole.
---
How is it the player who gets in trouble for their fuck up?
---
Not if they roll it back lol
---
Not when I posted no. But now it has.
---
I really want them to check. I don't think they're stupid.
---
of course people will lose experience with a roll back.
---
I'm mid game with osrs. And I dont give too fucks about the economy. I care about my time that I want get back. 
---
If I were Jagex I’d rollback and just ban anyone who sold the bows en masse
---
Yeah gold sellers generally aren't the most reliable. Don't ask me how I know this 
---
In related news, 7 swapping clans have been closed during the recent tbow bug incident
---
Did you take a screenshot?
---
my bad I misunderstood I guess. hard to tell when people are being sarcastic or not serious in text
---
Well how the fuck was I supposed to know? There was no ingame notification and I was too busying *playing runescape* to check social media.
---
just check \*new\* item spawns
---
rollback

Buying 2 buyables to 70(a very low level) is hardly ruining the fun for someone. Its only like 8m.
---
Ffs I got 7.3m Runecrafting xp and 3 pets after the update.. The incompetence of this company is actually unbelievable.  I will be quitting if I log back in and it's gone.
---
Okay i have a gyazo of me getting the pet.. hopefully i can get it back
---
The one day i'm doing Quests.
---
That was redacted.  Check the official RuneScape update.
---
I mean, not that i disagree, that is why i use the word "basically", but from what i saw ingame and on here, a lot of people thought that the tweet said no rollback. And as i said, plenty of people did not even know about this, why could there not have been an announcement ingame - Investigating major bug, rollback possible.
---
Anyhow, my time to head out and it is not like this argument is very on topic, good day sir and agree to disagree.
---
Please keep in mind that I have no idea who you are so I had to make sure. Yeah there's definitely a work around or something, which is why different possibilities are being discussed. Jagex needs to up their shit security.
---
In the autism spectrum? I am the autism spectrum 
---
can someone even explain how something like this could happen? Like, what in the update would make an item spawn just appear out of nowhere?, let alone a fucking tbow spawn.
---
Like, maybe wrong item spawn coordinates were put in on top of wrong item ID or something??
---
tf
---
feel free to add me! just started back up myself w a hcim and it’s lonely w/o anyone to chat
---
rsn fonduz 😎
---
you just got friccin fricked my dude
---
"Try to put yourself in their sh-"
---
No.
---
I mean yes; I imagine putting myself in their shoes. I imagine having rudimentary flagging systems, or workflow practices to not test with most expensive items, or huge red flags for not deleting "test items", or using copies of builds for moron testing (adding in items spawns and stuff) or any build where I'm not creating code.
---
I just don't feel bad for them at all.
---
Please keep you personal issues to yourself.. jar of dirt... who cares 
---
Browse the reddit and let the memes flow in and be thankful the straightened their heads and rolled back the servers
---
A friend was still more dramatic 
---
Competent devs and clear messaging.
---
The gold sellers probably don't want to damage their customer relations. They are a service industry.
---
They probably want to give the gold back to the people that bought it, but the people who sold gold to the service. That's just a loss for the service.
---
Who knows. Maybe they'll just cut and run with the cash, but they still need to function like a business. Even if they are super fuckin shady.
---
My theory is some jmods were fucking around with the new Hespori indicator and added the spawn to test.
---
Or maybe they were just dicking around
---
Tbh, i really hope he has been offline during all this.
---
The only farming guild update today was the hespori thing, so they would have tested that in the area. But of course they weren't looking around the whole farming guild to find possible rogue twisted bow spawns. It was just a simple mistake by the mapper.
---
Source? Pretty sure he didn’t shoutcast last tourney so maybe his contract is up
---
This got a genuine hard laugh out of me! 
---
here is the jist of it if you are curious:
---
\-Infinite tbow spawn near the farming guild every 30 seconds
---
\-players collected thousands of tbows and started to dump them into the ge tanking the economy
---
\-jamflex said they would not rollback the servers
---
\-reddit, twitter and falador blew up with riots
---
\-after a few hours they finally decided to rollback the servers and save the game
---
I completely understand the idea of QA, as I proactively look for functioning bugs in the game, and trust me, Jagex does extremely well with the resources they have.
---
No I'll be honest I bought a bond because I wanted to check out the bug but never got a tbow. Maybe I get a free bond maybe not we'll see when its up
---
Remember when osrs turned into rs3 and we all had to start on brand new accounts dang
---
F
---
Yep same 🤣🤣🤣
---
Yes, read some of the posts here or the posts on the main page.
---
There’s a twitter post of some guy RWTing them straight away, cheeky couple grand in his pocket. 
---
RIP to the Veracs plateskirt I just got on my Ironman though 
---
FrEe StUfF pLz
---
:(
---
A commenter in the main thread commented ‘pretty easily’.
---
His line of thinking was that if testers spawn items using id’s then the id for a tbow could be 1 number off of the id for any number of more common items. Add to that the person adding the wrong location means that the testers didn’t see it when testing the new content and it gets added to the game.
---
There should be safeguards to prevent this, like a list of items added and removed during testing, but I can understand how it happened through a cascade of small mistakes.
---
Don't know why virgins are even complaining. Not everyone has the time to earn 1 fucking billion coins.
---
How does it hurt you if someone else is having fun. Fuck off.
---
Honestly think about just buying gold for whatever amount your missing. It’s about $0.80 for a mil, so for 2 bucks you could get almost enough for a bond. Wait till the rollback is done tho 
---
That's what I thought as well haha, maybe I won't be skilling for 6 hours though, I want to do quests as well because I have only done the Client quest (veos) &amp; Waterfall quest. 
---
With the way their editor/sdk is laid out you could totally misclick a lot of crap and not even realize it, I mean they're assuming every employee is professional but Jagex has a reputation for demonstrating their 'humanity'. I.E. Corrupt JMods and Jagex employees, this game comes from a different time in the gaming community and over the past 15 years I haven't seen a change.
---
Runescape will die in the coming years with their current trend, they need to stop slipping up where EA intentionally trips up.
---
I mean, am I somehow stopping them from doing that? I'm not quitting.. I haven't attempted to make other players quit.. I'm simply hoping that this won't be possible in the future, and that we'll get some form of compensation for the rollback/downtime
---
Imagine getting a pet and this rollback undoing it
---
i hope so too good luck to you friend
---
i have to do my farm run again reeeeeeeeeee
---
Do yanillian hops. Invest about 5k into seeds and farming protection and get 60k - 80k in return for about 4 minutes of work. Do this every now and then and you have earned enough money to sustain a bond just from that. In case you hit f2p do rune packs. Buy air, fire and water, open them and sell runes at 5gp each.
---
Personally haven't seen the OSRS code, but having worked on projects that have been in constant development for 15-20 years you tend to end up with at the very least a bit of jumbled spaghetti code, The spawn might have been intended for a different item and a wrong ID was entered or the value was pulled from a table and the corresponding column/row/integer etc was jumbled due to added/removed code.
---
TLDR ; weird things happen can happen when you work with old code. And they generally aren't easy to predict.
---
Not the gold they bought for cash from the people dumping their GP from the tbows. That's how a lot of those sites operate. They buy GP from people at low prices then sell them higer
---
Remember the cash stack bug? And how mod Jed make IRL money from that? So a new mod Jed is coming???
---
Ahhh didn’t know they actually rolled them back Thank you 
---
They don't know what they want from them. 
---
I’m glad you appreciate it, thanks!
---
The communication is an actual joke. If you didn’t have Twitter, would you have any fucking clue what’s going on? Zero broadcasts in game, and they tweeted there would be no rollback. Now the game is down for 6 hours. Also the QA must be ran by a bunch of students or something I swear every update there is some major bug.  
---
i guarantee literally nobody looked at this code including the person who wrote it. 
---
We are so sorry for your loss. You will get through this...again unfortunately. 
---
My father gave me a small spawn of a billion gp.
---
Yeah same, that's a lot of RNG to lose out on potentially for him. 
---
when did osrs turn into rs3? I don't follow

Using other youtubers catch phrases? too. PSYCHICALLY

I got a hydra pet and it was taken away in the rollback.  Not a big deal 😥

O well looks like this post didn't get enough upvotes for a jmod to reply anyway. And looks like jagex fucked something up with tbows today aswell haha. Guess i'll just quit runescape as a whole. Thanks for the replies and stuff bro

Agreed, it sucks. Thankfully I wasn’t on when/after it happened.

If you come to Dallas and meet him irl. He started trust trading me like 2b worth gear (Kodai, Ely, TBow, Arcane, etc) two days after I met him and I had the infernal cape like 2 days after that. Only ever returned the Ely and repaid the rest but the Bow. He doesn't care for his spares. Keeping the Bow until I have the money for my own (which won't be a while cuz buying a scythe first).

True, but I would be incredibly surprised if more than 1% of gold buyer/sellers used bitcoin rather than something like paypal

rollback should have been initiated within 10 minutes, and no one should have been banned (unless they were doing rwt).

The quest doesn't require any defense levels, but rather requires a quest to be completed (Nature Spirit) which gives defense xp.  Sorry you can't do the quest, but it was ultimately your choice to place those restrictions on your account.  You're right in saying that the decision was more than asking "Should pures be able to do this?", as Jagex's concern with quests should be the lore, and not what kind of players should be able to complete it.
---
You can hope for a new Grandmaster quest without defense levels, but I'm gonna be a pessimist here and say that likely won't happen anytime in the near future.
---
They rolled back my fucking tree run reEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Better rollback than ruining the whole game's economy.
---
Ok but... Why didn't they just spawn themselves some twisted bows, manually, with their admin powers which can spawn in twisted boys very easily?
---
Game updates are 11:30AM GMT, not PM. They don't work at nearly midnight!
---
It's about $1k IRL money, going off of current exchange values.  A lot of people swap, buy it and make money with it, and eventually swap it back out.  Not saying I agree with it (ironman btw), but that's a route within reason for a lot of working adults.
---
That's not the case at all though. Thousands of people online would have no idea whatsoever that this was happening

I don't get what's so bad about it.
---
No i want a full refund. That's how things work when it turns out the product you paid for is faulty

It's such an obvious reaction to roll back, the fact they wanted to handle it in any other way than that is ludicrous.
---
It's a bush. It took probably less than 30 seconds to place and name.
---
Money doesn't really matter to an ironman.... The time it took to actually get the drops does.

Love the calendar posts
---
That is literally not true lol... it is sold to highest buy price. If you sell an item for 1 gp in the GE, it will always sell your item for the most money, aka the highest offer. In your scenario, the item would sell for 12m WAY before it sells for 1m lmao
---
Its only tiny if you live in USA lmao
---
Yup I'll quit my bitching about losing a few hours of xp. Like I said, it could be worse and yeah I do feel bad for him.

I agree, although it sucks it is for the good of the game and necessary. 
---
Who tf is running around the farming guild, sees a tbow on the ground so they obviously run over to grab it panicking like shit. AND THEN STAYS THERE TO SEE IF IT RESPAWNS
---
Like no, you are going to tele to ge and sell that shit instantly
---
but what if you just always have a dirt cheap offer in for tbow for luck? i've seen people get phats for nearly free back in the day just because they had the offer in.
---
I honestly think the players would vote this in lol.
---
You find a t-bow they better roll it back again 
---
The rates of RWT is 1usd to 1mil. If a tbow is 1b, thats 1000usd right there. It’s probable during the entire debacle thousands of tbows were spawned. 
---
Rollback, so all good
---
Did you only sleep for like 4 hours?  the servers were rolled back about 3.5 hours this morning to fix a major bug that was in the game from today's update.  So anything done in the \~ 1 hour the game was actually up was lost
---
They forgot to remove a tbow item spawn near the farming guild (never should have added it)

A few years ago a buddy of mine started a marketing company. It started slow and he had to overcome a lot of adversity since he got kicked out of college for failing husband classes because he had to take care of his sick mom. After a few years running his company took off and he managed to get on Forbes 30 under 30 list. We were all so happy for him and we drank for days to celebrate.
---
I love settled's vids and obviously an article is not the same as being on a published list, but for a company like Forbes to do a take on swampletics kind of undermines a lot of the people they've honored before.
---
Not to mention, who doesn't scratch their balls while working? Does this dude think they stop itching once you clock in? 
---
&gt;You said you tried for hours to connect. You made mention of opening other apps, and them working, and you trying again to load RS, and failing, for hours.
---
Yes, because you know, you can access other things that aren't games, such as youtube and all. Runescape isn't the only purpose of a phone or a computer. I had *other uses* of my phone during that time. I still wanted to play though, as I first thought an update was going on. So after I did some other shit in my life, I opened the game. I tried like 3 times, then I posted.
---
Oh wait, you would want me to guess that Jagex made some mistakes about Tbows spawning near a guild, not wanting to rollback at first, have tons of people complaining on it where I couldnt see that unless I wanted to (browsing r/2007scape)? Why the fuck would I guess I'd need to investigate about the possibility that a dude made a mistake that influences every single player in the game? How common is that for me to want to look for a reason? Local issues are much much common than a huge fuck up. Yeah I might be stupid, but it seems I'm not the only one in that state...
---
Yea i saw they only added the trees after haha
---
Ill take 1m gp please. 
---
Dear lord I died, thank you for that. 
---
Lmao is this real life?
---
are you retarded they rolled back 2 hours
---
Big oopsiescoking from Jagex recently. Seems like whoever is  coding the game is purposely doing these “bugs” for real life money...max cash stack “bug” and how do you mess up on coding and spawn a twisted bow? Like seriously who ever did that needs to be investigated.

They’re not rolling back 2 days, calm down

Damnit gotta kill 30 killeraatts again?!
---
Tbh if there was malice behind it why would they put it anywhere near the farming guild where everyone is going atm? not even remotely hidden. It's just a stupid accident.

Jagex should give free 7 days membership to everyone for the inconveinence and waste of time

Yep it’s back up and I don’t have a bunch of quests completed that I did. Nor do I have a ton of supplies I grinded my ass off for. Ironman btw so not like I can just buy back everything.

You're going out heading to the supper market. You walk by an ATM that's spiting out cash. Do you take the money in the heat of the moment? I think I would, even if it's morally wrong because it isn't my money. I think most would even stand by the ATM til it stopped spiting out money. I think if there are numerous people in the area everyone would try and get a bit. Like sure it sounds good in a perfect world without impulses that no one would take the TBows becaues it's morally wrong, but in reality everyone wants more.

Big MMOs are not rolled back losing hours of progress due to dev incompetence. But what can we expect from brits? they know nothing of customer service fucking ass holes I hope they collapse into the ocean while the EU piss on them.

This is the content I sub for

no shit moron. they still arent going to refund him

Damn they quick

Fight caves isn't hard content though, who cares.

They accidentally added a twisted bow spawn near the farming guild
---
What resolution do you play on ? 
---
NO MORE BRUTAL DRAGONS WOOOOOOOO
---
Shame it came after I canceled 4 in a row.
---
I think it’s him/his style commentating and editing tbh. He does a nice job with the vids but the content isn’t anything exciting. A 10 min clip to see him make steel arrows, get a hunter level, kill some Vyrewatch and do some barrows runs isn’t all that interesting on its own. 
---
But what do I know, I’ve watched every episode and still can’t relate to how hyped this sub is for him. Maybe it’ll click one day for me 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
"Looks a bit gnarly."

Bush has also search option, which results in a message: "You don't find anything."

Hardcore ironmen: please note that if you died after the update at 11:30am GMT, you will have been revived and will retain your HCIM status. However, your stats will no longer be tracked on the hiscores. This is due to the hiscores pages re-categorising these accounts as regular ironmen from this point on. As such, your skills will still appear and continue to update on the regular ironman hiscores page.

I CAMed in my pants 
---
Nah, the gambling addiction doesn't let you quit.
---
Anyone saying that people deserve to be banned for picking up a random tbow spawn and selling it are the real brainlets.
---
muh obvious bug abuse, fuck off. Jagex messed up and with the rollback why does anyone need to be banned
---
Yeah I have my old account email. Thing is I was able to login and switch the pass and email over to my new one. But now my pass with my email isnt working. 
---
Just because one was purchased after doesn't mean you knew anything was wrong.
---
What's the problem here?
---
1. They lied about the rollback. They told players to continue to play while they ran around and tried to fix their dumpster fire.
---
2. 2 hours for 80,000 players, that's 18 years. You seem to be younger than that judging by the quick tongue and lack of common sense you have.
---
3. Jagex can win by not letting it happen twice a month like they have a track record of. Compensation in any form is always a good way to keep players from quitting.
---
Ye but then you have to do Ice Demon
---
Can we also get a check on the IGN: Minhotis.
---
This was a friend that was hacked for his whole bank and shortly after he started rebuilding he got banned for no apparent reason a bit after that the Jed Drama kicked off 
---
They literally said no rollback and waited 3 hours to change their minds you fuckin 3Head
---
He was rolled back to a point after his death but before he picked up his items.
---
Is chronicle better than combat brace for getting to champions guild?
---
I could ballpark the total xp within 100k but I was mindlessly tapping on trees/the bank while sitting at work. My level didn't change and that's the gist of it for me
---
*Return to the past now!*
---
Yeah, then they said they would rollback. Look in the mirror bruh
---
Better late than never though.
---
i have that kind of relationship with friends, so joking aside, i actually believe you and your friend. very possible something glitched. hope it all works out for ya bud, gl 
---
Update that 'remembers' your attack options. Turned out that attack options were giving different exp. So if you attacked with accurate to get attack exp, you'd be getting def exp instead
---
Not sure if it's happened yet or what, but should I not be playing right now then? Is it a waste? 
---
No. Otherwise we would lose track of farm patches, ge history, and any other account-based settings we have whenever you changed your name.
---
Ok Burraki197, from the Middle East. They still said they were rolling back you brainlet
---
Does your wc level require more than 100k exp for a level?
---
The people who aimed to use this opportunity for rwt probably used burner paypal accounts, meaning there's nothing to charge back now
---
They play old school runescape do you think most of them have jobs?

2 hours for 80,000 players is still 2 hours a player dumbass. They also didn't lie, they literally said they were weighing their potential options, and cut off players from picking up the bow while they figured their shit out, instead of jumping to some immediate conclusion.  They have a track record of rolling back the game twice a month? Or has it just happened twice coincidentally.  Can you name more than 5 times the game has been rolled back in the past 12 years?
---
im told not to enter the killerwatt plane, the killerwatt plane is the only place i can complete the task. if possible id really like to not have to reset my streak to get past this task.

That's a paddlin.

I didn't say he shouldn't be fired, calling for someone to get fired every time there's a major mistake isn't right though, not that any of the things you listed count as a major mistake. Please learn to read properly before your next shift.
---
Open your mind to this scenario, a guy sees the tbow spawn, hes pretty new to the scene so he goes to the GE and sells 5 of them for 700 mill each. Now with his fresh 3.5 bill he RWT some of it, swaps some of it over to RS3, splits some of it to his alts, spends some of it on Skilling fast, does a drop party in the GE. How is jagex possibly supposed to track that? I mean dont get me wrong jagex is a joke (polling still not hidden) sometimes. But it's also the players fault from time to time.
---
Mann I just want my diaries back :(
---
Depends on if the server does a rollback or not
---
Not gonna happen. 
---
It goes 301 to 525. I'll let you do the math on that one.
---
I'd probably say fuck it and take up heroin tbh
---
Where's the tree?  I only see a bush.
---
no
---
True, but the point is, they could still have bugs like this because of hardcoded item ids. They should not be magic numbers, that's a bad idea just asking for mistakes to happen.
---
Uhhh what does where he's from have to do with anything at all, besides you being racist?
---
It genuinely is a business though...
---
attention whoring lowlife
---
I just finished imp catcher on my UIM, I'm okay with so many twisted bows going in the game and not having to kill the imps again :D 
---
Your mate has his tbow
---
Fuck you! And fuck the outrage culture!!! I am outraged
---
You are an actual idiot. And relax everyone is saying how Mod West is potentially guilty bec it looks like he has done this before. AND Mod Ash explained how it was an artist.
---
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU CAN DO THIS AND RUNSECAPE AT THE SAME TIME.
---
ARE YOU USING TWO HANDS NOW?
---
High profile items might be stored in an enum - ctrl + f would still work 
---
Here to say this, weak gains
---
Oh. Didn't think about that, it makes sense.
---
I think the point im making here went over your heads. It is not just this week it's almost every update they do. 
---
It sounds like you can reset the password again then, using the new email? Maybe I'm misunderstanding, this is confusing and would be a pain trying to help solve through reddit comments. If you want to add me on discord, I can try to help more there. I'm "Cody#1695"

I think we're gonna need a weekly drama calendar...

EoW 2.0

I saw a guy that had similar stuff a couple mins ago, but this prob gives the "I've been hacked give my stuff back" vibes and the first conclusion people jump to is your friend took your shit. 
---
what art skills
---
You have to talk to Oziach first, actually... 
---
Normally I would be asleep or at least not playing around that time. But seeing as my gf had to get up really early and I didn't have anything going on, I decided to hop on and grind a few defense levels.
---
Take 2!
---
Every time you killed someone with an un-tradable it dropped max cash
---
I got 73 last night and got a short ways into 74. I ended up with more xp than I had from last night but never actually hit 74 before the rollback, so I'm somewhere inbetween logging in this morning and the tbow.
---
I dropped everything I was doing when I heard the tbow news (maybe 30 minutes after the update?) and just stood there watching everything until the rollback happened.
---
Not if they paid in BTC! (and chances someone who knew this would result in a roll back would ask for BTC is pretty high)
---
*exposing members of your clan chat for what was probably a joke*

First day on the internet kid?

For once I actually Laughed Out Loud

Your magic levels are insignificant. Not hard to get them back. The economy is more important than your xp buddy

had the niche of being the best stab weapon for dragons mainly, which has been replaced by the lance.

im not knocking slayer partners, just getting more points/xp from it as this might not have a huge impact on you or other casual players, but for a relatively large group of players who prefer to skill efficiently, this would mean knocking off (possibly alot of) hours spent getting post-99 xp accolades, which I think warrants further discussion to find a method that will work out everyone rather than ignoring that fact because "lol skillernerds r mad". :/
---
rs is my life you prick, I am disabled. 
---
He saw an opportunity that wouldn't make you suspicious of him and took it
---
This time it's Craw's bow
---
It's been going downhill ever since they started letting random "contributors" post articles. They basically gave bloggers a platform where they can pretend to be journalists. 
---
Tanking bc it’s over priced and dragon hunter lance is better for some end game causing it to crash
---
I mean there should atleast be a warning message that a game breaking bug has been discovered because I had no idea that anything was going on at all until I logged back in later to see my stuff gone.
---
Vote for Twisted Bow Ashe
---
Got it. Thanks :)
---
Same as everyone else has said, the game is in the same state it was in pre-update. Meaning those items are in the same place they were before the update. Your friend saw an opportunity to have deniability and took it
---
It's not bad for someone that plays infrequently
---
I trust my friend more that a company that managed to put a tbow spawn.
---
50 mins 150 worlds *2,4m = 18b at worst and half of it on ironmen. That's nothing.
---
Agreed, I think they lost everybody's trust with the Jed fiasco.
---
they rolled the server back to before the update so your friend would still have the items
---
Well except you only need 75 cb to do konar. So that's within the realm of possibilities
---
Glad to see the change for raids combat level scaling. But would be nice to see the whole point scaling thing removed in general. 
---
If someone can solo a raid at lower cb they deserve the points, its harder than with a large high level team and its still less efficient points.
---
And yes it does lower the mob levels at lower cb but not as much as the point reduction. So for all I care they can just not nerf the mob hp and not nerf the points either.
---
Saving their game from an item placed by one of their team members. Like I said there's no having a conversation with people like you. Hello people of the internet looking at me argue with an idiot! I know I'm wasting my time.
---
They said no rollback then 2-3 hrs later they said rollback 5 mins before they took servers down ofcourse people will be mad.
---
save it for when they accidentally make a T. blowpipe spawn
---
I’m gunna spend my next slayer task watching Rodney Mullen flat ground videos now. 
---
Woah, woah, woah! Hold your horses buddy! Spawning pots with flour already IN THEM would be OP! 
---
He dumped his mentally disabled gf on stream.
---
Legend
---
I get that its a joke, but this was a fast rollback
---
In b4 God Ash has a massive coronary
---
You should have made the sign change to “0” as soon as he walked out
---
Work for it, I don't understand how people get any sense of satisfaction from just buying something in a game. You're paying money to circumvent actually playing the game. Oh and 3rd party sellers are blatantly against the rules so keep it up and your account will be gone eventually. 
---
You've completely missed my point, dude. If I picked up some t bows and then sell them then RWT the gold, who cares if I'm banned? But what about the guy who now loses his bow? Are you just going to add an extra 1b gold to the economy to refund him? Or are you going to spend hours or days tracking down all effort I spent into moving the gold around before selling it off. 
---
No one wins here. But your comment is irrelevant. 
---
Yeah let's leave a game breaking bug in because a handful of people got lucky during the bug's time.
---
1 air 1 law
---
u rite, they should have just let the economy be destroyed.
---
Probably why they were taking so long to do the rollback. They were designing that bush.
---
Too bad they didnt roll back b0aty's death
---
They've been up for almost an hour go go go!
---
Honestly with the time I put in my account I'd rather not get banned as opposed to getting ~$2.5k
---
I was stuck on that for a long time. Eventually just followed a guide on YouTube and got it on my first attempt. 
---
Why sell a tbow
---
&gt; I created the account when runescape was 2D
---
That must have been Runescape Classic, although I think it was still 3d, but if you've done godwars and especially if you have 130+ combat which requires summoning, your account is definitely on RS3. 
---
We'll talk more on discord when you can then, if there's more info needed that's when I'd escalate the issue to a ticket but I understand that hasn't worked yet. I'll try to help how I can.
---
ya my tbow changed to a willow shortbow after rollback. pls some1 help??
---
Seriously though, I would understand if items were missing but trimmed armors are different items. It's unlikely that items would be swapped after rollback.
---
Reverted to temp ban now, he'll be back soon lol
---
This isn't even a leapyear, I'm worried about next Feb.
---
Maybe referencing the victims of previous dmm world bug that affected some players on what should have been a normal world at the time. 
---
I recently got my wife and my father in law to play, I gave him a few 100k and a bond. 2 weeks later it's time for a new bond so I meet up with him in game. It was so fucking cute I regret not taking a screenshot. Iron med, steel sq, adamant sword, iron plate, mith legs. I kinda regret buying him a set of addy (g) 
---
Enjoy Brexit, better go see the nations one dentist before he moves back to Brussels. 
---
Haha
---
The people caught doing stuff like that will get banned though, not sure it's worth the risk
---
&gt;What about our day(s) of membership that are now completely undone are we going to be credited for those days?
---
They rolled back like 4 hours of play time. Where did you get days from
---
Me too thanks 
---
Yes... accidentally...
---
People will spend all day bank standing having an arguement with a 13 year old Vietnamese kid, but they lose 100k of exp from 2 hours of half ass AFK grinding and the whole world is ending.
---
You have literally zero idea as to the age of this person.
---
Spawning T-bows is printing money
---
Reset to the default attack style.
---
The default attack style is accurate.
---
Maybe they traded it to account that has rwt history (being owned by big rwt site)
---
Looks nothing like a tbow 
---
new Grapier spawn, don't tell anyone.
---
Dragon hunter lance took away its use in raids. Its a good weapon, but not 300mil good. Imo it's probably worth ~100mil being BIS on a grand total of 0 bosses. But non-degradable BIS one handed melee weapon is still valuable, just not that valuable.
---
F in chat boys
---
Rules are simple around here, if it makes the game easier vote yes
---
If it doesn't, vote no.
---
Lenny got skulled when falling on carl, aka that dude who lost claws logging into pvp worlds trying to get the tbow
---
Damn, was that actually a thing? I saw a few posts of the former and figured that was the issue.
---
She played back in the day so it was easier to get her back into it 
---
I only really enjoy raiding and pking, grinding for gp isn't that appealing. 
---
Right dude. There's like a list of 20 Reddit memewords that everyone picks from and feels more important by using them
---
oh hey I saw you freaking out over this on world 73
---
Except when you have the day off work so I stayed up until 5am anyway. FML
---
Flesh crawlers in security stronghold, pick up the herbs and nature runes. 
---
Decent $, trains combat, afkable, they only hit 1s
---
Are you stupid or something? It was just a single spawn point
---
Buddy, do I have some good news for you...
---
I don't think this is a bigger deal at all lmao
---
Got a tbow arma top/bottom and spectral missing after the rollback with account not where he logged out. currently waiting on a mod to get in touch
---
seeing as we have a video of him messing about with t bow spawns and we dont for the other artists yeah id still say it was probably him
---
That's what happens when a Chinese company owns you. Not really known for quality control.
---
has anyone tried using a twisted bow on it?
---
Forbes has an entire section of their site dedicated to gaming news.  The fact that this got published isn't a big deal and certainly doesn't fall into the realm of "does not deserve an article" since it's geared toward the audience they are catering to in that section.
---
Shit you right. My bad
---
because it's flash-in-the-pan streamer shit.
---
First was a world crashing due to logging players in beyond the cap of the world and the amount of dropped items killed it.
---
Second was a world temporarily had Deadman mode rulesets so legitimate players who were playing on it and were killed lost their 10 most valuable item stacks and lots of xp. 
---
Lmao
---
I see what's happening here. You're not being honest.
---
Whole reason for this post is jagex didn't want to do a rollback at first. And not doing the rollback will hurt the economy. 
---
Read the OP again. You made a statement that wasn't completely right. That's fine. But now you're just trying to defend it for argument's sake and it's showing.
---
You're a retard huh
---
Few hours I don't mind. They said it'll rollback to the point just before update, not hours earlier.
---
Tbows everywhere
---
How's the permaban treating you? Sucks to be the first one to discover a bug that's going to be immediately noticed by the entire community anyways but I'm sure Jagex took out ~~their anger~~ proper justice for this atrocious action correctly.
---
Boys we need to have this whole gif as february in drama calendar. This month deserves this honor.
---
Too bad my membership just expired and haven't gained access to the farming guild yet, oh well... 
---
This made me laugh at work. Thanks dude
---
Wonder if it's a mobile only thing? 
---
They've been back for an hour. 
---
Fk me it would suck to go through life feeling this entitled. You’re gonna gets down a lot bud.
---
It's serotonin now, keep up
---
Yeah dude I posted about that a few weeks ago... the post said at 99 mining with tick manipulation, your rates of collection will be a little higher than charter ship hopping...
---
I said it better be a lot-tle higher if you’re doing 3 tick mining, that’s absurd....
---
I talked to Jagex Support on Twitter once and they definitely use copy/paste responses (in this case you got the wrong one) but when their response to me didn't help the followup was a real response from the person. Don't let a failed copy paste stop you from getting the issue fixed
---
God damn right it is. I lost 100k mining xp.
---
This is true
---
Man it’s like trolls don’t even try these days
---
i live in North America but dont sleep late and was playing.   lost 150k str exp yayy
---
if you "must" do all your tests with tbow or some shit, use a placeholder entity or at least a tbow with a different value so they're much easier to wipe out.
---
If you buy your membership on amazon during February you get the full 30 days
---
Excuse me?
---
Can somebody explain I am out of the loop
---
Except you can't play 24/h a day. So technically membership is "more expensive" the less you play. So for someone who maybe only plays a few hours a day, that's an entire day's worth.
---
It's copypasta
---
#THATS FUCKING RUNESCAPE RIGHT THERE.  NONE OF THAT PANSY ASS DICK TUGGING SMILE FOR THE SCREENSHOT BULLSHIT.  MEN PLAY UIM, MEN POOP IN THE SWAMP, MEN DELIVER THEIR SEROTONIN IN MORYTANIA.  FUCKING HARD CORE DICK IN THE ASS BUTTERBALL FOOSBALL FUCK IT CHUCK IT GAME TIME SHIT
---
I died at dag kings 15 minutes before the update dropped DFS, fury etc. got back and picked up absolutely everything with 8 minutes to spare so teleported out.
---
Logged in after the rewind standing next to prime with all my items apart from the warrior ring drops I’d got so I was so lucky... I was wondering if anyone else had been in a similar situation, unlucky :(
---
Good for You man! You're as incompetent as jagex l0l
---
Lol
---
I agree completely 
---
For maybe an hour or two it was then it got fixed, but there was other shit wrong with the update as well
---
I mean the thread was to collect usernames to manually roll back, but it’s probably going to take awhile because they have to confirm when and how the experience was gained 
---
the people who rwtd their tbows sold to big name sellers most likely. if you buy gold you buy from someone trusted, if you sell gold you do the same.
---
gold buyers/sellers catch on fast, im sure maybe the first few tbows collected went straight to the irl bank but not many after.
---
Disagree.  
---
Ill take jagex over activision/Blizzard/EA any day, ty.
---
Just goes to show how selfish people are. Only care about themselves and what they lost not the permanent major damage to the game.
---
Ahh my mistake, I guess I only turned the setting on after I was already an affiliate.
---
Clue scroll update. Twisted Bow (g)
---
Just delete the game from the game, so we all can finally just stop.
---
Were you able to pick up a tbow on an Ironman?
---
Shit. Would this have been effective again level 3 bots?
---
Daily and weekly scape isnt really fun imo, even if it's beneficial
---
Chill out btwman 
---
So they were actually planning on something to spawn tbow every 30mins? That would've been nice
---
That's why I'm under the impression they meant to add the "Twisted bush" originally as part of some new content, perhaps CTC2. Makes a lot more sense than just a random tbow spawn appearing on accident
---
People on the autism spectrum are often impossible to please or make content, which is likely a significant portion of the player base. I’m not being facetious 
---
Holy shit he went for the username 😂 this retard is really reaching lol 
---
Omg me too!!! I had a maxed acc, 10 of every expensive item as well as 2 max cash stacks I want a refund
---
Yeah that’s a good point, I didn’t consider that. Probably a lot easier to sell gold to a big farm rather than find a random to trust you to sell it to them. 
---
What were the other 3-4?
---
Use the wiki a lot
---
Osrs.wiki
---
I just recently got quite a few irl friends to start with mobile, so I understand it's a lot to take in.
---
My best suggestion is to set mini goals for yourself and work on them. Short term goals helps it feel like you're making progress. A lot of goals in this game can be daunting, so setting small goals leads to less burn out (say get a few levels in this skill or do x quest)
---
Just keep looking stuff up and gaining game knowledge. There's just a lot, But over time you should start to remember stuff
---
I got you were joking haha, your comment just got me thinking about the situation from an outside perspective now
---
no thanks go back to rs3
---
Blow me
---
The rollback isnt so much the problem. It's the way they dealt with the situation and wasted lots of people's time. Rollback protocol was a good choice but the protocol for an economy breaking bug should be to immediately cut live servers. Other MMOs dont have these huge problems anymore.
---
Probably just added in a Bush quick and renamed it and it was one with a search option.
---
That or did anyone buy massive amounts of bonds? Or sell gold?
---
No, this is a result of an incompetent development team who ROUTINELY completely fails to test their updates for bugs. Every other major MMO has some sort of system setup to test for bugs whether its a public test realm, or actually testing things themselves. OSRS has demonstrated time and time again that they clearly do very minimal if any at all bug testing since every single update theres pretty much an unnecessary amount of bugs and sometimes(well its not even exactly uncommon at this point) there are very significant bugs. These past few weeks have clearly demonstrated that with the attack style bug and the T bow bug, not to mention the tons of other very significant bugs that have come with updates.
---
Its time they do what every other game does which is extensively test their game for bugs, its incredible that they still dont do that and instead rush updates after all the bugs that happen on a regular basis.
---
Hey!! Just wanted to make sure everyone knows: You're invited to my birthday party! I'll be live streaming on Twitch 7 hours after this comment (7pm central.) We'll continue playing the Magic Conch series!!
---
That’s what happens when you’re an Ironman :( F
---
There it is. I was waiting for this guy for a February drama reaction.
---
if anything, my balls get even more itchy (they are very large, i have sex with them)
---
Who, the fuckin tool leprechaun? 
---
I totally get that they're swamped, but this type of tool should take priority imo. It gives QA so much more power to perform their job to a standard that prevents game-breaking bugs from entering the game. We've seen two hard rollbacks in mere months which could have been prevented in QA. But you're totally right, the nature of the beast is that they probably won't get around to it for some time.
---
It literally has their names right of the ToB wiki page.
---
I summon thee wikibot!
---
Not white knighting Jagex they are a shit company who do none of the basic QA that they are required to do on a game this successful. That said, if someone bitches about losing 200k defence xp because of rolling back permanent major damage to the game then I'm going to call him out for being a selfish cunt.
---
But as we can see in the video you're describing, it is pretty bright red where he spawns the tbows. Hard to miss taking one out.
---
Also, it's my cake day? Sweet ty
---
This is a great idea in my opinion! 
---
agility is boring :(
---
Dude what happens if you got a visage drop after the bug and then the game rolls back? you lose your visage?
---
Did this stop after 5 minutes or are you still overloaded?
---
It’s a gambling addiction 
---
fucking hell mate that’s hilarious 
---
The normies are finding out
---
I don't feel sorry one little bit, for those who bought gold. 
---
You can swap the go to RS3?
---
but they were using the tbow for testing/ placeholder. how could you do something so risky
---
&gt;What happens to the guy whos bought the bow?
---
There's been somewhat similar things happen in the past and the items get removed from the players possession with no compensation. 
---
Oh no it's actually retarded. 
---
Yes it can, well be back to posting swampletics memes within a week
---
ty to whoever tweeted mod ash for this update
---
Yeah if it's an error I believe what you say might be correct
---
They were? Where?
---
so then why would you have made your original comment if you didn't know?
---
Just curious
---

That'd be very convenient and people would enjoy it thoroughly. Until they made a mistake.
---
I don't take my entire cash stack out when I want something from the GE and I don't want to be able to accidentally buy a random garbage quest item for the highest listed price in the GE.
---
Extra steps gives you extra opportunities to not screw yourself over.
---
As a fellow hardcore ironman, I hope you get your stuff back.
---
Everything. 
---
Not a problem! Happy questing my friend! :)
---
I hate it, it has no descriptions of the events like the other one 
---
I don't think it was from the coding, but in their world builder someone accidentally added the Twisted Bow in off screen, whilst they were placing the Hespori growth indicator. Easy (but costly) mistake to make if you double clicked when dragging / selecting items to insert.
---
I feel you dude. 
---
I wanted a twisted bow and didnt get one compensate me 
---
6-8 Kril kills an hour? well at least you get to actually learn how to do the boss now.
---
I am describing a situation describing how it would inappropriate to ban a player who redeemed a bond with 'illegitimate' gold, as u/nxqv brought up, and explaining how it would be easy for someone to not understand the bug was a thing at all but still potentially face negative consequences from it.
---
Just practice at Zulrah, if you die you can pay to retrieve your items anyway 
---
You gotta /s on Reddit or the plebs start throwing their toys. 
---
Any solid RWTer with some braincells only trade with people that have a verified paypal
---
It was a minute respawn, and I'd 100% tele to the GE after picking it up to go sell it immediately. I wouldn't wait around for 60 seconds to see if another one popped up. 
---
Lol calm down buddy I didn't even get affected I was just curious about how much would actually get lost in that time. But you know I should probably re-avalue my life haha
---
The real question. 
---
All in favor?
---
That's under 10 minutes tho
---
Rather have them drop for free outside of the farming guild
---
I got my fire cape about an hour before the rollback cutoff, so I was worried but it’s been fun for me too
---
I doubt any jmod will reply here, but your best option for a reply is to tweet @JagexAsh on twitter, he usually replies within 24 hours. 
---
Because the banks are consumer banks, not investment banks. They're regulated by 100% fractional reserve laws, requiring them to maintain customer deposits in-house without dispensing or charging interest for their services. In other words, they aren't allowed to dispense your assets to outside institutions (for investment or fee purposes) by law. 
---
Additionally, my only guess as to how that kind of business practice is sustainable is that the bankers themselves are unpaid slave labor. So while the GE employees might agree with your ideas, good luck telling the unpaid worker sitting next to you what to do.
---
All information listed in my post is 100% factual and not the product of day-drinking.
---
I feel for you man...totally out of your control and not your fault.  I get Jmods don't want to set a precedent for refunding items like that but it is a total injustice.
---
We need to build a bridge.
---
The emergency protocol is a rollback you muppet
---
So making a big mistake will not make him a fraud?
---
I got a bottomless bucket at hespori and now it’s gone after the rollback. :/
---
Now this is a QOL uodate. I can't tell you the amount of times my retarded ass has set up a purchase in the GE before realizing I had no coins in my inventory and having to cancel the trade and redo it after banking.

Interesting thing about the songs that don’t play in the boss room is that they seem like they are two songs spliced together, almost like there was supposed to be a pre- and post- boss music track. Very cool to listen through

Slayer isn't very profitable untill later in the levels(70+)

Early money I'd recommend getting into Herb runs (especially if you're on mobile)
---
You can get on mobile every like 2 hours make an herb run and make a good 100k from 10-15 mins of work. You can also do it in between other activities. This is how my one new friend pays for his bonds!

Brainlet btw
---
Every once in a while yea, usually when I hit a big milestone (like 82 farming). 
---
A bug made só the best bow in the game (I think) kept spawning on a popular place. 
---
CTC2 is f2p so probably not related
---
Bullshit. They only rolled back because of huge community backlash. They weren't planning on rolling back initially. Also, 'before many people were even out of bed' for real dude? It was mid day in Europe, typical American thinking the world revolves around you.
---
I hope you're pretending to be fucking retarded?
---
At least now you know you can do it!

Good thing I tagged you weeks ago so I know it's always the same person being genuinely retarded on here and it's not just a bunch of different people.

I didnt realize that complaining about how the game makes you pay attention if you want to make more profit makes any sort of viable sense, so you agree that we should make the game as easy as possible to maximize profit? I say next update zulrah and vorkath always hit 0 so I can afk zulrah 
---
Ya that’s bogus. Like you stroll across a tbow on the ground and you don’t pick it up? Like cmon. It’s not exploiting a bug. It’s a fuck up.

lol!

---
The part you linked is completely unrelated to what happened today. That was from a Kebos livestream from months ago and he removed all the items right after.  Even if he did miss one, it would have been caught since all the newly mapped areas were tested since they were all new content.
---
I can confirm
---
Jagex does this so they can take advantage of gold farms in china
---
Now you can do it all again!
---
.)
---
Maybe the initial conclusion was that rollback wasn't needed and they could handle it manually but upon further investigation they realized that it was not viable solution.
---
Me too
---
Did you know about the bug before doing the quest?
---
Thanks Holmes
---
We need an evil version of the justiciar armor.
---
Have you pulled your head out of your but enough to read the reasoning ash gave? 
---
Last episode I'd looked him up on the hiscores and he had a few levels not seen in the episode but related to the episode themselves, I think he's got a bit of a backlog going

I'm talking about the spec. Raising your fishing level increases your XP rates.
---
“It’s your fault for playing the game within 12h of an update.”
---
Seriously tho this fucking blows sorry man 
---
Its already been explained how it happened u special individual.
---
Jagex are the ones that messed everything up, they should've done the rollback long before they did, but it's looking like you won't get anything back.  Srry dude :(
---
I guess the kind of idiots who have no idea how many bows entered the game or how many accounts were affected but vehemently argue it was not small scale.
---
I'm a casual pker who normally logs in get's a couple pks and goes back to studying.
---
The way jagex treats their pvp base (and honestly the community as a whole as evident by their lack of qa) is nothing short of appalling.
---
Unless a major change occurs, I won't be returning to this game anytime soon.
---
exactly man i was disappointed, woke up at 6am and was still too late lol 
---
Had the same thing myself. They said no roll back. I went ahead and done it. Got the roll back 😂 I know how I'm spending my evening haha
---
It's the best bow in the game and worth 1.1 billion GP
---
THE KID FUCKING MADE IT. GOOD ON YA, SETTLED.
---
It sounds like you enjoy questing. Membership quest are much more enjoyable than f2p, maybe check those out. Either way, play the game how you like. Enjoy!
---
Terrible writing “only 2xp!” In relation to what, is that a lot or a little?
---
This article was clearly written for people already familiar with Runescape. It’s borderline illegible for anybody else.

No lol.

Too soon

Just refinished underground pass for the 2 d time. Now I gotta go do rum deal and sheep shearer again and then do 350k prayer xp to catch up..
---
No duh it’s not guaranteed, nothing in RS is. I could try to fish a shrimp at level 99 with a fishing pot and not catch one for an hour, but the odds are astronomically low. But over the course of a couple thousand hits (which is what a range level takes) you will most definitely see more 12’s at level 74 range than at level 70 if your monster has any defense levels at all.
---
&gt; The part you linked is completely unrelated to what happened today
---
It isn't because it shows they are perfectly fine with messing around and having fun in the workplace. This will will lead to accidents like what happened today. Someone placed the spawn down and forgot to remove it or didn't notice it. This wouldn't happen if they didn't their employees play around with their tools.
---
Why serp helm? Also how is 83 construction going to help me?
---
How does it damage game integrity? it's the same as buying bonds but cheaper. 
---
Nice.
---
Not thinking it revolves around me but I used the word many specifically to not include people in other countries.... so good job there. And they didn’t want to roll back because they knew it would make people lose progress. It was a last resort and it was the only way to completely fix the damage this bug caused.
---
And back to the American thing. I didn’t say most. I said many because a whole lot of players are Americans... and MANY of them were still in bed, but nice try man.
---

I'm just glad I slept in, I was due to do a cactus run whenever I woke up. Seeing that on the ground while casually picking spines woulda probably given me a heart attack.
---
That is very unfortunate man. You’re right that it is unacceptable, but a rollback is the only feasible option to clear up this fuckery. 
---
Remember when Forbes was a business magazine and news site?
---
I 'member
---
Oh no Jagex! I had just gotten a T-Bow at chambers of xeric and a scythe at ToB before the rollback! Pls fix!
---
Make it an opt-in thing where you have to turn the option on? I take my whole cash stack whenever I'm mass buying things :/ 
---
Kieran Lee 
---
What were the first 2?
---
Ah ha. That's why I have to restart my quest. Great.
---
That's absurd.  Game mechanics are updated constantly for qol reasons and things become balanced as needed when time goes on.  This isn't about profit it's about a mechanic that is unique to bird nest drops disappearing after 30 seconds when everything else in the game takes a lot longer to disappear.  I also referenced clue geodes and bottles going directly into your inventory.
---
It seems arbitrary and excessively punishing to have a mechanic such as this involved in one of the most afk skills in the game.  It feels bad having nests disappear so quickly because paying attention to woodcutting 24/7 is not something most players will enjoy doing.  It's a punishing mechanic that doesn't make sense to me.

Hey, accidents happen. Like when you lie about a bank rework for over a year.

Speak to the bloke at dwarf castle he will sort you with a new one for free

what fucking retard would make a tattoo for his 2d gay buddy swampfeggits jesus reddit really taking this too far

I could go for your intelligence but that would involve my having to care and read you’re post. Not worth the effort.... have fun being mad and broke. ;)
---
Ahh okay. I was just curious because at 86 cb I was having some trouble with the steel dragons myself
---
why alch it when you can use ring of wealth and GE it for 100M
---
Oh yes it does, we just don't get roll backs, maybe not litterally a infinite spawn, but we've certainly had markets be flooded due to jagex incompetence
---
I'd disagree there. Just because they aren't 100% serious on livestreams doesn't mean they do the same stuff off stream. I doubt artists map down T Bows or such for fun when working normally; he only did that as an example to show off the new map editor on stream... So yah, he was playing around with the tools, but only to show us how the new tools worked and not as part of his work.
---
“On twitter they said they would not be rolling back”
---
“Rollback announcement 15 minutes later on twitter”
---
That’s you.
---
Alex Jones is calling himself retarded
---
More switches, better gear, better stats. Serp helm makes your DPS worse don't use it.  
---
83 construction for pool doesn't help imo, 20k+ a kill for teles isn't worth it unless you can get 4+ per tele, and time spent home teleing/fairy ringing back isn't worth it
---
Asking for money for a bond under the guise that you will then sell members objects in order to repay the loan is the oldest scam in the book.
---
thank you
---
I did dig site and started dt and then got rolled back 
---
I mean depends on what the player did. A player just walking by and picking up one wouldn't know that it was a bug. Standing there looting t bows as they spawn for 20 minutes means you're completely aware that it isn't there intentionally and abusing it for personal game.
---
As far as it being the devs fault, that's a terrible argument because that's true for literally every bug, and isn't an excuse for trying to cheat other players. 
---
If someone can list all of the major drama events for the month, I'll make a poll for the most significant one that people can vote on
---
They abused a bug and they saied that the abusers would be punished
---
Imagine being as incompetent as Jagex and instead of owning up and fixing one's errors, they say they can't even though they can and have replaced items before. Shit employees.
---
Holy shit lmfao who is this man child
---
What's the ign
---
its annoying because getting to jad is so easy but it takes forever :/

Imagine if he lost a barrows drop because of this

Would you kindly fuck off

    spawnItem(TWISTED_BOW, x, y);
---
I got you if you still need it just pm me
---
Wait, second? What's the most expensive?
---
Not even slightly apologetic or empathetic.
---
It's like they're actively trying to kill their own player base.
---
Ayyy gratz bro, gotta know how to work the system. 
---
BIRD UP
---
Seems like this is happening to a lot of people, just more pure incompetency from Jagex. Cant even roll shit back without massive fuck ups, how the fuck does an item just disappear and not just be placed on the character it was before?
---
LMAO he said EMAIL THE CUSOMER SUPPORT wrong game man we don't have customer support
---
Amulet of the damned is SUPER easy to get though at high firemaking, assuming he has 80 firemaking by the time he is at ToB. 
---
I dunno if he is planning to go that high in an otherwise useless skill, but at high level chests they are pretty common.
---
lol the dude didn't realise that they are looking into this next thinks he got away home free when they didn't check it yet
---
n o b o d y g i v e s a f u c k 
---
Apparently he woke up after all the drama was calming down. 
---
its 0 content fuck swampletics
---
Hello ironslees, I hope you have a wonderful day!
---
Technically yes, but they stated that these individuals were selling the items in mass, buying and then redeeming bonds with them which is against ToS
---
As much as people wold be annoyed (albeit just for a while), he should  change his release schedule to biweekly, so he has time to rest. It's super unhealthy to be completing those 30-40 hour tasks in one week. Also there's  just so much more pressure on him if he makes weekly videos.
---
&gt; With the way their editor/sdk is laid out you could totally misclick a lot of crap and not even realize it,
---
It's happened plenty of times already, just usually not something this serious. Most of the time it's just random objects where they shouldn't be
---
it does seem sus af though, that for all of the items it could have been it was a tbow
---
But I did not lose an ACB now did I? Expect to lose more items in the future if you do not change your ways. 
---
are we gatekeeping Swampletics now?
---
No one is memeing it lmao. People are genuinely excited to see what he's up to. He locked himself into a region I wouldn't even think had enough resources to last two episodes. But damn he's doing amazing.
---
If he's getting meme'd you wouldn't see the amount of views hes currently pulling with this series.
---
You've never made a mistake before? Nobody is perfect. Accidents happen. Also, this is a game. It isn't THAT serious. Grind on, man.
---
yes it will be a laugh at him being cocky l000000000000l
---
Aah okay, makes more sense that way
---
True, but my replacement took me over 40 silver keys. Just annoying to re-obtain.
---
I turned a 40m stack into a 620m stack at the arena during that time with a WICKED fucking 7 win streak
---
They fucked us and that's just how it be sometimes.
---
I don’t expect to compensated because I live in the real world. 
---
Get over yourself
---
Fake and gay.
---
Done with dev tools on any browser.
---
depends on his gear, arma upgrade is pretty worthless for example
---
Did you bother reading today's update post?
---
Can I get my 10 law runes back?
---
Ty
---
There was this hole in the wall bar I used to go to that had a car drive through the front door. They put a sign up x amount of days since someone drove through our bar. I enjoyed it. I enjoy this. Thank you. Wish I had a tbow
---
Brand new reddit account as well. Sounds like a scam to me.
---
People lost hundreds of mil by trading it in between their accounts before the update happened, and then when their two accounts got rolled back to different points it disappeared from both accounts. So don’t act like it is just an hour lost. Second, this is completely on Jagex who even said they weren’t going to roll back this isn’t a joke. Don’t talk about things you don’t know the whole story about.
---
Just a reminder we pay $11 a month for nonexistent support. 
---
Good thing I didn’t transfer my tbow.
---
I hope searching it gives you "twisted branch". With some clever examine option. 
---
I was sleeping while all this was going on, but somehow even though I got 8 hours sleep it only feels like 6...
---
&gt; Qa didn’t test that far
---
And thats the problem with every single update, they basically dont test at all which is clearly evident with all the bugs that are routinely rolled out with updates pretty much on a weekly basis at this point. They clearly are not even remotely extensive enough in whatever testing they do, if there really is much of any testing done which is mind blowing especially considering how often bugs are for them youd think they learn by now.
---
F..sorry bud.
---
Message me your RSN. I'll hook you up fam. 
---
i thought you always just get 30 days of membership
---
I was training construction for 2 hours straight at 5:30-7:30am today 😭😭😭😭 that’s like 700k exp I’m never getting back 
---
gz
---
Can we also talk about how lucky we were that the spawn happened to be placed in a heavily trafficked location? Imagine if this spawned somewhere nobody ever went and was found by a small group that managed to keep it quiet for a few days. Rollback wouldn't have been an option, and twisted bows would have been forever devalued. Crazy how lucky Jagex were to get away with this one.
---
Seen a lot of these posts it’s a scam fam
---
Bingo boingo! 11$ a month and you need to make a reddit post whenever they fuck up
---
I can tell you have never run  into sarcasm hahaha holy, it's pretty absurd that you think its unfair for a birds nest to disappear after 30 seconds all because your dumbass wants to jerk off in another room while you cook bacon with your toes... if I can catch a birds nest on the ground you can. 
---
haha crying many people get shit rng all the time and go thousands dry when some get in first few kills its like asking for the drop when that happens grow up
---
from bad to worse, Come on guys this is getting to bethesda level of fuckery. How can you ban players for your fuck up? so if a player was walking by and saw one of the most expensive items in the game on the ground they were supposed to say " Oh that's not supposed to be here" and just keep on walking? insane just do a roll back and leave it at that, no bans at all. 
---
Dude, look at what im replying to.
---
The only thing I could think of was it was because after I gave my pure the acb I logged straight off my main, but I never logged out of my pure until being forced off by the 5 minute update timer to shut off osrs, idk though. I should've expected to be fucked over by Jamflex at some point though I suppose.
---
"Contact customer support"

No shit
---
GIVE ME A FUCKING TBOW YAGEX 
---
The membership may still be on the account but jagex said that this will be fixed and those players who knowingly abused it will get the temporary ban
---
If anything, being someone who constantly checks the homepage and Reddit would indicate being addicted to the game. The casual player would have no idea. Dumb comment.
---
because its jagex and they most likely won't thats why lol
---
I just did a whole task. They are fine
---
If not troll: "Players who abused the bug to buy bonds and redeem them for membership will have appropriate action taken against their account in the near future."
---
Yikes, Sean’s a little desperate.
---
No, he is definitely being meme'd. Thats not to say im gatekeeping "real" fans or that i think he doesnt deserve alot of praise for how great the series is going. But its very clear that the series being good is a meme right now, and once the meme dies a fair amount of viewers will stop watching.
---
I can’t stop watching this. It’s the greatest thing I’ve seen all week ahahahahaha
---
Scythe is much more, it's not sold on he because it can go for more than max I believe.
---
Could be better tho...
---
Its around 10k I didn't have to pay :) Its all good.
---
Apparently membership is only one calendar month so since Feb is usually 28 days we only get 28 days of membership. Well get a small revenge next year when they give us that extra day, muahaha.
---
Ironically, Buzzfeed News has provided some top notch reporting during the last two years. And yet, I still can't take them too seriously just because of what Buzzfeed's non-news section is like.

&gt;the best bow in the game (I think) 
---
actually best bow is maple short
---
Stop downvoting this guy for asking legit questions, not everyone follows every bit of drama on this sub/community.
---
Yes I think the only way for Jagex to repair this situation is to give every player a free tbow.. problem solved.
---
I actually quit for awhile in early 2006. I came back this last year and started looking up old clan mates and come to find out, our clan leader was one of the few permabanned because of the massacre. 
---
While your words are true, you are talking to the community that still gets regularly scammed by phishing streams and gambling bots. There's a large portion of this player base that is simply retarded 
---
Jagex has about 130k OSRS players, correct me if I’m wrong. At $11 each month, thats very roughly about $0.38 a day. So about $50k worth of potential revenue they would lose by doing that. 
---
Unless there is an even bigger backlash requiring damage control, I see none of that happening. 
---
&gt;We know what you're trying to say.
---
Doesn't sound like you do.
---
&gt;It's an end-game BiS item, that is gotten very rarely from raiding. It shouldn't have ever been able to just be picked up willy nilly.
---
No shit. I didn't say that it should have ever been a spawn, and I'm *obviously* not talking about a situation where it remained in the game. I'm talking about if they just didn't roll back and the max of about 10k or so tbows that were picked up remained.
---
There would be no massive influx of coins. There would be more coins in circulation sure, but that money had to come from people buying the bows, so the coins were already in the game. The most new coins that could possibly enter the game would be about 20bil from alching. That's small fry on the scale of the economy. Also this wouldn't happen since people would profit more individually by selling them on the GE, since there's zero chance the item would tank below its alch value.
---
The other possible impact would be from circulation of more coins. The coins were already there but now more of them are being spent. I don't know how that would effect the economy. That's why I wrote my original comment and I have yet to see anyone actually attempt to address that question. You certainly didn't
---
&gt;This would have been catastrophic to the game, compared to rolling back a few hours to prevent a collapse of the economy and playerbase.
---
I'm not interested in the impact "compared to rolling back" I'm interested in the actual absolute impact of the situation. For someone who says they know what I'm trying to say you're really not picking up on any of my points whatsoever.
---
&gt;Tbow tanking to half it's value doesn't mean every item in game doubles, it means an incredible influx of coins into the game, which would have brought every other item DOWN.
---
Despite the fact that there *wouldn't be* any influx of coins into the game like I said above, even if there were, that is the exact opposite of what would happen. When there's more money, the value of the money goes down. It's called hyperinflation. Look it up.
---
&gt;Think, man.
---
Perhaps you should try that yourself, before being rude and condescending about topics you clearly don't understand.
---
I doubt they ban players for snatching one. They ban the ones who are selling and actually snatching a bunch of them. 
---
imagine caring about downvotes...you are a fag
---
Big oof man. If it makes you feel better, your comment made this post for me. Have an upvote for your boots/fury/spear :(
---
Jagex stole your visafe
---
Excuse the ignorance, but why is 82 farming a milestone than say 80, 90 etc?
---
shit hit me with 150cc of brick and play coma roulette

walk under the first one and push the other one IDIOT

Go take a timeout for that

I honestly don't care. Grats though lol

Yessir. My favorite activity for work afking

Thank you Settled for inspiring so many with your passion. Please, hold on to that passion no matter what. I strongly believe that good content will follow as long as you’re still enjoying your time on RuneScape! 
---
I also believe that no matter what you do, the fan base you need will continue to support you. They will sort themselves from the bigger crowd that’s always asking for more! If you get the chance to, watch Rodney Mullen’s interview with Tony Hawk. I feel that Rodney brings up some really important points about fame.

What's the mathematical model for theoretical?
---
No he’s legit. He PM’d me and told me to tell you so you know he legit.
---
It wasn't actually the combat ring, it was because of a portal room in the basement. Combat ring was just the popular theory at the time.
---
Cursed You had enabled PvP in the basement, and anyone who was using the scrying pool in the portal room kept the PvP flag when the house was closed.
---
When you use the scrying pool you actually teleport to the location you're seeing, so when the game removed the PvP flag from everyone in the basement to kick them out, it didn't get the ones who weren't technically "in" the house at the time.
---
Thanks for bringing up an actually realistic negative scenario. I hadn't thought about the downsides of a small number of individuals having a disproportionate amount of wealth.
---
I still think the economy as a whole would fare much better than most people are suggesting, but I can definitely imagine some frustrating scenarios like the one you've mentioned.
---
Tou mean bursh? 
---
can someone explain why this user has become so popular?
---
That’s nice but as other people are saying Forbes is swamp-gas tier online media
---
So probably some people doubled their bank with this rollback
---
now it is
---
We need to just mash all the drama into one, to commemorate the shortest month of the year containing the most drama.
---
To be completely honest, that was before I got the drop I was getting mad I couldn't spell aha. Was talking about someone in the cc who uses symbols over the top in sentances aha 
---
Bug abuse has been an offence for as long as I can remember lol
---
Truth
---
Old Ice Poseidon copypasta with a twist. 
---
Then we'll Agree to disagree. There is a reason the GPU plugin, OpenGL, and OSRS HD exists/ed, people want better graphics. Jagex themselves have increased the Graphical details of new content.
---
Consider too the business side, we are operating with little to no micro transactions, and you're bang on with it being older previous players that are coming back (myself included from 04) but they need to reach a new generation players too, and the old school  "charm" doesn't last, it doesn't even run cool on my device like a low poly game should.

Well he’s a UIM so the retarded part checks out 
---
Actually for the most part, they are. 
---
Anyone asking for help in the game that involves giving them free items of any real value should be treated as a scammer. 
---
Same, I got 2 ancient relic drops and was so bummed when I thought they would be gone.
---
What OP said was such an IAMVERYSMART look at me moment. It honestly hurt.

It's an edited Ice Poseidon copypasta from 2+ years ago. 
---
What happened to the ironmen standing on that tile
---
get this mildly homophobic low resolution garbage out my feed boy
---
he's agreeing with you, dude
---
na I just dont give a fuck about karma or stupid overhyped bullshit
---
after like an hour people couldnt pick it up anymore but yeah it was still way worse than the max cash and yet they said it was minor and didnt deserve a rollback at first
---
Engine work
---
Yeah innocent players 🙄 picking up dozens of tbows and rushing to the get to sell them, and using the gold before the bug gets fixed, poor them
---
Was just about to say this lmao
---
 I browse Reddit, Twitter, and Youtube occasionally but I was AFKing NMZ during the time this went down and went to sleep a little while later. Excuse me for not refreshing Reddit every 5 seconds to keep up with the very obvious bug of a fucking Twisted Bow spawning on the floor every 60 seconds :/ guess I'm selfish 
---
I've been out of the loop- what happened with a friend this month?
---
except he’s not a QA tester
---
Bump
---
Everything got rolled back. Not just dailies and such, but trades as well. So yeah, if the sales had not gone through before the update, it returned to that state.
---
Shut the fuck up, i got a zenyte drop from gorillas after being 300kc dry. And i had no bank i am so poor. Shit jagex with their shit mistakes.
---
scaperune respek
---
What’s so special about 82 farming?  99 farming btw
---
yessssssssssssss great reference!!!!
---
i wish i found these funny but i dont have enough seratonin to produce more than a measly smirk 
---
Damn.. Wish I was on. My mate sold 6B lmfao
---
It really be like that to 
---
It only looks that way because of the sun.
---
Some picked it up out of curiousity  or whatever. A in-game message prevents unneccesary bans. 
---
Very naive to think that scorched earth rollback policies are the only way to fix these problems. I'd recommend looking into the Kingdom of Loathing bugmeat if you want to see how in-game economies can be fixed of inflation while adding fun content to the game that costs 30 minutes to an hour of programming and writing. 
---
And FYI, I was asking what should I do and telling a story that occurred to me in OSRS on the OSRS reddit. Where do you get off being so rude?
---
Same. 
---
please do this
---
Typical sweat UI set up for rs3. Most of that stuff doesn't even get used (Maybe not so much in this case)
---
Not arguing with that bc I agree; also Jagex set a precedent when they [returned ironmen their items after that tob glitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8pbg19/comment/e09ywsq?st=JSP3OW6T&amp;sh=6903b2d3). I’m just saying Mod Ash isn’t the one we should always refer to when there’s a problem; he doesn’t do every single job on the team.
---
&gt;Quality content that is no longer "efficient"
---
From what little I know, every (ultimate) ironman series starts off with an entertaining 40 hours of Wintertodt...
---
welp thats lit
---
Yeah, that’s definitely messed up. A database rollback brings the entire database to the same point in time to preserve data integrity and avoid situations like this. So they must be doing something else for some reason. 
---
You understand they have to manually go through all of that an adjust it, and it's probably thousands and thousands of accounts, and they probably only have a couple people at most working on it. 
---
*bursh
---
This update kept me up. You have no excited I was to get my tbow on my Ironman. 
---
the dude used a freshly made account, i call bullshit
---
It's more of a personal goal, but at 82 you can garden pie boost to the highest tier Farming Guild for Celastrus Trees, Spirit Tree and another fruit tree spot. 
---
Dude wow.. get some help, it's gonna be okay.
---
Genuinely***
---
You might find it hard to believe, but I actually fully agree.
---
I wouldn't respond with a sarcastic "ok", because I'd agree with you.
---
I actually stopped playing, but I really love this game and had fond memories of it. 
---
The direction the game has been heading in has alienated me.
---
I lurk this sub for potential positive news that may sway me to return.
---
Unfortunately the exact opposite seems to be happening.
---
Can someone explain how it happened?
---
Three people said the same exact thing and you're the only one who had a sense of decency and understanding about it. Thank you for that sir. It is appreciated and we need more of it online and in the community.
---
Preach!
---
Yeah I doubt they're going to give the sol a slash option. 
---
Pie boost to farming guild tier 3.
---
Regardless, my point is still valid. They can announce an in-game message for a dead man tournament or live steam - whatever, yet can't post an update to alert players of a game breaking bug.
---
Draynor Dock tho
---
I thought it was any amount of coins turned into a max stack of coins

---
*You* thought it was fine. A lot of other people however obviously didn't.
---
This is the exact type of stuff that *is* worthy of an artist's time; making an item look better.
---
Also you make it sound like it took someone days to recolor the ddefender to red lol.
---
Why didnt you just get off and teak a break for a couple hours. You should have known literally everything you did right before the update could get reset
---
Yah... I'm going to need a color picker to compare or something because that looks red to me. It is now near identical to the Dragon Defender (orn), minus the gold, and that looks just as red as any other dragon item.
---
I wasn’t affected and I’m defending the people who were, such bullshit by them 
---
They might have done a roll-back. Either way I'm sure the price crashed for now. Temporary dip even just from people panic selling to keep their gold value after they are a spawning bug
---
If a few hours qualifies add fucked you might want to rethink coming back to the game notorious for grinds that are hundreds of hours
---
How were you affected?
---
My apologies then. I though your point was that these events are very rare in a large timespan and was trying to counter that by noting that these events have been very common in a short timespan :shrug:
---
Your point is invalid until you have proof they're banning innocent players.  Your post makes dumb assumptions.
---
One of these things not like the other!!
---
I'm still annoyed about the pub in lumbridge and the dock in rimmington that were also added unpolled, but the community doesn't seem to care about it any more so it's not worth fighting
---
Days. Gotta be days...
---
That's my actual twitch account, nice
---
Wow lucky 
---
If you were playing with hespori, you wouldnt run outside the farming guild and north. It doesn't make sense to look there. That being said, I have no idea how someone 'accidently' put a spawn there
---
You’d think they would make a backup while the servers are offline for the update...
---
Ah I see, I got 99 before that update so I haven’t even been to the guild 
---
so when is they ban coming lol
---
I agree, is this after the roll back or what
---
ez4ence
---
that's so fucking lazy of them, they fuck shit up and don't roll back to the update launch.
---
since they didn't roll all the way back there's more than likley a bunch of duped tbows in the game anyway 
---
Yeah he lost 50k exp 
---
Only saw one from last year.
---
What was the drama in january? 
---
Probably put the wrong ID in the wrong place. It was probably meant to spawn something innocuous there like a bucket or something. Now there is a funny twisted bush. I’ve made mods for games like skyrim and accidentally spawned something completely different from what was intended by misreading an item id
---
I just saw this and wondered wtf was going on

I think he used a combat dummy to get his adrenaline up and stacked a bunch of abilities there’s a post about it on the rs3 reddit

Yikes. That’s a fuck up on my part.  Sorry.

100% agree
---
https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000982997
---
Answer the question with no, so you can get in contact with them.
---
Other wise, Twitter is your best option....
---
They also posted about it on the Homepage... Also, if they did a game announcement, what would it be? "Hey, there is a bug we're fixing. Don't abuse it, k?" There is a rule against bug abuse and it should be pretty clear that a T Bow spawn is not intended...
---
John C was the reason for it, Reach knew about the bug but declined to report it and instead profited from it
---
Month of the year right here, calling it
---
Thats the worst part. Jad is actually easy too once you kill him the first time. It just makes you nervous when you fight him the first time, and then you make mistakes.
---
I think it took me at least 7 deaths at Jad before I felt confident with the prayer switches.
---
Yeah that’s tough

Defeats the purpose of playing lmao

What if you had logged in on that tile?

Can someone explain each one of these to me? I haven’t been on this month.
---
The higher your combat level the more money you can make really. (Because pvm is very profitable Try to set a goal of getting a dragon scimitar and then your gains will really go up. Then I like to do afk Skilling in between my goals to rest.
---
I was grinding the entire time, so I lost a crap ton of crafting/farming lvls. I feel ya. And just imagine all of the noobs at the GE who are defending Jagex right now because they weren’t affected by it.
---
If i remember correctly there's a temple of light with 3 floors which has a nifty puzzle... Accross the whole temple there are a whole bunch of pillars which you need to put some shapes in and rotate them correctly so they all connect at the end (match by colour too). Problem? It's a whole bunch of running around that temple clicking the pillars while getting a attacked by some ghosts which you can't even fight back (if my memory serves me well). On top of this, if you mess one pillar... if you can find it that's great but if not... then good luck at re-doing everything.
---
Just make sure you use a video guide for it.
---
I wonder if there was enough time to rwt a bunch of duped bows lol
---
he was right numb nuts.
---
Again you are assuming a lot. People do drop parties all the time with incredibly rare items. Someone who is new to the game may not even know it’s the 2nd rarest item. We have confirmation bias on this sub because we all know at least a decent amount about this game. There are people out there playing like we did back in 07 though, with no knowledge about efficiency or strategy and they are just playing it as another game to spend some time during their lunch breaks. 
---

Someone needs their tendies
---
They went to social media before posting on the home page - Check the time the post went live compared to their twitter feed.
---
I mean, the issue here is that there isn't any concrete proof. Obviously you had know way of knowing this would happen, no way to plan for it, etc., but they can't just go handing back items to everyone with a sob story. 
---
For all anyone else knows you got PK'd, or lost them in a stake, or any other number of things. They may be unlikely, but that's the kicker: MAY be. There's no way to know.
---
I can't blame Ash here either. If he does it once, where is the line drawn? Do you refund everyone who lost their stuff and claims it was due to X, Y or Z? People are already saying "but they did it for Jed" and "but they've done it for streamers," so look where that sort of thing gets them.
---
It sucks, but I hope you don't lose heart over this. Dust yourself off, get angry, and kill some more demon assholes. Not much more else for it, I hate to say.
---
Best of luck, OP. I know losing so much time sucks ass.
---
Ice isn't really part of this community any more though
---
Why add a spawn when they can make items with their stupid potato or whatever? Adding a spawn in any case doesn't make sense. I think someone got a new job and was putting in their 2 weeks. 
---
You can hop worlds to do it Infinitely faster. 
---
Compare it to d boots on picture. D boots are same shade red as other dragon items. Its not even near the same red. It has parts that are way more brighter than any other dragon item does. It also has that weird transparent part on the tip of the defender.
---
When you have a job

“They won’t roll back after 1h”

Damn that's a lot of attempts.... That's like 14 hours not to mention all the supplies 😭

They changed lumbridge and draynor without polling it. The quest itself was polled, but it was never mentioned that they would be making significant changes to iconic f2p towns

so are most things tho

There is huge proof.
---
Jagex is capable of seeing when people die, items they pick up, what they have when they log out.
---
THis is all concrete evidence they could easily pull. Proof? Jmods bragging about banning ppl for rwt and telling how they seen it 
---
I get hot chocolate 1 milk cus it's to hot 😋
---
Seriously i don't play much anymore, but it really irritates me that everyone is just shitting on Ash for things out of his control.

Exactly, you gotta expect to have to do jad again in the future anyway. Sorry about this but know there's bigger and better things to come 
---
You’re devaluing my pots of flour on the ground only Ironman. 
---
They said that they’re rolling back tho you idiot lmao also it is very necessary 
---
Yes, but I'm not sure how it affects hiscores
---
Ahh I guess that counts then haha just haven't heard about him much around here lately
---
You’re extra lol
---
they should litteraly draw a twisted bow on the map tile
---
The see through bits (or is that supposed to be shading?) are what keeps it from looking dragon-red. The very core center of it is nearly if not the same color. I dont know what the pale outside is for; example- the hilt. 
---
Hard disagree
---
Dude... literally read any other post on this sub.
---
There was a rollback due to a game breaking glitch. Sorry about your xp though. 
---
Nope. It was after the pick pocketing update. Any drop of coin pouches from a player gave max cash. 
---
Came back from the toilet to see this spam
---
Sometimes twitch chat is a hilarious hivemind..

It got downvoted because you stated that it he was merely staying inline with his 'persona', when in actuality he was furious with the state of the ADC role.

Imagine being such an emotional toddler that you resort to attacking employees on Twitter.

Come on guys fucking leave him alone. Mistakes happen.

Can I interest you in an egg, in this trying time?

Yeah and that was a lot of pures they fixed lmao
---
True, but anyone who picks up more than one should realize something is wrong.
---
Just pick up your complimentary one from the farming guild
---
Just read mod posts,twitter posts by jagex and game post.  You might not get banned but at the same time they said they will be issuing temp bans in the coming days.
---
Sad how far I had to scroll to find a reasonable comment...

Based on the chat I’m assuming pre rollback sooo

Good point. Just update their high alch values to be like 5k!

don't buy accounts virgen

Always A F K, sorry to see you go bro.

not if they sold it at market value, gold moves around a lot in a few days

When it was made, there wasn't an expectation that more than 1 drama worthy thing would happen in a month. It was kind of a meme and less of a tradition
---
This is a great idea. Though you got the benefit of hindsight
---
There's no need for being so nasty to another human being! 
---
ur mum
---
Tbow price went down to 500m lol. Not rolling back would've affected the price permanently.
---
Two hours
---
you sound mad big homie
---
Are you stupid 
---
xp would be such a dumb reimbursment, give me something with money value considering you just potentially fucked me over on a lucky drop or time lost (especially for people without a ton of time to play)
---
What's an ign 
---
And everytime you drop it it instead duplicated itself.

Meet ENCEletics, my Katowice locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing my Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No AUG, no M4, but this time I can't leave Katowice. All leading up to eventually taking on one of CS:GO's biggest challenges: the Major Tournament.
---
MTJY. Would be greatly appreciated.
---
I mis understood my fault, but I understand this game takes a lot of time and would be upset if I was affected in a decent way too, but I’m nonchalant about shit because bad shit happens everyday. I let bad things go easily because there’s no way to fix what happened. Just have to move on. 
---
cause u have big gay
---
Pretty sure this is intentional. There are 8 Skill Reqs and 8 Elven Clans. I believe RS3's Prif (Plague's End) did a similar thing for the same reason. Think of them not so much as Quest Reqs, but Elven Clan Reqs.
---
Special att only works in morytania
---
And here I was complaining about the giant dwarf. That's terrible 
---
They fucked up on the rollback big time. 
---
1- they should have done it asap
---
2- they shouldnt have rolled back with people who didnt get a t bow.
---
3- they have to take responsibility, now they have to spend 3 hours to return everyone’s 3 hours worth of skilling back. It’s only fair
---
Obviously before
---
Crash the economy because this guy lost 50k xp!
---
why
---
[Your post history is pretty funny lol.](https://i.imgur.com/ngXUKQL.png)
---
bruh wasn’t the max cash like 3 months ago or am i losing it
---
I really doubt it’s close to this bug. It affected literally everyone online.
---
I can’t think of a single MMO that’s never had a rollback or server downtime, this really isn’t a big deal. 
---
yeah im not talking about ash anymore though, I know i made a mistake I thought he was literally the customer service guy since he gave woox that 10k I assumed he was the man, my mistake I accept that.
---
I dont know who to contact, the website has no options for this kind of situation thats why im on reddit.
---
I didnt even know mod acorn exist.
---
I don't think hypocrite means what you think it means...

So.. Bush did 02/28 ?

Rsn: riceoftheazn

Items already don't show up to people Jagex should be recording player deaths as separate entities than just special item drops. Although imagine if someone randomly just dropped an item right before the rollback time stamp and picked it up right after. That would be fucky. 
---
A few hundred maybe, compared to tens of thousands of players who were rolled back today. And they only had to reset the pures' defence levels while all progress made during the few hours between today's update and rollback was lost.
---
IF you're quitting then it shouldn't matter.
---
seriously, imagine thinking your kinda rare drops are worth more than the longevity of the game and keeping the economy in tact, dumbass. 
---
Can’t be compared. Pray flicking doesn’t make you rich and crash the economy. Come on now. 
---
Mainly for merchanting, making notes on prices to buy/sell at
---
Yeah gl to anyone. I got hacked for my bank over a year ago and lost 200m. Had an authenticator and 2 step. Never hear back from jagex .
---
I think the hundreds of thousands of dollars they would be rolling in might be used to dry their tears.

Unfortunately the only gold shower I have to offer is likely not a preferable one
---
Holy hell, thats a tremendous drop lol
---
large if true
---
Yeah I'm mad that you can't get through your thick skulls that if they take 3 hours to decide that a rollback is the correct option after refusing to roll it back then a rollback clearly isn't their emergency protocol
---
Why would you snitch 
---
Because 3k people lost 50-200k xp.
---
I read a comment that each clan is "specialized" in something. So my guess would be each clan is specialized in each of the skills, so it would make sense for it all to be even.
---
and the rollback ended up only taking like an hour and everything is back to normal now save for a few instances of rare drops and a few hours worth of xp lost. Can't believe they didnt just rollback immediately
---
I like my job and my shift actually. 
---
To replace the herb patch we're not getting in prif!
---
Minor inconvenience for 3k players is better than ruining the game for literally everyone
---
Yes, because it is easier and quicker to send a tweet then prepare a news article or broadcast an ingame message. But they didn't reply on players checking twitter like you claim; they posted there first but they still posted it elsewhere including the homepage too.
---
You've got your teeny tiny head so far up your flat ass it's not surprising you have trouble opening your eyes but hey, maybe one day you'll get lucky and if you do I'd highly suggest looking in the mirror if your fragile ego can take it (I doubt it - continued ignorance and projection seems infinitely more likely) and at that time I'm definitely open to you apologizing for your past and current inability to use logic or real world experience to contribute accurately to any discussion whatsoever.

Also, maybe like, have 70 be the requirement for doing the stuff with the clans once you're in the city, but maybe have the quest requirements be different.  Like right now you need 70 con to build a house in prif, but you need 70 con to do the quest.  So what's even the point of having that requirement on the house when it requires the quest in the first place?  It's like if you needed 91 thieving to do Ichtharin's little helper.
---
Also, wasn't rs3 prif kind of a sore point in the community?  Feels like emulating it is a little yikes
---
It shouldnt look identical. 
---
&gt; obvious bug
---
Jagex has done so much retarded shit, how the hell am I supposed to know what to do? If we didn't browser reddit, twitter, or the wikis how the fuck would we know about this stuff? Why am I responsible for trying to figure out what Jagex is thinking?
---
Swampletics is a lot of things. Mathematician, scholar, philosopher, engineer, artist, leader. Some would call him a modern day renaissance man. But let this be heard! He is no babyback bitch. 
---
konar drop table and some other stuff i'm sure
---
This is just wrong, I know it was after the pickpocketing update, and while it was because of the code for coin pouches, it was any stackable item that was affected. Look it up. How can you be so confident when you are wrong?
---
Wait. Are my Pest Control points getting rolled back? Literally spent all day grinding yesterday. 
---
Not a scam kid, some people quit in time lol.
---
I really don’t understand Battle Royale games. Sure they’re fun with friends for a few games, but after that they get a bit boring. And what the hell makes Apex so special? Sure it’s a fun game, but in the end it’s a very generic shooter without too much depth.
---
Pretty much. Though if we're going with RS3's Clan system, which it does seem based on, each clan specializes in two things and some like Mining and Smithing are likely the same clan.
---
If you did it yesterday probably not.
---
Frank, is that you? 
---
But muh ezscape

Low iq with a bachelors degree and almost a masters degree noob. You thought they would let you keep them? Idiot.
---
Even killing everyone in falador wasn't intentional, they just stumbled across the bug and found themselves with incredible power. Takes a hell of a lot of restraint (especially as a kid) to not use it
---
The 10 minutes of being afk was nice for doing it while I played other games. 
---
I feel like you guys need developer jobs. Mistakes happen if they didn't rollback I could see getting mad about it. No harm.
---
I went there for my daily treasure hunter chests
---
oh man the price will be in the toilet for a while
---
Thank you for the feedback. Duly noted, may scrap the idea on the next go for the sake of simplicity and overall positive reception 
---
What drama will occur in March?
---
Black jacking on mobile 
---
"If the community wants it!"
---
Jagex is so unbelievably bad at their jobs I don't get it
---
For real though. How does this even happen
---
RSN: ZerkOSRS
---
Jagex has recently been neglecting a ton of things recently, so I don't disagree with you.
---
Pic 1. People were sad because the devs added a new quest, and changed a once useless (but iconic house) to a bar in Lumbridge.
---
Pic 2. In the same quest the devs added a sea port to Draynor, which people thought was dumb because Port Sarim is like 30 seconds away
---
Pic 3 &amp; 4. A Friend, a pretty controversial figure in the community decided to stream one day, where he and his girlfriend started fighting, and the cops were called. Memes ensued.
---
Pic 5. Jagex changed the attack system so that the attack options are always remembered. So if you leave a crossbow on "rapid" it will never reset, and it will always stay on rapid until you change it manually. This however also changed the attack options for people who didn't realize it. That meant that 1 defence pures started gaining defence exp, and many of them got their accounts ruined. 
---
Pic 6. Jagex for some really weird reason accidentally created a Twisted Bow spawn outside of the farming guild when the latest patch came out. This meant that a Twisted Bow would always spawn there, and when picked up would be respawned after 1 minute. This absolutely wrecked havoc on the economy, because now everybody could pick up a bow that was worth 1.2B. A rollback happened, and people who gained exp, money, and pets, etc lost all their progress due to the rollback. The rollback was only like an hour or 2, but was still significant for some people 
---
Stats?
---
Gargoyles or kurasks, easy and afk.
---
They were literally swapped. Attack gave str and str gave attack.
---
I chuckled. 
---
At NMZ you can afk for 20 minutes and not have to run away and come back. Just re pot up with absorptions and rock cake back to 1HP, super combat dose and away for another 20 minutes. 
---
RS3 is alive and well the only issue with it is too few updates ironicly.
---
You do understand that there was no such things as bonds in original RuneScape right? 
---
Secondly I actually played the game durning that period. They could of done a lot of things differently besides removing free trade
---
Kiddo. 
---
Something this big probably required engine work.
---
He didn't sense that Tbows would be given out like sweets on Halloween.
---
How much did the Tbow crash by after the bug?
---
50 give or take for str att and def
---
I was chatting to you in edge bank a few days ago and you already had a tbow! Is that your second? 
---
Yes they will 
---
https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000882638-Removing-Ironman-Status-in-Old-School-
---
who is this?
---
I just went dry again, however the loot was different than pre-rollback. 
---
Still couldn’t afford it 
---
I find it that Verf is actually super nice. He is also very knowledgable and an insane grinder. If you haven't watched his UIM yet, I highly encourage you to!
---
That's a nope from me dog, I have a tendency to read ahead then forget what I had to do
---
"Sorry unfortunately we don't really know what we're doing and can't do things that ever other MMO can do on a whim. If you don't like it though, you should probably just fuck off."
---
If something like this happened at my work, the development team would be reemed for creating the problem in the first place, and for screwing up people's accounts, and whoever spoke to a paying customer like this would be performance managed until they felt like quitting. Absolutely garbage response.
---
Everyone says darts but how much would it cost to get to 99? I'm poor lol
---
should mention im f2p till i get this bond aswell
---
Do you have any sources/anything to share on this? I played rs3 for awhile and had access to prif, don't remember anyone quitting. Like, if you survived eoc and the other crazy buffs, I don't think prif was a deal breaker
---
The time they rolled it back to should be the same for every account?
---
Kurasks for ranged exp and gargs for melee. Kurasks you can stay with alchs and stay until you have enough for a bond and gain some ranged levels. 
---
Of course they rolled us back, I worked verry hard for this, I'm not happy, I will go tell momo, momo will know what to do
---
You underestimate jagex's stupidity
---
Literally
---
Bond gang or retired?
---
why was that happening?
---
I'm currently 75 hp and 79 strength and I was getting around 85k strength xp an hour with dharok but only around 70k with obsidian, any idea why that might be?
---
I traded 800m and it was fine 
---
green dragons is always decent 
---
Ihavthepower. Saving up for a tbow that won't be rolled back or get me banned.
---
I mean... You literally said he's lead DESIGNER. This means that he is in charge of all departments in regards to DESIGN, that has absolutely nothing to do with customer service.
---
The factor is, is his company generating any money other than the investors money? Is he claiming the revenue/success of company by showcasing investors money as profit? 
---
There are many things of question, well actually just one. 
---
They’re like right under 1.5b
---
You would be stupid enough to expect someone just randomly dropped it?
---
Sorry, it is indeed bug exploitation. Not much else to it.
---
I feel like his point is still applicable without taking said “innocent players” into account. They (Jagex) are really bad about relying on Social Media for outreach to the community. Granted I do understand that they are ~not~ some sort of conglomerate or even a large company, by any means; a lot of people, myself included, feel that they should handle their announcements either in-game or on their own website. The forums are a ghost town because everything gets shifted around into oblivion, so the simplest solution could just be revamping the forums with a new design and UI. I know nothing of coding or business practices though so my two cents are probably a little warped. 
---
Fuck man maybe it was. OSRS drama happens so fast I can't keep track. I'm gonna change the wording from "a year back" to "last year."
---
Pretty sure void effect doesn’t affect ogre bows, I may be wrong but that’s my knowledge on it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Depends who you ask.
---
Do at least 1 farming run a day to increase that. 
---
Hunting can be fun if you like to travel a lot or do afk box traps eventually?
---
Else I’d say runecrafting or just any money making skill.
---
Why'd you post this so many times?
---
He's unlucky that he lost anything
---
Oh you’re f2p? Buy members or you’ll spend far too long grinding it out.
---
i reset twice on second turn it worked. thanks
---
What about one way hashing and using a token? It would be much more privacy friendly. In the background we'd only track the token and not even display it to the user.
---
Why does he have like 400k gems in his inventory?
---
Great! Trust me I was a salty mofo this morning until i went to check ge on my alt and it was back to normal. 
---
Hard clue collection lot completion 
---
Pretty sure it does. It effects all range damage, not specific weapons.
---
Try logging in with Telnet.
---
If you see a valuable item on the ground you assume it’s a blatant bug? Some one could have dropped it 
---
Just curious - how do you have a 95m bank with those stats? Genuinely asking because I have around the same stats with only about 30m
---
Looking into restoring accounts that were negatively affected would be a nice start.there can't be that many people who traded something significant at the exact moment their 2 accounts had a lapse in rollback time.
---
This dude just got fucked over for no reason out of many hours of game time and grinding, shit sucks
---
Random factnugget it's Ainsley Harriots birthday today. 62 years of being a spicy legend.
---
Blizzard just fired their support staff aswell
---
He never used either of those words in his original tweet though?

the team dictates the lore though right so, they can justify anything as long as it's done pre-emptively imo
---
Awww I’m sorry to hear that man. Wow so that does change it! Wow okay
---
Tblows*
---
Man you sound pattern
---
I meant in general, not specifically prif, sorry.
---
I did taste of hope and legends quest, not knowing there was going to be a rollback.
---
Cracking open that nieve folder
---
Wish runescape items held no monetary real life value
---
Calculations wrong, it caused a 500m dip in price from all the tbows that entered the world 
---
Its a bug in a video game, it happens to every video game ever made. Calm your tits
---
Quest cape and diaries can motivate you to get your other skills up. After that, you could aim for Raids. There's a discord called wedoraids that could help you out with that. Also joining an active clan for weekly events. The osrs forums is a good place to find a clan.
---
And complete misunderstanding of handling legal situations
---
It's not, somehow. There's a small difference that Ash pointed out when someone transferred money between accounts and it got lost because they rolled back to different points.
---
Fuck you Jagex. Give me back my time.
---
Cheesing that item was Freelo
---
Yes, you can.
---
They dont take 6 hours of work away from 100k players :/ they have a support team for case to case support :/ 
---
But 29 is still less than dirty. Filthy jiggle flox scamming us

I feel you, and I would probably just take it on the chin if it happened to me, but the reality is that I don’t know how I’d feel if this game were a huge part of my life. I certainly can’t blame someone for acting on their feelings about this kind of SNAFU.
---
Of course shit happens, but shit is bad for business because of the resulting backlash. They had to have seen this coming, and should have a PR team for situations like this. Ash spouting insults and deflections on Twitter is SO damn bad for business. I want this game to succeed, and part of that requires a modicum of accountability on Jagex’s side. 
---
I've never seen a more incompetent group of designers.  The Jagex team has seriously gone to trash.  Fire all newfag mods and treat it like a business, we pay for this shit.  Fuckers.
---
haha well its pulled straight from the marks of grace so maybe Jamflex are secretly ICP members
---
What a toxic relationship he needs to leave.
---
Shit like this doesn't happen with other games.
---
Also "it's just a game" is a retarded response and diminishes the fact that the time you spent doesn't care whether it's just a game or not. Spending hours upon hours to make money losing it because of a ridiculous mistake *someone else* made feels fucking awful regardless of whether it's just a game or not. 
---
The dude is probably lying anyway
---
Big fucking deal
---
I've seen the clip multiple times. You didn't read my comment though. Or you're just really fucking stupid.
---
This is pure speculation, but it sounds more like a memorial for the Twisted bow spawn.
---
Yeah answer bitch
---
The bug was in effect before the servers were taken down. Making a backup of the gamestate the moment the servers went down would leave players with all of the twisted bows they'd picked up/sold. So they have to rollback to before the first twisted bow was ever picked up. Which so happened to be at an unfortunate time.
---
Let me be clear: There is never a good time in an MMO for a rollback. Someone, somewhere, is going to get screwed because of it. That's why there have only been a handful of rollbacks in OSRS's entire history.
---
Pixel 3 xl runs it perfectly fine
---
Yikes, dude

100kc isn't even close to the droprate lol
---
I wanted to complete the quest, I followed the guide, I completed the quest. What more could I want lmap.

Do not confuse stupidity with malevolence.
---
I wasn't counting Jed related incidents because they werent bans, just hacks and iirc Jagex support did a fine job at fixing that problem, they ended up giving gold back to all of the victims.
---
Probably lied about so wooohooo
---
This sub is gullible as fuck, no wonder people seem to only phish OSRS players 😂😂
---
Eh only a select few of the sweatiest mouth breathers care about the high scores. Most people would be happy just to have their red symbol still

Can't they just rollback your account further back in the pastor?

---
Because in top of there being no effort to assist the player (like come on if they supposedly could have attempted to remove EVERY tbow like they planned I'm sure they are capable of determining what items he lost and restoring them) there's also no apology. It's like he doesn't care and makes it sound like "that's what you guys get when you ask for a rollback". 
---
What does it mean lol
---
Worth alot tbh
---
Same shit different day, same type of shit happened with sunfire cape, with black cleaver, etc. Won't be the last time those designers telegraph how clueless they are.
---
I don't play the game.
---
What do you mean there is nothing he can do? If jagex wanted to they could track the items lost and restore them they just don't want to
---
WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK IN ALL THE FUCKERY THAT EVER FUCKED?

Wishing you luck in retrieving your items

fysically

For mobile I have a samsung galaxy s4 and my iPhone 6s, the android is old and very slow so I don’t have a very good example but my iPhone 6s can run perfectly at what seems like 60 FPS all the time. So with that being said the iPhone is used for all quests and bosses. 
---
Dont worry dude you didnt miss anything. 5 min after this thread everyone and their mother went and started spam clicking the spawn, every single world was filled, even 100 pop worlds had like 60 people spam clicking the spawn, i know because i world hopped about 80 times before giving up. And also lets not forget in every single world there was a box trap/cannon on the spawn as well.
---
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
---
They did do a roll back several hours ago
---
ORANGE FAN MAD UPVOTE ME NOW
---
Quit
---
Dude that guy needs to get the fuck over it. Like yea its EXTREMELY unfortunate and absolute shit but his post to reddit probably is probably making it more likely jagex will do nothing.
---
I mean cmon think about it, if they personally attend to this guy because he got some reddit Karma its just going to exacerbate the issue of people thinking posting to reddit will get their shit solved. 
---
It really fucking sucks what happened to him but not that many people were effected. His post just makes jagex fuck up look worse than it is. In reality most people lost like 30 mins of xp and MAYBE a handful of people lost a rare drop. Sucks ass but posting to reddit is NOT going to fix it here. 
---
first time I couldnt contain my laughter at work while browsing reddit. F 
---
Damn..... Youre scaring me 😂
---
Iphone 8+ here. Smooth af
---
True. But I did the 100kc with 2 others who didn’t get much too
---
before this situation if i saw an ags on the ground or tbow i would immediately sell it and buy bonds, but i would never think to check other worlds for something so random, i just read about it on reddit but only a small portion of the playerbase visits reddit daily you cant deny there would be people on both innocent and guilty sides
---
[YouTube.com](test)
---
I wonder which mod is the one giving items and selling gp this time...
---
tipoff@jagex.com is technically for ddos, phishing stuff, but you could try that.  In the meantime we should apply the time honored "if everyone acted how I am acting would things work out" logic to determine we don't really want a reddit post per toxic comment made in game.
---
As long as its something obtainable that people want it will always have a real life monetary value. Sorry, thats how economics works. Deal with it
---
Never directly mess with Jagex’s wallet. That’s when they really care.
---
I kind already tell you will never be able to grow a nice beard. I am in the same spot, just accept it and move on this looks hideous. Cant have all nice things in life.

He made an ironman, he doesn't make the best decisions.
---
Usually Im on Jamflex side, but this is awful- what the actual fuck, fuck ModAsh- fat retard
---
That guy is an idiot, but other people have a reason to be upset. An ironman lost some of his gear that took him 50+ hours to get and another account lost 400m that he traded between 2 accounts shortly before the update landed. Those incidents are unacceptable, but they happen because the rollback system is terrible. Hopefully, the Chinese overlords notices the bad publicity and decides to spend a bit of that profit on engine guys so things like this can be fixed before it happens again.
---
Just a hint, it may seem obvious to train melee stats, but ranged is arguably the most important combat skill at high levels and just in general for slayer and killing stuff 
---
You could anticipate them changing their minds after TBow crashed from 1,2bil to like 500mil, that completely fucked up the economy tbh
---
Thanks I'll tell the guy I stole it from.
---
Grandpa\_Ahab in game here. Gimme your bank, I'll take it since they aren't responding lol

Have you contacted @modash daddy on twitter? He responds to people
---
Sounds like ur dumbass fell for it at one point lmfao 
---
It is honestly amazing how active he is on Twitter. Earlier I was looking through his replies to try to find a tweet and I had to scroll so far down just for a tweet like 6 or so hours ago. It took me like an hour to wade through all the posts on here this morning and that was fairly light reading with only a few replies; the time it takes to read and reply to all those messages, even if tweets aren't too long, is easy to underestimate so major props to Mod Ash for managing to answer so many.
---
And irrelevant for months since he burned his entire fanbase
---
Would be cool if a mathematician would break this down and determine the odds of 4 rune square shields dropping. Let's just say for example that rune square shields are 1 in 30 drop. For 4 in a row, that would be 30x30x30x30, right? 1 in 810,000?
---
Has kind of a twisted look to him...

I havent logged in for 3 months made me get a bond and flip tbow so yeah it’s really a big deal

They stated they would fix the problem, but wouldn`t roll back. So that argument doesn`t really stand.

Why not make all quests skippable but you get the rewards?

Was immediately the obvious decision.

No error, so only OS profile is affected.

biggest during it's peak. just like every other majorly popular game during their peaks.

That sounds like some weedscape to me

Turns out it was just a tbow spawn
---
Gratz. Took me 1700 lol

I don't think someone saying negative things in a negative thread will really benefits Jagex much.

Proselyte, unholy blessing, book of law/defender, 2 super att/str potions, and then full inventory of prayer pots.

Then the rest just normal gear for bonuses. 
---
Thank you for the great explanation. I wondered how that happened, but I never figured it out until now. It was very easy to understand from your explanation.
---
They refused to take my semen sample, so I need to speak to some dude named "Dej" who was down an alley nearby.
---
You lost 30k range xp bro that was not 6 hours you wasted. 
---
Because their security system is shit.
---
They 100% have a recovery delay and not allow someone to INSTANTLY recover an ACTIVE account. 
---
Also jagex removed recovery questions which is a pretty good security feature in my opinion.  
---
Ranarr weeds are the big thing that I've noticed. Took forever to get the level to plant Ranarr seeds as well as the Ardougne medium cloak for the farm teleport, and immediately after I got that cloak the price started falling so goddamn fast that farming Ranarr is shit money.

How? Shouldnt he just have the money to sell again??

Yes you can

---
Sounds like ur dumbass was new once lmfao noobie
---
Account got banned, necessary sacrifice for a good cause 
---
Jagex specifically mod West left the tbow spawn on accident because he is a fuck up, not because it was meant to trap rwters.
---
Depends what you're looking to get out of your clues.
---
You can find a list of each clue tier's drops here. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Treasure_Trails#Rewards
---
As for getting a master scroll, trade the scrolls in to Watson AS you get them, not all at once. You can only have one of each tier at a time, so if you're working towards a master scroll, don't hoard them until you get all 4, otherwise you'll be missing out on some clue drops along the way.
---
Your autism level is far to good for me 
---
God is real 
---
itt: people who think someone actually lost 200m
---
Thanks! That’s great info because I would have definitely been hoarding them.
---
Agreed. I am surprised that even now that hasn't been changed when account security should be the top priority for them.
---
;D
---
If you don't think Jagex stores every single message that hits their server to legally cover their ass, you're a fool.
---
If only there was a way to open a ticket to speak to one of the three support staff they have, only for you to wait 20 years for them to get through the queue to tell you that they cannot return your items because the items have been discontinued in game.
---
I imagine the average person picking up a T-bow isn't immediately buying bonds, especially since I'm willing to bet the average member pays the membership and not sustaining memby's through bonds. If anything, I suspect your average person if selling the T-bow, is buying normal gear they might need but couldn't normally afford such as Primordials, Ranger's, Bandos, Armadyl, etc.
---
Gone down like 2k if I remember correctly. Used to be a nice drop from monsters that have an herb table.
---
It’s always the people who try to abuse the shit out of it who get banned. People who do dumb shit like sell it and buy bonds with it. 
---
People who randomly come across it and pick it up wouldn’t and shouldn’t be banned. 
---
Take as much time as you need to make videos! Your mental health comes first :)

---
Wtf.. how is it even snarky or filthy.  You’re just a bitch 
---
Sounds like you could have a bad cache, delete and redownload.
---
Deleted account btw
---
i mean buying bonds with ingame money is a very real form of supporting jagex, whether you want to admit it or not, he said he doesnt but I thought I'd make that point. it's much more than viewing the osrs.
---
cause with the rollback it's like whatever you did is still the same. so let's say they do a 5 min rollback and in those 5 min you got a d claws drop 
---
if they put you 5 min back and you do the same things bam d claws drop
---
Ok I’ll try that, thanks
---
who are you kidding, you'll probably lose the xp anyway 
---
Yeah he's making money off of it so it's valid. 
---
You are not selling t bows for 600m. If you dumped in ge it would be caught very fast. If you tried to do by trade. Word would spread so fast in minutes your world would be filled and account would be locked most likely.
