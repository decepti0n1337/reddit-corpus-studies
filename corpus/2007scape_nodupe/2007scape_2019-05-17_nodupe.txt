I hope you get banned.

---
I'm jk...its still 20 minutes. And I dont think runelite does anything really. To change that. So really weird
---
---
---
I believe pokemon go can detect them because the gps data is not moving unlike real phones. This is possible to get around.
---
got your back homie
---
This sub is so paranoid every time a Jmod leaves, ‚Äújmod left jagex so that means MTX is coming‚Äù
---
F indeed 
---
We love you
---
Thanks for the enlightenment friend.
---
how about we ban RoT so 2200 worlds become playable in the wilderness again.
---
Yeah alts aside slayer is currently very well designed, though unfortunately without using alts it's very slow (but that's ok cause it only means more slayer :p)
---

I don't remember this episode...

It may not be efficient, but you play with the game how you want. It's not all about efficiency. :D thought at said, Dharoks axe alone isn't amazing.
---
Were you still splashing and gaining xp, or just being attacked?  After 20 minutes you should stop auto retaliating, but the npc is still aggressive, and you might stay logged in as long as something is attacking you.
---
During the Christmas event I would agro a man to afk collect snowballs for 20 mins. I would often come back a few hours later and still be logged in, not preforming any action, but the man was still attacking me.
---
Ahh I see. Got over 20m farming xp so I guess in the end it doesn't matter
---
you dont get logged out, you just stop auto retaliating. youll sit there for 6 hrs so long as nobody kills whatever you splashed on.
---
Thanks for putting up with this community's shit. We don't always show it but we do appreciate y'all.
---
Almost no kids buy MTX for videogames lol, most of the income for games like Clash Royal is whales that spend thousands of dollars
---
The original was polled at 30k + 110k, with the specific line
---
&gt;The experience rate provided by underwater Thieving is not comparable to the existing top methods. It will serve as an engaging, fun alternative which allows you to train both Thieving and Agility simultaneously.
---
The buff poll's XP/hr estimates are also under what they should be as players figured out how to get far more tears/hr by optimizing their routes and using Merfolk Trident, so the actual XP/hr ended up being higher than the buff poll's estimate too.
---
&gt;ZMI was an unintended mechanic of people working together, and should have nothing to do with the blog rates as its outside the scope of the average player. 
---
It was an unintended mechanic people were abusing to get far higher XP rates than expected, it was a justified nerf.
---
&gt;The library method is dumb, but if the plugins didn't exist, it should be allowed to exist, the initial creation of the method was amazing
---
I agree, the method is cancer af and was really interesting to see it innovated, and it's disappointing to see the method gone, but it wasn't intended to be in the game so it's fair that it's removed since it was never polled as such. Maybe they could re-introduce it in some way in the future.
---
I dunno if any of you play don't starve but that was one if my favorite parts of that game too. Chop enough trees and one of em comes to life pissed off and tries to kill you
---
I'd even be down with a miniboss themed in a similar way
---
He didn‚Äôt go to war, Jesus man

You had an EXTREME advantage over people who didn't pay. You said yourself you got a few mill, bgs, arma all which someone who didn't pay wouldn't have the same chance of obtaining. It's not that hard to grasp.
---
what
---
At this point Jagex should just start implementing things that will benefit the game.... like paying extra money to use untrabeables past 20 wild and not losing items like defenders or void.
---
Brine Sabre until 60 att then descim for strength training.
---
If you're going to afk fish for xp monks are the way to go as well. Barb is far from afk
---

sandwich lady was the worst. 50% success rate here... Honestly didn't know wtf she wanted me to pick. Not a bread/pastry expert. Always got smacked and had to run back.
---
This is why I log into world 303 as a 2095 total
---
Rune scimitar until level 60 attack
---
Then dragon scimitar until 70 attack
---
Then abbysal whip
---
It's a joke. Obviously it happens to other people... can you not?

Cremedelatim is my username, hit me up in game and ill help anyway i can mate. Happy hunting

r/whoooooooosh

While the first one is good, this one is quite the improvement IMO
---
Just for reference in any skill if you look up "&lt;Skill&gt; Calculator OSRS" on Google, there's a caluclator there that shows you how much it costs, how many you need, etc. 
---
So for this, search for Herblore Calculator OSRS

You better stick around and roast us still. Wouldnt be the same otherwise. And i am 100% legit going to miss the Data Stream.

The rewards other than membership are only available for rs3

Ask for evidence before you make your judgement

I believe you can still claim it. Just remember to cancel the trial after you do it so you arn't charged later.
---
am i the only one that hates jokes that are people making up stories about themselves that aren‚Äôt true to get the ‚Äúwoah i relate to that‚Äù reaction
---
Good riddance, but good luck.
---
Constantly making controversial, favoritism based decisions shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated. Perhaps he was the unlucky one who had to be vocal about the decisions Jagex made; but with his history with Emily and the Runelite situation, I don‚Äôt know.
---
Time spent in your mom's basement is worth approximately 0$ so I think your calculations are a little bit off buddy

I was expecting a crab rave remix at the end

One of the best mods a player could ask for! I‚Äôm excited to see what he does next!

Thank you! That makes sense

A NightmareRH sub in the chat too, those truly were the good ol' days

Nice

How can i stay in NMZ for 20 mins?
---
Im using the obby setup, rock caking to 1, super combat, absorb up to 1000.

Im using Sand Snake, Count Draynor, Tree Spirit, Bouncer and Khazard Warlord.

Usually ill log out after 5

Looking to play osrs again (after years) thanks to the twitch prime membership offer.

Wondering where to look to find out what i should know (eg ive heard of plugins, launchers etc)

Thanks!

Because it‚Äôs attractive and they can‚Äôt do literally anything else.

No

This is bad fucking news man
---
MTX is coming
---
Jagex knows classic WoW and new and improved VR MMOs will kill OSRS and they are about to turn it into their 2nd cash cow with MTX
---
Jagex will never ever make an MMO as good as OSRS again, so they will run this one into the ground. They have no option.
---
This is why the FOUNDing fking Jmod just left.
---
Lil pump
---
I would want to know how many people are getting converted to full time membership. If it's pulled in 1000 new members let's say, that's $11k a month for jagex at the cost of all these bots. Seems like a bad deal to me
---
Runelite does this often after game updates because it stops fetching prices.
---
No, that breaks the third wall
---
This is clearly fake. Alisha isn't at experiments.
---
Shut up you fool honestly
---
Thanks Mod Mat K.
---
Ayiza did exactly that. He was just a community manager for a year or two (a CM at Jagex is definitely not good money) and immediately after saying he couldn‚Äôt continue working at Jagex due to his long commute, he starts streaming. It does feel a little wrong. It‚Äôs like they are almost exploiting all the people that follow them when the only reason they are followed in the first place is because of their role at Jagex. Also have to mention most employees that left Jagex delete their ‚Äòwork‚Äô social media accounts, Mat K has just renamed it so he can keep the followers. Lol
---
This is a really wholesome piece. Good job you guys :)
---
Fantastic argument
---
You really convinced me
---
Do barrows for alil get some money up
---
You could do barrows and mole and some wildy bosses probably
---
No worries - hop in and say hello when you get a chance. We're from all over the place but from what I've seen, some of us have messed up sleeping schedules so sometime's we'll be active; other times it will be quieter.
---
Or require authentication
---
Ic thanks
---
&gt;turn it into their 2nd cash cow with MTX

Implying people will actually stay if there's MTX lmao

Fire cape, fighter torso, obsidian or barrows platelegs, 50 construction and a black mask for slayer.  50 con will let you set up a basic house with all the teleports and an alter to restore prayer
---
yeah but if someone messaged that to emily you'd permaban them. fucking joke
---
Are you on PC?
---
Great to see this coming back. The first Twitch-Prime Runescape Promotion is what got me into the game in the first place! Always great to see new faces :)
---
If you just stand by and watches a crime happen, you're just as bad as the person committing it.
---
This actually made me go a little bit tinfoil hat for a second.

Nice but should have worn iron gloves

Thanks, I might have to give rune  darts a try
---
Whats the message of the picture?
---
Don‚Äôt turn on the light!!!

Glad to see my sense of humour pays off on Reddit üòÇüòÇ

Am I allowed to use runelite? Or can I get banned from using it?
---
Feelsbadman ... hope osrs wont die ... nice drawing btw

micro transactions, like in RS3 with all the buyable cosmetics, Squeal of fortune, etc.
---
Brings a tear to my eye
---
He reacts really casually. Fingers have so many nerves that shit had to hurt like hell.
---
Another great video exposing the ongoing botting issue. It is really discouraging to a honest player seeing others making millions without effort with the use of bots. Why even play fair if you can get away with it?

1/50k chance at lumby cows?

And a 1/5k chance for superior cow to spawn with a 1/3k droprate for pet from That
---
Some of the longest ones too ;(
---
Ohhhh... damn.  Is It confirmed it‚Äôs coming to osrs?  Never played rs3 and didn‚Äôt realize they had micro transactions.
---
Ya I know. When he spawned on top he melee‚Äôd me
---
I would shit bricks if I got a valuable drop at revs on mobile... much more likely to get pk‚Äôd before escaping
---
who.. THE FUCK is cutting onions.
---
Been playing since 06 on and off. Hate seeing old faces leave but I‚Äôm sure it was for good reasons.
---
Jagex is a business, and as long as jmods retain enough power to convince investors and higher ups that most of the playerbase is on OSRS specifically because it doesn‚Äôt have MTX, it‚Äôll continue to not have MTX. 
---
No clue how high that membership cost will eventually go, though.
---
Not memeing but runecrafting 
---
I did mining to 99 to fund my slayer but if i would do it again id do runecraft. That money crazy yo
---
Love the art but it bothers me the range/mage/melee/melee guys arnt all in the same spots as up top but im fucking weird like that i guess
---
This tip got me my first cape! Thanks!

Smart cookie.

You are such a karma whore

Should I do maniacal monkeys or red salamanders for hunter at lvl 60?
---
Ohhh thanks I didn't even notice the flax in the screenshot.
---
Oh shit yeah, I forget they can melee... damn that really sucks dude
---
I don‚Äôt like the change as the gmaul has always been one of my favorite weapons due to it being a cool and unique weapon for lower level members. It will essentially become dead content.
---
Nicely done!
---
Eh, at most that'll just make it so there's a few days of no bots. The botters can easily find someone to write a script to do all the leveling and quests required. It's not as hard as you might think, just more tedious. However, it does make sense to lock the free trail behind all F2P quests. Make people finish the free game and then give them a trail of the paid game.
---
Gooble gobble, gooble gobble
---
But for them it's a good deal
---
lucky for u your bank loot sucked cock so ez to rebuild
---
Sallys better xp, I think monkies are more afk (or at least less click intensive from what I've heard)
---
Yeah crazy, innit? It's not like this company has ever destroyed their own game before with crippling MTX that's completely out of the hands of the passionate developers. It's not like MMK has told us himself he's stood up to absolutely no MTX in OSRS and now he's gone.
---
Agreed
---
I never got that tier 6 in rs2. Only made it to tier 5 :/
---
Mourning's end part 2....

I still remember doing this back in like 2009, i did it blind... took me only around 10-11 hours or something.

I hope the RNGessus is kind with you during the agility checks.

You can tell this guy has a big brain based on his flair.

shits spooky
---
Just happened to me üòÇ
---
You seen Emily's noodz on /r/Runescapegonewild? üëÄüëÄ
---
Waterfall quest is one of them.
---
Also starting rfd and doing what you can there, you wont be able to get b gloves until 175qp but you can get upto rune before that which gives you a solid bis until b gloves and means you dont need to buy granite.
---
Slay slay slay and use range is another one so you can get the fire cape.
---
I digress as for quests after waterfall im not sure i started with getting all of the free ones done first and moved on from there with whatever took my fancy.
---
Its time for us gamers to rise up
---
What do you mean we could have ended it? Also, not necessarily. She probably could've just done it to siphon some money because she's shitty.....
---
I want a Mat K(ape). Just his face photoshopped onto an obby cape sold by Diango.
---
Dragon square shield was literally my best shield while ranging until I got a dragonfire ward, I definitely used it, maybe just because there was a lack of low-level ranged shield but still useful
---
They are fine .. they should leave it like this
---
Pretty sure bots can check what they have in their inventory and react accordingly.
---
is there a guide on how to boost halos or i just  have to do games on the cw worlds ? i kinda want a halo
---
fuck i love a good cry. sometimes you just need it, and you feel better. 
---
hope the mood passes. enjoy your cry!
---
If you want to pvm safely go to literally anywhere that‚Äôs not the wild?
---
Not that I'm defending rot but you know anyone can't just join a clan like that any time they want lol
---
Probably auto clicker timed to click once every 4 minutes or something.
---
Wow this is awesome
---
I have to agree that when the first thing you see when asking for real, human help, is a fucking reddit bot and a dozen people jerking it off I can‚Äôt imagine the message ‚Äúhey you know there‚Äôs a suicide hotline right idiot?‚Äù doing anything productive lol
---
Sex sounds like even more of an xp waste than banking Zeah books, at least I got some Hunter xp out of the books. :\^)
---
Love that MMKs sword is damaged and bloody in the 2nd, such a great detail to think of adding, though the whole thing is a masterpiece. OSRS community is so blessed to have THREE top notch artists among us, you guys are fucking awesome. Great post.
---
Funniest thing I‚Äôve read all day tbh
---
shut up dude. your just arguing for arguing sake. boting is not cool and that is that. jagex agrees and so do most players. there is an advantage and yes if ppl did it then i have no problem with it cuz thats how the game is supposed to be played. i dnt care about your opinion if it supports breaking the rules because your opinion doesnt matter. you are wrong in this opinion and you know it. pkers usin this bot can be asked to use legit scouts instead of gaining advantage using bots. idc about your stupid opinion you have no leg to stand on.  your just wrong kid.
---
The best option you have is in the native client you can set a minimum amount that will trigger a notification in your chat window that the item is dropped and what it is worth. It's no RL but it's something.
---
Now do the ‚ÄúI miss her so much‚Äù ginger snapchat meme guy
---
Huh just realized you play the exact 2 games I play, OSRS and PUBGXbox. üòé
---
Just in time for summer Pog
---
Are you ever on twitch? I feel like a solid 80-90 percent of twitch users know her
---
Works both ways to be honest!
---
It would usually cost about $7 but since I work at the library I got it for free :)
---
^^I ^^Am ^^Smol ^^Brain
---
I don't get why nerf the rc from zmi and library. Specially zmi. What's next? Kill ess running on lavas? I feel like this kind of attitude might kill the game flavor and make it feel less like a sandbox. It was never an imbalanced method and ess running existed since 2000 and fucking 5 or so.
---
I see you too are a man of culture. ;)
---
The fact that some people think otherwise is unbelievable, lmfao.
---
I just spicy stewed to 75 and royal seed poded to Grand tree which is right next to a gnome
---
When I say 65k over the polled rate I lied. Its way more than 65k over polled rate, the 65k over rate just assume that it competes with the best method which is specifically is said it wouldnt. And I quote because you have reading comprehension problems: *The experience rate provided by underwater Thieving is not comparable to the existing top methods. It will serve as an engaging, fun alternative which allows you to train both Thieving and Agility simultaneously.* They did poll a buff to swimming but it wasnt a balanced one because JageX dont know how to balance content and they dont understand how rates or multiskilling works. Thats why they need people like me to lecture them on how that works and how it should work.
---
F2p or p2p?
---
F2p is kinda rough as far as money making goes. You'll want to use the grand exchange, not a general store.
---
  
---
P2p you can start making passive gp by doing farming runs and your dailies. Other than that, without knowing your levels, I'd recommend just doing slayer.
---
If you haven't listened to the video why are you even asking questions...
---
Thank you for being the hero we need, but don't deserve... Even a little bit...
---
Yes, I think that‚Äôs my favorite part!
---
Who is gertjaars?
---
Deadman players would like to have a word with you.
---
It's art, interpret how you want
---
What was it like before they significantly buffed the xp?
---
haha hell ya man! Great thing is i can play both at the same time.
---
I‚Äôm just imagining reading the syllabus:
---
&gt;By the end of week 1 you need to have an account ready to trade on the Grand Exchange. This will require you to create an account, complete tutorial island, and roughly 4-5 starter quests.
---
&gt;This course will also require a membership of 3 months, this will cost you approximately $30, have this done by end of week 1 as well
---
I was recently banned today for the offense of ‚Äúmanual ban‚Äù. I looked into what this mean and it says ‚Äúfraud and community endangerment‚Äù. I have literally no idea what this means. I tried to appeal but it‚Äôs a perma ban so I tried tweeting mods and no response. I never broke a single rule in game because I wouldn‚Äôt want my account at risk. I‚Äôm a max med who was about to get 99 str and then I log on today to see I was banned. Again, they didn‚Äôt give me any reason why I was banned and quite frankly it‚Äôs absurd. 
---
There‚Äôs been cases like mine where people see screwed over by JAGEX and can‚Äôt appeal or even speak to a person about the issue. I never had a single offense on my account and I‚Äôm banned without explanation. I don‚Äôt want to quit but this is a really shitty situation where JAGEX bans yet another person without explaining to the user why he/she was banned. 
---
My RSN is :Nerdist
---
This.
---
Not saying I wasn't planning on arguing about it though, but maybe he had a great point and I wasn't
---
We'll never know :shrug:

This belongs in r/OSRSReports

Slepe
---
Halfway to 2000! xd
---
If you were already playing rs in 07 youre likely not gen Z
---
Ah i see. Yeah it is a very short course too and you have to be somewhat attentive. I just throw on random youtube vids honestly. IMO when it comes to agility or those skills i just want the fastest exp available lol, dont really care about other factors really. Just cant stand the slow ass boring skills. 
---
Ugh and i really need lvl 80 for cerb. At least 75 then i can boost. I'll boost to 70 once i get 65 tho and do some cerb lol.
---
They poll the max xp rates, not the average xp rates. How is he being a twat? He is completely correct.
---
Using Fire Wave in NMZ is decent, and definitely better than splashing and alching. Why are you avoiding the other methods, if you don't mind me asking?
---
[deleted]
---
yea but running in circles at seers relleka and ardouwngdjg are just easier
---
Bursting is a bit expensive for me, splashing seems expensive (could be wrong).Alching is great, but I get tired of clicking after a while.
---
Wireless keyboard. Set all keys to left click. Put under pillow. Go to sleep. tada. Does not work if u sleep still. Then u got to shell out for a custom made pressure pad mouse and put it under chest so when u breathe it clicks.
---
lmao
---
Ahaha, I'll tell him that
---
I remember Mod Mat K being on the player moderator curation team. He was always a pleasure to deal with even after I lost my p-mod status.
---
your mindset is a great way to make almost zero progress while you play and burnout due to how slow the game is.
---
Another Rot sleeper cell account trolling. Can check his post history.
---
What app/program you using for remote desktop?
---
Bursting/barraging is break-even on Dust Devils and some profit on Nechs, and splashing is definitely a waste if you're fine with getting HP XP. Fire Wave in NMZ is like splashing, as you're still using runes for no drops, but you're getting the proper XP from dealing damage. I still recommend bursting, but to each his own. It's important to play the game how you enjoy, not how you're told to (unless that's what you enjoy lol)
---
got proof? or are you just witch hunting
---
If you haven't changed your password do it now and it should give you an option to quit all current sessions. So if they are still logged in they will get booted off.
---
I suggest a password that is 4 random words that have no relation to each other and around 16 digits long. It makes it easy for you to remember but hard to brute force. If you change it on your phone there's a better chance they can't get you password as your pc could be infected. also make sure you email and rs login password are different :)
---
You really have to find your own path based on what you enjoy. Quests are super efficient to do early if you enjoy them, but slogging yourself through them over and over might not be the funnest thing.
---
Oldschool btw.
---
NMZ with a black Salamander is basically free, it's not as fast as other methods but it's cheap and better than splashing.
---
They‚Äôre the rarest food item in the game because hardly anyone plays the mini game and they‚Äôre rare from that as is.
---
Why did you have no food?
---
Alching isn't that big of an issue as there are gp sinks in the game, but yeah it's crazy to think that BASICALLY scythe costs approx. 1,500,000,000 gp so it's literally 1.5 billion time more expensive than a single gold coin
---
One of the houses in meiyerditch that isn‚Äôt used for the quest or any other content
---
Why would I take anything you have to say seriously if you are too dumb to even take a screenshot?
---
Post 99. For 200m skillers. You also need to factor in the GP earned while doing the task instead of doing Tzhaars/Marks as that GP could be spent on other skills. And even if it is the most efficient way post 99 literally who gives a shit? wow! post 99 nerds upset they have to do underwater content for most efficient EHP but get nothing out it but a sense of accomplishment.
---
Are you standing in the center? If you're in a corner sometimes you can have time where you're not being attacked. If you haven't touched anything on the client for 5 mins and not in constant combat you'll get logged.
---
Surely most people don't create more than 5 accounts in their life. Dedicated players with alts maybe 20-30? And it takes less than 5 minutes if you run through it. You aren't losing anything. The only people with a "legitimate" reason to be happy you can skip it is botters.
---
Thanks MMK. This era really is winding down.
---
It's honestly the sound people are after. Just background noise.
---
Something tells me at least 50% of that sub is 20somethings and at least 100% of honorknees69 is 20something lol
---
I would do monkeys, they are a very pleasant way to train hunter. If you can bear the grind, chins/sallys are a lot better, but if you find them obnoxious, monkeys is fantastic.
---
You weren‚Äôt maxed the were you if you didn‚Äôt have 99 str
---
At least unlock the push up/sit up emotes trust me it's worth it   :   \^)
---
Thats way to op no support
---
That ain‚Äôt it chief
---
Or you could read the improvement blog and shut the fuck up because they knew the rates and had adjusted the content and people voted it in. Yall had your chance to say no. Now you post 99 nerds want to get salty because a method is like ~10% better but offers shitty rewards? lame. 
---
    *You can choose to share the XP between both Agility and Thieving.
---
    This will give the same XP reward that you're currently getting when you loot the clams and chests, i.e. 196 Agility XP and 718.5 Thieving XP if you're at level 99 in those skills.
---
     
---
    You can choose to allocate the XP only to Agility.
---
    If the existing Agility reward at level 99 is 196 XP, the game will double that and apply a 25% penalty, giving 294 Agility XP.
---
    That would give an estimated hourly rate around 67k at level 99.
---
    You can choose to allocate the XP only to Thieving.
---
    If the existing Thieving reward at level 99 is 718.5 XP, the game will double that and apply a 25% penalty, giving 1077.8 Thieving XP.
---
    That would give an estimated hourly rate around 262k at level 99.*
---
gee whats (67/.75)/2? (262/.75)/2? hmmmmmmmmmmmmm? Idk man kinda seems like they knew the rates and so did you. So stfu! you da noob~~~~~~~~~
---
I did a Freaky Forester random yesterday, and there was a splasher there. They're literally everywhere.
---
I was maxed.
---
Highkey looks really good tho
---
only if the shortcut has a 6 second long animation
---
Crab time? =o
---
Justiciar cape, lul
---
but a bitch to type up

I have to take it seriously, I'm a teacher =-)

Anyway, memes aside, the driver analogy makes sense to me. The earliest days of driver's education were spent driving a car in a parking lot. When I learned to drive a motorcycle, it's the same thing. If there's people at the beginning, there might be trolls, jerks, etc. who can ruin the experience of new players because that's how they get their jollies in a day. 
---
As for the next part, yes the tutorial island doesn't cover all the F2P skills, but should the new tutorial have to as well? It would just show the surrounding areas where people would start, give them some experience in the areas just like what you suggested, interacting with the real world?
---
Looks like a suicide...damn shame. 
---
Wrap it up boys.
---
Fire wave isn't a burst lol
---
I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that they were used for RWT since they‚Äôre so rarely sold on the grand exchange.
---
no i dont understand the meme
---
There are gp sinks for gold.  But with too many items, prices go down and gold is worth less.
---
If 100 Dbones are sold every 10minutes then let's say people are wanting it enough to pay...1000gp.  Now let's put up 2million dragon bones into the market.  1000 gp suddenly buys way more dbones because supply is way over demand and people begin to sell their dbones for less since they wont sell.  Gp value has lowered, counter inflation.  As for shops, these are moreso item SINKS.  Buying runes, servants, paying to use services(al kharid), buying fish food because you miscounted, barrows gloves, charter ships, buying better axes at Bob's, buying battlestaves... shop values are specifically designed to be way worse than selling on the g.e. to avoid it causing inflation anyway. And instead people end up spending more gp with shops than they do getting gold from sold items. Why would anyone sell to a shop except for ironman? Which btw, shops are nearly necessary for.
---
Shops help more than they dont.
---
I don't follow Destiny and haven't played since like D1's fourth expansion.
---
Inwas planning on playing it on pc but it died on me no long ago and i am on my university finals. So mobile until i get the new one but i enjoy the game so i dont mind. Hahahahaha
---
Your split for a max cash stack in a 100k member clan is 20k
---
Might as well pk for glories, mate.
---
Most of the people who left RS3 left because of the combat changes.
---
75 FM  70 cook and almost 60 agi with combat stats in the 30s.  Interesting
---
Also since Matt K is gone can we add max cape as a reward from some form of randomized loot reward system purchasable with real money
---
That poor soul
---
I love this series
---
Only problem with phone numbers is some people have multiple accounts.
---
I'll probably do slayer for a bit, it gets really boring after awhile though. Also, I don't have a fire cape yet haha, or even void so maybe I'll focus on those.
---
Welp, got my ass handed to me in the wildy for the first time today while I was killing chaos druids
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What is the best gear (55 att/55 str/53 def) I can wear in the wildy while doing tasks like this to give me more of a shot against PvPers? I was rocking full rune; is that sufficient or should I protect more against magic, etc?
---
blehhh not looking forward to hard/elite
---
Phew, thought he died. Phew.
---
Kandarin hard diary, super worth doing. It also gives more 10%chance that a bolt special atack will proc with is nice.
---
It'd have to be a BH hood otherwise you could just farm kills on your alts.
---
Are you annoyed by Bob Ross? Or the agility rooftop guy?
---
They should make an NPC of you that I can throw rotten tomatoes at
---
Phone numbers actually can be mass produced. So can google accounts.  This wouldn‚Äôt solve the problems. 
---
Not to mention most bots use a 7 day free member trial, suicide bot, then get banned or make enough to keep bonding the account.
---
Oh ok, OSRS is the first Runescape game I've played so I wouldn't know
---
They could allow x amounts of accounts linked to a number and ban all linked accounts when one is banned for botting.
---
Man I dunno that looks really under powered to me.
---
It's best keeping it that way, honestly the only thing I can say what I like about RS3 are the quests and that's about it.
---
Depends what build your going for but generally you would do a few quest like waterfall then sit at sand crabs, for mage you can splash in lumby. Let's say sir pugger could easily have 3-5 accounts afking off screen for specific builds while he's actually pking.
---
Second
---
fair, doesn't make it any better for jagex to legitimize it though in my opinion.
---
Why am I crying in the club right now..
---
Should be no effect. Also rouge set only affects pickpocket earnings, not success chance
---
When do you unlock screen capture?
---
Nah fam, 75 attack before 75 strength so you can use arclight on Skotizo for bossing.
---
It's 1/300
---
[Yeah, OSRS has nothing like that](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bond).
---
yeah i figured that was the case. it happened so fast lol i had no idea
---
cheers
---
H
---
whats your ign? my friend tipoff wants to know

Best gear in PvP? To have the best gear and stats in OSRS? Idk? That‚Äôs kind of a stupid question if you ask me.

Lol the worst part is omw back to lever there was a pkr and I had to pay him 1m to get off me
---
Let's delete the game then because it's already public knowledge that there's quest bots in the game. Everything in this game can be automated just due to the nature of the game. F2P players have to get 7 quest points to get free trade and there's plenty of bots already automating that process. Upping the requirements again won't change anything, it'll only delay the bots for a short amount of time.
---
I‚Äôm in a long term relationship, so no. It‚Äôs not white knighting, it‚Äôs called human fucking decency.
---
Whether or not most players get it that was is irrelevant. What matters is that the cape can be achieved in around 4 hours with no real skill involved.
---
No textbook and ONLY $30?! The cheapest class in history.
---
I've had 5 quests left long before I had 8 quests left..
---
Pugger is doing God‚Äôs work
---
Big F for you my man, that blowsssss.
---
Then why is construction so high? It‚Äôs a brainless skill that takes at most a couple days to get.
---
maybe, and this is just a wild shot, jagex just actually isn't tryna do much to stop the bots currently.   
---
A wild concept cus 'they delete hundreds of bots' etc etc etc
---
He joined the OSRS team???

Jesus this picture hit me in the gut. I first started an account in ‚Äò04 I think. As a little middle schooler figuring out and enjoying the game with my friends, I cant express my gratitude for the Jagex team that made the game/community as inclusive and fun as it was. Some of my best memories from middle school were mining coal with all my buddies in the mining guild, killing cows in lumbridge while I talked to my crush on AIM, fishing lobs with each other in karamja, nagging our friends mom who didn‚Äôt give a shit about her credit card to take out $5 every month so we could get members, getting scammed by strangers, getting scammed by my friends, scamming my friends back, spamming sales in Varrock bank, getting my first addy 2h, mining ess for days on end and then taking all of it to world 66 to law run. making crazy money making plans with my buddies after school (We‚Äôll get 99 mining and smithing and make a killing selling rune 2h), eventually picking flax together, making bowstrings, fishing together in Taverly, failing terribly at pest control and castle wars, cutting maples and yews to up our cash stack, trying to level slayer so we might eventually get a fabled whip drop from abby demons, killing rock crabs with each other for weeks on end, finally hitting 75 attack and strength, constantly having to remind each other that range was for weaklings and att/str/def was were it was at. Down the line once we had obligations, logging back in to see my same friends I pretend to be adults with on a separate world, messaging them something funny and swearing to each other we wont mention that we‚Äôre still playing to anyone. Giving it a shot every few months to try and recapture the nostalgia. Having a few hours of bliss until I realize the boys aren‚Äôt logging back on. We‚Äôll still have drinks, grab lunch, help each other with projects around the house. But we‚Äôll never be on world two again with each other to cut willows or mine coal. The picture of Mod Mat with all the young adventurers blasted me like few pieces of art have. Reminded me of the great times that were, and to look forward to the adventures we need to make.

is it possible to get the negative magic bonus necessary to splash on a 1 pray pure wielding a mud staff and a tomb of fire?
---
I can only think of getting to -60 with iron plate/body/helm/legs/boots and vambraces.
---
Is this possible with a 1 def pure w/ prayer?
---
This unironically sounds cool.  Using RS metals as a unique tier system.  Dragon would probably be the de-facto highest, which sounds fairly cool and also incredibly edgy/somewhat silly, but maybe it could go further.  Barrows Tier, or something.
---
ü¶ÄBonds are already MTXü¶Ä
---
Are you saying jagex would discriminate against someone with a degree in woman studies and not hire them?
---
Oh nice
---
right because my lack of bias clearly means that the people i talk to who have 99 slayer, cox/tob capes, or both, are magically less representative of the population.
---
cox and tob are absolutely harder to learn than slaying, but 20 kc of learning and they're just another activity. what personal experience with these are you speaking from?
---
&gt;At the most fundamental level we just want more people to kill. 
---
okay, that's fair. It's more about how to do that though where people are running into issues. How do you make pking more attractive to non pkers? How do you make pking more enjoyable to current-pkers?
---
&gt;Pvmers/skillers dont vote yes on content that incentivizes them to take risks which is why the polling system is flawed.
---
I'd argue they do? Chaos alter, revs are recent examples.
---
&gt;In my opinion the best gp/h pvp and Skilling content should be in the wilderness and I think most pkers would agree
---
Sure, but there are a lot of people who don't like pvp at all. Having to pvp to be efficient is not something a lot of the playerbase would support. Revs are an excellent middleground where protected and free farming you hit like 7.5m an hour on a 4/4 world, closer to 8 or 9 on a 3/4 or less world. Chins are great, probably the most functional because theyre stackable, somewhat close to multi line etc, but even then people don't like those either.
---
The wildy could be good. However, scouts, alts, singles teams, pj mechanics, line of site safespots etc make the wildy really unattractive for a lot of people. Personally, I'd rather see more content allowing pvpers to interact with pvpers above all else as right now there's quite a bit of pvper farming pvm/skiller interaction content
---
&gt; I mean she works for Jagex, so obviously that's not true
---
lmfao jagex is like 60% diversity hires.
---
A lot of people on this sub are drooly titty animals themselves I'd imagine.
---
OSRS started exactly like the game was in 2007. Since then it's had a million updates that's taken it in a way different direction then RS2 actually went. OSRS is nowhere near the same game RS2 was in 2007.
---
WoW classic is going to be EXACTLY like WoW was when it was current. There aren't going to be any more changes or updates to the game, it'll progress exactly like it did from 2004-2007.
---
So there's no additional developer work to do in WoW classic. There's no polls, because there's no new updates.
---
So at this point, there's not really a need to be hiring more and more people, as the game is basically finished.
---
Lmao what is going on in the chat
---
Loooooool browsing someone's history. This man is actually upset and fully committed to his white knighthood.
---
While I agree, you have to realize this is the 2007 version of Runescape, not 2001. It might not be OG, but it's definitely a staple of the game.
---
dead meme continues to be flayed.
---
That tediousness is much more than the cost of a bond though so it‚Äôd make a difference in that regard though

Imagine he starts working on classic wow for blizzard... He's already shown he can turn a reboot into a massive success.

I was in your boat for the longest time, this is my favorite pet too and it was the only boss I‚Äôd religiously grind. I did 3205 kills and while the first half was total aids and I had to force myself to do each kill, the second half wasn‚Äôt that bad as I got used to it after 1500 kills or so. Many times I went 500 kills without an unsired but don‚Äôt give up, every time I went dry it never lasted forever, and when you break the dry streak you‚Äôre gonna be getting unsired left and right. Yes this boss sucks for many reasons we can‚Äôt change, but all I can say is it sucks more having 800, 1500, 2000 kills or more and walking away without pet. I thought I was gonna have to go 5k or more dry as I saw someone get this pet at 10k kc, but the other day as I was doing my religious sire grinding I got the pet on my 29th unsired and I nearly shat. Don‚Äôt give up boys, it‚Äôs aids but it‚Äôs worth it
---
Use runelite.
---
ONLY get it from runelite.net
---
There are phishing sites with similar names

Is all you do assume things? Most people this, Jagex this and that? Do you have anything tangible apart from your opinion and jagex' stance on macroing/botting. Unless you have anything better to say, your opinion is just as shit and wrong. Stop assuming things for you and just for the sake of assuming, kid.
---
Petition for op to buy the poor kid a new pair of shoes?

They were used in junk trading to go over the trade limit. People would lend items like d claws or party hats for mils per 24 hours. You could put up 1 min cake and it would allow them to trade over like 1m cash or whatever. Also allowed trading over the trade restriction for rares and such
---
pretty damn decent if this is OC
---
Doubt it tho
---
I got a dragon harpoon drop yesterday. It was my 1st time doing them for a slayer task.
---
How big an incel are you to hold a personal grudge against MMK for emily shit? That went down 5 years ago, let it go.

You don't get to decide where LGBT events happen in real life, or video games. Welcome to reality, idiot.

The man was loved by this community based on the thousands of up votes on the sub today. There's no need to shit on him while he's walking out the door. That's petty. 
---
^yahooooo!
---
the thing is that mr Mat K was the man himself who said "nope, osrs aint getting mtx".
---
now that he left jagex, something might actually happen
---
Fuck it why not. Ironman tears hopefully too
---
Nice projection haha
---
yikes

When I started playing Rs my mom would not let me pay for membership with her creditcard. A friend I played long time with finally got membership and would come to f2p from time to time. Every time I saw him, I saw all these cool items that I never seen before. White boots, new capes, purple necklace. Shit was crazy. I wanted that stuff too. He also gained so many levels in a short time. 
---
One day my school friend said he memorized his moms creditcard and would buy me membership if I gave him candy. 
---
The next day I was finally a member and got some sweet colored boots

Make sure passwords are secure, pins are set and you have an Authenticator.

Mod Mat K is leaving Jagex :(
---
The trial should be Dragon Slayer reward. It's something new players should and something that botters won't bother doing.
---
Wait until you have to train for the new elf quest..

i had to kill over 600 of him to get tassets :Thinking:
---
weird, i swear i did a bronze dragon task right before i started.

6 hour log happens not mattering if you are afking stuff or in the middle of PVP. You get forced logged after 6 hours of playtime.

Obviously staged. SAD. BIGGAY
---
You‚Äôre just mad you got killed by jad 8 Times in a row.
---
Wasn't he responsible for the whole "Either bonds or no F2P" ultimatum?
---
The thing about the deep wild is that maxed mains can pile you. Even zerkers get bullied by them. I think you will like the last man standing rework though, it's going to be about tribridding.

I tried it to see if it was a viable money maker. Not really, not very fun either.

New Chinese owners of Jagex probably don‚Äôt like the fact he is against micro-transactions.
---
Feelsbadman btw :( sorry
---
el moo, 
---
nice.
---
Im pretty sure they did acknowledge this as an issue already when they changed the polling results to hidden.
---
You do have a point about PVMing today being catered to and its the fact that they have come to EXPECT 0% risk for 100% reward (well, practically 0% risk since the only risk is 100k per death at Vork and ToB). So that means content that forces them to actually experience risk, (like with PvM content in the wilderness) they are mostly completely averse to it because they have been conditioned otherwise throughout the years. This was not a problem back in the day because death mechanics were a thing and there also werent fairly consistent high GP money makers like Vork/Zulrah/Raids/Hydra etc. Theres also the fact that most of the content in the wilderness simply isnt worth doing for many PVMers because it doesnt come close to the GP/Hr of PvM outside of the wilderness while also carrying much greater risk at the same time (besides Revs but, realistically youll be lucky to consistently make 2m+ per hour all the time there because of how camped they are, of course they can be 4-5m+/hr if you pay for protection but thats different...it removes the risk just like they are conditioned to expect). 
---
Ultimately PvM content in the wildy is a major piece of the puzzle in making the wilderness not completely dead anymore, since its basically what attracts more PKers into the wilderness, both things are connected.
---
The worst is having these same people who vote every PvP update into the ground the past few years, then getting mad over Jagex having to put in updates for integrity reasons (like F2P TB which, for whatever reason people are livid over even though its a massively positive thing for F2P pking and it literally would not even effect 99% of those people since they don PvP, let alone F2P PK) when its quite literally their fault for preventing anything PvP from entering the game. Or even worse, when they think they are justified in doing it because they feel like their opinion is right over PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY PVP and understand what problems exist and what needs to/should be update in the game based solely on their own personal bias'.
---
Honestly im pretty worried that many things that were talked about in the latest blog still wont make it into the game since a majority of them were not just being put into the game without a poll. Does Jagex honestly think that these same people arent going to continue to vote no to PvP updates or something? They need to either somehow setup a poll where its directed only at the PvP community or discuss potential changes and what the community wants with a bunch of PvPer representatives and then simply put those things into the game without a poll since we know they will fail.
---
Its funny since those same people claim OSRS is such a great game because of the fact they "listen to the community" so much, but thats ONLY if its something outside of PvP. With PvP, they specifically dont fix things that people who actually do PvP want.
---
*Gives MMK assless chaps*
---
Would admit that I bought enough bonds so I wouldn't have to grind for gp. Right now bond in terms of gp is not worth that much. But if prices keep on inflating and they end up like 20m per bond, the mtx aspect is more visible. Me and my gf buy 1 bond on rs3 per 3 months, and we survive because of it. This will defo happen in the future of osrs that a bond will be worth a shitton more.
---
3205 with 29 unsired and I just got the pet 2 days ago after a lengthy grind. Don‚Äôt give up! I feel your pet coming soon

Hey Shaun - I've replied to the message you sent to me directly

Haters don‚Äôt know how shit this grind is, got pet on 3205 kc, grats man

Nah. We like being on his dick. We pay; we gay. Troll go away.

Form an alliance between the gnomes and dwarves, mount the dwarf multicamera on a gnomecopter and you get Google street view in OSRS.

I heard the wiki guys were working on a Google maps-like thing for the wiki, just for route planning though.

Hi! Started yesterday and I've been doing some starting quests: what should I do/focus on doing in the start? Leveling? Armor? Just quests? Is the member only content amount bigger than free content? I'm enjoying playing but I'm really confused :(

They are Both cannons tbf
---
Pretty frustrating that they only picked 1 of the top 10 comments from the reddit post

Bro are you okay?
---
0/10

MONCH

10/10
---
OK.
---
Overgrown? Or wily?
---
Also, death runes blocking screen.
---
What did you?!
---
Just how he's been with the game for 13 years since a lot of us were only small. Now we are all grown up and I wanted to add the different armours from when the game first started compared to where it is now
---
Damn you were quick to milk this.
---
mom said its my turn on the shamans
---
There is no wrong way to play. Focus on quests. You'll find quests with good rewards but with level requirements. You now have reasons to level those skills. Keep setting short term and long term goals.
---
If they were American he would have been perfectly safe, he's not black

There's a discord as well, fairly sure it sees consistent though small use.

back story?

Because they cant get sub 85 inferno, top kek.

cape of legends which is slightly less embarassing than an obby cape
---
Which is exactly what some people did in RS3.
---
Also much cheaper.
---
My memory may be off but I believe it was last year.
---
I'd smash.
---
Very nice when you have. DHL or DHC. Also nice when you get the dragon harpoon drop.
---
Golden nuggets

They might, it‚Äôs just not an official mod thread
---
You ruined my friday
---
The focus of his question was specifically slayer, not streaming
---
I don't get it
---
Just bad at bossing in general. Can't properly use f keys, tick system throws me off etc.
---
Got to Jad like 15 times. I just lost interest in completing it. It's no fun wasting lots of supplies and 40 minutes for each try and then dying.
---
Maybe I'll get motivation again someday and grind it out until I get lucky, but I doubt it.
---
Yeah he defo bought gold to be fair, all his stats were 1 apart from the combats and he was wearing all that stuff, I don't think he made his mills from his 61 slayer lmao
---
&gt;gay rights are a controversial opinion
---
Literally 98% of rs bosses have a safe lobby literally sq away from the boss room,
---
I dont think mmk will stream for long. B6t thats just an opinnion. 
---
I assume he has some sort of a break before his next job starts.
---
Fair call man. 
---
Its definitely possible without f keys. But is easier with em. 
---
Hope you get motivation again. Your first cape feels soooooo good man.
---
How is this an argument against anything lmao?
---
I have gone back and it says ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù but I‚Äôll check again soon
---
Ive afkd on the pier. 1000s of ppl do
---
I got mine at lvl 80
---
Try resetting your xp tracker before starting your task.
---
$3000 one off script vs paying $3000 for bonds daily hmmm..
---
They didn't have demonic conjuring as part of the skill before I suggested that it was the exact same thing.
---
Before they just had the skill where you make robes and imbue rings.
---
There are many other activities that also not only make you money, but also progress your account/stats.
---
Ah ok
---
This makes me sad, I got back to back dark claws on my 1st 2 kills and it won't even let me alch one of them.
---
Yes, you run for longer, graceful is extremely useful, and some quests simply have an agil requirement
---
first thing I see @chat: Je lul er in steken?:P haha
---
We need some gentletraction
---
I came across the same thing, wanted a name that used a 1 instead of i, the original name was already in use, but would reject the same name with a number, was trying the name change in game, tried on the actual rs site to change name on account settings and it worked
---
Thank you!
---
never said it was. just wanted to post the image and thought of some stupid sentences
---
I will repeat this again and again, just because you're butthurt and offended it's not going to actually make Jagex do anything.
---
Jagex is not going to change every little thing about the skill because you're easily offended.
---
If you played star dew and didn‚Äôt you
---
You still believe people believe in space?
---
What information can you give away about your character that would make your account unsafe? I mentioned my wood cutting level and total level to a guy while skilling and I'm unsure if anyone could use this knowledge to access my account. I'm only asking this because it seems like everyone's account is being hacked these days.
---
I'm cool with the numbers but you're right it's immersion breaking. I don't think we really need this change anyways, was it polled? Who was desperately trying to figure out how far in the growth process their patches were at?
---
If numbers gotta stay I'd rather it be like "it looks about 1/8th of the way grown" rather than "stage 1/8". No one would say that about plants, it looks bad.
---
Are you kidding the economy is nuts
---
Oh ok.
---
Yeah I agree with this a lot, you never see the dragon square around but it looks sick as fuck.
---
Would be a great low budget DFS.
---
How‚Äôd it go?  Any luck?
---
Wouldn't that make visage price crash?
---
Get a fucking grip of reality. And learn that game companies do not care what you believe religiously or otherwise.
---
If you're offended by Warding then maybe Runescape isn't the game for you. And you should go get offended at some other game.
---
Guess ur right there :p was kinda half baked
---
okay so thats how you get pmod, been wondering
---
Dragon Slayer, Desert Treasure, Monkey Madness, Lost City, Tree Spirit, Fairy Tale pt1/ pt2, Fire Cape, Frem Trials/ Isles and later on things like, Recipe for Disaster, Monkey Madness 2, Dragon Slayer 2
---
Some nice things to do in between might be: Getting a fighter torso, Dragon Defender, Void/Elite Void, Graceful
---
There are a lot of options man!
---
Ann Perkins!
---
He used to be rank 1 after Zezima quit
---
but at what lvl is this recommended
---
Yeah I read that, but I find it to be very vague. Reduced by how much?
---
1v1 me rust if ur that hardcore
---
Kinda like this. I also like the idea of having some sort of op rewards for getting Elise's done. I have all the hards and I dont really see any qol.
---
Good.
---
It‚Äôd be cool if they got buffed to 5 min üôèüèΩ
---
Still no pet
---
It's not worth it because there's the slayer ring teleport straight there and a dueling ring tele to bank and refresh your stats
---

Regarding the new farming update of the reward taking the growth into account. Would that mean, if I have a pre planted magic tree, would I get a shit reward? Or would it be decent since the time it takes to grow one is a while?

You can run back to stack the spawns and cast blood barrage to heal to full or teleport back to house to pool and return to the fight.

Obby set with berserk necklace and obby sword is better than dh until ~91hp iirc. Don't think bludgeon would be faster than obby/dh but I haven't checked

The Fortnight idiots have arrived... Bring them to the wild I say!!!
---
it would require very few rsources, they'll have it all archived.
---
Sure.  You just need to unlock Fairy Rings, get a Crystal Key drop, craft and enchant a ring of wealth, and then kill a couple hundred Goraks until you get the left half of the shield.
---
I'm already in the process of doing all that anyway, since I need to forge a Dragon shield to get the hard Ardy cape so that I can pickpocket Master Farmers enough to get adequate seeds without having to grind Thieving all the way to 99...

Half the player base wouldn't quit that's insane. There would like be a handful of people quitting out of principle. But half is ludacris.
---
if they repolled f2p teleblock, it would still fail. hence they added it in as an unpolled "integrity issue"
---
Toadflax avantoe (possibly cadantine) are good low-risk herbs that will give you a decent profit. Ranarr and snapdragon are better for total profit if you don't mind occasionally losing ~40k when they die, but depending on your farming level there is a best seed (check https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs)
---
Always use ultracompost

Haha, not quite. This is a repaint based on some of the feedback I got

I mean people do it with 1 def.

Interesting. Shows how much people still worry about MTX. Hope they address it
---
Just awful, trust me you do NOT want the bots gone. They've been here since RS Classic in 2001 and are a very important part of the community. Jagex may do a bot bust stream or whatever, but that's just to keep up appearance when in reality even they know RS economy would go to shit if the bots all disappeared.
---
I was getting fed up with the RWT options Jagex put into rs3 for a while. Changing the combat system was only the last push I needed to quit (that, and the release of GW2). It took me until last year before returning and starting osrs again.

Uh they clearly knew what the current rates were for players and was fine with it at the time. Really just seems like a very salty vocal minority spamming the q and a week after week because it treads on their ehp 
---
Oh wow a high click adventurous method that you can't use an auto clicker on which is niether the best agility or thieving xp at once but happens to be the best EHP post 99 and gives shitty rewards. What a travesty. Totally ruined the game with all the people getting levels for free auto clicking all day at underwater agility. They brought mad gp into the game too. What a shame.
---
What is this set on the left?
---
But most of them only require you to start the quest.
---
Three things:

Supply and Demand
---
Flippers
---
Bot Dumps
---
...
---
Guess which one it is.
---
They're reproducing it as best they can. It needed to be built around the b.net framework so that will be different. Theyve also said there will be server layering to help with the large influx of players on launch while not having dead servers later on.
---
There are a few other things, like starting at 1.12, post update AV and I'm pretty sure the dungeon gear update is going to be slightly different in timing than it was for classic.
---
They're doing their absolute best to recreate it as it was, but it's not really feasible to have it literally the exact same as if it was 2004 launch. You won't find them saying it will be EXACTLY the same for those reasons.
---
The entire game would be setback atleast 3 years with the amount of items and gear and gold that is in the game... this isnt an exact number or anything but I would bargain that upwards of 75% of elys, arcanes, spectral are in the game from that mod and other bug abusers finding the corp immunity bug and botting thousands of accounts to farm it 24/7.
---
This suggestion always gets my upvote. If it ends up skyrocketing in value over this, good. The rare drop table is pretty sad otherwise.

So even if I'm not on task I can still make a decent profit off of dust devils?

Yes it was ruining the game. Not for a reddit baby like you, but I dont care about the opinion of a reddit baby because reddit babies dont care about the game at all. They just want FASTER MORE MORE with no regards to the game. Your opinion is irrelephant.

I mean sometimes you get lucky and get 3a on like 20th clue, sometimes people don't get ranger boots til like 1000+ mediums. Clue scrolls are a gamble.

I'm at 70 hunter and all I've done for training is bird houses. It is kind of like mini farming runs but for hunter. Every 50 minutes you can set up 4 bird houses and fill them with seeds, and then collect and refill. They are on fossil island which you need to complete the Bone Voyage quest to access.
---
It is great xp, you will get to the low 60s extremely quick. It is also solid profit from bird nests, great money for the time investment compared to other methods with low level requirements.
---
There are more active ways to train hunter but I don't find them fun. Once you get to level 63 you can hunt red chinchompas for good profit and xp.
---
... That ain't it chief

Come with me to the wildy and i'll show you

Why? Just because it has the word dragon in it?
---
Using this logic, it would make more sense for dragonhide armor to provide resistance because its actually made out of dragon and I doubt dragons can burn themselves.
---
Why is it strange that dragon sq doesnt provide protection, when literally 0 dragon armor provides protection.
---
It wasnt created to fight against dragons, anti-dragon shield was.
---
Really they should just remove all these shitty capes
---
He needs 82 rc, 77 is the level OP was going to boost from

They why even bring up "uh but it has dragon in the name" if it's not true
---
It definitely felt good landing on Tutorial Island after not playing the game for 10 years. However, as you will most likely agree with me, none of us veteran players would have chosen to not get back into the game if tutorial island had disappeared. Spawn in Lumbridge, walk by the river, cows and chickens to Varrock, try not to die at the dark wizards, and suddenly you'll have forgotten all about missing Tutorial Island. 
---
For new players however, an introduction that is a little less linear (such as the gossipping NPC's, an instanced introductory version of Lumbridge) seems fairly good to me. As long as Jagex makes well thought-out decisions and is not afraid of roll back a possible failed project, I don't think it's going to be a dramatic failure. And keep in mind that a large player base equals more people for us to play with, more longevity to the game, higher budgets for the OSRS team - keeping both us and Jagex satisfied. If what it takes is removing Tutorial Island, they've got my vote. Let's keep the options open.

I am now at 3k kills with the pet and 0 mutagens. Really struggling to grind this out.
---
Can you provide any of the proof of this? I'm on this sub all the time and have looked into this a lot, and all of the "proof" has just been people saying it's happening.
---
If there were an actual bug, there would be some videos by now. It's likely that all that's happening is people are failing to compost a spot and then picking fewer than 6 herbs because they didn't notice they didn't compost it.
---
Just get a laptop with a mobile hotspot on your phone
---
Not all hero is wears capes*
---
Just report the lvl 3s and move along...
---
Karma grab
---
I'm pretty sure there is no bug. It's been said that you can get fewer than 6 with attas and bcb, but it's been 4 months without any actual evidence of this provided.
---
People are just missing some patches with their compost and not noticing because it's the BCB and not normal buckets. Then when they harvest they don't get the guaranteed 6.
---
fair enough, thanks for the elaborate response
---
Dont expect a 1/211250 drop rate 3rd age after 15 clue scrolls

Item sprites/icons are actually a top down view of the item on the ground, zoomed appropriately. So probably did it to make the inventory icon look correct or something.

Already exists. Just don't look at the wiki lol
---
The main hunter activity is hunting chinchompas, which are little rodents that become a ranged weapon that deals aoe damage.  You can also hunt herbiboars for herbs and a pet.  Theres a bunch of other stuff to hunt but they aren't very useful.  Early hunter is confusing so look up the training guide on the wiki.  Each training method is a little different, but essentially you set up a trap and wait for the monster to walk into it.  Some are more active than others.
---
Birdhouses are a good way to passively get hunter xp and some gold.

Wouldn't dual whip be kind of op? And would it be another weapon like in rs3? Like off hand scimitar and all that stuff?

Yes. Currently the dragon sq shield is a very good item for early game ironman. It's a great tank shield for things like DKs, barrows etc. This changes it from a good early item to an insane mid game item. Right now as it is so easy to get, I don't think it should be made any better than it already is.
---
Not gunna lie, if you didn't use a resource thats pretty impressive. But I think if you have this encyclopedic knowledge of the game, you're in the .01%, so I still stand by the point that someone who doesn't remember the name of every npc in the game shouldn't be categorized as a noob

He had the word drug in his username that's why I compared it

I'd say yes, because you shouldn't expect to finish it within the first few attempts anyway. This way you'll atleast get some experience and learn how to do most waves. Either you'll get good enough at the end to finish it, or you can just save up for a tbow if you really feel that its necessary. Either way, you'll learn.

It‚Äôs actually BiS for melee roles in nylo room in TOB assuming no ticks lost. This is the case for duos and trios, but the rapier might outclass it in 4-5 mans due to the increased HP of the nylos. Overall not a bad weapon.

Sorry pal, but no weebs allowed in my Christian game

Life would be better if you could see when you gained experience in something.

We need better mage weapons or a better way of using mage spells. Everything that‚Äôs mage is expensive and is a money pit, which is fine in some cases but if there are to be mage bosses there NEEDS to be alternatives.

I got downvoted for this, lmao.

'Ohhcomplex' on SC I spend my weekends rackling lines and banging nines fella. And she's a solid 3
---
I can see the need to make the gmaul worth more, but 1 ticking is one of the highest skill cap techniques in pvp, so taking that out makes PVP boring as shit.
---
Yes and DFS is still better so I don't really see the issue.
---
So I've never really watched DBZ and I've always been told Pokemon didn't count. I guess it's a thing now for...actual story-driven animes?
---
'OhhComplex' on SC I'll show you how fresh this is.
---
/r/uniqueironmen is a great place to find lesser known ones that are still really creative.

Some accounts there have been going for a year+ now.

Thanks for the advice dude, will do.

Glad that we had the identical reactions, simple man

Damn. looks like he got banned already. Don't have one, sorry
---
Totally agree, there shouldnt be a 200gp to 3mil + jump in the next best antifire shield. This would make a perfect medium for those who want a little extra stats at a fair price point
---
You seem pretty versed on this stuff. What's the way to watch it? Crunchyroll? Kind of a dumb question but I guess whatever is "best"
---
I imagine there is, but I'm not sure of it. Best of luck
---
https://youtu.be/qZBOiq3Qnhc
---
The answer to these questions can always be answered by googling "OSRS best in slot" and using the site to enter your stats, then buying the best gear you're able to afford.
---
When I played a child I didn't know weapons had a strength stat
---
1 defence pures tends to have mains. Main accounts can transfer the required gold to just buy these saplings from the GE. Cool technique tho.
---
I just tried to claim and it's not working for me. I did claim the last time this promotion was running, does that make me uneligable or something.
---
The actual armor is not useless, the set effect is pretty worthless tho.
---
Thanks mate, cheers.
---
MMK really was the dad of osrs
---
It only logs you out if you're inactive, I play on mobile only too, AFK isn't the same but it's still doable.
---
1. Set your phone so that your phone doesn't turn the screen off. 
---
2. Set x amount of 4 minute or 4 minute 30 second timers. 
---
3. Walk over to your phone, wiggle the camera or tap one of your skills. 
---
4. Carry on with ya life.
---
psst, you commented twice
---
what a gold message lol.
---
off topic: what happened to alisha?
---
Oh yeah those nylo things have really low hp so it‚Äôs good? Also, is 3 tick the fastest weapon attack speed? I‚Äôm guessing a whip would be 4 ticks or something?
---
Crunchy roll works. If you're wanting mainstream anime, Netflix has most, though not always every season.
---
All of fmab is on Netflix.
---
Honestly I'll watch on random sites
---
Why would you take your cash stack with you?
---
You got what's coming to you.
---
For context, I was part of the previous 07 helpers community before this 'version' of 07 helpers. The clan was doing great while Corey quit the game for 2-3 years, he randomly came back in 2018 and started banning ranked people because he did not know them/didn't like them. All he cared about was the clan name and that he 'owned' the clan, even though he never did anything to create a nice community. In his own words, he said 'people are replaceable'. Long story short, pretty much all members were driven away by corey in 2018 (people who were there for multiple years).
---
Looks like the same thing is happening here, except these people aren't as nice to Corey as the previous people were. Good on them for driving you away
---
Can't say this isn't satisfying to see, such karma
---
You took your cash stack to Wildy? And Jagex should get rid of PVP?  
---
Kinda like saying bars shouldn‚Äôt serve beer cus you got a DUI...
---
Hard or normal doesn't really impact xp/hr, only points gained.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know there was a dragon kite in OSRS lol.
---
If you see the post on the front page of Reddit even with the spoiler tag it's obvious TL won. Posts don't get 20k upvotes when the favourite wins
---
Ya there's a whole list of them that got added on their page
---
To add to this, Jagex isn't going to be given the source code when they buy publicly available bots. They'd have to decompile the script manually and reverse engineer the bytecode directly, which would require a lot of time and expensive staff with application security expertise. It could also easily and immediately be thwarted by bot developers with better obfuscation. Also, the only useful insight you can gain from reverse engineering a script is the statistical variables that control the 'human-like' bot movement. Except bot developers aren't going to hardcode these variables, and it's just more meaningless randomness based on local client seeds.
---
I don't know what Jagex's anti-cheating measures are, but practically speaking it'd be a \*lot\* cheaper and more efficient to build some fancy statistical based kernel that collects and interprets game inputs and deduces patterns across hundreds of accounts automatically. Finding and signaturing these patterns is a lot easier when there's hundreds of accounts copying those patterns, which is why public and 'free' bots have such a high banrate compared to single-user private scripts
---
Gross
---
tekton? Sounds like some rs3 content to me
---
Thanks. I'm aware that most people wouldn't be able to recall most of these as they aren't nearly as prominent/useful as Emily is. I'd imagine most experienced players have interacted with her to buy at least one of the 3 beers she sells.
---
That‚Äôs just a bandaid solution.
---
So are we allowed to bitch about having to pay $11 a month when the next controversy comes up, or is that off the table for the next month.
---
Hey, I'm just starting to get back into this game after playing it throughout my childhood. If anyone wants to be friends or help me get back into the game add me @Zelgon.
---
How much was the cash stack?
---
Am I pregnat?
---
sadly it didn't get frontpage :(
---
Huge plans and goals, combined with low success and minimal content in game. The original developers were really motivated and had plenty of ideas
---
so did I!
---
So funny story, I wore my sacred gnome child shirt to work a couple weeks ago and on of my co-workers literally goes "That's a buttplug." I didn't see it until this silhouette so thanks I guess.
---
It's not probably, you for sure are dirt poor.
---
It has worse stats than a crystal shield, which is arguably much easier to obtain, especially for ironmen. I guess I'm having trouble following how it would make it an insane mid game item by allowing it to be used for dragonfire resistance too, given that it isn't used for much of anything.  
---
I imagine that ironman who grinded for visage would feel cheated, but not even rightfully so because they still have the bis shield.
---
Awesome art as always. This picture just made me realised how much different osrs today to when it launched
---
She got finger blasted at runefest
---
DFS is obtained very late game. Dragon sq shield really isn't. Legend's quest has basically no high requirements for a new ironman, and the left half drop is pretty common - if you want to go out of your way for it it's easily obtainable in a few hours.
---
97% of the games players are pvmers. So we have no need for pkers that just ruins the fun for us majority of the players
---
Darts/blowpipe are 2tick. Whip is 4 tick.
---
Because i forgot to bank it
---
it's not profit if u couldve spent that time better, making more money than what u made and still somehow getting more xp/hr. pamazing right ? sometimes u dont know everything kiddie
---
We‚Äôre is that statistic from?
---
I notice you papi
---
This has to be a troll.
---
77m dude i dont know what to do now. Do u think jagex will refund me my money?
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs exactly as you say. I really just didn‚Äôt feel like explaining in greater detail to people who don‚Äôt understand the fundamentals of programming. 
---
Thanks for the detailed explanation.
---
I think older players tend to just stick to 1 account. I'm maxed pure but no main.
---
Becauseisaidso.org
---
It wasn't about the efficiency back in the days
---
Hell no idiot. You were prime loot.
---
attack and strength level affects chance for bonus poke/shield slam from your defender/shield. At this point I wouldn't care if it did no damage I just want to watch that happen now.
---
I like b0aty's 2013 locked ironman. Where he only does things that are from 2013 (when ironman was released). I hope no one already said that.
---
The random.dat file is my documents, but it was already was on ''read only''
---
Also Ali(Muhammad's cousin) could also be depicted as Zamorak himself, since Zaros was the original leader but Zamorak usurped him and created his own rule, even though Ali never usurped muhammad and became caliph by his own right, most believers in Islam are divided into two denominations likewise, some believe Ali wasn't an authority on islam by most means since he wasn't of direct descent from Muhammad's family.
---
Thats why i choose the Ironman life :D
---
Any items that have been consistent in price for a while, even if it breaks even. I might as well get 80 mage and I don‚Äôt enjoy waiting hours/days to buy items for a profit.
---
name checks out
---
Change the subs name to swampletics
---
Dope:D
---
Honestly mod gee would work as well cause she makes people nut
---
Actually now that I wrote that I guess it should be me who wrote it, cause I'm fucking nuts
---
I'm just imaging this change going through and seeing someone with 4 hammers cause of this bad idea
---
1000% yes.
---
The Cape would be worth more if it was tradable because it would be less hassle.  Not less.
---
It‚Äôs a 1/300 drop lol. You‚Äôre under drop rate by 100
---
But that shit underwater like a treasure chest tbh
---
It'll be a fun journey. I just prepped for konar with 3k points and would get hydra like every 4th tsk, so I got real lucky. Best of luck to you!
---
Depends on your Agility level and how good you are but it caps out at 73k xp/hr.
---
&gt; It's a "very rare drop" from nearly every relevant monster in the game. You'll almost certainly get it as a passive drop.
---
Ya, once you hit like 70 slayer lol. The ‚Äúrelevant monsters‚Äù take a while to reach if you‚Äôre leveling up your account in a normal way.
---
Regardless; anti dragon shield costs almost nothing to replace and require maybe 15 hours of in game time to acquire. Dragon square probably takes closer to 200 in game hours to acquire. And this wouldn‚Äôt even make it a BIS item at anything. DFS is probably closer to 1000 hours to acquire on average if you grind for it.
---
This change would would give a relevant mid level purpose to an item that has virtually no use when factoring its various costs.
---
Vote no 3 times, rc update gets shelved, warding pushed through as a integrity change
---
The sword should‚Äôve been a nerfed CLS now it‚Äôs just a better rapier with a cost. Pots should‚Äôve been polled untradeable..
---
Maybe you should be rewarded for it if you can think of it
---
Adrenaline is quite the painkiller. Probably didn't feel much at all for a few hours tbh.
---
source: cut the shit out of a finger before. Felt fine enough to go back only to cut a second finger. Not my brightest of days.
---
That's sterotyping and racist. Myself, I am a follower of Islam and can say with 100% certainty, that this is incorrect lol.
---
I hope you're not only an osrs player, because the quest lines on RS3 go way beyond Zamorak and Zaros. Your statement is completely rigid and stale as you are taking your information from only one place.
---
As for Saradomin following Christianity, what's your supporting evidence there?
---
FYI, they wear burqas and turbans to stop the sun from hitting their head and to keep them cool lmfao.
---
So yes, you really do need to dig more. "It's pretty out there" no bud, that's assumption.
---
If one shows assumption, it also shows ignorance and arrogance.
---
So who‚Äôs replacing him? Hopefully someone who‚Äôs ambitious with reworking the bot detecting  methods
---
I have 1.4k kc 1 zenyte...

Idk Corey, you sound like a shitty guy from his blog post.

20,000 accounts banned ever day is accurate, these numbers are found through Jagex's website. 50 people making the 20,000 accounts go off general knowledge of the botting community. I personally know of 15 people who run about 500 accounts per day through suicide botting, and I know for a fact there are larger ones.
---
I regularly post about botting on this sub, and try to explain and help people understand stuff in this area. I also run bots myself, and code them for players, and discuss this openly.
---
But hey, discount my knowledge and expertise in the area, I don't know anything. =)

I farmed goraks until I got the shield, specifically for the ardy diary.
---
They worship Zaros in the bandit camp, and there are numerous other worshipping NPC characters in the desert, the bandits attack you because they worship zaros and see zamorak as a traitor and saradomin etc. as fake deities.
---
It's a cock ring
---
If Swampletics had a slayer xp tome for every time this was reposted he'd have an abyssal weeks 3 weeks ago.
---
Self deprecating humor is not exclusive to "nerdy" kids. Its actually considered very effective for public speaking as well bc often you can make people laugh/smile while also guaranteeing not to offend anyone.
---
Haven't played the game since 2008 and I'm working on my main account right now. I was hoping I could get some advice on what would be best to focus on right now. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed on what to work on. I know there's not a "right" way to move forward but any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Barrows gloves should definitely be your next big major overall goal. I'd look up the list of quests required for those and start there, and/or knock one the ones that reward a good number of quest points without being super long
---
I don't have the extra block spot, so I've been doing abyssal demons with expeditious, since I can get 60k+/hr from them. I've also been doing steel drags, since they only take about 10 minutes with toxic trident/ancestral. I also do ankous with expeditious since they only take like 5 to 10 minutes to barrage. I do theses extra tasks just to ensure I always have enough points to skip everything else. Do you think it would be possible to block abyssal demons, which would open up another 8 weight task that I don't want to do, but still maintain enough points for skips? I'm aware that just doing the elite diary would be better but I don't want to, and am just focused on finishing 99 slayer at the moment.
---
Bank standing for 5 minutes before saying fuck it and going for a slayer task... lol

I'm not sure if this is a bait thread. Did you seriously compare warding with f2p tb?

I am so sorry

idk you could just be having a rash of bad rng? I always heard people talk about averaging 80-100k on hard contracts but i swear I average 13k, with a palm drop like every five contracts so tbh I bet you're still better off than me.
---
Cowkiller1337 from ghosts ahoy cutscene
---
Actually, you attach the visage to an item that already provides the anti dragon fire effect. The visage does not add this effect, or make it stronger (you still need antifire pots for full protection).
---
Wheres its eyes
---
Yeah true this thread sadly are targetting the wrong botters who barely make a profit. While those running private clients are running months without ever being banned. They have an automated system that makes normalised accounts with a good total level and then a money making skill such as hunter with 50m exp before getting banned..
---
That's all settled's humor is.
---
Self deprecating humor is fine in public speaking because that isn't how you're going to be acting the entire time.
---
 Settled is literally just a little ball of being a bitch, no one confident does what he does.
---
As someone who had a job with coding after like 3 team changes, I get it. The OG might do one thing one way, then the next guy, etc. til it falls on you and it's code soup that makes no goddamn sense.
---
I don't understand why you're arguing against making dead content not dead. If I wanna go kill some green dragons I'd rather have the defensive properties of my dragon sq than a simple fire shield, especially considering all the effort that went into place to get it on my ironman.
---
Even trolls should be given a chance to explain themselves.
---
What are you on about mate
---
fully agree. when i finished legends quest, I did not feel like a legend. i felt like I had access to a cape that was cost efficient and the quests and that's it.
---
Right, my bad
---
Aaaaand now they're never going back down to 12k.
---
stop spamming your shit videos
---
I got a free few spins for the twitch free month of membership. Decided "i never play rs3 but fuck it lets see what this wheel thing has." I won a fucking sara god sword. I didn't even have 40 attack. It was pretty much a brand new account.
---
They‚Äôre such a good money maker. Got a black demon task and did mm2 right after so I could kill them. Made 4.9m in 168kc. Probably about 4.75m in profit.
---
Try using a cheaper spell like iban‚Äôs blast  or slayer dart. You can also use the trident if you can afford it. Using range i would reccomend magic shortbow imbued  with rune arrows, the dps on that is pretty good.

Yes it is. You don't need to watch other animes.

---
If the documentary is to be believed it was pure luck someone found a backup tape
---
Ok. What does the trident do?
---
Because 60 smithing is insanely low compared to the 88 smithing that I'd expect any ironman to realistically get.
---
Yes, because item stats can't be changed to balance items. You are so stuck that you can't see beyond your fat ass gut while you play osrs. 
---
Any mmorpg does class changes, item changes, balance changes. Damage ouput by sacrificing defense ain't new buddy. 
---
But you do you, I've been on RS since 2006. I've been on WOW since Cata. I've seen more balance and changes that I could hope for, yet a lot of them were needed and very welcome. 
---
But it's ok, it's ok to be so fat and stupid to the point you can't even reach your dick amidst all that fat while you play osrs on your mom's basement. There's no shame in being fat, but there's a shame to see someone this fucking stupid. 
---
It's a game, it's a program, devs change whatever the fuck they want as long as people want change.
---
It only seems like it has a delay because it‚Äôs an item with charges, so if you select it before the tick happens, it doesn‚Äôt do anything.  If you use the pots on the watering can instead, the delay is significantly less noticeable

All I wanted wheb i suggested it was for it to be a cosmetic that had the ability to teleport you to the ham dungeon of you wore the full set. Not for a new bis raids item....

My buddy recently transferred his old RS3 gold to oldschool. Used a shady site we were sure we would get scammed on. But made 1m OS per 8m RS3. We had around 100m total between us so a free 10m was welcome

I recognize your IGN in ToB dude, and I just got hacked too today/yesterday.

- Yesterday when I logged in with my usual credentials, it said "Account locked as we suspect it has been stolen."
---
- I changed my password and logged in fine, logged my bank pin and everything was still in place.
---
- Today I tried logging in with the new password, and it said "Invalid credentials."
---
- Had to reset password again (took a while but finally did it), my private setting has been changed to OFF, logged my usual bank pin, but it's an error this time...
---
- Checked my authenticator immediately after and found out it has been disabled...

Anything that involves theorycrafting a way to achieve a particular goal. I used to be able to get that high from main accounts but now here I am watching "2 squares north west of lumby church mage only ultimate ironmen"

I have a confession to make. I maxed on RS3. I‚Äôm over 2000 total on my osrs main. I have multiple pking accounts with several 99s. 
---
I have never done legends quest past the point required for barrows gloves.
---
You're really upset from some reason, I was outwardly going for a shitty shield that has no purpose, just stating it took me a crazy long time to get an item despite a lot of RDT drops.
---
bad bot

I only watch swampy boi

Got my gold back, doubled 100 coins to 200. He asked if I needed it doubled to 400. I was like nah bro I can get my pickaxes now.

I have a master and elite in bank, both which require me a few more runecrafting levels. So I‚Äôve put it off for a while....
---
I could've, just didn't see the point in switching out my ring for a shield I didn't need, knew it would come eventually, just took a really long time compared to friends who never wore a ROW and had it done by 90 combat.
---
Bruh, thanks. Completly forgot tbh. That‚Äôs why I made this post!
---
Lmaooo I can promise you, almost guarantee that I‚Äôm in much better shape than your wow playing nerd ass. So please share your stats retard? Let‚Äôs completely change the whole game, force people to duel wield weapons in the wildy in order to compete. I can promise you one thing, this idea would never pass, the j mods are t fucking retarded, and wouldn‚Äôt even consider it fucking nerd. Your a legit joke, and a legit fucking retard. Fucking wow nerd, go back to that, because your a absolute dumb fuck. Not a single person is going to agree with this SHIT idea, because not one person on this sub is as completely brain dead and retarded as yourself. Dumb fuck

100% sourceless. Top content.

This is what you deserve for trying to take something that wasn't yours to begin with.
---
Next time don't take peoples work and claim it as your own. I have screenshots show that you came to me for every website thing that you needed and after I did the website, and forums you tried to take them and claim them as yours so that you could use them as a portfolio piece for your schooling. I have lots more where those came from. Although, I don't agree with them calling your work, and making threats, this is something you 100% deserved and not a single person thinks otherwise.
---
No one is doing any sort of scamming. You have literal bots sitting at hot spots throughout the game (which, we have been using as free advertising, thank you.) spamming that we are scammers and that we are offering free bonds to whoever joins the channel and spams us. We have also been reporting those to our resident player moderator who has been muting them as they appear.
---
You do realize that botting, even just auto typing using Garyshood (which I know you use) is a banable offence?.. So when you have burner accounts setup in places to spam using those types of bots you actually could be banned for doing so..
---
You have a problem. Your problem is that you make up lies and then fully believe your own lies.
---
At least on mobile, they take a little  ut longer to load. A direct image link is better because it loads faster and I can zoom in on my phone quicker
---
The trident is a magic weapon with an in built spell that does damage based on your magic level. It requires 75 magic to use and uses 1 chaos 1 death and 5 fire runes per cast i believe. Although it does less damage than ibans blast it‚Äôs more dps as the trident attacks faster and is more accurate. If you want to save on money go for the trident of the seas, the non upgraded version. If you are willing to spend more, the trident pf the swamp is an option but the cost per cast is higher, requiring zulrah scales
---
At least in it, he admits that I created everything. I don't have any reasoning to share our personal DMs, but none of his claims are substantiated.

You'll never really take eternals into chambers, dont sell bgs because you'll need that at the very least if youre not bringing dwh. But if you do get dwh then by all means do what you want. Yeah you can easily learn raids without rigour. I didnt buy rigour till i was over 100kc and had alot of splits. Yes youll need bp and xbow. Xbow is only for olm head/shamans. Xbox can be used at mystics for longer range but generally bp is best for points in that room.

You are kinda fuck if you cant pay ur first membership. Options could be:

Aren‚Äôt they on the same drop table?

Mahog tables are 6 though

5m/raid. You also have to have proof you can afford a split.

From what i can tell, making weapon types good for certain niches is really all this is about. i don't think anyone wants to take away the scimitar meta, just make other weapons good for some niche
---
Couple of real bad ideas on here I really am not digging.
---
As it stands right now most people can't even properly 1-tick double spec the gmaul, especially with all of the options available to pkers that they don't take full advantage of; freeze spells, movement, eating to full, etc.
---
Nerfing to 60 by default is just another superfluous "fix" like they did to anglerfish to appease people who PK with a single meta. It's sad.
---
Secondly, say NO to 60% blocking with protection prayers.
---
Jagex is putting far too many asterisks where they don't have to. I do not like the direction this is going. Could they not instead bump the granite maul to a "very rare" drop from gargoyles and grotesque guardians.
---
My prayer is 55 ish. And I usually use 4 pots. What am I doing wrong
---
What's the daily routine for Managing Miscellania? And what do I allocate my workers to?
---
Sounds really dumb, sorry. Pures shouldn't just get a shitload of tools to shit on low level noobs in wildy, it makes the game more frustrating. Go fight someone who wants to fight you.
---
Why be defensive? He's obviously dirt poor he just started.
---
That‚Äôs fine. 
---
My bank value is 1.3B - but I‚Äôm not an iron man.

Just do demonics smh
---
That game doesn't have Hatius, though. Kind of a deal breaker for me.
---
When you hit the mega rare table, theres a 1/10 chance of getting a 3rd age piece, and a 9/10 chance of getting junk
---
Got about 70m spare rn, any ideas on what to use it on?
---
I have a few BIS (bandos, sgs, dwh, tentacle, zenytes, kodai, rangers)
---
I was considering avernic or armas, or perhaps rigour (definitely better than armas now that I consider it). I'm of the impression ferocious gloves are not very worth it because you rarely use melee only and are also not slaying (hence not using bracelets)
---
Or perhaps grind out a skill? Does crafting have the best perk (or perhaps construction but I don't think I have enough for that)
---
Is that not literally the first thing anyone notices?
---
Hate to suggest it but look up a YouTube narrows guide

Just do firecapes for people.  There still scrubs out there that pay for a firecape of all things

Very rare
---
Once I unlocked gargoyles, I just afked there with full guthans for a few days, not doing anything else. Made a bond and a bit, while barely doing anything, so I'd say it's worth it.
---
It will definitely be the end of this game when he goes
---
Hell yeah! Friendly chickens are the best
---
U edited this lol
---
Pretty much yeah. Content creation in general excels when you're showing people something they haven't seen before and I think the /r/uniqueironmen trend only serves to prove that.
---
Even PvP content creators are constantly coming up with new builds, gear setups, and premises because nobody wants to watch "normal" pvp videos.
---
Recipe for disaster?
---
Instead of nerfing the gmaul, make g guardians and gargoyles drop the maul VERY RARE instead of RARE 1/256, which sounds too generous anyway.
---
I used to camp wyverns/gargoyles pretty often got 711k from wyverns in 20 minutes once
---
Wondering the same things myself. The RS market is confusing sometimes.
---
yeah everyone gets super mad and against f2p changes before they exist but once they are in place no one cares lmao

Not sure if this is the meta but usually I have planted the following: maple, papaya, cheap high level herb, 1 watermelon and 1 snapegrass, whiteberry, potato cactus, white lily.

I skip yews and magics unless I can do it overnight. Same for fruit trees.

It was an accident

I think they're literally just talking about your voice

I didn't really notice much if anything.
---
Fire giants are also very good for dragon spears or left halfs with the ring of wealth equipped for those who need the drop.
---
we.. did it.. reddit? ü¶Ä?
---
Great! Thanks
---
Lmao was that a 99?
---
We all saw you look back an forth and unzip after typing that
---
PC is dead?
---
Pretty expensive to use all those pages and not deal extra damage tho, what would you need the inv space for?
---
Certainly not
---
No? That‚Äôs not how RNG works. You‚Äôre not guaranteed a unique drop in 512 kills. I‚Äôm simply implying that it‚Äôs not a 1/216k drop. I‚Äôm saying that each roll is separate just because they‚Äôre the same drop doesn‚Äôt mean the rate is multiplied into itself.
---
Shoot I didn't even try that. Nice. That works as an alternative to either granite piece then.
---

Def a block tho. Even after mm2
---
The pages aren't consumed while using non-combat spells like alchs and teleports. But the inventory space is important, it's just to save a little money not needing to use fire runes.
---
Are you trolling?
---
Quote when I said "guaranteed". Hint: "to be expected" and "guaranteed" mean different thinks.

The post is about two 1/512 drops at once. The odds of this happening are 1/262,144. If you can't understand that I can't help you, it's such a trivial concept there isn't much explaining to be done lol.
---
No, do you not use pages when splashing fire strike?
---
If you have a runelite account it will save things across multiple sessions
---
Wow yeah I like this more than having a boss and it‚Äôs probably easier on dev time
---
+80 ranged defence. For comparison, ely has +57 (but ely is better cause of the damage reduction)
---
Whats the problem, splashing with fire wave is like 50k/h at like 6gp/exp.
---
If you are doing raids on your main you can just splash on the pure and get 99 mage while making loads on the main. 
---
Imo splashing is still the best method to train mage(If you don't autoclick).
---
I splashed like 140m mage exp.(Spread over 18 builds)
---
But hes not splashing fire strike
---

I just tried to log back in to my middle school account that had negative membership because I used to pay by calling that phone line that added it to your phone bill.

I am at 81 att, 89 star, 80 def, 84 range. Was decent, if you didn‚Äôt struggle with the ones from the quest and you know the mechanics it should be fine. Maybe a little slower, but i feel like you‚Äôre strong enough. But that defense is gonna hurt when you make a mistake. And trust me, you‚Äôll make mistakes at first.

By 100 kc I had a rhythm down and was able to take much less food, but at first those 27-30‚Äôs are gonna hurt.

I would suggest taking pre-made bird houses with you.  I have 20 clockworks, so I can make a full inventory whenever I run out of bird houses.  Making them all at once rather than 1 at a time during the run or 4 at a time is so much nicer.  If you take the bird houses with you the run is faster and there are fewer clicks.
---
I'm not interested, and it's not. Ham joints max is 28, rapier max is like 54? Been a while since I've checked. Rapier is more accurate. 1 tick difference does not make up nearly double the damage. Whatever calculator you are using is broken.

There are but as far as I‚Äôm aware, only by invite. I was once lucky enough to be invited there for a tour + playtesting when it was Reach, Ash, John C and Mat K.
---
Kinda recently there was a survey put out via message centre looking for playtesters for something I think? That‚Äôs probably the best chance of getting invited to their office.
---
Either way I don‚Äôt think they just do random tours. There‚Äôs always some purpose like getting feedback, playtesting or something.

Attas helps. I get an average of 10 with the farm cape and secateurs and attas. Around 9 without attas I think.

Having a main and an iron alt is pretty common for those who have irons, but other than that I can see your point.

At what point is he "whinging" (???) ?

The arma is for zulrah. Since I have the bow now I can hunt for mutagen and pet with less cost than using trident/BP over time. Also cause IDM void raiding haha
---
How good is the void knight mage set?
---
I keep hearing that the set is not very useful, but on the wiki it says that it has 45% accuracy bonus which seems like a lot. None of the other sets have any damage bonus (except ancestral which I am never getting) so unless I am using slayer helm this should really good right?
---
So how does it compare to the other sets?
---
Love the series idea! Good to see you keeping it up!

As a mod item added to the shield, sure. Especially if it involves a new quest wink wink.

Easiest by far is 4th column, here‚Äôs the strat:
---
- Get as many unsired in your inventory as possible before event starts, even if you have 10 each it pretty much guarantees you two of the squares, whip and bludgeon piece
---
- Cannon goblins for an extremely quick champ scroll, shouldn‚Äôt take more than 5 hours for 2 people using cannon and blowpipe
---
- One person goes Vork, other goes Grotesque Guardians. As soon as one gets the 1/1k drop they can go over the other boss. Should be done in less than 24 hours. 
---
Using this strat you can easily finish this column the first day of the event.
---
I want this more than I‚Äôve wanted anything else in my life
---
Yeah that's true. Some people only have experience doing hard rumbles for imbues though, you can't blame them for not knowing the full 15 minute AFK method

I didn't think it was possible to get your character to look like a emotional teenager

Don‚Äôt have time for idiot kids
---
Don't think I've ever seen such bad advice.

I HIGHLY suggest just doing achievement diaries. They'll give you good attainable objectives that familiarize you with the areas and teach you about the game. They also usually have good rewards.
---
But you are the idiot kid?
---
If you watch the vid of the massacre, it‚Äôs the guy S Y N I  who made the vid he‚Äôs a pure wearing ghost top and black d hide legs with Msb lol
---
Rigour is a very powerful upgrade from Eagle Eye.
---
It's also still expensive because people are doing less CoX and more ToB, so the supply of those rewards is lower than it otherwise would be.
---
I'd say if your bank value is at least 300m, Rigour is worth the investment.

Hello, played RS intermittently from 2004-2013
---
Briefly played a bit of RS3 recently on my almost maxed account
---
Considering starting OSRS and building a pure/pking account, it would be my only account
---
Can I ask what are kind of the best builds in pvp?
---
I am considering the following builds
---
60 attack zerker
---
75 attack zerker
---
60 attack/99 str/70 def piety build
---
75 attack/99 str/70 def piety build
---
A range tank is also an option, as it would be very good for pvm as well I hear, but I just think only being limited to range as a style can get quite boring
---
Open to any ideas/options but not considering any pures below 40 def
---
No that‚Äôs definitely you lmao. You just argued with me that it‚Äôs not better DPS than gave up your retarded argument with the good ole classic ‚ÄúoH hE dOeSn‚ÄôT cArE aBoUt DpS‚Äù lmfao.
---
If you would have just said that from the beginning I would‚Äôve said ‚Äúfair play then, that‚Äôs his choice‚Äù. But you sat here and tried to lie to me and everyone like Ancestral or any mage gear isn‚Äôt better DPS? Gtfo here dude lol you just made yourself look stupid. Like I said I‚Äôm done now bud.
---
I meleed like 3k skeletal wyverns and 2k fossil island wyverns, mostly off task! Great prayer exp, gp and loads of snap and ranarr seeds :)

It's worth it to sell and later buy back prospector pieces just to get the upper level ASAP at 72

I really liked the new NPC models especially Crwys
---
I second this. I‚Äôve been putting off 92-99 smithing until this update comes. Lets just say ive been waiting since fletching and cooking got that update.
---
The problem is the dragon square shield is tankier than the dragonfire shield in terms of defensive bonuses. It would tank the value of all dragonfire shields in game if it could also deter incoming damage from dragonfire. An interesting way it could be given dragonfire 'immunity' could be that it slowly heats up and begins to damage players. Even if it's like 1s and 2s every few seconds, it would deter long usage due to consuming a player's foodsource. Perhaps even a cooldown to even wield it after x amount of dragonfire has been absorbed as well. Just slapping a lower % of damage blocked from dragonfire won't work though.
---
It means ‚Äúefficient hours played‚Äù.

I actually love the uniquenesses of each style, and I respect the fact that Ranged's strength is DPS, but it feels more and more like it can just be used in place of, like, anything else.  Particularly since you can still use mage spells for utility while just ranging casually.
---
I'd like pure offensive magic to be more viable, but maybe that's asking too much.

keep in mind that fma:b assumes you've seen fma.  it starts off with a lot of missing information that is otherwise covered in the very first few eps of the original fma.
---
Don't think I've ever seen such a useless comment. Care to elaborate? Most slayer tasks won't need any protective gear, meaning the black mask will work perfectly fine for the damage boost. And being able to make rings will provide convenient teleports around.

&gt; But with 99 defense, piety and 99 magic...effective magic defense level is only: 156 x .3= 46  99+8=107 x .7=74+46= 120 
---
I'm pretty sure that even if augury is used instead of piety it still won't give you 156 effective magic defense, just because you can't boost magic as high with potions. Imbued heart might change that, idk.

&gt;Provided that your Strength level is 99, drinking a divine super combat  potion will boost that level to 118. The renew effect will ensure that  it won‚Äôt drop below 118 for 5 minutes. If, however, the stat is reduced  by either an NPC, spell, or a potion such as a Saradomin brew, the  effect won‚Äôt renew the stat back to 118, and will instead begin renewing  the stat at the level it‚Äôs been lowered to.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If a Saradomin brew reduced the strength level from 118 to 105. The  renewal effect will now begin renewing to level 105 but won‚Äôt renew  higher than that unless drinking another strength stat boosting potion.

&gt;Drinking a restore or Sanfew serum potion will not boost the stat any  higher after it has been reduced. However, it is possible to maintain  the renewal effect by drinking another potion that boosts the stat, and  if this happens the renewal timer will continue and expire after the 5  minutes. This will not extend the original timer.

what the fuck man
---
Is this pvp update confirmed?
---
What's that guy doing upstairs the shield store?
---
I love the zoom in. Nice vid, dude.

You clicked the fuck out of that pile
---
&gt;Look, lomeone elses picture slopily stretched across my home screen!
---
-OP
---
Nice karma farming. Looks terrible all stretched out, too.
---
lmfao rank 1281 in construction... smh
---
But those are from other players who did have to pay real money.
---
Why is that the best? Optimal is in any of the corners so that you get hit by the least amount of mobs at once
---
If you set the alch value to 500k, people will just alch it and thus bring even more gold in. The GP coming in from alchables is already ridiculous.
---
Yeah but it takes so long to get that many nuggets. It wouldn't effect the price of d picks. I've only gotten 1200 nuggets from ~50-90 (plus outfit, upper lvl, coal/gem bag and bigger pouch). I guess 1500 may be a little low, but if you do like 60-99 at mlm, the nuggets gained from that getting you a d pick wouldn't really be OP
---
Check out the fishing guild. It‚Äôs near Camelot. 
---
Or, try catherbry. I probably spelled that wrong but lots of people there you can strike up a convo with. I don‚Äôt do much WC but the WC guild is actually really nice and populated. 
---
For thieving, join ‚Äúthirvinghost‚Äù and hit east Ardy bank. 
---
For firemaking, WT is the best xp and on dedicated worlds, is always full. 
---
Crafting, you can make gold bracelets in edgeville, the furnace is right by the bank and decently populated. 
---
Cooking, go down to the rogues den. Bank is literally one space from the fire. Lots of company. 
---
Anyways those are all the ones I can think off the top of my head.  You can always do bank standing skills like fletching at the GE or castle wars bank. Hope that helps. All those locations have tons of players totally up to talk
---
Already know OP has a green stack of gmauls.
---
Pking
---
I‚Äôm a gym junkie, guess it was probably funnier to me than I thought it would be to others. Makes sense if you see how big of a youtuber he is, and it‚Äôs all about fitness. Video starts with a motivational intro and ends up being about osrs instead of bodybuilding
---
I wish. I got cleaned at the arena a couple days ago. Bank down to ~200m from 2b. I could still make a few hundred mil if I invested in Gmauls though.
---
JMods with class, makes the game so much more.
---
I have honestly only met 2 or 3 people who have used it to gain an advantage. It's meant for brand new players, even so it's much cheaper online then through runescape. The people who are buying gold are not doing it through jagex
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter, as long as I had fun making it :)
---
The OSRS team has done an outstanding job of bringing gold sinks into the game. The staking tax has taken out hundreds of bils, far more than an item‚Äôs price re-work would bring in. Also this post was satirical and you took it too seriously. It‚Äôs clearly a joke lol
---
You sound like the biggest pussy ever. The reason they ignored poll results is because pvmers like you kept spite voting it. It would‚Äôve been polled in favor if not for you retard pvmers that think hopping worlds to a f2p world while doing a clue scroll is acceptable. Use your brain you dumb monkey.
---
30-40m (non iron that is)
---
I guess? Not sure why everyone took my comments so negatively. It‚Äôs fine for every generation to have different ways of enjoying games.
---
Damn that kinda sucks. Also if you make gmauls 500k alch value every fucker at gargoyles is gonna make 7m/hr or some big number like that
---
Bit mental that they‚Äôve just thrown in the spec proposal yesterday for the sword and immediately polled it. If it was there since the blog was originally live we could have given more info to slightly change it
---
The person on top was an og osrs streamer
---
I have don't 600kc and got like the spring and the light frame b2b like wtf do you know how much shards I could get? I am so mad
---
The rings in RS3 are actually really tiny.
---
Good. The OSRS economy needs a little bit of instability. Chaos if you will. I‚Äôm a devout follower of Zamorak and when things go too peacefully or too nicely I get this itch to want to bring a little chaos to the world.
---
This is EXACTLY rs3.
---
This doesnt work for me, but i heard it depends on your model of keyboard. Tried mohog benchs for a bit but decided on teaks because i could just tape down my 1 key and just use my mouse
---
Neat.
---
most of the people working on path of exile
---
Just-a-car, if you're Mammal
---
It won‚Äôt become dead content. Please use your brain for once
---
I think I‚Äôd vote to yes to this. But thanks to darts, smithing would just be cooking 2.0 In terms of training it
---
If you open up the minigames tab, there is a clan chat you can join for people who need to find a partner for the quest.
---
You're actually the first one to think of this. I promise!
---
Lmao 2k total is basically nothing?  Go outside
---
I just don‚Äôt know why they wouldn‚Äôt do something like this if we are already doing it with the surp helm
---
That was probably intense and you sir must have lots of patience
---
Wow
---
Thats not really precision or skill based though and its abuse or circumventing what is supposed to happen in game
---
