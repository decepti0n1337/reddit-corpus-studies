While nothing has been confirmed yet, there were talks of scaling the difficulty down for the twisted leagues. Not to mention the other higher tier relics will have some choices for helping you reach those lofty goals. I'd wait until tomorrow to see the full reveal of everything before jumping to any major conclusions.

better be

Definitely sounds like an oversight. Make sure to report it in game as well.

Got barrows gloves for the first time on my ironman at 86 cb a couple of weeks ago, is this normal or low level?
---
Thanks.

Gl,KING

Imagine going on the internet and asking wht's wrong with your math, getting legit answers and assuming everyone else is wrong lol
---
youll never be a real disney princess lmao
---
You also have services in the US like 'Privacy' where you can create multiple CC's on a whim.
---
Theres an 'optimal quest order' page on the official wiki that lists them in an order that reduces the amount of training you need to do to get requirements for the next quest. That's a great place to start an iron man because you unlock areas and items as you go and gives you a good goal. Once you've finished a lot of the quests you'll have nice stats and can chase gear upgrades and start killing bosses
---
Dragon sword, dragon hasta, dragon warhammer, and sarachnis cudgel are available between rune scim and whip.
---
Didn’t it use to say “leave it alone” or something like that? Why did they change it?
---
Thanks for the clarification. I forgot they would be adding the rewards from each league to the new leagues shop.
---
There's also dragon sword from wyrms and sarachnis cudgel (though you prolly don't want to grind that many sarachnis with a rune scimmy). But yeah, other than those you'd be using a rune scimmy until you can get a whip.
---
Total level "Yes" 
---

---
laughed to hard.
---
If you have a fucking job 100m in bonds is chump change.  Sometimes... it's about loving grind though.
---
Rip, gloves are the hardest to get..
---
Depends on how much they've had to invest into creating a league system and designing future leagues. If they're not in deep, they're just going to cancel over poor turnout.
---
Nah that’s only 65 RC.
---
I spent too much time making this

Why would you trade 90 mill for 90 mill anyways?

Hes unlucky but he made a lot of really bad decisions to end up that deep in debt. As you said he would statistically break even with no tax

Tbh this isn't even surprising.  I don't deal with account stuff often at all but from what I can tell, at least some of the shit that flies around is just a total meme.  When I returned to the game a couple years ago my old "real main" was perm banned for macroing like 5 years prior, right in the middle of the decade I didn't play the game, and I didn't really care so I just used my other account and that's my OSRS main now.  But recently after all the discussion about how awful Jagex is with bans, I tossed in an appeal for it on the website just to see what happens.  About 3 or 4 days later I got this exact same response about how they saw there was unusual activity on the account at that time and unbanned me.  For an offense from like 2012.

&gt;more loans
---
This is basically a ponzi scheme without the paying back extra.

Tf you laughing? go and get them!

skiller 1998 total kid with no Bh kills and no LMS score telling it how it really is in the PK scene and why we should vote no. 
---
In all seriousness, it’s definitely great that people like this will soon be unable to vote on PVP polls. If you don’t even participate in PVP in any way and the only thing you know about PVP clans or pking in general is memes on reddit how could you possibly form an intelligent unbiased opinion on the matter?

Fucking rowdy

---
makes sense. Revs is still a huge source of gp I suppose.
---
I wouldn’t even go for base 50’s I would just say start questing.
---
Alright man I’m gonna have to look into a guide!
---
Not really Jagex problem worse that can happen is they get some bad press if someone is dumb enough to die nolifing (has happen in the past with other games). Runescape has always been about addiction since more time playing = more xp/gp and higher ranks. Only a very small amount of people would take it to the extreme and it is on the individual overall, so yeah I agree nothing Jagex really can do about it unless they literally sat hard limits to how many hours you could log onto your account per day which would irate people even if the threshold was like 14 hours a day lol
---
you have parkinsons?
---
What's happening? It sounds intense.
---
What a cute noob doing dust devils one at a time
---
Lmao man it really is. I started this journey at 96 slayer, like 96/97 range, and I'm now at 14.2m slayer exp, and 26m range exp :D. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
GOD it feels so good. I was only farming it for money too lmao. Then I just got so fucking dry it pissed me off, I was motivated to see it through haha. God damn it feels so good man. Biggest drop ever for me! Now I really should try raids or something now that my banks sitting a bit better (was rebuilding, lost 3.5b staking l0l so been rebuild for a while..)
---
You right.
---
I still have no idea what you mean by "scale the point each league based on how many people completed each task" and "independent of previous iterations". Those two things contradict by the way I am reading it. If you mean what I assume you mean my point was that a single task can be much easier or harder depending on the rules and relics of the specific league.
---
Gotta feel bad for Jagex. When they’re doing their job right, and banning rule breakers, they get flamed for not giving people a second chance.
---
This but actually.
---
This needs to be a SpongeBob  meme from the hooks episode.

How is the "Equip a Kodai Wand" going to work without access to MTA and Master Wand? Have I missed something?

 [https://imgur.com/a/XmUwLKr](https://imgur.com/a/XmUwLKr)  This was the gear and invy I used for it, I am 88 def and 91 range.
---
I luckily had a main that I could practice the fight on. I made sure I did galvek successfully 3 times before doing it on this acc. Funny enough my closest chance at death was when doing the rune dragon. The galvek fight isn't too bad.
---
Gz mate!
---
Tiaras can be made without rune mysteries. A f2p meta for rcing is to use the air talisman from staring the quest for tiaras. It can be achieved and obtained without starting the quest using other methods. You also have lamping technically.
---
wasn't that bad, just as i'm sure you did with zulrah, you gotta learn the mechanics, and what to watch out for. On my main i probably died at least 3-4 times before being successful.
---
Gotta save that magic xp for nechs if he wants an untrimmed slayer cape.
---
Oh yes the max cash days...
---
Nice! Thanks for sharing! I got into osrs fairly recently and only enjoy hardcore so it's been a struggle to get the energy to have a normal account. A few more deaths will probably force me to get a normal account lol
---
It made me feel rich. Took screenshots of my bank full of phats, christmas crackers, h'ween masks and pretty much all the expensive stuff. It was a giveaway standing at the bank with no one around. It was a way for me to try out items before buying them to see if I actually wanted them. Never did much more though.
---
Well they do listen to feed back.  A lot.  More than other game companies out there.  Blizzard has been under fire lately. Though,  not everything is voted on and they just kind of make a decision on their own here and there.
---
Hes a staking addict streamer who asks for donations and loans to help him stake.

I saw this guy the other day. I knew it was likely a scam to do exactly what they did to you. Gave them a report but I guess it didn’t get through in time to save you or more than one acc is doing this.
---
Someone should start a petition for Jagex to get a support team, like even blizzard has a better support team then Jagex and i fucking hate blizzard rn

Well......

TIL you don't need to finish rune msyteires for rc,

There’s a lot of weird shit like this in the game I love it

Haha then there is duraceldaddy being unnecessarily locked behind a quest haha

3 years after it was promised, only to then nerf it into the ground 1 day later. Lol.

As an aspiring accountant I can go along with getting paid the same as a doctor. I mean it's the same thing really. When your finances are sick you call an accountant to make them better.

\&gt; How exactly am I being a hypocrite?   
---
When you accuse someone of being biased.  And are also biased.  You are a hypocrite.  That's all there is to it.
---
The way I want to play the game is by belittling people who RWT their way to success or are too shit/lazy to quest or get fire cape. Why not let me play the way I want to?
---
How the fuck is he one of the best if hes 100 billion in debt
---
Use karambwans to combo eat with whatever food you're bringing. Helps a lot when you get hit during zulrah mage phases (40s pretty accurately) combined with the snakelings you can get combed out easily. 
---
Don't forget to change your recoil rings if you don't have a suffering. 
---
If you're not using void, serp helm would be good for a beginner as it provides venom immunity. Keep to body, legs and weapon switch to make it easier for yourself if you're using a non void setup. 
---
Try your best to attack zulrah as much as possible. The phases get more and more random as time goes by so stalling isn't an effective strategy. It's a dps race.
---
Dont worry about your armor def bonuses, zulrah will hit you no matter what you're wearing, aim for max dps.
---
Haven’t got there yet, but I’m on a push for cooking at the moment.

Chain bans exist your advice isnt 100%

Convince me
---
&gt;I openly admitted that I have bias, so you have no point.
---
When my point is that you're biased and accusing other people of also having bias is pointless, you admitting I have bias is just you admitting I'm right about everything I'm saying.  That's the opposite of having no point.
---
\&gt; That’s twice now where you skim over shit hoping you figured it out.

Why would I address the rest of your post when you admitted I'm right?

Wait black graceful is a league reward I thought it was going to be a reward from the new morytania GM quest
---
No, a ponzi scheme would be if he paid off earlier debts with newer loaned money. He's using new loans as leverage to make large amounts of gp quickly to pay off his overall debt. It's obviously extremely risky because staking is just as likely to make him go deeper in the red as it is to make him money
---
Hes not unlucky at all. The way he stakes is just stupid, and its almost impossible to win his money back like that. He keeps rechucking and doing bigger bets, then when the inevitable happens ( he gets cleaned) he asks for more lones. He’d have to rechuck like 8 times in a row and win all. Which is extremely rare.
---
They have 0 defence so it doesn't really matter it'\[s the same as dscimming vs a pure
---
Dungeoneering without it being a skill would actually be awesome. Having it be a skill felt absolutely pointless.
---
Summoning was good in theory, some pets were a little too OP. My favorite days with summoning were when it first launched and we were all rushing to get shit like geyser titans.
---
Or they can use their 99 agility to bend and stretch behind their back to cook that way.

Though I mean a button doesn't signify huge change, wonder what the back-end looks like getting that data from the server to the highscores.
---
This quest has a LOT of insta-kill mechanics (Vorkath has one insta-kill and one high-hitting mechanic if you don't freeze quickly enough, Galvek has two insta-kill mechanics). It's pretty dangerous for HCIMs since you can't panic-tele as you'd already be dead by the time you realized (as otherwise you'd have dodged it anyway).

Naw they gotta get the kids picking flax.

Drakens medallion free from a quest is ok.

Otherwise I’d just do crafting 99. Can flex aswell.

No jars..no knives/axes. And you literally have the same amount of ring pieces lol. I hate some ppl's rng man lmao. How are ppl so lucky. fuck.

Oh well. I have my claw now :)

The crafting guild is closer. But why not get both? Ds2 is a great quest anyway. And the myths guild has lots of dragon spawns and the closest stove to a bank.

Rightclicking on agility courses btw

He's the best one

lol no one cares dude

Yea but make it a 1m fee.

It seems that quite a few of the wrongful bans have been correct bans after the truths come out, I believe the actual false positives are more rare than it seems, and people are going crazy cause of a streamer getting one

Oh I didn’t know emotes were in the skilling tab

you never told him your rsn or anything, so had he been right there was no way to collect. you cant actually expect him to pay if you werent willing to do the minimum to make the bet legit

RIP title,  This is actually an Ultimate ironman.  As stated in the video I cannot do any action that is a right click action by default, which means no shift click drop and no changing the mouse buttons option to "1"

This means I cannot buy or sell to shops with an interface, and the only way to get items out of my inventory is to alch them or suicide.

Hopefully you guys find the mechanics of this account as interesting as I do.

Can you boost to the 68 mining requirement for ds2 or do you have to get 68 mining?
---
Q
---
If you have 45 con, an altar in your poh is worthwhile - only restore prayer some trips, but when you need to, clan wars tele to bank / restore all stats. Eg. when hp, run energy, agility, and inventory is low.  
---
  
---
Dds + super att/str is effective for killing karil

yes that would be the efficient thing to do

“The money in recently spent on hell hounds and rune dragons won’t be wasted”

There’s more than just that gravestone if you played around that era, there’s one gravestone called the Angel of Death and that’s the highest one which lasted for 12 minutes and the fee was 500k. The one displayed on the picture was only eight minutes long.
---
I don't think I am capable of doing tick methods, I'm just kinda dumb, but I am able to do raids, so idk.
---
I like the ghetto con cape point XD
---
Having an alt is a great option to use while skilling. In all aspects of money making not just Vorkath. I did Cox on my alt while doing a few 99s on my main. Easy money
---
i wouldn't stress about it, making an alt would be really helpful.
---
Set a goal, achievement diary cape is a good one.  You can break it into sub goals with all easy/medium/hard/elites.  They give you goals within that to work for.
---
Try and complete the collection log.
---
Try an ironman but likely if you don't already have the desire to play you'll be hard motivated to get through the starting levels.
---
Try leagues when they come out and see if the enhanced exp rate and relics or whatever they are get you interested in playing again.
---
Masturbate while you play until you've conditioned your mind to associate RuneScape with being horny so when you're horny you just sit there and orgasm to your character on RuneScape rather than porn/significant others.

Why are you killing someone with just a spade? Go after someone skilled up with gear and kill them quickly. The video is about entertainment yo.

pretty afk that way

barraging nechs is just going to give more magic xp per slayer xp since you cast on the death spawns too
---
Should've made the points 69420 or 69073 not 69504
---
Anyway.. here’s wonder wall
---
Strength potions, strength amulet, get your attack up to 30 and get an adamant scimitar. 
---
You can flash the attack or strength prayers to help you in combat too!
---
Also, one thing to keep in mind, is that if you went members you could do 1 hour-long quest and almost instantly get 40 attack and stength! (Waterfall Quest)
---
yo delete this fam
---
Nice.
---
Do this on an ironman so you dont get hp exp. Then Pick up the loot on another acc?
---
pretty sure the bomb maxes 255, so even brewed to 115 you have a 60% chance to die

Higher your total, the lower your chances.

Excuse me, what?

What’s wrong with dusting off some old gold?
---
So they're roughly 1/100k?

Not faster, high mining levels mean your pay-dirt can turn into higher tier ores.
---
no recent updates for sire have happened yet, they come out tomorrow
---
I got one account unbanned and one not unbanned the one that is still banned has half a bil on it Pog and the one that got unbanned was my OG account only had 40m on it
---
the bot farmers create their bots prior to bh2, jagex release bh2 knowing it would be abused by bots, bots abuse bh2 and profit, jagex reveal their master plan and ban the bots, the bots get replaced, jagex and the bot farmer are stuck in a perpetual loop of banning and replacing bots
---
is that accurate or am i missing something here?
---
Who’s gonna tell him
---
[Zuk](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/TzKal-Zuk) maxes 251, but [Galvek](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Galvek#Water) only maxes 115 according to the Wiki. Probably obtained using Stat Spy.
---
No way dude, its only fair to say they were both close to him, he's just being politically neutral /s
---
😂 I’m beginning barrows this weekend with hopes of the same things. Hopefully it doesn’t take me this long, but you’ve had great luck
---
U should get the pet at level 2
---
The weirdest part about this is that you are killing dust devils with melee.
---
So what are the updates if I may ask? If I'm reading the poll booth it doesn't sound too promising... I thought they made a small update already but I guess I'm wrong
---
Did you ever end up getting to your goal of 2.5k KC on Vork?
---
Better to just keep an eye on the OSRS Twitch channel tomorrow, if you don't know what this is about ;)
---
It's an option you pick when making an account. You'll have to start over bud.

This is obviously fake because your character isn't black.

Hey. Twitch prime users get a free 14 days. You should jump on that. Members is worth it no matter the level.
---
Nailed it, but the point i was taking out of that was, jagex could have put in more preventative measures to combat abuse on bh2 release. They instead dumped the update and let it get fully abused before taking action.
---
They're all called Capes of Accomplishment.
---
My b
---
Haha to true :')
---
slapp
---
No never.
---
High tier pickaxes change the rate at which you make an attempt to mine ore. 
---
E.g. rune pickaxes make an attempt to mine ore every 3 ticks. Dragon picks have a 1/6 chance to mine in 2 ticks, 5/6 chance to mine in 3 ticks. 
---
Mining level affects the success chance when you attempt to mine an ore.
---
Surprised my suggestion received such a negative response.  Seemed like a simple QOL improvement to me that wouldn't really impact XP rates.  I get that it might not be simple from a coding perspective, but chat's reaction surprised me.
---
Yes because everyone has 4 rune drag alts and 1 extra tab open to be an asshole on reddit.
---
I’m on a break from rs what is “twisted league”?
---
Cool they worked with you guys :)
---
I never said the loot was bad, the loot is fine! I'm talking about killing it, the first phase is horrible imo! Takes way too long
---
Why does runecrafting get so much hate lol I've never touched it because everyone seems to think it's hell haha
---
That's not how that works. Achieving isn't a skill.
---
Idk what you're talking about I took care of that plague bruh
---
Ah, the Tanzanite Mutt again
---
There are tons of amazing artists &amp; designers in the community, wouldn’t it be easier to commission one of them to work with you on a design and take the design to a tattoo artist?

Not trying to be critical, just a suggestion

Lol dont listen to this guy, so download the Robin hood app and head over to r/wallstreetbets and learn some and bang its merching in real life. Some guys recently found a infinite money hack.

The number of friends ive lost to that place is now in the triple digits.

What about RC? You can train that without rune mysteries... can you get the cape without it too? Serious question, I don't know

Dems fighting words

No, normal accounts. Not sure what the deal is. I’m guessing it has something to do with logging in and out.

Waiting on imp catcher 2.

You can... you just can't get free xp for it.

When you brew up, remember me
---
I  autoclicked nmz back when 6 hour logging had just been removed and got unbanned like 2 years later with all my stuff still
---
post the loot from those 13 kills

is she single?

yep, both accs gotta be logged in at same time. multilog, or if you are mobile only find a friend

I really struggled in that final fight
---
I actually don’t mind the fight for grotesques to be completely honest. I think it would be fine if it was worth doing, the issue is that it isn’t worth that fight for drop worth like 30k
---
why not just trade it... wouldve been a lot easier

$11 🦀

Yeah, but the cape I meant. Saw your other comment saying you could still buy the cape

I bring dust, chaos, lava and nature runes. I use construction cape to tele, so I guess you'd just need to carry a stack of law runes too. It takes a couple of slots but it only deprives 2 manta rays, which if you're maxed combat is worth it for the longer trips.

So you'd ram their ass with a hammer

No DWH or BGS?

How do u kill sire so fast then?  
---
Even after barraging scions to full health, when u run back to attack sire are you sure u are taking zero damage? You never miss?

I mean lets be real here, if anything happened, it most likely was his connection to the Royal family, not any American politics.
---
Davie504? Wait, you use the P I C C. OMG. I WILL CALL THE POLICE ON YOU
---
It wasn't op at all, it's still less profitable to play Bh than it is to farm zulrah/vorkath/hydra etc. The problem is that Jagex has literally one anti cheating specialist and so they simply don't dedicate enough resources to stop it from being farmed.

Thank you for this, setting my alarm now. See you guys in the league

Yes hate on the only update for bh in 4 years.
---
Not the bosses that kill the game and destroy skilling with their drop tables.
---
Moron
---
Could be like RS3, and have a literal community manager Jmod crying about how when he makes bad comments he doesn't like being told just how bad they are and threatening to quit talking to the community. So you know.. threatening to not do his job.
---
He use the Fingerstyle. He use the Slapp, but he use no tapp. OMG. What's this. He use the PICC. That is ILLEGAL. I will call the police on YOU
---
you don't have to wait to play, you just have to wait to pick the relic
---
I wouldn't mind a cosmetic comp cape but I doubt it will ever pass.
---
Can always just try to open the bond pouch, and you should be prompted with a bank pin.
---
CONGRATS!
---
20 kc and my only one is the hammers haha.
---
No fuckin way, thank you so much
---
smoke scape
---
It was thieving because I was afraid they'd nerf ardy knights so I got it really early in the acc.
---
The nerf didn't happen until over a year later
---
&gt;it is fun
---
&gt;it's good practice
---
&gt;...
---
&gt;but it's a waste of time
---
Wait_wot.FLAC
---
That's it? Wowowo
---
Also if their current soundtrack is sea shantay 2
---
lololol this legend
---
Should be 100m a month
---
Plausible
---
Talented gamer. Congrats beast!
---
&gt;Reclined gamers
---
?
---
No to all of them. I'd rather have a pet hunter cape.
---
I'll probably play it but I don't get who it's targeted towards aside from bored Max players and streamers.
---
You asked and I’m just answering. Chill dude, I agree it’s a dick move either way
---
With inflation, it's gonna be worth something one day :)
---
KekW
---
Wait, you aren't supposed to get it in 4 runs?
---
In other MMOs you dont get peoples loot. You dont risk anything. They are two totally different types of pvp. I dont think there is a single mmo left that does pvp like runeacape.
---
People can join a multi clan on their main or create a f2p range/2h purr less than a day. The only thing that makes it closed off is people perception of it imo.
---
Also needing a max pk build is a joke. It isnt hard to max any build for its current combat level and pk. Rng &gt; stats
---
I meant its not physically possible, the exp rate is like 35-40k an hour
---
I honestly thought it was like the lumberjack outfit where a unique piece is guaranteed every run.
---
L00000000l. Not a single pker on osrs want that type of pvp. What we have is a gem in a sea of shit. No other MMOs pvp can offer the fun and thrill that osrs pvp offers
---
It's interesting if you look at the original dev blogs as well, the pitched concepts varied quite a bit from the finished results.
---
There's definitely still user-designed, or at least, user-inspired content. In fact, much more so than previously. It's just not packaged as a competition so much anymore. I think this is more a relic from the early days when not many players were involved in the game and Jagex thought it could be a fun way to get people involved in shaping the game which might die in the next year (and it almost did). 
---
Fun fact: [Rooftop agility won by 121 votes.](http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=615). And the total number of people to vote for it was 1509. Things have definitely changed.
---
Knick knack paddy whack, give the dog a bone.
---
Dog by the Apple Trees and bench in Kourend too
---
Stuff like:
---
200M Herblore, 200M slayer, 200M Runescrafting, 200M construction 12 Min CoX solo with the crap gear, 34 Min Cox CM, 500 CM CoX, 1K CoX, 100 Mimic kills, 500 Master clues, 250 Skotizo kills, 2000 slayer tasks, 250 Superior Slayer mobs
---
Yeah finding 11$ in your monthly budget is really easily achievable.
---
Alchs are pretty important, and nature runes are not going to be easy to.find; at least not early.  
---
Magic dps will actually be pretty decent relative to the crappy mele &amp; range gear ppl will have early on. With the rune save mage slayer might be kinda viable.
---
You need magic attacks in raids, so reasonably high magic is needed eventually for that.
---
House teles will be pretty important for any number of methods, and I don't think you can buy law runes anywhere.
---
----
---
All that said, the run energy option is boring but there's a reason so many ppl have said they will take it: it's clearly better for a huge number of activities and almost required for raids.
---
I feel you. A very large portion of OSRS is basically just afk grinding while you watch Netflix or whatever, its just that kind of game. A lot of the really fun stuff like raids or bossing is locked behind fairly sizable grinds. Personally OSRS is a game I like to play to chill out and unwind.
---
Runecrafting works as follows, go to the bank, fill up on essence, run to portal, teleport to altar, click on altar, teleport back to portal, run back to bank, deposit runes, repeat.  
---
   
---
The skill is click intensive, has 0 afk potential,, and yet gives xp rates similar to afk.   
---
In other skills when you level up xp rates go up as you fail less/succeed more (say cooking burn less food/combat hit more often and harder), in runecrafting xp rates only change when unlocking a new rune, but even then it barely changes.   
---
The skill is essentially just running back and forth, there is so little time spent not running, that having full graceful has little effect, as the set bonus doesn't help much, you're going to either end up walking a lot or consuming an endless stream of potions to restore run energy, adding 5 extra functions per dose used (withdraw potion, exit bank interface, drink, re enter bank interface, deposit).  
---
Finally the skill doesn't really tie into other skills much, sure you can use the runes for magic, however with the introduction of runepacks in rune shops, basic runes are so cheap, that there isn't much point to craft your own in early game and even at mid game at all.    
---
    
---
Those are all the negatives of the skill. There's literally just one positive I can think of, at high levels, you can do decent money (not crazy or anything). So yea with all above in mind, you can easily see why it gets so much hate
---
Just pet the cat, other stuff isn't necessary. Game message will tell you the cat is lonely/hungry, pet it or feed it respectively when those messages pop up.
---
or makes you fabulous.. he looks a little light in the loafers... get it? 
---
i will show myself
---
noice
---
Crazy to think this is now easily accessed on our phones
---
Right click &gt; interact &gt; play with. You don't need any items.
---
You should pet it and feed it every 30 minutes. You'll get an obvious message when it needs attention (it covers your chat box like an NPC dialogue, and makes a red chat message).
---
When that happens play with it and feed it, since both timers are 30 minutes long and you may as well do both.
---
Do you know if she’s available?
---
Bait
---
weird crossover but cool!!
---
Would conflict with the other claws that already exist in the game as weapons. Also if you ignore that circumstance an argument could be made for mole claws, but instead we have mole slippers as a footwear. Therefore slippers is the most logical choice
---
Harmony intensifies
---
So then cooking on an infernal cape should always yield burnt food, that’ll be for all the burnt food collectors
---
Where's the flat brain one for an arcane drop?
---
Nope
---
Yep
---
&gt;Laugh reveal at 5 million subs
---
underrated joke, will use myself
---
Never realized how sexy the 99 untrimmed wcing cape look like. Sucks there no way to untrim a cape
---
That's why you lay down a few rocks over the lava, separate the pan from direct contact with lava
---
What a unique take on RuneScape fanart. Great job :)
---
Lol I’m watching HBO rn. Yea I mean it’s fun but I find that my every motivation is to either grind numbers or money. It was definitely more entertaining as a kid. And there is many ins and outs I just don’t understand them all and I feel like it’s holding me back.
---
"So many things can 1 shot..."
---
Name "so many" please. You literally can't. Yeah complacency / not paying attention sure. 1 shot? Not really
---
Countdown is wrong.
---
Any drops that can't be completed without a counterpart are dropped as the full item, such as the Kodai, Dragon hunter lance, ferocious gloves etc.
---
I remember when I had 50 Smithing I made myself steel armor and I thought I was an absolute baller. Then I got 68 smithing and upgraded to mith and I basically shat myself.
---
"wife"
---
These numbers aren't necessarily fastest --&gt; slowest, but they are approximately in that order
---
1. Crafting Cape is THE fastest infinite teleport and is super good to have. If you have the cash to get it, you should get it. The sooner you do, the better, because it will continue to save you time in the long run
---
2. Xeric's Talisman to Raids is very fast. Requires you to get the Ancient Tablet from Raids, which is 1/10. Not infinite, but stores 1k charges, has teleports to other places (like Glade for farm runs), and only costs 1 fang per tele, which right now is like 20gp
---
3. Farming Cape is about the same distance as Xeric Raids. Also has spirit tree
---
4. Mory Legs 3/4 to Burgh de Rott. Underrated AF.
---
5. Karamja Gloves 3/4 to Gem Mine. VERY fast, but only has a deposit box!
---
6. Myth Cape to Myth's Guild. Not SUPER fast, but has the swag factor.
---
7. Drakan's Medallion to ToB. Not bad.
---
8. Royal Seed Pod. Probably a little slower than Myth Guild, but it's a 1-click, which is sometimes important
---
Do you plant on bringing fire wave into raids? Afaik, the raids encounters you can mage, you can also range.
---
Why would anyone wanna watch this, potentially one of the most boring osrs series you could possibly make?
---
OMG I literally just subscribed to davie504 today. It's hilarious yet disturbing seeing a reference here lol
---
thanks
---
...so if I dont choose the save 80% ammo and runes will I never have access to an Ava's type device throughout the entire league?
---
Imp catcher 2: the search for more beads
---
account is still banned as well, I know the rsn. OP is full on lying trying to discredit me.
---
bruh this dude just won the twisted league before it even started
---
Well with the gear i have, I should be beating legit players
---
38k an hour damn it must take ages to 99 that shit
---
The pathing idea is my own and isn't concrete, it's an assumption that similar relics would follow suite. AFAIK, you can only choose one relic per vertical column based on the OSRS leagues Discord i've been in.
---
&gt;wield godsword
---
&gt;it's windy all of a sudden
---
So unfair to skillers
---
&gt;Are honestly as bad as you think
---
Did you mean this? One thing that worries me is training skills in like the 70s, since they already take so long with buyables on a main, I'm curious if I'd just get burnt out at that point on an iron after doing some of the easier stuff?
---
Will be hard to judge prices in the main game.  Scarcer cosmetics may be 200M ez
---
Dammit. This makes me want to just quit. Tired of this BS.
---
Always
---
It's so weird every time when I see this screenshots I get so nostalgic and a bit emotional thinking about those summer break rs days I had when I was little, all my friends were playing and it was honestly such a good time
---
That's because outside of twitter and reddit and the Q&amp;A they haven't talked about it for like a month. But yeah it's ironman mode, no trading at all, no taking other peoples drops they leave on the ground, etc.
---
ok coomer
---
Oops totally meant not as bad haha. On an iron when you get to the point of having a lot of level 70’s in skills, training is pretty much just as fast as on a main. Playing on a main feels like a GP making simulator while iron lets you explore so much content out of necessity. And the early grind of an iron (which is the longest compared to a main) is really the most fun of Ironman mode where you learn the ropes and how to fetch for yourself.
---
Waffle stomp it!
---
I would totally frame and hang this
---
Oh I remember that hellhole, it took me over 70 kc. It's not a money sink but a time sink.
---
do y'all not have 2 accounts? just 1 ironman main?
---
which relics ya'll going for??
---
\&gt;tfw all the youtube guys are going to waste their time on content I have zero interest in
---
Feels bad, but at least this prepares me for the group ironymeme release. Oh how dry my subscription box will be.
---
Get back to me when you hit 153, that's what it took me and the only consolation for that hellish time was getting heron on trip 130.
---
U still in evo?
---
I really like it!  Nice job mate!
---
Okay now THIS is EPIC!!!
---
Just get the Lunar Isle teleport and talk to an NPC?
---
Just same as DMM
---
To be fair you are probably insane if u get 99 slayer without unlocking duradel.
---
The rewards can't be brought to the main though
---
Tibia. Osrs. Windows xp. MSN messenger. I miss these days like you wouldn't believe.
---
I bought a t10 for a rune pouch and unlimited sacks
---
I mean that as pk'rs wouldn't get chance to hop so often.
---
Does anyone use the regular version?
---
My theory for a while now.
---
Point still stands.
---
It’s almost like pkers are the minority and a huge % of the players pvm and skill rather than pk
---
I wouldn't mind joining in on something like this, I've never done CoX before so having a group of people to grind with and then tackle it would be a lot of fun
---
Didn’t even include Hans, how could you do this?
---
See you can't even tell!
---
Lmaooo
---
I'm in the same boat. Excited for the league, but don't think anyone in my clan is going to play it.
---
No will. No pounders in the chat cmon bruh
---
Use a space the go next line 
---
Like this
---
If useing now.
---
You have to double space the end  
---
Before going next line
---
Whats up with the guy crankin' one out to the right?
---
I would be interested in something like this myself. Think it'd make the league a lot more fun when people can talk about goals, talk strategy, and the likes.
---
I was cutting magics for 80 wc from 75, because i wanted even 80. 3 logs before 80 i got pet and pooped myself a little.
---
If you dont have a period at the end
---
You need to double return to get it on the next line.
---
0 kc?
---
No
---
Them good hcim death mechanics
---
Really looking forward to this.
---
Gl, King.
---
Nothing wrong with d boots, the issue is the purchasing order. Torture is a better DPS increase than Bandos chestplate or tassets and primordials are a better DPS increase than tassets. With fighter torso, it's more efficient to get primordials before BCP as well.
---
Very stoked to see this come out! I personally wont be playing it but I hope it brings more users and action back into the game.
---
i get what youre saying. but its not like we dont enjoy, were just very passionate about our accomplishments on our accounts.
---
Hi acorn, let me assure you that one day you will be an oak tree
---
Dude ur accounts are sick. If I had more time I would be down. 
---
Btw do u stream or have a yt channel? I’d love to watch.
---
I don't feel like I play the same game as some of these gods.  12 min xeric raid solo. My first with a trio took 2 hours and 45 min the other day and I must have died 50 times to olm and all I got was a couple of torstol and a book.
---
More people RWT than reddit likes to admit. From what it seems, the introduction of bonds hasn't really put a dent into the number of bots and prevalence of gold selling websites. People like to say "He's buying bonds to keep them cheap for us" when in reality, I'm sure more than half of those players bought gold.
---
except its a clue step though... 
---
set effect saves like 300k in 13m xp, but with how active fishing trawler is you could just barb fish for easily 60k xp/hr anyways, so 5 hours of barb fish(where you get strength and agility as well) or 5 hours of fishing trawler, seems like its basically never worth it except I recommend you go get it either way.
---
One can only hope!
---
GL content creators. Plz everyone realize this is season 1 and there is going to be issues. On that note. Im ready for the November calendar meme slot to be filled
---
It's still possible to make 25m/hr farming Bounty Hunter 2 with two level 50 alts that have no stats.
---
Kind of silly that this hasn't been addressed in any shape or form.
---
what a sweet heart
---
Not before you can turn two mole pets into mole slippers. Never Forget.
---
Yeah that was kinda the point I made.
---
Well then noone new is gonna try it cause theyll just get shit on
---
Cammy too
---
just hop bro they removed hoplimits for a reason
---
This is so fucking cute :')
---
Cheers guys, I did a few tests dragging Hydra around to confirm as well. But it's always good to have others confirm the mechanics, because I feel like this is a useful tip that I've not seen mentioned.
---
I think everyone and their mother has done f2p pking lmao. First thing people tell noobs is to go practice on F2P with a new account.
---
It's not toxic enough. Not everyone needs to be belittled over everything, but players should be modest enough to have account-related insecurities and motivation to fix them.
---
give me your rsn ill refund you
---
Are the Abyssal Sire updates included in this? I thought they were launching together, but I could be mistaken
---
A little late but would you have any recommendations for under $500 that has a 1080p monitor? And can play Civ V as well? I'd settle for the T420 if it wasn't 720p.
---
Probs still wouldn’t bother to level it over 50 lol
---
It's literally every Thursday at the exact same bloody time. Learn to read a clock.
---
'Mighty oaks from little acorns grow'.
---
I too am ready for someone to fill it with BH v2
---
Requires mems to login?
---
Nice bro I’m printing this on a canvass it’s really more artistic the more I look at it, then I begin to really appreciate it, nerd art
---
kc?
---
Which quest needs a cat?
---
What is premier club?
---
heeck off i had to go past 99 to get 1 of those..
---
Could you play Civ V on that too by chance?
---
The Abyssal Sire changes are still in QA but rest assured they haven't been forgotten.
---
This, is content.
---
Im in the same predicament, im gonna go hardcore on leagues on my "main", and tryhard there, and on my iron im gonna play a little bit to get enough for whatever cosmetics I want, which is the house, outfit and maybe slayer helm
---
Well that's a cool concept, but I don't understand or like zeah tbh. thanks for explaining.
---
LMAO damn that escalated quickly but I respect it. I still get pissed when I remember getting scammed in Diablo 2 like 13 years ago. Bastard stole my platebody with a glitch that allowed him to tele in town. I was fuming.
---
thats not the problem, he had to log between accounts. items only show up now if  you were in the world at the time it was dropped
---
Exactly! Look at my friend 11ll1l1ll1 here! Or 38AAAA428JWA here!!
---
Still forcing me to do bh2 on all 4 of my accounts if i want to keep pking like pre bh2 launch? I love bh can we please have a way to BH on one account and get the runepouches on another. 
---
Please, i beg.
---
I can't wait to find out what will kill Torvesta this season. I don't know which death was my favorite but it's either dying to a cave (natural curiosity but during a terrible moment) or dying to his cave (brainlet oversight).
---
around 35? did last level with superiors and died twice that hurt tho...
---
Range is way better than melee if you're dps, if you have like 80 range and bp that's probably okay.
---
Bad news everyone, Island is definitely haunted. 
---
Meet in lands end, we're leaving.
---
Is that viable? I always thought it would be slow with these lower combat stats. Yeah I alched mage and cannoned the range.
---
Me too!
---
Cool af. And oof. I pk there a lot but never done the boning myself unless i pked them haha. Was thinking of taking my main there to go from 81 to 99.
---
Dayn I miss the webclient.
---
I agree fully! Great idea and I personally believe it should be implemented properly.  Gauntlet is a good start with pretty fair rewards I’d like to see it further fleshed out as well. Maybe something like the “one day” fremmy grand master quests unlocks their training dungeon that is just a endless rouge like. one like op describe. Make it better consistent money then gauntlet but take away super rares so it’s more like vork (1.5 m to 2m if going sweaty) so it’s viable but not insane and much funner then killing vork or zulrah. 
---
Ps sorry for any misspellings this is on phone before bed.
---
That is a really good point. There is no reason to not use the (i) so we would never see the og msb that we all love.
---
I get about 40k mage exp per hour with trivial range exp using fire blast with smoke b staff, occult, time of fire for all but ahrim, msb with amethyst arrows for Ahrim and tunnels. Rng aside, about 400k per hour in runes and Bolt racks, sometimes hit a nice piece and it's 3m+ per hour. 
---
It's not how I gain all my mage exp, but I do a few chests almost every day.
---
Hey so I'm just learning about different builds. I have two accounts I'm making "pures". 1 will be 40/60+/1 melee guy and the other is a tank ranger 40def 60+ range. Both f2p.  
---
I noticed you're calling this guy a pure but have magic and range on him... Am I able to do the same with my melee guy? Does it effect the combat level or just open up options later on ?
---
F
---
Mines the same.. think its RL
---
Runelite
---
Paired best with Harmony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkR7zClEkAo
---
Can't play
---
ye same, on RL
---
Can you dual log that same account?
---
Like have it on Twisted and have it on normal OSRS? At the same time.
---
(I know the answer is 99% no but one can hope)
---
I don't understand your point, I mostly solo NH tribrid. F2p pking is basically  a demo that teaches you very basic mechanics. You are better off doing LMS than wasting time on F2P, at least that will teach you to switch prayers efficiently.
---
How tho
---
What do you mean 10% drop? 
---
U get the tablet within the first 10 raids u dont actually have to do them you can leech from friends or clan mates who need to scale/alt a raid. We do raids can also be used to find teams who need someone as a leech to scale. If u dont get the tablet within the first few raids its a guaranteed drop on the 10th raid. Its not that hard to get tbh. The bank is only a few steps away from the tele and its cheap as heck to use
---
Bit disingenuous to promote Group Ironman on that page isn't it? Implies that purchasing a year of membership will be applicable for that account when GIM comes out, but that's just not true - people will need a new account, unless they want to sit on tutorial island for however many months.
---
Here's sea shanty 2
---
So don't play twisted leagues
---
Unfortunately not sorry :(
---
probably interface style plugin
---
YES PORTUGAL!
---
Osrs mobile updates but I don't see any worlds marked in green in mobile. What worlds is this on? @jagexhuskey
---
Game breaking bug within first 6 hours just watch
---
Yeah it’s RL
---
Hey mate, that’s awesome! Essentially a pure account is is normally an account that’s got 1 def. So it can be variants of all combat stats excluding def. Where are you training your account in F2P?
---
i dont have any twisted league worlds atm
---
Seriously, why would you gear up for a long session when you know an update is coming? It's like taking a shower 10 minutes before your mud wrestling match.
---
Can I make a new account for this, not play the main game then make the account a group ironman with this leagues rewards once group ironman goes live? I would appreciate if you can help with this question.
---
It looks that way in the website archive because skip votes aren't weighed properly there, if you check the poll archive in-game you'll see everything passed except the ancestral recolour.
---
Fucking hell alright mate
---
yeah you're right. Idk why they implented some of them anyways...
---
Careful man, don’t cut yourself on that edge. 
---
Fact is, gathering resources works the same on all clients. So it really doesn’t matter which client he tests this on, the XP drop us from the vanilla game, and that’s working, but he’s not getting any resources.
---
I don't think you're stuck in a lane. I think you get to choose 1 of the 3 available at each step.
---
It's gonna depend on what you're doing. 
---
Unlimited run will only really be needed for solo raids. For anything else its more of a QOL thing than anything else.
---
Saving runes and ammo will be nice if you plan to range and mage a lot to save money and time getting them.
---
The prayer one seems handy for pvm in the catacombs, passive prayer restore and just general pvm to save prayer potions
---
It's arbitrary rules placed on this subreddit by the mods so they can be lazy and have less actual moderating to do. As you can see in my comments to them, it's not very accurate and I had to message to have my post reinstated that was removed in error. By the time this was done, the post was no longer being viewed by anyone, as is the usual situation that occurs by the time they decide to approve a post. So yeah, it's irritating and I'm going to be irritated when I message them about it lol.
---
A hotfix has just been deployed. This should be fixed now :)
---
But first.....Therapy Time!

---
What if I don't use any guides, nor buy bonds, nor use runelite?
---
Ex RoT member here, this isn’t anything compared to what CI was.

Hijacking this comment to leave [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/duNr76z.png) from the [Twisted League behind the scenes video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVIhSiOGyJc).
---
I'm well aware it goes both ways. I never actually stated thay I'd categorically be able to beat any of them. Rather that I'd love to throw down with them. Just to show them their words can have real life consequences rather than hiding their fat man boobs behind a keyboard whilst stroking their needle dicks.
---
I did say I'd feel confident, but many times in my life I have been confidently wrong!
---
Nope.
---
I assume he means disabled
---
5000 points isn't even close to the end of the league. If you just got base 80 stats (which, at 5x xp, is equivalent to base ~63s in the main game) and did *no* other tasks, you'd already be at 5k+ points. That's gonna be done in the first week, easy.
---
To be fair, a self-respecting, self-confident person probably wouldn't say the kind of shit they're saying in OP's picture.
---
You can keep your original untrimmed with telegrab
---
What passed the poll with sire, i missed it?
---
It doesn't make it any less shitty
---
Looks nice, tough one small piece of constructieve criticm, try to avoid harsh lines (like with the path and the grass) and in starry night there are almost no straight lines (like on the castle wall or the fountain
---
They have done things worse than this throughout the years.
---
Tough I love what you did with the water!
---
Damn now its even harder to Pick one. I feel like there wont be much space to train agility and so its gonna be pain in the ass do anything rly. Meanwhile the other two seems really good combat perks
---
Ooohhh damn! Is your wife single?!

Safe word is "I'm going all the way to 99!"

This is the reality of Runescape's clan scene, has been for years, going as far back as the original rs2. The difference is back then, the clan scene was all there was. I think the only way to combat this is with positivity and shifting the focus of RS to other areas, which has been happening with quite a success these last years.

They should obviously be perma banned or at least perma muted for this, but we all know how much Jagex cares about this kind of thing.
---
Not bad for $11 🦀
---
Can't untrim it though so you're locked to one Cape, and that's only if you remember every time you get a 99
---
Lol I’m no high roller, they stole 6k natures and like 1.2 mil and a black mask among other items. I don’t care about the stuff, I’m more worried about how it happened
---
Yeah agility is pretty much barb fishing or wintertodt gap jumping. 
---
I think if you go mainly melee, the prayer one will be better.
---
Gratz man!! Got mine on 11kc
---
If you wait 2-3 weeks you will also have 2-3 weeks less to complete tasks and earn points.
---
It's probably an issue with runelite tbh
---
Didn't expect to see some oc here
---
Sure, it doesn't take long to get. Maybe 2 hours for the quests, and 15 or so mins for the outfit.
---

---
Not quite sure what you mean but what I think you're asking is if the relic you choose changes what you are offered in future selections. To which the answer is no
---
Since I'm still building up my first, main acc, I probably won't spend a ton of time in twisted leagues, probably enough for one or two cheaper rewards. But it does sound pretty interesting!
---
yeah i tried appealing under hijacked account and it didn't work. did you end up with any gear on there? I hope i have some cool loot on there if i get it back.
---
Yo can you add me to that Snap group :) I need more Jesus in my life  Snap: Arcane\_Art
---
Honestly surprised how peoples still stick to that dumbsterfire when there's perfectly fine Private Servers available without Treasure hunter.
---
Guess its some kind of fetish to play MTX ridden games.
---
1/32k according to wiki, yet I can't get a damm pet!
---
You’re a right prick, could have just explained. High school got you down mate?
---
It isn't a "tree" system where there are "paths." It's just five tiers of "pick 1 of 3." So you could go ABCAB or AAAAA or ABCCC or any other combination you want.
---
And no, you can't go back and pick relics from earlier tiers. So once you pass up a relic for another, you'll never be able to get that relic.
---
I'd love to watch.
---
And help you out in slaying those mountain dew drinking junk food eating lard sacks
---
Winter cc is awesome! Very chill, sotw, botw, helps teach raids and overall super nice!
---
You aren't in the Jagex sub.
---
I've downvoted you a lot the past week. But i wish i could upvote this more than once, you destroyed him. I also must say this seems like a much better idea than creating the whole cc or trying to rely on deliver items.
---
Has to be said, the more cruft is added on, the more obvious the antiquated design of the account system becomes.
---
As a single *player*, if I want to play a regular character and an ironman (even casually), I need two accounts. Now with leagues, a new issues arises where my accomplishments do not pertain to me as a *player*, but my accounts individually. So, if I want access to league rewards, wholly, I need to play the same league twice. That's some really strange UX.
---
Jagex should really consider modernizing their account systems, for a unified experience.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
What?
---
rot? that clan that had a Jmod for years helping them,that clan that ddos, and shit? Ah yes, sorry Jagex cant do a shit clans control this game.
---
It depends on if you can save a relic for later. And even if you play without picking a relic, it can slow you down compared to picking the relic.
---
I'd like it but your model is quite disturbing.
---
Reminds me of the pit of 100 trials from paper Mario the thousand year door. I’d love to see RuneScapes take on something like this.
---
We do already have fight caves and inferno, but for this I think it would be neat for every 10th floor/room to be a challenge/boss room, where upon completion you unlock a checkpoint like OP said.
---
What are you even on about?
---
I'm new to runescape but I know some mechanics of the game and how membership works. Any tips on what to do to earn a bond and maintain membership? Any tips would be greatly appreciated
---
They aren't bots lol, they're actual players and there are a few comments that go "this is a phish link".  
---
People who haven't played RS in years, see a RS ad and then write a short nostalgia post.
---
This is kind of a no brainer perm mute kind of deal
---
I want the rewards but my current main is an ironman. So I can't just buy the rewards once it's over.
---
fucking dutchies, never trust them
---
There is no solution for this at all.  
---
Not sure what you expect Jagex to do?
---
RoT is just trying to cling onto the little relevance they have left, since they stopped winning DMM conveniently after Jed was fired.
---
Possible internet issue in the UK - Lots of services and businesses are reporting offline.
---
Yep. Coal has only ever been 300gp each in the history of osrs
---
this is wrong.
---
My friend got banned while botting on his alt, he than appealed just to give it a shot right after the ban.
---
he got the same message like you **'period of unusual activity'** and got unbanned.
---
i believe that its jus a bot checking accounts-appeals 50/50 lucky or not i guess you were lucky.
---
Because they’re not making threats. Not that I agree with what these people are saying, it’s pretty fucked. 
---
Let it be a lesson to not share too much of your personal information online.
---
Is it even possible to ddos protect the osrs servers so we can get the old system back?
---
Normal bones give 4exp (rounding down)
---
4.5 x 5 = 22.5 x 4 = 90
---
dunno where the fuck you're getting 15.75 from
---
Bones give 4.5 exp per bury.
---
(4.5 x 5) x 4 = 90
---
takes something like 300 hours? But I made 168mil gp in those 300 hours and barely even paid attention the entire time
---
It's a runescape subreddit, not an official runescape client subreddit
---
Burying bones is 4.5XP * 5 = 22.5 * 4 = 90.
---
Now that was fast! Fixed 100% :D
---
15.75 is the POH altar exp, OP is confused.
---
I picked endurance just because I hate walking...no strategy involved.
---
Who designed that christmas jumper? It looks great, they really made it with the right level of garish.
---
How am I being an asshole?  You literally asked for feedback, and then you've been freaking out getting feedback.
---
Because runescape is the last bastion of free speech!! Reeeeee
---
/s
---
$11
---
been fishing for 15hours didnt get anything, please add 1,5bil to my account
---
Rsn, JmodTookMyGp
---
Just claw out the rusher and oraora him back to the garbage city of Lumbridge hyahyahya wow
---
You're a terrible person using someones cry for help as ammo for your arguement
---
Wow, those are really useful rewards! What relics have you picked?
---
Awesome art and style, got like a Hercules (the animated one) vibe from it.
---
Frostmourne hungers
---
3k isnt a lot and yeah most people probably dont give a fuck because we have normal lives Nd cant play 24/7
---
Blast furnace - doing gold bars. Ice gloves and gold gauntlets. For some reason when I go to put ore on conveyor belt it only adds one? I have no ore or bars waiting in the melting pot or bar collector
---
THE BODY RUNE TATTOO MUST BE CRAZY, that must be amazing
---
Sweet might work on an alt doing artisan and dinh's to just endlessly afk wintertodt entirely brain-dead like.
---
Get stupid amounts of XP and rewards there and decide if I bother doing anything else in 2monthmanmode.
---
Hey, a bit off topic but will there be a way to get stamina potions for raiding? I’m mostly playing for the end game of solo raids (will enjoy the journey along the way), but forgot I need staminas for that while choosing my relic and I went with the ammo one. Without amalayse  on Zeah is it just impossible for me to raid now?
---
Yes please that’d be hilarious
---
Definitely going for the Treasure Hunter relic. I love clue scrolls, and that seems bonkers.
---
First off switching to OSRS kappa
---
Thank you. I got tired of seeing everyone whine about the relics not being posted when they have literally been on the wiki since worlds went live.
---
Yes, targeting is a whole other story. But a random n when you kill him in the wilderness is acceptable for internet standards
---
It’s boosted XP just like it was in DMM, because it’s a time based game mode they boost the xp rates so that challenges can be completed by the average player, no bonus XP don’t worry
---
Interesting concept but there's literally no risk in the game, currently the only thing preventing a revert is ddosing. Pvm is so babied now I doubt the old system will ever come back
---
You get five times experience *within the Twisted League*. It's basically like Deadman Mode, in a way. The experience does not carry over to your main account, only the points from the game mode (which can be spent on tradeable cosmetics).
---
They're basically saying "yes, it's actually kind of feasible to max in two months".
---
It's a phishing attempt. Don't click anything. Check your rs messages thru the game log in to double check.
---
Many People will enjoy it, it’s content for content creators which is not a bad thing, and you don’t have to play 24/7 to enjoy it. If you and others don’t give a fuck it doesn’t mean Twisted leagues was a mistak
---
Would be a cool money sink to build 1 brick per certain amount of money spent to the "project".
---
And maybe players could get some construction xp from it, too.
---
Very cool! I didnt realize nothing in twisted leagues effects the real game. Geez I feel so much better. 
---
I called my buddy and was like whelp this is the end of osrs for me... lol thanks for clarifying!!
---
No they haven't... They were updated there like 15 mins before this was posted.
---
This is awesome
---
Then your a lunatic
---
That's 2t fishing.
---
So can you only go down one relic path?
---
Agility training literally is jumping gaps trillions of times though
---
It absolutely does happen to random people. It has happened to me dozens of times while hunting black chins. I dont vote no to wilderness updates cause i love wilderness skilling and pvm content due to the extra risk and excitement. but i do think something has to be done to stop these guys in max gear with 50 clowns falling in on you in singles.
---
Herblore you can’t. Rcing you can. F2p meta is to make tiaras
---
The left arm, the right arm, and then the forbidden limb
---
Thinking of going 3x resources if not just because getting a shitload of food and herbs for slayer/general use (like super energies) are gonna be crutch, at least especially for anyone that didn't take the infinite energy or dark altar relics (I chose the accumulator)
---
You can get them from the Dr Jekyll event but other than  that you're out of luck I think.
---
Now this is what I call content
---
There isn't a way to get stamina pots on Zeah but there is an infinite run relic that might catch your eye.
---
You pick one from each tier, unrelated to the last relic you picked.
---
Spoken like a true lad who hasn't touched the actual game. :)
---
You could sell that. 100%
---
I'd buy it
---
i remember not doing DS till level 86 on my original account, hell I was still too afraid to even touch monkey madness back then.
---
You can only pick one relic per tier and your choice is permanent. Every one gets the same choices at each tier regardless of previous selections though.
---
Most of the enjoyment from this game comes from achieving goals, not from the process itself. And from those achievements lasting for a longer time, or forever even.
---
Here's what im thinking, feel free to comment :
---
Endless endurance for early  convenience and raids
---
Hardcore harvester to limit time spent collecting supplies, including herbs (I feel like choosing task is semi-useless because everyone will be choosing best xp#drops task making them actually bad because crowded)
---
Eye of the artisan because youdon't need more xp in combat. The dps relics are acting as an xp boost for combat stats and you really want to spend less time on skills like Herblore to stack up supplies asap. I am not certain if artisan is better then gatherer especially with Hardcore harvester... Up to debate
---
Konar's blessing because I mainly want to pvm so this is a no brainer.
---
Xeric's focus goes along Konar's blessing for overpowered dps.
---
probably because the whiny man-babies constantly threatening the public reputation of the company who has provided us all with an alternative universe (often preferred over RL) where we can have fun and be happy with tens of thousands of people around the world. They blow up all forms of social media with slander that actually has no source or proof of actuality until they get what they want - a manbaby tantrum.
---
That's how I felt when I finally got imbued heart 40k xp before 99 Slayer!
---
Why is the jump from a small amount of points being 750, to a medium amount of points being 6,000. This is a drastic change?
---
How long is leagues open for? Like season 1 or whatever.
---
I know what you meant but it makes not sense. 100bil atm is a LOT. What you’re trying to say is. If you can sprint a 100m in 5 secs, Usain Bolt is nothing. Your literally taking air. It is alot, and will be a lot. If you’re a billionaire you can buy jagex, does that make the debt less?
---
Unnatural Selection is good for the farming contacts, not the slayer bit. With it, you can complete a ton of farming contracts every time you visit the farming guild.
---
I couldn’t care less about the slayer cape thing
---
Just pointing out that selfish assholes would never let people different than them have a fletching cape if it were on the table today
---
All the rewards were polled and over 75% of players agreed the rewards in main game are okay.
---
Democracy sucks eh?
---
Except the main allure of Twisted League seem to be cosmetic rewards that you can show off in the main game afterwards. These are tied to your account, so if you make a new one for the league, you won't have access to them on your main. Really stupid
---
Who's pked your spade lately?
---
L000l you trolling right....
---
The fact that no one wears his cape
---
It's just a super british way of saying it
---
Going the skilling route, thinking I'm gonna go:
---
1) Endless Endurance
---
2) Hardcore Harvester. Eyeing pearls and farming cycles, bonus that run synergizes with extra mats
---
3) Eye of the Artisan
---
4) Treasure Seeker
---
5) Xeric's Wisdom
---
Giving the people what they need
---
I'd let them still trade that cat for 100 death runes, cause 200k for 100 death runes is an insane thing to do
---
Making people restart the same game with a twist. The Jagex trump card.
---
not strange at all
---
oops i thought your comment was a response to a different comment and i took it out of context.
---
Democracy.. when i can bond 100 alts to vote no and gather 100s more votes from my discord comunities.. ye ok you believe that kid.
---
If it was in your inv that’d be sweet
---
The rewards are not tied to your account as they are tradeable. They are only tied to your account if you are an Iron Man, otherwise you can simply buy them.
---
would Iron men be able to store their gold in it? not that it matters, they could use NMZ or servants bag which have lower requirements.
---
Honestly, I liked RS3 more than OSRS for a while. I honestly hate a lot of the OSRS updates like Zulrah etc. I also miss a lot of the RS3 content like summoning and dungeoneering. But the game is such a dumpster fire that I can't even play it. 
---
The interface is so cancer that I can't even think about playing it.
---
I like this concept. I’m not lazy, I’m a no quest pure :)
---
New armor would be cool, but they could have made it significantly less powerful than it was, and still be a worthwhile upgrade over bandos/arma/ancestral
---
My treasure is there if you can find it. I left everything I own in once piece.
---
Lmao VR will be reality at a point
---
Rune shops exist so mage training should be easy, ranged training shouldnt be that hard
---
Not that much. There are goods in osrs worth over a billion. That...doesn’t really exist in real life. Value of currency matters.
---
I said not bad for $11 🦀
---
Well it's making clue hunting somewhat easier aswell. It should atleast be a discussion if we want that or not? I'm not necessarily against your suggestion, but we have made a lot of stuff easier and more afk with "QoL" updates before.
---
Only the trophy is untradeable. 
---
Every other cosmetic - outfits, banners, slayer helm recolor, teleport animation, etc (the actual cool looking ones) are tradeable. 
---
So yes, you will have access to every reward but the trophy on your main. If you’re an Ironman, well that sucks but you chose to limit yourself.
---

Real chad

---
I tried oculus yesterday it was fucking awesome, apparently they are only like £50 second hand
---
He could’ve just said ironmen
---
Do they give you only kebis related steps, or do you need to get lucky?
---
Can't alch if you're busting
---
One of my most happy memories was when I bought my addy armour (chainbody from fally shop, medium helm from barb village and legs from Alkharid). Then some random guy in varrok centre sold me an addy 2h. That was my gear for a long time and it left me broke (c. 25k was my stack in 05/06).
---
I haven't followed the whole twisted league fuss so do you know if you can log into the main game and twisted league world with the same character? And if you do have an alt can you chose to get the rewards o' your main char?
---
I assume both no but I thought I'd ask
---
But I'm 50kc with no claw :(
---
Meanwhile, everyone with dark altar: Have fun sustaining prayer pots.
---
Username checks out
---
Where are the dancing e daters
---
There actually was a guy who made a no quest Ironman and posted updates here for a while. It was shocking how much content was locked
---
hcim should get gravestones that last a few weeks. it would make walking past the mages south of Varrock exciting.
---
Possibly, who knows?
---
Despite the fact that they added a Pillory to Hosidius.
---
Was ratcatchers one of the ones they got an intern to do? The dialogue is some of the worst I’ve ever seen
---
It's open for two months! It closes on January 16th 2020.
---
Could you be manually clicking one ore and then clicking the belt? That’s the only thing that comes to mind.
---
This is why we wait to update the drama calendar.
---
Dont be so dramatic. Not all content is going to suit every single player. You just happen to fall on the side where it doesn't really appeal to or benefit you.
---
These are the old nex armours from 2008, there real armours :)
---
Don't stress and burn yourself out dude,  the journey really is the fun pay and you may find that not rushing to max is far more enjoyable.
---
Yea that would be rough for sure.
---
this is the 192nd last nail in the osrs coffin according to reddit
---
Even lazy flicking saves 50%, and the prayer orb makes it even easier.
---
Game is getting more content designed around ticks, so you might as well learn basic forms.
---
Very interesting. It'll be neat to see what combinations people try to mix and match.
---
Get a knife from Molch Island
---
the WR for solos is 15:34. There is no way that people have it at 15 minutes with limited gear to the area.  
---
Increased attack speed is a ~15% dps increase on whip, ~20-25% on lance (because no defender), 3a bow + dragon arrows is the same dps as a BP + dragon darts, kodai wand + tome of fire/fire wave is a 10-15% dps loss compared to toxic trident. You do not deal enough increased DPS overall where it matters.
---
League pets stay thru leagues. As said in behind the scenes
---
That’s so cool
---
Facebook can stop bullshit like this whenever they want, but they don't.
---
That’s gonna be so fucking fun
---
Omfg this should be sold for 2147m cash tbh
---
Kourend-locked ironmen, there are 9 worlds with 1k players each rn competing for prizes. Worlds 403-412 come join!
---
Yeah nobody outside of the community is gonna be a part of that viewercount lol.
---
I’ve had multiple beginner caskets that are worse lol this is actually decent for a beginner
---
I’ve gotten a cowl 2 times (1 gp) and like shit like 6 water runes or 12 earth runes
---
atleast that's nice
---
Nieve hentai
---
Also if you have a firemaking cape, make it count as a tinderbox at the VERY least? Useless but still makes sense
---
you can still manual cast to take advantage of 15% dmg
---
I have done like 10 tasks that could give me a superior since I unlocked it and not a single one has went superior yet.
---
Read the rules
---
It depends on your playstyle or strategy.  Just don't underestimate the accumulator, since diamond bolts aren't the easiest to come by in general, and rune saving applies for nature runes for alching, which is tons of money
---
Oh bruh. I won't laugh but why didn't you have player attacking options toggled off?
---
1 million seconds is about 10 days while 1 billion seconds is over 30 years
---
Oh okay thats dope
---
[deleted]
---
DDOSing is a pretty good prevention system too. Servers will start getting crashed within minutes of a death mechanics revert.
---
The only thing I've ever done even remotely close to. Is I recovered a friends account as a joke and he bet me I wouldn't be able to do it. And he sent over all his recovered info to see if any average Joe could recover an account shocker it came through on his zero. Right after however the info was changed and he was back on it. (I dont believe this is what caused the ban but I wont ever know because they dont share evidence)
---
Anyways that wouldn't matter because my friend was using the account that was banned at the time and if they checked the ip they would see I was not using the account when any offense took place and that I'm the original owner of the account not the other guy so why is my account being banned and not his zerk?
---
I think they said ***insured*** pets persist from League to League. Be sure to protect it!
---
Wildmudkip! He’s got a hardcore series from the last couple years and a UIM series that’s ongoing currently. I really enjoy his videos
---
Edited. 
---
Coulda sworn I've had some 1-steppers before. Still good, though.
---
You aren't even at pet drop rate yet
---
Pets are auto-insured on leagues, so
---
Combine woth insulared boots. I would be SOOOO behind that
---
You can log into twisted league with the same *account*, but it is a different character.
---
I'm with you.  I just got my claw at 1687 and am still pumped just to be done with hydra.  I was really starting to burn out on that boss.  You enjoy that well deserved drop
---
you can do the quest cape emote for.lumby diary elite right?
---
My thoughts exactly lol. Don't want to risk my account on an assumption.
---
It would be great if I was able to play on my main account and Twisted League at the same time. I want to play Twisted League but I also want to slay or do an afk skill on my main. Could this be possible in the future?
---
Hes annoying af, but shit at the game? Bro, have you seen him high risk pk? Csnt stand the guy but yo thats some mad skills
---
Also, just dont watch his streams?? Play the game and itll be like he doesn't exists at all
---
When the twisted league ends, will our accounts that we built up have their progress wiped or will we still be able to stick around on it for the next one?
---
You were never going to play 2 accounts at once, don’t pretend like you were
---
I don't see this as even remotely a legitimate concern. It's a game, not a lifestyle. You don't have to (or need to) complete every little thing in the entire game. If the only thing preventing someone from playing Leagues is their unbelievably crippling OSRS addiction they need to seek help, not beg the Jmods for multi-logging the same account.
---
I mean, I used to run Excel on my second monitor and would update my current exp to quickly calculate my exp per hour and how many more of a task I need to do to level.
---
Now the exp tracker does that for me, more accurately, and it updated each time. Super nice!
---
Just because you can't open a clock app on another monitor that just cycles every 15 seconds, doesnt mean people haven't been doing that for years before third party clients.
---
 I've used a real stopwatch in my hand  to time runs so I could populate spreadsheets to estimate times, I've setup a virtual metronome before to help keep time.  I don't really play like that anymore, but people use tools outside the game client.
---
i like the way the samurai garb look, sucks that the equipment is garbage.
---
Under drop rate for everything..
---
Where is that faster than a two tick bank teleport that doesn’t require another teleport option (house) or lunar spellbook? Nowhere. Does that teleport you to Jatizo/Neitiznot? No. Does that get you to relleka (with elite diary? No.
---
That’s the equivalent of saying get a dueling ring to take the glider to tree gnome village instead of using a seed pod. 
---
Stupid.
---
nice
---
And how are people making 25m/hr with bounty hunter?? Per account??
---
&gt;Our Twitch Prime promotion is here! Between now and December 10th you can claim 14 days of free membership!
---
Make sure to sell your supplies before the 10th. The bots are coming!
---
Who tf keeps a shampoo bottle next to their computer desk. Reading random ass things won't get you near top exp records.
---
Do the rune shops sell blood though?
---
Oh man, I have like 400 hours on Terraria. Never beat the last boss but I've made it to the last boss on 7 different characters. I think the game is extremely replayable.
---
Lock a lot of content behind 100 quest points then we'll see what the bot farmers will do
---
Wait really?
---
200m pray incoming with 160x pray bonus with all relics stacked glgl :^)
---
Raids has an energy well at the end of every floor though.
---
Lost my untrimmed Prayer recently. I can relate.
---
Even if you're using slayer dart, you'll want the tome of fire for being the only shield slot item with a magic bonus. And Wintertodt also just has some useful supplies in general, IIRC - you can't get Limestone elsewhere, for instance.
---
Thank you!! Is there any good money making methods?
---
That's just normal flicking
---
There is loads more portential then DMM thats for sure but like ive said, people now play it since its something new give it a season or 2 and it will die off just like DMM did.
---
Also when I try to log into the website it says "you have been blocked from logging in"
---
How about we go back to how it used to be prior to the ddos, and unpolled band-aid fix we're currently rocking? Dying has almost no consequences atm, its so dumb
---
I got no gold for armour or weapons, is there any good ftp money making ways?
---
I hide the NPC attack options so that pickpocket becomes the default click. Then I click it a lot. Alternately, I go to Pyramid Plunder to train Thieving, or follow Master Farmers around.
---
Blackjacking is... not something I do.
---
How many cumulative views does ninja get in the time it takes Settled to release one video though? That's the only meaningful comparison.
---
What’s your combat? And asking for pvp advice in this pvm infested cry baby waters is a dangerous thing
---
Honestly it isn't as hard as chopping magics on 140 account, or doing rc on 10 accounts, which would be the equivalents. It's way overboard and illustrated again how ignored the majority of game content is to the favour of an honestly rather small minority that are at the endgame bossing stage.
---
Accumulator because no RC and 85% more enchanted arrows
---
Wtf is this list for? Cox?
---
And will have different rewards per league
---
Vorkath hit me with a mage attack the same tick that he died. If only I died a tick earlier Id have the pet lol.
---
Damn, oh well.  Ya live and ya learn haha.
---
Just the unlimited run one for now  
---
it's been super useful idk what else im going to choose though
---
yea i was thinking lmao imagine getting a tbow or maul with 1t att speed jesus
---
I don’t have a DHCB but I found DHL super easy to learn and when you get a good BGS spec off you’ll hit 40-60 like nothing. Also doing a slow woox walk is super easy as long as the acid doesn’t land in some stupid pattern. 
---
I’ve though about selling it and trying DHCB but I just love the lance too much.
---
I think I've finally settled on mine.
---
&gt;Tier 1: Endurance. 
---
Reason: Infinite run with limited teleports will be handy in combat and in skilling, especially with the boosted HP regen.  Accumulator is solid, but mainly combat oriented.  The same goes for altar.
---
&gt;Tier 2: Hardcore harvester
---
This is the tier that I struggled most with choosing which to take.  Courier is amazing for gathering items that are far from a bank, and unnatural selection is a no-brainer for those more inclined to slaying, but Harvester will make gathering mats for the artisan skills 3x as fast, effectively acting as an exp boost to those skills, while boosting farming exp (due to time saved.
---
&gt;Tier 3: Gift of the Gatherer.
---
Initially I was going to hop right on artisan, but after considering it for a bit, GotG pairs incredibly well with Hardcore Harvester.  Our artisan is already effectively tripled with our gathering rate, as such, 2x gathering exp will help these skills to keep up.  Way of the warrior is kinda underpowered, imo, combat exp is the easiest to come by.
---
&gt;Tier 4: Treasure Seeker or Konar's blessing
---
This is another difficult tier to choose.  Spirit of Dinh is solid for going after 200m firemaking exp, as well as gaining resources, but won't see use outside of WT.  Konar's blessing is a must-have for those that want to focus PvM.  This will effectively boost combat exp by 10% (30% on task), and reduce the number of runes/ammo needed.  If you want to grind clue scrolls, then treasure seeker is the way to go.  Still not sure which one of these I'll take, but I'm leaning towards treasure seeker for the clue rewards.
---
&gt;Tier 5: Xeric's Wisdom
---
While Xeric's focus would be best for PvM, followed by Xeric's resilience, I'm a skiller, so Xeric's Wisdom is my first choice in this tier.  Xeric's focus would be my second choice.
---
Because high alch value stopped them dropping further
---
No idea their economy weird
---
How do you train it? Library books?
---
Lost my untrim recently as well. I forgot that it triggers on hitting the 99 and not on buying the cape... RIP.
---
Yes. Reddit is pretty clueless when it comes to PvP.
---
Oof
---
When are the q and a streams? I would love to catch one but I can't find even what day they're on
---
I’ve heard that pets transfer to the next season.
---
Not very accurate, there aren't any high level players along the wall just standing around talking
---
I don't like how you put a sky in my black void world. &gt;:( 
---
(looks amazing btw)
---
Undead druids drop a bunch of runes. Including Nats and Bloods
---
I'd say have it consume some sort of energy or item dropped from nex. Whether it should be tradable or not I'm not sure.
---
Repost

Every time I see the sickle mould that’s what comes to mind.

I'd like to say I know a lot about the game but I really don't. I barely played members, don't understand raids or bosses yet, just started to understand slayer sort of, and am running off of knowledge from when I played back then. I love how much stuff this game has and new tips and tricks people teach me along the way. I chose to go Ironman on my account so that I don't get pressured into trying to trade and sell everything and I have to learn to keep my money or find it somehow. I don't like using the wiki unless I absolutely have to!
---
Over all, I love this game and it makes me happy how many people are willing to help (shield of arrav) even if you can't give them anything in return. I don't get a lot of chances to play but when I do it's one of the most fun things I can do. I always set out to do 1 goal each time I login and so far it's going great, slow but great!
---
Thanks for being an amazing community and making the game a lot more fun for people like me trying to return and having no clue what i'm doing!
---
Saying yikes is yikes.
---
Updoot for jmod cs
---
No, cause it increases chances of mining. 5/6 chance to ATTEMPT to mine every 3 ticks, as your mining level goes up the chance increases, example : 64% chance to get an ore -&gt; 66% chance to get an ore
---
Just got the same thing.

I plan on bringing a smoke staff so I won't want to risk tomb as well probably
---
These were so fucking nice, no idea why Jagex decided to ruin Torva, and so many others, like barrows, armadyl, void etc etc
---
Hey im just commenting so you have to look at my post again
---
And from then on, anywhere I was going. I WAS RUNNING
---
I think an experienced PvP player has a lot higher chance of dying vs some medium tier in a pure fight than an experienced PvMer has in inferno. Bosses (even inferno) are difficult until you learn them, PvP is dynamic, which means it will always present more challenges.  
---
The hard thing in PvM is honestly probably for the most part the stats and money to do it, even if the bosses also can be hard.
---
And I'll remind you that you're defending someone who you previously admitted probably did as I said because it was common at the time. You always have something to say, but nothing of merit to add.
---
You can buy the rod from the fishing shop
---
What plugin? Mine only tells me Slayer task, not streak
---
? Lol
---
That is incredibly inappropriate. 
---
The 99 hunter cape would be a way better option.
---
Gorgeous!
---
You’re not getting the point lol. If you bought the gold, you know how much gold it is, I’m not on about personal value as that isn’t what the OP was talking about. Instead they were amazing there’s so many units in one billion.
---
But then what will he use to pretend he's better? :(
---
Uh everything is untradable chill
---
Anyway here's roundabout
---
14 days free with an Amazon prime sub. That's $13 for one "free" month of membership for each bot. I highly doubt people will do that when you can just buy a month for $11.
---
I didnt know u could only choose 1 relic per tier so i just clicked the first one, i regret the choice.
---
Sorry buddy, used them to dig myself out of debt.
---
Owed a great deal at the sand casino I'm afraid.
---
He wouldn’t be proud of using that picking attack style.  That’s illegal.
---
Tell them to reboot their computers. IT ez
---
I'm falling in love with the game all over again. Just hit my stride at 94 cmb getting barrows gloves after starting my acc in april.
---
Keep up the great work!
---
Wish I could go back and choose that, I underestimated how shitty Barb fishing straight to 60 agility is and how fast I can stack up a ton of energy potions
---
I'll probably be thankful I'm saving 85% of my arrows come doing slayer but right now it's a pretty rough way to start the league
---
It’s 18
---
BIS bass tbh
---
No you can get stams from Dr jekyll randoms by giving him a torstol
---
we'll see, depends if 99 fm /fishin at wintertod/barb fishin already earns +10k pts afk
---
damn, so there’s no point in me playing it. It’s just another Deadman mode.
---
Is there another place that sells axes besides the woodcutting guild? I suppose the alternative would be just smith them myself, but I'd almost rather just use the bronze axe til 60 than do that.
---
Did you not see how many tasks there are?
---
The game is about the journey. You have to have fun while you're going for that 99, not just during that one fleeting moment when you actuall tick the xp threshold. 
---
But if you're worried about the game going sideways I don't think there's a single online game that would fit your criteria for safety.
---
The Mods are already aware of this:

The best tier 2 relic (IMO) gives you 3x herbs from farming so ranarrs should come easy
---
kill cows and bank their hides and sell on ge, easy 50k or more an hour
---
As an iron grinding Zulrah right now... I appreciate this
---
It doesn't mean anything, but the point is that a poll with 4000 answers is more likely to be accurate than a single person's uninformed estimate. You can argue that people on reddit are likely above average, that people lie to look rich, that rich people are more likely to vote because it makes them look better,  etc. In fact, I would argue that all these things are probably true and that they're certainly pushing up the numbers. I'm just saying that I trust its estimate more than a completely uninformed estimate that has its own biases.
---
Ok boomer.
---
80 opens up barrows for sure, and even zulrah. Zulrah won’t be super easy or fast at 80s, but definitely doable. Idk what the requirements are for the wildy bosses so you may be able to do those too. 
---
90 unlocks pretty much everything except tob and high level cox.
---
Had Marcos pizza last night, you were right. It was pretty good. I appreciate the recommendation.
---
Yes, let’s be stuck with Bandos being BiS for another 6 years so we get more useless garbage like Justiciar!
---
At least one of the time-based tasks is probably literally impossible, though. (Sub-12m solo CoX.)
---
The amount of tasks is not my concern. It was originally supposed to be in line of cost with the home teleport. Now it's over 6 times the cost of something that was supposed to be a similar cost.
---
Aww youll get it man. If I did, everyone will :p i got lucky with pet tho at 1200 kc. And dude youre telling me..2600kc now and I literally count 1..2..3 on fucking everything i do in the game lmao.
---
drakes and druids both drop them, and druids are gonna be pretty useful for supplies in general
---
Wait does the home teleport animation get applied permanently from one scroll or will I have to get a new scroll each time I teleport home?
---
If you have a laptop you can set the trackpad to tap-to-click and just tap it for knights; I find it a lot better than using a mouse. Plus you can use any finger so it spreads out the strain instead of just placing the whole load on one finger.
---
u/ModFlippy and his crew are to be thanked for this. They really did an amazing job. I see a great futur for this junior dev.
---
Damn..... the throwbacks
---
Whip was still like 400k when chaotic rapier was widely used
---
Rsclassic ran until it had like 100 players online. Osrs will stay here for at least 20 more years. Probably forever as long as people pay to play.
---
The request that rewards Karambwan fishing only has a fishing recruitment of 5. You talk to an npc after to learn but I can’t anywhere if it’s boostable or not.
---
You can also make a Skills Necklace and tele to the farming guild
---
Pretty much the same for me. Those all sounds so juicy for skilling I can't wait to play when I get off work. I might go for Spirit of the Dinh for tier 4 as AFAIK the best agility xp available is that 90xp pillar hop in wintertodt.
---
Stop spamming them.
---
thanks u/rip_fat_wrecked
---
Not super hard, but they’re in limited supply. Plus you can get to rc WAY faster than bbds. Like 3 hours of library.
---
Gilded altar is unavailable in Twisted League, btw - no marble or gold leaf. The best you can get is the 1.75x Limestone Altar from Wintertodt, which is worse than the 3x of the Sacred Bone Burner. (The 4x relic beats even that, of course.)
---
So im assuming that this post was made by someone who can no longer do tob or zulrah? Wah
---
Amazing.
---
Thanks man xd. I actually like the boss tbh. I like that its not as much gp/hr as vorkath technically (its more if you hit drop rates on unique i think) but i prefer a boss that has a chance at s big item drop..like the claw here. 76m on one drop just felt so good. 
---
But now I'm in this state where i wanna keep going..like I have to even out on the drop rate some time right? Haha. 2600 kc and one claw so i should have 1.5x more. Idk I might keep going :p I am still rebuilding!
---
I have never had to use a stamina at Olm.
---
Chaotic rapier had an upkeep cost so there was an argument to be made for using whip if you were poverty mode.
---
This is really ignorant. Magic logs have no scarcity and their value is pretty much tied to the value of the magic longbow alch price. Scarcity does not factor in to magic log prices.
---
The same only sort of goes for runes - nature value is loosely tied to alch values, for example. Each valuable rune's price is generally tied to a few activities - bloods fuel ToB uniques, chaos/death/blood fuel magic weapons and bursting, etc., cosmics get their value from enchanting bolts for training/profit, etc.
---
ToB gp/h is strictly tied to scarcity. Unlike magic logs where the price is basically set by Jagex using alch values, you make money at ToB off of unique drops. The value of those unique drops is determined by player demand. ToB is profitable because it is hard and takes a very good account and very good player to do, not because Jagex balanced its profitability poorly.
---
Level up then kill them.
---
yeah man I remember my little brother telling me about osrs coming out like 3 months ago and I was so mad I was 3 months behind. 
---
I'm not even max combat... but I have like 6 good accounts so I'd like to say I've maxed in spirit.
---
It went from level 2 to 18 then didnt stop: [https://i.imgur.com/mKjUQFp.png](https://i.imgur.com/mKjUQFp.png)
---
I dont know how or why.
---
Thanks brotha, 54 was a grind. One of these days I’ll get 55.
---
Fight the Venezuelans for wines of zammy, have fun :)
---
A poll with 4000 answers will probably be more accurate than a single persons estimate, you are right. 
---
But having 0.3% accuracy isn't good and shouldn't be a reason to believe 0.3% accuracy over 0.1% accuracy. It's still wildly inaccurate. It's all going to be up to whatever you believe.
---
No, its multiplicative. The maximum prayer xp bonus you can achieve is 80x, which is pretty awesome.
---
Slayer dart does not scale damage properly because you can't get the enchanted version.
---
Wtf are these comparisons dude lmao
---
I used Nieve for mostly cannon tasks until about 75-85. Started doing Konar and Dura tasks and did as much bossing as possible until 99.
---
Even with the massive buffs?
---
They were assuming the robe recolors would pass. 6k points isn’t a huge amount. Probably get there through wt and aerial fishing alone.
---
Thank you
---
How long do I have to wait for fricking fire staff
---
The thing is i dont want to be stuck doing chambers only. I got the tbow and i also want to help out the CC im in as well. I got BASIC BASIC gear and its amazingly fun since i have to "learn from scratch" again just a tbow added instead of a crossbow.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Twisted_League/Tasks or directly in game.
---
Brilliant
---
I'm having some trouble relating the tasks to the endgame main account rewards. let's say the house reward is 4,000 points. are those the same points as you get for completing tasks? like 1 easy task gives you 10 of the 4000?
---
Try robes that aren't green colored
---
*wink wink*
---
Say that to my 253 solo KC.
---
Wiki : https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Twisted_League/Tasks
---
shops restock fully every 24hours usually. so its basically 12hours per staff i am not mistaken
---
other than it being a load of fun and the sickening slayer helmet recolor i'm going to get on my ironman when it's all over
---
It's fun! Just after 300 kills it gets tedious :P i loved having the bank to do what ever i wanted when ever i wanted. But now getting the bp drop from zulrah was so much rewarding than just buying it from the g.e :)
---
This is going to sound stupid but I like the lines because it gives a sort of contrast between nature and the man-made structures in lumby. I also get a dream-like vibe with the perspective and lighting, which is awesome.
---
I don't know anything about art so my opinion doesn't hold a lot of weight but it is what it is.
---
Mod Ash confirmed it
---
trap em. ardy knights move too if you dont trap
---
Tbow's good there? Will give a try thanks so much!
---
I think the effort to create a new league, especially now that the infrastructure is in place for them, is very low. They just need to come up with some kind of gimmick, and handful of relics, and a list of tasks. That's basically nothing compared to all of the work that goes into producing a brand new piece of big content.
---
I think it can be compared to the ironman game mode in general. By adding ironman they give people a reason to play all of the existing content over again. That's almost doubling the amount of content in the game, forever, for the small one time investment of adding the ironman mode.
---
Games lose players because players get bored. Jagex has finite resources to devote to creating fun new things for players to do. Things like leagues and ironman mode are insanely efficient from a labor to benefit perspective.
---
If anything, the fact that Jagex has found another good way of leveraging existing content in a sustainable way gives me more confidence in the future of the game.
---
Yeh these posts popped up for dmm too

&gt;We’d like to thank Runelite for their full cooperation with the rules outlined in this post.
---
One of the last blog post or whatever on osrs website.
---
Check out the wiki on the matter. It should clear it up. Quests aren't skills. A skill cape is a cape from reaching 99 in a skill. Music isn't a skill, and neither is completing achievement diaries.
---
Just because you didn't know something doesn't mean you have to get grumpy when someone explains that you're wrong.
---
Yea t bow rips them apart
---
the harder it is to get them, the better it is to save 85% of them...
---
I've already said this but trapping is completely useless because its only about 30 pickpockets per easy clue plus it doesn't matter because you have to right click
---
Path of exiles entire thing is playing the same story each league and then playing the same maps over and over again, an it has more players than osrs lol, as long as they keep it interesting people sill play
---
Nope. Op is quoting the price of:
---
* a group of 3 maxed players
---
* working at near max effiency
---
* when ToB was first released
---
Its no where near that now
---
Correct, one relic from each column only
---
correct, 1 from each tier and you cant change your choice once you make it
---
too bad this wouldn't look good in OSRS atleast the way the concept art looks
---
way too modern/hd.
---
did u clean ur pant
---
what is that?
---
Less players.
---
Maybe its 73
---
I’m stuck at work as well trying to figure out the best tier 2 relic, seeing as I’m going to be almost exclusively skilling for the first couple weeks, I just can’t tell if triple resources is going to make constant banking a pain, but I also don’t want my bank cluttered with barb fishing shit
---
A good majority of people were bashing league a week ago saying it's a waste of dev time. Idk what this sub thinks sometimes.
---
Sorry i was joking i was expecting "jagex" as a response.
---
reported
---
Cunts I do know this. Jesus calm down dudes, you fucking bunch of fat nerds!
---
While true, I don't anyone getting enough for that to even be viable, while it does sound insanely strong.
---
Fun is not efficient
---
I’m not saying everything from RS3 is bad, I know OSRS isn’t going to be completely original. The point is that people keep suggesting EOC stuff be added or even the nex armour which came right before EOC IIRC. Id honestly rather see some things from private servers I used to play implemented than most of the stuff that gets suggested on this sub.
---
That's sick man. I like it
---
Yeah, but with the accumulator those runes last 10x longer
---
With the dps upgrade, it’ll be more realistic long term to use broad arrows (tbow) and broad bolts (dhcb) in conjunction with the infinite run since they’re easily accessible and the only way to get stams is from random events. Although the clue relic can help this (by providing easier access to purple sweets)
---
To be honest, tbow doesn’t have a gigantic number of uses. Blowpipe is better in a lot of situations. It’s valuable because it’s REALLY strong in a couple different situations (cox and tob mostly).
---
I was considering this but even at mid/endgame iron, gp is never an issue. As long as you can buy runes/arrows 85% retention isn't worth much.
---
When you get enough gp doing cerb task can make you bank just need spectral/rune knifes
---
I think he means play the same char on the TL server and regular server at the same time which you won't be able to.
---
No. The profitable items to alch are generally expensive (rune items) so you won't be able to buy many with such a small cash stack.
---
Someone inform me what any of this is
---
Oh I’m not confused, I completely agree! It is odd that OP’s name is suspiciously similar to my name if you’re confusing me with him, my brother. I was wondering why you were wording your above comment addressing me
---
Oh boo hoo you'll actually have to put effort into something comparable to a legendary drop :(
---
I think that player intentionally typed in public chat for the sake of making this joke.
---
If anyone can do it, it'll have to be by abusing 1t dragon knives. In zeah gear they're like 30-40% more dps than bp + dragon darts in bis range. You'd have to go ava's + choose-your-own-slayer-task for them to be a realistic option, and then get your stamina potion from a jekyll random.
---
Other option I can see is that they mentioned konar's slayer task list is modified...maybe there's a cox/olm task? (which would let you get 30% accuracy/damage)
---
Venezuelan economy would get even worse
---
if its only 30 pickpockets then why is it a huge problem to have to right click?
---
Thank you.
---
yeah im inclined to agree with you, but even just avas with 1 tick rune knives would be pretty dope
---
From a Google search, History Supreme was a yacht that sold for over $4 billion.
---
If only we had some way to craft blood runes on Zeah...
---
Either stop playing or create a new account while playing on the current one. Make afk money on current one and level up your alt until you're satisfied and move on.
---
Right, forgot about how poor their gear will be.  The 1 tick buff is such a massive dps boost I thought it could do something.  From 4 to 3 ticks or 3 to 2 ticks is a 25% and 33% dps boost
---
I figure with the infinite run I fletch faster than I'll train range anyways
---
If you're there for 2 hours your kitten will just grow up, problem solved
---
because they move and its about 30 pickpockets x 2000 if ur going for flared trouses on average and you have to pay attention
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Reward_casket_(easy)
---
check again
---
EnduranceGang
---
Can I have one?
---
Xeric's Focus is pretty interesting when considering what will be BiS for each attack type.  
---
It increases the attack speed of all weapons/spells by 1 tick so the faster the base speed of a weapon, the larger the percent increase in damage you'll get from this relic.  
---
6 tick → 5 tick (16.67% damage increase) e.g. Elder Maul, DWH  
---
5 tick → 4 tick (20% damage increase) e.g. All spells, Rune Crossbow, Twisted Bow  
---
4 tick → 3 tick (33.33% damage increase) e.g. Abyssal Whip  
---
3 tick → 2 tick (50.00% damage increase) e.g. MSB  
---
2 tick → 1 tick (100.00% damage increase) e.g. Knives, Darts  
---
The only usable magic damage is the spells in the standard spellbook but with Xeric's Focus it will be like having a 4 tick trident. With no way of obtaining wrath runes, the highest damage will be 20 with Fire Wave.
---
The Abyssal Whip is the BiS melee weapon and with Xeric's Focus it will attack as fast as a 3-tick MSB on rapid.  
---
I originally thought the Rune Crossbow would be the BiS ranged weapon for this league but with Xeric's Focus the MSB becomes 2-tick like a blowpipe.  The only way of obtaining a MSB is from hard clues but it is almost a 1/5 chance to get one from a hard casket so it shouldn't take too long to obtain.  Rune arrows are also easy to farm with several sources in the league such as raids, drakes, fire giants, dust devils, brutal dragons, etc.  If you can find a way to get a large amount of knives or darts then with Xeric's Focus you will have a 1-tick ranged weapon with incredible DPS. Choosing the Abyssal Accumulator as your first relic might be worth taking just to preserve your throwing weapon supply if you plan on doing a lot of PvM.
---
Almost like they are stars... hmmm
---
I guess I was talking about the 12 total, up from 4. Don't think they've added any extra since launch... (not really any more room)
---
yeah, i'm not trying to push anything so i'm going for what lets me be the laziest/speed up skills I hate.
---
as I said in my first comment, the rewards don't really interest me so I don't really see the point trying this out in the long term even if it has increased xp rates
---
that's relying on clue luck, and that's unreliable.
---
I want this
---
You couldn't be any more correct. It gives me chills still to this day hearing the lumbridge theme music or the start screen. My first playthrough of runescape was by far the best experience in gaming of my life.
---
Ohhhh
---
I have got a dhcb do you think unlocking brutal red dragon and mith dragon will be worth it? I usually slay for gp.
---
Also got steel drags and iron drags on block too should i unblock them too?
---
So pretty
---
Wow! I need a framed print of this more than I care to admit.
---
im on your side, honestly they should just make everything left click only because right clicking is hard
---
Gratz on the IH.
---
But why did you scribble out stuff like your coins and CB?
---
&gt; Increased attack speed is a ~15% dps increase on whip
---
Wouldn't it be a 25% dps increase? You normally attack every 4 ticks with whip, the relic changes it to every 3 ticks, that's 25% faster.
---
The real Bounty Hunt begins!
---
Awesome, I'd buy a print.
---
You know this is runescape we are talking about?
---
It was probably deliberate
---
-new player “ooo twisted league world”
---
-Jagex “you need to be a member to log into this world”

-new player “i might pay for membership”

The whole mystery of the frozen door.

And then here it is guys,here’s the bit we came for,

the text at the end, that long green line of text. We did it. 
---
Beautiful art. Thank you for the memories.
---
Depends, some countries work closely with other countries when it comes to cyber crime
---
Someone in another thread mentioned that there is always the possibility that leagues are not successful. Then how do we get past league rewards? Pretty good point imo.
---
I think I have to go with artisan for crafting herblore and smithing
---
Is that unspent points for the post season rewards?
---
What happens after the league ends? What happens to our league character? Are they erased back to zero skills? And we just get league points on our main? 
---
Very curious to know!
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Keep it. It’s a good reminder for f2p to buy membership
---
Always good to remember that the loudest people don’t represent all the people

It’s the prayer one. Tedious chose it, and Tedious has a Zeah ironman and likely has the best strategy to max Twisted League

Interesting, i did not know that. Then I would recommend just going for the zammy cape as well
---
Nothinglasts will definitely be uploading
---
You **can** boost the level.
---
Source: did it myself.
---
Get all rewards. Try to get close to maxing.
---
hate is a good strategy already I'd say
---
Runes though....
---
6545...6546...
---
This only works if you amass enough wealth on one account to amass suspicion - like what happened to Fishy or whatever his name was, and he openly advertised it
---
Thanks man! But how should I 20 thieving for the quest? Cause it requires 30% favor to catch worms.
---
Rip
---
Just get 50fm and get it at wt! (Or just go to general store)
---
Yeah, that's certainly a possibility. Personally, I suspect that Jagex would add in some alternative way of getting the items in that case. Though how long it will take for them to do that when/if it happens is anyone's guess. Jagex isn't exactly well known for fixing broken things quickly.
---
Myyyy
---
You can still do it and just not do windertodt. Unless you plan to max, there's no reason you have to get 99 fm.
---
He's 2 tick mining by clicking the rocks between rat attacks, if anyone was wondering.
---
Nice work mate!
---
Shouldn't lost city be complete too? Dust devils drop a dragon dagger that will be useless
---
I don't have a specific goal; i just like to goof around and enjoy the massive xp drops lol. Perhaps i'll go for the golden tench!
---
beautiful!
---
It's a meme. People can find out your RS account name if you give them too many details sometimes, so people block their stats. But its become a meme to block out arbitrary numbers.
---
Just ban everyone! Cant tolerate this kind of cheating.
---
i will i swear to god ill do twitch prime jagex please
---
Sounds like a plan, thanks for the advice!
---
You must not have searched reddit.....repost.......
---
I've seen this exact text elsewhere. Its just a meme.
---
Oh that's a decent amount of time
---
Whoosh.
---
bots
---
You'll need that infinite run when you're running back to altars twice as often as prayer boys.
---
You the real MVP
---
Thanks :)
---
You don't even get an account if you use an auto clicker
---
Think of the time savings!
---
steel and irons have low enough task weighting (aka are assigned infrequently) that it is generally better to skip them instead of using a block slot on them
---
Look up Zeah Hero guide. Also join
---
Twisted league discords
---
That’s smart, hindsight; ask reddit first.  I rage deleted the OSRS app already.
---

---
yeah i think its literally so it isn't /100 all the time 
---
it'd mean the text would need to be smaller for what they thought was no reason to accommodate up to 100/100 rather than 99/99
---
Have you ever done anything for more than a thousand hours? Just curious. Cuz if you haven't, then I can understand why you would think this way.
---
Id use verac. Great balance of defence and prayer. You don't need mage robes at barrows because their magic levels/defence is 0
---
Yuppp
---
How do people get badegs to show them things like monsters health, or drops on the floor labled, or how much time a potion has left?
---
I feel like it comes down to what you plan do for the league. 
---
Endless Endurance is amazing for the beginning of the account or specific steps/goals you may have in mind. But once you really start training agility it slowly devalues. 
---
Dark Alter basically negates the reason for using a house alter, so if you're going to max melees and grind a lot of PvM because of the reduced prayer drain rate this is the obvious choice.
---
Abyssal Accumulator at first glance doesn't seem all that great when compared to the other two, I haven't really explored much but saving 85% of your runes when you do something seems really good on paper but it also comes down to how accessible runes and ammunition truly is. 
---
My $0.02 🤷‍♂️
---
Do the prayer trick, where you try to activate a prayer you dont have
---
Hi, Im a friend of him. The problem is.. He always used paysafecards or wallie cards to buy bonds. Bought it at some local stores and did not keep the receipt.. There a probably still id's in his email. But he can't access it anymore. Thats also the main reason why his appeal is denied for like 3/4 times now. He cannot provide that information.. But thanks for ur input man!
---
They said in their latest q/a that they're still in the design stage and cant commit to a quarter in 2020. They also said they need to finish clans first which is complicated, then start development of GIM. 
---
So it could be a while. Very good possibility it doesnt come until 2021.
---
Ouchie, bad luck on the bucket, considering Hespori can be done nearly daily and drop rate is 1/35. Gz 99 though. Hoping this will be my first 99, is it yours?
---
Titsss
---
Couldn't they tele grab it?
---
This is so nice it hurt my eyes
---
Wtf is this twisted league?
---
are you wearing it lol
---
I chose it as well, as I plan on mostly skilling &amp; doing the 'easy' PVM challenges (aka getting drops/completing CoX X# of times, not the time trials or challenge mode trials). I'd rather make energy pots over pray pots en masse tbh.
---
Get one more and you're ready for Zulrah kappa
---
i'd be lying if i said i wasnt jealous!
---
As someone who is wholly ignorant to the min/maxing meta of osrs, it can feel nice to just explore but a lot of the time it’s just getting called a “unit” when I show up at the ge lmao.
---
That's respectable. But I think we can all agree the Dark Altar is for smooth brains.
---
If your still having trouble head towards the forgotten login route. You’ll be able to contact them via that.
---
Clue solvers are officially okay.
---
Does the full prosector outfit also provide a 2.5% increase to xp when paydirt gets cleaned by the hopper?
---
Tbow is really good at demonics too
---
More Jmods would leave and salaries in the oldschool team would go up significantly.
---
They have removed free trade before in the original runescape, alot of similar things would happen.
---

---
And this is why I as well as many others use private instances for Kraken :D
---
I was planning on doing things like this but then it occurred to me that getting 99 firemaking on Twisted league would be the same as getting 2.5m firemaking exp on my main, getting 77 runecrafting from 1 in Twisted league would probably take more time then it would take my main to get up to 77 from where it is right now.
---
General stores don't have it, I think... 
---
But there's one for free on Molch Island
---
Your evil lol but I love it !!
---
Died with mine walking to todt as well. You and I first two to get Rocky pets in game same time. gz :)
---
get those level 20 stats
---
I feel the same way with Dark Souls. No matter how many times I play it, it can never captivate that first time run feeling.
---
I don't think so... I've seen way too many pets on people with ~40 in a skill. WC, Thieving, Mining, etc.
---
It's especially bad when you realize that you're going to have to be doing end game content with an RCB if you don't want to pick the ammo back up, and even then chances are you're gonna want to pick up the enchanted bolts due to the fact that you can only get cosmics through monster drops, which comes back to saving 80% of the runes.  Running everywhere is nice tho
---
Keli is a man he just looks like a girl 😉
---
I gotta get my Hans on this!
---
Rewards in main game are tradeable. So you can just trade them across. But you can't directly transfer points.
---
You can login with any account with membership. But similar to how you can't play DMM and Regular at same time, or RS3 and OSRS at the same time, you can't be on both simultaneously.
---
I plan to play on an alt and buy cosmetics I want / sell them for profit if they're worthwhile selling.
---
You say redesign like you don't assume the first trailer was bad on purpose just get lots of press coverage and that they didn't already have this version ready to go. Geez Kieren do you even conspiracy theory?
---
[current stats](https://imgur.com/a/esiZOIR)

Have about 3.5M in liquid gold. What’s best way to get about about another 1-2M? Looking to buy blowpipe as soon as I can use it.
---
If something recommends has prereqs I can get fairly quickly I’ll do them to achieve better gp/hour. Thanks.
---
Upvoting and commenting for more exposure because this is incredible.
---
Please don’t trim his cape.
---
Zulrah shit would go through the roof
---
I purposely dont look up efficiency guides so I'm still very inefficient. Only guides I'll use are for quests. I've come a long way but still constantly ask questions about things that I guess are obvious, so everyone thinks I bought my account or botted lol.
---
Use your brain, it's not hard. Tip: The answer is water.
---
Yeah, the slayer task part sound good, but you'll quickly find that everyone who selected that relic will also be picking the same tasks as you did. Those spots are going to be crazy packed if the game mode doesn't die off.
---
You don’t, you can play both game modes on the same account.
---
Yeah it’s painful for me, but works for him so whatever
---
Don’t swap worlds
---
I logged in, tried it for 5 minutes then just went back to normal ironman. Can't be bothered wasting the little game time I have. Doesn't seem like anything special to me tbh.
---
This about summarizes my feelings
---
Sorry to hear. This exact scenario is posted all the time so hopefully people will finally take the hint. Stop interacting with scammers and all and they will stop doing it (probably not cause they are losers ) but might as well.
---
I mean.. I've never used a Stam in CoX as a requirement for anything except Tekton. Which you would just scout to avoid.
---
If you're in a group run is a non issue. But gathering ammunition? Bit more of a question. Id say 85% reduction in ammunition usage is far more benefitial in CoX.
---
The run perk is purely a lazy perk. It makes the initial chaos nicer and such. But it really doesn't add a benefit to anything over the other two choices.
---
Same goes for the later tiers where there's one to bank your resources while skilling. Sounds nifty, but it's really pretty useless. All your skilling methods that involve banking are done close to banks anyway. So it's mainly a lazy perk
---
Dragon pick has a faster 'attack speed' than rune. Speccing means you 'hit more accurately' for that short bit of time.
---
Or super energy since no mort myre funghi
---
I'm not who you asked but yeah you can do that and yeah they can go on the main game whenever you want
---
you blurred your eyes lol
---
Energy potions exist and are rather affordable to make. Plus you don't have to travel across the continent over and over again.
---
Cool achievement. I have 5 questions for you!
---
1. What is your mother's maiden name?
---
2. What was your first pet's name?
---
3. What was the name of your first boyfriend/girlfriend?
---
4. What is the name of your favourite teacher in school?
---
5. What is your favourite TV show?
---
This is the sad part.  If he had an endless stream of high risk fights I’d like his stream but he can’t get fights and is addicted to staking which I can’t stand.
---
Don’t all pets transfer over to your account afterwards? I thought I heard or read that somewhere
---
They say that in case of malware in unofficial clients. They can't be held liable.
---
Barrows is good, especially with underground pass for iban's blast and morytania hard diary.
---
Blowpipe costs a lot more to use than it costs to buy, if you can't afford to even buy it then you definitely can't afford the upkeep.
---
Yeah thats been the goal. Ive been at zulrah for some essentials aka blowpipe but going to do till i get serp helm and then ill move over to sara and started doing dks with some people in the cc im in to help them with the archers ring (which i need one as well) and berserker ring.
---
Same here. I'm planning on taking the choose your own Slayer task Relic and choosing only tasks in the Catacomb of Kourend. The Catacomb effect and the Prayer Relic should make it so I can leave Protections prayers on permanently.
---
How does it feel being a god without its powers?
---
I think they said this was engine work on a past Q&amp;A, the chatbox is only made to display one specific-sized icon atm. But I would like that too.
---
Outside of speccing, pretty much never. Only against an enemy with ridiculously high def stats, and in those cases you'd want to spec its def down anyways.
---
Already found a way to smuggle OURSELVES to Varrok
---
Well yeh if you're going for max the prayer option is a clear and obvious choice. It's a guaranteed way to accelerate that skill and automate it. Essentially a bone crusher on crack.
---
Run energy is the noob/lazy perk. Useful early game and always active but doesn't really speed anything up in long term. 
---
Ammunition one is for those planning to pvm and grind slay. Same as when they get to the tier where they can choose their slay task. Someone maxing will go for the farm one most likely.
---
We’ve gone full circle from rs3=bad to bad=rs3
---
There are some very niche circumstances in Cox I think where it’s better. But berserker is almost always better.
---
Believe so, yes
---
Yeah that too. Didn't think about that.
---
tiramisu tuesday
---
Library is best magic xp/hr (aside from chinning), and you can do broad arrows/bolts ez.
---
Solo Cox is pretty much the only place where endurance is actually a good perk choice.
---
what are some big clan chats for just chatting about osrs?
---
It applies to all mining xp
---
Would be easier just to make a ornament kit tbh
---
third party clients have lots of useful plugins
---
the most popular one currently is runelite as the other commenter said
---
you can get 20% in any house after the client of kourend quest.
---
They are the same thing except blood is thicker than water.
---
I guess I should've just tried running through the door while it was open, idk. :D
---
I just kinda panicked in the moment and decided to swap worlds haha
---
Yah took me 47 for first and 65 for all reeeeeee
---
everyone who is serious about buying a print, message me :)
---
Hp regen means no food is needed whatsoever.
---
Mage training isn't even a debate. Arc library is by far the best way to training magic and is way better with the run energy.
---
That's one hell of a saying there.
---
Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about.
---
Cya later virgins
---
Don’t feel bad, same clan got me today...
---
memes are cool but will the other two relics get something extra? As useful as they are, infinite stina is a must have in a place with limited teleports
---
except there are irons who play bounty hunter legit and build specifically for that.
---
This is dope
---
I thought only certain rewards were tradeable.  i dunno, I'm not a great source of information
---
Did you get scammed?
---
You can get stams by giving Dr. Jekyll a torstol.
---
You’re supposed to do whatever you find fun.
---
In my opinion all rewards should have been untradable
---
Why you lying man you can only keep 1 cape untrimmed, you can't buy an untrimmed cape if you have a 99 already. Unless you mean on a second account...
---
Hello Peter Griffin, joke explainer here, the meme you saw here is about how people get bored and examine the npc, not about missclicking! Thanks for stopping by Peter Griffin's joke explaining emporium, and have a nice day!
---
there are quite a few maxed obby maulers out there with 1 atk 99 str
---
I've been playing rs for 15 years, but only recently decided to give osrs an honest try and honestly, this is where i'm at, cluelessly having fun and doing very inefficient things, and it's a fun experience. I went straight for 99 firemaking, and then, against my friend's frequent suggestions, went and got full void, cuz I wanted it. It was the total opposite of efficiency trying to get void when I can barely keep my activity meter up (splashscape ftw) to earn zeal, but I loved it.
---
But my inventory slots 😭. You're right though makes sense. Do you recommend a staff at 60 att?
---
How long that take?
---
I'd disown you for that tbh
---
Yup. Literally thought I’d ask on reddit for a good friends chat.... that was all my gp and now I have no motivation
---
What's twisted league
---
Hey, it me!
---
Try morrowind
---
Trust no one and you'll be okay in this game. You can still have friends and all that but dont trust anyone.
---
Keeping capes untrimmed by telegrabbing is nothing new.
---
However i couldn't find this experiment on what happens if you level due to that telegrab anywhere.
---
I don't want to wait a fucking week to get 15% to steal from the damned fruit stall...
---
i kind of agree, mostly to flex the cosmetics on my pure, but i can think of reasons they are better left tradeable.
---
I've got it set to mos'le harmless for harmony island herb patch, I really never use it for anything except that and clues.
---
This was literally me yesterday lmao
---
8??? Why
---
Can always do another skill and come back later to it.
---
Only for league specific rewards (pet carry over, rank display, that ugly ass trophy that I'm surprised passed while ancestral failed).
---
Any of the main game rewards are tradeable. Play on an alt. Buy the rewards. Trade them across.
---
Just fyi the smithing grind (I used one lamp from client on it) to steel axe is only 28 copper, 28 tin and like 40 iron
---
okay, but that's your fault cuz i also commented and told you what to do to not get scammed.
---
FM was the first 99 I got, through Wintertodt, and it ruined my love for the game.  Haven't really played since.
---
I never said what he did was a useless waste of time, I simply stated that there is more to life than just this game.
---
Takes days to get. Will probably be 50-200m
---
Glitch hunting in Halo 2 was like that. Just going through these crazy motions spread by word of mouth to see how far out of the invisible walls we could get. It was an adventure, and as a kid it felt like we were doing groundbreaking stuff finding all these secrets through custom game surfing.
---
True I forgot about library. That's definitely a solid use case and is probably one of the early things I'll do. Cheers :)
---
think it was originally to prevent people from ddosing world servers to kill pvmers, then logging in and taking their items.
---
Yeah have to do that for house pool but that's not viable for raiding.
---
I go to ogres at the combat training camp
---
I’m the only one of my mates that still play, it’s just sad to see such pathetic little shits scam for enjoyment in their life. I simply don’t want to start from scratch again haha
---
Depends what you aim for. The Treasure Seeker seems to be there for shits &amp; giggles, DPS relic will surely benefit slayers and ppl who will go for CoX. For plain skillers, the WT perk might be pretty good, since it gives so much resources (was it 4x with that perk?)
---
Then again I don't think there are many people who actually enjoy wintertodt.
---
That would make sense
---
Getting a PHd isn't hard you just have to complete all 6000 steps.
---
How much was it if you dont mind me asking
---
I tried to explain this as if I were explaining it to a five-year-old and even that was not enough. I give up.
---
&gt;you can play both game modes on the same account
---
WE KNOW, THIS ISN'T THE PROBLEM.
---
Just did regicide last night for the first time, this was my exact reaction
---
Yeah was gonna say haha I didn’t get a message from you, is there literally any legit fcs anymore....
---
I only have one account, and it is iron :X
---
but good to know :)
---
Twisted horns are tradeable, and that seems to be all they want.
---
fuck sonic. wont watch it.
---
I don't think there's a way to 100% combat boosting, but I do think it should be made harder. I think restricting purchases with bh points to cosmetic only on Ironmen would fix the integrity issue with iron boosters, since there wouldn't be a way to 100% stop them otherwise.
---
How is this a whoosh lol
---
Not at all, it was 50m rs3 to 9.4m oldschool which is a lot of money to me
---
Event rpg from diango, 3t wep with no stats
---
If you don’t care about efficiency just do whatever you feel like
---
I've never played an iron man and am loving playing this while i fish karambwans for 99 cooking on my main
---
Just another day on the 405.
---
Whip -&gt; chaotics was the general way to upgrade back when t80 was released, but even with the upkeep, chaotics were just so vastly better than whips that it became a must for PvM in order to compete at things like GWD.
---
Also, like someone else pointed out, people tend to forget that RS3 isn't just some new game that came out when EoC did. Its economy is almost 20 years old, and that's a REALLY long time for items to come into the game (and items come into the game way more often than they're lost, especially higher-value stuff).
---
not really a fair comparison tho considering 1M gp is the equivalent of like 40 cents
---
gratz brother, thats probably the first master obtained so far, too
---
I want them all
---
A hole is a hole

If only one “conductor” leads the train and everyone just throws their alts on it, this could work.
---
youtube in your username btw
---
You can do it with 0 decently well
---
Screw it I’m gonna make a new account I miss those days
---
So if I get a kodai wand on day 60 I can use it for two days? All my progression I will make in the coming two months on skills will be gone? So this mode is actually only for competitive players  who are trying to reach first place or casual players who enjoy it?
---
I'm completely and utterly new. I haven't even done the first quest because I literally have no clue what to do so I just run around and cut wood. Help
---
J1mmy cc best cc
---
Can you steal it when it hits the end and turns around? Lol
---
Well, the stats are reset for the account on which you played Twisted Leagues, but if you obtained any pet during the game mode, those will transfer to the next League.
---
why do you even care lmao
---
Get a slayer staff and set crumble undead on autocast. It's easier than just click on crumble undead then on the minion. 
---
how did you die during acid stage, did you try to practice the woox walk?
---
This is like the tenth post I've seen of people blaming Jagex for a runelite issue
---
I think its fucking pathetic.
---
Call me when you've been training range and/or mage for a while.

This message brought to you by the 85% ammo saving gang

The guy in the picture apparently just plays Barb Assault now because you get no xp
---
I don't do this with other styles, I'm still very much learning and developing my craft. I've painted on and off for the past 4 years and I've only finished 11 paintings. this is number 11. 
---
I like this style because i don't have to make things look "real", and I can just focus on creating my own version of the world. Plus mixing paints to create realism is a pain in the ass. I like keeping it simple and fun
---
It can be more than 15x if you choose the right relics. You can get up to 80x for prayer and 20x for everything else. Granted those numbers are once you've been playing the league for a long time and unlocked more relics though.
---
Yes. To all.
---
Idk, probably because it's funny?

Runelite is free
---
I’m playing it for the fashion scape rewards in the normal game
---
Exactly, I just wanted to level up and have fun. I didnt know much about maximizing for xp, there were barely RS guides around (even Youtube was a new thing then!), the only Wiki that existed was wikipedia, so much of what you did was look at the highest level equipment you could make and make it.
---
In my case, it seems it was mithril axes.
---
Also I was so happy I could make mithril, it didn't matter much what it was.

So are they all starry night style? May I ask how old you are?

What does it feel like to get your asshole stretched by other men on a daily basis?

I completely forgot you can pick magic xp at the library, yeah run might be a good choice, I haven't even picked mine yet, I've just been training skills trying to decide.

Howard price slapped me in the mouth but kissed it better so I forgive him. Keep killing it j1m
---
I played RS2 for a while back in the day and then when OSRS was released I tried to do it with no guides. But holy Christ the quests are impossible without a guide. I did desert Treasure with 1 prayer and 1 defense and even WITH a guide it took me ages

How long was it down
---
u need 48 hours playtime to play bh
---
What age are you in ?

"The correct one to choose"
