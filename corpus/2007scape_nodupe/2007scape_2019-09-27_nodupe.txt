This is an interesting tears mechanic. I vote that it should be added as a suggestion. Each week as a member, you can only do one of the three versions of tears with these mechanics.
---
I don't care, the difference between master and grandmaster should not be this wide. The quest took me slightly less than 30 minutes with no guide and with a guide it's a 15 minute quest.  Is that a master level appropriate quest? Not at all and it released a BiS str helm from an afk slayer monster.  To be fair this quest was rushed, it's rewards were rushed, and it's content it unlocked were lazy and rushed. Even a 70 combat in a torso and whip would've found the boss fight to be easy and boring.

Burning amulet/44 port always go kbd and work the ladder

Black chins go west to hobgoblins and run around

Graveyard go easy to GWD cave and work the cave

Edge lever go east into resource area (gp) or axe hut (lockpick)

Callisto is the most dangerous by far, your only option is to run straight south

Just reply to one and include the other comment? Wasting my time nerd.

I’d probably sell it while it’s worth 28m lol. Probably gonna be 5m in a week

I don't really get these posts.

People have money they don't need to spend elsewhere, therefore they're a clown for being willing to pay for early access to a new BIS item?

That makes no sense.

Shine a flashlight through the bottom of the trophy in the dark! This makes it hella easy to get a good pic of.

Then it would make no sense slag

There was absolutely no reason to post a pic of yourself at the end, take a pic of the prize and be done with it. Karma whoring cause you're a girl and know this sub is a bunch of virgins who will upvote because grill

just got it
---
this is gold! Well done.
---
Do Hunter. You'll be 60 before you know it. It's ez
---
I mean if I was still in elementary and middle school, I probably wouldn’t care but now that a lot of us a grown up and have lives and reationships to focus on, I would absolutely haaaate having to waste spending time wandering around the most populated area looking for someone that might accept my trade. When the game can just connect us. May be considered ezacape but there were times where I’d sit stagnant not ably to move on with the game or my goals since I couldn’t get what I needed. 8 year old me didn’t give a rat’s ass but 23 year old wouuuld highly disagree.

guessing that's a money maker rn?

Get an abyssal dagger if you can afford it or if you're balling out go for Bludgeon or Blessed Sara Sword

I startee playing from about 2005-2006 and I've never heard be called the rune large before
---
Lol yeah theres literally a discord with thousands of members and the minimum is 7m and some even pay 9m for experienced runners.
---
Also for /u/Zaraffa you can feel free to spreadsheet the numbers, efficient trios are around 11m and efficient 2+2s are around 12m.
---
Most of us aren't 10-16. Sure we whined back then but it was a lot more wholesome back then.
---
I love back in ye olde noob days where I played against the meta for so long. I always wore a rune chainbody even with dragon slayer done, always a rune battleaxe. I had 68 ranged but used blue dhides because I thought it was just color options and I liked blue.
---
I even did RC just to make runes for my own use, I didn't know you could google pretty much anything so I spent a week gathering info talking to people at banks to learn how to get to the law altar and do the quests for unlocking making law runes. I would spend hours making laws the slow way, then burning through all of them doing varrock teleports for mage XP. 
---
I did enough pest control that on my old account I have max PC points without ever having gotten void or even 42 attack, I didn't train attack past 40.
---
I had a white party hat that a friend gave me ages ago when they were in the 100-200m range. Sold it weeks later for some stupid sum of money and years later gambled it all away at the duel arena against other random noobs somewhat in my combat bracket.
---
Chins are. Do you have fossil island unlocked? Birdhouses are great xp and gp. Also do farm runs of ranarrs
---
Also what’s your Qp situation?

I wouldn't say it is, early game hunter is aids tho... look up birdhouse runs, very passive way to get to 80.. But yeah once you're up there I guess Chins are a good afk way to make money. Tbh what I did was grind skills for the diaries... it's a nice mix of Skilling

It took me a while until I actually could see how to kill zulrah and now its incredibly easy to get kills

I guess rule 34 right?

is there a way to check if a certain username is available without having to sign up for members?

The new helm gives you a reason to bring BCP in raids (gives 1 max hit over serp with max gear)
---
Looks like you got yours at last! I’m supposedly picking up mine from Mod Gambit at RuneFest, provided they remembered to bring it! 🦀
---
It is also the responsibility of the defense to prove innocence beyond a reasonable doubt.
---
Saying someone is trolling to discredit them is extremely fallacious. If I were trolling, it would be more outrageous, maybe say something like spaghetti masturbation?
---
And up to what level should I go for str and switch to atk? should I get both to 80? I like these smaller milestones, rather than "go 99 str  and then 99 atk"
---
I thought needles could break for the longest time, so I bought like a thousand of them since they stacked.

Can you imagine being mad about this lol

Tbh, what I did was at 75 attack I got str and def to 90, and now I'm back doing attack because it got annoying hitting less frequently
---
its literally nezzy helm with a mouthpiece give me a fucking break lmao

I remember buying 1 Guthix piece at a time. I remember trading some guy a whole inventory of shit items and some random ass cash stack and full on begging this cunt to sell me the kite, like PLESSSSSSSSEE!@!!!!!!

Couple of years later I was a baller who owned two rune zammy sets when they were 1.8m each and I lent one to an IRL friend who logged 10 mins later. My mum got on the phone to his mum and made him give me it back. Lmao the days
---
Released... to players. Rune items were in game with their weird purplish colour already before that for just jmod's access.
---
"also listening to the community as a whole for their input on how to make the original client much better, thus eliminating the need for any third party software to exist in the first place."  
---
  
---
I think that's pretty straight forward but if you don't think so then I guess I could've worded that better, my bad honestly. But you get where I'm coming from.
---
Holy shit. How can you live being this constantly angry and people for no reason?

Brand new car and already a broken light bulb. Quality assurance level decreased.

I’m still trying to figure out how you fish a rock out of the water with a fishing rod. Thought that’s what nets were for

That’s a classic!

Does anyone know of a guide showing the exact tick your prayers need to be active against Jad? Most of them are just basic prayer switches. I don't quite have the gear and stats for inferno yet, but thought it might be good practice to lazy flick through the fight caves when I get Jad tasks.

No, its not a technicality lmfao, the trident is good on it's own. You were just wrong, it's ok bud.

how about day 2 basilisks? things under 5m in a week
---
The belief is that it is innocent until proven guilty, but it has always been guilty until proven innocent, with the prosecution reinforcing the case for guilt. It has become more true since the technological revolution and social media acting as the judge and the jury before a case is even heard.
---
I don't know what the fuck y'all think you're talking about. 
---
Back in the day, quests used custom graphics *all the damn time.* They made new graphics for new places, new quests, new enemies, new dungeons, new characters, etc. 
---
Did some stuff get re-used? Sure. 
---
But a fuck-ton of new stuff got created many times with many quests. 
---
This blind 'back in the day' nostalgia is completely wrong.
---
Okay and this quest line is one that is done by almost every single person and no GM quest at the end that is actually challenging.  You can literally put a gp value on every BiS item so I dont get that point.  I am talking about how the item is entering the game and seeing as how much harder Zulrah is then killing a regular slayer monster I think my point still stands.   I can buy a Tbow as a lvl 50, does that make it bad because it requires no quests for me?  No, because the content to get it is actually hard and the price reflects that.  
---
It is as bad as people are making it out.  At the very least it could have been a boss or at least a rare drop.
---
Yes they have, and I'm not wanting such a harsh thing for osrs but it shouldn't be how it is now. There should be well defined barriers for these types of things. And since it's been a long standing rule that "using 3rd party clients for an advantage" in runescape is essentially bannable then let's stick by the rules in place on this kind of thing, ya know?
---
no i am talking about in a tribrid fight situatio, and was the whole time
---
I assume burnt food is more liquid than feces but I guess that depends on which definition of liquid and who's feces we're talking about.
---
Derp. I always thought to myself "how the hell do they come up with these names.. sir tiffi cashinn is how I pronounced it lol.
---
Stonks?
---
Any guesses on the jawbone drop rate? Just killed 280 on task, no drop.
---
he can’t get mad if you play on the clock
---
Not sure what you're arguing? Yes zulrah is easy, no its not easier than the new monsters. Also has nothing to do with what you said about irons lmao.
---
All other melee bis comes from non afk methods (tob, bandos, demonics, cerb, zulrah) not sure why you'd add new bis to an afk zzz monster. Things gonna be worth fuck all which adds little incentives for mains to go grind it.
---
and im not sweating 4m i garuntee i have a bigger bank than you if you wanna start flexing lmao
---
I'd get at least 70range before pking. Since you don't need much hp in f2p you could cannon your range to keep your hp low

---
Back in the day, quests were made using custom graphics *all the damn time.* They made new graphics for new places, new quests, new enemies, new dungeons, new characters, etc. 
---
Did y'all even play the game back then? I fiercely remember the wonder of *exploring new places with stuff that had never been seen before.* 
---
As someone that started the game, back then, with getting the Quest Cape as my goal, and had to do every quest as it came along to re-get it, I can say this with confidence. I remeber the cape had just come out when I first started.
---
Obby maul is expensive to use now so (assuming that’s the build you’re going for) it might be worth fighting other obby maulers but make sure they risk the same
---
You would have to be in full magic gear to hit high is what he’s suggesting, so range or melee or korasi would require a full gear swap to be effective
---
Void with blowpipe and salve (ei) will do fine. Rune cbow is doable with enchanted ruby and diamond bolts, but will be harder if yousdon't get lucky specs
---
I thought cannon was members object?

Oh flipping Torg hammers for 10-20k profit.

Lmao fuck em

During the quest Vorkath is a piece of piss. I did it calmly on my btw with 80 range, black d’hide, broad bolts, RCB, glory, barrows gloves, anti-dragon shield, climbing boots, ring of dueling. Bring 1 antivenom 1 range pot 1 antifire, 2 prayer pots, rune pouch w/ crumble undead, and the rest sharks and karambwans.

I got mine in about 3 hours and had never played before, my suggestion is to look up guides for the 4 roles on youtube. I would help but dont think I will be on tonight.

Problem is that if everyone in the group gets a roll, you would have people mass killing bosses for pet drops. What would you suggest to do with this particular problem?

What does this do? 1 hit zuk? Would be way OP

Various clans I’m in were torn between 1/512 and 1/1k although they seemed fairly arbitrary.

Your guess is as good as any. In my experience/opinion perhaps usual time today (end of work day Friday) as they have in the past dropped big news/opinions just before the weekend so that players have the weekend to chat/meme/rage and then ease back into it on Monday.
---
The old "fart in the room then leave the party" tactic. 
---
This is because they are likely to address 3rd party clients which in any case will cause discussions and backlash. 
---
My second best guess is that they'll just roll it into next weeks Q&amp;A, it would be weird to have one on Monday or Tuesday then another at the usual time. 
---
3rd Guess and has only happened a few times in the past few years. A quick Q&amp;A (more of a statement/quick note) on Monday or later today that only deals with 3rd party clients and a few small things like weekly update stuff with the regular proper Q&amp;A at the usual time.
---
The weapons are fine, especially with the nerfs they're introducing. The armours aren't fine on the other hand. Plus, this would be great content for runescape that will attract a lot of attention among other benefits. I'd definitely do wilderness barrows on my HCIM after whenever it dies
---
I died at the part of the quest where you have to fight the green and red basilisks in the town square. I forgot to equip shield once I got in and went afk so I died. Does anyone know how to get my stuff back? I read you can get your stuff back if you die from brundt at the dungeon entrance but when I talk to him all he asks is if I finished the puzzle. Any ideas guys?
---
Just saying any posts will be biased to earlier KCs of course. Tons of people killing it, not many in the game, doubt it will be a good money maker long term. Probably just a decent surprise when you're on task.

I agree, a lot of factors push people away from being social :(

minigames are dead outside of things like Pest Control, there's no real group skilling unless you count bosses like Wintertodt and the only bosses people do is GWD sometimes, corp and raids
---
No it's not a preference thing. It's my eyesight. I can't read any of the text at its current size. Even on desktop I can't use the vanilla client. I have to use RuneLite for UI scaling.
---
Nice
---
what is wmk
---
lmfaooo no I'm sure not!
---
There are other ways to make a game more challenging and adding menus is a really poor way of doing that is my point. I already pointed out volcanic mine, blast mine, and pyramid plunder as good ways to increase the interactivity and difficulty that doesn't involve dumb menu shit. If they need to reduce the xp per successful blackjack to keep the xp/h the same or even more in line with ardy knights then I'm ok with that. I just think it's very poor design and the argument that it's good because it's harder is dumb when it hurts other areas of the game too, like not having one-click banking.

I remember watching the price for a Halloween mask skyrocket. Every time I got closer to buying it, the price would go up. One of the cheapest masks was the green one iirc. And I remember saving up 300k only for this fucking thing to have gone up to 360-400k (pre GE time). I’d like coal for another few weeks. Boom 400k. And it was then 450k at least. Then it went up exponentially. And I never got it. Playing since 01-02 and still never wore one😣
---
Sauce?
---
Ironic, considering that you have no idea either.
---
Ever heard of OpenOffice? A year after Sun Microsystems aquired StarOffice, they open-sourced it, and it became known as OpenOffice. Then in 2010, Oracle bought Sun, and therefore, ownership of OpenOffice. This led to the community making their own fork, now known as LibreOffice, but Oracle still has ownership of the OpenOffice project.
---
Nothing stops Jagex from buying RuneLite and taking over ownership of the project. The only issue is that it would have to remain open-sourced under the BSD 2-clause license, and nothing would prevent third-parties from just forking it and continuing to use the original pre-Jagex version of the client. Needless to say, this would not be a favorable outcome for Jagex, so it's not likely that they would buy the project, but fact remains that it's not impossible like you imply.

Wyverns are different:

1. Wyverns can be killed off task for full drops.

2. Wyverns don't require master quests.

3. Wyverns are more afk.

was it really necessary to be a misogynistic shithead?
---
No I think I'm pretty much just a massive hypocrite who picks and chooses which skills are cancer. I'm already 99 Fletching, I did darts. I also 1 ticked 99 Prayer. I'll end all the bitching and moaning now realizing all of this.
---
Who said I cheat?
---
I agree. At least having it adjustable would be nice, but with the ability to click on the areas between the UI buttons and the edge of the screen.

Wtf rune axe sold for 27m?

FGHJDGHHGK THANKS

"friends" "hacked". Idk whether you can really call them your friends after that, and by hacked, do you mean you gave them your password at some point and they took the opportunity?
---
I was like "Nice a pet! I have mine at 73kc" then I see visage and I am like. "Nice..."
---
the spec should just be on a magic weapon then.
---
this man is t-rex mode. 99 agility?
---
I'm sorry little one
---
I’ve made profit on almost all trips. A lot more people bring noted than you think. Just don’t burn through runes and stick with melee/range. It’s also 100-200k prayer xp an hour to pk out there if you use the bones. It’s how I went from 74-77.
---
i remember when 100k was baller status lol
---
Gee. I understand the appeal of trolling, but imagine how sad it must actually be to write things like that.
---
Yeah this is a good point

I still haven’t worked up the mental fortitude for those but if my sub hadn’t ran out yesterday I’d be doing this one right now!
---
Why would it matter? Jagex takes ownership, plugins that cross the line get removed, and from there on the community has to vote 75% yes or higher before new plugins can be added. And on top of that, it would be possible to actually *trust* that you wouldn't get hacked from using the client, because Jagex would be overseeing everything and ensuring that no code exists within it to steal accounts, and if somehow malicious code made it into the client, it would become Jagex's responsibility and they would restore accounts and wealth much like they have done with the Jed incident.
---
D pick is only 6% faster

I remember getting killed in full rune in the wild thinking I had lost all of my net worth

"I'd trust Adam more than Jagex with game integrity issues at this point lol."

What? Adam is one of the integrity issues.

88% is higher than you should be going if you don't want bolt racks, go for 86.8%.

1 skele 1 big/1 small spider gets you there on the dot, 2 skele 1 bloodworm gets you close and is easy to do.
---
I like just watching people throw shit at each other for aggregious crimes the other side committed when really both sides are doing the same thing. RuneLite has OP plugins just like OSBuddy so if you're gonna get rid of one then both have to go. Otherwise Jagex has to reconcile with OSBuddy devs to approve plugins just like with RuneLite. Either way they're basically the same.
---
I have a feeling that the people complaining about the quest are also the types of people who hold spacebar throughout
---
Back when OSRS came out I cut yews to pay my first bond, things never change

dude, kill chaos druids instead. Lower risk and better money if you're only killing 30 dragons an hour lol

My issue is nothing happens with construction in term of leveling it. You build generally 3-4 things for xp across the whole 1-99 grind. And you just throw everything you build into the garbage.
---
Give me something to do with construction or just give me an npc to dump my cash stack in exchange for construction xp. 
---
It almost feels like construction right now is like the only way to level runecrafting was to pay runners to bring to essence and craft lava runes. Like a whole skill where all you do is stand there get handed things then click through menus is so boring at base.
---
Tldr: I understand the gold sink function of construction, but if there is no other purpose to the training and it is going to be 30x faster xp than other skills just let me hand in gold for xp and move on with my day.

---
I always use chins on jad and I have certainly tagged all the healers just from chins, but it’s definitely not guaranteed. I will just switch to chins as soon as I see healers come and keep attacking jad with chins. Most of them will aggro right onto me and the rest I can manually click.
---
If possible, I’ll then run them to a safespot and kill them. If I can’t do that I’ll just keep chinning them till they die while switching prays on jad. I personally like to kill them so I don’t have to worry about brewing for the rest of the fight UNLESS they heal jad to full, in which case I’ll leave one alive. If they heal him to full and you kill all the healers they will respawn.
---
Try to focus on improving something each time you try instead of just focusing on the big goal of killing jad. I failed a bunch and got to a point where I just said “I know I’m going to die, lets just treat this as a practice round and try to at least tag all the healers.” That took a lot of pressure off and the first time I went in with that mentality I killed him. 
---
Good luck! I love silven’s guide on YouTube. He also has an unlisted video that’s helpful for training. And definitely turn sounds on if you haven’t already. Helps you get in the rhythm of switching.

He must  have gotten a few imbued hearts from superiors
---
Wouldn't it just be one more model for each of the creatures, not 2 more? But with how all out they went for Kebos, it was a shame they couldn't fit in 4 more models for superiors (or even do recolors like they did for the original superiors) and weren't interested in adding them post-release either. Superiors are kinda a standard part of the skill now so it feels lacking whenever you have a creature that doesn't have superior.
---
Classic WoW is the best possible example and the two games are set to compete heavily over the next year. It's accurate to say that Blizzard was inspired to make Classic WoW because of OSRS, and now the question is which company will be able to put out a better legacy version of their online MMORPG.
---
I play OSRS nearly every day and I can admit to feeling a really strong pull towards classic WoW. I'm dying to give it a try, but it's even more money per month than OSRS is and I'd have to start fresh when I already have an OSRS account that I put a lot of time into.
---
Oh yeah no worries haha, it's just that people are very defensive about being a veteran of RS, so you commenting that "you've been playing awhile" offended them. Some people have been in here since release of classic, and possibly 1 person on this subreddit played deviousmud
---
Depending on how you look at it, it is actually a *good* thing that these client "vulnerabilities" are being exploited in the public eye. This forces the issues to be confronted and for yagex to find a solution that will maintain the integrity of the game.
---
The alternative is that a select few, with the skill/determination to reverse engineer code, would be taking advantage of the loop holes any way. If im not mistaken, before this pvp clans were doing some questionable things with private clients.
---
Well he knows his RSN now sooooo

you too

‘Total level worlds’ are you’re best bet to get away from them. Get 500 total by lvling up skills where bots aren’t affecting your xp rates.
---
If you really want to do mining I suggest alkarid mine 3-spot. There’s a scorpion there which will attack you if you’re a low level but it’s possible to trap it on the rocks you a mining by dragging it north a little then running back to the rocks
---
Damn, two of those sound like they would have been right up my alley, sucks that I missed it. Nice job on The Eight Clans though!
---
you use it to get into waterbirth dungeon during the quest while you're an exile so yes you can

Lmao did you flex on your recruiter?

Yeah, I tried mixing the glass with my fremmenik Arctic pine shield for half an hour because its got the same damn name as the other fremmenik shield
---
I spent weeks mining gold from the dwarf cavern place so that I could save up the 3m required to buy an Abby Whip. Those were the days
---
Man, back then I was so glad to have 1mill. I remember when the Granite Maul was released, I used all my gold to buy it (it was approx 950k+ on release) and I went to go PK and forgot to have protection prayers on. Sorry 13 Year old me.
---
Which version of Brandos?  I like the Coke one but dislike the Nike version.
---
Have you tried collecting the sticks?
---
so uh.. next question, which of these pictures has a bicycle present?
---
*[sweating profusely]*
---
It is a very peculiar sub at times hahah
---
I did a post a while back about fly fishing bots near barbarian village. 4 characters with similar names with just numbers changed and nothing happened.
---
What do you mean? how should i collect them?
---
yeah its messed up lol
---
plot twist they were bond nests
---
but when Adam says the same thing an hour later it's not wooosh anymore amirite?
---
I mean both scythe and tbow fall into that category. Doesn't mean anything.
---
Huh?? Level of monsters is unrelated to how fast you gain experience. And the travel methods to said areas take time and are risky so you cant bring max gear or a cannon so its worse than convential slayer for exp, I have no idea what you are going for here, elaborate please.
---
What really pisses me of is know i know why gubbiesmrs009 is taken i really wanted it and its wasted onna bot
---
That’s the point
---
I’m dead
---
Kurasks... i know its not any good in comparison with the other money makers around, but i just enjoy it far more than anything else.
---
woah.... just... just take it easy, man, no need to start preaching in the comment section of a meme

&gt; There was supposed to be a very rushed combat update that was beta tested and scrapped because hardly anyone liked it.

After all those kills? Wow that’s crazy
---
How is your max hit in Bandos only a 25? wtf?

I see gigachad i upboat

I started osrs with like 80m cause I swapped. Get called a cc noob alot lol
---
R/washingmachine 😂😂 cring normiebget woshed

This makes me livid.  If we can't have customer support nobody should
---
I think I have probably had over 2k hours in just picking flax. Now when I restarted playing OSRS I just bought all my gold and it wasn’t as satisfying to be honest
---
I assume it’s 1/508 on task so I’m not surprised... probably similar to wyrm drops
---
Be safe kind soul
---
Higher level higher hp, ok, but higher defences, so its slower experience. I thought that was a given.
---
You can do well yes, but you DO better with full gear, what is stopping you from doing said greater demon task from a normal slayer master?
---
And I am not debating that slayer is quick at lower levels, I am debating if slayer in the wilderness is faster than normal slayer masters.
---
ps. 1-32 is nothing special from one gigantic task such as greater demons, I have no idea what you are aiming here for.
---

They hated him because he spoke the truth.
---
Haha dude. Please go check your facts before stating something as silly as this.
---
You can't even access the area they are in if you haven't done the quest.  The faceguard doesn't drop from normal Basilisks.
---
Figured this out when watching Slayermusiq's quest guides as he pronounces it as certification lol
---
Do people who like short quests hate questing or something? Like quest was basically one mini favour with little interaction between the fremmenik people, a small battle and boss fight thrown in. They literally just threw in SotE's mourner fight. 
---
For a master quest revolving around the council i expected there to be more interaction between the fremmenik isles and the council themselves, not go-fetch segments by Baba fucking Yaga and Bruh the chieftain
---
That was before revs and Vorkath even lol so yeah, it's gotta be through the roof now. Also, I heard somewhere that they cancelled the data stream. I've been wanting to know for a while now.
---
It's not the amount of kills I'm mad about. It's the amount of rare and very rare drops I've gotten over the "rare" drop of the jaw.
---
Any idea what level I should do this up to when it would be so much better to do whatever option members have?
---
76 strength, BCP, tassets, fighter torso, prim boots, drag def, ammy of torture, helm of neitz and regen bracelet adds up to 26 max hit.. with Justiciar armor it’s 25
---
Support. Soooo many new mobile players i can lure to their deaths. I would quit my irl job and go full time luring if this passed.

You do understand that's still several hours of game play?

You need to complete it to access the Isle of Stone, where they reside. The jaw is tradeable, however the combined helmet still requires the quest to be completed to wear it.

Thank you, I will my friend :)

"So I took a look at your EHP and uhh... it's been going up. Got something you need to tell me?"

Thats why you dont buy gold, you are skipping the journey for the ending, what good is the ending if you dont know about the journey\`?

Until you can catch the 2nd fish in the barbarian fishing category. Barb fishing is slow if youre only catching the lowest level fish.

My face with a cheese grater. Doesn't make me money but it's the same feeling as playing OSRS.

I have great respect for someone who has a mini bonk moc based after a runescape monster that's wholesome stuff

Im pretty theres a list of names that once you complete fremmy trials, a name will be randomly chosen that the fremmy people will call you. Its different for everyone.

I thought they removed that Sudoku minigame. Pretty dumb they didn't because that was heavily botted in the original game too. I remember doing it.

It won't be on the teleport options until you check the tree. You probably have one somewhere that you never checked

As much as I agree, let’s not forget how much of a huge problem DDoSing was before death mechanics were changed.
---
Or ornament kits from high tier clues
---
Inflation is such an overused buzz word. Most high-end gear is on a downwards trend, not upwards.
---
Yeah, let's see if Jagex has a statement out by the end of 2027. As far as PvP clans goes, I remember a client called Exilent that did that but apparently the person who made it was notorious for DOXing, DDoSing, etc.
---
Man, I remember being 53 combat and killing level 2 goblins because I thought they were good money, when I got my mithril platebody I was the boss.
---
For afk fishing trout and salmon fish xp rates are compairable if not better than member afk fish rates. Also drop your fish, and get cooking up by fermenting wines. 
---
Maybe get some skills up and look into a members money maker to make more than a bond worth of gp before your first bond runs out. I suggest buying that first bond with irl money.
---
They're stealing our jobs.
---
I tried to play without buying gold but I just don’t have the time to play it that way. I may have an extra hour or two to spare every few days and if I didn’t buy gold I’d never get anywhere. I also don’t have any friends that play so buying gold is the only way I can do many quests.  It’s just a catch-22 because buying gold kind of ruins the fun
---
Used 151 super restores and 3,231 Rune Knives in max range gear. Took roughly 13 hours with a few breaks for food.
---
Ouch
---
Are you ok? Do you need to go to the hospital?
---
Huh, just seems low to me. What weapon? Whip? 
---
Also you put BCP and Torso in your comment. 
---
I have a max hit of 24 with:
---
Zerker helm, Fighter Torso, Rune def, Rune boots, Fury, and Barrows gloves. Using a Dscim.
---
I have 83 str tho.
---
Grim Tales is my favorite quest ever

I'm a hoarder and had one for some reason. Ran all the way to bardur making a few wrong turns and after about 10 minutes in the DKS cave got to him. Then... He told me to go fuck myself because i already had a shield. Mfw
---
No, the second person interviewed clarified they earn between 5-7k a week. 6k average x3 weeks is 18k a month and 216k a year.
---
No but not every player has max gear, its non degradable, and when they add the next new bis item it likely will give a max hit
---
I would cum inside him

My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer.
---
Nope, 5-7k per month, watch it again
---
So you decided to steal it back from other people? lol
---
Or do konar. And only skip the metallic drag tasks. Or do low lvl slayer and at every bonus slayer points do konar or neive. To get the huge slayer point drop.
---
Why is your prayer icon golden?
---
People get so focused on the technical aspects of a job interview that they forget there's also the 'I want to hire someone I could actually put up with as I spend more time with them than my own family' aspect.  Taking an opportunity to just talk some shit as it comes up will make you stand out in an interview, good shit my man.
---
Kind of a sketchy monster, comes in at slightly more GP/kill than Gargoyles but less than half the Kills/hr because of its stats. The Jaw would have to make up 4.5k/kill for the mob just to be comparable to Gargoyles in GP/hr.
---
Perhaps even $12?!
---
Hero
---
So buy bonds and spend 200 instead.
---
I’m starting on Monday! And in most cases I wouldn’t say that honestly, but from the interview, I thought we hit it off well to use some casual lingo. It was something I was hesitant of, but I was also hesitant to even do the P.S. at all.
---
It was super condescending so why the hell would I take other part as being genuinely friendly. Thats some really odd "friendliness" you're showing there. You're a weird dude.

I'm not familiar with Java or applets, can you tell me the basics of how loading a config can result in loading the actual client? I also don't understand how people figured out that the config file was public and available in the first place.

Dragon crossbow has a negligible difference over rune crossbow if not using dragon bolts. Absolutely not worth the upgrade unless doing bosses/higher levelled stuff

---
I could be wrong, but I really don’t think anyone on f2p would have the same build but with 26 more range levels as you.
---
Can’t cannon in f2p, so they’d be getting HP the whole time. 
---
Only way I see you running into a build who has that big of an advantage over you would be if they trained range as a member with a cannon, and then decided to f2p pk.
---
Solo raiding. Olm is a complex af boss so it's fun to deal with the different mechanics, the rotations keep it fresh, and doing it on my own means I can go at my own pace to avoid getting burned out.

This guy is such a liar, he obviously got it from Runecrafting.

Omg you really are a pretentious fuck arn't you. Do you spend all your energy going around looking for shit to be offended by. So ill take it back. You can fuck off you brainwashed cunt. Learn to thibk for yourself. Check facts and deduct your own conclusions. Stop being a sheep that parrots the hivemind. You look stupid as fuck.

Yeah, down here in the south everyone says it like a double conjunction, wouldn’t’ve, which of course would be silly to type. Sounds more like “wouldn’t of” than “wouldn’t have” it’s a *very* common mistake in writing nowadays, especially in the south.

Not quite. Anyone can be recorded, but you must be activated *before* it tracks exp for you. Whatever you have prior to activation is ignored.
---
Of fuck of rebeca he did not say that
---
He didn’t compare playing the game vs hitting the game. He compared playing the game with designing scripts and bots for the game. And it’s practically guaranteed that a subset of people actually prefer programming over playing runescape.

You’re looking at it as a job though, which it isn’t. I’ve been inside one of those botting discords before and most of the botters there are high schoolers who were bored on the summer break. Cashing out 5-7k a month is a great side hustle for them.

Well you do get more xp for higher hits. You don't get more xp per monster. Increased xp is xp/hour, not xp/kill.

50% of WHOLE playerbase(which consists mostly of f2p plebeijans who can't even afford bond) or just p2p? Personally in the latter case I'd argue majority for a fact has acquired 10m

As I said, I tried IE. I'll try the latter.

If you didn't read I'm full maxed and have completely stopped playing. The only time I play is on other peoples accounts and that's generally to pk. PvM is so fucking boring that out of the 75 people on 2.2k aus world yesterday about 40 odd were afking the new basilisks. Pking is dead because if you're not in a team goodluck pking anywhere but PvP worlds, not even 2.2k is safe from teams.
---
Jagex SHOULD fix their game.. It's THEIR game, they develop it.. It's THEIR job.. I'd be more inclined to develop a bot that wouldn't be banned and make money than to develop solutions to their problems. With that said it's more than just the usual problems, it's the devs and the community ultimately fucking this game. I can't come up with a solution to their inability to hire more people and more competence along with it. I can't stop the botting are drop kick community that is a majority of OSRS (in my experience). Even people who aren't toxic towards me are still toxic as all fuck towards others and that doesn't make it okay.
---
LMS is a great example of incompetence from the Devs and just flat out Toxicity from the community. The Devs should have known it would have been botted to shit but gave absolutely 0 fucks and pushed it out without prevention as well as not learning from their prior mistake and not having combat styles revert back to what they were before entering the minigame costing people their pures once again. Then there's the community who (ironically) killed LMS for a lot of people by botting absolute fuck out of it, I say ironically because it actually made  games faster to get in to while at the same time killing it. You say to give Jagex solutions? Easy, throw on a total level requirement, combat level requirement (low but still prevents level 3's and slows botters ever so slightly) and then monitor it and ban any main botting it for the first week or two and go from there, done, easy. Instead we got "hur.. here's dis update hur.. bots flooded it already... hur"
---
Pugger realized he got a heap of views with his first bot video instead of his pking videos that every does.
---
So now he's just literally advertising bots.
---
More amateur botters/shitty botters just means more cover for the top tier ones.
---
He's milking this just as hard as these botters IMO.
---
What made you decide to change the account? What are your stats now?
---
no for some reason it didn't count 1 kill and thougth an ametyst bolt got dropped by one
---
The volume for the voices is off because I adjusted my settings while recording. I had the volume record maxed out because whenever I uploaded the audio to my video software it came back kind of quiet. So I maxed it out but I’ve been listening to recent videos and I can hear static/background sounds so I adjusted it part way through this video to 90%. It’s still sort of quiet but I don’t hear the hum anymore. I’ll need to re-record the countdown numbers now too. I was hoping no body would really notice! I’ll try and make it less noticeable in my next video. Thanks for the feedback!

It will drop its rock if you hit the rock with a slinger shot

why's that? it's talked about a ton : P on a serious note though, it's just another runelite fork that has features that won't be added to runelite.

Bandos item pog
---
When you reach the higher levels, you make enough money to sustain bonds and slowly upgrade your gear. If you want to grind, you can upgrade pretty fast. 
---
For example a black demon task, I just kill however many skottizo i have totems for and head to gorillas. Gorillas are like 25k average, without the 1/300 zenyte drop which is 10/11m. So i basically make 2m per task with supply count and every second task or so I pull an extra 10m.
---
Kurasks give me roughly 1m per task, haven't had gargoyles in a while but similar profit, necryarchs, dust devils pay less cause I burst them but they're great xp and decent money. Brutal blacks/weyverns are also nice. I'm only 86 slay and havent yet had an abyssal demon task bu I assume both them and kraken are pretty good.
---
Alternatively, if I really need the money I can go kill vorkath. A single kill is 140k average its very consistent money.
---
If you want an advice, just play and progress in the game, money isn't all that needed unless you want the top tier xp rates in everything and if you can't afford something you'll be able to afford it later. Money eventually comes, especially if you pay the 11$
---
You don't have to sit. Or play for 8 hours. As for the screen, I'd think that most people would watch TV or use the computer when they're sick. 
---
It absolutely does not reflect poorly to play video games when sick.
---
For hopefully a little bit of reassurance, I didn’t do *anything* I used to do after I graduated. I didn’t pick up a game I liked for a year and I’ve only just got into OSRS in the last month. Time after graduation is brutal so best of luck to you, friend!
---
trash fashionscape though
---
The fucking cameltoe... wow
---
not even, one dude in rs3 had over 10T by himself
---
Yep, it seems like a mix between x-log and proper log, in part caused by the mobile client interpreting the game state as properly logged out while not checking with the server if the server thinks the same.
---
Green dragons
---
I had to double check if this was real. They ruined the neitiznot. One of the games most iconic items...
---
When I became a member in 2007 with a 200k bank and saving up for a g maul I picked up a Santa hat at a drop party worth 22mil. I now understand why most lottery winners go broke.
---
Lol youll get bored of it in a month tops. Unupdated games die. There was a time where osrs was in its "Dark ages" when the game was not updated for a year+
---
A day of slayer is usually what gets me a couple
---
I killed galvek with 75 range, you should be able to kill him.
---
You'll need good range defence so use karil top + barrows tank gear over dragon hide. You will absolutely need Ruby bolts e for the first 3 stages, diamonds for the rest. If you have money to spend, dcb with dragon bolts (Ruby/opal). Pray range mage for stage 1 and 2 which are very easy, pray range for 3 and 4. You'll need bastion potions, Sara brews and restores. Off the top of my head inv should be diamond bolts e, bastion pot, range pot, 4 brews, 5 restores, rest shark/mantas with karambwan combos. Utilise shark -&gt; brew -&gt; karambwan combo eats as much as you can to minimize healing time. In the first 2 phases don't heal to full all the time because Ruby bolts will just hurt you more.
---
Phase 1: stay in the middle, use Ruby bolts. When galvek shoots the death ball up, run at least 2 squares away, I ran 3 to be sure. Don't run into bombs on transition to p2.
---
Phase 2: not much difference to p1, but you have more space and need to restore stats a few times.
---
Phase 3: zoom out all the way, turn auto-retaliate off and pray range. Stand in the middle of the ship. When galvek spits the fire ball, move 2-3 squares. When he spits blue stuff, look on both ends of the ship for the waves and move to the row that's clear of waves. Auto-retal can pull you into waves if it's far away from galvek. 
---
Phase 4: move to a far end of the ship (near your crew or where galvek was phase 1) and turn off run. Keep moving and damage galvek down with diamond bolts. If you stop moving you can get hit with the rock tomb attack which will prob kill you.
---
Good luck.
---
Maybe.. I don't know...
---
I still have fun with the game.  I don’t follow twitter osrs or content creators social media, etc.  Really just this sub and cheeky YouTube videos, it’s a good time.

HA!

RC = Good after all.

Maybe you should just get someone with lower combat stats than you. I tank at Bandos with a group of 80-90 attack/strength while I have 99 both yet I still get most of the kills. Maybe you should buy a rapier instead for that large accuracy bonus.
---
**\*GONK\***
---
cool its Ho-oh
---
I guess I shouldn't complain about the quest it was okay, just far too easy and short but lore was good.  As for the jaw the things gonna be 2m in a few weeks, a BIS helm shouldn't of come from an non interactive afk slayer monster. Lets hope something doesn't replace the whip or the rapier in the exact same way.
---
That doesn't matter much at all to competent hiring
---
66.6666667 should round up to 67 though
---
Only range and defence are relevant in the caves. I got my fire cape and 80 range as well.
---
U can buy your stuff back for 50k at brundt (cave entrance)
---
If you’re in a bit of a financial state, shouldn’t you maybe not be playing video games whilst at work?
---
I always laugh when people who buy bonds/gold lie instead of just admitting it.
---
i did get my core till 1500 kc :/ then i got 5 more by the time i got pet at 2789kc, youll get there! boring grind though
---
Chances are they might be on the same account with their parents with a different card and they just pay back what they borrowed
---
That might've been me. Back around 2006ish I used to afk yews in class and lost my daxe head from it.
---
griefing? dood the quest was just released, every respawn spot is hogged by atleast 2 players
---
Farm runs would pay for a bond in less than a week if you did like 3-5 runs a day.
---
Lmao
---
check out his video's prior to the one you've just watched. You can clearly see that he genuinely exposes them. I would find it hard to believe this one video would be different. Change my mind
---
Funny joke
---
Funny comment. Lol
---
WhAt Is RuN eScApE?
---
You really explained it wonderfully. On a typical day, I would get off of work, do my dailies for moneymaking, then go to bed. I genuinely enjoy just training in this game
---
Its a total estimate, its probably sightly more, but not by  much. 
---
16% str would be literally x1,16, but the accuracy would also add up too sightly, but that's a more complicated factor to pull out of my ass.
---
What can you use the heads for?
---
Couldn't log out? :/
---
Ah I see, I meant more that the task being 750k-1m rather than the jaw, I know that would sit around the 5m mark minimum but if it does drop to that and the activity is still only 1m/hr then I'm sure it would be a good place to have an afk alt like at gargoyles or rune dragons. Would you still feel this is undervalued at this time? Or is it simply a "if it can't somewhat compete with zulrah it's undervalued" mentality?
---
Put a Fleshlight on your dick and stand in front of it and take a picture.

Overused meme
---
Das good shet
---
Well that’s not true, fighter hat gives +acc
---
haha 
---
Also that runecraft level 🤑🤑🤑
---
You can do a lot of methods at zurah.  You can mage/range void switch with capes if you aren't comfortable with a 4 or 6 way switch, if you are comfortable with more switches bring the highest level range/mage armor you can afford.
---
Juicy af!
---
Slayer
---
no.
---
nice
---
By cracking me up lolol
---
Is there anyone that actually talks to people and can explain how I got banned while I was doing a quest.
---
Gratz on the Kalphite princess drop.
---
thats wild lmao
---
11/10
---
Over 1.5k KC right now with like 400 being on task. Not a single jaw.
---
Thank you all for adding it!!! I've never been more happy or excited in my life! And I'm glad you like the little fella ^u^
---
I always go into the shield of Arav chat and go into the rp world reppin Phoenix gang
---
i crai ever tim
---
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work.
---
Yes postponed it to have it later this week when they have it ready. But they getting off work in 4 hours so false promises again I guess
---
Wc stands for ‘with card’
---
The ultimate flank
---
will i keep the mage arena cape II under 20 wilderness if i die skulled?
---
Awesome account! If you're not currently in a cc, feel free to join Pure Crew, we're all high total pures :D
---
And some players too, considering some people are willing to quit entirely in case Runelite isn't allowed anymore.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
BTW: Is there an ETA for the statement?
---
🍌 gang rise
---
The ring of ?vigour? Is what made it so op imo. Allowing you to korasi +claws/ags spec. It wouldn’t be that wild on osrs imo
---
Arnie never held the record, he was primarily a bodybuilder not a powerlifter. This is just referring to his own personal best lift
---
Cml?
---
This is excellent. I had a similar situation at an interview where the CEO asked why there was lots about mortal Kombat on my CV. I told him how passionate I was about the game and expressed how I like to participate in tournaments etc. The rest of the interview we talked about our favourite characters then he offered me the job!
---
It's stupid that the drop rate is influenced by whether or not you're on task. I get that certain drops are locked behind boss variations of monsters, such as the Alchemical Hydra. But I feel that the drop rate should be the same. Cave Horrors have the same drop rate of the black mask whether you're on or off task.
---
Ah yes, I remember the bullshit grind of getting full dragon (g). Much bullshit, should've skipped it with irl money.
---
Hey dumbfuck this wasn't a grandmaster quest unlike DS2 and SOTE
---
yeah, I've been doing them religiously along with the rest of my farming :)
---
word, I'll keep at it. Once i get near 99 I might change it up.
---
I hear you but I get a weird little high by escaping successfully. There have been some times when it was clear I was going to get gang banged and I did what you did though
---
Well, I see it like this. If they have to delay the Q/A because of this, no doubt the statement will be controversial with a strong impact.
---
why?
---
So how much was the account?
---
They needle a reason first
---
gz
---
You should have 1 at kc 50. Other than that it's bad RNG. I have 400ish KC and have around 9 or 10 heads
---
That's OK :) 
---
I think it might help your communication to avoid overly complicated yet vague wording.
---
"thats the root of what I was saying, yes. Thanks for trying to understand instead of assuming."
---
I also think it's 1/512 because that is the black mask rate, and the two seem very similar.
---
no 99 ? downvote
---
The big brain response. People dont understand its about the grind.
---
Your xp rates will suffer a bit on mobile. The PC methods use the number keys to navigate dialogue with your butler and give a fairly significant increase to your rates. Using the tap for right click option should help a little
---
&gt;A black hat hacker (or black-hat hacker) is a hacker who violates computer security for personal gain or maliciousness.
---
If you're coding your own botting empire and making 7k a month from it. I'd certainly say it qualifies as it.
---
Not every black hat has to be a l33t h4xx0r that disables a fleet of nuclear subs and goate spams the pentagon or whatever.
---
Hard doesn’t = good content though.
---
For how often they whine they can’t find good rewards for things
---
Im still salty about the dihns nerf.
---
I mean, black d hide is about 20k and gives great stats. Comes from clapping black dragon cheeks, easy.
---
Dihns comes from raids, costa a few mil and takes up both weapon and shield slot.
---
Surely the black dragonhide needs the rework?
---
I mean make people bring Karils into wild if they want that level of protection right?
---
FELLOW HUMAN I TOO ENJOY PLAYING THE RUNE SCAPE. THERE IS NO GREATER JOY THAN CUTTING THE WILLOWS AGAIN AND AGAIN
---
Haha nice.
---
That's a nest
---
Hey, congrats man, that's a great story. Good luck on your new job!
---
I also put something about OSRS on my resume and so far I was asked a few times to explain that part further. One of the interviews resulted in me getting an internship (what I was looking for). I think it is definitely worth putting on your resume, if you can speak enthusiastically about it. It shows a lot about your personality, so it's a good tool for interviewers to judge if someone would be fit for the position.
---
Deleted it cause I didn't think it was being that helpful haha. Can write it up again though don't mind
---
Would u share any of yur strats?
---
How is the value of my gold lowered each day when basically every item is dropping in price, so I can buy more with less gp?
---
gz on your gay marriage
---
How do I make it simpler, for internet communication? Any recommendations?
---
Communicating over the internet is a challenge
---
I agree with this. Makes it totally uncomfortable to grind without task and it's annoying as fuck to cancel your current task to grind them efficiently. 
---
Also wish that wether that's the case that Jagex mentions it rather let us figure it out and wasting unneccesary time.
---
Gratz
---
The real question is how much money can you effectively make per hour? If you can make say 2m per hour and it takes you an extra 2 hours to train this way (this is all hypothetical as I don't know your rates doing this way vs normal) then this would have to save you 4m for it to be worth it. I know that this is a efficiency scape way of looking at things but it's the only arguement I have against your method. At the end of the day it's about enjoying yourself so you do you man!
---
Sorry didn't mean to ramble there lol
---
joke of a company. They’ve had 4 years to “prepare a statement” on this shit, they banned AHK because a couple of people were abusing it yet allow all these ridiculous plugins that save you 3 or 4 actions per click, if they dont ban all the clients or all the features bar harmless ones like ground items/xp tracker ext im done with this game.
---
For what it's worth, that calculator on the side bar of Runelite will calculate your skills and stuff
---
Jagex don't care even if they can catch it. They took years to fix 6 hour nmz afking only after determining they would only lose 2k members which wasn't too expensive. They do not have enough faith in their game to do integrity changes anymore.
---
And the cheat clients get worse literally every day. What was it today, remapped Magic Imbue spot and one click Lava RC? I will be so disappointed if this in an announcement of an announcement.
---
Game integrity is in the bin right now.
---
Fix the cudgel to for the love of saradomin.
---
&gt;When two parties are in a discussion and one makes a claim that the other disputes, the one who makes the claim typically has a burden of proof to justify or substantiate that claim especially when it challenges a perceived status quo.
---
The status quo is that burden of proof lies with the one making the claim, and you are claiming that's incorrect. 
---
For the final time, this places the burden on *you*.
---
You're attempting to shift the burden with a logical fallacy. 
---
Literally just google and read about the burden of proof.
---
Banning all clients is the lowest IQ take possible.
---
I’m a full time student so I have their card for food and gas. Why should I slave away doing both school and work if my parents have the money to feed me lol
---
Not even sure why im being downvoted for warning others and sharing my experience but ok. Im not even asking for money back. Was just here to vent
---
Just curious
---
J-Mods already posted this on twitter before this was released.
---
When I say 24/7 I actually mean the entire time you were in the wildy, not just to prevent getting rushed when they arent fighting. 
---
Maybe you havent pked in that time period but thats completely different to what you are saying.
---
People used to fight with having protect from magic up all the time so you cannot use korasis as a spec weapon.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouI6CxXQYAM skip through this video for example. Most fights you see both people protect from magic.
---
It depends on a lot of things. What are your goals/stats? 
---
Probably the answer is it's wise to keep at least 1m cash handy, and you can power through slayer tasks like kalphite and dagonnoth really nicely.
---
All I have at 131kc is 6 heads haha
---
Maybe leave a comment on his YouTube video? Or @ him on Twitter? Everyone and their mom has a Twitter
---
Doesn't runelite already emulate the default client? Is it really so easy to enforce it?
---
I'm done. You're just arguing bullshit because you refuse to accept you were wrong about whose job it was to prove something. 
---
It was your ability to present evidence that was being called into question from the beginning and you refused to even try. 
---
I can't argue with your stupidity any longer. You're just going to drag me down to your level and beat me with experience. 
---
I won't be responding anymore.
---
You *are* wrong.
---
It used to be that when you died, all your items dropped in a similar fashion to if you dropped them manually. This meant your items became visible to other players after 1 minute, and disappeared after 3 minutes.
---
The new death mechanics have your untradeable items stay in your inventory, and tradeable items are left on the ground for 1 hour before they disappear completely. Items dropped via death never become visible to other players now, so the change removed the incentive for people to DDoS servers in an attempt to steal other players items.
---
&gt;These people don't care for the amount their paying.
---
 That's why they're clowns.
---
just get the require level to afk the skills and afk them on your phone. I graduated like u but I am now trying to reach the afkable point in all the skills besides the ones I cant. It just gives me less time to play more hands on and more time to afk stuff.
---
It's a 20 min quest and only like 15 more mins if you brute force the puzzle.
---
You can run back towards the longhouse to exit the instance
---
Perfect thank you!
---
You're right, I'd have better uses for the money than the clowns
---
Ah yes, the $120 ok joke
---
I absolutely agree and hope there is a way.
---
I got the head in 15 kills
---
But it’s 1/2000
---
Yes. This is not an HD version. I now know where to get the hd version because i asked.
---
Linux support please
---
Quest tiers are based on the -% of players that meet the quest reqs the day it was designed/released

Pm me when I'm online
---
i already had a pet rock so :D im not mad its just some banter, relax lol
---
No u
---
The community is bad at raiding, the people who teach the raiding are terrible and the people who participate in ToB are even worse.
---
I just want clue scroll answers as well
---
he gives you a quest to kill a bunch of random monsters scattered around the game
---
You interviewed this person after seeing him put his osrs name on the resume???
---
I remember one time when I was a complete noob I traded this guy a whole lot of junk and basically begged him to trade me a whip. And he did it. And then I traded that whip for a cannon cus I thought it was cool..
---
Would you settle for a job that paid 5$ an hour even tho you knew you could get a job across the street that paid 150$ an hour?
---
The neitiznot helm is still in the game.
---
Nope
---
Thats not fair lol
---
I never compared spawning Twisted bows to RWT'ing lmfao. I used spawning Twisted bows as an example of something that doesn't happen to MY account, but I'd still care about it lmfao.
---
They both affect the economy negatively, or do you disagree?
---
lmfao
---
Your account probs got hacked by botters so they can bot on it
---
I dont think the majority of people on OSRS need this warning. This post to us adults is the same as reading. "So I know this is stupid but I fell for it... Every since I was a kid I was told to not enter a stranger's van. I was walking down the street and there was this van, some unshaven dide wearing a trenchcoat without socks or shoes said I could have a twix if I jumped in. So I jumped in, got raped and tortured and didnt get the twix."
---
Not sure on the kills per hour. It's a tad better than the west Ardy spot I'd say.
---
https://youtu.be/KY0WB-a8ndk
---
where the hell is all this korasi talk coming from?
---
It would be better suited to a mage weapon tbh, if anything. Rolling off mage accuracy and mage defense of the opponent.
---
If you still have those holiday items they’re going for billions in RS3 which you can xfer to OSRS for at least 200m
---
Fitting that the npc that gave us all hell back in the day is the one dishing out justice. \*applause\*
---
The logic there is not every boss needs to be challenging.
---
This would be cool on top of RGB lighting or next to a glowing PC
---
Ryan celcius. I see you are a man of culture
---
It still mentions key logging in the title lol
---
I think that was the point he was trying to make. r/whoosh
---
Lol, and you called me a troll.
---
well they did say later this week for the announcement... hence the "pushed back to monday" post.
---
Not that big of a deal, but a deadline is a deadline
---
Why does everyone forget bank tags/tabs? Saves so many hours banking in a given month and reduces likelihood of forgetting something important at bosses like spade at barrows or dwh at cox. I'm not playing vanilla without bank tag tabs, it's just too annoying doing bossing without it. My COX tag tab has like 35 things in it from like 7 different bank tabs.
---
What's your gear setup for this and kills/hr? Also good luck!
---
Its a huge deal what are you talking about
---
What in the goddamn fuck
---
hahahhaha thanks
---
Yes, when 80%+, of your non mobile community, uses a client banning clients is a smart decision.
---
Look Lavine, I get that the Neets are super invested and don't care if a large faction of the community flat out quits. But it's a horrible business decision. Co-opting the current OSB drama to another agenda is dumb.
---
Dope vid but terrible music. you have insane rng. Great production on the vid overall.
---
ikr 8)
---
I'd hope not, OSB has done some controversial stuff in the past, like attempts at blackmailing people.
---
A lot have quit, you just dont know what youre talking about. There hasnt been a point in history where more people have quit of dedicated players, despite the player count being higher than ever.
---
Also let me copy/paste what I said to that other guy
---
I didnt quit when MTX was released. I didnt quit when EoC was released. I didnt quit when JageX didnt ban the 100k people botting on iBot with their premium dung scripts.
---
U think i will quit because JageX now allow me to abuse completely broken plugins that will benefit my account immensely? You arent the brightest thinker.
---
Next.
---
Doesn't seem worth it. Inventory space is precious at DKs.
---
It cannot lead to a ban. They have yet to release their statement yet on 3rd party clients. There is a feature osbuddy that is unsafe to use I think, it uses keybindings, or something along those lines.
---
I tried the skybox and HATED it. I like my dark and nonexistent sky.
---
he just gets a lot of birdnests.
---
I'll be blunt,
---
Green drags aren't a boss
---
There is no boss you are anywhere near doing 
---
You should quest most of your combats before starting Slayer
---
In the future you can also complete Dragon Slayer 2 to unlock a dungeon with them in it. Thatll be way down the line for you likely but it's a good goal to set.
---
🦀🦀Contest winners are sent too many rewards🦀🦀
---
Can I have one
---
Without serp? I rest my case
---
Why exactly do you need a letter from jagex? My wife and I met on WoW and we didn't need a letter from blizzard for her K1 visa. She was accepted without a letter.
---
You can boost at 96 for all of them, so that won't be a problem much longer
---
Perfect, thank you. I assume those keybinding features have to activated first? I rarely touch the settings so I think I should be fine
---
They should quit. They shouldnt be playing the game if theyre so dependent on a client, they arent really playing.
---
Bots are also quitting the game because they cant bot. Maybe they will try to play a new account. But player count would be 10 times higher if botting was allowed.
---
So firstly, you a dedicated player, won't quit? (Kind of contradicted yourself within 2 posts here mate).
---
Secondly, your claim that dedicated players have quit en masse, prove it?
---
Obby cape.
---
Combat bracelet.
---
Tassets.
---
Bruh.
---
Must be a data entry job
---
I do believe so, I use runelite myself. Has a few more features than the free osbuddy does.
---
Sounds a bit tinfoil hat.
---
You got 2 some get 0
---
Watch the guides on youtube, I'd recommend the ones by Joseph's Place. Make sure you watch Lord Shayne's guide to defender though, it's the toughest role and way more in depth.
---
Once you've watched the videos you're good to go. Even defender is dead easy and you'll figure it out after the first few waves. It's really not hard, just prioritize making your calls to teammates and you'll be a positive addition to your team.
---
Wait how does one brute force the puzzle?
---
I'd say so... At 75 I have my block list completed, Slayer helm, bigger and badder, gargoyle smasher, and herb sack. 
---
I'd recommend checking out the task weightings for the Slayer master your using, block the high weighted tasks that you don't like and only skip low weight ones. You could also turuael boost , do 9 tasks with him (they're super quick and easy, think ..9 goblins) and then do the 10th with konar for the point boost.
---
the salt is really flowing in this thread
---
  What world
---
Yes and cannonballs are slow xp and profit, hence the comparison
---
PvP player do the same thing so your post is hypocritical
---
Comparing botting to gpu rendering and xp trackers now THAT is negative iq.
---
318
---
Except when Runelite made their Zulrah helper, we were unhappy about it before Jagex made them remove it?
---
stretched more plz, the original client is so tiny I can barely see it
---
So he wanted to look good whilst cutting trees? The armour ain’t even good lol.
---
I would be happy with examine price checker and timers.
---
How many times before u get it into your skull?
---
https://crystalmathlabs.com/tracker/virtualhiscores.php
---
40% of the most dedicated players in the game have quit. 95% are playing less than they used to because of the state of the game. No1 cares anymore.
---
It fits in pretty well on my [knick-knack shelf](https://i.imgur.com/UbbQOtH.jpg) from various travels, but that's a really cool idea, thanks!
---
Shall I make a new mage armour and staff?
---
should go to crushed birds nest lol
---
I'm primarily PvM, but when I vote on PvP things,  I either vote under the consideration of if I eventually get into PvP or if I don't understand something, I just vote Skip Question.
---
Actually completed a quest without a guide and the length and difficulty were good to keep my attention.
---
 Dammit, thought it was a free world for a second.
---
Those are also human error things. You can do manual cast as fast as autocast if we purely talk about game engine limitations (objective stuff) and keep the subjective variables out of this. Replace sotd with kodai and see it that way.
---
Me playing both: 😄
---
All the guys I chill with couldnt care less about pvm updates because we get new items (etc) anyone with a brain woudl realize is mostly pkers that are buying dragon claws,god swords,toxic staffs and pkers want all of this in the game (hence why this all passed the polls)
---
And you expect to get max xp/hr with this gear set up.. come on buddy
---
Regular trees are stupid and expensive. Pre-planting maples for contracts in the farming guild is okay, but I never bothered.
---
Oof
---
what the fuck is this droprate
---
Just to add to 3, elite void range is better dps than Arma when using addy or rune darts, and Arma is better dps when using drag darts. It’s not a big diff but handy to know if going for max dps
---
That is a very nice place, aesthetically.
---
I have yet to see someone only use 3PC for gpu rendering and XP trackers. And I have watched 1000s of hours of YT and twitch content as well as being exposed to tweets and reddit daily for years.
---
Nice cop out. Come again.
---
Type the coordinates into YouTube
---
I know plenty on pker who just vote no.
---
share i tbed
---
I see you logged off, was someone there before me?
---
Hahaha, they need all weekend to plan out how to address this. They know they could fuck up everything if they do this wrong.
---
You twitter virgins with kpop avatars mean literally nothing to the game
---
Goodbye
---
My comment was posted in a perfect world scenario, though.
---
Why would you just assume that? No after seeing so many posts about it I tried it out and like I just never really understood the appeal in it. In some areas it looks ok but in others I think it looks really off putting. To each their own I guess lol.
---
Grimy lookin as herb
---
It’ll be a beat-around-the-bush statement basically saying they can’t ban them because the vanilla client is complete shit but they’re trying to improve it.
---
&gt; we have to use it because osrs client is shit and we need it for graphic/rendering plugins for performance" 
---
Except I do use GPU rendering from RuneLite? It's honestly really good.
---
Add twisted mud pie or we riot.
---
Man one item for one skill sure fucks my argument up good.
---
This deserves more upvotes
---
Theres people that dont get banned for betting too. Doesnt mean they dont enforce it. Just means people slip through the cracks
---
Lol that’s how I make all of my money as a 70cmb
---
You have to be mentally deficient to bot for an income, or just simply have no motivation in life. Why would anybody do that? I understand and agree that his videos promote botting of any kind, however if people are going to bot they will bot. Some people genuinely enjoy playing the game; myself and most players in P2P included
---
&gt; it just makes it so that you can turn off your brain a little bit while killing them.
---
Yes, and the point is that you're supposed to be paying attention. Not every monster is supposed to be AFKable. It's balanced around being relatively high effort, relatively high reward.
---
Stop cheating.
---
My bad
---
dude get ur boss a fire cap youre gonna get a raise
---
get him an infernal cape and youll be co-manager
---
I want idle notifier to stay, otherwise I'll never get the boring skills done.
---
I love hitting 3 30+ in a row then healing on a 9.  Guthans grinds my gears
---
gacha players everyone
---
Is this real
---
With max gear on task, it is the correct rate.
---
Oh 100% my friend.... The name filter is trash.
---
They may not be able to individually detect each case but they can ban osbuddy entirely and have it taken off the internet, ergo fixing everything considering the Runelite dev has always been willing to work and listen to Jagex.
---
This is not true. Many high level players use cheat clients simply because they're undetectable and because people think it's not technically macroing (hence it being an easier pill to swallow than starting up the ol' bot). Not having cheat clients would not kill bots, but it would prevent the thousands of otherwise legitimate players from using these macros.
---
no use of that information anymore lol
---
I was CyouNT, CyewNT, they changed my name to something lamb. Ban for 365
---
*::give twisted_bow* should be the next QoL update
---
Whatever your feeling are on the matter the most important thing is to talk about it, the more people talk about it the more it gets under the skin of the people who are payed the prevent it.
---
You can definitely out damage the healers with blowpipe and dragon darts
---
Hahahahaha OMG that's awesome!
---
Dude getting a devent paying job nowadays is hard af, imagine not having to work? I’d take that.
---
Insane account. Gratz
---
-3 people like gays
---
Nope, because of excessive ddossing, they made it so no one can get items off another by making them dc (unless in Wildy).
---
For clarity, after you die, your items stay where they were for 1 hour. After that they despawn. At no point during that time can any other players see the items.
---
Yeah this is the reason why A Friend was living in Lithuania, he could live comfortably from just Youtube/streaming revenue
---
Gotta have that prayer bonus tho
---
You have to have a firecape to unlock Jad as a task
---
It absolutely *is* true. People have cheated lnog before RuneLite and they will still cheat even if RuneLite gets banned. That's entirely my point.
---
The best thing Jagex can do is ban certain plugins, anyone who wants those plugins was bound to make them anyway.
---
Lol I actually made a joke to my friend about it being like a clickbait ad "Homeless Man Trades For a TWISTED BOW After Starting With Just The Shrimp From The Tutorial Island"
---
we already have the dragon hasta
---
I agree with you but basically no one would do CoX if you couldn't scout
---
What about if I only used the default ones? Surely they follow the game rules?
---
for a start you only need 43 to make waterfall easier. And your getting 70pray first because its something that has to be done anyway, is safest to do at the start of the account and makes a bunch of other stuff easier.
---
There's plenty of hate for boss plugins. It's all information overlays that makes things a lot more brainless but nothing straight cheating. You still have to do the correct movements and prayer switches but you don't have to think about them.
---
No, wildy slayer is faster
---
I know the actual "oakdice" guy is kind of a tool but two guys I know used his site/service and swapped GP with no problems so -shrug-
---
It can. if you are lucky they just cut open the sack and fix the issue. Got tested because the doctor thought i might have it due to extreme pain. most awkward doctor appointment. Testing is basically doctor touching your balls to feel if it is twisted.
---
Hi im the streamer in this deleted clip.  He intentionally didnt include the part that shows me going back up since it was an obvious joke.  I have 4662 pvp kills btw.
---
It doesn’t matter what Runelite does. It’s open source. Jagex can tell them to remove something and 3 minutes later someone just adds it back.
---
I still think it's kinda dodgy he already made two of these "THIS BOT IS LITERALLY UNDETECTABLE, 99s IN ONLY A WEEK 0,1% BANRATE" type of videos. At this point I'm suspecting he might be sponsored by osbot or something
---
*gets fired for botting on runescape*
---
"Dumb cheaters, should've just afk'd here at work like the rest of us."
---
konar
---
the people who buy GP like this barely ever use it on skills, they'll buy full bandos and hang out killing rock crabs
---
I don't care how they play but it's kinda funny to watch
---
Nah, RuneLite is not panicking.
---
r/fakenews
---
Tbh might be worth checking out local quickie job postings too, I made $50 doing yard work for less than two hours once. If you'd feel guilty still using irl money in that case then it's also something you can do for a little extra cash for your family until they stop garneshing your wages. I'm a runescape noob so no idea on that front lol
---
I called pugger working with botters [months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bn3lmr/these_goldfarmers_have_50_million_mining_xp_each/en2ayyu/?context=3), but at this point, I feel like its undeniable he's getting paid off to advertise the bots.  
---
I wouldn't be surprised if he got busted for botting himself at this point.  He's in deep with a ton of botters, has admitted to buying botting software for "research purposes", and makes a ton of new accounts for PKing.
---
It’s funny how we can just slaughter the citizens of any city with no repercussions.
---
Everyone regrets the first time they sold their bank the first time they "quit."
---
Who knew people would push their limits and enable actions that further breed 3rd party client platform into this state?
---
It all starts somewhere, small and innocent, giving people, including jagex, an illusion that is short sighted yet damaging ignorance
---
Thank you! Yeah I don't tend to use any of the advanced plugins, or any of the kind you described. Usually I only use the normal trackers, and sometimes the ones with the little green square to show you where to click. But I cant see those being against the rules
---
That's the point.
---
It’s torvesta
---
It wasn't suppose to be.
---
Oldschool is walking in the shoes of another game called Knight Online. Awesome and amazing game but with severely outdated engine and botted to shit.
---
theyll lose all 7 linux players
---
I'm only teasing by the way :)
---
a lot of people I saw doing things like this would be people who stole accounts and transferred the gold while they were selling the better account the GP was from
---
Though so upvotes for visibility
---
Oh no jagex accidentally put a ~~tbow~~ SOTE award spawn!
---
What an absolute beast. You're account if fire lad.
---
Mad probs 👏👏
---
i would call u a cunt, hop worlds and do the same.
---
Have it... taken off the internet? Do you realize how insane that is?
---
This game is just one big flex
---
lol tfw it was actually true.
---
Unless he is getting paid by them to advertise. I'm not saying he IS, just something others have thrown around.
---
It does seem weird that these people would be so willing to talk to him. Like why would these guys who just made a brand new CoX bot tell Sir Pugger about it. If they weren't trying to advertise it, all its going to do is get Weath to look more into CoX. Maybe they're playing some long con trying to get other botters banned, who knows. But there's gotta be something going on there, because it makes no sense at face value.
---
Currently at 1024kc and now jaw... (off task btw)
---
Yeah would second that
---
Running a pc with 20 bots doesn't even sound extremely profitable, If you Rwt that after operation costs that would be like 10$ a day if you never got banned.
---
I just smacked him with a whip and prayed piety
---
Your most valuable resource is time and getting to end game requires a lot of it. If you're serious about playing and want to progress your account without putting years into the game or having to shut off parts of your life to make up that extra time to play, then you'll want to play with some level of efficiency.
---
Get your tin foil hats here folks
---
Nice, get on my level, haha, jokes, good luck dude!
---
I think this statement is pretty dumb, regardless of if pugger is working with the botters or not.
---
The bots he explained in his latest video are custom ones not readily available to everyone. Yes, they may make a shit load from running them but your average joe isn’t going to have the knowledge and server power needed to pull it off. If they did then they wouldn’t need a pugger video to tell them.
---
All the regular idiots who think they can bot their way to riches are gunna download something shit and eventually get banned. To say that pugger is ruining the game for giving us more knowledge surrounding the subject I think is pretty silly.
---
Open to conversation on this though
---
Are you dense? Do you think that rushing an issue like 3rd party clients is the correct solution? I can tell you, it isn't. This is a complicated issue that affects the majority of OSRS players and a rush decision could ultimately lead to banning all 3rd party clients. 
---
Jagex taking the time to outweigh the pros and the cons and make an informed decision is much more important than a week of 3rd party client abuse.
---
It's almost as if the game offers more than just the tedious skilling.
---
unfortunately yes.... Not my proudest moment
---
This, just bring runes for telegrab and immortal

who has 80 prayer and 1 range?

Also its annoying me that every bot related video he has uploaded has the same draynor mansion music looping endlessly
---
Average wages from Jagex are very low for being located in a very high cost-of-living city. It's not that they aren't hiring, it's that what they're offering isn't attractive to anyone with the qualifications.
---
Source?

Gimme a skybox and gpu renderer and I'd go back to the vanilla client

There are people making these figures but it's not these guys.

No one's making serious money with these accs that only last 1-2 days, especially since there's no mobile trials anymore.

If you're trying to be efficient a good all encompassing guide would be to find an Ironman guide and then if it talks about equipment you can make the choice to buy and skip that step
---
Most people would rather not make their grind literally take 5 times longer just because "fuck efficiencyscape xd", while also not even making it much less tedious since it would involve a lot of shop buying for astrals and natures.
---
Most irons I know, and myself, made one because the GP aspect was taking the fun out of being efficient. I enjoy efficiency, I just didn't enjoy the efficient answer to everything being "Just make money to afford the faster method", you know?
---
Pls send luck im dry of rangers 😭
---
Not when you only have 2.5m cash though.
---
Negative, 
---
No raids = max cash tbow = people do raids regardless.
---
They change the number of clicks needed to perform an action. That's how its related to the the more than 1:1 ahk scripts
---
every task that can be cannoned, should be cannoned. the drops usually offset the cost of cballs. except for suqah that drops nothing
---
If you have 1 ranged, you shouldn't be at trolls period.
---
I never said we need challenging skilling. I like PvM yes, and PvP minigames, and quests.
---
If you want chaos and an unplayable game, go to RS3.
---
Some big differences here though. Its more like if they interviewed a drug dealer and he told the kids how great selling drugs is. And if you got caught selling drugs, they didn't arrest you, just made you stop selling drugs. Unless you got a new fake ID, in which case you could start again. Also you buy the new fake ID from the police.
---
Not everyone wants to play the game that way, bud.

Pay to win is garbage is why it matters. Bonds should be removed

Would you keep the excess material?

Market forces would decide that but it wouldn't happen instantly and after the prices drop from people beginning to start doing them if Tbow actually hit max cash then they would leave again which would put it in a cyclical state as opposed to the basically constant running that happens now

You're right. Some people want to play for 8 hours each day for years and have nothing to show for it.

It may be fruitless for you to be killing them off task. It would be like trying to get a dragon sword or harpoon from wyrms off task. 1/10k off task vs 1/2k on task.

Except it's clearly a Facebook post
---
Fucking imps.... Every time...
---
Maybe Jagex should step the fuck up and do more about botting then?
---
And before anyone says that they are, the economy in the game is being massively altered by bots in a very noticeable way.  As long as that fact is still true, they are not doing enough about botting.  No matter how many accounts they've banned in the last month, they are not doing anywhere near enough about the issue and they should actually take it seriously for once in their careers.  People could be Jagex apologists all they want, but that doesn't change the facts that botting is a serious and observable issue in the game.
---
We already have perfect graphics
---
Runecrafting is tedious, but not click intensive. Where's the joke?
---
The point was that it's not actually more tedious on uim anyways. Uim and regular iron have the same meta for rc.
---
Yeah clearly the decided to just lie to everyone and go grab a pint.

How about being patient for a proper statement on one of the most important issues the game is facing right now? Jfc

...they don’t release drop rates so soon after release you mean?

yes i agree they are absolutely cheating, but the ahk comparison is meaningless because detecting it wouldnt be the same at all

Turtling accounts.

A very good, little known money maker is to have an alt make cash on rs3 and swap it over
---
used to be worth it with wildy slayer, not sure about the situation right now.

Please Jagex no god stories in OSRS. Despite what RS3 players think, the god storylines mostly suck.

You can do more if you bring a looting bag and suicide on first trip with full food inventory.

You can't type numbers even with the plugin can you? Unless you mean outside the game client in which case there's a line of text you can add to your script to fix that.

Those are just normal accounts that they're playing deliberately restricted manually. Still good content though.

When someone does that, a new bond is generated, increasing the supply of bonds and thus lowering the price.

Hmm. Respectfully I disagree - these injection bots can get the client to run ~150mb and very low cpu usage by disabling rendering. I've personally ran 10 bots on 16gb ram and an old Xeon I picked up for $150. (I don't bot anymore) I could imagine 3 year old used servers could do more. Shit, you could pick up used business workstations for $50 a pop and run ~5 clients a piece on them.
---
Proxies can be free but even the "fresh" ones are recycled and in a data center. I guarantee these ips are already flagged. All the cheap ones you buy are the same and are flagged too.  Residential proxies are expensive. 
---
Setting up your network has nothing to do with your external IP - you're given an address and no isp let's you change it at will unless you are on a commercial line.

Shout out to gathering and selling flax
---
I knew it was instanced, however it did not warn you that your things would not be retrievable. Ex: in SOAT when you Enter the small cave to kill the 2 elves the fight itself was not hard it was however instanced and there was a warning that items could not be retrieved if you died, this has been the way instances which you cannot retrieve your items have been handled have been handled. Therefor my assumption was that I would be able to get my items back if I did die somehow however unlikely it was.
---
The recent video shows a different client. You're referring to the previous video.

You are incredibly wrong, he is giving jagex so much information, anybody that watches pugger is not a casual runescape player they know what botting is and how to do it already, it’s not like it’s hard.
---
Alright well if that's what you consider a good reward for a quest then I'm not even going to spend time arguing because I agree that it was a great example of what an acceptable quest reward is.

Haha BABY! I was already 13 in 2008.

Recommend mixing it up and afking some skills instead. Fishing, woodcutting, mining etc. it’s gonna come to a lot of wasted combat xp when you start doing slayer

That depends on the "elasticity" of the products demand.
---
Certain products are inelastic. You can raise the price and it won't greatly effect the amount that people buy. For example: insulin. People with diabetes would buy insulin at twice the price because otherwise they would die.
---
Others product are elastic if you raise the price people will buy significantly less of it. For example: movie tickets. It they doubled the price of movie tickets, a huge amount of people would just stay home and watch movies on Netflix or entertain themselves otherwise.
---
I believe Runescape Bonds fall firmly in the elastic category.
---
Or download sharex
---
I'm not too worried about wasted XP! Kinda just want the satisfaction of getting my combat stats 99 Thanks though!
---
In addition to the other comment about birdhouse runs, work in herb runs as part of your playtime routine. Although herb prices have been way down lately, toadflax is low investment and will make you money over time.
---
As far as barrows, you are over droprate just keep grinding. Expect the pieces to start rolling in. If you get burnt out, I find doing afk gathering is good for some cash when you don't have the opportunity to focus full attention on the game.

Got a link?

Yeah from what i heard the people at the GE are mostly scammers, and RWT sites i think are probably shady and advertise like 30% shit conversion rates. I think the safest and easily thing to do is just use your rs3 account for bonds for your osrs acc since that way you can fund your membership and get the best equiv rates ussually. 
---
Also i never touched rwt sites since if you trade gold to someone who's rwting it you could risk being mistakenly mistook or having some suspicion put on your account for being a gold farmer/etc. Although the stance is that swapping isn't against the rules, but at your own risk. 
---
However, one place i did have some fairly good luck with, surprisingly were like this one random w2 staking clan that i wandered into. I only started skeptical at first, and would suggest small sums to test and watching others ofc to make sure they're getting it always after. They tend to host drop parties too so after a while i was joining it for the social aspect and fun really but half/66% of them were rs3, but with a swapping service and like 4 rs3 cannon drop parties and 2 rs3 BGses and some random new item and with a skeptical eye i tried the service, swapped it over, (they still take like a 10-20% equiv cut each way, but it's better than nothing) and you can see multiple people fight over the rates and they actually insure them each up to 100m.
---
Meaning in places other than Lumby or meaning in Lumby?
---
&gt;Linux
---
The only reason I use third party clients.
---
So is AFK mobile games that you pay real money to get xp boost, oh wait that’s RS3
---
Go until you get yourself at least a top and bottom you can wear around imo
---
Seriously who told them they needed to be made more difficult? Their drop tables don't justify it and eventually the jaw will be worthless, making them even less desirable to kill. They're not bosses, they're slayer monsters. Giving them annoying mechanics just removes the ability to afk them and nobody likes tasks you can't afk if they don't make a bunch of gp.
---
Helm isn't really niche since it will be used every serp was. The venom immunity isn't that useful since it costs more than antivenoms
---
I know, I'm sick of arguing with him, he's a dumbass purist who will pretend like the game should have the same shitty interfaces as 2004 forever.

History only repeats if you don't learn from it. You can get into an accident on the road with your car and learn from it, doesn't mean you stop driving forever or that accidents will never happen again.

There's is always an element of risk but you can minimize that risk but like all probability there is always that small chance of the impossible becoming possible.
---
Agreed like the only thing I can’t live without is ground item values and UI Resizing. Nothing worth quitting a favorite game over though

What does "tougher" mean? More mechanics? Higher stats?
---
Yes 12 hours is low, maybe he was busy yesterday.  Cut him some slack
---
Honestly keep doing barrows I would say. You’ll get items eventually, going dry for some time is inevitable but also pieces should be common enough that you probably won’t go dry for all that long. Focus on streamlining your runs and getting them done faster and more efficiently compared to focusing on what each chest is gunna be and it will be more of a nice surprise when you get an item compared to feeling like you finally got something. As long as you’re getting back runes for more runs and some bloods for a little profit you can keep sending them and be making some money even without items. Maybe set yourself a personal goal to get 200 runs complete, see how fast you can knock that out and by the end of it you’ll be going a lot faster I imagine and you’ll either have a few good items, a fat chunk of blood runes to sell for money, or hopefully both. 
---
The higher your mage and prayer the more efficient your runs will be, the only gear that DEFINITELY makes a big difference is mage damage boosting gear (occult, tormented bracelet, mage arena 2 cape). Other than that, prayer bonus and tanky gear helps
---
Why on earth do people want to sit on that bandwagon of everything will urn this into Rs3...
---
We got pulls the majority vote it in... If they dont like it it doesn't go in...

Not like they make these update and go here take it or leave it.

How much different is the atk/def list? Im getting higher str but what beats a whip?
---
You need to have a 3:1 ratio of brew to restores because 3 sips of a brew can be restored with one sip of a super restore. I usually bring 12 sara brews, 4 super restores, 4-8 prayer pots, 4 shark, 1 stamina, and the rest range pots.
---
Use the blowpipe spec if you are slightly low on health for waves &lt; 40. For waves after 40, you can combo eat shark and brews for a quick 40hp heal in emergency. Are you using safespots for melees? Are you killing rangers before magers? How do you usually die? (combo'd out, out of suppplies, etc.)
---
Geeze. I really feel sorry for you. Your social life must be hell.
---
The point of rules and their enforcement isn't to prevent every botter or cheater out there. It's to dissuade the masses from giving in to the temptation. It is similar to a lock on a safe; anyone that actively wants in will break through that lock quickly, but it dissuades the other 99.9% of people from considering it.
---
Higher entropy. More users will invariably cause any private bot to be causing more "noise" on Jagex's end - that's how crowds work.
---
The bot maker will likely take the increase in bans as an agreeable side-effect of the spike in numbers/subs/sales, since the extra revenue speaks to their bottom line. People will continue to use it regardless, for one reason or another.
---
Idle notifier is actually dumb af, all it does is encourage people to pay attention to the game less. When I first started this game and saw some YouTuber (A Friend I think?) use it on OSB, I was wondering to myself how something like that was allowed.
---
damn West is on fire lately
---
this looks even better than before
---
"We'll finish this later"
---
Jagex really needs to get on their game and bring this back.
---
DDoSing their servers shouldn’t be that easy.
---
There is also a paradox in resisting something from the past. Sometimes the actions you take to resist something end up working against you and they end up happening anyways. Good intentions pave the way to hell as some like to say.

I don't understand why the DFS gives magic XP vs NPCs and melee XP vs PVP.

I also don't see the harm of removing the magic XP and have only melee going forward. This sounds like it would help the defence/tank community ever since the serp helm nerf. 
---
Take my upvote.

If you're too dumb to gear up, then the game isn't for you.

Yeah i dont do kq anymore because it burnt me out. But i might go back again in a few months. It sucks cuz im over 4k kc and this dude gets the pet at 1k !!!!!

But my nastolgic game don't mess it up.

Ok, so when doing slayer, which by definition requires dozens of different gear layouts based on the task and how many, I totally just need to git gud and memorize everything.
---
Great argument, you do your incel buddies proud arguing the game should be less convenient and enjoyable to play. It sucks having a life outside of the game.
---
PvP clients are the main problem, and custom runelite clients with private plugins for peoples personal use. Inferno plugins as well.
---
Osbuddy adding skilling feaures is nothing but it's well known because it's osbuddy after all!
---
That sounds about right. The only issue would be that you’ll burn atleast 6500 logs but the axe degrades after 5000. Then you’ll have to decide on if you want to recharge the axe after that. 
---
Otherwise, with a sample size of 20000 it’s highly unlikely that you’ll get under the amount that you calculated.
---
Just got mole pet today at kc299. 
---
Super satisfied, my second pet in game. first one Skotos (wich is like 1/64).  Total xp ingame 100m
---
grinded hard fally diaries and only 2days and pet.  dharoking tho.
---
You don't like my quest I was brought in to make? :(
---
yeah cause we're all saints here
---
If every account that RWTed got permanently banned it would be worse for game health than if they banned all third party clients on Monday.
---
Ive said it for months and Everytime I bring up stuff like lyzardlite I get downvoted to hell. Yet everyone loves to hate in osb. I can t make ant sense of it cus lyzardlite is way more op honestly (both are bad) but people downvoted the shit out of every comment or post I made about them. So my only assumptions are a. People don't really understand what they are. Or b. I'm fucking insane and don't understand how life works. It could be either option in all fairness.

Random joe, guy who will never compete for a leaderboard in anything or be globally relevant in any way is using a plug in to reduce his carpal tunnel in glorified cookie clicker. The horror.
---
I don't agree with this. The point of old school Runescape was to remove the parts of the game that killed the game off such as summoning, chaotics and most importantly EoC.  Hell, I think EoC is single handedly the worst update that Runescape has ever had. Yes, even worse than the removal of free trade.
---
I hate these graphics. They're boring, old and just poorly done. I don't want graphics like modern shooters or single player games, but I'd LOVE the 2008 graphics. I think the whole "reeeeee nostalgia" view is the reason the game isn't growing. I think they need to update some of these things and then give a toggle to have it how it currently is. 
---
At the end of the day, the game really has had no real growth. Sure, there was a temporary bump with mobile but that didn't retain a huge amount of players. This game will not grow if the "we want to feel nostalgic" viewpoint doesn't die.
---
Also, I should point out, none of this is factual. **This is just my opinion** and I'm well aware there's a large group of people who disagree.
---
Correct. 
---
The option to ‚fill‘ is at a really inconvenient place, these clients allow it to come up as a ‚shift-click‘ option.
---
What you mean by sub quests? I have a CB brace I think, just forgot to put it on
---
RWTers don't care. If a certain resource starts crashing because of goldfarmers, the people who bought the gold are happy because they can buy more of it with what they bought. RWTing only hurts people who don't RWT.
---
Recharging it only costs c.50k though so it’s no huge loss.
---
What evidence do you have that theres too much gold coming into the game? Jmods have said on here in the recent past that theres a healthy amount of gold coming in.
---
Try looking in spam folder?
---
I actually like this better since it gods with the bandos
---
The thing is, this is probably not the most far-fetched thing present in the game :D

"We let you into our city out of gratitude, and this is how you repay us?"

Oh I know I’m not chastising Jagex or game companies for not accommodating, just agreeing with him!

Yeah, I know about adding another axe to get back to 100% thanks for the advice nevertheless. :)

well they have to go somewhere, reddit is a circlejerk of shit ideas and making the game easier

I don't see how the arms race for these OP client features is gonna stop with an updated stance if they can't enforce or detect any of them.
---
that mask is dumb as hell im so glad he barely ever actually wore it.
---
I know for my group of friends, that was the sole reason we quit RS3. Sure, the economy wasn't great and there was a whole bunch of OP shit that in hindsight wasn't great for the game. But, up until EoC, it was still a LOT of fun.
---
By the way he worded that its almost guaranteed
---
Look at the player count starting from October 2013 until now. If you make a linear trend line that ignores the release of mobile up until today, then you will see it is still a positive growth
---
Thanks man :)

Pets sometimes won't follow you correctly when you teleport. Just click the whistle icon in the equipment menu to get it back.
---
Not really.
---
Wait mith gloves are as good as combat bracelet? I'm so dumb. Done RFD except for the part that requires 175 qp...I thought only the last gloves were better.
---
Something something opportunity cost.
---
For real though, unless you're doing it on an alt you're *much* better off doing almost any other money maker and buying the cannonballs instead. By a *lot*. Sell the steel and spend that time thieving seeds or doing blast furnace, let alone bosses, and you'll be able to get, at minimum, 3-4x more cannonballs than you would smithing in the same time.
---
the problem is when u have 200m xp in a skill you stop getting xp in it, so if you prestiged at 200m you could never get it past lvl 1

Zulu has a good guide for Vetion.  Also, if you can’t afford a vig mace, I would wait until you can to do vetion.  Kills are so slow without it
---
Whip is generally the best, tentacle is better but it cost money per hit so generally not worth it unless you're PVMing. The BIS is the rapier, which is quite expensive.
---
I’m with this guy, sounds like your pc is just trash.   I also run on 50 FPS on every world (even during the SOTE quest) with my game on stretched mode with Netflix running on my 2nd monitor.
---
Idk about that, i had a buy offer in at 7m that still hasn't gone through. they might have dipped below 20m but not 2m yet lol. I think once the hype dies everyone will stop killing them expect for the occasional task which will keep the price up around hydra leather/ zenyte prices.

I think summoning as a skill was/is a fantastic idea. The problem was the implementation. I would be 100% in favor of a reworked summoning. Like instead of BoB being like a second inventory for supplies, make them like extra room for loot but they only have like 5 slots and the only way to remove items from them is via a bank.

This. And basically if you're just a starting dev in the business, it's kinda worthless as job experience if you want to move up in the future, as they use their own code with an outdated engine.

Bufff their drop table. N O T so its BIS gp maker but so its not a skippable task

Only followers of the Dark Lord may picketh the royal Cabbages peasants \*smites them down\*

From what I've experienced most of the struggle right out of college is not knowing what you're worth.
---
Everyone who gets mad about it proceeds to use it. If you don't like it don't use it. Who gives a shit. Other people using it isn't affecting your gameplay
---
Are there any slayer bots? Iirc botting slayer isn’t really a thing.
---
This, some people have trouble flipping because they see an item going up but buy into it too late, so they get burned. It's a game of awareness, foresight and patience, really.
---
How much did you sell it for?
---
400 kc and this has happened like 10 times. Super annoying
---
I’m like woox with my mastery of game mechanics so I get why they’re mad
---
Yes it is
---
I'm fuming
---
I mean your argument is stupid regardless. No shit something that gives a ton of xp isn’t profitable.
---
There are two main things in runescape. XP and gold. Why would you expect to get both from one thing?
---
There’s a reason that stuff never drops below alch value, the second it does thousands of players jump in on it
---
There are times where I can see the good things about the Tool Belt, but inventory management is just a core thing in OSRS IMO.
---
It looks really fucking good, but is this a redesign or is this a mutagen? Because I would fucking hate for it to be a mutagen/ornament.
---
It sold for 25m

Yeah it’s almost like they don’t want to he told they’re shit at the game and need a client to do well

50 FPS is not impressive either when cs go runs at 200 FPS. It doesn’t matter if I’m watching Netflix on top of it or not , the default client is just hot garbage

It just shows they haven't quested like at all to get to the meassly rune gloves(you can get rune gloves very fast and easily it's nothing close to dragon or even barrows)

Well you have 1 prayer, yikes, and with 1 magic you're mage def sucks and you'll get toasted by magic.

Well I think a decent amount of people were wearing the regular Neitznot helmet anyways right?
---
Okay what about this: The faceguard has no extra stats until taken to that spirit south of Relleka where it can be imbued for a price. It then acts as a slayer helmet while keeping the +3 strength bonus but only against Fremenik slayer monsters. So it would mainly be useful against basilisk, kurasks, and ice troll tasks, as well as the other monsters in the Fremenik slayer dungeon.
---
man there really is a sub for everything
---
I’m actually disgusted
---
No it wouldn't it would make bots less profitable.
---
Hence why 75 def pures are best at doing abyss
---
The game should run off gpu then. Not just in runelite
---
Untrue. Engine or not, they heavily improved the bot detection system on rs3. And in my honest opinion, it's quite easy to figure out if someone is botting. Without letting the algorithm out, anyone thats been online for, lets say, 20+ hours in a day gets flagged immediately by the system. They get transported automatically to a location where they have some sort of constantly changing event that cannot be added to a script. If you're a real person, it should take you 10-15 seconds to get through... If it takes you 5 mins or longer (while you were actively doing agility or something like that and not afk woodcutting) or maybe your script keeps moving your bot in that location, you're a bot and get banned.
---
Keep us posted, this thing is sweet.

i thought pures didn't train prayer since it raises their cb level? and apart from magic and prayer are the other stats ok?

You know you can just whistle your pet from the equipment screen right?

Doing DT, finally got thieving to 53 which is the skill I hate the most, after finishing it I will just do the RFD bosses and finally get my barrows gloves
---
Yes they can.  A multi-million dollar company can afford to pay 4 machine learning phds $200,000 a year each.  They choose not to, because it's far more profitable in the short term.  Whether it's more profitable in the long term remains to be seen.  Maybe people will care that botting is an issue and quit, or maybe people will just play Ironman.
---
Make it have crossbow range or I'm going to have to pass.
---
Nah, we don't need any more gold entering the game
---
It’s Konars way of telling you to fuck off cuz she’s a terrible master unless you go at milestone tasks or are looking for hydras :)
---
I have been playing the game, as a whole as long as anyone on the game.
---
I have been playing osrs since release. I still think pre eoc graphical updates looked better. (Primarily talking about the lumby, varrock, falador, edge, seers, and ardy building and general graphical updates) not the extremes as people seem to,think they remember it.
---
Aaah got you, no worries, I should’ve had more than a glance.
---
It's 100k a week
---
Are we looking at the same graph or something? We're almost 10k up from 2 years ago still. Wtf are you talking about with this petty not even a 101 class. You're talking to me like I'm a retard wheen you're clearly blind. Yes I'm trying to rationalize the data because that's what you do with data you dipshit, you analyze it. I'm telling you wtf is going on with the player base and I said the old player base was in fact leaving with the release of all these other games. Doesn't mean we're still not positive over 2 years because we are by nearly 10k. So get off your high horse bro. Your arguments are based on things I've fucking said you condescending twat

Imagine being that hostile over a cosmetic

Oops my bad, kinda new to OSRS reddit lol

---
&gt; I don’t get this comment. Almost all of the people who have mutagens got extremely lucky and probably put in less than 30 hours
---
How do you know this? 
---
To make the claim you are trying to make, you would need the following data:
---
1) The sum total of Zulrah kills for players that killed Zulrah for &lt;30 hours.
---
2) The sum total of Zulrah kills for players that killed Zulrah for &gt;30 hours. 
---
If 1 &gt; 2, then yes, your claim would most likely be correct. 
---
If Group A = 25,000 players got 100,000 kills. 
---
And Group B = 100 players got 80,000 kills.
---
A 1/10,000 drop rate would make 10 of Group A's 25,000 players (.04% of players) have a mutagen, but only 8 of Group B's 100 players (8% of players) have a mutagen. 
---
But I don't really think this is going to be the case. 
---
So:
---
How do you know it *is* the case? How do you have this data?
---
Oh so every unique item has its own timer. That's annoying. Thanks for the info though. It was really helpful
---
I was in the back
---
Absolutely. You will never have to buy a piece of gold jewelry for a teleport ever again. It saves bankspace and also doesn’t clutter you bank up with skill necklace (1) (3) (4) and bullshit like that
---
A lot of the things he mentions are people developing and either selling their product or using their product for their own gain. A majority of this community is incapable of that and will more than likely bot for personal use or maybe small gains, and that's if they aren't being banned fairly quickly due to over use.

Just say that its snipping tool

I got a few more kills per hour than the west ardy mourner spot, due to more double hits from the cannon. I estimate it to be a maximum of about 15% faster to do it here.

VPS isn't enough for what they've got going on. The cash burn is more vs having your own setup.

My home lab is probably enough to run what they do. Prices of VPS adds up REALLLYYY fast, especially when used 24/7 and a high demand environment.
---
My cabbages!
---
I can appreciate that, thanks. 
---
If you still wanna continue this analysis..., here's a thing.
---
&gt; considering the context of what losing autocast does to damage output. 
---
&gt; Manual casting is the one with luck, as even if you know the top monster on a stack will die to a barrage, it's impossible to know for sure which other monsters in the pile will die. The 2nd monster in the list is usually the most recent addition to the pile, but that doesn't mean it's the highest health. 
---
This applies to both manual and autocasting. You have 5 ticks to do actions without losing dps (your attack speed), including selecting your spell and monitoring your targets' hp. Then you can you just click once to cast again, just like in autocast mode if you switched targets.
---
I have done loads of both autocast and manual casting in the past, and i do not just realise why autocast is considered so valuable. At abyssal demons, for example, i want to monitor my targets' positions and switch targets often. That 5 ticks is easily enough for me to recast spell and switch target (if needed). 
---
As for stacking into 1-2 tiles, you lose alot of time doing that. Just stack them 3x3 and move inbetween casts to position the rest better...
---
This is some deep shit right here though.
---
Mainly some new pvp stuff. Some of the ideas look good, some don't. They almost certainly won't pass because wildy pvp content, but w/e.
---
The real MVP
---
Hey buddy, we don't fool around here. This is serious business!
---
... there’s a safe spot?
---
Nah, it would flourish.  It would force certain game changes that would be positive, too.
---
Just not entirely terrible enough to rate a block, and usually doesn't rate a skip, but man are they not an interesting task either. 
---
The only good thing I've found about Fire Giant tasks is going to the Catacombs and hoping for totems/shards + Giant heads.

u mean u never took a hit thru a carb?
---
I'll sell you my GF.
---
Why does there need to be set Pvp builds? Keep robes at 30 def and they're still best for zerkers. I feel 13/20/30 accounts could be very interesting if some things got changed that wouldn't affect any of the other builds.
---
Regular trees are not as good as fruit or the special trees although I still did a willow run out of habit together with fruit trees daily before I hit 99. Willows are cheap but kinda weak exp. 6x1500xp per day is ok I guess, same as a single palm or 1.5x a papaya. If you got money to burn then spam out the yew and magic trees every 4 hours. They will beat fruit trees if you do more than 1 run per day but cost a ton.

How about they re-design the icons for ensouled heads? Every time I'm hunting for the head I want to use, and I KNOW it's gotta be right there. Where the heck is this chaos druid guy???? None of these look like him! 
---
Then of course I finally find and click the right one, but still feel pretty stupid because of course it was right there... but it didn't look a thing like chaos druids.

Hydra leather is locked behind 95 Slayer and a boss fight much more challenging than basalisks.

Thing is, even if they are inadvertantly doing that I still super enjoy listening to what Pugger and the owners have to say. As someone who has 0 clue how botting works it's interesting and doesn't give me any desire to bot myself
---
Feel like you’re missing the point. People see 200k a year from botting and it makes them go buy scripts and bot. Simple as that.

Make it cleave every living thing in a 90 degree cone up to crossbow range.

His joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took him a total of like 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? His joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. He outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭
---
In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as "R/Wooooosh" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as "Schadenfreude," which means "harm-joy" 😬😲. WOW! 🤪 Another reference I had to explain to you. 🤦‍♂️🤭 I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.😏😂

Dunno why you're being downvoted, you're just right.

It's very cost efficient if you never pay the farmers watch you crops, but treat the patches with an ultracompost and resurrect whenever you get unlucky. Fruit trees has 3,1% chance to survive with an ultracompost and when you get unlucky, you pay about 6,5k in runes to roll with 50-75% chance (scale with your Magic level up to 99) to resurrect your dead tree. These tree seeds could be worth over 100k.
---
To give you numbers: if you use this method, your every **102nd** tree would die but you have saved 102 payments for the cost of 51 Ultacomposts (if using Bottomless compost bucket), 26k in runes and 1 dead tree = 66,8k + tree seed in total. If you plant Dragonfruit trees and use this method, you save 1530 Coconuts when you do not pay the farmers = 2952k. This end up saving you 2705k in total or **26,5k per tree** if you treat your Dragonfruit trees with an ultracompost, do not pay the farmers and resurrect your trees whenever you get unlucky.
---
This same method works very well on other trees too with high payment and seed costs. I only did the math on Dragonfruit tree seed.
---
Look at the size of that dragon schLONG
---
The largest thing is polling ancient weapons from the dead man tournaments.
---
I doubt they'll pass.
---
That's epic like old school RuneScape :)
---
There were ironmen there and they couldn’t get the drops since he attacked them all. He wouldn’t finish the kills himself. He’d let other people do it who didn’t realize what was goin on, idk how that wouldn’t be griefing especially with something so new and crowded.
---
Didn’t even realise this was the case, I just assumed it would be better across the board. 
---
I mean, come on.. it’s been enchanted by every man and his dog and has lunar glass (whatever the fuck that is?!). If anything, it should have a magic +5.
---
Lunar also has NPC Contact, which is sometimes handy for Slayer. (Mostly just for Turael point boosting, though, since his tasks are so short.)
---
But yeah, there's not really all that much incentive to use ensouled heads immediately. Especially when you can just have the soul bearer warp them over to the bank.
---
People WANT to bot.
---
The game was at its peak subscription count when bots were everywhere right before EOC.
---
Nobody has ever liked the grind and what few dedicated runescape players remain in 2019 still don't like it.
---
&gt;	For real though, unless you’re doing it on an alt you’re much better off doing almost any other money maker and buying the cannonballs instead
---
Smithing cannonballs is a pretty decent passive money maker, when you’re in a *very* AFK situation that prevents you from interacting with the game more than once every few minutes.
---
free/paid scripts get banned easily.
---
Lol yeah man theyre sturdy af. His has a reinforced stem as well and a few downstems/bowls have broke when it got knocked over but the piece itself is flawless still
---
What I did was complete all easy/medium diaries + some fossil island fossils. Easy 55 rc!
---
He found it funny, thought he would share :)
---
Depends on the stats and how much you're selling it for
---
Nice try cia, id sooner trust paper hats than your "tin foil" hats.
---
That's still not griefing he is just securing kills sure it's a dick move but it isn't griefing he was getting more kills p/h there's nothing that says someone has to let people get kills ironmen aren't special they're doing crowded content on release.
---
Oh ok. I was gonna be really sad that I didn’t know about that feature lol
---
slurp slurp slurp slurp
---
You can see the chat changing with each "teleport" lmao try harder
---
[THE TRUTH].  https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1177543342328098816) 
---
Just FYI
---
They already have the basics for it in the Charge X Orb spells (as well as Ape Atoll teleport's banana), so would it really be that difficult?
---
Then again, I can definitely imagine that their code is spaghetti enough that those are made as extremely special cases and it somehow doesn't work for ensouled heads.
---
I don't think this message was for me :)
---
Armadyl Crossfaded 😏
---
I think the idea is to lock different head behind different levels but it eends up filling the book with spells that are functionally identical
---
I hope this isn't my fate. I'm killing the snek now solely for pet as well. I just want the noodol pet.
---
Yeah they just down vote stuff that makes runecrafting not aids because reasons and skill cape.
---
Back to you, hipster
---
Linux support, stretched mode, and hopefully uncap the FPS so I can finally use decent refresh rates and not want to vomit when I play
---
So you're saying people with gigantic bot farms program their own software to check hundreds of accounts? Right, okay I agree with that entirely. Why would your type of payment option matter if you're still having to pay for the upkeep of a VPN? Auto-renew or not, it's still negating profit from your bot farms.   
---
So a bot farm with 100-200 accounts, how many systems do you need to leave running for the bots to stay active throughout the day? That's gotta be over 10 (and that is a generous estimation) high-end systems with VM's on to run at least 20 accounts per system. That will leave a single-person bot farmer with a huge electricity bill - if somebody also has 100-200 bots at their disposal, do you really think they're all going to have human-like usernames or have any anti-ban measures at all? No. There's fucking hundreds of them. Every time a bot goes down **(which would be even more likely if you are botting things that have less requirements than Zulrah)** you will have to create another account. There will always be issues with accounts if you are managing that many of them, program or human.  
---
I would gladly be a bot farmer for £100,000, who the fuck wouldn't? That is just not possible and metaphorically not worth the upkeep whatsoever. So I divert what I said in my original comment: **you have to be mentally deficient to think doing all of that** (which requires an godly amount of focus and determination, more than a normal, full-time job) **is worth it.**
---
Creative idea, but I don't think this is particularly needed, desired, or effective at addressing the use cases you mentioned. I think there are other ways to make the game enjoyable post-max
---
h
---
I appreciate you. Thank you!
---
&gt; Both our comments hinge on no evidence and you’re writing a lot of waffle to say that
---
&gt; 
---
Except **you** are the one making a claim. 
---
**I** am not making any claims. I share what I think is the truth. But I am not saying, assertively, that what I said is the absolute truth, because I don't have evidence other than that many people farm Zulrah. 
---
You, on the other hand, made an assertive claim, backed by zero evidence. 
---
"Almost all of the people who have mutagens got extremely lucky and probably put in less than 30 hours"
---
&gt; My original comment still stands that mutagen has little value as an achievement because it’s entirely luck based 
---
Almost every single item drop in the game is luck based. 
---
&gt;with non-existent entry entry barriers to getting it
---
It's not, though. 
---
It's a very rare drop with pretty high entry barriers to get, killed from a dangerous boss. Learning how to kill Zulrah takes skill, lots of practice, and decent stats/gear, and even then, you can still die doing it. 
---
&gt; And that for every person who hit the drop rate there are far more who have it and never got near that rate.
---
And you magically know this how? 
---
It could be possible that there are 5,000+ Zulrah farmers with 13k killcount, and mutagens, and you just don't know it.
---
Not a question, but I don’t think this warrants an entire post. I just want to say thank you so much to the people who hop on these threads and help out. I just (finally) beat the fight caves for the first time, and I couldn’t have done it without the help of you fine people! So thanks again!
---
1/1 drop when you pull it out of the bank and drop it on the floor for a screenshot
---
Gross
---
I have an unused account I used to play pre-eoc on. It has a unique login name (not email) and no email attached to it. Tried to log in today and it had been perm banned for botting. Not that I really care, since it's a level 3, but the password is still the same as it always was. 
---
Only thing i'm wondering is if it just got randomly banned. It's just weird that the password still is the same.
---
No fun allowed =(
---
This ^
---
and skeletons XD funny story: i was cannoning ensouled heads, went to go bank, and saw a skeleton champion scroll drop notification in my chat box at the bank. Ran back to go get it, but I missed it. Took me another 11k kills to get another one -_-
---
You just don't really realize the sheer magnitude of the numbers involved. Each mutagen is 1/13159.
---
Ok, so for 1/6579 drop rate to get either mutagen, the odds of getting any mutagen within 100 kills is ~1.5% (1-(6578/6579)^100). Therefore, for every 1000 people who did 100 kills, statistically speaking you can expect that ~15 of them got a mutagen during those 100 kills.
---
Now how many people do you think there are who got 100 kc on Zulrah, vs the amount of people who reached 6579? 6.5k is a pretty fucking high amount of kc, only a very small amount of players get to that point, and you haven't even hit the drop rate until you get to that point either.
---
Case in point, the majority of players who have a mutagen got it because they were extremely lucky, not because they were skilled at the boss and did thousands of kills.
---
&gt;pbr
---
mobile hydra squad. also was blessed with a claw at 210kc 4 days ago
---
Fremmenik Mutagen? Are you talking about the Basilisk Jaw?
---
Should be basalisk head recolor
---
not maxed?
---
This is actually incorrect, even though other people's explanations are plausible. 
---
If you get a clue, complete steps, drop it, get another: your new clue will start from step 0. 
---
If you get a clue, drop it and keep it on the ground, get another, complete steps on the first clue, drop it, pick up the second clue: your new clue will start with X many steps completed.
---
do u not understand how to keep a conversation going?
---
Can't remember the last time I talked to an actual banker irl
---
you ever fish in real life? my hooks catch on rocks all the time and i have to break off D:
---
you're absolutely right im agreeing with you and found what you shared hilarious.
---
the man probably camps green drags with a rune halberd and full dragon on dont mind him
---
To be completely fair, once you're in close combat (assuming you know how to fight) you basically don't need to see
---
the ags comes into the game as a byproduct of people camping for armadyl armor. the demand for arma armor far surpasses the demand for ags.
---
it's the same issue as other uniques which come from bosses with sustainable drop tables without that unique. zulrah weapons, rev weapons, etc. long term the ags is only going to drop, nothing will change that except for armadyl armor being devalued.
---
It's usually better to just pray vs those monsters. I assume you're talking about aberrant spectres and bloodvelds at least
---
Have you tried turning it off a on again?
---
Why would anyone wanna smoke from a pipe? It’s horrible literally anything is better
---
Me too, not as bad tho got 2 tasks for 800 points
---
items dont leave the game but they do leave the active market.
---
lots of stakers do item hoard, lots of stakers dont actively participate in the market anymore. an item that sits on an acc that only stakes is effectively "removed" from the game.
---
Expensive server hardware? You mean a VPS for $15 a month to run 20-50 bots?
---
Perfect, I think i could definitely manage 85 without getting too tired of it. Would net some pretty good resources as well. I was hoping to get graceful and 70 agility before jumping back into WT and questing though. Reasonable or no? I just feel travelling is so slow coming from RS3. Thats another thing I'd like to prioritize: Fairy Rings.
---
If someone says trade me money and you'll get rewarded it's obviously a scam. Natural selection I suppose.
---
pkers are how many % of the playerbase?
---
Well I wouldn’t want to be rude.
---
Am I one?
---
The four that I'm assuming u think look the same are in fact different. One has a gradiant for instance
---
Thanks. I've got my brightness on max as well... solved it by putting it in paint and filling bits in white
---
100% support this. Looks sick
---
What's sad though is there's usually some real players in world 1 that kill the wizards, blissfully unaware that they are surrounded by bots.
---
maybe for melee vork but serp defence should be more useful.
---
This is incorrect. New clues will start their step counter from zero.
---
congrats on your first beer, i promise there's better beer than that
---
&gt;(longest)
---
What seems to be the problem
---
Don’t they get your email, cc, and IP address? That’s enough if it’s associated with your osrs info.
---
Feels wonderful! I thought I peaked at double Holy Sandals; boy, was I wrong!
---
Now if only I used that luck on triple Rangers, or even just one Bloodhound :(
---
I assume you didn't get all 3 visages from vork did you? If so that would be incredible lol
---
D
---
This is incorrect. New clues will start their step counter from zero, no matter if the old clue has despawned or not.
---
You joke but if it did take 2x black dragon leather for example that would make both items more expensive which I think would be a positive for the game overall except for the fact that F2P can’t kill black drags currently afaik.
---
It will have mxt by then.
---
Omg cannon at lizards kills my soul
---
Uh... thats like saying someone lighting a cigarette on an airplane isn’t harming anyone else and we should just deal with it. OSbuddy continuing this garbage will cause 3Pcs to get ‘grounded’ to stay with the analogy. 
---
You’re incredibly shortsighted if you cant see this...
---
its +20 in all defensive bonuses, + equivalent to 2,500 rings of recoil.
---
**just a tanky ring** :D
---
Nope, levels don't matter for skilling as you get resources at a fixed rate.
---
Just 90+ combat stats
---
Good job
---
Peeped this on the OSRS banter FB group
---
Its what makes mobile so dammm dynamic
---
Lmao - you made this account same day as your other one got banned. Please just hold this L and stop living in your fantasy world.
---
I feel like not enough people appreciate how comical it is that in 2016 they thought 'yeah let's make a new spellbook that has 20 different spells to reanimate different heads for prayer xp'
---
Clearly you need to take a class about historical headgear for war.
---
lol you're in denial
---
2m an hour on a med level account, for completing possibly the easiest master quest in the game?
---
why would u unlock it just to skip it
---
Yeah I'm gonna keep it in the box just incase they ask for it back.
---
&gt; And it costs 0 gp to play
---
Supply cost adds up, especially when you're using bp
---
Can't live withouy em :D
---
Civil war coming up?
---
As a PKer, I would say the only one I'd be ok with passing would be Zuriels as it's on par with existing gear. Everything else is overpowered.
---
What the others said, its a player restricted challenge with a runelite eiverlay to give them the icons.
---
Actual group ironman mode is on the back burner for Jagex. Apparently it first requires an overhaul to the clan system which is engine work.
---
And there's only a couple of guys in the entirely of Jagex that can apparently  do that work so it's incredibly slow going.
---
I'm sure they won't mind you sending it directly to me, cuts time off customs :) my house is in burthorpe
---
Weed lmao
---
technically for 'efficient' training you don't specifically train def ever, since you get a lot of exp from bursting/barraging slayer tasks.
---
S
---
That...doesn’t sound like a real class
---
Yea 85 wont take long at all. and yea definitely, a lot of irons rush graceful early for questing. 
---
Yes Fairy rings and also ardougne cloak 1 if you havent got that yet are great for early questing and are easy to get.
---
I do vorkath on task with a serp helm since i use DHL
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWUv8bqRDc8
---
This is my usual method as well
---
perhaps SirPuggers vid bringing in new 200-bots-per-machine botters?
---
Eh that's pedantic.
---
I am not proud of this. But sometimes art is more necessary than wanted...
---
As the other guy said, most people know this strategy. It isn’t reliable in a game mode with a tax or in a world where you don’t have infinite funds. Doubling up each time gets to be a lot real quick. That being said if you calculate ahead of time what number of games would be a really small percent to lose in a row, like .05% or less, and prepare enough money for that doubling strategy for that many games, then that’s somewhat safe. But there’s still the issue of the tax. That would be at least 6 or so games. By the time you’re betting 100m or whatever on your 5th game you’re burning a substantial amount each game.
---
This is reddit, probably has the highest concentration of bondies besides Facebook.
---
The fact they pay so little is part of their incompetency. They have a 75 million a year revenue, no fucking way they cant pay their devs more than 35k. They're just cheap fucks.
---
in like 09 there were graves that people could repair or bless for you to extend your items. you could talk to the priest in lumbridge to upgrade your graves so they lasted longer.
---
I’ll take two!! Hopefully less than in game
---
Is this what vaccinated children look like? Shit the anti vaxxers may have been right.
---
C
---
It's just +3 strength why would it stay over 10m?
---
wow
---
Home teleport is the only thing u need m8
---
This is a massive fucking straw man and two completely different comparisons, fuck off.
---
They're karamja gloves 3!
---
I did not know this, sweet!
---
I’ll be honest, I usually vote “not sure” on most pvp stuff as it doesn’t really effect me much
---
Isn't it a great feature that you can downvote people you disagree with, amazing
---
Ivee been doing duos and trios
---
Yeah but from the looks of things that player count for rs3 is accelerating towards 0 much faster than the steady decline they were used to. I don't think Jagex is going to wait for that number to reach zero before they start licking their greedy lips when it comes to osrs.
---
I was told once when I first ever played Runescape that cannon shots that go off screen can be picked up by players. and sold in Falador park, and I believed it. Even to this day.
---
HahahahahWOW
---
Just followed the weed subreddit, thought is was a bong xpxd
---
Lmao imagine if people posted a screenshot of every valuable drop on reddit
---
I had a buddy that did that one night after he lit up and thought it was hilarious. Was an Ironman and alched every dwarf weed drop he got from Slayer, kept telling at him stop wasting the nats lol
---
Most of my kc in cox is duo and tios. Mainly duos. We take our time thou we take a longgg time to finish. like 30-35 minsa
---
HOW DO I GET THIS. I NEED IT.
---
Yes, if you have a clue already you can't get another one. You should do your elite clue before you go back to Vorkath again.
---
The meta is to skip that shit
---
Dragon longlongsword
---
Hits through protection*
---
Notr: west ardy spot isnt even available anymore after SotE
---
Well it gives the people who made the scripts money, who will then make more scripts, different scripts.
---
Farm constantly. Never let a patch sit for more than a day. Youll have the herbs you need for herb asap
---
Hope so, desert needs more love
---
I still feel like these are incredibly niche uses that hardly qualify as "freaking amazing," like I'd rather use a house tab and mounted glory for a quarter the price of a salve tab, and I don't even have my quest cape. And who dies with so many accumulators that they need to get more more than, like, once?
---
Tyrone longsword
---
Tbf offmychest is absolutely horrific, r/trueoffmychest is much better, and they're not a bunch of social justice warriors.
---
Also the admins of Reddit have said they're against people banning based off participating in other subs, but they can't/won't do anything about it. Imo it's pretty pathetic, as they don't differentiate between the degree of participation.
---
Doesn't the effect animation happen over your character, not the npc?? I could be wrong, I haven't played in months.
---
Why do people buy gp? Making your own money is way more fulfilling.
---
I only put 4 of each because I don't have more (their drop rate is bad, and I'm an ironman). I saw on youtube that you don't need to fill it to work though.
---
it lost weight because you removed some of heavy metal from the helmet and replaced it with tougher and lighter basilisk jaw ™
---
I wanna eat monkfish on the ground too. Cause I'm just a Savage.
---
Im not. Devalues my keywork knowledge
---
Yea I can wreck 127 Dag's in like 10 minutes while alching.
---
Lumbridge castle basement
---
I have quest cape, and I'm really excited when a new quest is announced
---
Salve tab is probably 20 to 30 seconds closer to a fairy ring than edgeville.
---
PVP accounts lose accumulators a lot.
---
You're right, they are niche, but they are still incredibly useful in certain scenarios. Pretty much every non-standard spell or teleport is niche but incredibly useful.
---
There is pretty much never a reason where picking less damage for more defense is ever worth it in pvm
---
Did my part to keep them from getting new content so long as I'm forced out there.  Protip:  divide the spade into handle, rod and shovel for 3 player ambushes
---
Grind for 500 level free skills and grab wines at the altar jumping between 2 worlds, 300k/h
---
Ive had it fail a few times cuz i didnt fill both; id question how accurate that vid is
---
The only click that gets registered to Jagex in the first place is the bone being used on a altar. You clicking the bone to select it is not counted as an action in both the game or client. It’s basically a wasted click.
---
No argument there.
---
Vanaka doesnt assign a ton but its one of the highest weighted tasks from him. And chances are the task you get is fast enough that you dont have to skip it.
---
I also favor magic, and I'm also frustrated with how magic in rs is. I managed to get 99 magic anyway, but still
---
It's not
---
jokes aside that’d be pretty bomb
---
if it was near lumbridge. as a new player you’d get to see the high end players running towards raids and wonder and ask about what they’re doing.
---
Farm the herb
---
I think they might eventually dip below 2m but it'll take a long time for them to stabilize there. That might be months away.
---
I think black mask or whip are a better comparison than hydra leather or zenyte.
---
Have an offer for 3m has not sold.
---
word! Been super annoying
---
Lotta butthurt nerds in here over nothing.
---
far too high of requirements. 3 rc max!
---
Does running as a candidate exempt you from being investigated for past corruption? Maybe Trump is only having him investigated because he is an opponent. Does his motive change anything? 
---
In this case, I think if Biden isn’t guilty of anything, it will just make Trump look bad. If he is, Trump will be able to claim “upholding justice” or something as his motive.
---
Are you going to slip an rs reference into the name?
---
This is exactly how I work when I do gwd. If someone that is looking to make money is willing to tank for me I will offer them all the drops and only split unique's. This is super beneficial for new players trying to make money.
---
*Nothingburger*
---
same! I never cared about untrimmed capes but slayer is such a prestigious one. Takes a lotta care.
---
Looks like farming will be my first 99 and im not sure how to feel about it lol.
---
Like Stat Spy, which is useful when you don't have a third-party client, or Monster Examine which is useful when a quest just came out and you want to be the first to update a wiki page
---
I don't get all the anger being caused by the possibility of it "being another mutagen hunt". The current design is sick as is and nobody is forcing you to do it. Honestly little cosmetic completionist goals like that have been and always will be one of the things that make OSRS cool
---
