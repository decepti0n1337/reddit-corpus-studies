I think he means ditch bandos and get a torso+obby legs. Spend the leftover cash on prim/torture.

Mage form can randomly use ranged attacks. It's not possible to predict them.

I agree wholeheartedly to everything you said here.

Well, I would but it’s just id get in the mindset of never wanting to make a mistake during risky content, restricts you from quite a lot of clue scrolls too and other content that involve the wilderness

around 6 months to get the supplies for 82-99
---
I'm almost always afk for now. This account is 2 months old lol so stackable are perfect for me to stay down here and farm decent xp and decent gold. The gloves are good, but they're not worth getting an entire stat to 70 and doing another 120 points worth of quests. If we're talking about priorities, how about having stats vs. having gloves.

Oo wow I did not know this, i couldn't figure out why I'm taking so much damage even tho I'm protecting mage, so anytime hes in mage form he can use range as well?

ah shit, almost clicked on this at work. Not this time...

It's true. ITS DAM TRUE!

Really looking foward to starting raids, still need to find a good group and get some better gear.

When you unlock GE teleport from diaries the varrock tele becomes very useful. Jewelry box is op same with mounted glory until you get the leveld to unlock it in jewelry box. Spirit tree? It depends on what you wanna do tbh

Morvran was next in line for the title of Lord Iorwerth, but gave it to a dude you meet in Plague's End (RS3 Song of the Elves) for reasons of peace and clan stability. The actual Lord Iorwerth gets nommed halfway through the final boss fight on that quest.

Yeah. If you see a little bluegreen splash looking thing heading towards you while fighting mage form, definitely eat up. He can easily combo a back to back 40 40 lol.

Don't bother trying to pray flick on mage form. You'll just die for nothing.

dya mind if i ask how you estimate that number? based on roughly how many herb runs a day etc n what else is included. thanks pal!

Yes please

I just looked at the xp graphs for herblore and farming on crystalmathlabs to get an estimated start/end date. I think I averaged around 5-9 herb runs per day.

It's a grandmaster quest so it most likely won't be possible for pures to complete.

Well i'm not an Ironman so, anything? I wanna start Bossing in God Wars and Zulrah.

This is it.

It's all passing at like 90%+ so it's fine.

---
The drain does not take into account your gear, correct.
---
The difference between wearing prayer gear (prossy, devout boots etc) vs wearing mage gear for dps is so insignificant you will spend far less on supplies (prayer pots) wearing the prayer. 
---
You can try both and compare results, I have and found that the prayer is much more efficient. :)
---
started laughing because i knew what this was before i clicked on it xd
---
Yes, anytime you see a blue zulrah pray mage but watch for his range attack. Keep your HP above ~45.

Most likely quest locked, you chose to limit yourself.

Probably focus on getting a firecape

This is the finale to the elf questline.

not knowing the game means a player is willing to let down his teammates because he was too lazy to learn these simple mechanics from a youtube vid

I mean I disagree with that guy but every MMO needs elite tier items that your average player won’t obtain. Need something to work towards.

99 Hunter by catching red chins. Currently level 86 and I should have around 40k chins by the time I reach 99. Then I plan on using 20-25k of those chins to get 99 Ranged and HP respectively.

Problem is I just finished my main show I watched on the side (Silicon Valley), and now I'm feeling minimal motivation to finish the grind. I need a new show to watch, or just watch The Office again for the 10th time... 
---
I agree in a sense. items less then 100m are attainable by all if people work for them and save and attainable by casual players after a long time.
---
on the other hand the average player will never see a twisted bow without buying gold, or getting a lucky drop
---
Theres a button on mobile that turns your inv red, and its 1 click drop. Similar to shift dropping on pc

I wasn't around when the wilderness altar was polled, how the hell did people think that one was going to be a good idea? It's made every other prayer training method obselete, given autists a chance to nut over pking 8 dragon bones, and turned prayer training into a miserable game of 'train at 2am' or 'constantly hop from pkers'. I really do wish they would just take it out of the game.
---
Lmao my first thought when I saw the phone was, "Damn you could play A LOT of mobile on that brick"
---
Okay, let's look at this one step at a time. What makes something BIS? Justiciar gives better def bonuses than bandos, so why don't people boss in justiciar? Because the meta is to have max dps over max defense bonuses. So, with that, whatever gives you the highest dps is BIS. Tbow is BIS because it's higher dps than bp. We still in agreement? Coolio. Now, besides def bonuses, which are established as not being the priority over what is considered BIS, do you know what bcp has over torso? 1 prayer bonus. Which doesn't change dps. So, as far as the primary criteria for what is BIS is, torso is tied with bcp for BIS. Yes, bcp is better in actuality, but acting like higher def bonuses and +1 prayer is the same as the difference between blowpipe and rcb is just being pedantic as hell. 
---
Probably because I've never watched a single quest guide video so I'd have absolutely no way of knowing how many views it has.
---
I got ESO too , got the summerset dlc? and its nice and cool the stetics they have, however, i dont master the "endgame" or stuff like that. Also, needed to creater another characters to understand (again) the mechanics and stuff, but im playing ESO every now and then !
---
Took me almost exactly 6 hours as well lol I blame it on doing it on mobile even though it isnt a good excuse 
---
untrimmed slayer cape. only 1m xp, and on hold right now.
---
Would you be able to answer whether 1def accounts will be able to complete the quest without gaining defense? There is no mention of requirements or rewards that I can find.
---
Holy hell thanks for noticing! It surprised me how much I *needed* to film it that way
---
Dude BCP is in every way ahead of torso but 1 prayer. Do you actually want to argue with me that torso is 100% not bis? 
---
I never said bandos is btw. 
---
I did it last month and it took almost exactly 6 hours haha Felt so good to get it done after the MILLION FUCKING TIMES GETTING KNOCKED OUT.
---
I hear an announcement about something I know nothing about. I then see some old-ass video game on a screen. And then a bunch of dudes screaming and jumping. Still though, I don't know the significance of this.
---
Good guess.
---
I find that to be the easiest one. For some reason I had trouble with the top one, idk autism maybe
---
(x) doubt you definitely, 100% did not get any 99s from daily keys and nothing else that is complete and utter bullshit. You had to train I'd say at least 70% of the skill yourself and even more if it's a harder skill, unless you have the luck of christ and pull only huge smouldering lamps every day and log in every day for like a year lmao. I been lamping prayer for the past 4 months or so, only 1 level 96-97 gained :/
---
I feel like worse since EoC is a bit much but I can't think of any other updates that bad in recent history... But yah, I highly doubt our Menaphos will be like RS3's Menaphos. I mean it may have port, pyramid, Pharoah, and some form of "tombs" but that is about as much as I'd expect.
---
Love the idea. Would it be possible for you to pm that to me as well. Thanks a bunch in advance 
---
What gear were you using? I have 80 range 80 hp 75def and 70 prayer and I’m worried I’m going to run into the same problem.

---
Not by a long shot,  mainland Runescape(I still can't bring myself to say Gielinor) still has some areas unexplored and inaccessible (Priff, Darkmeyer, and huge chunk of desert south which is Menaphos) a lot of quest lines are still unresolved especially important ones such as:  
---
Return of Zaros Quest line  
---
Pirate Quest line
---
The Red Axe Quest series
---
The Mahrajjat Quest line 
---
Desert Quest Story line between Menaphos and Al-Kharid
---
Morytania storyline which thankfully was updated recently.  
---
Glouphrie Storyline which looks like was abandonded by both games.  
---
There's still plenty of crossover left until OS team decides to abandon most of the lore and quest lines built before the great schism.
---
Did we just assume a one of one creatures gender???
---
Literally nobody is saying that bcp isn't BIS, they're saying that the difference between torso and bcp is marginal with NO change in dps(the primary criteria of BIS gear) that torso can be called BIS. If you actually think that calling torso BIS means people think it's better than bcp, I don't know what to tell you. DPS-wise, they are exactly equal chest pieces. 
---
This looks like something I'd see my grandma post on Facebook.
---
In the runelite settings, search "animation smoothing" 
---
Also, Enabling "GPU"  in settings will help bring color and fluidity. This will also allow you to turn on "skybox" if you want the black sky to be different colors (The color matches the scene). You may need a decent graphics card for this to work well, especially at fossil island mushroom meadow.
---
Having a direct connection with your internet will also help prevent frame lags that wifi sometimes may cause.
---
Also, Having a decent CPU may change your smoothness.

It should be removed from the game because it's absolute attrocious game design, not because I find doing other things less efficient.

The op is "krystilia graphical makeover". The point of the post is that krystikia would be improved by changing her to look more like his drawing. My point is that the nature of runescape's render engine doesn't allow anything to look like his drawing. This is clearly a relevant point and considering what the engine is actually capable of generating is clearly relevant when we consider visual changes to the game.

Pretty bad idea to give new players the impression that botting is ok. he made the scripts and used them, then showcased it. What if he botted his main as well.

Oh, I would have expected them to be under a dock

---
Yep you’re right just making sure the grind for graceful sucks and so does the one for recoloring 
---
I'm not overly familiar with the duel arena, but isn't it just as retarded as gambling for profit in real life?  With the tax now in place, it's literally mathematically impossible to win longterm, unless you're getting lots of free odds given to you by dueling people who have inferior stats, which I can't even remember the last time I saw on a stream or anything, especially since the interface now provides a full stat breakdown.  
---
And if you're going for a short term win instead of longterm profit, well then that's even more retarded because presumably that means you're risking a larger percentage of your "roll" per stake.  One of the pillars of playing poker profitably (one of the only forms of profitable "gambling") is to only ever risk tiny amounts of your bankroll at any given time to minimize the risk of going broke.  So staking for a big short term win is an even worse idea. 
---
I think Zulrah is a she-snake because only a bitch can hit you that much and still make you want to see her
---
He didnt tho. I'm sure new players could care less about a guy making trick or treating bots when literally every world is filled with spam bots advertising gold and bots buying out shop stock and bots at yews etc.but yeah dont let new players get the wrong idea. Fuck outta here 
---
Or just right click the item and read which item it is? Or is that a struggle for you too? Sad cunt. 
---
It’s not atrocious. It’s a great way to train, but has a drawback with the chance to be pked. Do you also complain about being killed in wildy when doing clue scrolls?

Nice bait

Oh, well, the original gif is some bar with people watching england vs colombia and they cheer when england scores, but this gif is modified so when the video game footage pops us the crowd starts cheering.

I'm just stuck in my old ways from when I had most important quests done and I want to do what's zero effort before I switch off of mobile. I know I need to quest and skill more. I like to get into modes where I stick to one thing for a few weeks and level that aspect up. This is a fairly new account and basically all I've done so far is the f2p quests, combat, and fremnick trails. I did some things like magic to speed it up for teleports and prayer for obvious reasons. Working on range occasionally for eventually getting firecape. I might be doing things in a slower order than others recommend, but I'm just stuck in my ways I guess. This isnt something I'm doing for glory lol. I like to grind afk while I sit on here or Facebook for a few hours a week. Not sure where people got the idea I'm not willing to quest or that I bought gold lol. I'll do quests eventually, I just hate them on mobile and it's a lot easier to play on my phone than pull out my laptop on a work night.

username checks out i guess lmao

You can make decent money at wintertodt depending on other skills.

What a perfect set up. We'll played. 👏 
---
Why do so many people use rng as a synonym of "luck". They say stuff like "I'm getting some crazy rng".
---
Rng literally stands for random number generator, so it's just the thing that produces a random number which then decides what drop you get. It can't be good or bad, it just is.
---
I'm just confused why people use rng when they actually just mean "luck".

Like I said, Jagex released the anti-interaction timer of 20 minutes because of everyone afking either doing splashing or Guthans in NMZ. They know and have known since the moment they updated it YEARS AGO that people would then afk for 20 minutes (the number they chose) as opposed to 6 hours.

No we're not, we're debating the value of levelling up construction.  The altar is just a part of it.
---
His math was talking about using the house, not specifically for changing spellbooks, it's you who misunderstood and replied to the 300-500 times comment thinking it was only about the altar.
---
for the longest time i didnt think swampletics was worth watching, and i laughed when the lot of you made memes about desperately waiting for the next episode

then i checked out the first episode out of curiosity. 2-3 days later, i was caught up, and the only reason it took that long is because i purposely paced myself.

i'm one of you now. fuck.

Money alts op. Currently range wyvern alt is about 2x the income of gargoyles and 3 less slay levels.

OSRS PvP is excellent. It should be supported, streamed, and given the attention it deserves. There's a difference between PvP and Hunter/Prey, the latter being what the wilderness actually is. PvPers should have spaces to play the game and enjoy their content. Players that don't want to engage in PvP should not be forced into positions in which they have to play as someone else's prey at random, indeterminate intervals. *That* is bad game design. PvPers should be able to enjoy PvP, and people who don't want to engage in it should be able to avoid it. Forcing players to engage with griefers and PvP when they don't want that gameplay experience is toxic.
---
Creating overpowered boss tables, invalidating previous existing skilling methods with overpowered content just to force non-PvPers into the wilderness only compounds that terrible design. Time and time again, Jagex have pushed out ill-concieved updates to try and appease the PvP community, which never seems to have gotten enough. E-Sports and DMM are the future of OSRS PvP, and the game would thrive if PvP updates focused on those, instead of trying to create negative gameplay experiences for a vast majority of players.

You need to talk to iron meme npc outside the last area where you do mage.

It’s just harder to recognize subconsciously because it has 2 elements.  You can’t look for the triangle or the circle because they are both repeated in the other shapes.

You're being pedantic and even then "crazy RNG" still translates to"crazy number generation" such as rolling a 43 on bandos drop table two kills in a row where 43=tassets. The generation of random numbers was crazy

nope. pretty sure that is the same guy parroting this wrong thing every single time, i see this come up fairly often. dude's tryna be too woke when the reality is just way simpler than he's trying to make it. he thinks it's this way because of pre-eoc where they multiplied everyone's hitpoints by 10 and then gave us fractional damage but mod ash has said multiple times it doesn't work that way in osrs.

You could make as much or more in OS with just a couple of runs on Vorkath or Zulrah in that 5 mins. It's usually  1OS:6RS3 and could fluctuate depending on market conditions(bond ration between 2 games) and the Swapper's rates. 600k RS3 is  just 100k OS GP. 100-150k is average loot in Vorkath or Zulrah from what I've seen in some vids for a 1:30 to 2 min run. I find OS easier to make money on tbh. I stopped playing RS3 after maxing and switch to OS after OS mobile beta was released. I've swapped 750m RS3 gp to my OS account for around 125 m OS GP. Spent all that on skilling supplies and  gear and I've made around 100m+ in cash and assets since then. Half from slayer and vorkath and another half from skilling. RS3 skilling is just a gold sink and mostly never profitable or barely.
---
Do quests, try getting each skill and stat to 20  so you can get a good feel for each of them/introduction to the game. Priest in Peril, Goblin Diplomacy and Rune Mysteries are a few easy early ones.

I always search their suggested term on YouTube, click on the video that pops up, open the fake phising runescape forum link in the description and put in fake account details when it asks me to log in. Whatever I can do to waste as much of their time as possible

Sure it could, just more common drops would have multiple numbers assigned to them (Like if it generates a number between 1 and 3,000, then something with a 10% drop rate could be anything between 1-300, then something like a pet could be 301, etc.)   
---
Not sure how it works, and I know there are multiple loot tables (like if you land on the "rare loot table" (Ring of Wealth rare table) it then rolls again to see what item you get from that table) but it's more likely certain drops/tables have multiple numbers assigned to them rather than it going down a very long tier list.

Pretty much, Cerb's ghosts take off too much of your prayer if you don't have spectral, 90 each time he uses the attack. It shreds through your supplies too fast and makes trips so short

Lol dude, you've clearly lived a very sheltered life. I told you to fuck off because your complaints are literally detrimental to the game and you're that offended by it. Get some thick skin if you're gonna be on the internet. 
---
In regards to our disagreement, just look at what removal of the wilderness did to rs2. It almost killed the game. Your idea of the wilderness being "broken" or "garbage" design is just straight bullshit, it was necessary for the game to stay alive.

So with that being said, yes indeed fuck off if you're gonna advocate ruining the game.

You’d have to be genuinely brain dead , I don’t understand 
---
People already camp tough waves with mage prayer using justiciar, nibblers have really low mage defence and once they're dead you just need to get into a safe spot, the armour would just be a trade off of more mage offense and less damage reduction. If you mean camp an entire wave with the armour, and not just the start of it, with how high the monsters in inferno hit you'll run out of supplies very easily if you try that, you'll still need to try to get into a good position in a timely manner to avoid losing supplies.

Which is fine, everyone wants this one. But I've seen waves back during Dragon Slayer 2 which was upsetting.

Clearly there’s something going on if all these people are getting hacked. I shouldn’t have to browse the web like I’m patrolling IED territory in Iraq.  I got hacked too a few days ago and have pretty good security too. Unique passwords for everything I use (no I don’t use the same password for anything) 2FA on my email, RuneScape. You can’t even log into my email unless I accept the login request on my phone. A bank pin. So how did the hackers navigate around all that?  Also I’d like to add they logged in in between about a 10 time period where my internet went out (almost looks like to me i got session hijacked, which shouldn’t even be possible but i have no idea what jagex has to defend against that), they logged in, cleared my bank, and when I logged in suddenly everything was gone.  Jagged security is shit and they’re official response is “we can’t help you if you’ve been hacked.” It’s a flawed system that I think needs more light to be shined upon.

Meet /u/nbahoward, my Youtube/reddit locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently getting whooshed in the Youtube comments section I decided to come to reddit and complain about it.

You dont need veracs for any of the wildy bosses, range is fine for venenatis, bear task slayer helm with tent is better than veracs, and vetion doesnt need it.  Besides you dont risk anything if you know how to not get smited and bring 3 ppots

All you need for kbd is a crossbow and dhide if you're scared to fight the actual wildy bosses..

On the topic of resource areas that requires a fee to access... Sure, why not

You should check out the official runescape forums, there are plenty of skilling/social clans you could probably join just for people to hang out with.
---
Also, just a heads up... F2P is like a trial account on most other MMO's. You can get a feel for the game and decide if it's something you'd be interested in or not, but if you end up liking it then you're going to want members ASAP. Everything is quicker/easier as a member and you unlock a plethora of new content :P

Tbh id use the free member trial on mobile first. Gives you a week. Doing certain quests will boost your stats way higher and faster than conventional training.

Alright I’ll take my ass elsewhere want to borrow my tinfoil hat before I leave ?
---
Why would they wear it, isn't it ineffective anyway? 
---
Probably 80s for combat/range id say? I imagine at the point of all the reqs youd be close to that anyway. So probably should be okay. I think ds2 will be my next "goal" to go for lol. Finishing up mm2 now and ill have 202 qp, so other than a few other needed quests i really should do by now (prob stuff like roving elves, mournings end) I think that'll be next up for me. 
---
But i may wait until i decide to get void since you sorta need that to farm vorkath anyway.

No they only will attack you if you attack them. But you have to attack them before jad gets back to full hp otherwise they will respawn again. So you have to either kill them or tank them. I tanked them

That's literally like saying, "Just because dragons breathe fire in other games that doesn't mean they have to in osrs." The mimic is a classic monster the same as a dragon. You expect one to behave a certain way. Unless you are going for some avant garde weirdo shit, there are rules to be followed.

Haha well if you put it that way..

See heres the thing. Hcim and uim have some misunderstanding that grinds me. YOU ARENT GONNA HAVE "SAFE" ACCESS TO EVERYTHING. CONTENT WILL BE DIFFERENT FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU CHOSE A TO PLAY THAT GAME MODE. seriously though. Thats the point of hcim is that you cant do everything a normal account can do "SAFELY." Why are so many hellbent on removing the risks of hcim? Like thats the point of the game mode..hardcore for a reason.. Shit in other games hardcore usually means you lose your entire account. Just play a normal ironman or non restricted account if you wanna farm wildy bosses without losing status. 
---
Its ridiculous that so many im/hcim/uim expect the game to cater to them with updates or change current content. If they start doing that then wow..bad move. Its the whole fucking point of being a hcim lol. You can go into wildy if you want. But yes it wont be safe. Thats the risk of playing that mode. You chose that risk. Quit trying to make it so that you have no risk. Guess what you dont NEED a d pick anyways. Use rune if you dont wanna take the plunge. Or man up and do it then flex it. Seriously man people who choose a game mode because of the restrictions then come up with suggestions to remove the restrictions irritates the hell out of me.

just another spade for you to lose in the wildy

---
Do all f2p quests especially vampire slayer and dragon slayer 1. Get membership and do water fall quest, tree gnome village, grand tree,  fight arena and  monkey madness. Do not train melees except through quest xp rewards. You should be able to get to 40+ atk str def with just those quests and skip all the early melee training. All those quests can be done easily because you have protection prayers and high mage and range to safe spot bosses too. 
---
I would get 3 months membership and work towards either killing vorkath or zulrah. Zulrah has less requirements imo and you could maintain bonds easily because those are 2M+/HR 
---
You’ve heard wrong, it would probably be more like 20 hours. Cannonballs is Super AFK as you only need to interact with your account like 25 times an in hour, so it decent if you are busy with other stuff and aren’t actually playing the game.
---
There are lots of things you can do though for 500k+ per hour at lower levels! You can make steel bars at blast furnace, at 44 Runecrafting you can make nature runes, a lot of the diaries give access to daily moneymakers, such as battlestaves in varrock and there are thing like Birdhouse and Farming Herb runs that are passive moneymakers.
---
As you get higher levels, all sorts of high gp/hr content becomes available, and you will start being able to earn a bond in anywhere from 2 hours for a bond, all the way up to an average of 3 bonds per hour when you’re nearly maxed and able to do things like Theatre of Blood
---
Wot
---
I do. That's pretty impressive
---
Lol ? 
---
lmao. Any dev can add a dragon into a game that doesn't breathe fire. Let Runescape adapt something that makes sense for the game. Imagine fighting something at the end of a clue scroll for no reward. The only rule that needs to be followed is what makes sense for the game. 
---
Is he a popular OSRS streamer? Just saw that post and he seems like an asshole
---
So when i get membership, the first thing i should focus on is getting b gloves, torso, fire cape dragon defender and get the important quests done. In the meantime i should focus range. I think i should train prayer when i get membership cause its too expensive and there are no prayer pots in f2p so they prayer wont last long anyways. Thanks for the info! 
---
 I finished it a week ago. Pretty simple just takes a bit. Got 400kc at demonic gorillas and got 5 zenyte shard drops and made 60m in just 2 days. New favorite gold making method for sure.
---
Mining gives more potential for profit than fishing or woodcutting. Runite ore and amethyst are significantly more valuable. I dont think I support this, but if you were to pitch the golden nuggets reasonably I'd suggest doing some maths on the current value of these.
---
Current gold nugget value is 946gp, if I recall you pitched 500-800 nuggets as a price. This would give the pickaxe an equivalent value of 756,800gp at a cost of 800 nuggets. I dont feel this is reasonable based on the risk/reward factor of wildy bossing. 
---
To take a current market value of 5m-6m i'd place the price at 5000-7000 golden nuggets which would take place across 182400-255474 paydirt mined, or 6514-9124 inventories if dropping all gems. This would be 11,172,000-15,647,782 total mining xp from *paydirt* so there would be additional xp from cleaning too.
---
This is completely unrealistic so it wouldnt be possible to implement without crashing prices, it would probably also bring a lot of bots in to train for dpics. 
---
I understand the idea but dont think its viable, it currently suits its position. Also no reason to have it as a slayer reward, rune pouch is used extensively in slayer, d pic is not
---
I haven’t played this game for 2 years, can someone fill me in on who this guy is? 
---
MST?
---
Yeah i have to get it done sooner or later. I just dont like running around so much so i just kinda ignored it.

Awesome work! Care to share the link?

Did all the f2p quests. And i cut some yews when i got bored of melee training. 
---
Drift wood?

No I do not think this is what happened. If someone logs into my email from somewhere else besides my phone or desktop. my phone will start exploding with alerts. I've done it before when i logged into my email from the apple store. And it will show a history of that IP address in my email settings. Nobody got into my email address. I don't think. I am very confident.
---
What happened is a made a new friend in runescape. and I told him when i made my account, and where i lived. he used that information to submit a account recovery request, and it was approved. Somehow. So he changed the email address to his email without anything being sent to me first. So the scam was a phishing scam where someone was friends with me in game and i foolishly revealed personal information to him.

My password hasn't been changed though. I wonder if he was able to log in. How would he know my password though. This password is unique to runescape. I don't think hes logged into the account yet. I think hes just changed the email address... How did he do that without the password though? Does jagex approve account recoveries without password if you have date of account creation and physical location?

Have you ever driven a car? There is no "right time" you fucking imbecile. People like you are cancerous af. Pisses me off so fucking hard reading shit like this. Fuck you.

This wild and would love a pm

Boy oh boy, I sure wish I could go back to gen ed. They seem like a waste of time (and some of them definitely are) but college can get pretty brutal after your first year or two, so savor the free time while you still have it
---
I used to be a daily gamer like you until I took a reservoir rock properties class to the head. Now I'm a husk of a man who's replaced my soul with knowledge.
---
It’s highly unlikely he has cape anyway so his moaning is even more pointless 😂
---
Salve ei bro

I’m dead 😂😂😂
---
I love it.
---
The boss is already insanely campable and high gp/hr. Allowing veng just means an increase to this. Probably just balancing
---
He looks way too ripped to be rocking that guthans body
---
&gt; super strong defensive armour without negative range or mage offensive stats? 
---
What's the big deal with this anyways? What do you want? Barrows helmets and Justiciar are only -2 range. How big of a deal do you think that is? (I'll tell you, it's basically nothing).
---
Then there's Justiciar with -20 range for the platebody and -17 for the legs. Is that a lot? Yes. Because of the negative bonus? Not really. But because you're also missing out on the +33 and +20 from Armadyl chest and legs. Then we have the Twisted Bow alone that maxes out near +150 range bonus, by itself. And you're freaking out thinking +/- 10 is a big deal lol, I just don't get it.
---
&gt; This devalues skills earned through practice to be able to these things  in the first place and it's a step in the wrong direction for the game. 
---
as someone that got an infernal cape in the first month of release, it's not that big of a deal
---
*This isn't that kind of fantasy game*
---
I genuinely forgot he even existed until I saw that clip posted here. IcePoseidon and Runescape don't really go together anymore, and they haven't for quite some time now.
---
I do some flips sometimes, just runes and food with 3-4 gp margins. I cant do big flips when you just leave an offer for an expensive item and do training and come back after an hours or so then do it again. Most of the item my offer doesnt buy. I just need some practice i guess
---
Sorry man I didn’t help enough that run. Can I still get like a 10m split? Thanks m9
---
If I was to provide my input, I would say that either the cape or arrow slot would be a great place to put a quiver. Also, since it's long range is the most significant part of the bow, slightly boosting damage and accuracy might be a good route to go.  There may be more creative routes like applying a poison or something, but I'm not too sure what good that kind of thing would do.

Thanks, I'm thinking Jad next!

What would it be though ? Mini dharok walking around behind ya lol

Also has either bgloves or ferocious gloves.

OPs dumb and jealous.

thank u

Can I also get a golden sextant
---
LMAO smackdown
---
Yes, with an option to select which brother you want it to be. 
---
The quickest would be quests. One small favour helps with the fire strikes, it's the best magic you can use until ibans blast.
---
Ibans blast is the best until trident of seas.
---
For money: crafting dragonhide armour/smithing armour and either selling it to the ardougne west general store or high alching it is a good way for money.
---
But I would suggest thieving for consistent coin. Get rogue outfit for double pickpocket. 55-99 at knights (make opal necklaces for thieving).
---
Thanks!
---
Their point is even people who have a g altar use hosted houses because it saves the hassle of lighting the burners yourself. Making burners easier to keep lit is less incentive for people to do that, so less income for house hosts
---
I don't know man seems weird to have them walking behind, but each to their own I suppose 
---
Probably cus you were more used to the grind at that point, I've noticed the same thing with getting 99s once I've hit level 90
---
Only if it had no walking animation
---
B-but that snake. I can’t beat that damn snake. 
---
Should go to slayermusiq instead 
---
Is it any more weird than having Commander Zilyana following you :P
---
:(
---
Not really, collector is arguably the most click intensive, since there's always something to do. The other roles all have waves that they just afk and wait for others to finish. 
---
Barrows is super easy on my main. But I mean my account is nowhere near able to do Barrows yet lol
---
Nah I'm not, i just did research into male suicide and found a vast amount wrong with society 
---
That’s dope. Thanks for the info.
---
I did motherlode mine as one of the first things on my iron years ago. Made brackets and alched them for mage exp, and 100k profit every 1k gold bars.
---
Was slow, only got like 25k exp per bracket but I got to around mid 50's just from that, then went to do chsrters later on until glory. 
---
Say for example buying feathers in port sarim. The default stock is 1000. If someone comes in and buys 200 feathers it will go to 800 but result like 1-2 feathers every second until it gets to 1000. If you sell feathers and the amount is above 1000 (say 1500 feathers) and now Ironmen cannot purchase feathers from that shop because it is “overstocked” the same thing happens with emeralds in the shop OP is talking about but that time period for deplete/replenishing the stock is much longer than 1-2 seconds
---
But she only helped her ex with his dick
---
Probably also since you unlock higher xp/hr actions to do. For most skills anyway.
---
“Weird game” I felt that. 
---
like what the fuck people just stay for the rest of the round it takes like 5 minutes, if you don't need the points ask to switch to another role or something, most of the time at least one person accommodates you.

You've got to be kidding me. I've been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can.

knowing every single answer to recovery questions i set in 2005 was not enough for me to get my account back... how i know this? i wrote the answers on paper in 2005 and kept them.. all the answers were atleast 10 characters and had numbers in them. However knowing 4 previous passwords granted access to the account... pretty weird id say

Names taken. Or I’d make it happen for you

Practice on unrestricted worlds and use zulrahguide.uk

Honestly my favourite as its clearly the easiest.

Are there any YouTube channels recently making osrs facts, hidden knowledge/trivia, mythbusters-esque videod? Seems like all that is released these days is ironman progress videos.

Just leave the gate "opened" in P2P Worlds?

Follow a quest line online. If they do mention a NPC search him up on Google. If they mention a Location you can search that Location in your map.

For the travel part its usually done by amulets and teletabs. Just look them up

Might have to install that lol. What phone do you have?

Depends, I have 95 slayer and hate doing boss tasks. So I wouldn't do them, but if you really want to do it make sure you look up guides and be very careful in the wilderness.

For me its not a matter of "mobile or pc", I prefer pc in all cases but theres a lot of hours in the day where I do have free time but dont have a pc available. In those cases being able to do afk grinding on mobile is great

I have no doubt this will be a feature in prifdinas, a similar feature exists in rs3 and came with the same expansion

even if they added this, naked 0 value players will still be killed by pkers because of the potential that they are a scout for another team.

Naw, he usually brings in 4 level 3 accounts, and begs for a level 5 healer to carry him.  One of the main reasons I hate him, personally.

Not sure if anyone can give you a more substantial answer than probably not, but if you're really concerned you could try submitting a ticket on the website. That way if you do get hit with a macro ban you can point to your ticket as evidence that you tried to work with them.
---
And if that fails you can just post a sob story on Reddit or Twitter and probably get someone to appeal it.

Reminds me of my first day playing. It was 2002 and I just got off tut island. This level 20 something told me to give him the stuff I received from tut island and he would make me a r2h. I had heard people at school talk about them so they had to be good, right? Yeah he took all my shit even the sleeping bag I had looted.

Small profit is very good to start with, and once you get members it's even better with the item choice. I struggle with large flips myself, so only do small occasianly. Goodluck on the acc when your members!!

Sounds pretty good honestly, more content for f2p that members dont use is maximum utility for all players.

Thanks for the advice man but I'm looking for another pure build to mess around with in the wilderness.

I'm not advocating for rwt by any means, but most gold sites will do it for you for a small like 5% fee.

they are just not funny
---
How come may I ask? Is that fun? Everytime someone tried to PK me using just defensive items in the WILD while doing clues or something, they just waste their time. I've never been killed and I've had at least 30 minutes of combat on me, why? Go kill the bosses that we're all training to do. They are where the money is

[The wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Cerberus/Strategies) has a great breakdown. I'd consider selling the bcp if you're short on gold, replacing with fighter torso or a barrows chest.

Theres no realistic way for me to get Justiciar, I play the game with a White Scim. My account is essentially permanerfed but that was my kind of my intention.

TBH I'm mostly a clue scroll ironman, I just added some RP elements to make it more enjoyable for myself. Maximum autism.

Agreed. She is extremely immature, can't believe a fellow Lithuanian fell for that ugly bait smh
---
Nice.
---
Why did you delete your reply? 
---
cries in low combat stats
---
If you have an infernal cape then you should have enough brain cells to realise that JUSTICIAR HAS NEGATIVE OFFENSIVE MAGE AND THIS DOESNT. This literally makes getting an infernal cape so much fucking easier as you have the tankiness of justiciar without the -77 magic offense, so you wont splash on nibblers. Literally fucking autistic armour.
---
what did you lose?
---
Dude there's literally 4 puzzles, and the answers never change. How can't you be bothered to learn 4 answers? It'll take you under a minute.
---
If you have barrows gloves or feel comfortable switching to mage void then those should suffice. You have the toxic trident and that’s a big req. unrestricted worlds if you don’t want to spend the money on learning. If you have the agility level you can just teleport to your house and use a fairy ring to go back after each attempt since you have pool. That is the method I used to learn. 
---
Its unlocked to f2p in rs3 if you want to check it out
---
I would say they're worth it without fm xp because of wintertodt's rates. If you do all the fossil displays in the museum you get 100k+ worth of xp lamps which is a nice bonus you can do in &lt;10 hours of mushrooms.
---
Lvl 14 at circle no?
---
I had to chuckle at this one, good one OP. 
---
Anyone who is struggling with zulrah, I suggest you to go an unrestricted world with max stats and use void with 4 switches as well as max gear i.e. ring of suffering, pegasians/eternals. Try and learn the first 2 phases first, if zulrah doesnt turn red and start the melee phase right after the initial green phase leave and go back until it does. These 2 phases are similar and will take you a max of 20 kills to get the hang of. Then go and learn the other 2 phases, will probably take you 2-4 hours with 0 supplies invested and you will know how to survive/get a few kills at zulrah. Dont be discouraged by deaths, pro people with 30k+ kc still die at zulrah and died when they started. After you get to about 100-200 kc it will become 2nd nature and at 1000kc youll be absolutely fluent. What really helped me is every time zulrah spawns in the middle you have to move to the other side cos it will spawn venom clouds, but every mechanic you will get used to.

[Collecting mort myre fungi](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Collecting_mort_myre_fungi)
---
If you're referring to all the mushrooms, someone might have been botting on your account to mass gather and sell them.
---
Just my guess, but usually that sort of thing means your account was being used as a throwaway bot account.
---
Not sure then sorry man. I know when i was but a noob I got hacked for like 5mil which really hurt at the time. I have no idea how they did it but the day it happened i'd been bullying splashers in lumbridge with my cat. One of them said something aggressive about how I needed to stay out of peoples business and the next time I logged in i'd been hacked. 
---
Everyone on reddit said the usual about how i was a dimwit etc. I had all the security features enabled and luckily they couldnt get through my pin so I only lost my fury and the black mask in my slayer helm plus some shitty ranged gear. Account hadnt been recovered and my email was secure, I also log in with a username so they had no way of knowing my email address. 
---
Don't mean to bore you but I swear if the wrong people target your account it seems they can access it if they wish. Ever since i've always logged out naked and change my bank pin quite consistently.
---
A option to adjust the cb levels you get set as bountry targets if you op for a max of 10cbs higher, you'll also find someone else 10cb levels lower, but only if they opt to find 10cbs higher like you have.
---
I like that a lot.
---
Better than having to wait up to 5 minutes at a time between targets.
---
Imo bh needs way more special effect rewards than anything cosmetic. (Bounty hunter tele scroll is a perfect example)
---
Yes
---
Counter suggestion - Nostalgia goggles. When worn makes everyone look like a classic character.
---
Yeah its quite upsetting and extremely demotivating. It's never happened and I'm not stupid with my account but I guess my discord may have been hacked but even that would flag to an email which it never.
---
They do have the same magic bonus, however. 
---
If you didnt have all of the fungi yourself then like the others have said, using it to bot. I'm assuming you have morytania diaries done so its the most efficient way to collect them
---
Especially since it's such good entertainment and all.
---
Finally a reddit notification that was worth checking
---
Well, but the bots would just be at whatever does make that money then. It doesn't actually solve the problem, it just moves it somewhere else.
---
If this happens to me I just dig with my spade and it cancels out the screen.
---
Yeah i can't think of to much to that effect.
---
Because you don't want anything that would give a advantage over someone who doesnt have it.
---
Woodcutter you don't understand, I'm going to lumbridge and I need your strongest axe

How long would it take to get to zulrah? or what would u recommend?

Oh I didn’t include that in my email. Is that why jagex locked me out of my account?

After hacking an account, they’ll try to bot out the account to essentially “dry it up” and later banned. Before the bot is banned, they were going to transfer all botted items on your account to one of theirs

Would probably be dead content in f2p too. So far from a bank, people would just kill the ones outside varrock.

It always just felt like a waste of supplies. You both eat an inventory of food and use all your potions then teleport out. Like what a fucking waste of time.

Maybe it’s different now a days with more spec weapons

Crackhead?

I thought I risked it for the biscuit by typing "k, no, or yes". Like those are my three responses if I have to respond asap.

You don't really need to visit a bank often when training with Dark Wizards. Their drops are mostly runes which are stackable.
---
yes rune crossbow works too, buy something like ruby bolts (e) for that, broad bolts might be a little bit slow
---
he was botting mushrooms you'll probably get banned
---
u just got outlawed
---
They log out. Get in trouble at school and aren't allowed to use the computer for a couple of weeks. Once those two weeks are up, they've already built new interests. They log on quickly, but that drive to play isn't there for them any more. You're offline, but they take a look at your name. They remember the good times, and wish they could say why they're gone.
---
They log off, turn off the computer, then go outside

But that’s not what I plan on raising

I am basing this on the WR poins/hr runs I’ve seen: you use every boss. You need to bring a range wep, grab secateurs, pickaxe, antifire shield from the ground. Kill everything. 
---
Because mobile will not influence the main game.
---
Alternative option seems the way to go cause u need 500 more clues??

Not bad, but fuck those WoW shoulder plates. I can't explain how much I hate those things.

Just got 2 items from 4 barrows runs today. Maybe it got buffed?:))

Pretty ridiculous you can make more money this way than a normal job.

sounds like a you problem

I got 6 leaf bladed swords in one task of 100-something kurasks
---
Next time. Bank pin, complicated password.
---
I agree. Maybe they could give 300% boost without marrentils and 350% with. Would still make no sense not to just use marrentils, but it could interesting for people who are bad at lighting or so.
---
God that cat is majestic as fuck
---
I think I'd prefer a smaller amount, but a lower boost unless you also use herbs. So 300% without herbs and 350% with marrentils.
---
He'll probably start streaming Swampletics when the long grinds arrive
---
If you were to also introduce agility to f2p it’d make a good mining area run. So close to Falador West bank. 
---
Nah you don't get it. He's such an expert that he is doing an extremely difficult challenge run few could ever complete, so difficult that it challenges even him and took him a whole 2 tries.
---
I was hoping this too! 
---
I’m currently doing this grind. Started at 57 and did oak larders to 66 for teak benches and then am doing teak benches to 83 with demon butler. All in I’ll have spent around 26m. Could save some money with doing oak all the way, I just don’t know how much. 
---
Wait, classic isn't officially supported anymore? When did this happen?
---
I know but I’m in too deep
---
Also not having a gate block my way to taverly dungeon would be nice. 
---
You know that thing wont stay open soooo.......mY tIcK rAtE pLs.
---
You break even if you burst dust devils. You need 65 slayer for that, though.
---
twisted wand chest death??
---
nah inferno shouldn't be completed with the play making multiple mistakes through their run.
---
Every big private server already has that except you do it through a menu you can access anywhere
---
Can we add some MTX/Xp lamps to as well? With Mobile out it'd def help bring in more players. 
---
You could always combine it with slayer. It might be a good idea to get str to high 80s or something though. I did so at least. There are no requirements except some bosses need their respective quest first in order to be unlocked. Watch a guide on yt, theres plenty 
---
banned for rwt

Yad, what are you doing here
---
Ask for an easier task.
---
You could easily kill hespori with base 50s, a full inv of decent food and some rune/dhide, with overheads too. give it a shot if you get a seed, I dont think he goes away if you die and you can get stuff back
---
Hey look, you even got fire runes to alch yourself
---
Ah I see.
---
In that case, I reckon they should add Resting/Musicians into the F2P world like they have in RS3.

Happy Swampletics day btw.

Rune essence count?

Just FYI, once you reach Kruks lair, you can use an exit tunnel, which allows you to skip the rest of Kruk's dungeon when you come back to fight him.
---
It’s a iPhone no back bottom the center button just closed the app
---
You realize all that shit is endgame content and I’m talking about my very first 5 minutes of playtime, right?
---
Is there anyway to find out what these # usernames once corresponded to?
---
Maybe, but it's probably better to give something like rooftop agility training or low level slayer if you're going to move p2p content to f2p. 
---
I think it's best to just give overall content like obor to f2p when it's implemented into the game. If it doesn't break the meta and fits it can just be in both. 
---
There are some decent ideas for low level content like beginner scrolls that would benefit both modes assuming they're cosmetic rewards. If the rewards are tradable it's also help people buy a bond if that's what's holding them back, just don't have it drop runs scims, powers, or a new best in slot. Something like an ornament kits for those items or a ring to +1 to defenses would be fine in my opinion
---
how about a Holy Dragon?

It's a meme here, but nice try at assessing someone's whole life based on one post. I guarantee you get just as excited about things in life. I just hope it's not oatmeal and car insurance for you. Ask your doctor if Swampletics is right for you.
---
Ohh, I never really saw what that icon was. Some kind of grimy tide pods
---
Wow I really hit a nerve didn't I? You know there's an entire world outside of your virtual one? 
---
Interesting picks of car insurance and oatmeal though, il give you that.
---
Not sure if this is meant as a /s comment but it's another generic battle royale game.
---
I know what happened I’m just annoyed there isn’t anyway to close it out apparently. 
---
I enjoy questing and like the cut scenes of quests and would like to troubleshoot this for next time 
---
Having any skill.
---
Player killing.
---
Pick one pleb. 
---
True, but healer and especially defender are tedious to do, only truly semi afk role is attacker
---
Fucking hell how did I not know that swampletics is shortened from swamp athletics. 
---
Yes, my life sucks so in order to make myself feel better I comment on others life to make there's seem equally as shitty, there for giving my life more meaning.
---
Sounds as stupid when I say it as when you say it eh?
---
You know you still get more membership this way in a year? If you guys want this change they would change every month and you would be fucked big time. 
---
You fucktards never think everything trough.

Raspact the wahmen.

---
In my opinion we should have the same options like pc. Maybe open a little keypad in a dialog with numbers and spacebar so we can skip like on pc
---
That’s a bit redundant 
---
Eternal glory and a quest cape
---
Yep, pretty funny 
---
Why not both :-/
---
There are rumblings of Jagex making Agility F2P so stepping over that crumbled wall would be a good addition/use. That's a pretty good iron mining spot if you intend to bank.
---
Ultimate god cape dump
---
You tried to sound smart but you sound just as stupid and unhappy as you did in the original comment, that was a good try though! Let people enjoy what they want and don't worry about it, worry about yourself big guy. 
---
i believe they did but im too lazy to find it
---
Unfortunately rotation lock doesnt have any effect on my mate 10 pro ☹️
---
They recently added ogress and they kinda broke the meta on nature/law farming along with alchables. The only thing that will get people to kill other monsters than ogress, obor, bryoph, and afking crawlers/spiders is low level slayer or another boss with unique drops. 
---
thats hilarious. you could grief blue dragon farmers with the gate
---
Devalues Burtherley, my Burthrope and Taverly HCIM
---
Do I HAVE to Dharoks for NMZ Points grinding? I’m 99/99/99. Can’t I just whip out my whip with (almost) BiS melee gear and dish out damage faster? Can someone do the math?! 
---
No. If you dont want to go in the wildy, use a rune pick. Theres no reason to devalue all the hcim who have a dpick bc of some pansies who are afraid of pkers.
---
Training is probably your best bet. Even though I would say you have the stats for DS2 (with a bit of luck) because it's mostly ranged combat. 
---
Once you get a few more levels you might want to try out some of the bosses. Vorkath from DS2 is good money and is pretty exciting when you're learning to kill it.
---
More of a replica server guy :)
---
Dont think it was about being insecure or not. Combination of Rune Platebody, Dragon Med helm and Dragon platelegs was simple sick and made you look like totalk chad.
---
Same I had, made an ironman currently only 1090 total but really enjoying it
---
Yes you're right, it's not instanced. If you die you can just pick your items right back up, normally. Dying in the same tick as the boss messed it up.
---
It’s easy, just get 55 magic, 5 fire runes and 1 nature rune and alch urself m8
---
I mean they are probably spinning at the ge while going for account number 7.
---
Squad up ReeEeeEeeeeeEeeee
---
RuneScape and the other RuneScape.
---
I agree with this 100%
---
Okay Mr key board warrior, defender of the subreddits.
---
Where's prayer flick
---
So nice to be seeing “J-Mod reply” in the flair again, u/Mod_Kieren . I feel like it’s something that died when Ayiza left the team, hope you guys start to bring it back!
---
Pretty sure Rune essence mine is part of abyss
---
You can try the shop in keldagrim, I imagine it’s much less popular 
---
Trouble brewing f2p when?
---
As someone who is returning to OSRS, can someone explain the significance of this ‘Swampletics’ thing?
---
10 zenyte in 1k kc on main, 5 in 900 on iron. Can't seem to get a tail though...
---
I was in the same boat. Couldn't find vampires to save my life. Then I tried nightmare zone for the first time and realized Count Draynor counted towards slayer task. 
---
Nah you're coming off as one of those smug hipster fucks.  Like the kind of person who feels the need to constantly bring up how they think Marvel movies aren't that good.  99% of the time no one asked and no one cares.  You just look like an ass bringing it up 
---
settled-sama 😩
---
my question is, did u gain or lose?
---
More like they probably had 1 physical server with literally 0 maintenance whatsoever, didn't even reboot it. Also had an estimated ~2k players(paying members) a month iirc. Only cost of it should be the power. I'm sure they could theoretically be making more from that power, but it likely ran a net positive for them. 
---
Actually ban-able just for the record. Though likely nothing would happen unless you constantly harassed the same person or they were a popular streamer. Since they have the real power in this game
---
If it's balanced well, it's not easyscape at all, it was a fantastic skill (just plenty different than other skills)
---
lmfao so im not the only one lool
---
Yes but no
---
I started reading this comment like smash mouth
---
Imagine fucking a shrek
---
What herbs should I be running for the most profit? (Thanks!!)
---
Most likely a snap, it's not hard to grasp.
---
🤙🏼😂
---
Gotem
---
Correct.
---
It's not different, though. And you could still just drink a bunch of absorption pots and be afk for 1+ hours before, Guthan's wasn't required.
---
You sound like the people who swears every year that Jagex will remove tick manipulation. Removing imbues or putting it behind a quest is not the same as nerfing NMZ btw. Nobody afk's NMZ for the points and you'd want to afk at crabs to the lvl needed for dream mentor anyways. You might be right tho, that enough sweaty toxic nerds have achieved high combat skills through afking NMZ that they'd be fine with polling a nerf just to screw over other players. 
---
RuneLite
---
What if it's actually just three different snakes?
---
I got one after 20 kills today, it was my first cave horror task
---
Thanks for the detailed reply, I've been training Slayer recently, up to 53 atm but need to get back to questing and getting untradeables (no defender, d scim, or fire cape yet, yikes). [Here's my stats](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/hiscorepersonal.ws?user1=c%20offeescape), think I'm ready?
---
The Americans and North Koreans combined, what could be worse......
---
People here don't actually like this game. That's the only answer I can come up with. They think they like it, but for some reason they think nearly everything is broken and needs fixing asap despite functioning fine for almost 20 years
---
Looks fat
---
All bossess max qp for best pts/hr
---
Go kill zammy warriors, they're safespottable, have only 50 hp and a 1/50 drop rate for scim. Better in every way
---
Dude that’s two attacks on the same tick, terrifying stuff.
---
Goodbye. 
---
Got few bosses with him while completing diary. Didn't see him as a asshole tbh. 
---
I always stay below 30, never know when a clan might log in. I find it’s better in the morning when there’s a lot less people online 
---
Jagex can and should not make official gamemodes based off these arbitrary playstyles. 
---
First off it's impossible to actually create and support them all. Secondly, by doing so they're essentially encouraging their players to ignore massive amounts of content they've developed and will develop in the future. Not to mention that seemingly insignificant changes could heavily impact these playstyles. 
---
I have been thinking about creating an ironman. The idea that every drop counts and you're actively working towards gear is kinda appealing. Would mean that you actually appreciate items like rune or dragon; rather than just skipping ahead and missing out on old content.
---
Yea lets hack an account only to merch on it. 
---
Could be a cool part of a quest! There are already too many kinds of dragons for farming
---
I woke up and thought the same but I’m GMT+3 so I got sad and have to wait until Thursday
---
Honestly a new agility method behind a GM quest wouldn't be that unbalanced, as long as it isn't super AFK or high XP
---
Yall gay
---
wasn't actually up though and as I said, there'd be a message box from it saying that "did you enjoy your experience" kind of thing
---

---
And my cheap ass rocked a skirt for a while until I could get legs

---
Imo barrows is one of the better entries, but it's not hard if you seek a challenge. But it's quite enjoyable with solid loot. Very good gp from runes if you have hard morytania diary 
---
2007: this looks so cool, i wonder what monsters lurks here!
---
2019: BRUH THIS SHIT ISN'T EFFECIENT ENOUGH DEAD CONTENT -_-
---
I'd prefer it this way, rather than not making it at all (until 2015)
---
&gt;And since theres no option to cancel the contract, they are basically over for me for a long time.
---
Boy do we have news for you lol
---
Watercolor? Or animated water color? I can't tell the difference anymore.
---
For real, PKers could rally to take that 25 percent no if they coordinated an effort
---
Thanks dude
---
This is more like 5 hours of progress tbh
---
Doesn't matter, he will get recovered. If he didn't have the acc for a year+ then recovery is inevitable. 
---
The steps you listed will absolutely keep a secure account secure but once an account stops being secure, it can never be made secure again. Security is like virginity- the account is made with it, but once you lose it, you can never ever get it back no matter what you do. 
---
Monkey nut paste 😩😩
---
I'll check this out and post results once I get hp cape :) 
---
It’s true it is. I’d just like to use it on kurask and turoth tasks. 
---
Have you ever used DPS calcs? Full elite void range is better than Armadyl at all rooms+head besides mystics/vespula. Void Melee is exactly 3,33% less DPS than max bandos (9.95 dps vs 10.29). I'm not sure if you guys have any clue how percentages work, but saying it's 10-15% is just ridiculous lmfao. Also, Elite Void mage+eternals = 7.74 Mage DPS, MAX ancestral+arcane is 8.20 DPS, that makes Max ancestral+arcane 5,6% DPS increase over VOID. Ahrims+Torm brace is about the same DPS as elite mage void +eternals.

Well yeah that's why nothing can be done at this point. Holiday items are pointless now except to give a free 100k profit to people who do christmas events.
---
Where did I compare the 2? All I’m saying is you don’t need your eyes glued to the road every single second. I’m talking about taking your eyes off the road to mess with your radio, AC, mirrors or whatever because that guy I replied to said you don’t need to take your eyes off the road or hands off the wheel to do any of those. 
---
You should be fine.
---
Also theres zero reason to tweet the support account. 
---
Okay thanks. I think I have the ones from last year tho so I’ll check if any new ones
---
Its not so bad, should be about 30 hous
---
So true. His videos really make me want to start an ironman but whenever he goes through the actual hours required I remember my main still doesn't even have a skill above 90 and that I'm so casual with the game I could never split my time between two accounts. 
---
I made friends with someone playing WoW years ago, we used to chat a lot, set challenges for one another, etc, she'd been battling cancer for years at this point, never beating it but never losing either
---
A lot of time went past, I stopped playing and we ended up not speaking for a while, I logged into my battlenet last month and was heartbroken to see she hadn't logged in in two years.
---
So I messaged her, and two weeks later, shes still there! Still not beating it, but still kicking as ever, I guess a happy enough end
---
Hey sorry if this is a noob question but I see a lot of posts with screens like this. What am I looking at? Is this a 3rd party software? 
---
Just curious, how does One small favour help with fire strike?
---
These days I’m lucky to play 5min per day
---
I was in the same boat until about a week and a half ago. I watched one video, then another, then I caught up in one sitting. Totally worth. 
---
I don't think there is. It's probably people who got hacked and took Jagex several days to restore their account access, and by that time it was too late.
---
On that note though, there should at least be an email sent when someone logs in from a new location, as well as for requesting a PIN change.
---
Okay thx
---
smart, im starting my dd grind soon and ill make sure i remember to do that
---
Have at it
---
A friend had such a successful career on RS but he threw it all in the trash. A friend is not the brightest of people.
---
Well yah can't. 
---
Um I'd just add papayas, calquats, mahogany, redwood, and hespori to your farming.  It's all cheap
---
not sure if you know but Void Melee is more accurate than max bandos. Elite Void mage is again, more accurate than Ahrims, even ancestral. Not sure if you are litearlly bnraindead or not, but learn how to use a dps calc please. 
---
Lots of people skip them
---
Would I be wrong in saying this account looks like it's selling a bunch of stuff from a bot farm? I would trade that gp to a new acc and never look back
---
Hahaha it's all good dude! 
---
Yeah. I've decided to just do that.
---
what about &gt;thicc&lt;??

It's called RuneLite. It is 3rd party software, practically everyone uses it. 
---
I don't know if it's just me, but there are certain things that I can do while driving that feel intuitive and others that feel like theyre going to get me killed. Looking at my phone always seems to feel like one of those things no matter what.
---
what about [thicc](/spoiler)??
---
God that brings me back
---
When I was a kid I thought it was going to be big like the wizards tower
---
Sadly not
---
As much as I like adding new content to the game, we already have multiple uses for the boss heads. With the newly added prayer perk to the boss heads I don't think the community would pass this in a poll. We already have the slayer helm recolor for the flex.
---
I already got banned, I appealed it because I've not actually played it since before Christmas. They recovered my account and left the loot in there.. 3mil in fungus but all my armour is gone
---
What other items did it have? The cloaks seemed like an investment that paid off (assuming they stocked them at like 8-12k each awhile back). 
---
After seeing these multi barrows drops on here in the past few days I've started doing barrows again to try my luck. 
---
Its actually a lot more fun because my stats are much higher so I can almost do 3 runs in a single inventory but yeah my luck is still shit. 50 total runs and 1 barrows piece. 
---
He's using RuneLite, just click the fucking screenshot button
---
Easy pages, master clue requirements, holy sandals, 400kc for the clueless scroll. 
---
&gt; Not sure where people got the idea I'm not willing to quest 
---
The tone of your comments in this thread. Case in point:
---
&gt; Ok, just 100+ more quest points and 70 cooking levels to go before I can start
---
&gt; or that I bought gold lol
---
Players with no moderately high stats, but relatively expensive melee gear they likely wouldn't be able to afford, are generally indicators of those who purchase bonds for gold or RWT for gold.
---
Put your stamina/antidote pots in a different place in your bank you'll remember. EZ

I farmed these a couple weeks ago, 325 kills per hour super afk'able with bonecrusher necklace and cannon, I earned 1.1m/hr at the time but masks have dropped in price.
---
Take a seat dear
---
Why though? It’s not game changing, it’s not adding a new bis item, and not affecting anyone.  I think it would be a cool update and adding an extra use to boss heads and also expanding on crests.
---
GL
---
For me they are much more enjoyable and faster than written ones
---
I love the fisher realm. I never use it, but every time I’m there for a clue scroll it just makes me smile.
---
low alch yourself 
---
goodbye
---
I think you should get SOME but not much. Maybe 5-10k xp hr or so would be fine
---
Zulrah is very difficult compared to Vorkath.
---
Bad gear at Zulrah leads to deaths, while bad gear at Vorkath slows down kills.
---
Not saying you can't kill Zulrah but I would 100% say start with Vorkath.
---
Every other Jagex development which wasn’t RuneScape has failed so I wouldn’t get your hopes up.
---
I think your getting really lucky, If you honestly have that many. I would say I farm quite a bit, and I always hover around 3-5 with one planted, and id say I farm a bit more than you. 
---
I thought Ted Bundy was gay though. 
---
Yeah, the point being Garth acts like he has ADHD because he runs around all the time

My best RuneScape friend died the morning of the day we planned to do our first Sara trip together, still have 0 kc two years later. RIP Enbloc

Don't be a bitch about it that's how :)

Runelite, it's widely used by 10s of thousands concurrently.
---
If you decide to use it make sure to download it only from runelite.net, there's many phishing sites imitating it.
---
Would be nice to actually see a project from jagex actually get completed, somehow I struggle to see this happening 
---
Make a new account and transfer all the money to it. It’s not worth risking keeping that account only to get banned or hacked again.
---
Sad times.
---
Currently playing a HCIM but it only has 1 day of membership left, so I'll be back to my main to make a bond tomorrow :') I have a hydra task waiting specifically for that though, so it won't take long
---
On the HC, I'm working towards Lunar Diplomacy reqs. I have all quest requirements done, just need 1 mining level, 7 crafting levels, and 1 magic level. So not far off.
---
I'm kind of all over the place though, doing a bit of farming, a bit of crafting, a bit of slayer, a bit of moneymaking, so progress is slow, but spread out across a lot of different things :D
---
I might start doing it after I get the crafting level for glories. Currently only have 2 from dragon implings and I can't be bothered to charge them all the time.
---
eh i wouldnt leave it forever, id use it as a money making alt
---
But who cares about a good life as long as you have a dank osrs acc?

The new cult following of Settleds ultimate Ironman. It's everyones new cult after A Friend lost his standing in the community and his Hardcore Ironman "whitecat 22" died.
---
Well there are plugins to help with Demonic gorillas and cerb spirits but those can be disabled. as a whole it just runs way better than the regular client (along with gpu plugin) so runelite with just gpu plugin would be a way better experience overall than just playing osrs on vanilla client.
---
This sub always has a boner for something. Yesterday it was zuhaar, tomorrow it could be prifddinas elf lewds

what is your farming level? I'm at 93 and grow a lot of end game seeds. But I doubt levels or planted seeds matter since the seeds drop rate is told to be "random".

The sight of anything runescape classic makes for an uncomfortable nostalgia for me
---
Blood barrage heals aren’t limited by hp. So even if an NPC has 1hp, you can still heal by the max amount if you theoretically hit it.
---
Spawns having low hp may only mean you get one blood barrage before it dies if that’s what you meant
---
Nah I think that was Jeffery Dämmer.

If you can call it a problem having too many of them I mean.

I'm calling bullshit on your story. What really happened is you decided to quit a year ago and sold the account. Then you've had the urge to play again so you recovered it.

Like what beside putting it in your POH?

I’m for that too but this would be a relatively small update and wouldn’t even take them much time.  And it may not be a new bis item like everything they implement with raids and hydra but it’s not useless.

First of all, thank you for this. 
---
Secondly, I think the biggest hurdle for people including myself is finding that thing you're passionate about and funneling your energy into that, instead of something you don't care about. 
---
The reason so many people put so much time into things they don't care about it money and security. 
---
This of course is why I so many others are unable to follow your advice, unless at some point, we decide to say fuck it and go do what we really want to. When and if that will happen in my life? I don't know, but it sure does sound nice. 
---
You'll be hacked again, probably sooner rather than later. Transfer the money to an alt, and maybe keep a few mil on this account so you can play it, but watch and wait and youll see that your account will get recovered by the hacker again and it will become a vicious cycle of you recovering it and then the hacker recovering it, so on and so on.

---
It's because he sold it a few years back, and then recovered it from someone more successful than he was.
---
A random hacker wouldn't do this. The guy who you sold the account to did.
---
What is the drop rate for 35 euros? 
---
Whats a zezima
---
I actually found out a few months ago a good friend of mine for a long time on RuneScape died in a car crash at 21.. at least I know what happened I guess 
---
What drugs u using? Cant blame me for shit without proof. Never sold or bought a account
---
 Morytania 
---
the odds of that happening is like 1/11m
---
None. Leave them in peace.
---
Also mushroom (1/7000) and belladonna (1/8000) if you're going for the pet.
---
If I were there specifically, I would if banked all my items and looted everything haha
---
Right where she belongs 
---
What gear and levels? :) 
---
Just let the guy enjoy the game.  Nobody  appreciates a know it all.  Let alone one that feels the need to post shit like this on Reddit. 
---
You guys are on drugs, so i sold the account and post it on reddit after getting it back? Smart right. 
---
No it did not sold my account and no one can proof it
---
No shit? That's not the question I'm asking dumbass. 
---
Omg are you actually that dumb? Its not only the accuracy and dmg bonuses that needs to be calculated, its also the defensive bonuses. Gosh you are dumb. Defense bonuses means that less time eating more time dpsing.
---
Gower quest?
---
I hate suqahs haha. Well in all honesty greater demons in the chasm of fire with a cannon really isn’t that bad. I didn’t know about the chasm of fire until Konar made me go there. Instead I probably would have put kurask there since they are pretty slow compared to others. At the time I was going for 99 and if I wasn’t barraging abyssal demons I probably would have put them on there just because I hate sire and melleing those is a long task. But, if you want drops like whips you gotta keep them. Moral of the story it’s all about preference! Hope this helps man and gl on the grinding :)
---
Download the 'rotation control app'. Change settings, reload osrs and it should work. I just tried on mine and its fine. 
---
Without proof? Are you kidding? Did you even read a single word of this whole thread?
---
Prick
---
Other bonus: mushroom (1/7000) and belladonna (1/8000) if you're going for the pet.
---
No shit moron? 
---
[https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/) will be one of the greatest assets you can ever have. 
---
Best idea so far
---
Duradel is always better than nieve bar specific things like cannon tasks or inferno or cerb. Konar is only good if you want to just afk melee tasks
---
How does that party room teleport exactly works? can you explain please?
---
Why 5 ranarr 3 avantoe and not 8 avantoe? 
---
Download the 'rotation control app'. 
---
Proof that i sold the account? No one can proof that
---
Personally because I have ornate pool, I afk the suqahs by the altar, and just ancient mace a dummy in my house, go through lunar portal, afk kill 30 of them, tele back, pool, rinse and repeat. 
---
Nothing, but that link takes you to a scam website. You go to runelite.net to get the client not whatever website is posted there
---
I did all of these runs on my 83 cb pure, in the span of two days. I was doing speed runs with the intention of setting a personal record. The lowest time that I completed a run was in 4m16s. I used ice barrage for the freeze, then trident of the swamp with 94 magic, a max hit of 33. For Ahrim and the tunnels, I used rune c bow w/ dragonstone bolts (e) with a range lvl of 94. I might do another 150 runs with blowpipe to see how fast i can get a run done that way.
---
pmod this guy
---
How much do you typically make from Miscellania? I need to get it done but wondering what the profit and effort on it are?
---
Mhm I'll give that a try
---
Ahh mhmm.
---
Of course no one can prove it, the only one who can prove it is you, the liar here. However, there is CLEAR evidence, which supports what's being said.  
---
Not my proudest fap 
---
Weird flex but okay
---
I paid 99 bucks for a  iPhone 6s brand new 3 months ago, fuck off. Wasn’t my choice but I’d rather have something that will actually last vs a cheap equivalent android. Now obviously if I could of afforded a galaxy 7 or better for a decent price I would have went that route but I choose to not to “lease” a phone
---
I am from the future, you gotta prepare yourself for yellow cape era, it's the best one.
---
Wait you got that mad about you being a brain dead fuck that you want to start calling names when people with brains correct you? Ouch. Must be rough living life with such a limitation. 
---
Upvote so a jmod can ban this fool
---
&gt; no ethnics
---
I'm dying in my HCIM IRL 
---
When did this happen
---
Plot twist. It’s his sister and he’s trying to flex her while she’s busy cooking herself some food haha
---
Thats sounds like a terrible idea but ok
---
Are you stupid? Seriously lmao. There are sooo many other things that you need to know about dpsing. Gosh. Sit.
---
Except by offering in game items to subs he is pushing people to sub to him which provides him with money.
---
AKA gray area RWT that the mods have stated is full blown RWT.
---
I think this has been fixed because I tried this after seeing the suggestion a while back and it worked for like a week and then recently on my kurask task it didn't work.
---
I once spent half an hour killing jellies before realizing my slayer task was actually turoths.
---
The other day I got a Konar task for Kalphites in the slayer only cave area and spent half an hour killing them for no reason in the other dungeon.
---
I just sold coal and iron. Farmed moss Giants for a rune med to sell for 10k.  
---
Don't you dare diss darkscape.
---
What does ESEA have in common with osrs?
---
I could probably have hosted the RuneScape Classic server on my i7-920 box with 20gb of RAM. It's not a hard game to run...
---
I used to autotype the password in but that only lasted a few days before I realized runelite lets you enable pasting in the input field.
---
Fucking bwaner
---
The way you defend yourself is so obviously incriminating. Don't commit an actual crime because a prosecutor would have a field day with your blabbermouth.
---
ITS 2019 AND CAPITALIZATION IN PASSWORDS DOESN’T MATTER. WHAT’S THE DEAL?
---
Literally not bronze man, bronze man has items unlocked via RNG from PvP drops and self sufficient gameplay. This is a chosen unlock method based on a currency methodology that is gained from skills and pvp kill count. Quite different, the only thing that is the same would be the pvp only worlds
---
Surprisingly this is correct, there's lore about this on the wiki
---
I listed "better upgrades" elsewhere. Ancestral, dhcb, Lance, arma, bandos, bgs, dwh, sang staff, df ward, all Zenytes, prims, pegs, dclaws, the list goes on... By the time you have all of those items you consider buying a rapier and then it's almost time for the rebuild. 
---
If you could name 3 places rapier is bis excluding vasa crystal and nylocas I'll be very impressed. Bonus points if those places aren't dead content anyone somewhat efficient. 
---
thanks pal :) helped a lot :)
---
I have a big shark in my bank. I'll build it in my house when I get home and let you know. My rsn is Addicted2Rs if you want to add me in case I forget 
---
I’m aware so why the fuck are you even tryin to mage slayer at 91 lmao. You’re so brain damaged it hurts
---
Increases my blue dragon trip time
---
Nothing will happen buddy that shit is made up, never sold a account or bought one.
---
Crafting their own arrows is a waste of money at best it would unlock yew bow and rune arrows but that would ruin f2p pking
---
You're really casting Veng to fight Varrock dark mages?
---
How dare a company that was hemoragghing money for years try and make themselves profitable again! 
---
Btw my name is ozmxn not ozmxN
---
Back in rs2 I would use this location to not magic. 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Managing_Miscellania#Factors_of_productivity
---
Scroll down to the "Rewards" tab. Unless it's changed in the past couple weeks, having mining maxed out and the rest on mahogany is the best money maker. In my opiniom it's definitley worth the effort to do both quests.
---
Well I wouldnt say it was absolutely wonderful. I got stuck and had to repeat the start 3 times which took me ageeees
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
Bro dont you see hes hating? That thing is fake af, my username is ozmxn on reddit, that post is ozmxN
---
Except when your a pure and the diary items are locked behind defense Recs 
---
You go to backstage runescape and have a drink with the gwd bosses and help betatest the new skills bankstanding and sailing
---
Void knight sword from a pc expansion maybe? But yeah fuck the old spec lol. It does look sick, I’ll give you that much. 
---
Most people don't know about wiki Quick guides. You'll be done in much shorter time than watching the vid. 
---
Well if either one gets hacked suicide is only answer anyways.
---
\&gt;  I don't know why you're choosing to be willfully ignorant about the differences here. 
---
You just ignored my comment about being able to afk without Guthans for however long 1000 abs lasts. With a decent def lvl that's many times the current 20 minute afk. And Jagex, as hinted by Mod Kieran in a top post about removing tick manipulation a few years back did say they they were not happy about it but "it is a situation where we live with it due to the time constraints related to solving it" he also noted a substantial portion of the community think it should be taken out. I haven't heard Jagex say anything about changing NMZ for the worse unless it's from some recent Q/A? On the off chance that it does happen I hope they poll it so this sub that whines about everything from a 5 tile lgb event or adding a bar in lumby isn't looked at as the representative of the community.
---
Yeah then you are going to move it further saying how Excalibur s dead content and the slippery slope will keep tumbling down until the whole game is free to play. Actually that sounds kind of nice continue on.
---
As long as that gate is open always in members worlds, I'm all in. 
---
Maybe so I can burst/barrage in 2 levels? Are you really this fucking dense? 
---
How is this different than you getting 99cooking or grinding any other skill.
---
You both invest time in the same game yet in another way. If he enjoyed doing it its not a waste of time.
---
Also grinding is for autists anyways - glorious botting race
---
Only Trails gets close 2nd ;) 
---
https://m.imgur.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/7n0VQSY
---
Definitely get Ibans. Gear wise, just your best Melee gear for all the brothers apart from Ahrim for him bring an imbued magic shortbow and your best d'hide.
---
I have basically the same stats as you (70 prayer tho) and I'm using: helm of neitznot, glory, obby plate, Dragon legs, barrows gloves, seers ring, Dragon boots, legends cape, d def and Ibans. Then for ahrim I switch in black d'hide body and legs and the MSB (i) witu rune arrows. In the tunnel I use a whip. 
---
Inventory is, holy wrench, 3 prayer pots, ring of duelling, spade, barrows Teletabs, cast runes, ectophial, 4 sharks and a magic potion. That usually lasts me 5 or 6 runs. 
---
Bro, they're tough. Bring the d claw switch on the goons.
---
You gotta do a lot of research if you want to become efficient. Sorry man. Playing with someone isn't going to help you much especially since they'll likely blaze past you doing quests or skills unless they don't know anything like you. This game is an mmo but it is highly dependent on solo play. I do however, recommend joining a cc. Join "maize" and say hello.
---
I dont understand what's wrong with new f2p bis items as long as it isnt better than p2p stuff. PKers should want more options because it helps break up the monk robes, maple shortbow, and rune 2h meta. 
---
Are the gnomes/Khazard troopers on the battlefield south of Ardougne aggressive? Will they attack a level 3 that wanders by?
---
Yep as long as the prices don’t go haywire they will sell
---
Which one runs better? I use osb OpenGL and it runs at like 30fps
---
Teleing to clan wars and back is faster and much more efficient and saves money for ya
---
The achievement is watching one episode and not watching the next. Not watching any is just normal. 
---
Congrats!!
---
I started out fresh a month ago. The learning curve is great. But the satisfaction of progressing your character on your own is nice. I am currently in the fight caves on wave 45 going for the fire cape for the first time ever. And it has my heart pumping every 15 waves I have to log out and calm down. Lol 
---
Add me "ily btw". I play a lot in the evening and will be happy to help you out and chat
---
Ah okay my bad :)
---
Awesome thanks! It's been a couple days and they haven't, but as long as they're able to be sold eventually that helps lol
---
You can burst at 70. Rushing 94 mage to barrage tasks at 60 slayer or whatever you are is fuckin stupid. You’ll hit 99 mage years before slayer. But you can play your shitty account however you want I guess. If you wanna waste hour of your pathetic life playing this game super inefficient all day then that’s on you
---
His name is Necroletics 
---
Did you checked out my username and the username that is shown its not the same
---
Guys I think it’s retarded
---
Security questions? Those got removed long time ago.
---
I like the design btw, would be cool to see some more influence of the gods in game
---
*like*?
---
Life is good brother
---
What are those mining rocks?
---
Will that just become another bot hotspot?
---
Tbh no one said you were smart. 
---
I use redirected house tabs for the taverly tree patch and kourend patches 
---
Wow, thE Zezima?! What an honor.
---
Gz! i got my first skilling pet yesterday, agility!
---
Could have been resold to someone. Feelsbad 
---
How about a Dark Wizard boss on the top floor, need a one-use key to access like Obor and Bryophyta.
---
....So then I cut off Elvarg's head!
---
I can already imagine how many pkers are drooling at the sight of this.
---
It does currently have a P2P use: the NPC is part of the Fairy Tale quest
---
I was rank 30 coll on rs2, now it's the source of all my cash on osrs, I can absolutely assure you that the collector is the deciding factor in a torso taking 4 rounds or 5. 
---
Who tf makes steak on the stove, get a bbq.
---
Lol you can play RuneScape in college and still get fine grades, have you tried not being stupid?
---
fake. dude praying melee got hit 73
---
Well damn, then I could have gotten a max stack of air and mind runes before casting the wind strike as well. I fail at this.
---
This exact concept has been polled, both directly as it is in dmm and with various tweaks. None passed. 
---
Thank you for this. This looks really cool to have. Is there anything that I have to do other than input the rsn in e1 on constant? It's not properly loading the stats, it says loading then sometimes that goes away but the stats do not update and and some boxes say "unknown range"get lvl" or something similar
---
the caps are like 3k or something. 
---
or he meant profit from having fossils -&gt; saving gp on pray, dunno.
---
They knew what they signed up for
---
Life is most certainly not good. Cooking steak on the stove, killing Dust Devils in the Smoke Dungeon and an Apricot Ale? OMEGAFUCKINGLUL
---
Then the f2p players wouldn't be able to access it 
---
Lavas fastest exp
---
Bloods most afk and comparable exp to zmi (really no reason to do zmi after 77)
---
Double cosmics for money till 82 then double astral.

The simulation is becoming self aware

I had turned the authenticator off two days ago for my friend to get 1 Zulrah kc for me. That friend did know my bank pin and is a friend IRL not sure how  they got my password, nonetheless, here we are.

KreyGasm
---
thanks!
---
I've only been doing them in the farming guild for the chance I get the contract as well as the supercompost
---
you don't have 99 defense, rigour.
---
Considering the progress of Zezima in osrs, he might not even have mortanyia unlocked
---
Iron man Konar task, steak on a stove is really good actually, and give the apricot ale a shot. It’s rather tasty.

People normally recommend 3 skeletons because it’s convenient, you don’t need to keep track as much, and you can use a salve amulet to kill them much faster.
---
Technically the best for reward potential is 2 skeletons and 1 bloodsucker I believe, but I’ve seen some arguments where the time you save using the salve is more than the profit you get from having that slightly better reward potential 
---
But her snakeling though...
---
Fuck some people are straight up scumbags. 
---
I honestly thought that it was cycling through each quest and when it got to the end, you would say something about the experience you've gained
---
It might have been one of the slug quests?  It might not be in osrs, but I swear the one where Kenneth wants his toy back might have it.  I know he talks about the game being in a box at the start of the (disappointing) last quest.
---
You'd really be scraping the bottom of the barrel during the last few weeks, too.
---
"... so then I gave the wool to the farmer and he paid me with 60 coins."
---
His addicted what?
---
oh yeah my bad
---
No, everything tastes better on the bbq
---
Why would you not just give your friend the number once when he was ready to log in...?
---
I thought it was kinda funny :(
---
I wondered how accurate they really are, especially if no one is checking it often.
---
When OSRS was released I made so much bank training on them. This was before the GE was reintroduced and I would sell body talismans on Zybez for like 13k each lol 
---
Oh hey it’s bwahaha
---
honestly bro, I made this drunk and I don't actually know how the game works
---
might wanna try asking on 4chan's /h/
---
If ur not settled ur pacake is too small, boy. 
---
Youuuu did it :0
---
I dunno man, looks like you've just proved my point by immediately attacking my character rather that addressing my point. 
---
I think the settled thing is irrelevant at this point, it's not a very unique or interesting post but based on the upvote system, more people enjoyed it than didn't, so if you don't like it, chuck it an upvote and move on. If you're looking to make a more nuanced point, it's more likely to land without the tone.
---
As for "digging", what I found was clearly someone who cares about the game and is knowledgeable about it, I just don't really understand the hostility in some of the things you say. It's unnecessary, and to be honest I think if it's true people "can't handle" being told how it is, it's probably because of the manner in which you're doing it!
---
If you want to continue this discussion I'd be happy to DM, post comments aren't really a great place to debate. Cheers
---
I recommend making a copy of the sheet for yourself and changing E1 in the Constants sheet to the RSN you want to get the stats of. The copy you make will tell you when I update the sheet so you know if you need to go grab the newest version.
---
As for the Loading... in stats after you change the RSN in constants, the sheet is requesting your user data from the official OSRS servers and does take a second for my scripts to get the information and place them in the correct spot. Then the entire document will work off the stats found in the stats sheet.

UPDATE: After claiming to be starving venezualans, the hijacker logged off, to the changed password and authenticator on. GF Torture and Prims. Fortunately for me, I logged on last night on mobile to do some fletching, banking my full armadyl and dhcb.
---
i have 23 hespori kc, yet i have around 52 hespori seeds in my bank, and it continues to increase. I do a shit load of farming tho so maybe thats why. Besides the usual tree/fruit tree runs, I do around 5-6 allotment/herb/hops runs a day 
---
The funny thing is you could actually kill hydra with just a blowpipe if you prayer flick.
---
New to the farming grind, which are the patches that get diseased?
---
Only 1 is the guy is there almost all the time world 306 I know him as bwahaha
---
Yes it does. Invisible boosts can go over 99. So use the harpoon spec.
---
omfg didnt see it coming
---
When you complete the puzzle box it should also give you 15 agility xp
---
I'll let the Konar task slide. I couldn't cheat on my grill like that, those marks and char are too good to pass up. That ale... it just sounds... bleh.
---
Hope you get your account back in a week, or they'll just reset the pin.
---
Idiot u deserve this lmao
---
I believe invisible boosts work differently and do help past 99. So if you were 92 and boosted to visible 95, you should still get the invisible +7 too.
---
If you guys can upvote this, Jagex might be able to find their account that they transferred the items to.

\[Strange racist turn but alright man\]([https://i.gyazo.com/15849a0ffbfd9d6e7418255d58eeb4da.png](https://i.gyazo.com/15849a0ffbfd9d6e7418255d58eeb4da.png))
---
Give it back
---
RSCR takes a lot of features from RS2/RS3/WoW and put them in something approximating RuneScape Classic. So, it's not really a replacement for the game that Jagex took down in my opinion, it's more of its own thing. A lot of people enjoy it, but saying RSC and RSCR are the same is like saying OSRS and RS3 are the same.
---
There _have_ been a couple "replica" style private servers that have cropped up since RSC was taken down. Anyone interested in those can see if they can find the official unofficial RSC subreddit, where there might be more information.
---
There are other options like email/pw combos being compromised on other websites.
---
It's not as simple as "It's this or this".
---
Is that a ftp uim :(
---
I also made one of these, but as i procedually unlocked content it has become partly obsolete for me. I am having dinner atm, will post my version here in like 10 minutes. 
---
Also a q p, W cape. Nice
---
There really wasn't any ego here. I mean it was a suggestion and you were being some elitist nerd. I don't see as out of all the suggestions, this is the most cancerous one as it really doesn't have that much of an impact. Not like I'm asking for easy scape shit like blast furnace or something. 
---
Take a chill pill. Like I said, its just a suggestion. 
---
Login Username/Email and Linked Emails aren't always the same. So your original Email is likely still the login.
---
Could be incorporated as a quest step, I guess?
---
Hoopah hoopah dance! Hahaha motherfuckers!!!!
---
I completely agree with this comment. Zezima was nuts, but really he was just grinding. It seems like everyone has autism like him now and we're older and smarter now with high efficiency methods for getting xp/hr. Zezima was likely doing high efficiency xp/hr while the rest of the community was largely bankstanding and jerking off to their middle school crush. 
---
I posted yesterday but got downvoted, should I repost?
---
primordials and torture are ~49.6m combined, which is 15 bonds / $104 USD in bonds, or $34 USD if you were to sell it to a gold selling website lmao
---
nobody would RWT $34 in OSRS gold. 
---
Give it a go, it's a solid series and Settled recommended it to me on one of his streams.
---
Well I was thinking a total amount of GP for the entire skill, that way you could see the XP and time to complete for all of your current options. That way you could decide if one option gives 40k xp less but saves you 6 hours gameplay. Thanks for the response!
---
You have been blessed.
---
Unpopular Opinion: If Swampletics does what he's setting out to do, he's better than Zezima.
---
Grats, man!
---
Imagine... needing to run from the fairy ring to the farming guild (I don't even know how far of a run it is)  
---
This meme was made by the Farming Cape gang
---
&gt; -Dust runes instead of airs, saves the 1 slot for lumby tele
---
Just take a stack of mist, lava and law runes and you can teleport to all locations, and still only use 3 inv spaces.
---
Fairy ring to Zanaris and back
---
Problems like that would be solved if jagex had control over what plug ins would be supported by the client
---
this guy censored frick
---
All you need for rune dragons is a hasta (I realize this has gone up quite a bit). With superantifire potions and a defender you can shred them without the need of a 10m DFS. Barrows armor works fine here so no need for bandos either. 
---
Vorkath can be easily done in Void and even black d'hide.
---
Zulrah is a difficult boss to learn. People are going to tell you to do it because it's the most accessible, but im telling you that it is difficult and likely not worth you killing yourself to. Much better to wait until you have the money for a Suffering and Serp helm so you can get a feel for it without worrying about the little snaklings, poison, or venom.
---
Your funds are not really an issue, with access to black d'hide armor and barrows you will be completely fine.
---
What should i use?
---
Tedious, right?
---
He's ancient, but that's why he's so legendary.
---
Yeah, life's great. Playing a game from 1999 on a 2003 laptop in a 400sqft apartment.

No one guessed your password.

ya I I'm

fucking 70 farming
---
That's interesting. I added a permissions file to the spreadsheet that should allow my custom functions to run. But the reason you you got that prompt would be because my document uses handwritten JavaScript functions to operate on the document, making stuff like grabbing the given RSN and asking official OSRS servers for the hi-scores page and outputting it in a readable way.
---
I don't blame you for your cautiousness. Being secure is definately important
---
I've considered it, but, one mists actually cost money, and two you don't need the space since you're doing your tree run and would burn all of your runes by the time you hit catherbury and started your herbs.
---
What was your first 99? Also, what was your last 99?
---
meanwhile i \_have\_ to flaunt my level 95 dick to them every time i pass by
---
Damn dudes got rls 
---
After 
---
This made me sad
---
Thanks for the insight, probably gonna skip zulrah for now.
---
Calling it now, will be closed 6 months after launch (if it ever launches)
---
Shortest bank to furnace in the game,  my man 
---
Wait does that guy have access to your account? And he's threatening to kill your pet?
---
Is that 1/8k per initial check of the patch or per nightshade you pick?
---
It’s kind of a long explanation but I basically found her through Facebook and discovers her obituary I basically knew enough irl info to figure it out 
---
Are gmauler pures typically maxed hp?  I'd think that they're closer to 60-70 or so, and you'd slowly gain combat levels through hp so the prayer points would contribute at certain levels no?
---
It's not that far to run from the Fally patch
---
You have to login with your original login email, that never changes. For security sake I recommend deleting this post too so that one day people can't go back and know your login email
---
I would love this, they have goggles in WoW that make every character and npc appear as an orc female so although they are on different engines it might not be impossible just prolly a good amount of work
---

You kill any sense of achievement you might have had by letting a friend do it for you. You miss out on improving at playing the game by skipping the process of learning how to beat the boss. This is the kind of person that will run around with the infernal cape they've bought. These people only see the material gain and op even went as far as to throw away his account security for it. Hard to see how op is not a weakling that fully deserves the result of his actions.
---
Yeah you're retarded.
---
There’s other ways to “hack” someone’s account than phishing. I assume your definition of phishing is you putting your information into a fake log in page and the attacker using this to change your profile information. 
---
You’re not the first person to state that they’re account was hacked beyond 2FA and you don’t believe you did anything wrong. This leads me to believe Jagex is using very poor security for their database or website. Look up cross site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) if you feel like gaining some new technical knowledge. A 1337 H4X0R could perform CSRF through various means, more often than not through click jacking or cross site scripting (XSS).

Didn't know he was part of Minecraft hunger games team

Gotcha, thanks! And I'd only probably train melee first, then mage when I have to since I don't like mage. Which bosses could I do with a bit higher melee stats? If so, what stats?
---
Bought a blowpipe and regular trident, and went to Zulrah til I could afford toxic trident, whip, blowpipe, bgs, fury, and d boots... Then mostly ToB with a few CoX solos mixed in after I could afford DHCB :P

Better question is why there isn't a wizard robe bottom?

How about “It seems everyone around here is doing the same thing. doesn’t anyone have unique adventures?”

Quite easily if you knew anything about grilling. Here, I'll help you out with one of my recipes, bud.
---
 - Remove your steak from the fridge about 15-20 mins before grilling
---
 - Fire up your stove on high with a cast iron pan on it
---
 - Insert pieces of garlic cloves into the steak
---
 - Rub on your dry herbs and spices (I use thyme, rosemary, sea salt, fresh cracked black pepper and a small amount of red pepper flakes, trust me on the red pepper flakes)
---
 - Lock on all those herbs and spices by brushing on some olive oil
---
 - Fire up your grill on high
---
 - Sear each side of the steak for about 30 seconds in the cast iron pan
---
 - Re-season your steak as needed (I generally use about half the amount from the first seasoning)
---
 - Toss your steak right on the middle of the grill
---
 - Cook each side for about 5 minutes with an internal temperature of 135 degrees (medium rare)
---
 - Spritz with a little lemon juice
---
 - Take your steak off and lay it on a cutting board
---
 - Spread a slice of butter over the top and lay it to rest in the middle of the steak
---
 - Cover with aluminum foil and let it rest for about 5-10 mins
---
 - Uncover it and eat that shit
---

Idk who goes past unlocking fairy rings
---
He was the basically the early-RS equivalent of S U O M I and Lynx, but before we knew what we were doing. He hit rank 1 for the first time in 2003, was the first to hit 99 slayer when that was released, stayed atop the high scores for a long time. He took an extended break for a few years, not moving much. He stayed with RS3 when the OSRS split happened, and has had some nice accomplishments over there after coming back to the game. 
---
It's critical to understand the context of his achievements though. He was getting 99s before skill capes and back in the early (2001-2005) years of RS. It's hard to adequately describe the atmosphere back then, but things were *a lot* different. Without skill capes, 99s weren't seen as something people really grinded for. Most stats didn't have much (if any) content beyond the 70s, so training stats to 99 for no reward at the end wasn't something many did. Plus, the game wasn't "solved" in the way it is now. There certainly wasn't the same focus on efficiency and "playing the right way" among the player base that we see now. 
---
Outlaws only give 1/4th of the usual xp that a normal monster would give. This is shown on the forums.
---
I would recommend looking at a guide before trying to do anymore training
---
What the fuck is a apricot ale
---
yes, Making history is a requirement
---
No bait, 175 QP for like what, 1 max hit and 1 extra range bonus? LMFAO
---
Just luck bro. Cooking level has some effect but not much. 
---
If it's a requirement it requires the quest to be completed. It wouldn't mention it if you didn't need it.
---
You chose to limit yourself 
---
Sounds good bud I'll PM you when I get on
---
Must of just joined this subreddit today my guy. GL being a white knight elsewhere
---
Lmao all those butthurt pures
---
It's per patch cleared, same as how trees and such are per "check health." And yes, that's how the base chance changes. 
---
It only takes 448 maniacal monkeys get from 60 to 70 which isn't that bad.

Right? That was a very informative answer that didn't answer the question in the slightest. 
---
Didnt even know that existed until now.

Is arpg now used to refer to isometric dungeon crawl looter games? Shit I thought arpg was anything not turn based, like dark souls or the Witcher. Genres get confusing sometimes. 
---
I remember playing the classic ace of spades well before it was bought by jagex. Then the main game died and the classic was thriving for a while. Basically an RS3 and OSRS story

---
This was accomplished by logging out after the chest opened and before it gave the contents to the person who opened it. When the game couldn't give the contents to anybody, it stopped. Some people also say it could be triggered by opening the chest too fast.
---
This could have been fixed by adding a "close" option to the opened chest, or copying the chest handling code from any of the other chests in the game, as they were all coded separately.

The high level quests weren't, and this is another high level one

I did forget about my arm though. Idk. Maybe it isn't a pattern. Just felt like it haha. 
---
are you a j mod who knows if you need to fully complete? no? did I ask a random kid for his opinion? no? okay thought so.
---
He stopped playing competitevly aroind 06 when the game got too easy iirc
---
They've been working on a unannounced project for years now, since they've had job openings for it. I'm actually excited to see what jagex can do with a new engine. 
---
Lol idk how dont worry :P
---
This... this is good.

Dammit I'm so close to my quest cape. this is going to put me back a bit.

When do posts trying to mock people ever turn out how op intended?  Lul
---
What the literal fuck why do they keep raising the requirements for a quest cape... There is no reason to require 70 farming and herblore, they keep arbitrarily raising the quest cape skill reqs it pisses me off
---
Hey man first off just want to clarify that I'm not trying to attack you at all this is just fun banter :p. I think he's the best because he was the first legendary player. I don't know when you started playing but zezima WAS runescape back in like 2006, 2007 or so. He was the face of the game. Settled makes great video content and has achieved a lot in the game, sure. But zezima was first to reach max at a time when the game was very different. Just because he doesn't play right now doesn't make him any less of a legend in the game. I think there was a nickelodeon poll a long time ago of the top 100 most influential people for kids, and zezima was in the top 10 I believe. That's some lasting impact and he probably gave more attention to the game than anyone else. 
---
Is autoweed a meme? No wiki results but I might be getting whooshed
---
That's brilliant. I'd love to experience the game in that way again! I've started playing Ironman and it's the closest I'm gonna get to the feeling I think :')

Jokes on you, neither have cash though

Fair enough, I take your point. It's more about what's popular at the moment than what's good content right?
---
I think r/2007scape is generally 80% shitpost anyway so it doesn't bother me too much, do you know if there are any 07 communities which are less meme oriented?
---
LMAO I love this, made my day &lt;3
---
You're a waste of resources too, how can you convince me its otherwise? cease to exist pls, for the planet

I may make a maximum efficient one based on your guide using extra things like brimhaven teleports, skills necklaces, salt teleports etc. for non irons/ high level irons.

The 5% chance to MINE 2 dense essence blocks from Kourend and Kebos Lowlands medium diary does not give xp in crafting and mining for the bonus one. Varrock armour gives xp for the bonus ore. Either way I want to turn it off and I can't because that 5% loss to passive mining xp and 2.5% crafting xp matters more to me than an extra essence block due to how afk zeah rcing is in nature.

Going from 7% to 8% bridge success is going to be huge for my account. Can’t wait to see what new opportunities this will bring.

Legit though the be careful thing was about the trump meeting thing. Thought the ad was an ad on Reddit. Kept clicking the dots to report it, just to bring the picture to full screen.

It'll take you a couple hours only :)

Shame.

Go play rs3 then, retard. If anything, we should shorten the time you have to pick up items, and have them spawn to everyone else after that time has elapsed.

I actually told her this last week and her response was essentially "I...I was there"

they sorta had the barebones with the structure of the game being about making a story about the hero's journey through gielinor and a bunch of cards already designed

I'm at work looking at this on mobile so I can't really fully play around with it, but my question is this:

What advantage does this provide over osbuddy efficiency? What problem with that site were you trying to solve when you made this?

Red cape era didn’t need to leave morytania just saying!

highly recommend setting up the inventory tags with runelite. i can show you mine when i get home if you want

It's incredible how many pures there are who have the audacity to cry and attack jagex, on Twitter, with their personal info and face plastered on their account...  And can 1 def pures even do any grandmaster quest?  Just more white noise from them imo.

This is tailored to your search habits. Not everyone would have the same suggestions.

I was planning on finishing base 70 after quest cape anyway so I guess that’s not too bad. Maybe I’ll finish these last 13 quests so I can get the cape for a bit before having to do this quest.

You got ripped off, the blade is missing. Drop it, it's useless.

I'm from Worcester so not too far. I'd come

Hair, it's not a rs comic

honestly fuck pures

should just make it so you need to level up every combat stat before leaving tutorial island
---
XP cutting normal trees isn't really that bad, and firemaking them is much faster than training slayer through temple trecking. Not sure how fast you think that really is..

You sound like a douche

Exactly!

What would you say the best items are to have in this farming bank tab? Asking because I would love to set one up!

Now there's a name I haven't heard in a loong time. RIP

Really though. It's not exactly anything special lmao. 
---
Fuck that shit, I'm gonna complain every kill I don't get what I want and you can't stop me.
---
Why yell at someone when they are telling you the truth? Look at DS2 and MM2. Every single quest in both of those have to be 100% completed. These are going to be the same way. 
---
You can also look at that fact that you really don't reach any milestones in making history until the quest is over. 
---
I'm assuming you are going to need the guy to help you look up some History on Priff. Which will only unlock once the quest is done because then he has his museum and isn't "tore down".
---
It's not like FE2 where you unlock fairy rings to start. 
---
Stop making me feel bad. ;\_;

OSRS haters arise

Stop padding your ego for a bunch of nerds online because you finally lost your virginity then xD
---
I'd say we need to take this further, lose XP as well like DMM, after all. It's only fair you forget some of your training prior. 
---
With the complaints from pures about skill reqs, do they not question that this is a fucking grandmaster quest? Why should the highest ranked quest be tailored in order to please a specific account style? Just because by coincidence the elf questline prior had no defense requirement? It's stupid if that's the only reason.
---
Its already based around quest points. The more quest points you have, the more time you have. You also either need to have obtained 1 quest point or 100,000 xp since the last time you played the minigame.
---
Why look at legends quest and rfd. I'm asking j mods not randoms giving their opinions.
---
Gz, don't do any maze randoms
---
If it is a bot, then it just sounds like you're wasting your own time.
---
Dragon Harpoon only gives you a benifit while you use it as a harpoon, which is only for sharks (not minnows), tuna, and swordfish. The special should be used at any level.

Ayy guess im not alone haha

All thinking for him?

Base 70s. I'm getting close a few agility and herblore levels and like 15 of construction and runecrafting. A bit bummed about the new quests required states though. The cost to train everything may go up.

Just got hellhounds for the first time, wheres my best place to kill them at?

yeah but he wants to do it while being a asset to the team. So he needs good stats and gear.

At least there isnt 70 RC

Yeah they added it in with the guild, it's pretty nice.

Instead of osrs based off of 2007 what if it's just rs based off 2011. Osrs2?
---
Id never get in if it was, i mean can only do so much tears and xp lamps ya know? Haha
---
go help her 
---
I see way too many people wear graceful. Cant say I ever ran out of run energy on my farm runs. The 2.5% extra xp is tits on trees and other big xp drops. To each their own I guess.
---
Uhhh wtf
---
His bis is gonna be just barrows more or less right?
---
I loved that turn based strategy where you controlled units and could summon things like bandos boss kbd or red drags. Cant remember the name though
---
I don't think the stats will be the biggest bottleneck, it'll be the MEP2 requirement. It's one of the most tedious quests in OSRS and doesn't give you much unlike MM2 or DS2
---
This one cost 11$

u chose 2 limit urself yeet

It's because you just need the area Legends Quest unlocks.. not the actual "Quest" Where as what area is Making History opening up for you before the end?

I promise you, you will have to complete the whole quest. Other then that IDK what to tell you. I'm just trying to help.

I don't need a J-mod. If im wrong ill give you 10m cash in game. That's how sure i am. So take it as you will. I tried to help. J-Mod's arent going to respond when they literally posted it above.

Farming, hunter, and agi for me... agi is my most hated skill, hunter is slow but whatever, and farming i just forget. Like ill do a week of tree runs then forget the skill exists.

we copy rs3 content quite a bit BUT we tweak it so it isn't shitty like RS3's stuff
---
Of course he loves the hype, he is getting overpaid for this right now. His series is good, but it's not this fucking good. Imagine what the other snowflake creators are thinking right now.. They just had to be a tiny tiny bit better than they are, then this hype would be about them instead. Or would it?

I'm gonna make 50 bots and spam this subreddit with memes promoting my twitch channel, no problem with that. ;)

NMZ used to be THE way for people to max their melee skills when it first came out.  Guthans armor set was worth like 20m at the time because the strat was to put on easy bosses and guthans and then go to bed.  The state NMZ is now is because THIS is the nerfed version haha.  Used to be anyone with a high combat level and low slayer level was called an “NMZ prod” and laughed at.  
---
Ok your answer was much more helpful on an explanation. The first one was not so much. 
---
Depends on the med. Adderall and Ritalin destroy my appetite. I'm currently taking Zenzedi which is just dextroamphetamine (the good stuff in Adderall) and I haven't lost any weight. I eat just as much, if not more than when I'm unmedicated. Yes, stimulants do by nature increase your metabolism and such, but if you're taking a low dose or a med that doesn't have any side effects, then you won't really lose an appreciable amount of weight. And yes, amphetamines do calm me down. Not just focus. I have wonderful naps sometimes right after I take my meds. 
---
Ffs. I was flexing the fact that I caught a guy for 999999gp when I sold an addy thrownaxe.
---
Ahh okay, that makes sense. Do you have your BA pet? I see your signature
---
I saw this on /r/comics , it's created by /u/Jawkly
---
Jagex should just ban giveaways too then people wouldn’t be phished by giveaways on the “runescape forum” The funny thing is almost no other game has this issue as bad as Runescape does, which leads me to believe that there’s clearly more Jagex could do to prevent this sort of thing yet they don’t.
---
I would also prefer death mechanics similar to those of RS3, partly because I really dislike the idea behind there being any chance to lose actual items.
---
Deaths on RS3 can cost you 2m+ gp when using high end gear. That's incredibly punishing which is what a lot of players are asking for for the upcoming death rework: actual risk to deaths. They also give the option to run back to your corpse so you can reclaim your items for free.
---
The nice part about RS3's death mechanics is that they also add value to untradeables. So you can no longer welfare in untradeable gear to cheapen your death punishment.
---
nice log :) 
---
But 2018 was last year this year is 2019 :D
---
Why would you use GP/xp calc when you have that on wiki or some other calc sites
---
I cannot speak from experience, but it seems worst comes to worst you do one cycle normally, then have the opportunity to run the rest like this.
---
Bandos'  philosophies  were never my reasons, I just wanted a cool nonrs tattoo
---
At least 4K is useful for Runescape since it really helps multitasking.
---
Honestly i think its just how played out they are. At this point its not original anymore, and all they're doing is making things 100x more time consuming meaning videos consist of a ridiculous grind that takes 50 hours instead of 1. Osrs doesnt have a lot of tactical/mechanical difficulty. Its all just usually sponged, meaning lots of health/time spent/BiS gear locked. Most quests even for example some are tedious and very long, but they arent hard by any means..they just require patience and time. Granted you can only implement so many activities in a game like OSRS and how its designed, so i get that. I will say inferno was a great step towards legit difficulty. I look at something like the souls series. Different genre but the difficulty is there even if youre in BiS gear and leveled (to an extent, they are easier ofc but still "hard" so to say) its just a different skill set. OSRS doesnt really have a skill set to employ unless you consider clicks and flicking "skill" which to an extent yes it is. 
---
But idk. I rambled a bit there. Long story short I dont care for those series as much because they aren't really original, and they aren't making things "harder" necessarily but rather just making everything more time consuming. Settled is at least going for ToB which is a great piece of content for osrs and is indeed pretty difficult. But even with that, hes gonna get "carried" because with what he has access to he wouldnt ever be able to solo ToB. So idk. 
---
holy shit wait theres a req on tears?!!! I had no idea I usually just do it without realizing. I guess the reqs are so piss easy that it makes sense I wouldn't realize them 
---
2 ticking is legitimately easier. Getting the birds set up is fucking retarded but once you get it, it's legitimately way easier than 3t
---
Thanks :)
---
I'm not sure you know what doxing means 
---
Then put your name there too, coward, smh my head.
---
Not really unless you're taking above a therapeutic dose. Or the wrong meds. I take dextroamphetamine and it calms me the fuck down and lets me sit in one place and not be doing and thinking about a million different things at once. I also sleep a lot better while I'm on it too. Ritalin will make me look like a crackhead though. 
---
No, not a single response was given. The only thing we knew was from PureSpam going to the osrs hq and getting the message: "Oh yeah we understand the storyline is accessible for one defende accs".
---
I cannot currently provide you info on the purpose part because I'm limited to my phone and I'm watching a movie in theater later.
---
At least a very big thank you for being more understandable about it, regardless if you agree or not. I think it's maturity this community lacks and consequently makes some of us seem like ragers without a reason

you actually think its 1/10? I threw out a massive range, I said 1/1k or 1/10k, maybe its 1/500(doubt it), all I know is it certainly aint anywhere near your 1/10 or 1/100 figures.
---
no but that would have been so fucking god if you were a 10 hp, skiller or pure iron would allow u to actually do shilo gem rocks.
---
OldNite RIP :(
---
Because OSBuddy’s gp/xp calc uses their API to set the price which is usually more accurate than the other calculators because they use other prices. But there’s also a lot of times where it doesn’t work right and it says that Zammy brews cost 300 gp to make when they require a Torstol. 
---
any update about Kanon of Kahlith?

Someone in my clan didn't log in for a while and it eventually came out that he pulled a gun on someone and they ended up killing him. Wild to find out after knowing his online persona.

A more iconic rivalry would be Wiki quest guides vs Slayermusiq1 quest guides.

Yeah I remember the 6 hour days.
---
Similar things regarding price are happening to obby set and rune arrows.
---
It's actually funny looking at the price graph of rune arrows. The moment it shoots up is literally the day the "99 ranged afk" video was released.
---
Ty makes sense, forgot to reply at the time.  
---
this is dope

Stupid af
---
Woox: \*cough\* \*cough\*

It's accurate for sure. Make sure you select the correct attack styles and the monster you chose is low defense. I use count draynor (hard) on the first sheet to compare melee dps.
---
that is soooo dope

Not sure if someone commented this already but fairy ring to haunted woods is way faster than ectophial

I did Tuna at the Rogue's Den (can click on fire &amp; bank from the same single space).
---
Went from 50-65 (boosted to 70 for Awowogei) in about \~2.5 hours or so with Cooking Gauntlets. Raw Tuna is same price as Cooked Tuna, so accounting for all the burned fish I probably spent about 30k or so. #frugalboys 
---
This seems worse somehow
---
That's not an option
---
To clarify this a little bit more, think about it like D&amp;D attacking.  You roll to see if you hit (attack) and then you roll damage (str).  Except, with range its just range twice.  70 -&gt; 75 ranged won't increase your chance of rolling a 12 during the damage roll, but you will get to successfully roll a damage roll more often.  It's kind of annoying imo.  
---
So your argument is that the previous quests in the series didn't require a certain defense level or have prerequisite quests that granted defense xp rewards so then this one shouldn't? If that is the case you are making, then every expansion on quest story lines would have to follow that formula. Obviously, the dev team wants to tie in the Elf and Fairy story line. Should they have ditched that idea, since the Fairy Tale quests are locked behind Nature Spirit and grant defense xp? Catering to a specific account build would limit the creative direction the content creators pursue.
---
Def pures willingly chose to limit themselves. It should go without saying that when you choose not to level a certain skill, you might not be able to access things.
---
Why should jagex cater to a specialty character type?
---
Just so you know mod weath just banned the accounts who had my items, guess that debunks it lmao
---
Only if it physically hurts when you drink it.
---
Not runecrafting? Are you sure? Ok then... SLAYER!
---
*CHEERS*
---
It is planned. I plan to do stats like XP per cast (with number of casts if you splash, his a 0, and hit max hit everytime), number of casts for next level, target level, and max level, as well as number of runes required to reach those numbers for each situation give above. Rest assured it is definitely planned.
---
&gt;The quest line has always been opened up for one defense pures purposely.
---
(X) Doubt
---
I have no experience with RS3 Prif, but from what I have read that is basically the best place in the game in terms of viable content per unit of space. I would love to see a centralized area for more endgame players.
---
Where's the herb sack?

The game is great BECAUSE you can build your account how you wish to, so fuck you bud o7

Shit at least the other guy just had a bad beard
---
Hey man dont talk shit about arcanists
---
This was a problem in blast furnace but they fixed it. Not sure how but probably made it deplet verry fast.
---
Seers course with teleport is brain dead
---
Ardy course is brain dead. You should get 99, aside from a time commitment the whole “kill me this is awful” isn’t real unless your unable to reddit or watch videos and movies at the same time you play

Best way to get cheapest membership is to buy online gold and then buy bonds with it. So much cheaper than just buying membership

Right now I’m trying to complete all of the hard diaries. After that, quest cape!
---
I’m done with 2 hard diaries and have significant progress on most of them! Working on getting smithing up and 96/100 combat
---
o i thought when it faded to black after gear setup it was end of vid so i closed, thx
---
Made it to 59 and died... took too many restores and not enough brews :'(
---
Pures are a thing because PvP is a thing in OSRS, sorry pvp doesn't exist in easyscape.
---
Don't use it if you don't want to. I'm not gonna twist your wrist.
---
Which means you give me the final word. Thanks
---
Yeah but... Mobile :(
---
Run Elite? What's that?
---
Swamp Lettuce
---
But that also incurs risk because it's RWT
---
U know thats afk right? U just click one spot. Its like alching. No one is gunna reply to u who is doing them. 
---
At least you know now for round 2!
---
Looks a lot easier than the sweaty prayer flicking sweets meta that currently exists
---
yeah, you are a brainlet if you 3t instead of 2t.
---
Pasty white guy saying "nigga". Yikes...
---
personally I run to the draynor patch after doing the falador patch with the explorer ring, though I'm doing the nightshades for money when I eventually get the herblore levels to make weapon poison++.  
---
since you're an ironman, weapon poison probably isn't worth much to you beyond like a couple of vials since you can't sell it for much.
---
The way I talk to people is fine, and the way I talk to subhumans doesn't matter. Is that better?
---
Wait...Whaaaat?
---
You can find 1&amp;2 in a box set for $5 at Walmart currently. Worth it for the collection! 
---
Did it work, PoliticalGiraffes?
---
the question was more along the lines of what does it offer me that other resources do not.
---
Someone else answered your question but I also want to note that I plant ranarrs in the Catherby patch since the diary bonus gives me increased herb yield there
---
But pants 
---
Reddit vs. Swampletics
---
Man I was *almost* excited for this response to have an actual meaningful conversation but I should have known that the first reply I got would have been a toxic one.
---
My youtube literally has my name on it. You have to do better than that my guy. This is 2019 don't you know? Whats my private email? What street did I move to 4 weeks ago? Shit whats my runescape login ? Imagine caring about censoring your license plate when its all public record anyway. But what should I expect from somebody who fucking posts on an online forum about "anarchy" lmfao. btfo homeboi
---
since I'm about 10 days from 99rc, no quest requirement can stop me.
---
Ah rip. Good luck next time around. What are your stats?
---
Thank you!
---
The amount of people crying over base 70s is sad
---
The rough outline of the whole year is 3 big updates with each one being in its own trimester. So this one should be middle trimester with warding come out third trimester 
---
Yep, that's why I have a credit union. Lots more attention if shit goes south.
---
Low farming and cons requirements were pretty weak though, higher reqs make it feel more like a high-level quest that you earned the right for. Pretty crazy it's got 8 skills @70 though
---
NUMBA WON!
---
Main btw
---
Never liked that fence. I support.
---
hol up... Zezima is a furry? 
---
Ranarrs and chemistry necklaces about to skyrocket

this is nowhere near the way u kite zilyana, this shits 384 iq

This is so good

 Can confirm
---

---
そうか
---
Shit most definitely. Remember when pokemon go came out? 
---
This looks like mod gee. 
---
tbf the quest cape is one of the most useful capes especially before you get poh fairy ring
---
Reported btw 
---
I love the idea of this as a skill over firemaking any day, but "it didnt pass poll, lets keep repolling xd" is not really a great way to do things 
---
Leprechauns note herbs for you
---
If you want to vote against quests then vote against quests. Other people who want that will also do that. Good luck though, quests almost unilaterally pass with 90% or more 
---
Well put! Easier way of explaining. 
---
Interesting to note!  I am pretty bothered at Jagex's stance of answering every little question, and purposely avoiding major questions.  And don't worry, I can appreciate pures and their concerns, and but overall they're 1 defense for the sake of pking, which I don't mind, but I don't think tailoring a grandmaster pve quest for them is warranted.  
---
Haha and I do see a lot of irrational hatred from people on this sub!  Sorry you and your buddies have to deal with that
---
I don't want to work for new content, I WANT IT NOW
---
pmods arent even required to do anything if they choose not to. at the GE, some pmod and his friend were talking and his friend is dropping racial slurs left and right and cussing out a 3rd party and pmod literally didn't care at all.
---
bad optics tbh
---
F2Ps claiming the whole world one acre at a time smh

Stock up on herblore and construction training supplies for mad profit once it's released.
---
Where the basalt and making friends with my arm patch?
---
Clue Step :p
---
SUPPORT. We need to keep this alive. It's killing the game for me.
---
Read this on the bus, and had to stifle my laughter.
---
While we're talking about him, has anybody thought about what his best in slot items would be? I've given it some thought and without Theatre of Blood, I think it would be
---
Full Guthans (Karil's/Ahrims for range/mage)
---
Rune kite (from rare drop table)
---
Rune boots
---
Abyssal whip
---
Glory
---
Combat Bracelet
---
A regular cape (or vestment cloak if he gets really lucky)
---
Does this seem about right?
---
Welp, now you know to take more brews. Learning is part of the process. 
---
There's a tweet from mod kieran explaining how before 99 low level herbs have lower yields than higher level herbs. At 99 they are equal yields.
---
it’s a good thing I just got 70 herb and hunter. now about that construction requirement..
---
Trying to find the best angle to get in there
---
Oops sorry I know the disconnect here. I accidentally used my 1/10 number with the active population. That's my mistake I meant 1/10 of appeal threads. Meaning of every ban, 1/10 is unjustified. Not that 1/10 of the population is unjustly banned. 1/10 of banned being unjustified actually feels too unfair as well because of bots inflating the ban numbers. Let me phrase it like this, excluding bans for obvious things like botting or autoclickig, such as bans for RWT or account selling, 1/10 is unjust, maybe 1/20-1/50. And as I said before the fact these people even exist is enough to warrant more resources in a support system. They clearly aren't such a minority they don't exist, we've seen jmod apologies here on Reddit so I can only imagine those that don't make a thread or those that don't get noticed. So if they are out there, what is the reasoning why it's good that we don't have at least an appeal system. Like the only argument is that requires a lot of resources from Jagex but come on. It's not like it's a revolutionary idealistic concept to have an appeal system. Almost all games have one nowadays. It's just lack of urgency.
---
Slayer masters are secretly affiliated with HAM.
---
LOLed out loud.  Thx for the laugh
---
For places: raids, it's "ok".  
---
Corporeal Beast - decent
---
Zulrah - decent, less switches more food.
---
Places where you wouldn't need to "tank" maybe.
---
For tasks: None, black mask/slayer helm wayyyyy better. 
---
Unless you camping kurask or something, not sure if people still do that. 
---
Mage minion also does not spawn in one square, it moves. So...

No one gives a shit

Get the bracelet first then the heart. Even eternal boots are trash so don't worry about those. Do you have a suffering?
---
Ok, Whats that puprle bucket is? 
---
RIP the 3 gp/xp pray pots
---
Pures originally became a thing a long time ago in order to optimize your damage at any given combat level.  It used to be extremely advantagous, now it's basically standard fair.  By keeping your attack/defense/prayer at specific low levels you can have your strength/range/magic higher than a "normal" account at that combat level- normal meaning an account that has their stats more evenly distributed.  
---
And now people moan and complain about any quest because they just want the cape
---
Think it is 7
---
Not sure why you would not want more content to pass. I know op is trolling but unless its a very bad update, (extreme ezscape, or another eoc shitfest etc) more content is always preferred.

Such a terrible idea to poll good lol it's a complete integrity issue
---
i wouldn't mind stiffles on the chest plate ornament
---
This is still prayer flicking with even more work
---
The same thing happened to me back in 2017. An active clan member suddenly went MIA. Later on, someone found his obituary.. also car collision. I still get pretty upset thinking about it. 
---
I dont give a shit but someone might  
---
Heres to the reddit lurker that 5 years down the road connects all this shit and submits your shit to hr
---
Thats the real mvp
---
I did! I even told him about this post, he often spends time on Reddit too. Chill guy.
---
Ouch that sucks. I scurry from town to town like a cockroach because I don't know what will kill me. Guards are now on the list
---
That's not how any combat works in osrs
---
Sure, but you're wasting time by running over to them, clicking an herb, then clicking the leprechaun. 
---
REEEEE level 2 defense
---
The alternate model for the Justiciar armour already exists in game, so I imagine it'd be a relatively time effective reward to add. There are plenty of people who wanted to see the alternate design in game, so the upcoming Treasure Trail Expansion would be an ideal place to add an ornament kit.
---
I do not, I've been using recoils.  I really want one but it's hard to justify the niche purchase of only zulrah
---
Yes very recently. You don't lose favour anymore.
---
Yeah they did a PC giveaway and I haven't heard about a winner or closing date for the drawing.
---
I'm pretty sure it was only polled once, and it was years ago. They have repolled things such as Divine Sigil, is it not ok to ask for a second Sailing repoll?
---
btw u gonna stay to netherlands to fuck hookers and smoke weed or gonna fly back to lithuania now that the girlfriend thing didnt work out?
---
The only good goblins are the ones that dont come out of their stinking holes
---
Does ft2 have a def requirement? I didn’t see it on the wiki. 
---
Sorry, I mistook the comment as something else. Well for the most part, the aim of this tool is to get on a more personal level as to what the users' goals for leveling are and assist in having to spend much less time finding out how much it would cost to get to your goal. Resources like efficiency in xp/hr are fantastic for theoretical yield under optimal play, however my tool is designed to give you the hard numbers to reach your goals whether you are doing 0-ticking strats or are at work and playing in the background. In these situations you are not playing sub-optimally and this is where hard numbers are superior to theoretical values at least in my opinion.
---
My tool also offers at a glance stuff like Slayer locations all in a single spot. No more having to google the mob name, read the wiki for where to find them; The information is in the tool that you would most likely have open anyways.
---
I meant in game, but still a great coincidence!
---
It does. You're getting a different roll for each brother you kill. Most every time you'll get duplicate items (or nothing at all) making it appear to be only a small number of rolls but you are still rolling. On your ironmeme its up to you. Personally, I don't even bother killing anything besides the brothers because that'll give you the most items/hr. 
---
FUCKING JACKPOT I KNEW THEM BASE 70 WOULD COUNT SOMEDAY

q p

Good timing on posting whilst people are checking youtube for Settled's new video ;)  
---
Always enjoy your videos though! Great progress as usual :D
---
Are people still bronies in 2019? I thought that self-deprecation meme died out like 5 years ago.
---
sparc mac was staking before the tax. worst case your odds pre tax were 50 / 50. tax means you always lose long term now.
---
GnomeLandsOnlyUim? 
---
OH FUCK
---
snuggle bear just wants to be taken seriously..
---
at the rate people  are underestimating him  soon he'll be wearing fighting boots, then we will all regret it
---
I'm just pissed that they continually increase the requirements for quest capes, pretty soon it will start requiring 90+ stats like in rs3 which makes the quest cape basically unattainable for anyone with a life
---
At least you can buy them both
---
If you can learn, try raids 1. Duoing or trioing is insane money. Getting even a dex drop is around a 30m split for a duo and is super common. I went from doing bandos and freaking out over a 1 bcp split to just expecting a 35m split from dex every 20 or so raids. And who knows you might fluke a t bow and be set for life. 
---
end game pvm, eg tob and solo raids even if you are awful at them is easily 5m an hour in pleb gear. solo raids1 -&gt; closer to 8m once good, tob closer to 12m.
---
a bow isnt 500 hours.
---
Haha when I was a noob I thought “Camelot” was only a place wizards could go cause I never saw it in game and only saw it in the teleports. I thought it was so cool. It was 2005 lol 
---
Doesn’t count, not btw man
---
Can you use it if your membership expires?
---
Remember using protect item! 
---
I refuse to go to bed until he uploads...
---
They could have say a 20 def, 50 agil req for an item to make the 20 def bracket more interesting.
---
So what do you say when someone asks what it is? 
---
Then do a tree run?
---
I think it’s members only 
---
I mean like they reposted the winners tweets that said "hey I won! Thanks jagex!" With picture of their prize
---
Mage- no where really
---
Melee- only at very high defense bosses like corp.  
---
Range- Only at very high range levels (90+) against low defense targets.
---
Especially during quests. One of my favorite parts of old school. Old quests that were made 15 years ago with old content and textures. Just so neat. Idk why. 
---
but he's number 6 in the list though.
---
Same, ive got an early start tomorrow :'(. pls.
---
No one has the requirements because none of us completed Fairy Tale 2.
---
I use that one for banking/fairy ring but I think yanille is still closest
---
I literally got my QPC yesterday with mostly just the base skill requirements for it. How long will 50 - 70 farming take ?
---
this is less effort than melee flicking by a lot
---
&gt;no one has tried to hack the account
---
Bitch I remember 11 year old me typing Zezima in the username box and typing gibberish for the password box like 1000 times one night.
---
If my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle.
---
It is not possible to win the majority of your duels "given enough time and enough tries" This is known as regression toward the mean.
---
Stakes have, at their core, a 50/50 chance. If there was no tax, and infinite tries, your money would move back and forth forever. Because there is a tax, it is taking money out of this system.
---
They announced any of the rewards yet? I actually wouldn't mind seeing something that would make 13-20 def viable over 1 def.
---
Neither Mazchna nor Konar, the only non-human slayer masters, give dwarven or elf tasks. Coincidence?
---
If this is a troll, well played. 
---
I remember back in RS2 when there was a massive bot ban which was actually effective for a bit. Pretty much all consumables and mats shot up in price. Was actually pretty annoying. 
---
Just told some people its from runescape, no shame
---
Not entirely true, I just re-purchased mems on my main (didn't tick recurring subscription) and I'll be getting billed on the 23rd of march. Paying $11 for 26 days when the standard in any other month is 30/31. There's definitely something fuckey with February.
---
Hey I’m interested in training up a F2P pure pking account and I’m wondering where would be the best to train. I’m thinking hill giants or flesh crawlers in the stronghold but I’m not sure.
---
Yeah, I've been trying it out over the last week or so. I'm already at 50 and I've been making mills off of it...doesn't seem bad at all.
---
u/datwinner explained an easy fix.
---
Than* Jesus I see this way too much 
---
It actually fits so well, please meme lords
---
I checked the wiki and I think you can wear the outfit in F2P worlds but you don't get the bonus
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Graceful_outfit
---
&gt; The weight reduction does not transfer to F2P worlds. 
---
Yupp i need to get up at 5am :(
---
f
---
no tick eat/shield flick = less work
---
It's gonna blow your mind to learn you can mix and match.
---
still lowers chances and world hopping is near impossible because 95% of worlds you change to are already empty. extremely lowers your farming speed
---
Why would it be a bug? It’s not in your inventory/bank so the chance to drop them still exists.
---
Bawahaahahah what an idiot! this is why my real bank pin and my in game pin are the same xD
---
Congrats man! I'm doing the grind to level 72 right now. CAN'T WAIT to unlock the upper level.
---
Low key, I would do this for an hour every evening for free. Last night I tried for like an hour to lure a GE gambling bot to the dark wizards.
---
Stop being poor!
---
But really. The game should not be catered at all towards specific account builds. Why would anyone vote for pure specific updates? They honestly shouldn't.
---
Sure, but you cannot guarantee you only win the big and only lose the small. You are thinking too small. This is a big picture view of staking.
---
and arent picking up marks
---
lol that is litterly my hardware.
---
If you wanted you could make a spreadsheet and calculate your profit over a few dozen herb runs with ranarr and avantoe or some other herb and just decide for yourself which one is better, but this is a lot of work. Honestly I think ranarr are probably still more profitable even at lower levels where you're breaking even sometimes, but when I was starting out farming I just didn't have the bank to stockpile a bunch of ranarr seeds, which was one of my primary reasons for doing avantoe.
---
This comic was so well done!
---
Honestly like it more than any Zuharr pic or [Neiteznot helm guy?] comic
---
https://twitter.com/SettledRS/status/1100856642135121921
---
I'm not a very high level yet so would have enjoyed attacking something with 23 combat over 82, but that's good knowledge to know too thanks
---
the wiki rates are tick perfect rates, 56300 at seers = no fail, no picking up marks.
---
pretty casually w/ tele you should aim for 45-50k
---
How about a Runescape engine that actually works... it’s sucks that almost every potential update is shot down due to “engine work”.. even ones that should be basic 
---
Too bad he uploads so late :(
---
Hey dementia isn't something you joke about
---
It's actually 87% but yes. At 881 reward potential, the average value of your bolt racks will be far lower than the average value of runes at 880 reward potential, so going from 880 -&gt; 881 unlocks a reward that's lower than the average drop value, lowering the average drop value as a result.
---
My roommate in the dorm in college did, it was a rough year.
---
Lol broke nub
---
UIM, hcim W E A K
---
No this is the same as telling a company you won't work friday, Saturday or Sundays and not getting hired. Then throwing a hiss about everyone ganging up on you and treating you unfair.
---
i9 9900k, rtx 2080 ti here, can't figure out how to activate the ray tracing for osrs
---
Thanks for clarifying. Definitely going after the runes, so I don't see a point in getting the bolt racks, then. It was more of a "might as well grab them while I'm here" sort of thing.
---
^^THIS^^
---
This made me rethink of doing slayer :(
---
Regardless of what you kill, it always rolls the drop chance of barrows items first
---
I dunno, after scrolling through the list of all games made on unreal engine there were maybe 3-4 that I had enjoyed, and my least favorite part of them being the game engine (Gears of War, Dishonored. Abzu, and Tribes Ascend) Having a unique engine is something that makes a game special and enjoyable and when its just another rip on the bong that its Unreal it gets a little lame. The new Resident Evil 2 Remake is a good example of a new game with a great new engine that made it really interesting.
---
Nice! I will be doing infernal eels to 99 once i get a few other things done.
---
Probably location based just like how my area still doesn’t have fiber optics available but a ton of places do. I’m 24 I played runescape growing up on dial up. I’m not exactly sure the point you were making but this is my response in case it was regarding internet speeds. 2007 was most definitely nothing like the 90s but internet was still painfully slow for me. I waited about 30 minutes to get on runescape. 
---
If youre going for 99 rc then Success. If youre going for combat then faliure.
---
D boots and ferocious gloves are BIS
---
None of your list even makes sense dude 
---
Maybe try disabling left-click attack or something, I don't have too much trouble right clicking to move between spots though personally. Idk, just never found it too bad. Kills can be slow without a spec hit, do you have arclight too?
---
I truly thought it was just a meme to pretend you were obsessed over ponies no matter the resistance people show you. I know it started on 4chan so maybe that's what it actually was. Kind of like how 2007scape pretends we're all autistic gays
---
there is also a bonus to your yield, so make sure you wear it when doing herb runs
---
The vast majority of emails that start with Dear User, Player, Account Holder etc, and not your name or username, are a scam.
---
INB4 OP makes a post about he lost everything at the sand casino.
---
Get to birdhouses and passively get it up
---
"SAME"
---
Damn thanks.  Care to elaborate?
---
The Axe Hut is still decent XP for semi-AFKing on a non-Pure. 
---
You just want another iron rock mine to camp your bots in huh?
---
I acknowledge that I reposted this, but typo in title
---
Question, why do half the capes not follow the same color shceme
---
By this mean you have the trimmed color in different spots for each cape and the "main" color on different spots too. 
---
Shouldn't they all follow the same color patterns?
---
sweet jesus
---
Perhaps they could do a system to tell you which server has has the most people waiting for a game so if you want a game you know where to go, and if you just tping to castle wars to bank or skill you aren't immediately moved to a different server. 
---
what, rapier is still better for everything except cox and rune dragons.  Another reason its crashing is people are selling to get stats for new quest coming out.
---
Ok good, please stop trying to refute me then
---
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS this feels so much more natural have an upvote.
---
¯_(ツ)_/¯\\\
---
Thanks bot!
---
He doesn't need to level up to assert his dominance. Legends never die.
---
If Tolna's Dungeon was F2P, maybe it would serve its purpose as a training spot... Probably still not, but maybe. If we did move the fence, perhaps we'd also be able to get a buff to make those creatures less trash.
---
Though, I think this would also make Limestone F2P; not sure if that would cause any issues.
---
Any good guide you would recommend? say for 53 farming / 50 herblore?

Pures are restricted accounts built solely for effectiveness at a low combat in PvP. The fact that they can't operate in PVE is their choice, which is also why most pures (95%) have main accounts that they do the majority of the PVE content on.
---
I know what colin is getting at - the classic double up every time you lose and eventually youre up more than you lose and then stop staking then and there so youre up on the day. It doesn't work 99% of the time because you can have huge losing streaks and lose enough capital to continue + you'll most likely be back down the line.
---
Statistically speaking, which is the most objective view, yes, it is a negative EV venture and effectively, the best way for Jagex to remove cash in the game, and further effectively, controlling inflation indirectly
---
Me back in the days trying to catch a sudowoodo with only 5 pokeballs
---
...you do realize that he's not able to leave morytania, ie no access to hydra or gwd.
---
He tweeted that the vid will be up in 30 minutes about 40 minutes ago so expect it any secind. 
---
Clearly you are stupid because 1) You only use mage at olm, where defence doesn't matter at all and you don't lose ticks when drinking a brew. 2) In team raids you barely take damage anyways, you rarely drink brews during a fight, so again no difference in dps since you don't lose any ticks. 3) If you are talking about Solo Raids, I'll agree with you, but I'm talking about team raids. Also, I've never said Void is better than Arma Bandos setup, I simply said the differences are minimal. Minimal as in in a regular trio it might save you like 10-20 seconds per raid.

&gt; The future of crypto is bleak atm  
---
If you mean the future of current coins as they are, then sure. If you mean the future of crypto in terms of blockchain, then I definitely disagree.
---
I always wear it for the yield mostly for the flex. Untrimmed farming with pet uk I'm wearing that shit 
---
I love that my idea from the agility guy is branching off. This is what I’m talking about
---
This ruined my childhood memories.
---
Add a farming guild tele + the two Basalt + Harmony Island teleport + Elf City telep.......

Easily in the 100m+ range per day.

All old accounts get converted to RS3 accounts btw
---
Sounds like something a j mod should reply to
---
But I assume somewhere in the 10s
---
Make sure to do three runs aswell, fruit trees in particular. Very cheap and you only need to check them once a day to harvest. Also, being able to pay so they dont die is a nice addition aswell.
---
hes 18ish -- see https://youtu.be/BDHGRvvKhNg?t=956

Fuckin A man so amazing to see tho!

AKA martingale strategy.
---
Personally i think duel arena tax is the best update jagex has released. Right next to grand exchange.
---
😤

Very helpful, as I just dealt with this today as well as someone last night staying in my house after being added to ignore and being reported by multiple people.

It was mainly used for rune dragons and cox
---
In before angry mob of pures 
---
What’s the point of this? Never heard of or seen anyone use it 
---
Seems reasonable to me +1
---
Ironmen choose to limit themselves yet they get constant updates i don't see the intention in your posts?
---
Doggo cubed 
---
Is it bad that I find this hilarious? I’ve never heard of it before. I’m sure it is annoying though.
---
Am I right in thinking this is the same mechanic that let people do zero prayer cerb kills? 
---
Unless I'm mistaken a HCIM was de-ironed for that, so if you're an Ironman you might not want to do this.  In my opinion this is totally fair play since it's still a high effort and imperfect method, but jagex may not agree.
---
When doing Fairytail part 1. 
---
For sure! Never been much of a PvP person myself but, once I get Max CB, I might try it out. This video has shown me that I was correct in my assumption to stay the hell out of PvP worlds. 
---
Dboots are gwd and ferocious gloves is Zeah. Neither gwd or Zeah are in Morytania.
---
Damn right in the feels....I’m a monster 
---
I just don't understand your people's way of thinking in which you believe current big banks/govt will just let their money wilt to nothing so some dudes mining bitcoin can become the richest people in the world. It won't happen.
---
Being internet famous is a gift and a curse 
---
How about this, and in addition your character's butt increases in size until you're thicc at 99, and all level 1 agility players have flat butts.
---
Not only does this give motivation for f2p players to become members, but great motivation for everyone to train as well unless you're going for a flat butt only HCIM.
---
Did you even read what I said?
---
not everyone is at a loss but anyone who didn't cash out during december made a massive mistake.
---
feel like shit rn, just want my weekly swampletics video
---
Especially since so many peopl camp kbd and Vorki has a super high drop rate compared to most heads
---
oof bruhhh
---
Exactly. No one uses it because you don’t share the experience/kill count.. you can’t attack the same out in single target, there’s no minimal requirements (only can partner when slay lvl is 10 apart) and there should be.
---
I'm FTPS
---
Probably shouldn't, but it isn't that bad of an addition. I'd rather have seen it be "dense clay rocks" or something like it where you mine 2 clay at once; then you'd still use the bracelets to make it soft. But I don't see anything wrong with better clay rocks behind a high-level quest.
---
And I disagree that being underwhelming is a reason to oppose content. It may be underwhelming to you, but that doesn't mean it has no place or role and everyone feels the same way. A lot of the smaller pieces of content that have become an iconic part of the game could have been considered underwhelming at its release, but if they were cut because of that it would have a notable impact on the game. Not every update or addition needs to be strong or substantial and sometimes updates that are just there can be good.
---
&gt; They've seen a resurgence in demand because of mahogany protection
---
See..I thought they were good because of that, so I farmed yanillan hops for like 2 weeks-4 weeks during my farm runs.
---
Until recently I found out that jute gives a higher yield and sells for more per piece.
---
In most cases you'll use a scim because it has the quickest attack speed (it attacks once every 4 ticks compared to a sword's once every 5 ticks). However, you can also take into account the weapon's attack types compared to your opponent's defense. Gargoyle's for instance are fairly weak to crush attacks so a leaf-bladed battleaxe (which has a high crush bonus and uses a crush attack) is more effective than a dragon scimitar (which is a slash weapon).
---
Yeah, I know, I just want to have the account itself back.

it is funny for people seeing us hosts running around, but in a way from our perspective its so annoying and us hosts need a way to address a problem like this.

I noticed you said you can get any clue scroll drop to reset the wizards. I’m wondering if this mean you can juggle clues to infinitely reset them. Possibly dropping your “good clue” after you spawn them, but before you kill them and picking up your dummy clue. You could also try dropping your dummy clue in a different world before spawning them and hopping to pick it up after you kill the wizards.
---
ty shandog. your input means so much! 
---
sara sword then bludgeon
---
Gonna be bit of an extremist here. How about just open up the entire Taverly and Burthrope area like they did around I think 2011 or 2012 on RS3. 
---
Just leave out the Warrior's Guild and Rogue's Den and everything in the Dungeon from Blue Dragon onwards (F2P has Antipoison now, so there shouldn't be concern about the Poison Scorpions there). Obviously, also leave out Herblore and Druidic Ritual. Maybe also open up Witch's House and Death Plateau quests as well. 
---
And yes, I know Climbing Boots may be a split thing, but if you don't want F2P access to them, just make them only equipable on member's worlds only. 
---
Then you’d better go catch it!
---
It's less cancery than abyss rc tho. Just do an hour or so a day while you watch a stream of whatever and it's not that bad. 
---
You don't see the level 3 skiller community sulking because they CHOSE TO LIMIT THEMSELVES and are now unable to do these quests.
---
Search swampletics on YouTube and you will come across his series. It’s insane
---
oof
---
Definitely just get bandos for slayer. You can always sell it, but if justiciar is buffed, I doubt it would be better than bandos for slayer as its meant to be a tank armor.
---
Bils. I alone doing slayer leave around 1mil worth of items on ground each day while slaying. Small coin drops, trash armor/weapons, low lvl herbs and seeds, elemental runes, bones, unnoted resources etc.
---
And as there is hundreds of servers with hundreds of players 10b worth of stuff left to despawn is quite realistic.
---
I've seen many get to 99 with dragon, but I'm not sure other than maybe God swords.
---
Withdrawal symptoms are getting intense .. idk if I’m gunna make it ..
---
i dont use restores but on some longer kills i'd be down to like 10 pray points at the end of the kill before i started using mace 
---
Get a full invent charged at once, that should last you 135 days until the next 2 minute trip to Eluned.
---
Have your tank do this and still have two people doing dps. Holy crap, you could stay there forever.
---
One bad pmod doesn’t speak for them all
---
Oof
---
Abby Whip I think
---
Runecrafting become brain dead after a while too. I can simply listen to a podcast, music or just chat with some friends and after a few minutes turn my brain off for a few hours.
---
Someones using reason in this thread?
---
Quick get your pitchforks.
---
Saradomin sword or abbysal dagger if 70 attack, however the abyssal dagger is a bit more expensive though.
---
support definitely
---
Mr. Bigshot over here. Everyone watch out!
---
You can safespot him in some of the rooms
---
Well there goes my quest cape
---
Yes because someone who has 10s of millions of gp to throw away can sink it all into hydra in konar and make millions of gp as long as they want. Stupid idea. 
---
Its all here... in your head... and runecrafting will help you on the way to maxing, no doubt about that.... no? well... better be.... AGILITY!!!!!
---
It's called programmed thoughts. You can tell they're NPC's when you compare Settled to the other content creators, and realise that their content is basically the same.
---
Fairy Tale 2 requires Nature Spirit, which gives 13 def.
---
How much gp were you thinking at say 99 slayer?
---
Still superior to bronies 
---
I love the expression on the bird's face!
---
You don't even want a fixed 30 days memberdpship.
---
1 payment per the 12 months is 365 days.
---
A payment every 30 days for 12 payments is 360 days.
---
This is me everytime I get a sherlock step in my master clue.
---
Fake.
---
longest 30 min of my life

Because it's on the company to go after them and they usually don't have the resources

You can look at previous poll results in-game.

Used to afk there on my 1 1/2 hour commute every day I loved it got 82-91 fishing doing that over about 2 months xD

People over exaggerate MEP2. It's literally 45min quest with staminas and a quest quide.
---
So what no skipping with points anymore?
---
Still no pyromancer.  Not sure why you were hating on him. 
---
you're hard
---
Were you wearing a glory?
---
At least in the states violating a games terms of service is not unlawful, but puts users at risk of losing their accounts. As long as someone posts that they you have to understand they are not at all liable and you are...then they’re usually fine. 
---
Imagine training prayer at a POH in 2019
---
At 74+ farming you get about 90-100k xp/hr at tithe farm while getting the outfit. It’s a win win to get the outfit and other items. Getting the outfit will not hinder your gameplay. Who cares though, it’s just a game.
---
not often you can say that about a basement dweller
---
I'm so ready to meet Swampletics
---
What app shows these stats?
---
Quest is needed for hard clue so a few of us like myself begrudgingly did it
---
For inferno that is 1 and 1/4th of a pray dose. Doesn't sound like much but if you are learning believe me
---
How would you get points? Are you thinking of adding a minigame like GOP?
---
who hurt you
---
You lie..
---
What's a bank
---
Congratulations, /u/Sloob . To the top you go
---
I DON'T SEE IT YET REEEE
---
Hadn't really thought about the Gp scaling too much. But i'm probably gonna assume maybe 500k or more at 99. As people have stated, if you get Hydra tasks, you can just make easily make money back and keep skipping
---
So it was a lie.
---
Do a google search for edge dungeon monkey bars.

Patience my brother, enlightenment will come soon.

So this isn’t the right place? 
---
That's pretty much any skill in RuneScape lol
---
Ok, imagine i hit under 10 for so many hits (the number of stakes doesnt matter as its also dependent on the duration of the stakes and so the opposing players hits) then the odds are much more likely that ill hit big during the next hits. Not guarenteed, but more likely. Therefore if you wait until you hit low for an extended period of time and then switch to bigger stakes, or even the martingale system, you will end up winning theoretically. Obviously this wont happen every time, but its more likely than just doubling up and hoping.
---
Jagex sent me a mini poster when they modded my pure back in 2006. That's the only thing I've ever seen given away, and it was under the radar.
---
Im not tho lol i genuinely didnt know they were called “warm gloves” not pyro gloves. Then pointed out he still got pieces of the mini game armor before the pet
---
Yes.
---
Wtf chill!
---
literally did the same thing a few months ago but didn't make front page :thinking:
---
You are aware that this wasn't possible since the release of combat dummy and spec pool so about 1.5-2 years ago. 
---
Damn, beat me to it
---
So I was thinking about how the current farming guild works with their contracts. I have a plan as to how it would work lore wise for runecrafting, but essentially, a person would task you with going out and crafting X amount of runes of a specific type (You'd only be given tasks of runes you have the level for), and in return you'd get points towards the shop, and maybe some bonus experience.
---
What is it supposed to be, then? Is it not based on RS? Do other MMOs have slayer skills? Makes sense I guess
---
The game doesn't even use your gpu
---
Not so fast
---
no. we wait for the man himself to post it here. 
---
v
---
Yeah, but unless I'm mistaken it was the same "red-x stops the enemy moving when you're under it" thing; the boat just happened to be in the right place to let you do it at cerb.
---
And? So youre telling me you can distinguish between an actual person clicking the same place and a bot clicking the same place? Its impossible unless the bot is just retarded. 
---
Lol no thanks. Sounds like dead content.
