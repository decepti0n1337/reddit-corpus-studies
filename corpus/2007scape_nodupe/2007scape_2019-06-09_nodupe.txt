Jagex is bitch to Fukong Interactive, a Chinese owner company which pushed the RS3 microtransactions to what they are today. OSRS's success and the community's consistant refusal of microtransions seem to be the only "integrety" Jagex can sit on. I used to pay $5 a month until my card expired my second year on OSRS and now from $10 to $11.  Bonds are in OSRS too. Hose mad

I wouldn't blame that to the bots mainly, although their number is increasing. Its mostly players are old and everything is about efficiency and making most gains in the least amount of time possible. What happened to just chatting in Grand Exchange? :(

It depends on the task and how much cash you want to spend for convenience.  You need to pray for Abby specs for example, but you can tank stuff like nechs or Abby demons.  You just might need to restock on food instead of doing the entire task in one trip.  I usually take a few pots and pray piety instead of melee.
---

---
Also you will usually need to protection prayers in multi.

Try it out yourself and see.

Ive seen bots talk like that before tbh, maybe they are supposed to say that in a  private clanchat. Coule be a custom script that wasnt tested well or just broke

I'd like an armour set/item with that effect, but I don't think black knight armour is the right match for it; most demons are, like the black knights, also followers of Zamorak.

I could be wrong, but if you can get them from other tier clues they may not be on the easy log

I'm not saying it's not viable, I'm saying that even with Legacy mode, it's still too easy and not fun.

Well you've got 3 choices.
---
1. Niche content that may not be used regularly.
---
2. Power-creep content.
---
3. No content at all.
---
So take your pick. I pick 1.

Hence why I said iirc he streams. Also a while back he polled whether or not he should take a sponsor. And it was an overwhelming yes from the community. Not like I know for sure it‚Äôs assumption.
---
You‚Äôre either a really bad troll or really dumb.
---
Not only that, but the osrs discord bot keeps track as well.
---
All bots were able to spread into a 10x10 square and attack NPC's simultaneously. bots started in lumbridge and walked to varrock and beyond
---
Except they do. See: their entire YouTube channel whenever they pronounce Guthix and even their pronunciation video.
---
That's definitely what I was looking for, is there a published guide to parsing and associating item-ids/pulling all data in a single json/xml object?

I got it from people and i can't keep relying on that

Neither can I. :\\

Hmmmm.. good question. I think the non-trimmed color is more of a charcoal. Maybe that needs a change

Mod Weath is on holiday.

because the game is meant to be a challenge you idiot.

Why is the first one the highest xp/h?

There we go

Couldn't they do this and then monitor the increase of quest completions to find the bots?

buy a few bonds and sell them on the ge

Yeah I'm looking forward to playing around in New Hosidius, but these updates have got me really interested in what's to come in Zeah for the first time.
---
Yep, RS3 has put a lot of focus on lore and quests - RS3 is actually now in the 6th age following The World Wakes.

Yeah we need to set up an AMA for this guy. A true gf buyer out in the wild.

I can't load PoE or OSRS. I have Spectrum too.

I average like 30 k a run dude and mort hard is way too much

They've been popping up everywhere

I'd say you should be fine. You'll be comfy enough.
---
I got super lucky, drop rate was around 1/8 so I'm not a good example.  But with mort hards I made around 8m
---
If you have cellular connection on your device try that. I also have Charter Spectrum so it may be a problem with their network
---
A job is hands down the best money-maker in the game. If you can make $11 an hour, that's over 7m an hour right now. Better than raids
---
every ~10 runs your pouches will degrade and hold less essence, you can NPC contact the dark mage to fix your pouches remotely so they still hold a lot of ess

It's mostly just bad blood and MTX. I enjoy both games, and tbh I think I prefer rs3 because I don't really know what to do in OS anymore. Raids are all I have left but I can't be bothered sadly.

Yeah, life must be so rough with a tbow

No I just comment to see all of you little fangirls get butthurt and embarrass yourselves. Congrats you played yourself

Oh man, you must be great with people. And I'll save you some time and write your shitty predictable response for you: "well you're obviously a shitty person so you can fuck off." Clearly the sign of a saintly, virtuous person.

Okay, thanks for the comment.

You can disable the house favor thing under settings. If you didn‚Äôt know lol.

Real chads just buy a new one each raid.

its funny cause europe has commited countless genocides but thinls they can talk bad about americans

Yea just switch the setting for your bag. It says something about being able to close with hot keys, turn that off and it‚Äôll go back to normal

Years ago when I played, I hated farming. Now I'm level 75 with no effort thanks to herb runs and hardwood trees. Growing teaks/mahogany trees on fossil island is great. They take a couple days to grow but 3 mahogany trees is 45k xp. You're there doing a bird house runs so you're already there.

Very shorty after she agreed to go on a date and it looks like we are gonna meet up whenever she is free next weekend.

Personally think rs3 graphics are absolute shit. I cant tell what anything is.
---
what are you referring to?
---
this question has been asked in some form or another 1000 times lol. short answer is that jmods estimated oshd would take basically a full year to make with no other major updates and so it's not happening.
---
Thanks I will try that
---
You should be fine with just eagle eye. I used that strat with a lower Range level and it worked pretty easy, although I was on task.
---
I had 1 farming back in the day. Or actually, prolly the same as I do now, since I used DDS a lot, so I must have done fairy tail. I think I had 1 construction for a while. I'm fairly sure that I was around before they introduced it. I played around 06 and slightly before and after. I quit before summoning was introduced. 
---
I really wanna start doing birdhouse and herb and stuff but I havent done those quests yet and I am still trying to do a few other quests I need for skilling, armor and pre-reqs.
---
84 is where it's at. Then there's really nothing else until 90 so you can boost for the tree and ring combo
---
Yes

Yeah it‚Äôs sooo crazy bud

I‚Äôd assume luminol, and bleach, or something along those lines anyways 
---
Or diphenyl oxolate, and hydrogen peroxide
---
With some sort of dye in either scenario

You realize they don't do anything but gain from bots buying bonds/other resources that get taken out of the game when accounts are banned don't you?
---
lol u sneaky boy I see what u did there ehu ehu
---
Your visafe
---
Because people are really stupid. Kind of the reason 100% only polled updates doesn't work too great.

But we only have mostly that now because Jagex fucked up so much in the beginning so it's kind of pick your poison now lol.
---
RuneLite work
---
Lol
---
lol
---
Yeah, I made it to 92fm on my HC recently.  The mourner was difficult, but if you get your attack up on combat dummies in varrock(?) to use steel weapons and wear your Ironman armor with some salmon/tuna/cakes, you should be fine.  It's very worth it even just for the ardy cloak to tp out of danger.
---
For Wintertodt still hitting 1s, Google the Wintertodt damage calculations, a jmod released them a while ago, you can see Wintertodt's max hit against you at your current firemaking and hitpoints levels.  As your firemaking level increases, you can gain a few hitpoints levels and still take 1s max.
---
Yeah obviously your experience is the only right one, even though the other guy personally experienced the opposite. It's almost as if both could be possible under different circumstances.

The problem with vanguards is they punish having high dps lol

if you talk to the captain guy in the shaman slayer caves (in the swamp) and have him ‚Äòmake‚Äô the slayer helm immune to acid then yes, you can wear the slayer helm over a shayzien. 
---
shamen‚Äôs acid attack isn‚Äôt actually poison, even though it does poison you, it will deal a ton of damage regardless of antidote **if not wearing shayzien armor**

They are not simply part of the problem, those pathetic cunts who buy from gold farmers are the root-cause.
---
How isnt there a spinner in Morytania
---
They should have never sailed in the wildy
---
Nazi! Facist!
---
The entire point is that practically stops nothing, that‚Äôll effect new players coming into the game, bots already gather the quest points so they can dump everything on the GE. 
---
If you‚Äôre trying to advertise the game to new players, why are we advertising f2p instead of members?? That‚Äôs the entire point of the promotion, getting players to test out the game by immediately jumping into the full experience. Existing players will understand what to do but new players will be stuck in f2p, most likely get bored because f2p offers no content, and quit.
---
The promotion is to get new players roped into the game, with a restriction like that we only push them away further. The difference in immediately available content between f2p and p2p is colossal. If you want to rope people in you have to get them immediately started by giving them everything unlocked. First impressions are what will keep player retention, first impressions are so significant to this. That‚Äôs why Jagex is making the game more accessible for that extremely early content, so the game is more impressionable to noobs.
---
Realistically, the promotion is for new players, my entire point is that restriction will significantly affect new players and retention rates while not solving the issue at hand whatsoever.
---
Just shower if you plan on going out that day.

Exactly.

You can use your  Guthix Rune scimmy trim in free to play.

Feel bad for your friend when you recover that account in a few months
---
It's pathetic that it's remained this way for over a couple years now. This should be a priority.
---
Dude. Sounds like my first hespori kill. Really embarrassing haha. Thing kept hitting 40‚Äôs and I didn‚Äôt know why.
---
&gt; and that one person decided to **split** instead of stay and either sell it and share the profits or hang out and continue raiding
---
I know the meaning you're after but it still feels weird when you say they decided to split (the loot instead of keeping it to themself) instead of staying and selling it to share the profits(called splitting)
---
&gt;now they just added it in as a QoL adjustment anyway
---
Now they didn't lol. They added it as an integrity change because it's a game balance issue. They never should have polled it in the first place.
---
Not consistent with my experience
---
Looks like it gives you cancer
---
laughed hard es good
---
How about putting a spoiler tag?
---
Don‚Äôt they respawn?

You don‚Äôt get to tell people what they can find funny.

man why you gotta help them bots with tips on how to create accounts easier
---
You have to right click the pic to the left of where the word ‚Äúside-panels...‚Äù are
---
to be fair, emblem farming bots aren't really negatively impacting pvp. they're negatively impacting the game, and they happen to be in pvp, but they are mostly sequestered to their own corner of the wildy.
---
I will ALWAYS upvote TPB memes on this sub
---
Gp depends on the quests involved. I do this often, PM me if you‚Äôre interested.

I fucking love this. Thank you.

That‚Äôs..that‚Äôs impressive
---
You're right I didn't, nor did I say I did. That's why I gave an example situation where it might happen... At least read what I typed if you're going to reply to me.
---
Don't let people tell you that this looks good. It's absolute shit.
---
That being said, you can only get better. My biggest tip for any artist is to find a group of friends to share work with. The only way to get good at this kind of stuff is to work on it for months on end with no breaks.
---
Lack of motivation is what stops most artists from being great. Finding friends who share your passion can give you that boost you need to keep going.
---
This was me back in 2009, lol.

~~I still don't have either of them.~~

Only kap'n K'nuckles would put him up to this

Broken mechanics are not consequences. I did choose to limit myself and i understand if someone attacks something i dont get the loot, i get that. I shouldn‚Äôt be wasting constant hours of time killing things over and over however only to find out that the boss attacked someone when my eyes were glazed over. Not them attacking the boss, the boss attacked them.

Just blood runes. They're very afk.

Shpupdnt the splat be on the boat and a 0 on the iceberg?
---
Too bad most comments are trolls because I am looking for the same thing.
---
Because it's God Ashe
---
Lmao
---
this is the opposite of the purpose of the series. the whole idea of locking your account to an area is that you are subject to the restrictions of that area. if you just ask ash to help him circumvent the restrictions he placed *on himself*, then what's the point of the series?
---
like, if swampman really really wanted to get ash to put in something stupid like a spinning wheel, could he? probably. it'd just be dumb.
---
Nah, it's just blood runes. Less intensive than abyss running, better exp, makes more money.

My opinion is there should be trade limits put in effect based on total level or quests. At a certain threshold they would be removed entirely.

I can't part with it.

For a noob like me it is. Look up my stats - chef tayy
---
The fairytail quests are super handy for the fairy rings, there's a few you'll want to do to unlock some areas. Druics for herb, I forgot the one for Mort, but do it for slayer
---
I'd train your CB stats up with slayer and do Lost City and then Monkey Madness to unlock the dragon weaponry at 60 attack.
---
You never heard of fashion scape bro?
---
TIL
---
I may get flamed for this but how do you know if hes botting? I just returned to this game and there are times i interact with other players if we're in a small map but most the time i ignore everyone else unless someone directly calls for me. 
---
Apart from the obvious name and default style I have yet seen or noticed anyone "botting" maybe i'm just outdated but yea how would one even tell what was his give away
---
how many tries did it take to get the pet? were you on a slayer task? i'm about to go for the pet
---
He used the small net for Hunter after they added it for his series, I don't see why a spinning wheel would be any different.

I like that it's not filtered, it helps on mobile

1: Check your host files and make sure there's nothing RS related
---
2: Clear/flush your dns and use Google/Cloud Flare any other DNS setting

3: Ensure your IE Browser is not using a VPN/Proxy setting that detects system proxy just turn it off completely (You may have an application that uses some proxy feature)

4: If all fails call your isp

Just start knocking out the ones you have the skills for, even if they don't reward much its still fun, Iv always thought quests where fun. Pest control is great to level combat too

thanks bro! means a lot! i put a lot of effort into these

Looks to me like you expected a brigade to form out of this post.

Doesn't appear to have worked. Also noting the irony in the post, in the fact your posting here and intending a swarm of SJW people to descend and harass for it resembling a lynching over the internet.

Nah shit fills up too fast. I get a full bank every week because fuckers have to bring their rune platskirt t pking instead of regular rune platelegs. God fucking 5 types of blessings (no one brings zammy), all the god coifs, all the god vambs.. fucking shit eats ur bank space

Yeah, one of the few things I really enjoyed about RS3 were some of the quests. They really went hard on building the lore with some great cutscenes.
---
Well, off the top of my head, you‚Äôve got the troll herb patch for ranarrs and easy snape grass spawns on waterbirth (I‚Äôm assuming you can go to waterbirth with your limitations). So you‚Äôve got prayer potions.

You‚Äôre talking to the community who just watched a man spend 532 hours temple trekking to get 1/4 of the way to 99 slayer.

Nobody‚Äôs gonna have any sympathy for your sub optimal prayer restoration methods.

okay?

Underrated comment
---
Reworking Torags to be actually good would ruin its true purpose: being cheap t70 tank armor. Torags chest really is good for tanking hits, it just doesn't do anything other than that like all the "better" options, so the only people who use it are those who can't afford the better stuff. But 2-300k for those stats is a steal in absolute terms.
---
99 range here with eagle eye and dragon darts BP you can't put dps them

What's wrong with that? He isn't a botting expert, but he does understand (or at least care about) the game. Food critics don't have to be professional chefs etc etc.
---
Bot solutions are gonna be more complex than the average redditor will know about. Whacking in game requirements on stuff clearly doesn't help, check out chinchompas and green dragons some time
---
What? I uses those sk√∂ll boots (?) To get 99 agility with double xp on courses. Agility training was fast like 150k/h+ or something
---
How many days did it actually take tho, as in logged into your account
---
&gt;Reworking Torags to be actually good would ruin its true purpose: being cheap t70 tank armor. Torags chest really is good for tanking hits, it just doesn't do anything other than that like all the "better" options, so the only people who use it are those who can't afford the better stuff. But 2-300k for those stats is a steal in absolute terms.
---
I agree it's a cheap tank armor alternative, but, I'd love to see more options with it is what I meant. Like, my only issue with it is the weapon. If somehow it was 1handed (which will never be honest) it would have way more uses. I understand why its not tho, just wish it was kinda haha

Ye being an Ironman means there are no bots at chins thanks

i have 1b bank and still have 300-350 empty spaces lol. literally wtf are you hoarding.

Petition to move Morytania to the GE in the Falador Party Room next to the GE.

As long as you kill them before jad is full health, you normally hit each once to pull agro then just kill them before back to jad.

I just made a banking alt to hold most of my shit for me.

Go wander around and kill the gorillas...

Same wtf?
---
Quest cape doesn't take as long as people think
---
You also start the game with a small net
---
Sell your loot tab, I care more about untradeable quest items then I do about my loot tab
---
and it requires ghost ahoy so swampyboi can't do it &gt;:D
---
1 magic too? Have you used teletabs to move around the map?
---
What kind of account build are you going for?
---
Everyday or every other day at minimum. Here are the first 8 in my Nexus‚Äî
---
Varrock
---
Lumbridge
---
Fally
---
Camelot
---
Ardy
---
Watchtower
---
Canifis
---
Kourend
---
Though I see how the first 8 is enough for some people, I say the rest is necessary when you get into more content or higher lvls‚Äî 
---
Lunar Isle is needed for Vorkath/ fast way to Relleka
---
Catherby for tree/herb runs; also close to charter ship to Zulrah
---
Troll stronghold for herb runs, GWD
---
Annakarl/Ghorrock/Carrallangar are for Wildy slayer and fast travel around wildy for clues or pk
---
Exam centre and ape toll Ive only used for clues so theyre not as necessary but nice to have.
---
had me eye rolling, well done.
---
Man I remember my first time doing it... It was on a pure with 71 range back in 2009. I wore it literally wherever I went even after I got my combat skill capes.
---
That wasn‚Äôt the first change, it was held upright as well
---
Gratz bro! I got mine 2 days ago, still no skill cape tho
---
Update: I can get on the runescape websites now. Gonna redownload the client and see if I can go online.
---
Now we only need lobbying to have perfect democracy
---
Not if you include what I'd need to spend to actually get my range up to snuff for that.
---
They added the net because it is used / potentially used in one of the quests. I think the swampletics episode is called like 'It all hangs on one fish'. The quest asks for a food item and one of them you can fish in burgh de rott. It makes sense for their to be fishing equipment nearby (shop or item on the ground, guess they went with item on the ground.)
---
Thanks. :D
---
*drops bandos boots here
---
*godsword shards here
---
yeah dead right well good shit and keep having fun brotha
---
We D2 now
---
Good job.

Barrows is good for consistent gp even without mort hard completed. The R.D. wiki star guide has some very useful information

Right next to Fossil Island 2

Almost as if players can have options that not everybody has to like.

I've got another confession to make
---
I'm your fool
---
Everyone's got their chains to break
---
Holdin' you
---
Were you born to resist or be abused?
---
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
---
Are you gone and onto someone new?
---
I needed somewhere to hang my head
---
Without your noose
---
You gave me something that I didn't have
---
But had no use
---
I was too weak to give in
---
Too strong to lose
---
My heart is under arrest again
---
But I break loose
---
My head is giving me life or death
---
But I can't choose
---
I swear I'll never give in
---
I refuse
---
Has someone taken your faith?
---
Its real, the pain you feel
---
You trust, you must
---
Confess
---
Oh
---
The life, the love
---
You die to heal
---
The hope that starts
---
The broken hearts
---
I've got another confession my friend
---
I'm no fool
---
I'm getting tired of starting again
---
Somewhere new
---
What would he "the gear" and what do they drop ?
---
Is there flax in Lumbridge?
---
Battery settings i think. It doesnt happen whem phones charging for me
---
I can go on the websites, but no access to the game yet. No VPN, no phone data...Hobbled.

same
---
Mackerel can only be fished with a big net im p sure, the small net wont help with that
---
As a player in that middle level tier right now. This update would help tremendously. I‚Äôm finding it hard to transition from easy bosses such as KBD and narrows to things such as GWD, Zulrah, Vork, and Raids. Would help me out a ton!

Yall xritiquing the art but ima critique that this lads obviously never had a spirit shield; its the wrong way
---
I'm looking to get into group pvm as i find solo a bit mind numbing at times. With the fall of the forums and the rise of reddit/discord, is there a better place to find some pvm clans? Would like to browse some options
---
I don't think it's funny so no one should hurrdurr
---
I‚Äôm gaining xp not losing it??
---
I've been to chins and green dragons since they added restrictions and they were still flooded with bots.
---
No it wouldnt. It would make it better for legit players because less bots would be doing it.
---
Oh good for a second there I thought it was rs3
---
Probaballistically
---
The poll system is fine. In fact it's the only reason OSRS is as great as it is. Not a fan of you people that are acting as if polling is a terrible thing that needs to be removed. Without polling OSRS would fail.
---
Its ok someday you might be able to clear the fight caves
---
Always log out at jad kids, deep breaths, a bathroom break and a glass of water go a long way.
---
It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs an addiction, you can play this game as a hobby while maintaining a healthy life style. It‚Äôs unhealthy to be in the state of mind he is currently in and anyone in that state of mind about this game should quit cold turkey. There‚Äôs a vast difference between deciding to spend your entire Saturday playing the game for fun and the game consuming you in a multitude of ways. 
---
There are a lot of healthy hobbies you can participate in that will genuinely benefit you alongside playing video game for fun. Addictions are dangerous because they get worse over time and gaming addictions is a serious issue. I had gaming addiction with WoW back years ago and it got worse and worse over time.
---
I started making excuses to not go out with 
---
my ex and started making excuses to not go out with friends so I can play. I would spent all my free time playing WoW, this habbit lasted about 4-5 months or so. Once I realized what I was putting myself through I immediately quit. Now I can healthily enjoy any video game I want which makes everything so much more fun.
---
The problem with addiction is it sucks the enjoyment of the game, you play it because your mind craves it. You play it solely because you *need* to. Addiction is interesting and I genuinely recommend reading into it sometime
---
I don't think it's the worse thing possible. I also never said it should be removed. I just said both options are pretty bad. There are a lot of changes where a poll is very helpful, I personally don't think it should be all end all though.
---
Character will still only use there foot to attack.
---
Wtf is wrong with mage def? Trying to freeze in xerics wothout cape and weapon switch or some shit?
---
What should I use for fight caves? 62 def 75 range 70 hp
---
Did my first try with blowpipe and full blessed dhide and died on wave 52, any suggestions appreciated.
---
Well he got 27 last vid Soo my man is grinding
---
82 con only costs like 20m lol
---
How is this an integrity issue? It is way closer to a QoL feature than a integrity issue.
---
What monster is this?
---
Sell it then
---
It is true though, the numbers speak for themselves.
---
Just made mine yesterday with 80 construction. Got +5 on my first spicy stew
---
I tried it for a few weeks. It's dogshit.
---
&gt;Just because Jad is very easy to you doesn't mean it's that easy for everyone. The prayer flicking there is literally the entire difficulty of the boss. It's not just "an easily preventable death."
---
It for sure falls under "easily preventable death" regardless of skill level.
---
Another more accurate way to describe it would be "Dying because of own error"
---
&gt;An easily preventable death at caves would be getting melee'd by Ket-Zek.
---
That too falls under planking.
---
We talk plenty but I guess you joined at a bad time then, good luck in your search
---
Delete zeah. And put in work instead of asking for ezscape.
---
"dev time" lol dude they added 1 item spawn. It takes more time to read this comment
---
Nice, that quest was horrible. Glad to be finished with quest cape.
---
Wearing a tank gear (veracs helm and skirt) and better defence (70+) really helps. I still had a lot brews left on the 3rd attempt
---
Was it you who i gave a diamond to?
---
I walked into the ge and saw you talking about finally killing him I think.
---
Yeah, it does. Laziness shouldn't yield any rewards.
---
Yup! That‚Äôs us on the screenshot
---
Yea I think my issue was not enough restores. I went with blessed hide, but maybe I‚Äôll give verac a try. What was your inventory setup?
---
Yup that‚Äôs me :)
---
Oh shut the fuck up. Your  Lincoln park posters slapped all around your moms basement aren‚Äôt high end fashion, spud.
---
Sounds sweet, I'mma try it out! Thanks!
---
I did the quest today after coming back to old school and I made sure to make a second sword. Ill be damned if I ever part with it.
---
I had about 30 sweets, 1 ranging potion, 11 brews and 15 restores. I barely used the  brews in the first 50 waves.
---
Realism is all fine and great until it starts impacting gameplay. And yes, magic isn't real, but the same concept applies.

---

---
nah its alg I have the money I just haven't got around to getting 83 con
---
Who requested the T bow then?
---
A quest cape can't be (t) if you already have 99's? Genuine question not trying to call OP out
---
Reminds me of the time when someone accused me of drop trading stuff from my normal account to my uim that was after they had picked up my shit from the table and decided to re drop it. Tilted me so hard.
---
The requirement for the chest is already Falador hard. Are you saying remove that restriction for F2P, but once you get members put it back?
---
It's a shame that the support team is in such a bad condition. There's a saying that "Every team is as strong as it's weakest player." With the awesome game we have plus the awesome work our jmods do every day for our beautiful community, it's a damn pity to have such a rotten section on our game managment. 
---
$11 btw
---
Truth! He doent get enough credit imo!
---
An actually bad pmod lasts not even weeks before losing the crown.
---
Lol.
---
On a positive note that means we won't have an empty calendar spot two months in a row.
---
Alright, im gonna be the one to say it and take the downvotes. This dude knew he had sensitive information leaked and that his account was recoverable and its jagex fault? Jagex didnt leak the info. Did he try changing his stuff himself like its possible to do?
---
What's if I get 70 defense? Should I ditch the blowpipe and use barrows sets? If so, which ones?
---
they cleared literally every item in his bank too, litearlly 0 items left
---
Most pmods in the game are just selected from a random pool with no infractions on their account that meet invisible criteria (likely playtime hours/week, country/timezone etc.)
---
I have another jad task, I‚Äôll test it.
---
They didn't access the bank, I cleared the rest myself because I don't trust the account anymore
---
I use serp helm, fighters torso, bandos tassets, dragonfire shield, dragon boots, fire cape, barrows gloves and zamorakian hasta.
---
Mostly 2 or 3 kills per trip.
---
I'd rather they added a Saw to the builders shop in Morton before they did this. 
---
At least adding the Saw would let Settled feel better about breaking the rules of his series for one of the two times that he's done it so far. It also makes thematic sense that a builders shop would sell a saw. Otherwise just spawn it on a table inside the house.
---
I'm doing vorkath until 99 range (currently at 93). I'm using dragon hunter crossbow, elite void, anti-dragon shield and d'hide boots. Should I get rigour before or after dragonfire ward and before or after pegasians?
---
I mean yes, we asked for more variety in agility training lmao. Literally no one except settled would use a random spinning wheel in a big swamp
---
Sounds good, I'll try it out
---
Or how about hostile random events like trolls that want their fishies.
---
Looks like we have drama of the month again
---
The top 80% of women are looking for the top 20% of men. You'll often meet uninteresting land whales who genuinely expect a high class educated and rich man to approach them.

Are you Rellekka locked? Asking for content ruins the point if so.
---
The thing is, you can't change that info. It exists forever and that information can be used to recover an account forever. If you know the original password, ISP etc. etc. that information will always be able to recover an account *(unless you get help from JagexSupport so they can clear that information)*
---
Got another one

Doing nothing instead of scorched earth tactics is a pre-emptive step to not fucking it up. How about you stop being an abdolute brainlet and come up with a good solution instead of a bad one? Like imagine using the argument "ur just complaining and not helping" when pointing out a catastrophically bad solution this sub has conjured up
---
Just be rich bro lmaoo
---
What a joke.
---
What information exactly did that ironman leak that caused him to get recovered?
---
And he isn't the only one, here is another player who had his Mod taken away for calling them out:  [https://twitter.com/SmobRS/status/1137675057860362241](https://twitter.com/SmobRS/status/1137675057860362241)
---
just commenting so it gets up the list
---
nah that ehp doesnt take into consideration the literal best methods for everything actually. It's fairly accurate but not exact. construction ehp is 900k but over 1.1m is now possible with gnome benches, runecrafting is 68.5k pre 99, which with runners over 200k is possible, hunter is 240k which 280k+ is possible, etc.  
---
cml TTM is about as accurate as you're gonna get but it's no where near perfectly exact assuming min maxing the best methods.
---
You should definitely do it asap. It's too good to not have.
---
It's time for the JAGEX MODS TO GET A SMACKDOWN.
---
IT IS CASE BY CASE. FOR EXAMPLE AT ARMA ON TASK I REPOT WHENEVER MY RANGED FALLS BELOW 109 BECAUSE I LOSE A MAX HIT. LOOK AT THE DPS CALCULATOR AND YOU CAN GET A GOOD IDEA WHEN IS BEST.
---
True 
---
But seriously this is really depressing, seems like they make these big grand statements of how security is going to change and then keep quiet until someone else with a big profile gets hijacked
---
Uhhh excuse me. The Minecraft servers are back that way. Back to where you belong, Plebian!
---
Until your account gets recovered with 0 support.
---
their passwords arent even case sensitive
---
Guess no one does capes for 2m then
---
You're also exempt if you don't have auth.
---
I somewhat get unmodding someone for saying that. If you don't agree with the team you are on, staying on it wont do either party much good.
---
(Not considering if he was right or not.)
---
Supply and demand. If less Zulrah scales enter the system, then prices will go up which means that Zulrah legit players will earn more gp per hour correct vs now where all the scales and resources prices have basically gone to fucking shit and skilling community is reduced to nothing but people EHPing- which FYI, this is also one of the causes of why this game is absolutely crap to new players who just created an account. There is no reasonable money making method for skilling. It's either you PK or train your stats high enough to go bossing. Absolutely bonkers.
---
Yes, since you are so fixated on this 500/750 as the best and only solution to fixing the BH bot problem, why not apply this requirement to master farmers as well? Or even the Karamja lobster spot. 
---
Like you said, asking legit players to gain 500 total levels is only a mere 5 hours
---
Do you even know what you're talking about?
---
Jagex needs to sell the runescape ip and fuck off alrdy
---
can't believe they'd do you like this, you were great in cast away
---
That sounds like a bug to me
---
This hurt to read. I'm so sorry my dude.
---
So let me say this, yes Jagex support are crappy.
---
But that doesn‚Äôt mean a Pmod, who broke their own rule-set and were warned previously, should come to this subreddit as a surprise. Yet it is.
---
One of negatives of becoming a Pmod, and this is extremely well known for years, is that you aren‚Äôt allowed to publicly voice criticism to Jagex. You are meant to do it through the exclusive internal channels they have access to. Why? Because to Jagex you are a representative of their company.
---
I obviously agree this shouldn‚Äôt be the case, but this course of action was expected.
---
Common sense
---
You can't actually think they give pmod to random no names in the community who play a certain amount of hours. You have to be on their radar whether that be from streaming, being an active community member, hanging out in certain CC's, creating content, anything, but not from just existing or half the game would have pmod.
---
Being able to flick prayers to prevent any drain sounds like a bug to me, yet here we are.
---
What a horrible idea
---
If you want to be taken seriously you should end your sentences with proper puntuaction. ;)

Shut up nerd

Wow, I agree the support did a terrible job there and the guy who lost his stuff deserves compensation, but on the topic of this post (whether that guy should have kept his pmod) I think he could have worded his opinion way better when he sort of represents jagex
---
twisted bow is nothing less than t90

streamers aparantly have notes on their account to have manual reveiw from recoveries and such

I recommend a salve (ei) as it‚Äôll boost your accuracy by 15% I think. Also, since you‚Äôre just trying to get Vorkath‚Äôs head, I recommend rune darts if you‚Äôll use a blowpipe (if you have the extra gp‚Äôs) also, a BGS helps lower its defence if you have one. Good luck!

---
Common sense is stupid
---
Sigh... I get that Jagex wants their Player Moderators to behave in a positive, helpful and supportive manner. But come on Jagex, he posted something **on Twitter** that caused him to lose his Player Mod status?
---
Unless we're missing something here. Saying "you basically showed him the middle finger" might be negative behaviour, but it is in no way shape or form something that I would consider "an aggressive stance" towards anyone.
---
The worst thing is that, apparently, we can't be critical towards Jagex **on other platforms**. Why does one get punished for doing stuff on other platforms? Not only Jagex does this, but other companies as well. It is truly worrisome behaviour. 
---
Even the prior warning seems ridiculous. He used an ingame item, the ring of coins, to "lure" mobile players and posted that on Twitter. What exactly did he wrong here? Use Twitter?   
---
If Jagex doesn't want that kind of stuff, then maybe they shouldn't have released those rings. Rings that can only be used to prank people.
---
On a side note, can we please stop focusing on the authenticator delay? It is not some kind of holy grail that will magically solve all security issues. 
---
It doesn't even solve much if anything. Your account remains vulnerable as your account details are still compromised. All you could do is stop the removal, but they'll just be able to try again, and again... We need more control about our recovery process. Something we can actually change.
---
Who needs a personality when you can have 30 Reddit accounts?

it took me a little 2k gorillas for my third zenyte :D 500 dry is not even bad

Employess that make their company look like shit get fired, it's really fucking simple.

And these aren't even employees, just some internet randos.
---
The internal channels are pointless and ignored. Almost no actual change has occurred because PMods raised it internally - changes are either driven by Jagex management or players.
---
Yes, 3 dragon swords.
---
Yeah there is a difference between jokes in poor taste and legitimate hate speech.
---
Unfortunately those who indulge in the latter pretend to be the former.

Bring a Slayer staff and equip that when you want to cast. Slayer staff allows you to enable autocast of crumble undead

---
Mostly solos, so about 23k (including fucked up raids)
---
And it looks like it was recorded on a phone on a screen haha
---
This is bullshit. Two P mods lost status because they spoke out on the glaring security issues that Jagex refuses to deal with? So instead of actually listening and trying to improve they punish you for trying to give constructive criticism about something that has been a problem for years. Unreal
---
I don't get what the problem is with giving people the OPTION to make a harder password. If you're scared you're going to forget your password, just make an easy password like you can now

It's not that uncommon. I work at a courthouse and people always have the option to leave on their own will when getting fired. If they don't take the deal their usually publicly shamed in the newspaper with all the reasons for the termination. If they do take the deal the only mention of their termination in the newspaper would be "In other news elected official so so left their duty's" It's a win win situation.  The employer doesn't look like the bad guy admitting how they fucked up in voting in this person and the person getting fired doesn't get any bad press about them.
---
You dodge some downvotes by the mod fiasco your lucky this time m8
---
Jagex can as they saw the actual evidence and removed his status over it to not encourage the behavior further. How are you even still arguing it after the pmod obviously was doing something he shouldn't have been. If you do t call that luring idk what you would call it. Enjoy being hateful to a company for no reason.
---
Thats called fashion honey, look it up.
---
I'm out of the loop. What Happened?
---
I genuinely had no idea that PMods weren't allowed to say anything that made Jagex look bad. That's pretty fucking pathetic.
---
Because without the plebs, they have no job?  
---
OSRS will become the next RS3 if the playerbase keeps getting screwed. Matter of time.

Terrible PR play. Surely they knew this would make it to the front page of reddit. REVERSE SMACKDOWN

Its 2019 why not use common sense and realize case sensitivity adds basically nothing to password strength.
---
Comrade Thanks humiliated the State. Comrade Thanks now enemy of the State.
---
Lol I‚Äôm not hateful to jagex at all, if he was removed for luring then that‚Äôs fine if there‚Äôs actual evidence of him really luring.
---
But if he was removed for speaking out on account security that‚Äôs insanity.
---
Jagex has the worst customer support system of all time so I have 0 faith in it, that‚Äôs not being hateful for no reason they‚Äôve certainly earned that loss of faith over years of shit service
---
Like I said, I don‚Äôt support the system. All I‚Äôm saying is this wasn‚Äôt an unexpected outcome.
---
If an employer says you‚Äôll be fired if you say a bad joke while at work, and you were warned, it‚Äôs expected you‚Äôll be fired if you say a bad joke.
---
It can be a terrible practice, but it shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise when this has been the exact case for years. If these players wanted to have a voice they knew not to become a Pmod.

I will use my wallet to protest

I have pool, fairy ring and several portal chambers and I'm gonna set up Quest hall and Achievement Gallary soon. But not quite sure what else I need. Is a portal Nexus that good?
---
Gotta one up ya, 3kc here
---
You can 'resign' or we can 'fire' you. You havnt fucked up enough for us to straight out fire you though...
---
Okay "likely" then.
---
And apparently the OP and all the people commenting but like I said it isn't newsworthy to me.
---
The title implies that the guy was demoted for disagreeing with jagex/critiquing their security methods.
---
This is not the case. He was demoted for being unable to act like someone who is representing the community should act.
---
Pretty sure it was just the dark wizard thing with the coins ring. So not even in the wilderness
---
Unbecoming of a company to promise us security changes 3+ months ago and then smack people who speak out about this same unreliable security
---
what catacombs tasks are pretty viable for bursting? the obvious nechs and dusties, but how are jellies, abyssals, dags, ankou etc? should i bring mage gear for bursting these
---
God damn 99 str with 1 attack must be painful as fuck
---
Mine has none. FeelsLonelyMan.
---
Update the drama calendar
---
That seems like a lot of wasted mod coding time for what will be used on like maybe 2/3 different capes
---
Also the fire capes maybe and other capes I'm not thinking about shouldnt get these options 
---
Overall I give this a 2/10 not very solid idea bro.
---
Was his name ‚ÄòThanks‚Äô? I swear I‚Äôve seen him in GE so many times. Cool dude
---
Or sheep shearer for epic lore reasons
---
cheers!
---
JaGeX should probably hire you then, since they love people who are okay with this.
---
I have a password that‚Äôs been in database leaks, and I‚Äôve been using a case variation of that password because I liked it. This is actually a big deal for me
---
That‚Äôs in the first week of July? It‚Äôs basically a spot guaranteed at this point lol
---
The CC is how they‚Äôre probably storing the passwords-so not very safe.
---
week?
---
Definitely agree.
---
Tbh I think a lot of redditors enjoy these suggestions because they fuck over pures and skillers more than they enjoy the fact that they‚Äôll stop bots.
---
65? Lol not even remotely close, I think you mean smoke devils?
---
Hey guys so I just completed it thanks for the tips. My dumbass was praying magic instead of range.
---
It wastes no mod time you literally adjust the stats from infused cape by +8 as it sits as a different item I imagine.
---
Yeah but there isn‚Äôt an option to infuse fire cape etc, you can literally infuse the cape with the head for literally no benefit
---
DRAMA CALENDAR‚ÄôS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
---
I agree that Jagex's customer service is just about the worst I've ever heard of from any business basically ever, I don't think that the "but he was saying it on twitter" is a solid argument against the guy losing his pmod. If I get caught badmouthing or speaking out against my employer on facebook (or anywhere that isn't work, for that matter,) I can get fired. 
---
Pmod is a volunteer position, why would it be even remotely in their best interest for them to keep someone that they're not even paying, that's meant to be an ambassador of their company and staff that's going around showing them in a bad light? Regardless of whether or not the pmod is being truthful.
---
I would hope special characters includes crabs ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Finally, some good fucking drama
---
Implying this doesnt look litüî• as fuck fam?
---
I‚Äôve moved on to more casual gaming. I‚Äôve also developed other hobbies like weightlifting and board games, so I don‚Äôt think RS has a place in my life anymore.
---
Swamp man good. UPDOTES DA LEFT!!
---
/r/im14andthisisdeep
---
Jagex: Makes an article acknowledging that their support and security systems need a lot of work, and promises to put a lot of effort into reforming them
---
Also Jagex: Bans 2 good PMods (when actual decent PMods are at a premium) for pointing out said shitty systems in action
---
The security sucks. Simone recovers my account a few months back and the only reason nothing was stolen was because of my bank pin. 
---
I had two step and everything but hey were able to just bypass it? I had a message telling me they locked my account because of a unusual log in.
---
Still doesn‚Äôt change the fact they got in without my 2 step üòÇ
---
Here‚Äôs an example of why it matters:
---
I use different case variations of the same password for different sites. The default one I use for things I don‚Äôt care about has been in numerous database leaks, so it‚Äôs not secure at all.
---
It's not justifying jagex, it's common sense that being able remove recovery on an account would be used to lock legit users out of accounts. Find something better to argue about.
---
It‚Äôs all making sense now
---
Totally agreed. Upgrading PoH is a cool idea, but god does it actually feel like a mega clusterfuck right now with so many conveniences at the tip of your fingers.
---
And you don't really do much to *earn* it- you just flush money down the toilet to get the planks.
---
On things like ironman/ uim it's more interesting at least, cause things like the mythical cape mount requires completing one of the grandmaster quests for a great rate/ decent cost.
---
*PERSONALLY* I'd much rather see things akin to STASH units or Burgh de Rott- areas you use construction to fix up, require rare items or long quests to unlock/ create.
---
Summon the crabs
---
well like i said it shows their approach to security in the fact that they havent implemented standard basic measures, and there's also cases like [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/byj30q/p_mod_lost_his_status_due_to_speaking_out_on/eqiltqs/)
---
But it can harm some people. I‚Äôm not against this update, but a lot of people pvp in f2p for the simplicity of it. I can see why some people wouldn‚Äôt want it to become more complex and change their style. Not agreeing with them, just pointing out that there are legitimate concerns by people
---
You dont understand the spaghetti code that is runescape, and it's also not just "adjusting stats" lmao.
---
"Allowed you the freedom to leave the team" that's a real fucking roundabout way to say "you're fired, dipshit":
---
Soviet union all over again.
---
It doesn't mean that. The passwords could be converted either uppercase or lowercase before being hshed.
---
Yeah thatd be a good way to do it. Cool idea.
---
Pretty sure since it sits as a separate item it isn‚Äôt a difficult code as can just take code from assembler....
---
It's because the base cape gives defensive stats and prayer bonus, and collects your arrows. Vorkath head on it adjusts the collection to be the same as assembler thus improving the range cape.
---
One would imagine that in 2019 every password would be case sensitive. 11$ btw.
---
Even as a junior developer I think I could handle the algorhytm to put it in place of password security.
---
I see! Makes sense thx
---
I like how they can give a human reply to this guy because he made them look bad, but people like my friend get banned for accidently backcharging membership is still banned after 6 months and only gets automated replies. I hope runefest is a disaster
---
It's absolutely doable, I did ds2 with 70 range. I had a dragon crossbow but I didn't have salve. We could help you better if we knew why you aren't able to beat it.
---
Lol oh boy, I hope you never work on a large mmo
---
That's how twisted bows start spawning.
---
Insanely rare, but also triggering af calling this B2B.
---
What happened this time?
---
I don‚Äôt know a lot about programming but surely a delay on Authenticator removal wouldn‚Äôt be that hard to implement?
---
At least requirements aren‚Äôt that difficult:
---
Medium

Requirements	
---
40 Mining (boostable)
---
40 Smithing
---
59 Magic
---
40 Crafting
---
The ability to defeat a level 170 demon (can be safespotted)

ü¶Äü¶Äü¶ÄJAGEX IS CORRUPTü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä

I agree with Jagex on this one.  Shoot me

‚Äò we‚Äôve allowed you the freedom ‚Äò is the most bitchy thing I‚Äôve read in a long time
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶ÄBOT FARMS ARE RUN BY JMODSü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
No thats not an argument, thats a point. Or proposition you could call it. I think you need to reconsider your definition of "game integrity" if this falls under "game integrity" then anything is "game integrity". Make all p2p skills f2p and label it "game integrity"
---
Lol I was crafting blood runes with him a few days ago he was chill as fuck.
---
Pmods &gt; Jgaymods
---
Max is so degrading. Shows how pretentious and up their ass jmods truly are.
---
You monster
---
It does but writing a bot that goes around the world and reports other bots is still against the rules, so...
---
If you can get qpc, you can camp Vork. Kills might be a bit slow depending on stats but you should still make good money.
---
Crabs with tridents is even more fitting.
---
I have better things to do with my time than read reddit essays on OSRS. If you can't communicate your thoughts more concisely you will find that people simply ignore you. They have no obligation to do otherwise after all.
---
tl;dr yeah you can talk shit if you do it right... Even if you deserve to be fired
---
Look at the walk outs that Face Punch has been dealing with. And I think Vox had some too.
---
Those are public demonstrations of (how weak the employees are) shit talking your company... But I think face punch bent the knee on whatever the fuck those snowflake devs who did walk out were wanting...
---
Big boy you mad?
---
Now crabs with pitchforks eating watermelon! That'll show them!
---
Interesting, I'm 82 and never had them assigned.
---
damn take my energy. I finished Hydra with pet and all at 630kc.
---
I feel like if 20 people report one person it does. But... who knows?
---
He didn't do any "cussing out" unless he's deleted those tweets, https://twitter.com/ThanksRS/status/1137265125881200641
---
congrats and good luck for galvek!
---
Yeah I mean the bridge at the observatory should we be able to fix with construction. 
---
I get why instances exists for Vorkath and Zulrah but it hides a lot of players making the world seem empty.
---
I have this thing called a job.
---
Yeah, I have everything but the mining and smithing, wont take too long but I am working on a few things at once. 
---
Also questing my def, working on heros quest pre reqs, and some other things rn.
---
Did you mean day?
---
I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúconvert to lower case‚Äù counts as a hash function.
---
I mean, why even take part in the discussion at all then?
---
Spite voting. There really are a lot of people on Reddit that vote no to every PvP update simply for the sake of it.
---
Just a note, if you are trying to do it on task and do the reset method by leaving the caves, your task will be cancelled. Just a heads up if you were looking to utilize the extra DPS with a Slayer helm/black mask.
---
0000
---
&gt; I bet they use a Cesar cipher to hash out passwords...
---
Yeah right bro. They're probably all stored as plain text
---
Can this count for last month's drama since it was relevant then lol?
---
Honestly at this point Jagex should just store all of our passwords as plain text
---
Uc1√∑??22
---
Runescape is no longer written in Java, they use their own engine (hence why they keep saying ‚Äòengine work‚Äô). I believe it is colloquially known as runescript but some dev blogs show fragments of it
---
No, I couldnt give him anything for helping me. So I poured on out for a homie.
---
I wonder if they truncate password length too
---
You know the meme where people hide their account info? Such as name and stats and run energy....
---
Well, it's hardly a meme. Your Reddit account might give away some info as well that you don't even know about. I'm no expert...
---
Why do anything if you've got no one to impress?  Why play runescape and skill if it is all for nothing?
---
Pretty convenient timing on your post. Either a karma farm or a way to get people riled up about jagex.
---
Really should be a top priority thing seeing as it‚Äôd solve most of the account security issues. If someone doesn‚Äôt notice that their authenticator or bank pin has been reset within a week then I guess you can‚Äôt really help them.
---
I got off for the night. I had been cutting wood for about 4 hours. I‚Äôll be on some tonight! Same world!
---
Your mental gymnastics are extremely impressive so that's something
---
I agree with your stance, but I don't think that she's saying that she's more important.
---
Somehow screenshot-by-phone feels very appropriate for this clusterfuck.
---
The true wt experience
---
You are 100% correct in the assessment that jagex gives out enough security features as is. The problem lies with the community. Social engineering for information from streamers who are basically on autopilot when it comes to communication with their stream is an issue players have to look into. I've been on and off rs for over a decade, never been hacked besides my own fuck up, what can you do though people don't want to take responsibility for their own inaction/fuck ups and shift the blame.
---
It‚Äôs a good WC spot! Thanks for commenting!
---
Lol and then you get someone with a some script who just uses f keys anyways also if you think no f keys wont mean you get your ass clapped then you need to git gud
---
Just hopped on and picked some up, thanks!
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Thank you so much! It‚Äôs my favorite place to WC!
---
He or she has 100% seen it before though
---
True that! I can‚Äôt wait to start questing!

Yeah I did know it. https://i.imgur.com/uFwVeuy.png

?????? Herb runs are not close to herb runs for gp/hr?

The wording in this message is like getting fired from a job and they say "you've been promoted to customer"
---
Youve transended into another level my brother... wait for me.... ill be there sooon... (100 years later) almost there!
---
Probably because it‚Äôs just people double logged, I PK revs everyday lol, don‚Äôt really see those accounts. Exilent you can do those things without being a bot.
---
Welcome to far casting.
---
I don't think you understand the definition of QoL if you think adding a PvP spell that blocks the enemy from using their main means of escape is a "quality of life update".
---
That‚Äôs sick dude! And yea I flip back and forth on cutting Magic‚Äôs a few different spots. But this is my favorite for long period cutting!
---
It allows me to have multiple passwords without remembering multiple passwords, and it works for literally every other site because passwords are case sensitive everywhere else. 
---
Seems a bit ridiculous to tell someone their password system is terrible whilst also defending a company with these sorts of security practices
---
What part of "acted in a way that breached guidelines you agreed to so you're getting your pmod status revoked" is so hard for y'all to understand?
---
Yes and it'd be great if maxed accounts didn't immediately vote no on QoL updates because reeee ezscape
---
remove the crown keep the ability for pmods to mute though.
---
Well done sir
---
How‚Äôs it dumb, aside from this very specific edge case?
---
That spot takes me back many a year, I used to play a ton back in the 2005-2008 range and wc was my main skill and that was my main spot to cut em. 
---
Spent 100's if not 1000's of hours there, good times c:
---
Every 16-24 year old player that doesn't know wtf they're talking about complaining*
---
People only care about the crown symbol, not what it does lol.
---
Cool and if they dont die how are they going to learn how the death mechanic works?
---
That‚Äôs so dope! Do you still play now?
---
It‚Äôs honestly just a shit show. I stick around to see what‚Äôll be next
---
This is compete and utter bullshit victim shaming, how come I don't need 2fa on my email for anything else? How come I can secure my email after its hacked but NOT my Runescape account???
---
Email account is free BTW, Runescape membership is not, its simple jagex take your money and dont care what happens after and it's shocking that you or anyone else would defend them, scum.
---
Nice, not so bad in there eh
---
I just started playing osrs about half a year ago now, and honestly it's so amazing relieving my childhood with actual late game to work toward to this time around!
---
of course they have the right to be upset, do you mind elaborating these double standard to me tho?
---
Because my point of view right now it both these pmods complained about the shitty costumer support on twitter and not in the nicest way either, the picture clearly shows that they accepted the terms of not putting jagex in a "bad spotlight", they could have voices their opinion in a way bettter methode then insulting the people in charge of them.
---
Imagine an internet troll trying to insult you because they are mad about the game you help run.
---
Can Jamflex do anything right?
---
In theory it shouldn't be that hard, but it probably has to go through several departments. Which all seem to be busy with who knows what. We all hear that the webteam is too busy to fix the broken poll percentages on the website. 
---
I think that Jagex doesn't want to do it, because there are more negative aspects than positive aspects. From Jagex's perspective only the account owner can disable the authenticator. I've read somewhere that they don't want to force the account owner to wait several days. As they might get impatient and play something else and then forget about it. Costing Jagex money. 
---
A delay also doesn't actually solve anything. It only delays the inevitable. Your account remains vulnerable, as your account details are still compromised. Then it only benefits those who have the authenticator enabled and opted in for the delay. So it would either be ineffective or Jagex needs to do a lot more than only implementing a delay.
---
Didnt upvote for the first time yesterday after being stuck on the airship platform for 2 hours trying to corner trick the monkeys due to bad AUS servers. They did say they check the upvotes and downvotes and try to understand why someone downvoted. Hopefully Aus servers will get better

It‚Äôs good to see the official calender up and running again

That's faux though, guy can literally get something nerfed if he doesn't like it, he's not getting touched lol.

Nukapopo confirmed bootlicker
---
Been playing since the first week of OSRS, the players are definitely social but only in parts of the games that require cooperation. Not that I go looking for friends on the game, but more people are focused on xp gains as am I so i‚Äôll only socialise when it‚Äôs convenient for me.
---
Nothing has happened..?
---
If u don't see these accounts doesn't mean they do not exist.
---
jagex doesn't care about stuff until it impacts their bottom line heavily. They don't care about a small portion of players who lose their accounts or get false banned, it's just the cost of doing business.
---
speaking for Thanks, he was a good p mod.
---
Maybe we should start voting no to all polls, until account security is improved. If everything is shot down, that should free up their schedule to work on this issue instead
---
sounds great. will be dead content in a day though.
---
all I see is a huge ass dungeon with no loot alterations to already easier accessible npcs.
---
as an Iron I would not even waste my time with this.
---
Spider eggs can be gained way more efficiently by creatures in TOL
---
dragons are already easily killed.
---
Why go deep into a dungeon for druids that drop a barely better than chaos druid but worse than abberrant spectre drop table when in fact both of the others are already good enough and 10000x more accessible.
---
You have the right idea here, but you haven't thought the loot through nor the time.
---
Konar is already the absolute WORST slayer experienec in the history of rs (surpassing anything on rs3) and this will make him even worse.
---
Gonna vote no to everything, i admire your work, and dedication but I do not respect that it will offer nothing and that it will in fact be dead content in a day.
---
It's an absurd false equivalence that you have done absolutely nothing to explain or justify. 
---
As I have explained elsewhere in this thread teleblock is a niche spell with a very narrow purpose and all adding it does is make running away in some high level f2p pvp encounters less viable. Therefore it is purely a balance change and game balance is considered an integrity change.
---
According to you this rationale is equally applicable to adding MTX, or replacing every single model in the game with Thurgo. That's completely absurd.
---
yeah like i said at the end this was more of a rough draft than anything. i‚Äôm gonna train this account a lot more and get range and mage void headgear
---
Get out of here Maz. You ain‚Äôt fooling anyone

Why do you have ancestral hat but no anguish/torture? Something‚Äôs not right. . .

His point is that if you do it at 10hp you use less food because the damage scales with hp.

The fact you admit to politicizing the title, and creating a hypothetical situation that reinforced your own views before even looking at the thread, speaks volumes about how pointless a well thought-out response would be.
---
On topic, I'd love more proselyte variants, including black ones!
---
Bots are pickpocketing the living piss out of master farmers atm, so ranarr/snap seeds have fallen a ton. Thus these have been good to farm for profit. More ppl do that - &gt; prices fall as theres a greater influx of supply.

Anyway - https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs

That may be helpful to you.
---
She's back tracking now.
---
Nope, got locked and never was able to get it back.
---
Shut the fuck up, the parent of the thread was clearly being unnecessarily aggressive.
---
They need to stop working on content and focus on security and the bot problem instead. New content doesn't mean shit if our game is gonna continue to be destroyed.
---
But you still don't expect the janitor to do something that isn't their job which is what her tweet is saying.
---
They stole our boneses precious
---
How did his account get recovered? Did they have access to his email?
---
She's on her mighy high horse you may not be able to see the tweets from down here

And the topic was definitely about how maz and other none Web dev teams could do something about account security.

Almost 50% increase. Sorry pal.
---
You're right. But they could give us updates on what they're actively doing. That was like 2 months ago, what's new, what have they accomplished what are they updating, etc etc.
---
So you are pulling things out of your ass.
---
It doesn't actually do anything, just a bit of fun customization
---
Rule #2 of making a HCIM: don't afk while you're playing. 
---
They are assholes everywhere in this game, including at Jagex. HCIM are never safe.
---
maybe this can fix runescape
---
I think it‚Äôs an outage on the whole west coast though. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything we can do but wait.
---
More like pmod status removed for publicly lashing out like teenagers.
---
Looks at Faux's twitter for how to speak out without getting pmod removed
---
Check her Twitter or I guess the deleted tweets of Twitter.
---
Boo fuckin hoo
---
Hey jagex, just graduated from middle school. You guys look like you could use some help with account security? I think I'm qualified to help just DM me thanks smileyface
---
Ah Jagex. Just when you start feeling like they ain't so bad, they crash down like the fucking hindenburg. Love the content devs/artist/etc. on the team, but the heads of jagex allowing shit like this hurts.
---
Your perception of old school's botting problem does not mean there are higher amounts of bots than previously
---
Agreed, though if it's a dev time thing I'd be fine with some basic lore slapped onto it and imagining it's something better.
---
They definitely would have found a reason to quit if that's what they quit over is dying to pve enemies who just hit hard and think they lost the lowest tier equipment in the game. (How could they know its low tier you ask? Because who the hell plays an mmo expecting anything else.) They cant know how death mechanics work if they dont die and yes I know that's when it happened because 100s of people were already doing it.
---
Not exactly. What they‚Äôre referring to is likely a runescape-specific collection of classes, methods, etc. written in Java. Basically just a bunch of scripts and tools they‚Äôve written over the years for whatever they needed it for at the time, which they reuse in their current workflow. In general it‚Äôs good practice to write code in a way that means you‚Äôre not writing the same code over and over again, to speed up development of new content.   
---
You‚Äôre right that they use their own engine. The game engine, which is written in Java. Keep in mind that scripting is not quite the same thing as programming. A script is kind of like a bunch of code that has already been written that‚Äôs available for you to use simply by writing something like *scriptName()*. It just runs whatever code is in the script. This is so that instead of programming men, women, goblins, chickens, and so on completely from scratch, you can just program the core *NPC* entity, and then simply add different kinds of them with different attributes.   
---
If you don‚Äôt believe me, you can see all of the Java JAR files in your cache directory.

Damn dude I wish you luck on getting this little guy in a reasonable time!

Thanks!
---
So do most people who play this game. It is not hard to have a job, a social life, and other responsibilities and still getting 60 agility in 1-2 days
---
Increase mage attack on weapons then add mage defence to protect from magic so having the right prayer up increases the chance to splash.
---
That lowers the RNG of freezes and increases the skill ceiling. 
---
The main problem a lot of people have is the dps of rag range, and jagex doesn't like it since its making dmm finals boring when you get most finalists in veracs, diamond bolts and veng.
---
That orginal tweet is about someone losing their account because support ignored them. Nothing to do with an authenticator.
---
Whomever can post proof of killing this ironmeme will get a bond from me. Well doneüòÇ

Dude was saying what already is public.

He loves the game and he thinks Jagex can do better that is why he is a volunteer.

Then how you know its from dragon slayer?

Typical american free speech is being allowed to criticize the government but never being allowed to criticize your employer.

That's not verifying beyond doubt.

TBH Md5 is a trash hashing algorithm for passwords, but it's not really "trivial" to crack on modern hardware. With any decent cluster though you can...crack a 10 character in a couple of weeks maybe? At that point it's probably better to invest that time and effort into botting lol
---
Seems like fun but idk about the tanner. Just remove that and its all good.
---
Ome this is so funny

This 38 year old clueless kid thinks he can criticize the almighty Jagex?

Thanks? No. He didn't curse anyone out.

As soon as you unlock it. Do nats and double cosmics until then. Both are quick from zanaris and honestly super easy to do when playing on alt.

One of the reasons why I haven't spent real money on this game in almost a decade. No fuckin way I want them having my CC on file, god bless the introduction of bonds.
---
Cb level?? Asking for a friend
---
You‚Äôre seriously defending Jagex‚Äôs actions?
---
Since when do you have to shill for a Company that you volunteer to help?
---
Well we have the June drama for the calendar
---
Blood barrage?
---
You left out like 20 capital A's
---
40-60 at canifis is 230k exp, that‚Äôs about 16 hours =/ for a ‚Äòcasual‚Äô easily a whole week or even two. Grind is grim.
---
Are you sure? Because John Deere make farming machinery eg tractors
---
gz what are you going to do with your newfound 1b
---
Not to play devil's advocate but
---
He had an unpaid position in a company, basically an internship but not even that formal.
---
If an intern was badmouthing the company online, you can be certain their internship would be taken away.
---
The guy who received this demod never cussed out anyone? Smob is the one who cussed people out. https://twitter.com/SmobRS/status/1137282405725872128
---
If you understand the situation, the P-Mod got mad because of a well-respected Ultimate Iron-Man getting hacked on a livestream, attempts to contact jagex support to at least lock his account so he doesn't lose his bills, and basically just got automated responses. (That's the basic jist of it)
---
You have to understand that these issues haven't just popped up out of nowhere, they've gradually built up and Jagex are neglecting that part of osrs. This wouldn't have happened if Jagex sorted out their issues in the first place.
---
Wait he said Jagex has a CS department ü§≠üò≥üò≠üò≠üòÇüòÇ

When I first started playing around with the source code for several existing private servers, I was extremely confused as to why it used equalsIgnoreCase. I figured "the people who wrote this private server were dumb, not only are they saving the actual passwords, they're not even case-sensitive". Then I found out that it was how OG RS behaved too. Fuck me I did not expect that. Especially not these days.

Only after swampy boy gets his crossbow

I got hacked the beginning of this year and lost 200m which was my whole bank. I haven't logged in since then.

I'm more insulted by this repost for karma

You've interfered with our affairs for the last time!

not just irrelevant but completely false. The guy pictured didn't use a single curse word.
---
Has Jamflex ever posted any stats from this button?
---
Would u be willing to sell them?
---
This has to be the most insignificant "drama" I've seen yet. Can't believe people get so passionately offended by  this stuff. 
---
If you work/volunteer for a company or represent them in some way and drag them for their errors (even if you're in the right), they would probably be less inclined to support you and cut ties- it's just how it is. I really could not care less about this.
---
Id like them to visit w1, please. Just for 10 minutes. Oh that's right they don't pay so they don't matter.
---
The guys a tool who cares
---
I think people are kind of surprised just because of the language. If instead of "we've allowed you the freedom to leave in line with the guidelines that we present to all P mods that you agreed to" they had written something like "per the p mod agreement you accepted, if you so choose you are free to voluntarily demod yourself instead being forcibly demodded by a J mod" or something, I doubt people would be so concerned about the wording. But given that the former-p mod knew the context already I'm unsurprised they'd just get to the point as fast as possible.
---
Never afk on hcim....that simple
---
I'm stupid too
---
Idk where these JMods come off getting this attitude with the community when most of them do a shit job anyway.
---
First of all have you ever worked a normal job in your life, because every place I‚Äôve worked the banter is 100x worse than this. And that‚Äôs by the actual employees not community volunteers lol
---
Management is shit, mod team means well but there's a large variance in competency due to the low pay and proprietary code they use so most JMods tend to be pretty incompetent which leads to a lot of drama.
---
Any clans for a f2p lvl 35? 1 def 40 atk 41 str 35 mage
---
Definitely that's the nature of the bond, it's really a brilliant idea. But then again not a cent is coming out of my pocket anymore.
---
I support this guy 100%, situation is shitty and he should not have lost mod.
---
That said, the funniest joke ex-pmods say is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even mad about the crown.‚Äù Bro, you probably didn‚Äôt even log in, considered quitting, and cried yourself to sleep. That crown is a fucking identity to these people and it‚Äôs hilarious.
---
May be lacking a bit of context but it seems like Maz is speaking down somewhat on the Jagex janitorial staff. Seems a bit odd and cruel tbh.
---
Yup agreed, toxic individual
---
We've allowed you the freedom to leave. He couldn't before? ü¶Ä Jamflax uses slaves ü¶Ä
---
Who?
---
&gt;Forcing someone to quit because you still believe in quantity over quality @JagexSupport. He reached out and knew he was compromised. All you did was tell him to be more secure, amazing.  
---
&gt;&gt;Usually don‚Äôt post or care, because most of the time people leave out info why they got hacked. But this guy reached out to you guys, and you basically showed him the middle finger  
---
Show me where in these tweets he's 'acting like an angry child'. Show me where in these tweets he's insulting Jagex? If Jagex is insulted by that, then good, because the truth hurts.
---
How can he look at them if he's blind you dumb fuck smh my head üò§üò§
---
/s
---
How convenient haha
---
Wasnt is so u could write your own custom questions so it wasnt just what is your birthdate isp moms middle name pet name favorite sports team ect... those things are easy to guess for anyone who looks at your social media. Just let people write their own questions thatll stop 99.9% of hijacks.
---
I'm haven't personally tried cracking md5 so I may be mistaken but I was under the impression that it was much faster than that even on consumer level hardware. 
---
Additionally considering many crypto specific gpus are super cheap right now setting up a cracking cluster is pretty economically feasible. 
---
So even if cracking on consumer level hw isn't as fast as I think you can get a much more powerful rig for pretty cheap.
---
Mom was right. RIP Settled's seed stack
---
Thanks m8
---
seems kinda stupid though. If they aren't competent enough to do the basic shit why do people trust them to do other shit. I don't trust Jmods anymore than I trust their security/lack thereof.
---
Yeah I tried searching and can't really find anything concrete sadly.
---
Regardless of what you're talking about, just the fact that jmods are being punished for speaking out for the community is an issue that needs to be addressed.
---
Due to *being needlessly rude to the JMod team
---
Yeah and said pmod said stuff that he shouldn't have. He acted like part of the problem instead of part of the solution like is expected of him. People are acting like when you're taken on to do a role and you act against that you should be some kind of hero and not called out for being a dick. Like if you badmouth your company to your boss when there's an issue how would you expect to be treated?
---
False you don‚Äôt sign up lol, they ‚Äúoffer‚Äù you to work for them with nothing in exchange :)
---
You think he did it for a YouTube video lol?
---
A free week on mobile? Wait... How?
---
Downvote me but if the pmod really wanted to be helpful he could've just worded his post better no? Such as "hey could you look at this?" In this day and age every media account we use is watched so you can't seriously expect to badmouth your "employer" on one account and not have action taken against you on another. Jagex fell into the classic blunder of the Streisand effect but still, this could have been worded much better by both parties.
---
Chaos fanatic if you want a decent shot at a pet.
---
KBD wouldn't be bad either, especially on a black dragon task.
---
Barrows is an option too, though your gp/hr won't be as good without morytania hard diary done.
---
He was a P-Mod because he had dedicated his time to Osrs. If one criticism puts a P-Mod down a crown because it was worded aggressively, over issues that Jagex haven't sorted for this long, then I am completely on the side of the P-Mod.
---
Using an Alt to do it, is defeating the purpose. Why hide away while saying it. P-Mods know these issues, J-Mods know these issues, it's the J-mods who are neglecting the issues, not P-mods.
---
Damn. Nice
---
No it isn't. PMods losing their status for talking shit about Jagex is to be expected.
---
Arguable, since the Pmods job is also to make sure the community is happy. If players are getting accounts hacked while doing everything in their control to stop it, the responsibility falls on the employees/community volunteers to step up and say something since players can‚Äôt get it done obviously.
---
To those curious, I made probably like 10-15m from levels 1-99.
---
Some people genuinely don't care if they have a crown or not. I knew a P-mod a long time ago that would bot and rwt regularly and he was just waiting for the day to get demodded and it only finally happened years later when he started openly talking about how he botted and constantly broke rules.
---
not trying to play devil's advocate here but how exactly do you know you're getting recovered? the amount of account information needed to recover an account goes as far as old passwords, credit cards used, account creation date, etc. How do you manage to have all this info leaked?
---
Isn‚Äôt the economy deflating? Prices are dropping, which means coins have more buying power, which is a great thing.
---
expected comment from the obese monstrosity of a pig maz
---
Yeah no. Written checks require the amount in words for this reason though
---
69
---
Its not necessarily this specific incident, but the spotlight has again been prominently shone on the general lack of account security and customer support. Its pretty egregious that an ironmen lost 1.7 bill despite having all recomended security measures and support didnt do anything despite being contacted before the theft occured
---
I also do the same, and just started doing torstol herb runs to break up the agility grind. I've been amazed how much that has sped up my leveling.
---
Well considering he is an Ironman and selling it is out of question. He‚Äôll have a nice handy-dandy 1b pickaxe! How great!
---
It Genuinely doesn't surprise me, even older posts of genuine accounts that haven't botted once (etc etc) have been made, Jagex staff themselves even admitted that the bot detection they have is flawed, (from how others have been wrongly banned) they need to take their thumbs out their arse, and sort out the issues, not release more content.
---
Jmods arent being punished. And who cares about pmods lmao. Still an issue though
---
So you agree if someone runs next to you while fighting a boss i shouldn‚Äôt get the loot? Im offering the message as a solution to jagex if they dont want to fix their shitty mechanics
---
Having a farming patch for like flowers and some herbs outside your house would be pretty cool actually
---
Lol who wants to be a pmod in 2019
---
Lots of people do wildy slayer with wines as food. Armor type doesn't matter because non melee f2p attacks cap out at 16 damage, they can't freeze for more than 5 seconds, and protection prayers still work.
---
You said "seemingly", I'd focus on that. How else could somebody acquire your password if you have 2fa on everything? Maybe check your pc is clean and just verify the places you enter your password are indeed legitimate.
---
I suppose brute forcing is possible but if your password is 12 characters there are more than 479 million combinations.
---
They probably do
---
Ty for the reply. Sucks that someone that's not part of the support team has to feel like they should respond to show someone is listening.

In anyone's experience, what are some good bosses to bring my noob friend to?

He wants to get into pvm but is kinda timid to do so. He's 85 range, 77 range, 45 prayer, and then really low melee stats ( I think About 55/65/45 att/str/def)
---
I'm not a great pvmer but I do mid to high lvl solo bosses like zulrah and vork. And I have done bandos.
---
I was thinking maybe go to scorpia since his mage level is decent. But I'm worried about going into the wild and us not being able to help each other if a pker shows up because my combat is 110.
---
Any recommendations would be a great help
---
That‚Äôs not a fix it‚Äôs a work around.
---
I really love this idea, but I need to point out one thing: by adding red dragons in there, there is literally no reason to kill them in Brimhaven dungeon, therefore I'd consider adding some other monster, rather than red dragons. (maybe green dragons that are as strong as red ones? :D)

okay

People get burned. Even though u try to help sometimes people just don‚Äôt give a fuck. Sorry dude that‚Äôs terrible.
---
Nah as someone with a pure this would be pretty annoying and also allows maxed people to drop to level 3 for black chins, etc.
---
People took time making specific accounts and that shouldn't be erased for no reason.

Seems you skipped a step or did them backwards. [https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207460475](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207460475)
---
How to fix it? dunno lol, either go through the account recovery process or try contacting JagexSupport on twitter
---
I'm a pmod, part of the first osrs specific batch. I can confirm that I do nothing special like the things you're describing, and the criteria from which they draw people is very general. Good account security/old account age/OSRS focused/no previous infractions and past that it's fairly close to random. There is a trial period for new P mods where they monitor you more closely and your mute is disabled, but the initial selection can absolutely be an "average" player.
---
He broke the iBuyPower matchfixing scandal in CSGO

This is the rng post of the week lol, damn thats lucky. Congratz man.
---
ü¶Äü¶Äa jmod DID reply to this threadü¶Äü¶Ä
---
I agree, but I imagine only a small percentage of players seriously entertain the idea of maxing their account
---
Tbf when this community gets all up in a tizzy like they are atm even the statement "cats are cute" made by a jmod would be interpreted as disrespect.
---
REMOVE GREEN PIXEL
---
&gt;So no, things shouldn't be changed for a YouTube seriers; however, changes to areas with unbalanced, inconsistent, and incomplete content should be considered to make an overall better game.
---
Morytania only offers one of out the five fibres usable on a spinning wheel, which is sinew, obtained by using raw meat on a range.  
---
Could you explain to me how that is inconsistent and requires further content?  
---
&gt;wool, flax, tree roots, yak hair  
---
If you truly wanted to be consistent then you would be arguing to add this content as well.
---
What a fucking meat head lol
---
Rc is kind of a joke after 77. But before 77 it‚Äôs pure cancer

Well I have a lot to say right now. I am mad. But I will make sure to come back tomorrow when you're all back at work.

All I really want to know is how long the middle finger is we're going to get and if we can get some lube. Thanks.
---
Well I had tbow and max gear except ely, I used crystal shield
---
By that token, decrease in price =/= deflation?
---
Look I get what you guys are saying but how does the pmods response help in any way? It doesn't. It literally achieves nothing.
---
You're treating them like a martyr when he could've actively tried to help if he cared that much.
---
Next time remember to toggle private chat to friends only
---
Wake up, open reddit and get blasted with osrs drama.. I love this game!
---
That's exactly what they are.
---
That's still so specific and minor, i don't think its an integrity issue by any means. Integrity issues would be shit like anti botting measurements, adressing broken droptables, OP skilling methods, D spear + ancient mace smiting etc.
---
Didnt see any post on new when I initially posted and figured I might as well keep it up now.
---
Scroll to the bottom
---
Bud. Life tip for the internet: everyones gonna troll you at some point, dont try to fight everyone for everything
---
I'd keep it on the iron for the flex tbh
---
Can you use the crystal saw and cup of tea (gold) to boost from 72-78 in order to mount the kq head for elite desert diary?
---
I doubt its even a matt3r of not having the resources to do it, i'm almost postive its because they'd lose revenue over people getting locked out of their accounts and quitting 
---
For every person who had authenticator removed and cleaned there is probably 50 people who lost their phones and legitimately needed to disable authenticator to play again.
---
I‚Äôm mobile-only as well and I agree that Vorkath was harder
---
I didn‚Äôt know there was an organized protest; I just went and canceled my membership
---
Why does such a fucking joke of a company have to own RS, feel bad for the OS team
---
I wish. I'm fat. But may as well finish whatever's started
---
Oof imagine fucking up a 10+ year old meme format lol
---
They can go for it, they‚Äôre still not getting any more money out of me
---
Who or wtf are u talking about?
---
This isnt about the price of membership ya nut
---
The issue with recovering the account is that if I try to enter the email address I used for the Google account, it directs me to the recovery page for the account on tutorial island. Which is not the account I want back.
---
Because they care about the other players in the community,  and want the game to thrive. Dipshit
---
Ahh shit now hes conveniently "hacked" while carrying the rest of his other expensive items. But dont worry ya boi is going on a vacation, he got a random "bonus" from "work".
---
The pmod who lost his pmod status for exploiting the security bug?
---
Nowhere is this guy even remotely rude about this topic. I've seen a couple comments now saying this guy has done something that I still don't see so whats going on here exactly?
---
You managed the prayer switches while avoiding the watchful eye of the boss? Legend status
---
Fair enough. I'll concede that.
---
But that still doesn't change whether or not PVP tele-block was a good idea. F2P wildy has always been relatively safe, with both major PVE activities (rune ore and greater demons) revolving around increasing your risk in order to increase your reward. You already have teaming, an, albeit short, binding affect, and limited food options in F2P. Adding more in favor of the aggressors devalues the feasibility of this balance and trade off options. 
---
Mind you, this is coming from someone who PVPs. In F2P, you're not just killing them for their gear, but also their inventories as well. If they're risking more loot than food more often, that's worth losing a kill every other time when they reach level 20 wildy. Besides, defenders thinking they actually have chance to get away is why so many of them step into the wildy in the first place. 
---
And then, of all things, to just force upon us this change that is absolutely not integral to this part of the game, has been voted down multiple times, and ultimately is more of a forced meta shift that was shot down for a reason, regardless of poll sandbagging.
---
What security bug? What here was exploited?
---
&gt; how many of you still play and even pay membership?
---
Not me, just canceled mine.
---
Having the same issue. Can‚Äôt open any third party clients or the osrs website. Debating on just canceling membership
---
ya got a permit for that comment.

LMAO
---
Read above it says he lost his pmod status for the security flaws he discovered.
---
try kbd or dks. alternatively you can do mole together if either of you have fally hard but mole isn't even that much of a boss and is kind of boring imo, lol. if he can get his melees and prayer up you guys could give duo bandos a try but don't expect great gp/h.
---
I tried to post something similar to this but admins scrapped it. This is a serious issue.
---
What part of this upsets you? Wouldn't it be nice to see Jagex put in hot water after all the shit they get away with?
---
I‚Äôm with you, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm getting out of this game. 
---
Which I‚Äôm sad about because it really is a great game.
---
Why not our brothers across the pond go protest outside jagex hq?
---
It‚Äôs most likely not the game. The problem for me was my isp and it seems to be everyone else‚Äôs problem also.
---
Yes they do my guy. Getting privileges above and beyond for a multimillion dollar company and accepting those terms means they have certain ways to act. Idk what‚Äôs hard to understand about that.
---
So what you‚Äòre saying is they have to have access to my email account in order to confirm the removal? Because in that case I am safe(er) since I use an icloud mail with 2 factor authentication there too.
---
I agree that it's not Jagex's fault. I would never say otherwise. However if someone has access to both there should still be that extra step of needing to enter the auth code to remove it. After all that makes it so much more secure. And if not at least add a delay.
---
Y
---
To be honest I always try to be civil but I think at this point people have invested too much in their accounts and we‚Äôre beyond the point of civility. Jagex has done nothing to address the issues over the last couple of years and doesn‚Äôt even seem to be caring. People are always talking about adding an authenticator delay. While that would help certain things it still doesn‚Äôt address the completely messed up recovery system. I currently have enough information on my friends account from back in middle school that I could be covered if I wanted to that‚Äôs messed up. I‚Äôm also worried about my main account in RuneScape 3 that people may have access to the information that is the compromised. I wasn‚Äôt the smartest 10 year old at the time. 
---
So yes I do agree with you we should be civil but I also think that JageX should get off their ass and do something about the problem because they clearly don‚Äôt seem like they care. Demodding player moderators that call out a broken system also doesn‚Äôt seem to show that they are caring.
---
&gt;Balancing something is for example to take something that is OP and bringing it to a level that isnt as OP anymore. Ironically that could be nerfing sara strike so it isnt as OP as it once was, so would you agree to that in f2p and label it game integrity?
---
WTF is this word soup? Are you asking me if I think sara strike should be nerfed? Or if a nerfed version should be added to f2p?
---
&gt;Teleblock has not been a thing for 19 years in f2p
---
It was added to f2p in pre-EOC rs2. Of course you can argue that rs2 is a different game from osrs but in that case you can't claim that f2p has existed without teleblock for 19 years considering that there was a considerable chunk of time between when teleblock was made f2p in rs2 and when osrs was launched, and then an additional gap during which f2p didn't exist in osrs.
---
&gt;so it can never be seen as a question of balancing lol.
---
This is advanced stupid. Every balance change involves altering existing content, I went to great lengths to explain to you how teleblock is a very narrowly applicable spell that already exists in members and has no impact outside of the balance of pvp combat. However you simply deliberately misunderstood everything I said and continue to fall back on making absurd false equivalences between allowing f2p to use teleblock and allowing f2p to use an entire extra tier of combat spells.
---
I've seen several threads for spectrum users having this same problem, so yes, they are.
---
Poor choice of words, I mean just fly through it
---
Maz‚Äôs Twitter is a shit show right now, and rightfully so. She is actually being very elitist about her position and belittling a lower income worker. What a fucking joke of a JMod.
---
This is dumb and immature.
---
If you cant undertand basic english then I just feel bad for you. And yes I meant pre eoc.
---
Finger paint?
---
I could see someone not from that depatment not being allowed to say anything. Sadly a department doesn't really exist for player support...So ya, I guess it makes sense why none of em talk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
Lol what?They don't employ him, he doesn't get paid by Jagex. Why the fuck are you people acting as if this Pmod is working for them?
---
Should be: people that don't use GPU plugin for Runelite at ZMI to click pretty much next to the altar from the bank.
---
The bots are from the twitch prime promotion it'll be back to normal once it ends in like a weekish
---
No, they don't my guy. They are not a paid employee. Stifling criticism is a poor excuse for shitty decisions.
---
I see a random pod giving more shits about players than actual people who have legit support (paid) positions.
---
Fuck off. Your approach on this is wrong.
---
What‚Äôs going to happen to your account if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
---
"unmodly" is just a super broad term that you guys can use to silence anyone who is saying things you don't like. Broad language in guidelines, laws, ToS are always there just so the creator of the rules can give the boot to anyone they don't like.
---
&gt;A bunch of people who don't have the coding experience to fix a problem are mad that the people who do haven't figured out the solution yet.
---
It requires absolutely zero programming experience to realise the benefits of adding an authenticator removal delay. It really wouldn't be hard at all, and even if it was, it's absolutely worth the resources.
---
This is not a job, your argument is invalid. From a non-20 year old who manages people irl.
---
Typical PR bullshit that's all talk with no action. Seen it a million times.
---
That selfie though...
---
&gt; You're a representative for a multi-million dollar company.
---
Sure, and nobody would have known or cared about this pmod's words had he not been demodded.
---
Ironically from a PR standpoint, the action of demodding him for his words might do more damage than if they had simply done nothing. 
---
It's like the streisand effect.
---
It's the twitch prime promotion
---
If you were to give someone an honorary title in real life (say you‚Äôre their boss or something) then they go and use that same language as the pMod, wouldn‚Äôt you want to fire them?
---
There's a twitch prime promotion rn that gives our free membership
---
Bot makers can now do stuff like this with free membership.
---
being poor isn't the same as being stupid, you leave my shitty laptop alone!
---
How is saying that jagex basically gave someone the middle finger even a bad thing to say? I say fuck every 10 words lol. Jagex is salty because he said it on an open forum for other pmods to see and most likely agree with.
---
You obviously have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. Accountability is never on the player, its always someone else‚Äôs fault.
---
They don‚Äôt have to. Jagex is choosing to limit their speech and leveraging them by saying they‚Äôll take away the crown (which, regardless what the player says, we all know people care about that crown). Jagex can change their stance on this and let the p mods voice opinions against the company. It‚Äôs up to them, and for optics reasons I think it might be a wise direction to move in. Or scrap the p mod program altogether since it‚Äôs only a status symbol anyway. If they had actual power like ability to temp ban bots and stuff they might serve some meaningful purpose, but as of right now there aren‚Äôt enough to even deal with trade bots at the GE, so I‚Äôm unsure what purpose they really serve.
---
How is it a huge issue if it has been working for the last 6 years? Also what major bugs?
---
Ah, the Cape of Condiments
---
They're using the free twit h prime promotion rn to get membership
---
They get banned and recreated in 5 secs. It'll be gone once the promotion ends
---
Same here
---
Mod Steve,
---
I had a personal exchange with you early this month to have my account disabled and you handled my request with professionalism. Thank you.
---
The mod involved with this exchange was clearly being passive aggressive and I dont think they exhibit the behaviour you highlighted in your comment, despite being placed in a much higher caliber than a player moderator.
---
Considering the semi-recent findings of wrong doings by certain mods, what training or certifications does your staff go through to ensure professionalism with us, your clients? I'm assuming you cant go into much detail for security purposes, but surely there is some training involved? Or are they just observed when they are hired and have their own discretion to talk to us how they feel?
---
I cannot connect either. I called Charter and they told me they are having issues.
---
Lol like anyone's going to believe you at all anymore.
---
Why would I do that when I want to kill the real vorkath?
---
A service
---
They have a right to revoke said service at any time
---
It's the same shit with you buying digital games. You Technically don't own shit
---
He didnt sign any kind of contract that says he cant give his opinion on Twitter lol. Pmod guidelines are only in game obviously.
---
I‚Äôm currently at 84 rc, all I want is 86 for Karamja Elite then I can forget about the skill for years. Those last two levels are so close yet so far.
---
Other websites are having the same issues through charter. Woodgrain.com federation.usbank.com 
---
And others
---
Your PR team fucking stinks
---
I mean I guess we'll see, bit it isnt the only thing being interrupted on spectrum lol. My guess is it'll be resolved tomorrow when people who actually give a shit are in the office.
---
No of course not, it was an analogy of an organsiation and a volunteer relationship.
---
Are you serious? It's not a job sure, but as a p-mod you are representing part of the game and it's administration hence the "guidelines that they agree to" ...
---
My favourite item in game, congratulations dude
---
That's funny because I play on an account that cannot trade!
---
A better analogy would be:
---
I lost my house keys and someone tried to break in. When I contacted my landlord about changing the locks so only I could enter, the landlord refused and just told me 'Lol, just secure your house better." Even though they control the buildings security. Now the thieves walked right in the front door and took my stuff.
---
If by a little means there are now websites made to sell prime accs then yeah sure it only jumps a little. SMH at the ignorance
---
well it would probably effect more then just the economy. I hate to say it but I would imagine most of the money jagex makes is from bots.
---
LOL If your OSRS bank account is worth more than your IRL bank account you‚Äôre the true definition of spending too much time on the game.
---
It‚Äôs possible I didn‚Äôt attribute the quote because it escapes me who it belongs to
---
wow i just found out that passwords arent case sensitive wtf
---
Just buy a bunch of sentry guns and attach them to the ceilings of your house so you can kill the person breaking i- oh wait those aren't avaliable
---
Just use void
---
I'm 90% sure people would applaud.
---
Sorry to hear about your dog man, that is really rough. I didn't see your post, but don't worry about it. This sub is mostly a shit posting and shit talking sub, so I am sure it from t right in.
---
So Jagex shouldnt let people secure their accounts? Just trying to get on the same page here
---
The report button won‚Äôt allow you to report someone that hasn‚Äôt spoken or traded with you recently. Which is dumb as all hell, because of course bots aren‚Äôt going to talk.
---
Sick content brotha
---
It‚Äôs bad I know
---
right dude? holy shit

Fucking weasel words, put up or shut up.
---
Who committed genocide?

how much xp a hour doing the laws

Yes I've read that elsewhere since posting, idk it just felt like a huge difference in pph since last time I did nmz, when I also didn't have DT bosses. Maybe my rng took a nosedive idk. Guess I'm off to do Temple of Ikov....
---
im am so impressed that you havent managed to fuck up the 1 def by accident with how high your other stats are, props dude.

Yeah I don‚Äôt follow what exactly was vulgar or inappropriate here.

You are right about the account security sentiment, the next blog addresses in this far more detail than I could offer in a quick comment here though.
---
and they killed it
---
No, it's not. Stop getting offended so easily.
---
Thanks! I appreciate that and I‚Äôm looking forward to it.
---
Too late to reach out. That said player cleared his account because Jmod ignored his call for help. If only he waited until a top voted reddit post to act.
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä Jagex won‚Äôt reply to this threadü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Do you lower corp‚Äôs stats on your main?
---
It's not that. it's that he was warned before about how he says it. You wouldn't flick off your boss and then act surprised when he writes you up would you? Especially if your boss already had warned you before about doing it? He thought he could get away with it again and now is trying to come to Reddit to start a crusade when they finally said enough.
---
Sweet dude looking forward to the video
---
You're so out-of-touch it's unbelievable.
---
For real...
---
Right? No kidding.
---
&gt; The guy is volunteering for an organization,
---
If you actually wanna get technical, he didn't volunteer for shit lol. Pmod is completely chosen at random, he didn't ask or sign up to be a mod but he became one anyway. Maybe he could've denied it?Who knows. But Jagex is far FAR less professional than some unpaid NON employee saying that they were getting the middle finger. Obviously I understand that because hes a mod he should hold a higher standard over a normal player but in reality he is nothing more than a glorified player himself.
---
this message paid for by pls let me be a pmod jagex
---
There must be a serious flaw (low-level) upon which the game is built that they just can't tell anyone about. Because they'd be done for if it was revealed. With them continually rejecting change in security, it's clear something is seriously wrong.
---
I don't want to sound jaded, but man, that's actually what happens when you get your house broken into in real life.
---
Look for WLOP on instagram
---
This comment alone was enough to have me lose 100% of my faith in all the mod teams.
---
He's a she.
---
purespam has said this for a WHILE. they dont want to do it cus itll make people annoyed when they lose their phone or remove auth for account sharing and that they have to wait for the delay, meaning losing members and money.
---
The tools to properly secure your account are already available for players to use. If they choose not to use them, that is their prerogative. Why should I be ok with significant changes being made just because a couple of absolute retards refused to secure their account?
---
"You've been promoted to customer"
---
Holy fuck.
---
My bad
---
11 dollars
---
Its just a bug, got that message on mobile and when I retried it worked.
---
Cmon man. You really think a company wants to have their own employees talking badly about them? What you describe would get you fired from almost any job. What makes you think jagex should be different. That's really unfair. They aren't limiting their speech either. The pmod spoke out on Twitter and was punished accordingly. He can say whatever he wants but that doesnt mean jagex has to put up with it... I think so many people are immature in here and dont really realize jagex has a business to run.
---
It was on stream. There isnt any remote excuse for jagex to have dropped the ball. And it's sad that that is the only option for defending an account right?
---
Congrats! Did you just feel empty once this happened?
---
nice
---
Grats on maxing dude. Just hit 2200 total myself so getting closer.
---
its just Maz, so braindead people had to explain to her like she was 5 what passive xp from birdhouses was
---
You have the right to remain silent
---
Not sure if you're trolling or have no clue how protection prayers work, nor what dragon breath is, for that matter...
---
""JaGeX should probably hire you then, since they love people who are okay with this.""
---
Exactly. LoL. Maybe over of those RS Developer backed bots. lol.
---
"Why should I be ok" You speak like this is detrimental to your experience as a player lmao. Toxic af
---
So.. you're either young or dumb, or both? Making money on this game is not hard, hence why people actually do it for a living. Is it good money?No but its money. In game you don't have bills to pay, its easy to have a bank account in game worth way more than your real life one.
---
Significant changes? Describe to me what's significant about my suggestion.
---
Somebody has to give jagex the money for any single bond.  In turn, the supply of bonds in there for the bots to buy for in game GP.  Jagex is getting paid, but not necessarily from the bots themselves.  (Reply to your first comment).  You could indeed keep making accounts and doing the free trial, but you would be botting the minimal money making methods.  Odds are they are paying for further membership in some form or another.
---
that doesnt matter.
---
We do not need another blog. 
---
Action is not a blog. Are there changes or not?
---
It's not a hard thing to answer.
---
Just a joke, he‚Äôs a character from Game of Thrones who sometimes comes up with quotes himself, and phrases them such as: ‚Äúa wise man once said...‚Äù while referring to himself
---
The fact that you call that an "attack" is ridiculous. Sharing the news of a lost account and explaining why it was lost is not an attack, it's news. We need an overhauled recovery system, thanks for letting the not so big creators get hacked!
---
Capital letters still don't matter in your password. This reduces the amount of charecter sets you're able to use in your password, and makes it a lot easier to break.
---
They haven't fixed this basic issue, so I wouldn't expect them to do anything about any of the issues around 2-factor or multi-factor authentication on their platform.
---
Not nice
---
Was he a friend of yours aswell
---
You said "who makes bots spam errors in chat"
---
It's bot farmers having fun since you can make unlimited accounts with membership.
---
They don't actually make bots error code like this. It's a joke
---
Really? Inbox downvote because I replied to you? Wtf man... You commented and I replied??
---
Faux is a puppet, a sheep
---
You can go quite far above 10hp and still take the least amount of damage, [here's a google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSjTo7tS3G5HK8FVyKR3JG5I-Av-fvj33EGZ2zvIup4/edit#gid=0) that has the calculator and also a link to the tweet for the source of the information from Mod Ed if you'd prefer to run the calculations yourself.
---
Basically, damage calculation takes into account your FM level, how many warm pieces you're wearing (I assume you have 4), and how many Braziers are lit - and to get the minimum damage dealt, you only need 3 braziers lit not 4. 
---
I personally ran WT from level 85 at 27HP. The normal attack still only hit 1, but the area attack hit 5 and brazier breaking hit 3 where as you can get that down to 3 and 2 respectively - however this was assuming 3+ braziers lit, so you might want to run the calculation assuming none are lit just to be safe - although it is unlikely that there will be less than 3 lit on official worlds. Play around with the numbers, see what you feel comfortable with. Main point is that 10HP WT is not necessary to take full advantage of the low damage.
---
No... they aren't the professionals, they don't know how the engine works. And dependencies are exactly the problem dude lol, they need to gut the game and have it all jarred in one executable or take up modern file layout. 
---
RSC to OSRS took so long because they were literally remaking the game. Idk about how much java application management you've done but it really won't be that hard to remake the client lol...
---
The max cash bug wasn't caused by them gutting anything, it was caused by them trying to manipulate spaghetti code (THE PROBLEM). You furthered my point with that statement.
---
They'd have to debug everything. 
---
&gt; uh, yeah? They should be debugging everything with updates they release now but cant do so effectively because of again, spaghetti code. Please, stop supporting Jagex's bad decisions. And as for money: stop hiring community associates who are female just because you want a woman on stream! Simple really.
---
Have a good day.
---
Not only that but google has multifactor identification stuff, for my google account i can only log in if I press something on my phone thats also on the screen im logging in with.
---
F  ^(uck jarmblarcks)
---
The only acceptable ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù is disciplining the employee who demodded the player, apologizing to the player, and offering their pmod-status back‚Äîno strings attached.
---
If a volunteer player, who is frankly just volunteering to do things Jagex is too cheap to pay someone to do, has to walk on eggshells when voicing their opinion, something is seriously wrong with how Jagex treats their volunteers.
---
&gt; that means that he has to adhere to the rules pmods operate under. PMods are held to an extremely high standard, it makes sense to demote him if he‚Äôs being childish and unprofessional. All he had to do was voice his opinion differently and he would have been fine.
---
I understand, and maybe if he did voice his opinion different he would be fine BUT the reason he worded his opinion the way he did is because hes frustrated watching the same thing happen to the community and the people he cares about with no solution in sight. Sometimes it takes a person to speak up for things to actually change.
---
Now think about this, what if he worded it all differently, left out the whole middle finger part but instead of this blowing up, it just gets swept under the rug or left with some basic ass response. No matter what it was a lose lose for him, the best he could hope for is him speaking his mind that something actually happens. Will it?I doubt it with Jagex's track record but I can only hope.
---
Plus it's the weekend.
---
To add to this with some suggestions - 
---
Get a dscim or whip, and ddef
---
Imbue the slayer helm if you plan on ever hanging/maging slayer tasks
---
Get bgloves.
---
Get a b ring or at least a warrior ring.
---
FM cape isn't terrible, fire cape would be better though.
---
Get that fury.
---
You are absolutely right, there will always be idiots. And regardless of what account securities measures Jagex implements, the idiots will still find a way to get hacked. As it turns out, all the tools to properly secure  your account are already available for users.
---
does addresses means just talk about it with empty words or actualy stuff to change like auth remove delay?
---
5 mil every week? A bond is like 3.5-4 mil and lasts 14 days so idk what you mean.
---
West is suspect, east is racist, we don‚Äôt talk about the others
---

And
---
+2 range str
---
 so maybe that's the badger to tip the scales
---
Yup. The firemaking cape isn't exactly a bad cape, it's just one of the nooby skill capes, like cooking and fletching.
---
Meant to be tongue in cheek sarcasm since the guy I'm responding to is an obvious bootlicker. Guess I should have put the /s on it
---
And you think it would be on the top of subreddit? You really think a blog would be about to be released? 
---
No.
---
Yes. I've been excited about it since it was announced. Might take a while, but they aren't going to do NOTHING, right? ... Right Jagex?
---
Jagexpleasedothethings
---
Name looks legit.
---
Very interesting! The 3rd Age Pickaxe being a Master Clue unique (and not ordinarily obtained through Elite clues) makes this very peculiar.
---
So the mimic has some other reward mechanic that they haven't explained. I wonder if it gives you extra reward rolls specifically on the Master Third-Age table.
---
A lot of botters don't stop their rule-breaking at botting. Some will use skimmed credit card details or other methods to spoof Jagex since they know that the account will be banned eventually anyways (either for fraud or botting).
---
Of course they're not doing it wrong but don't complain about xp rates then. Seers is better marks than canifis anyway
---
i personally believe that jagex doesnt want to put time into increasing account security and keeping veteran players playing and instead are focusing on getting more new players to play, which is wrong.
---
archers is 6m now?
---
1/35 chance of getting a mimic chest from elites. 1/15 chance from masters. It's a new mid level boss and gives extra loot I guess.
---
Your point is the game isnt complex and it wont take them long tonrewrite the engine.
---
&gt; you've done but it really won't be that hard to remake the client lol...
---
The client has nothing to do with it its the engine. 
---
&gt; RSC to OSRS took so long because they were literally remaking the game.
---
This is what would have to happen to port the game to a new engine
---
The previous warning was about luring new players to the dark wizards during the mobile release using a ring of coins. It had absolutely nothing to do with this incident or how previous tweets were phrased.
---
I don't think he's representing them, that's my whole point.
---
It's not comparable in anyway lmfao it's just a silver crown and jagex support team is definitely not their "boss"
---
Gz u can do math
---
That makes sense
---
??? You were talking specifically about the quest vorkath. How am I supposed to know you're gonna do big vork on mobile?
---
Bye bye karma lol
---
He wasn't silenced but he was demodded for breaking the mod tos. What is wrong with that be broke the rules and got punished. Tbh I am really excited about this situation because it seems to be weeding out a lot of the idiots from the community unfortunately I am sure you will be back in under a week
---
Buy a bond, surely you work enough to afford a bond? It's like 30 mins of work a standard job
---
Congrats, I didn't realise getting a champion scroll was now a diary requirement.
---
I've changed mine to every color, mixed and matched with tons of wasted Mark's but at the end I realized nothing satisfied me. I find now that the original graceful looks 100% better, the rest just makes you look like a power ranger when I want to blend in.
---
reasonable, and i wish osrs had its own forums etc instead of a sub section in the disgusting rs3 forums.
---
I‚Äôm talkin around the time I got the dwh drop :)
---
I don‚Äôt remember what the price was then, but all I remember was as a noob it felt like a lot.
---
But you‚Äôre probably right. Even back then 5mil is an over-estimate. Though I think mobile was around the corner so the price was steadily rising
---
Love a good edging.

You can't attack kalphites in the east cave if you aren't on task.

My account still showed an authenticator for my account, was still hacked, and they said it was removed in 2016, even though I still had it showing before my log in screen. Always a reason why it‚Äôs the players fault even with everything you are supposed to do.
---
I know most don‚Äôt care, buts it‚Äôs important to me, I liked the old model more :(
---
Lol shut up dude, jagex has the right to revoke the privilege from whoever they want
---
Congrats man! Love to see these type of accomplishmentsü§ôüèº
---
He had guidelines to follow and wasn't mature at all. P mods are supposed to be ambassadors of the community, not some whiny ass.
---
They already give him 10x the drop rate of anything already lol.. (all seriousness, he can't be THAT lucky with all the drops)
---
Jagex owns half the bots themselves for a side profit from gold selling.
---
Your incel is showing
---
I only asked cause you said you wanted to believe they weren't as bad as everyone is making them out to be but you've seen how they've been since that time. I started playing in late '05 so I've pretty much experienced every controversial thing they've done minus a few years like yourself and honestly I see the same damn company just with different employees.
---
They were granted a 3rd life and they're still ignoring the community and just all around making the same terrible decisions they did back then.
---
5.3m
---
This is a way worse conspiracy theory than mine that Jagex runs the gold sites. People like Mod Jed were just the ones that got caught. Also gold buyers almost never get banned but rogue sellers (aka non-Jagex affiliated sellers) always get banned. Funny right?
---
When did he break the rules?
---
Anyone know why on pc I don‚Äôt have the world switching option? Just getting back into the game but it used to be the door icon. I don‚Äôt see it anywhere.
---
Congrats! I did it last week, but took me 4 tries :(
---
correct. generally speaking, your account is as secure as your email for it is.
---
R/crappydesign
---
No, I died to jad in my pure.
---
Never gonna happen
---
Dude, losing anything less than 20m, no matter where you are in your account, is recoverable. Don't sweat it. Just change your password and make sure you have double authenticator and a pin, then rebuild. You'll make wayyyy more in the long run. I lost 22m once by being a retard and forgetting to set my quick prayers when abyss runecrafting with an eternal glory. You'll be fine.
---
Been and gone and the answer was no.
---
It would take the artists months if not years to re-do all the art for the game into HD models
---
People only care an iota that someone lost pmod status because of the seeming care to do something about that, whilst ignoring an actual problem. 
---
You don't need to sit here wasting your time defending their decision. No one will care by tomorrow. When you get recovered you'll care about the actual issue he raised.
---
the real LPT is always in the comments
---
its 3 hours from kitten to cat, then again 3 for overgrown, but atleast you can ignore it
---
You're to skinny for it.

this is for easy diaries

There currently no delay to removing it. If someone had access to your email, they can simply remove it and have no issue accessing your account.
---
report bug in game

Subtle. I like it.

Literally doesn't even know what he's talking about lol
---
That's no pool. That's a drinking fountain.
---
So what I'm hearing you say is you are too stupid to know how to turn on 2fa on your email or look it up. Got it.
---
Thanks homie. Yeah, I know it isn't much that I lost. I'd quit if I lost that much üòÇ props to you for sticking with it. I changed my password right away, I have an authenticator set and I'm bout to set a bank pin.
---
He used checks as one example. There are plenty of other cases where changing the value could happen
---
No one said it was.
---
It‚Äôs only a door while you‚Äôre logged in. If you‚Äôre logged out it‚Äôs a grey rectangle in the bottom left.

No

&gt;especially the company you work for

These people are volunteers. They don‚Äôt work for Jagex because they aren‚Äôt paid.
---
Id say just do slayer but i take the slower route to not use supplies if at all possible and you need to be high enough to get good tasks. Guess you could kill drags for starting cash? Awork your way up the chain. It happens a lot of people. When a friend fucked me over i just said screw it finished dumping my bank expect for some items to start fresh (this was back around dungeoneering, yes rs3 but im bored of that shit lol) i started out leveling dungeering to 80+ finally and got a set of chaotic weapons went to barrows for armour and money then frost dragons to get enough to upgrade to bandos and just kept killing,better stuff and,eventually made 1b for 3rd age melee (before it tanked in price rip me)
---
(My experience with losing bank ^)
---
Just start some where low and upgrade your gear slowly :D find some skilling method to help get decent combat gear
---
I still call it that üòÇ
---
Why camelot
---
a Barankwam
---
Who does dragon slayer 2 without intention to kill vorkath? What?
---
So having an Authenticator is not safe enough?
---
Yeah and show me the lolis mate
---
Well, that was just example. Usually it's easy to use radical examples so everybody gets point. Let's do it other way then, why  I would Want painting on my wall which says that I show middle finger to my customers
---
Not a loli tho
---
This entire interaction has just been one sided with no substantial arguments from your side. Possibly a troll but honestly can't tell since you appear to have the conversational skills of a middle schooler. I realized this when you wished harm to the alt account showing basic lack of empathy often developed in late teen years and wrote the last reply so if anyone with actual reasoning skills wanted to discuss it they could. You predictively resorted to an attack against the spelling instead of the argument since you couldn't contrive any actual reasoning. So again i will just end with its sad.
---
If kieren, ash, and ed leave, I will genuinely fear for the game's future.
---
You're the first person I've talked to who exclusively plays mobile. Sorry for not reading your fucking mind I guess

Can someone explain what the red squares mean when I put down a cannon?

Jagex is a pretty trashy company. I lost one account of 10 years due to a bullshit macroing charge when I've genuinely never macroed. I create a new account, grind for a few weeks and boom, same shit. Asked for an explanation both times and I was told their word is final and they don't have to show me any proof because whatever detection system they use is supposedly 1000% infallible. I wrote them off completely (after telling them to kiss my ass). I was a long time customer. I didn't deserve that. At least people are beginning to recognize how flawed jagex is.
---
Lol @ the comments
---
‚ÄúLook at all these bots‚Äù
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not THOSE kind of bots, it‚Äôs THIS kind of bot‚Äù
---
Ok. Thanks for the input. The point is botting is easy and goes unchecked.
---
I've posted this on a bunch of posts like this. They've said it would require too much engine work to be a feasible possibility. This would be a pretty big overhaul and a HUGE time investment. Not only do you have the programming aspect to deal with - loading different shaders, renderers, potential problems with unsupported textures, differences in model types, AND being able to swap these things on the fly, you have the art side. Even if they have some compatible models with animations in tact, they would have to create a new model and new texture set for nearly every object in the game. Worst case scenario, they could be doing that for years due to needing to juggle other prioritized new content with this as a back burner. They just don't have the team needed to do this kind of thing. This may also require engine optimization due to having to have multiple models and textures loaded and in memory at run time. I mean, they could just require you to log out to switch over and have it load and dump unnecessary stuff while you log in, but even that would probably be whined about.
---
And when you imagine that not even the entire fan base wants this change, it seems like so much extraneous work. If we were generous and said this could pass a poll (75% support) that's still 1/4 of the fan base that wouldn't even use it. I still think at best it's around a 50/50 split, which means it wouldn't even pass a poll to begin with. That's a huge amount of effort and work for a feature that might go unused or underappreciated. And I say this as someone who wouldn't mind it at all and would probably use it.
---
No it is still safe and you want one. The controversy is around how there is no delay in removing it.
---
personally i wouldn't try slayer til about base 75 combat stats, but its up to you
---
use the highest level slayer master available to you. at your stats i think that might be konar (requires cmb 75) or nieve (requires cmb 85). alternatively if you're looking for points i very *very* highly suggest doing wildy slayer. 
---
outside of wildy slayer, between those two it's up to you, and you can definitely just do konar instead of nieve and duradel when you unlock them, but tbh it's not recommended.
---
konar tasks are pretty mindless and brimstone keys give you *okay* profit on top of whatever you kill, but the location requirements can be annoying.
---
if you have neither unlocked, mazchna is a good alternative mostly because his tasks are often nearby or easy to get to
---
My maxed main was recovered 3 days ago and I lost swell over 600 ml and I am full honestly done with RuneScape from now on I'm not doing it again to get their s*** together Jagex needs to fix their shit.
---
This is not an employee who receives a wage, j mods are there because they represent an interest in providing integrity to the game. He spoke up on something with the intention to draw attention to something that he believed is a serious problem for the well-being of this game and it‚Äôs community and he was absolutely right to do so. My loyalties are to people like who him who generally care about the game and it‚Äôs users, not to people who prioritize adhering to social protocols of the real world work force and would not say anything about a glaringly obvious problem that they have the ethical obligation to draw attention to
---
At a large corporation sure, but at Jagex QA people do all sorts of shit. Even creating new game content.
---
Was the other guy trying to crash you at ankous?
---
Literally the only reason for those items to exist is to skull trick people.
---
I don't remember them working like that
---
I'll go first: when you search grand echange in the GE
---
3 was toxicity in game, formatting ruined it, will edit.
---
Maz's Twitter is being harassed by people who can't tell the difference between an Orange and an Apple.
---
It seems you and several others can't tell the difference between an Orange and an Apple either. She's not discussing income, just skill-set of the jobs. A Janitor, who isn't trained for a certain job unrelated to their field, isn't going to do the job unrelated to their field. The income of a janitor wasn't even brought up, yet you, brought it up to try and belittle someone.
---
Also, how are 8 tweets clarifying the company's structure a shit show?
---
I don‚Äôt understand how you think being a volunteer is the same as working for someone. It‚Äôs not.
---
Cool thanks, dreading the runecrafting grind to be honest haha
---
It was 2 videos
---
3 was updating us on when it happens :)
---
About 20 years mate
---
They don't know this email. They requested a password change for my username - this email being a totally different one not used for much has been untouched. 
---
2fa is set up on everything now with new passwords and a scan was done.
---
But I'm still being told too many log in attempts. I'm able to get in after a few mins of trying and my account clearly hasn't been touched ?
---
I think people need to learn not to harass others on Twitter, especially about problems they have no control over. It's almost the equivalent of the player-base complaining to B0aty over the topic and telling him to fix it. Telling B0aty won't do a thing because that's not his job.
---
Just like how Support isn't Maz's or Roq's jobs.
---
If you die as a HC you're a failed hc but if you die as a normal ironman nothing changes
---
Wrong subreddit bro
---
Saying 'you gave somebody the middle finger' is different than saying 'fuck you.' Thats not an opinion. 
---
In other words, you're equating 'you basically told that guy to fuck himself' to 'fuck you.' Two completely different meanings
---
‚ÄúI DONT CARE, I LOVE IT!‚Äù
---
- everybody in their mind right now after reading it
---
How important is it to have a bank PIN? I have 2FA set up on both my RS account and my email. I don't really interact with anyone ingame, and don't post my account name online. My account isn't that valuable‚Äîonly about 5m bank and sub-1200 total.
---
Any suggestions?
---
You try to cast fertilize soil on the tool leprechaun
---
I tried that grind, I ended up quitting over it ngl
---
Client, website and game code are three different things
---
Oh can you just not use them yet?
---
Saying something along the lines of 'you refused to help this player and basically gave him the middle finger.' isn't an 'immature' statement...
---
That is so hypocritical slash ironic it's actually sad. Rules for thee, not for me.
---
She isn't speaking down... if you had any reading comprehension she's literally talking about a skill set.
---
A Janitor isn't trained to be a developer, so people shouldn't expect the Janitor to do a developer's job. That's all she's saying but regarding Support staff.
---
Anybody else who thought OP should be Splashing Nieve until he can high alch?
---
How would that work?  I know the Ironman can give items away but not receive any, so how would he get something back for it?
---
Kill the spinners you fkin noobs
---
I‚Äôm friends with a bunch of big hosts and have experienced a lot of the drama, exactly 100% what this guy said. W30 is a fucking cesspool, you have hosts who try claiming the throne and taking control of all the other hosts. Try making new hosts have to go through them and pay % of tips or else they‚Äôll grief you. W30 hosts do nothing but host all day long to continue inflating their egos. It‚Äôs pathetic, OP said it perfectly, ‚Äúfilled with devious sociopaths and narcissists‚Äù
---
Hi Maz
---
üñï
---
But how am I going to get all recolours of graceful?
---
Saying 'you should handle the situation better' conveys a different meaning than 'you basically gave him the middle finger.'
---
If you're trying to convey the meaning of 'YOU REALLY FUCKED UP,' most of the better worded ways will come across as too light
---
No, I wouldn‚Äôt.
---
Never! She is the purest sweetest thing.
---
To all of you saying I should care more about DPS, I‚Äôm sorry I care more about swag. And ill eventually be getting FURY, imbued helm,  barrows gloves probably never, also ZGS has an underrated special attack. Cutenoobs rise up
---
meh
---
Just a little fuckin somethin somethin
---
I think that's really just a myth. Anyway maxed accounts must make up like 0.1% of the total old school population so their votes don't really mean shit.
---
"Back tracking", you mean back tracking as in the tweet before she mentioned that she was talking about how Roq doesn't do a particular job, to a person who was harassing Roq?
---
And as an example stated, Roq is just as positioned to do someone else's job as a janitor.
---
I think you lack reading comprehension.
---
I mean more the "engine work" thing as a whole.
---
I agree the auth delay thing is a joke
---
Nah it's probably worth it do get them repaired. Gives you a break like clue scrolls
---
Although I‚Äôm more of a dog person, she looks cute like that though :-) happy pet-sitting bro
---
You get it bro, big boy hours
---
How do you professionally state, in an angry tone 'YOU REALLY FUCKED UP?'
---
Reminds me of when I worked in a restaurant and instead of being fired people would be ‚Äúpromoted to guest‚Äù
---
&gt; serious pvmer
---
And also case sensitive passwords.
---
Dude what? Feedback is taken on all the time. Runescape has probably the most receptive dev team to criticism I've ever seen.
---
Based off his post history he got his first at 2800 and an ely just before 3k
---
816
---
Dude that's Chris Chan. Orange flavored cum.
---
Wejkol;fqoil;erwfbneqrw
---
A pmod gets removed for something like that while actual jmods can get away with snarky quips and potshots on twitter lmfao
---
give it to his main
---
I think it's a fair price for how much time I spend on the game.
---
You are hella toxic. I really feel bad for if you have a significant other. Most of your comments are just crying about things. lmfao
---
Its not like adding more content is in lieu of better bot detection. The content devs dont make the anticheat stuff. Thats not how it works.
---
Yeah I guess you are right.
---
you know it's true, don't be in denial.
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
It's not like they would have demodded him if he said this:
---
"The account security of OldSchool RuneScape isn't optimal and should be improved upon it as fast as possible, I feel like they need to step up their game."
---
His way of phrasing it was just unprofessional and agressive. I can't blame jagex for not wanting those types of people representing them. Especially because this wasn't even the first time he did stuff like this.
---
Yup. Just the guaranteed drops are almost 9k. Most of the other drops are 10k+. Definitely worth doing if you want to make a bit of money.
---
10-15 years
---
the game is absolutely worth it, but my #1 rule/tip is have fun, don't get sucked in to a grind like maxing, it really drains all the fun away imo
---
Same a single god damn thing that Wolf and West have done that have had a long-lasting negative impact on this game.
---
jagex is run by assholes who know they can make you eat their asses for a decade at the minimum before you stop giving them money.
---
Purple is awesome
---
time to start novelty accounts / pking
---
Hilarious that people fall for these emails. If you actually get hacked/cleared out falling for this in 2019 you completely deserve it. Takes a quarter of a brain to know it‚Äôs all junk.
---
hahah thanks man!! I was lucky enough to get the squirrel pet pre-99, gl on your hunt for it! 
---
( also I really disliked it but it was the last thing holding me from maxing so that probably played a part)
---
Yeah as an iron man you can have bonds used on you.
---
We just got a large update last week
---
Runelite also shows your boosts in another tab, plus a timer to show the next drop.
---
Got couple of them in my clan they swear and troll just as much as the next person. Love it when you say something truthful on reddit you get downvoted too.
---
And the champion's cape and 50 curved bones.
---
Doubt anyone would waste that much money on membership for a stunt that will get you banned
---
niiiice man! unlocked yourself that *ELITE* (cough) total world, gl with the last push!
---
Correction: he said that AFTER his account was recovered and they took a large majority of his valuables, he dumped the rest of the items from the bank and plans to abandon the account. That‚Äôs because the account can now be very easily recovered by the same person once he gets even more valuable items
---
Wow, someone spoke inappropriately to the company that gave them privileges and the company revoked the privileges. I'm ShOcKeD.
---
How does this not have upvotes
---
Artist is WLOP if anyone is wondering
---
I'm from Canada so maybe it's the exchange rate, but I always remember it costing right around $10 (this was back in 2007, mind you). I remember my WoW subscription being way more expensive, but I can't actually find any historical data to back that up.
---
Is that 109 FM from phoenix grind or some weird shit?
---
WLOP is a god
---
Solid, that sounds good. Are rune cbow or bp reasonably efficient? Too poor for dhcbow. :'(
---
Censorship on platforms you don't control for pmods (who are basically free remote work interns for you) is a little extreme.
---
Dont swear/get reported, like ever.
---
Use mature runescape names only.
---
Be a long time active account.
---
Participate on the actual runescape forums.
---
Report a lot of people who actually break the rules.
---
Also never voice an opinion that would go against jagexs.
---
Then you have a slight chance of being picked, like slight, better odds of winning the lottery.
---
real question is why are there two void gloves
---
Use the blowpipe. Rune crossbow on brutal blacks is real slow.
---
Man I wish KBD dropped a swampert that'd be dope
---
Hey, unfortunately the other guy is incorrect; ZMI does scale by your level. There just also happens to be xprate jumps every time you get a new pouch simply due to the fact that you can bring more essence per run.
---
E.G. at 50 you should average around 35k/h iirc, as you approach 75 it'll be closer to 40.
---
I mean, money is nice. This sounds good.
---
Is BP better than rune cbow then? Obviously too poor for dhcbow. ;P
---
No it's not. You've clearly had zero workplace experience in your life and are talking straight out of your ass.
---
Some take a few tries. Just keep trying.
---
Those people want to be heard. They tag unrelated JMods, because they don't know who else to contact. Then they, for some reason, expect them to give the message to right people at Jagex. 
---
They might do that for one request every once in a while, but they wont do it for dozens if not hundred requests per day. At some point it becomes just too much. It isn't their job to deal with it, they don't get paid for it. 
---
Most of those requests are nonsense anyway. I think that most of the complaints at Jagex are from people that simply do not understand their system and Jagex their reasons behind it. 
---
It is absolutely shameful to see people behave in this negative way. The worst thing about it is that its counter-productive. Do you think they want to be harassed and insulted? If anything they'll just stop engaging with the community.
---
I hate P K slays because he used to also get the ardy Knight despawned like a cunt
---
it's kinda difficult to describe, I recorded it and am editing the "maxing" video atm so I'll include it in there of course, I was happy and smiling but I wasn't... excited? I knew it was a long time coming so I guess I mentally prepared for it (am I really saying this 'bout a video game? hell yeah, 2020 here we come) also thanks!!
---
BP is much better. Just anti up and pray mage and you should be set.
---
Don‚Äôt hunt for an armadillo task. If one of you gets it go duo, if not do something else.
---
Awesome. Thanks mate!
---
1. Bots bots bots.
---
2. The community
---
3. Youtuber/streamer favoritism.
---
Biggest problem with that though is with email, you can easily do some research and reset the password along with removing 2 factor authentication. 
---
If you have SMS for RS, and have to contact support if you forgot it to verify phone number and account information/history it would be more difficult as you can't do basic research on the account history/information unless you told someone in which should be your responsibility not to.
---
Oof. What a fucking shitty and pretentious thing to say about janitorial staff. Especially on a public platform like Twitter. That deserves some form of reprimand imo
---
what a gay comment
---
Iirc the only things that don't involve a saw to construct are some of the garden features (fairy ring/spirit tree) and rooms.
---
How does commenting ‚Äúthis guy reached out to you and you guys gave him the middle finger‚Äù on twitter cause extra problems for jmods?
---
To be blunt, I don't care about the p-mod status removal. I do care about the player who lost all their stuff due to negligence by Jagex. Has that player been reached out to? Compensation, an account roll back, something to show that there is interest on an individual level, beyond a p-mod status. 
---
No offense intended to those who lost p-mod status for speaking out. Props to you.
---
By not taking an aggresive stance towards Jagex and :) by :) using :) a :) lot :) of :) smiley :) faces :) to :) show :) your :) positive :) attitude :) . :)
---
I wanna puke. That‚Äôs so much gold
---
Yeah a bit strange how he left and immediately started streaming and now he‚Äôs acting like a voice of the people. I don‚Äôt really think his opinion is regarded higher than others just because he worked at Jagex. He was a CM for like 9 months, not 5+ years
---
Ok and? Any other company would help secure your account regardless
---
Yeah man I draw realistic little kids getting fucked and jack off to them too man. It‚Äôs just drawings nothing weird about it.
---
Blast furnace steel bars
---
Ohh the call of duty on pc basically right? I know some people that play that. That‚Äôs fucking brilliant though. I wonder if the money was worth the ban hahaha

ü¶Ä BIG DICK STACY ü¶Ä
---
Ayy, its trending!
---
So Jagex, the company behind OSRS (which is what this sub is dedicated too) has pretty shit account security. Someones account just got recovered by a hacker and all their wealth was stolen. Even after the owner asked how it could have happened, the JMod (Jagex Moderator) gave your standard cookie-cutter useless advice that doesnt seem to work. A Pmod (Player Moderator, players chosen by Jagex to 'moderate' the game) got their power stripped after calling a Jmod out about it. Now the shitstorm ensues.
---
Funny thing is, Jagex already said about 2-3 months ago that their Player Support is shit (And it is, only hope of any support is to get upvoted on Reddit or Twitter famous) and that they would improve but considering they are taking power away from anyone that mentions the obvious, there is some doubt about their claims.
---
Thats the shortest explanation of this drama
---
Oh yeah and I forgot that there was never a time when a Jmod could harvest your data and pass it on to ROT
---
Ash and Kieran definitely give a shit
---
Awesome. Thanks for the help!
---
Or Cambridge.... hmm....
---
Is that Merry-Go? God damn it.
---
Phone number's can't be cloned. They can be spoofed however that is only for calling out and sending texts. This is simply called Caller ID spoofing. Receiving texts or calls are not affected if someone is spoofing your phone number.
---
Yeah, I more often than not do this as well even though I have 2FA set up.. 
---
It's a good safety precaution but not one we should feel like we have to take to be 100% safe.
---
And then export that number to the high-scores.
---
:( how much u got
---
They do it for super small stuff, knowing that it will get circlejerked in this sub for some good points with the community, but as soon as some real complaints or comments appear they absolutely ignore it.
---
I'm of the idea that people should be responsible for their own account safety, and that jagex already has the tools in place for each of us to secure our accounts, but pvp, the lack of gold sinks, duel arena impacting people's real lifes, etc, are all legitimate concerns that jagex continue to ignore.
---
So are jmods, why are they able to act the exact same way on twitter?
---
That fakie tre was so clean
---
Most people go for the noted dk bones with 77 rc
---
If your getting 77 and stopping it's for dk bones
---
If you plan to keep rcing it's for the bloods.
---
All these comments say it's for bloods, but most pvmers r going for notes dk bones with 77 rc
---
Three, maybe four
---
The max tea shelf gives a +3 con boost and only costs like 100k
---
It's very nice
---
Every time Riot has to make this kind of argument they use the artists or balance team as their example of "people who work for us that wouldn't know how to program stuff"
---
Going straight for the Janitor's is just low.
---
Good that Osrs has embraced raid culture from Vanilla WoW
---
The surprising part is he's made it this far in the game and still hasn't killed one, or done the diary.
---
Yeah man, I get it and I believe you. Just naturally thought it may have been a bought account.
---
I've always used the wiki for quests :P
---
This is definitely a good analogy, it's almost spot on in fact lol
---
Nigga livin in 3010 over here

what cosmetic?

Then to be extra sneaky re-hash it so it is spelled forwards
---
Rigour is so big compared to those other two
---
Pegs are only like +5 ranged bonus  over blessed and Ward is only like 20 ranged bonus
---
Ranged bonus is just accuarcy, while rigour has a damage boost aspect to it as well.
---
Correct, why not protect the stupid though?
---
This is awesome. Makes me dizzy too lol. Never learned how to skate :P
---
 7 . 3. will be ignored cause it doesn't fit the 'jagex bad, grr' rhetoric.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs ‚Äúunmodly‚Äù behavior which basically means yes you can‚Äôt speak out against them.

Gotcha, thanks for the insight!

Is there some context missing with this tweet? Why is everyone acting like Orion, someone completely unrelated to the conversation and not even on the support staff, is the devil because he told a guy to get a life after the guy called him a clown?
---
Your dad doesn't seem to mind.
---
Hey this deserves big respect forever and always, congrats my friend
---
Wait how was a temporary event a long lasting negative impactor on the game?
---
That‚Äôs some nice luck lol
---
Between yesterday and today, did about 7 or 8 Jad attempts. Still no cape. :(
---
Last attempt went pretty decent in regard to prayer flicking (only one or two missed ones) but I ended up dying to the healers.
---
Pretty frustrated at all the wasted time/money on this damn cape. Don't know why I'm having such a hard time with it.
---
the p mod stood up for the person getting fucked by customer support
---
Agreed, I see people actually trying to defend this sort of abuse. If all she wanted to do was highlight the different skill sets involved, she could‚Äôve said ‚Äúthere are many employees at Jagex that don‚Äôt directly deal with or have knowledge of x, y, z‚Äù. Instead she took a very rude and downright demeaning route and attached a role with a lower income. It‚Äôs downright disgusting.
---
try contacting police that someone is tryin to get your user info from your bank account it is a theft under the criminal law... but let me see hmm almost as it is nearly impossible to do anything about it

You can‚Äôt beat osrs. Osrs beats you

Worst part is, people say that a lot bc idek... I guess because I'm not super efficient?

Oops, got it confused with Grim Tales

---
A good pmod should speak out and get purged. If you‚Äôre complacent you‚Äôre not a good pmod imo. What will they do? Remove all pmods?
---
It‚Äôs like with not hiding pill results. Jagex made such a god damn fuss about it. They changed it when they believed it would help their suggested content pass. They are just lazy. They don‚Äôt have any keen insights preventing them from making this decision.
