"I wasted my life getting this account and you're going to devalue it with 200 torstols?!"

Get a fucking life.

It's still not worth banking bones for main accounts at Hydra lol.

I had lizardmen in the canyon. I killed the shamans in the left canyon. Worked fine

Just sold it for 6m, it's dropping in price so I wanted to sell it asap.

Well ya clearly do, cunt.

The one time I wanted to transfer stuff off an account, I spent it all on rune plate legs, and put one at a time in the chest before dropping it and logging over.
---
Totally worked.
---
not to mention he says he plays 15 hours a day because his wife is a breadwinner?
---
Look, I don't care if your entire life is served to you on a silver platter. Don't play this game 15 hours a day. Just don't. You're wasting your life.
---
Usually at like +5

I care
---
That is amazing.

I didn't even fucking noticed that because of the other shit. :joy: :gun:
---
 So this could be used to theoretically lower zuk magic accuracy and def to 0 so you could just face tank it if your shield get broken 🤔
---
Konar task
---
when you lose max hits
---
For a high level player I think it is. You can get much better xp with Duradel and make much more money elsewhere. 
---
The gp/xp trade off isn’t worth it in its current state for high levels imo. 
---
Not taking damage by doing mechanics perfectly!? Wow, such terrible game design!
---
No that was on my main haha, I will be doing trawler on my minigame only account once I get enough evil bob randoms to get 15 fishing.
---
Adding it in the first place didn't go over well. Jagex just need to suck it up and do it.

I swear I thought this was from pirates of the Caribbean

Absolute madman
---
Having a lower magic attack bonus will always reduce your chance of rolling a an accurate hit. However, if your opponent is a monster with level 1 magic, as long as your magic attack bonus is above -20 or so, your accuracy is still high, and adding more magic gear will only affect your accuracy very minorly, therefore it is better (will save more time) to wear e.g. prayer gear (slayer bursting) or tank gear (barrows). Hope that makes sense. 
---
Sure add me buschildlove
---
theres a med clue step that requires addy boots. there are a ton of hard clues that require med/hard clue items, or require neches unlocked etc.
---
People are also upset because he hadn’t even tried it out yet before requesting it to be nerfed, just saw a couple people get lucky drops. 
---
Banking is not worth it for mains, and it's less gp/hr than Vorkath and Zulrah (will even get worse as prices of uniques crash) so it's not as good as you claim.
---
73 :joy:
---
Congratulations! 
---
What if the colors change automatically, animated like the fire cape.
---
I’m in the same boat. About to block these garbage drakes. 84 slayer for what is arguably one of the worst tasks possible. I’d take Kourend black demons over these things 
---
Assuming you drank the Brave Potion from the legend's quest for the courage required to do Mage only Zuk, yes.
---
Are you sure you were on the real site?
---
Never really thought about that.
---
If you can pull 5m/hr you're not too far off of a minimum wage job. For those that don't know, OSRS GP goes for about 1m/$1 right now.
---
Wild.
---
Sorry to hear that, I’m not sure what to do besides wait for Jagex to get back to you but I think your account security is the problem. While you wait, I would change your email password, your rs password, make sure you have an Authenticator set up, bank pin. Good luck, upvoted for visibility.

Underrated meme

At 91 fishing and 89 hunter I'm getting half the xp rates of 99 and 1 pearl per 30 minutes. All I'd want to see buffed is the pearls.

Have you tried going to the canyon to see if the kills will count in there as well?
---
Lol nice name.

Lol does anyone remember the time faux was streaming Corp and someone said it’s boring content and faux got super super confrontational and started berating the guy talking about how Corp is some of the highest risk content for hcim? Like anyone wants to watch that shit

Much better than say, tassets, for less than half the price.
---
52 is a medium req for sure. 
---
But is it possible to get 200 quest points without RFD?
---
Shut up serene’s alt
---
I have not. I figured there's no point since the canyon is a completely different area altogether :/
---
dunno why you kids are worried about this nobody is veng bombing you for your hide set mate
---
nah, a post made it to the front page and had gold stating he was hosting a 10bil drop party. i assumed it was real because i thought posts like that had to be approved but i guess not.
---
ironman idc about gp/hr
---
gl tho
---
ironman btw
---
What the fuck did you just say about Mr. Pocket?
---
probably yeah but rfd isn’t the hard part of B gloves at all it’s getting the 176 QP. and it’s not going to mess up pure builds because they require 80 defense to wear 
---
I got the exact same drop on my first kill this morning, it sold for 8.5m. They need to nerf this now, this is getting out of hand /s
---
That makes no sense. Brutal blacks are an entirely different slayer monster that require 77 slayer. Drakes aren't even dragons, they're drakes
---
What the fuck did you just say to me you little noob? I'll have you know I have an untrimmed cooking cape... 
---
Watching Monni get dropped for max again
---
Priceless.
---
Oh snap! 
---
i would wait till 82 con tbh. Or at least 65 for spec pool, and get 2 bgs specs off each kill. 
---
Also a blowpipe is a good deal more dps than the arclight, at the expense of some defence
---
Doesn't mean they can't post on Reddit in their sparetime.
---
Can I have 500k too?
---
Where do you think the best place for him to spawn is? I was told south of Italy rock but i don’t know if that’s true.
---
the problem seems to be that the method that it achieves the effect is by reducing the magic level of bosses, since that's what is used for magic def. its also used with magic attack though, so you end up with shit like corp hitting 0s on you...
---
Fam, I’m a weeb and anime is weird as shit.  it’s what got me into it.
---
Well depending on how Warding plays out, OSRS might be able to take advantage of a similar strategy.
---
Yeah cuz on your time off you want to deal with work. gtfo of here man.
---
Sorry, as a self proclaimed weeb, I heavily disagree. Anime in general is weird as shit because its easier to make a product with shock and meme value than it is to make anyone of those shows that you've mentioned, as unfortunate as it is.  Have you seen that show where they turn Yakuza members into idols? Also most anime is not made with Western audiences in mind, in the first place, so of course there's gonna be cultural differences that simply don't translate.  
---
It's for Church, honey

I'd argue that Vengeance is an offensive spell there for a attack spell.Multiple people used this attack spell on the Monni. There for its questionable.
---
This would be good, and less people would get kicked off the boat.

The economy was also very different back then, money was much harder to come across. I'm sure 15m now is worth less than 9m was back then.

Put down your thesaurus and shut up, Serene. 
---
Definitely doesn't seem to be inline with the wording from the news post:
---
&gt; and has a 1/4 chance with each spell cast to ignore 10% of your opponent's total Magic Defence. 
---
The use of the word "ignore" rather than "reduce" definitely means that it should be for a single attack, and not stack indefinitely. 
---
And I would also assume that "total magic defence" would mean the magic defence roll, not magic level, although practically there isn't much difference. 
---
It's still funny for them to be quiet; that just makes Reddit suspicious because we're a hivemind of angst and anxiety.
---
maybe make the upgrades a part of konar drop table

nobody likes them. If you are against afk, then i'm afraid this may not be the right game for you.

---
It really do be like that.
---
Lmao swing back with a cannon, fuck that nerd.
---
DO NOT buy it now. The Lance is probably a 1/512 drop, and the Hydra is an easy 25 kill/h boss, meaning one lance per 20 hours on average. Also, Hydra has 100k loot without uniques per kill, so it's basically a better Cerberus V2. Lance will inevitably go down to like 40-50m since with current prices Hydra is over 10m/h lmao.
---
It was polled as a cosmetic
---
It’s 11.10 in NYS and even higher in some other states, it differs depending on where you’re from
---
so when i have 99 mage and am shooting for 99 str while I slay im a pleb for not bursting/barraging? 🤔 I can see how it annoys you, but some, like myself, havent finished skotizo yet so those totems are very nheeded to be able to do so and im gonna slay em how I want, if i was there first anyways it wouldnt matter which combat style I would be using, cus you'd still be hopping along. 
---
Not sure why it passed to begin with, everyone knew it was going to be useless/worthless, since the thing it attaches to is worthless. The neck has like 1 use in the entire game and its not even needed. 
---
Nice. 
---
Just because the old admins left in a tantrum it doesn't mean others can't still use it. 
---
What's the best money making methods at the moment ? Slayer ? I'm currently doing mining. Also I read somewhere everything but dragon boots is cosmetic (dragon wise) when it comes to armor this true ?
---
Konar drop table is additional drop table exclusively by Konar assignments. Whips are dropped at the same rate regardless how you kill the demons. Comparing other rates of obtaining an item worth of 2m is irrelevant because if you use Konar's task, you earn money but likely lose in xp. That's how it works.
---
People do very well realize that the problem is what the loots consist of. I haven't seen any posts complaining about the value of the drops; solely about what is being dropped.
---
:D
---
&gt;it'll probably be a couple hundred mill at least.
---
you forget how easy lances are coming into the game. It's probably a 1/512 drop from a 25+ kill/h boss with 100k+ non unique loot per kill. If the Lance would be a couple hundred, lets assume 200m each, that'd mean 2,5m regular loot/h + 10m lance loot/h (since 1 lance will take on average 20 hours) meaning Hydra becomes a 12,5m/h slayer boss, which is very unlikely.

i would just focus on strength first using whatever the best scimitar you have available is and just get the abby whip when you have the stats and money for it

I used to go behind the bank in lumbridge castle on that little walkway, drop gold on the ground, then quickly switch over to my other account and camp the spot til it appeared. Got sketchy at times when people would wander over at the wrong times.

High activity, low XP, no reward.
---
I think this method will be an empty wasteland within a couple weeks.
---
Hey at least you get 300k compared to nothing before and thats great. 2m is abusive.
---
Yeah, definitely can be if you get lucky with spiders/skeletons/etc.
---
A good idea is to get decent strength maybe like 50 or so and rush a d scim.  Once you have a d scim make getting a dragon defender your goal.  Once you got both of those keep strength 5-10 levels ahead of attack and defense.

umm... bank things, use your anti shield, buy antifire pots?

---
I thought the problem with the drops was that they devalued skillers? I mean, yeah, drops ranging from 2m to 7m is a bit overkill. But the thing is, it's not like players will be getting the best drops every single task. Like, I just completed my third Konar task, and I've only received like 20k worth of pure essence and 2 crystal keys so far. I think a big reason for that is because the drops DO scale. Kind of. Those 3 tasks were all against monsters under level 100, so it makes sense  that I would get fewer drops. For lower levels, they either have to face weaker monsters and have fewer drops, or take more time to kill stronger monsters for more drops. It's rather balanced in that way.
---
The point is, Konar isn't going to allow low/mid leveled players suddenly start earning like 2m an hour. It's more like a supplement to cash stack, something that's really nice for low level slayer given the number of slayer monsters that drop practically nothing - maybe like an extra 30k to 500k per task. And it comes at the downside of being forced to slay at certain locations, rather than optimal locations. The main problem with the old drops, from what I understand, is that stuff like the herbs devalued skilling. The best method to get ranarrs would have been slayer, not farming, which can be a bit of a problem.
---
Overall I don't care too much about the nerf. It'd be a lot more exciting if there was the chance to get like a 2m drop, and I would definitely like to earn more gp per task, but I wouldn't want to ruin skilling or the economy through it. However, I would really like to see a change in the form of something like this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/af1l00/konar\_quo\_maten\_drop\_table\_suggestions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/af1l00/konar_quo_maten_drop_table_suggestions/)

Why did you have the rune kiteshield with you, my friend. Did you not realise that you were supposed to use an anti-dragon shield? Given to you by the Duke of Lumbridge.

They are simply mediums for the expression of ideas.

Good guide, some things could have been explained better (i.e) giving more examples on how to lure it with melee, but overall it should give people an idea of what meleeing hydra is like. I reckon this will mainly be the go to method for irons without a lot of scales/tbow.

Because it's just not worth wasting the time banking them. People can stay there for 20 kills, so you just wasted time going back and forth 4 times to bank bones worth a total of 1 Hydra kill. By the time you do that I'd have killed Hydra another 4-5 times and made more gp overall.

40 attack 40 strength 30 def
---
What? Farming? It's the easiest skill to train efficiently.
---
What’s this?
---
How do
---
Bots were definitely not non existent..
---
RWT was still done often, it was just a bit more risky for the buyer. Things like sorc garden and green drags were heavily, **heavily** botted. If you wanted to buy gp, the gold farmer logged in to your account and manually did/botted methods like gathering potato cacti which gave 3-4m/hr in junk. IE you couldn't sell it on the GE, but it made your "bank value" go up. They then bought that junk on their bot farms.
---
Yes, this is why you farm medium clues. Even in your own statement, you say the 35m drop takes 10 hours. Which would mean 3.5m an hour.
---
Rangers are only 1/333-1/200 and with the number of clues you can do per hour it does indeed take, on average, around 10 hours to get a pair of rangers. Obviously your milage may vary - currently meds have been about 6m an hour for me based on how lucky I've been. 
---
300-400k an hour with any 99 isnt good

Get 44 rc and make nature runes or barrows

When have we ever known Jagex to balance a drop table good? Literally look at pre nerf zulrah, revs, and vorkath. Suggesting to nerf it is like telling them to raw dog the loot table.

---
Which wasn't what he asked for either. He was calling for equal value replacements, which definitely isn't what we got. Even he thinks its been overnerfed now.

Personally I'm just hoping Jagex gathers some good ideas and makes the table relevant again next week.

Yes, it does.

?????
---
Email
---
Hes probably logging in with email
---
If it doesn't matter, then why complain about it changing?
---
Jagex insisted on nerfing it. Faux just want it to not be completed brews or herbs. That change literally only affects ironmen, and the whole point of iron man is locking content behind levels. If you can get 2500 brews without touching herblore, that's a problem.
---
A lure would be like what Jojo3000 was notorious for doing. A scam would be a money doubler.
---
I still fully agree that it should've been nerfed. 100-200 high demand herb drops is still ridiculous even if it was super rare. Should we just keep quiet if they decide to put barrows items in an otherwise good loot table for something random in the future? No, it needed to be changed and it was. As is stands right now, I'm glad they nerfed it the way they did.
---
Go to stronghold of security, go to the third floor and kill giant spiders!! 
---
This looks inaccurate as I get hundreds of each rune. 140 deaths does not look right at all seeing they drop 40+ each time and is common.

For those interested in the maths.
---
He got a 737 combined hp/mage xp drop
---
737 - 52xp for the barrage cast is 685. This gives us the xp earned from damage.

You get 4 mage xp and 1.3333\~ hp xp per damage from the cast.

685 / 5.333333 = 128 damage
---
Veng + recoil reflects 85% damage back in total
---
128 / 0.85 = 109.
---
Monni did 109 damage to himself from that barrage. If he was brewed, he might have survived.
---
You can just buy everything you need. You skip tasks by exiting the dialog after you see what the secretary wants. However, you can't skip tasks that you get from the director I believe.
---
Not really. Tbow itself adds something like 200k/hr to raids 1. Since most people will see 0-2 tbow drops in their lifetimes, it has a very minimal impact on their gp/hr in raids.
---
It's ridiculous to say that a table shouldn't be changed because they might nerf it. 
---
"anime/kpop titter avatar" - and youtube lol!
---
It's certainly possible, they didnt compromise anything except runescape though, which is odd. It is also possible i downloaded a bad client? I didnt even know such things existed. I just googled it after a friend recommended i use runelite over osbuddy. 
---
And neither have I rofl, but you claim I have.
---
You say Karma is pointless, and then you make a thread of comments talking about nothing. That was my point, about irony. You clearly missed that.
---
Pray mage, click wyrm. Why was this needed.
---
Wtf is wrong with this subreddit, these comments I mean. Congrats man and hope your grandma is going to recover. 
---
I personally take a whip and salve (ei) with me. Those 5 skeletons melt hella quick.
---
I thought I was the only one who got sad over this lol. Zanik is so pure
---
You can play around it if you know what you're doing. Why would it be fixing?
---
experiments one is longest I think
---
"All kills on task for a slayer assignment from Konar have a chance of hitting a global drop table. It is accessed at a rate of 1/100 for combat-level 100 monsters, and 1/50 for combat-level 350 monsters"
---
sir what wiki are you reading
---
runelite - stretched mode
---
so by refusing, or just re-clicking on the secretary before accepting? I'm an ironman
---
I was in favor of a nerf, but not in favor of making it dead content. That loot table is worse than shit now.
---
Bruh, we were spelling out nice try serene...
---
Also, i dont recall signing in on runelite with any other account than the one i currently use, which was NOT compromised.
---
Screenshot where you downloaded runelite from 
---
8 is the maximum that would matter. Any more than that is functionally useless.
---
Currently at work. Will update you soon.
---
I JUST REALIZED WHY IT DID THAT. I AM DUMB. PLZ FORGIVE ME. ILL PAY $12 NOW IF YOU WANT.
---
I had saves up 2300 points and didnt get the hydra task. Around 5 tasks later i finally got one. After that it took around 5 tasks again to get another. 
---
Still too much trouble when, as he said, it just takes up the slot of another restore. 
---
Imagine being this person, just for a second
---
RS would be what they would be after. 
---
The amount of bad luck that's waiting for you now... oh boy
---
Gratz tho
---
Yeah, but that's not anyone's fault besides Jagex alone. It NEEDED a nerf, people said it should be nerfed, and Jagex decided to screw it up a second time. It 100% isn't Faux's fault.
---
it could've been 3, you only get 15 per item 
---
&gt;Opponent stands on predetermined tile. Once opponent is low enough that attacker thinks he can 1shot with Ice Barrage, opponent's buddies log in/hop worlds, standing on the same tile. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Casting Vengeance reflects 75% of the damage the next hit would've dealt, which is what they did. Therefore Monni gets hit by several vengeance procs, because Ice Barrage is AoE
---
You forgot the important bit.
---
Monni is stood in the single combat, his opponent however is stood in multi combat (Monni even takes a step back so they can't spear him into multi) so Monni thinks he's safe as only one person should be able to attack him but because Veng doesn't count as an attack it reflects the damage he deals to everyone even though he's in single combat.
---
Still really impressive timing as they all logged into the correct spot and venged in the   3 second window between barrages
---
Vengeance is not an offensive spell. It's literally the opposite.
---
I originally saw it talking about Chevy Chase. 
---
A week ago they were, at a price of around 200 each.
---
 But Sadly the new slayer boss craps out astral runes so they have crashed pretty hard all the way to like 120 each yesterday. However, the price does seem to be recovering. Unless you are desperate for money ASAP you could start a big session of astrals and be patient for a price you are comfortable to sell at.
---
You can mention people on reddit as well. Also part of my point is why would Jagex focus so much on Twitter and completely ignore reddit, home to the largest forum for their game short of their own website. Why aren’t developers treating Reddit like Twitter? 
---
I too got an attas seed first kc, along with the bottomless compost bucket. 10/10 would fight again.
---
hate to break it to ya but chocolate is toxic to dogs. it's like giving me gin.
---
Fuck you Serene!
---
By demanding a nerf after &lt;24 hours, it makes it seem like he thinks the table is so fucking absurd that they overnerfed it because of player (reddit) reaction. 
---
It’s growing, don’t know if it’s fully grown. I planted it on Friday afternoon. 
---
First names isn't doxing. I restrained from posting your full names and addresses, but i'm not an asshole like your wiki mafia.
---
Surprise anal vore him, he mite appreciate it then
---
They were unplayably laggy like 2 years ago. They’ve been perfectly fine recently
---
Memberships definitely worth getting especially when you’re starting training in free to play can be rough. My only tip is to just look everything up there’s tons of information online and videos on YouTube about nearly everything you could need help with.
---
That's kinda the point the poison in his inventory makes it seem like this is a mercy killing of the poor pup
---
What... what is it?
---
Oh my God you can't tell?! It is clearly something very funny XDDD
---
Are you seriously complaining about needing to use a prayer pot for Slayer? 
---
How do i delete someone else's reply..?
---
I think it'd be cool to see time trial tasks, where instead of given a certain number to kill, you're given a time limit to kill as many as possible, with rewards at certain thresholds? Thinking cosmetic rewards, mostly just for prestige
---
Nothing on Lunar’s is an offense spell.
---
"from which house you're from" is redundant.. 
---
I haven't seen anything on this, but do the higher level farming contracts give better rewards than the easier ones? I've mostly been doing the hard contracts, but a lot of them are pretty expensive to do (I had to grow a amgic tree today, for example) so if I'm not getting a better reward out of doing them then I might start doing the easy ones instead. 
---
&gt;If serene actually cared what redditors thought about him he would've stopped posting months ago.
---
 If serene didn't actually care what redditors thought about him he would've stopped posting months ago. 
---
either works
---
Whoa your not taking into account those ultra rare drops are based off combat lvl of whatever you are fighting. It's not even related to mxt. Just sounds like your butthurt there's a possibilty of really good rng. Its sad cause back in the day, if you hit rare drop table as a low lvl d med or shield left half could be a nice boost at low lvls! Why not give them a chance again.
---
I personally haven't killed any of them yet, I'm still focused on Hydra, but I'm sure that if the table needs tweaked they will. But yes the incentive to kill them on task is the konar drop table. You have no access to that table off task.
---
Unlock him as a slayer task!! Slayer helm helps so much. 
---
Remote Access Troijan *
---
Gotcha, is there a way to make the menus and text bigger? My sight is really poor and it's very hard to make out/see things. Do you have any recommendation for something? Or is that not allowed here. Sorry 
---
Drakes have the 2 uniques that upgrade Boots of stone and Holy Sandles. They also have decent alchables and stackables as well.
---
Worth doing the task imo, made around 400k in alchs and another 4-500k in stackables I’m about 160 drakes. 
---
Defender for max kills, DFS for max afk.
---
Depends on what your priority is.
---
Kill a wyrm
---
Kill a hydra
---
Guess it's only a skilling thing.
---
U sound like girl
---
Made 58mil on two short term lance investments today, sold at 142 as I figured it won’t go above what DHCB goes for. For a long term investment l, I don’t think it will be a good idea as I personally with it’s in a pretty good place if it sits at 100mil in its current form.
---
H
---
I made profit from magic longs
---
How the fuck do you have 99 mage yet you haven’t fought skotizo?? You never bursted dust devils?
---
correct
---
Absolutely disgusting.
---
As a kid my dream was to ice barrage people in castle wars, y does everyone and their mother seem to have dreamed of max stats?
---
Found the Zamorakian
---
Oh, whoops. I haven’t had anything die in it yet so I thought it was.
---
We're agreeing, I was just using your comment to expand on why she's actually VERY good and not dead content since this post randomly got a lot of traction.
---
I see that, but I have to ask... How did you ever even notice that?? Lol for me anyway, I don't really care what my character looks like other than skin color because 99% of the time, that's all I can see
---
Correction: herb patch is not disease free! My mistake
---
Meta is to barrage Smoke Devils, Nechrayaels, Dust Devils (latter 2 in Catacombs), then cannon all the other tasks in BiS STR gear (so Bandos or Fighter Torso + Obsidian Legs on a budget).
---
If you can't cannon a task, you just skip it. Block Abyssal Demons, Hellhounds, Cave Kraken, Greater Demons, Black Demons, and Bloodvelds or Gargoyles. Get the Fossil Island Wyvern block reward.
---
Use Bracelet of Slaughter on all good tasks (Smoke Devils, Nechs, Dust Devils, Dagannoths, and maybe Kalphites depending on your level). Use Expeditious Bracelet on all other tasks.
---
Extend Nechs and Dust Devils, unlock Tzhaar tasks if you can do Inferno in ~1hr or Fight Caves in like 20-30 mins depending on your efficiency but for Fight Caves only before you unlock Smoke Devils.
---
Nearly 3k points on skips, 10+ konar tasks and I've had 0 hydra tasks :) :) :) :)
---
LMFAO you idiots pay literal millions for his weekly golf vacations and it goes straight to his businesses.
---
Can’t believe you’re getting downvoted, oh wait it’s not slayer related or a new 4m/hr boss so you must be an absolute retard to suggest it.
---
Cringe.
---
I can confirm, I took a 6 month break from RuneScape, when I came back I had to recover my account and it had full void (which I’ve never gotten) and 1108 Zulrah kills (which I’ve never fought).
---
He stole my whole bank though :(
---
Miraak?
---
Konar
---
So it’s okay if I complete sub 30 minute raids and get 20-100m splits but to grind something for 8 hours for the same profit is bad? 
---
You mean offcuts? They can be used as bait for barbarian fishing
---
Actually, you bring up a good point, why don't any of the NPCs run??
---
Bet your enjoying those brine rats just as much!
---
A whole 20k
---
That is a perfectly reasonable statement. I learn kinesthetically so switching between windows, scrolling etc helps me take stuff in. I can watch a video 3 times and miss what they said in a bad accent.
---
Depends on the item. Shit like flax and p ess should be dropped but bulk herbs are overdoing it. The drop table shouldn't just be rune alchables. I know this game isn't built around ironmen, but not gonna lie it's feels good building up skulking supplies through PvM. It's just a fine line they have to figure out. Some tasks should suck and some should be like Nechs and give 15ish seeds per task. 
---
because limps aren’t worth that much. it’s better to keep nasturtiums there and then your watermelons will never die. 
---
You're one to talk weeb manchild.
---
Stayed 1 hour. Some guy did a 5m~ drop party at 6pm EST. Got 1,3m.
---
shit fam this changes the game
---
No they do support it. The stated in a past stream more people actually use runelite than the official client lol. 
---
OSBuddy is the one I don’t trust personally. They have a bad history. 
---
However runelite is open source and you can see for yourself it is safe. Go back a month or so on the OSRS homepage and there is a post about runelite plugins, how Jagex has several removed and have an a-okay to the rest. To each their own just now that it really is safe and incredibly helpful lol
---
Why did he still have health?
---
Wait, can you actually be closer to the  UK than the US while being in the US? Wtf. 
---
Having this at the banks would be a pretty great feature. It would totally make sense, and I like the idea of it being by weight. Makes me really wish the loan mechanism still existed so you could pass around things to your friends to use while you’re not. 
---
What a fucking scammer

Stats? I wanna get to Zulrah soon!

Doesn't mean you shouldnt attempt it. Who says you have to run to complete a marathon. crawling over the finish line still counts as completing it.
---
75 combat. Teleport using skills necklace and run north up the volcano. 
---
Sick dude
---
idk about the reward necessarily but I think its always best to take the hardest contract possible for you. You're always able to request an easier one for free so there's really no harm in taking the highest one and it gives you the most chances for getting one you can do.
---
Correct. It’s hard to do switches while still learning, I just made it easier on myself. And I tried at 75 mage but couldn’t do it. Higher mage and getting the Trident of the Swamp seemed to make a difference for me!

Yea it was the shit. God a blue ween mask once. Best times for me lol, the adrenaline rush was insane.

Sad you even have to clarify your not being sarcastic, I’ve been enjoying the update too
---
I'm assuming it's the drop range at 99. It wouldn't make sense if you always got the exact same number of fish every time if you didn't level up.
---
Thank you.
---
Camp gargoyles with guthans. 500k/hr consistently and afk 
---
For experience, no.  XP will come from trees and allotments mostly.  Tithe farm will give decent xp rates but its tedious.
---
Check out the farming guild if you haven't already, the contracts are pretty good money and there are extra patches for most plants.
---
Also cactus spines are good for gp.
---
DM me and I'll explain ( ͡☉ ͜ʖ ͡☉)
---
Sand casino bro
---
shut up new serene
---
Thanks for this. Gargs are less gp/hr than I thought lol
---
No he’s talking and moving now, in castle wars 334. It’s still there 
---
Its 1.1 gp/xp on average. So take whatever xp/hr you got and \* 1.1
---
obviously if someone is asking that question theyre talking about gp value
---
*(notices that you're not praying)*
---
OwO what's this?

How do you know he records his sessions? Genuinely curious.

first issue was a bird house run into seaweed. running through the crabs to the boat, somehow auto was on and got 11hp exp. I dont touch auto retaliate with a 10ft pole. It is just confusing how it is turned on in the first place.

Yeah bro like wtf she's trying to sleep smh..

Kind of defeats the whole purpose of her assigning tasks with locations doesn't it?

Nah that shit never happens. You'll still get attacked even when you have full graceful.

People use GE prices to scam all the time.  Most of them have been eliminated but every once in a while they come up again.  It used to be people would trade you a stack of enchant spell tabs for the GE price of like 1k, but the actual price was like 300.  Be very wary of anyone selling outside of GE, especially if its an uncommon item.
---
Imagine not worshiping Guthix in 2019 lol
---
do one for max fire cape vs max inferno cape
---
Sandcrabs are your best bet until you can afford good gear for Nightmare Zone (NMZ). Nmz is a safe minigame where you fight specific quest bosses. It's possible to manipulate it and get high melee xp/hr while being super afk (click once a minute). I would recommend looking for the best afk nmz guide on YouTube. 
---
yeah the real reason is that most obelisk pkers are ~lvl 65 and i'm too high to be pk'd but shhhh meme moments

holy shit dude i got all the way to 95 slayer without knowing i could skip my task??? omggggggg youre a genius how did you figure that out?!?!?

Wouldn't call RS3 that pretty tbh, I enjoyed playing it but the horrible character models especially and 90% of the map looks like it belong to pre 2010 graphics. It looks ok but pretty would be for more impressive looking MMORPGS like Black Desert, ESO or FF XIV.
---
The demand for spades is too damn high.

It is fair, some people know multi lines and can play around it, some people dont and get punished for it. 
---
&gt; If ANYONE knows what they're doing it's Monni
---
Sure
---
&gt;Players shouldn't have to memorize every single square that is multi
---
Why? That's knowledge and skill. Where's the logic in removing that?
---
1) they update slayer all the time it’s pretty much half of what anyone does in this game, kebos itself is mostly a slayer update
---
2.) co-op slayer was never meant to have any benefits over normal slayer and it never will, it’s just a way to slay with your friends if you want to

Some kid I went to school with got a firemaking cape in 7th grade and was treated like the damn.pope by our friend group

Slayer question...Currently level 67 slayer almost 68. I use Duradel and I only have 3 block spots for slayer. Need 8 more quest points for a 4th, will get that eventually. 
---
But currently I have steel dragons and black demons blocked. What do you recommend should be my 3rd block?
---
???? it's nowhere near vorkath levels what

I find it hard to believe that Watermelons (no death) + Nasts is worth more than Watermelons (some minimal death) + Limps.  Are you saying that's the case?

Can you get a contract to plant a Hespori?
---
Chins in the mm2 tunnel are like 450-1m an hour depending on a lot of factors.
---
Blowpipe is anywhere between 80-140k xp/hr, magic shortbow imbued is a more budget option and would be like 50-80k
---
Fair enough. The only thing im pretty sure didnt change is the fact that he finds calmness in repitition, but maybe we found that in other games!
---
Well, I did see one guy who double-deathed on Zuk... So there is that.

He may be just a wagon, but he hits like a truck.

Fuck off stop advertising your private server.

99 RC is impressive indeed!

u just said that
---
The amount of mental retardation that comes out on this sub is amazing
---
The difference is that if you ever actually need Yews or basically any other med-high lv resources then you probably already have the skills to get them yourself. Thus, high- level players especially don't bother with low(or zero) activities xp like leather tanning, normal logs and so on. However, there is still high demand on the GE from newer accounts with low skills, thus driving the price of said supplies up. I personally just think leather should cost like 30 gp and normal logs should absolutely be the cheapest kind. But skillers and money-focused accounts have collectively ruined the GE. 
---
I'm like low/mid ironman and I'm loving this new content!
---
“Zulrah's gender is ambiguous; the High Priestess Zul-Harcinqa refers to it as a male, while the examine text of Zulrah's boss lair display refers to it as a female.”
---
This is straight from the wiki and what I was referring to. The wiki is generally a good source because people always update it. I will always see Zulrah as female though.
---
Great, thankyou!! 
---
Stop complaining
---
Science 
---
You should try and pregrow as much of the common stuff as you can. Also split the allotment between two different things, and have everything ready to harvest/check health when you deliver a contract.
---
Can get a free second box immediately half the time, and hit streaks of 3-4 a few times.
---
Fucking hell this speaks to my soul
---
Yeah man my goals were get ghostly robes and a dragon longsword. I was about set after that.
---
according to wiki boxes from harder tasks give better seeds on average.

its oblv man pvm is the only real thing to do on this game no one gives to shits about skilling

---
Just neck yourself on those trees, you plum
---
Free to play runecrafting is the source of all evil in RuneScape. Body runes are all you have because there's literally no other runes to craft
---
That's true for revenants, it's been on lockdown by a clan or clans for who knows how long. The second you step in there, you'll see a bunch of people who are skulled and they'll get on you instantly since you're not apart of the clan. Unfortunate 
---
I roleplayed with this fellow player for 3 straight hours while we were grinding at mines, people around us tagged along. Twas a very funny 3 hours. "It seems my sachel is full, I shall leave momentarily to deposit the contents to the bank. But I will be back with an empty purse and a full heart". Good lad he was.
---
Why do we all hate serene? Is it pack mantaloty? Or is he just a smelly loser 
---
I was considering doing Rune Drags after camping Gargs for a while to get melee stats up. Pretty steep requirements though
---
Ill have to look into that some more. If I were to go with a pure mage build would i be able to use abyss no problem ? 
---
The money is nice from Konar yet bossing is good gold as well. 
---
he had one for a really long time even when he was max autistic
---
Ever since playing this game as a wee lad I wanted the legends cape. At the ripe age of 25, I’ve done it. Just wanted to share because no friends etc.

No possible downsides except for making an already insane GP P/H boss even more lucrative...

The cape is quite decent considering the price

The fish sack is purely cosmetic which is a total joke for what a nightmare it is to get. I was hoping it'd hold bait for 1000 pearls.

Helplessly sheeping it with the easy karma bait train. ^_^

Why would you tell someone with level 40 stats to get a torso? It's hard enough carrying noobs with a dscim and rune armour.
---
holy shit, when i was 12 y/o i didn’t have the attention span to do Demon Slayer
---
actually that maybe explains a lot about me now
---
I was considering that but that really is OP, I'll work on setting that up.  Thanks!
---
Did it also work for regular Dragon Daggers? I remember a time when I was near the party room and I got 2 regular dragon daggers from a balloon. The person there told me to give it back or their friend would hack my account, so I did. Never even thought about it until now. Why would somebody's friend give them dragon daggers via the party room? The answer must be that
---
Jealous
---
Is that a setting you can turn on? Cause I've never noticed that before 
---
A long time ago they were going to add bank to bank trading.
---
Also, I remember reading about how they can't do an in-game mailing system because that requires the game to store player messages in the system and how they could get in legal trouble for it. 
---
A true MVP
---
TIL that Ayiza left Jagex. Been away from OSRS and this subreddit for a decent time.
---
Sorry, I don’t speak broke.
---
Do salve and elite void and dragon hunter lance with gloves plz
---
I thought when I read up on contracts it explicitly said you can't just harvest something you planted before getting the contract?
---
Neat 
---
I fully support this
---
&gt; You can shave off a growth cycle with a Kronos seed
---
There is a chance to. Not 100%. 
---
This resulted in drop trading from account to account and man drop trader hunting was some of the most profitable fun I ever had playing RS.
---
Lol implying you have to be a part of the commonwealth to use a non base 10 system that only the US and one 3rd world country use. 
---
Time to do Jad , nan. Chop chop.
---
Yeh you can probably squeeze 2-3 in, but without refreshing spec using POH the kills are slow and renders the method slower than a DHCB. Best of luck with that attitude though fella.
---
Don't you have servers in Australia? That's literally a Chinese colony. 
---
No
---
In fact, the Hydra should be placed FURTHER away from a bank.
---
It's far to quick to get to it considering how many kills you can do a trip.
---
Whip em
---
the character models look so fucking uncanny

That’s beside the point. The reward is the reward.

the word you are looking for is piqued you inbred
---
Chad even wears his cape backwards 
---
A whip comes from abyssal demons and only abyssal demons while various herbs have come from pvm before farming was even a thing. Nearly everything drops some type of herb. Herblore is a ridiculously expensive skill that can survive a little devaluation in my opinion. 
---
No better unfortunately:(

Superheat item

THIS IS TEMPORARY CALM DOWN. The weekend was coming and they didnt want to ruin an entire skill in less that 72 hours. 
---
Q
---
Its displayed at the world switcher tab
---
Would be cool but I can't imagine they'd willingly spend dev time that only appeals to people who
---
A) have a 1/5k pet
---
and
---
B) have extra heads still sitting in their bank
---
Can't imagine that's a big crowd. 
---
Can someone explain what the hell happen ?
---
its just another way to add skill to the game pretty much. 1ticking while also managing your health/positioning etc. 
---
For basic slayer it doesnt rly make sense but when it comes to stuff like solo raids, inferno, gwd solos/record attempts its a lot more balanced/interactive/interesting.
---
new skillcape mote pl0x
---
Perhaps with just harvesting. In my case I waited with health checking as well until I got my next contract so that should do the trick. 
---
Wow looking at that it's almost like the KDT had negligible impact on the amount of herbs being brought into the game. Kind of like the Jmods said? Good thing they listened to certain content creators who didn't even try the content and nuked it
---
Moist towelettes
---
You know, one thing that always struck me is how different the vampyres are between RS3 and OSRS. 
---
In RS3, they were (as far as Zamorakians go) pretty chill. Sure, they enslaved humans and kept them as mobile snacks, but Vanescula made everything they've done relatively reasonable; they enslaved people as a source of food, made vyres to keep numbers up to deter war, and threaten going past the Salve to lessen the blood tithe burden and get more resources. The worst thing they really do is kill a few Myreque, emotionally torture Gadderank's wife, and kill blood tithe people if they don't meet the tithe. The majority of them don't really give a shit about the villains and just want to be minor dicks.
---
In OSRS though, good lordy. Serafina and the Abomination already put them miles ahead of RS3 in terms of being fucked up. I'm not sure how they could have anything less than a vyre murdering spree for the finale of the questline here.
---
\&gt;every piece of equipment 
---
I can think of 5: dhcb, dh lance, and the 3 dragon shields. Am I missing something else? 
---
C
---
Jusr dont be mid level 4head
---
Mini reeeee?
---
They're ok to cannon at lower levels before you get 65 for Dust Devils I believe. There's also some method involving using 2 alts to lure them into a stack and Barrage but it's not worth doing IMO because it's too much effort and in my experience it's too difficult to get the free spot in catacombs anyways, similar issue to Abyssal Demons.
---
Shit I’m not gonna look at them the same now, thanks 
---
i encounter at least 10 zulrah bots literally every time i go do zulrah lol
---
it's funny how they don't get instantly banned because it's so easy to tell. mage levels above 75, and defense levels usually. everything else is completely subpar and they have like 25 ranged.
---
That’s literally an extra 100k+ per task 
---
Hope your hands were warm when you tried to take them off 
---
oh gee 5k cooking xp in an hour.. cmon bro smell the coffee.. only thing semi nice about it is the hunter xp..  
---
Every single reward from hard contract averaged around 130k.
---
He’s talking about Hespori seeds.
---
It's not exactly a game that was designed to be played in it's entirety, at least not by the majority of it's player base. That's actually sort of why trading exists. 
---
Is this a marathon??
---
If you had a sandwich kink, what kind of sandwich would be the kinkiest?
---
The right one but i just started again. Will be maxed come spring
---
RS3 42 roleplay was once a pretty thriving thing, but it was ruined by lack of consideration for rules and poor leadership/representation. A total bellend holds the guide sticky thread (the guide holder tends to be the symbolic 'figurehead' of the community), and all the good rpers and groups have grown up and left, and it's just a husk of what it once was. 
---
Impossible is a pretty heavy stretch mate I've played forever with 300+ ping is it harder yes is it impossible not even close 
---
Weird dds flex but okay. 
---
I belive you cant unless you have done it before, atleast so it is for inferno
---
Farming guild is amazing, the contracts are easily filling the tree seed void left behind by the birdhouse nerf
---
It's not unwarranted but it is bandwagling. 
---
He said wilderness though. I'm well aware of animation stall lures so always have a teleport and food on you is probably recommended 
---
Expeditious bracelets. 
---
Yeah I’m sure for PvM but PvP (which is why I play tbh) you’re at an unreal disadvantage when you can’t 1 tick etc ah well I’ll just 10 tick it all

Gotta throw away the whole existence now smh
---
if you couldnt afford hasta or maul for tek id bring a whip for team raid tek
---
It should be like the shield walls you phase through by rune dragons. Probably not super fitting thematically but it would work..
---
OSRS looks way better than RS3.
---
Some of the new armors (Ironman,Obsidian Helm) look like they belong in rs3 though ill give ya that. Shits fugly.
---
Honestly make it drop construction supplies. Skillers dont benefit from the creation of planks, and they're stupid expensive 
---
Thought that was sort of why diaries exist too, so people not interested in max still go high up in their skills.
---
  
---
I'd like something for non-combat content with serious GP gain with high reqs. So people uninterested in combat have an endgame too.
---
Even Speedwagon is afraid
---
Ferocious gloves and void? Gl with that pal.

How many time's have you earned that extra per task?

Shut

The character models scare me. Theres something off about them. 
---
Ooo that’s interesting. I don’t think so because it’s combat related but not sure on that. 
---
Lol that’s funny
---
Do away with all Skilling and have a new skill called manufacturing only high level players have access too, low levels earn gp based on efficiency for items set by owners, material costs subsidised too. Boom just solved your botting problem and OP prices.
---
Literally who
---
3 dose to 1 restore. You do 3:1 because after 3 brew doses, 1 restore dose won’t restore you fully. But yes you do it the way you said. 
---
Use to be really active back in the day but now....well past few years every time I come back and give it a try and I always feel let down.
---
There are some unintended mechanics like Prayer Flicking and Tick Manipulation that they know about and allow. They may not always be a fan of them, but often times it is either more trouble than it is worth or can't be fixed without bigger impacts to the game. With Prayer Flicking, they could change it, but the change would have a wider impact and affect normal usage too.
---
Also, there usually isn't unanimous agreement on whether they should change it; both within the community and internally. While it is a bit exploitative, it does also add a layer of skill and has lead to a lot of neat tactics.
---
My bad meant max strength salve new gloves and lance  :)
---
When a new item comes out the mods guess and set a price in the GE.  Because it is new the seeds are in demand and short supply.  Everyone is bidding on the GE to get some seeds for contracts or to try them out, and people are merching them at the same time.
---
The GE price is usually close to the actual price, but it will be inaccurate if the actual price changes rapidly for any reason.  The GE price changes about once a day for a maximum of 5%.
---
Some 3rd party sites monitor actual prices.
---
1 - 3?
---
Clearly minus 2.
---
I mean you said this is the hydra table right? Go kill the boss. Not my fault you’re wasting time killing baby hydras.

Literally every skill can make good money 🤔

Up it to 2,3m and i'll vote yes.
---
This just in: doctors, physicists, mathematicians, and writers are no longer skilled professions. 
---
5.5m gp/h, now that's;
---
26,5 hours worth of agility (Ardy) (at 99 agility)
---
12,1 hours worth of blast mining. (at 99 mining)
---
3,9 hours worth of crafting death runes. (at 99 runecraft)
---
3,2 hours of catching black chins (3t, tick perfect, assuming you don't get pked at 99 hunter)
---
Coming up next: rockslugs 
---
fun fact: I had to do 3 trips to Seers Village to bank everything
---
Could camp Wyverns/gargs/kurasks for a bit until you have some starting cash. Or konar Slayer master pretty worth. Get your mage to 75 and can do barrows pretty well. 
---
op is just mad his grandma got 92 mining before him.
---
Yo the disappointment in her face is fucking priceless
---
I got you bro!
---
Not funny😋
---
Whoosh 
---
skilling need to give exclusive items, like how bosses/npc have signature drops. that's about it.
---
The d spear is just regular rdt, nothing to do with konar.
---
Not so far, appreciate the support.
---
Nmz? Dusties?
---
I loved the way rs3 took this story, with the cool new world in Land of the Goblins, awesome goblin battle stories in The Chosen Commander, and then a somber end in The Mighty Fall, eventually for her to return to help fight the Nomad. If there's one thing I've always felt rs3 did right, it's the amazing storylines that I think the osrs team is too hesitant to follow. 
---
Haha, everyone showing up to their door
---
Hopefully. I know a guy who plays from Hong Kong and lags like crazy.
---
I realise that, it’s just a joke 
---
but he pre lures it before lightning. your method is just more work
---
accuracy doesnt really matter, dps does. hitting 57s vs hitting 55s is a big dps difference. for scythe its a max hit on all 3 hitsplats too iirc.
---
Have it set up to a GPS app like pokemon go does for adventure sync but like every mile is 1 coin and 5 coins = 1 xp and maybe like a 100 coins= 110xp? Trade them in at some npc in members to redeem rewards.
---
Something like this might promote more mobile players
---
That's probably because Konar specifically assigned Lizardmen, not Lizardman shamans. I've gotten shamans from Konar and the task specifically listed Lizardman Shamans in the caves.
---
Why are you in bed with your grandma? 
---
i say we let herbs and potions get devalued a bit and keep noted herbs on the drop table anyways
---
no way bro i'm more than halfway to max stats
---
Yeah, skilling is so optimized now compared to pre-2007 runescape. When you know the exact steps to get to 99 I think it makes it easier for people to achieve...
---
Nephew
---
You... do realize he bought bonds right? 
---
because then doing slayer before you can afford cannon/sgs/guthans/10-14 prayer potions per task would be a living hell

thanks bro im tryin so hard to get better but im not finding that many great places T\_T

Anybody know of any Runelite Text to speech plugins?

I've seen videos of people who have modified RuneLite to have all chat read by randomized text to speech voices.

Why not do Apple Trees instead of Papayas? Same chance, but about 1/5th the cost. Also do Calqs and Mahoganys as well, and if you've got any Spirits those are great too. 
---
he tried his best bless him
---
Cop the cannon quick time you still profit on task and will be done in an hour
---
Haven't done it but I would assume you just remove the current authenticator (need email access) and then setup it again with the new phone
---
you made about 130m off 150 kills? wtf
---
I'm having trouble getting no mouse movement oak dungeon doors to work and I'm pretty sure it's my connection being a little slow.
---
I can get a good cycle going this way: demon butler arrives with planks. I remove the oak door. Then I click on the demon butler to send him to get more planks. I build the first oak door then remove it. I then build the second oak door. Process repeats.
---
With this method, I give myself some time by doing a door removal while the demon butler is next to me so theres less I have to do while hes away getting planks.
---
However from my understanding, the tick perfect method goes like this: demon butler arrives with planks. Immediately send the demon butler away. Remove the door. Build first door. Remove first door. Build second door. Repeat.
---
The first cycle works fine, but I can't get the second one to work. All of the options to send the demon butler away and build the oak door take too long to pop up. I think it's connection because sometimes the process does speed up a little, and I think if this faster speed was consistent I could do the second method. But it's far from consistent enough to sustain.
---
Has anyone else had similar issues? I just thought I would ask in case it isn't just my connection and I'm actually just making a mistake. 
---
405 kc with claw and 2 leathers, wipe my tears with my gp.

Question: Does the boss level scale on the players’ combat level?
---
Literally unplayable
---
This. 
---
Me too! I wish it had slayer task style rewards for contracts done in a row, could be cashed in for tree seeds or whatever. 
---
Sometimes. Groupthink gets toxic. You’re getting downvoted because the people heavily invested in their sense of belonging to this space don’t want to have to question their investment; it makes things more uncomfortable. No sense in overreacting to that, it happens in all communities. Just keep your engagement light and lead by example. Cussing them out doesn’t change anything, it just embellishes toxicity.
---
If you pick up the decent loot you’ll break even. And I averaged around 80k-100k xp, depending on how efficient I was being. I just afked them so I wasn’t always paying attention. 
---
Did not use bone crusher. My gear: slayer helm (or facemask), vestment robes, ancient staff, occult necklace, god book. Lure them with steel darts and pray melee. There’s some guides on YouTube on how to stack them.
---
Wtf you mean 6m lol? Or is this sarcasm? Either way I’m intrigued.
---
Make some friends that will do it with you when you aren't a max efficient bot
---
Why are people saying BP? They count as dragons...DHCB shreds them.
---
Either you get it or you dont 🤷‍♂️
---
If you were a Oldschooler, you would be agreeing with me.
---
That's how I learned to NH 3 years ago lmao 
---
Speaking of, has a meta emerged yet for how to get the hespori seeds more regularly? I've gotten only one so far and I do herb/limp runs fairly regularly. Wondering if allotments would be good since they yield a lot
---
Too much loot for ya donate it to those who don’t hit the drop table. 
---
&gt;Jagex said from day 1 the game isn't designed around ironmen
---
You forgot to block out your name on the skotos drop 
---
Nothing is good compared to top PvM. I was talking in terms of woodcutting.
---
Lol sit kid
---
Mid is roughly like 80-110 I think.
---
I see where you are coming from. The table was insanely good for populating dead areas of the game and rewarding players with insane rewards on a rare drop table. But in my opinion I’m all for making skilling supplies come from skilling. 
---
And not to say to go as far to remove shops that sell items that require a certain skill level to make but keep what is there for skilling profitable and not throw it all towards slayer or killing a boss to obtain things. Some players like to grind skills and should be rewarded for it just like the players that like to kill things for rewards. 
---
There just needs to be a balance that can make both sides happy. Sadly I don’t know if there is one. 
---
Probly cuz he is autistic

I’m 90 mage and ranged, Zulrah is the only thing standing between me and the completion of western hard diaries.

is this a harry potter reference?

raids 2? explain pls
---
WTF Yagex
---
RunescapeGO. Add in a randomly occurring drop table that increases its rate at rolling a rare that you can pick up according to how fast you’re going, with a chance at unique pets that are continent specific. Marks of grace every few thousand exp that pop into your inventory.
---
I’m being facetious. Don’t do any of that.
---
Lmao the two dudes above sound so salty 
---
Lmao imagine 3-ticking sober 
---
Plz do hellhound loot
---
Homie, this isn't dealing with it. 
---
This; keeping up dps this way is easier the closer you get to max but crucial nonetheless.
---
Dhcb is pretty damn good at wyrms. I’ve just been using Zammy hasta though because I’m already max ranged.
---
Tbf, mid level players aren't gonna have 95 slayer for the hydra boss lol
---
Lmao this lure is fucking so old months old holy shit. How did he managed to fall for this crap
---
Really? I almost exclusively play rs3 and never really had an issue. Any particular thing that seems..."off?"
---
Op wants to feel better about his miserable life
---
Jamflex need to hire this guy

Are you on mobile?

Or the people just think that his opinion in this case is stupid.

i just unlocked palm trees but they're like 5 times more expensive than papaya trees ..wouldn't call fruit trees super cheap

Spec them out with a dark bow. They'll never see that coming.
---
How many reddit accounts you gonna post this on?
---
There were 20k open beta slots available a few months ago and I got in. It was first come, first serve on the website.
---
What? The game was intended to be a mixture of both, I enjoy my fair share of PvM but I'd like to see a change to skilling to make it more profitable if you put effort into it.
---
It's been done
---
Hey look its me in chat
---
just seems weird to nerf revenants and then nerf birdhouses because of brews and hten add 2500 brews as a drop
---
€11,-
---
FYI get extended antifire pots, way better.
---
Zanik Rule 34
---
still counts as exercise i guess. 
---
Did he wake up or did he die
---
That would make ags drop to zgs price, everyone would just claw gmaul instead so wouldn't fix shit. 
---
Can anyone help me get it running in my cars computer I'm pretty sur I can load apks to it
---
No shit... but why? I thought it was just due to Christmas vacation. But that is over and the servers are still so damn crowded. 
---
honestly this new slayer master is dead content
---
Not only did we get a boss with shit tier drops, the slayer tasks are awful as well
---
Just skip task, if you wanted to be able to choose where your task is go to another slayer master whos literal design isnt location specific kills for loot/bonus points.
---
Not really. 
---
How is cutting maples more effort than wyverns/gargs? Click a tree, click the bank.
---
Theres no watching supplies, looting drops, alching stuff, resetting aggro (gargs). Gargs/wyverns arent actually intensive or difficult but they sure as hell are more effort than woodcutting
---
Yeah I agree, I think the dhcb will be better in the majority of situations atm.
---
Right-click your high-alchemy spell in the spellbook. That should allow you to change the value and toggle the untradeable warning.
---
The point of konar is that you have to kill them where she tells you to kill them. If you dont like it, use any other slayer master.
---
It wasn't possible because you have to be logged in to see things appear that are dropped. So either you were already logged in to both accounts and this was after the time they removed the limit on logging into the same world with same IP or you were using two different computers or you're making this up. 
---
Hey you’re in my clan I remember you saying you were almost 99slay and maxed 
---
A little behind on the recent news. What’s all the drama about?
---
Yer a wizard Harry! Thanks!

When you don't get drakes enough to make a meme about how common they are so you task yourself
---
Accurate 
---
fuck off wanker
---
You’ve just pointed out the point of construction... it was designed as a gold sink
---
I've recently started vorkath, I have a dhcb, what should be my first upgrade?
---
Rigour or max house? I could sell some stuff for the extra cash for rigour 
---
Armadyl hilt at 73 kc would be the ultimate meme but gz anyway
---
Absolute gold.
---
Plenty of skills that would be the case, definitely not crafting. Gathering crafting supplies basically gives no XP or just combat XP. Every method at one point or another of gathering crafting supplies has been a staple botting source. 
---
I'm "biased", yet you believe so firmly that me getting 86k from Konar per task if too much. Interesting.
---
I'm talking about money per task, not per hour, so I don't get what you're getting from jerking yourself off about efficiency, but I'll prove you wrong anyway. First, I use blowpipe to train Slayer, costing about 380k an hour to maintain. I use roughly 800-1k cannonballs on a cannonable task. Suqahs, Trolls, Kalphites, Hellhounds, Fire Giants, Bloodveld, and Dagannoth. That's about 180k on cannonballs. Of these tasks, I'll use prayer for Suqahs, Trolls, and Dagannoth - about half of them. I'll use 3-5 prayer potions. That's another 40k. If I spend half an hour cannoning tasks with a blowpipe, I'm spending about 400k to do one of these tasks, with the only ones that can pay for themselves being Trolls and possibly Dags if I get lucky with seed drops. 
---
I'm not complaining or anything, it costs money to do things the fastest way and I'm perfectly fine with that. I choose to spend this money, it's my own problem. I just don't get how you believe that Zulrah scales and cannonballs are free and that the only way I could have an expense for training Slayer is for me to have both thumbs up my ass while I'm playing. After all, I'm choosing to train efficiently, which you like to think you know so much about.
---
trimmed in invo b4 u dropped it dropped and it trimmed?
---
Honestly, I practiced with an rs3 simulator as they both have the same-ish attack looks.
---
Most people say to listen to sounds but I found it best as visual. Leans back far=mage and half lean and slam=range. Good luck
---
Never too early to learn how to keep DPS up. Makes you prime for sniping loots at Cox and tob when you're ready. 
---
Stop bots and without any updates skilling will be profitable as it is...
---
How can you not see that game is flooded with resources thanks to bots, no pvm update ever has ruined skilling as much as bots...
---
If skilling was equally or more profitable than pvning, bots would double or way more so it's back to square one 
---
Imo it looks great but the run animation is just stupid.
---
There’s a list on the wiki that shows the assignable tasks per difficulty, just search for “farming contract”.
---
The thing is ranged comes with a considerable advantage by default, the only way to balance the fact melee has less mobility, unable to attack from a distance and be safe, takes more damage etc is to make it do at least the same damage.
---
Of course they arent going to nerf everything so that isnt a viable strategy, but keeping it at 20% (and it should stay at 20% in raids if they do buff it to 30% in general) would mean its basically not even viable at Hydra, its still probably 3rd behind BP at Vork, DHCB is still way better on brutals and most other regular dragonkin mobs, better at KBD etc. Right now its niche would be as a weapon for your rune dragon alt which is such a small part of the game and like I said something used mostly by alts and rightfully be really good on a single boss across both raids in Olm. That doesnt seem really fair, and  definitely makes it an underwhelming weapon. Unless theyre going to nerf BP or something (which more than likely wont happen) lance will gradually lose value and be used less and less outside of those 2 things and people will continue to use a 6m ranged weapon on all the things its supposed to be better at and isnt.
---
Using all 8 patches and with 99 farming so YMMV.
---
Dude just don’t die, ez
---
This is how we get RS3. I'm honestly seeing a worrying amount of these kinds of comments now, they even get upvoted too.
---
Ok so why can't I just take a mole skin and multiply it with a knife? Shut up, Serene.

Sulliceps is okay I found. Better xp than willows (about 80k vs 50-55) and I earned about 100k from selling numulite in the first hour I spent there.
---
Not a bad pun, cod do better though.
---
Boss heads alch for 30k. If this were the case I would absolutely bring alchs and make an extra 30k a kill
---
Cant remember the last time i saw someone there tbh
---
There's a minor caveat in that if they are playing on Mobile, there isn't any way to get the mouseover information in-game.  
---
 If this is the case, then checking the wiki page for the weapon you are currently using is the second-best option for finding out details on your weapon attack styles.

Talk to the guild master just behind the entrance.

Don’t spoil the surprise, it’s more exciting if we don’t know what’s next.

Step 1 take out items. 
---
Step 2 switch to free to play world with a high skill cap and run to the obilisk. 
---
Step 3 switch back to a members world and charge those bad boys up then switch back to f2p. 
---
Step four run to level &gt; 30 wildy. 
---
Step 5 switch back to members and Tele out.

There's only one P2P aussie world in the 400 bracket and it has the same amount if players as the other worlds I believe.

Serene is a genius. Hating him is a meme. Deep down we all adore him.

If you have dhcb you won't be needing the ornate pool as much, so I'd say get rigour first.

Were you on PC or mobile? It’s easier on PC I find. When on mobile I found it really hard with even jist one person in the same area as me.

This is why i try to only use 2k worlds. I have yet to be crashed by a high lvl player, only low levels.

Not that big of a difference. Really don't need to plant it. Not that good.

one of them (424) is members and it has the same population
---
Duh m8
---
Shut up serene
---
higher skill ceiling
---
Why dont you credit the guy who suggested this few months back? 
---
True, but at the same time the drop rate of each individual herb drop from konar was 1/6000 from high end creatures like hydras.
---
I think if instead of dropping fucktons at once very rarely she instead gave a chance of getting a bonus ranarr every 1/45 kills from high end enemies it'd be fine. The actual rate coming in was not an issue, it was just that it looks absurd to get 200 noted herbs at once.
---
Is this a remake of Black Mirror ep.1?
---
And now so are your peaches
---
&gt; and a lot of NPCs would yell out "300m drop in the party room in 10 minutes!

Back in the day in Cammy's party room, these bankers didn't announce a thing afaik. The greater performance.

These titles sound like they're for 8 year olds.

There's no proof the bandwagon effect has an impact on Runescape polls.

Literally unplayable

Shut up serene 
---
Very nicely put.
---
So slayer isn't a skill? Plus slayer/pvm bots are more complicated and I believe that there are only paid ones thus decreasing users using it... 
---
Bring an alt to protect yourself. Although if you've got an alt, air orbs wouldn't exactly be the optimal approach

Which makes perfect sense. See my explanation: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/abuehk/addy_med_helm/ed5cnpb/

pretty much they use overhead protects

This is just stupid and untrue.

world hopping for things like that is definitely allowed and very common. its the only way to make decent money with runite rocks.
---
however if xp is your goal then just mine iron ores, there are many places you can find several close together, so theres always one up and no need for hopping (or even moving).
---
That's pretty neat
---
No probs
---
Can safely say I would've preferred I didn't. Knowing I got a 1/32k drop and it could've happened anywhere else with any other item wasn't worth 1.2m.
---
Are you dumb? Wc, mining and fishing as a few examples used to be viable money making methods for high and low levels alike. It's now so slow gp you only really do it for the xp. Doesn't feel very oldschool, and that's why people are complaining. If you still can't see the sense in this argument then idk what else I can say to you.

Block the user
---
I understand that, but as I said until Jagex can stop the bots, there is no point as it will be botted the hell out of and from the research I've done, non combat bots/scripts  are more commonly available than combat ones plus there are ton of free skilling scripts.
---
By all fairness I have nothing against love for skilling, it's just that it won't matter profit wise. Actually it may even do more harm than good. Well a lot of players are actually in here for the short term profit... True new skilling content will give us week or two of new and profitable content, then it will be botted af and if it involves other skills well those are going down as well...
---
Just think about it..
---
Pvm content doesn't destroy economy as much as skilling content thanks to bots. 
---
Mine will be ready at work, is it easy enough for mobile or should I wait to get home? I have good stats cmb 116

False. You should be calling out every user on this sub with that mindset. Hypocrite!

OSBuddy isn't open-source, so nobody here can say for sure.

RuneLite is another option. It's open-source, but you'll either have to look at the code yourself or take other's word that it's safe.

People who play once a week are the people that ruin my game. These people suggested afl rcing and more herb patches. The reason why this game is twice as easy as 5 years ago is beceause of you.

Kinda wondering how long it took you to collect them and why hahaha
---
Its a catch-22 sort of thing. 
---
If they buff skilling then they're buffing botting. 
---
Did you open the casket in the G.E for extra RNG?
---
Drakes need serious buff, theyre fun to kill and look awesome but the drop table is horrible
---
not true how? When was the last deep wilderness update you saw? Because right now? PvP is abused by Jagex and not given really any updates. This games catered to PvM and skilling.
---
Wouldn't ever listen to some sort of fools lmfao

Do Wintertodt to get some crates and items, if you have nothing at all.

Work on your ability to analyze comments and texts. My post does 100% reflect reality and the situation. Blinded sheep at its peak!

As  i said before lance is a 1 in about 1k kills drop based on woox clan 10.5k  kill drop table. Its not a rare item. cba to talk about same crap multiple times if u cant get it through your thick skull why its bad and wrong for it to have 30%. Youre one of the people the reason rs3 is trash.

from a pure efficiency standpoint you should wait until higher lvls to start training slayer, but if you are like me i found it way more fun to just level up my combat with slayer as i liked the variety instead of just grinding rock crabs or something till high lvl
---
It's not botting if someone else is manually playing. With that said, you won't come far if you're account sharing. You won't ever see any advanced character who's account shared. Those are outliers.

But if you use it to compete on the highscores (rare), you'll be permed.

Zulrah has them on her drop table
---
Really? Sorry then i checked your post history to make sure must of missed it my bad. But great idea! Why didn't you include the max cape version to this? 
---
And are now partway through fixing it again. Taking all the ore drops off monster tables has been amazing for the health of mining. 
---
The main objective with konar was to give incentive to do slayer outside of the best locations using her drop table. She was made specifically to fight this and then they nerfed her so now everyone is back to doing slayer in the same spots.
---
That's great to hear! I was told that I shouldn't, but now I'm glad to hear that its alright!
---
?? There is Skilling which isnt afk the fuck are you on about
---
Serene, this argument clashes with the first one you presented here. If you're aware of the fact that its arbitrary code and not physically based, why would you make a physically based argument? You can't have it both ways. Clearly, this one Claw and three Skin drop rate was based off off in-game economic reasons, with little-no weighting on physical sensibility. You played yourself, fool.  
---
That'd be pretty cool.

If you take 2 steps/tick (brisk walk?) that would be about 26 million steps to 99, with over 90 days of straight walking covering almost 2,000km (so, not the most efficient method...)

According to Runelite xp tracker i habe 900 hydra to kill until 99 slayer which will mean max cape for me too, gzz man

And yet he still has no hat, yes I’m still salty 
---
Yoinked from r/pewdiepiesubmissions
---
That’s because profitable slayer has high requirements while the profitable skilling that exists doesn’t. Doesn’t mean you can’t change that.
---
Why did you write numbers for every step except 4? 
---
Did you figure out how you were hacked? I think that's the bigger problem here; nothing is stopping those hackers from coming back.
---
I recently re-started playing and I realise that I'm continually getting the black ["Connection lost" box](https://i.imgur.com/VzgH5zb.png) every few minutes. I don't think it's my internet as I'm also able to surf other sites and stream videos. Any idea what's wrong and what could solve this?
---
How'd you arrive at those numbers? Who's to say 816 isn't the limit? 
---
Also its more bank space they said requires a rework, not treasure chests etc
---
It is in game. 
---
Why doesn't it melt then while attached?
---
They made the right call to nerf it though? It was clearly over tuned and it’s better to nerf something like that soon than wait 2 years like they did with zulrah.
---
It's almost like over the years more and more visages have come into the game at a faster rate.
---
Guess what? The drop table is still great for low/mid leveled players! It just isn't as ridiculously broken as it was on launch.
---
The ability to move when using items on the compost bin such as pineapples or coconuts. (but thats with all them in game only this one you can have more items). 
---
How some people have this much time to spend I can't understand
---
lol and people were saying that Hydra isn't worth killing.
---
Most efficient people won’t raid with an ironmeme but Ironman are more than welcome in learners and standards. You don’t need an alt to split but it helps. There’s also a channel dedicated to iron and ffa raids
---
Replace the gates with something else, closer (in mechanics) to what is at rune dragons, so more than one person can pass at the same time.
---
All about the pet, sire is just as bad tbh.
---
Hahah, so fucking true, ain't it?
---
Would get nerfed when streamers complain about it anyway. 
---
This is honestly why I can’t keep up with the game. Wtf is a KDT now?
---
Do new slayer master- Konar 
---
Before you claim it is completely dead and irrelevant, why dont you stand in front of konar for 10 minutes and see how many people are still doing konar slayer.
---
If this amount of people are still willing to do the same content after a 30% nerf, its likely that the nerf was warranted.
---
If konar was released with its current drop table, no one would be bitching about how underpowered it is, and the same noobs that want to do low level slayer and make some gp rather than no gp would still be using it.
---

Meaning what exactly? He enjoys a huge part of the game? How is that a problem. I'm the same, always preferred skilling since 2007. 
---
Damn at 93 slay I had like 2k gorillas killed man. Just did all of my black demons tasks there
---
My PB with BiS gear (except for tbow) and 99 ranged is 2:15
---
&gt;This new slayer master was meant for low/mid levels to build up some nice bank value while training their skills transitioning slowly into high level account.
---
That is false. The Slayer Master was meant to give more variety in Slayer for players who didn't want to Cannon and Barrage everything. The focus was always more points and the drop table was only meant to be a slight profit increase. On top of that, Konar isn't even good or designed for low levels.
---
&gt;This game should be not catered to ironman.
---
There is a difference between catering to ironmen and balancing the game. If you had a choice of getting 100K in Raw Sharks or 100K in coins, which you prefer? It really shouldn't matter to you if you aren't an ironman since 100K is 100K regardless of the form it is in. But to Ironmen, coins vs sharks is a big difference. And to the market, coins vs sharks is also a big difference. It is more than just an ironman issue; it is balance issue. They didn't remove Raw Sharks from Zulrah because of Ironman; they removed it because it was damaging to the health of the game. Doing the same thing from Slayer is even worse.
---
So don't act like it is just a few posts on Reddit who hate Konar; this is something Jagex has been working on for years. They slipped up here and were called out on it, so they choose to fix it. And if you actually think Konar is dead content because of a small nerf to its drop table, then it was always meant to be dead content since it wasn't supposed to make this much to begin with.
---
I'm not sure tbh. Would have to test that out
---
In univeristy the exams start right after winter break. In highschool we have exames right before  winter break. 
---
They don’t. They just pretend to. You see it all the time in society. People pretend to care about something because it’s the morally “cool” thing to do, but in practice they don’t do anything to actually fix what they care about and often just perpetuate the problem.
---
You don’t care if you want PVM’s profit to continue to increase while skilling doesn’t.
---
Interesting how people whined about Konar drop table being op when you get a shit ton of high value seeds each time you complete a contract.
---
Cool thanks
---
Here’s my word of advice... if something here bugs or offends you, it generally isn’t a good idea to bring it up or call out the hive. This sub has a history of crucifying white knights.

---
we get it, you're an ironman.
---
In all seriousness, most of the seeds that you get are pretty useless with the odd chance to get something of value. 
---
It’s okay, I’m at over 1100 vorkath kills and my best drop is a drop bone necklace...5 Times -____-
---
Is it normal to be getting like 11k xp/hr in slayer at lvl 50 (doing new girl hellhound task). Feels... really low. 
---
Lance effect doesn't work on dummies, sadly. 
---
Not sure if you're wondering about osrs or wow but here the new slayer master has a special drop table when you receive a task from her. The table was nerfed one day after release. One side is arguing that the table was too OP and needed the nerf while the other is saying that it's dead content now.
---
Games progress, nothing you can do about it. OSRS is a seperate game, so it's only logical you have to train your stats again to be fair
---
The bot argument doesn’t fucking make any sense man. Anything can be botted. What determines whether or not something is botted is its requirements. If the requirements are high then it doesn’t get botted because the accounts will get banned before getting there.
---
Stop using that stupid and wrong argument. It’s 100% incorrect.
---
Opposite for us

Damn

Only problem is overcrowding on the Intelligence task

Shut up... Oh wait it's not Serene

I'll try it later when I get the chance, I can let you know what happens if you're interested 
---
It's such a simple idea and yet so powerful. It's clearly on Jagexs radar so I hope osrs will start to implement it too.

If you are doing contracts for profit, do not do any of the contracts that require 100k+ seeds. Instead ask for an easier contract. Even doing hard contracts, most of my boxes have not had more than 100k in them.

I got about 18 kc but yeh I do like that pet so I’ll give you a race. Add me in game “R4nked”

---
Normally I'd agree, but as it's rather new content and not many people know much about it, I wanted to give a run down of the guild itself for a few minutes first. There's a timestamp at the start of the video to jump straight to the loot - I personally think I handled it well :)
---
Nah, rp was still thriving for a while after EOC on rs3. 2014 was the last year of growth before the gradual decline began, and since then it's been activity spikes that last a few months then die
---
I'm interested in this update
---
Your link refers to bots created over the weekend where jagex staff aren't doing ban waves. This isn't a new thing, so we can compare what has happened in the past by looking at the ge price chart for cannonballs.
---
The price chart doesn't show any significant correlation between the day of the week and the price of cannonballs, so it's safe to say that the suicide bots getting banned wont have a noticeable effect.
---
In addition, looking at the 6 month price graph, the price has been trending downwards overall. There is the occasional spike, which I would expect was due to updates at the time.
---
So if your friend wants to sell the cannonballs for profit, They can either wait for a spiek in the price, which will likely happen as the result of some pve update - whch could take a few months or more to happen. Otherwise it's better to just sell right away.
---
People want xp. They place value on that xp, so they are willing to pay for it. 
---
you can make a profit using prayer pots in pvm
---
They should add a notification when you get a drop from a slayer monster that states if you got it from the regular drop table or from the global loot table.
---
The point of training skills doesn’t always have to be profit
---
100 agree! But your have pvmer lose their mind, as you don't get a 1 mil drops right away. 
---
I made a profit on making prayer pots 3 days ago made a little over 1k of them decanted and sold for around 230k profit so it’s kind of just depending on the day and what the flavor of the week is. 
---
 No elite clue ? Seems weird tbh 
---
isnt making unfinished potions profitable?
---
if you can motivate people to exercise when they otherwise wouldn't, then you don't put a limit on that, already not a limit as small as that one (and even that is only necessary due to inaccuracies in pedometers)
---
And as a consequence of using overhead prayers, you typically switch between the three attack styles for each attack to counter the enemies overhead prayers. Makes for very fast paced and technical combat.

This was the other instance of someone having the issue that I can recall
---
The last three look good but you're missing a few steps in the first rotation
---
Did you miss the hands at the bottom?
---
Now you can actually play the game
---
So what you’re saying is there’s absolutely no point to skilling unless you need a skill requirement to fight a boss?
---
This is such a flawed argument... there’s an entire community of people (including myself) who greatly prefer skilling over PvM. I find skilling to be relaxing and enjoyable and PvM just doesn’t do that for me. Why is it that I will forever be (relatively) poor because I don’t want to fight Vorkath or Zulrah for hundreds of hours? Why do I have to do things I don’t enjoy to have a chance at this game?
---
Look, I completely understand how raids 1&amp;2 are the best money makers in the game. That’s a no brainer and it is common within MMOs that the highest level content provides the most profit. I actually look forward to doing those things, myself. To make some boss like Zulrah that is purely there for people to farm and has no real tie-in to the game is just ridiculous. Zulrah is the epitome of pandering to the PvM audience. People who don’t want to cut trees or farm tubes because they find it boring, complain until they’re given something like zulrah. Something just as brain dead (once you learn it) as cutting trees or runecrafting.
---
Tl;dr it just doesn’t seem fair that if you don’t like PvM and prefer skilling, you have to just accept that you’ll always be relatively poor.
---
Uh, blood runes were only 220gp this time last year... So were death runes...
---
So before you start complaining to Jagex actually look at a graph longer than a week.
---
Yeah, you're actually right, serene! After watching this I went and donated him a thousand bucks plus a little extra for a couple dinners! Hope he does well! 
---
Yeah like the other person said they're dust runes. Its nice for home teles, one dust, one law
---
Jesus, what Kurasks and Gargoyles are you killing? Each of them tops off in profit at around 600k/hr. I’ve farmed thousands of each. Konar’s update buffed it by about 100k/hr day of, might be less now. Drakes are more comparable to Wyverns if you collect all of the loot. If you blowpipe/cannon/rigour it, the profits will be comparable to those two, but if you just melee it’s more money + a chance at uniques that go for well over 1.2m right now.
---
Just quit your job and move in with you nan fam
---
The "GE price" can only change by about 5% per day, so it sometimes lags behind reality, especially for new updates.
---
But don't you want to switch as close to the next attack as possible?
---
I honestly prefer the hung glory (I'm a size queen I guess)
---
having your POH be your one-stop teleport shop works nicely imo
---
 Uh, blood runes were only 200gp this time last year... And death runes were only 220gp...

50k xp/hr sounds pretty good to me.. I get like 20k unless I'm barraging. Ironman btw so cannoning is usually a bad idea.
---
Avantoes are really cheap right now
---
Yeah but it's absolutely garbage at lower levels. A combined 40-50k exp at 53 hunter and 76 fishing is God awful. Way too click intensive with little to no reward. 
---
Now serene is kink shaming. How insensitive to others!
---
Yeah they're my favorite addition in this update. It would be nice though if rewards scaled a bit better with what you're growing. It often doesn't really feel worth doing contracts that have you grow trees since in the time it takes for them to grow you could probably take an easier contract, complete it, and get a new difficult contract.

Not even $11.

Everything you said plus:

White knights need to stop acting like botting can't be dealt with. Even fucking CipSoft managed to get their shit together and do something about bots in Tibia, why can't Jagex?

Missed opportunity on my part. RIP.

---
It was BiS strength training (because the whip can’t directly train strength) until the Ghrazi Rapier which came out with ToB.
---
I’d love this tbh. Even if they wouldn’t give the best drops, it was always fun to try and pick a fight with them. Perhaps like you said there could be an additional chat option, or a right click. 
---
So for something like the Evil chicken it’d pop up and call you out. If you ignored him he’d leave on his own, or you could click to either tell him to go away or to take him up on his challenge 
---
Meh, I posted that before the drop table got nerfed. I won't be using her now.

Devalues my sit on my ass all day ironman
---
Same reason being able to add fairy wings to your character is bad.
---
He deleted the post. What should I be buying?
---
The idea is that you can talk to your friends but you can't teleport out. This (along with the very concept of random events) is a holdover from the days when we thought they were actually useful at catching bots.
---
Unless they have changed it you wont be able to get another piece. They limit you to 3 totem pieces at a time. After that you can no longer get drops. You'll have to either drop some or wait for a superior and then drop. 
---
A recolor?

He is a smelly loser.

Posts on literally every thread, and it's always some r/iamverysmart holier than thou bullshit, or a misplaced meme. Also thinks he's better than everyone so he refuses any criticism constructive or otherwise.

I used to wonder why the hate, too, but after seeing the same thing on every thread on this sub, I understood.
---
its reversed logic that Jagex often use example: nerf bird nest drop from bird houses, then add 2500 sara brews too rare loot table.
---
Right sub

and how is it with like allotment contracts like snape grass,

Then you just use house teleports all the time + having to run to wall as well.

Maple trees (45 farming) should not be a a hard contract (requires 85 farming)
---
I wouldn't mind arrows getting some perks to make them more useful, but I'd rather not just copy bolt effects but for arrows. I think it would be more interesting to explore more things like Fire arrows or such. Also, just like not all crossbows can fire gem-tipped bolts, we could make it so not all bows could fire special arrows (i.e. Twisted Bow).
---
Whoosh
---
Why is that? 
---
I think the convenience of not constantly having to switch out ammys in your bank or sell and buy ammys makes it worth it in the long run even if you don’t teleport with it more than maybe 2-3 times a day 
---
Nets cost like nothing, the game isn’t catered to iron men who need to collect and make nets
---
Normal loot is based on points. Theres a chart on that wiki page, “every x points is worth 1 of this item” so that level 3 with 0 points gets 1 of each 
---
can confirm am in his clan chat
---
Only with a quest that requires the corresponding construction level, as well as 91 agility.
---
Lol I'm with you brother. Don't worry these guys can make bank slaying a boss we can chip at this rock and make some real cash 👌
---
Sadly this has always been (and probably also will be) an issue in OSRS. Since most people play the game for efficiency nowadays new content will die out very quickly when it is not good in terms of GP or XP an hour. 
---
This issue can however be resolved when playing ironman mode because you need specific items from specific monsters. Sadly it will be continue to be a problem in the main game...
---
It’s not your cake day...
---
I feel like you didn't actually read my second point. Zulrah is not terribly hard after you learn it, and most people can learn it in like half an hour. Nat runes are obviously piss easy. The difference is that Nat runes are brain numbingly boring while Zulrah is at least slightly entertaining to do. It's *harder* for people to consistently do nat runes just because it's boring as fuck. It makes sense to force yourself to do something boring now for a greater reward later, not for a *lesser* reward. 
---
ahh yes getting 2 bones that are worth 4K and mystic staffs are lots of money !!
---
Most people here can't really do anything to help you. Your best bet is to go to the RS support site, click some options, and send a ticket in.
---
If you got banned for legitimate botting/macroing, I'd suggest not wasting your time as Jagex is pretty hard on that.
---
ye they look really ugly, mod west did a fucking horrible job on the new items. (incl lance, gloves)
---
It's just... Logic? If you make something worse, less people are going to buy it/use it. If you make something better, more people will. More people are playing than ever before, I remember 2014 when the average was something like 40k online. 
---
I know you're going to respond to this saying that I don't have some scientific study, say I'm wrong and declare victory. But just look at a graph of average online players going back to release.
---
This completely. Slayer takes long enough as it is + higher level monsters usually have mechanics that require pray switches + food + better gear to kill. Why am I gonna waste the gp on pots, food and upgrades if I can just skip the task (which the Devs have spent time creating a new monster) and wait for something which is easier to kill and gives better gp/ xp per hour.
---
If higher level monsters don't have any benefits most people will just sit at 75 slayer and farm gargoyles/ wyverns. 
---
It's a little bit like capitalist RuneScape where those who made money early on in the game expect everyone below them to stay poor and not get any benefits from the new updates.
---
Take a seat dear

Nfs. Keeping this bitch for use.

Is anyone else runelite client having touble connecting to update server?

I mean you said 128k xp every 5 minutes, which is like 1.4mexp per hour.

You can buy items from stores. Bots and determined players would basically ensure popular items would never be in-stock.
---
Who did this 
---
Are you deliberately missing my point just because you want to say something clever? My argument is about osrs in general. M3gan00b
---
I too am a 17 year vet and my opinion is also heavily weighted in this discussion and I think the PvM drop tables should all be nerfed so hard that even equipping a sword and attacking a mob becomes dead content. 
---
Think the reason why the gloves are untradable is to lock behind quest req, not necessarily to bind to account.

It wasn’t needed to the extent they nerfed it. The loss of time outweighs any form of reward for doing it.

It isn't reasonable serene. You can see it now because you're looking at it. If you were put in his shoes during the moment, you would not predict that a whole clan would log under him and that your next ice barrage would one hit yourself. That isn't something reasonable to think about. You could not attack him because he's a questionable character but then I'm sure this could be easily found in just about anyone you attack. And baits/lures can still happen with what seem like normal kills. So to call something like this a publicity stunt is just gross and an insult to him. There is no proof or any backup or credibility to point this to a publicity stunt, so you could easily make the claim that mammal getting lured out of a safe zone and skulling with bank on him is a publicity stunt as well. So no serene, it is not reasonable to try to claim this as a publicity stunt for something that happens to streamers. 
---
Lol that's what you get for botting
---
I know right, the amount is getting rather interesting. If you people need to grow some skin, I got green dragon hides for everyone in my bank.
---
Mining till 68, getting void, dragon slayer2, then vorkath
---
Not a sound argument.  Gear drops from mobs are the corresponding resources gathering type (combat).  Skilling drops based on level rewards you for having higher skills.
---
Sounds like osbot 
---
And Au Osrs didn't expect you to scam 1.5b but here we are
---
Looks like Anakin Skywalker pulling himself out of the lava in Revenge of the Sith😂
---
Yah, to an extent. But I think it is more of a view problem than a balance problem. It isn't a flaw if a Level 95 Creature doesn't make as much consistent profit as Gargs if it does offer better average profit and/or exp. But some players are so focused on consistent profit that they ignore the other factors and that kind of mindset is not healthy. Even efficiency can factor in averages...
---
Confirmed, works well when you're not retarded... Except for me, I dropped my entire Juul in my coffee.
---
Masterbation
---
Skilling needs to be made difficult/tedious if you want to make it profitable. Like how minnows crashed shark prices, despite them being very stable when they were on zulrah's drop table.
---
You know that it’s lesser points if you’re below 115 combat right? 
---
The fact that so few people got the joke is worrying
---
Your loss
---
I'd stick my phone on my dog for a day 
---
Or I realize I can do multiple other money makers and don't waste my time doing terrible xp tasks? I don't see what your point is.
---
If you’re doing max efficiency 50k is bad. Pretty sure you average like 80k per hour with 93 slayer, not sure what you’d get before 93

Have you slept since hydra came out?
---
They’ll be dead content soon, their drops are awful for the required level, the bones they drop are worse than what green dragons drop and they quite often drop nothing at all. They need to do one of two things; have more uses for their uniques or lower the quantity you receive of them. I agree that not every Slayer monster has to have insane GP P/H but currently there is barely any incentive to kill them. 
---
And I believe the only reason that Boots Of Brimstone have risen overnight is because Mr No Sleep made a video last night telling everyone they give ranged bonus as well as protection from the heat in the cave.
---
And currently the completion of the Zeah elite diary completely negates usage of one of their uniques. And who’s going to buy Devout boots?
---
Nobody said they were men, you sexist pig.

It was better :/

Not strictly true, check prices, some potions are occasionally profitable for the exact reason as top comment OP, Exp is a product and by buying unfinished potions its the herblore equivalent of spinning flax, minimal (or in potions case no) reward yo make an unfinished product that will give one exp to finish creating it. 
---
yay bots right?
---
Doesn't take away that 22.5 hours a day for 7 days straight is pretty much impossible.

my only issue is how contracts are rewarded. you get the same lootbox for doing a redwood tree or another high level contract like a poison ivy bush, so i always feel compelled to ask for an easier one if i get a tree of any kind

The problem is that isn't actually the case, the gride is different over time for everyone, I remember levelling up skills with no make x and tons of other things that make skilling soo much easier. It is about having a balance but over time the grind changes a lot.

I did tarromin tar to 77 then stamina from 77-90 costs about 35m but it's about 300k xp/hr

there's bots for zulrah and vorkath
---
In theory the catalysts would be a little cheaper than the actual resource, the difference in price between the catalyst and the resource will be  profit for the skiller, so even without an xp boost it'll be beneficial to have it in your inventory when skilling.

Besides, giving a 50% boost in xp to resource gathering skills is seriously op

Because a monster randomly having hundreds of metal ore in their pockets is perfectly realistic and medieval, right?

IDK how people can play like this. Slayer is my favorite skill by far. I could have been 99 a long time ago but I dont want to get to 99 cause im gonna feel lost lol. Making money via slayer is so enjoyable. Idk how people who arent like leaderboard players care about super efficient xp/hr so much. I enjoy doing zulrah/vork as well but I dont want to do the same shit over and over for money.

That's what I noticed too, if you only have an hour or two every day to play, youre basically always going to be broke in this game.  I don't want to spend my only hour or two a day of play time, simply running nature runes or doing something else relatively boring.  I'd rather be doing quests or something else fun.
---
I'm not even that low level of a player, 93cb, 75-80 cb skills, 71 slayer.  I feel like I'm at a point where I should be making good money through slayer, but these updates keep moving that threeshold further away.
---
On the same note, I really like Konar because I have to explore the game more to go do my slayer tasks instead of always going to the same 4-5 places.
---
Christ I didn't even realise this, 100 every 4 hours is dumb af. Atleast it's getting fixed soon
---
You have to complete 5 tasks before you start earning points.
---
The polls are there for a reason. Recent the quality and integrity have been compromised when jagex begins making changes without consent.
---
That's my point. Like if it was like 100 pearls for the fish sack that would be fine but the fact that you have to grind that much for a cosmetic item is a little ridiculous.
---
If you on mobile you can set your gp notification to 1gp,  it'll show all drops in the chat box
---
It depends to what degree it gets botted, since skilling is rather more safe so less risk. Like pvming would be more risky and as such scripts for those ar mostly premium and cost real money as such, thus less players are interested in paying for the risk of getting caught.
---
I'm not disagreeing with your statement of anything being bottable, rather to how.
---
For example you have motherlode mine or nmz for that matter, all of these methods are pretty afk and require less actions, thus script isn't that complex meaning its available to bigger masses. Abys rc or zulrah, requires more actions, script would have to be ready for more events thus making it complicated, which would translate in premium script, because script devs also invest time in those, and paid scripts are less used than the free ones...
---
Plus for jagex bot catching system it's easier to catch someone playing for suspiciously long and or on more action based activities using the same exact movement patterns as where less actions more afk skilking would draw less suspicion.

Wait, where is she(or he)? The thirst has left me with literally hours to live, and also I am in a similar financial situation to elementary schoolers.

Does RoW affect Konar drop table?

Reddit used to hate him too but when he quit it was like a famous artist dying and everyone pretended they like him and he was a visionary or some stupid shit.

People here are fucking sheep. 
---
Good if you're a 1 defence pure i guess
---
It's 5 mil if you slay 19k pyrefiends
---
Definitely a good update! 
---
I too would like to see farming contracts reworked.
---
I’d like a point system similar to Slayer, where each task grants X amount of points and those points can be put toward buying seeds, cosmetic items such as a wieldable watering can or rake, or more seed boxes. 
---
Also, the rewards should definitely be skewed depending on growth or requirement. Growing a Magic Tree just to get a 22k reward feels so, so bad. In the end it’ll even out because you can get an Ivy Seed for 200gp and get a 120k reward, but there should be a standard for growing hard contracts. 
---
Overall, love it. Hespori is great. Celastrus are interesting as well. I’ve grown 3 so far and received 2, 7, and 10 bark respectively. For the prices at the moment this isn’t worth it at all, but the experience is nice and eventually I can see the price plummeting to where this will be a break even method of farming trees. Dragonfruit look excellent! My redwood is almost grown and the stages have been pretty cool so far. 
---
The Anima seeds are very, very powerful. Skipping growth cycles on trees is amazing, and the Attas seed that produces more herbs has been great for a friend of mine, averaging 14-15 herbs per patch at 99. 
---
The doors are horrible, though. I’d love to see an agility shortcut type change where you need to have a certain farming level to navigate through vines blocking the section, or you need a certain farming level to dig up vines blocking the entrance to the respected levels and it’s a one time thing. 
---
Coif is op

Yeah I wish it felt like an accomplishment to go into a “Guild” of a certain skill. But I guess 32 cooking and a chefs hat is a great milestone for a runescape player...

ha!

It really ties the room together.

This post is a lie

This is only an unpopular opinion to RS3 arrivals, where SlayerScape isn't a meme it's a way of life. 
---
The same people concerned with higher XP updates should be the same ones not wanting higher GP updates either.

his power level has ascended even further beyond, able to use loli profile pics on twitter

You're using the wrong wiki.

This is hilarious 
---
I lost a zuk run after healers because I hit 0s for probably 7 minutes until I ran out of stam and died.  I had range pot, rigour, tbow, and 99 range.
---
Haven't been back since.
---
Not a friend for much longer
---
My loot from 170 was 5k air runes :)))))))))))))))))))))
---
Back to that bender steve for me
---
There's little incentive to chop magic trees as well, and it's probably fine.
---
Well yea, complextity of activity also adds to the difficulty of something being botted.
---
It comes down to accessibility and complexity. A simple no requirements 1m an hour activity (blast furnace) will be botted more heavily than a high requirement highly complex activity (zulrah).
---
My suggestion is to add new skilling content that is highly complex and has high requirements, but has high rewards.
---
Quest requirements are the best because if you make it a master quest, it often requires several quests, and several skills. These compound requirements make it really annoying for bots and makes them more likely to get caught.
---
I’m not suggesting we should buff fishing sharks to be 500k an hour.
---
In all seriousness, the correct approach would be a nerf to some pvm activities that are out of line, (Mostly the highest end stuff like vorkath, and the extremely afk yet stupidly profitable stuff) alongside a buff to some of the underperforming skills and introduction of new skilling methods as described above.
---
NIGGA IT'S A FUCKING ROCK LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
Runite dragons 
---
But those brews didn’t make up 100% of the drop table? Pretty sure it’s more of a 20-30% decrease over all 
---
Lets make the change 
---
We have what 6 different colors of mystics now lol
---
It's impossible to catch everything
---
Are you actually retarded?
---
Haven't ever run into any issues at the 1.75k ge. Pretty quiet usually
---
You have no idea what ocd is do you.
---
All he could afford at the time :(
---
I don’t think they’re worth botting really, too high of a slayer requirement and bad loot when bots already do Wyverns which are much better GP per hour
---
I do all that except for berries. I log out at the seaweed patch and do that religiously
---
God ash has an asshole made of runite, easily defends against lower tier weapons. 
---
I think a loot table should not be polled. Because the players will, in majority, vote for their benefit personally and not the benefit of the game as whole.
---
R.I.P to my 500 mole parts I turned in a few days ago
---
Blowpipe isn't always best option due to cost. 
---
thank you really appreciate that &lt;3 
---
Collection log released about a month ago. You can collect it from the museum collector upstairs in Varrock museum. 
---
Yeah it didn't need to be that way with gargs either but here we are because of that update all other must get pushed higher.  Slayer should have only ever made money on boss tasks or a small profit on non-boss tasks, not what we have currently.  But the updates have passed and sadly increasing gp/hr is the only thing the devs care about hence konars broken drop table before nerf. 
---
It's not a bad idea considering they're amazing money makers, if you could see yourself being able to handle doing a ton of bossing without other activities then I don't see why not.
---
You could always sell some of the BiS range gear when you're done.
---
Wrong. It also works on hops, grapes, and allotments.
---
Dude I got Vorkath Jar 4 times and long bone twice within 3k kills. Didn’t get a rare till 4k.
---
Nice try :)
---
This analyzation 👌🏼 
---
For profit?  You'll want an item you can sell in the grand exchange.  To find which item exactly is the most profitable, you'll have to make a spreadsheet with item value and points cost.  Then find the item with the highest gp/point value.  It should be relatively simple.
---
There’s no reason for drakes to be 1m an hour but it’s about 200k currently, not afk, and takes for fucking ever to complete. They should be fixing tasks that everyone skips not adding more 
---
Who's gonna pay for it? 
---
Dude your killing me right now!!!
---
But having a shop attendant that unnotes items for you next to rimmington POH isn't easyscape? 
---
You can go do Master farmer in Ardougne get him stuck and make 1-2m and hour . You can craft death tunes Nats . You can collect herbs every hour. Skillets are such a small portion of the community lol . I personally build my bank when I started with thieving. Then I did slayer till could do Zulrah and now I have TBow . It took me months and hours and hours to get that Bow to be able to make more money . PvM should and always be the best money maker . Just replace Konars drops with Op alchables. Like they bitch so much it’s not even funny.
---
I only did this activity for a short while to complete the diary. Is getting the golden tench basically the equivalent of getting a large shark from fishing sharks?
---
A good 2.1m worth indeed
---
156 though right?
---
Snaps Grass makes regular compost. Wish it cold be used to make superconpost!
---
so because bots are a problem it is okay to maybe every monster a resource loot pinata?
---
They did it with RS3 and it had a terrible effect on the economy
---
Funnily enough I remember this exact same discussion for Kurasks and Gargs before they were buffed. The cycle continues.
---
So what? According to RuneScape lore, Guthix says that everything in Gielinor is alive. 
---
But judging from the way you spam "lol" with absurd amounts of "O"s I assume you're not older than 16 and you would get any of that.
---
It's deviant spectres, you have to use Slayer Helm. So you do get a +5% from Salve e if you use it still. Just wondering if its worth it over Torture.
---
Holy fucking shit, the dick move of dick moves.
---
Mage and especially Range guild are an absolute joke in comparison to Warrior (melee) guild. I'd like to see them revamped.
---
it is, all thanks to dumbasses like you suggesting garbage like this and saying "not ez scape btw"
---
Thermy should be the only enemy that drops occult
---
This is why I keep saying we need to stop adding strength bonus every update.
---
I'm saying leveling your account isn't hard. It really is just as easy as putting in the work. If you don't put in the work, then don't complain about being mid level.
---
Did it... go in...?
---
You sound like a real fucking asshole 
---
Cry girl
---
They did the dragon knife design on purpose.
---
Buy on Amazon, sell on GE, PROFIT!
---
Would need an update to the client, sorry
---
So about 100k per kill without rare drops?
---
I mean, just climb up the stairs inside run to the other side and you're there.
---
Diaries, skilling, slayer, quests
---
the joke here is spongebob is taking all his uncharged dragonstone jewelry (all have useful teleports) to the fountain of rune to get 6 charges each instead of 4. the fountain of Rune is in very very deep wildy. thus you do exactly what SB is doing here. tele tablet in, run screaming, use your items, and run out.
---
or ask on reddit cos there is probably multiple people who have already figured this out
---
monkfish, karambwan, and minnows don't require you to buy bait either, and the fish chunks are tradeable to those who don't want to cut things themselves, I don't see a problem
---
Faming XP 
---
Slayer rains money like 10 levels past where you’re at, it’s even better further along. 
---
Konar is perfect for a player like yourself because you’re probably suffering from a small bank. You probably need a lot of money to buy equipment, and her increased profit helps you out tremendously.
---
She is somewhat slower, but by not being able to cannon all her tasks, you also don’t waste as much money which helps you out with your economic problem. 
---
She also gives a lot of points - 20% more than any other master outside the wild, which is useful since you’ll need to unlock a ton of stuff still.
---
She’s less good for players who already have large banks and don’t benefit from saving money from not slaying efficiently. They also can’t do things like Cerberus, DK’s, Kril, demonic gorillas, etc. which really HURTS their slayer experience, which medium leve players like yourself don’t get bothered at all by. 
---
Even with her old drop table, her limiting tasks would make it so she’s not viable for high level plyers anyway. Her nerf kind of just made the range for players which she’s viable for smaller. However, i’d argue she’s still the best for players in that range even after the nerfs.
---
Doing something boring = Hard
---
Doing something decently fun = not hard
---
blowpipe is better at hydra
---
Well I figure it follows the same logic as gem-tipped bolts?  If you can add gems to bolts why can't you add them to arrows?  And I agree, you could buff them even further if the tb couldn't use them.   Could add another +1 to each arrow.  I'd love to use dragonstone dragon arrows for a + 63.
---
They've said numerous times it's complicated. However they recently suggested a new solution that splits your bank into multiple tabs of 816 so it only loads one section at a time
---
Just drive around local streets.
---
For me sounds haven't made much difference. Make sure you eat before the jad phase starts so that the snakelings don't kill you. If you have to eat it gets way harder. 
---
If it's ranged-first jad phase, start with ranged prayer on, and switch prayers when his head dips down. It's counter intuitive because the range attack is still flying at you while you switch to mage. 
---
Are you an eagle?
---
PUT THE GAME DOWN AND GO OUTSIDE 
---
&gt;You aren't having more fun just because you have to kill Zulrah 5k times in a row before you drop your BiS mage gear so you can go do something else finally.
---
... wut? I'm playing uim and I have no idea what you're talking about. 
---
If leaving most of your drops on the ground isn't your thing then obviously, uim might not be for you but it's not because you don't like something that others can't like it, dude.
---
&gt; To another end, the polls weren’t implement so that players could decide what direction the game goes in.
---
You are wrong here. The Polls are to prevent 07 from heading the same direction as Rs3 which made the playerbase leave, why would you allow jagex to make backdoor moves that lead to Rs3's downfall.
---
That is why contents were polled before they can pass, including every aspect, just look at the earlier ones like GWD. It isn't until now when you notice Jagex start making unchecked decisions.
---
Very hardcore, very cool
---
So basically you "carry over" the tick, however the carrying-over is done without visual indication? - And you disable again before the next tick (so while visible you should have prayer on over the tick boundary.
---
You no lucky.
---
Damn thats a long wait .. Glgl!
---
Runelite is incredible
---
it would be too op considering its rewards
---
Lmao I swear. 
---
The boss drops 105k on average per kill, and like 240k on average per kill with the uniques being counted and you're still bitching about the drops. 
---
Good meme
---
What does it sell for right now?
---
Have u even killed a single drake or are u just retarded? They’re about 200-400k an hour 
---
I've been farming vorky as is tbh just running void, salve ei, and BP, bgs, but does dhcb make that big of a difference? Will it help a ton at hydra too, or am I better off just bping hydra too?
---
Also with my melee stats being higher, would I be better off with the new lance over dhcb since i wouldn't need to sell too much if anything for that.
---
Whole changed the topic
---
Lol it's never enough is it? 
---
Swiss Farmy Knife 
---
deserve that for using smooth animations
---
It's an engine problem. When you open the bank, it loads EVERY item in the bank, not just the ones that are visible. Meaning it lags a lot if there's too many.
---
the only explanation is you fucked up and were mad enough about it to make this meme
---
Yeah good luck driving around at 10km/h and wasting fuel, people getting fed up with you.
---
Quick question, can you boost to get into the norther section of the guild(85 farming)? Need it for master clue.
---
How is that not humor? Imagine being so guarded in life that anyones attempt at communication is misconstrued as aggressive. Maybe you need to find something fulfulling in life OP. Good luck out there in this cruel, dark word.
---
Well integrity issues are broader than just loot tables.
---
And even if it's for "the benefit of the game", it is still subjective and under scrutiny of poll because j-mods mostly don't have the competence.
---
:') 
---
T bow could be not allowed to use them
---
I wasted 4k mole marts like this on release date, this makes me really sad lol. 
---
The unique isn’t 5m lol the tooth is like 200k the claw is probably sub 1m right now. Was 1.5 and dropping yesterday 
---
only the top skilling methods reach anywhere near what you can get afking mid level slayer stuff like bbds/wyverns/gargs/nechs
---
naw bro just shut ur damn mouth u trying to defend this shitty ass idea is beyond retarded go back to rs3 game suits u more
---
I know you have to use the slayer helm, that’s why I said it doesn’t stack so you would then know to use the torture. You don’t get the 5% with salve. 
---
This brings back memories of making a new level 3, and starting to farm ore before even leveling combat stats, just for a random golem to spawn and start beating me in the face.  And if you were all tabbed, there goes that inventory of ore.
---
Please Google expectation value and do the math yourself.
---
oh i thought the devout boots were bis for gloves. :P
---
No. Absolutley not. This is not rs3 guy. Stop it. Ew.
---
That would be rather greasy, wouldn’t it? 
---
Are you white
---
This post made me laugh out loud
---
Or just fix doors in general to allow for multiple people to walk through? (Make the open/close animation not have influence on the mechanics, so you can keep a door 'Open', and click on the empty door spot).
---
I don't understand how being able to trade the entire item will make the price go up, the entire amulet is useless theres about 1 place i can think of where the amulet has some impact and thats MM2 barraging/chinning
---
Ooh okay not bad. I got a white lily task and really don't feel like dropping the cash on that so I think I'll ask for an easier one
---
You are an idiot lol every boss drops some type of supplies
---
Oh ok, I thought the superior bonus of the Salve would apply over Torture. Thanks.
---
I don't even want drakes to shit out more loot. All I want is to allow us to block that stupid ass spec with a DFS or antifire. They're literally worse in every way compared to other tasks. Even abby demons are super afk. 
---
Yeah exactly. I mean, I don't think the autism title is offensive, but I agree it's even more annoying when you get 5+ comments calling you a white knight for having an opinion. But I'd also appreciate if you don't call them cunts.

I heard he owns a Scimitar shop in Al Kharid.
---
Cute boi
---
That's not true - the difference in yield between farming levels is absolutely noticeable.  Take a look at this spreadsheet for more information.
---
I would expect a +2?
---
Do you have rigour? 
---
Interesting. And just picking/harvesting or on the health checking?
---
HOW MANY TIME DO I GOTTA TELL YOU OLD MAN I'M BOSSING 
---
Jagex, finds a way.
---
It would make sense if you’re using any type of logical math, but no sadly it doesn’t work like that. Only with void do they stack. 
---
Hand slot!
---
Is the runelite slayer tracker not working for everyone else? I keep resetting it but it hasn't been working for the last 2 days for me
---
Yet the fact you have to get random seeds which take up bank spots is a big drawback for ironman.
---
Bet he's having a wild time
---
lmao!! xD
---
4:1 olm
---
What's his strategy?
---
Ah ok, thank you. That is still pretty low percentage of people considering 99wc
---
Spicy 
---
What? You get like 15-18m per task without uniques lol fuck u mean
---
he has to be trolling 😂
---
That’s the best kind of texture in the game
---
EDIT: 
---
I’m unsure of the drop rate.
---
Tried to sell it for 20m then eventually put in for 5m and sold for 5.9m.
---
Earlier in the week I got a pet rock golem on my hardcore at volcanic ash (51 Mining)
---
My friends hate my RNG
---
Not sure why you have to continually insult me but there are things that make the game less grind-worthy, like this. I understand that if I didn't want to grind I could play RS3, but then I'd be dealing with REAL EZSCAPE like mtx. I understand the grind as well, being someone who got 99 mining in rs2 before LRC. 
---
And really it's worth remembering that OSRS wasn't created because ezscape, the motivation was from mtx. 
---
I'm not op but i traded in 4k mole parts post release date and didn't get a single new seed

If you live in the United States, that's probably why. Chocolate in the US has a lot less cocoa content, specifically the part of the chocolate that is toxic to animals.

Either that, or the dog puked and was fine. 
---
Don’t a lot of Ironman drop unneeded valuables to their mains?
---
Only 19 in stock? I can't complete fight caves with that.
---
Just ask for an easier one if you get something that is too expensive or slow to grow. Most contracts are herbs, cacti or allotments in my experience, and they're both quick and cheap/profitable to do.

Either that or his brother is Erin

I mainly play OSRS, buddy. I only login to RS3 to buy bonds for membership on OSRS. That doesn't mean I'm going to blindly insult the game because "it's RS3", like your braindead self does.

It's a dumb task atm but all you have to do is either D claw spec the boss or blowpipe him down with max range gear.

So that's clearly a yes.

I have always wondered why there are no carrots in osrs.
---
Kind of hard to figure out what the chances of 3 pages are, but you can pretty easily figure the chance of any 3 random pages being from the same book and all having a unique page number. 
---
* The first page isn't compared against anything so it has a 1/1 chance of fitting the pattern. 
---
* The second page has a 1/6 chance to be from the same page as the first page.
---
* The second page has a 3/4 chance of not matching the first page's number. 
---
* The third page has a 1/6 chance to be from the same page as the first and second pages. 
---
* The third page has a 2/4 chance of not matching the first or second page's number. 
---
You just multiply those all together and for the total probability:
---
    1/1 * 1/6 * 3/4 * 1/6 * 2/4 = 1/96
---
Im 94 rc getting 99 rc soon... the rune price drop tilted me hard. Prob lost alot of money on stored runes even if im waiting for when im 99 rc to sell
---
If you're already running vorkath with bgs/bp you don't need to get the dhcb. It's a minor improvement in ease, but is not going to increase kill speed even remotely. Most bp+bgs can out DPS the DHCB easily, with woox walking. 
---
Plus I hear the bp is much better for hydra than a dhcb is so unless you plan to go for easy kills, it ain't worth selling gear for a dhcb.
---
whats not clear? for osrs its fine unless its for competitive stuff (leaderboards/kots/dmm/inferno) but you are liable for whatever happens if the acc is shared, eg if people start fighting over it or one person cheats the accs permed.
---
Both are retarded comments one just is seen as less retarded 
---
How did the "multiple people" figure out the best item to buy?
---
I got three seeds from previously planted trees.
---
Those dont work on seaweed anyway.
---
my PB with bis gear aside from using book of law with dhcb no rigour is 1:52 and average like 2:20-2:45
---
I really, really, really like this image.
---
The gnome restaurant minigame is a better cooking guild than the cooking guild
---
To be clear, if you've been paying attention to the recent trend, jagex have been adding more and more mechanic that deviated from the original combat system. More bosses/npcs have moves that ignore protection prayers, moves that require clicking away etc.
---
Essentially this is EoC in it's embryo state. The fact these are core changes that affect how we play the game, in a setting that explicitly stated that no EoC shall be imposed, WITHOUT a poll, should raise questions.
---
So again, regardless of how you personally feel about afk-scape, do you think Jagex should be allow to make these decisions without poll? Does that not go against the spirit of the game? 
---
This is not me complaining about the mechanics being too hard, because objectively they are more of a nuisance than a challenge, nor did i ever said i was not able to do them, this is about Jagex changing the way i (and many players) chooses to play the game WITHOUT anyone's consent via a poll.
---
Jesus that’s rough 
---
I get this, but on the other hand, would that shortcut even be utilized very often after questing?
---
Absolute trash, yeah
---
Welp i was excited to make bank once i finally lamped to 77 rc guess not now lmao
---
lol now that we're actually having a dialogue. I agree it's not much to do past level 50... it's just tedious at the lower levels when ur constantly leveling up.
---
Faux gay
---
Definitely an awesome accomplishment. But what's the purpose of having a 1 def pure HCIM?
---
The reason I call the game slayerscape is precisely *because* almost no effort is being put into making other skills rewarding and fun. You can add new, interesting, and varied content to other skills to make them more popular but we don't because a large portion of the playerbase is content to slay all day.
---
Dudes got hands the size a trashcan lids. What an absolute unit.
---

What is competitive? That is subjective. What you're saying is not clearly defined within the RS rules. The link which Jagex sent me basically states that all account sharing is not allowed, which isn't correct. My point is that it needs to be officially clarified within the rules, not on Twitter, Twitch or Reddit.
---
Idk dragon hunter lance requires 95 slayer and you need to be on a task to kill the boss.  I'm raiding constantly at 91 slayer right now theres a good chance I get the dhcb before the lance.  The lance imo should at least share the stats with the hasta.
---
grind out 99 thieving and do master farmer. It's like 20 ranarr seeds/h. 1 hour of master farmer a week and you're set on prayer pots for life.
---
It doesn't matter 
---
&gt;buys bonds
---
ya bro im sure ur the person who should help dictate the direction of pvm drops LOL
---
Rarely do I have any business in Keldagrim other than Blast Furnace. 
---
OSRS devs have the keys to making what you want happen, Shelly selling clothes in Target does not. 
---
just learn to raid, it's the most fun pvm experience this game has to offer. And on top of that, it makes great money.
---
yeah gear aint the problem chief. It becomes auto-pilot eventually though, you'll get it down.
---
It not being a matter of cash. Would rather prefer the average drop to decrease if they removed supplies. It's the feeling of having wasted 3 minutes for supplies to do another kill.
---
You were my brother Anakin! I loved you...
---
Probably not because the doors have to close after each person walks through as a stat check. If multiple players could walk through in one opening a player without the level requirement may gain access. Something like a passthrough barrier would seem to work better for these issues
---
There is none. 
---
Sometimes the drops are a bit common, but I actually don't mind them, if you use the ranging and super restore drops just right they can drastically increase you kills per trip. I'm in totally pleb gear (black dhide, fury, bp and granite ring) and have gotten a highly profitable 9 kill trip without uniques because of this. 
---
I think it's just because prayer is becoming a little cheaper to train. So many more bones are coming into the game that it's not as expensive as a whole to train it
---
Account sharing is fine as long as you're not trying to rig minigames or trying to get rank 1 by sharing the account etc. I believe in dmm it simply not allowed. Besides from that its fine.
---
You're right, there's not rly a purpose, but I do like the way to play the game and of course the challenge.
---
Enchanted and darkness may have the same stats but they aren't mystic robes 
---
I like this because he won’t be able to crawl away while we kill him 
---
Oh alright :) congrats on the cape!
---
Bandwagoning, probably
---
The farming cape should teleport to the highest tier zone (crafting cape bank alternative)
---
I don't know what OP is thinking, dude just wants to hop on the bandwagon to hate on jagex support.
---
Even the rules say it MIGHT get banned, why the hell would he need a clarification for it.
---
Imagine using guthans in 2019
---
Devout boots are highest pray bonus in foot slot right? Im using them while bursting nechs right now
---
Honestly that's too high for a boss that really isnt difficult to learn. Unique prices will come down eventually but that 2.2m in just base alchables should probably be halved
---
Im gonna pk you boy
---
With everyone Aryan, no one will be. 
---
Sold it for 880k
---
competitive = post 99 ranks
---
Right
---
No tengo nada 
---
Maybe start thinking about bank upgrades with all these new items being added in? 
---
His right hand and arm are a bit big, but other than that I love this art and the style

That doesn't look like a swastika...

Thankyou for taking the time to explain how wrong you are.
---
NERF THEM! took me 5 Herb runs to get an abyssal dagger from my cabbage.
---
No just the antifire shield
---
It'll crash the price of blood runes... Somehow.
---
Just got real
---
Wash your hands.
---
It’s supposed to be perspective but I guess I have to work on that more.
---
By playing above ehp.
---
Bosses that drop mostly junk but have a rare drop would be fine... But bosses that drop 200k+ in resources a kill are what killed skilling. 
---
IDK how things work on RS3, but over here at the nostalgia zone, that is a sure fine way to get banned lol. It may not be a bot script. But with how the motor on that operates, keystrokes would come in at the same time every time. Otherwise that's awesome 😁 lol
---
How unlucky can you get.. hydras is the most common task from konar.
---
Classic "I don't like the answer so I'm going to choose to ignore it."
---
What? I never even implied that. Grow a brain.
---
So me and my friend buddied up on a slayer task and within 157 fire giants I was able to snag 2 rune scimitars, a shield left half, and a dragon spear, sure its it's no pet drop but I still think that's insane luck in 1 task. I wanted to share, and ask are those 2 drops comparable to any pet drops(spear and shield) 
---
You would have to run back and get it within an hr 
---
wrong
---
I think one of the main issues with the Slayer system is that there's no real good baseline correlation between xp and gp per hour. I believe it's bad design when we have tasks such as trolls that net ~100-200k profit &amp; 50k Slayer xp an hour while at the same time we have hell hound tasks getting clocked in at 40k Slayer xp/hr and giving no drops. My philosophy is that there should be no "bad" task for Slayer, you either get high xp tasks with little to no drops, high profit tasks with very poor xp, or a mixed xp and profit rate perhaps going even on supplies whether you need pots, runes, or Cannon.
---
it works because prayers' effects work the same tick you activate them but the pray drain starts the tick after that, so flicking them gets all the benefit but skips the drain
---
&gt;Theoretically we could then just spam click prayer twice every 0.6 seconds?
---
yeah this is possible, usually called one tick flicking, there are guides you can look up with tips on doing/using that, and also runelite has some functions in their prayer plugin to help with it. personally i find it much easier than paying attention to npcs'/my attack speeds and only activating it when needed, it's completely mindless when you get used to it
---
Watching high level PvMers get content is the best mid level content
---
Hmm good to know then, guess I'll keep farming the same as always for now and try to just slowly build up range gear then.
---
Why not call it a S'Weiss Farmy Tool and have a quest to connect the Weiss trolls and the Farming Guild with the tool as the reward?
---
Don't forget calquats. Picking berries and cactus are also good for a few thousand xp
---
They mention about 50 things every Q&amp;A stream every week. They aren't all going to happen. 
---
Discount code Acai.
---
Still that would taste ehhhh....
---
I always thought woaaaaahhhh 816 spaces, i would never fill that... until i got the message saying my bank was full...
---
Yeah I don’t even play UIM and the thought of the game mode makes me sick lol. 
---
The more I play my Ironman and hit big milestones like finally finishing MM2 the other day, the more I realize I’m actually playing 15-20 or sometimes as many as 30 hours a week and having fun doing it. I’ve found life in playing the game to play the game, and I can see how certain people who have spent the better part of the last decade playing this game — eventually startup a UIM and really committing to autism awareness programs.
---
i see that now, thanks a ton!
---
It's mainly because sometimes multiple people try to enter through the same door. But only one person can enter at a time. The doors themselves look great aesthetically , so a barrier/vines would look weird. It's new content so it'll be better in a few days. It's a bit nitpicking tbh.
---
I expected this comment, so this is the power of my ultra instinct

I got 3 tasks in 150 points. Hydras are the most common thing konar gives.

Personally, I've never shared my account.

I swear to god, if you want to meet the worst the Runescape community has to offer, hang out at the Sand Crabs.
---
Fake news
---
But when HCBTW and regular BTW are together the HCBTW usually talks down to us regular BTWs.  Makes me sad.
---
Sometimes there's a glitch where if you teleport out your pet disappears until you full log out and log back in. Happened to me when I was doing Vorkath with my Vorki pet out.
---
The answer to mid-level being boring should not be become high level. Obviously I want to do that but I haven't yet. 
---
the fact that the obelisk looks like its his giant boner just makes this whole post. I love this
---
Brother that isn't what I meant.
---
I mean that inbetween two DDS combos there is a minor delay, not that both hits aren't on the same tick. One DDS spec hits at the same time, two DDS specs have a delay between them. If you do all 4 specs b2b it isn't doing it in 4 ticks.
---
It's just that skilling requires no skill to do and every pet is just pure luck. Bosses atleast have some mechanics meaning boss pets ain't so easy. 
---
he tried to call it but didn't get the pet back
---
they usually wait a month or so before giving us the drop rates
---
I'd like to know too though
---
This makes me hard
---
I mean they did clarify. They said do it at your own risk because it could lead to your account being permanently banned. Then provided a link with more information on the subject of account sharing.
---
Can someone explain what im looking at pls? lol
---
Huge influx of Hydra bones+Dragon Bones from Alchemical Hydra drops right now. When the hype dies down the prices should normalize a bit.
---
I’ve gotten 4 warm tasks! 
---
2 Dragon harpoons
---
1 Dragon sword 
---
Mystic Bottom (Dusk) 
---
And a bunch of other stuff adding up to a few mil. 
---
Wyrms =======&gt; LOVE 
---
Nothing entitles me, personally.  Based off community feedback, I think there’s room for improvement with some easy fixes. It was a really cool update in theory and would love for it all not to be dead content. Personally, I’m really happy with the Alchemical Hydra, however this update definitely hasn’t been for everyone.
---
Coping mechanisms are still beneficial. 
---
Removing alchohol from an alchoholics house is a pretty common sense solution. Eliminating the possibility of relapse is the first step. And in a (reletively) lower-stakes environment like a MMORPG it may be enough to eliminate the risj. 
---
The farming guild isn't high level... Nor is the new fishing stuff... Or the new quests.
---
You are complaining about how you have to drop BiS mage gear, then propose gamemode where you can't even store stuff at zulrah so you have to be much more cautious about it
---
Mmorpgs, like Runescape and WoW, are goal driven games; so if you don’t have a goal that you want to work towards then the game is going to seem pointless and boring. I play WoW and osrs on and off, so I know the feeling of getting bored of the game and looking for other options. I quit WoW for a while, and what made me come back was wanting to raid with my friends in their guild. These games can be pretty boring when playing on our own and we have no one to share it with. I suggest trying to play with friends, if they even play, and if they don’t play, then try to set goals and accomplish those goals. If you don’t have any friends who play and you don’t have any goals that you’re enthusiastic about, then I suggest finding other games. Good luck.
---
People will always complain about this game man. They see s video of someone with 100m+ skulled one hitting a dude in void and instantly cry. 
---
You shouldn't be thinking too much on the roofs. Bring up distracting background activities and finish off Agility in no time. Optimal approach, and prevents existential crises.

24 hour penalty for cancelling an easy.

If all you want is to get 1kc you can easily just completely forget about points and suicide every room. It might not be very quick but it will get your diary completion.

Great question thanks

did he try relogging?
---
How self-entitled can you be? If I were Jagex i'd gladly refuse your $11 a month if it meant not having someone as toxic as you in the community
---
The caves, because you will get the maximum amount of targets for every cast, and you can stay in combat for more of the time. 
---
It will cost more though because you aren't collecting any drops. 
---
Any good clans to join, just for casual players?
---
It's definitely sensible to ban in these circumstances. I was mainly asking Jagex because I have clanmates who share accounts. Personally I've never shared mine.

Account sharing is aganist the rules. So if you're account is permanently banned for account sharing then that's on you. You're told literally in game to not give your password to anyone.

How we haven't been able to get dogs(beside hellpup or master clue) is astounding.

Slayer is slow AF and Blast Furnace gets that profitable much faster. Even Iron Bars are competitive with mid-level Slayer rates.
---
Warrior guild is a guild done right
---
Busted
---
Kind of true. But slayer is by far the most popular and liked skill. Therefore the question if it kills the game or keeps player in the game is the other question.

Drakes are fine atm the claw itself is 3.7m right now

Never said you can't enjoy it, just said I think it doesn't add real depth - just gimmicky strategy.

This is the last step. This game is just escape after ezscape update. If they change the rug I'm quitting.

---
I read somewhere that logging out/back in would fix it. 
---
But the drop was also 1/6k from most things... people just panicked... wasn't that big of a deal IMO at that rate.  
---
You just sound lazy at this point. 
---
Novice quests have great exp rewards, you go from low level to mid-level super fast. Also my list of "not great rewards": Fairy rings, Balloons, Sprit trees, Gnome Gliders, Ancient Magicks, Dragon scimitar, Dragon longsword, Dragon Halberd, Crystal Bow, Dwarf Cannon, Mage cape (not a quest), Dorgeshuun crossbow, Lunar magic (not mid level but hey), Herblore skill, Runecrafting skill, Rune platebody, Berserker helm (and variants), Helm of Neitiznot.
---
Zeah is super easy to get to, just use house tabs, getting a few thousand points in nmz isn't hard. Xeric's talisman is super cheap. Fairy rings are like a first 10 hours of membership quest. 
---
Even low level diaries have benefits, especially varrock etc. for battlestaves, lumbridge ring for cabbage teleport. Falador shield for mole.
---
You have all sorts of slayer, all sorts of skilling you can do. Mid-level is where everything is accessible and efficiency-scape doesn't matter since you can still get like 2-3 levels every hour or so. 
---
You can get 60 range super fast if you insist on using dragon knives. 
---
Jad is mid-level content (70 range, 43 prayer requirement basically, first time Jad is one of the biggest rushes in the whole game). 
---
Desert Treasure is mid-level content (seriously cool quest). Haunted mine + Tarn's Lair (cool boss fight cool reward) 
---
Quest cape is like epitome of mid-level content (used to be, with mm2 and dragon slayer 2 less so now).
---
Shayzien helm takes anyone with 43 prayer a grand total of like 30mins to get.
---
Shut up, son
---
STUPID IDIOT FUCK BOTS
---
Seems pretty clear to me.
---
Do it if you want. Don't cry if/when you get banned for it.
---
The uniques are so useless never ever would they be 5m.
---
Charge your prayer /s
---
Nah you are well ready. Take a trident and a spade. You'll be good
---
If youre 90 farming you can just plant a spirit tree
---
&gt;and bloat reasons (that would be like a 100 new arrows and mess with the enchant interface) and so it doesn't just feel like a lazy copy.
---
What do you mean by this?  Just curious.  Do you mean the enchant spell's interface would be crowded?  That's a good point.  It could be a whole new spell, that would be interesting and sort of make sense.  Maybe it could even be given a theme or locked behind a quest, like associated with the Arceuus spellbook and a new quest, and need full favor to enchant or something.
---
Also I was thinking they would have to be given a low chance of the effect happening, because a 10% chance would be happening like every 3-4 seconds.  Like maybe 5% chance or something to balance it against the bolts.
---
Really I just feel like the arrows need a buff.  The effects could be minimal but I feel like it'd be nice to be able to hit a little bit harder with the sub tb bows.  Enchantments would an additional buff to make it a worthwhile change.
---
Closest thing to competitive osrs is DMM or tournaments and those are consistent disasters. Probably because runescape doesn't translate well into a competitive format.
---
We need less aussie worlds I can't stand it when my blood rushes to my head. The gravity is just too weird and I can't be asked to wake up every day to eat vegemite.  ITS TIME TO STOP

I think the game mode is terrible. I don't play it. Some people enjoy it. They should certainly play the game mode. The mode is designed around *not* having access to banking - why is it okay that UIM have access to looting bag / death containers then? It just appears as if it goes against the spirit of the mode in general if you ask me. Why don't we just give UIM 56 inventory spaces? As is, UIM store things outside their inventory like in a bank.
---
How dare people have an opinion
---
Wow thats a fat paragraph im not reading all thay i dont care that much
---
Start again as in rebuild on ur hacked acc, you shouldn’t get hacked again if you add authenticator etc, just let this be a slap on the wrist for not having authenticator. There’s no way to tell who actually hacked you but it’s best to make sure it doesn’t happen again.
---
Slightly off topic but why are dragon knives held differently than all other knives?
---
Didn’t insure, continued to get 22 more hydra kills and 1.3m total xp in between pictures? (Probably died)
---
im sitting at 1:16 and thought it was damn near perfect, guess i was wrong.
---
If you aren't already, I'd add in Yanillian hop runs to get your payments for protecting mahoganies. It doesn't give a ton of xp, but they're really easy to do and it's insanely cheap to grow them yourself compared to buying the hops from the GE.
---
As at 29th May 2017 "hitting" a zero with the DWH spec doesn't lower defence:

There is Tekton, but that's a special case.

---
&gt; @Iron\_Stepy No; while special attacks usually do trigger on a successful roll even if the damage comes out as 0, the DWH blog said this one wouldn't.
---
I think it should be a guild exclusive thing. It could be part of the bank in the Level 85 area, as it doesn't serve much of a purpose besides being the closest bank to a spirit tree.
---
Rip your rng for fashion 
---
Your logic is actually fucking retarded. 
---
You gave Saniboch 875 gp
---
wait a minute, you can keep dying in a solo and still keep going for almost infinite time to get the diary done?  I've never raided before but that sounds like it would make the task much easier
---
I'd rather not have a JMOD dismiss my suggestion as E N G I N E W O R K
---
I think most are. It is just that you're more likely to vocalize the things you want to be changed than the things that you think are fine. And while it can bog down the positivity of an update, I do think it is important to call out issues and problems so they can fix it. If everyone just said it was great and overlooked the issues, the issues likely wouldn't be fixed right away and could be put off for months. But the OSRS Team is usually pretty good at reading the community and telling what is actual feedback and what is just whining or such.
---
My cat would literally destroy my keyboard. Our biggest Maine Coon is 12 kilos ._.
---
imagine testing a new feature lmao
---
Sorry but are you retarded? A whip over 1000 hits can deal 30000 damsge, that is a useless metric to use. 
---
We're obviously talking in same gameticks here. Max hit of dds is 46+46. Gmaul is 48x3.
---
To make matters even worse, gmaul doesn't follow the regular tick rules, and can be used before the game tick. It can also be used when eating. Therw is nothing balanced about gmaul, and it should have been changed a long time ago.
---
Definitely will message you, I see tons of them and don’t have anyone to message 
---
My clan members have been saying this too. No problem for me, just typical Jagex
---
To add to this, once you lower the defences, dragging him onto the next vent prematurely doesn't seem to give him more defence again, just stronger attacks, so if you're paying attention to prayer you can drag him onto the next vent before he transforms 
---
I’m never getting laid 
---
I'm now 82 cooking with Cooking Gauntlets and using Hosidious kitchen, should I start with Sharks now till Anglers? I was originally planning on doing monks till 89, sharks till 93, then angler fish till 99. 
---
Why did you point that out. Now it’s bothering me. Wtf man
---
Yea not gonna lie, the use for those rods is pretty niche.
---
That shop could use some sort of reward for excess pearls too. After you've got the rods and the fish sack there's nothing left to use the pearls on. At least other similar resources can be converted into other things. Nuggets turn into clay, marks of grace turn into amylase crystals.

I used easily 3-4k tokens on my grind. Almost got 70 Att/Str from it and went from 48-60 Def as well. 
---
I'm trying that now, but fuck man. Agility is quite possibly the worst skill to train. Even just laying there on my phone and watching Netflix, there's only so many times I can do the Canifis course.
---
I got lucky with mine first day. There were like 2 cannons set up and 5+ players in serious gear, then just me in graceful in a whip. I managed to get a gangster and no luck on the drop. Then I noticed the boss spawned and no one was hitting it so I attacked it. The rest piled by I was ahead in hits so it was my drop.
---
Lucky hits. It being dragged over the correct vents the second it changes. Had allot of sub 2 min kills. Mostly 1.50-2.10 that one was just really lucky I guess. Also I might have had 2 bp specs hit hard 
---
pls no
---
The point is that maybe it's time to do some weird shit because pvp is completely trash content, and it gets worse with every item update.
---
Awesome!
---
I agree. Stealing Creation was the shit. Still really miss it.
---
Konar until you hit 72 or 77 
---
Im fine with this but I feel as though the mole’s structural integrity is compromised by the fact that the one claw is off to the side. The claw should be directly in the middle so the mole can properly maintain equilibrium as it is being slaughtered by ruthless pvmers who clearly don’t care about this beautiful endangered species
---
Yeah, raids 1 deaths just make you drop all of your raids specific items (seeds, raid potions, potion 2nds, etc) and you lose points which reduces your expected loot value. You don’t get kicked out of the raid, you don’t lose any of your actual items, just lower unique chance and less rewards if you don’t get a unique.

What is the difference between the free to play worlds and members only worlds? Is there any? I'm seeing a lot of people say different things about the differences, but nothing definitive, can't find anything official either.
---
How long until the numbers start dropping?
---
306 has hundreds of people playing 
---
It's more just the sheer number of how many I got.
---
Wow. Grats my guy.

I'm the floor
---
Even funnier is when people get caught out on a f2p world wearing black dhide with an inventory full of sharks :p
---
please upload it
---
Farm guild is 45.
---
Diaries are really good.
---
Novice quests were fun and give 10% favor.
---
New slayer master is literally mid level content. 
---
If you cant find any benefit from the update, you're not a mid-level account.
---
Most likely because the Alchemical Hydra has a noted drop of like 20 of them, also the dragon hunter Lance speeds up some dragon kills 
---
Higher the better for me since it's one of the best if not the best slayer task I get for money 
---
What friend zone lvl is this??
---
Dharok can stack out more than 157 in 3 hits if you luck out, just like this guy.
---
Does Iban blast have set magic attack? Meaning does wearing magic boosting gear increase damage?
---
And 
---
If you open the barrows chest to get the last brother before searching does the chest stay at the previous % before opening or does it change after the last brother before searching 
---
Fair enough, that's why I had made that comment in the form of a question. To me it's dead content, I never go to that area except for blast furnace, but I realize that may not be the case for other players. 
---
hydra has low defense and you can set cannon there Normal ones. not the boss
---
they die pretty fasy with blowpipe+cannon and is close to bank. only good if you have 95 slayer.  
---
I guess everyone now is killing them offloading their bones maybe drag bone will rise again after  less people go hydras
---
They both require skill, but nhing will have the better player win a lot more often.
---
Also the convenience of not having to switch out your amulet every 4th run while doing any activity that requires quick banking.
---
Not having to remember to switch out a glory/duel ring every so many runs makes things a lot more brainless/afk.
---
And you can just sell it again when you're done with minimal loss.
---
Everything new should be just as incentiviced as the old shit.
---
Otherwise it's a literal waste of development money as it doesn't increase the engagement in the game past the week of release tourism.
---
They're protecting your account, dumb dumb.
---
This would devalue my rug !
---
On this topic does a higher prayer bonus (proselyte, monk robes) elongate the time it takes before prayer drain happens or lessen the amount drained each drain tick?
---
aah why not, it wont hurt =)
---
I haven't keep track of the exp, but it seems to be on the lower side unless you do it well. But I'd still say it is pretty good content. Once I stopped trying to do it well (e.g. cutting fish while the bird is flying and such) and just collected an inventory then cut it down manually or AFK, I found it to be a lot more enjoyable. It kinda reminds me of Sacred or Infernal Eels, only instead of AFKing you click spots in the water. And compared to the Eels, I am pretty sure it is better exp plus the Hunter Exp. It might get a buff to make a bit better for the effort, at least at the higher end, but as is I still think it has a place in the skills.

Nice.

That's exactly what I meant with the post, I too have been afking monkfish even though it's not the best xp, and am still 95 fishing, money is nearly meaningless in the game anyway, you can just most of the time do the content to try to get gear you want if you don't have money, or just do some other fun content to get the materials or money you need for the gear

why should jagex waste dev time on people who can't be bothered to even play the game?
---
There was guy in pest control clan chat 8 months ago who was usually discussing politics and economics (calling everyone who didn't agree with him libtard, calling europe poor shithole tc.) who claimed to live in mansion in california with his boyfriend

Nah man looks dope don't sweat it
---
kinda ironic considering mine was ironic also :), should've added *rolls eyes* in there I suppose
---
Why do chaturbate streamers always have a dragon knife in their butt? Like do they just keep it there all day?
---
How the shit is that subjective. Anything with the word COMPETITION is probably a no on sharing, partly, and I'm just shooting in the dark here, because it has the word COMPETITION in it and partly because it may be a COMPETITIVE COMPETITION. 
---
Honestly if I could remove one thing from the game, it would be cannons.  Imagine polling it now; "We would like to introduce a self-contained weapon that constantly damages enemies to you in an area, returning you xp for fast training".

Idk if i should call it a bug, its probably just connection issues since my country doesnt have a server
---
I often "spawn" 1 or 2 squares away from where i should after an obstacle and have to wait 1-2 seconds for the game to put me in the right place
---
Yeah doesnt need to be timing exactly, give slightly different routes, make one route give more xp and then the other, idk. Just feels boring

They do not drop 2k cash stack. Wiki cites 400-1k. It's not my rng, other people report 4k per kill and about 400-600k per hour if lucky. AsukaYen reported after 5k gargoyle kills, he made 4218 gp per kill and 448k per hour. 
---
Oo sorry thought they were
---
Yeah this would be sick, personally think it should take at least 10 heads though cause both kbd and vorkath heads are v easy to get
---
Yeah, that rug is WAY to small

I'd say low alch yourself, but you're honestly not even worth the runes.

Could do with 816 spaces just for my secondaries/Tree payments lmao

Hopefully the new populace doesn't derail OSRS into the wrong direction by oversatured content, mobile pandering, wasted dev time on deadman and similar tournaments, and instrusive updates as a whole. Temporarily satisfying the average playerbase for long term detriments isn't favorable. Be careful regarding what you vote for.
---
Even if it a toggle for players who like the bracer style, I hope we see something like this. It is disappointing that BiS Gloves aren't gloves and they do look a bit lacking.

aerial fishing, if cutting your catch yourself, outputs tradeable fish chunks that players who don't cut the catch themselves can buy to use as stackable aerial fishing bait
---
Ok - fair enough. Not every new slayer monster has to shit out massive profit and be easy to kill like a gargoyle. But if their drop table is garbage, they need to make up for it by at least being AFK or be good experience. Drakes are neither AFK, good experience, or have a good drop table. They’re already dead content. One task, I blocked half way through. There’s simply no point in doing them, especially being locked behind 84 slayer.

What was the clan called again, the White Legion?

Isn't that the Ku Klux Klan?

could i just play osrs from mobile to dodge restoring my pc, because i have a ton of other games on my pc that this stuff doesnt happen with and i wouldnt like reinstalling them

Damn 3 claws gzz!!!

more servers pls.

Yup I have, we're in the same clanchat!

Yeah, maybe if ahrims arms are 5 feet long. No ones arms are long enough to shift the apparent size of a hand by THAT much.

I’m with you on this. Also, when he has pet, theres 16 house teleport tabs. Suddenly there’s 5 with no pet.

He died.

You could, or you could risk playing on your PC, but there's certainly a chance of something being on there considering you've been hacked 2 times.

I hope you quit.

Max combo dmg/max hp. You can always be killed even if at 99 hp (or anglered)
---
How did we miss this?
---
Depends on what you're doing. One is way cheaper and has defensive bonus
---
Well I did it at 100 combat with barrows armour and it was really hard healing people with 60 combat. They were "fine" because of the high levels carrying them.
---
Same I handed in 152 parts I obtained myself ): Got the boxes (without the new seeds)
---
just have an air staff and no armor and they'll attack on sight

And maybe add some Daily random chance to get said lamps. As a way to entice players into paying to get more.

Damn, what was James thinking?

I'd Argue that it is, I'd say its both a defensive and offensive spell, 2 in 1. It does damage which is usually associated with attacking.

Just for the record, I also fell victim too. As I was unable to compose myself and carry on with the minigame, I was only rewarded 5k rc exp.
---
Yeah, we got our full xp (without 2x multiplier DS had) transfered to RS3 accounts. That definitely saved some grind, but the gameplay is not the same ever since.
---
What use is that? I think it might be good at wyverns but haven't tested it.

My University in Scotland is similar. Two twelve week blocks, with exams for semester A (mid-september to mid-december) taking place mid-to-late January, then late January to late April for semester B, followed by exams taking place mid-to-late May, then summer holidays until mid-September again. In theory you have 6 weeks~ off from uni in the winter so there's adequate time to enjoy Christmas and New Year while still studying effectively.

okay, thank you for the insight my friend and i hope the haters stop down voting your posts XD

Has everything to do with it "mate".  Why would Jagex throw more money and resources at 1% of the player base? Or take those resources from the other 99%?

Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.
---
Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.

Firstly, this is the party room we're talking about, not drop trading. Literally, put platelegs into chest, hop over, pull lever (a minor mistake where I said I dropped it and logged, as opposed to hopping over and dropping - dropping as in pulling lever).
---
Secondly, drop trading was absolutely possible during this time, and I absolutely have done a drop trade in OSRS before we could multi log. I don't think you know what you're talking about.

Wishing you could play more to get to the fun content while watching the content you finally got get stripped away by whiners is the bees knees

I just love *being* at the farming guild if that makes sense. Like it's legitimately nice to Tele in and check some patches there. I don't know if it's just because it's new or because it's incredibly pretty but definitely great job on that for sure. 
---
But did you use an authenticator and bank pin?
---

---
It’s not. Iron_Aez is retarded and I think Syphiliticc is trolling

Maybe for someone with no life. For someone with a job and responsibilities it takes some serious time so it’s a very long term goal

I mean, the place is desolate; I've never seen another person there, much less an actual PKer. But still.

Not a waste of time if you’re enjoying yourself. You could make that argument for anything. How much time do you spend on Reddit or watching tv in a year? At least on runescape you have SOMETHING to show for that time
---
but it's not all rng lol, that's his point
---
RuneLite with 50,000 people using it, many of which have banks worth billions, decided to target your 3 month old account and steal a couple of million GP. This sounds legit.

I just want to clarify that dogs are better than cats.

Having other players around doesn't hinder you much. Besides, they're going up to you because you're standing next to the hotspot :)

Now if growing a redwood granted a better reward then I’m sure you’d be all in for the wait. Sadly that’s not the case unless I’m missing something :(
---
Not all bosses are hard you autistic cunt. BUT look at Zuk, TOB or even Zulrah. You skillers probably wet your pants before you even get to jad phase. 
---
Guy needs to get the alching runes now tho
---
Alright, that's somewhat fair. Although I think a lot of people probably do sell assets when it comes to Rigour since it can help you out substantially more than gear
---
The thing I don’t understand is you’re rewarded more from pvm than you are if you’re 77 RC or above like myself. It makes no sense bloods were about 350-360 each a few days ago now they’re 280 and bad money. Why is it that you’re rewarded more from killing a monster than crafting the actual runes yourself ?????
---
1/10k with thousands of people doing it is going to crash the price of the items.

This is true of fishing in real life as well unfortunately. 
---
Honestly though, would making the fish sack work like coal bag does be too bad? I fail to see where it would be "op" (educate me if I'm missing something) since pretty much all the fish you'd bank are caught very close to banks, you'd only get to AFK a bit more when fishing something like Anglers. Also if it actually takes ~100 hours to get, it wouldn't be worth anyway.
---
Imagine being 1400 total and acting like there’s nothing to do
---
If you only do skilling and you dislike pvm then what are you going to spend your money on? Rares to bankstand?
---
Funny how your grammar shapes up only when you started getting pissed lol
---
Most people on this sub are sheep. I’m an Ironman and got 98 herb banked from raids.It’s hypocritical to say shit about herbs being dropped rarely from Konar. Convenient how faux got his herb baked through pvm and then has a problem with mid levels getting their herbs that way
---
It's less than 200k now.
---
1/96 is the chance of a clue scroll which rewards three god pages, for them all to be from the same book and not duplicates, but you ignored the chance of getting three god pages in one clue.

Is this true? My accounts perm mute turns one year in a couple days. I just started playing again and didn’t realize I’d received a mute. My initial appeal got denied and I was pretty upset. But are you telling me there’s hope?

It’s a “manual perm mute” and there’s no evidence provided for the mute

And your name is the serial number of the Tool. Love it!

 I'm just about able to catch the second tier of fish and in over an hour caught \~1.2k fish which was just about enough xp for one hunter and one fishing level which does seem slower than if I was training either skill individually.
---
Undecided if I'll go back for more... disappointed the fish sack is cosmetic only and not a looting bag for fish

Mid level people do play the game, I'm mid level I still play I just dont have all the time in the world. I've got maybe 4 hours max I can play a day and when I do I lose out on socializing. With work, family, and other responsibilities I cant spend 8+ hours a day to get to high level content. 4 hours a day is more than anyone should be playing video games anyways, but playing this little it looks like it'll take me over a year to make it anywhere late game.  I just think itd be nice to introduce more mid level content that requires skill like raiding does. All mid level activities are pretty monotonous. The rewards dont have to be high level rewards but itd be nice to have something like a mid level raid that takes time and practice but rewards you fittingly for it.

Prayer flicking is lowkey inefficient tbh, if you're doing something that's low enough intensity where you can pray flick for a significant amount of time and you're paying attention, you'd be better off just playing an alt.

Jebrim would finally quit agility
---
I just got past 1400 skill total myself! What made me really play a TON the last month has been getting over the "fear" of doing harder content (barrows, dks, kbd, wilderness monsters, jad etc.). I find it really fun to do slayer (mostly for money, getting 70 for kurasks and 72 for skeletal wyverns has boosted my bank a ton) and slowly work towards bis gear, so i recommend trying out bosses or keep setting goals in form of gears when levels take longer to grind out!
---
Right on. I swear though if I get hellhounds again i'm gonna be sad
---
When you say this time was no different than last do you mean you put your info into sketchy sites again..?
---
Soooo...if it wasn't different from the last, you put your login into strange websites again and got hacked...again? Didn't learn from the first time huh.
---
Lol, I guess you completely missed all thw comments with guy going "I'm maxed pvm god with an infernal and 5b bank!"
---
The fact is that he said Skilling resources shouldn't come from pvm, but he has no problem farming raids which give Skilling resources. Why are you on my ass?
---
Because you can't stockpile 4k birdhouses. Also I never said that what he did wasn't okay but I do think there's a difference between stockpiling supplies and trying to instantly get massive piles of each of the new seeds. 
---
At least tele to Varrock not Lumbridge. 
---
Not sure that's a good way to look at things. I'm pretty sure that mentality- not criticizing Jagex even where the criticism is admittedly valid in favor of "looking on the bright side"- played a big part in bringing MTX to their current level in RS3.
---
Besides, even when it's just about QA or design or something, it's always worth pointing out the room for improvement. No doubt some people are going way the hell beyond that and posting rage quit threads or ignoring all the good the OSRS team's done, but those people just need to calm down, not shut up, and I don't think think calling them out like this is going to work.

I think she might actually assign Lizardmen in Molch, which is the temple, those might allow Shamans.

"waahhh"

Still crying I see?

It says "Players may not sell, share, transfer or lend their account to anyone else" 
---
I like the idea behind things like  brimhaven agility, werewolf course and gnomeball, where it should be more effort for more xp.
---
In practice it's still just shit rates and you don't get millions from marks of grace
---
Fair enough
---
Sure. But someone put it all on a spreadsheet with ge tracker prices and it came to a 51% nerf overall last I looked at it.  
---
But that's not what matters. What matters is that there's no longer the chance of that big drop from doing her tasks. Which kind of ruins the fun, and people play games for fun. The fact that its only a 0.96% chance is more of a reason to not nerf it. Especially since it's only a small portion of the community that will be doing her tasks in a week.

Imagine playing osrs in 2019 for enjoyment. Disgusting 
---
Not really, because already thousands of people aren't doing it from when I last checked. You'd get the 100-200 herbs naturally from slayer anyway in that same time frame, especially ranarrs which have retained their price despite so many slayers. Also hundreds if not thousands do Vorkath and Zulrah efficiently, yet the profit from those bosses dont tend to dramatically dip... 
---
Because RS combat is flawed and wasn’t designed with exciting pvp in mind. So people make up implicit rules to make it more exciting (no safing, etc.)
---
Oh I've bumped into him in the wild before
---
They are already planning on doing something in the same vein as this. Not sure how I feel about the pre-pay thing; seems a bit weird. But otherwise, it sounds like a decent system. Personally, I think their proposed system with the fee waived if you get there in 2 minutes and an NPC to collect your items for 4x the cost or such would work fine too. I'm also fine with keeping current double death mechanics; the 4x NPC would be the safe reclaim option if you were afraid of a double death (or just too lazy to run back).
---
Understandable, even if I don't especially agree.
---
I'm thinking something like... you get exp based on the tier of artisan task you take, and then you go do that thing, get rewarded based on the skill, and turning in the artisan task gives artisan exp.
---
So for example, farming contracts. You'd just get it from the artisan dude, and when you turn it in you get artisan exp+seed box. 
---
Or a Hunter box would be like, hunt 100 red chins, then you turn it in and get a random impling+artisan exp.
---
That's just the sort of thing I'm picturing Artisan as now/what I'd want it to be.
---
Good. Bolts have been stupidly expensive for forever. There's a reason everybody just uses broad bolts, it's cause time bolts are way too much for regular Slayer use. 
---
This is the home teleport spell, not the lumbridge one ☺️
---
One death automatically makes you inferior, change my view.
---
hope this isnt another 12k dry pet for you :P 
---
Just don’t suck!
---
People selling gear to buy new items. Alot of people playing bringing in more item drops, which doesn't directly correlate to gold coming into the market.
---
The whole diary except the celastrus tree can be done in an hour or two.
---
I don't really actually play - when you kill someone like this, can't someone just come up to you and murder you while you're picking their shit up?
---
It takes a while to kill them with max melee. *If* it is at all doable with your stats, it will be horrendously slow. The loot isn’t great either. You would probably be better off skipping them. 
---
It’s possible to recover it without access to the email address? And if I do recover it it’ll remove the Authenticator?
---
what anvil and what are you trying to use on the anvil?
---
Thank you for the best present a deposit box.
---
Lol what a nerd
---
2 with a fury
---
These are all very basic words, though.
---
Ah sweet thanks I'll have a watch when I get home
---
Throw it in the bank for a month. Unless you're fine taking a 10% profit hit atm.
---
Which is 50% btw
---
I'm going to escalator land!!!! When do we get to the ride?!?!
---
I use them to tell to morytania, the fairy ring is just shy south of the herb patch 
---
Somebody somewhere may indeed yes. 
---
So it has to do with the seed box, that makes sense with my experience with it.

I posted this like an hour after release. I'm constantly buying mole parts normally for spirit seeds, since I don't do zulrah. Decided to hold them for a bit over a week prior to release to see if new seeds would be in them. Assumed they would since they said they'd be in nests, but also thought they could overlook these. 
---
Seems to be a bug/oversight, since the game doesn't determine the  nest contents until its opened, its not based on when you get the mole parts. So they should've been generating new nests, but it seems seed boxes still generate old nests, not new. 
---
Or they intentionally did it and plan on changing it on next update. 
---
can i order a 30% nerf please
---
Is there anything as scary as having Dharok down in the tunnels and knowing he could surprise you and 1 hit kill you at any moment?
---
Hell ye I'd fuck her
---
Whats 157?
---
The lack of proper context is making every guy in here feel this one in their gut.
---
tbh i would like to see changes to the drop table for new slayer master oh wait.....
---
record is 160k
---
Can confirm. 14 year old me felt like a total bad ass getting into the cook's guild back in 2001.
---
when they announced ironman idk why but i assumed they'd all be jovial community-minded players but they're like all alt-right virgins. seriously just hang out at wintertodt for 5 minutes and you'll figure out where all the "we pay no gay" degenerates went to
---
And I’m over here with just the pet at 150kc.
---
The problem with gmaul is it only gives you 1 chance of a KO per fight, which makes it really boring and RNG-heavy. With dds you get 4-5 specs per fight. The more KO chances you get, the less RNG plays a role. Even worse, many gmaulers tab soon after they gmaul spec, since they realize they have little KO potential after their spec, so if you’re using dds you can’t even get in the 4-5 specs before your opponent tabs.
---
Basically gmaul makes pking extremely boring and RNG-heavy. Removing it is necessary to make pking not so stale and 1-dimensional
---
drop chance had been removed in a previous update
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

If you don't trust the link (always be wary of links that lead you pages that ask for your info), look for "Forgotten Registered Email" on the official OSRS website's support pages.

r u in the dungeon under the statue in the middle of kourend? if you are youre just unlucky cuz i think its 1/200 off everything except ghosts for some reason 
---
Hm are Bots?
---
Thank you Maz for the quick response!
---
Yes back in rs2 I walked everywhere and just attacked anything on sight. I just used entangle + tb at edge, if either of those failed I consider the pk "failed" and moved on to next target.
---
I'm getting around 50% now too since the new seeds are going to normal prices. But my sheet and most others fail to factor in uniques and only use the standard table. Uniques are where the big drops should come from, not a 1% of 2M in Herbs. The current uniques aren't doing the best job at this, but they plan to revisit drop table last this week and seem interested in polling new uniques.
---
That said, her drop table was never meant to have big drops, to begin with. It was meant as a slight profit increase with some food to help you with the task. If it never had 2M herb drops, I doubt anyone would be saying it needs big drops since that was never what was mentioned or polled. I think it is fine if it is just smaller drop and no big 1M+ drops; the point is a bit more profit and more points and it does that fine.
---
Aye mate been doing as many tasks there as I can, I use a house teleport to zeah and go under the statue, am I for real just this cursed?
---
Whatever you say, you're so smart. 
---
that still does not explain where the line is, is it when you share the account? if so a lot of youtubers would be outta jobs :)
---
That rug really ties the room together.
---
They weren't really "lame," just a product of their time. The cooking guild was from a time of no grand exchange and where it was actually challenging to scrounge together 10k from selling times to general stores.
---
Defenders are fine. How much content do you really need from a guild?
---
Claw seems to be 1/1000 from other peoples’ data, leather also seems to be 1/700 so not bad rng but not the best
---
The fake country accent was a bit off putting.
---
That's pretty much perfectly how they look ingame
---
Me too. A nice rug can really tie the room together.
---
But what possible could I have said to go from no offfences dealing with language/scamming to perm?
---
Maybe its just me then. 
---
Personally I would love to see a tournament minigame in the same way that DMM ends, but with maybe 16 people? Winner wins like 2m or something. It wouldn't be an overpowered money maker. 
---
On the contrary, decreasing max HP to 80 (in pvp) and removing gmaul would make pking a lot more fun. People only camp full hp in fights because of gmaul anyway.
---
I’ll be sad for you buddy. Hounds blow 
---
I have 26M Slayer XP so I’m not bothered about efficient XP per hour at this point. Having completed 1600 tasks at Nieve and Duradel, I found Konar to be a refreshing change of scenery and seeing loot from her drop table. I wish they would change it and add some rare and useful uniques though. 
---
Usually I upvote your comments just to be the odd one out, but not sure I can with this one... Unnecessary 
---
He gon learn to day
---
clueless about slayer? haha, okay mate. We're also talking about drakes here but toot your horn more pls
---
He botted
---
Based MacinJoshApl
---
yeah dude youre cursed lmao, have you gotten and dark totem parts? those are same drop chance
---
Ignorants, yea.
---
I bought it a while back and haven't used it at all
---
Totem pieces are a guaranteed drop from superiors, you haven't gotten a single superior?
---
I just used 10b as an example. I have no clue how much wealth is out there. I’m sure there is a string of Mules out there who could be running bot farms and have way more than 10b. 
---
Does anyone know what the most wealth owned by one person is?
---
Bruh just take your downvotes and gtfo lmao.
---
An evolution of combat if you will
---
Thanks man
---
That's how rng b
