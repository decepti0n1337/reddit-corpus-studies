Don‚Äôt you mean drarkes?

---
---
Definitely not. Even though this seems to be a pretty unique case and special set of circumstances, I doubt jagged will do it because it will open up a can of worms. Where will they draw the line in the future? Or was this truly a one-time thing? A lot of people would get and will get salty in the future about it. So to avoid navigating the complexity of that issue you just don‚Äôt do it at all
---
I just want this to become a thing so I can throw on the gas mask and head out to the desert to cook up some good stuff.

Dear god.... I thought the OP said dragon spear. FML
---
Please could you add a feature so we can chevk our slayer task streak at Wildy Slayer whilst on a Non-Wildy task, and vice versa?
---

---
Currently gathering points for Herb Sack and I'm reluctant to pick up a Krystilia task if it ends up being like 11th and something I don't want...
---
It‚Äôs freaking amazing how I need to answer this same type of question with a similar graphic for work but with barrels of oil
---
That is the opposite of dope.
---
It would be cool to implement contract systems in some of the old skilling guilds. With that being said, I think it can easily become OP to do the contracts - farming is already borderline.
---
Ooooh thats a tough one. I LOVE my SGS and it saves me stupid amounts of supplies, but the torture is a pretty dank upgrade. 
---
Torture &amp; Prims
---
SGS is overrated, meta now is just use DDS spec
---
Well, the fact that they‚Äôre looking elsewhere for the best point to vote on, whether or not it‚Äôs a point pushed by an influential minority, is, in my opinion, a better alternative than giving up on a vote because you see the vote as too positive or too negative to incur any change due to your personal vote. This happens far too much: you‚Äôll see 90% and not vote because it‚Äôll ‚Äúdefinitely pass‚Äù, or you‚Äôll see 60% and not vote yes even if you believed it should pass because you think it‚Äôs too far gone.
---
People looking elsewhere for confirmation on what to vote for is exactly what I want. That‚Äôs called looking into a topic before voting(informed voting).
---
Does Nieve give out boss tasks? Or konar? I unlocked them with points a little while ago, but haven't gotten a single boss task yet. Do I have to do something else to unlock them?
---
OR they could use jugs (3gp) and turn them into jugs of water (19) in the same amount of time with the same amount of effort with objectively higher profit margins. There is absolutely no reason to do vials instead of jugs.
---
Bandos should be the last thing you buy. Focus on a solid weapon, torture, fighter torso, barrows legs, fire cape, and an imbued zerker ring. 
---
I'd keep it myself tbh. Rare drop and all that.
---
Yeah that tag is a little different. I got it changed though, hopefully the strength bonus on this bad boy didn't get anyone in trouble
---
Love the osrs devs. Haters gonna hate, but I appreciate the team 100%
---
you can don't have to move around, you can just stand in one spot...
---
so apparently you like to be unfair and snotty to those who just want to relax and play the new content since release date.  At least the people who did runecraft before zeah potentially got better xp rates or profit. this poll is asking about a straight-up increase to drop rate
---
it doesn't give me the option to link my email
---
Back then, they were 1m but the economy wasn't nearly as inflated as it is today. That's why I said that by today's standards, the yh should be 10m. New content should be supplementing the existing content. If the even made a slight effort such as adding substantial enough sinks to keep these bosses alive, then I'd be content with it. The infernal axe and pickaxe were excellent updates imo. However, my point still stands earlier as to why I think that the slayer "instance" (isn't exactly as instance but close enough) should be removed. Yes, the wilderness bosses are far more cancerous than DKS but the bosses themselves aren't. They're safespottable but only hard due to their location in a PvP-enabled area.
---
That video was skewed to a large extent. I bought spins back in 2013 (which turned me into a hardcore conservative when it comes to updates and not wanting anything devalued). It takes time to spam redeem every xp lamp. However, they still devalued xp just as drop tables devalued skilling.
---
Before we go further, I will commend you greatly. No one I have disagreed to on the extent that we do has EVER managed to hold a civil conversation. As a matter of fact, it always turns into flame wars whereas this time, I actually learned something and still think that compromises are possible despite our differing ideologies and views on the game. I doubt it matters anyways since it's not like we're JMods arguing over how we should update the game but regardless, I've enjoyed having this intelligent discussion and have learned a couple of things from you.
---
If you look at the Inferno on a core level, it's not any harder than Jad. It's just a bunch of monsters that don't really have any special abilities (except for mages reviving shit and meleers digging). Corp at least has the dark core. Before pools, you needed to know how to tick eat and abuse other game mechanics just as you do in the inferno due to the massive amount of damage that you'd have taken otherwise in both of this content. The fact that it's become as easy as it has to kill this boss and is viable to solo on a much larger scale proves my point.
---
Who has the most wealth on an ironman then? Pretty sure Jagex admitted it somewhere but my knowledge over famous ironmen isn't high at all.
---
Is it in your POH menagerie? 
---
That‚Äôs most likely the reason my friend was banned, playing on the open hotel wifi. Honestly the only possible explanation as his account is not compromised. But idk it was just weird.
---
Alright, so it's like a pizza delivery?
---
Pay for the pizza, tip for the delivery?
---
Never was "instanced skilling" a thing (to my knowledge) in old runescape.
---
essentially. i have no idea what the cc is called though. sorry. 
---
Literally this lmfao
---
Nope
---
"DeliverItems" CC
---
Piggybacking to say the ability also doesn't apply to antipoisons when used on broodoo victims at Tai Bwo Wannai.
---
Shit, I'm only 1m off 99 range. Maybe I'll just sell it and throw darts for the last level üòÇ 
---
DPS calc doesn't take into account missed hits of course but you can lure the hydra while only losing 1t each attack if done correctly, only time you lose a lot of dps is flame special on 3rd phase if you aren't able to cancel it, assuming the person ranging is attacking while dodging it.   
---
Tl:dr You miss hits but extremely few if doing correctly and cancelling 3rd phase special
---
Can we do the same for the Mythical Cape?    
---
One of the most prestigious quests of the game yet it has the default teleport animation. 
---
Rekt kiddo
---
Should I ask there?
---
Auth delay Please, region Lock list, Email to inform me that someone is trying to access my account or changed my email/password would be great.  Trade lockdown should restrict you for 3-7 days your preference after recovered account.  I can't think of anymore...

that's gonna be a no from me dawg

jagex doesnt send an email when your account is locked....

Nope. Not at all

It came from jagex itself when I went to the main page and recovered my account from the site.

Completely agree. Him and Patrice had great chemistry. Joe Derosa and him had great chemistry too. So much laughs have been had listening to their chit chat.

Birdhouse runs? DS2?

Lmaooo what are you on about. You literally click every fishing spot after every catch and run to a new part of the island when the side you‚Äôre on despawns since there aren‚Äôt enough fishing spots in one location to fill your inventory. 
---
Sure, you could stay in 1 spot the entire time for very reduced xp rates but the method isn‚Äôt setup with that in mind. 
---
Vote no, it‚Äôs your voice. I‚Äôd rather not grind 100 hours for a cosmetic fish sack. But if that‚Äôs up your alley be my guest, majority of people would rather not though since it is a cosmetic. 
---
I take both. I switch to salve when killing skeletons
---
Only discussed with one ironman doing the same thing with lance but it's true that claw is rare and very likely to get as last unique not including pet
---
im sorry bug we cant trust jagex, hiding the polls puts way to much power in their hands.

And make pking even more profitable?

Isp has changed and doesn‚Äôt have my location. Only info he‚Äôs ever had is one password, which is definitely not enough to recover. He doesn‚Äôt know any original info cause I made him long after I made the account. Name is about it but he would need original members purchases, term length, original password, original address and isp during creation, etc. I know because I had to recover the account when he took it, and it took me weeks and multiple attempts to find all the original information and recover it for myself
---
Trident.. 
---
No one ever implied the cbow was made by the dragonkin.
---
And as stated, dragon is a good general term for all of them.
---
Then do lavas man won‚Äôt take you long at all
---
But sadly, we can‚Äôt use the trident spell on other players...
---
I'm in Oakland, CA and minimum wage is $11. this guy with $15 in mountain view isn't far from here, just a diff county. Minimum wage is different in each. I know San Francisco minimum wage is $15 also.
---
Trident = polypore
---
Wouldnt call kingdom passive xp because you have to cook them as per usual.
---
This would be a nerf in Cox as it probably wouldn't be usable for solos.
---
Trident isn‚Äôt able to cast on people right, or did I miss an update?
---
Trident is basically the same thing. Just not usable in PVP
---
upvote for spongebob costume
---
Lmfao I thought that was just a video bug and didnt actually impact the other people in the cell
---
I got 2 other people with this 3 times in a row the other day then...
---
I remember Polypore was usable in PVP, and thats what i tried to said thanks for replying btw!
---
I'm at 600ish tasks at 96, but it really depends on what tasks you do. Nechryels are like a 60k xp task, whereas a black dragon task is like 1k xp. Also I guess I have 1m xp from 5ish hydra tasks
---
Jagex are very, very good at listening to the community as a whole, i have no idea what you're talking about...
---
and if you don't want content creators to have any influence on polls, your options are: 
---
1. deal with it.
---
2. don't poll anything. 
---
that outfit is too typical tho; be original
---
No, it can't.
---
Lol. They already have a monty python reference with the Black Knight Titan
---
They should make the trident the usable in pvp
---
I literally count aloud and sometimes still Fk it up
---
Yea the seed vault feels like a band aid fix to the bank space issue. Not saying the game should be balanced around ironman, but for people who loot seeds from slayer, it really doesn't solve the bank space issue at all. Sure you could run to the vault after slayer tasks that drop seeds, but who really wants to run to the vault multiple times a day just to bank seeds before they can continue to train slayer?
---
Also it would be interesting to see how tree seeds are handled, because I know some people store all of these as saplings. 
---
games of chance isnt that like those dicer bots in GE? where they spam win 250k-2m roll 1-100.  
---
if you didnt log on account for a while, it might of been phished from a link you clicked ending up in botters hands resulting in this maybe idk.
---
If you‚Äôre absolutely sure you didn‚Äôt do anything, hopefully Jagex can fix this!  
---
The drops showed are just the ones I had room for add up to over 100m?
---
800 zulrah kills, so many boss tasks from slayer, multiple 2 man Bandos trips with many drops, 3 solo Kree‚Äôarra drops, one visage from slayer, pking loot etc. money isn‚Äôt hard to make if you play the game right and get a little bit of luck
---
I enjoyed using in in pvp with veng, but also it was a ragger weapon which was annoying
---
omg nerf all slayer monsters dae 9m drop insane!!!!!!! /s
---
Player-run gambling. Like the gambling bots at GE.
---
PLEASE I need to be able to cosplay as the mask from jim carrey's the mask
---
Even in real life mythology, Drakes, wyrms, and wyverns are considered types of dragons.
---
yes, it's my fault for being born into this world with siblings. Got it.
---
Next time i'm born i'll tell parents to not have anymore kids. 
---
Apu is cute
---
Christ 73 by the way
---
I‚Äôve never used them before though, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve clicked any links or whatever. 
---
One time I saw a guy call a purple dude ‚Äúthanos looking ass‚Äù and that has stuck with me since 
---
Also another option would be mind tiaras since you can tell direct to altar
---
It would‚Äôve taken a bit longer too. Mainly tried to cannon as many tasks as I could and go for faster xp. 
---
Exactly, it was a nice weapon for duo pking, or triple pking all of em polypore one on lunar one on ancient for the freeze and the other one teleblocking. You right it was a ragger weapon and it was annoying but more positive things about it then negative
---
if you imbue it bye bye dagganoth rings. why use them
---
No he loses lol
---
I went through every post until oct 1... you got a link? 
---
Special attack that totals to 20dmg would make the spec not even worth using as it would make the weapons dps lower. 
---
how do I fix that lol
---
For whatever reason whenever Graador dies it takes like 30 mins for his loot to actually drop. Any particular reason why he takes so long to drop shit as opposed to other enemies?
---
&gt; since Konar drop table only works for monsters over 100 combat (based on my understanding)? 
---
It works for monsters under 100 combat, it is just less common. 
---
idk what if you're an ultimate ironman
---
Funnily enough that quest is called the holy grail
---
Actually, my point was that it was an unreasonable estimate. Working with spaghetti legacy code is a genuine nightmare that I wouldn‚Äôt wish on my worst enemy
---
&gt; id gladly pay like 5 people to run for me at a time
---
That would cost you about 20M gp for 1 hour. 
---
Strong disagree here. Agility is a skill by itself and every moderately useful shortcut shouldn‚Äôt have to be put behind a diary.
---
Many people in the world have siblings that know where they've created accounts for games they've played as a kid. I literally have no control over the vast majority of the information that he knows.
---
Database breaches are incredibly common and I can almost guarantee we've all had atleast 1 breached account. I could of not told him my password but it's been breached several times by things that are out of my control. 
---
I mean, we know for sure Ash (for instance) can do engine work and is capable of getting big tasks done (ex. farming timer rework was like 1% of the entire osrs codebase?).
---
Hmm. Are you confusing Konar with Vorkath?
---
Pros - new big d defender
---
Cons - none
---
Lmao cry more baby boy
---
check the evidence behind the ban, if you can log into the account from main website. You wont be able to log in game but you should be able to login to check Message centre and account status. Check account status, and click the ban result they give you to see the evidence. provided.  
---
But jagex customer support is terrible so good luck
---
Only 1?
---
I guess this was a waste
---
It being BIS isn't a result of it being OP.  The alchemical hydra, for example, has really shit range defense.  And its other defenses are much better, stab being the second weakest (45 range def, 75 stab def, and 150 to slash/crush/magic).  That isn't range being OP, but the monster being made so that range is BIS.
---
How is that a contradictory statement at all?
---
That would make sense but leave an infinite amount of possibilities still. Can I conclude that you are saying fuck Guardian kill soldiers?
---
Don't be petty because your idea is fucking trash. Key binds save an entire click, this saves no clicks and does nothing. 
---
As someone who already has the elite diary and tons of points to keep spamming hydra, I agree with you this is really overkill. Hydra boss is fine, we don't need to give it a ton more shit.
---
&gt; Drakes/wyrms/hydras should have the noted bones. 
---
I agree with all besides normal hydras. This will still devalue some of the uniques from the boss since they share some of the drop table. So I say just make the other two get noted and the maybe add something else for normal hydras.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure half of the active playerbase is keeping these gold sellers in business
---
yeah i mean if your going to lie about buying bonds then i can see shitting on people but when they are honest about it then people should not be dicks about it
---
Alright a few things here. The only "end game" content balanced around prayer flicking is the inferno. 
---
As for the new slayer monsters the hydras don't even have a melee attack style mobs and boss included. SO no they don't punish you for using melee. Also with the dragon hunter lance you can match twisted bow kill times on the boss. 
---
As for downsides for using range. Blowpipe is not a cheap weapon to use just saying. Otherwise bolts are pretty well outclassed by melee. As before the introduction of the twisted bow melee was the way to clear fight caves in the fastest times.
---
theres a guy right outside the cave
---
Yeah there‚Äôs a guy outside to claim ur shit back lol 
---
thank you so much

You still need access to original email to change it tho, unless you go through the way the hacker in this post did which was a pretty advanced social engineering attack.
---
idk  really, you're out of luck if you trying to contact them because jagex support doesnt exists unless a mod comes out of the shadows every now and then to post on reddit and thats rare occasions on accounts with high value.
---
90-100m is a lot to me,if i was this in error, my best shot would be making a twitter account and messaging some customer support mods on their to see if they can assist.

Agreed. It's definitely a great item for killing dragon and it needs a buff to be viable.

much better idea, support

That hydra needs to put on a bra. üò≥
---
I'd be happy with case sensitive passwords

thank you for your service 
---
True, also there are other ways to solve the ragger problem. Like a mandatory 40k risk after your plus 1 to attack someone or something
---
H
---
Why would I ever use the longrange attack?
---
Exactly, would be cool as fk if the old polypore comes back 
---
not sure but cant see dark totem.  
---
if you combine all pieces to make totem, they will start dropping again, I usually take totem pieces with me to tasks if a superior pops i can make it on spot to get additional piece drops.  
---
nice tab though
---
Yeah, I really don't get the argument.
---
It might be "well its overwhelming in this direction so I'll skip it" but you're answering the poll question anyway?
---
"It influences your vote!" How easily swayed are you? Beyond that, major streamersbare going to swing the vote in their favor everytime so shouldn't THAT be the big controversy? 
---
What are you using right now?
---
Yes its bis but the sheer cost to use it doesn't make it really worth it everywhere it can 3x hit
---
Damn wiki. Making me lose XP. Thanks!
---
Good grief, rare indeed!!!
---
Done, on my way lol. Just got Black Demon task. Thanks for the info man!
---
Try attack hood. 
---
Not gonna lie I forgot my pin literally 30 minutes after I used it and my dumb brain refused to remember until the reset had gone through. 
---
Tons of good info to compile, many thanks guys!
---
you are such a child
---
Gloves dont match but otherwise, Nice.
---
Thoughts on adding skilling items for other slots aside from just upgraded main hand tools? There are the 5% xp outfits and maybe a few neck slots, even fewer rings. PvM requires constant gear upgrades and are awarded good money-making. Skilling being bad money is why the Konar drop table caused an uproar. You guys really need to kill two stones with one bird here.
---
It would be nice to have an option (Jagex client) to be able to tag items so that if I were to search my bank with a key word like "farm" the items I've tagged with "farm" will pop up. This will make withdrawing them so much easier than searching the bank for them. 
---
Wow can I touch your internet points? 
---
League
---
Can the Jagex client mini map be updated to where I can scout Chambers of Xeric. It sucks not being able to scout without using a 3rd party client for my team and for solo raids.
---
I think this is a RL thing, I use animation smoothing and GPU render, i see this happening there, i also use the main client on my craptop, don't notice it there.  
---
Unfortunately I idolized soup 
---
you could make it not kick them immediately giving them a warning, or just not at all. the same issue could occur with being removed from friends list, right?
---
On principle I agree completely but really it's such a tiny impact that I don't think it's worth any real dev time. Maybe chuck in an extra 2 flat damage every time anyone gets hit by anything so level 3s can't do multiple rounds on a cake, but it's not really worth much more effort.
---
Honestly, that's fair 
---
rune pouch is both, and both kind of makes sense to me anyway.
---
Yeah 30k an hour is such a big change 
---
If i had my account to do over i absolutely would've gone for an sgs before purchasing any other gear, literally. It's so helpful for basically anything slayer or bossing related. Once you get one yo'll never sell it and wonder what you ever did without one.
---
instructions unclear, dick stuck in loot bag
---
You realize we invest thousands of hours into a game for basically internet points ?
---
..and no you cant 
---
No it was fuckin op as
---
Thank u kind sir 
---
Anyone else support this idea...? 
---
I'm OK with removing normal boots and having noted bones in replacement. They killed Brimstone and granite boots with that reward. 
---
Are you sure you are even banned? Jagex do not send you emails when you have committed an offence.
---
I'd be cool with slightly less xp an hour in favour of more QOL. Like in 3 hours or something the other day I put up 260k of experience, I'm sure my numbers are slightly off, but the sentiment being that for time invest the XP for the highest level of tithe farm is very respectable. 100 Hours of tithe farm is easily 6m experience if you do the 5 plot technique, so I say knock that 6 million down to like 5-5.25 million and add the water option so you rotate through after planting by just clicking the thing.
---
Maybe that isn't fair enough of a trade off but overall I back your idea of QOL for tithe farm intensity. Genuinely by the end of that little grind I did for my seedbox I was 100% burnt out of doing it and am not looking forward to returning for weeded patches and the farming outfit.
---
Time to change what they can assign. 
---
Support but GP cost to be set at cost of dbones + 20M/hr it would take to use those dbones at a gilded altar.
---
Lol wat
---
At the moment f2p does not have any decent methods to get money for bond, but you could grind ogresses (which drops few rune items) until you have obtained enough money to buy one.
---
I did it my first try and tanked like 3 hits from jad lol
---
Hi it sounds like your guild could use some more epic players to increase those numbers. I'm willing to join and already smashed the skulls of many slayer tasks with my Torag's Hammers.

You can find me meditating on top of White Wolf Mountain on world 358 if you wish to talk.

The seedbox should really get the rune pouch treatment, where if you pick up a seed that is in the seedbox it automatically goes in to the seedbox. AFAIK, it still doesn't work that...
---
Yeah this game is becoming more and more fantasy and less medieval fantasy. Im in too deep to quit now though unless eoc comes out
---
Thought I was in the wrong sub when I saw 25 buttholes
---
you get avas through questing, and god capes through mage
---
&gt; Can we plz get a bank chest in our POH.
---
That's OP.
---
Range guild is about completely useless, aside from maybe a clue scroll there isnt any point to go. I'm not sure how you could go about fixing it, could maybe make it a way to imbue archer ring since they want to get rid of it at nmz but I'm not sure what else 
---
What a great response. Thanks for being so transparent with the community
---
So create the30 day delay option only after the pin has been set for a month
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm actually surprised people are trying to play it off as if the monetary value of the drop was the issue. When it never was at all. 
---
Then give people more storage and show less items in the bank at once? 
---
Or even create a second bank that has separate storage.
---
Efficiently doing KQ is locked behind a pray req that‚Äôs just a number they randomly selected. Like I think the elite diary itself has good requirements but no pk oriented build is going to realistically go over 77 prayer 
---
I'm with you fellow globetrotter!!!
---
I let them kill me, and they usually say like ‚Äúsit kid.‚Äù And then I run back in and take the lobsters that I left when I died
---
What was the xp per hour like?
---
Better to have something be underwhelming at the start and adjust it as more data is obtained than to have something way over tuned and slowly nerf it.
---
hydra makes me feel like a retard when i cant count to three
---
I invested into like 50k calquats thinking that they‚Äôd be used for the new farming patches protection payments. They weren‚Äôt, so I lost like 10m lol
---
High level pvmer checking in, haven‚Äôt gotten any special loot from hydra yet.. or hit konar drop table
---
Mm2 isn't that bad lol. Just a little bit of aids mixed in with it.
---
I never realized that people actually received gold after paying for this. I thought it was just a straight scam, as opposed to straight cheating.
---
look what u did 
---
Yes.
---
Yeah, I usually wear nothing but the default clothes, a backpack, dramen staff, and either a crown or a cavalier.
---
the world needs less shitty art
---
Go to a pvp world. 
---
Well, you probably couldn't.  Asides from use passwords you haven't told him before, but I understand they are probably old passwords now anyway. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for more security, but for most people that information (ISP, really old passwords, etc.) would only be known by them.  So these are not bad security measures normally, it's just unfortunate for you that your brother is an ass hat.
---
That's actually not too far from the truth about how it rolls the drop tables.
---
Any data on elite clues ? 
---
Hydra not 5m an hour. I‚Äôve been farming like mad and definitely not that much especially after supplies are added in. I don‚Äôt think they should update it at all tho cuz it‚Äôs good how it is rn
---
maybe i'm wrong because i haven't done it in probably over 10 years... but couldn't you still just do a forgotten password request and reset it via email?
---
Please add an option for ironpeople to use items on the collection log to add items they obtained before the collection log was introduced.
---
lolllll
---
Best in slut*
---
Same
---
I run with the shayzien armor 5, but i replace the helm with a frog mask and wear the ardy cloak
---
if u die to normal hydras after dying to hydra boss maybe you shouldn't be killing hydras
---
So people who play fortnite are also, stupidly autistic 
---
It's clear as day, the dead giveaway is jagex is in the UK, so they wouldn't even mention state laws. 
---
The FBI would like to know your location 
---
We‚Äôre leaking again. 
---
Christ, how could we leave out the eagles? They saved middle earth
---
yes
---
Yeah let's let autism flow through the entire universe
---
92-72=35
---
He'd make the perfect drunken dwarf NPC.
---
Incredible.

We all looked forward to this new Kebos update. A new high level boss with a BIS item along with a new Dragon hunter lance. But my concern is why is every world an instance and not like previous slayer bosses with only a few rooms per world or an instance that if you want to take the risk you‚Äôd lose everything. I know they wanted another money sink at 100k per death but for game integrity why not keep it the way it always has been in terms of slayer bosses. You would either fight for one of those three rooms, take the risk in the instance or do your task on the lower level versions of the boss. It has worked fine for Thermy, Cerberus and Kraken why couldn‚Äôt it have worked here. Now you have high tier items entering the game a lot faster then usual, along with vast amounts of raw gp from alchs also entering. A drop table with profit made purely off uniques and enough gp to pay for supplies is what slayer has always been about. 
---
So elegant. 
---
I bought a hasta and a dfs for a blue dragon task then took a hiatus. When i started playing again fossil island had just released and i sold the pair for a 4m profit.
---
When will people learn no proper fit has a skillcape and hood combo? Need to accent that shit.
---
Nah, how about 1000 soul runes 10,000 mind
---
NERF! 
---
Going to continue until either the claw or slayer points are out.
---
Good luck to you too.
---
What master you using? I spent about 2k points and did around 40 tasks on top of that and only managed hydras once
---
Buncha wyrms though
---
Well I think instancing saves them money because if it wasn't they would eventually need to add more worlds because a lot of people would complain about over-crowding. I see what you're saying but I think it just makes more sense to instance things like this.
---
I like that. 
---
To the top!
---
They are still shit xp/hr because of their high defense and HP.. 
---
Hey today is my birthday too, turned 19, happy birthday man!
---
F
---
How much money was lost by those banned accounts?
---
Ayy, I've been doing it with the same setup my pbd is 56, I haven't done any runs in a bit, what's your def lvl?
---
But who here actually counts out loud when doing hydra? Got some weird looks from family members, when doing some hydra during a family get-together Sunday. "Why is he counting to 3, for the last 2 hours?"
---
Agree
---
I would be fine if they added the ability to use a more complex password. A-z and 1-9 is not near enough. Add special characters to list possibilities. And make them a minimum of 12 characters. 
---
&gt;They have obtained various pieces of key information relating to the account, likely over a period of several months, sufficient to submit a credible recovery request. Information included log in, creation date, creation ISP, creation location, postal code and some passwords - with some of this information stretching back over a number of years. 
---
All of this is not particularly hard to acquire for anyone who is an acquaintance of the account owner. Old passwords aren't exactly hard to come by these days, and are pretty easy to find if you know the person in real life (especially if the account dates back to childhood years). I have plenty of acquaintance from school days who knew my logon username (from back when it was the same as your ingame), where I live/d, isp (not many options in most areas), etc. Old password leaks, or maybe careless sharing of childhood passwords and they're good to go? 
---
I can't agree with you. Maybe for a random stranger it'd be hard, but this information is impossible to keep secret from everyone. ESPECIALLY considering the fact that lots of people pick the game back up from their childhood accounts. 
---
Because then they have to balance based on tbow holders, not the other 99.99% of rs.
---
Haha the crystal how was sick looking way back when
---
I honestly feel that as an Ironman, these skills are almost entirely worthless. I work hard to get 20 defence to then look at smithing and realize I need 61 smithing to make a full set of Mithril armor? That would take a full week of purely mining/smithing... whereas I can simply spend a couple hours thieving and simply come up with the cash to go and buy it... smithing is pointless for Ironmen in regards to obtaining armor.
---
Because anytime you try to recover or any account security it takes you to the RS3 website versus the OSRS website. 
---
Lolololololololololololololololol how am i projecting my insecurities. I want to see this calculator. Bp might do more damage after you spec it good with bgs.
---
this has never happened to me. they always hop or crash lol
---
And when you all of a sudden start to count your blowpipe hits insted of hydra hits
---
Oh my how?
---
I‚Äôm kind of clueless when I come to computer parts, but couldn‚Äôt I just buy another 8gig stick and make it a 16 gig total? If it had the room for it?
---
Shut the fuck up retard
---
Is blast furnace really not a profit? Last time I checked steel profits dipped 200k an hour but all that is is just ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. 
---
No it isn‚Äôt. Look at the recent post of the guy that got hacked for over 5B. A Jmod confirmed that it was an account recovery with essentially a lot of stalking involved. 
---
Dude I was adding to the meme since he went out of the way to hide so much but left in the name.
---
have you seen the dragon harpoon?
---
Does anyone know drop rate
---
Good fight
---
update pls
---
That is an outlier. At no point should you be expecting to defend yourself from a company employee, that's up to Jagex to secure things behind the scenes. No amount of player controlled security improvements will allow you to stop a silent employee from using your data, as long as they can access it. Think of it like someone working for a call center and they sneakily write down your credit card number when you call in to pay over the phone. That isn't something you can really prepare for nor should you as a consumer be obligated to protect yourself from those attacks. Its up to the company to prevent such attacks, and last I heard legal action was being pursued against Jed as he definitely broke some laws. Items/GP were also restored in a break of protocol because in this circumstance Jagex was 100% at fault for the compromise.
---
What is being discussed here is security to avoid other players hijacking your account, and from my personal testing I found that unless you have access to the parent e-mail they are very limited in what they can do. To remove an authenticator or change your e-mail the only link that allows this is sent to your parent e-mail. So like account HoopyDoop may be compromised but as long as they cannot spoof your local machine ID/ip address the authenticator should block them from logging in. Then when they try and reset the authenticator your phone should immediately blow the fuck up with someone else tried to log into your e-mail. E-mail 2FA is pretty fucking good, almost too sensitive at times but I appreciate more security then less.
---
Ideally add the authenticator to the website as well, but they still aren't physically able to log into the game even if they can on the website as long as your authenticator is still functioning. To remove the authenticator you need e-mail access.  Getting into my Runescape account and taking off the authenticator would have me way more concerned about my e-mail being compromised then the actual video game. 
---
If any hacker can access your e-mail with the same password as your Runescape account you need to reconsider your cyber security approach, your social media passwords should never even closely resemble your e-mail/banking passwords.
---
Wow nice one. Now you stop hurting yourself. 1150kc fuuuckk
---
Seems like he literally just bought the most expensive item he could wear in every slot lol
---
It actually cured her retardation
---
Can you please buff the dragon Hasta? it is currently useless.   
---
Possible ides would be :  
---
 \- give hasta +68 stab , 60 str and remove special attack  
---
 \- give dragon shortsword the old dragon hasta spec  
---
This make leaf bladed sword, dragon shortsword, and dragon hasta all viable w/o any being overpowered
---
Also one last question because you seem very knowledgeable with this type of stuff! It had a option for a 1050 ti graphics instead of this for 50$ cheaper. Would it be a good idea for me to go with the 1050 ti for 690 instead?
---
üôåüôåüôå
---
I like your cat.
---
What's that right hand doing? OwO
---
Notice how they only reply to the 'i lost my 5b on my max' rants
---
The point is there wasn't a Dragon Hasta. But it is actually better than it needed to be. It isn't as good of a stab weapon as a Dragon Sword, but it is currently one of the best Crush Weapons for the Level 60 range. Also, it did get a unique special attack instead of reusing Shove again. Not the best special, but fairly unique. And most importantly, Fashionscape...
---
Chopping magic logs all the way to 99 would be great money, but very slow.
---
Completely devalue my 10k RC exp account. Thanks jamflex
---
Why use rune darts? Use Adamant. They‚Äôre 1/10th the price for -1 max hit.
---
I‚Äôm making by far the most money from any slayer boss. 
---
A. They stated that Trawler would still be faster and B. Trawler is doable solo 
---
TBH though even seeing one is the lucky part but catching and looking one you almost always get shit they should rename it super rare impling with mundane rewards 
---
Would you rather they get rid of it and there be no dragon hasta at all?
---
Because that's how it was before. 
---
Sell it back lol 
---
So you are justifying buffing a 5m gp per hour method to a 6m+ because mid levels with mid level stats can make 500k an hour off gargoyles? Lol
---
Congrats on the level. She‚Äôs a keeper üëç
---
So they created a giant red penis on a stick for fashion scape and because there wasn‚Äôt a hasta lol. Ok so there is no point lols. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt WoW do this? And a bunch of other games?
---
I was overseas training iwth the Army for a few months, and one month we spent in Thailand. I was able to go out on a "cultural day" and as we were being bussed back to the Thai Army base we stayed on, the driver stopped the bus in the middle of the street (yeah) and went to a roadside fruit stand and bought bags and bags of all kinds of fruit that he sent us on our way with. I brought some back to the aid station that that was the first time I had ever seen, heard of, smelled or tasted a dragonfruit and it was THE BEST THING EVER.
---
Go commit inventory restocking
---
Implying people with 95 Slayer have friends
---
True. Although zammy isn‚Äôt as profitable as it was before the Kebos update. Spears crashes back to 10m the day before the update went live. Still a good boss to do with a 1/128 drop rate but the allure of an 18m spear is no longer there. 
---
tfw a buff from a diary was supposed to make you gain 10% more gp but it just makes it a requirement to make the same gp/hr as before.
---
Also advertise the Authenticator in-game. I only know about it from reading this sub. Setting up and playing my account, I didn‚Äôt visit the official website once.
---
CA minimum wage is $11/hr foe under 26 employees if your workplace has 26+ employees then the minimum wage is $12/hr. It's gonna keep going up till 2022 I think. But its getting ridiculous
---
What software do you use for drawing these? You should maybe do a timelapse video/gif some time, that might be neat.
---
Pet off maple tree at 71 btw
---
What are the rest of your stats?
---
what's that ?
---
Damn man, fking sucks, don't think there's anything else we can do if Jagex doesn't have people working night shifts.
---
99 slayer used almost 3.5k points on skips done 60+ konae tasks no hydras. Bs game
---
Imagine if we had more than one finger.
---
Hahahah
---
So do I, especially for polls that don't concern me / don't interest me.
---
I.e. pvp polls etc. 
---
I don't really care one way or another as long as it isn't clearly a bad thing for the game and would rather those niche communities get what they desire. 
---
I can't really do that as easily with poll results being hidden. 
---
Dude what? For the same reason we have dragon sword, dragon 2h, dragon battleaxe, dragon armor... 
---
Obviously it isn‚Äôt supposed to be BIS, it‚Äôs an intermediate weapon. If you have the money and stats for a zammy hasta, don‚Äôt buy it
---
thanks for trying to help anyways. at this point it doesnt feel like there is much to do...  he hasn't logged back in yet.... I hope he does
---
Moms bank account stood no chance.
---
Can never do agility again. 
---
Asuh, duh.
---
But that's where i put my rings.
---
If you only need your Def to go up, why train with a staff üòÇ
---
Oh look dead content
---
Sweeeeeeety
---
Can we please add bigger clickable buttons for chat dialogue options on mobile?
---
Not a bad idea. 
---
Catch me voting no on everything here. Why are these all horrible ideas
---
I‚Äôd like this. The guild trader system(for the unfamiliar: guilds bid on locations weekly) has led to some pretty unsavory behavior in the community.
---
And good god, it‚Äôs terrible to buy things on consoles.
---
well the staff is 3 million gold, it's the best one i can use, and im hitting crabs
---
Apparently it is a 1 in 12 chance from what i heard. But that may ne incorrect.
---
42 everything, 89 magic
---
1/16 relatively
---
Are you a fellow victim of Charter?
---
The problem with melee comes from the way prayer and armor works imo. There aren't strong incentives to be in melee range during most pvm content and face an additional damage style. And defensive bonus on armor aren't enough to matter.
---
Take hydra for example, all but the first hit of damage in the fight is blockable by prayer and movement during the fight. However if some little level 100 hydras came in during the fight and meleed you then maybe your defensive bonus would matter and people would use DHL.
---
DKS is a good example of content where defense matters since those little spinylops hit you the whole time.
---
Basically less prayer reliant fights will improve melee more than a dps buff will imo
---
Thanks for reiterating OPs post, didn‚Äôt understand it til i read yours. 
---
Yeah go from a basically risk free death to actual risk free death with an agility shortcut. Why do you need to make everything easier????
---
Allow us to cut off Konars face and attach it to the slayer helmet.
---
best in slit
---
Everyone is on their own timeline my dude. Can't be mad at them for not being at your speed just like others can't be mad at you for not being at theirs, ya dig?
---
1/17.6 if you kill all six brothers
---
Not sure how efficient it would be but you could always burst defense xp 
---
So you can't use dragon scimitar/whip? 
---
Your friend sounds very skilled at the game
---
Why is everyone getting defensive over this post. I bought it used it laughed about how bad it is and alched it. Who in their right mind will use it. That‚Äôs all I want to know. 
---
Yeah I tried a little bit of gorillas but after only 1 shard in 1600 kills I blocked them again 
---
I thinks it's more along the lines of people who can't make decisions for themselves and hear X streamer say something needs nerf and they mindlessly agree. 
---
i wouldnt be opposed to full set bonuses, itd bring a bit of diversity to pking and also drive the prices for some otherwise unused items like a lot of helm pieces up
---
Who the fuck are you?
---
Should be around 1/16. It's just a bad luck streak, that's how RNG works I'm afraid. 
---
I've done ~150 chests and only had 5 items. Longest drystreak was like 63 but some people get dry streaks well over 100 chests long. Just keep persevering
---
Its 1/17 if you kill all brothers. You‚Äôre unlucky and he is lucky
---
I don't know hockey but I know some of the players, so they've been funny. But I don't get this one. 
---
Do you think cadantine would work too?
---
Can the growth timer for Hespori be reduced?
---
Waiting 32 hours for 2 seed rolls with an ever-growing stockpile of Hespori seeds feels too long.
---
Dude gz! &amp; Good luck on future loots!
---
Did the same with the Lance myself. Got one to test and it crashed 20m before I could sell it. 
---
made by pouring 2500 saradomin brews onto the regular fishing outfit  
---
you could also just pee on it
---
But the game hasn't changed as fast as it has in the last year. They keep adding new shit when they dont even fix broken existing shit. If they it this way I guarantee this game won't last too much longer. Like seriously, this game has so many problems that should be priority but it's not. Cant see OSRS going for much longer... before they open a new version of the same game..again..
---
Do you really believe that this is the smartest thing to say, especially since you‚Äôre asking mods to look into your account? I hope you get your account back, but honestly, you‚Äôre asking to get banned if they decide to look into your accoubt afterwards if they see this
---
Ok. 
---
I REALLY REALLY doubt anyone targeted your account for just that garbage. You must have given out your information in some manner whether you downloaded a RAT or logged into a phishing site.
---
For anyone reading this far down the chain that hasn‚Äôt tried Scullieceps, very highly recommend them. Low attention, 80k+ hour, plenty of fossils, numulite, the caps are a few k each, it‚Äôs great. 
---
Desert treasure II please
---
Should depend on the estimated gp an hour hydra is and make it a bunch of levels higher 
---
You are better off getting like level 70-85s in your combat stats before you actually start slaying
---
All herbs are profitable at any level 
---
Isn't the other part to hydras if you cut off their heads, they regrow... Sometimes more than you cut off. But they could have required you use a Slash Weapon to cut off the heads but that would have felt a bit forced and not really flow well in the fight. Perhaps it Alchemical nature makes it unstable so as it is hurt, its heads fall off?
---
i have the same problem and i have 100% shayzien. you simply can't attack or get slayer exp from shamans in kebos swamp when on this task.
---
Ok, stop using that and get a bribe sabre, it has a better attack bonus, slightly less strength and it will hit much faster. Use that at sand crabs
---
Is not like he has anything good going on in real life anyway, might as well show off in a game.
---
Yeah that is kinda true, but you get more money once you go 70 and above, you could camp Kurasks at 70 etc. 
---
Nice censor mr. 78 ppoints
---
If you leave to bank you gave up the world. Sorry. Get an alt.
---
Surely they could make it so you could recover or make account changes only using the IP that you are currently using as an option? This makes your account secure but recoverable.
---
Pretty well versed in cyber security (thanks to my dad all my life) and don‚Äôt enter my info on anything or download suspicious downloads off the internet. And all my money is drained sooo 
---
That was a scam for a while
---
Ferocious gloves btw
---
This is a bit left field but I think it's the most secure, and most reliable way to secure our accounts.
---
Setting up our accounts to accept bank transfers. Then the account can only be recovered with a small (say 5 cent) (and refunded) payment.
---
The only way an account can be recovered is if the bank details registered to the account match the details of the small payment transfer made during a recovery request.
---
And if your bank account is not secure you probably have bigger things to worry about. 
---
No, sorry
---
I thought it was dumb that you paid for arrows that you lost even if you picked up every single one. And magic was dumb because you can splash. 
---
I was young then
---
i think he's taking the piss
---
With the release of pearl fishing equipment it has made me wonder if we can see a similar mechanic transfer to other skills. For example Percy selling an equipping hammer for 200ish gold nuggets.
---
I get 35k slay exp an hour cannoning greater demons with blowpipe while safespotting them. That‚Äôs not a bad task. Should switch the greater demons with wyrms on block list.
---
I got it on 59kc
---
Sounds like OP messed up his account. 
---
Buying calls on lance right now
---
Wow, you just solved runescape. What an intellectual! Hire this man!
---
Instanced skilling areas for Aerial Fishing is kind of ridiculous. Of course a new method is going to be crowded, it's new and a disproportionate amount of players want to try it. Yeah it's a bit annoying for now but we're not babies, we can handle playing next to others
---
Won't happen. 
---
Link?
---
I was thinking the same I don‚Äôt know why he has them blocked. I think In the last 100 tasks I‚Äôve done I may have gotten them 3-4 times. That‚Äôs 90-120 slay points for skip. Totally worth it. He can block a more common task that‚Äôs just as shitty.
---
Yea racism really warms my heart
---
If these are tradable it will destroy slayer as we know it
---
That‚Äôs not me.. or is that what I want you to think?
---
Nah bruh youre thinking of Perry the platypus.
---
No way! My grandfather is zemina! He wouldn't make me a cake for any of my achievements though. He always thought I would make up a story on an internet forum and make him look really silly. RIP Grandpa! (Zezima) Miss you so much
---
There's a guy at the GE
---
Looks amazing, but it's not attainable right?
---
Wtf we didnt poll Konars boob size or drakes tail length. Grow up
---
Isn't this useless considering fertile soil exists?
---
Fletching is a loss in the beginning, but if you do yew longbows from 70-85, you make about 3 mil, and then 85-99 magic bows is about 15 mil
---
You accidentally got 4 def levels??? How
---
I mean, you need high combat stats as well...
---
So if you take a break and I hack you then actively play you want to not be able to recover your account until I quit?
---
D
---
I always tell them I have nothing. They continue to get my bones
---
Forgot what sub I was on... was not disappointed
---
Just go to 416...
---
think its like an hour and a half? something like that.
---
one of the two new quests.
---
Genuine question. Maybe I‚Äôm just slow because I‚Äôve thought about it for a while but can‚Äôt seem to figure it out.
---
Would you mind giving a brief explanation as to why it‚Äôs an integrity issue that they don‚Äôt hide poll results? I don‚Äôt get it 
---
jerked off the fetus 
---
Thank you ma brother!
---
Not in the abyss area..
---
ok tysm for the info
---
And the black mask?  I only ask caus its like 1/104 for falador guards post diary.
---
The logic goes that people won‚Äôt bother to vote for what they want if they can see their vote is going to lose
---
ok ty so much for the info
---
I'm new, but I've stopped playing temporarily because I've lost my old phone, and I'm currently using iPhone 5 which can't play OSRS. I'm sorry. Also, I'm on my duty helping r/houkai3rd. Until then, we'll meet each other someday and fishing together.
---
I think my IGN is Starlight236VN.
---
also how tf am i supposed to join if i do not know the damn link to the page
---
Isn‚Äôt that for meds? Cave horrors are hards 
---
This is great!
---
It's a shame that RuneMetrics isn't supported by osrs.
---
Things like this would be amazing if you could just enter a username and query a completed quest list from an url.
---
why the fuck are those steel arrows highlighted pink. that's for valuable stuff only
---
well, rn im there, and i noticed when aggro is gone, its not bad. 
---
It's meant to be a demi-boss with difficulty comparable to the crazy archaeologist, not an exceptional challenge.
---
its true tho
---
The finger grease on my ex's phone screen was how I was able to confirm he was cheating on me. 
---
Should have washed your hands more you nasty fuck
---
Finally someone in here knows what they‚Äôre talking about haha. Greaters feel like such a huge waste of time for how common and unrewarding they are for both xp and gp
---
He wont be abele to get b-gloves with 50 attack he still has to do alot quests that give him attack xp
---
And then you got the real dedicated guys that start up the bot
---
Yes
---
devalues my barrow gloves as i wont want to use them anymore in catacombs
---
Do what I did and film a video of you playing on your account. If you can't get your account back show them the. Ideo of u playing well before u were hacked 
---
Aha now I know, your outfit looks sick man. Thinking about making something simular but don't feel like getting the shazian outfits... 
---
I don‚Äôt think the osrs dev team is involved in account security whatsoever, the best they could do is try push it with the higher-ups. 
---
Pro: would then actually match the Fishing skillcape 
---
(like how every other xp boost outfit matches its respective skillcape) smh
---
The hell is wrong with you?
---
since when are miniquest supposed to give rewards?
---
You're a moron lmfao. 
---
It's super ez you kill the 2 lowest levels 5 times each takes 3-5 mins to kill them 5 times 
---
How Daero trick me like that.
---
Oh, so the usual then. Clicked away the moment I heard that "music".
---
Support. Fecal and blood sample should also be supported.
---
lmao you're that dude. but you don't really display the gloves being on; so only 5 str lost.
---
Ding ding ding. Thanks for the backup lol. I mean we had snowboarding ‚Äúlessons‚Äù but my lesson group was upper intermediate. We were learning park features and how to ride them, I just got unlucky and noobed myself into a neck brace haha
---
When your boss catches you playing OSRS mobile at work
---
I get iron dragons, but the rest? Damn. Dragon Boots, K'ril, Zenytes, Whips, and Fire Giants are decent afk xp.
---
You actually can melee them without taking damage, they attack at the same rate as you do with a whip or lance (4 ticks I think). So you can stand a step away, attack then when they attack you and step back again. That way they always range you. Of course this method is much more click intensive than blowpipe but you have to pay attention anyway so it's actually not bad.
---
Vine barrier!
---
I have received the same mail when i tried to get my account back since i started playing again! FeelsAmazingMan
---
I like this idea better than buffing more slayer monsters to be the thing half of us complain about.
---
Ooosh you're right. Perhaps Jebrim is Unidan v2
---
is she single
---
I don't think nerfing the drakes' special attack is the way to go. They do need to have something going for them, though, such as GP/hour, XP/hour, AFKability (obviously not that if you keep the special attack the same), or short task length (like dark beasts). That goes for the regular hydras and wyrms, too, which I admittedly haven't tried, but they seem to have the same problem of having nothing going for them. 
---
Why bot if you're gonna spend the free time you could actually use to play the game trolling around the osrs reddit. That's irony at work right there.
---
Needs a 75 agility requirement, the ladders we make at home obviously wont be as good.
---
i can confirm that the garg boss does drop KDT, and they have an increased chance iirc
---
At first I was like ‚Äúpoor guy.‚Äù Then I read all your comments. You deserve this, you ruin our community. 
---
humor 
---
Oh god dammit I did not want to know that..
---
Wait, really?
---
No, that's only when you are doing the Catch Combo method. With a Lure and no Shiny Charm, at a catch combo of 31, there is a 1/315 chance to see a shiny Pokemon. I'm unsure of the rates with a charm, but all it does is add an extra roll. 400's close though!

ice burst on defensive mode in the kourend catacombs. (on dust devils/nechs to make a little profit)

Boss?

Only if after ten headshots you get a tactical nuke.
---
the penance queen sure has been spending a lot of time with the ceremonial dagger
---
Ok I like the sound of this. Will look into it thanks
---
Until you die again... or a system update
---
Wondering the same thing about death runes
---
Did your account use a password that was also used for another website/service?
---
Did you have 2FA on your RS account? 
---
Hcim Vegen friendly.
---
i find it annoying seeing which jug is full or not.  
---
Plus i'm too lazy to drop the jugs even with shift dropping lul
---
Rune Pouch comes from "two" things... Slayer or (Wildy) Slayer. Unless you mean Bounty Hunter/buying emblems?
---
Blowpipe is nuts. Everyone with half a braincell on combat mechanics knows that speed is always "OP". That's why shortbows outclass longbows while using ammo several tiers weaker even.
---
Darts and knives were the pinnacle of speed, and they decided to release the blowpipe for some reasom. Most activities have blowpipe as BIS, if not it's still always viable alternative if ranged can be used at all.
---
I'd love to see a "double-defense-scaling" on it, making it significantly weaker in cases where the enemy is resistant to ranged attacks, making bows and crossbows more favourable.
---
Similarly, ballistas could get a "half-defense-scaling", making them more accurate on high ranged def targets (relative to other ranged weapons). They could be the big "tank buster" items.
---
No one quits osrs
---
Unpopular opinion, but I agree with this. 
---
Am only 80 rc too 
---
Love the rubber squeaky hammer. 
---
It is possible, i did it just reading about it on the wiki, and i found it really easy (I was 76 magic and 82HP when i did it). I used Staff of light and Staff of the dead, autocasting the spells made it so much easier. I think your main concern should be PKers rather than the bosses.
---
How about not accepting recoveries unless the account has gone inactive for  a couple of months or the recovery attempt was made from the original email.
---
yeah
---
I could've sworn back in the day that's how it used to be. I was very confused by the menu that came up when I was changing my clothing
---
Hey
---
Did you report this incident in game ?
---
People with 1 def and 50 hp got it so yea it's doable maybe just not all mobs in one go 
---
Don't suggest more cosmetic rewards making Jagex think we are OK with being rewarded with cosmetic items only through skilling..
---
0 gp/h btw.
---
Can I please have opinions about fighting hespori 13 Def 43 pray and 72 range? I'm not sure if I can beat it first try, perhaps someone else with similar stats has attempted
---
Can you swap the teleport option for the Warrior's guild and Farming guild on the max cape? Alternatively, allow us to set a favorite on max cape
---
Shut up serene. 
---
Ive heard thats how you maximize xp rates unfortunately 
---
I'm glad there is finally a Reddit post that isn't complaining about the drop tables and actually praising jagex for their hard work. It's nice to see
---
Or what?
---
Bruh
---
Ty kinda what i expected
---
Kinda looks like nikolas Cruz
---
Grotesque Guardians, K'ril, Cerb, Supreme as bosses. On reg tasks: dark beasts, abby demons, any metal dragons, fire giants, black/greater demons, hell hounds
---
better weightings of higher level ore. for example, the 85-99 grind usually returns about 3.5-4k runite ore, but in op's case he only got 2k runite
---
In F2P crashing is a way of life.  
---
This looks like its in a museum...what and where is it
---
That moment up realise you don't have to click the hydra after swapping prayers. 
---
1k mind runes? Sure. It's dirt cheap and common as hell.
---
100 soul runes? For every few teleports? That's 20 soul runes for eacb teleport. That's very expensive.
---
Yep, been using Keepass to autotype passwords for many years. Definitely works, though you may have to set up Window titles or turn off 2 channel obfuscation.
---
Nope, no bank key, thats why im weirded out.
---
Im running a scan on my computer right now, ill update shortly.
---
All of them
---
Better than my old setup https://imgur.com/a/4OMMrfq

Maybe this is because I been watching a movie a night but that looks exactly like a death eater! xD
---
I like agility, its my highest non-combat stat at 84. Maybe I'm retarded...
---
I went to the account page and it said unappealable ban and said I macro'd. It sent me to a rule page and I read what that was and I did none of that.
---
 I was just talking with random people and I died a few times trying to PvP so I just started picking up dead people's loot and then I got kicked off as I was picking up some food. 
---
9001 iq
---
How did this not get more attention? Every idea here I could easily see making it into the game. Best suggestions I've seen in months.
---
Probably a low blue light filter
---
Then whoever it was might‚Äôve realized they can just keep cleaning you as you make more money if you keep thinking it‚Äôs some weird glitch.
---
It‚Äôs obviously not a weird glitch. There‚Äôs no glitch that spawns you in the GE with all your items gone and Guam tar in your inventory.  You‚Äôre account is compromised somehow.
---
Set up a bank pin.
---
Shouldnt the girl be the dust devils

Perfect. I'm just coming up to start reanimating for the desert elite diary! Thanks.
---
Did your email account have 2-step verification as well? It‚Äôs all well and good having 2-step on your RS account, but if you haven‚Äôt got it on your email account itself then it‚Äôs still easy to get hacked

Jesus Christ, you've killed the Alchemical Hydra for nearly 30 hours in 6 days. That's some dedication man, congratulations.

---
Would it be possible to add a way to look at another players' stats on mobile?
---
They could easily explain the cannon not being placeable by the heat damaging the cannon so that would make sense tbh.
---
It‚Äôs pretty much right at the alch value.
---
Why would it cost more? You get one for free from the quest and can buy them from the bh store for 150k points.
---
You were lootbotting. That is a bannable offense! Just don‚Äôt bot...
---
You're not done until you get 100 headshots using  the thermal attachment to unlock the golden skin homie. 
---
I don't think white/yellow ever looks that good tbh, at least, light mystics doesn't. Looks like I have 2 bananas for shoulders, anyone else think that?
---
You are not allowed to pickup items on the ground? Why can I see them then and why am I allowed to pick them up if I get banned for it?
---
When I was 8 I would tie an onion to my belt.

just set chat to off fam
---
Some of these have unique teleports - all of them should do because they are good fun. 
---
Is there anyway to check trade history or check the IP's of my log ins?
---
what swiping on tinder or something?
---
Well that one is pretty obvious. When you move a drop like that from a raid to a slayer enemy that almost anyone can kill, the price is gonna take a nose dive
---
What is that overlay called?
---
Your virginity is showing. 
---
the best thing about this weird setup is that aside from a games necklace and a couple of bits of food (which I end up eating anyway) i risk ABSOLUTELY nothing aside from the myth cape if I get smited (which only drops 1k coins anyway)
---
Are you okay? ...
---
&gt; someone doesn't just casually stroll onto your credit card info
---
Nothing was mentioned about credit card info. And tbh, having so few people who know about your activities is probably more indicative of your lifestyle than anything else. None of the things I mentioned, except passwords, are secrets. Nor is it a challenge of great difficulty to come across passwords from up to a decade ago. Your personal story doesn't change anything about this.
---
And if that doesn't convince you, the mod literally claimed that they were partly at fault.
---
Your mind is a mystery to me.
---
what do you mean i just did? even without alts you probably shouldn't be at abbys. 
---
Why?

I hit 95 last night before I went to bed. Can't wait to finish work and see if I can get lucky with tasks.

You're assuming a noticeable amount of votes just mimic the current trend for the shake of it.

LOL
---
And if so, why are these votes less valid? xD 
---
Enjoy 1 acc 1 vote, i have 2 btw
---
No, There‚Äôs plenty jagex could do to not have stuff like this happen. Like actually doing their damn job and looking at the fact that the account was actively being played on by the owner. It‚Äôs not hard. 
---
A fuck up like that at my job would get me terminated. 
---
Edge Lord over here, look at you lmao.

Finished mine 480 with 8 total unsireds sorry

is playing RS what made you a virgin, or is you being a virgin the reason you play RS PepoThink
---
Just chill in a random YouTuber's cc like me and whenever someone crashes you call the entire cc to come anti crash. 10/10 success rate anywhere in the game if you have more than 5 people.
---
Damn. That was a clevet one. Good shit.
---
Now back to my farm runs cause boss left the room.
---
You can file a ticket on the support page mate. [Right here.](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new?ticket_form_id=177105) That's how I contacted and managed to appeal a ban on an account of mine which had been hacked.
---
Stupid idea
---
&gt;You can help them at best, but that's all you can do really.
---
Does your moral highground "I'm so offended" mentality prevent you from reading past the first sentence? The other guy did the same, I'm seeing a pattern here. 
---
The original drop table was absolutely fine, the only change if any that should have been made was to remove the sara brews and that's it.
---
People are way too quick to ree on this sub simply because one person receives a big drop, it's crazy. 
---
Don't tell people what to do
---
If you did this to me I'd bring enough people to make sure you didn't get a single kill lmao
---
Who cares. Pretty much all your comments are either about you saying you know a lot about botting and hacking or you saying you actually will bot or hack. This is justice.
---
Don't know why y'all getting so upset...
---
'you can't make someone stop doing drugs, you can only try to get them the help they need but ultimately it's their own choice to use or not'
---
Would you be offended if he said that? Because he basically did... Just substitute the subject... People are stubborn and won't change unless they want to. 
---
Repost fucking retard

This is now polled

The grind is real

Now imagine it was you on deaths door and the only person you had to talk to hit you with a "K" 
---
It is a Lance though, that‚Äôs, generally, what they look like. DHL is just made to look more of a ‚Äòhigh profile weapon‚Äô than a steel pointy cone on a stick
---
I prevented my girlfriend from killing herself, and while I had her pinned down on the ground I called the police. There is always more you can do, to an extent. For this guy, he's doing as much as he can and you're not helping.
---
What if they switch to a PvP world? What if they use a POH donation box? What about clan wars or the duel arena? If you can't drop valuables, can you alch them and drop the coins?
---
This is far too messy of a solution. 
---
Lol never
---
Don't tell him what to do
---
Please use the [new wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/), the old one (wikia) is no longer maintained and is trash.
---
When I did it for the first time, if I saw it go incredibly hot I would take 10 steps n/s/e/w to see what it said and take it from there. Goodluck! It was a bitch the first time but you will be happy to know that once you're done, the bosses are in the same location so you just have to remember them and when you lose your cape you can go get another easily :)
---
Do it right meow!
---
One jerk on Reddit hardly constitutes a decaying society.  Why so melodramatic?
---
Lol this is a pretty crappy situation that you found yourself in XD
---
I think your best bet would be to tank and run to another pillar
---
Meh, ive used RL for months, ~200m bank, no 2fa on rs, no 2fa on email. Not a RL issue more than likely, seems you were phished or ratted sorry, goodluck on rebuild :)
---
Because you're not adressing anything. We both agree on the exact same thing, which is that you can help them. You knew what I meant, but you are hell-bent on continueing being obtuse because I say things you don't like in a way you find offending. 
---
You could have a discussion on one's own responability towards one's life versus societal responability to maintain itself etc. but you and many others aren't interested in that, because "I'm offended,you're wrong, thus you deserve everything I'm going to sling at you".
---
But please, do continue. 
---
Or asks to show your haircut
---
And "PK" is our short for "Politically correct". So yeah... Politically correct bitch.
---
Ill try impliment that into my runs, cheers

their support is quite good
---
Enter dream, *dont move*. Pot up, afk. Repeat
---
You can‚Äôt just skip ahead like this!  I need to know if you killed Jad or not!
---
That's not the issue. The issue is that tasks on the same tier have the same weighting for rewards, but have vastly different growth times (e.g. Watermelons vs Palm Tree). It's always better to keep getting given Herb/Allotment patch tasks than Tree/Fruit Tree etc. tasks.
---
There also doesn't seem to be any punishment for dropping down for an easier (and shorter) requirement to then get another hard one after.
---
My buddy also got a Dragon Harpoon on his 7th kill of the new Wyrms 
---
There was a tweet of someone asking a jmod about if they‚Äôve ever gotten the same coins twice and the mod said physically they could see it or something along the lines. Most-likely to die with rwting and this not discussed in depth 
---
Loots with alt
---

---
Those are concerns for us too, and as Mod Steve W has commented on the high profile case you're talking about the hijacker knew a considerable amount of information. Its very easy, as someone not in that situation, to say you're perfectly happy with a week long delay (or whatever the timeline is) in order to add a delay to the removal of Authenticator. 
---
Once you're there though - your opinion will change. "But I'm the owner!" etc. Again, there is a reason that other companies don't do this and I don't personally agree this is a feasible solution for any of our departments which in turn means your security.
---
We continue to be invested in account security and will maintain our focus on doing our best to keep users accounts secure.
---
After your clarification, I can confirm that just wouldn't work. VPN's are easy to access and it would even help a hijacker, as they'd be able to keep trying to submit until they got to the right country. Lets make the assumption that most of our users are from places like the US and China - those countries are massive and locking down requests in this case would be pointless. As much as we'd like to be we don't have millions of members in countries like Sri Lanka which would make this more effective.

Could you change it so that tool leprechauns are displayed on top of players, and not the other way around? Would make it easier to note harvest on mobile when other players stand on top of the leprechauns.

Can‚Äôt you step back like 4-5 squares, then when you take one step to the side they‚Äôre off tick?
---
I did the calculations and you get a much lower percent of boss tasks from konar when accounting for locations. She would be good if the none boss tasks were very short too but they're usually not. 
---
Yes it will!
---
It's probably ya boi from Slytherin 
---
 How hard would it be to implement a "life alert" type of thing with HCIM? Like you have to pay for it with a one time purchase of $5 or something reasonably small and it's connected to Jagex HQ/OSRS servers via 3G/4G networks or satellite etc., it has to be paired with whatever teleport (teleport to house for pretty much everyone at all times) and if you start lagging, dcing, blue screen, client freeze, pc freeze, loss of power, soups unplugging his monitor, whatever it may be, you hit the button on the physical beeper in your hand and it makes you're account teleport. How far from the realm of possibility would such a thing be? Just a physical real life beeper type of thing that can be used to teleport you're account in game. It wouldn't be perfect but better than nothing and I'm not a programmer but the idea of it doesn't seem to far fetched. 
---
Broke Bois use bp lol

You're completely clueless

Do you understand the word epitome? Im saying this is a prime example. Society was decaying before this comment existed so wind ya neck in

Waa I'm so upset

Stop talking about "things that have destroyed most of the content already" when you obviously are new to this game and have only played for a few short while.

Hmm I've probably just gotten a bit lucky then, Albeit I am hunting hydra tasks specifically, however any boss tasks I get inbetween skips I am doing. I can do a real world test if you would like to actually have the calculations and an actual representation to go alongside the data?
---
Yeah i know this, i just dont understand why people have this mindset. Dont get me wrong i want results hidden when you vote too, but its like, if you are voting, vote for your own opinion, if not, then why are you even wasting time voting?
---
Little did they know you were actually a bit all along
---
Is there a google doc or something that calculates drop rate for stuff like this? Or even a formula you use? I‚Äôm bad at stats so I wouldn‚Äôt even know how to start.
---
No I'm saying if dhcb works at olm then the Lance should too and vice versa. 
---
Then there's my job that's 13 hours straight work with no breaks for 4 days in a row. I would kill to osrs at work.

Delete account and make a new one, this one is probably out of RNG for the rest of your progress. Jk, congrats :)
---
What do you expect from us? There could be a million factor how your account was hacked. Context Jagex and update this thread if you know more. You've either entered the 2FA response on a phishing website, or your phone might be comprised, or your mail has no 2FA and someone could just disable 2FA altogether. 
---
Ugh ffs I spent 5 hours so far at BA and about 4 of them were spamming for a group. The few groups I was in had no idea what to do so I've never been further than wave 6. Thinking about giving up on the torso.. this shit is aids.

your bonecrusher is not charged with ectotokens.

In the wave 1 room you can meet people. Just stop signing up noobs or joining noob teams

not to mention i got a d axe kc 8 at wintertodt :S

How do you anti crash?
---
Nature runes and fire runes work too...
---
less clueless than you think
---
Too smart to be anywhere near a PK team.
---
true, but that's litterally like 1/1000
---
Kill every monster, make it so they get no kills. At dust devils and nechs you can also freeze the single ones in place so they can't group them up. At bosses (mainly bandos) you want to use void for maximum dps to snipe kills, claws if you have them.
---
Still needed?
---
Literally any puzzle is easy if you are handed the answer. 
---

---
The bonecrusher apparently only triggers on the 100% bone drop, not regular drops. Normal bloodvelds have normal bones and big bones on their loot table.

lol wat

pretty sure bonescrusher never worked with the extra bone drops so you could use bones to peaches.

Can a rightclick "check" option be added to the Magic Secateurs to check your farming contract, similar to Slayer Helms/Rings for slayer tasks?

Add a mirror shield to it

We need to drop this ‚Äúnerf skill resource drops‚Äù... come on now, skilling is never going to make millions. It‚Äôs never going to be profitable to a reasonable extent. Profitable skilling was dead the second Zulrah and wyverns became a benchmark for loot tables.
---
I've had 3 superiors while cannoning smoke devils. Besides that, you can get multiple of the same piece as long as you drop the piece right before you kill a superior. I've done it loads of times when I have the final piece in my inventory and other 2 pieces in the bank.
---
Right that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm plantin ma seed.
---
Yea and the hacker knew previous passwords, IP addresses, card numbers. This isn't guessed, the owner fucked up leaking info. How the fuck you you tell someone your previous passwords lol.
---
Generate a random, long one-time-password we can use to recover our accounts. Disable all other forms of recovery. Obviously display several warnings before allowing this method, stating your account will be lost if you lose access to your account, email and OTP.
---
This kind of recovery code is commonly used to remove 2FA, so I don't see why letting us pick the more radical and surefire way would be bad.
---
No that's literally making up statistics.
---
 I do
---
Yeah but In this case he's on ancients, no alching
---
Only spawn on task* You can kill them when the task has ended. You'll get both the exp/drops
---
Believe it or not it was actually worse at one point. They patched it to make it easier a day after the quest came out because it was too frustrating.
---
Oh my lord you‚Äôre wild 
---
just dont be autistic, instead, use a different password for osrs lmao.
---
Quit kink shaming 
---
Honestly the Golem has some of my favorite faces to use as responses. 
---
You must establish dominance 
---
Yea so um....
---
They can still get the task done this way. The better way to anti crash is to ice barrage them off so they can't stack. That's true cancer.
---
Neither is the DHL 
---
Yea speculation! Sorry didnt mention. Faux showed something about it.
---
But... shouldn't this be an option for members accounts then? They require a subscription too. Not to mention that with the invention of wow tokens and one-off games like Diablo and Starcraft, what you are saying isn't actually true; A diablo player would never have to spend money with a credit card on the game if bought in a store. 
---
Zeldens points are good; almost all games will refund any loss of items or progress due to a hack. Jagex won't even refund the high profile case from yesterday, despite mod stevew admitting the account was secured through authenticator etc,  and the reason it got hacked was due to the decision of someone on the icu team to go with old data over the player currently playing using an authenticator.
---
Oh, theyll be back
---
Fair enough, that'd be helpful. I just get a little bothered how people just go on and on about the delay and nothing else, when by itself it wouldn't do much
---
Thanks!
---
\&gt; you can get a full inv while slaying or something then hop to a pvp world to fill your bag and hop back.   
---
that only means there'll be more people to hunt in pvp worlds thus increasing the activity, so what is the problem here.
---
FML I didn‚Äôt get head until 300KC.

But why would you want it at all?

Nah it's pretty good. I've been using it for 80% of my hydra kills, more consistent times than BP for me, and my bp times have never gotten below 2 min, when I can get there often with DHL. Maybe it's just my luck idk. 
---
What a lovely person you're. Never stated it was jagex's fault all I asked for was an explanation into how it could've happened.
---
you're missing most of the game, I think you'd like members unless you like the simplicity of F2P
---
Bet jager would like it.
---
Because Nieve provides better experience
---
I explained it, *YOU FUCKED UP*

Holy shit I'm retarded I can't believe I forgot that lmao

If you are not smart enough to use print screen, you should not be trying jad.

I think it just depends on the request mostly, different departments have different times (most of the billing requests I sent took notably longer than account-related ones).

I imagine Twitter responses are just a catch-all and have a department that can look into individual cases at a quick glance, but provide nothing detailed.

Damn gg his whole post

does it have prayer bonus? or magic bonus matters mostly ?

It should keep the heal portion of the special attack just to keep it balanced

I guess. Also nothing you can do about hardware failure such as PC psus crashing or memory breaking resulting in OS crash and bluescreen or cpu/GPU breaking down or anything else. Even software errors can cause inability to communicate with the client.

Major respect for coming out to the thread and sharing some thoughts on the points made. Out of curiosity, do you have any security features in mind that would improve account security for osrs, or are there any features in particular that are being considered for implementation?

If it's any help; the last few times I did a membership transfer, I was actually given free days. I was about 5-10 days into a 6-month sub, and got the full 6-months transferred to my other account.
---
Only that alting in raids is alot of effort and you need to make and train an account for that first.
---
Don't the numbers go invisible when you hover? Screenshot on mouse click won't work. Course there are still other ways around it.
---
Mager will attack same tick with ranger because ranger doesnt need to move for 1 tick to be able to see player. Mobs in back are always in line of sight when stepping out from pillar no matter how you run. Off tick just isnt possible in this situation
---
Unless i'm missing how [growth stages](http://oldschoolrunescape.wikia.com/wiki/Farming) or how the [Kronos seed](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Kronos_seed) work, its still not too useful as there is only a few chances to activate and so its unlikely all your trees will trigger at the same time and if it doesn't then you'l have to either wait or do multiple runs making it redundant for regular tree/fruit tree runs.

My friend lost a really good account (got banned) because we sold mils he had made there.. That‚Äôs even worse 
---
How? I'm similar stats and I need to do raids sometime, did you do solo? 
---
Can we not kill demonic gorillas while on a Konar Black Demon task?
---
Only confirmed that they'll offer those changes, actual buff will still be up to the community. But since you're just posting this to make other people purchase lances you've already stocked up on and make their price increase, the buff being real or not is irrelevant to you.
---
It does, I‚Äôve had it skip two hesp cycles 
---
Rude
---
Wtf lol this fits so well
---
Never thought about that, that would indeed make it useful.
---
Gz but geez your gf has cooking lvl 1
---
To start, my question is - is it worth going members even if I can't play on desktop? I can usually only play on mobile during the day due to irl things going on ... I've been hesitating to switch to p2p since I don't have much time currently to play on desktop.
---
If it's worth the switch, where should I start? I have base 60 combat stats and am mid-ish levels among everything else.
---
Sperm cape?
---
nice progress dude
---
i just banged out kruk with only sharks!
---
mainly the gorillas im worried about cause i never killed one before
---
Nope; would fail a poll because most people are into uninterrupted max-efficiency gameplay either 2-3 ticking or full afk (disguised under the "it doesn't prevent botting" excuse).
---
Why is wilderness dead and why doesn't jagex care about pvp community?
---
how often do you check on it, so you dont miss the time saved.
---
Spectacular
---
Imagine being mad about someone stealing some memes that you didn't even make
---
lifting for strength is so cringe Xd
---
If it's your friends account, you are not allowed to get the infernal cape on it. But if you use VPN or do it from your friends house, you won't get caught 
---
So you'd like to confirm melee is in fact ideal for inferno for everything except boss?  I don't feel I've overstepped my expertise with that one, but since you seem to get so upset I apologize for suggesting melee isn't viable.
---
When my boss catches me he just goes ‚Äúmaking some moneeeeh?‚Äù Cos for some reason i say that everytime i load it up. 
---
Zaktap arrow, superdenny2, elecmage14
---
Why do they all look suicidal
---
Umm umadbro or some level of jealous?
---
You can hide from them and let nieve do most of the work, it‚Äôs multi, so you‚Äôre going to need to hope you can get to a safe spot before they kill you 
---
Like shelving the bank rework with no plan to work on it again?? lol
---
I did a bit at lower levels, but most of the mobs in there can be cannoned (or bursted) elsewhere and that has more of an effect on keeping Slayer higher than HP. 
---
Awesome, thanks for the tip! 
---
Im sorry you still need my attention
---
Thank you
---
Question :- Can obtaining sand be re-visited?
---
Suggestion :- A spell on the lunar spell book that works as humidify does that would fill empty buckets with sand. 
---
This could fill all buckets in the inventory with one spell  (heavy cost on runes)
---
- OR -
---
This could fill one bucket at time (moderate cost on runes)
---
Just protect from melee lol. 
---
Got a hydra tail on kc 106
---
I did it once bit had ro buy some memberahip
---
Golden Tench are known as the "Nurses" of the water as they keep waterways clean and healthy, so maybe a use for the golden tench could be similar to the bonecrusher but for health?
---
Here is the idea:
---
'Whilst the Golden Tench is in your inventory your health restoration rate is increase by 3x. If using the rapid restore prayer this bonus increases to 4x.'
---
Or something similar, this would be decent for those slayer tasks you need to eat at, but not overpowered to the point people would use it in pvp or bossing.
---
That's standard proceedure. From memory Jagex has consulted with relevant professionals and has established that the safest thing for that person and others in game is to mute them so they can't talk about it.
---
You never know what random people on the internet will say or how that could influence somenody legitimately considering self harm/suicide, regardless of how well-meaning their intentions are.

Aw okay! Stew would work tho right?
---
I really don't think he soloed the Theatre of Blood mate
---
Can't speak for anyone else, but I do (relatively low-to-med-end) PvM and skilling; I have very little reason to enter the wilderness, and even then, the most I do is the Abyss. I have no interest in PvP.
---
I‚Äôve read of people playing it on a walmart $80 smartphone. It‚Äôs not that taxing tbh.
---
Depends on what your password is for. I've made accounts on websites with capitals and they won't let me in unless I capitalize the right letter.
---
Although I do agree these websites are far too few compared to the ones where capitalization doesn't matter.
---
I'd take it over fury in cases where the 2 str from fury upgrade doesnt give a max hit.
---
Yeah but you don't know the password, and you can't submit a payment to submit a recovery request you're screwed.
---

Sell contracts are fill or kill.
---
Either someone pays 1m (offers over it will pay the price and any extra be returned) for it or the contract remains indefinitely open until cancelled.
---
Think of it like buying a candy bar from a store, you hand the clerk a 10 dollar note for the 2 dollar bar and they give you the change, if you offer them less its declined and the candy will stay on the shelf until sold or the shop keeper takes it off the shelf. 
---
Spot takers don‚Äôt have explorers ring 1.

Alright thanks, ugh its a pretty stupid rule.. cant they check friends list and IPs and shit to determine if it was rwted or not? 
---
If he swapped from rs3 you'd think that he would have enough game knowledge to not wear gear this bad.
---
The title says this took 115 days, not 5 minutes cannoning Hellhounds. Not really an applicable argument here, friend.

Thanks I hate it
---
raids with no herblore. GL 
---
Hey its my slave camp
---
Always members. So easy to upkeep a bond. And everything is faster in p2p
---
This is an idiotic post
---
Not entirely; if both connections are connected to the same VPN, they both have the same originating IP.
---
As a firearms enthusiast, I support this. We also need a foregrip and a muzzle brake to help with recoil. 
---
Ah so by that logic patents shouldn‚Äôt exist? People should be able to steal whatever they like? He didn‚Äôt even credit the OP that‚Äôs when you know he‚Äôs stealing content - it‚Äôs people like you who when ordering a curry you say let‚Äôs put it all in the middle and share. Filthy fucking pagan.
---
0.01% chance to hit a head shot insta kill anything.
---
It‚Äôs 2019 and people don‚Äôt know you make money from this.  
---
Shit son.  
---
Opted to just use Imbued Frem rings, the plan was eventually to get a Suffering, but in the end it's \~15m and cannon has been enough to keep Slayer above HP by a large margin so it wasn't needed.
---
Special attack sound: BOOM! HEADSHOT!
---
He should've passed the account down the family 
---
&gt; you will be kicked out of the game because ip change
---
Have both connections connected to the same VPN; your IP connected to RS servers would then be the same from either connection since they're originating from the VPN.
---
They can but from my experience there's so many capes coming in game that they don't even bother with main capes anymore unless it's obvious (multiple accs done from same ip)
---
Probably not a bug since those bones are 'loot' and not the bones from the monster itself.
---
HILT BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Elite melee just gives pray bonus, elite mage/range give 2.5% extra damage boost to their respective styles.
---
if you're getting 2 min kills with a t bow something is wrong with you. I average 2:15 with a blowpipe
---
That‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt push the red button‚Äù if you say you have nothing they‚Äôre instantly gonna think ‚Äúhe‚Äôs got something‚Äù
---
Son of a b... Clever. 
---
Yeah, that's what I've heard. Any suggestions on where I should start when I get members? Good ways to upkeep a bond? I just feel so overwhelmed everything that p2p offers I don't even know where to start when it comes to making some gp early on to sustain a bond.
---
Cheers!
---
Most VPN software would cut off your connection momentarily if the source of the connection changes
---
thanks i hate it
---
Make it 5m
---
I see. Hoping to get an official answer on twitter.
---
And it siphons their run energy 200x whatever the hit was 
---
No, from what I heard it‚Äôll make all of a type skip a stage, so all of your trees or all of your fruit trees or all of your herbs will stay at the same level of progression
---
Imagine a level three skiller can get slayer cape but not me smh
---
Confirmed and "we'll offer" is two different thing
---
Im sorry serene made you project again xd
---
I mean it was a super rare drop and worked out that it was around 1-2k on average in herbs from 99 slayer which takes longer than a few hours in nmz.
---
They're both brainless.
---
Why? The whole lose favour for doing alternate content was a stupid mechanic to begin with, and went against the core design philosophy of runescape.
---
 shut THE FUCK UP no shut the fuck up you little bitch. every fucking time... on one of these stupid posts... where some lying little degenerate mentions that they have a gf/wife/whatever one of you little fucking retards who thinks hes being wacky and random comes out and says this exact comment... hahahah guys is she single hahahaha guys look at how quirky i am xddd fuck off idiot.... fuck off and fuck off whoever keeps upvoting and encouraging this unoriginal, unfunny, unintelligent, degenerate comment ps if i ever saw u irl id smash ur phone, pc, laptop, playsation, etc so you can never use the internet again 
---
I‚Äôll be stockpiling brews, restores and stamina‚Äôs from bossing, tob and Hyde random event!
---
I am just concerned, there are a dozen of these threads a day, but I do not think I have ever seen a response by Jagex. 
---
Patents? Wtf are you on about? Its a fucking meme lmao, get your head out of your ass, I bet tou jerk off reading Article 13 you fairy gobbler
---
Eh this really only works against moving targets up to 800m away....
---
Obviously? Why even bring that up. I‚Äôm saying, the effects he proposes are only for better drop rates. The drop rates are fine as they are.
---
Fat wrecked :(
---
Okay, cool. Thank you!
---
FUN NOT ALLOWED.  ONLY EFFICIENCY.  HAPPINESS = XP WASTE.  DEAD CONTENT IF UNDER 200KXP/HR.
---
I'm going to start my attempts after I get a kodai. Only like 30m hours off still. It is daunting. 
---
Since u now can reanimate ensouled heads in the Catacombs of Kourend and reanimated creatures can be killed on their corresponding tasks. So as an example: Konar assigns you to slay Abyssal demons in the Kourend Catacombs. 
---
If i then Reanimate an Abyssal demon and slay it, do i have a chance to roll on the new loot table?
---
‚Äú OH BABY A TRIPLE‚Äù when you hit three enemies without hitting a zero.
---
He'd definitely let me use it,  I just don't remember the password at all and all of it's progress is on RS3.

Should wear Abby demon slayer helm

Not being a btw in 2019
---
Ayyy a fellow 1kc kq pet!

Kronos isn‚Äôt great for normal herb runs but when banging out farm contracts it‚Äôs clearly the best, since you can skill at the farm guild and finish the contract as soon as it‚Äôs fully grown

When it comes to serious shit like this, we can be alright.
---
You got downvoted for opposing the idea of EZ-SCAPE
---
I'll trade you the tail for it 
---
Hydra shits out a lot of those too. Very similar rates to deaths. 
---
Only if it insta-kills enemies with a skull.
---
Stews would boost you by 5 and let you cut things above the norm, yes. But I don't think it'd be worth it to consistently do WC, in all honesty.
---
That‚Äôs awesome. 
---
Hcim prestige is perfection
---
I like it when other people already gathered the mobs for me :)
---
First they should make a Shayzien Slayer helm so it fits with the rest of the armour. Since they allowed us to combine the two, it only feels natural.
---
Solution add a 5 minute timer.
---
Nice to see someone else uses that spot. It's honestly better than most others tbh
---
Doesn't mean that my story isn't true.
---
\&gt;banking during a dust devil task
---
The issue with PvP now is that there are so many special attacks and combos and potential one shots available that either you fight at &gt;full health with top gear, or you get one shot.
---
The fact that so many consider the granite maul "Iconic" despite the fact that with current gear it can one shot players is indicative of this.
---
There's no more gruelling challenging fights, there's just scarfing food and praying for RNG, then mashing all cooldowns when your opponent drops below 60%, or stacking everything for a one shot from full.
---
What a joke
---

Can you reduce the droprate of the old COX items before they crash to alch value? The amount coming in now as to opposed to before is insane.
---
It depends for me. I try to keep rc lowest so I can get ToG for it. So I spend my lamps and stuff on either herblore or construction. 
---
Then don‚Äôt be a dumbass and make your pin something that‚Äôs 3 different numbers. How hard is it to remember 9879?

fast gif plz
---
Madstorm801 come back bro, stop playing WoW.
---
This will probably make PVP world skilling a more viable option
---
Ah, I must 've been blind! Thanks!
---
Yes, account security desperately needs updating. I quit RS3 summer 2015 and occasionally logged on (every month or two) to say hi to friends and what not. Early 2016, I hadn't logged on in a while and when I did I got a message that I was permanently banned for botting. Obviously I had been hacked since I no longer played, but the fact that I had no idea until I had already been banned for botting is ridiculous.
---
Fortunately, I was able to get in contact with a Jmod and provide a lot of proof that it wasn't me and got my account back and offense removed. Still, they need to add a delay on the authenticator removal.
---
where did op claim this image was "theirs" rather than just sharing an image? 
---
Nice! At least I'm making money for inferno supplies in the process! Better than doing sire and going 600 dry too. Thanks for the luck, brother 
---
What about people with cannons crashing?
---
I tried and it's just Too much red
---
This started off promising..
---
Why not just use tbow?
---
Haha this is great stuff, thanks for the laughs
---
As an RS player, you surely must have more patience than that? 
---
I have about 6000 red chins on my Ironman. Should I save them for bossing? Or are the black ones only worth it?
---
D1zzy12 boilingcook :(
---
Nah, everyone's judgement is clouded due to other monsters dropping  too much. 
---
A viable option but not more viable. Nobody is gonna camp pvp worlds with bis gear. It would simply add a little more action.
---
Willie02340
---
For farming xp, no. But I farm Yanillian hops and they sell well because a mahogany tree requires 25 hops as payment.
---
Better get the damage control team on the line then because those suggests are grade-A retarded. They are not "QoL" they are direct (and huge) buffs to cox. Cox has become so refined that this will genuinely speed up the amount of items coming into the game by a significant percentage.
---
Not to mention all his suggests do nothing more than decrease the skill gap between experienced raiders and learners. There has to be a learning curve and a reward for becoming efficient and good. It's equivalent to removing prayer flicking as a "qol" update because it's unpleasant to do. 
---
I'm certain the actual raiding community would be super happy to communicate some suggestions, like certain buffs to the thieving room which is dis-proportionally weak to the rest of the content (like letting scavs drop picklocks, for starters), or a "remove-x" from the chest, only letting vespula start once you get in the room (currently her trigger radios is huge, like, you can be a room away). 
---
Plenty of possibilities, but please ignore everything OP said. 
---
Happy days! Ofcourse they 'Do' care.. It's bullshit to say they dont.
---
&gt; 30% favor from quests now.

?

You gain 20% to a faction of your choosing, only once from Client, and then you can do individual quests for each house to gain 10%. That is not "30% favor from quests now".

How's this?
---
14 reasons why
---
legit vorkath is so much easier on mobile. It's easy mode. Been doing it since mobile released, I actually save my vorkath runs for mobile
---
People can still be crashed by pkers ofcourse. Most skilling activities already have a bank around the corner so it really make a huge difference.
---
I mean I‚Äôve always heard you almost 100% need void for raiding but I‚Äôve never raided personally sooo
---
Brb about to clone a 2nd instance of the OSRS app to see if my phone can tab between two active games 
---
I don't get all the shit talking about mobile. Some players really despise it as if it wasn't the game at all
---
There are probably people that have private scripts, bought a botting script from somewhere etc. to where it‚Äôs hard to get them banned because the boy is relatively rare. It‚Äôs not some script you can get easily/for free (or so I assume). Hard to tell a botter from a gold farmer tho
---
Mmmmmmmm.......maybe. 
---
Do 3k people actually think their entitled to a spot in the game just because they have a task..?
---
They beat the odds and made it out
---
Nope it never consumes prayer, this dude has no clue what hes talking about. It only drains prayer if its activated for more than a tick, which is why tick flicking keeps you at full pray. 
---
This logic is so stupid lol. Yea go make a new account and pay for membership on it to loot üòÇüòÇüòÇ logical

So you can‚Äôt spam the potion for dis charges?
---
It doesn't aid in PvP fights. It aids PKers in finding other players that aren't intending, or are geared up, for PvP.
---
I would vote no, although I love PKing, as I would rather see an update that promotes PKer VS PKer fights, rather than PKer VS PvMer / skiller

Good question, it might be a bit too much.

Slayer not worth before Nieve. Defenders even rune should be priority. Sandcrabs/ammonites or nmz if you have the quests are best.
---
Thank you! I see people bashing on them sometimes so I kinda wanted to provide a counter-point to that negativity. 
---
My chair stinks regardless

Don't fall for the slayer meme. Slayer with low stats is trash. Keep doing crabs and switch it up if you get bored. Experiments and bandits are worse than crabs tho.

This is the kind of content I can get behind

You keep getting more ring pieces, it's like totems

As a fellow IT professional who grew up with RuneScape, I think the last point in your first section would be the most beneficial to propose to 'the right people'. Obviously I'm just a guy on a forum but just wanted to agree with how substantial of an improvement it would be having a more integrated 2FA and SMS experience for authentication as well as recovery. Thanks for the insight!

Can we add the electricity effect of the blue phase Alchemical Hydra to the pet‚Äôs blue phase as well? Currently as it stands the electricity phase for the Ikkle Hydra lacks any electricity whatsoever.

or skip the contract but grow the tree anyways, then once the tree is grown you don't check it until you get that contract again.  But it really shouldn't be best practice to skip contracts in the first place

That password is laughably not secure, I know its an example and you used the word "password" but that is besides the point.
---
The inclusion of numbers and symbols does nearly nothing for this password, instead try making the password longer by using say 3 short words. "wrong badger bike slope" is infinitely more secure than a 12 character password with numbers and symbols

For everyone dealing with crashers (especially those assholes that wait till you stack em all up to attack) just tag 4 of the dust devils and stand off to the side, they‚Äôll leave within a minute or two.

The only way that could work is if its only usable for 30sec after getting a kill.

Otherwise it would just be extra inventoryspace while doing pvm.

Yeah you clearly don‚Äôt have a tbow. Blowpipe isn‚Äôt far behind tbow in dps it just costs a ton more to use. Look at the chat box in this pic alone, 1:30 is a fast kill and is definitely not near the average(op hasn‚Äôt even hit 1:30 as a pb)

An acc is basically u playable with a bank pin. It doesnt make sense to reset one but not the other. The thing is bank pins dont protect ur pure from getting def, ur skiller from getting combat, an ultimate ironmans bank, a hardcores hardcore status. An auth delay would be a miracle. Keep in mind an auth delay would have protected most of the victims of the rogue jmod recently. 
---
The problem with jagex‚Äôs 2fa is that it doesnt require 2fa to remove. If i want to remove 2fa from my bank or my email, i need current password + 2ndary email or text or a recovery question. For rs, i only need email access since both password and auth can be removed with just email. Thats a major flaw. One or the other needs another ‚Äúkey‚Äù to be secure. Plus Gmail and yahoo have both been compromised in the past 6 years and will probably be in the future again too. 
---
You said people get alerts through email but that doesnt help when its compromised. Setup jagex emails to go to spam and no notification for me and the email gets deleted in under a minute. Im also sure you dont get emailed upon successful recovery if the email is changed in the recovery. 
---
Solution: add sms/text authenication. The majority of people keep the same phone number. So upon successful recovery, you can remove auth with a text and current email. Require auth and email to change current sms. Require auth and sms to change email. If you lose your phone number, you can request to remove authenicator. Then after 7 days its removed. Seriously, the number of people who forget ther passwords and get a new phone number and lose access to their authenicator is going to be super low. If you are really that worried, make it so after a year of inactivity the auth can be instantly removed with just email. 
---
Also you know, not granting account recoveries to accounts that are currently active with no signs of hacking would be amazing. Every single account that the rogue jmod recovered was active, some with just a single password used (staking accs), yet appeals were granted. If an acc is active, is still playing the same hours, is still playing from creation region with the same password, dont grant appeals that state the password was forgotton/acc stolen.

Cannon is mostly for xp or speeding up slayer tasks.  I don't think there are many areas where it is profitable.

Gaftad, Sackmaster45, Imalova.

Never to be seen or heard again.

I think of significantly as a lot.

It‚Äôs multi combat. Why would we destroy multi combat? If your in singles and a team shows up, you can easily dodge dip dive and run. Always remember if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a dodgeball. 
---
For real tho: don‚Äôt go wilderness. Tired of you pvm plebs dying in wildy and crying about it. Find different ways to play if you can‚Äôt handle the heat. 
---
That is an ensouled head, not KQ head.
---
Not really. The cannon is pretty much meant for you to lose money.
---
Melee you are training 2 stats or 3 if you're doing def. So it will be twice or 3 times as long

Do Monkey madness and get a dragon scim, slayermusiq1 has a great guide on youtube that will make it a breeze. After that train slayer while doing melee and before you know it your levels will be increasing!

P.S. - Use konar as a master if you are 75+ combat, it will make you a lot more gp to buy some good str gear (d boots, obsidian gear)

Happy to help. I haven't heard back from the Police although it is common to not hear anything further. I have supplied them with all the info they need, although I am guessing they will need the cooperation of the ISP in the US to identify the user, unless the UK owner is able to identify them.

Having read the full chat logs, the good news is that I don't think the person is at great risk, as there is some additional co text in their chat that you won't have seen which is a bit more positive. That said, we obviously want to make sure all is well.

The best tip I can give is stay up to date with all the upcoming updates and the things jmods are "looking to implement". The game updates are 100% the biggest cause of price fluctuations so staying on top of things is very helpful. (A good example is you'll see the price of scales rises every single time there has been a large pvm update). 
---
Similarly, there was the dragon hunter Lance update which we have known for a long time now would require the hasta,  this is why there has been such such a large variation in the price of those hasta this month.

An item to upgrade the TzHaar-ket-om, slightly raising its Strength requirement and offensive stats and granting it a special attack, "Blessing of the Tasakaal".
---
The spec would cause the next hit to gain increased accuracy (or defence penetration) and slightly increased damage. As a thank-you from the Tasakaal for "bringing balance", executing an enemy with it will fully refund the spec's energy cost and grant a small benefit to entice the player to execute more enemies, like applying the effects of a combat potion or restoring a few Prayer points based on the enemy's max HP.

This is because the playerbase are a bunch of easyscape noobs that want all the benefits of the wilderness without the risk. May as well just give them a tbow for leaving tutorial island and remove the wildy.

I like it. There is plenty of demand for the DHCB, TBow, etc, look at their insane prices. I like that anyone in game can get a blowpipe after a few hours play and have competitive dps, instead of having to work for months for a DHCB or years for a Tbow

Iirc cracker was initially meant to be a term for hackers who did shit like steal passwords, as the original hacking community didn't want to be associated with it. Never really caught on though.

Barbarian fly tick fishing is best. 2nd best is dragon harpoon tick fishing then thoee 2 methods non-tick. Str xp means basically nothing if you are min-maxing. agility xp matters from barb fly
---
More people need to know about deep wildly pking tbh. I think incentive is there as you could easily get a pretty meaty loot pile, the main reason to do it is because it's just straight up more fun than edge pking. Adding overheads changes the game entirely. I think jagex does a good job showcasing tribridding during DMM mode, but I'm not entirely sure that everyones knows that there people pking the same way 24/7 at 44's. Maybe some more people would give it a shot. 
---
In addition, I don't see why jagex doesn't have more in game competitions. They could literally host a king of the ring event at 44s once a week and it would be the funniest shit ever at almost no cost to them.
---
Wtf? I never picked them up because I thought they were useless!

It might be too strong right now but I can see this being an update in the future. Maybe a combat slot, and a utility slot.
---
You could try using imp boxes if you have the hunter level for them
---
It might seem crazy but you can get black chin hunter level in 1-3 days without even tryharding that much. At that level black chin 3t would be anywhere from 800k-1m an hour, you could afford zammy hasta in less than a week from scratch very easily.(if you dont mind hunter like me)
---
A lot of you keep misreading what I wrote here. That "only" isn't meant to be there to gripe about how it's a " low amount". It's there to say that you can ONLY get 5m an HR if you do this boss for the long run and get the uniques in the in the droprates. Actually read that I wrote, please.

Where have you been living under a rock?

You clearly haven't used it. Not even close to BIS at any of those you listed.
---
 DHCB is better in all of those situations because of the strength of enchanted bolts.
---
Also I have killed 150 rune dragons with the DHL and am not impressed. It needs to be buffed so it can compete with the enchanted bolts. 
---
Support. 
---
DHCB is way slower in attack speed so how would that make any sense, also the bolts cost money once you have a DHL it stays the same.
---
I fell for this scam too about a year ago and lost about 20m. I think the idea that you have the upper hand as the ‚Äúanti scammer‚Äù blinds you to the reality of what‚Äôs actually going on.

YES! thank you

usually its down to jagex discretion. they dont have to but they can.

Right.... but blowpipe hits 2.5 times per rcb's 1

Rate the pets from best smelling to worst smelling, go. I put Vorki somewhere in the bottom 3.

You're right scythe is still slightly better at olm after calculating, if it were buffed specifically against olm I would have no problem with that.

The authenticator code stays for like 2 mins after it disapperas from your phone. The phishers get alerts when people enter their details so they can quickly log in

Imo the strenght bonus on the dhl is fine but it could use little bit of accuracy boost vs dragons, 25-30% mayby?

Yea, they could even match the attack speed and add hidra/drake/wyrm scales to charge it. Anything to match those two combat variety
---
while that's definitely a possibility, i highly doubt any new couple month old player is aware of being an efficient player and grind straight for millions of money

this is *chtzsssk* attack gnome 1 requesting target
---
*ktsshhhk* ground control to attack gnome 1 target is port khazard copy?
---
*chtzzsssk* copy that ground control proceeding to attack
---
*a fucking attack plane appears over the port*

*its a complete massive panic as guards don't know what the fuck is it*

*justice for the gnomes is done*

Seems like a whole thing though

Since when is it best in slot at vorkath (even with infernal cape), or olm?

If it helps you to know I let her sleep on my chest that night. Normally she sleeps on the foot of my bed 
---
It can be slower but because of the enchanted bolts it crushes it in DPS. Also who cares about saving cost on bolts when we are talking about 100M weapons. 
---
Shit, what a spot-on
---
the little gnome man looks funny in there
---
Yeah, there‚Äôs loads (or at least were) loads of fake phishing ads on Instagram/Facebook.

Did you enter your account details anywhere except on the mobile app?

How do you feel?
---
The exp is pretty good and you get anima and potentially lily seeds
---
Imagine living in 2k19 and not looking up a quest guide to make sure you have all needed items in your inventory when you start the quest.   
---
I wouldn‚Äôt, and still wouldn‚Äôt if the requirement was 85. I wouldn‚Äôt mind the agility requirement being higher; I just disagree with adding a meaningless diary requirement to everything.
---
Finally?
---
I don‚Äôt get the point of splashing rats, a player can come and make their cat chase it, it‚Äôs much easier to just splash men and women

Another quick tip:

"osrs.wiki/Great Kourend" will take you to the Great Kourend wiki page, this goes for pretty much any item/quest/area/npc you can think of an even has some error correction and acronym support like "osrs.wiki/rfd"
---
They work that way. Every bracelet has the same amount of charges always but when one is fully consumed they all go to 30 charges. This way you won't need multiple bank spaces for different charge bracelets

Totally this if you run out of options

Set anti-aliasing in your gpu settings to enhance rather than override and turn off fxaa.

The point was weather i stop logging on because of my own want or need to stop playing or weather i am forced to stop playing due to server shut down or if i stop because of death either way op is right in the fact that one day we will all log on for the last time at some point, it is inevitable.

They nerfed birdhouses like a month ago because brew prices were too low, and then they put 2500 brews as a drop.
---
If you cant see how fucking stupid this is, there's nothing more I need to say to show how dumb you are.
---
There's plenty things to put on a drop table that isnt 2500 potions that they tried making more expensive just a few updates before. How hard can it be for you to use your fucking brain?

Between masks, skips, and other perks, there is more than enough to spend

Shout out to all the bots.
---
Yes and rune dragons with lance is actually pretty decent money, especially for an alt
---
I'll just stand back, let them stack em up, then switch to barrage, out dps them
---
DHCB only really has demand for brutal blacks and Vorkath. Maybe KBD too but Lance might be better. I don‚Äôt mind blowpipe being a good weapon but hydra literally drops a dragon hunter weapon, is considered a dragon, and using the dragon hunter crossbow/lance is worse than blowpipe. 
---
Buff to 30% outside of raids and Lithkren vault so it is still bis but not further buffing rune dragons and not devaluing scythe 
---
Pm me
---
Fossil island is an area which has a quest requirement locked behind it, but once you have unlocked it, there are 4 bird houses that you can build on. It requires a hammer, chisel, clockwork and the respective logs for your level. You also need 10 hop seeds to fill each bird house. The exp is great, I am lvl 69 hunter without doing any hunter. You can do runs every hour.

Always in favor of more storage and this definitely adds to an underutilized room. I love cosmetics/collectionscape but I don't love them taking up space in my bank.

You realize that its stab attack is still Controlled, right

I could get 3600 RC Exp in that time.
---
&gt;pumped 5 times as fast into the game
---
Konar slayer is aids, and it's the only realistic way of getting hydra tasks. People will run out of points, soon enough; and when they do, they won't be farming wilderness slayer for more slayer points.
---
Dhl will be fairly limited, in supply. Ntm that it's also a 1/1k drop rate.
---
Think of the teleports you could get with those runes! 
---
they give small exp when planted. As for whats better, depends how you do farming. 
---
     if you do herb runs, then attas is better  if you just do tree runs etc for exp, kronos is better.

I'm in a similar predicament, OP. It sure would be nice to get sherpa'd around the rev caves for just a few hours.

Yeah why not add something to bis 1 def mage gear instead of fixing some actual dead content.

I really hoped the new BIS gloves would look bad ass like the B gloves, but instead got some shitty looking hydra bracers, support for changing them.

you can with orange stew?

for everything online one time will be your last login. The last post you make will be the last thing anyone sees from you.
---
It will still be pumped more in the game then the crossbow, comparing melee to range is retarded, because for some reason a fucking blowpipe is better then a crossbow made "to kill dragon kind" if anything that stupid blowpipe needs a nerf
---
That poll already failed.

yeah agreed! that guy lost me at "2018 recap". Whats that even supposed to mean?!?

Dragon socks

A blue phat in RS3 costs 5k in real life apparently still. Crazy

Herbi is more fun
---
Well, if it would be the best place for some skilling options, it would mean that those places would be stamped with pk'ers and other skillers, making it not the most valuable option anymore. I would be fine if it was high risk, high reward thingy. 
---
But it would be easy to abuse, and adding timers to it just doesn't feel feasible.
---
Possibly some recoil action in there as well.
---
was thinking of doing magic then ranged (in that order because i want that untrimmed prayer cape) then str, attk, then def. really want to get 99 str asap so i can just use a whip forever

They‚Äôve intentionally left the tree there to make it a longer run.

I would only be ok with it if it was an equip able item, but there is no good place for it to be equipped to, as there is no "belt" spot.

Should you bring a boss or skilling pet to bosses?

Idk why you're being downvoted. The 2.5k brews was a direct referance to the r2s hoax of sara dropping 2.5k sara brews as a supposed ultra rare drop

Try hitting check on your helm. Right now it doesn't pick up tasks as you get them from Konar, probably since there wasn't any way for them to get the necessary info before release. Tomorrow it'll probably be fine.
---
Definitely a skip task for me , requires too much attention due to special attack and the drop table doesnt make it worth doing . Hopefully they'll buff the table , or make the special attack less punishing for getting hit .
---
You're looking at this the wrong way. Your way of looking at it would make sense if this was a game where you were locked into using one method of combat forever, without switching. This is not the case though. You *must* compare *all methods of combat to each other*, because this is a game where each method can be used equally. 
---
You seem to think that because Range has set a certain standard for DPS on certain creatures, that it cannot be fairly compared to other weapons because those weapons will never compare to the unreasonably high standard set by range. This is a poor way of looking at the problem though, because Range *is* available to use with it's current obscenely high power level, so *there is no reason to NOT use it if it's available*. 
---
If a money making boss exists, and there are multiple methods of killing it, people will want the method that is the most profitable. A good example is comparing the BGS/Blowpipe method, to the DHCB method. The BGS/Blowpipe method is *actually more kills per hour*, however, the DHCB method is more profit per hour. This gives you a real comparison, because these two methods offer different things. If you are only hunting for the pet, you would want more kills per hour. If you care more about profit, you'd want the cheapest but most effective way.
---
Now throw the lance into the mix. It's neither more GP/H nor Kills per hour. So why would you ever use it there when better methods exist? That would be like using Holy Water on demons when the Arclight exists and is simply a better weapon. No one uses inferior weapons if they don't have to, because this game does not lock you into one style of combat. Because all styles are equally available to a character, all styles must be comparable.
---
No, but it seems pretty stupid that you‚Äôre not able to kill a boss for the task regardless of the location. 
---
&gt;I am no man..... OwO
---
People saying leave it as it is are DHCB mains 
---
Did you get the pet

Try putting on a slayer helm and using the ‚Äòcheck‚Äô option  on it / an enchanted gem

I play with music on fairly often, but it always ends up with me playing the same 10 songs over and over and eventually getting more annoyed than relaxed.

Shoutout to Complication and Prime Time for driving my wife crazy. She doesn't even play OSRS but can mock both songs as they are burned into her memory.

Tried that. And are you sure? Day 1 I picked up a Konar task and it worked just fine... "Trolls in the Troll Stronghold"

those are prims idiot

I just bring my alts to drag the crabs to singles and splash. Fuck you crashing shits.
---
To the fucking top
---
I have the same thing and all I have to do is right click my helm to look for my assignment info. Sometimes it says I have 0 points and 0 streak but once I finish my task it fixes itself. Seems to be happening with Konar tasks, haven't went back to Nieve to look if it happens with her yet. 
---
Even more alpha shit is bring DH and a rock cake or some shit, you just 1 hit the crabs.

Haha thanks for the replies everyone, just wanted to get some feedback, larger than the clan's.

Realizing I only played to make it feel like I was productive. Only joined again to play castle wars and realized I would never be good at it like I was back in the day, staked 350m and won. Staked bank again and lost. Good bye old friend 
---
Lol. Super noob. Wiz tower lesser demon f2p. Literally every world is full though. I moved on after hopping a bunch, finding an empty world and instantly getting crashed three times. There are better things to do anyway, this is just nostalgic af to me.
---
I understand that but why should someone who's been off of tutorial island for 10 minutes be able to change endgame content
---
Who knows, maybe it's different for me than for you somehow. None of my tasks have registered with the plugin when I first got them from Konar, and all of them have worked perfectly after hitting the check option on one of the items.
---
I just did 240 of these and no Konar drops feels bad man
---
Legend

I hope so

Grand larsony is a criminal charge, not a civil one. The prosecutor would most certainly be able to convince the perp to plea it down and plead guilty

Those god damn birds knockin off my god damn stick

Everyone who got to do hunter after birdhouses will never know the agony

But that goes against the entire point of using Konar in the first place. If you want to do that the use Nieve/Steve/Duradel.

They already are? The leather required to make the gloves is tradeable and you can revert the gloves themselves to the leather again if you want to sell it back.

200m all or no vote. Don't want noobs voting in my game.

I misunderstood, I thought you meant passive cooking alone, not including the exp
---
You also dont have to do ALL of the damage to get the kill....
---
the news post made me curious too, i went there for the task and it wasn't crowded at all.
---
The spots seemed quite evenly spaced out aswell
---
Is this a joke?
---
8008135 what?
---
Wait till you try to safe spot oggresses in f2p on consair cove. People will berate you as soon as you log in and you will hop only to see every world taken up. Best thing you can do is steal their spot hopefully they get frustrated and leave or ask if anyone will be leaving soon and waiting. 
---
Completely incorrect

Cave for slayer task

Expected something shitty tbh. By the end i realised l how wrong i was, up you go, towards saradomin's embrace!

Why are you at crabs in mid 80s though

K bud 
---
Wtf is this combat 3 nonsense... Are you trying to say level 3 or just trying to trigger me
---
Im very happy you actually responded, some people seem to just post shit and leave it be - i dont think it will need an animation update, but perhaps in fear of making range too op make the quiver use the cape slot as to not wear avas and quiver same time? If it was to stack with void and avas it would quickly become very op after some consideration
---
Cheers mate
---
I can't believe there are people that think it needs a nerf lol. Maybe everything's too good and we need blanket nerfs, but it's behind the curve. It's only bis on a dragon that was already meleed, and it's still *behind the scythe* for olm's left hand ffs.

For sure man I‚Äôm on mobile for now but if you shoot me a message on disc I can get you going

A pet is only worth as much as the effort you put into getting it, at least in my experience :)

Pro tip:  Add the magnifying glass thing to your screen so you can easily drop the iron ore instead of clicking the tiny icons..
---
Who the hell is chershi
---
Honestly make it similar to Motherlode Mine upper floor. Allowing multiple catches from each pool and have it disappear after a random timer instead. Might have to rebalance xp rates around this, but it will be a much more enjoyable gameplay.
---
Elvarg

Literally impossible.

I dont get why people get so bummed out by it... its legit so easy to find an empty world usually only takes me one or two hops for dust devils...

---
Thrownaxes are available at the ranging guild. I believe in you, OP.
---
I've read the wiki and I don't see any suggestions for best xp/h or points/h, just a list of bosses and the points they get. Do you see it elsewhere?
---
Good to know about the rock cake, thanks!

Hes right you know, you all just have autism

hes a btw btw.

Dota 2, path of exile, and pubg subreddits off the top of my head. I'm not really sure what upwards trend you've been seeing though as I've not noticed that myself, It seems just as sporadic here as any other sub.
---
Its already set to tap to drop?
---
Yeah and there shouldn't be too much of a concern for devaluing questing for barrows gloves when it comes to the range bis. There already is dhide vambraces which are no quest req gloves pretty damn close to bgloves.
---
Never mind I found the 'strategy' article!

lots of green dragon bots

Training slayer. Currently 71, almost 72. Just want to hit 75, then ill be taking a break from slayer to afk gargoyles.

Honestly pretty much any afk skill.  Might require a couple extra cutouts, but with setting up your camera correctly and not moving it, it wouldn't be that hard for a lot of things.

Crafting, fletching, herblore, smithing, cooking, construction, alching, pretty much any afk woodcutting, ardy knights,

Teleing between games?

It's funny you say that because as a Brit, I associate this sort of music with mainland Europeans.

Fun fact: the US has done nearly a thousand nuclear weapons testings on their own soil and still wonders why everyone is getting cancer 
---
I understand this reference and am agreed 100%
---
What? The assets already exist. The code is already written. It wouldn't be building from the ground up, it'd be copying code from tutorial island to the other npcs and modifying it accordingly. There's no engine work to be done.
---
Are you talking about the Euro? Because the UN has no control over the Euro. 
---
Shit I forgot to blur my run energy, rip gg
---
&gt;They're already pretty weak to stab, lowering their stab defense further could aid to buff the weapon's viability without directly buffing the weapon itself.
---
That's an acceptable direction to take things, yes. But straight up making the DHL better is the wrong direction to go in.
---
&gt;Buffing the DHL on Dragons specifically does not invalidate the Rapier/Scythe, and even if it did, it would be for dragons only, which is fine.
---
&gt;There are plenty of places the Rapier/Scythe are miles better than the DHL, allowing the DHL to outclass them at Dragons only is fine.
---
It's **already better than those two weapons for dragons**. It does not need to be even better on top of that. 
---
So it helps out a lot?
---
What‚Äôs the tl;dr of this massive novel 
---
oof
---
How often are you people disabling extensions?! Current system seems perfectly fair to me.
---
Why wouldn't you just go pk now and slowly level up. I feel like at 60 cb you are going to have much higher hp than that.  
---
I have an acc that is pretty prodded and it has 66 hp at 56 cb. If you are solely training in f2p you will have much more hp. 
---
You could be running the wildy agility course and someone will still go out of the way to kill you, it's just how it is lol
---
Jagex calculation skills on point. Also 3.99  ¬£¬† convert to 4.51 ‚Ç¨ (current rate of 1 - 1.13). However 1 Bond is 5.69 ‚Ç¨ (=5.04 ¬£).
---
Tbh Jagex is scamming us. I know this has been discussed multiple times, but they can hardly justify their membership fees for what they do. Jagex only lifes because of nostalgia and an adult playerbase which can afford their exorbitant fees.
---
For the fun of killing someone
---
Fuck, I forgot to blur my seeds. Rip account, gg
---
I don't really see why. They just need to do it. Pipe needs a tick nerf, TBow needs to move to T90, and DHCB needs to go back down to 20%. It'd help with balancing the entire game and lessen powercreep risks in the future.
---
Everyone acts like a rounded back is universally bad for you...

I turn sound on for certain afk things with sound indicators and when im doing high level pvm such as the inferno. Other than that I play with sound off the entire time.

&gt;noted dragon bones
---
Well a good bit are otherwise they wouldn't kill you. Of course they arent going to waste inv space for unnoted bones. So much idiocy in this whiny post about trying to use an OP wildy prayer method. 
---
Depending on the rarity of the drop it would have practically no effect on the price of the potions. How hard can it be for you to use your brain?
---
With inflation its pretty much on point plus you can be a member for free forever . If. you play the game. Use the trial to buy a bond and continue buyin bondies. 
---
Screenshot and report it.  Griefing irons is bannable, no?
---
How is this a 50 attack pure using an AGS?
---
I saw a guy with ‚Äú#‚Äù in his name the other day. Must be a bug to bypass the name change screen. 
---
No, it really isn't. You can get a 14 day alt for what 3m? You make that back in a few hours, well worth the time saved either banking or leaving your drops on the floor. Either way you win.
---
And don't even come at me with 'but alt needs levels'. Sure the entire 30 mins tops to unlock high alch at a cost of like 150k runes?
---
No rune pouch yet! 
---
You won't get a task you can't do I'm pretty sure. Just kill the trolls standing outside troll stronghold.
---
Lmfao so dangerous that people kill it in 1:30 easily. If you wanted to say that about raids or ToB I would agree but Vorkath just isn‚Äôt dangerous or hard.
---
Also I‚Äôm not saying skilling should be more profitable, but isn‚Äôt that the point of unique PvM related drops that are worth millions? The purpose of dragon hide and bones, or anything that fits thematically?
---
Hell, it drops plenty of dragon weapons, dragon arrow and dart tips, wrath runes, seeds, there‚Äôs plenty of stuff there that makes it profitable without making everything else in the game meaningless.

Oh shit. I just realized they cant pass tutorial island. Cant fish a shrimp, cook a shrimp, cant kill a rat. Vegans dont play rs, thank the rs lords!

Don't listen to him you can get by fine in group raids with 78, I didn't get  90 until 250 kc and all I was rewarded with was a little point boost of maybe around 500-1000 each raid.
---
Just the tip
---
The magic tutor just automatically puts them into the rune pouch when you pick them up. I was more going for a feature that automatically loots them, similar to how the ring of wealth can pick up coins into your inventory for you. 
---
Its faster to just drop it in the chest 5 feet away than drop it plus better GP. 
---
As long as I get fireworks

But if they could skip tut island they could bake potatoes.

Oh hell yeah. A "mini"quest that requires 100% favour in all five houses? Sign me up for a better reward. 
---
Less people doing hydra over time
---
More people using and buying spaghetti staff and scythe as they come into the game more and get cheaper. 
---
So it's possible they go back up to some mid ground. 
---
ive seen lvl 95s try to tb at rev caves in full ghostly with rune crossbows and they actually couldn't believe how unlucky they were to splash so often.
---
Its a suggestion to the people who play RS who can't find the even ground, the only reason why people voted no mostly on the poll is because of raids, which I don't think you understand.

I don't think you'd care about that 3.99 if you have 1999 to buy bonds...

Just tallied up what I am prepared to spend - 5mil, I do already have a cannon and approx 1k cballs.

I could comfortably do Dags at lighthouse with a cannon I think

Yes, let‚Äôs lock a combat weapon behind skilling requirements! Stupid ass idea.

It's not bannable unless he starts following me around worlds and intentionally continues to crash.  At that point he's just being an asshole and competing for resources knowing I'll budge as an Iron because it's a waste of my limited resources for no experience or loot.

This hits me hard.
---
He's 40 defence and has HP levels so he can use the bone dagger(p) to spec on defensive. Then because of KBD's size you can walk under it and prevent it from hitting you til it dies from the poison.
---
This seems kinda OP.

*can be brought at any general store for 50gp

Damn dude, one archers ring is okay, a pet is okay, but both of them on the same kill? not to mention, 22 kc... well anyway buddy, I hate you :3
---
Ah thought so. I'd heard that people gamble real world money there but no idea how it works. It's only my second month back in RS in a decade and a half so I'm a big noob. 
---
Shit I'm retarded. I forgot its a 75 req and not 70.

Support if during mm1 instead of killing the boss you just call in for an A10 attack run

It'll be polled after Song of the Elves. It's not the focus right now, so they aren't talking about it.

Well he did screw her over with the clip he made leaving out so much info. She's getting shit on in the highlight videos for it. Kinda sucks she has to just take it

Still customer service in every sense of the phrase

Gravy baby :)

Boss defense doesn't increase, just HP. Custom hard rumble to remove any bosses that have special effects and put yourself in a corner using absorb, rock cake, and super set. Flick rapid heal prayer (or guzzle rock cake to get to 1 hp every time you auto heal)
---
I am so sick of this autistic combat-triangle-equality balancing shit.  Let barrows gloves stay where they are for ranged, game would be boring if everything was equal for all the combat styles
---
and reddit is the room for discussion doesn't matter if its tomorrow or now, its a way of telling people who are refusing the buff because it would make olm too easy.

I got my gf(ex now) at the time to play this game,She got hooked on fishing, woodcutting &amp; cooking (she was gonna go for 99 cooking first), made a new account to play with her, We were gonna do Animal magnetism but I said lets do it next week, Didn't think that last logout notification i see from her was would be the last time i see her on this game. She broke up with me the next week. To this day i still am thinking what went wrong. Anyways good bye emmjayx hope you're doing good.

Would be nice seeing it store any bones. Nice feature to runescape

It's not being worked on yet. Kebos was first to be done, then prif, then warding

How do you even get 600k/h doing bloods?
---
Axelmoralis thanks for the 5k, only reason I'm playing today. If your out their man I hope everything is ok.
---
It's much more then that. His punching form is great first of all. Then, look at the way he moves. Exclusively pivoting from spot to spot. Several times he purposefully hits the ball hard so he can bob and weave out of the way, then immediately gets the ball going again.
---
For someone so young, he's bloody talented. 
---
Congartulations 
---
Yeah I wanted back my old account just for the name and nostalgia. Was gonna make it a cball alt or something and fuck around in RS3 maybe.

Can't get anything when I try to recover it, never was a member and haven't lived in that house since 2008.
---
What's this High Effort Content doing on /r/2007scape?
---
I have a very nice set of tele tabs and some items for your house for you! /s
---
I've had people ask how many more I have left (both iron and non) or if I see someone hopping and I'm close to finished task I tell them to wait since I'm almost done to give them the spot.  I'd say ever 3-4 tasks someone crashes.  It's not super common but common enough to the point where it's annoying.
---
Good to know, I'll do this, and grab some combat potions. Thanks!
---
Anyone else stressing out with his form and back with those last few? I didn‚Äôt want to watch 
---
ya 
---
i have send you a message
---
Are you a pure or do you have def/prayer? If you aren't a pure then I would do dags like Brian suggests. 
---
Wish I could give someone my account. I played a lot during a 6month period. Safe spotted a dwh, got 82 construction, chinned 90 mage and range all to prepare for zulrah. Then I just stopped. I love the game tbh, but my friends just aren't interested in it. And that's enough for me to quit. 
---
Cant rule it out

Drops are made to be op knowing they will be nerfed to keep play numbers high.

And there is like 6-7 posts today on it?

idk if joke but you get 1k slayer xp(and hunter) for doing a quiz in varrock museum basement. It gets you up to 9 without doing any actual slayer tasks. The player in the screenshot has 9 slayer.
---
This has been brought up, doesnt make sense with lore.
---
also "might affect pvp" yeah no shit its going to affect pvp, this will bring new fletching meta into the game and on top of that it will introduce a shit ton more gold into the game as it will require an alch value higher than magic logs.
---
How rare are these supposed to be? I just started farming with oak trees and got 2 in one run.
---
:&gt;
---
You mean like the dragon platebody, zenyte jewelry, onyx jewelry, almost all ranged ammunition, the dragonfire shield, godsword blades, and the blowpipe?
---
if anyone else does damage at all you don't get the kill as an iron man 
---
Yes you would be able to store any bones
---
Not sure but i thought they would be more rare then that haha

CALL 911 NOW

Yeah probably.

Aarrgg67, Dude was a legend. Older gentleman but super humble. I use to collect all types of secondaries for him and he would buy them for top GP. This was ~10 years ago so no telling if he quit or passed on. Either way, thanks for all the hours of grinding and enjoying the game.

&gt; bone dagger(p)

How to get poison though? Unless OP got lucky with Observatory quest.

you're wrong here with iron man accounts

Honestly even the parts that had no editing was well done. I'd love to see more "skits" like this.

I don't know either. He's acting like just because something's in the game means that's the way the dev's intended it to be.

 That's why I got a maxed pool, jewellery box, and regen bracelet

yeah graceful

No, THIS IS SPARTAAA

are you retarded? It's a twitter response stating that they could actually buff it but by not fucking the economy over and ruining raids.
---
Wilderness should be multi everywhere, probably an unpopular opinion but it's supposed to be the most dangerous place in the game, yet they fill it with PVM content to try and get people in then make it easy for PVMers to get away from PKers. Fyi, I'm not a pker. I love PVM, but stuff like this is pure stupidity. Wilderness is dangerous, people should know this, stop making it easier for PVMers to do things in the wild.
---
Definitely. 
---
I don‚Äôt pk cause I‚Äôm probably trash at it.. but if I see a lvl fucking 50 with inferno cape there is absolutely no possibility of me even thinking about getting my ass slapped by him 
---
Will I be good fighting the monsters as soon as I unlock her or should I level up a bit more?
---
probably stabbed it with his poisoned weapon and then clicked underneath the king black dragon so that the king black dragon was unable to manoeuvre itself into an attacking position on this hardcore iron man and henceforth outlasted the dragon until its demise
---
Other dude sounds like a tool. I do the same thing. Triggers discussion. 
---
Another one that doesnt know how ironman works. Nice
---
Sorry for your lost I hope he can recover from his illness
---
Oh thanks, I'll appreciate that, I really doesn't expect to get the pet now, I just decided to get farm as my first 99 so I'm rushing it with fruit trees, watermelons, poison ivy herbs and farming contracts, so this happened :) 
---
Right, except that's something that happens maybe once or twice a day. If you're skilling and afking you're likely to log out several times throughout your session and having to readjust the quantity settings every time would be luck more annoying that adjusting it once when you switch between pvming and skilling

People who cannon at crabs need to not do that anymore. When my friend was training at crabs I'd help him follow cannoners around and kill them with a blowpipe so they'd leave. Cannons are the real crashers.
---
Yes if there's one thing pvp/the game needs it's a range buff
---
Do you honestly see nothing wrong with an msb (i) that would be like 2k max that can shoot dragon arrows? The *only* downside to using it would be the lack of specbar so you can't 1 tick an ags spec but it would still be retarded strong.
---

It's runescape. You lose some efficiency by not doing them individually.

I've tried that and the client (apart from the Runelite menu) freezes unfortunately.

Dragonstone jewelry is used in just about all content from early to almost late game.

14-18 hours. I was on winter break, so I decided to use this time on MLM. 
---
Im working on an alt atm, rune arrows msb at nmz is really good. Around 70k exp/h at that level. 
---
That is fair. Melee was the main one where it would be devalued. Though generally when you offer an upgrade to an item, it is good to keep similar reqs when possible. So while a new BiS Ranged Glove may not *NEED* to req RFD or such, it is still good to lock it behind some quest or such rather than letting players buy the BiS Ranged Glove and skip the upgrade from RFD all together.
---
That's actually brilliant. Since lynx titan would be the only one voting and he's against warding! Seriously, no warding.

Silenced the ironman instincts to appeal to a larger audience
---
Actually public perception plays quite a big role in the market. Regardless of how rare the drop was, I can guarantee that keeping a 2.5k brew drop on the KDT would affect the price as people believe for them to be far more common.
---
Whilst I agree that removing spec trading was a shite move and actually further killed the wilderness, there's 0 chance it's going to be reverted to the old way. Pointless trying
---
Most people on here think that teams should be fighting in multi and have no really clue about singles teams and deep wildy. So you're posting in the wrong place if you're trying to get the backing of pkers. 
---
I really enjoy this suggestion. It's a nice way to keep the intended design choices for these respective weapons, i.e. ballista is a PvP KO weapon, while giving it an actual consistent use in PvM, i.e. a "tank buster," to reward using a slower weapon class.

Exactly this, get really annoyed when people get mad at sandles or boots, you should be hyped!

I'm all for more non-cannonable Slayer mobs
---
Started runecrafting bloods to get 99 and make some decent profit on the side. Hydra has completely crashed blood runes right as I was about to sell a massive chunk of them and now they're worth dirt.
---
Probably lost out on about 10M alone because of that stupid was Hydra drop table. 
---
no, but they look fucking sick and I would buy the slayer one. maybe two of them in case one tears.
---
are these desings in any way copyrighted? if not, i might just copy the design for my own hoodie
---
Yeah might be time to trade him for some death runes. 
---
(or start selling them myself)
---
Wait the hydra tail will actually be useful now?
---
kills me almost every time
---
You can also turn it in for death runes.
---
I could see the arguement being that with other BiS for melee it's extremely difficult to see them leading to fights that feel bad, but I doubt that's a serious enough issue to get it fixed.
---
Shoutout Jadehaden123. I miss doing Pre-EOC Rev caves with you.

yes to your yes to his no

I can't tell if you mean because wintertodt wasn't out when you were a low level or if you think 10 how accounts cannot do wintertodt, because they can and excel at it

Repost purposes 
---
For one encounter that half the game don‚Äôt do...
---
Dragon plate body isn‚Äôt used in any sense of the game other than fashionscape. It also is armor, not a weapon. Zenyte also isn‚Äôt a combat weapon. Ranged ammunition is dropped from monsters. DFS can be made by giving coins to Oziach, igniting the need for smithing. Creating a godsword is 50-50 since only the blade itself requires smithing, not attaching the hilt. The blowpipe is fair although the tanzanite fang isn‚Äôt locked behind skilling.

the lance is as big an upgrade over the rapier as the scythe is over the lance. another 10% buff like was proposed and the lance will be BETTER than the scythe and the scythe is already worse in solos/for pbs because of 4 tick weapons performing so much better there. 
---
it's tragic that people might actually ruin what little benefit the signature item from tob had because they don't know how to do research and come to conclusions based on totally anecdotal evidence

You really think people who are dumb enough to click on the streams, then the links, then enter in their account info are going to be able to understand that the date in the background means when it was filmed?  Even if you put "Filmed on XX/XX/XXXX" its not going to register to these people that it's a phishing stream.

Definitely, I actually tried storing some of these things in the toy box, was surprised you can't.

that's what I like to call "free loot"

Turns out it's running Windows 10 Long Term Support Branch from 2016 but has the latest security updates. With very little to no bloatware. It's called the Subor Z+? It's got a Ryzen based processor with Vega graphics, so it's an APU.  Apparently they plan to release their modified Windows IoT(Internet of Things) version with 4 exclusives, sometime Q1 2019. Linus (from what I saw) didn't really run any games to really test how capable it is for gaming.

If you can get 2 coal for less than 655 (more like 440 at current prices) you profit.
---
It's also very good for wyverns. I've gotten two of them through Konar, and this thing rips.

i quit my main for a btw for a month just to see what it was like, when i was getting so much joy from small goals and milestones, like getting a certain drop like a rune scim, or talisman for RC (at very low level) everything seems so much more rewarding.  
---
long story short my main hasnt had sub since.
---
I think I replied to the wrong post here, don't even remember reading yours tbh

But to answer your question, bots can efficiently accomplish almost any repetitive task you want, whether its resource gathering or turning resource X into item Y. This inflates the supply of both and therefore reduces the reward for genuine players who do the same activity.

I‚Äôm mid level and got that exact task too. I struggled big time just killing one dragon. Luckily I had enough points to skip. I went back to Nieve and she gave me ~90 Ankous to kill which is so much faster. I probably won‚Äôt go back to Konar unless I‚Äôm much higher in cmb level.

Pics or didn't happen

Or like, just the regular timer he has in this same app

Yeah but in that case, having you bottomless compost bucket would take you 65 farming AND luck. It's a drop after all... Every other skilling upgrade has a predictable time to get (it was like 2 days of motherlode mine or me to get the coal bag for example) But in this case you can't predict when will you get it. But of course, I get what you mean, it's strange that it doesn't have any explanation of why it can hold so many compost. Also I don't think that 1 compost giving it 2 charges is okay

Jeez I've not been lucky then, just went through my 2000th token and I'm still stuck on iron. Fml

If you do the dynamite route, it's not that bad. Just have to wait for the charcoal.
---
I always do nechs single in slayer tower.  Their drops are better than the ones in the catacombs. And I like to make money while I slay. Bursting barely makes money and is very click intensive. Melee slaying is chill.
---
Still think about you JazzTheRabbitnumberiforgot.
---
This took effort. I am so sorry
---
Kill it
---
It is.....9,000,000iq
