Not homophobia? The white robes and nazis and cannons isn't homophobic?

Guys, we shouldn't be so hard on this tiny indie game developer. They're new to this whole running a game thing. You shouldn't expect them to operate like an actual experienced company.
---
75 defense isn’t going to be a noticeable difference in pvm, mostly you’ll be praying to negate the main damage also range would be your primary damaging attribute when it comes to pvm due to most bosses high defense level but then again my

man, it’s your account make it like you want!

Does the website world select method not work for you? I get the error from the app but if have been connecting just fine through world select page. I do have to try a couple different worlds but once I'm in it works just fine
---
The pve part in the wildy would be easy to balance if you made those changes, so i wouldnt worry about that.

I am glad for the success of surgery. But can you please just stop?                                                                We support you coz we are having a same community and hoping everyone here is happy. But really sick of promoting and tf no risk staking.                                                 Do you even understand what you are talking about?                                                           If you found any bug.tell jmod and report but not trying to make it as a content OK?
---
Apart from dragon/rune/etc cups
---
They’ve been like this since last night for me
---
The people who have dumped over 2k hours into the game for an equivalent cash stack? The ones that are now realizing they could have just waited to create the acc until now to get that cash in a month in bh?
---
Pay extra for account slots, 1 account still costs 11$
---
You don't understand that a lot of people keep their subs renewing? i am baffled how you can read what i said and come to this conclusion.
---

---
Someone is subbed during the time that the servers crash or the game is hard to play due to instability.
---
Days equaling downtime is tacked onto the end of existing subs.
---
If someone isn't subbed when these days are gifted, mark these accounts and email them with a way to activate their account for membership for however long was gifted.
---
This doesn't apply to accounts that don't have memberships at the time... and most of these people who would then be affected are probably going to have been repeat subscribers.
---
1-3 days does not equal a lost month. The lowest amount of days able to be purchased is 14 days through bonds.
---
Opportunity cost does not factor here. How is this a debate? The cost is covered by all the money they're leeching from the community like this, and you know what? I'll bite. They lose when it comes to opportunity cost by choosing to ignore the community with support like this, they lose subs. Talk about opportunity cost all you want, i don't think you guys grasp what it means though.
---
Takes a few minutes.
---
Get a lance or dhcb
---
Thanks, Hero
---
Hope you get your 35 cents back for your troubles.
---
Last year it was during the Winter event. It was part of the reward IIRC. I didn’t do it then because I didn’t have a btw. They did the same for Halloween this year though, where you could get all the previous years items like pumpkins, and Halloween masks.
---
Not storage in the house so still not that great for UIM but hey, we choose to limit ourselves.
---
Man castle wars was the shit! I remember doing it as a kid, and I also fondly remember chopping the vines outside of castle wars with my dragon hatchet, I also remember my dad complaining about that because I was sat in the one spot all day not doing anything.
---
Eh idk. I'm 87 slayer 80 cons and like a 2m cash stack at all times.
---
I'm sure if you play efficiently you'll have a lot of gp but I just mess around a lot.
---
*the real Quest Cape. Sorry Galvek was exhausting af.
---
It's been a long journey, i started my goal at the beginning of this year and I play somewhat casually. Iv made many friends along the way and  sadly lost a few through my journey.
---
I dont know what I should do next, perhaps get it trimmed? But then I will have to exceed combat 85. I only play on 1 account and dont want to invest in another account.
---
Massive thankyou to everyone who helped me. And a massive thanks to Galvek for rinsing my bank from 2m down to 50k.
---
Are my eyes dreaming or is that not a bgs in his inventory? Engage brain before make comment.
---
This is something that does nothing for Jagex except lose them money 
---
The only way I ever see this being a thing is by increasing your membership charge anyway.
---
Sorry for the delayed answer, ive been working cleaning my house because we had some problems :P. Im near to secure my bond just tanning dragonhides, then imma start working on other skills :P. Do you have another recomendation besides Slayer? :D
---
Revenants yes but I've never seen how frequently pkers come to it. I always see clips of people dying to huge teams as if it happens every 10 minutes but it can't happen that much can it?
---
I know, your the literal meaning of one.
---
Massive grats bro! I just got the Olmlet pet recently so I need to start grinding out some CMs too! 
---
Would you say purple sweets is worth investing into for solo CM?
---
Who gets the reimbursed membership?
---
i had about 5k adamant bolts just disappear from my inventory in what seemed to be a glitch.. they werent on the ground, nor were they in my bank / ge. am i shit outta luck or are these one of the things jagex will fix
---
ty
---
Uhm well, yeah, we vote for them? What exactly is your argument?
---
Oh, can you give me more details? I would love to have an afk method to lvl up and make money while i study or do homework :P
---
I mainly play on mobile, you can still get online via mobile. Open your browser on your phone, go to the osrs website, login, select a world and it'll open your mobile client for that world. Yesterday I picked an Australian world to get it work, today are UK world's.
---
I agree that this shouldn't have to be the work around, but it's what works for me at the moment.
---
Nope. Only a bit of lag here and there.
---
Thanks for being so quick, didn’t know the woodcutting was also the same way
---
my RC pure would like a few words.
---
The sandwich lady...
---
Yea 100%, great for tick eating and for keeping your run up the entire raid. Kinds pricey, but the increased points(and drop rste for items) will help pay for it
---
I disagree. The game is down for mobile users, but not for desktop users.
---
If anything, they should only comp players who subscribed through Google Play, _and_ who have the majority of their playtime on mobile.
---
How does selecting a world on google chrome supposed to open up my osrs app?
---
What are those boots?
---
Nice.
---
It's not even CLOSE to 500 an hour and I have no idea where you pulled that number from. You can complete 3 tasks an hour if you complete your task the exact second it's given to you. Which is 30 points. Then it's 3 points per kill. Let's say you're on streak so 5 points instead. This doesn't count into the fact that you get griefed by other players, use up all your skips, and you need to get your other account as a target which takes time. If you use hotspot you need to run there and you die alot etc. 500 is a joke of an estimate. It's more like 50-100.
---
For reference 500 points is 12.5m. nobody is getting 12.5m per hour by boosting with one or a couple accounts.
---
Soul wars would be mine
---
Clyde frog?!?
---
Being the fact this is a runescape page... I downvoted. So you no longer have the 123 karma.
---
*not a care was given that day that lost redditor posted unrelated things on 2007scape reddit page*
---
I've had the same issue. Sometimes it works when I use a VPN and change the location to another country. Don't know if it actually helps or if it's random.
---
I just noticed last night impossible to connect to servers
---
In the case of bonds, for example, they're pushing out the timeline that a person would need to renew with a new bond, moving that dollar amount collected by 1-3 days. That's profit they don't receive.
---
If we were to take the extreme---Jagex giving out 90 days membership or something like that, they'd lose money of course. The same thing applies on a small scale. The opportunity cost is the money they should have received for the 1-3 days we're discussing. If that makes any sense over text.
---
Setting quest goals (legends, hero’s, dragon slayer 2, etc.) can be rewarding. Makes you train skills and explore new areas/monsters
---
For the amount of actual measurable hours spent every month?  And compared to other methods of entertainment per hour?  Well well WELL worth $15!
---
I don't think you can even flex with 100 karma
---
They don't compensate  we've had way worst down times b4
---
It sucks but it is what it is
---
Base price, plus $2 per extra slot?

Also stfu this problem has not persisted since release

Maybe look at the stickied posts b4 posting...

Noice

Back in 2007 Runescape (Jagex) had contrilling shares bought by the same company that bought Nexon. They then sold all shares in 2016 to some Chinese investors.
---
Yeah exactly, it’s pretty obvious that Jagex staff has a ton on their plates to deal with in this game.  There’s only so much they can get done and they have to focus on development to keep people interested.  There’s a reason Zulrah bots are getting 100k kills without bans.  They just don’t have the resources.
---
So yeah it’s money and time.
---
U get the rewards for all the past events
---
This applies to all holidays events
---
You are out of luck. Make sure they aren't equipped?
---
it would cost them 0, as in zero, they aren't a real physical thing that they have manufactered, they offer us a service, a service that is already paid for, people might not unsub because they didn't get to play for 2 days but that will add up to the other issues jagex might encounter as a company and lead to a potential unsub, companies ought to keep their costumers in long term, that's why they often don't like to be portrayed in a bad light and will change things in the face of negative criticism, keep the consumer happy you keep them around longer, 2 days might be a tear drop, but those tears can add up and overflow the glass eventually
---
Thanks for the reply! Yeah that’s what I figured, it’s an account that’s not really limited to anything but is still open to non-maxed pking which is cool. Got it though, yeah both of those are out of my price range for now hahaha but that makes sense now. Sick account
---
And it’s like 20 years old which is the sad part... for a very simple looking game!
---
But finding all the mobile only players would be damn near impossible.
---
Jealous of your ability to connect to mobile
---
No you bring gp and noted bones but right out of the remmington house portal there is a guy that goes by the name of phails hes your guy. Use your bones on him. He will un note your noted bones.
---
Were there gay cavemen?
---
Also try Twisted League worlds!
---
Pay Pay da frawg is also my bf.
---
I fully agree. Otherwise: you only get xp when an xp drop hits, so that's 1 tick per xp drop -&gt; everything is 1m xp/hr.
---
Even something like 0.1% would help. Negligible difference for each individual player, but still a large gold sink given how huge the GE trading network is.
---
Good look I'll try that
---
id give it to anyone with members month of december
---
Thanks homie. You’re a life, bone, and money saver.
---
They don’t even give out prizes won and promised from years passed.
---
Ayy aha also why down vote
---
I'm allowed to defend good people when a random stranger talks crap on the internet without backing it up. At least I'm being transparent. And my rs name is kunit66 so it's not as if I'm being anonymous here like the other guy. Everything is on the table from my side of things.
---
theyre like shitty chaos druids because everyone camped chaos druids
---
ehh id rather cheaper method in cheese taters,stew,pizza plus heal more in 1 slot other than the stew still a nice vid tho
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT I need to do that quest...
---
&gt;If I ever get incorrectly banned, I will be charging back 5 years of p2p.  I recommend everyone to do the same.
---
Gl with getting more than a year of that
---
Don’t choose best world for you. Go into world select and manually choose your world.
---
the pvp middle class has disappeared via learning from twitch/youtube or leaving for other content.
---
since new players have to volunteer to become the bottom class, the bottom class has disappeared too.
---
Still is for people who’ve been subbed since.
---
::Rendershadows makes all the difference
---
Not even a week, I’d be happy with one day per day it was down.  That seems fair to me, seeing as I play 90% of the time on mobile
---
I just don't understand why this is hard. If I buy membership every month, but then get credited a week of membership, that's a week that I will not have to buy membership, thus losing them money they would have made. How much money? I don't know. Maybe they predict that the potential sub money they will lose is less than the amount of money that they will make by not giving out the membership. Maybe they will credit membership, but it needs to get approved. Maybe they don't give a fuck. Honestly if they get this fixed soon it will just blow over and people will forget about it just like everything else they fuck up. But, we don't know any of this information so we can't make any conclusion about how this will effect them.
---
It's sarcasm my dude
---
Its not misleading. It's correct and how people would efficiently do it.
---
Just like farming is over 1m XP/hr. That doesn't mean you can grind hour by hour at that rate, but the way you train that skill is that rate.
---
Saradomin crozier
---
Xp per hour is the maximum amount of xp earned in one actual hour of training. You can't gain more than 5kish xp an hour with birdhouses.
---
One of my main goals is to beat the inferno with the ruenlite trout cursor plug in because I think it is not respectable if the cape is obtained in any other way.
---
If, for you yourself, are going to spend that many hours on flappy bird?  
---
I think you misunderstand me; osrs gives me hundreds of hours of *entertainment that I want*, and choose to do in my free time.  Compared to other entertainment that i might choose but pay more for; going to the movies, AAA game titles that i am done with in sub 50 hours, etc.
---
yes
---
Why not open up your combat options to prove you are level 85?
---
Wasn’t me
---
So amazing dude, really brightened my day. Thank you &lt;3
---
&gt; the thing is, there are actually ironmen who do pk.
---
Yea, I'm at a point on my mid-lvl iron where I rather would get 15 BH points instead of spending 750 slayer points for a rune pouch. And with the task &amp; hotspot system, 15 points is only 1 or 2 kills. Plus I'm thrilled to actually try it out and see if I can get kills legitimaly.
---
Don’t have to. Comp everyone who’s subbed. I’m sure they have a database of active accounts who are subbed. Again. Not hard.
---
So what is this work around?
---
NOBODY CARES kekw
---
Why are you speaking about yourself in the third person?
---
This community isnt heartwarming either, in general.
---
Wrong.
---
gnome
---
Chrome &gt; runescape &gt; old school &gt; manual select world &gt; choose best world for me &gt; click “open” runescape app pop up &gt; play runescape
---
Refresh the app and keep trying until it works. Works for me and others.
---
yep, pretty sure back in the day tip.it or runehq had a guide on how to do them. I struggled with them until I actually read it
---
Says the man who spec tabs in bh all day. smh
---
Profit or loss from when you first bought them?
---
Bro just buy the yearly mem
---
F
---
Why would it be a nice surprise if it was a loss
---
If only it WAS 2007
---
Lol. Practice in clan wars and tourney worlds before you go bridding in wildy.
---
what? Yes they do lmao...
---
Sauce??
---
Very impressive bsing or well informed, either way an upvote from me. If this is the case, it should be higher on the thread.
---
Don't remember. I think i made this account years ago
---
The word effectively is quite important here.
---
This guy just made a good pun. That's all. Not really worth the sarcasm or ass.
---
Isn't this like the first time the games gone down in ages, you'll survive a little while without it
---
just know about server issues ahead of time forehead.
---
As a desktop user, wholly disagree. It's basically a coin toss whenever I try and open the game on desktop, it's equally as bad on desktop (unless you're using a third-party client).
---
Why?
---
Yes, they do. I was astounded when I learned that there was no GE tax.
---
mobile issues? I had to download runelite to get onto desktop in a resasonable time frame...
---
regular rs loads faster than this game... what the hell?
---
It's like putting $20 into a coat's pocket and finding it like 3 years later. It's still nice, even though you forgot entirely about it and the rate of inflation probably killed the purchasing power of that $20 when you find it.
---
&gt; Where did the thieves guild go? The house in Lumbridge is gone.
---
That never existed in OSRS
---
It automatically responds to phrases like "Kill myself"
---
One of the less obnoxious bots that does that
---
you mean rs3?
---
This is literally the boomer trolley problem lol just reworded. I agree with you man, no reason they can't comp all of us. Or more likely, they make you fill out a web form to only comp those who seek it out
---
I love that Reddit blurred it as NSFW...lol
---
Yeah, I am missing alchs because the clicks aren't registering. It's stuttering for sure :/
---
It’s good to see Jagex has its priorities straight. Who cares about bots ruining the game when you have pesky green squares on puzzles.
---
If this was on RS3, i'd be able to quit my job irl haha (assuming i'd be tempted to sell it)
---
Graardor in invent? Why not include my mans?
---
Don’t make me vomit
---
You can't do it for one minute per day. It takes way longer to get set and get your target to be your other account and to get to the hot spot. It ends up being 50-100 points not 500.
---
How did you fuck your back up that bad from lifting? I'm already scared while doing deadlifts. Fuck that shit
---
Nice,NiceNi,ceNice
---
Crackers are more expense now than the last three years tho so it’s a profit
---
This stopped working for many people
---
$1/day, $12 if you buy the whole month?
---
That’s exp gained since a certain point. You don’t know whether or not that’s his total exp
---
So glad you included your pet rock in the screenshot, it deserves the best
---
Just wait till your 7th avernic
---
Ty makes sense
---
Okay, well go outside or something then. Make use of the butthurt.
---
epic blog
---
You get other uniques and profit along the way... Peabrain logic.
---
Seems like a false ban is also fraud considering you are paying for a service that is no longer being provided and worse then that the previous service has been taken away with no reimbursement or proof.
---
it’s not just happening on mobile, since the update desktop has slowly been getting hit with lag, today being almost unable to do sire it was so bad, hope this gets fixed up soon
---
Looks like that redrawn painting of Jesus.
---
Nice, dude. Looks pretty cool.
---
If they fix it within the next 23 days I just subscribe again. Cancelling a signature on Google Play just makes sure that your credit card won't be automatically billed the following month.
---
Worst case scenario, my subscription just ends and I am reminded that I cancelled and have to subscribe again. This is way better than quitting the game during the next 10 days because they weren't able to fix it and be reminded that I forgot to cancel the billing by the end of the month.
---
Quick way to bypass and play mobile ; 
---
Step 1: close all apps 
---
Step 2: go on osrs website on browser
---
Step 3: select the option world select
---
Step 4: choose a twisted league world
---
Step 5: the app should open, and you can then change to any world.
---
You're welcome :D
---
Isn’t another countries company buy it from China? Or was that something that was just being thrown around. I’m sure I’ve read something about an American company bought it? I don’t know for sure so don’t hold it to me. Just curious.
---
usually 3 man we get 60-65k points i get 17-25k points depending who brings a tbow
---
That’s pretty insane for less than 6 months...
---
hard to believe on the bh world everytime i get a target they are throwing down
---
This doesn't work for a lot of people, only some
---
I don't see any giveaway to it being cmd though, my SSH clients look the same
---
GG
---
What’s the problem? I’ve never had an issue on mobile
---
I got it done on mobile. MM2 maze gave me more problems.
---
Mama says foosballs the devil
---
price of convenience. The old days of retyping the same thing over and over. Nowadays its just guys buying feathers
---
I petition for 50% tax.
---
Both people stake 100m, winner gets 100m
---
That will kill DA
---
And if this game has a million members, then that's $360,000/day. That's quite a lot.
---
What tf are you talking about, is this a mechanic I'm unaware of?
---
Doesn't work for everyone. What device are you using?
---
Damn bro you got a quest cape without any alts????? Madlad
---
yeah i tried i couldn't get paired up with my main acc which is the same level, like ever. Always got paired upwith a 120+ in ags/dharoks
---
There's a good chance this is unique! I checked 83,949,917 image posts and didn't find a close match

Did you activate 2fa to finish the stronghold?
---
She didn’t need to try

It has taken me on average over 20 minutes to get my target as an alt each time I do this. It is NOT effectively 500 pts/hr

Im getting sick of this shit tbh

This is obviously different

Woah thanks so much! Great advice :D
---
Will be a huge help for future attempts &lt;3
---
DC'ed and constant lagging. Its impossible to grind vorkath when you die almost everytime to the fireball att.
---
Oof that's brutal, hopefully your teammates at least got some items for splits
---
F if btw
---
You're not ever going to get rid of RWT unless you remove bonds buddy
---
You’re unironically right
---
Rwters already run games of chance in and out of the game. I honestly think using the duel arena as a medium works the best for actually finding cockroach rwters. A tax will only cause rwt to change platforms and be harder to detect so having most of them at the duel arena is probably a good thing.
---
ngl i did ds2 on pc at 110 combat and i probably spent just as much on recovering gear so props to you
---
You son of a bitch. I'm in.
---
Guaranteed this guy is wearing his ring of wealth
---
I pay $11 a month, I shouldnt have to.
---
Boner inducing
---
Man I played some serious candy crush when I metrod to the hill every day.  No service on the metro makes you do some crazy shit.
---
They were literally a b*tch. Just learn the mechanics and dont be afraid to go in with cheap gear just to get the hang of it.
---
Mm2 glough was such a pain. Ds2 was equally a pain but atleast I could get my items back.
---
Does anyone know how to account for the Xeric's Focus relic on Bitterkoekje's dps calculator? Is there some % I can apply to the dps result? Likewise for accounting for Konar's Blessing (on task and off task).
---
I vaguely remember hearing about them getting threatened by CC companies years ago to clean up their act or they would discontinue service. Probably its what you are talking about here.
---
Yeah they would be calling the clans pussies for teaming. It’s a disgrace honestly.
---
ikr, like just press the "server fix" button its not that hard.
---
I remember I lagged out on a fire cape pre eoc at the age of 12 and I was incredibly heart broken.
---
$132 is going to dinner and an NHL game with friends. It's less than 10 hours of work at minimum wage in many states. For the hundreds or even thousands of hours a year in entertainment you get I'd say it's worth 10 hours of work a year.
---
this has only happened to me 2 times ever. so satisfying lol.
---
It's called a usual day in Edgeville. It's been happening for years but they never get banned.
---
Billing support is pretty good. People dont typically hate on them. It's the absence of support for basically anything else. If it ain't about billing, you gotta come here
---
You get them from*
---
I’d say your best bet would be to find a clan and ask around. I’ve found a lot of groups through youtuber cc’s
---
Worked for me! Thanks for sharing!
---
I'm sorry that you tortured yourself cutting willows
---
Its how you tell if they've been around the block with jagex b4 :p
---
Id love to be proven wrong, but we've had worst outages and gotten jack-shit :/
---
I really tried to get in contact with them. The artwork is all original, no copy/paste. If they really have a problem with it, they can reach out to me. 
---
I would rather give the community the option, even if it is "third party". Jagex made a promise and never came through, so I did. I made sure they're high quality and tried to price them reasonably, and I've made a few for myself to make certain I stand behind what I sell.
---
Maybe I'll get a lot of hate for it, but there's always a few people that might enjoy them so it's worth it.

Trust me when your rent, gasoline, food, utilities go up... you start to notice your money isn't buying you as much as it used to.
---
Also let's not get fixated on the time frame here but it's inevitable. Perhaps it's 1 year or 5 years or 10 years but the point remains that the value of fiat goes down.
---
i somewhat understand what youre saying but at the same time ive risked fought my entire bank before. i didnt loose it though. given that i did loose it id have still kept playing and even then i know of a few people get cleaned at the d/a and rebuild. im still on the side of the current death mechanics being incredibly unhealthy for the game. thanks for the insight though.
---
But how much Con xp is that
---
Tryna help out my fellow scapers!
---
Repost
---
Yeah.. So much for their "flawless macro detection" that's constantly giving false bans.
---
That's amazing because I've received the exact opposite. I can't get anyone or anything to help figure out why my alt has been banned being accused of a macroing major when I've never cheated in the first place playing this game. My "appeal" was clicking a couple buttons and waiting for.... an AUTOMATED RESPONSE!
---
Solid name for him. Congrats!

I haven't been able to use the mobile client for almost four days, even with the workarounds.
---
On desktop the servers have been extremely laggy for 3-4 second periods on a routine basis, but have otherwise felt fine.
---
I definitely wouldn't go pk'ing or anything like that at the moment, but the game has been playable for skilling and most quests.
---
Ouch, thats rough. My condolences.
---
Call me a basic bitch but survived off loved ice capps for a good period of time.
---
Do you like your new Noose Wand little timmy?
---
That’s insane! Congrats!
---
Nice
---
Ok
---
I am not saying I don't agree with you (because I really do agree with you), but I at least wanted to see if you'd tried manually selecting a world from the website. I am in the US and picking a UK or AUS world works everytime whether on internet or my data.
---
Make rc even shittier let's gooo
---
I don't think he's saying it's actually fun
---
he's saying some people have fucked lives and fucked perspectives. There's some crazy people out there on the internet.
---
Worked for my iPhone 6S and my Samsung galaxy tab
---
honestly raids gp rates are so random that u cannot sample a "gp/h" like u either get the dex or u get the arcane, also i can barely stand 34 seconds at vorkath without wanting to log out. its good different people have ways to make gp
---
I’ve seen a lot of people who shit talk jagex for their customer support, but I’ve only had good customer support from them. They gave me a free week of membership when I was having card issues and had my account auto resubsubscribe for membership, and gave me access to my first runescape account that i forgot the password on and didnt have an email to because I had been trying for so long to recover the account to no avail
---
Jagex have said they dont want them to be rare anymore so never
---
$11/mo. Worth it right?
---
Now this is a respectable account. Doesnt rush, doesnt whinge about osrs mobile being down, acquires pets yum and the bags. A truly based individual
---
Dang, can't get it to work on my Galaxy S10+. I also don't get a pop-up notification to open on mobile app, it just switches automatically.
---
Why would we? Game is still playable on desktop. Mobile is just an added feature
---
What they need is a progressive tax system. Lower value stakes taxed at a lower rate, higher at a higher rate. A flat tax on all stakes isn’t the way to go
---
downvoted. move on man. u cant tell a guy with a couple mill to invest the remaining couple mill in getting rangers boots. yes when were talking about massive sample sizes sure but that isnt the case with this guy. hes burning through his small and dwindling bank and telling him to double up for boots is sunk cost now fuck off
---
I’d buy a slayer one or hp
---
there are bots in the game buying junk for huge amounts of gp so they can dupe it whena  reset happens
---
Can you explain for us who don't know?
---
Aha
---
Yup, just paid for membership again because my in game capital was tied up in member items that I was processing for profit, and I haven't been able to access the servers for several days to sell those items to buy a bond before membership ran out. Icing on the cake was subesequently dying to Jad on a task because of server lag.
---
GG yamflux, fix the servers. You're the most recent scam I fell for at this rate.
---
$11 btw
---
One time zulrah killed me while she died and I saw a magic fang in the ground. 
---
Had to lie to my gf and say I was stressed out due to a rough class I didn't actually give a fuck about
---
Thanks Lavine
---
These poor bastards weren’t around for the Lizard Squad who targeted Jagex because they were so easy to pick on. They kept servers offline for days at a time for a few weeks at least. Outages were regular for two months... 
---
Never got anything for it. Never even a peep about possible compensation beyond.. well maybe servers will be on tomorrow 🤷‍♂️ because it depends on daddy lizard squad lol
---
There’s 5 states where that would barely be minimum wage. Most states range from 7.25-9. Any of the states with $13 min wage have it at that because it’s expensive as fuck to live in those places.
---
I agree completely and yes I recall them doing this about 10-13 years ago - I will check
---
Hmm. Odd.
---
What types of "Lag" are we talking about here? Example: What happens if you click really far away from you character in order for it to walk a long distance. Does it:
---
a) take a while before the command registers and it starts walking
---
b) starts walking relatively fast but lags mid-walk and stops frequently
---
1/128 to hit the rare drop table. Rune kite is 1/16,384. To get that drop in a single kill is 1/128\*1/16,384
---
Nice to know bro
---
E TU
---
Seriously, I'm pretty sure this is fake because there is no place on the website to send a custom request like OP claims he/she did.
---
Two memes, I like it.
---
But does he also use the infamous purple paralyzer spec with them?
---
This has pretty much been the response I get whenever I've contacted Jagex support (The helpful part, not the pun part). 
---
I've found them to be pretty good compared to a lot of other companies.
---
You've been dead to me.
---
Yeah, thats the problem, and not people hoarding enough money for millions of other people to live off.
---
But by the time your paranoia would become reality, technology would have far surpassed the demands of humanity and nobody will be required to "earn" a living.
---
I'm fully expecting downvotes cause I know this is a pretty right wing sub, but I know I'm right. Either that or society collapses, no other options are long term sustainable.
---
Remember, the rich guy wants you to be mad at the little guy, easier to lift from your pockets.
---
Nightmarerh was military so im gonna go with him.
---
I find it extremely unlikely that this is real mod behavior or correspondence with the user, unless the accounts were worth significant amounts of money and they saw that
---
They market and sell it as a mobile game.
---
People purchase membership with intent on mobile only gameplay.
---
Imagine buying a paid app with a monthly subscription and having it not work for multiple days with no way to even contact the developer who you are actively paying.
---
It's a fucking disgrace.
---
Not anymore at least... I remember emailing a random jmod back in 2014 over account issues
---
Nah, it’s 1/128 to hit the rare drop table and of hitting the rare drop table it’s 1/128. 
---
The total odds on the monsters drop is 128*128 for 16384. 
---
So while your drop is rare, it’s not 1/2m rare.
---
Buy law runes. Nexus teleport update
---
I would be furious
---
🦀🦀 Jagex's ineptitude knows no bounds 🦀🦀
---
Just make sure to close all apps or it won't work. Make sure you choose a twisted league  world aswell.
---
I’ve literally gotten game time due to server issues with an active during WOD.
---
Whats up with that it stoped working for me aft the south island nz reception fucked out for every one last night
---
Congrats to you.
---
Forgot to cover up your xp top right behind bank window. Thanks for the account pal
---
Go to Ourania world. Visit Ourania. Join CC constantly advertised by bots. Apply.
---
https://youtu.be/4AAmVdw_EFU
---
I tried to do that, somehow the game always loses focus causing me to have to leave the app and reopen it, which is a real hassle
---
Apparently everyone is still complaining, so I thought I'd bring it here
---
You said over a decade before lol.
---
I literally just finished Tears of Guthix, dinged 49 RC, closed RuneLite and immediately saw this comment. Thank you ;_;
---
Because it makes the game more "pay to win". RS3 does that if you're into it ;)
---
You censored the wrong number
---
She later got bored of using flowers as a weapon and asked me for armor and a weapon.  
---
Gave her a halberd to poke goblins over fences.
---
I decided to make a new account cause im playing with my friend, kinda sucks cause my old account was nice but oh well
---
All them pets
---
Australian worlds only ones that worked for me
---
No one would have the funds to purchase 10,000 Christmas Crackers and RWTing that much gp would be too risky, you’d get banned in a heart beat. You’d also crash the market if you injected that many.
---
I remember back in high school I bought one month of membership during my summer break. One month was $8 but 3 was like $16. I ended up finding out I won’t be as busy as I thought, so I asked if there was a way I could pay the $8 difference and get 3 months instead of individually paying $24 for all 3 months as I was a broke high school kid.
---
Jagex said go ahead and buy an additional month and they would credit me the 3rd month for free. That’s back when they had good customer service and would actually reply to messages they were sent. Miss those days.
---
Also jad will spawn wherever the wave 3 monster spawns, so you can set it up so youll be protected from jad when he spawns, the fight cave strategy page on the wiki does a way better job of explaining this idea than I just did
---
Holy shit that's what that message is. "Player x just tried to do something very silly". TIL
---
Really? Where?
---
Yea I’m ready to stab someone to finish my hydra task
---
Worked for me, been logging in and out all day now. Thx bro
---
New Iron man account.
---
 https://imgur.com/oD3gdBx.jpg 
---
Looking for suggestions on what to do.
---
I just got my ardougne easy diary for the cloak/tele finished.
---
Right now I'm mining iron to make some more throwing knives - I like range as my attack style. Want to kill some monsters but am too low of combat for starting slayer, I think.
---
Was killing chaos druids for herbs as I plan to do herblore in the not too distant future.
---
Maybe the requirements for fairy rings next? Idk. Looking for some direction.
---
I dont think any of what you said invalidates my suggestion. Yes we would have to think some of the logical mechanics of this update but it would be for the betterment of pvp.
---
Runecrafting guild and some sort of reimplementation of GOP. 50 rc requirement and make sure none of the xp rates are above 25k/hr.
---
That... already exists.
---
Was GOP the auto rc minigame?
---
I'm assuming you didn't check out the osrs wiki page if you didn't know that.  You really should before you go in again next time, there's lots of very helpful information on the fight, and it shows the different attack animations he has so you can learn what to expect when he begins a certain animation.
---
This is the official skulking weekend lol. Everyone is wcing, mining, or fishing lol. I can’t do my hydra task at all
---
Many players never play on PC. They are now providing a mobile service, which expanded their player base. They offer a service which people are paying for, and which is not working. They should offer refunds or comp them for the days of membership when the service was inaccessible.
---
I voted no because I didn't like their appearance.
---
It was working for me earlier but not anymore :(
---
I was hoping for the full video
---
I found a solution that I hope may help others. 
---
1. Force stop the app. I'm on android so...
---
Tap and hold on app/tap app info/tap force stop.
---
2. Go to the oldschool runescape website and choose world select. (2nd option in the box on upper left side of website)
---
3. Select a low population world. 
---
Deadman mode, nightmare beta, or twisted league world seem to work the best. 
---
From here you should be able to load up the app and then just select whichever world you want without a problem.
---
You're thinking of Runespan.
---
Just use the account recovery system or file a support ticket. Your case isn't magically more important or more unique than the hundreds of other cases just like it.
---
100% for billing issues
---
lol
---
I'd take a free runecrafting level tbh
---
What's the price and where do I buy
---
Jed did it, what makes you think he was the only one?
---
Didn’t work for me =[
---
Sorry :( I don't have that good of editing skills
---
I'm not a goddam peasant.. I'd Tele there like any sane person.
---
Because my bank is only 1m and losing is a heart break ahha
---
It was to attract &amp; repel orbs while destroying barriers at certain rc alters. Wouldn't mind GOP to be (partially) implemented in a larger rc minigame (comparable to the multiple roles in BA) as it does become tedious pushing orbs around for hours. Full costume set took like 40ish hours to complete, that was the real prize to me.
---
Debatable. If its a server hardware issue, Jagex didnt manufacture the servers.
---
To all of them?
---
U no d wae
---
People with a brain to research staking would understand the variance behind it wouldnt stake
---
You either get it or you don’t. 50/50 QED
---
F that at this point. The posts dont need to stop, jagex needs to address their BS. Be pissed all you want but you wouldnt be flooded with these posts if Jagex were on top of their shit as a company.
---
As long as the service remains down jagex and their subreddit deserve to get bombarded with posts complaining about it.
---
whats up with that awful looking subreddit header that looks like rs3?
---
How does one obtain the frog pet?
---
all those double xp weekends will help you rebuild
---
It does if it’s higher than your mage and higher than 2/3rds what your added strength and attack are. Once you get to 99 mage or an average of 75 attack and strength, range cannot increase your combat level.
---
Yeah idk I'm fine with irons playing with mains. To me the larger part of being an iron is having to get all the drops/supplies yourself and actually play all the content instead of just camping vorkath or using RDAs to buy everything
---
Oh shit, matching names
---
Yes please haven't been able to play on my phone for a week. 
---
My morning routine of grinding agility has been missed
---
Depends a lot on what exactly you're asking. Do you want the probability of getting this exact chest, or getting exactly 3 barrows pieces, or three distinct barrows pieces, or at least three barrows pieces, etc.
---
You forgot the 4 other trash white kids spamming racial slurs
---
No it's about actual time invested which is the big point that you're missing clearly.  I can do a bird run in X amount of time, then for the rest of that hour I can go train doing whatever I want.  That's why fletching and magic are considered "0 time" skills because you can literally get 200M exp for both of them while doing other skilling activities.
---
I am interested in the chance of receiving three pieces, I don't care what they are.
---
What are the must-have constructs and rooms in your opinion?
---
Okay those are two separate things, I could see an issue with bigger clans and power concentration, even though we are doing that anyway already, what about the clan bank idea and helping out other people?
---
Was ready for Mod Bare
---
Good ass idea but won’t happen.
---
First off, there’s an important distinction to make, because if you didn’t play RS pre-EOC or when OSRS came out then you may be blissfully unaware the death mechanics were ever different. So, respectfully, you’re wrong on that account.
---
Secondly, losing your items from a coordinated DDOS attack is leagues different than going bossing and dying, going PvPing and losing gear, or even staking and losing your whole bank. The latter three examples involve you actively making a choice to engage in an activity that may result in you losing your gear. Quite frankly, the atmosphere of Old School was incredibly unhealthy prior to the change of death mechanics because people were doing everything in rag gear for fear of getting DDOSed and losing everything.
---
Look man, you’re entitled to your opinion, and I’m sure lots of people wish the death mechanics never changed, but you have to understand that they HAD to or else OSRS was destined to crash and burn as a game. You can’t retain a healthy and sustainable player base as a video game company if every time someone plays your game they have a chance of restarting from square one.
---
God you're dumb - ironmen can participate in those mini games just like any main would.  What he did for BH is just cheesing the system and not actually playing the minigame.
---
I’m fine with posts complaining about jamflex I’m just getting pissed at the posts that say “is anyone else having this issue?” When you could legit scroll for idk 10 seconds maybe and see other people are clearly having this issue, other than that though I’m right there with you we should be complaining every chance we get  about the shithole company that is jamflex
---
🦀 🦀 11$ 🦀 🦀
---
It's all concept art for what was announced at RuneFest. The new nightmare boss, and group ironman
---
Cool. Now they're ruined for me too.
---
The name of the game is you're mom... And let's just say I'm already playing it.
---
Xdxdxddxdddxx
---
Yea, you're right...but we can dream.
---
This happened to me too, just keep in mind that jad sucks more than you
---
Hey, I don't have a problem, you have a problem &gt;:(
---
O hey it me
---
Everyone is doomed to go in minus as a whole. It's finite (the generated) vs infinite bank (the ungenerated). It's also taxed. It will always go in minus in the long run (as a whole), always.
---
That said I sold 15b myself so I'm no saint.
---
It is a bad thing, the only subjective part is how bad.
---
Bond pouch should be accessible through the bottom left icon under the friends list on mobile
---
I'm currently on the gring to 99 myself,
---
Bloods are 38k/hour with 495k (560k with dairy) gp/hr
---
Souls are 48k/hour with 238k gp/hr
---
However, you'll spend 304.1 hours crafting bloods from 77-99
---
Or
---
240.8 hours crafting bloods to 90 and souls to 99
---
So you can save 99.3 hours crafting souls, but you'll loose 60-70m profit.
---
Honestly I would recommend crafting souls as you can easily make over 70m in 99.3 hours, plus souls give better chance of pet ;)
---
Hope this helps you on the grind.
---
Never had that issue since when I was growing up we only had the cool kid video games, like Lego Island for gba. One of the jobs or tasks was to do slider puzzles, and I got pretty decent at them, but my brother could do them in an instant. I'd always call him over or have him log into my account to do the puzzle for my clue scrolls since he was 3x faster than me
---
Really? I was logging out for nothing then... All that wasted exp
---
Sounds like Exp waste to me
---
^^^no ^^^but ^^^have ^^^a ^^^good ^^^time

Go to osrs website and click on play osrs select a server. Select a UK world and let the website open your osrs app.

It worked for me

Isn't nats/deaths through abyss better? (Post 91 rc)

---
You are arguing with one of the people that literally writes the drop rates for the wiki lol
---
he is correct
---
This is awesome
---
Ofcourse, clearly everyone wants to tax the players. We should maybe even have a system of welfare. Give the duel arena tax money to the bottom 30% of players so they can buy supplies
---
No. You're swapping gold from one version of Runescape to another. No real world trading tool place. 
---
However the risk of being scammed is pretty high if you don't use the trusted clans. I have no idea which swap clams are legit.
---
We’re in the motion of buying our first house in our early 20s and most of our friend circle have already bought or are also looking at buying.
---
Not sure why I’m being downvoted, it was an honest question
---
cons: more demand for gold farmers.
---
Seriously, stop with all the gold sinks. All it does is incentivieing more people to farm gold.
---
Natures at 91 RC are 24.3k/hour and 1.2m gp/hour
---
And
---
Death runes at 99 RC are 27k/hour and 1m gp/hour
---
LOL
---
Holy fuck I love this episode.
---
If you can't afford it, you can't afford it, and  having cable be worse is relevant because streaming is basically the evolution of cable and is also cheaper
---
Most I ever got was 2 in a row a few different times

So i assume this option is better
---
I play with myself
---
I just turned 23. Happy birthday soul brotha

You got him a free game for christmas?

If you're desperate buy a few bonds and sell them. It's how I made my first bit of cash and its only gotten better from there. Bought a few to get me going, now I'm waiting for some new expensive item to buy
---
You're more dense than a Dark Essence Block.
---
&gt;while others make 5b in one day
---
or lose 5b in one day because it's just as likely... I don't think anyone here is jealous of gambling addicts
---
Not your fault, best of luck man
---
For money yes, Natures are better. However, they are alot slower exp/hour and not as Afk as bloods/souls.
---
There are alot better money making methods in game, so if you are purely going for 99 Rc, either stick with zeah rc or go hard at lavas :)
---
Tough crowd
---
Guess so, yeah.
---
I think spinning flax is the "fastest" dedicated way, if you have nothing left from wintertodt or slayer and want fast levels.
---
I think the most efficient method is runecrafting, I was getting about 90k crafting xp/hr on 10x xp.
---
Thanks man ahah I only got 128k atm
---
Willow saplings cost like 2k each, and give 1500 XP or so. You can do a normal tree run every hour. Maple saplings are like 30k and not worth it unless you're loaded.
---
Fruit trees give more XP and are cheaper per XP, but you can only do them every day. Cheaper, easier, but give less XP per day.
---
Hardwood trees are even more AFK. Mahogany trees cost 15k for 3 saplings, but give 45k farming XP in about two minutes. You can only do these every three days.
---
Trees let you spend money on farming and are the fastest XP by an enormous margin. They're also kind of expensive.
---
I personally did willows and fruit trees to around 60 farming, then fruit trees and hardwoods to 72, now I'm just doing hardwoods.
---
Farming is extremely lucrative though. I average about 130k every run.
---
Bloods are 2 clicks with long render distance from dark altar where souls take atleast 5-6 clicks
---
I agree and am not projecting.
---
At all.
---
This is what I was gonna say
---
Basically, wait to buy until it releases imo, unless u need it now but it’s not that good for the price at this point without the upgrade
---
I dont get this.
---
Found the staking addict.
---
$11 🦀
---
I recommend saving money for a blowpipe and use ady darts. its crazier how much this weapon makes your clear time to jad.
---
this would be amazing, alot of the times when i get burnt out and take breaks from osrs i have to wait until my membership runs out before i take a break which is kind of annoying
---
Tapping “learn more” should give you a “I understand. Let me in anyway” kind of option I’m pretty sure
---
Take this to ironscape no one gives a fuck here. Seriously.
---
*Equip tin foil hat*
---
After the full public knowledge of server crash causes dupe glitch, people are now trying to crash the servers without having 2k~ accounts at the same location
---
gz!
---
Just play an era-accurate RSPS like 2006rebotted or Rune1
---
That cheesecake in the back looks delicious.
---
Are we in /r/ironscape? Oh that’s right
---
Ps it works when i manual select twisted league server 400
---
I’ve hypothesized that RS3 and OSRS have similar populations of real players, since RS3 has far better bot detection
---
Go back to RS3 you sicko
---
Because Jagex does shit like this:
---
Banned for X
---
Okay, go to support page.
---
"my account is banned for X"
---
&gt;Oh sorry you can't appeal this ban, we're very good at detecting x so go fuck off"
---
Alright... what if I was unfairly banned? Let me try to appeal another way, there has to be. I've seen others have some success.
---
Then you get to the appeal page, and sure enough! There is an option to appeal on there for X. 
---
Then when you use that drop down menu, you get a generic response "sorry can't appeal for X"
---
Then... why was it on there???
---
Futher - Jagex will send you in logic circles on other issues. So you really just need to plead with an audience to get them to listen. False streamer bans get reversed, stolen names have been returned, ETC ETC. People circlejerk because reddit and twitter really are the only "customer support" outside of billing issues, at least for serious alleged offences
---
Pausing membership sounds a lot more like it is the players choice, and pausing membership a few a month because you have plans or whatever isn’t really jagex’s problem- unfortunately that’s how subscriptions work.
---
HOWEVER,  customers should not be paying for the mistakes of the company and when you can’t access the service that you pay for because of their issues, the company should look to make things right. Not with some huge payout, but with a few extra days of membership to cover the time lost because of their issues.
---
If you are looking for an authentic OG RS experience, you won't find it unfortunately. There just isn't enough demand to provide for it.
---
However, playing an ironman account has helped my experience a lot. They are seen as such a torture, but if you look at the game as just that (a game). On top of that it forces you to slow your pace and not worry about what's BiS for everyone and focus on your own account
---
Except for the fact that cheat engine doesn’t work for most online games
---
Lol
---
How do you have two different untrimmed capes. When you buy the second one, you will have 2 99s and it will be trimmed.
---
&gt;Worked for me so works for thee
---
One thing i don't get is why people get mad about a rare but not valuable drops. Recieving one doesn't even affect the chances of recieving valuable one.
---
Im not asking for spanish support, not even translating the game or anything like that, thats meaningless for me, I (And I'm sure all the SA. players) just want to play with 20-60ms like most of you can :(
---
Just say you have some billing issues with the account PepeLaugh
---
Eek. How many drops of other uniques?
---
why don't you want to train hunter?
---
Range tanks are always good. Go hit pvp rn you'll stack on meds.
---
That would be fun, the new party room world would be the bh world though and would make it even worse for lag probably. PvP worlds would be fine though, and PvP balloon popping would be good fun.
---
I think he did it intentionally to sell the joke more.
---
Doesn't change my point, this isn't where come go to report players
---
If you mean smith as in metal, Id rather prefer them to be some form of plastic. The cape, of course, would be something similar to fabric. Im also not sure if I even have a smith in my area.
---
Fuck Fandom, its garbage
---
I only milk rhinos, thanks
---
Haven’t got a tbow? Pretty weak.
---
Lol i did this my first kill. I thought it didnt matter since I killed jad so i didnt heal up. I died like a few sec after jad so I was literally a fraction of a second away from completing the caves. Was so mad when i spawned outside with no cape lol. Then learned the cape isnt just for killing jad. That one was tough to swallow (giggidy). But hey bpipe made it quite easy even with my mediocre stats.
---
100% tax
---
Your execution of that pun was quite **polar**izing
---
Where are you getting that stat lol
---
Tbf he has 2 1/1k drops.
---
Nope, both are working fine for me. Don't think there's been any reports of any issues lately either. Maybe try turning off and back on again your laptop?
---
Thanks!! Finaly  after 2 days this worked for me!!
---
Works every time for me going to the 2k UK world
---
Because you have to pay 100k to get your items back when you wipe. Which tends to happen when you're learning. A lot.
---
I'm not saying 11 dollars is a lot of money, I'm just saying that it is a lot to ask for a 90 minute sitting experience!
---
I remember 12 year old me thinking name changes would be cool.  Boy was I wrong, theyre very annoying
---
I hope it's a joke.
---
Song?
---
"Fast and easy" uhhh..
---
I M A G I N E paying real money instead of buying bonds from gp you earn playing
---
bet my dad would kick ur dads ass
---
Weird, most of the people I know who play have multiple 99s or are maxed
---
Combat spells to
---
In fact every spell in the game should have a tablet
---
Deleting duel arena would only bring the game closer to having free trade/open wildy be removed again. Thats a hard no my guy.
---
Most people in Australia are on like $24+/h, some trades even like 60+ easily. three quarters a days work pays for a year of membership, bargain
---
Tax
---
Remove duel arena function, keep the structure but make it look like dragonkin destroyed it similar to edgeville in rs3. Add revenant duelers(level-126) to arena. Move dueling ring teleport, bank chest, and hp cape npc to directly next to fire rune altar. Problem solved.

Uncut onyx from MLM gem sack, that's like 1 in 100,000 or something, don't feel like checking the wiki. Then there's armadyl helm from elite clue npcs. Elite clues take an hour to get on average, and then you have to get a combat step. Finally the monster has a 1 in 1 million chance at dropping its helm.

Question: Which bear is best?
---
I didn’t understand this... but that’s because I didn’t read the tittle. Hehe
---
1/12,500,000 for possibility of those drops in any order, and 1/5,125,000 for 2 of any of those drops in a row
---
When you put it that way, yeah for 45m compared to cheaper options it might or might not give you a max hit unless you actually check the specific stats and weapon but that’s not what you said at first. You said it makes no difference over verac when that’s clearly false for most relevant stats and situations.
---
The rarest single drop I know is arma helm / bandos boots from the armadyl / bandos guardians (elite coordinate clues) at 1 / 1m. Idk what's a usual rate for lottery tickets though
---
Just no.
---
mod ash and others keep talking about server “interruptions” needing to be taken care of as the reason for all the lag, but does anyone know what kinds of interruptions are happening? is it external, internal, do they know what’s happening?? i’ve read the official statement on the issue and honestly it didn’t clarify much. i’m sure it’s just another issue that requires a certain level of discretion but i do wonder if and when we’ll find out what specifically the fuck is going on
---
Yes yes yes
---
But who would they have to reimburse? I have had literally zero problems in the past week, both with mobile and pc. 
---
And what about f2p players? How do they get reimbursed? Do we just give membership to all those bots?
---
Part of our $11 per month goes towards customer support too, but we won't be getting a refund for not having it either.

Want more proof? Durial321 was a member of the secret white knights service. This was just an excuse to imprison the true king of falador. I mean when was the last time you saw the king ?

Yup, been lagging for the past 2 days. All actions stop for 1-2 seconds then resumes, been happening quite more often lately. A lot of people have been having this issue it seems.

God damn barragers still got me having PTSD
---
I literally voted no because of That :)
---
Snitches get their britches filled with poodoo. Cause they're dead. Jagex doesn't care about these fuck heads. You'll learn that at some point. They go after the players who play their game legitimately and respect the rules. Because we are the suckers who will take it up the ass while their servers are down, or getting a macro major on an alt account and losing all progress that WASN'T being cheated on! I despise these cheaters, and nothing is done about them! I'd almost join their ranks and give Jagex the middle finger if I didn't have a job and family with little free time. How fucking funny is that? It's pathetic.

About 4000 times less likely than winning the powerball. 5 items would be a lot closer, at around 6 times less likely

These issues happened immediately after rendi released his video. I can assure you when they release a statement (probably in 3 years) it'll be about duping.
---
cwc maj, everybody.
---
None of the guards fell victim either, almost like civilians were targeted..
---
it's not bannable, yet people who are not voting and are actually streamers are getting banned for no reason whatsoever. Spoiler alert, they are not using the vanilla client but third-party clients. This is no coincidence. But sure, believe whatever you want to
---
No, a bug becomes a feature when devs say so, like with the case of prayer flicking.
---
oh I don't? That's funny. I've programmed applications in Java and I know it how incredibly difficult it is and how incredibly arbitrary it is. the fact that they can't even update the text size of the game for fear of it breaking the game completely is very telling of how shitty the game is. the game has tiny six point font because they just don't want to switch to C++, which is the much better client choice
---
Any money makers that will be extra profitable while the bots cant all get on because of the server issues? Trying to make the most of a bad situation. If I make a killing I'll donate some gp to people who've not been able to get on at all?
---
I realize you're speaking from experience, but it's because of your attitude and not your sense of style.

If you are praying my sound you have to activate prot range by default because the SMACK sound is too late to switch to range

Thats amazing, Couldnt imagine playing mobile online, what device are you using?
---
Wow, the new Assassin's Creed game looks amazing.
---
Nah listen you gotta do some math here
---
Most people can’t afford to spend 5,000+ hrs playing a video game
---
If you make $10 an hour and work 5,000hrs you earn a whopping $50,000!
---
$1,000 is well spent if you even have to pay that much 
---
If most adults who play this game make $30+ an hour and worked 5,000 hours They’d earn a minimum of $150,000!!
---
1k is literally less than 1% of their income 
---
SIMPLE MATH BABY

Of course an Osrs post can't be complete without Rs3 mention. This sub probably thinks more about Rs3 than actual Rs3 players. And I mean if you think Osrs is only strictly medieval than yikes...
---
No, it is not possible because every time it comes up they say 'we would rather make our own mini game, but better.' and then they never make their own mini game but better...
---
How about we re-design the shit hole and make it an actual PvP tournament with leagues and seasons. Having an elo based matching system and end of league position rewards

You should buy this guy bear :)

How many bonds are traded on ge daily?  thank!
---
My pro tip would be, use sounds. Default to protect from range, and switch to mage for a moment when you hear the mage attack. You can listen to his attack sounds on the wiki for easy reference
---
If you fall for scams you deserve to be scammed
---
Unpopular opinion, I know
---
What program are you using?

---
advertise that you are range staking, (usually on a account with a stats disadvantage to lure in people) trade them a maple shortbow and rune arrows, maple shortbow cant fire rune arrows, proceed to win stake

"Many congratulations on maxing king, the culmination of hours of grinding is the satisfaction of accomplishment. Great job, King"

It's a lot of information, so taking a few days to compile it all
---
Pro tip, alt+printscreen takes a picture of your current window. You can also use win + shift + s (also known as snipping tool but getting moved) to make specific crops. Or you could use programs like lightshot, gyazo, snaggit, etc.
---
All of these could be uploaded to discord, reddit, imgur, facebook, photobucket, etc. Hell you could even save them in ms paint.
---
All of these are free and faster options than taking out your phone, opening your camera, taking a pic from 20ft away, opening the reddit app, and then uploading to r/2007scape. They'll all look significantly better as a bonus.
---
Not for long.

Wish they gave u a free Bear pet 🐻

ye a lot to register

This has happened so often before. When the DDoSing was really bad around 2015, nobody got any compensation. Shitty customer support and shitty company policies. I quit for a couple of months out of protest back then, because it  became pretty unplayable for a while.

Agreed but there’s not really an incentive for Jigglyflux to do this.

Seriously, that's very nice.

Props to you man, I'm ~1900 total with near max combat minus pray and have almost best in slot everything for the ds2 boss fights. And I still died twice to vorkath in the quest, and I'm sure I'll die many more times before I complete the quest. All on pc btw, but I'll be damned if I'm not having fun failing lol.
---
We pay, we say, and I say FIX YOUR DAMN SERVERS
---
Wtf lmao
---
Thanks you. I figured out how to write an actually ticket rather than use the automated account recovery. Fingers crossed.
---
some of us are not so lucky to have a change in color be pretty noticeable.
---
Suicide bots. If they get banned they just make new accounts
---
I think he was asking why anyone would actually make party room bots, not why ironmen should be able to send their victim's items to the party room.
---
Finally something that explains the effort they've put into this government...
---
Petition to rename iron men “item sink bois”
---
&gt;The abusers of the glitch are crashing the servers in order to force Jamflex to upgrade their hardwares, in order to justify some of the 11$/month.
---
Wouldn't it be the server software that needs upgrading if they can crash the server itself by doing things? They could have the strongest server in the world but still have crashes if someone found a bug that crashes the server
---
That's not supply and demand, the demand for movies fluctuates but a movie, after bring put to film, has an infinite supply. The supply and demand curve stops functioning here because a movie can be supplied literally forever, just keep replaying the movie reel. 
---
The economic term you're looking for is socially necessary labor time. People expect to pay a certain amount for a movie in general because they understand that even though the supply of the movie is infinite, the effort put in to creating the movie is still real, and all those people need to get paid.
---
Bloods are really afk bro. Hit them up!
---
1for 1 is ok, nothing more
---
I’ve been seeing less green dragon bots, my guess is a big crack down
---
Yeah how dare paying customers be upset they don’t get what they’ve paid for?
---
If your landlord locked you out of the apartment you paid your monthly rent for, I’m sure you’d be upset. Same concept, different scale.
---
Imagine being this insecure. Not knowing the other person either will know what it is and be impressed or straight up not knowing and ignore it.
---
&gt;harassing

I don't think getting pked is the same thing as being harassed

wah wah free money

You already have 44 pray and 15 def.  this significantly levels you and puts you in an unnecessary bracket.

Your account is in some serious need of training
---
Yeah, I meant it more like bothering than abuse. It’s more of: there’s stuff in wildly I need to do, I’d rather not get pk’d today thanks
---
we gay we say
---
Yeah and we are paying the same amount as World of Warcraft costs for a game that's a tenth of the quality. It's pretty f****** crazy
---
You gave your money for something, didn't get it, and are ok with that?
---
It's one thing not to call up the place in blind-rage at the first person who answers, but to not do anything at all seems odd.
---
Didn't call them up asking what the issue was? Leave a review somewhere? Talk to the manager? Or did you really just do nothing?
---
Life must be so hard for you, not being able to play a game!? Call the cops too!
---
No, but I think you will not do anything
---
There was actually someone just spinning something in lumby castle w357 lol

Cool!

 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs) 
---
There's a calculator from the wiki which will tell you what herbs are the most profitable. A quick look tells me that you'll lose money on Marrentill farm runs, and won't start making any money at all until Harralanders at 26. The real money starts at 32 with Ranarrs and 38 with Toadflax. I'd definitely recommend getting at least 32 farming before starting your herb runs if money is the goal! 
---
Here's a list of quests that give farming xp
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quest\_experience\_rewards#\_Farming](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quest_experience_rewards#_Farming) 
---
I think you are spot on in your OP thinking that doing those is a good way to get going. Early levels of farming suck, I did the quests first when I was in your shoes too.
---
DIGGS! SIDELINE!
---
agility is shit 1-99
---
Bot farmers use cheap (0.20$) hacked/spoofed Amazon prime for membership so they wouldnt have to worry about that.
---
Lmao nice one
---
!isbot aqp-bot
---
Talked to Oziach recently?
---
It's not that hard to do so why wouldnt I do it lol
---
It’s working better for me yesterday now. Maybe they have some improvements
---
Close the app, open up osrs on website choose world and pick twisted league world then when osrs opens switch World to one u want to use
---
Edit: only works for me when I use twisted worlds
---
I recommend birdhouses. Takes a long time overall but you only need to do a bit every now and then
---
There are way better money making methods they would rather use.
---
just cranking the volume knob when music drops is the most annoying thing streamers do.
---
I am waiting
---
Sucks that people give ironmen shit when they get upset about being pked. But there is absolutely no incentive to pk as they gain nothing and only increase their chance of dying by fighting back.
---
Unless you sit in that world logged on an alt they get nothing
---
I dont know anything about these server things so can you explain me why cant they add more machines for a single world?
---
Yea and also we should 'just' create world peace
---
That doesn't answer my question but ok
---
Why? He didn’t mention Runecrafting
---
Hey, thank you for suggesting. I've downloaded it just now, but it has no "connect with Google" option or whatsoever. Any other advices?
---
Hey patrick, you know whats funnier than 24?
---
I wasnt defending them I just don't get the wanting to have your cake and eat it too analogy.  I mean I've heard it before but wouldn't you always want to eat your cake? I mean its YOUR cake lol
---
I second this, it's 2 clicks every 30 seconds and you only have to bank once an hour or so. By far the highest xp:effort ratio hunter method.
---
Very few people will quit over this issue. The monetary loss over no CS is negligible compared to the cost of implementing CS, so things are going to stay this way.
---
You weren't there
---
&gt;that I'd rather spend the bond money on gear or buyable skills?
---
Unluckily for you, that's not the only part of the game.
---
&gt;There's nothing wrong with paying real money
---
There isn't, it's your money after all. It just feels kinda pathetic and contradictory though, to care so much about a game that you'd regularly dump real money into it to skip content instead of just... playing it.
---
Now get 3,030,303 more xp
---
Nah, Ironman pking doesn't even make sense and this makes less sense.
---
They should, but they probably won't except if it happens for another week.
---
how do you have all that gear if u never done cox/tob lol
---
Re-open Camelots Party Room!
---
I get that jad can be tricky.
---
But if people did an ounce of research and have decent stats they really shouldn't be failing lol
---
They are.
---
It's a godsend for Ardy Knights.
---
Boss highscores were released, and with it (because Jagex was lazy and didn't look at the data well before its release) many extremely high killcount boss botters were banned. This includes Zulrah bots with over 50,000 kc and it is a boss that drops noted dragon bones. I believe there was also a Vorkath high kc bot banned as well as some others. 
---
It could also be that many high level players are using their alt accounts for twisted league rather than for things such as rune dragons or zulrah, which also slows the rate that dragon bones come into the game.
---
It's 3 days lad. And the game started off as a non mobile game anyway. People who only play phone games are either 13 year olds or 70+ year olds. 
---
Try playing on an actual computer my friend. Or go back to candy crush if you're this upset. Also if you dont have the $ to renew a bond I doubt you were gonna have it anyway lol. If you couldnt make it in 10 days what did the 3-4 cost you?
---
Some things in this game should just be what they are.. everything doesn’t need to be made “prettier”
---
TL
---
whats with the pink unicon armor? neva seen that noise before
---
They're not going to. I don't remember which NPCs reference them, but there are a few lines of dialogue where horses get mentioned, and the other character says something along the lines of "hornless unicorns? That's preposterous!"
---
The rewards are based on your level in mining, wc, fishing, herb, fsrming etc. So 50+ mining and you won't get limestone bricks, higher wc means more magic logs, and so on. Some people wait until they have 50s-70s in those stats to open for better rewards. I opened them early for the starting cash and seeds, personally.
---
Agreed, maybe make it scale with the amount of gp traded like the duel arena, idk. But I find it funny when people go "you should tax duel arena more, we need gold sinks" but then almost hyperventilate when you suggest a ge tax lol
---
Waaah
---
Yeah the "real thing" is definitely a big pull. These are the original creators and they deserve the fruit of their creation. OSRS has got the be the best thing that ever happened to them for that reason. 
---
I hope OSRS never dies but I'm scared it will because nothing lasts forever.
---
I mean there will be no tax and so no gold sink in the long run... Jokes aside, at least duel arena provides legit way to gamble, yes it's a huge problem because of rwt and so on, but if jagex would somehow remove duel arena - people would go on betting sites to gamble and that would be even worse. imo
---
I think we should be thankful that it doesn't have to truly be a solo boss as an ironman. Look at Corp for instance; they could've easily decided to go with that mentality as well
---
Diaries and easy total levels.
---
Maybe you shouldn't spend all your money on booze Mr "I can't cope boo hoo everyone feel bad for me online"
---
devalues my fire rune hoarding only ironman
---
A tax every time you go through a door. Also counts for your poh.
---
If you go to oldschool.runescape.com and go to the world chooser and choose a world in the UK, it should let you in. I still got the same unable to connect message, but let my phone sit for a couple minutes and it logged in. As long as you don’t force close the app, you shouldn’t need to do it again.
---
I don’t find it hilarious, I empathise since it must be frustrating. In my last job I was able to play on my phone to pass the time. If that had been taken from me I would’ve been really annoyed.
---
I’m with you. Everyone has been continually complaining about how they are upset with the way Jagex is handling the down time, yet the second somebody suggests a course of action you get laugh at. The fuck?
---
When it DOESNT work for you, does it say on the website “unsupported operating system?
---
Brew up before the wave starts (his max hit is 92)
---
With no computer I'm about to just cancel my shit for a while and forget about it with jagex not saying anything about it yet.
---
I heard they were updating in batches so check back later?
---
Great response. Good to know I’m dealing with high level intellect
---
Yeah, I realized that shortly after I posted
---
Imagine, Jagex breaking consumer laws by not providing and rendering services paid for and people being upset that consumer laws are being broken and you come be a dick to people who are upset about it.
---
drug dealers don't care if their clients over dose, die etc. they only want their money. jagex is the same!
---
BiS sledding gear anyway.
---
&gt; OSRS has got the be the best thing that ever happened to them for that reason.
---
Definitely! Who would've thought that listening to the community would work, haha.
---
&gt; I hope OSRS never dies but I'm scared it will because nothing lasts forever.
---
Same! Even though I don't play anymore these days, I 100% hope the game goes on to succeed and give others the joy it has given me in the past.
---
Good conversation, cheers :)
---
You probably don't know the difference between millennial and gen z.
---
I’ve been doing okay today
---
Been like this for a few days now I wouldn't get your hopes up too much
---
Lol god forbid someone gets corrected on their very wrong information.
---
It's more of an idiom and they just said it wrong. It's you cant have your cake and eat it too. As in you can eat your cake but then you wouldn't have it. They are two mutually exclusive options. You either keep the cake or you eat it. You can't have both.
---
Just a heads up; Irregardless is not a word.  Just regardless will do.  Common mistake
---
Good find, it's almost a meme in itself.
---
Life rough ain’t it?

Edit: magic fang
---
Imagine, me doing raids laughing at your shitty internet, no consumer laws have been breached, the game is up and running, your lack of connecting does not mean jagex is in the wrong. And if you think you can sue or whatever for server issues youre dilluted
---
Your best bet is probably going to be a UK world. All of the US servers have bad server lag.
---
I have seen a couple of them on Reddit posts and written in multiple ways.
---
Sure if it was referencing Australia but he was definitely talking about the US.
---
People downvote you, but you're just a younger me.
---
I don't think he said anything about the law? Unless it's a scam, yes customer service is mandatory. You can't have a customer base using currency without some type of customer service to take care of the issues associated with that. I have never heard of or seen a company that accepts currency ever without customer service. It's not really possible.
---
Sure? What’s your point?
---
Im confused if mods even regulate this sub at all. The fact they dont delete these exact fucking duplicates of posts every 2 mins is insane. Same goes for the shit mole memes or other flavor of the week memes that get reposted into oblivion.
---
It’s not the end of the world mate.
---
They are missionaries, they're not like the fat and lazy monks you find across the mainland churches. They have come to a foreign land and it's heretical practices, to show those savages what it means to be spiritual and cultural. If you think these CHADS can't light a fire, you've got another thing coming. They'll light that fire, they'll burn your savage hut and ignite a spark in your heart for theirs is the TRUE FAITH.  
---

Probably because he didn't train it??

I didn’t say it way, though
---
Mine does.
---
Jokes aside, imagine how refreshing it must be for a Falador Guard to see players killing each other rather than killing them.
---
I'm down in the stronghold slayer cave killing bloodvelds and it's excruciatingly laggy, even on low-ping worlds. No clue what's going on.
---
There's a huge downside for this, it gives ironmen a massive advantage over regular players.
---
If you try to pk a regular dude but die, they may or may not pick up your items, and if they do, it will usually just be your most expensive ones. The rest they leave on the ground for you to go back and get.
---
But if you pk an iron, you're guaranteed to lose everything you drop.
---
Ironmen can't ever have an advantage like that over regular accounts.
---
Ahh, so you have heard of the ole poophole loophole!
---
Yh tryna 3 tick mine. Literally shaking and crying rn.

Different orn kits for different colours, black red, blue, yellow/gold. Make them rare from elites so the rich buy them off the poor closing the economic gap between the poor and the rich.

I use mobile for casual afking while I work or watch bad tv with my girlfriend. I’m not trying to go through chrome and use my brain at all haha. I’m not calling for complaints to be sent or anything, but that work around doesn’t really mean anything to me.

Imagine trying to drive a car but half your engine is in the car next to you. That's why.
---
What's your password I'll check on my PC make sure it's not a client issue on your end.
---
They are not asking continued payment, if you are one of the people who is unable to log in just simply go and cancel your membership problem solved. You will probably not get a refund from any wasted days but like I said jagex should do this but they are in 0 ways obligated to do this.
---
Engine and web work = never going to happen.
---
You probably bought rs3 bonds you need to log into rs3 to swap them back iirc google the method
---
People are more inclined to post a negative experience than a positive one. That’s the truth. The people with positive experiences are busy playing the game, while people with negative experiences are more likely to post about it because they can’t play the game. Nothing about that is made up, it’s the same in literally every gaming community.
---
dragon sword but really just do MM?

Prople specifically make btw accounts to PK with to not gain levels from pvp.

Tbf most ironmen at wintertodt are yet to even start their accs. Starting a new acc wouldn’t be difficult with that little of progress
---
Now its all about neon colors, futuristic weapons and over sized models...
---
Could have sworn this was a GE price tracker graph of the Scythe last week
---
Rent in my country alone is like $50/day + for a 1 bedroom.
---
My heart honestly goes out to anyone that lives in a first world country and thinks $11 is a lot to pay for something they spend 10-20 hours+ playing per week. That's like 1 pint.
---
3 days is a lot of wasted time, xp, and gp 
---
No need to be a dick just cause I feel a certain way about this ongoing issue
---
I'm not even talking about jagex. I rarely get on this sub Reddit and have no idea what you are even talking about relating to jagex. I don't know what you mean about X  Also your company must be so small that you are the customer service....lol.  
---
Anyway I'm done I think you are a fucking idiot. People on Reddit have no common sense. How could you ever have a business without customer service? Do you even know what the definition of customer service is? I doubt you do. You literally can't run a business without customer service that I can think of. I have no idea what you would have to be "selling" to not have any.
---
Ok boomer
---
Haha fuck you
---
I haven't been on these two days. But a couple weeks on PC? No. I also use runelite and never mobile. So I can't speak for vanilla clients.
---
Also do you use runelite? Has the lookup feature been working for you or RuneScape website? Runecape website hasn't been loading for me so runelite can't use api from the hiscore website
---
More options for visual customization is never a bad thing. I really dont understand this anti-cosmetic mentality when all it does is give a bit of variation to the identical sea of BIS and/or graceful gear that you see everywhere.
---
Npcs actually have a set attack range, the reason you pray range if you cant see jad is because if its a mage attack you can hear it and pray in time, but the range attack only makes a sound when its too late to pray range
---
Try a twisted league profile to guarantee it to work, something with different user profiles and servers have made it them work 100%
---
Dad?
---
Kind of a waste of energy to LOATHE those people lmfao. I agree it’s annoying to complain that the game isn’t easy enough, but damn!
---
Literally takes seconds
---
The modern dick showing everyone that no matter what you say they will always be that one dick who thinks he's superior by repeating peoples words in a form that tried (fails) to talk down to them 
---
Have a good one mate cause I am on desktop Haha he ha Haha Haha ha ha
---
U wot m8. Entire worlds were going into lag. Did you not read the part where I mention that at that same exact time people in my cc were experiencing the same issue on multiple worlds and at multiple places. I just happened to be able to have died safely.
---
OP at level 5 you can also start doing birdhouses. It takes like 5 mins and you can do it once an hour. Watch a guide on youtube and use the best birdhouse you can. It is the best way to do early game hunter and saves you a lot of pain.
---
that comment didn't age very well
---
Gotcha well gl man wish I could give you more advice than to just open a ticket :/ sadly support just isn’t that great.
---
People often times get really, really confused about this. This was never a medieval game, not ever. We kill dragons and use magic, this always was and always will be a fantasy game.
---
Realistically in most first world countries $11 is an hour of minimum wage. If you have a bike you can ride it doing uber eats instead of playing rs.
---
I can understand the rice and beans life if you're a student, had a lot of debt, support a family on a low wage etc. But you have to at least acknowledge that it's not the norm for a first world country. 
---
$11 is not a huge price to pay for a great team making a great game.
---
Well no it's not really an advantage, rn if you pk an iron they cant pick shit up so there's no risk, so this would just put ironmen and mains on equal ground vs pkers.
---
No luck for me
---
MASSIVE downside that you cant loot back your 20k worth of food that they didnt bother picking up? Not like you can do the same with a looting bag on a main
---
Yes it’s the users error that our servers are down. - Jagex HQ
---
Welcome to the dumpster fire
---
Agreed but the shoulder looks clean
---
A think a lack of response to any of these posts is pretty telling, unfortunately.
---
Never played that game. How do they make money? Cosmetic MTX?
---
New episode tonight woot woot
---
Bh isnt considered a minigame for that rule which is why bh boosting is currently allowed
---
Jokes on you, jagex doesn't give a shit about your membership.
---
Is it a bad time to let you know you can safe spot every MM2 boss?
---
Lmao. At least you didn’t ask for reimbursement. I halfway approve this post
---
the guy is called kevin de bruyne hes a footballer. So you'd only understand it if you're into football. My sister is from the same city as the team this guy plays for and I guarantee shes never heard of him so its not really a location thing
---
If you’re not an expert how are you so sure?
---
Thought it was a nice accomplishmentl til I noticed ur in twisted league.
---
Complete Queen of Thieves for access to a shop in the sewer in Pisc.
---
Gl King
---
Before 2004 servers were in Gower's basement
---
If you do the queen of thieves quest, you get acces to a fishing shop
---
70 pray and piety.
---
Or farming.
---
That'll show em
---
Most likely op was buying them to try and sell to make money so no he did not get got by jagex he bough bonds exactly like everyone else. If no one was to buy bonds for this purpose there wouldn't be any ingame for people to redeem for membership so your whole rant also makes no sense.
---
Also it wasn't an account he never played on it is litterly the exact same account he is playing on. If he really was going to just redeem them for membership than this is the easiest possible solution because he can just do that on the rs3 version of the account and it will also be active on the osrs version.
---
3 versions of paying like this is actually a good thing.
---
1. Standard membership.
---
2. Premier. A current special end of year promotion (very common for subscription services)
---
3. Bonds a way to pay with in game wealth not all that common but a great alternative.
---
Tldr your whole rant is completely wrong
---
No thank you
---
but not a lot of people. its a very small percentage of people in pvp because theres no gain for them
---
Nice lvls. 
---
What gear do you have? (Weapons and armor)
---
When ik that ill be able to give some suggestions but as a general answer if you don’t reply to this, i would recommend investing into gear to help you do slayer. Getting slayer to higher lvls will bring in good cash over time and eventually when you have enough built up, you’ll be able to buy gear thats good enough for bossing which will bring in even faster money through slayer or in general if you do off task bossing.
---
Because for something this simple you dont have to be an expert. It is like when that guy tried to sue jagex in the us over second amendment rights over being muted. Didn't have to be an expert to tell you that case was never going to work.
---
thanks son
---
It's been days and no word at all when servers are going to be fixed. Wonder how long it's going to take.
---
Want
---
Your brain dead
---
Viggoras chainmace is a quest free dscim
---
It will cost about 10m for the bones required to get him from 60-70 prayer, which is what he was getting at
---
Make the party room only available to quest cape owners
---
Oh yeah true, brain fart LOL my dumbass was thinking you meant theres a scroll for piety which of course there isn’t. OOPS
---
I retract my dumbass above comment 😇
---
Just give every account in the game a dividened from the tax collected.
---
Filling bowls and things like that, or tanning hides, are better money makers for a bot than this would be and at also near 0 requirement.
---
Praise Satan!
---
I felt that gmaul part heavily
---
What worked for me is: go to the runescape site on mobile device (oldschool.runescape.com).
---
Select " manually select world"
---
Obviously select a world and the app will open and load.
---
If it doesnt load select a different world.
---
Hope this works for you too.
---
Its everyone and Jagex does not care.
---
Likes others said worlds are lagging massively.  Even if there’s no stutters the ticks are taking slightly longer and it adds up over time.  I’ve been at nmz this whole weekend and it’s been hurting the AFKability of everything
---
slayer rings if you're looking to hunt medium clues, herb sack if not.
---
This has not worked for me in 2 days
---
Won't cost 10m to from 60-70 costs 5.5m doing gilded alter less if you do chaos or ensouled heads
---
Yep.
---
Those were the days lol
---
There should also be something in the collection log which tracks all the items that irons remove from the game, so you can look at how much loot you destroy. Maybe if you hit 1 bil total you get a cosmetic cape or something.
---
I really hope they money you.
---
A million unique OSRS users a month? Where are you getting any of this? Also if there were "tens of thousands" of mobile only players, wouldn't the OSRS player count drop dramatically over the past week or so?
---
http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/?display=avg&amp;interval=day&amp;total=1
---
Birdhouses are 4k xp an hour.
---
it used to be 1k each
---
Nahhh
---
Probably 4k upvotes not enough :(
---
How do you get your interface to look better quality like that?
---
I tried, that shit doesnt work
---
Honestly your best bet is to use a non-US world. Those seem to be substantially better, even with the ping increase.
---
Jagex won't do that because that is something that helps to keep the economy running.
---
What about RS3? That shit is way too over the top. Who wants to walk around seeing wings, halos, horns, auras, and all other kinds of tacky shit? Start giving out tons of cosmetics in old school and that's exactly where we will end up. People like the look of old school as it is. 
---
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
---
That works if you're doing Partner slayer, after getting the task I tried to set that up but because the task was already on my 10hp account my main couldn't help out with it - I believe you have to have no task on both accounts to be able to do Partner slayer but I could be wrong.
---
Yeah, you can hop
---
Oh wow I guess it isnt just me. I am still getting lag, I looked it up cuz I started thinking it was me. I tried everything I found so far but it has to be the servers
---
it was during half time
---
It does work actually. You might want to try a lot of different worlds. When you find a world that works for you, note it down. :)
---
Interesting. I've never read the books. Are they still considered canon?
---
Havnt had any issues all weekend
---
Ya all Cosmetic MTX. I mean Runescape 3 could easily do this and let everyone play all the content.
---
It's the basement dwellers. They'll project all their silly shit on to you. Without the ability to anonymously act like they do they would still be nothing, but their minds wouldn't be able to take it. This is their "status quo" hahahaha!
---
Don't know if it's area related... But i've also not tested that out sooooo maybe? Anyway, hope you find a non-laggy world. Best of luck :)
---
Your first statement is just straight up wrong. Regardless of whether I agree or disagree on more cosmetics in this game, if that’s your premise, I’m out.
---
I'm in! thanks daddy!
---
Ewww no...
---
Fuck me this comment just made me realise how bad Botting actually is nowadays
---
Very high IQ meme
---
That is still sad, sorry.
---
Should qualify as disruptive behavior
---
Hello! Others also have the same problem, you might want to sort in "new" in /r/2007scape to see if others are having the same issue, a lot of people are talking about it :). Jagex is trying to fix the issue. They also made a post about it!
---
https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360004164078--06-12-OSRS-Mobile-Connection-Issues
---
However, they missed the part where some browsers don't open their app. I recommend downloading the Chrome browser then closing all your apps before doing the steps. It seems to work for all devices and it'll open up OSRS on the world you selected. They also missed the part where some worlds won't connect you to their servers and some others will. It's different for everyone so everyone is doing trial and error until they find a world. Happy Grinding!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e70n0c/how_to_actually_log_into_mobile/
---
I think it may be? I play on east coast US servers (i think anyway, lowest ping lols) and i just hopped on a UK world and its actually not lagging. My ping is 80-90 but it's not bad like dealing with that stop and go lag!
---
Edit - trying hydra again on the uk world. See if this is better! (I tried uk since for the mobile workaround you select uk so maybe some outside probs going on).
---
I feel bad for you if a single birdhouse run takes you an entire hour, but I guess on the bright side you can just do birdhouse runs all day since your first ones will be ready.
---
You're in multi-combat, deal with it?  If you can't, go elsewhere.
---
Money me.
---
Ugly af
---
Right at 99 too
---
There are situations where fighting back is your only chance at survival.
---
d claws if you're being super efficient for max xp but sgs is helpful at saving supplies
---
Billing support is pretty good. I remember my membership lapsing for a little bit during the summer event they had in 2012, emailed them about it and sure enough I got the full reward and death darts.
---
fuck you and fuck this post
---
Indirectly affects players by supporting rwt.
---
Secondly, highly immoral to have gambling in a kids game.
---
It's the principle of it, be it you missing out of 2 dollars or 200 dollars worth of "potential" content, that isn't acceptable, every other game company that have outages like this, think blizzard with wow, always compensates the players for their missed game time.
---
Because you are paying a monthly subscription to have access to playing the game, but are unable to due to jagex servers being down.
---
Hello,
---
You have to try different worlds until you find one that connects you to the servers :) Different worlds work for different people for reasons I cannot explain.
---
Mobile has been down for like a week. I’m also used to the latency
---
Choose another world then, can be f2p or another region, then can change world when you're at the logon screen
---
It just makes the bad xp/hr even worse though lol
---
Took me 82 raids to even see my first item. Also happened to be in my name. Friend of mine has about 77kc and hasn’t had anything in his name yet. It just happens
---
Use UK worlds
---
delete your account while you’re at it
---
Support, I can’t keep up with all the updates
---
How are you paying for it lol? You're paying for a set period of time for a subscription. It's unfortunate it's down for so long but you're not 'paying for it'.
---
I am bored of playing osrs, because I have completed all my goals and I want to try a new hobby. Is there anything I could switch over easily, but still do it alone. I have considered working out more but I can't stick to a routine, or I need a new method to help stick to it.
---
ah. in that case then yeah i’d go with slayer rings. unless you’re uim or something
---
You can semi safespot glough, the last stage is extremely hard to do esp on mobile
---
yes please, black and gold is always in style
---
What if someone doesn't own a desktop, or doesn't own a phone? What if they bought membership with the knowledge that they are able to play on the platform they have?
---
It's like if you bought an xbox game and the game told you "lol sorry, try on playstation instead."
---
What are the goals from farming though? Like I see the exp gain, but why do I want high farming?
---
Ugh, can you bring cash stack out again? I would like a try
---
This is photoshopped how did get log in??
---
Never before have I needed something so badly and never known until I received it.
---
Browser doesn't work anymore for me
---
it's something to do with the fixes theyre trying to implement to prevent people from 1. crashing the servers to dupe money and 2. duplication of items when servers get rolled back. we dont know which issue is causing all the lag but i'd assume they started working on fixing 1 before fixing 2.
---
Private servers take the entire point of the game away but I guess
---
Show it to Sherlock you Neanderthal
---
Two different opinions in the replies
---
Oof.
---
And server lag doesn't?
---
Is this from the game Steven Adams quarter back passed the ball to schroder for OT?
---
Using 5x5 stronglift app helped me maintain a routine when I was starting out
---
LOL the dude "Rabble Rabble Rabble" at the top.
---
For the value it would provide if you couldn't access a hosted POH on 330 it's actually pretty decent now, it's still a skill that will take some gold from you but I think you can get 99 on ~100m now whereas it cost that much to get to 75 back then for me roughly
---
Well looking at the peak instead of average there's a much bigger drop, didn't see that option before. I'm more arguing against the fact that he thinks there are tens of thousands of mobile only users. A year after mobile has been released, the population has gone back to normal and it's likely people who play on both who play on mobile, minus the clear minority of mobile only players. Some people prob replaced their method of playing on certain days since mobile release as well, there's also a lot of semesters ending right now with academics and finals coming.
---
It's hilarious when you have the ammy, bank, get your gear on and have ammy in inventory talk to the bank again and they're like *??????????????*
---
How does the last one have the patch already installed? Or she is playing on a beta server?
---
How about a scroll which drops and shows what the player would've dropped. Maybe make it showcaseable in the PoH too
---
The only way I'd play it, is if they released a game version with same-ish content, but tweaked and rebalanced numbers. Really irks me how many items and training methods are considered dead content, but jagex doesn't dare (and community wouldn't vote for) change it in current game just because it "devalues those who already have gone through the grind".
---
Where does it say “flawless”. It says they can accurately detect botting software. And they absolutely can; a very large percentage of their bans are legitimate. 
---
You can appeal everything but macro major. And macro major is a ban for full on botting, like leaving your bot on for 24 hours kind of shit. 
---
The circumstances for your ban are so sketchy. No person playing normally gets banned that fast. You were using a banned third party client or a questionable client and got rekt. There is absolutely NOTHING you could have been doing that could’ve resulted in a false positive that early in the game. You shouldn’t have left your bot on all night dude. 
---
The amount of bans that are false positives are in the tens, not the thousands. Mods have made this clear. They also review and clear bans for people who were banned falsely, and it’s not just streamers. You are also welcome to appeal on Twitter or reddit. 
---
Their message explaining why you are banned is hardly evidence their system is flawless. They have NEVER said it was flawless and have even admitted to false positives. But their system is mostly accurate. You thinking all those people who post on reddit claiming they were falsely banned just like you were genuine is hilarious. And no, using one case of a steamer being falsely banned is not valid evidence to have your deserved ban overturned.
---
Loooooool thank you I didn’t realize that
---
Honestly I far prefer ZMI. At least that's AFK for as long as the run takes. Sometimes you can mine one essence from the block, othertimes you can do an inventory. It's about as AFK as the lower levels of Motherlode Mine.
---
A phone that runs OSRS costs more than a laptop that could run it. 
---
There's no way someone with a phone capable of running osrs doesn't own even a cheap laptop/computer.
---
Like I said though, complaining about this shit is worthless, Jagex won't compensate for it. If people are unhappy they should cancel their membership, it's not difficult.
---
Not for me
---
Take it to Sherlock
---
No, log in screen
---
I'd support this one
---
a mood
---
What skilling discord?
---
Working out is a discipline, you need real motivation to get started. If you don't have mich stamina or strength then it will be tough at first and get easier as you ger stronger. When I started (several times as I have gotten out of shape and back into it at different levels), It always helped to remember "everyone starts somewhere".
---
At least it worked for me. A good friend told me that when training me in high school. I was over weight for the majority of my life and I really wanted stamina back then.
---
I hope that helps.
---
Nvm it stopped agian
---
I absolutely LOVE the opaque look of this. It goes so well with the Sang too. Not sure how I feel about the tome/new BiS mage shield in general but if it were to be added to the game in any form, this is surely the best way.
---
Jagex should develop runescape classic and the original backup of osrs in to stand alone single player games you can purchase on steam for like 10-20$. Could support player servers kinda like how minecraft has and modding. 
---
People already make private servers, why not pocket that market?
---
Don't tell me this was during the T Wolves halftime and you missed Snap Boogie! 
---
Thunder Up
---
Yeah, i get this bug a lot too. I usually get it when i type in the chatbox, or to input a number for withdrawing an amount of something from the bank. 
---
The easiest way to fix it for me is to minimize the game and immediately return to it, by pressing the button that pulls up all your running apps.
---
This is a rather simple issue in comparison to not being  able to play on mobile, though it would be nice if it got fixed too.
---
Lol I know right. Friggen noobs. It stands for Quest Point, right guys?? ....r-right??
---
Question: after using the workaround (booting app from browser by choosing world on the site) I found a German server that would let me play the app, but when I logged in, it was the start of the tutorial and my account was level 1. Is my character gone?
---
Oh, yeah that’s not nearly as much as I thought it would be, that doesn’t seem bad at all considering everything you get out of it.
---
&gt; membership is twice as expensive
---
Inflation
---
If you’re looking for efficiency, don’t unlock either.
---
You’re smokin’ that good good
---
Never mind I’m just a noob. Thanks for the responses tho. My Neanderthal brain probably wouldn’t have figured it out otherwise.
---
&gt;EU customers are entitled to a reasonable expectation of what they paid for
---
You are paying for a membership account for the game Oldschool Runescape. You are not paying to be able to play said game on a mobile device. You are receiving exactly the product you are paying for. The Terms of Service do not state "paying for Membership guarantees the ability to play the game on a mobile device".
---
You \*can\* play the game. You are not wasting your money due to an inability to access the game. You choose to limit yourself to playing only on a phone. You are receiving the product you are paying for.
---
You realize that Medieval Fantasy is a subgenre, right? The knights of the round table are even in the game.
---
Sure, then Jagex needs to add an option that let's us disable other players cosmetics.
---
35k/h is 30 hours from 98-99. Does that sound reasonable to you?
---
Lmao ok
---
i know i am
---
SOLVED: Had a friend help me with Venoming and getting the last hit on my alt with melee splashes.
---
They should, they won't though.
---
It’s AFK. Watch a movie or something
---
And yet players like sparc have 100b banks.
---
The richest players in game are stakers.
---
If you don't like it, don't renew your membership. It's that simple. If you're upset about this and want your money back, but still pay for another month at the end of your membership cycle, you're telling them you're okay with them taking your money for a sub-par service and not even delivering what they promised. 
---
If you want a refund, put in a ticket telling them you'll unsubscribe if you don't get it. Then cancel your sub. And don't renew it. 
---
Otherwise you're part of the problem.
---
Maybe if the trim was black or something, gold looks wack imo
---
Hello! Others also have the same problem, you might want to sort in "new" in /r/2007scape to see if others are having the same issue, a lot of people are talking about it :). Jagex also posted something that is pinned to the front page of this subreddit and they are trying to fix the issue.
---
if they make a newspost on the website its searchable and permanent
---
Thanks, I'll delete this now
---
Mobile works fine if you visit this link in safari/chrome/internet explorer. (Those are all that I have tried) just select a low-population world and once the app loads you can go into whatever world you want. https://oldschool.runescape.com/slu
---
Dunno why you're being downvoted, I assumed you were mocking him lmao
---
Seems like he wasn't invited.
---
How about explaining what you've tried instead?
---
I see your screenshot is showing the browser so you're on the right path. Good.
---
What phone are you using and what browser is this?
---
Removing wildy doesn't have to come with removing free trade though. Free trade wouldn't pass 100%, but PVP? I can see 60+ easy.
---
In this situation how is customer support meant to help lol? Pick your battles
---
So it sounds like old school gang fear, if we don’t get in there way and learn to live with them then we won’t have to worry about them burning the town down.   The literal game and it’s playability is getting fucked up, jagex is paying for servers that is mostly filled with bots, and bots don’t have to spend real money for membership they just work for bonds and sell the bonds only the few cmb bots need to pay for membership.
---
I agree I thinking mining is the worst skill.  RC is close but I’ve not tried some methods like ZMI and bloods.
---
Go to the website
---
Does it work on UIM? I've been using tears of guthix on mining for over a year, lol.
---
Everyone says the workaround does not work. They try 1 world get the error then say doesn't work and give up...keep trying servers until you connect. Stop being lazy and bitching about it. If you can't handle a few extra steps go play on pc or quit playing.
---
Samsung S10
---
anytime bud. :)
---
Yes
---
...and the browser?
---
Edit: Look, i'm on my samsung S9 and using the default browser and it still works. People are also downloading the Chrome browser in order to make it work and that ALSO works. if you're on mozilla you're shooting yourrself in the foot.
---
Logging in on a PC isn’t working either
---
This deserves so much more recognition. Excellent work!
---
If all you guys and gals can’t handle a little disappointment that literally costs you 37 cents a day then “real life”  is gonna kick you in the ass.
---
Finish 10k total Shaman kills and then team raids, I assume.
---
For some reason I read that as 90-99 and I was going to say actually that does sound reasonable.  30 hrs for 98-99 is insane
---
You obviously were not around when forced random events were part of the game, so you don’t know what it was like. 
---
They were aids
---
Jagex does the best it currently can with the “bots”
---
The problem is that the vast majority now aren’t actually bots, just people playing from very low socioeconomic areas of the world to sell it to earn a living.
---
My friend this is my 5th cycle doing it  - same exact scanario every time. As long as you're having a good time, that's all that matters baby.
---
Lol thats not what i said but ok mr touchy
---
Use Chrome mate
---
get an Iphone lol
---
Anyone who says kids no longer play this game can refer to this post as evidence against that statement.
---
King Drack Blagon?
---
Desktop was fucked for me too
---
Considering the fact that an RDT hit rolls 2 items, the drop rate is overall approximately 1/41395
---
Took me more attempts than the inferno
---
the coveted tebow everyone keeps talking about
---
What will you do in 2025?
---
No one is to blame but you
---
That pops up and redirects you to the osrs mobile app, you hit okay and then play. Or retry another world
---
I think that this is fake
---
I believe weakness is slash so
---
 str probably
---
Nah just add it to the highscores and then everyone will play it.
---
I was able to use the work around the last couple days but now not even that is working. How is this still a problem?
---
Its cause the lag is not consistent sometimes you move instantly other times it seems you move a tick later. Has made raiding the past couple of days annoying and today and yesterday basically not doable. Hell ive died more today at vorkath then i have for a long time.
---
Because he jacks it to Rachel Weisz
---
Show me the way

Make sure when you're trying new worlds you try different actual regions(Germany, uk, aus, etc) you can tell they're different by the flag.
---
The only ones that you can't tell the difference by flag is east and west coast usa
---
To add to this, OP should probably clear the app data out of the cache by opening a bunch of other apps to overwrite it. If he just closes the app it may be saved in the phone’s cache so it can be reopened easily
---
Thanks. Will update on my next posts raising awareness of this conspiracy
---
I’m aware of this work around, but I’m sure the more casual players are not. And because of this, they aren’t playing at all and might even cancel their memberships
---
Try different world dude
---
Trust me it'll work eventually, but you gotta try different actual servers
---
Then once you find a world that works  book mark the redirect page. Then all you gotta do it tab your bookmark Everytime you wanna load the game (I actually put it as a link on my homescreen)
---
Dont mess with the black market.
---
I’m in a PvM clan, I’ve had several members quit because they couldn’t control themselves. It would be great if that wouldn’t be such an accessible option
---
Yeah

I had to make myself get off cause I almost planked 3x in a row and I rarely ever die to her lmao
---
Go for 500m thieving xp. Yes, 500m
---
Jk
---
I staked once, I hadn’t touched the game in about a month, and when I got back I had no motivation and was on the brink of unsubbing. So I chucked my 512m bank, if I lost, so be it - I’m quitting anyway. But I won, and suddenly had all the motivation to play again.
---
I obviously don’t recommend doing this because it’s definitely stupid. I can only see it being a decent option in similar cases to mine - but that’s if you have the self-discipline to never go back if you win *or* lose. Or if you enjoy rebuilding, some people love it - it keeps the game fresh.
---
Did it drop again? It crashed months ago to like 600m and I haven’t played the main game since then
---
Right? Like holy shit, do people just think a wire is lose and all they have to do is plug it back in?
---
Yeah everyone is ignoring the fact that pc still works. Just because the way you’re opting to get in isn’t working doesn’t mean you have been denied access to something you’ve paid for, and I say that as mainly mobile
---
This is a JMod on a alt account posting this to distract us from the truth. Wake up people
---
what are you saying exactly? is gold farming a crime?
---
First off, every cape boosts the skill they're from by 1.  For 99% of circumstances though, it means absolutely fuckall.
---
Second, I don't remember where I read it, but above 99 skill levels outside of combat do nothing *outside of skilling guilds*. So your +1 extra would, in theory, work in the mining guild.  The same goes for the wc/fishing guilds. This is due to the invisible skill boosts sending you above 100 anyway. This is why chopping yews in the wc guild is still faster than other places even at 99 wc.
---
I'll see if I can track down a source for this, but no promises. **EDIT:**  [Found it.](https://twitter.com/jagexash/status/884329975322734593)
---
I'd say so; that he is wrong. Part of the point for BIS items is that they take long hours to acquire and even longer to do it by yourself. This feels like if a tent whip was suddenly given a better DPS than a scythe by attaching a new drop to it. Not a perfect analogy, but enough to convey the point without unnecessarily splitting hairs over it. I.e something very valuable and that takes a lot of hours to acquire, now virtually becomes dead content. On some level the tome is a better fit than throwing it on the arcane, but I'm starting to dislike the short hours for BIS upgrades that have become commonplace lately.
---
Yeah when you sell it for money 🤣
---
Where do you think gold websites get their gold to sell?
---
And I hear this, but my point is that the app should work, lmfao.
---
The biggest beneficiaries in the GE-less OSRS were merching bots and manipulators as was very very apparent, and why people pushed for GE hard.
---
The technology, world and general mindset of people has changed drastically between original 2007 and nowadays. The magical trading experience of 2007 is gone forever. I too have fond/nostalgia memories of that time, but nostalgia is a hell of a drug, and we shouldn't dwell too hard on it, and let it cloud our judgement where we would vote no to otherwise great ideas.
---
It’s out of control!
---
Sorry, I'll quickly run through every comment and add citations. Just for you.

I’d rather that than the hand cannon 
---
Well.. maybe not the blowpipe :)
---
no idea, but from what you delivered you just found spanish speaking players
---
Where is Mac’s? I’ve been searching and can’t find it.
---
The Terms on their support page would not qualify me for a refund, as I have used a portion of my membership, I am asking what their refund policy will be during these outages and how I can get one. Keep your shitty attitude to yourself please.
---
Depends what your goals are and what you're doing in-game now. Technically, 75 str should be next for efficiency. You'll be able to get Def to 70 quicker than if you were still at 70 str. But I think I got def to 70 because it was arbitrarily nice having the same, rounded 70 on my combat skills.

I would love a Winter PoH theme~

This was a joke I'm almost finished  a cs major. I really shoudlve left a /s on there huh

How often do you run into massive amount of Spanish speaking players on Osrs ?
---
Damn... Imagine that with golden godsword attack
---
How is this osrs related?
---
[It does work in guilds, though.](https://twitter.com/jagexash/status/884329975322734593)
---
Tbh I think that’s really all there is. I think getting rid of bots would be similar to calling an exterminator for the roaches in a dumpster sure you could kill them all right now but they’ll be back eventually.
---
L O L

You will **not** get anything for this; you must be really new if you think Jagex gives even the tiniest fuck.

Ouch.

idk if we talk ddos, I'd put my money on "crash server for the d upe" (since afaik it's not fixed at root; and only ability to ddos in-game was patched). Although it might be actually the same gold sites doing  it
---
I’ll never know because I did lavas to 99
---
The number of quest guides that would need to be updated...
---
I said this before but personally, I love the colors and would wear something like this  mountain biking or skating. I haven’t played rs since 2014  but that  Bluemoon Inn shirt they did last year (Or the year before) was great  because it looks like a normal crew neck and only my nerdy buds know  what’s up. It was my favorite gift I got that year.
---
If you dropped the logos or made them optional I would be interested.
---
Starting this off with I agree with you, this is pretty unacceptable.
---
However  when you sign up for membership, the long thing of text you just accept has a clause that says the service isn't going to be up 24/7 365. There's an expected amount of down time per year in their terms. Not a single service you sign up for doesn't have some type of discrepancy like that.
---
Even if it's in their terms, they should still be making customers happy. We shouldn't have to sit here and basically force their hand
---
Yeah, the app is having issues. Make sure your app is closed, go to the main site on the chrome app, select "manually select world", select a world, then it should auto launch the app. You can then change worlds before logging in.
---
Should be destroyed then, everyone's always complaining about item sinks, plus he could always go to party room, it's usually empty
---
I love making goals and then working hard to attain them. Gratz!
---
Yeah the entire way they went about implementing and then repolling designs for that armor set was a shitshow from top to bottom. At least its so ugly that I've yet to see a single person wearing it.
---
early February.  Last year I believe Feb 3rd was the last day you could purchase Premier.
---
Yeah I remember doing it with a crystal bow on 20 defense pure about 6 months after fight caves release when there were still no video guides and only shitty forum guides and it still only took 3 tries to get.  With a blowpipe and guides that will take you through literally any scenario on every type of account, it’s cake.
---
This is the armor General Graardor wears. He doesn’t wear a pretty black and gold trimmed chest plate. Some things don’t need to be pretty and colorful is all I’m getting at
---
Iunno man, tribal totem is pretty hard to remember.
---
Lol on the same level as in Osrs? Last I knew nobody was crashing Rs3 servers with bots to duplicate gp.
---
some fat losers froth on the wilderness statistics unfortunately its not in the highscores because jagex has a serious case of the downs.
---
Wow finally they fixed this. They fixed it so long ago in rs3 that I kept messing up when using it in osrs (leaving before refilling)
---
Okay, how about this???  Make the Duel Arena what it's meant for.  DUELING.  Slapping each other naked with Whips isn't dueling.  It's just a 50/50 gamble.  Remove the aspects of customization that allow for the set up of a 50/50 whip slapping contest.  If people want to stake 500 million GP on a fight they should be allowed to.  But with armor, food, special attacks, Veng or Ancients, etc all enabled.  If people want to stake fortunes it should be forced to be a more skill based set up.
---
It's such an obvious solution that it actually makes me think the only reason Jagex hasn't implemented it yet is because they are secretly in the pockets of RWT sites or something, but I know that's ludicrous.
---
It's still not working
---
Haha looks like you've never been to revs. Zulcano is the new revs and that's old news
---
I don't understand how this isn't everywhere. the lag is awlful not allowing you to do anything risky and you can't even play mobile.
---
I thought that prayer only helped for cmb stats thanks for the tip man!
---
I've been disconnected from multiple worlds this past week as well. Not sure what's going on
---
Which one? I can try to make it if people would be interested in it

Tried mobile for.first time this week last night after seeing all the posts. Within 30 seconds was into the app by just trying around 5 different Aus world's (am an aus player). And then when the app loaded swapping to my desired world and logging in.
---
no

Base game on PC is lagging bad too

This happened to me, u gotta click the "trouble loading?" Message first, then hit yes.

Gonna be hard to sell those bonds on the GE if we can’t log in.

Very cool story Mr “Knew about Rick and Morty before anyone else” Hipster
---
Okay I’m not doubting you, but why are they an “extremely horrible company” and what “horrible business practices” are we talking about?  I think of companies like Nestle and BP when I hear terms like this.  Not game companies that sometimes have shitty moments.
---
And if you really feel that way, why the fuck support them and play their game?  Just cancel your membership and don’t look back.  I swear people get so upset but they refuse to do the only thing that would make a difference because they’re so addicted.
---
Dude in brimhaven had his totem stolen by a rich white family and he asks you to get it back. You use some fancy short distance teleport to break in and pick some locks/avoid traps to get the totem and get out. You'll just have to trust I didn't google that lol.
---
Edit: love your sad downvote because you can’t respond with an actual argument lmao, you lost and you won’t get money back
---
&gt;It doesn't matter if it's a big problem for them
---
Yes it does lol.. if the problem is out of their control and they can't fix it fast or just can't throw money at it, they're not going to be liable.
---
&gt;	they got my money for a service that is no longer being provided and has been down for a WEEK.
---
And services go down? That's 100% expected when buying a subscription for an online service.
---
&gt;If you bought a monthly subscription for a hair salon that said you can come in at any time, but they suddenly closed all their stores in your town for a week, that'd be grounds to get a refund at the very least.
---
I mean this is just a bad analogy overall but depending on the terms of service you agreed to, no it's not. Depending on the reasons for closing or shutting down, they might not be liable either. Unexpected outages don't just mean you get a refund for anything. Also the service isn't 'down' and 'no longer being provided', it's accessible in other methods and proven accessible with workarounds. 
---
Why not just submit the complaint and see what happens instead of this BS you keep throwing around? None of us are lawyers but you seem to think you can just get your money back for anything. I guarantee they're covered in a situation like this, if they weren't, why haven't they refunded people for days lost in the past couple of years for servers being completely down?
---
Lmao, you even agreed to basically this in their ToS, I guarantee they're covered by it now.

It’s not mine or anyone else’s internet. This is a Jagex issue not an isp

Wow you’re really angry that someone voiced their opinion that jagex should get their servers back online for their paying customers. Take a step back and try to realize how stupid you sound. I won’t hold my breath.

I like how day 1 had effort, day 2 less sow, day 3 is a line. I really want to see what day 4 brings

Runecrafting recognizes 104 RC to get 5x earth runes, though.

He's talking about Mac's famous mac and cheese. It's an old family recipe, so you're not gonna find it at Walmart or something.
---
It's how the spottiness is manifesting that I found worth making a thread about. Judging from other comments it seems like this type of lag is specific to instances (maybe just hydra instances? doubt it though). Which might suggest some interesting things about the nature of instances compared to the servers.

People still pay for membership? XD XD XD

You are the negative one here man.  You even said yourself you don’t qualify for a refund, there’s a reason they put those clauses in.  Go ahead and charge it back, nobody is stopping you.

I wasn't aware of that since I haven't had that happen to me before now. All I've seen (and continue to see) is people complaining about lag in a general sense, complaining about it killing them, etc. So of course I'm going to assume they're experiencing the normal type of lag.

according to the wiki you don't

yeah, at least take me out to dinner first

There's literally a sticky post.

Yeah definitely! I did My arms big adventure without a guide recently and honestly that quest in general is pretty damn funny, other than that I can't see myself ever doing quests like Desert Treasure or MM2 without a quest guide

My HCIM account (12hp) was whittled down to 1hp at wintertodt (could only watch as I slowly died) when I’ve lost connection and got kicked. Thankfully I spam clicked my food and came back still barely alive. I’m done playing until it’s resolved

The post talks about server issues *causing* issues with clients loading. And provides a temporary work around.

They address the issue and talk about the immediate effect that's stopping some from even playing. They're aware.

People don't think this way; they think about this week, this month, or this quarter. If people thought ahead about shit, we wouldn't have even half the problems we have today.

Ffs... 😂

What changed to make abyss rates higher?

Don't think this was ever a plugin. You can use a larger item though, like if you drop a staff on top of a pile of runes, you can right click the staff to pick up the runes.
---
That style is vomited all over the blood and soul rune altar and it saddens me
---
Its one of my favorites for sure
---
lol at your first sentence
---
&gt; I understand it's not an easy job, but don't you think it's been like this long enough for Jagex to find a way to minimize this problem?
---
TBH, that is really hard to say. Perhaps they have been cutting corners and taking the easy option that leads to more issues later; perhaps they have been doing a reasonable job and new issues keep being a problem. If this was caused by the dupe bug fix, I'd say that is kinda understandable since it is a pretty different area to previous issues and I think most would agree it is better to fix a dupe and deal with server issues than for them to have held off on a dupe fix for weeks to try to iron out some issues first; especially when they likely can't test the fix on a proper scale.
---
We also have gotten some snippets over the years on what they've done and what the problems were, but they easily get buried and likely don't shed as much light as you'd want to begin with. It doesn't help that the OSRS Team likely doesn't know much more than we do since the details are probably beyond most of their expertise, at least for CMs who'd be the ones telling us. So you'd really need one of the people fixing it to comment on what is going on, but even then a response that makes sense to the majority of the community can easily come off vague or lack full details since the full details can be confusing without knowledge of how it works. And the more time they have to devote to explaining this stuff, the less time they'd be working on that "engine work" that as a sky-high list by now.
---
Anyway, as I said at the start it is hard to say. As players, we only see the impact it has on us and we likely will never know all the details on exactly what is going on or what is being done to fix it. I also don't mean for my posts to come off like we shouldn't be at all critical of Jagex and that they are 100% doing the best they can; chances are even if they are doing a reasonable job they could be doing more, as is the case for all things, and while you can come up with reasons for why they might have so many issues, we don't know if they hold up.
---
But to go back to the original question, it might help to consider it in a different context. If your car had a problem, your mechanic fixed it, then later it had another problem and the same mechanic fixed it, and then a few months later something else goes wrong with the car, would you complain that the mechanic should have stopped it from breaking by now? I mean it is possible you just have a bad mechanic and it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to see what another place thinks, but it could just be that your car keeps having problems unrelated to the previous times in the shop. Unfortunately with OSRS, we can't just take the game to another company to see if they could fix it better and a vehicle has worn over time is not the same as code and servers (issues from changing code is probably more comparable to something like mutation in cell division, but I digress).
---
Yeah my HCIM was there but then it froze and logged me out so I quickly got back in and decided to go fishing instead something nice and safe haha
---
Wouldn't need one if the servers were good smh
---
Yea, it was a poor attempt at a joke. There's a relic in twisted leagues that grants all your attack styles to be 1 tick faster (0.6 seconds). But we've been having server issues so I made a fake relic that makes your attack styles slower and everything is laggier.
---
I never suggested it was a small fix. Just that other services are rarely down for more than a few days for big or small issues
---
Mtx and gambling are 2 different things... you dont need duel arena to mtx
---
I'm just glad I'm not the only one TBH
---
I'm not being negative just telling you facts sir negativity. 
---
And great, you are a mobile player. Like I said mobile isnt down for a lot of people, so workaround it if it doesnt work. If you took 3 seconds and actually looked you could find that.
---
And like I said it doesnt matter if you are mobile only. The game still is up, people are still playing. No refunds are going to be given if there is another option. 
---
Stop whining and blaming your issues on others.

Try a UK twisted league server to load the game and then just switch to a normal world.

Either way I dont really care how you define them. I don’t want either of them in the game.

I’m trynna sneak around but I’m dummy thicc and the clap from my ass cheeks keeps alerting the ogre bois

Crazy
---
You're completely missing the point dude. This game shouldn't need more powerful hardware. The entire point is that this game is more or less unchanged from how it was 15 years ago, so shouldn't require more powerful hardware. And even if it did, Jagex can afford it now more than ever due to lower hosting costs.
---
It's not that powerful hardware isn't available, idk why you keep repeating this stuff about single core performance as though this game is some sort of super resource intensive data mining application or something. It shouldn't need tremendous single core performance.

The wilderness is the wilderness. It’s purpose is to be an abandoned and scarce environment roamed by monsters and not people and towns. Why would u think it is a good idea to add an arena to the wildly. It literally removes the fundamental aspect of the wilderness

Now you have blown their cover.

No worries. I believe a lot of people have misunderstood so far. Lol It would all depend. I was thinking two weeks to a month for this example. The benefits would not enter the game until the donation period ends, so there wouldn't be any removal. However, there's a lot of people who are a lot smarter than I, so as to how it would actually be implemented would probably be different.

Yeah i can see what you mean.. but when i see stuff like this all i can think about is the huge amounts of “custom” items that RSPS’s used to offer.

Achievement diaries and quests are great ways to explore new areas and really dig in to everything the game has to offer while also being quite rewarding! If you have near 70s in most stats you’ll be able to do a lot of the easy-medium tier diary tasks and have the skill requirements for most quests. Questing is also a great way to get some experience with medium tier pvm encounters as many quests feature unique bosses. There are plenty of quest guides on YouTube and the official runescape wiki to help you along your way.

Ok so it's not just me? The servers have been terrible lately.
---
so just logged into my account today. its been about 3-4 months since I played osrs. and 95% of my stuff was gone. I had 220 mill before and was with a bond in my inventory waiting to use it. I had gotten a notice that all my different accounts google, amazon, epic games were getting hacked. anyway, I think I have gotten most of my accounts back to normal. and then I log into osrs and yea everything is gone. I don't think Jagex will be able to get my stuff back. anyone have any ideas on what I should do.

I feel I don't have high enough IQ to understand how good this meme is...

The circus is in town

am current technician. turning it off and on again is a large part of my troubleshooting. Have had many unresolvable issues magically fix themselves with a reboot, both Mac and PC.

No, theres a statement about it aswell. The lag is horrible :/
---
It only works on PC clients, but it's lagging on every server there
---
There were some but YouTube/google removed them

You know, right and left wingers shouting at each other how their media is lying remind me of religious conflicts. They argue whose god is better and truer and I don't get how you can be that religious in the first place when it's all based on opinions and beliefs.

( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉)

It literally would.

Apparently jagex pays a fraction of what other game companies do, and much much less than standard software companies.
---
So if you work for jagex, you do it cause you like the game and are otherwise doing well, cause they get paid shit and have job skills that could get them a better job pretty quickly.

World 428 is seemingly lag-free. It's a 2k total world though. There are some other worlds that are ok.
---
What world lol

Should have added a "connection lost" message in the top left corner.
