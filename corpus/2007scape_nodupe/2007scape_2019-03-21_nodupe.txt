The fact that they were not only able to hack you but also ddos you shows they had all your information somehow. Not jagexs fault at all you somehow leaked all your info or got phised into getting a virus.

---
---
That's like discrediting settled for leaving mory for a saw and for doing ghosts ahoy
---
That is a great idea.   I have been hopping from roof to roof searching for the Squirrel.  My agility is 87 and no sign of the the little guy yet.  
---
There are 6058 maxed players and I figure if you're maxed there's probably a 50% chance you have infernal cape, and there's tons of non maxed people with them too.
---

---
I think there's definitely more than 3000 people with infernal cape I would be shocked to see proof showing otherwise.
---
I’ve seen more people just go for an early B ring than people going for a ring of wealth and using that.
---
According to the RS support site, it looks like the old name will be reserved to your account for at least 35 days. More info here: https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206519409-Character-name-change
---
Very nice. Certainly would have been a great addition had the update come with a built in item sink to stabilize the supply and prevent stagnation in value.
---
&gt;tfw when you finish watching an entire movie and still have 543 laps until the next level.
---
wont happen though, they want to have jagex boost a niche item like twisted bow to tier 90 when in reality the stats for it are extremely low for tier 90 and would handicap the rest of the game when it comes to item progression for non niche items.  
---
Phew, read the comments but still wasn't prepared for her profile 😅
---
&gt;Just because it's not 100% bis doesn't mean its not great at plenty of things in the game, and using it doesn't cost nearly as much as it costs to use the bp.
---
I literally just told you that it's not great at "plenty of things in the game"... People who can sink 1.2b into an item won't bother doing shit gp/hr methods like Sara or Hydra. Efficiency wise it's ONLY great at the Inferno (one time content) and Raids 1. It's mediocre in ToB and the rest isn't worth it if you're rich enough to get a Tbow. 
---
This really isn't a hard concept to grasp. BP is OP because it's cheap and can be used in SO many scenarios, from high end pvm, to low end pvm and slayer; Tbow is not.
---
Even if they did look into it they will not return your items and by the time they look at the accounts that took your gold they will have already sold it off. The system they have at the moment does pretty much nothing to stop this.
---
Do not collect the reward from monkey madness.  A lot of returning players are forgetting it gives defence exp haha

Would you expect a baking a cake from scratch series to start with the person earning enough money to buy an oven?
---
well maybe for low levels, after getting the tele it was almost useless except for fairy ring, and after getting 82 construction i don't use it anymore.
---
Yeah. The only thing he's not in-character about though is his toxicity. He's gotten a lot better about it though, but he still gets really pissed at the game sometimes. 
---
1. Starts
---
  *  Gambit, Kieren, Ash, Wolf, Sween, Mat K, Bruno (chat).
---
2.  Sween and Mat K talk about recent blog and discussion on hot topics.
---
  *  Spoke to player support, there are 3 main questions/feedback. This time we have one big project, sentiment, each topic makes this up and we're looking at how we can address each one. For things like Authenticator delay and password strength there will be surveys to find out what players thoughts are and how that can addressed. Reiterating that of all of the issues raised this will be the hardest and work is under-way, we want the experts (player support) to talk to you. --- Lots of questions about toxic behavior, perhaps we want to know what players consider to be toxic... offensive language or is it people spamming at the GE? What do we want to address? --- When conversations continue and when player support starts getting involved there will be more information in the coming 3 blogs. --- The increase in visibility and communication will be a good thing.
---
3.  Contest winners.
---
  *  This wasn't included in the blog as it doesn't impact you in-game rather a very small number of players - it's still embarrassing and we want to address it. In the past the process of handling this was not managed well with no accountability, the budget-holder was in another department. In the future there should not be the same issues faced by previous winners - previous winners awaiting their prize should email oldschool community@jagex.com with their account name, contest and other information. 
---
4. Polling and hiding results.
---
  *  Lots of support for increasing accessibility and visibility, players had a bit of feedback on this and we want to look at options like making it accessible via button on game-frame or login screen messages. We don't want to force players to vote but do want to address this. 
---
5. Hiding poll results.
---
  *  We want to consider a number of things with the poll system, this included and restricting voting and seeing who is voting for what. Could polls act as a means of suggestion rather than being a yes/no, what is the fundamental purpose of the poll system etc? What solutions should be in place to ensure good representation and results. Is it working? Hiding the poll results wouldn't fix the polling system on the whole or make it achieve reach with a wider player base. We want players to care about voting and know that their vote counts.
---
6. Fixing old content in-game.
---
  *  It seems there is a difference between what 'we' (jagex team) see fixing content and what players actually want - QoL or larger reworks that are much larger projects that we invision.
---
7. Fixing PVP.
---
  *  In the past we've perhaps spoken to the wrong people and asked the wrong questions, having a confirmation bias by talking to the same people or not talking to the right ones. Perhaps asking a wider range of players, those that actively PVP or those that used to PVP but don't now, what do players want - more players to kill (resource gatherers) or more PVPers to fight? More QoL PVP things? Perhaps focusing on ways to draw people into the PVP scene is where we could be moving. 
---
8. Main Q&amp;A starts.
---
  *  Talk about the seed vault. Check  @jagexmaz on twitter for a preview picture, it's done development wise. Just waiting for QA to look through it, after DMM and hosidius and treasure trails etc, it's a few weeks away from being QA'd. Perhaps in 3-4 weeks we will see the seed vault. 
---
9. The OSRS team often get asked about what they want, what would each member NOT want in the game and why - points for not saying the obvious like EOC or MTX! 
---
  *  Sween: Daily Distractions, not a fan of feeling like having to go do a bit of content --- Wolf: Don't like the idea of health-boosting armour. --- Mat K: When summer's end was released and you have the light the 8 fires, if you died during this part they would go out and you'd have to start again. This was later changed so they didn't go out, wouldn't want to see this change again! --- Kieren: Same thing Sween said, Dailies like distractions. --- Ash: Avatars for clans that gave benefits for training in the area. Giving benefits like that wasn't something I want to see again. --- Gambit: Elite skills that require a minimum level in other skills to access another, prefer being able to work on any skill.
---
10. Have you considered opening Gertrude's Cat to F2P, it's a great small quest and cats area a great introduction pet.
---
  *  That's a cool idea, we could also give newer alternative content to F2P that give benefit? Generally like the idea of low level members content being opened to F2P where appropriate to give them a taste, we also discussed the agility skill in the past (perhaps an intro course or a level cap) to help give F2P a benefit and a small bit of that content.
---
11. Add things to the store to spend unidentified minerals on packs of clay or gems?
---
  *  Don't see why not, good idea to give them a use.
---
12. More unique diary teleports?
---
  *  Like graphics QoL and unique teleports yeah.
---
13. Crack the Clue 2 solved!
---
  *  Feels good to have it solved and great work everyone! In a few weeks maybe Mat K will have a stream showing how it's actually solved.
---
14. Can collection logs and boss logs be accessible via a menu rather than an item?
---
  *  Yeah it could be in a similar place to where the 'poll button' would be - it could be in many places like the diary/quest tab or the account tab. Would be a worthy thing to have in the interface.
---
15. Thoughts on buffing Keris dagger to be BIS against insect monsters?
---
  *  Could be nice yeah [not really an exact answer]
---
16. Chatting publicly on agility course, can we hear players on the other side of the course to make it a bit more social (upstairs, across the map etc).
---
  *  The engine lets us do it for an instanced area, but easily for a larger game world area and if you are going up and down levels it again would be harder.
---
17. [IMAGE] Different coloured max capes for ironman mode? 
---
  *  It does look cool! Strawpoll: 84% YES.
---
18. Are you guys going to address issues with bottomless compost bucket? Adding buckets individually gives you 2 charges but taking from a compost bin gives one charge. Also when using the bottomless compost bucket while the Attas plant is growing it seems to give fewer herbs.
---
  *  I thought the first thing was fixed? The second thing shouldn't be an issue at all and we have looked at the code and tested it further but still couldn't find it. If you can reproduce it please let us know exactly how! 
---
19. Can we have disease and yield rates and how it scales with level?
---
  *  They're all weird and complicated! We could give the rates and that would be good, perhaps the rates at various levels and you can interpolate as appropriate?
---
20. Any chance of bringing back Soul Wars and Stealing Creation with revamped rewards? Would that fit into OSRS and would the community want that?
---
  *  We had this discussion a few days ago! We looked at Stealing Creation and would have to do it significantly differently. With SC the gameplay had to be manipulated and done perfectly to get it done efficiently. The other issue is the rewards, if they aren't 'good enough' players probably won't play it and if they are good enough then the goal like above is to just play as efficiently as possible rather than to have fun. It's also hard to know how players would want to interact with the game these days rather than how they did back in the day. 
---
21. Can we get more player mods and an application system would be nice?
---
  *  Steve W: I agree that we could do with more Pmods in OSRS to help deal with scamming, phishing, games of chance etc that often plague areas of high-traffic like the GE. We currently have 1,641 player mods and 32% are in OSRS. We are actively carrying out checks now and there should be about 100 new Pmods in OSRS next week. All of our next recruits will be for OSRS until we have about 900 in total. --- We have looked at an application system in the past and didn't find it very effective. In a like for like comparison, we actually found more suitable candidates via random selection rather than from the application thread on the forums. If anyone wants to maximise their chances at being a Pmod, make sure your authenticator is enabled otherwise you won't make it to manual review! 
---
22. What are the challenges when it comes to creating art assets for OSRS, presumably you can't follow modern standards while fitting the OSRS aesthetic?
---
  *  The challenge when creating assets mainly comes down to the unique tools and way that the game is rendered. But on the flip-side these actually help reinforce our core art style by providing hard lines that we can't cross with our designs. I could write a whole essay on this but a challenge that we face on virtually every asset is working around the very low resolution vertex grid we have relative to modern games which can be seen when bits of geometry snap about during animations. This gives movement in OSRS a very distinct look that no other game replicates as far as I'm aware. We mainly take this into account when designing worn items and NPCs so that details and silhouettes aren't lost if some close proximity vertices move to different positions. This is less of an issue on props and environment models due to their static nature but it still enforces limits for example the level of detail and smoothness of curved surfaces that can't be created.
---
23. Have been nominated for EE Mobile game of the year! 
---
 * Please vote if you can, we're up against some strong competitors. Voting gives you a chance to win tickets to the rewards. You have to be a UK resident or have a UK phone number to vote.
---
Only so many niche items cam exist that aren't just upgrades before what ever you put out isnt just useless garbage
---
Needs an all-around nerf tbh
---
If they can do that without the EoC part I'd be on board.
---
Not blaming Jagex at all, but it is what is it. Would like it if they could do anything for me. Just hope someone sees the post.
---
What’s your combat stats and what’s your slayer level by chance?  Cause you can camp some monster for way more gp/hr than cannonballs lol. 
---
Well he showed the entire creating of the account through another video and was showcasing it in this series to pk in, it was severely underpowered for his combat bracket (14 str levels) and threw it in this series to show his viewers he was getting it to its full potential... I don’t understand how showing progress on an account you use in a series is a bad thing lmao 
---
I've seen the Venezuelan power outages caused bond prices to go up so much though
---
I like how her eyes are already closed, patiently awaiting the incoming ice barrage. I wish I could lose my spade with such zen. 
---
How much did you make off the zulrah scale update? 
---
Now you see? Now you see now? You know you fucked up right? 
---
Yeah I went about that much without one too, pretty sad feeling lol 
---
You won, he deleted everything. Gottem.
---
No he’s actually a 6’5 200IQ computer science major alpha male who can bench an elephant 
---
I don't think they expected him to level by pking. They probably just thought that the training would also only be done with resources from that account.
---
You don't give out any account info while buying gold tho
---
Good cosplay, great pics :D
---
Yeah, uh, I was asking Reddit to see if anybody knew for certain or had done it before.  "...at least 35 days. After which it may be freed up." is pretty vague. There is zero certainty in it, except that it's a minimum of 35 days.
---
It'd be cool if using a weapon type vs a specific monster gave you increased damage against it.  Like if a specific being (demons maybe) were weak to maces, because they give prayer bonus.  Something along those lines. (Not saying to replace darklight as BIS, but maybe d mace &gt; d scim, even if just slightly).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There are many useless items in the game.  Torag hammers for example.  Another recent example is the hydra tail, useless item with such high reqs.
---
Whos to say they dont just make up the results anyway???
---
What are the complaints about Zulrah and NMZ?
---
Lol. "Trained data analysts." Trained data analysts are the ones that say you should hide poll results prior to participating in the poll because seeing the results before you vote skews how you vote.
---
For Karamja Elite, can’t you just use the Lunars spell NPC contact? Or is switching spellbooks too much of a pain?
---
I thought it rerolled hits over 50 to hit something between 45-50, and not just a 50 everytime, could be wrong though. 
---
Blowpipe being op was a good thing. Before the blowpipe it was all melee scape. The blowpipe made range useful, while being costly to use. Nowadays the blowpipe is a staple ranged weapon while there are still several other range weapons frequently used depending on the scenario.
---
They shouldn't do anything because either you leaked your info which is 100% on you or you rwted it and hope you can double up now. So you screwed up 1 way or the other and your bank is gone now.
---
What do you think is more likely one of those 2 or jagex had a huge security breach and all the hackers took was your info for a few mil?
---
Go for it. Play around with some of the new skills a bit and just jump into doing quests right away if you enjoy questing 
---
Double name change and its instant. 
---
Otherwise its like 30 days + an extra day for every week you had the name or some shit like that. 
---
that doesn't make sense.  if only 12% of the rs population is voting it would only take another 1% of the population to vote to either kill an update from passing, and another 9% to vote yes to have a vote pass using your 87/13 number.  The fact that such a small % of the community votes makes your one single vote mean even more, and you are not taking advantage of that and throwing it out because your mindset is lacking greatly.  You cant expect someone to hold your hands throughout your life, learning that now will help you mature and be a providing person to your community.
---
It’s 7$ bro lol
---
You do realise the point of the game is to play it? Why don't they just make Vorkath afk while they're at it? Fun for everyone!
---
maybe if theyd have done this like a long ass time ago instead of doing nothing like usual we wouldnt be sat here sharpening our pitchforks. people are tired of waiting for jamflex to get data and do fuck all with it
---
He made a dumb decision and committed to it, now is in denial of it being a dumb decision to protect his ego and this is the result.
---
Dude is a bitch basically is what I’m saying
---
Isnt the series called "Pure set from scratch"? The point being it is about pking to earn the cash for a pure set, he said nothing about the stats being from scratch
---
Delayed 1more day
---
Trying to rebrand a skill and failing to find a focus group is such a good concept and your interactions are funny, just had to be slowed down to see.  Don't sell your humor short.
---
I get what ya mean, though.  Might take some different editing techniques to find your zone.
---
Can we get this guy a freakin audio job jagex?  Geezas off the chain
---
&gt;People who can sink 1.2b into an item won't bother doing shit gp/hr methods like Sara or Hydra.
---
People who can sink 1.2b into an item will do whatever the fuck they want because its a game and they clearly aren't desperate for money. I've seen tbows at Cerb. I've seen tbows at demonic gorillas. I've seen scythes AND Sanguinesti staves at dks. And I don't know what rock you're living under, because I've seen more tbows at GWD than anywhere else in the game past raids.
---
Stylus OP 
---
Not the guy you replied to, but i once fell for one in another game.
---
My friends account was hacked and he messaged me saying he saw my video and thought it was cool, i asked what video and he sent me a link that was slightly off the games official forum url, swapped a o for a 0 or something. It loaded up a forum that was identical looking to the official one and a video embedded. When i tried to play the video it prompted a login. The second i hit submit i saw my character logout on the other screen.
---
I was lucky in that i had a macro set up to login so i was able to contest the login over and over logging out the hacker while i reset my password.
---
What can they do? Idiots will always find a way to get hacked. 
---
Yeah well that’s how it is. There’s a good portion of the community that don’t want it. It needs to pass a 75% threshold and it failed. Twice. 
---
Pretty sure I got the idea from you
---
Was watching live and I figured someone would clip and post immediately for the fake internet points.  
---
complaining about agility in 2019 when we have vertical camera and screen markers is silly. agility is not even bad when you have a cheat client lol, you don't ever need to change camera angle and all your clicks are mapped out.
---
it's an afk skill now tbh. just watch a show on the side, you can turn your brain 100% off doing seers course with runelite.
---
Some tasks I need to high alch/barrage on, but yeah thats a good suggestion, will have to look into it.

MSBI with rune arrows until you can get broad bolts, shouldn't take long at all.

Anyone else find it hilarious someone complaining about a series/video starts off their complaint with “I don’t watch this series” 
---
Wow! So glad you managed you keep your items safe
---
Yeh that's what I'm doing which is why the pickpocket cancels his attack I think? 
---
whether you think you amd everyone else is being influenced or not, you are and thats the point
---
yes you can absolutely, nobody is *required* to pay clans to protect them. but it's the wildy and people can kill you, so there's that.
---
If you want to get someone that job, go check out the guy who made the music. The link to his video is in the description of mine
---
What about the time and location of the logins? I don't really care about the ban, but I would like to know if my account was compromised.
---
we back in 2017 boys
---
I’d add on to that by saying never deal with these types of people thinking you will outsmart them because you won’t and that’s usually how they get you.
---
Also plays runescape so that's neat
---
That’s the issue you don’t watch and have an opinion lmao.
---
Throwing a short clip of your stat progression of the account you pk on in the video series about you pking is definitely relevant...

Am i the only one who enjoyed doing tithe farm?  I used to hate farming until i found out about tithe farm and powerleveled the shit out of my farming doing it.  I miss the days of getting a level each round

---
Well if you ask me it's a bit of an insane idea to begin with (Runescape is already like THE grindiest popular game still around, isn't it?), but it's fun to watch at least.  And to each their own, I guess some people have been playing thousands of hours a year for the past 5 years straight and need something to do lol.

It was already sorted out, its the creator that treatened to drop untradeables. Maybe he has another account, and he doesn't need this account, his reason is unknown, but its not illegal to do stupid shit on your own account. The money is transfered and its not RWTd, and the creator is still the owner even though OP got access to share the account on his own risk.
---
Natty or juicy?
---
I had quit for awhile and wen I came back I had no auth or anything set but I came back it’s a acc made in 2003
---
Void is really only effective at high levels (like 95+) and even then its effectiveness over dhide is very marginal outside of raids or chinning unless you have multiple stacking boosts along with it (like dhcb + rigour + salve ei at vork. Even there if you only have salve ei, blowpipe, and no bgs spec then dhide is already better pre-99) but reddit circlejerks about it so much that you'll see people with range lvls 70-85 rocking void 
---
Don't forget if you have DS2 done grab Ferocious gloves before Prims.

Easiest way to tell if the previous owner had the laptop bought for them or if they bought it themselves.  STICKERS!

i remember that, you could kill it if u prayed
---
Here's another idea, maybe F2Ps who've finished Dragon Slayer can vote too
---
You mad over some pixels lol 
---
Yeah all you idiots just listen to these guys just never get pked, no one ever gets pked its literally impossible bro, alls you do is hold your dick sneeze twice and pray late and night and you will NEVER get pked, it's impossible bro, didn't happen to me so it can NEVER, EVER happen to anyone else even over thousands of different iterations.  
---
I know this cause im smart and not an insufferable piece of crap.
---
ur supposed to block those
---
&gt;less game updates pass.
---
I think this is true but it doesn't need to be a bad thing. I think QoL, major content updates (like raids or quests), and random community suggestions would still pass just as easily because people would still want them.
---
The stuff that probably wouldn't pass in a world with hidden poll results would be poorly designed content like mediocre item rewards or general contentious shit like rev caves. 
---
Right now the content output is like 3 big updates a year(raids/kebos/elf quest etc) with 1-2 small/medium size things per month (like miniboss content). I wouldn't mind a world where the 1-2 small content updates became more QoL-like with only the really good ideas filtering through like player designed shit. Don't see why Jagex would be afraid of this tho
---
There are people who vote. And there are people who don't vote. And whether or not YOU vote will never change that by more than 1 vote. And 1 vote will never decide a presidential election. And the day it does is the day that I vow to start voting
---
???
---
&gt; literally never
---
Let him but out quality not quantity. 
---
don't think its possible to get that information.
---
If you watch YouTube while playing rs I’d definitely recommend checking it out,  some of the clips of him and link going out in shit tier gear trying to pk are a good laugh.
---
Hey, we don't want them either!
---
Why the fuck arent they banking the runes??? 
---
Understandable have a nice day
---
Didn't even know it had prayer tbh
---
That's not a negative.
---
Yeah, that's called clickbait.
---
It’s literally presented with the question. You don’t need more than an instant two read a two-bar bar graph.
---
You're crying cause you're unhappy with someone's criticism on the internet.
---
I know this is probably a news flash, but there’s more people than just you. Your attitude spreads. Then you have millions of people not voting. 
---
Don't even need to safespot, they won't try to get to melee range. 
---
Okay sis! 🥰🥰 
---
Please explain how increasing slash defence bonuses, and slash defence only, will cause you to hit 0s with a bludgeon?
---
Or how increasing stab defence will cause you to hit 0s with a whip?
---
Youve never bought it from a major site then. 
---
Torso, torag legs, BIS ammy/ring you can afford with BCP cash
---
Only real issue I see with runelite plugins are the demonic gorilla plugins and the puzzle/lightbox solver. Both don’t encourage you fo actually learn the boss/puzzle but rather spoonfeed you it. 
---
PVP plugins for checking stats isnt too bad as you can also do that on the website, hp bar is also a fairly minor thing IMO as its not 100% accurate. 
---
The poll results are hidden so im not going to vote because i like to see whos winning before i vote. 
---
Trying to figure out best helm slot and shield for bursting in MM2 caves. 
---
I'm going with vestment as recommended here yesterday. Master wand for AFK ability, occult neck, but can't decide on those slots. 
---
Prefer to keep it cheaper, since I don't want to sell bank to get ancestral hat or anything. 
---
Opinions? 
---
I watched a guy doing Chaos Altar prayer yesterday, with noted bones and a DFS.
---
You will hit harder more frequently so yes.
---
Right so because I am not voting, millions of people are not going to vote.
---
Because of me entirely.
---
You are out of touch with reality
---
They've never heard of ironman mode

Have you considered just wearing tank gear?

In the case of aberrant spectres that would be d'hides

Where are you getting your "average total level" statistic from?

Hey here's my f2p to bond from scratch series.

Step 2: redeem bond

I think you actually agree with him, but you misunderstood.

February 2017 poll? Lol. Also, there's legit zero logical reason to have results viewable before they close. You keep doing you though, champ.

Yeah what redragon said, levels post 99 don't count, they're just tracked by runelite.

&gt;It won't and it shouldn't happen, they're integrated into the game and lots of new content has been balanced specifically around these 2 items. 
---
So what you're saying is that the bp SHOULDN'T be nerfed since content was built around it, even though it IS in fact horribly op, as you've already covered. You're making no sense here, buddy.
---
&gt;I addressed both aspects of the argument and my argument about fucking with a prayer bonus after 2+ years is valid.
---
No, actually you haven't once mentioned the prayer bonus until you said it shouldn't be nerfed since it's existed for so long, which is the stupidest argument I've ever heard.
---
&gt;Also, why am I still arguing with some peasant who probably sold his bank for DWH and doesn't have a Tbow in 2019?
---
Holy shit that's the most brain-dead attempt of someone running away from an argument they've completely failed at that I've ever seen. I really hope you didn't even try with that, because if that's the best you could come up with, that's just sad.
---
it would do alot, the vast majority of people arent going to google the current results before they vote lol
---
Don't click so hard bro. Or use mouse keys
---
Where are you still seeing this? It should be mostly removed and not shown by default.
---
I'm still a bit low level slayer (79.... soon Nechs!), so I'm not sure what it's like at higher levels, but what can you exactly barrage. I know Smoke and Dust Devils, Nechs, and Abyssal Demons (?). Is it possible to barrage/burst so much with only those options? I may just be unlucky, but since I unlocked Dusts I've only gotten 1 task for them ever...
---
Oh shit now i realize damn runelite 😂
---
The fury is a great upgrade that will stay with you for a long time until you get to torture/anguish so it would be pretty nice investment 
---
Lol true. Died to too many bosses because she was horny when she got home :/
---
Can't put it on pause!
---
I’m currently rocking dragon armor, whip, fury amulet, and berserker ring.
---
Ah it's funny bc my dads '14 wrx just ate shit
---
The only way they can improve pvp imo, is by not getting the skillers and pvmers caught in the middle of it. It's called pvp, not p v people who don't want to fight. 
---
Oh no
---
I'm a purpp sub. I'm just not a spastic prick like yourself &lt;3
---
I did it with like really high stats and went through like 4 brews and 15 sharks for the hardest demon what you mean

Oh damn. Had a few like that, it's a magical place out there.
---
Ahh I see a fellow Subibro! Stay safe my dude.
---
No wayyy... I'm on the vorki grind rn and that's disheartening lol
---
Thanks I hate it
---
get good poor scrub 
---
Support but only if Jagex waits until get another range level
---
I agree, thought i usually vote regardless. I understand how if you look at the polls and something is by far passing/ failing you tend to feel like your vote doesnt do anything which when many people have this mentality it is actually true
---
lmaooo
---
congratz dude! im saving up to start my acb runs looking for useful advices!
---
which ring did you use?
---
Woah buddy. The internet points are definitely real. They're very important too, okay???
---
tbh I wouldn't say no to that.
---
It's a series.  He's pking gear on the account.  He has no desire to train the account from scratch and never said he would (and said he wouldnt).
---
What's the difference between what hes doing now, and if he had maxed his pure first and then started the series?
---
Never done fight caves before, is the Guthans/Blowpipe or just straight Blowpipe easier for first timers? 
---
0 weight is the same as -100 weight 
---
Only purp and ron are alright lol
---
I'm sorry, what should I even build 10-44?   So new to construct
---
Alright, it just seemed real, as in someone had hacked this account and tried to abuse it, as in getting it banned. That's what I ment with sadly.
---
:D
---
I remember when nexus first came out, and I reported 2 glitches with it, and one of them was that when I built opulent curtains, they appeared as teak wall decorations. I actually got a mod response, but only to the other thing and they never bothered to tell me that it's supposed to do that when the room is surrounded by other rooms. Felt kinda stupid when I happened upon that information by chance on the wiki. 
---
How so? Decreased voting population does nothing - the vote is by percentage of voters, not the entire population.
---
lolol
---
Meanwhile the "high level community" doesn't want the mid-low level peasants voting on their content. I hope Jagex never makes community/account specific polls. 
---
Your entire comment is terrible
---
Its definitely negative. Jagex spends dev time anticipating large projects are going to get a thumbs up from the community. Imagine if something like priff ended up completely failing the polls and players just said fuck elves lol. Jagex would have wasted alot of man-hours.
---
I farted reading this and shat my pants. Thanks dude
---
Holy shit it was so frustrating listening to the other mods before Ash chimed in. 
---
This can't be real, can it? How much easier and no risk do you want this game to be?
---
You can barrage Tzhaar, Ankou, Bloodvelds, Dagannoths, Abyssal Demons, Nechryaels, Dust Devils, Smoke Devils, but only the Nechryaels and Devils are worth barraging, Ankous are meh, they're fast but not great XP. The other monsters I listed are possible to barrage but most people don't because of mechanics that make them annoying or because they're crowded. 
---
With an optimal task list, you will be at Nechryaels, Dust Devils, and Smoke Devils for 50% of your time spent Slaying. Note that this isn't the same as 50% of tasks you do are those 3, you just spend a lot of time at them because of the Slaughter Bracelets and Extensions, and the tasks you do for points are done with Expeditious Bracelets and are assigned in far lower quantities.
---
Nooooooooooooooo. That account is not me. Total miscommunication. I was just saying I change my alt names to mimic theirs so they have to change all their bot names or risk loss. That guy is once again , for the record, NOT ME. 
---
I shat my pants at work once. I no longer trust you if you tell me you haven't shat your self once In Your adult life.
---
Ah okay, my apologies
---
You can for sure use a cannon.
---
pures are the only people there
---
Say less! No offense taken 😊
---
Don’t blame elections for laziness. 
---
The Reddit hive mind on hiding poll results is hilariously over exaggerated... Or it was hilarious, but now it's just annoying.
---
Kinda but I don't know how I'd do it. 
---
Probably in one of those zombie mini games that someone made with source engine, where 100's of players start but few make it in the end. 
---
But then he can’t get attention. 
---
It failed a vote 66-34. You can't just write that off as "oh well it failed because the poll itself wasn't hidden". Do you honestly think that there are that many people that just vote based on the winning option. This also goes against the "people just vote yes to everything" analysis of the polling system I see thrown around.
---
Where’s this link? 
---
15 kc in and I got a karils top and DH legs, 5 runs later I got torags legs, currently dry from 40 runs
---
I agree, people are gonna say "oh you only want it gone because you can't do it", but bosses shouldn't be based on a broken mechanic to get better trips.
---
!
---
Reworked how?
---
he's still there w303, looks like he's muted tho
---
Yeah we have to be near tick perfect if we want to brid with 200+ ping and even then we are still behind anyone playing with &gt;30 ping
---
So true it hurts
---
lol
---
I doubt it. Pking gear and pure equipment is heavily hated on. Probably going to pass better with hidden polls tbh.
---
In the [example](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Abyssal_demon#Drops) in the main post.
---
Never have. Hopefully never will. 
---
Nice
---
It's was never there. What you are experience is a split in the universe where half the people in the world remember something that didn't happen in this universe.
---
Look into it bro. 
---
Well this isn't their max cash series it's a pure series
---
Or just 0
---
No smoke staff for alchs. Scrub status 
---
The disadvantages of being a pure dont change? Its not like u can suddenly wear rune armor or use veng. 
---
If it's a fact it makes updates pass less and can be proven then they can also easily lower the requirement for polls to past to be similar to before.
---
So yes this is the best reason not to do it, but it's still a very silly reason.
---
The context of it is getting gear through pking. Training a stat does not effect that one bit. 
---
Or, get this, I made an assumption that the max amount was lower due to how the spec works.
---
so just autistic then

&gt; This is like me saying "I'm going to make a cake from scratch" then proceed in buying a pre made cake and putting my own icing on.

But isnt it more like saying "im going to make a cake from scratch" and then buying eggs to make an omelette and not using those eggs for the cake?

He got it from scratch on his main, duh... some people...

unless you're a moron like this guy, who also brought a dfs, then yes, literally never

It's a shame. One of the finest AWD systems ever manufactured, at the sacrifice of requiring an engine thats only 2-3 cylinders long.

Lmao? You shouldn't have an opinion at all if you don't play. The fuck kind of logic is this?

How does that relate in any way to what I said? I'm laughing right now irl at the fact that someone as stupid as you both exists and has a platform to express themselves

One thing that always bugged me was people would say "snort crack." I guess it's good they don't know the difference between crack and cocaine, but it still always bugged me. 
---
What levels should I have before unlocking boss slayer tasks? I'm not really worried about efficiency, really just looking to add some variety to the slayer grind and start to ease myself into bossing. I'm 82/92/82 melee stats, 87 range, 83 magic right now, and my main concern with unlocking it right now is getting something that would just be impossible for me to do
---
I always worried about this happening as a kid.
---
It's the unfortunate reality of being "employed" by YouTube.
---
Looks like r/runescapegonewild isn't enough. We're going to need a runescape gone kink subreddit.
---
Somewhat.  There is a mod that allows me to add retextured items into the game in addition to the normal items so for instance, the crossbow and twisted bow are both regular bows that are just renamed.

Generally you'd do torture -&gt; tassets -&gt; bcp assuming you have d boots and a torso no?

"double checked" how lol
---
I think if they lowered pass % required the communoty would throw a fit. Assuming it did lower pass rates and the community would be fine with lowering the % I'd be all for it. But all I see is big drama from that solution.
---
Not as much as they're gonna make off of rev uniques /s
---
Yeah, today was the first day that I consistently had to put in my password to log into mobile. I didn’t see any updates about this tho. Just curious if anyone else had this happen
---
Me too
---
Quest Cape was a great goal for me. It forced me to level skills quite balanced, brought me all over Geilinor and it unlocks some handy stuff!
---
If you're done with that the Diaries are also a great way to boost your motivation to level. I have all the level requirements for all the Elite diaries in my RuneLite's Notepad, and I spend my time slowly working towards those levels. It's great to keep a goal in mind!
---
?
---
I don’t understand what is meant by ‘ragging.’ Forgive my ignorance, but that guy is on a pvp world. Why would he not attack anyone he wants. And if he’s a whale out there, someone should bring him down.
---
You think that, but eventually you will need to train it. Unless you're super casual, and that's not an insult. 
---
I'd say 99% of stuff that has passed so far were good updates. 
---
Smoke devils.
---
Get quest Cape! The skill requirements are very doable and will leave you with a solid account afterwards, I would start training farming for that as soon as possible (itll unlock many diaries as well, which are extremely useful) along with runecrafting to at least level 50 for quests, you dont need to get it any higher until some hard/elite diaries 
---
Definitely should be the crab pet

Inb4 people without any concept of the game saying it should be 100k firelighters per recolour.

I linked you an article with dozens of elections where 1 vote was the difference. Either your a bad troll or too dense to be able to admit when you’re wrong about something. Either way, you’re a moron. Get bent. 
---
It wasn't*

That's quite a manly hand
---
Major sites need 0 account creation lmao

Regardless, the % isn't what's important here. What's important is if this is a good idea, which I think it is. Cheers.

Hydra technically has the highest requirement to kill at all, but the kills/hr are pretty fast and decent profit means a lot of people will get the heads passively as they grind the boss.
---
I think the rarest one would be kq because everyone wants to use their first head to complete the elite diary, and then once they have the diary done there isn't much reason to kill kq unless they specifically want the pet or slayer helm recolour.
---

Trying to make people vote who don't want to vote is a horrible idea.  For starters most of the players who don't vote have no clue what would actually be good for the game.

---
It’s one of the only ‘interactive’ elements in osrs where when it feels like you’re doing it right you are rewarded for it, I think it’s perfectly fine and should only be ‘fixed’ if it ruins any content but I seriously doubt that will happen

groupthink and upvote arrows. All it takes is a few idiots too steam roll an idea to the top and people will often take upvoted comments as a sort of truth on this site. Misinformation is rampant on here

He said he was getting the pure set from scratch. He said in ep. 1 that he'd train his account with other wealth.

Gp/kill fluctuates a bit depending on scale prices but when you account for uniques it’s around 180k/kill. Meaning you only need about 20 kph for scrolls to be worth using. And I agree that for people learning it’s most likely isn’t the best because of a lack of consistency. But if you can consistently average around 2-2.5 kill times which most people should if they are farming Zulrah then you would want to use scrolls 
---
I honestly don't know if you're being intentionally dense or not. Let me ask you a question, in the titles of their stream does it say "MCFS"? Then if you check out the points of their competition, what does the header of [their points sheet](https://i.imgur.com/5kFOgei.png) say?

But if people similar to you choose to not vote under the same premise your group will not be fairly represented. Your vote also really matters on local elections where a couple familes could sway a vote.
---
Possibly, but there are some things that just need to be done. Small part of the playerbase might whine, but they would get over it. It's up to Jagex to communicate it well though, that's the big part.
---
Don't really have to guess. Not only does this make it look like people are winning big but it also makes the trades a lot less trackable for the rwt aspect.

So gonna play devil’s advocate. What do you mean by “current consensus”? Like is this just the opinion of streamers and redditors or the entire player base?
---
If nothing pasts why would you try something new? The polls should still be hidden, the obvious thing is to adjust the % needed to pass, not undo it lol.

I think it's possible to get a talisman by stealing from a chest in the molch temple (requires 64 thieving, iirc). Technically doesn't come lizardman, but it's a way to get a talisman without combat or gaining favour.

How do you withdraw all in 1 click?

80 combat stats should set you up for bosses as Vorkath and Zulrah.

If you're serious about bossing I also strongly recommend Construction. Having a Rejuvination Pool and the utility of all the in-house teleports is incredibly useful and will make bossing so much easier for you!

This was the first time I used it in ages, and that's only because this was the first time I searched something about osrs and the new wiki not being within the first page of results, so I used the old one (I replaced it because the auto mod literally gave me the link to the new one). So the one time I don't use it and he posts something like that? That's insufferable.

Depends on who you are. There people that want less updates and people that want a lot more.
---
Either way people still want polls hidden though.
---
The only options are everything passes or nothing passes?
---
Tbh I don't even know who the dude is and the crying over this is just petty.  From what I've read, the point of his series is to pk shit from scratch on an already built account, not build an account.  He just sped up the process to build his account.

Imagine thinking your life will get impacted that much because you vote in a turd sandwich instead of a giant douche. OH NO NO NO
---
Add it into the customer support(omegalul) tab in OSRS. So just a little handy button to vote on the polls. I do my absolute best to vote but there are times where I am super afking for weeks on end and my character has everything in the inventory he needs to do so self sustained.
---
Maybe its petty to not vote in a poll because I can't walk my virtual fat ass over to a bank, but usually halfway through considering it something happens and I forget. 
---
Once an active poll notice has been announced on my account once I also don't see it pop up again. So the first login after a poll goes active I'll have an announcement. Any login after that even if I didn't vote won't notify me "hey dummy, go vote".
---
So for a real life example during quality of life month I missed I think one poll? Now that isn't that bad but it's very easy to not even remember a poll is active because of how much they hide any notification it's happening post the initial login.
---
I might also be retarded and just don't see it everytime I login, but I'm pretty confident you only get one notification a poll is up and if you forget during that session you may not vote period because it's not 100% directly on your mind to go check the poll booth.
---
A little green flag that raises up and down is pretty fucking stupid if you ask me. Make it a neon sign that says "polls active" and much like strip clubs with new dancers attendance would increase.
---
Use the runelite client.

You did the meme backwards...

I did i used everything on him. I was following a guide and for some reason when it got to the point where i had to make the key i could not make it

I unlocked the boss slayer for this exact reason and after a few tasks it became more of a chore to go a kill things like the GWD bosses. I just got rid of it after a while, wasted points imo (unless you're an ironmeme of course).

Well, one thing you can practice that's really helpful is triple Jads. I watched a video of it while putting it really close to overlapping my screen, and tried to flick in the actual game while watching the video. Because the game won't be completely in sync it'll be a bit awkward, but the practice is amazing. I first tried triple jads and have never died to it, and other people who did the same thing after I gave them that advice also first tried triple jads.
---
For the shield, well best case scenario have 3 people with a bulwark following in a line, walking in a 29-tile wide area somewhere that lets you attack something (maybe clan wars and shoot at a friend with your range weapon), then they switch the follow order when they reach the end, and after 4-ticks start going the other way. As long as one of the ppl there understand inferno, they can let you know if you're messing up or if you're properly staying behind shield. Other than that, well tbh just doing other stuff like tanking Verzik in ToB or running Olm in a solo will help a lot with getting better at movement in general. Tbh, keeping in line with the shield first try isn't that hard, I nearly half killed Zuk with ACB on my first attempt, but ran out of supplies. It's really more so being aware of all the common ways to die at Zuk, like when enraged Zuk's attack are no longer at the same time each cycle, so safe spots don't work, but because you're so used to leaving the wall at a certain time after hearing his attack hit the shield during the non-enraged form, you'll at some point leave the wall early by accident because you subconsciously started using that hit sound as a cue to run away from the wall (at least that's my theory as to why so many people, including myself and B0aty during his inferno attempts on his inferno from scratch series, make that seemingly stupid mistake). If you take note of all the common ways to die to Zuk, you can mentally prepare for them.
---
Tbh biggest thing about first trying inferno is the regular waves. Practicing alternate flicking between mage/range, practicing the 3-tick timing of flicking against blobs, etc are gonna be huge. There's really a lot of things you could practice.
---
Ok so with all of that said why should it be fixed for balancing? You can call it spam clicking but you still have to keep the rhythm so you only click brainlessly after mastering it, how is that a problem? Also going back to my hydra example, here is a perfect example of how learning it causes you to be rewarded with longer trips by constantly switching quick prayers then going into one ticking. I can see how it can be less interactive when killing regular monsters definitely, but that’s up to the person on whether they want to use an advanced mechanic on a standard monster. Using lazy flicking would be the exact same concept if something attacked every single tick, so if you change the attack tick rate just to get the timing right it is basically almost the same as one ticking with a little extra effort. That extra effort is preferring to click every 4 or 5 ticks instead of 1, so it really makes no difference interactively and comes down to what you’d rather do, meaning balancing is just unnecessary

Ohhh, not that i know of. If i fish swords on mobile i always end up using the always “right click”. Its a pain in the ass but better then tap and hold.

I guess so, just sort of feels like it kill sthe content for regular accounts because then you need to commit to ~400 kills or so once you get the first one

I guess people aren’t allowed to post about their enjoyment of a game we all love..

If you want to complain about click bait titles then actually have a clue what you’re talking about. The reason why SO MANY(and I’m sure there’s plenty of content creators you like who do the same, nothing wrong with it) content creators use click bait titles is because of the way YT works and their algorithms, if you want your channel to get the most views and grow the fastest way possible then you use those types of titles. 
---
God I hate it when people (mostly autistic kids who don’t understand the way real life works) complain about people using click bait titles or people trying to make money from YT when they spend a lot of time on it and it’s their main source of income. Not very many people out there are fortunate enough to not have to make money from things they invest a lot of time into. They try to demonize content creators that do these things while not realizing they’re idiots for doing so.

There are videos online which try and explain how to antilure by explaining to you how the people luring do it. They might even show themselves antiluring someone and making a couple hundred million gp. It looks easy so you try it but you will fail because there isn't an antilure and you just get fucked.

For example, this video: https://youtu.be/DSISjUWBUU4

There are even fake comments with people pretending they did this antilure and it worked.

What if the changes cause people to start voting no? That sentence fundamentally undermines the concept of voting. Seriously, if something doesn't pass a vote, it's because the majority voted against it. If you want to argue that the majority shouldn't be left in charge of those decisions that's another subject, but don't strip the impact of people's votes. No is an acceptable answer.

right if you're settled right now, you have an opportunity to make a significant amount of money.

A lot of YouTubers fall into a pit where they don't have a plan after their spotlight, however long it lasts. Very few move on from YouTube. Most are thrust into 'fame', but don't realize it's not going to end as quick as it started in most cases. They cling on, when they should really move on from YouTube and entertainment when they eventually pitter out.

Especially with something they've polled in the past, and failed. Please don't get me wrong, as I would love poll results to be hidden. But it failed the poll. There's obviously some validity concerns, as that poll wasn't hidden... But of course they're going to collect more data before they simply implement it. Could you imagine the outrage for passing a failed poll simply because Reddit made it a meme?

copypasting a response to this from another thread:

""abusing an old system" is one of the only difference between a bad and good pvmer, also you can do inferno without using any 1t prayer and therefore not abusing an old system. Im not sure how you can think using a method which puts your own fate into the hands of numbers and rng is better than using a method where you control the outcome of the damage you're receiving"

If you're colourblind like me I think that's one reason to hate it. The ghosts have coloured capes and weapons in their hands, but green and red look super similar to me, and the silhouette of the sword on the melee ghost looks way too much like the bow on the ranged ghost, so telling them apart at a glance is way more effort than it should be.
---
 
---
I recommend the cerberus runelite plugin that tells you what to pray for the ghosts. Some people might call uaing a plugin like that "cheating", but the way I see it is that the boss's mechanics should have been more readable in the first place.

If you're an ironman I feel bad you son, you're gonna go through a ship load of prayer pots without a spectral spirit shield.

Yeah I range them, the door is a safe spot but also when you walk in the room to the right along the wall there is a safespot I use more then the door. Maybe use a magicbow(I) and rune arrows instead of blowpipe?

Fast isn't really a thing with farming but you already have much of the large xp drops out of the way. I would say do some allotment patches, since youre 69 you can do snape grass seeds and use and ultracompost to get as much xp as possible. You can also do cadantines, since theyre the best herb you can plant and theres an herb patch at every allotment.

Aw he was genuinely stoked to get it. That was wholesome as fuck
---
its good that the lower level staves have a gap between some of the higher tier options because it either creates a situation where there is diversity in what +1 is potentially viable to use or it encourages additional risk. if you could catch freezes and dps really well in a water staff and salad robes that would really ruin pvp balance as is the low cost options are too powerful. especially since they added purpose to ahrims staff etc i feel like its really helped balance things out.
---
but yeah battle/mystic are pretty pointless for pvp and magic training. always got confused that if i borrowed a friends account to pk on and they had water battlestaves for their return sets. like what u doin homie
---
Absolute fastest would probably be trees, fruit trees, calquats, and hardwoods as often as possible, with tithe farm to fill the time between runs. And don't forget that you can boost the farming level, so you only really need 78 if you're using a stew or 80 if you're using a pie.

I'm all for having dedicated areas pvpers can go have fun (like clan wars) but anything that helps pvp is getting a hard no from me because fuck those guys that gank me when I'm trying to do pvm content and have to go to the wildy. I don't want them to have more of an advantage or incentive to harass me.

Someone spending that  much time doing rc probably has full graceful, which would put them well below 0kg with an inventory full of essence, so it shouldn't matter anyway.

i mean if you constantly flame your whole community and expect them to never throw punches back you are mistaken

But how? It just means total poll figures are inflated with skip votes that do nothing

If they were going to do that they could just fake the numbers that are currently shown ?

I did mage arena II not too long ago and came across a couple of people who tried to pk me, and I fought back to deplete my resources... I actually found it fun fighting back. I would have more incentive to pk, but I lose all motivation to pk when I come across a group/team.

Void + rigour + salve amulet stack to make your blowpipe an absurdly good weapon

. Even with just addy darts you can do 13.3 dps.to shades at 99. If they had unlimited hp that would be 190k xp per hour, and you could push that higher with better darts.
---
In practice you have to deal with them only having 100hp, and you probably only want to repot every few minutes but 150k+ should be easily acheivable for your last couple levels before 99.

For melee at 50 attack your options are granite weaponry, hammer and sword being the best. Hammer looks sweet though. You should get 60 attack and do monkey madness for the d dscim. I highly recommend 43 prayer for monkey madness.

Voter turnout isnt the primary issue in my opinion.  I prefer to consider polls to be an opportunity for players to band together to reject game changing updates such as the removal of free trade, the introduction of MTX, and another EOC style update (people on reddit and across the community are actually asking for an overhaul on magic accuracy/defense as we speak).
---
One important aspect of bandwagon voting is that people are more content with the outcome if they supported the bandwagon.  That means even though some people might normally not like an update, they are still content with the update.  In my opinion, if the potential update isn't obviously bad enough to be immediately rejected by the community (removal of free trade etc), then I'd rather the developers get to form a concrete update schedule than have to (even more than now) have to edit and make updates that are clanky.  I prefer this because, typically, the mods will poll/repoll changes to their updates when the community are outspoken about it not being how they imagined or what was promised (with the notable exceptions of NMZ and BP).

I mean truthfully, no one gets it at 75 range, the requirement is kinda irrelevant. I would like the level increased though, it gives jagex less room for powercreep, but it really doesn't change anything the way it currently is. I wholeheartedly agree with the blowpipe though, it's very accessible and a massive upgrade that people are often able to purchase at 75 range. I think nerfing it is the right call though. You can make it a higher requirement, it's still insane dps for 3m. It's just too accessible for how strong it is.

I’m not praising any one you spaz, the server is good. Better than other options available. Put a plug in it weirdo.

So that used to be the case in 2013-14, but that's how we ended up with a bunch of things that have passed polls but haven't been added to the game, like the hitsplat color change which passed in 2016. Sometimes the Jmods don't know how long a project is going to take, so they work ahead of time to even see if the project is viable, and then poll to see if the players want it. I would imagine this has created a bit of a general ethic to the way content is developed in the game.
---
There's another problem, which is a marketing one. If the mods announce a change as they begin working on it, the hype buildup on larger projects is really bad for the popularity of the update. I'm no marketing expert, but I'd wager announcing Group Ironman right now when they're probably close to two years away from actually getting the project done is a terrible idea for player engagement. Remember the furor over mobile and how that took a full year longer than expected? Winter 2017 is still a fucking meme because the wait was so outrageous. I guarantee that at the business end, it's in Jagex's best interest to have a decidedly fixed window between announcement and release for most updates, so polling content before any development has occurred is just never going to work, financially.

Training combat and making money is a hard combination to make, as you will have to sacrifice xp for gp. I would go the slayer route or can get some range levels and try vorkath.

[Our accounts are pretty similar](https://i.imgur.com/JHaDxy0.jpg) and I just got barrows gloves myself! 
---
The next goal I have set is kind of a unique one! I want to unlock the tan leather spell. This will allow me to turn dragonhides into dragon leather and then craft deagonhide bodies with said leather. That way I can camp my dragon slayer tasks for a longer period of time and make more money. Once I get a higher mage level I can even use the lunar spell that allows you to access other spell books to alch the dragonhide bodies mid-run! I think it will make the dragon slayer tasks I get more profitable and rewarding. I have a long-term goal of getting 99 slayer so I’m sure to get a lot of them!
---
Unlocking the spell has some interesting requirements. 
---
1.	Lunar Diplomacy
---
2.	Fremnick Easy, Medium &amp; Hard Diaries. 
---
3.	78 Mage
---
I like the different skills it’s forced me to train and unlocking the lunar spellbook will be a nice bonus.

I'm aware that weapons below 70-75 are no longer used by high levels, but that is a not a good argument to not re-balance them.
---
And not really, i'm asking for warhammers (and longs) to be better than scimitars against tanky opponents. The idea isn't to make them all similar DPS on everything as that would kill diversity too.

---
&gt; Although depending on the monsters' defence and general defence against different attack styles, they can provide better DPS. However that's it.
---
That is the point. I don't think scimmys should be nerfed or anything. But the other weapons should excel in niche areas. Taking advantage of defense weaknesses is the way to do it.
---
There are situations where slow weapons are better over fast weapons, in multi combat zone a player with a slow weapon deals a big hit gets the drop vs multiple smaller hits from other attackers. I envision a battleaxe or 2h weapon would be used in this scenario. 
---
What defines 'from scratch' then? If thats the case nothing should ever be 'from scratch' unless it's a level 3 from tutorial island, but pretty sure heaps of people have done it with just clean accounts and nobody bats an eye.

However she allows you to have save tasks and still get some good cash on the side, of course a bit of rng but usually you make more money than you spend on PP for example
---
The only negative aspect of her is that she also assigns the location which in many cases leads to in-efficiency, for example: if she assigns dust devils you can hope to get katacombs so you can burst them down quickly to get to the next task

Sorry for the long reply ,
---
Definition of from scratch: from the very beginning, especially without utilizing or relying on any previous work for assistance. Using gear from a main is relying on previous work for assistance.
---
I think the idea is ok but is way to overpowered for what your suggesting. I think it should not work in the wilderness at all, does not teleport you to your spawn and maybe requires more than 1 ring of life to charge it. Now with those changes it could be helpful to disconnecting hardcores, but will get rid of any imbued dks ring for dps. Might be dead content on release for some, but I like the idea.
---
And then you hit her?

ur mistake was making your post a dig on RS3 instead of letting it just be a joke

Im not flexing I was giving reference for a suggestion

I didn't use it, i just sat and watched the stream. Good discussion from the mods, but nothing about the topic of the stream XD Thank you thou
---
Most games are based around watching a number increase as you complete some task. Even shooters are all about increasing your number of kills by clicking on a moving object. Watching numbers go up gives us a little dopamine boost (temple trek) so it's not that crazy. Although getting a skill to 99 is less so since it takes so long between levels. 
---
Personally; I find that once you do the inferno, going back isn't as bad as the first time since you have the ability to do it on task, which makes it substantially easier in terms of the DPS you're given with the slayer helmet. 
---
I'm with many other players to the point where it took me months as well to get an infernal cape, getting two seemed like a natural thing. "If I can do it once, I can do it again" motive.

....pvp means player vs player. Staking is also not simply 50/50 odds or a "toss up" such as what some gambling is. I dont think its even worth making the point as to why it would be dumb if you just said staking isnt PvP. 
---
But to reiterate..why the hell would change how PvP works just because "one always ends up losing $$" i dont understand that. Its the literal point of pking. You risk whatever you choose to risk. Why would you take away the risk/reward factor of pking? Its also not meant for making money..yes you *can* make money off pking but you need to be smart, and/or "skilled" to do so. And while pvp in a whole right now is pretty stale and boring IMO the changes made need to be that "skill" is actually brought back. Right now its just rng 1 shotting people really with gmaul/ballista/etc.

Spotted the bondscaper. Everyone point and laugh. 
---
1000$ over 12 years really isn't that much. 83 bucks a year, $40 at christmas and 40$ at the birthday. 
---
Lol another post to shame people who are actively playing and supporting the game and helping it grow.
---
85 woodcutting?  95 firemaking?
---
What’s the gp?
---
because of my wording of the title?
---
thats uh....cynical 
---
Something I don't get is how the game mods can't track who the gold ultimately goes to. It's known that the game mods can see each and every transaction that these bots make. They make money off the scam, trade the money to some mule, mule will eventually trade it to either another mule or a main account? Maybe the money just keeps getting circulated between some endless amount of bots? Maybe some portion of it gets traded as multiple RWT's to some players and never reaches a main account?
---
It at least invites people to vote, and doesn't caus the mass yes/no like other suggestions. 
---
Or maybe he wanted to keep it beliveable
---
Big purp is dead
---
Congratz! Anyone whose done this 99, knows just how tedious and long it takes compared to other 99s, quite the accomplishment. Judging by your agility, it seems you didn't do barbarian fishing for most of it, so I'm sure it took extra extra long, what method did you use?
---
Is it weird that this gives me motivation to train agility?
---
I had the same question as you a while back and I can confirm that if you safe spot and AFK, you will still get superiors.
---
I never played him before the rework but I'd rather have them revert it for 2 reasons:
---
1. The circle jerk.
---
It's the most requests revert. Yet they dont revert him.
---
2. His current horrible design
---
His presence in the jungle chokes the viable junglers in the game. Whenever he isnt viable there's great jungle diversity. Whenever he's meta there's only like 3-4 other viable junglers because they have to compete with his level of clear as well overall strength.
---
It actually wouldn't be too hard to code up a bot that manages a fleet of alts to continuously trade dicing bots for 30 sec at a time...
---
You vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about
---
Dont know the whole story but it definitely seems like something lacking in the relationship needs to be addressed very very soon 
---
It was outside the challenge. The leveling was outside the content context, there would be no reason to make it longer than necessary. 
---
I love league of legos 
---
Nah I'd say level 80, remember chaotics pre eoc ? They where OP but still level 80, maybe t bow would be level 85 but I wouldn't go as far as lvl 90
---
Says you, who continues to argue with me even after I stopped replying to you, get a fucking life. I think maybe you’re an abusive person to your significant other, I would tell them to leave you.
---
why are you being deliberately obtuse? your comment is so fucking dumb on several levels dude.
---
I feel like as long as your at 65 hp + you gotta be pretty unlucky to die *every time* the pid switches. I feel like the people who get to cry about PID are the people who PK 24/7 on osrs. I've been pking for about 6 months now. have a decent amount of kills and a decent amount of deaths, and for me PID isn't even an issue. I don't even really think about more so than, Oh, hes gonna hit me first, so im gonna eat instead of going for the 25hp risk. I think the majority of casual pkers don't even pay attention to it. 
---
it's not worth the effort at all, better off getting 91 runecraft for double natures
---
dont worry. I'm 1k KC dry at demonic gorillas for zenytes. could always be worse.
---
I remember in 07 always wondering if this would happen at barbarian village. I guess it couldn't there, but anytime I quickly looked and didn't see a spot, I got my hopes up.

This made me happy

Are you referring to the UIM series?

If you didn't know im sure at least one other person who see's this also might not know, so im sure it was to some degree :)
---
Will this be uploaded to YouTube?
---
Who the heck are you? wtf
---
To get all slayer pets you would on average almost get 13m slayer.
---
Sire: 2560 * 450xp = 1.152k 
---
Cerb: 3000 * 690 xp = 2.070k 
---
Grotesque: 3000 * 1350 xp = 4.050k
---
Kraken: 3000 * 255 xp = 765k 
---
Smoke devil: 3000 * 240 xo = 720k 
---
Hydra: 3000 * 1320 xp = 3.960k
---
Total of 12.717k if you get every drop on its droprate. However getting it on its droprate is ~63%, so the better number would be doing the x kills * xp where x is whatever droprate gives a 50% chance. 
---
I guess my question is, if I eventually want all the pets, which one should I wait with until I get a certain item. Like postponing grotesque until I reach a Scythe. 
---
3.8k kc without pet here; got all other uniques though.
---
Troll account, check the history, this is just an attention seeking post

It'll be fine, I never panic in games anymore. I just haven't had the time to play (haven't been bothered to).

A significant portion of Jagex's leadership are just people that got in early and have just been kicking back in the easy life. Very few if any of them are actually competent enough to be in their positions, if Jagex died today none of them would end up in anywhere near as good of jobs at other companies.
---
Slay for the next 3 years

And he won't even be able to do that pretty soon. Would look something like

No. It “decreases voter turnout by 12 percentage points”. Meaning compared to when people did not know the outcome, voter turnout decreased by 12 percent. 
---
Keep doing it. It takes time and deaths to know how long to stand, and when's the best time to run early

 Blah blah blah.

This was really funny!

Thank you, I was gonna go drunk do a dangerous farm spot but I',m not sure I can 100% get back so i'll pass til ltomorrow
---
I have seen many lower levels using the two handed swords. I figure that the slower attk may be worth it if the damage is large enough. Still, I cannot seem to play without a shield. I have absolutely no idea how much a shield helps me or not, but it just doesn't seem right to not wear one. XD

When he was a YouTuber he would often be very critical of jagex and their  decisions but yeah now he's a part of the osrs team in a nun unsubstantial role he's got his hands tied I'd imagine on a lot of things as do most of the team in all likelihood
---
And other peoples pet sounds, the two drive me crazy. 
---
Also doing successful recovery auto disables authenticator so "a bit" is just meme

So he doesn't get hacked

---
JAGEX WONT RESPOND TO THIS THREAD
---
Yeah people use it to solo attack in Barbarian Assault. For people doing slayer this info is useless, so Bulwark spec to get whole room aggro is better.
---
Yeah not the hardest pet ever, but better than no pet I guess!
---
Bloods feel *much* better then runespan tho. The level of afk is similar, I'd think even slightly higher, and you get actual runes instead of chromosome points
---
No bully egger
---
When the quest guide says that you definitely need to bring food and you just oneshot everything..
---
What I said was true in terms of raw numbers (99 is 13 million xp, 1% would be about 130,000 xp, lvl 50 is about 100,000 xp), but higher levels typically unlock higher method xp methods, and gathering skills like fishing and woodcutting have a faster collection rate with a higher level. So while level 50 may be less than 1% on paper, it is higher than that in reality.
---
Weirdos 
---
Maybe a DMM limited to like 5 hours a day or something of play time. Would allow people who work to compete on a more level playing field. But it might also be irritating. Just spitballing here. 
---
I can't unsee
---
Ah okay. What level is 200M?
---
But Jimmy wasnt listening because he was busy spam clicking darts.
---
prolly the most useful comment here
---
Gz on tentacle fart boi!
---
Or a fat credit card
---
why would you agree? op made sensible arguments
---
Oh I'm only 70 RC so I wouldn't know. Something like runespan definitely feels a lot different from actually runecrafting bloods. And also runespan was a lot faster... You also need 77 RC which takes a while. So it's not comparable at all imo.
---
Also, if he did what I did for crafting, you can make 100m getting to 99.
---
ITT: it’s fine guys, there’s nothing to do about it. Longer intervals between episodes is unavoidable. Chill

Cause you’re a noob and should quit this game 
---
Except the polling system is already flawed in that a majority of people already vote in their own self interest. Should we limit the polling capabilities to only high level players, anything that would nerf or “devalue” those accounts would never pass, even if it’s the correct change for the GAME and not their account.
---
reading the comments, how the hell does everybody has so many hespori seeds. I only got 7 
---
What if we started a poll to see if people like the idea of hiding poll results? Better yet let's form a committee to form a poll to see if people like the idea of hiding poll results.
---
120 is 104m

Nope, im very well aware of the hide stuff on your screen meme, dont you worry about that. Your response seemed so serious that i gave it a serious answer.

It makes me angry tbh

New streamers have pretty muched missed the boat, had they started up 5 years ago they probably would’ve been popular now. Very difficult for new streamers to become big these days

If he loses inventory, will he start from scratch again? Or will he just transfer over what he lost? His account lost all legitimacy the second he mentioned his main. You don't know what's real and what isn't. And then add on the possibility of feeding him loot via other mains. It's reality YT. You can try to edit out the script, but you'll be caught.
---
Woox walking with rigour?
---
Wrong?
---
Essentially you don’t have to pay for membership. One old school bond is like 3.7m gp right now I believe. Multiple late game content bosses that provide 2m+ an hour.  Thereby if you do fall in love with the game, you can eventually stop paying for it. 
---
You cannot get 300k/h with crystal spear

It’s so true tho when you go watch a video trying to teach someone something on osrs. Today we will be fighting jad for the first time. Get your full armadyl and blowpipe out. Ez pz. 
---
I've had the same issue for months now. A mod reply basicly told me to ignore it. As long as your email is secured with authentication you have nothing to worry about.
---
Changing your email won't do anything, since it's just the email jagex sends you their spam to. It has nothing to do with your login. 
---
I read this, left and you fucking forced me to come back to give you the upvote you deserved
---
Wow really unlucky, consider myself pretty lucky got all drops at 2261kc, 3 claws now. Hope you get one soon mate
---
I fully support this idea
---
Can we just have a fookin poll for this already.
---
If you have changed your password, and checked your authenticator is still active. You have nothing to worry about. Just don’t click on any links via the email, manually navigate to account settings on the official website.
---
it's from the perspective of jagecks
---
Almost 6 hour logged :x
---
Gzgz
---
Rng seems weird to me, if anyone can help.  
---
Let’s say we have an item with a droprate of 1/100. After 100 kills you expect to have 1 item. It can be under or above droprate, but not to extreme. It seems reasonable to me to expect this items around 100 kills. 
---
My problem is with expectation. Take an item with a droprate of 1/1.000.000
---
It doesn’t seem reasonable to ever get this drop, because it’s an independent roll every time on the drop table. 999,999 rolls end in nothing and 1 gets you the item. This happens every roll. More kills doesn’t give you a higher droprate, but just another roll on the drop table. 
---
Explain to me how it’s reasonable to expect a drop after 1 million kills. 
---
if you can afford it, buy a month of membership and grow from there. f2p is extremely bad for money making as well as xp. many members quests give lots of xp for early level skills, and it will be much easier to make money on members
---
How possible is it to feed him kills? He has used his main's bank stack to speed things up levelling, why wouldn't he also use that stack to feed himself kills and noteworthy loot?
---
I'm at 77, 89 was my goal, but it's at the point where I never want to touch this skill again.
---
ev's a cunt to his audience so we can be a cunt to him, prove me wrong
---
Got my heads after 365 kills, hang in there!
---
Nice, looks good.
---
Arseplomancer style
---
Thanks, currently I only have rune body and d legs, was considering a d boot or d chain investment for this. I’d forgotten about shields tbh, been using a god book without pages lol
---
:( 3 zenytes full heavy ballista and extra spring gang at 1000kc checking in. 
---
Thank you :)
---
Thanks :)
---
bruh
---
how many times you get pked?
---
Yeah it’s a Sara drop not Arma.  In the lore Zilyana pretended to be allied with Kree then yeeted his crossbow. Because a single crossbow seems far more powerful than an entire other allied force of screaming bird-men... fuckin Zily...
---
Did you take into account the levels you need for all these bosses?

Cutting-edge graphics lmao, gotta break out that 2080 Ti or forget playing

The volume sliders ingame are terrible. I have to use the windows mixer.

Struggles, strife, unpredictability

Simple, repetitive, seamless

It’s not for everyone, no, but there are two very different sides.

Life is short enough and miniscule enough as it is and that’s before any human struggles. of if someone enjoys something and it doesn’t hurt or ruin their short time here for others then let them have it.

Do Zulrah.

Uh...No. They do designs and poc stuff before the polls, that's it.
---
she literally has a premium snapchat pinned to her profile
---
It’s divided by 3 btw
---
It’s actually 50%. 
---
Ok.
---
When I first started I made 4 woodcutting alts and 4 fishing alts. Unfortunately, the fishy boys are not worth the time of day because of the horrendous price of lobsters. The woodcutters, on the other hand, have only continues to rise in value with the steady increase in yew logs. I get a solid 2-300k/hr depending on whether I’m HA on the main or just staring at the wiki page full of money makers I probably need another three months of skilling to qualify for. 
---
I’ve been thinking of training the fishies to be woodies as well but, well, that’s another twenty to thirty hour investment I’m not even sure I’ll use... I should probably just focus on the main until I have decent money makers available then funnel the money into training a few afk-combat alts, since that seems to be ones of the higher money makers. (Though I’m only like combat level 60 so what do I know.) 
---
Ohh I think I'm starting to get what you mean, although it's making my brain hurt. It just looks better but mathematically they are the same.
---
League looks so terrible 
---
Doesnt mention what he does during the fights.
---
What you quoted says that he's throwing his axes to execute.
---
Reading past your quotation it says that he developed signature moves such as spinning axes (Q) and Whirling Death (R) during these executions.
---
During the Awaken video which is essentially a bunch of lore clips and he's fighting Riven with no throwing.
---
Will deffo need to do that, they’ll always be one person to come and ruin the buildings haha 
---
I haven’t I just haven’t got round to it yet :) 
---
eww no pking
---
how do they remove the email without knowing enough information about the account?
---
What’s even funnier is that a little over a month ago he made a comment saying “implying you can’t have acquired A BCP and tassets below 110 cb is dumb”
---
That's a nice one! Probably will do base 70s first then get the quest cape
---
Yeah it wasn’t viable at all, I thought it would be funny to try but caught like two invents and packed in haha
---
One day! :D
---
I never did the quests as a member because I assumed they were like the ftp quests but wow they really aren't. To this day the quests have to most depth and story in a game I have ever seen. And with the added humour and charm I didn't then thoroughly entertaining. For me, no quest has yet to feel tedious and the more you complete the more you unlock for your character. The pleasure for me is completing challenges to unlock items. I got the firecape last year which was a huge goal since I was younger. 
---
Pretty impressive that you can write, but not read. 
---
Sauce?
---
Sorry you can have it back!
---
Having a good posture and no pressure on wrist. Do some stretches every 45-60mins and drink plenty of water. Main thing is posture and who pressure on wrist though.
---
Thanks! I will probably get base 70s first and then see what I should level up for the quest cape and the diaries
---
/r/iamverysmart 
---
If you cannot comprehend droprates or chance you might need to look into some math videos about statistics and binomal distribution. Getting 100 rolls at a 1/100 table or 1m at a 1/1m table doesnt change anything
---
60% spec rather than 30% though, I'm sure the chally would be better than the d2h unless you have 10+ alts running the route
---
if you're unsure, log into osrs website and check your mailbox there. This is most likely a phishing link and the fact that it's [a.jagex.com](https://a.jagex.com) and not [jagex.com](https://jagex.com) might prove that but idk if jagex uses the [a.jagex.com](https://a.jagex.com) domain
---
I have 75 mage and 85 range and I can kill zulrah easily. With your stats you should be killing zulrah before it gets to jad stage.
---
I died 3 times and now on a 40 kill streak with not teleportation or dying. I used for mage -
---
Ahrims hood, top, bottoms
---
Barrows gloves
---
Trident of the swamp
---
m ward
---
o neckless
---
infin boots
---
god cape -
---
Range -
---
Archer helm
---
Bandos god d'hide legs, top. boots
---
blowpipe with mith darts
---
avas
---
My kills average at 2mins 16 seconds
---
that would be even easier with hidden poll results
---
But the point is that the guy actually said that in show (I assume)
---
Editing it too much make it seem forced meme 
---
"Let's camp the Wintertodt for 50 hours! LES GO BOISSSSS!!!"
---
I was at base 70s when I got my Quest Cape, Ranged and Strength were 80+ for bosses, but the rest was around 70. Requirements for all Quests is surprisingly low!
---
Thank you! 
---
r/lsd 
---
Actually 
---
upvote posts, make comments, make posts that are intersting and spark discussion, etc.
---
Sadly i don't think any of the clips in awaken were actually canon. Sion couldn't be there, yasuo wouldnt work with anyone, jhin doesn't kill camille or vice versa, riven was never in the arena etc
---
Thanks for all the suggestions guys!
---
lol are you retarded? those are clearly  grindable, might want to read the definition of grind again. And there aren't multiple people with 200m fishing exp without the pet, unless they died with it on purpose.
---
Stop spreading nonsense
---
So how do we apply that to a tournament mode?
---
RS3 JMods also admit they worded the question completely wrong but still use the statistics from the question to justify a future update :)
---
Get rigour. You'll get 99 ranged eventually without chinning.
---
Get rigour first, you'll both speed up your vorkath kills and then passively work towards 99 range just from killing vorkath to make more money. 
---
I'm honestly too lazy to do the calcs right now, but rigour is probably a bigger upgrade to dps than 99 range anyways.
---
The buttom line wasn't even necessary
---
Ahh good. Finally some Ev drama. I was banned on his stream randomly once upon a time and had a friend ask him to kindly look into it and unban me. My friend was flammed, and then so was I. We we're only polite to him, and didn't see why we got the treatment we got - accept the twitch chat seemed to enjoy him abusing us. 
---
The guy is a tool.

Virtual Levels plugin in Runelite/osbuddy

I did way back when. They went and deleted the backstories for all the champs I actually liked, though.
---
Best places to train combat f2p?
---
Combat 42 and been at hill giants but it’s normally pretty crowded.
---
Also best way to make money for a bond? Selling big bones and yew logs at the minute.
---
Necessary on both threads, obviously
---
Have you tried turning off area sound volume
---
Yup this is it
---
Pvp isnt 0 sum. Drop tables like revs wouldn't exist outside a pvp zone. 
---
EVscape is so toxic.
---
Let Swampletics decide.
---
Looks like a phishing email. Just don't follow the link. 
---
Screenshot the link they're telling you to copy paste
---
Get rigour. Take it from someone with 99 range sans rigour. Can’t afford it yet and already have 2m exp over 99 range. You’ll get 99 range eventually. 
---
Use adamant darts mate, waste less scales
---
exactly, because 100 other streamers are trying to do the same exact thing. it's too late for youtube/twitch, unless you're some really special case and know the right people
---
Thats a positive.
---
high 80's feels like the end is never in sight. 90's you just know that each level is a solid step closer.
---
My rates of exp post 90 went up tremendously because of this autism
---
I don't get why people take being called autistic for playing this game so personally. If someone calls me autistic for having 99 agility or runecrafting then yeah I cant really argue that clicking the same 10 spots for 200+ hours is anything but autistic.
---
That you get banned for botting chinchompas in anyway
---
You can't cut yourself on an orange 
---
What if I like my waifu games more....?
---
That's pretty cool haha. I'm a very secluded player, literally never watch YouTube/streams and also have never done any form of PvP. Probably why I've never heard of this. 
---
I grinded 70 defense just to wear Karil's instead of Blessed D'hide.
---
This method was known and used long before the skilling discord existed lol
---
I play osrs for the realism
---
&gt; Explain to me how it’s reasonable to expect a drop after 1 million kills. 
---
I know what you're saying, but it's a false assumption.
---
Let's say the item is 1/10 drop rate. If we kill an enemy once, what is the chance we DON'T get the item on the first kill? The answer is (9/10)^1. For every subsequent kill, add one to the power. So two kills would be (9/10)^2, etc.
---
After 10 kills, what is the probability that we still don't have the item? 34%.
---
This holds true for any drop rate, regardless of the number. Once you reach the drop rate it will be about a 66% chance that you receive the item.
---
All leading up to one of the biggest challenges - getting in a car crash.
---
No, it's because it's normie shit that's socially acceptable to play. 
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** Sekros! ^(hug)
---
Pros better than vestments. Dds and Nechs have such low magic defence and magic level that as long as you're not splashing you're fine. 
---

---
Your initial takeaway is accurate. This game is about working towards goals - and magically, whenever you achieve one of those goals, another distant goal pops into your head.
---
There was an interesting post by a guy with a terminal illness on this sub a few days ago - he said that without the future to look forward to (goals to accomplish), this game wasn't much fun.
---
All that said, if you want to get a taste of this game's fun, try looking up some videos on higher level builds (best in slot melee, range, etc), or raids or barrows or bosses (zulrah, vorkath, fight caves, etc). A fantastic goal for you would be to defeat tz-tok-jad in the fight caves, obtaining a Fire Cape (nearly best in slot cape). That goal will lead you through much of the game's early and mid level content.
---
What helped me was comparing the accuracy of my setup with the dps calculator made by Bitterkoekje. Just put in your set and see what the accuracy is for Verac/Torag and Guthan. Just be sure not to wear something that is extemely inaccurate for magic (fighter torso is -40 for magic accuracy for example). 
---
Congrats dude, but it pains me that you didn’t do barb fishing to get at least 70 agility.
---
Most people should probably be using b gloves over fero. They're nice though. 
---
Have you never jokingly said I "I'm the best" before? Especially if your playing with friends and you get a kill on them and they ask how you did it and you reply with " have you tried being good at the game like me "
---
It's just people having fun mate
---
All of them 
---
1400 total slayertard lol

This argument does not and never will hold up. If Jagex really wanted to rig the votes, they could do it regardless of the results are hidden or not

Why isn't it something they can fix? This only happened in the last iOS app update.

yeet

got mine off willows. didn't even know it was a rare pet at the time
---
BAHAHA love this! 
---
Was like "Wow, this guy did my job for me!" and threw you an upvote then saw your username. I like the way you think, my man. Me and you have the magnifying glasses out when it comes to this game lol
---
Very handy. XP depends which NPC you're killing.
---
For Giants and Wyrms, XP is actually really decent. Chinning too. Remember that all XP is free, so even if it seems slow, you're saving money by using it.
---
Very useful also for falconry. And for bursting it's pretty much necessary. (Free pray, barely any pots needed.)

Yeah and that's EHP for melee. Bulwark speccing nechryaels in catacombs with two spec transfer alts.
---
It was definitely easier than other more click-intensive skills. I don't have the free time that 15yo me had back in the day. This and cooking will probably be my only 99s.
---
Bulwark speccing nechryaels in catacombs with two spec transfer alts is melee EHP.
---
Exactly. It’d be better the opposite. 
---
was there an ETA yet on Hosidius?
---
I never said you couldn't, I just said it's not made for it, retard. Runescape is primarily a pc game, you honestly can't believe it's even anywhere near possible to make the game as easy to play on mobile as on pc. 
---
The only fucking moron here is you, and it's clear to everyone. It's ok to suggest improvements to mobile, I never said it doesn't need any improvement. There's definitely things they could change, but throwing an autistic fit like a fucking sperg who's parents decided to not let them play video games anymore is not the way to ask for improvements.
---
The fact you can't see mobile is fucking amazing for being a fucking phone client proves beyond any reasonable doubt that you lack the mental capacities to even have this discussion. 1 nature, 5 fire runes, get on with it you fucking sperg.
---
There are green drags in non wild?
---
Normally a lot of scammers have people messaging their marks to encourage anti scams that they know will fail.
---
Did that happen to you or do you mean that your actual friends/clan mates were encouraging you to anti scam the guy
---
What do you reckon for fight caves then, bp for the waves and rcb with diamond e for Jad?
---
2200 worlds are locked down by rot, you pay them to not kill you lmao
---
True - Settled already had a fair bit of a base iirc before Swampletics shot him up to the top. 
---
I can't imagine any original OSRS video ideas, given that pretty much everything's been taken up...but I guess the ones that can do really well.
---
Grabbed a dragon hunter lance before they shot up in price a bit. Wanted something pretty much afk but also got me clue scrolls and decent money/hr. Did all of these kills in the corsair cove dungeon. Cape to get there, tele to GE to bank, tele to house if I needed to heal. Anytime I got a clue I left once my inventory was full, completed the clue, then rinse and repeat.
---
Yeah that is some rough rng for ya. Overtime though it'll eventually even out. I got my first at kc 80 then my 2nd task i got another. Have only had 2 tasks there sadly lol been waiting for a 3rd (been like 4 slayer levels without a black demon task). I got my 2nd on probably kc 220 or so? Somewhere in that range. 
---
its something jagex can fix, but not ash kieren etc, the client itself isnt something they work on, but other teams at jagex know and are working on it
---
If it can help anyone learn from me at least, the scam was I got taken to the gate east of the rune shop in Varrock (the little gate that lets you into the fancy dress shop). I was asked to drop my item and trade for cash and a seed pod so I thought I sniffed it out right away (he gave me the monologue 10 times about clicking the seed pod for "fireworks"-- in hindsight, this was a pretty good red herring). In actuality when I dropped my dhcb I was getting stuck away from my dhcb while his friend spam clicked the gate until I could no longer get to it. Then the main guy tele grabbed it. You can call me dumb if you want, I know it was dumb. Hopefully somebody learns something new here and can avoid my mistakes.
---
Thats a lotta bass

What part of “touching RS skit” made you think it was supposed to be funny?

On his way to driving lambos

The most vile thing my character has encountered in the whole game was a coif

Same boat, I'm 27 now and I just can't grind out 1000 hours into nostalgia lol 
---
EVScape ... more like EZscape.
---
Some NPCs lose aggro after 15 minutes
---
Not a whoosh dude. Just saying this meme could be better by swapping the dog and person and labeling Jagex as retarded to their incompetent responses to why we want poll results hidden. A whoosh is when you missed the joke...that is clearly not the case here; op just made the butt of the joke the wrong party.
---
🦀🦀🦀 JMODS REFUSE TO HIDE POLL RESULTS FOR NO GOOD REASON 🦀🦀🦀
---
I probably ate like 100 of the bass being a moron and letting my pray drop, but noticing quick before i died and ending up on like 20 hp lmao
---
Woo, nice write up friend. I'm glad you were inspired to post this.
---
Much respect to you, I was about ready to die just doing 75-99 so I am massively impressed, thank you for posting! :).
---
There is no "turning in" a task, once you're  done you're done and free to go to whichever slayer master you choose for your next task. 
---
Once you reach your fifth task, you should go to anyone besides Turael (the guy in burthorpe), because Turael doesn't reward any points at all.

Well yeah, but Dualyeti suggested datboigames was thinking of something else, when someoen *did* do this with a C hally the other week and get *like* 300k
---
Is that Robert Whittaker?
---
tldr; We hear your complaints.
---
May I ask which app u downloaded for this the 1 I have doesn't look so neat as this.
---
Should have hopped worlds, went inside the gate, then hopped back
---
Yah... bc it makes sense for the community to be the butt of the joke /s
---
Alch yourself
---
What app you using?
---
Jesus fucking christ there is nothing that triggers me more than people complaining about a lack of updates.
---
We have had over a year of non-stop updates. Over the last few months, there has been a **weekly** serious fuckup as a result of these rushed updates.
---
This game needs less updates, not more. Your entire comment is garbage. 
---
&gt; ranger hat, and robin hood 
---
which mory diary are you on?
---
Hey, what's the workaround? I hate turning my phone landscape, shows I'm playing a game! Is it available for android and ios? 
---
Yeah. I guess I was already kind of confused so it was hard to think on my feet like that...
---
I’m gay and even I’ve seen this cfnm classic
---
Ok
---
Hard to think straight when your bank is on the floor and you’re panicking I suppose, but thats a good idea.
---
I see what you did there, "settled into an equilibrium" 😆
---
What I meant in the OP was that it is good enough for now, but has so much room for improvement.
---
I'm hopeful they are working on this but haven't heard anything to confirm it.

Typically legit accounts get a temporary ban for their first botting offense tho. Repeat offenders and gold farmers are the ones that get perms
---
Luke cage??
---
It's not new
---
Nah quest cape first brother it's so rewarding.
---
how you do dis
---
link?
---
Salve amici!
---
Everyone’s given you really good advice. Just keep in mind if your only goal is 83 farming to quickly get that spirit tree, then using boosts is allowed as well.
---
For that reason it’s possible to get 83 farming as soon as 78 with stews or 79 with garden pie 
---
At the very bottom there’s a lot of downvoted comments. :) 
---
Nice reading comprehension 
---
I love that you redact the wildy level you're in as if it's important super secret information that doesn't take two seconds to figure out
---
Also grats
---
Went 560 kills dry before first drop, first drop was an onyx as well. Better luck to you.
---
Don’t think can post links, it’s on the oldschool rs newpost 
---
How u do dis
---
Everything he took to train on that account was then transferred back
---
It’s annoying sure, but you guys are blowing this way out of proportion. They’ve already stated they know about it. You have to click 4 buttons to log back in. (5 if you have multiple accounts on your keychain)
---
Okay &gt; Sign in using RuneScape account &gt; your keychain will be ready to auto fill your account information / select an alternative account from your keychain &gt; Touch or FaceID &gt; login
---
Takes me all of 5 seconds to do
---
What are your blocked tasks?
---
oh bby u turn my d dagger into a d long

 Everyone believes Ant-Man could kill Thanos by shrinking, going up his asshole, and expanding. I thought about this, and I can’t think of a worse death.. for Ant-man. Thanos is pretty tough, like can take some punches from the Hulk kind-of-tough, well his butthole and insides have to be hulk-level strong too.  
---
The way I see it happening is Ant-man crawling up his butt, expanding and then whatever I can describe as the chunky human soup that would come flying out of Thanos’ ass from Ant-man trying to expand into something that just won’t budge. 
---
Don’t remember off the top of my head, I’ll get back to you
---
I chose ROBLOX, if it helps you?
---
No and pretty sure that's against the rules
---
Runelite cant affect the game like that I dont think. Actual input would be an offense.
---
You should become a motivational teacher or something. Gratz btw
---
Is it my turn to repost this tomorrow?
---
 a lot
---
Incase you got plenty of evidence. collect all info and send an email to tipoff@jagex.com
---
I just put 07 and 9 random numbers.
---
They're dumb to show the formatting, but not allowing other numbers.
---
If you get muted, does it say so on your ban status page? 
---
My bf can't chat or PM, for public chat he presses enter but nothing happens, in PM he can 'send' it but the message disappears. His account was fine like a week ago but he typed a few A q p W's so he thinks he may be muted lol? It's a f2p account if that matters, he got hacked and subsequently banned a few months ago but that ban was overturned within a day of appealing. 
---
PMing his account works just fine.
---
gg, you used up all your luck, have fun with the rest of the game
---
Too lazy to look up the graph, but I suspect it's because people thought it may get a buff at some point. People probably gave up hope in that and dumped them.
---
Well the question "Is this normal?" is still warranted. But the answer is probably "No, but you got unlucky", the vast majority of first offenders who autoclick no doubt just get slap on the wrist bans but like you said you have to issue some perms so that players aren't enticed to bot until first temp then stop.
---
07123456789
---
They did that already.
---
It failed.
---
It would help if Jagex posted updates on their news and updates page 
---
Hunter 10/10 also only skill that has 2 pets to farm.  Pikachin and Herbiboar.  From 65-99 is about 115m to put a value on this method.
---
They're just bald caps but worse.
---
I
---
But will they come to the vote page? And do they really care about voting?
---
Also suffering this. Seems to be not taking inputs from anything that requires you to submit a value with the enter key (bank quantities, typing in chat, etc)
---
Me want. It's certainly possible with the data they have access too.
---
I started wildy slayer at 60 combat and don’t have an issue with it at all. I’m training combat which I would be regardless, plus slayer xp on top of that, plus I’m building up slayer points and emblems as well.
---
I’d rather have all of that than just combat xp for slightly better xp/hr.
---
gUyS tHeSe aReN't eVeN fUnNy
---
Probably because of the character limit on items
---
It's not that hard to stop 5-6k xp away from leveling....
---
subaruuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Spamming what you are buying/selling isnt social, just a waste of time.
---
Trading in general wasnt social, either. No one gives a shit about your day, they just want the item/gold you have so they can be on their way.
---
The game is still social, even more so now because the 3k people that would be standing at the varrock bank spamming to sell/buy items can now actually play the game and have time to actually socialize with other players.
---
Pre-ge was a fun experience, but post-ge is a more gaming friendly experience. I dont have time to wait around anymore for trades, I only have a couple hours to play anyways.
---
Wait for the RuneLite update
---
Where s the fish
---
Blogpost say it is
---
It’s worth it because it’s constantly prayer training without having to do anything. For that reason xp isn’t high but adds up quickly. For quick reference you’ll probably get about 5k-6k average an hour doing slayer tasks 
---
Yes just 2 months back i was making good money...REMEMBER: don’t try total worlds, come with agility shortcut and bully and outDPS your way through the other Venezuelans/gold farmers....even without the shortcut I was rarely getting pked.
---
If your less than 110 combat don’t bother coming, both pures and mains will pile you, you’ll get bullied by high levels and even blowpipes can outDPS you.
---
Why do people cut trees they have planted? Isnt it a waste of time?
---
No sympathy for Irons, you choose to limit yourself. 
---
Why would you make an account, train it, and check it's age at the end of every episode. He could have started it as a redy maxed pure or any other pure build with 0 bank. Then he could have pked and made the money. BUT NO. He made a lvl 3. Strated training it. Checkimg age. As he would building a pure. Makes no sense to start it as lvl 3. Just use alredy existing pure if you are doing a SET from scrach. It is really confusing to build pure as "pure from scrach. But transfare ton of gp cause it's" set from scrach". 
---
Or just play on mobile.
---
I've been trying to message them but I don't know how to get a hold of them without telling everybody how to do it. It's possible somebody could trick a streamer into showing their details on stream.
---
Beat a motherfucker with another motherfucker.
---
Not this time. I'm starting in Wintertodt to get all herb packs. 
---
Have texture packs gone too far?
---
This still happens in the g.e. we just dont have to see it anymore. 
---
If you need an item quick, the first thing people do is bump the price so it auto buys. If you need to sell an item quick, bump the price down and undercut the regular price. People make money off this lol.
---
T
---
EXACTLYYYYYY
---
im facepalming reading the original reddit post.
---
Can't wait for the weekly updates on this account, I'm hooked already 
---
You're being downvoted because you're very uninformed, it's not Jagex's job to deal with the Twitch scams, however there was a meeting with Twitch recently that these phishing scams got directly quoted in so in the future yeah Twitch is going to deal with it. (We hope)
---
Lmao that's not dark humor that's just called being a racist
---
2 Years ago. 
---
So nerf Tbow because some people (read: minority) want shitty cosmetic pets that don't affect the game in any way? Lol, good one.
---
The only thing that matters when deciding if something is OP is time/gp/xp.
---
That one I’m actually not 100% sure on. You could try going to the worlds (naked of course) and ask them how to get in the discord etc. to pay. Most people who get in just know someone on the inside, a pvmer or a pker/protector. I’ve never personally done it, just had a friend do it recently and gave me a lot of the info. 
---
Guy In Real Life friend.
---
Oh man, that clip of people alching on the castle wars walls induced serious nostalgia. I had totally forgot that was a thing. 
---
&gt;Am i looking to deep into this? 
---
I wouldn't even say "too deep", you're definitely thinking too hard but tbh it's not even really thinking about the right stuff lol. Probability is a  pretty well established field of math, you can't just come in here with "you will never get a 1/1m drop" cuz ofc you will and it works exactly how it sounds like it should lol. 
---
no idea tbh. when im farming barrows all the elite clues tend to stack with one or two outliers, so it might just be something with the plugin
---
So why didn't he train the account before starting the series?
---
How long did this take
---
I have to disagree because that means you can use the temp ban as a way to get a few days of autoclicking in while not losing the account.
---
Autoclickers are using risk management like any botting player does and it stands to reason that only handing out temp bans for first offense no matter the circumstance is abusable by people.

For people at work copy pasta

Deadman Spring Finals and QoL
---

Graphical Update to Karamja Gloves 
---
The appearance of the Karamja gloves from the Karamja Achievement Diary has been adjusted to match the colours of other diary armours. 
---
Black Knight Kill Score 
---
A Black Knight Kill Score is now tracked in the "Wanted!" quest journal and shown in the POH Achievement gallery. 
---

---
Players may now use Blamish oil on the Pearl fishing rod to allow it to be used for Lava and Infernal eel fishing. 
---
Preserve chatbox open/close state over logout 
---
The chatbox will remember if it was previously closed or opened when logging in and out of the game. 
---
Pure XP Bug
---
At the time of February 21st's update, a bug entered the game where players would receive incorrect combat XP when using specific weapons. As a result, numerous players received unwanted XP in the wrong combat skill. Within an hour of the update going live, this bug was hotfixed. 
---
Later that day, we made a Forum Thread to allow those affected by the bug to enter details of accounts that gained unwanted XP. This forum thread was advertised on social media as well as the in-game broadcast messaging system. The forum thread was left open for a week to allow everyone time to enter in their account information post hotfix. 
---
Over the past couple of weeks numerous departments have been working around the clock to discuss a potential fix, gather display names, investigate the unwanted XP claim, implement a system to rollback the XP, and write up communications regarding the rollback. This has not been a quick process and we would like to take the time to thank you all for your patience regarding the matter. Following the game update and some live testing, if your account met the criteria for a rollback, you will receive an in-game message upon login that will let you know whether your level(s) have been rolled back. 
---
Due to the nature of the rollback, we can only rollback accounts to a set level rather than remove a specific amount of unwanted XP. We cannot rollback quests that have been completed. 
---
The accounts that will receive a rollback met the following criteria:
---
Correctly posted the requested information on the Forum Thread
---
Genuinely received unwanted combat XP as a direct result of the bug/ Attack Style change
---
Did not abuse the XP gain by completing quests they wouldn't normally be able to complete
---
In cases where players had changed their names after requesting an XP rollback via the thread, we've aimed to track down their accounts so as to apply the rollback they wanted. However, if we were not able to identify you, you did not receive a rollback but believe you should, or you did not get a chance to add your name to the forum thread before it closed, we advise you to submit an Account Help Ticket. In the "Other" section, please include information regarding the unwanted XP you gained, what level you need the skill to be reset to, and what type of build the account is. When filling out the form please take note of the criteria listed above to make the process as smooth as possible. The completed claim will then be reviewed by multiple departments for consideration for a potential XP rollback in the next batch. 
---
Rolling back individual accounts is a new process we couldn't perform before that we've worked hard to implement in the live game. As such, we will perform the rollbacks over a period of two days rather than all at once to make sure it works as intended. If you are expecting to be rolled back but are not rolled back right away, please wait for two days before submitting an Account Help Ticket as described above. 
---
Due to the long wait for this rollback, players who will have their unwanted XP removed will receive 21 days of membership as a display of our gratitude towards your patience throughout the process. 
---
Note: The deadline for submitting an Account Help Ticket for the above is 22/04/2019. 
---
We would like to take this time to thank you all again for your continued support and feedback. 
---

Switching between the new tabs for the quest journal, diaries, etc. will no longer interrupt Make-All skilling processes.

How is it racist?
---
Fewer things will pass with polls hidden I think, which would tie developers' hands. Also they could rig important polls they want to pass
---
dems = good, republicans = bad!!!
---
at this point it's borderline insane that they haven't at least tried it out yet, I mean it would certainly be beneficial collecting some data from the polls being hidden and then put the data up against polls not being hidden but idk 
---
if you 3 tick the traps you can get around 30% more xp/h and get profits between 700-800k, but if you dont want to do that you are around the cap :(
---
So removing the space in “Rune Platebody” was a priority but this isn’t? 4Head
---
There's no limitations. Look at the avantoe potion right next to it, it's longer and with a space for "(unf)".

Yeah, but then you're using Safari.

Wow thanks genius. Just got 85 slayer on my new iron btw. You people who immediately condemn someones opinion because they botted are idiots. I wasnt excusing botting, I was just saying its stupid how jagex arbitrarily dishes out different punishments. Like I said, if its his second offense, he deserves it. But if not, why wasn't he been given a second chance like me? Think before you speak. 
---
I mean like this:

lmao i wasted a solid **33** minutes of the same two peoples time legit like an hour before this post. they were salty af cause i kept them creaming for a half hour over my dhcb and rangers on my bait acc. sorry to hear you got done did but it's a cheap cost for a very valuable lesson. 
---
The cape isnt actually that good, it only adds a max hit with very high magic lvl and already good gear.
---
They have stated before that this has always been the case, and it’s not something they can fix. It was just less obvious before.
---
I think the server is down, I don't think its runelite.

I only got it so I wouldn't look like an mtx whale with ancestral

Yep, looks like the server is down.
---
Pretty much what's been said. If you get all your quests done your stats should be pretty solid. I would add diaries to the mix though. Aim for hard completion. 
---
This right here. I can stream a FPS or a MOBA all day long and talk to myself even without a Twitch chat asking questions.
---
Put me in front of OSRS and I look like a brain dead weeb by 4 hours in. I'm having fun but as far as people watching my stream see, it isn't pretty. I said yesterday I looked like someone who watched someone else make oatmeal with water and nothing else after too long of a OSRS session, and I stand by the phrase.
---
Any news on getting signed out on mobile every time you get sent to the login screen?
---
Yeh but if you make that your policy then people will just bot because they know they can get away with it the first time. 
---
Why even comment if you have nothing to add? Just fucking upvote you waste of digital space
---
Ok. I thought I was the only one lol
---
agreed. i want to know if a single person laughed at this post. or the previous 50 posts that are almost the exact same
---
I made noise through my nose
---
It Just stopped working for me mid-game, regular client is working for me
---
all pets can be grinded, drop chance doesn't matter.
---
Now a pet that comes from voting isn't grindable because you need to wait for next vote to be able to get a chance again, what's so hard to understand?
---
Go read definition of grind, it's the same for skills, items or pets
---
Chins are very expensive, yeah, but 800k xp/hr is not a waste of time lol
---
im sure there are ppl staking with level 3 accs
---
We shouldn't introduce legitimate methods of gambling into a game because of people's behavioral issues.
---
I found out what it is. There are two trees to search at the entrance of the tomb i searched both but from my camera angle i could not see the door to inspect it. Also the door despawns quickly. After another 30 mins of backtracking i went back to the tomb from a different angle and saw it.

So I was woodcutting on mobile and I had to tab out. Came back to this glitch, ha. Thought I'd make a game out of it. Can you guess where I am in this image? Not sure if it's too obvious. Winner gets an upvote :P
---
Waterfiends are one of the most uncommon tasks. And suquahs are one of the best for xp.
---
There's no limitations. Look at the avantoe potion right next to it, it's longer and with a space for "(unf)". Actually, there's a few more items in that same image that have longer text.
---
Fuck off retard compost
---
I thought the same thing had to read it properly again 3 times 😂 like duhhh
---
Yes
---
I don't think so, but that wouldn't hurt to add. I don't think those games alone would be random enough and people would probably just use scripts to tell them the best move in stuff like checkers, and connect 4.
---
*guthix
---
what do you mean wooductting isn't variable. I've seen everything from Luffy taking out a warlord to Thanos wiping out half of the universe. Sounds more variable to me!

If you have the twitch app and open with safari it will usually open with the twitch app. I was just trying to help them because it seemed like they didn't know they can watch clips on mobile but I guess you get downvoted for trying to help.

The dutch word for a billion is 'een miljard' which is a thousand million.
---
But the dutch word for a million million is 'biljoen' which kinda sounds like a billion. 
---
So yes in some places a billion is actually a million million. Don't really know for other european countries tho.
---
a lot
---
It really depends what you want to maximize xp, gp, or a balance of both. Also just depends on what tasks you enjoy vs find really boring/annoying. Spiritual creates are definitely a block unless you want to get d boots though.
---
You can join the skilling methods discord (over 11k members) to get specific guides for slayer and every other skill. Shows blocklists, and how to do each task specifically. https://discord.gg/VUwbff 
---
That's the point of limiting it, can even limit the amount of stakes per hour too if that's really a concern. The idea is to give a less harmful outlet than staking and dicing bots.
---
Huh?
---
How is it horrible. $4 an hour for a hobby is reasonable. Usually hobbies provide no income. Relax.
---
&gt;rather dihns

Dihns *is* the meta, you get to use dihns or c Hally depending on what the attack style called is.

Just need a spade full of coke for some stamina
---
Yup
---
You are right, we shouldn't assume anything and the situation could be much more than this tweet makes it seem. I was just trying to say that a lot of times people do get second chances and I just find it odd that jagex arbitrarily hands out different punishments to different people.
---
Can you delete this? 
---
Maybe I just got them more frequently than most. I totally dig the metal dragons tho. I have the extensions purchased. 105 CB 80/75/90. 
---
Suquahs just annoy the shit out of me. Even with a cannon for help they are a huge money and time sink. Maybe I'm lazy, maybe I'm picky. 
---
i noticed that sometimes my camera angle control doesn't work, I think using a fairy ring might be what triggers it
---
That's Wangernum!
---
Because you have the smallest game mode full of people who would actually object to adding the seed vault to it.
---
Anytime a new mechanic can be used by UIM, their tiny community are normally against it as it's against the spirit of the mode (aka NO bank).
---
You've already got Zulrah and vorkath banking lol
---
No, they aren’t.
---
Yes?
---
How is it pronounced
---
no
---
Runescape is basically busywork. Have problems in your life? Well Rs will keep your mind away from them and help you procrastinate your entire life. I guess it's still much better than the alternatives.
---
I was experiencing pretty bag lag on runelite about 5-6 hours ago from the time of me posting this comment. Not sure was the problem is. Mobile seems to be running fine though none the least.
---
Same here, Runescape actually taught me a lot of English, and in good form. That being said, knowing proper English doesn't mean you always use it, because there's no need to in certain situations. For all we know, this "help fish where" guy could be a native speaker that didn't bother to write in formal English and just wanted to get his point across in the easiest manner
---
It's a legitimate training method with bulwark at nechs
---
No, keep trying. Don't give up. I believe in you. Heck work.
---
Without the bottom line, the meme could refer to anything besides RuneScape. Plus just pointing out the location of his sexy time
---
Yup. Sort by new and go back a few posts, a JMod already replied to someone saying they're aware and are looking into it
---
Its also a lorge bone, perhaps +12?
---
But it is, a hobby can produce income, check out IRS pub 525. You make no sense, you’re so caught up on the idea of RWT. I’m saying step back and think, oh shit if I wanted to I could sell this for x. That’s pretty crazy that a game, which is played as a hobby by most, can produce income that substantial. It isn’t like that for many games. 
---
I would go and get 99 fm, cooking and fletching or diaries or quest cape or just get slayer to 90 that's when the money start
---
I can't log on either. Just imagine the treasure trove of randomly spawning twisted bows we are missing...
---
was able to log in on osbuddy after 20 mins trying to log but lag is unbearable. might have to go thorughout my day productively now :O
---
This isn't that type of fantasy game
---
I use an autoclicker for Ark, I'm often afraid that I will forget to disable it when playing runescape and accidentally trigger the detection
---
🦀
---
man, getting 75 def on the pure at 3k xp per hour nearly gave me autism. 99 slayer cb 3 makes me feel ill.
---
Well sure I could also get a t bow and think "hmm I could sell this for 800 dollars" but I don't see how that's crazy in any way considering a t bow takes like 400 hours to get on average for a casual raider.
---
Same here. Tried RL and OSRS client. Lmk if you figure out what's going on. Will give u rune scimmy.
---
Wait, did you just use the combat triangle to prove your point then the combat triangle to disregard his point? 😂
---
D
---
the normal client isnt working either its slow as fuck i guess this update is fucking with shit
---
fuck off brainlet
---
I had to sell some melee gear to keep the tab going. Also a couple of elite / master clues treated me well during the grind. Got a ranger's tunic + ring of nature and some other stuff.
---
Perfect.
---
Amazing, thank you I didn't know that.
---
How is it no longer a hobby? If I paint for a hobby and sell a few pieces of art here and there its still a fucking hobbie what are you doing lmao
---
I just logged in fine thru Runelite 
---
reset the timer? 0 days since last fuckup
---
That's must be one huge monitor :p
---
No sir.

He’s saying maybe OP has additional offenses he has not included on Twitter.

Same here

I got on, we did it Reddit!
---
I just bitched microsoft out so hard thinking it was their fault.

Eh, fuck em. Autoupdate fucks my performance up at the worst times at least twice a month, they can eat a dick.

try it again, just got in
---
Yea man I tell you h'wut that boy ain't right, talkin' 'bout kick sum ass dang ol' boom baby. Just go to G/E tons naked chicks there you go clickclickclickclickclickclick is dang easy man.
---
Right, but say you’re playing some other game and invest the same time, you may get nothing. The demand in osrs is pretty interesting. Maybe not to you, sorry to voice my opinion, soepbord.

True that.
---
But they made it so that the few scumbags who have to ruin it for everyone don't DDOS people doing Bandos and such for their items. Also prevents some sorts of lures from happening.
---
3 claws in 337kc :)
---
Because how is it fun clicking revs for fucking 1000 hours? Did you even read my comment? The entire enjoyment in Runescape for 99% of the people comes from achieving things in game. If you rwt it all you've achieved nothing except a couple months worth of rent you spent a thousand hours on. If you think that's fun then you do you though.
---
You can google or youtube: "Molior RS" or "Building Runescape Project"
---
We have a lot of content on there of a mixture of area showcases, as well as gameplay :)
---
Took a shit break at work and can’t even play. 😂 
---
Of course I vote irl, and I'm going to vote with what I believe is the right choice. Just like in the real world, you do the research, weigh the pros and cons of each choice, then make your decision.
---
I don't wait until election day, see who is winning, then go out and vote for that person. 
---
Servers are having issues, Jagex knows
---
Holy shit 😂 breathe buddy. 
---
I can't connect on mobile only
---
Hop on RS3, they got good coifs for you there.
---
Abyssal demons and cave kraken at level 79 slayer when his goal is to reach 85?
---
He probably got manually reported after it broke, only auto detection will start on old accounts with a temp
---
 Dw, votes are NEVER going to be hidden. It's one of the lowest priorities Jagex has. They only addressed it to try and calm the memes down a bit.
---
Lot's of people including me like the polls visible.
---
[https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Poll:Old\_School\_Polls](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Poll:Old_School_Polls)
---
I imagine even more people would vote "No" to hiding polls now than 2 years ago.
---
Don't let the crybabies on Reddit mislead you into thinking there's a bunch of people wanting polls to be hidden. At this point it's really just memes. 
---
I for one could not be happier by Jagex's decision to not hide the poll results, gives me a chub knowing how many people are so triggered lol. 
---
Is it Thursday yet?
---
If u vote in real life, how are u not aware of all the mental and psychological games thats people play to get you to vote? Thats all people are wanting from jagex. An unbias way of voting.
---
Oh shit lol mb. 
---
I didn’t start playing OSRS until fall 2016. Didn’t know zulrah uniques were that cheap back then LOL
---
set your default world to a usa server, launched fine for me after
---
&gt;say you're playing some other game and invest the same time, you may get nothing
---
Still doesn't make 2 - 4 dollars an hour doing mundane shit "interesting" to me but sure.
---
Also, no need to act so condescending cause I disagree with you.
---
Yeah I mean. Wasn't OSRS supposed to be based on transparency from Jagex? It shouldn't make a difference if you can see the polls or not, vote for what you want. 
---
He streamed again recently and I wouldn’t say he’s *okay* but he seems to be on a somewhat better path assuming he moves away from his girlfriend and leaves her out of his life.
---
what’s a good switch for zulrah then? I was using sara dhide switch. I would prefer not to change 6+ items if I don’t have to really 
---
Weird
---
I honestly need this. I commute to work using the train and often it's so full I have to stand. Playing the game one handed on landscape is tough.
---
Seed vault is only being added becuase they cant add more bank space. Its basically an exstentions of the bank since people store many more seeds than they used to becuase of contracts. 
---
Nah. If they got banned for auto clicking they were probably doing it for hours and hours
---
Well then what is? The marginally better str xp per hour from sand crabs doesn’t outweigh the slayer xp, points and emblems from wildy slayer in my opinion. By the time I’m at a level where I want to slay efficiently, I will already have a slayer helm, slayer rings, superior monsters etc all unlocked through training low level combat. 
---
I’m not saying you’re wrong I’m just curious what you think is better.
---
Chymistry used to let you leech for free.  You could also ask in the wedoraids discord
---
No retard, this is like saying "I'm going to make cake icing from scratch" and then buying an unfrosted cake, while Reddit collectively cuts off their own dicks in unbridled autistic rage because he didn't fuck a chicken to get the eggs to make the cake 
---
I think it is because im sitting at 30m range exp with my melee skills only at 13m
---
Its clearly a troll
---
Weird. I just got in on OSRS client but RL won't even boot up for me.
---
How does he sound any different than anyone else whos been caught botting? Wouldn't they all deserve a perm ban, what are the standards lol
---
Added a sentence and then copy-pasted... lol
---
Yup. He was hedging his bets that if he gets caught, he will just take the perm ban and stop using the program
---
Dude it was a joke, like I could have put “when your hardcore Ironman friend takes 5 steps into the wilderness” as the caption and the joke would be conserved. I just wanted to give it some slightly relatable context. I’m sure if my meme made no sense people would have downvoted it anyway
---
Kinda cool having your question answered in the QNA.
---
You didn’t take your “gf” to Baxtorian Falls? 
---
Fellas 
---
Why not read any of the many many many threads that already address this (for [one example](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9ns34x/can_we_hide_poll_results_before_the_biggest_poll/), here)? For you to even ask this question you'd need to know that there's drama. How can you possibly knows there's drama without also knowing why there's drama?
---
You'd have to read the posts explaining why we need hidden poll results in order to know that we want it. Do you read three words of a post?
---
&gt; Can't you just open the ballot box then immediately click to vote at the top? 
---
Sure, I can. Average person doesn't.
---
&gt; Even if you do scroll down, and the vote isn't going the way you want, you should vote for how you feel 
---
And this is exactly why you shouldn't comment on something you know exactly nothing about. When you don't even know what the word "bias" means, don't make a post about it. Go google cognitive bias for starters and have some fun.
---
Are you playing with 3rd party client or official osrs client ? 
---
But it's already free m8
---
Hail bond buyers 
---
Upvoting in hopes real pk'ing discussion is brought more to the forefront.
---
I don't PK but I'd like more attention given to that side, cause I want there to eventually be a way for idiots like me to take some steps into the scene without feeling like I'm risking my valued items against someone who's been a PK'ing expert for 3 years.
---
Its a copypasta and I didnt see someone else posted it
---
OSRS Mobile isnt too harsh on your battery surprisingly.
---
Were they the same drop rate? Cause 21k rune scims would be Worth absolute bank lol 
---
I love the client it just lets me wc or fish on the bus. Im not gonna lie though putting the choose bank tab right next to the collapse bank tab has led to some salt haha
---
What are all the rewards? Would you say it's worth it?
---
Case sensitive passwords would just give people a false sense of security. Usually people get hacked from phishing links or database leaks and having case sensitive passwords wouldn't protect you from either of them.
---
Yes, and it's better than runescape's default tags (works a bit differently though)
---
There would be a spot on the other side of the bridge
---
“Finally” lol. People go hundreds and hundreds of superiors dry all the time and some don’t even get the gem
---
Maybe sold some of his loot early on to buy it?
---
The point of the changes is to make what you said not true 100% of the time
---
How do you know someone is a bot at sand crabs? All you do is run in a straight line every 10 minutes. 
---
Afaik it's the most impactful tick manipulation in the game. The xp/h pretty much *doubles*, saving an insane amount of time. 
---
So many limitations like what? Just sounds like anyone who unlocked extra stuff expecting a rollback wont get one.
---
&gt;ok ya negative nelly
---
Said the man makes who jokes about a recent mass murder
---
Thanks for posting this, I feel like an idiot but i fell for this, im never on twitch usually but today i was, and after clicking the link and logging in it asked me for my bank pin
---
I thought wow thats weird, i dont even have a pin, so i just filled in i didnt have a pin. after this i was linked to the forums but wasn't logged in. This is where i realised i fell for it. 
---
Right now ive added a PIN, and changed my password to e-mail and my account. Also have an authenticator running. 
---
My question to you is can i do more for security's sake and do you think my account is save? 
---
Thanks again for posting this
---
I do think hiding poll results is a good thing, but what he's saying is completely true.
---
If someone doesn't vote because what they want is losing, that person is an idiot. If players had a spine and actually just voted instead of giving up after roughly 10% of the playerbase votes, this would not be an issue.
---
What is the best place to burst as a pure? 
---
I have already completed monkey madness so can’t do the tunnels there. 
---
I have 75 slayer so should I just do dust devils? 
---
Does anyone have a general idea of how much it would cost to burst from 82-94 at dust devils or other places? 
---
Jagex don’t ban people for using Windows Mouse Keys. The guy who got the fastest 99, using Windows Mouse Keys, so did EVScape when he broke his record. Neither got a ban because it’s not an external program, it comes with Windows PCs.

Any idea what gp/hr was like from 90ish to 99?
---
People have been banned for doubleclick buttons and frictionless scrollwheels, so I would say yes. 
---
Wait what? No they aren’t lol
---
This is why we can’t have nice things. 
---
i want to see the joke.
---
if its at least funny, it gets a pass. tragedy + time = comedy, after all.
---
I was planning to make a post like this with the gui concept etc. It'd be great for skilling. 
---
Except it will still be true. Given the changes in the OP, tell me literally one monster or situation where you'd use one of the new weapons. 
---
True 😋

1k points and a 1 hour raid. Peak autism 
---
Yeah bro that was so early in the morning when I typed it lmao
---
right click the report abuse button to report it ingame
---
Well that's a pretty stupid stance. I support hiding results, but moronic people like you let about 20% of the playerbase decide the future of the game
---
That's true. Bought it for 5.6m and sold for 6.1m though, so a little profit there. About 87m profit is more accurate.
---

Vasa was a struggle
---
Yo can I get you to trim my shit? I can't figure it out
---
too bad you're just a drop in the bucket and whether or not you continue to play is of no consequence to jagex. also you will probably still continue to play. 
---
SNFG (not safe for Guthix)
---
Is not really a big deal. A 5 character password still has 36^5 combos. Case sensitivity would make it 62^5 which is way more possibilities but its still way beyond anything remotely viable for brute forcing. People dont brute force when its 10x easier to social engineer your way into an email acc or thru rs recovery system
---
Yeah but white knight over here thinks that only black people live in bad parts of town, therefore everyone must think that, so you mentioning a bad part of town is racist because of the way he thinks. Makes perfect sense if you're disabled.
---
Theory of runescrap
---
idk there's been tons of database leaks with plaintext passwords exposed. if someone threw those lists into some kind of password cracker and your password had a capital "G" instead of a lowercase "g" obv it wouldn't catch the successful login and wouldn't add your account to the list of cracked accounts. 
---
regardless, i don't understand why they arent case sensitive lol
---
I disagree with the "do it slow and save money one" For example I am currently working on 99 smithing and while I could afford to do gold bars at blast furnace, I am doing addy dart tips because I can easily afk it while doing something else or at work and I am not hemorrhaging money. Going slow and saving money is a very acceptable option if you are not able to spend much time playing the game with full attention on it
---
Ohhhhh okay that makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much 
---
Add me
---
The day mm3 comes out is coincidentally the day i quit osrs 
---
He literally throws his axe at the very start of the fight with Riven.
---
He's using melee to make it an even fight for her, he likes a challenge. That's his literal lore.
---
Did you watch the video? As a Draven main myself for 6 years you've disgraced me. He's not melee.
---
Is the seed vault ever going to come out? I remember a mod posted on Twitter that it was done
---
Sweet
---
He's just stating you cheated. Whether botting or auto clicking. Either client or no client. Your still not doing the work dude, it's all the same shit.
---
How do y'all get 2 alts with mm2 completed?
---
Since when are spirit trees not trees
---
Congrats! 
---
Ign?
---
if u changed ur name during the last month = no rollback
---
if u only gained xp rather than lvls = no rollback
---
ULTRA FUCKING RARE.
---
They didn’t even give us a day or membership back when there was that period of constant disconnections that made the game literally unplayable for many people.
---
I like to think Jagex is learning but I’ve also been hurt so many times. 
---
Is there a good guide to afking NMZ? I tried searching a bit but it seems I need Guthan or to not actually be afk?
---
H-I-T-S. HITS!
---
Speech police
---
Necklace is just more afk because you won't ever have to even think about prayer. No drinking ppots or picking them up
---
I was perma banned for autoclicking around 200 hours of fletching and alching and temp banned for using bot client for 5 hours on another acc.. now I'm clean and i somehow actually learned to apreciate the grinding part of the game cuz i get real feel of accomplishment from it
---
thx mr swampletics
---
tldr... it is not harsh punishment it absolutely depends how much he abused it
---
I will. Just wanted to warn out people to not accidentally do it while having hundreds of law runes in their inventory. Not sure does the bug have something to do with the random event item
---
Amazing change honestly
---
Must trigger you so badly that the polls are not hidden. =)
---
Wouldn't it have taken less time to get some gold and just go to the mage bank in wildy?
---
I know you won't get the RC exp.
---
I've never seen anyone in wildy on my way there (go on worlds with 400 people)
---
I had same problem with runelite, i put fairy ring search off and restarted client, seemed to work. Couldnt write anything in GE search. 
---
That would legitimately be fucking amazing if there was a quest like that. Perhaps the Mos Le'Harmless monkeys want to invade the mainland, since I don't believe that Awowogei has any control over them. 
---
fun fact about kurasks that not everbody knows. SGS spec will still heal and restore prayer against kurasks even though you don't deal damage. The heal is proc'd off of what you "would have hit" not the actual damage dealt. This also means that you can heal say 30 hp on a goblin even though they have 5hp if you rolled a 60
---
almost certain they were? but it was over 2 years ago so I might be misremembering
---
I just want background app refresh for IOS but this would be nice too. 
---
If you want max melee afk and don't care at all about points, just do normal rumble with the 5 easiest melee bosses you have. If you use combats, you'll have to click one every 15 minutes and if you use absorptions only you can click once every 20 minutes. If you have high enough defense, you won't even need to rock cake yourself down, but you can if you'd like.
---
I remember back in 05 when I was a noob my buddy gave me some leather armor he'd made. I put on the coif and immediately dropped it.
---
You got any tips for killing one of each elemental in the Elemental Workshop for the Mandarin Easy diary?
---
I recoiled them, but didn't get credit.
---
Ardy Cloak 1 too lmao. Not going to lie, I sported that too until I had the stats to get better capes. It's just funny seeing the Neitizot, rune platebody/platelegs, climbing boots, Barrows gloves, dscim/ddef, amulet of power, and Ardy Cloak 1 whenever you run around the map. IMO that's the true marker of the early-game ironman.
---
I just did 100 chests over the past few days, my rng was a little better and my total loot was 15.8m
---
DVD clans was a good touch
---
According to the latest news post the rollback will be occurring across the next two days - if it isn't resolved for you within that time the post suggests submitting an account help ticket.
---
Given Jagex's track record as of recent I suspect you'll have to submit a ticket.
---
I mean I'm probably on the worse end of the high level players. I don't have fast clicks and I panic pretty hard when a big team gets on me. Nothing wrong with that, I still have fun playing the game I'm just not great at it.
---
Nope
---
hmm i’ll try that next time. Is range pot worth ? 
---
Idk man, I save spraying out for special occasions man. You cant just go about your day and just decide you're going to expel yourself. It takes time, planning, and dedication. 
---
Why so people keep making "location specific" or "item specific" ultimate ironmans? Like any of us fucking care, even at all. GET A LIFE
---

He's looking to buy a boost through the content, he has no idea what you're talking about lol. And it'd be embarrassing to ask so he'd rather look for what he's actually trying to find. 
---
Lmao spam it in the chat boys 
---
Yeah? It's the wilderness, this is organic gameplay. They aren't abusing any in game mechanics to do so, they just happen to be better at pking than you would be at defending yourself.
---
Definitely

They were back to back

You could have just not wasted your time with this. Sorry but the "ignore" button exists for more than just dice bots.

Yeah ggs and hydra add 8 mill alone

you truly are disgusting, I never talked about time commitment, you talked about unlocking vork and I'm showing I already clearly know and done that. Quit replying to me retard and take your garbage life elsewhere
---
dope ty! i will prob bring a brew just in case in that spot. I’m working on 76 agility too so no more summer pie/agility pot
---
I’d suggest making a pure if you want to learn to pk.  It’ll help you get the timing of when to eat and when to switch to your k0 wep, etc.  
---
Very nice. 
---
Hi,
---
It's been 2 days. Did you die?
---
Same here on the agility. Currently grinding it out and I want to die
---
I believe you, I’m saying the people who don’t vote don’t look at the polls.
---
Although I agree it will definitely help, even marginally. I’m just wondering if the poll booth is the best method
---
Made by u/SrGrafo. He’s the best, you should sub to him. 
---
I'd say getting all pets is more completionist than 200ms
---
You make it work though don’t you, good for you big guy, defying the odds!
---
U JUST WON LOTTERY LOLOLOLOLILOLO IM DRUNK HELP
---
This guy is probably chatting shit and didn't only autoclick
---
Why would you do this to yourself?
---
You mean to tell me you're out here spreading self seed all over the place? That's kinda selfish man. I bet you look at attractive humans while you do it. You guy, you..
---
It would be a great copypasta it really would 
---
I've decided to have Farming as my first 99 so I've been doing farm runs more consistently between Slayer tasks.
---
Careful, this sub loves to defend their love of playing female characters 
---
Ok?
---
what are you quoting? the guy seems to realize he fucked up and deserves a ban, it's pretty uncommon to get a first ban perma (from what i've read) on an account that has a lot of progress, so i don't understand the circlejerk here
---
Ooooh snap!
---
Definitely not worth I just did it cus I like fishing content, the only rewards poles and the fish sack. You can get anglers there but I wouldn't recommend it as I'm sure it would take exponentially longer than trawler

Why? It looks like a pointy M&amp;M

PUT A GORILLA GREEGREE IN HIS ASS
---
Oh no, someone online said I’m disgusting, what ever will I do? I talked about time commitment because you brought up how you said BF is “grueling work” and that it’s dumb to say that. You then proceeded to talk about 700 vork kills as if that’s something to prove you know what grueling work is, or that’s at least how I interpreted it. Maybe when you’re not shit at everything you do in game you should talk about it.
---
Lol you clearly are trolling or have never watched one of his videos and are making accusations on stuff based on literally nothing. 
---
calling someone a retard when you don't even know what the point of an upvote is and instead comment "this". lol
---
IIRC 75 Thieving is also a req for a Western Hard diary task.
---
He’s still doing a series where he plays quests by release order, and can’t do content release after quests he hasn’t completed. The ironman sequel he did to According to Jim he stopped doing. He released an emotional video explains that he made the original series to cope with his depression, and he just was in a better mindset now. He stopped that series.
---
Why are you getting offended over something that has nothing to do with you? It's like being offended by people using the N word when you are not black yourself. (I would say the N word but I dont want to be banned by reddit thought police) 
---
Guess what, if you don't like what someone says, there is an in game button that blocks their messages for that. You do not go virtue signaling on the reddit.
---
There's so much happening here I was actually amazed 
---
At least own up to your racism, coward
---
Going runecrafting eh?

Michael rs his ironman he has been building for years now is the most interesting ironman 10hp build.  Just check out his youtube.

Do experience boosting outfits get kept on death in PvP worlds? Im thinking there'll be fewer people blowing up my monkfish spot but dont want to lose my anglers if i get spanked by some Pker with nothing better to do

KotH/OSRS crossover meme.  OP gets me.

Love the more accurate drop info! One thing I’d also like to see is more accurate drop information on item pages. Often you’ll find an item that is dropped by some monster but it’s not listed on the items page, or you’ll find an item that lists some monsters that drop it but not every monster that drops it. Anyways, great work! 
---
I was not aware that this was a thing. But then again, that's how it should be.
---
That's not the issue. Why do I need to take the time to read something, form an opinion, and then vote if it's already been decided for me? That's the thought behind seeing the results. It's not that people are scared or need something to speak their voice, it's just that they feel like it's pointless and why bother when they just want to play the game. 
---
what about the run energy?

Using clever methods of decision his fire making is level 68.

This is my answer from one of my posts, I have a similar account to you:
---
Bursting dust devils was profit, the item drops paid for my runes and the cash drops were straight profit.  Barraging I was able to break even and sometimes profit slightly.
---
Xp was about 125-135k mage xp/h and 75k hp xp/h
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Runescape memes. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of wilderness mechanics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the pk'ers nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from obsession with spades, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who like pking truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in this memes catchphrase "there should never be more than one dot" which itself is a cryptic reference to runescapes minimap system. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as I don't drop my spade due to only holding three items.  What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
---
Woah brother, "climax". Man, this is wild. You're out here just poppin in DVDs and hitting them pauses on the side boob shots each time you gain a level. I'm talking about the true handshake champ. I bet you could shake a brothas hand for hours if you got the chance.

Meh it's pretty much impossible to get banned from auto clicking unless you're using some generic autoclicker and clicking the same spot for 6 hours with the same interval.

Dude

You can't say for certain that anyone splashing is not using an auto clicker. Auto clickers can be set up to click once every whatever time interval you want.

My inventory (with 80 pray) is bolt switch, rune pouch, super antifire 2 dose (you only need 12 minutes to do 6 kills and it frees up an inventory spot for loot), venom+, bastion pot, 5 pray pots, rest mantas. You can definitely use fewer pray pots if you try, I just leave pray on all the time without exception. 
---
for vanilla client users: just put the xp thing to be visible for 3 seconds, once you cant see it anymore you need to reset.
---
Nowadays even if it doesn’t come with software, you can just download it for free from the manufacturer’s site. I wouldn’t agree with someone that says that downloading an autoclicker client and the Logitech mouse software are equivalent.
---
It's already an option in settings
---
This is truth.  Don't even bother on ones that are already voted yes by the time I login.
---
Thank you so much for this! 
---
you dont have go all the way up, you just need to go about half way to the rope
---
I tried to for scientific purposes, but they had an authenticator. 
---
I think option to choose a build you want to fight with would be ideal. You can then rank up in different builds without having to build 5 accounts.
---
But that is misleading/scamming a player which is against the rules. There is no misleading going on at revs, you pay them or they kill you. If selling protection wasn't allowed, RoT would still own the world, they would just kill everyone not RoT, and have their own people kill the revs skulled. There's no way around this, You can't say that a clan isn't allowed to kill people in the wilderness, that's ridiculous.

I fell for one once. A long-time friend on my friends list who I spoke to semi-regularly messaged me one day saying something about a coming update, said to check it out on the forums and asked to send me the link on skype. Being hyped about the potential update and trusting my old friend, I added him, clicked the link, and logged into not-the-runescape-forums and ended up losing a pair of dragon claws. Whoops.
---
I actually spoke to the phisher afterwards and he said he did the same thing to every friend on all the friendslists he can get access to. He also said my password took him like 4 tries to type right, so I know I had a good password lol.
---
Don't do it on peak times, way too busy and most worlds will be filled with teams that stay forever. If you can only play on peak times, learn how to flick all 3 minions to have long trips. If you can play on off hours it still can be worth it to learn how to flick, although you can get away with only flicking the mage minion. 
---
Personally i didn't use a guide to learn, although have watched quite a few graardor streams in the past so had a general idea already. 
---
This was my setup https://i.imgur.com/ud5MYQq.png . Laws dusts and fire runes in the rune pouch. If you have any other questions feel free to ask. 
---
People started eating at 70 because of the gmaul in the first place though
---
Check the new RuneLite update :)
---
They hated him because he spoke the truth.
---
Yeah, and that's true for a lot of updates that the simple majority wanted, but the supermajority said no to. That's how the OSRS poll system has always worked, so it's irrelevant to state that "it's a majority" like that means anything.
---
am not having this problem, try turning the GPU plugin on or off and messing with the settigns.
---
Providing us with hundreds of thousands of hours of entertainment and new content for a decade old game = "screwing us around"
---
RuneLite should add an option to that virtual levels plugin to stop it from adding to total level.
---
when you repair it cost 150k lol
---
I am so confused why you jumped on this comment thread, you literally have nothing valuable to discuss. He provided what he thought a hobby is while I disagreed and provided legal evidence that what he was stating is false. How hard is that to comprehend and what are you providing other than useless comments. 
---
Wow, typing all of this rather than being on mobile is so much easier. 
---
Don't worry i'm working on it!
---
The question was "Should the results of a poll be concealed until it has ended?". I voted No to that. I don't think they should stay hidden until the polls conclusion.
---
Results should be default hidden. You should be able to hit "view results" to see results prior to voting, and when you finish voting results should be shown automatically.
---
But thats not what was polled a few years ago. 
---
ok
---
Ohh yeaaa. You like that, you fuckin retard?
---
Yeah I know, I believe it's a clan though.
---
Yeah, keep yikesing and complaining on reddit, because in game you can't do anything about it. Hopefully it makes you feel better.
---
This is obviously different. If the pk community wants to grow, they should cater to us to bring us in. We get no reward for doing the activity, why should it cost? Skills offer rewards such and diary, quests, skill cape, and numerous other things. Comments like this are why I don’t want to pk, clearly not a friendly group.
---
This is where the revelation takes place: maybe there's a fundamental problem here? Mhmm, let's think. Slayer means "to kill violently" and it's not recognized as a combat skill? Well Jagex, maybe we can sit down and talk about this one. 
---
Because of this confrontation, slayer should not be recognized as a requirement for skiller max. It's just there to be there.
---
So you basically want to be spoon fed everything? If you don’t have the patience to take 10 mins to research gear/stats you definitely won’t have the patience to put in the all the hours needed to practice and be able to stomach how frustrating it will be to make mistakes and die over and over again. 
---
How do you profit in pvm? Item generation. That is the answer. Most pkers are in it for the money. Its the few who do it for the love of pvp.

What if your buddies can't patrol the worlds 12 hours a day or wouldn't like doing that?

You seem to have a personal issue with me, I'll take that as a compliment.
---
I die 1/5 times a team comes, but I’m 115 cmb with decent stats and a lot of items unlocked. 
---
I mainly bring Dinh’s, rune legs and boots, sometimes torags helm, and pray protect mage and rigour. Bring 6 Sara brews, 3 or 4 restores, and the rest sharks or anglers. Normally I choose a direction to run and just continue and almost always survive unless the team is maxed or there’s 15+ people 
---
&gt;wouldn’t do something with an obvious vulnerability.
---
They definitely do. 
---
&gt;No matter how much people try and get people to understand anti scams aren’t real people just won’t listen.
---
You absolutely can antiscam, provided you have knowledge of the scam and fake antiscam and know what you're doing. Would recommend against trying if you don't. 
---
The old anti-scam in pvp world has the largest vulnerability and allows you to get a free ZGS and possibly a spectral although very unlikely to get the spectral (although recently they started doing it with ancestral hats instead of zgs's and rapier instead of spectrals for some reason). As long as you stop after the "free" item and never bring your items into the pvp world, you've successfully anti scammed and can't get scammed.
---
People still fall for it, despite it being the most obvious thing and easiest thing in the world to antiscam. 
---
Do high scores still not update until you logout? If so, that’s most likely the case here and he rushed 60 attack via quests and training. 
---
I think companies should allow 15 minute work breaks to watch Swampletics as observation of religious practice 
---
Dude the Knight freezing and then a clan logging in is the worst. The timing is always perfect hahaha. SOMETIMES I can get south from those massive clans if they splash the tb. It's honestly a 50/50 shot for me. God I love the rev caves its hilarious.
---
Ill give you 1m if you can cite more than one source that proves im wrong
---
Venezuelans hate him!
---
Clapping 5-10 member group isn't something hard to do. Why do you think any clan cares about their pride?
---
The logic still applies. U cant kill on obby maulers because u just eat at 40-50hp depending on max. So no obby maulers wouldnt become more relevant. There would be more simply because removing one option out 5 makes you pick one of the other 4, but they wont become better. 
---
Hey let’s give everyone who breaks the law a lethal injection. Even for speeding. What? That sounds extreme to you? jUsT doNt bReAk ThE lAW.

Just cause you are consciously breaking the rules doesn’t mean you deserve the harshest punishment imaginable.

actually i have before and can confirm its only placebo. you need to covert it to freebase form (aka turn it into crack) if u actually want to get effects from smoking it. otherwise ur just wasting ur yay brotha

yea, at 15 characters there are 10^23 combos lowercase, 10^26 combos uppercase. If people are upset about this, just tack on two more characters to your length and youre back to 10^26

I can't see it... 
---
What is the gp/xp rate with barraging is you don’t get def as well?
---
Ya I'm a little fuzzy on memory but that's basically what the video did, barrages and bursts are so expensive that the extra DPS from vestment over pros makes you save money and time. Ancestral is obviously better than both though.
---
I lost over 10m learning how to pk, I’ve made well over 300m from pking after learning. You could reduce cost of learning by practicing with people in duel arena. PvP isn’t for everyone, it’s rng based and there’s a decent number of people using third party scripts to weapon swap spec/pray swap/triple eat which seems unappealing but you can identify those players and just not fight them (aka avoid risk fighters). 
---
Total level does not equate to higher skill, i'm not sure how you come close to a conclusion like that. It simply means you dumped more time into the game and its not necessarily dumped into pvp.
---
Awesome account dude!
---
does it really matter for a 26 second video...?
---
P.S if the community absolutely believes there should not be a skiller max cape, give us something.  Bout to get assertive. These lvl 3EHP hours I put in are real. I do not engage in combat because it's against my religion. We're established and are a force to be reckoned with. 
---
My last note friends: it boggles my mind how skilling is the heart of Runescape and non combat skillers are not recognized. Think of OSRS as another world, a different reality. One with law and principle. In this world, you can be "fully accomplished" without indulging in the act of violence.

Cheers

Lots of people here have a personal issue with you based on your comment history, and no, you should not take that as a compliment, unless you think the majority of people you encounter not liking you is something to be proud about I guess.
---
I do not have that.where can I find it?
---
And I get that it’s risk vs reward, but you won’t gain my interest this way, when I could go kill zulrah or raid for guaranteed money that I know. This is just a way that would entice me to pking. I don’t understand why people are demanding it cost though, why does learning a skill demand investment? It’s why I’ll never pk.

Nah thankfully I'm a main. Pretty much did this boss for money and I obviously still made huge gains

Very well thought out, and well said.

Thanks, I had not realized this.  The latest stance from Jagex that I had read on RS forums was that they were not rolling back due to this issue.  Per the latest news post, I've opened an account support ticket and hopefully will get this issue resolved.

Cool.

Veos' dock was there for a short while before being moved elsewhere, you logged off on the dock while it was still there, and so you are still there upon logging back in.

Can you use the lumby home tele?
---
I've made pretty much every type of PvP build you can imagine + 10 more you can't imagine.
---
You logged out on Veos old dock, they moved it. Just home tele
---
I've done it at work once, too. Luckily though, if I bother to go in to the office, I'm the only one in the building for most of my shift. I went to the bathroom and washed my underwear in the sink, then free balled it in jeans while they dried out on my desk. Kinda sucked, but could have been much worse.

Hey Gambit, was just wondering whether all the rollbacks have gone live already or if there are still some accounts not looked at yet. As you've probably guessed, no work has been done on my account yet so getting a bit worried.

Thanks man.

One thing you can do immediately to find out if it is a Phone-wide problem is enable Developer mode. Go to Settings--&gt;About Phone Tap the 'Build Number' ~10 times until you see a popup enabling Developer mode. 
---
Go back to Settings--&gt;Developer options. Enable "Show touches" and "Show pointer location" under Input.
---
Now make sure out of OSRS Mobile, that the location/touches match up.

Oh awesome I’ll definitely check this out thanks

Also, don't forget that Vorkath is instanced, so if you drop the food (instead of eating it when you don't need to) it'll stick around for 30(?) minutes or so, in case you end up needing it before the trip is up

Yeah, it would be ideal if the password policy was more complex. It wouldn't drastically change the amount of people getting hacked though. Phishing scams are how people are getting compromised.

it has all the makings of a scam, with the only difference being instead of trusting some random guy you're trusting a clan notorious for dishonesty

If the portal chamber/nexus had the more than 3 locations unlocked, I would agree with you. But we don't have access to the rest of the teleports, while we do have tabs for the missing teleports on the Ancient and Arceuus spellbooks.

they think that just because rs3 is ez scape and everything is afkable now that this is what the rs3 players want

People are toxic because they are there to play the minigame, not to have someone leave in the middle of the game, wasting their time. I agree BA is annoying in that aspect, but you offered no solutions or suggestions, and just made yourself look like a hypocrite. You said "I wouldn't wanna spend more time than I need to", taking full advantage of the problem you were complaining about in the first place. Your opinion changed from "BA is a problem" to "people in BA are toxic and I just wanna leave whenever". An easy solution is to just not let people leave during a random wave, but theres probably a reason why this wasnt implemented.

did you check and see if his gmail account has the same pw, for research of course.

&gt;Can we add things completely unrelated to runescape like blackjack and craps so people who want to gamble can?

There are plenty of online casino games for your addicted friend to play. No need to put every random thing into the game that doesn't fit at all.
---
yepp recently it has.  All I can think about at work is osrs, I google stuff, make lists to do when I get home.  When I get home, I play until I go to sleep and have been staying up too late to play.

I really need to balance it out.  Ive only been back 2 weeks though

If it counts down to the millisecond, no human can get a perfectly identical interval repeatedly. A human will probably end up with some early/late click pattern distribution that is different from what software gives using a random function.

I was thinking about my combat stats, and realized that my prayer is significantly lower than my other skills. I pretty much trained my prayer up early on to unlock overheads and have since been ignoring it. I have the money to train it up to 70 for peity, but would the dps increase be worth it over, say, more gear upgrades? Ive been doing a lot of wildy slayer, and i normally one tick flick, since i have to pay attention to the minimap at all times anyway.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

You can set up "Automator" to record various actions that you perform, known as workflows. I suppose you could get it to record a series of clicks of you performing the action (fishing and dropping for instance), then 'play' the workflow and repeat it.

Im pretty sure my friends think I must bot because I've almost gotten my second 99 Slayer. They've never outright tried to accuse me, but they pretty frequently make comments about how they just don't understand how I can play so much, etc.

2 of them have gotten banned for macroing themselves. I'm pretty sure since they think I'm botting that it must be somewhat easy to get away with and that they could bot their accounts. Nope.

If he uses his main for one aspect, then why wouldn't he use it for others? Use his main to lure, etc. Even though it may be pvp only progression, that progression has been affected by his main and can be again in the future

I think you are being a bit of an ass for like no reason dude.  Some kind of achievement for Skillers who max their build would be interesting and it seems like besides pissing you off it wouldn't really affect you.

I find that they will commonly justify botting as, 'oh it's only a few hours, I can't get banned' and I'm like yeah, definitely not.

Go ahead and try to pk with 1 strength then. Honestly to me the stats are a part of completing his goal from "scratch" so to me it's disingenuous but I can see why some people wouldn't care if it's for the gear, but the stats certainly help him achieve that goal so I can't get behind it
---
Take a month off and you may just lose interest in the game entirely. I can’t even log into my account for more than 5 minutes without being bored out of my mind after taking a long break.

But I do know the 8-16hr daily grinds. Consistent play gets addicting. Just take a break and you may lose the flame. Focus on your kids.

you bragged about playing an uncompetitive pvp bracket unironically and wondering why im making fun of you. 
---
That's ironic because in runescape skilling is all about afk methods so you don't actually have to play the game, you should tell them to stop playing too then.
---
It doesn't bother me that people want to train all skills except combat. Go nuts. I'm not upset by any of this. It's just pointless to cater content to a very small subset of players with niche accounts.
---
feels good when you complete it tho
---
Don't encourage the RL developers. I wish jagex had shut Runelite down. It is a blatant cheat client and provides unfair advantage in the game.

I will be starting a petition to shut down RL once and for all.

NMZ isn't better for exp than ammonite, it's better for AFK.

Compare moving out of the screen and coming back every 15 mins vs a single click on anything every 15 mins.
---
With base 70 combat stats I can earn as much points as I spend, a little bit more even. If you're not making enough points the problem isn't your attack, it's your defense. The more the mobs miss you the less absorb pots you need, that's why you need all the easiest bosses, not just fairly easy bosses.
---
Yes it would because it's clearly not something you are supposed to be able to do in game.  
---
Shouldn't base your play style on others aswell mate, like the previous posts say the hours you could spend grinding isn't worth missing your family time. Play when you can.

It's a trap!

Hasn't always been the case. Maybe I'll stop yawning and begin to actually care about your replies.

holy nugget you did it

Exactly this, this game is always pulling me towards it so i dont need to pay for my membership (i want to do it with bonds). I cant do a commitment do bosses since i have to put the phone down every 5 minutes or whatever. I try to reduce my playtime but then i see my membership going away and it feels like a waste. I spend allot of time with my family and feel great. So family goes always first.
---
You don’t lol unless you get lucky on here or tweet 
---
Justiciar will help you more when you make mistakes, but id recommend at least trying to learn the mechanics while using it, if you decide you want to really use it. However, id say stick with ancestral or ahrims and keep trying, the more attempts you do the better you will get. Its definitely frustrating while youre learning, but i promise itll make you a better overall pvmer.

Getting a kill in the wilderness is easy, killing experienced brids is not.  Even in PvP worlds there’s a really low skill entry, tons of noobs.

Don’t expect to go into the wilderness and be able to take on experienced mains. That’s like expecting to be able to take on zuk without any prior PvM knowledge.

I use an autoclicker for another game (clicker heroes) and sometimes I accidentally forget to turn it off before clicking on osrs to do some afk xp and the clicking goes mental on my screen. I know they can recognise an autoclicker, I just hope they can differentiate between me using it on purpose on osrs or by accident and quickly turning it off
---
Default /r/slayerscape answer: just do slayer from the minute you hit lumbridge and don't do any other skills til skayer is maxed

Actual best answer: dont do slayer till around 85 att/str, 70 mage with ancients, 75 range with blowpipe, enough money to fund pots/pipe/burst, 70 def/pray for piety

"we had to suffer so you do too" is always a good argument for keeping things needlessly difficult /s
---
The overly steep learning curve is one of the main reasons average players don't PvP, and OPs suggestion (which has been brought up multiple times on this sub by non pvpers) helps with that by simply pairing you vs people of a similar skill level. It does nothing to make the game itself easier, and in the wildy and presumably at high ranks in the arena, players with earned higher skill will still kill noobs just as easily. 
---
I swear half the reason pkers are so against change is that they'd rather kill noobs for 100k and feel good about it than have a growing competitive community of players that have learned to actually fight back
---
Any instance where someone is insulting another's intelligence while not knowing the difference between your and you're, their argument is immediately invalidated. Yes.

Glad you understand. Have a nice one.

Eh, just your attitude. You're not an elitist prick because you're an intermediate programmer. You're an elitist pick because you're an elitist prick acting like this information is exclusive to you in this conversation.

There isn't really an explicit order but there are some things to consider. 
---
After you have the stats for infernal axe, you should do wc to 98 with around 500k exp left before doing 99 fm (cuz your fm will be higher from burning logs with axe), also save around 200k exp from 99 construction. This all assumes you're doing todt, if you're not then ignore this part 
---
You should similarly do 99 mining with infernal pick before 99 smithing, if you're willing to throw the money at that. 
---
You should get 99 fish at barb before agility 
---
You probably wanna get 99 craft comparatively early for the bank tele
---
Autumn elegy also has a "rough guide to maxing" if you wanna look that up, he has some more things to consider

Always tried to get at least 200k. My best day was about 500k xp which was around 10 hours.

"Hard mode doubles the hitpoints, attack, strength, magic, and ranged levels of the bosses where applicable. Their defensive stats remain unchanged"
---
Word of advice, it's perfectly fine to spend all your video game/solo time on one game, but it isn't a good idea to start giving up social/exercise/professional time to make more solo time for rs. Make sure rs is something you do when you have time, not something you actively make time for.

BAFTA DOESNT SHOW POLL RESULTS

---
Great job again Jagex!
---
As someone with 94 smithing who has wasted countless hours into the skill I don't agree, and the data that shows amount of 99s similarly correlates with that as it's on the bottom of the ladder. If there was no issue with smithing it wouldn't have been reworked in RS3. The issue with smithing was that it filled in the gaps during a time when runite was the highest tier of equipment. Aside from goldsmithing gauntlets and Blast Furnace, it has literally not been touched since and you are saying there is no issue with that in spite of hundreds of new items and gear being introduced over the years? 
---
With some one off exceptions, the only profitable items to smith by a large margin are darts and on some days bolts. High alch is decent profit with Steel Platebodies and beyond, but no one does that for making money do they? That's the same as any other resource you would gather yourself, it's obvious you are going to make a profit, that doesn't mean it's a good method compared to the amount of time and investment it requires. 
---
People don't get 99 smithing because they want to make rune platebodies and alch them lol. They get 99 because they just want to max the skill. 
---
About to start this grind myself from 90. Thanks for the info!

Wear a boater.. zero benefit, but looks a million dollars :)

Yeah I'd say it's best to show the results only after you've voted to keep the votes from influencing or otherwise discouraging you from voting all together. I never read the results prior to voting, but it's hard to not see those large boxes being green or not or at least for the first couple questions.

After the poll has ended the results could be published like they normally would. There will ofcourse be those who publish these numbers online for everyone to see perhaps even before you could vote, but you'd have to go out of your way to see them.

OP probably Either:
---
-Has the agility level for the 89 agil shortcut at 29 wildy.
---
-Pays a clan for protection.
---
I know, but this is old school. And people are afraid of a little change. At least thats what it seems.
---
You can boost with stews though
---
If you have no taste, sure. It looks way too cartoony, everything looks like a toy.
---
Didn't they poll integrity issues in the past, such as indefinite splashing, and still go through with the change anyway under the argument of integrity?
---
All good points. But though op doesn't seem interested in improving that much, a ladder system will get a lot of people to try to improve since they can actually see/track/show off their improvement, which would be good for both high skill and more casual players. If it was suddenly implemented I would love to join in and set a goal as the next best cape (or w/e), then the cape after that. It's a lot easier mentally to go from rank to rank rather than just dive into the wildy and see how quickly you die, until you can do it and only die sometimes. 
---
And I definitely get that money isn't the reason people pk, but it is a big reason people don't. It's a nice bonus and can get you some good gp if you do get lucky, but while you're learning it'll be a (potentially big) net loss.
---
Tourny worlds help with that, but it's not our actual accounts, and your account basically gets nothing out of it.
---
and current OSRS doesn't? lmaoooo 
---
No thanks. 
---
If you have the cash bursting will be the quickest way yeah, I think the zombie monkey burst spot is in MM2 you don't have to complete the quest only get up to the agility course part
---
Can I solo Zilyana with 95 ranged and 88 def? I was all set to practice it safely on the unrestricted worlds but they've closed and I'm kind of psyching myself out on the solo idea now
---
100k xp/hr is if you're maxed combat w/ full dharoks, torture, ferocious gloves, infernal cape, etc. and going for 200m xp
---
if it makes you feel better your roll would probably have been different than his.
---
Well since no one else is going to say it..
---
700 hours? Filthy casual.
---
Yes they do. It is literally a fucking scientific study. Knowing the outcome influences you to not vote. Im on a PC now so ill get the excerpt for you myself. You seem stuck up on the idea though of "forced not to" and "influenced not to". You seem think if something is just influencing you to not vote its your fault for not voting. And technically you aren't wrong but you should realize that isnt the fucking debate or point. The point is, in a fair election or poll you want the least influence possible towards any result to get the fairest result. You dont give a shit if the voter COULD have found a way to vote. You are supposed to WANT them to vote. So you make it as easy for them to vote as possible, and influence their decision as little as possible. It is jagex's responsibility to encourage voting and making polls fair because they are the ones running the polls.   
---
Excerpt:  
---
" "We take advantage of a unique natural experiment from 2005, in which French citizens from overseas territories to the west of mainland France began for the first time to vote without knowing the choices made by mainland voters. We find that knowing the outcome of early voting decreases turnout by about 12 percentage points in our preferred specification. We also find empirical support for bandwagon voting in which later voters, if they participate, are more likely to vote for the expected winner." "

Depends on how long the sample is, I imagine. Or perhaps even other stuff they track with it. Is it just seeing if you repeat a sequence x number of times in y minutes? Or is it x account repeatedly trains y skill for exactly z minutes before idling and logging off? Who knows, there's been zero jmod talk about this for an obvious reason. 
---
Dare I say, I'd pay $12 for this
---
Just seconding that you don't want fighter torso for barrows. I used the granite body prior to barrows armor.
---
I agree

I feel you dude, Took me a minute for that KQ kill with my shit stats.
---
Is he really one of the only? Most top hcim streamers do risky bosses really. 
---
These niggas complainin cause they got Great Value coifs. I only fuck with Aquaberry Versace Coifs. 
---
That genuine enthusiasm is what makes it for me, he's not pumping out slightly over 10 minute videos daily just to pay the bills - he's sharing something he's passionate about.
---
that's true and no one wants to take their old school away =) I was just hoping that someone could make a 3rd party client with HD as a toggle &amp; other options
---
I think jagex said it wasnt happening due to the amount of work it would take to convert everything in the game to the hd graphics.
---
It would hurt the game in a significant way, dev time.
---
That’s exactly my point. Why does every pet need to have an army of rainbow recolors? 
---
Throw some gp my way king
---
Oh ya make that pussy coif for me baby 
---
I’ve always wanted a toggleable HD option. I miss 2008 scape 
---
Gettin way to many rs3 vibes from it. I personally like the osrs graphics style a lot better than this hd stuff, specially places like mt. Karuulm.
---
yeah you'll be fine
---
oh my GOD ... HOW DOES OSRS LOOK THEN??????? REALISTIC???????????? 
---
Dude fuck off.. I was just trying to be funny. Also there’s a decent chance I’m older than you. 
---
Never heard of anyone getting banned for runelite, so unless you’re using something else idk
---
this also works at pest control when the brawler blocks all the spawns into one square. you hit all of them, there doesn't seem to be a target limit.
---
You can actually re-sell Graceful pieces for a few Marks of Grace and then buy Amylase Crystals to sell for gold. 
---
Just clicked my rock cake after using overload for some reason. You can imagine what happened next. 
---
Make sure you poison each healer at least once right as they spawn. During the later waves you can kill the healers with only 2-3 poisons if they are spread out rather then focusing on one at a time. If you need help send me a message on here and I'll give you a hand. Im level 5 all roles and can generally solo attack or heal to help you out. 
---
Tag healers at the beginning and then focus on healing for a while. Slow is better than a fail.
---
Once you level to 3 or 4 your heals will go a lot further and it will be less of an issue. 
---
Haha it's just blanket filtered by "Gaming"
---
I’d vote for this in a QoL poll if it was toggle optional 
---
fuck off back to rs3 faggot
---
You aren't being truthful or forgot your pin since there is no way to get around the delay
---
No but it's the original look. There's no point changing the nostalgic look that everyone's attached to for ANOTHER shitty aesthetic. I don't need to make an argument for OSRS's aesthetic because that's the default, you're the one wanting change so the onus is on you to prove that this look is worth adding.
---
I still don't understand the hype behind it at all.  Watched a few episodes when I had literally nothing else to do and didn't think it was anything special.  Maybe a lot of people are just that bored I guess
---
They recently decided to not do something that was polled in regards to sand because they thought it would mess with the game's integrity, so that precedent's already been set.
---
He rwt so he deserves it 
---
There is not a single video game on earth from any generation that looks as bad as this. God awful. So glad I never played and it will never come back. Truly disgusting
---
“It’s DVS, mothafucka.” 
---
I am not expecting this from Jagex but from a talented coder who could make a 3rd party client similar to OSHD AND share the code with jagex so they can approve :)
---
Absolute chad pking all of the virgins 
---
And make it require dragon slayer.

Honestly, if there's one massive villain that hasn't been revealed yet, I'd put my gold on Sir Tiffy.  That dude's fishy as fuck.

Thnx Virgin

Then he will have it delivered in 3-5 years depending on the customer service.

id pay $20, gladly
---
Why didnt you just buy it at the GE? After 3210 Graardor KC you would have for atleast 5 bcps
---
Level up Healer. It makes a huge difference in the later waves
---
Nah no way. I'm not willing to believe that. 
---
same! =D
---
Yeah I've got a set for my rune drag alt and it is fuego haha
---
Thats not the game, it would not hurt the game in a significant way, right now with all the concerns of the osrs community, its not something that needs to be done, but in the future the dev team is growing and dev time wouldn't be a problem.
---
What strategy do you use for this? I feel like you still need to concentrate/use a laptop to make this work.
---
So your bank pin magically changed in less than 24 hours?

Hi my name is depressionletics, my serotonin locked Ironman. After recently maxing settleds videos I look forward to the next biggest challenge, another day without serotonin release.

He was botting agility so I think what happened is he died with it and didnt care to pick it up. Or he was just a dick and did it for fun. Or both
---
its k, i gave them my dead one from nearly 6 years ago, its all my google account remembers
---
False, rigour piety and augury give normal defense which helps against all attack styles but augury also gives extra magic defense.
---
This. I feel like there more people complaining without there actually being an issue!
---
I already get like 19fps with graphics set to low on runelite. I’m str8 m8.
---
What in tarnation did you do to post 3 times
---
Maybe not a entire graphic rework, but fixing and tidying things up, like the torags platebody makes you look Bloated. 
---
and that's TOTALLY fine =), there's just SO many of us who still prefer HD as it was back in 2008, and there's even a petition somewhere with over 12k+ votes
---
Any dev time spent on this is dev time that could be spent on something else. Adding more devs does not change this fact. 
---
110% way too many worlds. But with the amount of people currently coming into the game i wonder how they can deal with the potential lag issues.
---
Ahahaha wifi shit out
---
still not out :O
---
Hey, I like this. For people that probably won't read the entire thing (if the post gets some traction), is this game-mode comparable to anything else?
---
It feels like a great way for the entire community to interact, both high-levels and low. Its always felt like osrs has had a divide between these communities.
---
I think you're being overly negative for no reason. This update would have no negative effects on anything real and would just increase weapon diversity for lower leveled accounts. Low level monsters have super low defence and lower level players have super low attack and accuracy values on weapons. I haven't looked through the list of popular monsters to kill on f2p or low level p2p but I doubt you have either. The thing is even if there aren't any monsters where the style difference would matter, an update like this would still benefit people.

We are saying hiding poll votes will change the overall result. The counter-argument is "it already failed a poll" but this is wrong, cyclical logic. It failed a poll that is fundamentally flawed because it shows the polls individual votes. So after-all they haven't proven anything. This is simply their initial, control, experiment; where no changes have been made. If they want to find the difference between hiding it and not hiding it, they need to do another experiment (poll) and make a single change to one factor (hiding the votes)and note the differences. Hide the poll results and let us vote whether future poll results should be hidden as well. I guarantee it would pass. 
---
Iirc, they don't care if it's their fault. You should know they made a mistake and it's your fault for taking advantage of it. Just like with the tbow spawn.
---
Oh man I miss the old demons so much. I'm with you on that.

Yeah. I love the look of rs3, I'm just not a fan of how they made it easyscape and added shitty content.

[What'r ya lookin' at my gut fer?](https://i.redd.it/wdrbw19x8oi11.jpg)
---
Not sure where you’d get the idea... Their role is literally unpaid moderation of players — hence the term, player moderator. Literally Jagex’s statement regarding PMods is that they are in place to moderate and encourage the community to participate and play in accordance with Jagex’s rules. 
---
They are the informal police force of OSRS — where they wield the authority to priority report and mute players at their will. Jagex treats them as an extension of themselves, while simultaneously granting them nothing more than the silver crown, the ability to mute, and *no management or moderation of them, whatsoever*. They’re unleashed like a wild pack of dogs to use, what’s basically their new muting power. And boy, are they not afraid to abuse it.
---
Countless, and I mean countless threads on Reddit and the official forums detail some players’ experiences where they were muted by a PMod for nothing. No explanation. No rules broken. Nothing nasty said. Chat logs to back it up, that most the time, these PMods just mute anyone and everyone they feel like.
---
If they muted people for breaking the rules, fine. If they played their part, for even a few minutes everyday (what’s reported to be up to 1600 individual player moderators), we would not see spamming bots *EVERYWHERE, AT ALL TIMES*. 
---
These PMods can’t be bothered to mute spamming bots who singlehandedly break 2-3 rules every 5-10 seconds, every single day of the week, and yet, there are horror stories of people saying hi or taking about their experiences in-game, in a clan chat, and they get muted so the PMod can have a discussion in the clan with his friends or other high ranking members and laugh at his victim(s)? 
---
It’s honestly pathetic. I’ve been muted for no reason by a PMod before, and it obviously sucks when all I wanted to do was join a discussion with friends in a full clan chat, only to find a PMod hiding in the ranks didn’t like “noobs” talking a lot, so a few of us got muted straight up. No warning. No statement of broken rules. Just a few hour mute or whatever it was. 
---
So you know what? Yeah, I envy PMods for the power they have over me, for no reason at all. PMods need to be managed by 1-2 JMods, who can review each mute, and who can determine who’s using their powers for good — and who’s abusing their powers for their own personal gain. Otherwise, it’s a lawless wasteland of PMods standing above other players and taking a shit on them whenever they feel like it. 
---
Once I start seeing PMods get reprimanded for being assholes and losing their status as moderators, then I will be content. Otherwise, I’m not confident putting a whole new bunch of kids — who literally fantasize about having a silver crown next to their name, in a position of power is a good idea. 
---
All I really want, is PMods who actually care about the game and the environment that Jagex has set to create, and JMods who actually and actively manage them. 
---
Well, come with a better solution then for the problem I am trying to solve. For example competetive minigames: in whole osrs there has only been one update like this LMS. And let's be honest, it wasn't a great update. Very poorly coded and it has no incentive to play: no real rewards and it requires 24-48 people to start a game. Why? because they rush updates that are not the priority of the majority people.  
---
Then take a look at the countless pvm updates that have happened.
---
Just googled it, and 01-09 seems to be the most common practice. Most common implies that it's not the only one, so perhaps your teacher was taught different.
---
It’s a cool idea and I like it, but didn’t this subreddit just petition for no new content and a heavy focus on existing content fixes and QoL?
---
Good one!
---
Oh god, would look like some kind of clay animation

If you are going to solo heal waves 9 and 10 you need to be Level 5. You also need teammates who have decent defense and HP. Whenever you're on wave 10 you need to make sure all your teammates besides collector are close to the healing pool. Whoever is handling eggs can run off and do their part but they should return to the pool once they are done so you can heal easier. 
---
Also on wave 9 if you are solo healing you should always be the last person to finish. If you aren't last your teammates are doing something wrong. Once all of your team finishes your collector should be changing eggs to red or green so that your teammates can shoot the healers while you try to finish them off.
---
Healer is definitely the hardest and most click intensive role. Good on you for learning. Once you reach level 5 you should think about joining the Casual BA clan chat.
---
I'm disinclined to believe the words of anyone who uses a throwaway reddit account (as your username suggests) to comment on a game they play. But go do your fact checking. New graphics had no significant decrease in playerbase, removal of free trade did. You, like so many others on this subreddit, blanket the entire community as sharing your *opinion* when in reality, it's just that. *Your opinion.* 
---
I'd vote no even if it was optional.
---
I can’t stand you fucks who don’t want this it’s an OPTION it’s not like it’s gonna ruin ur experience at all if anything ur ruining other people’s experience who have been dying to use 2008-2010 graphics for a lot of people including myself that’s when we first started playing rs. Please, jagex add or allow someone to make OSHD it would enhance gameplay for a lot of people.  The graphics look so much smoother and cleaner. 
---
&gt;	yeah and cheating in a video game is pretty severe and should be punished as severely as possibl
---
Do you realize how general this is. Cheating can entail exploits, hacking, autoclicking, and a myriad of other things. In some games even account sharing is cheating. However do most games give a perma ban for every form of cheating? Fuck no because it’s excessive and just tells the players “if you’re going to cheat make sure you do the worst cheating you can because you’re getting a perma regardless.
---
Your pubg analogy is garbage and no it doesn’t make perfect sense. You’re trying to shove me in a category box of “cheat supporter” and assuming I think no cheater deserves a perma ban. If you autoclick one time that isn’t the same as using aimbot for hundreds of games. Once again severity of action. A person who aimbots for hundreds of games has done enough damage and deserves a severe punishment. Someone who autoclicked for 5minutes? Please, fucking spare me the ideology.
---
If you seriously still don’t get how I’m not comparing a lethal injection to a perma ban you’re just trolling or retarded. The only one who needs mental help is you dude. Or at least some critical thinking lessons. Cause it seems once you get an idea in your head you get obsessed with it and can’t have a reasonable discussion. Anyways, it’s impossible to explain shit to someone like that so I’m done after this. I’ll leave off saying I’ve never cheated, never been banned, nothing. But I’m not stupid enough to think someone who autoclicks for a day somehow ruined my experience of the game.

Obviously they can do anything else, I dont mean just oshd, I literally mean anything else no matter the project, with more devs allows more flexibility to tackle bigger projects while other devs are working on other things.

How does having extra information on screen remove yourself from playing the game?

In perfect balance, like all things should be.

Adding these graphics as an option would take an unimaginable amount of dev time. Not only for the current content but also every future content would require twice the art time and double the QA time.

I want this so much.

I tend to play female characters in most RPGs. RuneScape is one of the few games where I _don't._ I used to, and my RS3 character (the one I have about two hours or so in) is female, but my OSRS character is male.
---
You did nothing wrong
---
&gt;However it doesn’t hold up because jmods are already in full control of the polls. They can commit fraud already. The current polling system is the equivalent of if a presidential candidate was the one to count the votes for an election. Showing the results does nothing to stop someone from committing fraud in that scenario.
---
This is not true though. The argument you're making is "since fraud *could* happen anyway we might as well remove any chance we have of catching fraud". Which i absolutely disagree with: they may be able to commit fraud now and get away with it, but i sincerely doubt it based on the fact we can watch the results change as time goes on. We at least have a chance to examine the results as they occur right now, there is a possibility of catching fraud if it happens. If we give that up, that chance goes to 0, and we are forced to just trust it's not happening.
---
&gt;The study is true for any scenario where one person faces results with a large volume. That’s our polling system problem too. Even with only 12% voter turnout, that’s enough people that if a vote is already at 80% you aren’t going to feel like your vote matters which causes people to not vote as shown in the study.
---
If this is true then prove it, because the study you posted is in fact not supporting this. It supports the idea that if voters know an election has been decided already that they have no motivation to vote, which is a no brainer, of course they don't and i'm not even sure why we need a study to prove that or why it's a problem given that their vote literally does not matter in that scenario.
---
In our scenario the 88% choosing to not vote does in fact matter, and i still submit that the bigger problem is a lack of motivation to vote / general disinterest in voting is the actual root cause of this.

I don't like all the bloom tbh.

There is no incentive for pkers to go into wilderness just to find other pkers. I hopped 30 times at west dragons and didn't see a single pker. I think there should be some sort of bh type system for the wilderness on all worlds. Maybe an item that you take that indicates you want to fight and it matches you with other people who have one. A bit like bh, except you have to opt in. Rewards would need to exist for it but I'm not sure in what capacity.

Both groups tend to have options that aren't good for the game. Those that don't play much may want things like infinite run and those that play 18 hours a day may want runecrafting to never be updated.

Because despite the removal of free trade in 2007, Jagex reported continued new account creation and game growth all the way from 2008 to 2012. The company's value and revenue continued to increase and even was slotted for an E3 slot in 2008 where they announced Runescape HD. Does that sound like a game that "Most of the player quit" in 2007? At the time IGN wrote up the article about Runescape HD in 2008, there was 186,000 players online. Thats the kind we pull on 07 now. How do I know this? Because unlike the morons who blanket everyone as sharing their opinion on reddit, I actually use the internet to fact check before making grandiose false statements or opinions to attempt validation of my own opinion. If you have an opinion, own it. But do not falsely blanket others to share that opinion.

Just because you stopped playing in 06 doesn't qualify you to say everything after what you remember is automatically rs3 content. You're more than welcome to hold that as an opinion, but it's objectively wrong because RSHD was an update made in 08 whereas rs3/EOC was much later.

Holy shot I don’t give a fuck

I’m laughing harder than I should at this. 😂

Someone better give Gertrude a violent talk soon, then

the rwt is only a few months old isint it? Making a mistake and apologizing is the way to go but dont expect all the dust to settle in so quick. He has to regain the respect he lost, peoples are allowed to still be pissed. 
---
You are correct it's just a relic.
---
I don't mind a toggle HD but I 100% want to keep current graphics. Main reason I quit RS3 was NXT client/new graphics. I always loved runescape for it's simplicity.

U have to enjoy what ur streaming, cant guarantee any interaction... Try to do it for views and engagement it will just fail, play what u want, enjoy it and maybe some viewers will stick around

I love osrs, dont mind watching stuff on twitch, but i can't really watch osrs on twitch..

You can get away with the "Not as bad bot". Buddy made a pure and alched up to 94 with that method and never got banned.
---
"amount of work"
---
took 2 people like 2 months
---
YAH, SHE GRAB ON MY DICK LIKE A HANDLE YUH
---
What’s the point of doing that? You’re doing that to train your magic and a faster rate and are not profiting as much because of it.
---
Alching is profitable too kiddy.
---
How do they even catch autoclickers? Let's theoretically say I want to autoclick alch so I record ~20 minutes of my own unique clicks then play it back on repeat.  That catchable?

i got an intermediate unappealable ban on an account with no offences for having my mouse on scroll wheel

It shows the wall distance for re-aggro and you can check how long before losing aggro at any time.
---
People do from scratch series using the accounts they already have. Let's pretend his pure already had all the stats he wants on it. Then I'm sure you'd be able to recognize that the stats of the account are unrelated to the "from scratch" title of the series.
---
Oof
---
Curious as well. Was excited when it came out, not so much to find out it was a melee distance cast. Anyone got word on the range?

Bunch of 20+ mildly-severe autistic year olds who have played a game for a better part of their life coming together to meme, insult, and praise a game we all love and hate at the same time. Everything is meta but it’s always in good spirits.

no this isn't RS3.

Ofcourse , just trying to figure out how they knew

thanks! I really appreciate the positive feedback! :D

love watching people suffering on this game not gonna lie

It's the endgame triangle amulet. Meaning it works for all 3 schools of combat.

can someone tell me what regex is?

Best of luck! Take my upvote hope a jagex member sees it
---
Please this would be amazing,  no reason to hold back on shit like this. Like WoW you can toggle the graphics. OSRS needs something like this, people new to the game always comment on the graphics at first glance, while they miss the underlying beauty the game has to offer via content and progression.
---
How do u check how many superiors you've killed? I got an imbued heart bout 2 months ago so I wanna know how many I've killed
---
....??? Im sorry to be rude here, *BUT NO SHIT SHERLOCK?* thats the point of the fucking game lmao. If you aren't "good" enough to make profit from PvP then why the hell should you??? Thats the most thoughtless suggestion and im glad youre not a dev. Tell me when this game has EVER been based around anyone being able to profit from pking..or ANY mmo for that matter. Its an activity dude. The way you farm/etc is from doing pvm. If you dont make money PvP then go do pvm like the other people. Seriously youre trying to make PvP non-risk and also add a profit and unfair gain for those who die and dont make profit?? THAT RUINS THE ECONOMY. WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. you risk the items you gain from pvm and thats what you PvP with usually. That is LITERALLY the point.

Ironman 
---
He is not wrong though. 
---
I’m down for that...when I’m on my phone at work and it’s flipped the side my boss knows I’m gaming lol 
---
He could’ve been watching a moving while clicking for 1 hour straight who cares
---
Can you give my Ironman your luck please? I did a task of 70 lava drags and didn't even get a Slayer enchant. Got plenty of pk-ers coming for my blue wizard hat and 300 chaos runes tho
---
Ironman.
---
They would have to make an SD and an HD texture for every asset from that build onwards. How is that no work?
---
Do you make more money at revs killing them skulled or unskilled?

I have a wife that could not care less when I play Runescape.

When did I say everything after what I remember is rs3 content? 
---
So you're saying because I think they look similar its wrong because one came out after the other. Thats some good logic right there lmfao. Looks like you cant read either.
---
&gt;That's ironic because in runescape skilling is all about afk methods
---
Many people's approach to skilling is afk, yes. But there are also many people that want to do the fastest xp possible. That's why we have afk methods, as well as things like 3-tick fishing, or 1-tick karambwans.
---
7 attack 32 str and 87 def build is best imo

I’ve thought about it. Just playing on Ape Atoll

You haven’t made any substantive points nor did you’d ctuslly respond to any specific point I made.
---
- not meant as a way to farm currency
---
So what? Neither were bosses when they were first released. They had a couple token drops but mostly lost money to do. People originally did them for the challenge. PvP wasn’t meant to lose currency either by that is what it currently does outside of bounty hunter... Pkers should be able sustain themselves and profit without having to resort to killing PvMers in the wilderness. Again this is like removing all the profitable drop tables from bosses. People quickly lose much reason to do them outside of the challenge. If we made bossing so dangerous that you couldn’t get your items back either, with a high likelihood of dying too (because in PvP, you do indeed have a very likelihood of dying), for a chance at a shit but rarely decent reward. Then quickly very few people would PvM.
---
Fucking the economy? The scale this would do compared to PvM (zukrah, revs, vorkarh, rune dragons, hello???)
---
50+ hours for a mithril plateskirt. wow

Recently
---
I remember when I was a kid I had this genius money making idea where I'd pick 1m cabbages from the Draynor patch and then sell them to the guy in the Zanaris marketplace (which you have to pay a diamond to enter...) to make 100m. I had like four other friends picking cabbages and giving them to me and wound up with like 64k cabbages total over a few months.

I was not a smart kid in hindsight.

Don't worry about these kinds of things as a new iron, you aren't going to be grinding anything like GWD bosses for a long time yet. I've got 600 hours in and the only monotonous item grind I've felt necessary so far has been the Black mask (for slayer helm) which is a 1/512. By the time there's going to be one obvious target item that takes as much effort as this, you'll have 
---
Herblore will tear your eyes out though
---
Cool and sort of sad to see his channel. Like 15k back then for RS was considered fairly big. channels like SoSolid2kk, TehNoobShow, Excl, Sladeakakevin, and even blocks sit at their channel count from their time back when they were big and Poppin. It's fun to look back.

Many words that have roots from other languages retain the original/very similar pronunciation, if it is composed of phonemes that are common to the borrowing language.  It's perfectly reasonable to expect a word pronounced in Old French like "kwaf":
---
# coif (n.)
---
late 13c., "close-fitting cap," from Old French *coife* "skull-cap, cap worn under a helmet, headgear" (12c., Modern French *coiffe*), from Late Latin *coifa* "a cap, hood" (source of Italian *cuffia*, Spanish *cofia*, *escofia*), of West Germanic origin (compare Old High German *kupphia*, Middle High German *kupfe* "cap"). As "light cap of lace worn by women," mid-15c.
---
To still be pronounced that way.  Sometimes words get translated like they are written in the original language, and pronounced differently.  That appears to be what happened with coif because most people say it like "koyf".  It probably would be said like "kwaf" if it was spelled "quaff".  But we already have a word for that - quaff.
---
Since we have two words, and two pronunciations, and given that English pronunciation rules would map
---
coif -&gt; "koyf"
---
quaff -&gt; "kwaf"
---
It makes sense that they are both commonly pronounced in these ways.  Some people might have a different pronunciation in some of these cases because of historical reasons, current pronunciation changes.  Or different dialect.  In fact, [https://www.google.com/search?q=coif](https://www.google.com/search?q=coif) reports a different pronunciation than [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coif) , so there is some disagreement.

yeah i know. these aren't even good xp either, or fun to fight, or anything. The only saving grace is their max assigned amount is like 20. they should at least drop something nice tbh

Either I'm misunderstanding the guy, or you are. I read what he's saying as "I've put over 700 hours into this account, and made the mistake of using an autoclicker." It seems you are reading it as "I ran an autoclicker on this account for 700 hours."

I hope that explains what I mean well enough.

Think its mainly because most people dont care for uim imo. Swampletics is really fun to watch for myself because of the weird and "dead" content he does. I know uim has some weird meta things but I never found them interesting.
---
It had fewer players than when it was in its prime. Also, how big of a moron do you have to be to come into a forum for oldschool runescape and suggest something that's the opposite of oldschool?

I don't accept the teal hat as Season 3. Season 3 begins with the God cloak, cmv.

I made this username on Runescape when I was 7 years old. It's supposed to be "Tai Chi" which (at the time) I thought was a form of martial arts (like Kung Fu, which is super cool, right?). Eventually "Tyg" got hacked and then "Tyg13" was the replacement.
---
I never really thought about it until now, but Runescape is literally where it all started...

Genuine question - In hindsight, would it have been a shorter or longer grind going for 66 smithing and making the skirt yourself?

---
They could make these odd 'single-way' tiles multi-way? There's only a handful of locations like this in the wilderness.
---
Another solution is to place the player underneath the target when no other tiles are available. 
---
There's no chance to 'freeze, dd &amp; log' when your target has 5 buddies ready to freeze you in multi.
---
So you are forcing PvPers who have no interest in doing PvM to do PvM? 
---
Don’t you see the problem with this argument? The rune pouch didn’t get moved to the slayer shop and to wilderness slayer for no reason. PvMers didn’t want to be forced to engage in PvP content for their items. Skillets didn’t want to be forced into wilderness to get best xp rates in some skills. PvPers don’t want to be forced into PvM just to make some money.

This is not the place to accuse players of wrongdoing. Report abuse in game and contact Jagex for serious issues. Feel like sharing? Please censor names wherever possible.
---
yeah i put wrong numbers, 10% chance is actually what I was thinking, more balanced, the chance of getting the rewards would be
---
75% Pyronmancer gear + 2 rolls
---
20% Burnt Pages + 2 rolls
---
10% chance at pet + 3 rolls

Absofuckinglutely defuckingserved. He's amazing as both a streamer and video creator. Settled and UIM Link were the best ultimate ironmen. Dream collab tbh btw.
---
I thought you had to be 13 to play this game.
---
It's definitely safer if they have a whitelist over a blacklist. Then they can simply add pcgamer etc as approved websites instead of trying to remove every single free domain and every scam website as they pop up
---
if i was you i would make the shittiest appeal for that ban,  ide be like.    hey guys please unban me.  ill stop botting maybe if you do.  but only after i get 80 agility. i was almost there when you guys banned me.   thanks for understanding!

game only records up to a certain number, usually 255/62555/whatever. is based on how jagex stores integers.

I remember his old reviews on new content in the game. Looking back on them, esp for something like the dbow, it really shows how far we've progressed with the game.

Am I getting this right? He did all that for a possible step in a clue scroll?
---
hugh what?
---
It belongs to daddy swamp now
---
Left to right, you have weapons viggora mace, craws bow and thammaron scepter some of the best weapons to use in wilderness; Amulet of avarice( notes drops in rev caves) bracer of etherium(prevents hostility from revs, I think) ancient crystal(used in PoH), emblems(exchanges for go on pcp worlds) teleport scrolls and revenant ether (used to charge weapons and bracelets)
---
&gt; If you felt strongly on a matter you could/should/would make such a post regardless. 
---
Not everybody does this or even comments on the matter (let alone use a social media source), sure they might rethink it, some might leave a comment, but most of the time people just leave it because they don't have the inclination to do it.
---
&gt; I don't see how the question nearly passing/failing being public changes that, people who are passionate about the game will likely debate this regardless. 
---
12% of people vote, now I know many might be bots or people who don't play/care much but the fact of the matter is most people who do have interest in the game are happy to let others decide. There are probably more people active on reddit alone in this sub than there are people who vote on the polls ingame so I feel this a fair assumption.
---
&gt;In fact having the results public might hinder debate somewhat since if it's clearly passing (or clearly failing) then you might not feel the need to say anything. Could be either that you agree with how it's going so why bother or you disagree with how it's going and feel futile about that fact.
---
Fair point, I can't argue with that. But I feel this seems to go against what you said before about people could/should/would. If most of the people on social medias are whinging about something and that the decision was clear then why would you argue them as clearly you don't match the public and need to conform. Hell given a poll it might show something else that more casual players (less interested in medias players) are interested in.
---
&gt;A feeling of futility about influencing the polls is a big point for a lot of people who don't even vote as a result of feeling that they won't change that because they can see how popular/unpopular something is already. 
---
I don't like this because to me, if you don't feel like your vote counts then you shouldn't be voting or clearly don't really care?
---
&gt;You don't know that people assume others vote as they do if they can't see the results, as a matter of fact hiding the results intentionally makes it so you *can't* know for sure if people agree with you or not. 
---
This is true but if I like many people am limited at the time and think certain logic about something as it comes up but don't consider something else then I might believe one question is a clear yes/no when actually it isn't.  Question 4 of poll #61 is case of this for me. I disliked the colours that it was being changed to until I decided to look up what was actually happening as most people liked it, turns out it now fit in thematically and I in my ignorance didn't think about this. When I read that it became much more clear as to why the recolour was so popular, this can happen to literally anything.
---
&gt;Well since we're assuming the voter in question is checking social media and reading what others think then this is moot.  
---
Not really, specifically looking something up often yields wildly different results to just casual browsing.
---
&gt;That's part of the argument to hide them, so people make decisions for themselves instead of voting as others do. 
---
People do still make the decision for themselves otherwise the skip question sometimes wouldn't make up 20%+ of poll results. People aren't as mob mentality when taking a test anonymously than if you were to ask them in person. Hiding a poll result still doesn't stop them from running into their favourite streamer's opinion/reddit's opinion instead of their own.
---
&gt;Hindsight is 20/20. If something is released that clearly needs changing upon having had a chance to test it then people can voice that opinion to Jagex and have it changed. 
---
True, but this isn't debating me, this is going around my point. Having polls show results can show something to people who haven't necessarily met the publics opinion on the matter allowing them to talk about something they might have thought was obvious to them that wasn't to everyone. Sometimes design and balance doesn't need to be ingame for someone to realise it is a bad idea.
---
&gt; Don't assume. 
---
I didn't (:
---
They can make hidey holes and it's a major strategy. Iirc he needs oak planks for a medium clue, which he can get in the mine
---
Decided to look into how long the recent in game polls were staying open for, with many of them this year being open for just a few days.
---
 If polls were open for the full week, polls would likely pull more voters, and also gives more time for conversations about the poll to happen. 7 day polls may also allow content to come into the game slightly slower over a long period of time and slow down the games progression, which some player might like, or not.
---
I also went and looked through to see how long each poll in 2018 was open, and the only poll that was open for the full 7 days was the kebos lowlands poll in october.
---
Because most of the code was from a private server.
---
But the drop table didn't receive nearly the amount of attention as this polling issue, so it's not really a fair comparison. 
---
We’re witnessing history as it’s being made. This is special for everyone who’s here right now.
---
It blows my mind that people are still happy with the dog shit eye sore graphics 5 years later when all the nostalgia has worn off. It's part of the reason why I don't play anymore.

Hmm. That's a pretty logical state all things considered.

Ahh. You might be right. Huh, so the dude is just retarded.

Going to have to report your friends for bug abuse. The only way this can be fixed if the community does the right thing and polices itself on it so those accounts don't have an unfair advantage.

I never liked this graphic style. It looked weird, and not fitting.
---
According to legend, Zezima the Great visited Swampletics in his swamp one day. Swampletics was lying on the ground, basking in the morning sun. Zezima approached him and said, "great Swampletics, if I could grant you one wish, what would that be?" To which Swampletics responded, "27 hunter." Zezima the Great laughed and said, "if I were not Zezima, I would be Swampletics." To which Swampletics replied, "if I were not Swampletics, I would be Swampletics, too."
---
No thanks, after looking at these graphics I have no idea how I tolerated how shit they looked. It's either the current RS3 HD for me or the current OSRS graphics. Inbetween would be what the pic is and that's gross
---
no there isn't
---
One time someone crashed me when I was 85 ranged with an rcbow and he was 99 with a dhcb and I somehow managed to get the drop and got a visage.  One of my luckiest osrs moments for sure

I hate the look personally, but wouldn't mind if it was toggleable.

I actually wish there was some way of reverting the graphics to a previous state. I miss the dopey looking Varrock guards, and the current ones still feel kind of out of place to me.

The dude has a maxed ultimate Ironman. If he hasn’t learned to enjoy the grind then i think he would of burnt out a long time ago.

What is OSHD 
---
16 attack is pretty nice until you get range based.
---
solution: you can't vote unless you have done something (aka a few f2p quests or reached a certain skill level then) people aren't going to go through the trouble of that just to know the results before they vote on their main. and for those that do, more power to them. they're wasting their day over a video game voting poll

There is just now! I'm actually making popcorn for this one, it's the first episode I'll be watching on release, I was late to the series lol
---
While I can’t know for sure the extent of engine work required, it seems pretty clear to me, at least, that supporting a huge game, while completely overhauling the engine, would be incredibly difficult. Would need much bigger engine team. And I doubt the other devs are slacking, they do what they love. 
---
There is very little business value from an HD OSRS. While I am content with how the game is now, I’ll agree OSHD would feel really good and be beautiful to look at and enjoy. But aside from the huge amount of extra work required, I don’t see much actual value for Jagex coming out of an HD OSRS.
---
Although I will say: it would be dope, but I think I’m the short term it would COST them money. That’s hard for any business to justify.

---
EV's response when out of context on how he runs his channel looks bad. He looks like a dick to those who just see the one or two posts.
---
IN reality he's a troll boy and gets talked way more shit then he ever gives back. His favourite word is cunt. Like he's not pretty but he's genuine imo.
---
So he isn't a perfect model citizen by any stretch of the word BUT the shit he's getting I personally feel is out of context by people who only saw the screencap and don't know more about him that that.
---
imo. But yes for the complaint about the legitimacy of his series those are bogus because he never made the claim the account was from scratch as far as training goes. That's the only part of the whole EV drama thing that bugged me.

And all in all EV's taken it all in stride and I haven't seen him tilt off the face of the planet because of the shit, like he thrives off this crap.
---
So because others were shit on when they were newb it should always be that way? this is why the community is dying, I have no desire to be a part of that.
---
unit
---
Again, what’s the point in voting if I can visually see it won’t make a difference? There isn’t one. 
---
inb4 he gets it on his first clue
---
Alright, thanks for clearing that up because that's what it felt like
---
No I get it. Its just pedantic. "From scratch" definitely has an agreed upon definition that does not involve being God, this is most likely in violation of that. Its fine if the creator still wants to do it and people still want to watch it. Its really not a big deal and not necessary to argue the existential nature of the universe just because someone said "From scratch". Everything is fine and its personal preference.
---
Exactly. Thanks
---
'Yo dawg I heard you like hiding poll results so we made a poll about whether the poll to hide the results of the poll to hide poll results should be hidden.' 
---
All feedback on this one is appreciated, I've taken some feedback about speeding up content and making the vids a bit longer
---
Are you going to drop the mith skirt after that clue step is over? 
---
The thing is, once you get people interested they will grow and improve, But nobody starts out doing insane hybrid switching.   
---
If you get people interested, they will become good pkers, but currently there is no motivation for me to learn. I dont want pking to be easier, but I want a fair fight when im learning.
---
I'm... so sorry...
---
Surprise r/askouija

Lmao, positives

Those things are dorky as fuck lol my brother had one

He got some prayer levels as well and amulet to top it off so I guess it was fine in the end?

Exactly why I left. Just hangin in for the memes.

How does one start making your own plugin? I know the basics of coding and creating the plugin itself won't most likely be hard, but where can I get started?
---
Forge
---
In this thread: OP is a rude heartless jerk
---
if it checks a few boxes, I'd start out with 3 episodes or so and expand regularly (not too fast) from there
---
-hasn't been done before  
---
-is actually interesting  
---
-is also entertaining  
---
-interesting and entertaining to a significant number of players
---
if you can check off all those, the only thing left to see is the content! best of luck homie, can't wait to see.
---
True, but by then many more people would be interested in pking, essentially solving the pking problems. If enough people are interested wildy/pvp worlds will be thriving
---
Because they are producing engine and graphics work, you just want them to do engine and graphics work that *you* want.
---
Haha yes he always slurps up his sperm
---
That would make sense
---
Forget about it bro, he won't listen to you because you're just another 'shit pvmer'
---
this isn't call of duty. the goal isn't to have a matchmaking system which makes your win rate 50% for basically every player. if you *really* want to improve, you can do it against players who are way better than you just fine. it sounds to me like you don't want to improve, but rather that you want to win. don't get me wrong, i get that too, but trial by fire is a perfectly valid way to improve.
---
I mean a lot of people won’t watch it tbh, however you gotta start somewhere, you’d mostly be trying to establish your prescence within the community so I wouldn’t worry about copycats 
---
I'm not a pker, the main reason being Pk'ing fucking sucks, cause its inconsistent and doesnt make money and it's because of people like you who refuse to vote yes for any pvp updates. Regarding Wilderness, you're not forced to be in the wilderness, so if you can't accept the risk of dying to a Pk'er, just leave, stop bitching and get something else to do. There's a lot of people who enjoy killing revs and clan pking at rev caves, so it's clearly not bad content considering its an alternative to the "kill the same boss over and over again" method of making money thats dominating the game
---
I don't get it...
---
As a casual OSRS player (noob) I really appreciate the explanations
---
Sheeple 
---
Its in a totally different comment, I wasnt thinking to add it to this one, but I will fix that!
---
why, you know one that needs some watching? 👀
---
thanks a ton! glad to hear you enjoyed it, still got plenty more to do tho.
---
I don't understand your intentions here? If you have 0 interest in pking how can you be convinced to try it. I have no interest in trouble brewing and I'm not going to ask someone to convince me to play it. We're talking about pvp an aspect present in most games, there are plenty of people who should try it. Posts like yours have no value or substance. You've literally made this post to shut down any suggestions people make. 
---
why is everyone talking about it being toggleable, OFC it would "just" be a toggle. and that's why they will never do this, it would double the work of QA and probably tenfold the work of artists. all this only for the people that'd use it over the original graphics
---
Honestly it shouldnt take him that many clues to get a cloak, I believe they're around 1/50. Of course, that could easily be hundreds of hours given his method, but at least he isnt grinding ranger boots.
---
If you actually watch him, esp when playing with friends, you’ll know that’s just his personality. He’s not being mean spirited, he’s just Australian. 
---
Funny that’s what most of us said when coming to your post. 
---
This content we want though. 
---
Damn this was nice
---
If swampletics and my girl 👧 😍 both drowning 😱 👋 and I can only save one 😤 😬 Catch me at my girl funeral 😔 👻 🌹 saying "this is so freakin' cool man" 😏 💯 😎

idk what that means

---
I get it too, his case alone probably didnt impact the community as a whole but neither do any of the other singular cases. What does is their collective effect, which is a stain/hindrance to the entire OSRS community.
---
Well at least you're honest
---
The ladder system is by far what I would want the most. Rewards are not a big priority as people get motivation by moving up tiers.    
---
I dont want pking to be easier, I just want to learn in a setting where the fight is fair. A system like this would train people up to a level where they can actually stand a chance vs good pkers.
---
A few months ago I found a license plate (on reddit) with a phrase RS players **actually** say on it
---
What about content creators? If 60% of the viewers can't stand anything but the default graphics but the streamer or youtuber wants to use the new ones, that'll tank their views.
---
Look up old exhibit pimp my ride memes Yo Dawg memes. 
---
Exactly. I think the option to fight people with your own gear risking your own gear would be a good part of the game, but not at the beginner levels.
---
Can someone explain what crashing is please? 
---
Pretty sure he dropped the amulet.
---
Been years since i played osrs but watching this series has reinvigorated the love i had for the grind
---
$11/month here i come
---
the comment the other dude posted said jagex thinks it is fixed actually, so i dunno
---
You can post the link.
---
EVScape started a pure set from scratch series but transfered a bunch of end game items to the account from his main to "train with".
---
He wears it
---
He will probably build a hidey hole/stash unit to store those items for him.
---
Just put out content that makes you excited to make. Don't worry about followers 
---
Why only medium clue scrolls though? Cause rarity?
---
Fuck yeah.
---
My problem with this is the matchmaking. I would have to find someone simliar skill level as me, then actually go and do this.   
---
I have no motivation to go learn pking, but a ladder style minigame like this would actually motivate me to learn if I knew I was matched with similar players.
---
From my(admittedly very little) research, drops are rolled on death, and given to the player who dealt the most damage, with the exception of Ironman accounts. In theory, the drop still could have gone to OP if he had managed to deal more damage than the Crashers. He would still have had to roll the kbd pet, though.
---
hey /u/SettledRS can you clarify who you are going to be doing ToB with? Are you looking for other morytania locked ironmen or just friends who will limit their gear to what you've unlocked?
---
It is also over 18 years old so not really surprising at all
---
I met someone last night at 5k kc no pet and he saw mine and saw my kc. He was very distraught. I hope you get it soon! You definitely deserve it more than I do 
---
27 hunter to barehand baby implings, 29 hunter to unlock swamp lizards, then hunter all the way til he can barehand dragon implings is the far far long-term goal
---
He's talking about the amulet of the damned
---
According to legend, Zezima the Great visited Swampletics in his swamp one day. Swampletics was lying on the ground, basking in the morning sun. Zezima approached him and said, "great Swampletics, if I could grant you one wish, what would that be?" "27 hunter," Swampletics responded. Zezima the Great laughed and said, "if I were not Zezima, I would be Swampletics." To which Swampletics replied, "if I were not Swampletics, I would be Swampletics, too."
---
I feel honored to be in this video. Finally my parents are proud of me. Swampletics viewing party checking in!
---
Bugger! It was a great quest. Thanks for the response appreciate it. Hopefully they make it for osrs!
---
I used up all my luck by getting four whips in under 300 kills. I’ve been having trouble finishing rag and bone man 2 now because the bones are taking like 40 kills to get
---
Funnier then the copy pasta
---
...I don't understand the question.
---
u/SettledRS don't be afraid to take it easy next week. You pulled like 80 hours this episode. I'll watch your episode even if it doesn't come out next Thurday.

---
I mean the reward thing is just a bad idea as it would promote reporting people for just the rewards and never doing it again. The real reward from reporting bots is that less will be in the game because like it or not they do actually get banned but there's just so many in the game and for each one that gets banned, another one takes it's place. Most of the people running these bots know this and just set up dozens of accounts for one particular money maker in case one or more get banned.
---
Why not just smith it
---
Scratch.

That's the dopameme hit I was looking for 
---
If this happends one day, I will buy membership for a year and start playing again. Damn those days..
---
Like a new skill, a big update that’s taken a lot of time. Or something that’s strongly tied with the integrity of the game
---
Cosmetics for example wouldn’t be a thing they’d likely override, but something to do with player account security shouldn’t exactly be governed by the players, I’d expect the devs to be more informed and competent to decide if it’s important enough for an intervention
---
God I love these videos.  I have a bunch of friends who know nothing about runescape but now are so excited to watch these videos lol
---
doesnt work :(
---
Why in 1 login session?
---
The thing that got me to go away was microtransactions and the EoC. I would not mind RS3 graphics.
---
Even then, with 400-500 total you probably still have no idea what's going on in raids or post-99/efficient skilling.
---
If you put everything in your bank I can’t take anything (assuming you have a pin)
---
"It's important for us to understand why you want the poll results hidden, and what you think it would solve."
---
Has no one at Jagex ever fucking voted in a general election? It's absolutely ridiculous that they are being so willfully ignorant about this issue. 
---
settled is like 17. This is weird.
---
I hate those graphics lol.
---
Nah man, I do not unfortunately. I’m a super casual player and I only really started playing again recently. 
---
Right, because graphics are the only major difference between OS and RS3.
---
I like the idea of it all but I just think the reward is a bad addition.
---
People have been saying that pking is dying since 2014 and that's absolutely not the case. I see more metas and pures now than ever
---
Aight. Tl;dr of my original posts: Sounds boring as fuck.
---
&gt; its nothing that would hurt the game in a significant way. Its just a graphical update
---
yeah sure just look at RS3
---
That's generally the idea, yes. You should still do Konar tasks every 10th, 50th, etc task because she gives the most points (besides wilderness slayer)
---
the only people that enjoy his garbage """"""""""content"""""""""""" are downie retards
---
I didn't see the original post and I fucking love this. Great idea OP.
---
If I wanted to look at plastic I would've looked at my figures.

Doesn't hurt to try. You can keep arguing what will or won't happen but noone has a crystal ball.
---
Damn!!! Gratz man!!! 
---
The game tracks every pixel that the cursor moves across, if it moves more than one at a time the game assumes cheating via some sort of bot
---
This can be demonstrated by the fact that in game you can see your options change as you move the cursor over various objects
---
He said it from the get go that he would be doing that. If you can’t listen then that’s on you.

Can only have one clue in your inventory at any time, and can only get new clue scrolls if you don't have one in your inventory.

Chinning and barraging are similar and both very effective training methods. Since you are asking, I train ranged at the ogresses on my F2P HCIM, I'm almost 98 :P 
---
&gt; just doing range on slayer task is so slow
---
What are you using to do that, a blowpipe or something poverty like RCB/Broads? 
---
AFK NMZ with RCB or better/Broads and train slayer/blowpipe when you're paying attention? NMZ BP is supposedly viable if you take into account the points gained are about 1:1 GP via herb boxes but take a few weeks to return to you.

Beyond watching the whole Q/A, is there a way to know if a specific question got answered?
---
Yeah I know about Dinhs, but if it's not a dedicated leech team, in funs I'm just going to Dinhs/MSB 90% of the time.  It's just hard to throw a Dinhs spec given it only has a singular attack style.
---
Nice try, but we all know girls that play OSRS don't exist, she is clearly a robot, hence the ban.

lmao you play with DOLLS?? it's 2018 dude, grow up nerd!!!

Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked ultimate ironman. After recently ironman I decided to forge my own journey No banking, no time I can't leave maxing my ultimate up the anti, and from scratch. trading, but this Morytania.

Hello
---
I'm not able to login into the mobile game. I have a 3 month subscription which renewed on February 27th 2019. It will next renew on May 28, 2019. When I try to log on mobile I get the message "You are standing in a members-only area. To play in this world move to a free area first." It shows this no matter what world I choose free world or member world. I am a member but I don't know how even if I wasn't I can move to a free area if I can't log in. Just any ideas would be much appreciated.
---
Since you would have to start from scratch, I think it would be fair for all your items and xp to be transferrable to the main game
---
Which is what the main player base wants but that doesn’t gain subscriptions, especially when the established base is more likely to have the GP to buy bonds. 
---
Thanks for brightening up my life. Be well 
---
I like this idea of a membership reward better than Gp tbh
---
You dropped amulet of the damned? Won't that take a really long time to get again?
---
They just pointed out your argument is flawed. Don't be salty you're a moron. 
---
Use BP on task I range,  I have done nmz with msb and Addy arrows,  figured that was quicker than RCB,  buy the XP per hour I was getting was slow,  I did have it on custom rumble hard,  tree spirit black demon,  me,  warlord,  and count Draynor
---

May you link the clip please?

I agree, maybe free membership for a month or so might be a better idea

Its interesting content thats well made but this sub has an annoying habit of taking anything remotely funny and running it straight into the ground. I enjoyed the videos but most of the hype is memes

her name is  "blaire white" on YouTube if you wanted to know

If you submit a ticket on their website (ignore the trolls saying its twitterscape etc), Jagex can provide you with an email of all the logins you've been associated with.

That's how I managed to find my old pure :)

This looks like fucking shit. However, if they ever wanted to put this in game, as long as it's togglable, I don't really care. 
---
Don't be an asshole
---
I have never botted and hope all who bot get banned to be honest. Anyways if I was to code one I would probably set something like click on random roll so I would call the click and then do a simple java random or something like that and have it pick between .5 - 2 seconds. Each click would then be slightly staggard and I assume Human like.
