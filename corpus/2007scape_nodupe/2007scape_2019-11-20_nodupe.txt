I'm assuming you're playing twisted leagues? Because shift dropping is an in-game option, and all of your options are set to default on twisted league servers when you first join
---
No flame mate, but where do all these 'hidden in plain sight' RWT theories come from? I see it so often on this sub - a streamer doubles clicks melee pray and goes down for a 200m max set and people start accusing them of RWT, shit like that. Is it a meme?
---
Should've also tagged each one so neither of you got loot.
---
Please please please track some statistics. I think they'll be super interesting.
---
Strange fruit is far too valuable as antipoison to waste on energy.

Strange, shift clicking anything just does it's first option for me.

I'm waiting for that sick holiday shirt to drop, gonna get one for xmas

Why do you have it so that 1k loot is purple lmfao

Endurance is always best no matter what tbh
---
It's almost like the wilderness is meant to be a dangerous place where players fight each other and you're just whining despite the fact you *choose* to enter with **zero intention** of defending yourself.

---
So tired of this crap.
---
He wasn't going for kills, he would tag it then run away. Then wait for me to kill one and then tag the fresh spawn.
---
&gt;By suggested visual overrides you've conceded the fact that graceful is mostly necessary.
---
I've never once suggested or thought otherwise, so of course this is the case. *You've* assumed I agree with your premise and motivations in the first place, which I do not. I have merely picked out the one aspect that I have an opinion on and can offer a constructive suggestion for, which is that limited cosmetic overrides could have a place in old school. Until now, I'd deliberately chosen not to comment on your suggestion for rebalancing stamina. 
---
&gt;From what little I do know of OSRS's spaghetti nightmare coding practices, I wager vanity slots would be a bug riddled mess anyway.
---
Most of the time, it's integrating with legacy (old) code that's the issue. Most of the new code is written by competent developers who can future proof their work (did you know that Runescript was literally designed to let non-developers write code for Runescape? No wonder the codebase is woefully structured). If you want a good example of this, check out Kieren's dev blogs that he released when he rewrote the code for cooking interfaces. He showed snippets of code that exemplify how bad the old code was (lots of copy/paste, for example) and cleaned it up with data structures and stuff.
---
Actual remix starts at 2:35 for those who want to save their time.
---
You don’t use stams running the head in groups period wtf are you talking about. You literally move 3 tiles
---
Prayer should've been adapted better so that it wasn't so outclassed by endurance. For example, training hunter should've automatically buried the bones and etc for other activities that give bones/prayer xp.
---
***ALWAYS CHECK THE WIKI FIRST***
---
Find a money maker you enjoy, go questing every now and then, lvl up prayer and construction a bit
---
I feel like if you get lucky with msb and black dhide early the konar blessing is better than clue scroll perk
---
Working towards barrow gloves is always a good idea
---
pretty sure this is bug abusing.
---
No?
---
The content is designed to be dangerous to complete. If people can't accept that then they should accept it's just not content for them.
---
Honestly I think you need 2.35 to prepare yourself for it! Haha all fun and games!
---
How in gods name am I supposed to defend myself against an account that is literally made for PvP?If you make your account for PvP, hunt people who are doing PvP. You don't need a 75 attack, 94 magic, 98 range account to kill someone talking to an NPC

---
As a counterpoint I think Leagues sit in a really awkward spot casually. A lot of the people I know in general don't want to play Leagues because their progress gets wiped so they'd rather commit to permanent progress on their main and buy the rewards, making the only true rewards the cosmetic trophies that are attached to your ranking.
---
I know a lot of casual players like the feeling of quickly reaching endgame but I have my doubts that this a point of appeal that will last between leagues and is probably something that people will get tired of after their progress resets.
---
In the future I'd like for them to add more hiscores categories for the Leagues (CoX KC, CoX points, Collection Log filled for Twisted League for example) and award trophies for the top of each hiscore category instead of just league points (maybe less per category so they don't give too many high tier trophies out?)
---
The best future league ideas I've seen have been:
---
1)F2P only (maybe p2p content f2p area?)
---
2)Starting off in an area of your choosing and unlocking additional "chunks" of the map with league points. I really want to see this one personally.
---
According to the script, about 710.

How do I obtain an acorn seed in Twisted Leauge?
---
Despite having the unnatural selection relic, I accidentally picked the oak tree and now I'm stuck.
---
My farming level is 70, so I'm not sure if I can still get them from the supply crates from wintertodt since I've done 150kc whilst my farming level was around 50.
---
Is chopping trees until I get a bird's nest and hope for an acorn seed my best bet?
---
I understand why it is Ironman, due to streamers and people’s alts.  The iron aspect does lessen the appeal for me, but it is the best option for this sort of mode.
---
I do hope at least some leagues won’t be Ironman.
---
You have to enable it in the ingame menu
---

Looking forward to see you :)
---
Would it be possible for league pets to carry over to the main game?
---
Because drop chance is the same and that you cannot play on both the main servers and the league servers at the same time, this doesn't lower the achievement. 
---
I would love to show off my new pet at the GE!
---
Hop as he asked after tagging them yourself, then hop back 5 minutes latwr and tag them all again.
---
The mentality is "I'm going to kill you because this is a PvP zone". It has nothing to do with ruining your day. 
---
If you do not like that you *are* going to be killed in the wilderness, especially if you have no means to defend yourself, then **stay out of the wilderness**; its content is not for you.
---
If you thought pvp was interesting you wouldn't be upset. This is just a scapegoat you created for yourself as a reason to vote no. It's illogical to vote no for content based on the actions of any individual. Or else, you'd end up voting no to everything. 
---
If it wasn't curse of the empty lord it would have been "while I'm doing black chins" or "while im training prayer" or "while im killing revs"
---
Are they black dragonhide?
---
That's the meta in twisted league? If so the meta should be killed.
---
I thought he was smoking 2 joints
---
oof bad opinion
---
Is that a 25 b hole reference?  Lol
---
Alright, if it's not for me then I'm voting no on all the PvP content. Simple enough for me
---
I guess. I just don't agree with fight fire with fire, trolling the trolls.. I'd rather just do my slayer in peace.

Btw i thought epicbot died like 10 years ago
---
A week or so ago there was a guy doing 20-50b stakes and dropping whole inventories of bcp's and other expensive items at the duel arena. Was a short while before those two big rwt sites went down, and in-between each stake he would turn off the stream and trade another account for 10b+ more. It's just all so fishy can't help but think it's rwt or worse some money laundering.
---
Like, who's to say there aren't people trafficking or dealing drugs using rsgp as currency? Maybe it's unlikely, but impossible??
---
How much gp should i save??? And what should i have my combat stats be up to
---
Okay thank you
---
Man if there's an achievement tag for posts, it's bc achievements should be posted if you're proud of them, let people enjoy their stuff
---
I'm really enjoying the mode so far. Only thing I'd recommend for the next run of it is personalized shop stocks. People that ruin it for everyone else when they purposely oversell is irritating.
---
How do we know this though? One of the oldest and trustiest tricks in the book is the old 'Oops sry guys I got cleaned 10b off stream last night ggwp'.. That to me is far more suspicious than these incidents that occur on stream in front of thousands. You could argue that that's a good reason to RWT on stream but I just see it as illogical. Oda's loss here is clearly not RWT, to think otherwise is foolish
---
Agreed worried about the burnout. I’ve only done 3 clues so far, two being easy, and they were uncannily similar, both having a repeat task. Being restricted to Kourend/Kebos only gives so much room for variety... but being able to take a break and stack them without the pressure of  missing out on clue drops is a definite plus.
---
I mean I’m going to go ahead and say you’re completely wrong. No “higher up” has “ran the numbers” on a code change for a time duration of a button press, lol.
---
QA (if it exists) simply doesn’t play mobile and neither do the devs, so this just hasn’t really been in their backlog. I am 100% confident the fix for this would take less than a day’s work by one developer.
---
Jagex just needs a trellis board for these type of fixes.... provided they actually still have people working on mobile.

Artisan would only make the decision harder for me lol! The RC xp from gatherer was a strong influence in my choice there, cuts the library grind to unlock the skill in half.
---
Yeah I’ve got a f2p Ironman and there’s absolutely zero reason to kill moss giants over hill giants. The hill giant club and rune kite are the most valuable drops in the game for ironmen and both of them are Obor drops and not Bryophyta.

Well im playing runescape so clearly i have a long way to go

Sorry, I don't have eyes, what is this post and your comment about?
---
I just followed the optimal quest list on the wiki, and as I got further down quests and got more money/levels/unlocked things I started naturally branching and setting goals for stuff
---
Heres a question though.
---
How about me?
---
I like to train efficiently but I enjoy changing it up and doing something I don’t normally
---
Nice dude!

Vannaka should make you kill Jad instead of a rat.

Buddy West didn’t make Zeah, he’s the only one fixing it actually. He revamped Hosidius, he wants to revamp Arceuus and its spellbook. You’re upset at the wrong graphic designer, he is among the best on the oldschool team.

It will probably only display the current season like they did with seasonal dmm
---
Imagine tbow with attack speed relic
---
easy ones will be but you don't have to farm loads of them since you only need to Bob shirt then you can turn in the rest for masters I'm currently sitting on about 250 clues to blow through this weekend and I think its gonna be kinda fun lol
---
Would you like to know how that last bit's issue was originally resolved in a way that made sense?  
---
tl;dr Gravestones.
---
    
---
Back when the instanced boss fight, the Queen Black Dragon, released there was a mechanic called gravestones. These fancy lil things could hold your items for 5 mins-1 hour, and be blessed by a stranger or friend with 70 prayer to refresh the duration up to a maximum of 1 hour. After that time the items spawned on the ground for anyone to pick up unlike now where they just vanish from the game.   
---
But that doesn't address the instance issue. You see, the jmods from 2012 were pretty clever. If you died in an instance they realized that they didn't have the technology to put you back in that exact same instance where your gravestone, and incidentally, your items were. So instead, they changed the problem. Instead of "how can we get the player to their items", they changed it into "how can we get the items to the player". They made it so if you died in an instanced fight, your gravestone would be spawned outside, at the entrance of the instance.  
---
Now this wouldn't be able to fit into osrs as easily as it did in rs2 due to npc's like Torfin already being in place, but it could work if the jmods put some imagination into it as an integrity fix to their bandaid solution.
---
Thanks so are you...
---
I think this was an idea I heard thrown around in one of Faux's streams the last few days, but one thing they could do with quests could be to allow players to spend points to have a quest completed for them. For example, if you got a dragon dagger from a clue, but couldn't get to Zanaris, you could spend some amount of points (25? I don't know how many would be good) to have Lost City completed so that you can use it.
---
On the other hand, the trophy is just a cosmetic wearable for showing off.  Getting 'top 1%' is much more of a challenge and much more impressive than an arbitrary '15,000 points' or something.  I like it even though I'll never get it.
---
I think it's good for the competitive community to have something that difficult to strive for the next 2 months
---
Are the sharks from minnows always noted? For some reason I thought it was just the raw shark.
---
It's not an absurd relic buff, It's a small part of the relic.
---
It also makes clues scrolls significant content again (which is a good thing).
---
I do agree that if it failed before, theres a very strong argument for not repolling. But  the first fail was because "omg rs3". This may well have changed public perception.
---
No this isn’t rendi, he commented on someone else’s post
---
dug his hole 20 years ago
---
At lower levels I would imagine Hill and Moss giants. Higher levels I'd guess Ankou's.
---
Gib yod plz

---
Oh yeah this is one of my favorite features. It’s amazing for bursting/chinning in the mm2 caves. I hit the (-) on everything except the one-dose prayer pots, which I (+). Makes it really easy to know when prayer potions drop and not waste time sifting through loot piles and allows you to not have a screen overloaded by white text. You can also set filters where only items above a certain value will appear on your screen, which is great for Slayer.
---
This was taken when I got the iron defender, could you imagine using 4K token only to find out the dragon defender was never going to drop anyway! Riiip
---
A rare treat.
---
Apparently they're spawning when people die in lieu of bones. I've been seeing them all day.
---
Rendi left a post here that says his method requires having protect from melee, and this account only has 43 prayer so they must have done something differently.
---
Gimme 😍
---
Questless league confirmed
---
Yep. It's a common feature in just about any game with loot on the ground, immensely helpful.
---
Note, you can also set them to hidden by right-clicking, or highlighted by left-clicking the textbox while holding alt.
---
It gets like that sometimes...
---
I went to alt tab while killing chaos druids and it popped up.  It was awesome because it gets rid of the huge mass of irrelevant info on the screen.
---
What about gilded
---
Yeaah thats good to hear buddy. I’ll shoot you s message over your pms :)
---
Honestly, just make endless endurance a default in the next league. That way 90% of us don’t lock it in and can explore other builds. It is way too good in comparison. I understand the advantages Of the others in the long run but I still don’t think they compare.
---
New or old this feeling is always awesome congratulations!! Now trade that badboy in for the pet chance!!!
---
Obviously go all in on clue boxes
---
I wouldn't want it to impact gameplay in any way; like I'd be fine if it didn't have a separate hiscore even. That said, having 0 deaths so far is probably part of my interest in it...
---
Another idea could be to change the chat symbol based on your current ranking using the same icons as task tiers, but I am not sure if they could do something that dynamic.
---
Lol, I was just going to ask if this meme came from that.
---
What happened next???
---
Mad props to you and the rest of the Mods. The league is fantastic and the most fun I've had in OSRS in months.
---
What's the fastest recorded inferno time?
---
Also if anyone has a video, I would appreciate it if it was linked.
---
how the fuck do you know somebody doesn’t have loot BEFORE YOUVE KILLED THEM? that’s the most retarded fucking thing i’ve ever read. as if a guy with 22 mil in cash *wouldnt* say “off bro i don’t even have anything”
---
I mean, most people don't split 50/50 if they are dps. Tank should get way more for no pet rolls.
---
Slang for dragonstone E runite bolts
---
I'm not sure about that, I saw someone die to guard dogs at the fruit stall, and it was just bones.
---
I never even thought I'd try the mode out but boy am I addicted. It's fun to have other players helping out by giving information that isn't widely known. Very interested to see the future of OSRS Leagues!
---
All of your posts are lies, you claim in one post that you mined 130k since mobile came out which would only be possible if you played around 14 hours every single day since then which i really really doubt. Most likely you just bought the gp
---
He absolutely did, even talks about in another thread buying gp to get his scythe
---
Your TLDR is literally almost longer than your post. I’ve never seen that
---
Also the chasm of fire one
---
no you didnt
---
All accs with infinite run is fine imo for a game mode like this  
---
  
---
Dark Altar - Pray training easier  
---
Accumulator - Range/mage easier  
---
??? - Melee training easier  
---
How about:  
---
Flying Fists - When your hands are free, your crush and strength bonuses are based on your attack/strength levels.  
---
Means no shield, plus there are some things that are resistant to crush attacks. About 80% sounds fair:  
---
40 attack/str - 32 crush/str bonus   
---
Rune scim - 45 slash / 44 str bonus  
---
70 atttack/str - 56 crush/str  
---
Whip - 82 slash/str  
---
99 attack/str - 79 crush/str
---
No I just play 12 hours a day all year I’m totally burnt out now
---
do you play TL? if so, why play at all with that attitude? if not... why are you like this?
---
I did bought a couple hundred mill but 90% from mining rune
---
I really don't like when the 99 cape simply acts as an item with requirements down in the 40-60 range, eg range cape and agility cape. It doesn't feel rewarding at all.
---
I love the idea. I personally decided not to play it due to having too many life responsibilities to make it worth it, but it's still a lot of fun seeing the community come to life again. great work.
---
Awesome and you started with one of the best nice
---
Griefing no bueno
---
no you dont, you bought all this gp. screenshot your mining xp and prove it
---
I had the thought today that Deadman and Twisted League are ways for Jagex to test how much players like increased XP rates in OSRS.
---
I love getting 5, 10, 15x XP drops and progressing quickly. But I simply can't accept that for the main game.
---
That's not a sprint...
---
I dont see the point in the armour if he is using prayer unless he has unlimited run
---
ah there it is
---
Does anyone have any idea why I can't pick Banshees for my slayer task? [https://i.imgur.com/rPo24sZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/rPo24sZ.png)
---
 Clue scrolls are an okay source
---
My gawwwwd I have no idea how the chat box was ever made to take up so much space in nearly the middle of the screen. But also in a way that I still miss it half the time and go running off into the distance
---
Over 1b in bonds. Because I refuse to RWT to gold selling sites and Jagex gets the profit.

why do you even want it? fashionscape?

No, it's a 100 mile sprint.

I made my account like a month ago and have 260 qp, maybe Runecrafted for an hour and got 55 easy from that, quests and diaries. Just finished that quest last night.
---
Absolute unit.
---
Surprised me.
---
If I had a world record like that I'd be showing screenshots to people who don't even play RuneScape. 
---
100% bullshit on his side.
---
I agree with you, I already find it hard when logging back in to normal worlds...
---
&gt;  I went and played RuneScape 
---
After I woke up and found my cat drowned in the pool, I went back to sara on my iron. Got ACB that day - and my GWD rare drop on RS in my life playing since 04. Very confusing day.
---
You can do b2b slayer but not farming
---
Accurate
---
I think you just read the title and guessed that I want to de-iron everybody. I don't, I just want pvm to work without abuse and shops to actually function.
---
I am very much looking forward to seeing what you guys have in store for the future. The world feels so alive with everyone running around and talking/exploring, it really feels like the mmos I played while growing up and makes me want to take part.
---
Thanks for the clarification, I didn’t choose unnatural (obviously) lol
---
The salt water pool in RS3 are locked behind quests or a time gate and a rare drop. PoH pools in OSRS aren't locked behind anything.
---
It wouldn't matter, the game looks at the possible damage you can deal, and rolls 0-max. So if a strength amulet and a power amulet give you the same max hit the power amulet would be better with the extra defence/attack
---
&gt;  5am then be back up for work at 6:30am
---
I feel this. I've been sleeping like 1-3 hours max a night the entire semester. My class schedule is all fucked up, so my choices are either don't sleep, or have 0 leisure time.
---
I would start skilling just make a routine and work on small goals like quest cape, then achievement cape etc.
---
similar to path of exile, if you add a certain gimmick to each new league in addition to new content every so often (with some having bigger content than others) then you've got yourself a consistent way to create content for your players.
---
Ideally to keep it interesting, allow people to get something out of their time in the leagues - like they're doing with the cosmetics - and you've basically got infinite content. 
---
It's also a great way to work out what kind of updates to introduce to the main game, and to test fresh content that might not otherwise be considered to be 'main game ready'
---
The Mess hall is a war also. Stop making Stew!
---
Yes, we can totally tell you're just saying this to try and make Rendi go 'watch me!' and go do it lmao.
---
&gt; UIM meta to train construction
---
Yup. I actually thought about doing this on my ULT, but after ~21m all from solos, I gave up. Con is my most hated skill, but doing solo WT to 200m is also aids.
---
Yeah if they were to do F2P map P2P content TL, it would definitely make sense for there to be 0 multi combat or in very limited areas. It's a mode about getting personal achievements, next to zero reason to have multi pking available.
---
I set this as one of my wallpapers and it looks sick. You make some amazing art.
---
Still, dope username dude. Loved FE7.

I honestly don't think anyone can beat xzact's inferno runs. He's miles ahead of everyone else at inferno runs at this point.

Replace alcoholism with Marlboro Red's. Whenever I drink, I end up exp wasting hard either by missclicking everywhere or just logging out after 3 hours of bank standing.

Wow, you're the only other person I've seen with my keyboard. Best $20 I've ever spent
---
dude.. you seem like a cunt.. ijs
---
Yeah definitely gonna work towards quest cape thanks
---
Guy also says he has a good couple hand fills of rs3 party hats, idk I can’t even get him to show me that.
---
Oooo, makes sense then. Not a PKer myself and always thought one ended up losing everything in wild.
---
Thanks for the answer. :)
---
I doubt you even pk
---
I would get into bird runs and farm runs also for passive levels. Also tears of guthix is nice.
---
You realise you can get stamina’s in raids
---
Lead a main clan for over a year my dude. Lead a shitty revs clan prior to that. I do more than just pk. I bet you think pking is only edge 1v1 smite fights l0000l.
---
When I was in Cuba, this is how everyone worked (if they worked at all). There were like 30 workers in front of the hotel putting up new plants, but really it was just 1 guy while everyone else watched. Then I saw four guys "carry" a ladder (just one with the others following) they put it up to get something from the roof, and never used it. Just went on break and the ladder stayed there all day.
---
Hi

This is my first time posting a video
---
also my first time doing any tick manipulation
---
but this version is really easy with Arcane Courier and shortbow without arrows!
---
Aggro method was air strike.
---
Just wanted to show it was possible :)
---
Although it may make the mode less enticing for you, 2 months at 5x (or more) the exp rate is more than enough for a large majority of players to accomplish their goals. And most people aren't aiming to hit every single achievement- that would render the whole competition aspect nigh-irrelevant.To lengthen it would make the mode quite dead the latter months for this majority, if not totally dead.
---
A funny feeling you have, being followed you are.
---
I really need to get into the farm runs I've always hated never liked passive money makers 😂
---
You got balls asking that. You are. People who buy gold are worthless and should just quit the game anyway
---
Yes, points earned in any future leagues can be used to buy Twisted League rewards. If Leagues as a concept is scrapped, the rewards will find other sources. 
---
Importantly, no League rewards will be discontinued.
---
Ah yes the osrs community is very well known for being good at communicating with people

There's a fat point bonus for 25m firemaking which is less than double 99'ing the skill. Wouldn't take more than a few hours to get once ur maxed.

Just be happy you're getting plenty of head, most people at your experience don't get it anymore.
---
What makes diablo more nostalgic than wow or rs? Lol
---
Max boost for combats is 118/99 with super combats. And yes, the boosted levels do benefit past 99 for combat. 
---
Skilling boosts like a d axe special at 99 puts you at 102/99 and that does not improve woodcutting speeds because spaghetti code
---
Try uim on league with no relics and set a goal like complete a solo raids before tbd end of the league?

Are the NPC's that pop up worth doing? I always thought it was an anti bot measure with some added minigames to break the monotony for legit people.. guess I should do more!
---
Okay
---
I think comparing it to DMM is silly, they’re completely different, both are good for different reasons. And the fact that a large portion of RS players flat out can’t pvp is probably why a large portion of your CC didn’t enjoy DMM.
---
I play efficiently on most aspects of the game, but when I did farming I legit just did tree runs and that was it.
---
I figure it gives me more time to do things I enjoy and fucking around doing random things lol
---
That's the plan right now

Nah 1item risk fights lol

If you’re pointing out lvl 99 for level 40 gear, what are they supposed to do? Rs3 had to entirely rework both the mining and smithing skills to rebalance that issue. That introduced new tiers of armor which we don’t really have room for considering ALL of our best in slot armor comes from pvm and the next closest craftable gear is basically garbage compared to whats best in slot

You behaved like a bot mayn?

You kept clicking on the same spot, mayn?

bruh what the fuck is this coincidence. I was looking up ironman guides and watched one of her videos for the first time yesterday. now she gets a tbow what the fuck

---
Actually I didn't make that claim, at all.
---
i hope not. i could not think of a more boring setting for the league (obviously exaggerating but it would suck)
---
I’m going for either 50 or 100 after I unlock my 3rd relic. Like 50 points away or something 
---
Mad easy points for something so repetitive and simple
---
Peruvian Pan Flute music
---
&gt;I honestly thought the low stock was just due to normal players wanting the item. Do you have proof it's super competitive clans?
---
I'm watching this one guy hop every world to buy it every time it restocks. If not a clan, then someone made a bot to grief the staves. No one needs THIS MANY staves.
---
i like it but i feel like if you take it out of your ammo slot the 6 or so graceful pieces should spill out into your inventory. To equip it back into ammo slot you click the new item and it "sucks them up" into a single item when it's equipped.
---
Cause you could do a lot of activities by simply unequipping armor, running with the graceful item, then re-equip for armor.
---
I’m so God damn proud of you boy

thanks dad

I took [This](https://i.imgur.com/K6xRL82.png) yesterday. Literally 0 bots. I thought they were banned, but i guess they just took a break lmao
---
&gt;As a normal account I saw no point in getting really crappy xp rates at cannafis just for marks
---
Good, cause that method is overrated. You get WAY more xp/h at seers and (from what i felt) way more marks per hour.

Thanks. A very helpful comment, clarifies the matter :)

Rarity is not what creates the price... that’s flawed logic. Rarity affects the supply but the formula is supply and demand, not just supply like you seem to

be suggesting. The demand for rapier is high not because it’s rare but because people want the BIS weapon *and* it’s non -degradable.

Someone edited it without source. :/
---
I wouldn't say you're too far behind. It takes no time at all to LVL your account , plus there are a ton of low lvls
---
Everything is a meme if you try hard enough
---
Gotta start again. Sounds like you were hacked and your account was used to bot. Kinda common with old accounts, happened to mine from RS2. 
---
Like the other guy said, your acount won't ever be secure and you'll probably end up getting banned.
---
It said last time I had logged in was 5 years ago, basically 3 years after my actual last time logging in. 
---
 
---
If It hasn't been banned in 5 years, I doubt they'll ban it. 
---
Im curious to see if they olayed on RS3 or only old school. 
---
Apparantly Jagex was compromised and my account was one if the few affected according to haveibeenpwned
---
But that's the definition of rng; that you always get a gaurenteed drop eventually. I kill goblins and I always get a goblin chainmail
---
Any chance we can get comp cape and trimmed comp cape goals in the future
---
At first I thought it was some mode I'd never be able to play, because I'm not good at long skilling sessions or PvP.
---
Relic 2 right now, it's good.
---
Gif of him walking pls. Could just be anothet person with a pet out, where his pet just collided with this acc
---
I thought purple chest were gaurenteed at certain threshold didn't know it was RNG based on percentage (kind of like barrows)
---
Jagex confirmed a week or so ago that runelite is compliant with all of their rules, so it is safe to use
---
Prayer flicking only uses zero prayer when you turn off ALL prayers every tick. If you leave one prayer on and 1 tick flick another prayer at the same time, it's the same thing as just leaving them both on.
---
I tend to agree about making things too easy. Ever since ironman came out you can see subtly in the drop tables how Jagex is catering to them, watering down the mode to the point where you barely do anything more than PvM, which is the only thing mains do anyway. 
---
The thing about Leagues though is there's around 10 worlds for 50,000+ players. If even 100 of them want to hunt chins, then only 10 people will get to because there's only a single grey chin spot per world. Being limited by out of game conditions is not fun at all. Jagex can't offer 50 worlds, like the main game, but they can adjust it so it's basically like having 50 worlds.
---
It could still get banned though. That kind of stuff is logged AFAIK. You can try with it, but I wouldn't expect it to not set off any red flags.
---
I purposefully ignored dark pages as they are too hard to find. Just focused on getting all the books on my first lap, then hoping to get a good amount placed in a row, then repeated

I’d be interested in a game mode with all the relics activated. Can’t imagine it would last long and it would be OP as shit but it would be fun to mess around in

The actual calcuation is more complicated and depends on your str level, but by and large that's what I've heard.

I chose endurance, it was just a quick thought bruv.
---
Endgame isn't when you finish all the quests, you know that right?
---
the accumulator relic applying to runes is huge though. if we didn’t have arceuus to level mage, then that would’ve been an effevtive 6.6x increase to mage xp. if i could switch my devotion relic to accumulator, i would.
---
hello sir congrats that is a very nice looking cape
---
Yeah but I mean real endgame. After you’ve killed a chrome pyramid and explored ruins/death lands
---
It's not a thing in the case game and OP didn't say a thing about Twisted Leagues
---
I swear everyone on this subreddit views this accessory game mode that not everyone plays as the default now...if a post ISN'T about Twisted League people still assume it is. Wtf.
---
after you get sniped for wizard spawn 3 times in a row and have to wait for the level 40 to flinch one to death with his mith sword you will no longer want to do clues
---
This is a long game with countless days worth of content. There isn’t a guide for how to play the game or a specified route. Just find out what your enjoyment is in the game and go for it. I maxed 2 main accounts one on OSRS and also in rs3 and working on an Ironman.  There is so many grinds I have left to work on I really enjoy it. Theatre of blood one of the 2 end game raids has been my go to with hitting 500 runs at 20 mins and I’m still missing 3 items. Chambers of Xeric has even more time to complete with more items which I will go to eventually. 
---
So skilled/pvm or pker there is aloot of end game.
---
I remember  at the time of announcement the way it was announced was really poor and it confused a lot of people.howeever the blog explained a lot more and it's obviously a big success
---
what is the achievement? I don't know much about Kourend
---
Can more than one person not do Sara wizard clues at once? Coulda swore I saw two in the lizard man canyon when running by it earlier.

where are the dumbfucks that usually comment in these threads about how "fake" the reaction is?
---
Thank you all for the response. I just need time to grieve and stay away from this game for awhile.
---
We're not all on reddit all day, for some of us, this is the first one we've seen.
---
You see how you called me a nazi for being neutral? This is why your opinion doesn't have any value.
---
The post above this for me is literally some streamer getting olmlet and tbow
---
I'm gonna have to agree with everyone here.  I'm pretty new to the game but I'm still having a total blast. Getting a fresh account will let you create the exact character you want to be, not whoever scripted your account 5 years ago.  It will also ensure it's security, especially after you do the Stronghold of Security and set up your Authenticator! Totally worth the effort of creating a new email address, or however you make new accounts.
---
Valid, but we do have the library. At mid lvl Slayer you're able to make more money than you spend, eliminating much of the rune cost. I can't think of one perk I'd trade endurance for.
---

Honestly DMM is resident sleeper, needs a complete rework
---
I believe so. I have it set to 5 minutes but I don't know what the other options are, it's been so long.
---
I haven’t really delved into leagues yet due to being on vacation, but when you get to the next tier of relics, does it use up the league points you had or do you get to keep them?
---
Your internet banking doesn't have something similar? I've seen rotating keypads and virtual keyboards for easily 10 years.
---
Mathematically?
---
Ikr
---
Tgat has to be one of the worst uses of TL;DR
---
Wait that's low key op points
---
Gotta do it and add an authenticator for that sweet, sweet 16 bank spaces.
---
Thats not even Yoda so you broke it.
---
But its not the rarest or most expensive, even though it is a lot more useful (on any account really)
---
Probably tastes great since he is the firecape record holder
---
Infinite prayer is already better than infinite energy though.
---
Me too, man
---
Even smithing spottier is better. Only use should be zeah rc
---
This is essentially the graceful of the league though, weapon is wildcard.
---
I've got no clue how I have so high skills (highest is 68, some 60s) and like almost 300 hours played...
---
What if there was a relic tier that makes it so you can only gain XP for n hours per day:
---
Relic | Can gain XP for | XP rate | Efficiency
---
---|---|----|---
---
No life | 16h/day | 5x | 100%
---
Got school | 8h/day | 7.5x | 75%
---
Got a job | 4h/day | 15x | 50%
---
That way a nolifer who plays 16h a day gets only 2x more xp than a "lifer", while currently nolifers get 4x more xp than lifers.
---
Not to punish nolifers, but more to incentivise casuals to join in. The first league is popular, but subsequent ones may get the *"I ain't got time for this shit, I'll just watch a streamer do it"* response.
---
Although that does make it so "4h a day" people need 3x less resources to train something like Herblore, but don't get 3x more of actual product like Pray pots for it.
---
Infinite prayer definitely can't be a starter relic. That's more of a tier 3 or 4
---
We need some epic fan art of this moment.
---
It's not authentic. There you go :p
---
This looks like exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm a totally new player, just started a couple weeks ago. I have a bond that was gifted to me but I'm saving it for when I get some skills leveled, I've mostly just focused on completing all of the f2p quests up to Dragon Slayer. I've finished those 19 quests and have achieved 45 Woodcutting, and am currently working on my Fishing (18 as of now).
---
How do I join the Clan Chat? I legit don't know how.
---
The best thing to do in my opinion is to just progress through the quests. If you google "osrs optimal quest guide" you'll find a wiki page that suggests you a good order to finish the quests in. By the time you get through most of the quests, you'll be much more experienced and be able to decide what you want to do with your account. Some people enjoy skilling and trying to max their account, other enjoy going bossing. In addition to that, finishing all of the quests is going to unlock new spellbooks, new teleports and location, and barrows gloves.
---
See e
---
Yes, KQ's range and mage attacks both have 100% accuracy but her melee attack rolls against your defense so you will take less damage on average by standing in melee range
---
***my grandfather wants to know your location***
---
I play TL and not gonna lie, I'd be pretty sad to get third age there. For that exact reason.
---
MMK said there were a few tiles that haven't been walked on since OSRS started, so that's pretty cool to think about after millions of people have had a go.
---
Efficiency and reliance on guides increasing is a contributing factor.
---
Would definitely be down for a project where everyone gets issued a square and has to walk on every single tile. Reckon it could be a funny RuneLite plugin but they'd be a bit hesitant to upload player data to each other.
---
Most d'hide boots look a lot better though, at least in my and many of my friends' oppinions. The only ones that I personally don't really like are the ancient and bandos ones.

Can you guys PLEASE let the ToB supplies chest always opened!? (If you try to open the chest, and someone else opens it before you, your character stops, and yeah.. its annoying)
---
I think on mobile you can hide certain spells etc, check through the spell settings (on the spell book page) and make sure everything is enabled.
---
Hope this helps 👍
---
Man that's wholesome and rage enducing at the same time
---
Thanks, sounds nice
---
I spend hours each week farming those capes just west of gdz. This is a multi hotspot and i pk there a lot. Ill always farm them in the offpeak and i normally go many sessions without seeing anyone. if it is a solo pker ill fight back with my insane mage gear and a bolt rag switch. I have over 10 brews and a bunch of food to combo eat. With the amount of worlds we have now it is hard to find people let alone be found lol.
---
Same issue. Saw it on Alfies task list too. Idk gonna do s couple more tasks and see but man i want those cosmics.
---
If it wasn't in a random location a keylogger could just send the coordinates of the clicks and your bank would be gone.
---
You do realise leagues isn’t just ‘area locked Ironmen - the gamemode’ and they can do other stuff right?
---
There is only one problem
---
Its *wildy*
---
i hate that argument, and the "imagine \_\_\_\_\_ in a &lt;name of the game that insults it the most&gt;"   whatever it is, it's what we choose to put our time into so that's what makes it important.
---
I actually think getting healers off jad might be easier on mobile, using your left thumb to click on healers while keeping your right thumb ready for prayer switching sounds easier than going back and forth with a cursor
---
Thats the only thing that sounds easier on mobile tho, its much easier to missclick on mobile and end up walking out of safespots, drinking a brew insteaf of a restore, switching to the wrong prayer etc etc
---
they most likely used a third party client for help. like openosrs
---
I was looking up a runecrafting guide cause i didnt know what to rc. Guess u have to do the same gl
---
I hope you have the air and mind runes in your inventory
---
The counter argument is that slayer becomes slow af, if it's all single way. 
---
 But I appreciate the sentiment behind the post, and the fact that greigers spoil the game for everyone involved.
---
A compromise position is that a couple of worlds remain multi way and single areas exist in remaining worlds.
---
Well there are high scores  for points/total level so that is technically a competitive aspect to the mode. 
---
Other than that you can buy cosmetics with the points you earn, people are speculating 100m+ for the slayer helmet item which wouldn’t be too surprising considering 6k points will take people 55+ hours to achieve. 
---
I personally don’t pvp at all so dmm didn’t have much of an appeal to me either. That said I’ve never had an Ironman but this game mode is a lot of fun and slightly frustrating at the same time.
---
that rsn though
---
I’ve been following Curtis for a few years now so I know him and all of his reactions.
---

---
the maze one is the best one besides the xp ones of course
---
wt has some bloomin loot for being literally free xp
---
What's the point in doing anything then? Your life is finite and everything you've grinded for on the main game is also just as pointless on your deathbed. If you spend what free time you have on something and enjoy it, it's not time wasted. 99% of games work like this too, where you gain no "permanent" advantages, it's mostly just a mechanism to keep you hooked in and feel like you're spending your leisure time "for a purpose", when that purpose should be to enjoy yourself.  
---
This game mode is really nostalgic for a lot of us and is giving people a lot of joy. As someone who is grinding the last few 90+ skills to max total on the main game, it's a great reminder of the best bits of the game - not efficient moneymaker --&gt; Buy skill --&gt; repeat, but exploring new areas and finding out about new content you had likely never bothered to try on zeah.
---
Hmm ed Sheeran or boaty?
---
Hard choice....

---
Got 2mill drop yesterday after 3runs
---
I've really enjoyed it! Great job guys
---
More than anything else, Twisted Leagues made me realise how damn good Zeah is.
---
I used to think Zeah was just a massive area with not a whole lot of interesting stuff in it. Now I see how good it is, the house Favour activities are a unique thing to do in RS, you can train pretty much every skill in a pretty efficient manner and the end game content in the region is enough to keep you entertained for a long time.
---
Zeah-only has been a great experience so far, it feels like what being a new player in Gielinor used to be, running around looking for the chicken pen or asking people which direction to the iron rocks.
---
I'm loving the game-mode so thanks for making it! I just wish I had more time to play it.
---
What do you think about making Leagues work a little bit like darkscape did when it shut down?
---
Namely, allow us to bring out 1/20th of the XP, or whatever is equivalent to half what we would have earned doing the activity in the main game. 
---
It's half of what you would've earned so there is still a trade off, and it gives less incentive to burn through usually annoying skills in a league.
---
You still can't bring out items, money, or anything. It'd just be a nice bonus for people who do something like spend 20 hours at WT. You'd at least get an hour or two of progress in the main game in exchange. Maybe more people will engage that way too.
---
finally got mine at 2288, at least its good money otherwise
---
They have been there for years, nothing new. Oh also sir pugger is not going to change anything lol
---
treat it seriously, get help

---
@JagexFlippy I'm loving it! I'm just running around Zeah like a complete noob, not looking on wiki and finding out everything by myself, it feels so good (I somewhat know the rest of OSRS world...)! Just one thing I'ld like to point out so far: albeit TL is great fun, don't make it too often - perhaps twice a year and enough, otherwise it might become boring, annoying for IMs, etc.. :)
---
Errm afraid to burst your bubble, but I think content creators are the influence of leagues with their area restrictions and mad goals. Compare swampletics and his work compared to your idea, sorry bud ;(
---
*clue goo
---
Its a private server lol
---
i think it was a dragon underneath lumbridge
---
They did. I added the filter, and the front page went from 95% Twisted League to 85%. There are far too many posts about it with the flair "discussion" or "humor" for it to be effective at all
---
But we also don't just do the same efficient path either, everyone is scrambling to figure it out because they don't know the right path in Kourend.
---
nah 11$ a month is too much, id rather put in 6 hours to get a months worth of bonds.

I watched her "ironman runecrafting guide"
---
After about 20 minutes of telling me different ways to acquire rune essence the video ended, not very helpful.
---
Some of her other videos have been more helpful though.
---
I'm not sure if this as already been addressed: but the ability to turn on/off relics would be nice. For example, I got the hardcore harvest which is nice for mining. But I hate it when I'm fishing so I would like to turn it off when fishing.

I've found that wd40 really revs to cause some degradation to the natural fibers of the snake. I prefer using natural oils to lubricate, such as coconut oil. You need to reapply more often, but it really helps maintain those natural fibers.
---
Starting down the road of getting barrows gloves through the Recipe for Disaster quest. Do the quests for farming, the farming guide on the wiki has a list. Unlock fossil island and miscellania. Varrock medium diaries.
---
Thats a huge variety of content and it will all be vital to your account and getting free income. I can explain anything btw
---
I think they should just severely limit the multi combat zones to bosses/raids right? On an entirely iron man server it only allows people to grief one another
---
Atm there is a few employees making tens of thousands everyday in w2 ddosing big stakes when they lose. 
---
They changed it back to where both players gets refunded their stake if server dc's  in the middle of a stake.
---
unannounced change like this together with a 30M hr no req method in one update, nice.
---
Oh okay mad, thanks for the response my dude, :)
---
Kind of hoping this is a joke.
---
You gonna let a video game cause you to behave this way.
---
Poor fucking girl.
---
For aerial fishing at least, hardcore harvester can be seen as beneficial because it triples the rate at which you can acquire molch pearls. For barb fishing it's definitely limiting if you wanted to afk, though.
---
I think it would be a good idea to give players the option to turn relics on or off through the relic interface. There are a couple of other relics like arcane courier where the autobanking can be annoying, and dark altar devotion which prevents you from getting dragon bones to fix the altar in the forthos dungeon unless you get noted bones from hydra or implings.
---
How much did you lose?
---
Mining lvl? How frequently do you get than many rune ores? Rare or common?
---
Went eith courier to afk the shit out of wc and fishing, loving it so far
---
It really isn't helpful though. It's like if you looked up a guide on smithing and it just showed you the best mining spots for various ores.
---
No he likely doesn’t realize this. People aren’t very imaginative at all apparently

So 27219 points = 3.137% chance for a unique
---
Tbow = 2/69 chance, = 0.09094%
---
Olmlet = 1/53 
---
So, correct me if im wrong, but the chance of this happening, with this amount of points is roughly 0.0017%
---
Damn

currently its 11pm and i gotta work tomorrow ill do my best to open the rest tomorrow glhf everyone.
---
Welcome to the game :)
---
Not sure if they did or not. It’s definitely still a crime but it’s probably a case of bigger fish to fry, so they went after the guy making bank off of illegal services vs the small fish.
---
They should just make them tradeable. The only reason people voted against making them tradeable in the last poll was because no-one really understood that bounty hunter points/emblems were going to become untradeable.
---
until life catches up and the hours you play isn’t worth the cost :(

👌🏼 They’re supportive :) Very blessed

The only quality I want is the HD graphics of 2011, they're the perfect combination of good looking and not too weird like the RS3 ones

Where do you find a rune pick in TL? 500k from 99 fm

Dual wield my fists? Nice.

Maybe I can dual wield rcb and shoot up the place
---
So your saying Misty the runescape playing girl is single now? Tell her to slide in my DM I got some splashing for her (;

Maybe as something exclusive to twisted league, definitely not for the main game.

Runecrafting guide:

Get these items, run to this altar, teleport out using this, bank like this

What's the difference between an ironman rc guide and a regular rc guide?  Ironmen have extra steps to get those items(rune essence)
---
Sorry that you didn't find it helpful but if I was looking up how to runecraft on an iron the #1 thing I would want to know about is the best way to get essence.

No.1 yes.

Only thing? No

I failed exactly 6 times and then beat it. The first 2 I didn't make it to Jad, mainly due to misuse of resources. Doing the flash Jad minigame helps a lot. I forget its exact name but if you Google practise Jad Runescape theres a website which you simulate prayer flicking for Jad attacks and gets you in the rhythm

Feels like I’m wearing nothing at all
---
Should of known better than to ask this community to be reasonable.
---
can you explain whatcha mean? cause as far as o can tell o just traded exp rates for resources in a mode with x5 exp. 
---
It feels like i just reduced my overall efficiency by taking this relic.
---
But in 2013 we had the original 2007 halloween event.
---
Thank you so much
---
How are you sure it's that and not twisted league?
---
IMO it helps that Zeah is so massive and widespread coupled with the fact that many players aren’t very well versed on its content, so there’s even more running than would be in something like Kandarin
---
Wait you mean to say a content creator with a ton of viewers might be more inferential than a random redit post with 1 comment and 2 upvotes?
---
so why was her character moving when she was afk jumping?
---
Not that high. Around 26 combat level.
---
I'm not too sure, i've only seen a handful of implings up there and haven't tracked them too far. I'd scout in this sort of area https://imgur.com/a/Ew6qQ4W
---
Is it though? It is fun, but it really depends on your goals, In my opinion clues are really only good for the first few days to get you that medium level gear. After that it's just a money maker for alchables and runes. Which isn't really important in a temp league with xp rates that make getting 99 a joke.
---
Fill you bank with fillers and it won’t go to your bank. If you have the ore/fish in your bank pull it all out noted.
---
The main reason I think endurance was a thing is because its almost impossible to train agility on zeah. If the next area we are in has an agility course then it would make less sense to give us endless endurance. Its nice to see the devs thought through the pros and cons of the area they picked and realized some of the limitations
---
Replace The Office, with Trailer Park Boys, or It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and we'll be golden.
---
Probably. I was less speaking on Rendi's situation and more speaking on the assumption that apologizing is the norm.
---
It *should* be the norm, but people really really don't like to take responsibility for their actions or admit to mistakes, it seems.
---
Same

Tedious does Zeah
---
i guess olmlet needs a pair of pants
---
And -8 range attack, which is also pretty big
---
DDS mouse... yikes

I was using a dragon axe as a weapon yesterday. I love the patchwork equipment everyone has.
---
Edgeville + Wilderness
---
You can function enough to read all of that, yet still "mess up" your typing claiming to be "so high".  ok
---
Is that really invalid? The response they gave was nonsensical because the design of the mossy key/bryophyta already has an association with slayer. To ask "why does everything need to be done with slayer?" is then effectively a self-criticism, and the solution is either to make it possible to do with slayer as the design partially intended, or to completely disassociate slayer from moss giants by removing the existing benefit from having a moss giant slayer task. I didn't like the answer they gave to the question because the answer didn't make sense in the context of the way the content was implemented.
---
"Everything" does not need to be done with slayer, but moss giants already have a strong association with slayer. Higher level players did not need to have reasonable access to moss giant tasks in the past because bryophyta and her staff were not needed for anything, but now they are. So I think it is a reasonable solution to provide an option to unlock moss giants as a task from duradel or nieve.
---
Alrighty i will check it out later :) current time salpetre is pretty empty got 10 imps in 10 minutes (even doe only 2 youngs)
---
You're right. It's actually 2, not 3 max hit. Keep in mind it's no pots or pray either.
---
Crystal hally higher dps according to bitterkojke dps chart lol
---
That d scim mouse cursor tho! I'm proud.
---
"Iron Grill" we call that a Fe Male, bro smh
---
If you want to do low level monsters via slayer use low level slayer masters
---
Awh, you cut off the part where she realized she got pet too. She had no idea until after she walked over to claim the Tbow and saw the Olmet slowly lagging behind her. This reaction was only to the Tbow
---
that comment was three months ago but I don't care. That's a silly comment. He spent a month, it go 400k views and still only made 50 dollars. its perfectly reasonable to call it a joke.
---
What you said is unreasonable.
---
Any chance we could get Right Click —&gt; Bury bones option for bone drops? Would make it less tedious with full inventories
---
There's a lot of zeah only accounts, people shouldn't be out off because somebody else has already done it, they should try and take different paths and try and do better however
---
Those players aren't gone, they're on holiday.
---
Every year around December a city near where i live dies down in activity for almost two weeks.
---
The city doesn't die, they all go back to normal after the holidays
---
I only mentioned it because they said "someone", so I was reminding them who it was.
---
Im not saying you havent done capes many ways.  I am saying youre mentally unstable and weak.  Stop being so dramatic about a game man grow up.
---
You sound like a daft fucking walnut here, grow a pair and get ready for a future instead of squeezing one off over some medival point-n-click.
---
Do you have the authority to make a deal like this? because I'm sure some overlap of demographics would support this deal.
---
You realize you are playing a 2007 reboot of a video game yea? That archaic mechanics are literally the one single thing that people wanted this game brought back for?
---
Locked behind 83 con bruh
---
No one thinks they're fake lmao. They're extreme yeah but of course hes going to react like that when hes in front of 1000 people and he gets something hes been working for for like 2000 hours. Almost every streamer does that.
---
Earn another 3M for a bond. There is a lot to keep you busy on P2P. 
---
-Have you completed all the f2p quests?
---
-Maybe camp the F2P bosses for uniques and GP.

-go clue hunting 
---
-train for base stats (all skills the same level)

HOly fucking cringe. It's just pixels calm the fuck down.

why do I find this Chad erotic

Actually, it doesn't say that in the rules, mate. And if it does then i've not got eyes.
---
Membership package?
---
As someone who's been playing on and off since 2007, twisted league had me playing the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep. It's ridiculous. I haven't felt like this in over a decade lol. It almost feels like I've never played it before. I bet the location being zeah was quite important tho because I've hardly even spent time in zeah lol. I'm worried for future leagues though because they need to find places that have a good mix of low to high level content for most of the skills. I think morytania is an obvious second choice but they gotta flesh it out a bit more
---
It's literally easier than tanking healers. You have to be braindead to not be able to click and run through him just as he starts an attack animation. And even if you fuck up there's a 1/3 chance he uses melee, and then a chance he doesn't 1 shot you.
---

For me that's BIS

In a few months Jagex are selling 3, 6 &amp; 12 month memberships for £/$

These are all OP, useless, or just ridiculous

They're already out.

Turns out depressed 25 year olds are less chatty than 11 year olds who just discovered miniclip
---
Listen u/JagexFlippy, this will probably go over your head but there are plenty of us that do not give a single flying fuck about this shit stained update. The actual game hasn't had any meaningful update in centuries and the last update   Bh2 is a complete trainwreck. 
---
Please do NOT waste anymore time in the future making another league and actually make some game updates.
---
*They’re already out
---
My bad it was in 2014.
---
Nice, been wanting this for a long time. Do you think the reddit meta will evolve to flaming players high on the boss kc highscores as well, or will we just stick to the regular highscores?
---
Cant go against the hive mind ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I've spent most of my league running around with a fucking rune dagger(p+) man. Times are wild
---
Premier club.
---
It’s a private server, who cares it shouldn’t even have an effect on the main game. So if it’s not purchasable it makes the content unobtainable for people who don’t care about something that will be reset in 2 months.  Sadly I’m on my 4th relic because if I want the rewards I gotta either pay or play! Kms with this private server shit
---
Support. I always wear a skillcape that's appropriate for the activity (such as farm cape for farm runs etc) and sometimes other pieces of armor, for rc, so it'd be nice. Also it's really an eyesore when 90% of people run around in full graceful. I mean the set itself looks pretty awful IMO (compared to old rs agile set), but to have \*everyone\* wear it... nah.
---
Small team, you’d rather see content like bosses and TL than a tidier log in screen
---

---
Really depends on what you want to do in game. When I was F2P my goal was base 40 stats and do all the quests. Personally I would buy a bond once you have completed this because membership offers much more in terms of gameplay, especially mobile. I often find myself doing afk things on mobile like fishing/cooking or woodcutting/fletching, kills time and I feel like I'm actually progressing. 
---
F2p pking can actually be a lot of fun, I personally wouldn't do it on mobile though lol
---
Checked your profile. You regularly make self posts on suicidewatch. I won't say more lmfao
---
You can clue hunt f2p? I haven’t played osrs since probably.... before that new continent or whatever with the houses, the most I have heard about since then was like a tbow spawn accidentally being placed somewhere or something. I had no clue clues were f2p? Also thanks for the response. Yeah all of my f2p quests are done that I’m aware of as well.
---
Look, you're not a PvE badass if you're a PvP scrub. Gear switches, prayer flicks, and timing are essential at high end PvE and are immediately transferrable skills in PvP with the only real difference being timing (which a PvE expert would quickly learn) and predictions.
---
If you're a good PvMer, you'll be fine in PvP against the average pker. Otherwise, you're probably just whacking slayer monsters with hardly any raids or even Cerberus kc.
---
Is that like the online version of self harm?
---
I can only half relate to this meme because I’m garbage at OSRS PvE
---
delete this
---
damn u beat my ironmans odium. i got arch 29, fanatic 9, scorpia 6
---
Snowball (the one she's using) is cheap but still good quality. By "the silver one" I assume you mean the Blue Yeti which is the next upgrade, after that if you want better mic quality you need to buy an XLR amp + a new microphone which is massively more expensive which if you're a small streamer isn't worth it. Unless your literal full time job is streaming and you're a partner it's not worth getting anything past the Blue Yeti for most people as you'd get more out of the stream from things like a better webcam with lighting etc
---
also there are probably different “efficient” paths depending on what relics you choose.
---
Personally i love lodestones in rs3 but I can understand why people don't want them. In rs3 regular spell teleports are almost never used. I'd probably be in favor of lodestones if they still had the cooldown because I wouldn't want to devalue spell teleports too much. With that being said its nice not having to worry about walking in rs3 and even with graceful yous till need tons of staminas for most things.
---
I love the cheesy thumbnails. They're so bad that they're good.
---
Can someone die from an endorphin overload? I imagine if its possible this is when it would happen
---
everyone knows the majority of irons would prefer a tbow to a 3a druidic robe top, but the point is tbow isn't the rarest or most expensive item in the game (which is what the guy claimed). 
---
it's pedantic, but he's right so idk what you're even trying to argue with him about.
---
The bad place deffinetly play OSRS
---
This seems like pissing and moaning. Not appropriate use of the dancing crabs.
---
They probably wont ever answer to this question. But i keep asking until they do or the issue is solved.
---
Chris Hansen?
---
aside from this pilgrim costume reward, I'd say the named Green, blue, purple, etc. pantaloons which I assume are treasure trail rewards, and the bluish holiday detective investigator legs from Django. I assure you there are more though.
---
Would be pretty cool - some motivation in addition to loot
---
Bis helm. Npc used to be safespottable, and that's supposed to be good thing because?
---
I disagree reason being is I’ve played almost 50-60 hours already and I’m just now coming up on my 5th relic. I don’t think half of the people playing will get much more then t5 if that which is only 5k points and the rewards are 6k and 10k for the higher end ones. At the very least the t3 set will be worth a lot more then likely. Most of these people will stop playing after the first month.
---
Yeah once new 2FA method is implemented I’m removing bank pin from normal game
---
Quite hard with full inventory, no?
---
Unless it's a streamer in which case it's totally fine.
---
I am a Spirit of Dinh boi.
---
I love it, personally. AFK'ing Wintertodt pretty hard right now and have SO MANY resources banked. Enough for almost 99 crafting (once I get 2x XP), very high smithing until I start blast mining, 99 fletching, almost enough cash and logs for 99 construction, more herb, watermelon and tree seeds than I know what to do with.
---
In short, it's an enabler for maxing/getting base 80's.
---
True
---
He’s a veteran runescape player from 05.... I’m pretty sure he can figure out his own way in game and is well aware of the waterfall quest.
---
Someone get that baby in bronze!
---
oh it just Jealousy specifically of Americans
---
It could make a really cool anthology to be all connected together at some point or another.
---
Thanks for the reply. Im sorry about the wording of my comment before, i did honestly just want to know if you played rs3 during it and didnt mean to sound snarky. I am personally split between leaving it how it is and something like what you said.
---
Race choices would be cool, too. Especially with the lastest elf city expansion.
---
Dude that's me too. I went to get the lava eel for heroes and accidentally clicked the bounty tab (I didn't know what it was) then this guy shows up out of nowhere and I'm just like "Hey I'm doing a quest" and he goes "Me too" then proceeds to kill me. 
---
I died saying "Bitch, I ain't a quest."
---
126?
---
The RS3 Subreddit has been up in arms for a while now because they want MTX free worlds and some mod said that would be a "drab" world. Quite nice memes honestly.
---
If you didn't take harvester and want smithing exp you shouldn't make steel and should instead mine iron and Smith with rings of forging. Cosmic runes aren't too hard to get from Sarachnis.
---
Honestly, just go LMS then. Right now it's 20 bots to 4 real players in a game, but some of the bots are advanced enough to switch prays and will rag bolt back. It's great practice to just get used to your switches, prayers and eating. Highly recommend it.
---
nah, they dont know if i just held it down
---
Twitter or instagram would be your best bet. My tag is @wizardelysian and if you have neither we can set up a different way of communication
---
Yea 2147m
---
My comment was nothing more than a friendly reminder of one of the best first quests to get stats up. Since he probably last did that quest in 2005 and haven’t played in years, I think my comment was appropriate. 
---
I’m curious what inspired you to try to shit on my comment, like I’m being an asshole or something?
---
What the fuck
---
What’s that other item? Is that a molten hot pocket?
---
Pls god ash, we need this. 
---
Bounty hunter replacement, Zuk will now be your PvP target
---
Rswillmissit made a shortfilm for RS3 if I recall correctly?
---
You could always make a mule account with all the normal security measures to store your gp on if you're that worried.
---
we play runescape
---
That would be 90 con = 99 smith
---
99 agility
---
I wanted to say the same but saw the comment section was biased.
---
I mean how lol
---
It's made up stuff that somehow gained traction.

Summoning increased the max CB to 138.

Viable statement but not always the case!

I don't believe you.
---
Does he have any other option?
---
Yeah, I sure didn't forget that hissyfit rendi threw on twitter during runefest, really lost a lot of respect for the guy honestly
---
I LOVE twisted leagues. I think its clear you guys took some inspiration from the /r/uniqueironmen that popped up over the last couple years, and as a very active member of the community who was kinda unsure about it at first I think you guys knocked it out of the park.
---
A lot of people here are saying that other area restricted leagues would not work due to lack of early game and end game in many areas, and while I think there are many ways to remedy this similar to how we started this leage with some levels and quests already complete I'd also like to bring your attention to the "chunk" syatem that has become a standard of area measurement within the /r/uniqueironmen community. Basically the 64×64 tile areas that make up each music track of the open world we call "chunks" and various restrictions can restrict you to certain chunks. This started with an account called 'one chunk man' by pookaguy on youtube where he had to complete everything within a chunk in order to move on to the next chunk. There have been a ton of accounts that have begun to use this as a unit of measure for even more obscure restrictions, such as Caveman Only's 'pray4time' account where he can only stay within the area of an altar and if he leaves he must have an overhead prayer on. If he runs out of prayer he drops all his stuff.
---
While I don't think either of these are great ideas for leagues due to the lack of content, the chunk system allows for non-contiguous areas to be restricted in a way that still makes sense. 
---
One way I can see this alleviating the lack of content in some areas is to allow for 'swamp only' instead of 'morytania only' for example, and could include other swampy areas of the game through a systematic and logical categorization of areas to group together parts of the map which share similar features but are not connected to one another.
---
Yes
---
Honestly just make 100% run a permanent feature in the main game. There's no reason not to. Or make agility decrease your run loss per second to a point where 99 agility never loses run
---
Aren't we catering enough to HDscapers or/and 2011scapers already :'(
---
Can't blame them, they've been pretty vocal about their distain of MTX. But of course Jagex is just going to add in more MTX into the game for RS3.
---
Really depends on your set up, to determine if DDS is better. If you're using bludgeon, DDS is a horrible spec weapon for cerb, since you're either not bringing a defender or bringing an extra swap for minor dps and it takes up an extra inv. CHally at cerb is a very legitimate suggestion unless you're in true BIS.
---
Go camp sulphur lizards for ores and nats. Another decent but more rng way is thru brimstone keys I got like 500 yesterday
---
Good meme
---
Wtf is that reaction
---
To be clear, it’s 2 million an hour IF you know exactly where to go, and have all items ready to go, all teleports available, AND you aren’t screwed over by not getting the boots.
---
If clue scrolls involve wandering around for 20 minutes with a hot/cold orb, it’s almost never going to be that profitable.
---
Almost her whole inventory is impossible to get in twisted league. Stamina pot, defender, trident, mage cape, dragon boots, hasta, bcp.
---
She's also wearing full armadyl, pegs, accumulator, and slayer helmet which are also not possible to get. Don't think that guy paid any attention whatsoever.
---
You're odd
---
i cant believe bernie would do this
---
He’s making his own money instead of telegraphing other people’s cash stacks
---
He knew about the clintons...
---
Yeah I’ve seen all the shit torvesta does during pvp and sounds too complicated for me dawg.
---
What is PVE?
---
I heard he was seen trotting around molch island with prince andrew......
---
I would recommend flipping items in the GE to earn enough money for a bond. It’s pretty easy on mobile since you can log in for 2 minutes to flip items every couple of hours.
---
I think we all just wanna know - was it worth it?
---
I'm talking more like consistent 90 grind which is now about 60k an hour max and worse than agility
---
man how tf are you guys soloing olm shes even just joking about it and makes it look easy
---
Cox speed runs or maxing stats
---
There would need to be quite a few million ironmen accounts with at least one kc on each boss for that to be statistically likely.
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
I want the Slayer cape one but the silver trim :(
---
They look so good though.
---
Uhh yes. Have you ever drank a bunch of Nyquil? It doesn't make your ability to read disappear instantly.

With bots making it no longer random we should change it so we pick what rooms, same game minus the bot and profiting from botting

Player Versus Environment. In Runescape, it’s synonymous with Player Versus Monster (PVM).
---
I'm gonna throw a challenge here. I think we can all accept that woox is by far the best PvMer in this game. Make him go against any good hybrid I'm willing to say he is gonna get his shit pushed in even with practise.
---
Warriors guild rng can be extremely rough at times, i'd suggest using runelite and putting the next defender as a highlighted item and checking the box to make a sound whenever u get a highlighted item. you don't even have to use the defender on the npc outside, just re-entering the door is good enough. gl on the grind.
---
Wow nice work! Well looks like I'm probably sticking to the lance till maxed melee
---
Why?
---
The problem is your ranking (and rewards) is solely decided by your points so in terms of an efficient meta, if you go for anything other than maximum league points (skilling), it's suboptimal. It's why I'm huge advocate of changing the way rewards work so it's not based on your league points.
---
Lmao
---
I like where you've shifted the goalpost, but can you please out it back? Or at least, since you wont, give some sort of backing to your statement?
---
appreciate the tip, i am mobile only so this is not an option for me but i will keep making sure to check every single dead cyclops
---
He was on a quest to kick your ass

This made me chuckle
---
Any ETA on next episode? I'm Jonesing
---
I believe you can still get it, it might be out of stock though unfortunately.
---
Just checked the drop chance for the pieces and they're a lot higher than I thought. You are right, I am wrong.
---
It still wouldn't surprise me if it has happened though. Not everyone uses Reddit or other online services to share stuff like this.
---
Something has to be wrong here. Though I don’t assume you’ve made a mistake 12k tokens is a huge amount of time when converted. Very odd indeed.
---
Healthier than not doing anything fun.

*How's this for sum twang!?*

I got 2 dragonstone bracelets and 1 ring from an elite clue

Ring of life my friend.

Not sure about that number, it varies by level and I'm sure one would do much better at 99 but starting from 38 I did it to 55 or so and averaged 2 an hour, got rogues at 50
---
They changed hydra to just drop the lance
---
Definitely a next step but you’re right it would be an undertaking. Do you know what the current lowest is?
---
It was cheaper than buying gamecube games every once in a while in my parent's point of view i guess.
---
I think your point is also flawed because only about 15% of the players on OSRS are in TL worlds so it’s definitely not “the whole community” nor is reddit a good example of the community as a whole.
---
I haven’t done any bosses :)
---
If you don't already have 15 construction the lamp really helps
---
My second task was banshees when I was 16 combat. I tried once, died, then talked to konar again. She gave me a new task and said "you don't seem equiped for your current task"
---
I don't know if you have to die first or not but I got a new task and it didn't reset my streak or require points.
---
Welcome to the club
---
If a hacker was looking for a target, they could already just sit at ToB bank and write down the names of everyone with a Twisted Bow. Anyone high on the leaderboards for Master or Elite Clues probably has a pretty sizeable bank too.
---
I know, that's why I said I thought the weight reduction was overkill. If you don't need all of the weight reduction you wouldn't have to wear full graceful
---
I thought so! Thanks for confirming my suspicions.
---
About time!!!! Thank you!!! Maybe I’ll finally get back into the game with this and pick up gwd again!
---
In case you haven't done them you should get mm2 and fairytale 2 done. Getting diaries done is super helpful. I'd say your next big goal should be Elite Void. It gives you a goals to complete and has you do some Skilling, questing and keeps you active.
---
Next time you need to reward someone for something Jagex, please use these beards as unlocks if possible.
---
My dude do you like...do art commissions or something
---
Probably because Pvp takes more than just muscle memory like the rest of OSRS lol.
---
Sound Tube Brown lol wtf

They’re both 3 xp short for 5.4
---
I only trio with my lower lvl irl friends.

Remove (change) graceful. Buff effects of agility levels.
---
Were they asking why you needed to Claim your points rather than them being automatically applied? That's an engineering issue; they have said that they want to change that next time but didn't get around to fixing it for this one.

Where are my testicles, Summer?

I think OP is saying this was the 2007 Christmas event, not the 1st RS2 Christmas event.
---
OP, and he thinks it would improve the game.
---
It's a suggestion thread, guys.
---
As someone who primarily PKs, I'm loving this gamemode and am fully committed. I'd appreciate if next time they considered adding a "BH" area that had similar tasks and would reward some league points. Botters/target sellers would likely ruin that too, sadly.
---
It could be a finite source of a small number of points to discourage farming. How to encourage people to play it right? Possibly add a minimum risk with guaranteed loss on death. Or it could have no loss whatsoever, so playing it in rags would be pointless and vulnerable to someone trying hard.
---
It’s a meme don’t worry haha
---
Can we decant pizza slices and cake slices?
---
So far one of my favorite aspects is the T2 hardcore harvester, the 1-tick farming cycles and filling up an inventory of herbs from a harvest of 5 is so thrilling! I’m a huge fan of farming so this has been a huge piece of content for me.
---
League has really opened my eyes to the potential of house reworks. I don’t know if it’s just my play style but ive spent 90% of my time (750 points) in just the Hosious house so far. Been doing a mostly skilling build with a heavy farming concentrate so it makes sense but there’s literally such much content right there it’s amazing!
---
I love seeing all the players around training together, saw a wave of 300+ people barb fishing last night and it was one of the coolest things I’ve seen on OSRS
---
Thank you so much for an amazing update and revitalizing the old school experience for me. As someone who’s been playing since 2003 this has felt very fresh and become a very wholesome experience !
---
Of course it is, I have my big red 'HACK' button right beside me.
---
Scammed get rekt nub L0L
---
Can any jmod specify what sort of hardware specifications a single world (server) requires under average load? Is 2000 players reasonably stressful on these servers? Do high apm things like House Parties and Blast Furnace have a significant effect on world load/performance?
---
How has this changed over the years (compared to the early Pentium 2 years)? Has it gotten more or less demanding, or has it always been pretty much the same considering network bandwidth is probably the only thing that needs to change?
---
same. ~2500-3000. technically it can take you another 99k till you get iron. but yeah. just really bad luck. grind on sir.
---
It’s only 6 dollars a month for membership.
---
Nah I'm pretty sure gp swapping is fine.
---
I think it’s about a balance thing not about a “I like the monotony” thing. 
---
People don’t want illusions about what other players are wearing for a variety of reasons
---
About the same for me. Max combat, 99 slayer. I've done cox 300 times. 
---
It's either go for a rich bank (but what's the point) or do Skilling for max cape that I definitely don't enjoy doing
---
I feel you, I hit 78 thieving before I got the talisman at stone chests today from 64 on Twisted
---
Just plant the crop first
---
I’d like to see a pvm tier list cause what would be considered harder than 3-manning bandits but easier than inferno/TOB/Cox
---
When I did my hard diary it took me like two weeks to do the agility training alone.  Mainly because agility training sucks soooooooo bad, but still.
---
Some people die from their own mistakes too.
---
As well as everyone being hyper efficient so they’re either 3Ting and aren’t paying attention/can’t respond or they’re playing on like 4 accounts and the same applies.
---
Not a fan of FFAs. Unless you have max everything, you won’t get the kill
---
Wow, thank you for the advice! Yeah I wanted to focus on slayer and combat but was starting to feel like it was unrealistic. I guess I just have to hold out for the late game, because it'll be so exciting once I have the early stuff done. I had heard that there was no place to buy blood runes at all, so knowing I can buy them is VERY helpful. And I'm sure once I have some teleports life will be much easier
---
Ty. Was thinking of taking it for the pet chance.
---
Great cropping skills
---
Yea, I don't believe this one bit. What about mobile players? There's a lot more than 1k mobile players + bots + valinna users
---
I read another person's comment that convinced me to stick with this rune for the late game, but thank you for your perspective
---
I believe you can do this on resizeable mode already, but not on fixed mode.
---
Assuming all of your chances are correct, then yes, I also get ~0.0017%. 
---
And to bring it back to ratio form, that's 1 in 58,289 (rounded up), or ~1/60k.
---
Because a normal human being cannot kill Vorkath over 2000 times in a single week, and even if you're gonna argue that a player *could* it's not like Jagex would need to automatically ban the account that got that many in 7 days automatically, it'd just point them in the direction of the accounts that they should investigate. 
---
However this would accomplish nothing when it comes to accounts that already have thousands of kills but aren't running a Vorkath bot anymore.
---
Imagine banning third party clients without improving the vanilla client first lol. Realistically, 3pc probably saved Jagex hundreds upon hundreds (likely more) of hours in dev time and the money associated to that time over the years. Which is why vanilla is so bad; Jagex got complacent until it became a “problem.”

Do you know why Mika is doing that? He seems to regret it because his main account is pretty bad and broke as a joke.
---
Ok overreact andy
---
Why is this sad?
---
You got any buckets?
---
R word won’t make the front page sadly
---
Agility recovery is abysmal. Level 99 agility is over 4 minutes for full energy which means even they still use staminas and energy potions. This idea gives new players an easy way to restore energy before they can access energy potions. 
---
I feel like jagex either needs to make a new recovery item or tweak the regen rates on agility and this idea just seems way easier and less controversial than tweaking an entire skill
---
That's silly they can just consult people and get the facts and recreate that content. They scroll the sub a LOT for me to not be able to summon my fuckin wolf
---
Clues are seen as completely optional, "take it or leave it" content by the vast majority of players. So nobody gives a shit if you have a super low rank in Clues. On the other hand, PVM is the most popular content for the most part. The GE bankstanding PVMers love to rag on people with low Slayer levels for "playing the game wrong".
---
I feel like making information like this public will have them accusing people of being outright mentally challenged instead of just making fun of them. I feel that this will spread more toxicity through the community rather than showcasing accomplishments.
---
I get that I'm probably just projecting here and I am kind of an outlier, but I'm not ashamed to admit that I don't do much bossing. It's just not something that I have gotten into much yet. On top of that I have a high total level but pretty low Slayer. This isn't because I'm shit, it's because Slayer has gotten a **SHITLOAD** of updates since I decided to actively go for Max cape. The skill is significantly more fun and rewarding than it used to be. I decided to save Slayer as one of my last skills to help me prevent burnout near the end of the road to Max. I'm not "playing the game wrong" like these people make fun of me for.
---
My fault for choosing to play the way that I do, but this update will paint a huge target on my back. It doesn't really matter much or affect gameplay, but I will be running into a lot more toxic players going forward.
---
Sounds like my ex after I broke up with her for the first time
---
Could have gotten it quicker at the ZMI altar but gz
---
Can you build a pool in TL?
---
This fear over your username getting you hacked is absurd. Everyone who's top on the XP hiscores currently almost definitely has a bank worth billions of gp, and none of them are getting hacked just because their username is listed there.

Was wondering about that the other day, turns out it shouldn't require engine work. https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1194923152146460674
---
So in 6 days you got 200m firemaking exp and 99 construction? 
---
Please go outside
---
Players who choose not to boss much and have high combat levels are going to have massive targets on their backs now. I legitimately hate this change.
---
I've never seen someone die on the hill this tiny.
---
he ain’t the dramatic one here fella
---
What about 2 pets as well?
---
You can totally just ignore it...
---
Are you out there currently non-stop grinding runecrafting and agility XP because you feel a desire to compete with the people on the XP leaderboards? Or do you just completely forget they exist most of the time like everyone else?
---
Idk what else I can tell you :/
---
so for fire making as a example, I assume 50k exp would turn to 10k on the real server. as that how much you would have gain on the real server with x1 exp. Though yea, it should be even lower as there are relic that speed up certain actions/timing/exp such as farming/slayer/banking. so 10% would be quite all right, for my example before that would be 5k fire making xp. which is still pretty fair. as for the extra double xp relic, it would have just been further times down to go by to x1. Though look like my comment was downvoted so I guess too many people hated the idea.
---
Thanks preciate it! Yes, Kevin_dtattoos, from Cherry street ink, Macon GA. :)
---
I went to 83 with mahogany tables due to a lot less clicking even though it costed more
---
Stuff like this fucking scares me
---
You can do that, but you also have to admit that high combat players who choose not to boss are going to have targets on their backs for toxic players to rag on them. You can ignore them, yes, but you'll have a lot more to ignore now.
---
Dork
---
Depending on the relics it would be the same as getting 10m-40m fm xp.
---
I like the idea of it. Kind of like a purified water restores energy instead of just regular water. It even gives a use for fire making. The main idea behind this is that there needs to be an energy recovery method 1 tier below energy potions that new players can use before losing interest in the game because they just walk everywhere.
---
Oops lol. Fair
---
&gt;the lizard chests are only a bit of an xp improvement since you'll frequently get teleported outside. The crafting xp is great though.
---
I'm planning to do this soon.  I assume crafting xp is from gems and xerician fabric?  If so, how did you handle banking those materials from molch. I'd guess farming guild is closest, if you have 45 farming?
---
Why aren't they polling this in game? It impacts everyone but not everyone has a Twitter account, and I cba to make one just for this. 
---
Although it's obviously an extremely minor issue and I really don't care how they decide to order it, just think it's cool they're adding it
---
I brought a 1000 bones on my HCIM and never got attacked once. I mean pkers logged in and I assume they would kill me if I didn't log, but I didn't get caught once. I did the bones over two days also, took a break if I encountered many pkers.
---
I always wear dhides of some sort cuz i feel like wearing rune is asking to be pked by a mage
---
She’s an ironwoman.
---
Hespori seeds may only be planted in the cave in the farming guild
---
Construction is a bad example. Have you ever worked with wood? There is almost no skill difference when working with oak or mahogany wood. They're both hardwoods with similar properties.
---
You’re acting like getting that much firemaking exp + 99 construction in 6 days is acceptable
---

I will in the future I think, I just like the idea of getting the first one through hard work and dedication. I grinded hard as a kid on the game and would have been able to get a membership with gp for sure back then.
---
How much do you charge for these?? :o
---
Yes there are instances there but they seem very random, one minute its full the next you find a empty instance, the problem is just you cant control it and you can walk in and out for quite a long while before you get a free instance.
---
Message me and we will talk!
---
I like it being Zeah because even though I have a nearly maxed level main with millions of gold and boss kills, Twisted League feels like a brand new experience. Most of Zeah is unexplored to the casual player and having an account locked there really makes you come up with and devise very interesting strategies to progress your account.   It truly feels like the first time I ever played runescape way back in 2004 and was discovering things on my own and getting help/giving help to other players.

I know this whole Epstein thing's a meme at this point, but I find it infinitely more believable that a couple of guards working overtime were lazy idiots than a massive conspiracy theory that would involve dozens of people to kill a guy and make it look like suicide while he was in a high security prison.

I think it's to do with the upcoming double xp/promos on rs3. Because while they've been in a steady up trend for a long time you can currently get membership for free with twitch prime, so it's the only explanation for them still skyrocketing right now.
---
Runescape used to be about pking, now it’s filled with pve casuals
---
who?
---
No cooking pet
---
It is. You can see the calculation I used above. The chance of each specific shard is 1/256, which is what the calculation above uses. The formula doesn't take into consideration the chance of dupes, it looks specifically at getting each of the three individual shards that make up the odium ward.
---
Regular teams are only good to 65. Then you unlock sulliusceps. That's a good 100k xp an hour, and you get fossils for the varrock museum display. Finishing the fossil display is worth 120k in xp lamps (booyah suck it runecrafting). From 75-85 I finished museum and made like 400k gp from numulite.

I think it's more like they knew he was going to kill himself and let him do it rather than Hillary Clinton wearing mission impossible gear, sneaking in and snapping his neck herself or whatever people believe. But look at any other prison and how they deal with people on suicide watch. And nobody even cares about those people. They can't give the same treatment to the highest profile prisoner in the entire country?

yeah literally that was his chance to say "yeah whats ur snap ill prove it" lmao

I currently run hill giants because the experience is great and I get roots for like 18k per run [50/55/50]. Will P2P be more profitable? I'd love to get a bond but 5 mil in 2 weeks is currently impossible for me.
---
Because they think trump kicked him out of his hotel for being a pervert.

The title of the post legit suggests that the music cape, champions cape, and trimmed achievement diary cape receives max cape variants??
---
Rangers aside, your page luck was pretty good.
---
And in RS3 run drains as slowly as if we had stamina even at 1 Agility. It's free and permanent for them.
---
In both games we use Agility for shortcuts predominantly. The difference is, unlike in RS3, we can't afk agility with Silverhawks. Fuck off with trying to make OSRS look more easyscape than RS3. Even with graceful and stamina, it's not.
---
Yeah, I thought it was endurance as well but everyone was saying that accumulator was the way to go. 
---
But accumulator is useless later in the game, devotion seems good but is there another way to train prayer? If so that's the way to go.
---
I think what he means by rs3 alt is an account you play simultaneously while playing your osrs account to make money to then swap over to rs3. If you just want to swap money you already have, rather than making more money, it doesn't really matter that you use the same account. Personally I'd always make a seperate account for osrs, because if you happen to get banned in osrs your rs3 account is banned too. Also, if you happen to reconsider later and thus want to use rs3 as a money making alt, you'll really regret using your rs3 acc for osrs. Theres no real downside to using a seperate account other than not using left over member credit, not using the same name or if you want to play both games casually (not at the same time) and want to save a few bucks on membership.
---
Yeah. Now you can imagine how insanely much coins they keep printing at Jagex. No wonder Venezuelans feel at home.
---
now that you're at 200m fm, do you think dinh is worth it overall? i haven't started the wt grind yet, waited for artisan and now i'm getting food since i didn't do it at 10hp. i'm more interested in the clue one, but the triple loot from wt seems really nice
---
What I love about this is with everyone being IM's is when you see sick gear you're actually impressed, rather than assuming they bought it before being shown otherwise.
---
Found it thanks, was in the runelite add-on
---
If we are really talking meta here, then get fishing so you can get anglers. Lobsters are way too low healing. If you just want a kill, can probably do it with mediocre stats. Full rune or dragon and pray mage.
---
The same thing is happening to me man, you're not alone!
---
Messaging you :)
---
Probably not mostly solos since she's suiciding in brews. Looks like she's just starting to learn those.
---
they can have the rewards, notably the trophy, be based on # of players in the group. it's part of the group ironman plan in general to have hiscores be separated by group size, so this would be in line with their goals.
---
That would have made agility pointless for everything besides, what, 5 shortcuts?
---
How long does this usually last? til christmas ?
---
It would probably be like Monty Python and the Holy Grail
---
I'd honestly say this is a problem more akin to games with close relationship to twitch, or are high competitive by nature. If you try something like DotA having no idea how to play like I did you'll quickly learn that at least our people are doing it for the luls half the time.
---
What do you do if you get a non bursteable task ? You skip every other? What if you run out of points?
---
I'll allow it.
---
Do you ever not put that shitty logo on your pics?
---
if you really wanted to spend the extra money use it to barrage magic levels, 79 is really low. you really really should get a MA2 cape too cause the magic bonus is pretty big.
---
Aye asking to pay to play a game twice a year for two month is greedy haha. I had completed stopped playing before twisted came out. I was going to buy a years worth of membership but I'll just pay whilst it's out. I bet lots of people will do the same. It's pay them well to have it running a lot with small breaks
---
You get hit off pray way too often for me to care

Idk about cameras but I've read Englishmen(?) back in 1800s perfected the hanging technique where they measured the person's weight and the length of the rope so they could always get a neck snap.

You could either suffocate, snap your neck or literally decapitate depending on the length of the rope / weight of the body.

---
Is the droprates for stuff in league lowerd or something?
---
Also people are getting better at making gp combined with less people joining RS and throwing real cash away the game
---
Pet takes priority over the resource in this case. You don't need to worry.
---
I've stopped looking at 50,000 but let's say that's all the people playing leagues, which it isn't. That's £700,000 minimum in gross revenue. ( in two months) (4.2M a year) So why would it be greedy or "too much dev time" to have this running year round?
---
I searched once more at 75,000 and there are still players there. That's £525,000 in one month at £7 membership, obviously bonds are £8 for a month so it's not totally right.
---
all in the name of low level inferno capes too
---
Yes, one major error you've made is, the experience per armor item is 10exp/bar used. You've listed the smithing level as the experience instead. T1, T5, doesn't matter. You only get 10 smithing exp per bar used when making the equipment.
---
The set bonuses are correct and still apply, but the Smith exp per set is 220(smelting bars) + 110 (smithing) + bonus.
---
Still a good catch for Smith exp I think
---
EDIT: From 53 to 99 Smithing, switching to the highest tier you can make, would require 11,619 coal and 5,810 lova ore. For anyone curious. With 10x boost
---
Nah suicide for your own bones to train prayer.
---
We blow our homies here
---
10m is a fucking lot lol
---
A lot just look like blobs
---
Lmao, when's your next "attempt" video?
---
Dude wtf are you talking about. I didnt say i was using the bones on the altar and meanwhile went to my local store or some sht. Obv you have to be ready for pkers to log in. I'm just calling out the obvious bs that ppl claiming they do 1-99 prayer all in one go or some sht and NOT ONCE got attacked.If you spend more then 5 mins at that spot pker is going to log in. YES you log out great obvious, but to claim that "I went to 70 prayer or 70 - 99 and NOT ONCE did any pker log in or try to kill me" just sounds like an obvious bait."Yes guys log in i have my accs waiting. Nononono trust me this isnt so bad, i have never in my life got attacked there once."
---
Just dont believe idiots like that
---
Did you actually read it? It was... Pretty mild. One post basically saying "Dang I worked hard. Sucks that I didn't win." then Settled saying something along the lines of "You lost, get over it." And then him implying a 2 minute video wasn't better. Certainly not graceful, but it's not like I'd call it a "hissyfit".

There may not be a technical reason to wait and do a group Ironman league first but there are possible financial incentives. As OP mentioned a group IM league could help hype up the group game mode and get people to subscribe to try with friends who previously were not planning to participate. After the league they could release the game mode for real and keep players subscribed for longer. I’m not an expert in the area and have no data to work off of so I’m not sure if that actually would make financial sense for them but I’m sure they have people analyzing subscribing numbers, etc. who would know better.

Yeah but you don't need to reset your mains stats to play alternative accounts. And the point of HCIM is to not die so it's reasonable to stop playing if you do, those aren't really equivalents. 
---
Throughout OSRSs history the playerbase has always been apprehensive about gamemodes that reset after a period of time, original DMM not transferring your OS stats, Seasonal DMM, heck even the beginning of OSRS people were salty that their RS3 stats didn't transfer to OS. 
---
It's mostly due to the nature of the game and how long questing/grinding takes to get an account to a respectable standing. I'm not saying it's a massive difference between communities but it's noticeable.

Me too, but I'm sure it'd need to be polled. It's possible they could make an even better nexus with more teleport space for a higher con level too
---
I like thinking it's on the backlog more than when people would ask if x minigame could be remade for Osrs to be told "no it would take too much effort to try to recreate the game you loved we would rather make minigames unique to us."

(This bothered me more when LMS 1 was the only unique minigame since LMS 2 seems much more enjoyable)

Actions to fill the inventory do not affect xp/h in the slightest when you do not bank. When you train woodcutting just for exp, you drop the logs. When you train mining just for exp, you drop the ore. When you train fishing, you cut/drop the fish.
---
You get the exact same amount of experience per action and the same amount of actions per hour, which are the only things that affect your exp rate.
---
He said it was cool but not gonna put the effort in to try because his base case scenario would only be to match this guy at 16cb
---
He was really upset when we told him it wasnt best in slot as well...
---
You can also build one in your house. I check mine there mostly
---
Only problem i see with that is that skilling isnt gonna give u tons of bones
---
Forgot to add that in, my HP would be 99. Yup, I had a brainfart and forgot about the bracket I was asking about, haha. Avoiding PvP then. 
---
Thanks!
---
i know, and if there was, it hopefully wouldnt be that
---
&gt; Sourc How does a security camera point to the wrong direction though, or becomes randomly 'too grainy'
---
My source is every single news article from a reputable source talking about this camera thing. Every single one will be using the phrase that the "footage is unusable" unusable footage ≠ broken cameras.
---
And I don't know *exactly* why the footage was unusable, I'm just spitballing here, but they might not be pointed the "wrong" way suddenly, but the area of the prison they are filming might just not show anything interesting to the case. And any camera can become too grainy if the lighting isn't just right.
---
Shit, the camera footage could just be "unusable" because it's too low-res to show faces or a low frame rate. There are a million more likely options than some hitmen disabled the cameras, or the whole fucking FBI was paid off to pretend it's unusable.
---
My decision to choose Resilience was because of it's benefits over Focus. As one of the JMods said, with resilience I can indefinitely keep my overhead prayers active. With a higher prayer bonus, I can keep an additional one or two prayers active, giving me a permanent damage buff and accuracy buff, while still allowing me to protect myself and afk.
---
I haven't really decided what my end goals are yet, but I'll probably be alternating between afk slayer and doing some raids.
---
Why those stats? If you want to be a tank in PK your gear will matter more imo. As in barrows armor or even justicar. This requires max 75 defence. 
---
As a def pure your KO potentional is very limited. Im thinking of dfs decharge, or rather using ranged then obby maul. Since ranged wont up your combat as much as str and you can stack people with specials, rather then a 1 hit for a third of pures their hp at your suggested combat.
---
So 75 def instead of 99 will lower your combat, therfore lower your bracket and lower your opponents hp since theyre lower level.
---
Sqme for prayer, why? A defence pure is a big niche so using ut for pk AND voss AND..... isnt ideal at all.
---
why is 99 construction bis cape ? Cant really use any teleports with it besides the kourend portal righT?
---
That number can drop below 100?
---
Uhh..??? He didn't even address it.. monkaW
---
dank
---
why do you write out Venenatis but use bear instead of Callisto? genuinely curious if there's a reasoning behind it or just what you naturally do.
---
yes, people use this as a counter argument, but the guards were STILL required to check on him every 30min (but they did not check for hours)
---
Well, on a place like Reddit, yes. Telling somebody on Reddit that you don't like a word they used won't change that person, all it does it look like you're trying to get upvotes for not using a word, especially if it's used in a meme as posted.
---
Ewww buckethelm, should had been wearing a giantboothelm
---
Goodbye.
---
ah I only close runelite on Thursdays after the update. 
---
Speaking of i should probably restart my computer.
---
Your experience rates for each armor set is incorrect
---
How is it not?
---
Rendi back to being irrelevant lmfao.
---
Thank you. I thought I was going crazy. they already fixed it and I didn't see other people talking about it. 
---
I actually wish they would just restart the poll because it actually changes how I vote when I thought I had to choose between the pet recoloring and the easier spice collecting both of which I wanted.
---
By the way I cannot trade, because of the Ironman restriction that this account is bound by
---
How do you get skillcapes in TL?
---
sound the virtue signaler
---
The reason I said. Its already the best t2 for max points it doesn't need a buff
---
Whats wrong with this relic? Seemed good to me i was gonna pick it
---
Trimmed diary cape already implies music cape and quest cape
---
Champions cape makes no sense to include with the other ones
---
w00t
---
Now for runelite mobile then humanity will have peaked
---
Thank you sir!
---
Now he knows new methods!
---
I upgraded the staff as soon as it ran out, then I refilled it later when I was doing regicide
---
You know what would make this even cooler? Getting an awesome print out and tacking it over the top of the board then having the pins/keyrings on it. *cough Swampman *cough
---
It seems pretty balanced from a reward standpoint between and endgame of clue hunting, skilling to 99s, and PvM/CoX.  You can easily get to the 6k-15k point mark with any endgame you want.
---
Top 10 Anime comebacks
---
Ok so apparently you haven't heard of tick manipulation methods. You really should do a bit research before stating things that are noy true as facts. 
---
The cut/drop does not take game time as they are free actions. You catch a fish every 3 ticks, meaning 1,8 seconds. You have 1,8 seconds to drop/cut the fish, and then you get another one and repeat. This means that you are not spending even one second longer doing the same action as you normally would.
---
The same thing for mining and woodcutting, even though the former is very intensive.
---
Lol obviously
---
i admitted i lost 2 invs of bones, ive been attacked somewhat often but almost always by the time i die i get all of my bones used. people act like every time you tele there youll immediately get jumped and thats just unrealistic. Also i have tried pking there and it takes so long to find fights lmao
---
Yeah he's a pussy slayer now
---
They said in a q and a once that the Nexus has more space for this very purpose incase other teles are gonna be added so I'm guessing it'll come with the update free
---
Because the first thing you need to steal my account is my username.
---
No that's just how thos community acts whenever an iron asks for some qol
---
Can’t wait till my hunny in game gets a load of the gooch brush
---
F to your ppots
---
what do you mean?
---
Just put a cap in the stakes like 1mill or something.  No one gonna stay there all day, hopefully lol
---
Kemp's still trying to figure out 19 cb fc
---
they could knock down the requirements for metal armor. rune should be like the req for yew bows.
---
I’ve recovered and nothing stolen!
---
Wow seriously?
---
When all the relics were updated at the wiki for all 5 tiers of relics, I thoroughly did my research on the pros and cons for every single one for my tier 3-5 choices. 
---
I currently have about 1750~ pts left until I get my 5th tier unlock, and my eyes are still glued at picking Resilience.
---
So really what you are asking about is just, immensely boosted xp rates?  
---
It seems we kinda have a problem with enjoyable midgame content if everyone feels like they HAVE to "max" to play the normal game.
---
Probably hung herself cause her son was in a PKing clan I know I would
---
this is exactly my experience, except i go naked (maybe with a cheeky dds for fun)
---
my favorite thing to do is say "please off i have nothing ill pay 500k" when i get jumped on with like 3 bones left lol, gets their peepees hard
---
Listen, if you don't complete all collection log slots in trouble brewing, you haven't best the game, and I don't wanna hear no different 😤

Imagine getting offended on the Internet

Assuming 77 pray and max hp/range/mage:
---
50-99-99: combat 107
---
60-85-70: combat 99 (what I'm going for)
---
60-85-99: combat 107
---
75-99-75: combat 109
---
75-75-99: combat 107
---
I think there are a lot of possible options here. I've done a lot of research for my own accounts. I'm mostly interested in PKing though and most people figure there isn't a big difference between 70 def and 99 in the wilderness.
---
&gt; Though I don’t assume you’ve made a mistake
---
Its almost guaranteed that he did.
---
12k tokens is 20 hours(some lost to going in and out of the room)
---
Even if he only kills 1 cylopse per minute which is very low, that would still be 1200 cyclopses. Which is atleast 1 in a million, 1 in 10 mill+ if he manages to kill 3 in a minute which is normal. 
---
Sure people win the lottery, but way more people play the lottery, there hasn't been a million people getting their defenders. Its very unlikely specially considering he is playing on mobile, might have missed drops, might not have talked to the girl outside. Its possible, just not probable and I can't be convienced that this did happen.
---
That's why I also suggested seasonal modes, with each new season resetting and having a new concept.
---
I have no idea who you are but you seem like you need to get outside and just breathe. This comment is clearly just trying to put a bad aide on your original.
---
I like this better than rendis and kempqs. It was more entertaining for me
---
Time to rise and shine!
---
Yeah I didn't like this, I voted yes to both because I wanted both but I can't really pick my preference. No votes are so strong it doesn't take much for it to fail the 75% threshhold, and what happens if both choices fail? Then we get neither.
---
Also as others have mentioned, it looks like they mixed up the questions.
---
Dude you just need to know when to walk away and not say anything

What is the minimum amount of playtime to be considered for ranking twisted league? A lot of players logged in for less than an hour, and as a result I feel that my rank is skewed higher than it actually is

Dude, if you're interpreting "You just made rendi cry irl" as *cruel*, maybe you shouldn't be in this sub....
---
Yeah thats absolutely not what my comment said but if you can't read I won't bother explaining it to you.
---
We need some Reddit geniuses to decipher this for us
---
I have all this, I'm not done.
---
It means the same order as the boss log ingame (on ring of wealth or in poh)
---
CaveMan Mode. All cave  and underground areas are connected without needing to visit the surface.
---
I wouldnt even use my d pic if I had this!
---
I mean, people already do !kc (insert boss here) to flex their kc in-game, so some people already care about their hiscore in it, so I don't see how this is much different.
---
You usually block the high weight shit tasks, then skip the lower weight shit tasks. There are usually a few tasks you can't burst but can cannon or are just so quick they're worth to do. An example of the latter is black dragons - you kill like 20 and the task is over.
---
Personally, I block burst tasks all the time because I don't care about efficiency. I just do the tasks I enjoy.
---

I'm actually afraid of pulling a 3rd age axe/pickaxe rn

Did not a single employee proofread the questions before they made the poll live??
---
Thanks beast always appreciated
---
Trade in 50 of each. Open everything up. Price check that against what the mole parts are worth on GE. Its a small sample size, but it should give you an idea if its worth it.
---
i know i should. I even have my OS on an SSD I just never remember to.
---
The only boss I've done a lot of is Hespori. It'll be interesting to see where I place when this is implemented.
---
 Important to set up Safe spot -   1.Spider agro'd on you so it doesn't move.  2. No one walks over spider so that it blocks clouds coming from the South/West  Got 30% favor in this spot without taking damage
---
I am aware you still have to use the bones on the altar. It's still trivially easy to get 1.5-2 bones/tick with runelite, whereas similar speed and precision on default client will have you be barely pushing one. 
---
The other two plugins are pretty overpowered; the subreddit is full of people who just want the game to be made trivially easy for them. Look at the most recent poll and the overwhelming support it's getting here when some questions are obviously terrible ideas (e.g. arceuus teleports in POH).
---
Just a reminder, Jagex is a barebone company where everything extra is sapped off to the investors.
---
They have about 4 million pounds every year that is spent on the game. rest is given out as dividends to investor('s)
---
While it would be cool to have group ironman leagues the wait for group ironman is already taking so long I dont want to have to wait any longer. Also some rewards from leagues will transfer from league to league and this would give that league an unfair advantage
---
Is WT wintertodt?
---
Epstein is still alive. The body you saw was Tony Rodham, Hilary Clinton’s brother who mysteriously died a month before
---
Pretty sure he knows he's a god.
---
What do you mean? Or you agreeing or against?
---
I repent.
---
It would raise the bar yes. That’s a valid argument!
---
Go eat some crumpets
---
Stream of Woox doing COX on TL actually pulled 40k viewers. If you don't really care about TL because you're mad that it isn't DMM, instead you could be happy that the game you play FOR FUN is getting some recognition. Just saying..
---
Lmao look at this dudes post history
---
The lore could be that you kill the goblin or elf to make a skinsuit.
---
Ironmemes

because they complain about things that don't matter or aren't a big deal in the grand scheme of things.

---
Mine?
---
Appreciate the layout! This is what I was looking for. Is it easy to unlock all the relics?
---
Ohhhhh I missed the "to do prayer" and thought that he was killing KBD.
---
U right
---
...thieving...
---
wait was the unicorn being on suicide watch actually part of the quest story line
---
You’ll get more tasks you can choose from as you level up both in combat and in slayer. Brimstone keys still drop and the rate depends on the level of the slayer monster. Monsters higher than level 100 it scales linearly starting at 1/100 at level 100 and capping at 1/50 for level 350. Below level 100 it follows a curve and you can find that formula on the wiki. Gets very rare much below 100 so don’t expect them until you’re higher level
---
Bet you got a lot of xp though!
---
What is next to the prayer cape i cant tell from image
---
😒
---
Well....and elf just needs some headgear don't they? Well....they did before the SotE update anyways.......
---
I was born with it
---
You can overnight splash easily. You won’t get banned
---
This sub is insane with downvotes and the entire Epstein thing is proof of how powerful memes are. Thousands and thousands of young and easily influenced people can be completely convinced that something is true simply by repeatedly being exposed to memes.
---
Think you’re supposed to zoom and have inven close to altar so you can rap when it cancels and just log on dot for minimap. don’t actually have to register that a player logged in by seeing them.
---
50/50 bro
---
So glad the cancer staking community streams on Twitch are going away, they're literally all scumbags
---
Ah yes DDOS protection, theres no viable way to defend yourself against DDOS attacks without spending an insane amount of money
---
Just did Relleka and Ardougne. Not really as funny

If i could award this i would. 😆 fkn try using modded controller dude calls you out. Says that controller wont save you. 😆

What’s up with Scorpio dropping tons of ward 2?
---
I had to kill 3 Scorpio for slayer task and got 2 ward drops lol
---
Trouble brewing is fake news

all he has to do is show us his RL loot tracker if hes on it. people always exaggerate shit like this.
---
All non-cosmetic upgrades/achievements
---
Yope.
---
I'm confused, what is going on?
---
Well that's one way to send a message for sure LMFAO
---
I kind of like it cause it rewards diversification in a limited game mode.
---
lmao calm down incel
---
holy shiiiiiiiiit what the fuck!!!!
---
idk what you're implying but they hop world to world looking for people with large stacks of bones and using dihns/arma/etc. You need 10 people to kill them (arma/dihns).
---
There's a lot of hate towards you right now so I just want to say: I like your content and I think others are ganging up against you unnecessarily. Being put in the spot light sucks sometimes - hope you don't take it personally. Best to just give nothing to the trolls: be genuine and polite and eventually they'll have nothing to feed on and they'll find someone new to bother.
---
I don't understand why people always use this argument. So many aspects of runelite are qol and should already exist in the main client.
---
Curious, how many shaman masks did you get?
---
1 Year Later - Lvl 3 Fire Cape!!!!

I got my first the other day. Dragon fire shield. Nieve. Bob. and the charity hitpoint heart #6/199
---
They are super nice quality. I will definitely get more in the future, and I will always keep an eye out for the 
---
limited edition ones that come out.
---
I've asked since the release of **Hydra**
---
The current mechanic for **Hydra** to be damaged by the chemicals is it has to be on the vent before hand to get hit. 
---
What are the Mod's thoughts on also allowing it to be damaged by walking into the chemicals as well?
---
Underrated achievement
---
Someone was DDosing Oda on every world he hopped into, so Oda went to wintertodt world to test this on hardcore ironmen.
---
Is putting my laptop in sleep mode good enough?
---
To be blunt, get over it. We all started OSRS from scratch. The game mode has been out for what, almost 7 years? You’re a bit late to the party.
---
Just enjoy starting over. It’ll be fun!

Doesnt matter if the camera stopped functioning or got 'too grainy' or was positioned wrong... It's suspicious af.

well you are quite lucky since the bone neck is 1/1000

Lmfao you really aren't a salty little boy aren't you u/KempQ, yo do you remember when you had a cry and flamed on a bunch of Chunk's videos because he "used a video title that you had planned to use on an unreleased video"?
---
huh. alright
---
Please don't give this guy attention
---
How much slower does RS3 drain run energy at 1 agility compared to OSRS? 
---
Silverhawks cost a lot of money to train with while agility courses are completely free to use.
---
Nah I don't need to be educated lol I'm pretty easily in the top 1% right now. I've thought it through a lot and unless you're rushing pvm I don't think picking your task helps much at all.
---
There are very few bad tasks in zeah and you'll get a ton of points doing it so skips are easy to afford. The farming contracts is the bigger one but you benefit more just going harvester getting triple seeds and maxing herb.  Fishing is unaffected by 3x gatherer since you'll be 3 ticking anyway.
---
Courier is mainly just for afkers. The boost isn't all that significant to xp.
---
Still irrelevant; minimal code you could achieve this with two excel functions.
---
Exactly this. I’m curious to where people think this is so easily done. Cheap ddos mitigation techniques usually end up making a poorer experience for everyone, while only mitigating some of an attack. With the speed of things now a days, the hardware required to protect against large DDOS attacks is SUPER expensive.
---
you only need to pray one bone then it does it automatically right? then you hover the log out. 
---
Haven’t done it in a while.
