I finished 100 molch pearls and grabbed my pearl fishing rod.  A little bit disappointed, though. I was hoping to make it an oily pearl fishing rod as the blog post said we would be able to do.  However, it does not work. You do get a customized error, your character will say "I probably don't want to oil this rod up..." Boy, is he wrong.

---
I did report it as a bug but I don’t know if it was intentional or not. Was really looking forward to using this baby on infernal eels.

---
I would like this link as well, looks impressive. :)
---
So what you're saying is that the polling system is working and we're getting good content in the game? 
---
Both Konar and farming contracts had to be polled... and yet you're agreeing with OP. 
---
Oh....is that why Skilling is extremely profitable? 
---
You could also use a most/lava battlestaff and pop those soul runes in your pouch
---
To be honest, I was fine, even if a little disappointed, with the Alchemical Hydra's difficulty at release but it seems it just keeps getting easier i.e. this new agility shortcut and not having to wear the special boots with the elite diary. To get to grotesque guardians you still have to go past Abberant Spectres, I don't know why Hydra is any different and gets a shortcut meanwhile GGs doesn't.
---
Yeah imagine actually following the story and working out what to do for yourself.
---
You know quest guides were originally created so the 8 year olds that can't read could complete quests too?
---
Seed vault devalue my seed box
---
Im suprised you have kept playing RS3 for that long. How does it feel to see more than 3 people at the G.E. L0l.
---
no whats even more cringe is those post saying my friend died today lets take a picture of our rs chars in a Church yeah im pretty sure you friends was everyone to remember him as the guy who played a 18 year old game
---
She looks hot, is she available?
---
Jagex and making game crippling decisions, name a more iconic duo
---
That 70 rc is more impressive than anything else, holy fuck man
---
I don’t think my keyboard is able to rebound keys but I am getting a mechanical keyboard soon so I hope that has rebindable keys. Yeah what you described sounds so much better than AHKs as well.
---

Dude, fuck off. For me it was a huge achievement, I saved up to make it easier for myself bought a blowpipe and did it. Sure it wasn't that hard, but there aren't many super hard things in RS outside of PvP. It felt like a real accomplishment and it was my first boss ever.
---
Now I don't got posting to the sub about it, but for my friends group we all go nuts for each other when one of us gets there.
---
Aren't the unlock-able emotes needed for elite and master clues?
---
Genie, Mr. Mordaut, maze and Jekyll are all fantastic randoms. 
---
Can I have a look? :o
---
Yikes
---
I bet some of the Rs3 mods are deluded enough to think their version of mobile will have the same effect
---
RuneLite is great as long as you turn off a lot of the plugins. Most of them are just stupid. But it has some I wouldn't live without, like chat history (keeps showing chat when you world hop), stretched mode (I can actually see the UI on a 1080p monitor without putting on my glasses), GPU rendering (big FPS boost) and old 2005 UI.

REEEEEEE

gf wife
---
The place of runescape. It looks very out of place inside the game. It wouldn’t fit anywhere else because it looks bad.
---
\&gt;thinking I'm being anything close to serious
---
that's good to know. i was definitely under the impression that hard clue scrolls would have more valuable rewards than this? but i may be wrong
---
If it's taken them until now to leave over MTX, they have a very high tolerance for it.
---
Which ones are still offered?
---
Indeed :P. It doesn’t bother me If a screenshot Isnt taken probably. But for some people it seems to  care 🙈
---
Going for my first attempt at Jad. I've got 70 ranged, 61 def, 63 prayer, full ancient d'hide, archers ring, avas accumulator, ammy of fury, and rcb. 
---
I know that 75+ ranged and blowpipe is optimal, but can I tackle this with my current setup?
---
Rodger that - will regroup and reapproach, Captain!
---
This is why I amethyst mine.
---
But why NO to it as well? What does it matter either way? 
---
I used to annoy my mum as a kid so much telling her all the different things I was cooking in Runescape. Different varieties of fish, all the cool gnome food (RIP anyone ever bothering to make any of that these days, XP waste I guess), etc.
---
I’m new to mobile, but used to play pre eoc. How do you do construction away from your house? You used to be able to make items in like a noted form instead on installed in your house. 
---
F
---
From what level will it increase? What bosses do you suggest with my stats?
---
The only thing I'll ever be jealous of RS3 for.
---
tob is 10m/hr lol 
---
Ultra fertile is not equivalent to 1 super compost, its equivalent to one ultra compost. They give the same effect. 
---
same, just 1920x1080. I'm a little jelly.
---
What do you mean with that?
---
It has the graphics and the MTX and is more forgiving to players. It will be good for the younger demographic who is used to mobile gaming.
---
Hi can bank pin number size be increased? Heres my non artist rendering: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aipo0x/can_the_bank_pin_screen_get_a_update_so_its/
---
No such thing in osrs. 
---
If you have 75 ranged blow pipe does work on these things. 
---
tbh i think alot of people here dreamed about konar and i can tell you it wasn't about slayer monster.....
---
The game is 2007scape because it was the *closest backup they had to 2006*. They wanted 2006, but couldn't get it, because of the huge demand for the 2006scape private server proved that there would be demand for an old school style game.
---
OSRS is not 'non-EOC scape'. It's meant to be in the style of the game of 2005-2007. 
---
|&lt;
---
aww shit thank you for telling me, I have pearls in my bank that I never spent. One thing I noticed was that the october post mentioned the oily rod being possible, while the january post did not.  It could seem that they just forgot or didn't bother mentioning it, but now that it's known to not be possible, what a shame
---
Can herb patches in Chambers of Xeric scale up with the amount of people in the raid? For example, for each additional Olm phase, add another patch to farm herbs in. This will help significantly with the time it takes for large groups to prepare for the final Olm fight.
---
&amp;#x200B;

seercull

Lmao
---
You can easily do bandos I've made 100m+ from that alone. And I have 85 Slayer and I can usually make at least 5m a day from doing just slayer
---
Only 6 hours? pffff the sneaking around in mm2 takes longer than that
---
Got mine at 30m xp.  Got my second before 31m
---
Is it possible to introduce a method
---
 to 
---
make bank item placeholders without the actual item itself.
---
no
---
How do you have the level to kill Thermie and only 995 kraken kills? That’s some booty rng 
---
So the Abyssal Sire, The Overseer, The Abyss, Abyssal whip and Abyssal demons looks like they're not from RuneScape?
---
So it’s just adding an extra step for using Konar To get her loot? 
---
They are p2p
---
Finally an intelligent comment
---
"Ur gay" 10/10

Just me tbh

Coming fro. You that means nothing... these morons give away their info and their stuff

Better off finding a second hand laptop
---
I saw this on a reddit post from a while back. Is this strategy viable for koruend, especially hellhounds?
---
"Get a pool or altar in your house with a combat dummy and kourend teleport portal. Ancient mace spec the dummy to get your max hit in extra prayer Points. Go through the kourend portal and head for the hellhounds in the catacombs. Fight the hellhounds with protect prayer with a bonecrusher in inventory. When you are out of prayer points the hellhounds will probably almost be non agressive. When this happens you tele back to your house and repeat the process."
---
10x more often, with 0.1x the resources and dev team that RS3 gets
---
her 1 arm is broke 
---
Wait I don't understand how this is a scam.
---
I'm not going to lie, I got a 6 nugget load the other day.  I was happy 
---
I'd never seen 6 on 3 inventories before
---
Cause they're baby sharks
---
56, fairly new to raids when it comes to bonus styles of offense, more of the just dominate a hand and then avoid stalagmites haha sorry if that’s an issue
---
drogs, not even once
---
Love how nobody explains who the fuck this guy is for the 90% of us who have no fucking clue what trapple or pinscape is
---
It's literally called skull "tricking" how is that not dishonest or deveptive
---
Yes, I should've phrased my comment better -- I meant to say that PvM plays a major role in obtaining many resources a lot faster than through skilling.
---
WAIT A SECOND
---
YOUR K SEEMS TO BE BROKEN SIR 
---
it because  people think the question is referring to hydra boss, my friend voted no because "we don't need to make the hydra boss easier", he's not even 95 slay btw.
---
Ash mentioned it last q&amp;a as something he wants changed, along with the water can.
---
You may have been ratted. A virus on your pc. Certain programs can detect when youre in runescape, even detect when you're in the bank interface. It'll take a screenshot everytime you click, allowing the hacker to figure out your pin. 
---
Thank you :) it's the Huawei P20 Pro
---
I would say the ones on twitter are the ones who really care, and often(not always) knows whats better for the game than casuals. 
---
Im not even on twitter myself, but I would say the same can be said about reddit aswell.
---
What gear are you currently using? 
---
nothing fails the polls anyway so the polls dont accomplish anything at all
---
Yea i thought the same. But computer came up clean. Did a clean reinstall just in case. If they had that why would they hack my alternate email? I never sign into it unless its to access my main lol
---
H
---
I have a better idea. We should force them to pass a sort of Runescape literacy test with random questions to filter out the bots and the f2p players that aren't productive members of society.
---
Realists saw there wasn't any chance, optimists hoped however and lost money on it :)))
---
Thank the guy from the vid, he is the true MVP haha 
---
Ehhh.
---
Zaros is less about balance and more about progress and growth. He sees potential and he cultivates it, grows it; he's a little voice in the back of your mind pushing you harder and higher. 
---
Zaros and his empire historically did some *really* fucked up stuff. He experimented on just about every race with the various Nihil, used Ripper Demons (which are literally tortured husks of previous victims infected by demonic flesh), openly had necromancy used, the fuckin' works. His empire was awesome if you were powerful or had some value, but you were absolutely 100% screwed if you weren't. Saradomin and Aramdyl all about protecting the weak, Zamorak and Bandos would prolly kill them, Zaros would be the sort to work you to near death, use you to feed vampires, and when you're near death would rip out your soul to power a lamp and reanimate your corpse for menial labor, if you weren't fed to a Cthonian Duke that is. Amazing but horrifying efficiency.
---
Death and the Mahjarrat had pissing contests in the past (flesh constructs mainly), but even on a personal level I'd doubt Guthix and Zaros would jive. Guthix is about peace and balance, Zaros is essentially the antithesis of it by breaking any balance in your favor. Outside of Bandos and Zamorak (and Saradomin lol), Zaros is up there with the most likely to be disliked.
---
Guthix was woken up because he was communing with the Anima Mundi when Zamorak lit a quarter of the world on fire. It was an instantaneous "OH FUCK" moment where he got mad and kicked the gods out (with the "Do Not Enter" sign that was the Edicts) because he realized they brought war and conflict with them. 
---
when you select trident of the seas e it crashes
---
3+18 is always better than 2+12, both with and without picking up the excess. Picking up excess is less xp, but more profit (and always better for irons, as the time to pick up is better than the time to collect sand).
---
How would it only fuck up the game? If you're not going to explain or offer an actual rebuttal then fuck off. 
---
Oops getting versions mixed up XD sorry
---
Uhhhhh plus like 100k for the 75 yanillian hops to protect

any laptop i3 with Intel HD 520 will get you max fps with runelite. Should run you around $250-300.

Don't buy anything Lenovo, though.

Dragon slayer
---
Nit pick but the colour could be consistent
---
Mid level, I don’t have ancestral or Tbow, but I have the majority of the other gear. 
---
Thats nothing to do with inflation, its because skilling supplies such as logs and raw fish are dropped from pvm at greatly increased rates
---
Back in 6th grade before I had members I dreamed of a fencing tournament of red team vs blue team. A couple weeks later I got mems and discovered castle wars 
---
Try pking on a low lvl pure or bring a Tver friend. There quite a lot of mains which do revs.
---
I've never seen it before and took the screenshot myself vOv
---
Can still see run energy and spec att get rekt gg 
---
lucky bastard
---
Planning on putting 10m into both mage and range.
---
I’m currently sat at 84 range and 77 mage and plan on chinning and bursting mm2 monkeys. 
---
As there’s no way to calculate xp, does anyone reckon they can work out what level I’d get to?
---
There is a very static supply into the game and new demand.  People aren't going to do more zulrah to get coconuts.
---
Yes pretty much so good for afking slayer.
---
Please send link! Us at Olympus would love such a tool, seems more responsive than the current Excel calc
---
ah okay, good to know 
---
A common one is a “trading training” scam method - pitched as a game. You trade bank cash stack, scammer matches it + (tinderbox e.g whatever), then removes the item and you have to press accept as quick as possible.
---
Press quickly and get a reward - maybe 1 mil , 2 mil etc. 
---
Press too slow and no reward
---
People get greedy and after 5 “training” sessions the scammer removes tinderbox AND 90% of his bank as you rush to press accept twice. Since you’re already conditioned to the red flashing you don’t think much of it and boom
---
How is 91 fishing possibly worse than the 91 rc requirement from karamja?
---
Get torso asap. It’s going to be your bis melee chest item for a long time. Imo wait until 100 cb to get void. It’s significantly faster on the higher boat and void isnt super useful outside of some higher level pvm 
---
Awesome dude we were chatting about this in our cc the other night. Pretty good for doing clues :) I do this but sub nats and keep lavas in my inv, just in case for whatever reason I can't make it back to my gear within 1 hr.
---
Someone spoke to him on his main and he forgot to turn off whatever he uses to spam the "whoever shows me the most money wins 20m" scam he was probably spamming on his alt and then logged out so instead of replying he outed himself as a scammer
---
Yeah but Zamorak pulled a Sauron and betrayed/overthrew him. All the ancient spellbook teles are ruins of former Zarosian strongholds. 
---
I dunno if him having less influence and *weilding* less power over Gielinor means he actually is less powerful. But my assumption was always that he somehow lost a bit of his godlike power, if not died outright when Zammy overthrew him
---
Either way he wasn't really in the picgure during the god wars, as Zamorak's rise to power over him is what sparked it
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** Sparky780! ^(hug)
---
You can chin in the MM1 tunnels too pretty efficiently
---
Do it
---
Kettle just lured my friend for rapier and bandos. Gave me 2m for supplies for theatre of blood then asked me to lure people with him. DO NOT FALL FOR KETTLE'S TRICKS.
---
bye!!!
---
Because they only want to help if it's publicly seen. You'll never get solid support from them if it's behind the scenes.  They only care about their reputation and not about actually helping. Kind of like how some celebrities have to make a big announcement that they're donating some money, meanwhile Bill Gates donates tens of billions of dollars discretely and probably sometimes anonymously 
---
Bruh just get a second scythe smh
---
Big oof 
---
Woah, today? What are the odds that they knew this would happen today and made the account? Damn. 
---
Mud are pricey homie 
---
Except I'm an RS3 and OSRS player that has played the damn game for 18 years so I probably have done a lot more than you. Stop being an asshole to people that play a different version of the game and DIVIDING the community. They seperated each for a reason.
---
For how afk it is I’d say yes. It takes a long time but the drops are pretty good. 
---

On my ironman I just skip them, woops

---
Max cape?
---
Potions
---
Hell yeah dude, get it
---
does that mean we should build a wall around hydra?
---
I mean they have minimum level requirements but the higher you get the faster/easier it becomes. I'd hold off on void until 100+ combat. It really isn't used much. Unless you really wanna learn/farm zulrah, but once you learn rotations and get comfortable with switching you'd replace the void with hides/ahrims anyway. 
---
Go get your defender. Id say get torso once you're in the 80s combat wise. And make sure to watch some videos on BA so you know what you're doing. 
---
Pure clans still do this but I don't know if any of the main ones do. I know there are sometimes rune wars in deep f2p wild. 
---
i was spam clicking to pick up loot and thought i talked to vorkath somehow and i got annoyed for a good 10 seconds before i realised, smh.
---
f2p clans still exist and they still have clan wars
---
It’s just a prank 
---
It's not that. It's the fact that when clan wars came out, wildy was a no pk zone. So if someone wanted the pvp experience, they needed to go to clan wars. Yeah there were fight pits and later on, bounty hunter. But it wasn't the same in those places. Clan wars scratched the itch everyone lost from the wildy.
---
In osrs, we have the wildy. So people get their fix there. I just wish the clan wars could revive itself though. As unlikely as it seems, it'd be just so much fun. 
---
I guess if you have trident and kraken tentacle you don’t need to do it. But a charged trident is always nice. They’re good source of sanfews and runes as well
---
All the new slayer mobs are trash. People only do Wyrms because they are somewhat AFK and easy. New content shouldn't be bad. It should be better than the old. People complain that new content cant always be better but I beg to differ because I get tired of killing the same things over and over again. 
---
Make drakes as profitable as gargoyles or even a little more then leave the fire mechanic.
---
That's true, the gpu pligin actually made me install runelite to try it out, but the client just doesn't really work well for how I like to play since I like to have the osrs client on one half of the screen, chrome on the other but runelite's client doesn't seem to to snap or resize properly.
---
go to the actual funeral you poor peasant

Are the the blackjack games?
---
I put 1k in the machine, and was out of luck.
---
Didn't really expect to win. But I assumed that he actually played blackjack, meaning the odds were in his favour. (ie how casinos make money)
---
I didn't fall for a ruse. I was giving up runescape to follow my dreams of shitposting on r/2007scape. So I was just throwing my 100k around (from mining iron ore).
---
I know, I usually do like 2-3 invs of kills (usually around 20-30 kills and then skip lol it’s just so boring to me 
---
I accounted for a handful of the items each trip along with 1/256 of the value of d legs/skirt on each kill. With noted bars the estimate is around ~7k per kill. Even if a little higher, I can't see them being all that incredible when compared to most other tasks.
---
#PHONY
---
This happens every day on twitch. Not much osrs can do bc the people running them will just crest a new stream
---
Can max cb pking be fast to or is it always slow?
---
True, I'm just pointing it out because after going back to NMZ at a higher level I was actually shocked at how much quicker it was to get points compared to the slog of a grind I remember it being first going for imbues.
---
Verf actually started it all with his UIM Karamja months ago. Yes after the Settled ‘Swampletics’ it blew up 
---
Did he get every pet in the game?
---
Pepperidge Farm also recalls that this is a terrible idea for OSRS. 
---
It's easy enough for the devs can just reduce the amount of drops. 
---
Runelite and OSbuddy are 100% safe. Still always have 2fa on email/account. 
---
Nahhhh
---
Ardoooon
---
Instead of this, they need to buff their table. For 84 slayer, this task is aids. 
---
I've known this for a while. Do t even take them out of my pouch most of the time 
---
not really lol
---
When they say "ohh too slow" play along and say "on mobile lol sorry" I had one give me a few hundred k during the "training".
---
No one refers to them as skeles haha. Wyverns if you wanna shorten it. 400k/h max is ranging. Decent bit more with melee but you need to bank 
---
It's whatever to me, if people want to play that way it's fine, but on the other hand it's not really for me. So long as they don't go too far with the plugins to the point where the game is playing itself.
---
You'll realize that leveling up is a piece of cake. When we were kids, it took forever to gain levels because kids are dumb. It took me like a year to get 70+ range back in the day lol. Now I got to 87 after like 2 or 3 months of messing around
---
Yeah but i'm talking about in clan wars. I just want to pk like this for the fun of it, and the sheer novelty of seeing if a clan of 70 level 50+ players can beat a clan of 15 level 120+ players etc. No items lost etc. Those were some of the most fun days.
---
The page crashes when I try to select sanguinesti staff.
---
This is exactly what I do, full supplementation of the expenses through birdhouses n herb runs too. Honestly probably still end up in the green. I farm my own yanillian hops to insure my mahogs for free too, those bastards are like 1-1.5k each 
---
Sure, have you seen how many still make it to the game? When there’s a will there’s a way, there’s just no will to get skilling up to par.
---
Clan wars (the minigame) is pretty much deserted :(
---
oh shit! TIL, thanks
---
Happened to my 10 year old main in 2017 :/
---
^^^^^^^^^^^.
---
And we still have both games now don't we? Theyd be bankrupt almost a decade ago if they didnt do that. Perspective. What am I saying this is OSRS reddit, just bitch whine and demand, never look at the bigger picture or think past your next supposed clever "comeback" that never actually discusses a god damn thing.  
---
Sorry this is more at the whole subreddit. Just so many edgelords saying cookie cutter edgelord complaints without solutions and bitching all over the place. Fucking sad. They actually think bitching without an alternative is a valid thing for an adult to do, and they'll fight for it.  
---
God damn pathetic. Go ahead, insult my character or particulars of words or crassness, but you whiny sad bastards know I'm right, just please try and get back to constructive criticism instead of kneejerk bitching with NO solution or positivity for every problem. You just pour your negativity into everything you touch until it's so ruined you move on and then have the audacity to say the thing you ruined is at fault. \*vomits\*
---
Nah 2005 was peak. 
---
You need to get all stats 99 to be maxed.
---
No, I play RS3 and I hate it. I maxed before they started doing all of that and that and EOC drove everyone away because they put PROFIT OVER PLAYERS.
---
"dear player"... yep I'm out

Can we get the pet rates for the new plants from farming?
---
Or if you feel that it's too early to release the exact rates, can we at least know if potato cacti have a higher pet chance than normal cacti?
---
Sent!
---
How much did it cost? 
---
Suck to suck dumbo
---
Also you can use ibans with a tomb of fire and it doesnt expend charges. Useful for barrows. Good quick switch without having to bring extra runes. 
---
You add charged orbs to battle staffs for crafting xp. 
---
SOUNDS LEGIT
---
fuckin freak
---
Bert, Miscellania, Tears of Guthix.  This would be awesome
---
After seeing these polls. I don’t expect I’ll be playing osrs this time next year
---
CAPSLOCK ONLY INCREASES ACCOUNT RECOVERY REQUESTS BY 73% GOODLUCK
---
Sure, that's fine. But for the health of the game overall, fuck these bots. 
---
Thank you so much! I used ReactJS and with Redux. I used a few libraries for calculations and the dropdowns/popups, and regular old html and css for styling mostly. I used flexbox to arrange the layout but someone else suggested bootstrap grid which I'm going to look into. I'd like to make it usable on mobile (currently it's not) so I'll be trying to tweak things so people can access it from more places. 
---
Imagine going to school instead of playing rs.
---
"fro. You" You killed your own pitiful comeback. Good job, sir. 
---
I'll definitely reach out, thanks for the link! 
---
I'm not completely familiar with TNSD's moveset, but assuming they were not immune to the status debuff that would drop their stats to 1s instantly, I think it would still be able to come out on top. 
---
Now if they are somehow immune because lore reasons, honestly I'm not sure who could take on it. 
---
legit put the dildo shaped whip in my ass
---
i mean to be fair he is right, we don't need to make the hydra boss easier.
---
I wouldn't trust them for shit. I'd say it has to have been done by someone running these bots. If a big enough bet is placed, just say they lost, simple. 
---
Scam pet scam pet
---
bump
---
1st to show 60M+ wealth wins dragon claws, and 20M more!
---
&gt; then it's pretty stupid to add an additional step to get your loot
---
It also replaces the standard loot, so I don't understand why people want this.
---
Mostly drunk/high people, morons who are new to the community and don't think people would scam them by giving them money, or people thinking they are smarter than the scammers and can "take their money"
---
i didn't realize people didn't know this haha, it's great. 
---
DUDE
---
Theres this one guy who had his name as I believe, "dick in ass" not sure the exact spelling but thats what it said!
---
You want to use ultracompost no matter what type of herb you're farming.

Subscribing to the man made concept of years in 2019...

sounds like somebody has a bunch of dragon hastas
---
Is she has protection prayers
---
Was about to be like "ehh that's like...an actual pic of a dead guy, we probably shouldn't--" then realized it's xxxtentacion. Carry on.
---
A good way to start a massive rebuild like that could be to watch videos of ironmen beginning their accounts. That could give you a couple ideas. Once you have enough for food and armor, you can go to the catacombs and grind bloodvelds.
---
120 barrows chests 2 uniques wbu?
---
Is that the clown from air bud?
---
It's fine to feel that way. I've done 100s of Jads and the first one on each diff account I've made is always exciting.
---
It's more the karma farming "I wanted this since I was 7 years old!" Kinda posts. It's not really unique or relevant content anymore.
---
And if you think hard content doesn't exist, walk into the Inferno. That's OSRS' firecape nowadays. You can pretty much afk regular fight caves.
---
Nice
---
On the bright side, at least the proposed shortcut now isn't actually a shortcut. It's a safecut.
---
Would still rather nothing be there though....it was extremely worrisome that originally they proposed 3 buffs to the Hydra already.

That might be why, but the lack of understanding/reading worries me if it is. It could also be that players see less of a need to mitigate damage from a less frequent attack or even that they fell half damage is not worth it.
---
least you can fap to the girl
---
idk who would win but Kree'Arra would have most dmg dealt, blasting everyone for 71s every 2 ticks
---
Currently, staves that have magic based attacks (only a few) don't work because it's set up to look for a spell when the attack type is magic, but I don't have the "spells" that those staves cast anywhere for it to find. I'll work on fixing this tonight.

How much you spend in cballs, darts scales and ppots? I lost money doing them

Hell yea! I sent it!

I shoulda said “water battlestaffs”. Not just battlestaffs.

I get what you say but honestly those cute fire cape posts DO get old fast.

I used to jam out to bass hunter and play RuneScape all the time back in the day

Whip or Leaf bladed battleaxe for gargs?

I haven't even been yet and I voted no,  surprised it's passing which is a shame 
---
Certain level?
---
Why would it require you to kill your HC to open more content?
---
Man, give me cute fire cape posts all day over the absolute shit this sub churns out when they discover a new meme.
---
most of them do, hacking is pretty big in a lot of games...
---
Thanks, tried to explain a little more + add a better title(kinda hard to add a good title) and added the link to where the screenshot is. Just posted it, thanks again.
---
Seriously, this isn’t the way to fix drakes, give them better drops, lower their defenses, lower the amount assigned, literally anything other than negating their one unique mechanic.  Sure they’re afk now but they’re still a guaranteed skip from me because they’re slow, and have no incentive to kill them and now they’re boring to kill too
---
Or it could be that people kept suggesting it here and it was getting upvoted a lot ...
---
tbh slayer cape is my fav 
---
The unique drops aren't anything to write home about, sadly. The only marginally useful thing is the drake's claw, and with the bonuses the boots of brimstone give they're not really worth the investment. Boots of brimstone are what, 2m right now? which is decent I guess, but eventually supply will outnumber demand and it'll just be another trash item. I believe the drakes would benefit most from an overall droptable buff, add some alchables on there or something and call it a day.
---

I cannot for the life of me figure out how to open a support ticket. Even when it says "contact support team" it throws you for a loop and sends you back to the FAQ's about name changes.

The problem with gemstone dragons is having to pay more than you’ll get from them if you try to kill them off task.

Those are actually Dragon Gauntlets from the Fist of Guthix mini game.

It respawns every 30 seconds. About as renewable as it gets.

You got a Deviant Art?
---
What skill did you bot?
---
Well the problem is that this would be unfair tword the pc client. I’m talking the jagex client not 3rd party as I do know 3rd party clients do have this feature. But on mobile there is no “legit” 3rd party client so you should be using the Jagex client which once again compared to the pc should be almost the same, giving an advantage to the mobile client would in a way make pc obsolete.
---
I honestly dont even know why cocnuts were used as payment for dragonfruit, when its used for magic trees already. When something like calquat fruits are a high lv fruit and have like no use. 
---
Im sure there are other farming produce that has little/no use that could've been used too. 
---
? 
---
Thanks

I camped at abby demons the second I hit 85 slayer trying to get the head for the red slay helm. I was barraging them for 3 days and got 3k kc. Ended up with dagger at 196kc, 10 whips, and no head. Skipped a bunch of tasks till I got abby demons and killed Sire. At 27kc I got the unsired and my head! Was so happy.
---
How do I get the health and pray on outside of inventory? 
---
You got Deviant Art?
---
it literally has trick in the fuckin name. if you have to trick someone into something its a scam. Anything you do to deceive a player in order to get their wealth is a scam. 
---
I’d say just go prim and ferocious. Cause cerb has high hp but low defence, so you’d want to dish out as much dps as possible. You might even just trigger the ghost phase once instead of twice.
---
Question #18/Konar keys.... can anyone explain that to me? This seems annoying and just adds an additional step to the current method. It's also nice seeing rare drops on the ground, a key isn't exciting.

Out of curiosity, what total level was the account you received the invitation on? I received one on my 250 total alt...
---
In before people start squealing about not screenshotting  
---
Well water battle staffs are used with mostly f2p magic training for people to don’t want to spend extra money on water runes
---
It's a decent money making method. Best in f2p.

Jagex's support team is non existant, and probably for a good reason.

I just blowpipe the whole fight it goes pretty quick

REALLY? The Fally Shield and Addy tele to patches?
---
wtf how have I never known this...
---
If this is your only account then you might aswell turn it into a proper main. If it's not I'd personally rather stay 1 def. I don't think you should base your decision off that random experience you had.
---
Dope.
---
Easy. It's a 50% chance. You either get it, or you don't.
---
No... It really doesn't sound like that. I encourage you to look at the picture again.
---
That account name lmfao 
---
Not sure if extremely dense or just baiting
---
And no teleporting or the item breaks.
---
Dust runes drop in bulk from dust devils, and it’s quite possible an ironman would make lavas at some point for rc xp. 
---
You need glasses bot. 
---
Bang on cunt
---
What you need to understand is the people you see pking (player killing) spend a large portion of time grinding accounts called pures or alts which are account made with stats for pvp. Before you get into pvping I recommend getting your f2p quests done then buy membership. Once you get a high cb (combat level) and get a good understanding for the game you can start making a alt account for pking. This takes time so don’t think you can get this done in a month. Good luck!

I started playing RS in September of 2001. I'm still annoyed about them changing Herblaw to Herblore.

All other shit can be cast aside. My frustration is focused on the Herblaw name change.

This is a question I'm very upset is passing.

I actually just killed 700 jellies to get mith boots on my btw. Go to hell.

What addons play the game for you? 
---
It’s been like that for months lol try rimmington mine on f2p. There’s an army
---
Came here just to say this. Can't believe people actually didnt think of this lol

Sadly I don’t think this can be enforced

Idk why but it made me fall over in the shower laughing 30 mins after I read it

People still play castlewars but yeah most mini-games are dead. Imo it is easily at least half of what it used to be still though.

It’s been happening everyday all day for years. Idk how people fall for it. 
---
Can you make any recommendations? I’m sitting at 70 ranged and looking to get to 75 asap. 
---
It still has to make a request to the server you are  connecting to? Which has a limit.
---
the people that are doing high lvl PvM are just going to sell them  
---
the people actually fishing aren't going to buy them unless they are super cheap  
---
(no one is going to buy a 400gp item just to get an extra 500gp item with no xp) Maths  
---
and if they are justifiable in price what will that do to the price of said resources?  
---
whoa fam no one asked for an essay this is a meme channel
---
I don't think people are saying they should be optimal, but they are a crap task that has literally the highest weight from konar. They have a relatively high slayer req of 84 and their drops are crap, they have mechanics which don't allow you to pay little attention, and they take absolutely forever to finish a task for. This monster needs to have something going for it where people will actually want to do the task, right now it has nothing at all.

Constant player harassment. The account is shared by fools and frontline.
---
It was polled 4 years ago at a time where people where much more conservative and against updates, now everyone has a liberal stance on updates and it becomes even more true for every day that goes by, especially with the large amount of players transitioning from RS3 to OSRS and the huge influx of players from mobile.

Ofcourse, I cant expect you to know this, so you can thank me for enlightening you on the reality of the world.

Heck, I'd man the phone for a couple of hours a week in exchange for membership/bonds, as long as it was a home setup and I could attend the calls while playing. Sure, that's less than a quarter of minimum wage, but I'd be happy knowing I'm part of the reason Jagex finally gets a functional customer support. 
---
Why did you do this
---
God forbid a game gives you an indication of when your buffs/debuffs are going to time out. That’s some pretty standard shit dude. 
---
imagine spending money on this game when you can pay for membership with gp
---
but sure thats elitist and not being retarded
---
I don't use any plugins. I only use the default launcher. Is that really strange?
---
Fucket
---
1) that plugin was removed
---
2) I tried using that plugin and it got me killed so...it really didn’t kill Jad for you. 
---
Yeah it’s dumb. 
---
the game and updates shouldn't be revolved around niche build, it has already ruined the integrity of ironman mode, e.g just farm zulrah instead of mining your own pure ess.
---
Try closing and restarting the app, check if your membership was linked to the right account.
---
If your account is through gamecenter I recommend contacting the osrs support on the website.
---
If your account is make with a email and password log into the osrs website and go to settings then on the right side it should say if you have membership: osrs website &gt; login &gt; account settings. 
---
Once again if you contact support they can give you better answers and help you with your problem. I recommend having proof of purchase ie. receipt. 
---
&gt; My dailies consist of a daily crafting task,
---
What is that? Sandstone flasks?
---
I would win because I can’t draw lol

If i wanted cancer i would've trained runecraft

Lmao would vote yes.
---
aw thx for pointin that out, i didnt know thats what the green meant. and yeah I agree man, I really wasn't trying to troll you, sorry if it came off like that haha
---
Name it Gear Creep 3
---
just kids being edgy
---
I use law lava and nats for alchs while slaying. easy yanille tele to bank, or trollheim tele for gwd. any time i do a clue, i just bust out the pouch and a mist staff.. easy teleports+i can alch the garbage i know i'm about to receive. 
---
That would require $12
---
"Just fucking deal with it" you're the cancer of this game
---
Sorry but arrows showing up on the ground is part of the game. If someone is stealing “your” arrows, the best thing to do would be world hop. 
---
Post it on github!
---
I used to hate questing. I still do, but I used to, too.
---
It is my only account but pking is literally all I care to do lol I dunno 🤷‍♂️ but you’re right. It was only one dude. Directly after that I romped on some dude my same level with 60 def :/ 
---
You have good stats so I recommend zulruh, vorkath, and the alchemical hydra. To get the money for the gear you can just buy bonds from webpage and sell them.
---
You're telling me 75% of the community actually knows good game design?
---
The ZHasta has a slash and crush option, and the DHLance gets a damage and accuracy % bonus on all dragons. Whip is very solid on them, though.
---
How do you know that they are doing it just to irritate you? Maybe they really need arrows. If they haven't even talked, you have no way to assume they're just trying to troll you. 
---
Yes but your stats will all be lvl 1
---
tysm! about \~500 tbh
---
It happens we learned though brother, I luckily only got ripped for 2.8m
---
Either those are big traps or the skinny guys shoulders. I can't tell
---
What set up are you losing money doing them? Because I Fire Surge them with Tome of Fire and cannon and still come out profitable. So unless you are standing in every fireball and using anglerfish to heal while using dragon darts in a blow pipe, I can't possibly imagine how it's possible to lose money there. They shit out nature runes like it's their job and each task is *at least* 1m+ in gp without accounting for the Konar table.
---
Pretty viable. In that case you're going to want to max your prayer bonus. I usually just wear prossy plate and legs with the rest being regular gear. I only use 2 ppots max when I do a trip. You might actually get close to the cost of 1 or 2 prayer pots with all the teleporting. Not sure.
---
Pick up your arrows first then if it's such a big deal to you. Jesus christ. 
---
Yes, and they did depending on what they were.  For example, slayer tasks would just have you kill X amount of monsters on task.  You'd get the profits from the drops, as well as the reward from the gnome NPC in Burthorpe upon completion.
---
A lot of your high tier secondary skills (crafting, summoning, smithing, fletching, etc.) required a sink in resources first, so you'd see very little money
---
Nobody in f2p uses energy pots lol.
---
Yeah but when you log in on old school youll be on tutorial island
---
Well I'm sorry people feel like they're wasting their time because theyre gaining xp or gp but honestly its a stupid reason
---
Yeah I mean god forbid you need to pay attention killing a boss which is one of the best money makers in game.
---
Upvoting to see outcome
---
I feel like there is a disconnect on our understandings. Are you saying if some guy is carrying 3 items of value, in the wilderness, in which he fully expects to die but knows he will keep 3 items - say he is doing a clue and goes through Ardy deep wild teleport. And someone is "disguised" as a web and "skull tricks" him into skulling, then logs into a main and specs him out? Seems like a clever lure, designed to fool unsuspecting players, that revolves around their lack of awareness or knowledge of the game. Im not saying to ban these people, but come on, is this not an apt comparison?
---
It just seems to weird to me. Scams play off, many many times, the victim's own greed. But here we are sticking up for the "trickster" where the victim is not only NOT actively seeking greedy ends, but rather is just a unobservant fool who assumed he would know better than attack player disguised as inanimate objects
---
Correct
---
not to mention the elite diary removes the need for boots entirely 
---
assuming you get ~10 ore per node, having your own node is a ~10% increase, since you're guaranteed the last node
---
however, if the world's crowded, everyone wiping out a wall, in less than a minute, costs a lot more than ~10% xp/h because of how much more you have to reposition
---
Vorkath with his poison phase, constantly healing and damaging other bosses with his fireballs.
---
&gt;searching through hundreds of piles of drops
---
You literally just right-click on the ground each time you kill a guy, and pick up the items. It's not difficult.
---
&gt;I don't care what you think is fun. That's not fun for me.
---
Then don't play RS?
---
That's not very smart for them since water battlestaves are member's only items
---
I will never not upvote this. The editing is so on point lmao
---
Nah. It's a really good challenge. Making money without relying on flipping or any kinda combat.

Neat! If you don't mind me asking, is there some application process for this or do they personally select certain players based on certain criteria? And if so, what kind of qualifications or experience do mods need?
---
Hooked on Phonics visage.
---
No
---
I'm glad people are butthurt over this passing, it soothes my own personal butthurt.
---
Thank you, I guess my follow-up question is if Twitter is the only place to contact them directly?
---
It's actually pathetic
---
I remember trying to reach out to them.. They wouldn't answer emails for weeks, There is no way to actually call them, There is no ingame chat/livechat on website.. The only means to get help shouldn't be through social media..
---
Shame how it used to not be a niche that progression wasn't instant.
---
Not to disturb everyone's doom and gloom fest here but the relaunch has been out for 6 years now has gained massive popularity and the majority of players are completely content.
---
Let's not fix what isn't broken.
---
I literally cannot downvote this comment 0.01% as much as I'd like to.
---
people in this game don't like having monsters require mechanics to kill. The only thing they want are bosses. I wish people were not like this as having a middle ground of having some monsters have mechanics but good rewards should be a thing. But instead, we have afk things that are 0 threat give tons of exp + tons of money.
---
yours looks good and is probably more intuitive for people who havent used either. i am looking forwards to seeing it be developed further
---
Best bet is to quest barrows gloves asap and then train/cannon range to 75 at least. Then blowpipe slayer tasks, at 77 Slayer you can camp Brutal Black Dragons with a DHCB or a Tbow 
---
Not much you can do. Just secure the account (Change password, add authenticator and bank pin if you don't have them) 
---
mod ash said they want to add more aus worlds 
---
That’s what I told him. Just wanted the community to be aware!  Thank you for your reply. 
---
once an ore is mined, there's a 15-27 second timer, where the node has unlimited ore, before the node runs out of time and only has 1 ore left
---
assuming you get ~10 ore per node, having your own node is a ~10% increase, since you're guaranteed the last ore
---
however, if the world's crowded, and everyone wipes out a wall, in less than a minute, because they're all trying to mine their own node, it costs you a lot more than ~10% xp/h because of how much more you have to run around
---
on the other hand, if the world doesn't have enough people, you'll have to repair the wheel too often
---
the best solution is to find a world where everyone has their own wall, so there's 7+ people who can repair the wheels but also have their own row of nodes
---

Literally spend 8k on 4 ultracomposts for hops and do a single run just before you're replacing your trees. Rarely got less than 75 hops from a single run.
---
f2p is a much smaller map though, the aus f2p worlds are crowded too. They just need to add more.
---
You assume I don't think they should either be allowed, which is a straw man position i do not take. I learned from my mistakes and others' I feel many should, but I think its silly we are comparing Oranges to Tangerines and finding not one bit of similarity. 
---
It isn't about what i think is morally right, I just think it's humorous people will go defend wildy "tricks" and say they aren't another form of scamming just wearing a different mask. I accept the wilderness is a risk, it's why I want at least 3 good items to help me. Especially if im doing kbd or hard clues. I'm also of average intelligence, so I turn player attack options to right click. I have never been skull tricked, nor do I afk in the wild. If you get tricked in the ways I have described, you're either a total noob or you're dumb. But if you get scammed, the vast majority of times its because you're either a total noob, dumb, but ALSO greedy

Alright man you do you. Physical ability and flashy strategy isn't everything. Mental discipline and persistence is a trained ability in the same sense your muscles are. It's shallow to only consider stereotypical prowess or impressive displays as "ability". 
---
Got the rock golem at 64 mining at mother lode. Like 1/240k drop rate. Pets are rare lol
---
*Pikachu face*
---
&gt; I cannot recover.
---
Why would support staff manually unlock an account that you can not prove you are the owner of?
---
Do you think that they would lower the standard of proof because you talked with them personally, instead of submitting a recovery request form?
---
What kind of security would that be?
---
Where the purple sweets at Nan!?
---
There is a nook on top by the stairs from the greater demons, people are usually camped there
---
Cannot prove I am the owner?  I have the original pass and the pass has never been changed.  And if they look into the account no items or anything has changed...
---
It changed after mobile release, a ton of clash of clanners joined us. Were now the minority.
---
As others have commented, it's like 90% afk and if you miss that 10%, you die. Commit afk or not afk, you can't have both. 
---
March 31st was the post date but I think it was an April fools joke so yeah it’s fake. Op kind of admitted it in the comments too. 
---
if I registered an email right away when logging in I could avoid being locked out... the only reason I am locked out is because there was no registered email and the security questions are gibberish
---
Perfectly valid sentence.

But how would that be funny?
---
That is only in the upper section that costs 100 nuggets. People should avoid each others on the bottom section.

... What? Amadeus?
---
YouTube it, there's a famous clip of a twitch girl streamer falling for it.
---
It's basically "omg look at that cash" and they accept without taking out their item that's worth more.
---
Also there's bots that can change gp value so fast b4 the accept that the delay system doesn't show up.
---
Thanks for the info, gonna do some research on bursting. 
---
Questing is the way to go for stats, you should visit the wiki for the members skills than can be boosted with quests, also doing waterfall quest and the grand tree are a good idea. I hope this helps.

Why did you vote no to the favour question...

Sure, but having to use a workaround doesn't excuse poor design.

how do grand exchange buy limits work? the wiki says 13,000 feathers per 4 hours but I can only get 13,000 every day

I like it but instead of a pouch, they should take up either your free hand or blessing spot.

How do you feel runecrafting?
---
Have you checked the internet archive? Might be a worth a shot!
---
Of course, sent!
---
Thanks man!

Sure thing!

That’s true I’ve realized how inefficient I used to play. I was one of those 124s who only had mith gloves because I couldn’t be hassled with quests. Now I’m already up to rune on a lvl 86.
---
Oh god getting messages on your xbox 360 of just like a 20 second voice clip of some other squeaker calling you all the bad words he can think of, but kind of in a quieter but still aggressive tone so his parents wont hear him cursing. 
---
Remember fucking Minasota burns that youtuber who's whole stick was to make kids cry by saying he worked for microsoft, then has them put his parents on the phone? That place used to be worse at a point. 
---
I absolutely love the Kebos Lowlands update, but I feel like some parts of it are less strong than they could be. 
---
Drakes currently lack a good signature drop that is useful across all levels, furthermore their drop table is rather lackluster in terms of gp/h, 
---
making it an unfavorable task no matter what you're after. By including Volcanic Glands to their droptable, they receive a slight increase in overall gp/h through the extra konar drops, 
---
as well as add a niche Best-in-Slot item for the Karuulm Slayer Dungeon that does not have any effects anywhere else. These boots would be BiS even with the elite diary reward, 
---
but wouldn't invalidate the elite diary reward altogether as not everyone will have immediate access to these boots.
---
I've left the droprates open to interpretation, but I envision a droprate of roughly 1/100 being balanced for the glands, with a 2% chance to receive a pristine scale when turning it in to Konar. The glands would be untradable, however the Volcanic Boots would be tradable when finished.

MrNoSleep - Does a lot of loot from 1000 type videos. I'm not really a fan myself but I can appreciate what he does.

Pan1c - Pking with a lot of interesting combos 
---
A few other names I can think of
---
Torvesta, Framed, Sir Pugger, Mr Bug, Theoatrix, A Friend, Jakeyosaurus, Alkan, Sparc Mac.
---
There's definitely a heap of good content, but there's also a lot of shit, and everyone has opinions along the same lines. Someone like Sparc Mac has a lot of followers and a lot of haters. Personally, I used to like his Sparc Mac Live series, and it's crazy how much money he has in game but outside of that, I don't really enjoy much of his other stuff. 
---
 It depends what you like watching as well. Pking, progress vids, money making, bosses, etc
---
i think he was referring to "old school runescape"
---
Reaching 70 slayer for kurask is not too bad. Its your best move and maybe do kandarin diary for the bowstrings. Beside that i dont recommend collecting flax by hand. And if you want money and reach 70 slay , just camp kurask for a while its pretty good money.

OSRS are also guilty of requesting easyscape updates. Just look at 07 now compared to its release, and you’ll see that it has in fact became significantly easier.
---
Lmfao

Why would I want to do that when a plug in can tell me all the drops automatically?
---
Many monsters leave tons of piles. When using a cannon you don't know which is the last one you killed unless you're watching the whole time. Unless you don't care about drops, you need to right click all the piles continuously. You're brain dead if you enjoy that. That adds nothing to the game

I voted yes because of your post

How many players voted on the poll? Was it around 60,000? And that’s not counting how many of those players have alts that also voted yes for or no for the poll
---
So how is attacking a monster behind them and tricking them into skulling not a skulltrick but a bait? Where do you draw the line and what are the similarities that cause one to be grouped together with the other.

Hell yeah i camped them for a while and if you can get herb sack, totally worth it

Ranarr profit is higher on average, but toadflax is the highest "safe" herb. In that you suffer a very small loss (1k or so) when it dies. It's usually somewhere from 17k profit from each ranarr vs 13k from each toadflax.

Oo, I didnt know, gl mate.

The thread title was bashing the question which asked about dragon fire protection on the drakes one magic attack. The title ended with something like "lmao cause moving one square is hard".
---
Ironmen dont kull zulrah for resources anymore, only scales (they did with the old loot table).  In fact since rhe release of farming contracts, making seeds almost free (papaya, calquat, willows, herb in big numbers..)  grinding zulrah gets more and more boring. The only good drops now are pretty much addy bars or uniques. (bulk food coming from KDT and prayer is way bettter from vorkath /hydra).

I think lobsters or yews are the best your gonna get for f2p skills. Or make steel bars maybe. F2p sucks honestly, I play the game off an on and will not play f2p once you are a member it’s hard to go back.

There are only maybe two or three good polls on there. Even the polls regarding Konar are ass backwards. I'm supposed to accept and believe that all of the 25k people voting yes on stuff about her are the ones who will be using that master? Not at all. The polls have become a joke.

There are still heaps of bots on OSRS, they take up a large portion of those numbers. Half the time when people say RS3 is shit they don't even have a valid reason to back their statement up, it's just not their preferred game and they're angry it shares the same name as the game they like so they try and bash it. Those who still play RS3 are loyal players and it there are a lot of nice things about it, music, atmosphere, changeable skyboxes and admittedly fashionscape. OSRS is still a really great game and the reason it attracts more is because of it's simplicity and nostalgic feeling, there's no denying that it was one of the most popular games back in the early 2000's and it's starting to get back some of those numbers by doing what it does best, being simple and clean.
---
I agree, the contracts are over powered. I never expected to get 4 calquats 2 magics 3 torsols... In one contract reward for checking the health of poison ivy.
---
If there was a reward shop and each tasks assigned a number of points with a default of assigned points for assigning the difficulty would be a better solution. 
---
You keep the hard, medium, easy with their assign default points for competion (3 hard, 2 med, 1 easy) plus the weight of the task such as check the health of a red wood tree grants 10points while checking the health of Magic weights 8. So you will get 13 or .11 points for hard. 
---
If you get assign a task because you don't have a seed or don't want to use it, do the medium or easy. But no matter what, you have to do a contract to select a hier contract level.
---

I literally dont see the difference. especially if you can store and bank the keys. I honestly think it would be 100x MORE fun if you could. I'd much rather save up like 50 keys and cash out all at once just to see how much I get, rather than just getting some noted logs and throwing them in the bank
---
I voted yes because I like consistent game mechanics. If I have something that protects me from dragon fire, and this enemy is a dragon doing a fire attack, my protection should apply. I wouldn't mind if they changed it to some other attack if you wanted to maintain the mechanic, but that wasn't an option. 
---
OwO
---
I didn’t know this honestly. I’m just frustrated with them because it’s like when you try to go around them you can’t, even if there is free space to move around them you have to click around them your guy doesn’t recognize the free space to just go around.

It's literally the same shit as if you made a slayer tab, dawg... there's no difference.

Damn that seems like a bit of a weird system,  that makes sense for the drop but not giving any credit because I did less damage seems odd. I was really enjoying just killing them with my friend for a chance to get the pet but I'm guessing I can't get that either if im not getting any credit for the kill? I hope that's not the case :( thanks for the help though!
---
Good Call!
---
Just one the one was excited for a new none degradable weapon as the rapier is a bit out of my price range still
---
That’s true, but unless you have incredible self control, you’ll end up doing that for everything. Why mine? Craft? Runecraft? Fletch? Smith? These all are pointless on a regular account aside from achievement diaries and quests
---
Its not tho, the hydra boss already drops a massively strong weapon. Honestly it did not need the drop table it has right now.
---
I'm a sometimes Ironman. When I get a drop when pvming with the boys I'm an Ironman, when they get a drop I'm a normal account.

if they refuse to pay jagex leaks you their address and you have to make them pay
---
Why “Dragon Eye” lol, we already have Rigour..
---
This is a bit late but could I also get a link please?
---
The game isn't designed around ironmen. Sometimes changes are made like adding more caves or being able to combine Slayer Helm + Shayzien Helm if they're little to no impact on the game but it's just part of the challenge of ironman mode.
---
Such a waste of my time to have to sit here and explain everything to you so I'm done here. You clearly have no idea about what third party publishing is even though it is right in the fucking name. You've clearly played too much rs and your brain is dead.
---
You made no sense with this comment. $100k is a fair wage, and companies aren't gonna pay 90% of their revenue of 18 years on employees.
---
What is YOUR point?

It’s not retarded if you’re multiskilling. HA while farming and while doing agility
---
Rs3 has a terrible confusing interface. Ss a comped rs3 player i still get lost while playing on a pc.
---
Cant imagine how bad it must be on mobil for new players. Osrs is much more beginner friendly and i cant see how they would fix rs3 without going back on the interface crap
---
My suggestion includes small buffs for longbows and small buffs for throwing weapons like throwing axes, these buffs will be in the form of unlock scrolls that you need to purchase through reward points! 
---
This wouldn't add any BIS gear or change the META, rather make some dead content more usable :)
---
Maybe lowering the amount assigned similar to dark beasts and offering an extend option would have been better than killing off its mechanics. 
---
There is no reason those 2 servers can't talk to each other in the background, instead of client having to resend the password.

Yep but it's really good. And tbh in the context of warring superpowered christian sects having virgin breastmilk as a power source makes more sense than spiral energy from Gurren Lagann or whatever the hell was going on in FLCL
---
They say pretty much every q&amp;a Reddit doesn't represent the whole community nor does the stream audience so how have they collected enough feed back to say no it's not wanted? The system is setup to get everyone's opinion by doing this they've just circumvented the entire system.
---
dcs and ddos still happen, they are watching the players backs, even if it means you dont occasionally get loot from a guy dying -- overall it helps more than it hurts.
---
Anime is the future old man
---
My intention was for Dragon Eye to fall into the gap between eagle eye and Rigour!

It would be a worthwhile unlock for upper mid level players until they eventually unlock Rigour near end game

Wait really?

What's the drop in price?
---
r/gocommitdie
---

---
What did they publish for a 3rd party.
---
Go on
---
Yes
---
Look at zenyte jewellery, it's dropped as a raw resource that needs high crafting to produce an item. Yet it is still a valuable drop.
---
They could do the same with all existing gear and it would not reduce the profit of bossing. While having the levels to make gear match the level to use it
---
Srsly pls tell me what they published for others
---
For the players, yes, for the game, no. Items barely leave the game, people bring maxed gear everywhere because they aren’t afraid to lose it.
---
Stop bitching about drakes. They are fine.
---
Kriek Boon, a man of culture!
---
If it were the same, literally, you would just AFK. If they wanted an interactive boss, they should have made it interactive. Making it a mix of both is bad design, yes.

Good thing for not logging in on wrong websites, is to put your browser autofill your login/password into the real website, if you somehow end up to wrong website, your login/password is not autofilled. That's a dead giveaway

---
Idea, make 100 throw away accounts to trade 10k to the gp doublers. 
---
If you pickpocket them fast enough it doesn't matter if you got caught or not knocking them out because the pickpocket attempt will cancel them trying to enter combat with you and you'll either pickpocket them or get hit like normal without entering proper combat

I'd do master farmer till 55 then move on to ardy knights. Thieving is a bit of a pain to lvl at lower lvls since you're failing so much but once you get past 60-65 it gets a lot better. 
---
The fireball can happen at any point. It's not a constant click per 15 seconds, it's random with only 1-1.5 seconds to react, which means you need to be constantly paying attention. Pair that with the fact that they give garbage loot and the tasks are long as fuck and highly weighted, you have a shitty experience for most players. Sorry you like to be tortured as a punishment for getting a higher slayer level, but most people don't want that. 
---

---
I never normally engage any of those, but around Christmas people were giving out a lot of free things so I was more open to those trades.  This one guy was willing to buy two falador teleports for 500mil, and since I'm a relatively new player that was a lot of money, plus I use the tablets to get around and had them on me.  Traded him and he was legit.  Didn't question it, just used the money to fuel my smithing obsession.
---
?
---
when u say "bring back" you actually mean bring forward. this was added well after the oldschool baseline and is essentially rs3 content.
---
Bucket?
---
Well on a main account, you do these things just to get to 99 or reach 200m exp but once you’ve achieved your goal then these activities are pointless.
---
Like if I want to get 99 smithing on my main, no fucking way am I going to actually mine every resource I need to achieve that, I’m just gonna Google which is the most cost effective method and bulk buy on the GE. I made my first mill turning gold bars into bracelets and even just straight up buying 6k gold bars and processing them all in Edgeville was tedious enough, no way would I have actually mined enough gold to make that many bars.

Your RS password or email password was probably the same as an account you used somewhere else that was leaked. That or you clicked a phishing link. Either way, all you can do now is improve your security and rebuild. 
---
But... But.. the answer is right there in your response. If you make something no one wants to do the solution isn't making it afk so people don't feel like they're doing it... It's making them better, so people want to do it.
---
If jagex can either A. Make them afk but leave the drops as dogshit, so you're wasting your time but at least  you don't have to focus
---
Or B. Make them not dogshit, so you DONT waste your time at all
---
Wouldn't that be better?
---
Maybe it didn’t process. I pay through iTunes and have no problem whether I’m on mobile or pc. 
---
I think increasing their average loot drop (adding in an extra one or two alchables as a common drop) would be a better idea, makes having to put in more effort than a usual task equal better rewards. With this, they'll just become another gargoyle or kurask task where you click them and look back after they're dead. 
---
Glad you liked it! I made the entire thing on Microsoft paint!
---
I write the text on word or in notepad and then copy past it into the image when its ready! The inventory icons are just copy pasted from osrs wiki.
---
Its a fairly tedius and time consuming process depending on the size of the suggestion! This one took me roughly two hours to put together start to finish.
---
I normally just do yellow text on black background but I though the scroll would be better for this one! I have a blank scroll template saved on my computer which I can send to you if you want :)
---
280k is enough to flip arrows and lower level runes. It won't be fast, but it's a bit of passive income to make use of the stack. 
---
Too bad you showed your 39 run energy. 
---
They could honestly make them stackable. The potion they're used in isn't very fun to make to begin with, and if they're untradeable it's not like you can stockpile tens of thousands at once anyway.
---
Yes, get a valuable drop.
---
Congrats! Always nice to see those drops!
---
Already lowered the minimum and maximum you can be assigned by 50, so you can land a task anywhere between like 80 to 130 now. Still takes the better part of two-three hours if you roll a high number though

Not tryna be "that guy" but theres 0 proof here you actually did it the first try lol. Or that you even got it as a drop.

The fact that Jagex's security is "have security somewhere else" is a fucking joke though. I don't bother with 2FA/etc on Runescape since there's absolutely no reason to.

If I were you I'd go max with 60/99/70 and 77 pray. Strongest build imo.

I actually thought this was an official update / rework. Great points and format.
---
It would be way too easy to just use a merch alt so it wouldn't mean much.
---
Ah thanks, don't think i will need to go back ever lol
---
Why is the Exilent client allowed to exist without interference by Jagex even though it has some plugins that other clients have been specifically asked to disclude (Zulrah Helper), and other paid features that are borderline bots (Loot Sniper).
---
Other plugins it have give borderline unfair advantages in PvP, and such plugins have been removed from or never included in clients such as RuneLite by developer choice (Anti-Drag, freeze, vengeance and teleblock timers).
---
I've seen use of this client become more widespread and while I know the topic of third party clients is a general gray area, I feel this client specifically is a clear offender when it comes to pushing too far. Otherwise, if you're cool with such plugins existing, then let it be known so that other big name clients can level the playing field.
---
Only if you pk somebody, they get a unique death animation where they suck on the balls, even with a unique slurping sound effect.
---
Rule of thumb for void is that its stronger against things with lower defense. As the five bosses you chose are hopefully the low defense ones its most likely a good bit better. For a more precise answer you can stick your exact setup into a dps calculator. (Google it) and compare them.
---
Every OSRS player sorry to correct you there
---
Task size should be similar to dark beasts/wyverns. That would make me do the task, this change means nothing to me.
---
Im sure the sound development team can take care of that 
---
make it so you have to use the elite tier kebos diary blessing on an eternal slayer ring
---
Also because MatK will probably need to give permission to give out data, considering I imagine OP will need quite a lot of it.
---
Your odds are slim to none I'd say. But in case you weren't aware that account is now an RS3 account, not oldschool. So you are starting off from nothing here regardless of what happens.
---
oh boy someone else getting that thing i went past 99 for
---
&gt;LUMMY instead of LUMBY
---
Amen

The harness holding the servers to the ground snapped off and they floated away.
---
Quick reminder fellow Aussie's, always make sure your earth harnesses are well secured and are not rusted, else you will suffer being ejected into the stratosphere.
---
Yeah I voted for exactly the same. If I'm getting hit with dragon fire then I want my anti dragon fire gear to protect me from that. No idea what they'd change the attack to in order to keep the mechanic though? 
---
Grats man !!!
---
Weildable range weapon that has the same effects as 'snare' (10 second freeze). Equipable at 70 range i believe
---
Should still use runes, but they should be stored in it and not lost on death like trident.
---
Christ they're annoying. *Complains pvp is dead content and more should be done for it* *wastes time pking for spades instead of looking for actual fights or loot*
---
2010scape post-Nex was best scape

They sell em for 1.2m in Emblem Area cc. Bought mine today

its coz of the contract that makes you grow one

It is almost as if people want to pay for good games.

Hello everyone! I am currently in need of a forum writer for our new clan (Rs Champions). We have just started out our clan and we are growing fast. We are a pvm based guild and our current members range from levels 60-90. We have been up for about 2 days now and have 10 players. Everyone is active and very helpful. THANKS! 
---
Loyalty1207
---
The obvious conclusion there is to add 2FA to website login. Not some dumb removal delay lol.
---
Thank you guys for the replies. That's reassuring then.
---
We got a runner!
---
Oh, It made it more enjoyable for me, but I doubt you ever put any effort in rs3.
---
Petition for them to do this for the 6 year event.
---
They shut down the Aus servers because not enough people were playing :( RIP
---
yes. hand waving things like racism and other forms bigotry by claiming they're infantile w/ age / underage does nobody any good. these people are most likely above the age of 18 or in their twenties- and they will perpetuate and continue their behavior as they get even older, in the workforce, or as possible policy creators. most people who are bigoted do not grow out of their bigotry. 
---
saying that racists are actually underage or infantile [they are, in terms of personality, maturity, and social development] is one of the stupidest circle jerks on this website, along with claiming homophobes or transphobes are actually closeted people when in reality they're just shit people who are usually straight.

lumberjack takes like 10-15 mins to get, pretty sure it is efficient but maybe not now with 1.5t teaks.
---
I feel most of the veterans here
---
Right? Just because the majority of stuff that goes into polls is voted yes on doesn't mean shit. It's more likely due to the fact that jagex is listening to our suggestions and polling stuff they know the majority want.
---
That being said, plenty of updates have been incredibly poorly implemented and needed redesign after additional feedback from the players. We don't know the entirety of the content from some of the polls, because sometimes it's just too much to fit in there. That stuff IS at jagex's discretion, and it's very likely to be scrutinized after release.
---
Poll results should be hidden though.
---
There are? Honestly besides metal dragons there aren't really many I would. Even spiritual creatures are better as you can make 1m+ gp/h at mages.
---
You could do Wine of zammy. Or buy gems from the gem store. You can buy sapphires for 25 gp then sell em for almost 900 gp. Just world hop.
---
gotta consider burn rate though.
---
at least we have aus servers to shut down \^.\^ a fine joke indeed
---
Im doing the exact same thing, but I cant seem to get xp at Puro puro.
---
When did they change this?
---
How did you get 9-15?
---
This community is garbage. U reddit fags are ruining my game. Stop voting yes on everypoll
---
&gt;The fact that Jagex's security is "have security somewhere else" is a fucking joke though
---
Literally every other respectable company works like that, a delay only screws over your average joe instead of somehow helping someone when hijacked
---
This is a dumb comment really, no one asked for mtx, they just dealt with it because they enjoyed the game. Some people dont want to waste their time whining about stuff they have a small chance of influencing.
---
&gt;Unironically playing with sounds on in CURRENT YEAR

Wildy quests will be content i will not be able to finish, it is not fair for my HCIM !!!!!

Have the tanner behind hard diaries to prevent bots.

Problem is it would make escaping harder as you'd now have to go through a gate to get back into the safe zone.

Everyone is coming up to me saying “Donald, how is this fence going to work??” It will, believe me. Walls WORK. We need to build a great wall with big beautiful doors, not a fence, but a WALL.

Upvoting so Jäger can get his ACOG back
---
Hellhounds literally drop nothing, black demons are by far the worst if you aren't doing gorillas, irons are terrible and steels as well. Spiritual creatures aren't that bad but I would rather do drakes over them (I have dhcb though). Kalphite are useless but quick, fire giants meh, ankou meh, greater demons meh, jellies meh, trolls meh, waterfiends bad. Would rather do drakes over all those right now but if their uniques drop to like 100k tooth and 500k claw then I might not like them as much. They do deserve a drop table buff considering their stats and LVL requirement. Wyrms have just as good drop table almost lol.
---
Are there any plans for balancing or quality of life changes towards skilling? Jagex has given a lot of love to PvMers, but the fact that these PvMers get rewards in the form of all sorts of resource loot makes me feel like skilling is just unnecessary... Would be great to see more active or dynamic content that pays comparably to PvM
---
Yeah I literally got it from an elite clue after this task :P
---
Use one account to play and park the the other at V West or w/e the trading hotspot would be to merch, then funnel supplies to the one you play for easy exp. 
---
some guys sure know but are too much of a asshole to actually tell
---
osrs community in a hat..

This is like when youtubers go out and give packets of biscuits to the homeless so they can film themselves doing something "nice" and giving back.

Sounds like you need a better cc mate 
---
Twisted Banshee kills would have tripled this loot.
---
&gt;voting yes on stuff about her are the ones who will be using that master?
---
If you think people voting in game on shit they wont use is fucked wait till you grow up and vote 
---
I do and thats why I play OSRS.
---
How did a combat rework put profit over players?

I believe it was engine side of things that decided it

This is taken from 25\_buttholes its vid... oh wait. WOW, get slapped with the quickness you goblin boi.
---
Me: "he's gonna go for the door isn't he." LOL
---
It was a joke guy. His client is freakin out during the maintenance. Look at the aus server on the image....thats everyone, their nan, and their pa in aus playing.
---
We got him boys
---
Even this would be a lot better and immersive
---
I mean, in that case, it's obvious the skulled or "baited" party had *intent* to fight to begin with, they accepted greater risk and obviously planned on a fight. It's different to my eyes because of intent. I guess it would be a skull trick if the baites party was just trying to defend themselves? But with PVP how it is these days I don't understand why anyone would try to fight back unless they were geared up for a fight anyways, so it goes back to intent I suppose. I mean, is baiting deceptive? Yeah, I think so, its predatory in nature. I guess what you call it is arbitrary, I wouldn't call it scamming but would group it together. 
---
The line is the intent of the affected party - if you're tricked into being an aggressive party you accepted a fight that you likely could have avoided. I guess its just not black and white
---
Jagex still doesn't hide poll results
---
Lol you're a fucking douche and have absolutely no clue
---
It's been discussed before that the engine team is currently focused on mobile support post launch. Any idea what the top priority project would be for them once they can focus on other things?
---
I was always under the impression that when it says name rejected it could either mean that the name is offensive and/or blocked. or it could also mean that an account with that name has been banned in the past. I'm pretty sure that jagex does not allow previously banned account names to be used.
---
Plenty of free time while you train woodcutting
---
Quite possibly, maybe increase the gold sink to say 150k for the butler to bank the sand. Running sand is so boring, considering it's gathering that equals to no XP, I feel there should be a better method.
---
Do you think the 2.5M an hour is consistent, or did you hit rare drops? 
---
Idk I mean the magic level required to achieve the same effect with a spell is pretty low. In the current meta you have to decide if it’s worth the combat level increase to be able to stop people from moving. Ultimately, I think this buffs F2P range pures as it gives them an alternative to having to train magic.
---
I remember back in the day I was so happy when I killed one and I got a black Cape. I looked so badass. 
---
I like everything about this except the +5% damage increase.  OP for alch hydra. 
---
No, I'm 99 and retired from mining...
---
I love these kinds of posts. This is just my raw thoughts as I go through it. I was actually going to go ahead and make a post about this too but I guess you beat me to it lol. I'll probably do a different guild.
---
* A little bit too many minigames but that's fine. Not an issue. Just worth noting there could be less.
---
* The reward crates are a good idea. Instead of a small amount then a large amount I'd have low level then high level. 
---
* Fire dips are a neat idea. Could be a good alternative to poison. Perhaps make the damage increase with your Firemaking level?
---
* No comment on Throwing Axe Smithing. Sounds good.
---
* Advanced Poison Application would make poisoned arrows actually useable without breaking the bank. Good idea. 
---
* Efficient Knife Smithing sounds nice but not really needed. Seems like it would just decrease the price of knives. Maybe a scroll that makes Ava's devices have a 25-50% to return thrown items too?
---
* Advanced Thrown Weapon Training would be bad for the pvp scene (I don't pvp but I know that throwing weapons are used a lot). Perhaps this scroll only works outside of pvp or simply change it to something else.
---
* Dragon eye is a lower level version of Rigour. It should instead be the Chivalry to Piety.
---
* Fire Arrow Specialist sounds good. 
---
* Arrow Catcher sounds funny. Would have to be toggleable but otherwise not that op.
---
* Bow Sight should only be for Longbows. It would make them much better. Maybe increase accuracy on them?
---
* No comment on Ranger Outfit Recolour. Might be better to have it work like slayer helm. Need a boss head of a certain color to make a certain colored outfit.
---
* Quivers sound useful especially with the poison and fire arrow buffs. Perhaps make it unavailable to UIM though.
---
I'd add a new item called an Amulet of Ranging either as a rare chance when performing in any activity or as a purchasable reward. This amulet would offer 10+ Ranged attack bonus, +15 Ranged defense bonus and infinite teleports to the Ranging Guild. This amulet offers the same Ranged attack and defense bonus as an Amulet of Fury as well as an infinite teleport to the Ranged guild.
---
Perhaps add a Taskmaster who offers tasks to players similarly to the Farming Contracts. These could range between "Use 150 bronze arrows" to "Kill 25 Blue Dragons with Rune Darts" to "Kill Blue Dragons with 150 Rune Darts". These Tasks would reward Archery Tickets AND a crate. Tasks that require you to kill a specific monster would have a signifigantly lower number than slayer tasks and would offer a small amount of Slayer xp while killing on a Ranged Task.
---
* Tanner make sense and would be a good addition.
---
* It's good that you're keeping the Fletcher to just ammo. Ironmen would be able to buy a magic short bow straight away otherwise.
---
* Replace armor shop with Armorer. Turns Leather, Snakeskin, and Dragonhide into armor for you for a fee. I dislike balancing around Ironmen but this makes some sense. Perhaps he would also have a small inventory of some low-level armor. Additionally, allow him to sell low level ranged shields, Green D'Hide, Blue D'Hide etc. 
---
* Add the Arrow/Bolt shop to the Fletcher. Could additionally sell Javalins and Darts too as they are ammo for the Ballista and Blowpipe respectively.
---
* Put the remaining stores together. Have a Throwing Axe and Knife shop. Additionally, make the shopkeeper able to smith bars into Throwing Axes and Knives for a fee.
---
I'm excited to see where this goes

What runes in pouch? You using bones to peach?
---
Is RS3 really that much single player? After the release of raids 2 I've been looking for a soloable game with a trading system like the GE that doesnt have team-requiring content as endgame pvm. Whats endgame RS3 like these days? I might want to give the game a try.
---
Not a fan of the 6 knives per bar. It'll result in it becoming the standard, resulting in people doing 5 per bar no longer minimal profit. 
---
Majority of people doing it will be lower level too
---
All cc's are like this. All of you are probably like this too if you have any sense of racial consciousness. It's fun to be unfiltered on the internet is it not? But losers on rebbit like to pretend they are pillars of social justice.
---
I would be more surprised if there wasnt a scam stream active. They have about 99% uptime lol.
---
If you get private world then msb I with salve is decent
---
OP walks on stage. Everybody in /r/2007scape becomes energetic just at the sight of him. It is made up of players who are mostly 0-30 in Runecrafting. He has posted something called "Efficient 1-99 Runecrafting guide."
---
"Runecrafting..."
---
This single utterance is enough to send uncontrollable snickers throughout the audience as they all brace themselves for whats coming.
---
"Slow."
---
A roar of laughter emenates immediately, the loudest ones of all are the players with less than 30 Runecrafting. Several of the RS3 players in the crowd start to wrap their hands around their two inch member in anticipation.
---
"I mean seriously, the only way to level it is through not doing it all. Jagex should, simply put, just give everybody an instant 99 into Runecrafting. I'm not even joking."
---
The laughter begins to sound like screaming as the smell of NEET bodily fluids and and sweat fill the auditorium. Many men are doubled over, their vocal chords to the point of tearing from the constant grating due to there uncontrollable laughter. In one corner, several men have begun voluntarily logging into RS3 and leveling Runecrafting on it instead. Almost all the players have degenerated into an animalistic state of aggression, quietly ignoring the fact that there are worse skills than Runecrafting.
---
"I THINK IT'S TIME WE ALL CONVINCED JAGEX TO EITHER REMOVE RUNECRAFTING FROM THE GAME; WHAT DO YOU SAY?"
---
The auditorium doors are ripped apart as every Jmod runs in, eager to hear player feedback. The frantic scene turns into what can no more than be described as an orgy of whining. The next poll has already been confirmed, and through the power of showing poll results for an ongoing poll, Runecrafting EXP is buffed to the point where it can be maxed in a week of casual grinding. Every basement dwelling person in the auditorium begin cheering. They have done it. OP gets golded over ten times, and he is made an honorary Jmod for his contributions to the game. His player model is an NPC standing outside every Runecrafting area.

It's weird seeing people trading and doing drop parties and stuff, game feels alive again

Plot twist: Jad spawns when you sneak past. 
---
shouldn't Wilson be a blood rune?
---
Well then snare should be available for f2p players to use i guess. I tried pking on f2p, without tb in under 20 wild makes it literally impossible to kill another player. And in the rare chances that you do find someone in over 20 wild, they could easily escape due to the weakness of snare
---
Range is to op already 
---
max pking bores me
---
None. This sub is more then enough
---

Holy shit I spilled my coffee laughing
---
eh, abyss is efficient... slow, but efficient... 
---
Nah Laws, Dusts, Natures for teleports and alchs
---
1- rework it to be useful?
---
2- agreed, but if it's sufficiently costly might still be used if its drain rate is less
---
What do they use it for?
---
You're clearly under the influence of an abusable substance. Rigour is a reward from high level team effort pvm content as a mild drop. Yet you support a 20% damage prayer obtained from a level 50 guild. It would make a lot more sense to introduce  something like a prayer that reduces ammo loss or increases bolt effect chance.

Way too much dev work to do that for every slayer task
---
Yes. Link their credit cards and if they don't pay in time for the deadline, make them auto buy bonds for the amount lent + interest.
---
Maybe lock it to f2p only
---
Upvoting so Jägex can give me my ACOG back.

Salamanders have 2 major flaws, that imo, should be fixed. 1 square of range is trash. And a 5-tick attack speed if dogshit. Jagex please buff.

I started with herb runs to make money, then fruit tree runs and teaks for farming pet. Fruit trees are loads cheaper than normal trees, and afaik have a similar chance at rolling for the pet drop. I’ve just been gaining passive XP from doing 1 tree run a day and all of a sudden I’m 90 farming.

What about similar things to gem bolt tips for arrows as reward. Different effects though
---
I did quests again for the first time since i was 13 and it was 2006.

Sooo much easier than i thought got 30 quests done in 1 weekend. Now at 140 QP and so close to dragon gloves then Barrow

Because it was an awful idea :) 
---
What are the current plans with the Hydra tail?  
---
Are you going to poll anything regarding it?
---
Longer walk than just having your house in rimm. (Yes I know you can do this for yanille) but rimmington still will have more options for hosts
---
It may already have what you're looking for. You can lock  selections and then changes will reflect based on new selections after locking.  Unlocking will let you save or discard those changes.  If you mean compare more than 2 sets, I have some ideas for how to do that in the future.  Thank you for your feedback!
---
can do
---
nah, with arrows you're risking more too. all I ever managed at revs was getting imps and gobs for my slayer task
---
Hey I saw that you noticed something was wrong with Ghrazi Rapier already, but there seems to be something similar with Zamorakian Hasta. Against blue dragons using the max melee button, both abyssal whip and abyssal dagger show way higher dps than the hasta.
---
No, I enlightened someone who was clueless.
---
&gt; it was polled. and failed. so you're incorrect lol
---
&gt; there's a direct correlation. it was the last skill polled. this will be the next.
---
Barely any items left the game through death with the old game mechanics unless the servers were being ddosed. Someone just picks the stuff up since anyone can see it.
---
Wanting to afk so badly is a self imposed limit, not inherent to the game. Why even play the game at that point.
---
Well thats not hard to imagine. People could say they want Corporal Beast in the game, but they might not want to have a whip that can either be dealing 1000s, 500s and 200s from it. Theres nothing weird about that. 
---
Fuck off its not a big deal
---
Love it, broadly hits the mark! 
---
I'd like something that kept you coming back, maybe something like "Bow tuning" giving your bow a (tu) status, yew longbow (tu), And a tuned variation on a bow takes some time but it gains some stat boost. So each time you level to a new tier you return to the guild, do you bow practice and get your bow or xbow tuned and then go out and fight!
---
Last I saw 1m RS3 was worth like 200k OSRS too, so in reality, he's making 400k per hour equivalent. Not great lol.
---
Bolt and arrow quiver combination maybe. Would actually be good in pvp since it saves inventory space. Could fefinitely see it being used.
---
I'd try Jed. 
---
gf ur account

You forgot xp lamps from fossils at varrock museum ;)

Yes ! 
---
I'll support this if we also get a new quest to rescue the poor goblin and replace him with a H.A.M member
---
Money snek and drake are both mentally afk
---
Then this prayer doesn't have to increase the dmg and defense. They can make it that you get a 20% accuracy boost. And then maybe the 15% dmg boost, so its a better version of eagle eye without devaluing rigour that hard.

This is so common that im honestly surprised you felt the need to write such a long guide. Sorry dude but so many people use this method

Almost nothing in the game is as bad as /r/2007scape makes it out to be. Sub is full of champs
---
Yeah I just walked... Everyone is right next to the next task 
---
They do if you get a task from anyone other than konar. Konar has her own slayer drop table.
---
Can something be done about the pathing in the farming guild? If you're at the tree patch and click the bank your character gets stuck, most likely because of the invisible wall for the tree/hespori area
---
If I use home teleport or die I will log into pvp world to use that cheat rather then climb up the stairs in castle. Good if you are also in pvp world just fighting to the death over and over.
---
Putting all trust in email 2fa is stupid, it is NOT the silver bullet against hijackers
---
High-profile youtubers have had their accounts hijacked by people socially engineering their phone provider's customer support to gain access to the auth SMS
---
Adding a delay to runescape's auth has no downside, and even if all else fails it still gives you a safety net of whatever the delay is to give you chance to contact jagex support (lol) and get your account back before it's too late. 
---
Just compare runescape's authenticator to literally any other service. It's the ONLY one I can find where you can remove the auth without either a) a delay, b) the original auth, or c) the support team manually reviewing the auth removal request (which usually requires government ID) 
---
On a more serious note: f2p is not just garbage for gp , but also for xp. It's their business model.
---
somebody seems mad it's becoming slowly socially unacceptable to be bigoted 
---
have fun screaming into the abyss as history leaves you behind lmao
---
Not a stretch, it's intentional.
---
can we be notifief of the brimstone ring's special effect activating like enchanted bolts? the only reason why this would not be useful is in PVP when someone is trying to hide their risk. in that case, would it be possible to have the effect appear for the wielder? 
---
Hey thanks, just weighing up the risk. I'll get back to you soon :)
---
Will Jagex ever ban scammers and beggars?
---
Good read, would let OP breastfeed my niece again.
---
Yes, now you get to enjoy brine rats and jellies in your search for top level content
---
I love this. Makes so much more sense than having it be a Slayer reward 
---
Aren't they off line until tomorrow?
---
Yeah, I’d say at least Zulrah takes some time to learn the different rotations, still the point stands. 
---
Awesome to hear! I looooove seeing data about the game and I wish we had sooo much more than we do - if it's even remotely possible it would be sick to know stuff like how many times every boss is killed every week and even random stuff like how many leaping salmon got fished this week. Can never have enough data!
---
i mean even with the bird nest nerf the price barely stayed high for a month before dropping down again
---
wonderful
---
Why is Zulrah a hard diary requirement and not elite. It is insane that such a hard boss is a hard requirement, it is in a whole other league compared to every other hard requirement.           
---
You have to click the little 'xp' icon beside the minimap. This toggles the xp display. You also have to set it up for specific skills.
---
Full bronze with bronze dagger(p) OP
---
Should raise it to 1750 tbh
---
Now you can play a separate account but keep the main as a bond provider as well as capitalize on new releases. Do things on release and pay for alts bonds. Ironman is very fun but you could also make a pure pk acc. 
---
that's pretty lucky, grats

there's a d&amp;d enthusiast at jagex HQ who rolls a d100 a few dozen times and poof there's your drop table 
---
Good point. I mean they were kinda pricey but they were that way for a reason. I bought them when they were like over double the price.
---
ye true, besides armadyl solos idk where id actually want the defense boosts of rigour. Maybe tob mage tank?
---
Stylish yet illegal 
---
Can't you skip them by saying you have epilepsy or have they fixed it? I remember that was how I used to skip them years ago
---
Fun fact: large number of rs players hate training and only play to pvm bosses or pvp. They hate skilling with a passion and only do it because they have to for quests or diary reqs.
---
Some people enjoy skilling and that's fine. Both can play the game how they want to play. 
---
The people who hate skilling want it to go by as afk/fast/painless as possible.
---
Telling someone not to play because they don't enjoy brain dead repetitive actions for years straight is not an insult. 
---
It was a low-effort rework to force the Bone whip into to being worth more by making another kraken tentacle clone. There's about a billion ways to make a more unique, interesting, thematic, or actually useful unique drop. 
---
The name of my F2P pure is KoochyGang lol 
---
Not entirely sure, but I don't think you can equip the bolt pouch (whatever it's exactly called), so unless you need 3 bolts for anything you don't actually save an inv space, and let's be real, you don't need 3 types for anything.
---
Pikkupstix ;)
---
Reeeeee are you an actual idiot?  I've watched Netflix or YouTube o  every single one of my drake tasks. Even if you are partially paying attention you won't get hit more than twice in a task and you can bring guth, she, bp, or food to heal a full task takes 3-6 prayer pots. You complaining the game isn't afk enough is laughable, you are the problem with osrs. Btw options to not to drakes include blocking or skipping them if you don't like the mechanics.

Why do you keep crying about getting attacked in the wilderness.

It's the wilderness.

---
It's already obvious that there are a few items where the GE price doesn't match the sale price and that quite a few items are volatile, bar Jagex hiring actuaries I'm guessing it would have to be in flat priced objects like platinum tokens which would defeat the point.
---
I feel you, having 99 hp is such a bad idea for Wintertodt, stupid mechanics. 
---
Everything here seems good except the prayer and the bonus to throwing weapons (knives and axes specifically). With dragon knives and thrownaxes being so strong in pvp already, this would make them absolutely busted.
---
Other than that, great work dude, I would vote yes to this.
---
Democracy in my communist video game?!

Zulrah and F2p.

Sounds boring af tbh.

YAAAAAS KWEEN.

Grats !!

Everyone here is busy memeing about the actual idea of the post, meanwhile I'm just sitting here amazed at how good the edit itself looks. Like holy shit, you even took the effort to mask out the spaces in between all the bars in the fence, damn.
---
The only thing I agree on is hiding poll results till after you have vote . I disagree on removing polls ; it would be the ending of the game yet again.  The poll mechanics is a good design all except for not hiding poll results . If you don’t know how the poll affects you or anything about the poll; you can hit the skip option. And only vote on things you understand. 
---
I was really surprised a week and a half ago. Had an elite clue that was in wildy agility course. Teled ice plateau as I usually do and for the first time in a very long time someone was camping the tele. He started to attack me and I just said, "humble clue scroll.". He immediately stopped attacking me and just said, "oh sorry, thought you were doing slayer." Was kind of heartwarming actually... clue reward was shit btw.
---
If you're one ticking them sure, but if you're just letting them get used one at a time you'll only get about 250k.
---
I assumed that people who hated training prayer would take the passive route, and would probably tab out and do something else so they wouldn't reach max efficiency
---
Cringe
---
If that's an annual rate it's extremely low

you're all retarded, you can get your account back via recovery form not email recovery, even if you don't have the original mail anymore

He said he was going to focus on other games once he completed 200m all iirc.

Just take the downvotes in that case. By typing /s you're just ruining your joke. 
---
I wouldn't add that new prayer, otherwise I like it
---
I'm pretty sure obsidian armor with the obsidian weapon and Berserker necklace is better than DH until like 92 HP at NMZ.
---
This! I commented elsewhere as a top-level comment so I'll try to not overlap too much, but the current Ranged Guild feels like a run-down guard barracks than a elite Ranger gathering. 
---
Dharoks becomes efficient at nmz only when you have 90ish hp which at your stats im assuming isn’t the case.
---
At your stats the best exp is with obsidian+berserker necklace with the lowest def bosses in normal rumble. 
---
Best suggestion i've seen in a while
---
Petition to make this the sound of clue hunters getting pkd

He would have been caught by now and ridiculed to shit why would he risk his career to fake kills? That's ridiculous go tinfoil hat somewhere else

Too poor to give gold, have a silver 👏

But I want to help them figure out what a joke is.

Amazing how you conviently disregarded half of my comment.

Honestly Photoshop is perfect since it has so many facets that can be useful for more than digital painting. It's professional - it's got everything you need for the most part. I use clip studio paint Because I find the painterly brushes there are more to my liking and Photoshop was expensive. I have access to PS now but I'm already used to Clip
---
Runelite plugin has the circles and you can adjust the size of them 
---
u/WaterGuy12 would like this.
---
Thanks :) it’s refreshing to hear someone support my addiction. Better than meth...right? 
---
It's clearly a pet that they've had a while. They aren't tormenting it. I've owned numerous species of frogs and some are just loud and scared regardless of how many times you handle it. Nothing in this video speaks animal abuse. They're recording it's natural reaction. They aren't even poking and prodding it, it was a simple gentle stroke. 
---
As a frog owner, I'm not upset at anything in the video. I regularly handle my frogs and behavior like this is not uncommon with skittish species, even if you've owned them for years. It's a natural reaction. 
---
Aka fuck off the high horse bud. 
---
Hey now, that keeps running even during a shutdown.
---
You didnt reply to him.
---
/u/ModMatK
---
I like yours better.
---
What are you using instead of overloads to make it more AFK? 
---
Are the Barrows and Battlefield Teleports still identical?
---
That's a yikes from me, Boss
---
im down. Been looking for people to raid with aswell.
---
Unless they mean a coin pouch thats equipped instead of in my inventory, I'd be cool with that but it'd still take up a space we don't have yet.
---
I’m not getting what you are saying. My friend got scammed, wanted to know a solution. I wanted more people to know the ad on Facebook was a scam so I came here. 
---
ill add you as i get to my pc
---
Temple trekking for bow strings, get like 3k bowstring/h and skip spinning part. R/ironscape for ironman oriented questions btw
---
Then the debt collectors find you...
---
GAHHHH! * Dolphin noise*
---
i suggest adding an archers ring imbue to this
---
Ah true, i forgot you had to manually do them to hit max rates
---
Still can't believe people are high level and haven't gotten overheads.. Thats almost worse then my friend with 60m slayer xp and no fairy rings/spirit trees or diaries done
---
Yeah of course :) its just I really like having the chance to get a pet. Pets are something I have always loved in mmorpg's 
---
I agree, the same love that was given to the warriors guild should be put into the ranged and magic guilds. Magic guild should prolly just be an ethereal tower above the wizard's tower. 
---
This assumes you don't burn any though.
---
Oh just some str pot when I think of clicking on it - otherwise nothing  
---
I just enter in the room, make sure i'm at 1 hp and 1000 absorb. then come back like 10 min later to bring my hp to 1 again and refresh the absorb to 1000.
---
I don't believe you nice try
---
That's a lot of buttholes
---
Ty
---
I hope you’ll forgive me for not going into specifics on a Reddit post. I’ve put in a lot of research to get familiar with these kinds of topics, which I expect most other people haven’t, so I’m trying to keep my explanation abstract. 
---
To sum it up layman style: I’m writing some code that finds things that might be related in data. A super trivial example would be that if the price of rune platebodies goes down, the price of nature runes go up. The way the algorithm works is that it identifies ALL of these relationships, and then you as the user get to decide if you think they’re valid or not. Problem is, it requires a ton of data to be statistically sound, hence this post. 
---
bring ur stuff to the wildy and ill tell u if ur gear is ok
---
The amount of rolls you get is determined when you get it, the rewards inside are determined by your skilling levels when you open it
---
I literally just used 2 weeks worth of Robin for Vorkath bones to find out that Ectofuntus is 1.2m xp/hr.  Fuck POH
---
*smirks in white*
---
Can a toggle be added to tutorial island so you don't gain any xp? Currently, it's a matter of waiting until Skippy is there for a big update, such as the hc and f2p updates. Thanks!
---
What are you trying to say exactly?
---
Oh nice! I use the overload / absorb method typically but you’re right it’s not AFK. So question, doesn’t your overload start to go down very quickly if you’re not at 1hp though?
---
Each question should be given a level req.  
---
Angler question should require the minimum fishing level for aerial fishing.
---
Seed Vault question should require 45 farming (Tier 1 Farming Guild Entrance)
---
Alchemical Hydra question should require 95 slayer.
---
etc
---
Goodluck on your limestone!
---
bcp+tassys is like 55m now :)
---
They feast off rage
---
The only issue I have with magic combat is that it isn't more dps than ranged, and it's more expensive to use
---
Any plans for the lance?
---
Isn't what you're doing right now also 'crying' then? 
---
Worth noting that it's broken down into more manageable parts if you use a guide. A lot of it isn't that tough, just requires patience and time. The stealth section was particularly annoying for me, but managed to get it done in about an hour and a half with lots of fails having not really studied the map.
---
Id say its more of a contest of greed, whoever decides to walk first with the others gold wins. 
---
Thats why so many people play that game, they know they can lose but they also know they can win out, and its all determined by how greedy they are
---
Look at these rock boys losing their precious experience to the quickness, have fun mining copper and tin in the desert hya hya hya hya WOW

Yeah but getting to 77 rc is an ordeal

What an embarrassment
---
That’s actually not the worst idea in the world 
---
Its easy but its long and you always have this sense of it being almost done, but then it isnt.
---
I really want a finish to the fairy tale quests, too 
---
Yes, it did. It was a toggle option on the run icon and made you sit down when using it. It was just before EoC.
---
Can someone make the same picture, but with a wildy ditch instead of the al kharid gate
---
Slayer
---
You can die if you click an overload at 51 HP but then rockcake as you're taking the overload damage. 
---
I went from 74-99 at chaos altar using superiors. Can confirm not a single death. Although one team did empty my brew supply and get me to 60ish health before I made it to ankous to tank. I usually risked ~15m in gear+bones. I liked when they came though, breaks up the monotonous of it
---
I put astrals, laws and cosmics for ourania teleport and npc contact 
---
Then I have a dust staff For airs and earths
---
Then I just have the rune payment in inventory which is whatever element rune I have the most of in my bank 
---
It's not optimal but it made it a hell of a lot more afk for me 
---
If you ever watch a deep wildy max risk pk video youll see how to tank.
---
Almost all those vids have a clip where the youtuber gets caugh be a team and survives like walking trough 10 levels of multi vs 5 people. 
---
This is with 99 def and max gear tho
---
I would hope that most HCIM know enough about the game to avoid dying to a highway man. New players are a completely different story. 
---
slap that goblin boi back to lumby wow

I'd never bring more than 100 noted cause there are teams of pkers who actually kill people at chaos altar. SO funny.
---
I can't be bothered to do medium aroudy
---
Are we any closer to having a multiple account selection on the log in screen and if so, how will it work with the hidden username section?
---
It's so easy to tank with the right gear and 99 def, dont even need to switch from prot mage.
---
Don’t know why you’re being downvoted… I looked for this exact comment, I’ve seen over 10 nuggets multiple times.
---
It’s still all RNG.
---
Well I care very little about pets relative to hc status. I did buy protection for both kq and hydra.
---
You don't have to browse his profile. He usually posts on every single top post and you eventually come across it if you look deep enough.
---
Sure is. I didn't die once during 85-99 prayer and I didn't even have a bulwark. Can't imagine how you would die with it unless there's a huge clan. Also when you train in world with several people the chance of dying is almost 0
---
Should we do a threesome
---
Ah yes, the downvoted just proves it 
---
I think that’s the only reasonable solution here
---
Yeah, but I hop around cc's. Raid cc mostly atm.
---
And surround the castle with this gate and apply it to all worlds so that new players have to kill men for gp till they have enough to leave the castle 
---
This makes me wish we had an OSRS themed Robot Chicken compiled of these kinds of sketched

Ur sister a mister. 
---
Pik means dick in Dutch so I always envisioned him to craft the finest dildos from the best pikkenmix
---
The rewards are super awesome, except the Dragon Eye prayer.
---
Also the minigames need to be genuinely enjoyable, I think we could come up with instead of tons of tiny minigames, one larger minigame that can be played with other players. (Thinking LOTR where the wall is full of archers on top (all the players) and the monsters are charging the wall and we got to kill all the monsters before they destroy the wall, and there would be different difficulty levels like pest control.
---
eat my gooch. 
---
Also you barely use run energy now... can basicly til across gielinor without resting or potting (yes, abit exaggerated)
---
They've made it more beneficial to do on task now by allowing you to use slayer helm with the benefit of shayzien helm (requires kourend hard).  They also just released the molch caves, a new area to kill shamans in.
---
Edgeville furnace. You need to bring gold bars and an amulet mould to a furnace.

There's nothing easy or fast about getting 93 Slayer.

The actual easiest pet is Rocky, either by Pyramid Plunder, Draynor Seed Stalls, or Hams.

Fighter torso, bring, fire cape, narrows gloves next upgrades

Really like this idea.

Because osrs players associate anything in rs3 with EOC and MTX 
---
There's been pushback to literally every osrs update that borrows from existing RS3 content since the game was created in 2013

Last Time i checked tob was 4m a hour at optimal and cox was more gp a hour 
---
thanks for the answer, you quoted the wrong person though :P
---
Just normal mystic boots.
---
And then people use this argument, or any other wide sweeping generalizing argument as a rebuttal, but it still doesn't answer the question. 
---
It makes pures/zerkers too powerful *relative to what?* Because if you are saying "relative to 'mains' of the same combat level", I will point you to the 60 atk piety build which has essentially no real restrictions, has access to rigour/augury/b gloves/bandos/arma/ahrims, etc *while still being in the same combat bracket as high level pures and the 'mains' that would be encountering them*. Are 60 atk piety builds considered too powerful then? 
---
I'm not advocating to give pures b gloves and torsos, or give zerkers bandos and rigour. I'm asking, when people use the argument 'x makes pures and zerkers too powerful', it makes them too powerful *relative to what exactly*?
---
yep
---
i see the wasp on the length of my aaaAaaarm
---
I will do that, thank you!
---
Damn son, that’s unlucky
---
You can't be serious 😂
---
That fucking image
---
I timed myself doing half an hour of Drake's on tasks and managed to kill just over 25 but under 30. Using whip dragon defender tort slayer helm stone boots fighters torso and barrows gloves. No bandos or str boots. Kept a super combat running but not piety

---
Forcing them back to the arena, vrippling them again, and thecyvle repeats, gg
---
Honestly after the free trade update but before EoC was the high point of RS for me
---
&gt;It’s more likely due to the fact that jagex is listening to our suggestions and polling stuff the majority want
---
This is exactly what I thought when I first read the comment op screenshotted. It’s been 5 years, they have a pretty good idea what their players want. Why take the time to come up with poll questions that aren’t going to pass?
---
Coin Pouch is just against the spirit of Old School. It's almost *too* convenient(and yes, I know that's counterintuitive). You don't have to worry about taking your cash somewhere and losing it. You don't have to worry about going back to a bank if you need to buy something. Thieving takes less inv space. 
---
Toolbelt makes quests that were designed around limited inventory space easy as pie, which is a pretty big deal as many iconic quests have that restriction. Monkey Madness/MM2, MEPII, Underground Pass and Regicide, even WGS back in the day you had issues with inventory space because of all the stuff you needed. Also, it frees up inventory space ANYWHERE that you need tools, which will buff quite a few activities. Many of the coin pouch arguments apply here as well.
---
Resting singlehandedly invalidates the number 1 reason to train agility, so it's an instant nope.
---
Happens when scouting raids as well
---
"Okay, the point of pvping should be to get loot for your efforts, correct?"
---
100% incorrect, actually. The point of pvp is to kill the other player. Loot is just a plus. These guys are on a pvp world. They should expect the risk.
---
u wat m8?
---
Maybe you can explain it to me?  I don't understand what hes doing.  
---
Just shut up
---
Did you read the question...? The shortcut isn’t any closer, it just avoids the non-boss hydras
---
That's the best clip I've seen in a while
---
yes boys lets go boys nice boys here we go boys haha boys!
---
Love the ideas here but a few things that are an absolute no.
---
Not a chance the prayer will pass a poll. 100,000,000x absolutely not.
---
Arrow and bolt quiver should 1) only be 2 bolts and unusable in pvp. I also think it should be super rare/hard to farm and should be combined with the asember after fremy and kanda eliet diary's.
---
Arrow catcher is also a no from me. Pvp is in a REALLY good position at the moment and I don't think that's going to do much for the pvp community.
---
The other thing I have an issue with is the games itself. I feel like they don't have a very osrs grind feel to them. People use the farming guild to further their farming experience and xp. I feel like these mini games will be just like the warriors guild, 1 single meta for the unlocks then dead content.
---
Also, nothing really strong for the PvM community? Or did I miss something? 
---
read the full question. It says normal hydra. doesn't affect the boss
---
This? https://reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/a838a4/sorry_to_put_you_on_blast_but_this_is/
---
He also said you’re stupid
---
Ah the ol' "If businesses needed roads then they would just build them instead of the government" argument. Never taking in to account that if the government doesn't want to pay for a road to my house then a business looking to make money sure as hell isn't.

That's 12.8m/hr with 28 min trios.  More profit you're able to do duos.
---
So no it doesn’t because no one in the right mind is going to use that and steel skin if they can use rigour. Stop being retarded please 
---
*youuu*
---
doesn't affect the boss. clearly states normal hydra
---
No problem! I imagine the wiki admins also wouldn't mind helping you. May be a good idea to join the wiki discord and ask them 
---
He was making a post to use the same logic and sentence structure as the OP to show how stupid the OP sounds.
---
Sure, because a witch hunt was made against us and taken largely out of context. I don't have "too much time on my hands" to respond to some comments. 
---
I have a group of friends I work with that all play with me. 2 of us voted FOR the new way to get the anglers outfit because we never took the time to do FT. We did Wintertodt and Agility. But the other two guys voted no for a new avenue to get Anglers because they want everyone to have to do it. He feels it's a "rite of passage" kind of thing.  
---
I just mention this to shed some light on how other players think. We all won't always agree, and there's no telling which of these choices is better for the game.
---
Right before this clip you also leaked your bank pin on stream.  If you care about your account you might want to reconsider streaming while drinking
---
If the new prayer takes 2 hours to get and rigour is 70m. Guess what's gonna happen to the price of rigour.
---
&gt; Stop being retarded please
---
Ya'll are looking for r/Libertarian get your government system talk out of here.
---
I recently just reset one of my houses from finishing another because I forgot to lock it :( 
---
It was certainly not just before EoC. It was like, a year after they came out with the GE. Like somewhere around 2008-2009.
---
 normal hydras still require 95 slayer 
---
That would devalue my no combat level 3 only pvp world HCIM. 
---
Is this your tweet? If it is don't waste time getting ultra fertile soil. since the new bottomless compost bucket came out it's way more efficient especially if you're a normie and can just buy it.
---
I wonder how he got that name
---
I read each question carefully and considered whether it would be a great addition to the game or not.    I then voted yes to each question since they are beautiful.  
---
What are presets? 
---
Honestly, stamina potions are way more overpowered relative to a rest option.
---
Bone voyage to get you go fossil island is all you need I believe 
---
You guys are hitting all the naive libertarian checkboxes lol.
---
What’s so stupid is after they receive stuff, they hop worlds and continue to beg. They aren’t there to get an armor set to complete dragon slayer. They’re there just for money 
---
I kind of want the lend item thing from rs3 in the game.
---
Does it have to be? You're still free to see the fire whenever you like, but a real fire would fit better with the MM part of MMO.
---
Sorry, I quit a little while before eoc. What are presets?
---
Mine was recovered within an hour. Not sure about it taking a month
---
This hits the nail on the head for me. If the key passes it will 100% kill any motivation I had to do slayer. I was finally enjoying the skill for once just because of the potential to see those drops even on tasks I didn’t like as much.
---
I finally enjoy slayer for once which lets me get to 75 and then they want to take away the one thing that lets me enjoy it :/. Guess I’m never leveling slayer again if this passes.
---
It is but the total xp you’re earning per hour is usually at least 100k+ when you include the xp from combat skills
---
I like how the elitist feel like them and only them should be able to vote and feel like that because they vote no to everything no one should be able to vote yes.  
---
If I can not do said question in poll or has no effect on me I will skip it. 
---
Yes because the dhcb exists the price of the tbow has decreased? Rigour is the BIS and will be the best in the game probably forever. 
---
BIS items will stay in their place at the top. This new prayer wouldn’t take 2 hrs to get, you’re pulling that out your ass being disingenuous, the op didn’t clarify anything regarding points required for it, it’s simply an idea.
---
&gt;&gt;stop being retarded please  
---
What if I told you the dragon was made of steel 😲
---
no thanks
---
I miss surprise updates. I wish that they atleast did some stuff rogue that weren't considered "integrity".
---
This community should not have a final say in anything. We should not decide the exact 3d model to be used for a price of content. We should not decide the rewards for a quest. We should not decide the majority of updates, honestly.
---
Game designers are there for a reason and I feel like because of the state of RS3 we just don't trust them so we feel that having the power to vote on everything is good but honestly it makes new content stale before it even releases. 
---
Seeing teasers are one thing, but seeing the content be built from the ground up over 6 months makes me not as excited to play it. 
---
RUNECRAFTING BAD
---
None of those affect exp rates. I understand if people are worried about "if we make this easier why can't this also be easier" arguements but those are simple QoL improvements. 
---
Their drop table is shite for the amount of attention required to kill them. It was either buff the drop table or nerf the mechanics and I'm all for the later. Why should i give slightly less attention then demonic gorillas for a drop table arguably worse than their lower lvl counter parts
---
Ignore list is already full from the 400 other advertising bots.. 
---
Dont nechs in slayer tower drop much better loot for melee
---
Double frick!
---
Society
---
I disagree.  Every single player playing the game one day wants to reach content they cannot access atm.  Why shouldn't they vote yes to have better content or vote no to things that would not benefit them?
---
maybe if it said something like "that isn't your fire" when you try to cook on someone elses. or if you are an ironman you can't use someone elses fire?
---
Exactly, there is nothing wrong with an annoying mechanic but make them worth the time and effort by increasing the drops or experience.
---
I wonder what the average total level of people that vote is. When I was a noob I never voted because I didn't care. I was just cutting trees. Now that I'm almost maxed I read every blog, watch all the streams, and vote in every poll. I just wonder if the people voting now don't already meet these requirements? Unless altscape plays a significant role. We should get Mod Lottie on this!
---
lol self burn tsssss nice lol

that's what you get for using osbuddy pro ^^^ouch ^^^though
---
Fat stacks of arrows/bolts, runes, cannons, cannonballs, etc.
---
It's like you are killing NPC's with better loot. 
---
Hahahahah! So cute though when you see something like that happen. I remember when something similar happened with one of my previous girlfriends
---
I was gonna write about the psychology behind why bankstanding in max gear for hours means you’re a psychopath.
---
That’s a great example. That indeed is a fair critique of easyscape 
---
...it's a medieval fantasy game and that's the part the doesn't make sense to you?
---
People love to collect crap. 
---
The only suggestion I would ever agree with along these lines is the Dwarven Army Axe.
---
 Still requires an inventory space, doesn't completely remove ALL tools from the equation like moulds and some more niche items, stays in your bank meaning you actually have to think to bring them still. 
---
Would OSRuneScape still be the same game if you weren't able to forget your chisel on your birdhouse runs? 
---
Ahh kk my bad forgot
---
nice sisters
---
And OS players aren't cool enough to smoke the 420.
---
At least you're using protection.
---
Sure!
---
they aren't indian you brainlet
---
Do you not have either 200 qp or 1500 total? Or did you miss that part of his statement. 
---
Why you would drop your cape on the ground. What makes sense about that to you? 
---
Support.
---
They added bonfires for fire making to offset that. Also who trains fire making by burnings logs in current year?
---
Vanilla client master race. Don't @ me scrubs
---
With what I have heard about what Jagex pays, they would have a hard time finding a very experienced software dev.
---
I am! I may respond a bit slowly because I'm at work but I'm still checking new comments on this thread! I sent you a link!
---
Who cares? I'd rather not have to buy so many stam pots anyway.
---
Of course!
---
Fuck 
---
The total exp value is meant to be considerably higher than what an average 1250 total level would have. A niche account that has a lower total level would need to have, from my point of view, a considerably higher experience gained due to only practising a particular set of skills.
---
In short, it should probably be a value that somewhat resembles a similar amount of active hours played, slightly offset by the factors mentioned.
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind this but ranged is already really strong, I don't think it requires any further buffing for now. And yes, I do understand that it wouldn't make that big of a difference nor do I not want this because it's from rs3 I just don't think it's the right time for something like that
---
/r/punchablefaces
---
it is a bad idea though. that stuff may not be something I can *do right now* but it's still stuff which impacts the game I play. we should be able to vote on anything in the game, regardless of whether we can access them right now or not.
---
A toolbelt would ruin so damn much 
---
You literally say "ok yeah you can buy xp" it doesn't matter if it's worth it or not. The fact is you CAN buy your way to a max cape if you're wealthy enough. I'm surprised you didn't mention being an ironman because iirc ironmen are locked out of microtransactions 
---
spending nights killin bandos, whoah 
---
Because you'll get used to not caring about giving tools back to the leprechaun, so after 100 farm runs you'll say "why can't he hold 1000?".
---
Looks about right.
---
That's a shit reason. Jagex can fuck with the numbers anyway since they're the only ones who know how many people voted and what their vote was. If they say 85% of people voted yes, we have no way to prove them wrong. We're sacrificing integrity for the illusion of trust.
---
Con levels are expensive past 83, and stews are "free" (and really dont take long)
---
This would remove a lot of PVP accounts from the voting pool, making it easier to kill off PVP update suggestions. Support.
---
I feel votes should have requirements based in the context IE pvp you should require kills
---
I mean you CAN buy your self to max cape on OSRS if you really think about it to. 
---
Less regular npc drop table rolls because the key will replace a normal drop 
---
Resting doesn’t “devalue” graceful. 
---
For way more then 5gp
---
How to get double xp
---
Document stuffing. 
---
Damn I was gonna be clever and say that ''Well you, but you do need 2'' until I realized I wasn't being so clever. 
---
Honestly though, cool concept. Useless, but cool!
---
When I’m in a long boring meeting, sometimes my hand in my mind unconsciously starts tapping as if I’m spamming the shit out of the spacebar to get through boring dialogue.
---
Just kind of funny that you mentioned it but in RS3 there is a key ring on the tool belt where you can add all your keys. You have to have one small favor done to use it but it does exist. I understand your point but I don't see these specific updates being over simplifying but I completely agree there is a slippery slope for QoL compared to everything being automatic.
---
Me on the left, minus the talking.
---
I voted no on hydra bones and yes on the other two because people already do hydra tasks and don't do a ton of drakes or worms, as well as being a slight prayer buff it's also a buff to whatever monster it is attached to.
---
Jad plug in removed, so the RL devs must have agreed with you there 
---
Right clicking pouches is an RS feature 
---
No such thing as zulrah helper 
---
With that being said I agree that the client is much more convenient than the default, I guess easy is just subjective. Anything Jagex says is OP runelite will remove 
---
Is EZscape going to rs3?
---
maybe rs3 is for you 
---
I think there are a ton of setups so it could get pretty populated very quickly. I'd rather add some sort of function for users to make their own loadouts that they prefer. I could save it in the browser local cache which would persist on a single computer as long as you didn't clear cookies/cache. I also considered saving it locally to the users computer as a text config file, which would persist as long as the user didnt' delete that file. I could also store other options/selections in this config file which would be useful longterm I believe. Thank you for your suggestions!
---
There are trolls in the tunnel outside keldagrim, the entrance is north of the relleka Slayer cave.
---
Yeah, idk why they said it goes WITH the lore to make this change...
---
By the original entrance to keldafrim before you do the quest. East of rock crabs. 
---
How RS3 users smoke weed 
---
Are you a share holder?
---
Yes and it cost him $13k (or something like that can’t exactly remember) even when he was mostly buying keys when they were on offer, took him a few years only playing the account an hour or 2 at a time when there was a good promo that was on
---
You’d still use stamina’s questing, RC and a few other things. So Zil isn’t “literally” the only thing. 
---
I made sure it was extra hot and juicy before I sent it. 
---
Source Please?
---
I know not everyone with the requirement would have voted the poll, however 95 slayer isn't a rare accomplishment as far as skills go and around 60,000 people are eligible to kill Hydra atm. 
---
Mind your toes!
---
The main reason they work that way is that if you die, you pay for your items in death's office to have them returned. You can run to your grave similar to OSRS but it's almost always better to simply pay for your items back with a few mill. 
---
Efficiency people, people who haven't got 50 yet.
---
Bonfires were a mistake tho imo. Made firemaking from fast but not afk into fast afk 
---
Tool belt and coin pouch we’re all pre-eoc. 
---
Efficient people?
---
Sounds ok, but prob engine work
---
Prayer isn't slow or crap xp as it is. It's also been increasingly cheap recently. Combined with the noted hydra bones, other bones will continue to drop, especially dag bones. So no, it's not just that someone doesn't want other people to have it harder. 
---
2200 poll req and streamer electoral college when? 
---
Also make it mandatory to kill them while training defense! 
---
Don’t be mad mr pure
---
Maybe not in GP terms (I know its untradeable)... but if you can rest freely anywhere, does that not make graceful less convenient?
---
It was around 25 hours of I remember right and he spent over $10,000 over a year while waiting for the best promos. Hardly a realistic method.
---
&gt;You must have not played rs3 much or at all because you can’t just buy xp like everyone thinks
---
5 seconds later...
---
&gt; Now you can buy xp your not wrong but nobody buys it because the majority of rs3 players know it’s not worth it to spend IRL money on because it’s such a small amount compared to actually going to train what you had in mind 
---
In other words, you absolutely can buy XP. You just don't like to admit it because you realize how shit of a system that is?
---
The good side of $11
---
Yeah, those are a lot stronger though since they can hit you harder and from a distance. 
---
I failed to account for pk-only accounts that do not have a main account that meet one of the requirements. That should probably be another 'Con'.
---
are you me?
---
They're 1m each in 'Bh and chill' and no mm fee if you buy from ranks.  Bought one last night.
---
Yes.
---
the gower bros
---
Bongholio
---
Or to make a fire without the wood. Could be used by anyone. That would be pretty cool.
---
Gunna give this a try, thanks dude! 
---
So you want EZ-scape with the old combat system is all your saying. Got it. 
---
where is the ancient staff 
---
We'll never get more Slayer updates in the game with that attitude
---
only if i can dismantle godswords again
---
What happens at 77? I'm currently level 60
---
Bonfires were garbage. I got 50-99 in a weekend. 
---
I mean that's better, but I'm still not a fan. 
---
&gt;stop being retarded please
---
Oh I definitely agree, and I have no set deadline for anything. I enjoy working on this project, and all of the interest and support is definitely a driving force for me to continue, because I know other people besides me will benefit from my effort. I'll continue to plug along on my ever-growing to-do list, prioritizing bugs and broken features and adding new ones when the waters are calm. Your guys suggestions are awesome as well and give me new ideas I'd never considered. 
---
This is what Gnomes should ride into battle. Better than terror birds.
---
I want free acid...
---
Because the demand has gone up buy the supply hasn't
---
It just depends on how powerful the rest effect is. If rest restores you quick enough, you can possibly travel faster than with graceful, which would in fact devalue graceful. But, I think you're banking on this not being true.
---
Devalues potions &amp; Gracefull set. Which it's a solid enough argument for me to vote no if it ever gets polled.
---
I’ve already got all the uniques for drakes so nty 
---
Dungeoneering was fantastic, it highlighted every aspect of RuneScape in a fantastic way. It was fun learning the most efficient way to run a floor, and then be able to casually run floors with your friends of all levels. The bosses at the end were great as well.
---
Now in rs3, everything is stackable, you can bind a full armor set, and the bosses die in one hit, so not even dungeoneering survived.
---
Please for the love of god remove scouting. The best design for raids should have players going into a raid with no knowledge of what they'll have to do until they start the raid. People should gear up prepared to do any room available in the raid. 
---
Note that pre raid scouting is only available to third party clients and gives users of those clients an unfair advantage. This is strictly against your own game rules.
---
Just thought I'd fix some info here, so you get either lamps, stars, cosmetics or supplies from treasure Hunter with the latter 2 being rarer.   
---
Stars give bonus xp in skills which means when you train you get 2x xp until all that bxp is used up. These are either locked to a certain skill or can be used on any skill.  
---
Lamps on the other hand just give xp and are either locked to a skill or can be used on anything.   
---
Every 2 days there is a promotion with the majority giving a special type of lamp/star - none of these are skill locked.
---
scouting sucks tbh. even with self scout solo setups its still going to be like 90s on avg to find an okay raid which is just downtime spent leaving and re-entering.
---
It had the word cum in it man.
---
Can we have a minigame that trains xp and rewards you with beggar coin worth 0gp? Thanks.
---
Look bud, I was a long time RS3er. Never wasnted to go to OSRS because I really didn't want to start over. RS3 is the easy version of RuneScape. Sure it will take you hours to max or whatever but it's not even close to comparable to OSRS. I went back to RS3 about a year ago and get 4 99s in one month. It's a joke. Accept it.
---
No the new meta will be voting no to the scrolls so that we can continue scouting around the miserable rooms to do
---
Yep. You have 5 presets by default, and can buy 5 more for a total of 10.
---
Why should it be 100 or lower? Let's assume 5 guys of 70 combat want to complete a raid, why do they deserve a penalty? The raid will be harder to complete anyways.
---
At least have 43 prayer and an Ibans staff and imbued magic shortbow.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barrows/Strategies
---
In the blog they state that it's eating speed would be increased, so that would likely deal with that issue
---
Shit tier 
---
They may bounce back a little bit as there were likely a lot of people dumping stock when konar could drop 2.5k of them was found out from the overall panic of it. That being said I wouldn't expect to see much in the way of it though.
---
You wouldn't need to tell a MaW kid to do that. They already are
---
&gt; these people look uncomfortable
---
The reason why he looks uncomfortable is because this is new for him. It is his first day on the job so ofcourse he is going to be nervous. The guy will fit in after a few weeks when he is more relax and gets the hang of the job.
---
Get ready for disagreements on it devaluing the graceful set
---
same meta tbh, irons already just buy 3cs if they wanna solo efficiently.
---
At least make an option for it in settings like being able to hide Player Attack options and such. 
---
A lower rate? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of resting??
---
Therre definitely was a sweet spot between 2007 RuneScape and EOC, where a lot of people actually also enjoyed the game. I have fond memories of Korasi pures, Dungeoneering and also a bit of summoning, even though I never understood it fully. 
---
What monsters pet is this? 
---
Scouting is pretty balanced, i don't see why it should be removed
---
I am against this . All  they need to do is  hide poll results that is all . That fixes everything ; all this does is alienate certain players ; doesn’t  really fix the root issue 
---
I fucking hate this guy
---
Level your slayer. 
---
LOVE YOU
---
Yes this is absolutely the best idea
---
It’s just a middle part
---
or mini games like pc pest contol is group content,  rest would be group pk or group bossing whit clan mates 
---
How? Rcing is slower and more click intensive, the banking is super annoying as well. Thieving you just do ardy knights spanming 5 on the mouse key and click the coin pouch every minute or so. Agility is like the faster less click intensive version of rcing
---
People compliment it every time I log on lmao but I've been seeing for a while that theynsw me on reddit and I had to find it finally. 
---
I think more reasonable requirements are the same as to join clan chats 
---
I've just dc'ed twice in MM2 caves while in combat and came back alive..
---
Wow bro, super epic. No one knew that's how runes worked!
---
Imagine being such a rich tosser you think anything but private school and white kids is  "3rd world"  
---
SAD!
---
I don't like the fact that they will potentially remove scouting.
---
Playing devils advocate, but explain why is osrs harder to level when the only difference between the two is because it takes longer. Imo that does not make it harder and if anything rs3 leveling is harder. Not because it's faster but because the faster methods generally take more effort to maintain, ie crystalize with light form.
---
Same but we are the small minority that loved those times. The data doesn't lie. Osrs started rising from the lowest peak of, 6k players online, once G.E &amp; f2p was introduced. 
---
I like it.
---
However, it's not a good enough "boon" to get people who don't care that it makes sense.
---
The skill needs way more than just that if it wants to get 75% of people saying yes.
---
This is oddly specific, did this happen to you? 🤔
---
Why does scouting need to be allowed? Why should the player be able to know what their raid is before starting it, and why is it okay that this "mechanic" is only available to users of third-party clients?
---
Doesn't it seem much more interesting if your team has to be prepared to do any room that the raid could throw at you, rather than waiting for 5 minutes between each raid for someone to find an easy layout with 3-4 of the same 5 bosses and the same 2 puzzle rooms?
---
Most players hurt by the restriction are maxed rune pures, range tanks and barrows pures. Dont get me wrong it would be nice for it to be completely gone but if they insist on keeping it 100 cmb would be a good step. 
---
He wants the idle position, he literally says it.
---
I think the idea that a ~10% increase of ore per vien every 30 seconds is nullified by not having to scurry around for 4+ seconds finding open veins every 30 seconds. Many people have done analysis of this and came up with similar results. 
---
Hey same year as me!
---
how could you say scouting is a good mechanic lmfao. It's fucking horrible game design. They should just let us choose bosses and 1 puzzle or something. (hell even make it a penalty to choose ur own boss by adding 1 extra combat room)
---
Same but we are the small minority that loved those times. The data doesn't lie. Osrs started rising from the lowest peak of, 6k players online, once G.E &amp; f2p was introduced.
---
Whaddayatalkinabeet?
---
Was this question regarding sparc mac? If so yes he was around way back. He is OG just like chris.
---
This actually makes a lot of sense.
---
it's not incomprehensible but u clearly are when ur missing my entire point LOL. the point is people voting on this poll don't even know what it does, not that the mechanic is some simple ass shit. go back to school and rs3 retard
---
You can get 350-800k exp/hr though. Rcing is shit no matter what you do. You can rc for 20 hours to get the kind of exp you get in 1 hour of cons lol
---
That’s also a good point. Thanks for the input. :)
---
I love dungeoneering. Thanks to dungeoneering I got my life back for a few years.
---
I did this from like 70 to 99 and no pet for me, that's like 200k gems
---
Don't people call RS3 Easyscape because of the absurd XP/H methods, which is even higher than Wintertodt values?
---
Wouldn't this make more sense with a Fire Cape?
---
which would render super energies useless.
---
So does cumulative. It's not like there was any division or emphasis
---
agreed, though it seems silly to make it \*not\* toggleable in the first place.
---
*sees poll results*
---
&gt; "yeah I might as well just vote yes to everything"
---
I really hope they hide poll results before warding is polled..
---
If you hate the skill dont train it?
---
Retard
---
yeah thats gonna be a no from me dawg
---
...what? I don't see how that follows.
---
I got my coal bag and I fuckin dipped out of there, never again. 
---
Exactly and that's what makes warframe f2p model so good, is that it rewards grinding and grinding is the name of the game.
---
Your username is basically an amalgamation of fecal and cum. 
---
It drops from Cerberus but you need a rock hammer in inventory. 
---
yes please. its dumb af, all the pures I see who try to raid do it because they want a challenge yet all this mechanic does is just gimp the team as a whole.
---
Olms the hard part of the raid and it does not downscale at all. If the purpose was to allow lower levels to raid it does the opposite of that, right now its basically a hard req to have 115 avg. Same for losing points if someone dcs. If you do a 4man raid and one guy dcs you get like 40% less points while they remain logged out.
---
Something more convenient for everyone that logs in isnt wanted because people that grinded for something don't want it devalued? Like I see the point, but it seems silly. It's like saying better xp methods shouldn't be made because you're already lvl 99
---
I do actually 
---
"Resting" was in the original RuneScape; you used to have to find a bed or carry a sleeping bag to recover from fatigue.
---
https://runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape_Classic#Fatigue
---
Scouting is fucking terrible in its current form. I want to raid, not run up and down stairs hoping for RNG to give me a playable raid.
---
RuPaulscape
---
wait how
---
its always peak hours for everyone that plays because we're all neckbeards that don't sleep anyway
---
I think as long as you can ensure a random selection of raids will have low variance in points/hr, you won't be needing to put in scrolls or remove scouting (as that becomes rather pointless, too) 
---
The activity itself was kinda fun, but imo it felt more like raids than a skill. I'd rather they keep adding dungeoneering-like content in the form of raids than a dungeoneering skill. That way it's still optional.
---
how much do dragon hunter lances sell for these days? im thinking of selling a part of my bank to get one 
---
Oh yes! Oregon trail all throughout elementary school, started RS in 5th grade but didn't learn to be able to play at school until 7th grade, which in my school district was the start of Jr High.
---
Same people that say "Just don't forget things" are the same people that use bank tags.
---
From now on my default response to anything your gonna say will be: get out of PvP world. 
---
And the screen shot just proves that skillers can be just as "toxic" as PvPers. 
---
This is a fantastic idea, but could be tough for lore. Wonder if there's a fix for that. 
---
I see what your saying. And the people that grinded graceful are gonna have high agi so running is already easier for them 
---
Yeah some of the updates they put out are pretty great, plus the old school team in general are sick imo

i like both games and each have positives and negatives

or
---
&gt; Now you can buy xp your not wrong 
---
Pick one. You're contradicting yourself.
---
The fact that you can't choose the skill doesn't change it to 'you can't buy XP'

bro this is OSRS not capitalism.

---
For real, I main a zerker and quit raiding because parties would never take me due to scaling
---
True, but you could say that about any other spot on the table. So its kinda flawed logic.
---
This is all because monster weakness is not a thing anymore. It's just a simple solution that i can't believe the JMods haven't though of yet.
---
The only reason why the Blowpipe works so well against everything is because Monster's have such pathetic defenses that pretty much **anything** works on them, without mentioning the massive buffs your character gets from potions, prayers and equipment. This is one of the reasons why i love Vet'ion as a boss so much, he gives the middle finger to pretty much any attempts to Mage/Range him and gives value to crush weapons since Skeletons **have allways been weak to crush**. This is a cool mechanic that not only gives value to weapons but it keeps (Or at least it should) one weapon from being good at everything.
---
This is why also PvM has been turned into such a braindead task, you can just kill anything with pretty much everything thanks to the massive buffs we get from things i've mentioned above. Potions, prayers and equipment pretty much turn you into a demigod who can't be damaged by anything and just steamrolls through everything. How is that challenging and engaging?
---
If you are going to have a monster that is weak to Slash then make sure that their defences against anything else count too, otherwise its a wasted mechanic and whatever method you intended the boss to be fought with is pointless.
---
Why would that be bad? If I remember correctly you don't even lose the gp in the coin pouch even on death.
---
\*smirks*

Top side nodes of mlm deplete on a time basis rather than the bottom floor. So it doesn’t really matter if 2 or 30 people are on the same node.

What a load of crap
---
You can help balance that by slowing down the tick speed of crafting the potion, similar to anti-venoms then. I don't think it's too hard to figure out a way to make farming Nightshade less of a pain, but more a matter of actually doing it.

How long did Bones to Peaches take you to unlock would you estimate?
---
Well, I'm in the right subreddit for people seeking to turn back time
---
Solid points. You’re probably right 
---
Yeah a hard clue has been what's guiding my play for like the last month.
---
Need access to Jiggig, so had to level fletching and range, which made me do animal magnetism. Now I need Regicide for the next step, so if I'm gonna need Underground Pass, might as well get to 50 magic for Iban's Staff, and actually I can make a decent chunk of money making and then enchanting opal necklaces, so might as well get to 55 magic so I can alch while getting my agility to 56.
---
But for you there isn't really a need for graceful for arceuus favor. Runelite marks all the spots you need to find the books. Took me like 45 minutes. 
---
This... incoming scam potential
---
I play on a pure, was thinking the raid was more like dungeoneering and not so much like elemental workshop. My bad, even then it seems like multiple of the potential rooms/bosses are pretty aids, so it'd suck to have to reroll every time you came up on one that's a supply sink.
---
Are you suggesting that the game should be based around irons?
---
But you might as well get the 56 for Regicide.
---
Didn't vote yet but what is your issue with the key?
---
7kc here, got some sweet seeds tho
---
I think this is really solid except the prayer. Think people would be happy if they were removed. The quivers aren’t really op don’t see the reason for complaining. 
---
Jaywalking only hcim
---
You would be able to do that with a coin pouch. The point is it's always on you and doesn't take up an inventory slot so you always have your coins. If you buy something from the GE the money is withdrawn from the pouch.
---
thank you for your service

I think the main issue the polls face are the total noobs. While it’s not unthinkable that a super rich dude would make hundreds of bot accounts and drop 500m+ in bonds just to altar poll results, I find it unlikely. 
---
I think there should be some restrictions and you brought up some reasonable ones. I only really take issue with the whole “You should only be able to vote if you can do (x)”
---
That's a different topic, but I'd agree with that.
---
They really should have made those drop from the KDT instead of the dusk mystic robes 
---
Yes you're right and I always tell people the same thing
---
If they were more interactive, wouldn't people be even more turned off from killing them for a task? 
---
I’m saying that that’s the reason they were popular, hence why they were fun. If they added consistent consumable rewards from mini games they would see consistent play, and would become “fun” again.
---
I don’t know what you mean. Resting can just be a cool aesthetic thing with the full graceful. Doesn’t increase run regen or decrease it. A toggleable animation is what I’m saying 
---
Yeah it would ruin every skill that involves banking, most noticeably runecrafting, smithing, and crafting
---
There's a sulfur vent (works for cooking) 1 tile away from the TzHaar Bank chest.

NO ONE IS GOOGLING THE MECHANICS FOR THE POLL. PEOPLE DO NOT RESEARCH CONTENT THEY CAN'T DO THIS IS NOT A PERFECT WORLD 
---
Adding more attractive developers devalues my chad only ironman account. downvote.
---
False. 15xp in slayer
---
Then say nothing? Lmao I also didn't say the bp is balanced. I feel it's balanced as a range weapon, but comparing to the other attack styles in the combat triangle I'll agree that range is over the top by a fair margin. Honestly I feel like nerfing the blowpipe isn't necessarily the answer though, they should add some quick hitting items for mage and melee that are in the same bracket. Like an orb for mage that can autocast quickly but doesn't offer much in the way of offensive bonus, and say something like a Katana for melee that would take up both hands like the current shitty 40 att katana does but attack at like 3 ticks so it'd be an actual effective weapon.
---
Underrated comment
---
Why are you talking about skills then if you don't know what you're talking about
---
I wouldn't mind either of those rooms if they were made comparable to crab/rope.  I still do rice and sometimes rope risk(after 20 min scouting, it looks good enough).
---
Dungeoneering is my city
---
You had to rest to be able to gain xp again. There wasn't even a run option in rsc. Only walking
---
I wasn't playing during that time. Any idea what the GP/H ended up being?
---
Good. Go play rs3 if you want stupid shit like that. 
---
Yeah, that's what I do. My last 3 attempts, I panicked at the healers and died. 
---
He has made this thread to say PKers shouldn't attack him BECAUSE they can't kill him, then says he doesn't bring lots of bones because he might die to a 20 man team in multi. What does that statement imply? You may be able to read, but apparently can't think beyond a single block of text at once. 
---
So does Mor-Ul-Rek
---
What’s the build for the lowest actual skill pking? What’s the transition from there to more demanding pk styles? 
---
No I’m saying people use that garbage logic anytime an update even remotely pertains to irons 
---
Hours? Using the library assistant without RL only took me about 30-45 minutes. Although not as exact as runelite, you are given a pretty narrow section to look in when you talk to the assistant.
---
Just make it 1250 total or a 99, that was most accounts will be able to participate even if they're niche or a pker.
---
But personally I completely agree with this sentiment, having a broader knowledge of the game and being invested in the game should definitely be a consideration when voting for changes which can severely impact the game.
---
Yeah, tbh I think nowadays there would need to be some consistent rewards to be played, my opinion I dont know everyone elses, but for me id play the minigame because I love them! Even with mobile it would be more active then if there wasnt mobile, 
---
I agree with OP. Paying the same membership fee should not mean having an equal say. 
---
That mindset assumes we are all equal, we are not.
---
I mean you'd have to be a rich girl to afford all of these
---
Dude might be a brainlet, or maybe he was just trying to trigger into writing a paragraph about him lol
---
Oh how lame 😘
---
got ranger on 6th. not even btw :)
---
I can't raid yet so I can't really say, but skipping 2 rooms per raid is probably still useful, right?  And if they balance isn't perfect and there are some rooms that are just more annoying than others, than likely they would raise to be a bit more valuable than others, no?
---
Also it's bonus loot anyway so no harm right?
---
Can i get the nsfw edit?
---
I mean, go for it. My main literally has maybe 3m if I repaired the torags and broke down the slayer helm lol
---
Rs3 player here, lmfao this is hilarious
---
i was getting 12 pre nerf, now its 2
---
Hahahahahaha but seriously only the lunar spell rest should restore run
---
Hello???
---
It's not just the bosses though, thieving and ice demon are inferior to crope.
---
I don't have graceful.
---
Yes but like the update is ok for normal accounts with really the only issues being with irons?
---
Communism
---
Ok yea but do you really think it’s healthy to cook food on a sulfur vent? Honestly I don’t go down there without a gas mask or face mask. I’ll be damned if my character gets some strange illness from that shithole.
---
It’s neither. It’s requiring education not money.
---
You can safely ignore the second sentence, was just trying to explain why one thing doesn't necessarily imply the other given the context, but I suppose it was a bad example.
---
That's why I always anonymously sell my food on the GE ;)
---
Everyone has already been aware for a long time, besides ya big dummy friend i guess
---
what you are describing makes no sense. if you put two people who can solo/no prep together and do duos your no prep duos are going to be a little faster (but less pts/time). its just you or your duo partner or your scouting choices. I've done a lot of solos/non scaled duos/2+2s, even a 2+2 should not be anywhere near 45mins.
---
That’s because of the rs3 immigrants 
---
His point is still valid though. Just ignore that mentioned difficulty.
---
I like seeing my drops on the ground, not a key. If it’s stackable it won’t be as bad. No way I will ever do Konar again if it’s not stackable lol. Well not stackable... if you can’t have more than 1 at a time.. that would be bogus. 
---
Aren't raids end game only? I loved how dungenerring didn't require anything other than skills to perform 
---
Nobody is using crafted gear at end-game, but leveling they sure as hell are. Look at the amount of people wearing d'hide. Mage does not have mid-high level low cost gear like range does. It basically goes from Mystic to infinity/ahrims (those are the only 50-70 range somewhat cheap sets I can think of). So there is absolutely a place this could fill.
---
Those are tags which filter out the banked items. Not exactly a preset
---
You still have to know how many of which to withdraw and where to put them in your inventory (if it matters)
---
What does that have to do with this post?
---
They dont because the iron scims bonuses are too small. Event rpg literally increases base dps by 33%. 
---

Soliceps are amazing, you get tons of fossils and great wc xp. I've been using the fossils to train rc too. Also it's fairly afk.
---
Warmane has about 20-30k people every day

I spent far too long faffing with books rather than just aiming for dark manuscripts the first time...duh

If this was a skilling problem it would be hot fixed, fix it ffs effecting the clanning community so much.

---
Yeah for as much good as other clients do, I'm content playing the game normally. For some reason. 
---
Wouldn't be a bad idea.
---
I mean, doing the math, werewolf agility course is objectively better xp/hr than any other course from 60-99. 
---
670-730 xp per lap, ~40 second laps = 90 laps / hr, total 60k min - 66k max xp/hr
---
Compare to 45.6k xp/hr maximum @ Seers
---
Ardy is closer at 62.3k max xp/hr but at level 93 you stop failing the deathslide at werewolf meaning you hit the max xp/hr 3 levels (aka a gap of nearly 2.5mil xp) sooner than at Ardy. Not to mention if you trap the agility boss at werewolf then you can shave a precious 3-5 seconds off your laps and up that xp/hr to 70k+.
---
Of course you won't be getting marks of grace at the werewolf course, but that 8-10k extra xp/hr shaves 20-25 hours off of the grind from 90-99, not to mention the 25-30 hours shaved from the ~15-20k/hr compared to Seers from 60-90.
---
So, in my book, 60-99 is all at one place because i would much rather have 50-60 hours less of a grind than a bunch of untradable marks of grace =X
---
Yes I know.
---
&gt; I was able to change the password. I have 2FA enabled too. Should the account be safe again now?
---
Make sure your email account also has 2FA if it doesn't already, and also make sure the password you chose (or chose in the future) isn't shared with **any** other account you may have had in the past.
---
Don't change that. Run energy works fine. You have to train some agility to get better run energy. It's not that difficult and it gives value to agility.
---
I've had it happen to me on vanilla client recently, but it never stopped me from immediately rejoining. Not getting the "locked out for minutes" issue.
---
Suggestion: Tree Climbing Skill.
---
We could build tree houses
---
No worries, I legit thought that the different raids rooms worked like dungeoneering used to with skill checks to get through them. I didn't realise it was straight up like elemental workshop where it's mediocre puzzles and killing things that appear scary but are pushovers.
---

shut the fuck up idiot

&gt;His entire post is predicated on the fact that PKers can't kill him and are therefore wasting both his and their time.
---
Solo PKers can't kill him ajd therefore it's a waste of time, yeah.
---
&gt;Bitching about dying in the wilderness is another stupid argument all in itself, and is was not at all the heart of the issue here
---
Who was bitching about dying in the wilderness??
---
&gt;From his posts in this very thread:
---
&gt;"I'm over it, just genuinely confused and concerned about how these peoples brains work."
---
&gt;"The whole point of pking is to make monetary gain right? It's impossible to kill me solo in my gear, it's not happened once."
---
Literally what the fuck is your thought process here. What do you think those quotes show?
---
Still slayer or even nmz lmao
---
Closest I've found is to play as ironman and don't use any guides
---
no, but if i live in a city and their way of doing things was "we will poll all new changes to the city" and then they said "we want to add a restaurant to your city but only people of gordon ramsay's experience can vote on whether we add it" i'd be pretty pissed, because i may not be a chef but i still want a say on what i was told i'd have a say in.
---
Man, I've really neglected the benefits of fossil island. All I've really done there is hardwoods, seaweed, and herbiboar. I'm going to look into this tonight, I need WC xp, and it doesn't hurt to finish the museum to get some RC xp in the basement.
---
Its like the 3rd best xp in the game for these types of accs. The thing is monks never die so you can afk for 20minutes at a time instead of like 1-5mins. You can also do it in f2p so its like no extra effort. 
---
I wouldn't argue against that. But having items like this that get alched is actually a good thing, as it helps sink the items put into making it and helps keeping a desire for it on the market.
---
That is the main purpose of this skill; sink items and fill that gap, which it could definitely do.
---
Well yes but having a small group of players voting is more of an oligarchy since they would be deciding for everyone. (1250 isn’t actually that high of a total level so oligarchy is a bit extreme) 
---
All im saying is the guy made a legitimate positive comment about the update and you just shut it down by saying ironmen exist and then tried to hide behind it by making it sound like a meme. If you're delusional to immedatley shut down any possible positives because "ironmen exist" then i can't help you.
---
Even if a sleeping bag took up an inventory slot? If it took an inven slot and you had to not be able to do anything I can't imagine it devaluing graceful/stamina pots. I could be mistaken on how resting works though.
---
This community in a nutshell.. prefers easyscape above QoL updates for a more realistic grind. Yet everything has to be OP gp/h or else it's dead content.. community's sloweling getting us towards rs3
---
Yeah but he sad he was retarded not that he has cancer. This post is fucking trash 
---
Nope.
---
Nightmare zone
---
D
---
You’re literally the person this meme is talking about
---
It's good and bad really. Saves you from hitting big and resetting and bad if you noodle and the one time you hit they go under.
---
Exactly. They literally had the balls to bring up the question: What about ancient prayers? Like for real, c'mon.
---
Bet that shit was wild 
---
They are now, but bosses used to be endgame only as well. I'd prefer mid-level raiding content over dungeoneering.
---
That went well...
---
Very doable. I use a dhc. You dont *need* a bp for everything
---
Weird that you mention not hiring awkward/cringy people when this post is such a cringy and unnerving thing to say.
---
Why not? 
---
smh sleeping bag update started the whole easyscape trend. games gone downhill ever since. 
---
Yep, and they'll make excuses for what they want, but hold what they don't to a high af standards. That's bias for you.
---
I didn’t know it was posted daily mate and couldn’t care about karma just thought it was funny sorry. 
---
Although I think removing scouting from CoX this long into its life cycle is not the smartest idea. Should it be removed, how do you account for room specific items being taken in? Such as ZGS if you have Muttadile? Do you propose less switches for the raid, and constantly carrying those items around just incase you get that room (I can understand this was the intended design, but it evolved into the meta for completing CoX)?
---
A potential fix could be, once the raid is generated you are told the bosses in there, and every subsequent generation of a raid (leave and reenter) would be the same rotation, so no scouting. Once, for example, the first floor is complete (maybe even second floor?) should the raid be left a new one would be generated with a different rotation. This would still allow preparing for a raid appropriately whilst combating scouting should you go ahead an remove it. 
---
Literally look nout alike 
---
Just take out small scavs and give us the 25% tekton def reduction and forget we asked for chambers Qol.
---
I have two big gripes with toolbelt. First, the ability to store endgame pickaxes and hatchets safely and forever. This is the sort of "easy scape" content which is totally unnecessary. It could obviously be countered by only adding bronze pickaxes and hatchets, which I feel would keep the convenience without the added safety
---
Second, I don't think its immersive to have a batman utility belt with 50+ items including every mold in the game. There's something very old-school-rpg-esque about finding the appropriate items to make a task and using them together. I'd like keeping that feeling intact, if possible. Given you can already pull them from your house and thus waste no bank space, why not.
---
yeah like 300k/hr? If it's possible to make more cash on an account with no stats and no startup cash, it's not "profitable".
---
The simplified version You can’t use pure essence so you have to mine a special essence that’s right by the altar. Takes like 5 mins to fill up your inventory and then it’s only like 2 clicks away to the altar. There’s some on there stuff you have to do but that pretty much takes a second anyways 
---
STORY TIME:
---
So I got introduced to RS like most of you by a friend and got immediately addicted to the game. I had so much fun that even my mother became curious. I tried to show her the game and she gave it a try. Since then she’s actively playing the game, but only RS3 since she can’t understand English and she’s too lazy to try something new haha. I quit the game when EoC got released, but I had a blast playing the game. My mom always wanted me to help her with quests and bosses since she wasn’t that good in the game. I remember the relief after beating Nomad on her account. I never really could kill the high bosses or quest bosses, because my stats were too shit and I was too lazy to grind the lvls, but my mom was and is still a huge fan of skilling and therefore was able to start all the quests. Sometimes it was annoying to do that, especially after I quit the game. “What do you mean you don’t want to do a 2h long quest for me???” Nowadays I can’t keep up with the RS3 shit but she got pretty good at it (because it became pretty easy I guess haha). 
---
You’re dumb as fuck I literally just explained that clearly it is bad for both mains and irons. Try getting 100 cb first before u speak on big boy pvm
---
Thank you. My email has 2FA and a unique, long password. I'll submit the ticket you mentioned. I haven't panicked this hard for a long time, but I feel mostly better, although I still don't really trust Jagex to keep my account safe based on all the posts I've been seeing lately =/
---
Thanks again.
---
Any publicity is good publicity
---
Hey, some people like em. I only use them for certain things but still. 
---
If you lived through summoning on RS3 you'd know this is a bad idea
---
Fair points. I don't know why I chose your comment in particular to reply to tbh.
---
only thing I would say is that player's experience (in this instance the right to vote in polls) should not be limited to prevent bots. That happened with trade limits and was the worse thing to happen to the game. lets face it, Jagex bot detection is whack. They could certainly do a lot more to prevent bots before limiting player experience.
---
Everything that favors easyscape passes nowadays..
---
I'd say it's because the higher lvls are doing raids now so that frees up space at gwd.
---
He was waiting for strategic OP promos. It would have been faster if he actually trained
---
Um, removing scouting would be ridiculous.  I don't want to have to do shitty raids that not only slow down my raids per hour but also aren't fun or interesting. Scrolls seem neat but don't add a new item to force people to not be able to get raids they want.
---
Miles better than Zuhaar’s but will be lucky to receive 10% of the upvotes. 
---
RIP fella, you gonna carry on playing the acc or make a new HC and I'll see you back in the cc when you hit 2k on it? :P
---
Didnt watch qna, but 99 agility and 1 agility’s run drain at the same rate. You run the same amount of distance before you both hit 0 run. This is because agility’s restore rate only works when you are not running. It would be cool if the replenish rate occured while running so 99 agility could run 30 more sqs than 1 agility lol. 
---
I'd rather grind 99 agility again than do 99 FM at wintertodt again.
---
When will these changes be implemented into the game? It looks like everything besides the warding scrolls are unpolled. 
---
Yeah! and there's Medora and a big ass bison statue in Jamestown. 
---
Watching the community react to these polls is absolutely horrifying.
---
Lol no one bitches and moans as much as the au playerss so entitled. 
---
I agree, but we are talking about people who thought 2.5K Sara brews were a good idea. 
---
I have no problem with stronger gear as long as it's locked behind a couple things such as a higher skill requirement and must use a previous high lvl/expensive item for fuse 
---
I think the drakes drops are bad, but the mechanic wasn't a problem. Plus it was always fun seeing someone die because they weren't paying attention lol. 
---
Yea this
---
Yes you do. You just have to run back to it and get it but that was only supposed to be a temporary mechanic. My point still applies to pvp 
---
I could see it working after a fashion I suppose. It's going to be a hard sell for the masses though. I don't see it passing the poll. 
---
Woulc be cool. But didn't we get weird stuff with the same shape from castle wars
---
As long as it’s in the ouch you’re fine anyways lol
---
Or even a right click *make fire* option so you can keep it on.
---
Yeah but if it's not an inconvenience, why would it be needed?

Yup it’s a huge factor in all of our decisions. You might you are straying from the pact but that’s actually influencing your decision whether you say yes or no 
---
Oh I didn’t even realize that, that’s nice, but I prefer the risk of old school. 
---
Guess I really don’t know shit about rs3 haha
---
They keep things level 75 so people don't make as many comparisons to overpowered chaotics of pre-EOC/don't think there is any power creep. 
---
I realized that bitter commented on that tread and said something along the lines of he implemented it, but that was 2 years ago so it might went trough some iterations.
---
The main reason the other dude made it was because of bitter, since he asked for it on the forums.

This so much! I bought enough gp to buy everything I want. Although it does make the game boring after a while.

That's why it's QOL

Hey, I got an email from a prince in Africa, is he also legit?

Agreed, I'd much rather spend a few minutes scouting a few raid the having to start raids over and over to see the rot

Lol ok pal

Thieving in my case

The fact of the matter is the combat system in OSRS is absolute arse, most of the time increases in difficulty are entirely arbitrary or unengaging, because most combat revolves around actively avoiding having to do stuff. People might hate EOC but there's a reason it was introduced, and I think it was to combat situations like this.

Good luck getting Pure Essence without mining it in the early game. Feels super shitty because all that time would be devalued by a single Zulrah drop.

Or at least equiping and unequiping items from bank interface.

Fupping annoying when I'm on mobile trying to pickpocket a master farmer and some dude refuses to dismiss his jailer that's standing on the same tile
---
i agree a player should have a certain total level (they may need to already, I'm not too sure) to vote to not encourage multiple votes but I just can't see how it's fair that a player can have a say so over content I havent managed to access yet just because they got there first.
---
I understand it's because they may be more "experienced" with the things being polled but it also means they're catering for themselves and content I may be looking forward to may be different by the time I get there without my opinion having any importance on it. I think it also comes to the cliche but still relevant "game integrity". I may not have the levels for something but I still may be knowledgeable enough about the game to know whether the things being suggested fit with what the game is.
---
But it still affects them, the 18 year olds. A poll about a 95 Slayer req boss will not affect a level 25 noob.
---
Ah you meant werewolf, fair enough
---
Fresh out of a WDR learner raids?

so you'd be okay with it if it costed pray points? is that not easyscape enough?

Gotcha.
---
Sadly I imagine it is because a lot of people who train construction are only in it for the grind to the high level unlocks. It's just another side effect of Efficiency-scape.

Basically they don't think it's worth it to furnish a house unless they have a high level. I agree it is a waste though.

Is it possible to somehow make a new account on my email address without recovering the one I had on it? If not, how long do recoveries usually take?
---
Details:
---
I wanted to try this game again after being hit by nostalgia, but it seems my account has been hacked. I don't really care about the account, since I only spent a few hours on it before growing bored back then, and I no longer have access to the one I used back when I was a kid due to my old email address being deactivated.
---
However because of its existence, I can not use my email address to make a new account, and I do not want to make a new email just for runescape. I tried recovering, but I've yet to get a reply and I wasn't exactly able to remember much information from back when I created the account. And for some reason the email the recovery link was going to be sent to was total bogus(2\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*@\*\*.com), making it so that I had to go to the "I don't have access to that email address" route.
---
Olm gives all of the points, so please balance the time to reach Olm. Some rooms simply take too much time compared to others.

---
New players are players just like us veterans. Obviously there should be a minimum so people cant just vote on brand new alts, but its not fair to not allow paying members who support the game to vote
---
yeah runelite can make the game easy yes, but you can also use it to smooth the edges on the game, add features that should already be there, loot tracker, a way to look up stats etc, rs3 is easy because stats are mostly buyable and money is easy to make, as well as being much more afk and holding your hand through invent'ing with toolbelt etc

Fuck would that take the excitement out of konar. The only thing that makes konar hellhounds interesting is being able to go "oh shit I just got magic seeds!" In the middle of a task. I don't want just a basic "oh you'll get a drop in place of this" key. What's the benefit of that?
---
Are you sure? Look at the recent trend of the polls, everything is voted yes. There are ALOT of new players that blindly vote yes to updates.
---
Enjoy being 14
---
It's not just 1 inventory space, it defeats the purpose of all the basic tools. You only ever buy them once and then they sit in your tool pouch forever. Why not just remove the tools altogether because its essentially the same outcome either way. 
---
Not argueing for removing all tool to clarify, I'm saying we shouldn't introduce the tool belt because it's pretty much the same thing. 
---
Is there a good and simple beginners guide somewhere?
---
I wouldnt use runelite if the original client had the basic stuff, but its so trash so i have to. I disable a lot of the plugins but if jagex had client with all the basic stuff (like overlays) id use it. I dont actually need clue helper but it makes clues a bit faster so why not. And seeing imps on minimap is so nice too. 
---
Upvoted because of the “Ode to Ash” in the background 
---
You guys think about it way too much, trying to explain you’ll drop nothing is like if someone were to tell you “hey, you might be wasting your time killing NPCs, they might not drop a clue scroll!”
---
Probably watched Seerz's guide
---
You will always have access to all the seasonal items you've unlocked via Diango in Draynor.

Actually caring what a woman tells you is simp behavior

People who started playing in 200o shouldn't be allowed to vote lol
---
Back in the day it was the Chinese
---
Wouldn't say null. Turoths decent drops, cave horror (mask is like 1.8m atm), dust devils. Not amazing but not bad either. 
---
Also the people who started playing when mobile came out are probably around that level.
---
Friends who all started in november, trained to 70s/80s stats over christmas and are exploring endgame content together now.
---
Fucking hell, gimmie. 
---
Sounds like you already made up your mind. Go grind some gp
---
Your point makes me sad bob. Raids are one of the fun, fast paced parts of Oldschool content right now. Why the fuck would you want to make it more tedious, you want the whole game to be more tedious just because the other 98% of it is?
---
[Yep, it’s a Tide ad](https://gfycat.com/brokenethicalhornet)

You make some compelling points against rest. I'm not 100% against it, thanks for the help friend!
---
Have you ever cut down a tree and made it into a bow in a real situation?
---
Haha, I'm not exactly broke but I'll take the savings any day if it's the same amount of effort (heck less effort since I didn't have to deal with mm).  Also don't have dhcb but by choice, I have 18 vorkath kc mainly from getting assembler.  I get bored of doing vorkath, rather do fishing or raids lol.
---
Tek nerf is overkill. Missed specs should just have more of an effect applied to it.
---
yeah pures can complete whole elite wildy diary
---
Telling me where to click for Agility is also pretty handy.
---
&gt; Rest Option: Working toward graceful/stam pots is a necessary part of the game
---
Getting around is horrible as a poor new player without resting. I had afk a full 5 minutes just to get more run energy.
---
It's a good money making method, but it's not a reliable one. It's probably the most interesting area on the market in OSRS because it doesn't have a lot of supply and demand, but when it does have demand the prices will be unusually high. 
---
Most people don't care for furnishing their house at lower Construction levels. They are just doing construction to unlock the high level content, and by then they can make most of the furniture themselves anyway. 
---
Not all updates need to be BiS, but leaving old useless things in game is also bad. Variety is fun, and helps the lifespan of games.
---
Both the mining guild and wilderness reworks helped those areas? Idk how you came to the conclusion that these areas are even more dead than before.

Man FUCK OFF. Enjoy the game and quit your little bitch-ass whining. Nobody cares if you think the game is too easy. It isn’t. It’s not too easy or too hard. It’s a fucking game. It’s fun, and if you enjoy playing it then play it and if you don’t like playing it then just fucking don’t. Don’t get on here and complain it’s too easy.  Get the FUCK outta here

TehNoobShow used to be massive back in the day. 
---
For pking I would say shakrbrew and discord and most pvm clans use discord.
---
They just had their users solve x captchas to be able to bot x hours. They crowd-sourced the solution upfront from their users. A lot of people don't realize this - but we're not fighting bots. We're fighting *people* - those people just happen to use bots as a tool.
---
Also, in the current tech climate, it's *significantly* easier to source puzzle solutions online. Micro-task companies have become fairly popular and you can get pretty obscene quantities of tasks solved by *humans* for next to nothing. A few thousand solutions barely costs a dollar for google-level captchas.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Whatever Jagex would come up with would become a more niche market, requiring a higher pay rate initially. This would drive workers to this particular solving service as they'd be getting a better rate. Eventually the workers become more familiar with the process, thus increasing the saturation of workers who can solve this particular puzzle. This allows the owners of the bot platforms/scripts/whatever stage of the bot process is handling the captchas (this can all be 100% transparent to the bot user - they don't even need to know about it), to reduce the payout rate. This inevitably brings the cost down fairly low. If they're smart, they'll use their workers positive results to train an AI using something like TensorFlow, which will then let them eventually automate the entire process of solving and bring the cost back down to 0.
---
From a PR perspective, ok maybe
---
Because blast furnace gold costs quite a bit of money. That's usually how things in this game go, slow training is cheap or profitable, fast is expensive. The fastest RC option costs money too. RC makes you tons of money doing it pretty much any other way. Don't want to train it - don't. 
---
P.S. And I'm not against RC having some more cool and varied ways to train. But making it fast just because? Nah. 
---
Yeah lol I think it was on a flip phone
---
Are you being intentionally obtuse or do you not understand that restoring literally any other stat requires a resource?
---
I agree, I just edited the (new) Wiki, giving our boi some credit! I've never contributed to the Wiki before, so not sure if the change has to be approved or something, but hopefully it goes through.
---
Yes because every one knows how to spell a mythical creature. 
---
Honestly, we shouldn’t blame the players for answering questions that Jaggleflex asked them to answer.  They should actually change the “skip question” option to “I don’t know” so people are more inclined not to answer questions they don’t know enough information about.
---
Most people are just obtuse. There might as well be not run energy at all to these guys. They don't like the game mechanic.
---
If you're not an ironman, you have rest, it's called stamina potions. There is no such thing in RS3, although these days it's basically impossible to run out of run energy in RS3. No toolbelt or coin pouch ever though. 
---
I got 10 once, then I went dry for the next half hour.
---
That's rough
---
Can he buy a house in canifis or will he have to make an exception?
---
Rest is good, the other options are a no from me dog 
---
Leave rest out of this you monsters
---
Fuck somebody needs to make this a thing.
---
smh my head
---
That thing was just way too accurate. I guess on pures accuracy doesn't mean much.
---
You could have just bought it on GE. Next time show your collection log ;)
---
This is what happens now that it’s been 6 years since osrs release the kids that were 8 in 2007 are of an age that they can play the game decently and vote in polls now. Things will change the more time that goes by, the younger the players who’s golden days were later and later, a couple more years people will be talking about pogo sticks.

Designing content to work off an unintended game mechanic?

It can be done without pray flicking but this prayer can be used without also

I would recommend superiors -&gt; blocks/skips -&gt; slayer helm to start with. Superiors are a great boost to xp and you don't really need a slayer helm that much when you can just use a black mask 
---
I think only last wave inferno been done on mobile, not entire inferno
---
Lunar Isle is a tad dangerous if you wander north or south. Also, if you haven't done Dream Mentor, talking to near any NPC, including the bank people, will get you sent to the Freminniks. 
---
You're fine if you happen to have the Seal of Passage, or if you've done Dream Mentor, because that quest gives you a banker that won't send you away.
---
The tutorial literally teaches you about account security. There's literally a stronghold of security.
---
They've implemented in the game how to secure your account, it's the users faukt for skipping over everything. 
---
Hot damn, I'll write that down and strive toward it. Thanks.
---
Over 4K ya
---
If you want a medium-long term goal, see of you can complete Throne of Miscellania and Royal Trouble. In unlocking and finishing them you'll complete a bunch of important quests, unlock a few travel methods, and have some decent but not excessive skill goals to reach. At the end, your reward is daily passive income, which is always awesome. 
---
&gt;Kinda funny. Dungeoneering wasn't bad content, a lot of it was good, with some major issues of course. Yes the fact that it was a skill was weird, but it wouldn't be able to function as a minigame. Making it a skill was necessary, and because of the extreme ammount of content, it had to be a 120 skill as well.
---
 
---
There was literally no reason for instanced dungeons based on every other skill, to need to be a skill at all, whatsoever, 99 or 120. It was a minigame. It provided nothing a minigame couldnt. It should never have been a skill. It's nonsensical.
---
Jamflex added a mid level expansion and the maxed nerds reeeeeeee'd so hard they cancelled expansions so who knows
---
Well they did say their current plan is not to poll it. They're just getting feedback on how to tweak it.
---
IMO the scrolls are not a good solution. The rooms just need to be better balanced to eliminate any benefit of such scrolls.
---
Can you kill hydras off task?
---
I think there’s a boss log you can make in your POH that lets you view your personal bests that’s probably your best bet
---
I think 2009-10 was prime. I really miss the HD graphics back when the design was the same as OSRS (just HD). I also really miss Soul Wars. That was my favorite minigame.
---
Inferno isnt designed to be done with flicking. Your prayer idea is useless without prayer flicking. Stam pots are cheaper than prayer pots
---
Yeah it's the woodcutting skilling pet. The drop rates are really low, like doing the calculation with willow trees at my level the chance was something like 1/287,861
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Beaver
---
Except it’s not med tier... it’s gonna be a fairly common drop considering it’s stackable and you gain drop rate if you do a room that you don’t have one on...
---
Yeah, those first few seconds are powerful 
---
Two trade over the course of 15 minutes. He traded alot of other people whom all said thanks. He told me that he had given out 32 mil in total :)
---
Don't forget Fist of Guthix and Stealing Creation. That shit was awesome.
---
Think he said as long as he doesn't go out of the house he consider it leave. 
---
it's 500% true
---
Stronghold of Security, in Barbarian Village between Varrock and Falador. 
---
fair enough but the last wave is harder than all of fight caves imo
---
They've changed the mining mechanics and smithing mechanics completely...
---
TLDR is that they added 4 new tiers of armour for level 60, 70, 80, 90 defence requiring 60, 70, 80, 90 smithing and they also added masterwork armour, which is requires 99 smithing and 90 defence to wear, trimming it requires torva and malevolent (t90 melee gear) and that gives it extra stats and makes it require 92 defence
---
TLDR 2: armours from iron-rune require 10 more defence, making rune 50 def, addy 40 def, iron 10 def, etc...
---
TLDR 3: new metal, bang bang, new armour, better tiering system
---
I hadn't considered that second point which itself convinces me away from what I was originally thinking.   
---
But a counter point to the first bit could be that the Guardians are already unpopular so there wouldn't be a good enough supply for everyone to be consistently using them. Considering how slowly they are killed and for how many people would have to kill the boss to supply everyone to warrant a global XP rate buff, either enough people are busy fighting the boss that their lack of efficiency still balances out with others gains, or people still dont do them and the supply of cannonballs doesn't keep up, thus not enough people get a buff in XP. 
---
Thanks, I’ll chech it out :)
---
Take this with a grain of salt because I don't really pk at all. The balance was off because you risked practically nothing while below 20 (30?) wilderness.
---

I'm pretty sure you can profit off of Zulrah with those stats. My range and mage are almost identical to yours and I can manage 2 kill trips maybe 3 if I'm lucky. Maybe just practice it a little bit more and I'm sure you'll be bringing in the big bucks
---
Dude I got another account with full nmz complete, I know how this works. You got nothing better to do than shit on some random post on Reddit?

yep i've done loads and loads of abyss runs, you should try out ZMI. It requires completion of lunar diplomacy and 71 mage (i think) for best efficiency

1600 total and don't even have 20m xp lol

Honestly I just liked making my character rest when I was in BH or something watching a friend fight. I feel like people were less likely to hit me because they could see I was just chillin'
---
Inferno has been done on a lvl 59 account, jad at lower than 30. Zulrah is a very difficult boss for new players and can be the challange you are looking for
---
A boat's a boat, but the mystery box could be anything!
---
not a bad suggestion, or maybe it could have a similar effect as the graceful(where it slows the draining of run energy but keeping the restore run charges For daily usage), but very minimal boost
---
Thank how expeditious bracelets exist
---
I unironically think that having to remember tools like a hammer is important for osrs. I played rs3 for a while and Skilling is so thoughtless a lot of the time. I got really bored of it. You just click on this one object and it will automatically do everything for you. I feel like having to reorient yourself at the bank, and have that brief, 10  second pause where you think, "what am I doing again? And what are all the tools I need to accomplish for this task?" I think it's an important psychological part of the feeling of accomplishment from doing something in runescape. 
---
Remove the combat level requirement for full points.  Its necessary, makes no sense, and arbitrarily inhibits certain accounts not because they can't get through a raid but because nobody wants to raid with them since they will automatically limit the points.  Removing the ability to scout is stupid.  I totally support making other rooms more balanced and desirable to actually do but making us go into rooms fully blind and or replacing it with buyable scrolls is not going to be good.    
---
Currently the randomized part of chambers with scouting capabilities is balanced, you can spend extra time scouting to get the perfect raid or you can just do one with rooms you don't like as much.  If the rooms are more balanced than hopefully you can spend less time scouting and more time actually raiding.  Also due to the number of rooms and the fact that each of them requires different items raises the learning curve and difficulty of entry to raiding if scouting is disabled due to forcing everyone to use more inventory space for all the required items for every room.  Chambers is currently at a good niche of being content that is doable by higher level players who are not as experienced with pvm but also scales very well in difficulty for elite PVMers with maxed gear trying to kill it with max efficiency.  Its nice content that is rewarding for many levels of players and forcing newer players to use up even more spaces for room specific items would punish  them more harshly.  
---
3rd party clients such as runelite, osbuddy, konduit are a serious part of the game now that won't be going away.  Everyone uses them, but I do understand the philosophy of not requiring someone to use a 3rd party client to efficiently do chambers of xeric.  
---
Simply provide a jagex raid scouter and let everyone be able to scout easily without needing a 3rd party client, now everyone is happy.
---
sorry handjobs don't count
---
Is a membership necessary for full enjoyment? Just started getting into runescape again.
---
It's far harder without it.
---
Ironman btw so prayer pots are much easier to get than stam pots
---
Also if you have no pots on you then you can still use it
---
Yes that, thanks for correcting me. I don't actually play RS3 I just glance over what happens in their neck of the woods from time to time. 
---
Can you view killtime, or just kill count, tho? I’ve found the kc of different bosses, but I can’t find the time spent/personal best
---
hey 🅱️eerus
---
I'm really sorry you feel the need to be rude over something like this, I was just trying to answer a questions that was posed by someone.
---
By digging very lightly into any sources that aren't aligned with either of those men, aka objective sources, it quickly becomes apparent, at least for me, that most of what they are talking about doesn't correctly connect with the reality of the world around us.
---
Just because they each make some good points about an overabundance of "PC culture", and make fun of the current far left, does not mean that the rest, the majority, of what they say to be any more true.
---
The far left and the far right are both loonies imo. They are both easily offended, easily "triggered", mostly young, impressionable adults without much outside direction in life. The difference is that the far left becomes more hilarious and annoying the further left they go, while the far right gets lethal.
---
I'm not calling either of them far right, but they are media gateways towards that path.
---
Avoiding multiple bank runs to do literally anything, nice.
---
If I had a DHCB I would be completed as a human being.
---
But real talk I'm just trash at boss fights. I'm the 106cmb without a firecape that tries to avoid being noticed. But at least I have Barrows gloves so I'm not bottom tier trash :L
---
Make the toolbelt an item in your inventory, then. Simple qol update that doesn't "ruin the game because now 1 free inventory space is freed while crafting or smelting." 
---
Lmao bro when are you going to stop crying about that? We've basically doubled our player base and only 30% more players are voting. The old community still has way more than enough power to vote no and get it under 75%.
---
Quit fucking complaining. Just because something passes that you didn't like doesn't mean the "new rs3 players are ruining our game waaaa" it just means you were in the minority in that poll.
---
You're such a fucking cry baby. Get the fuck over it.
---
It is?

The comments in this post are ridiculous. So many people are complaining about certain rooms being "aids to do," while admitting that what they just don't want to do them because it would increase their time per raid by ~5 minutes. I frankly don't see the issue if your raid takes 5 extra minutes more to do. It's not like raids are anywhere close to being dead content, and being a bit less gp/hr won't make people stop doing them. They'd still be around ~3m gp/hr even if every single raid took 5 minutes longer (which wouldn't be the case anyway, only *some* raids will take longer if they removed scouting). 
---
Scouting is a dumb mechanic that should simply not be in the game. It feels completely out of place in the game and it's hardly engaging gameplay having to spam restart raids until you get a good layout.
---
Ops thought I was in rs3 sub. My bad. I've been running on no sleep when I seen this
---
I wake up, smoke a cigarette, take a leak, eating something, and then play Runescape until I have to get up to use the bathroom or something. I'm pretty sure I have dreams of Runescape like every night. Pretty sure I've accumulated around 1,000 days played. 
---
Its an old school rpg which makes it fun. If you want a modern rpg, go play a different game
---
It would have to be really strong, like 1 energy per sec while active. Stam pots would be really cheap afterward lol
---
Thanks alot, really helped me out :)
---
Yeah it is. It feels good actually remembering and using these tools, there's no thought about it in rs3 
---
PLEASE 
---
oh.. nmz... thought we were talking about raids
---
I agree, it's okay to have some simple shit instead of forcing everything to try and be flashy with bells and whistles and good xp.
---
But mining guild and wildy updates have been good and if people have a good idea for a guild update then why not.
---
Frankly I think they are just putting off the idea of a rune crafting guild because they know of the sheer asspain of those autistic skillers.
---

In rs2 you lost untradeables on death anywhere if they weren’t protected. I got 107 dungeoneering mostly from pking
---
That's the point of polls though. A skiller is affected by a 90 slayer req monster. The whole player base has to vote or nobody does.  It's all well and good hoping integrity kicks in and people abstain from what doesn't affect them but they won't.  
---
Also lwt us not pretend that people who can do the content will always vote for the best interests of the game. They won't.
---
hahah alright that's awesome! had no idea they were used. you find some on the floor at the G.E sometimes and I felt like no one was buying/selling them
---
The allure of the potential items was pretty strong. I still like the idea of the Bone Whip, both mechanically and visually, but it is probably best saved for future content.
---
As for the price, I think it is reasonable to expect it to be under 5M given where the other items are. During the Bone Whip hype, the highest the tail ever hit was around 3M and the Ferocious Gloves, which are a BiS item of similar stat gain, are down to 7.6M and they are rarer. So given those kinds of factors, I think it is reasonable to expect it to be significantly cheaper than the Bludgeon and it would be a bit reckless to vote in a cheaper alternative hoping it would gain a higher value.

I've not even been in there yet.... The dungeon, that is. Just heard there was a 10k reward and some boots, so I didn't really bother.

Slayer doesn't really count as PvM. Technically it is, but it's not what people are referring to when they say PvM.

Omg I feel so attacked right now. Mid 20s RuneScape gal who loves rum. D:
---
I'm on mobile too atm, but he often mentions Jews, how races determine mannerisms constantly, cries about 'leftists' and literally repeats a bunch of your shallow minded nonsense. He's - incredibly - racist, to the point where it would be worrying if this kid want occupied playing runescape all fucking day. 
---
If solely in the game, then i'd agree with you.  However both Agility and Thieving allow for easier watching of TV shows than Runecrafting does.
---
Why is this getting downvoted? If you disagree, make a point instead of mindlessly downvoting. 
---
If they aren't forcing them on, they aren't really securing your account though? They removed one service as worked, to half-ass another? If it works well, just make it a core part of the game - who cares if it annoys people. I'm way more annoyed that I've wasted money on a game without security - even if the blame lies mostly on myself.
---
I know I'm being pedantic about it because I'm annoyed, but really?
---
Yeah, that's a good way to teach new players about security, some random dungeon in the middle of nowhere. Considering HOW badly ripe hackers are in this game, they need to be doing more to inform and help user to secure the account rather than "Oh read FAQ and go to this random ass dungeon"
---
But still. The price should be going down because there's no rangers sink, and pegs dont count. 
---
Just farm giant seaweed and fill buckets of sand, ez craft xp

Is the 750+ Skill level world glitched? I can't log into it even though I'm at 752. Perhaps it takes  some time to register my total level?
---
In his spellbook?
---
I honestly don't get why you would watch any guide besides woox' guide
---
You are correct that you are limiting yourself in game.
---
But you are also forfeiting control of your specialized and what updates it gets to a demographic that doesn’t represent you or what you want.
---
That is like saying only land owners in America can vote or people with over 100k in their savings can.
---
See the problem?
---
I have no idea why you are taking this limit argument so anally. In game sure, you of course limited yourself. But deciding what goes into the game you are a person have a right and say to because you pay for the game.
---
By your token; why not only let max accounts vote? 
---
They have the most wide opinion so wouldn’t the game be the best under only their votes?
---
Why stop at 1250? Or 50mil xp? 
---
Could make the elder maul good at a boss by making the boss have very few ticks to attack on, with lots of buffer between vulnerability so that a fast weapon wouldn't be effective, also make the boss weak to crush. This is basically the only way i see of it being useful in the future.
---
Runes
---
No shit
---
Quite the opposite
---
I don't like the idea of scrolls, especially being tradable.
---
Specifically in terms of coming up with a solution to remove 3rd party scouting, how does this sound:
---
Raids in general should be a bit more desirable so that people don't feel like they need to scout 30 raids to get something half decent. With the Room balancing listed in the blog, this is definitely helpful toward that. **Perhaps when you make a party for a raid, as the leader you can get presented with 3-5 raids on the board, where you MUST pick one of them to do?** I'm not sure if something like this is possible, but would likely involve needing to actually complete the raid to get a new set of 3-5 raids to pick from. In the short term if people don't like their 3-5 raid choice they could use an alt, or another party member, but overall you would eventually have to pick and complete one to get a new choice set.
---
Usually if you give them something low like 50k for 100k, they'll do it to try and get your trust up. I do this then run, meaning I win.
---
I get people who drop jugs at WT but if you drop them at ardy knights your just dumb. It takes less time to bank them when you run out of food. 
---
Rest is not something that should be in oldschool runescape. We have graceful and staminas. If you wear the graceful when not moving you are pretty much resting. Adding actual rest is just too many options. Its not just "oldschool purist crybabies" that are against it. I actually like most updates and additions to the game.... and I agree that rest should not be added or even considered further.
---
And you have to do an entire raid with that boss in it to get the drop... 
---
I am actually not 99 firemaking XD, I am an ironman though. 
---
Brine rats drop raw food also. 
---
Not to mention there are probably loads of things near fishing spots or other food methods that you can't utilise easily.
---
Can you tell me why you don't want an HD option instead of telling me to go play RS3?
---
This is a super cringe thread. Likely and immature ass adult fuckin with a immature ass child. Id say you both should grow the fuck up and get a grip on typing to other people through a screen.

ohh boy I miss fist of Guthix and those gauntlets, I forgot they even went up to dragon, was there barrows gauntlets as well?
---
Seriously why is this the first post I’m seeing near the front page of this subreddit about this topic. This needs to be fixed.
---
I’m trying to figure out the next best upgrade for my melee gear for training strength. I’m currently using an Abyssal Dagger + Dragon Defender with Obsidian chest and platelegs. I’m saving money up and I can’t decide if it is better to replace my weapon with an Abyssal Bludgeon or replace my gear with Bandos gear. Which would give me a better boost for general strength training in combat (mainly during slayer)? Any advice would be appreciated!
---
It'll pass once suggested because it's only natural that once an easier option is up for vote it'll be a yes. 
---
for the laffs

i was wrong.. this guy is the virgin.

Hey, feel free to join theoslounge, we're a new and actively recruiting clan that's social and pvm based so we're always looking for new members

I think not wooosh, just informing those who are downvoting or might not know what’s going on
---
To which, Thank you :)

Lemme just mod my magic shortbow (i) with a 4x ACOG scope
---
Sounds like you don't have a clue tbh. 
---
Please refrain from making idiotic suggestions like this in future. 
---
It's BIS main melee DPS slot for a lot of pk builds though. Sure at maxed combats there's better alternatives. However, because pking is usually within a certain level bracket, I would prefer saying that Dscim is the best at mid level, rather than saying it's mid level at best. 
---

I completely agree, the demand will balance out when people start using them and holding them. Great item, both in cosmetics and use. The only obstacle standing between the lance and price balancing, is the uncertainty of buyers. Everyone is panic selling or buying, but this is only hindering the value more and more. If people that like the look or benefits from owning the lance kept it, the price/demand would stay around 100m. Once this happens the supply will balance out and more people will be confident in the lance to an extent that will allow owners to feel comfortable with the investment knowing they wont take a hit to their bank value.
---
Question about farming Hespori. 
---
So my combat level is currently only 56. 40 atk and str. 53 def, range, mage. 33 prayer.
---
Is trying to fight hespori even an option at these levels or should i work on my levels first lol?
---
I don't understand why Jagex don't hide the poll results. Imagine if you went to vote for a new president, or prime minister or referendum and you see what's in the lead, you'll most likely vote for the option that's winning so far rather than personal preference, just because that option is winning by a large margin.
---
Has any Jagex employee even been to a poll booth IRL?
---
Ah yes you're right. I read "scouting" in your comment but understood balance changes.
---
Keep projecting :)
---
Oh look, another man-child spouting nonsense that can't be backed up by any data.
---
Look, I know it's easy to blame the fact you aren't living the life you want to lead on minorities, women and 'lefties', but one day you will realise that everything you hate has been spoonfed to you by corporately funded republican think tanks, as opposed to actually observing the world around you and forming your own opinions.
---
You’re talking about fight kiln and QBD lmao those weren’t high level bosses they were easy. High enrage Telos is far harder than an inferno.
---
Most of the times yes
---
And I’m over here getting 1k clue rewards
---
yeah leave that crap off old school, don't need everything to be so convenient. Part of osrs for me is  a bunch of that stuff isn't on here and i enjoy that about it.
---
I agree, not only will they do something else non-sense wise, but why is this a bad idea? Use your words and explain your side?
---
Brews are actually useful at hydra. Unless you fuck up badly, you can always heal between kills and brews instead of food can save you some space for more restores, effectively extending your trips.
---
I mean we know we are all idiots. That’s a given but what’s a better way to get people involved and invested into the game by letting their voice help improve it. 
---
Thanks for your support! &lt;3
---
Watched this live, absolute fucking champions.
---
What your describing is called power creep and it is discussed regularly on this subreddit. 
---
Rs3 died with eoc, and eoc was a result of powercreep. What jagex did wrong was not necessaril releasing the korasi, but rather about when they released it. Korasi out classed pretty much everything, it was disgustingly powerful, it was a huge leap for power "creep". 
---
The fact is, OSRS has handled it better, we have already out lived 2007-eoc, and we can still keep going for a long time before power creep becomes an issue, because we aren't making the same mistakes as before (like releasing korasi, overloads, ancient prayers, etc).
---
I'm not sure there really is a "solution" to powercreep which is why I'm convinced we're currently living in the golden age of RuneScape, as I think osrs's current state is better than any previous state of rs, but our current power balance is already starting to get a little shaky, so I guess we'll see.
---
The worst item to enter the game was the blowpipe, by far. The way I see it, every increase in BIS brings us closer and closer to the end of the games lifespan, so you want to make it as incremental as possible, and blowpipe was far from incremental. I think it reduced the game's life span quite significantly.
---
I would definitely get it eventually though. Even small stat boosts are good at higher levels once you start getting end game gear. I had been sitting at +195 ranged bonus forever and now I'm at 199, so I'm happy to get any new upgrade.
---
LOL
---
[Some context for you ](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ailia6/i_just_met_adam_sick_nerd)
---
Cant tell if serious....
---
Either way no there is no such thing as an official luck on any account. Every kill rolls loot individually, regardless of kc, how dry you are, etc. The only thing that would increase your chances at good loot would be to get more of the drops which are dependent on who does the most damage. 
---
Which were up in price since 8 months ago, so what's the problem?
---
It isn’t that great of a weapon in its current state. 
---
Range is better. 
---
Only good for CoX and rune drags. 
---
People buy it for a task and dump or buy to try it out, realize it isn’t that great for the price and then dump. 
---
You either need lots of excess cash or be committed to doing CoX/Rune drags to warrant holding one long term imo. 
---
Obviously getting merched since the price hasn’t stabilized.
---
Zmi with runners is tons of xp per hour, its just really expensive, as it should be. Runecrafting is not going to gate you from enjoying the game, and you're not entitled to have a high rc level just because you think it's ridiculously slow. Cooking doesnt need to be unfucked, nor is it possible to due to tons of people already having achieved a relatively easy 99.
---
And I wouldn't call rc a joke. Actually one of the more diverse skills in terms of viable alternatives: people with tons of money or those who value their time high can just pay zmi runners, people who dont mind high apm can do lavas, people who dont want to pay as much attention in exchange for slower rates can do zmi/zeah 
---
It's kinda related to the second concept. You work for a specific item tier (a better pickaxe) so why is it treated as a permanent upgrade to your character? Having a pickaxe permanently strapped to yourself, with zero possibility of ever losing or selling it is a bit weird imo, specially considering it's *upgradable*. It's an item, and should always be treated as such.
---
With a toolbelt, it's like you had a pickaxe level inherent to your character and leveled it up. Doesn't make much sense imo.

Sorry, I forgot you only get your politics on anime imageboards.

I think the main reason is because he's doing content that no one ever uses 
---
Whatever man. I'm being called a retard because of my fucking opinion and his response was straight smart ass so yeah I'm going to be a bit perturbed and a bit of an ass in my response. GTFO.
---
I'd say coin pouch was good for hacking reasons, if they didn't know your pin you're good, like if you have to log out due to real life and you're nowhere near a bank
---
Just tired of seeing the same things over and over in the feed.
---
Sounds like you were motivated by a slayer chad :D
---
“Emblem area” is one that I’ve used. Ranks offer middleman service for a fee. 
---
There many thing wrong in this game right now adding hats on critters should be least of their concerns 
---
Down for maintenance, cunt. 
---
2011 was my favourite year for rs2
---
Its quite literally on the busiest road in F2P between the 2 main cities in F2P, and is mostly common sense stuff to begin with. It is also mentioned in the tutorial. 
---
Hd looks trash
---
Alternatively you can do ffas with wdrs or on w365. If you don’t want to solo 
---
Looks shit 
---
I like the idea of bronzeman, I also agree that it shouldn’t have its own high scores section
---
a lot of people call updates "quality of life 'just to push their suggestions. 
---
this game will inevitably turn into a disgusting mixture of Runescape 2 and Runescape 3 as it already has taken several huge leaps forward in that direction of the years. 
---
R/Osrshelpme is a great clan chat and subreddit. Friendly group of folks
---
Piles of bones in the ground aren't people. But if you include the entire history of mankind, there were a lot less than any ballpark that can be assumed from the lies and dishonest representations that have been spread about the subject.
---
Hahaha yes!
---
You chose to chime in and act like a little shit.  It wasn't your place or a discussion you were involved in.  You just made yourself the asshole. 
---
Pest control; pouring all points into Attack XP so I can get 60 and pick up a Dragon Longsword.
---
I'm inclined to agree with what we are talking about now. I think you should be able to equip/remove it . That being said , I think either way , it shouldn't be prevented , though if given the option, it should def be able to equip/unequip and sell just for the sake of immersion/natural flow.
---
 And I didn't mean to say you were doing the NOT RS3 REEEE thing, just saying that's what A lot of people are doing. 
---
This game is a collection of inconveniences and grinding. You get rid of those obstacles to overcome, and you no longer have a game anymore. It's no longer interesting or engaging, and it loses what little challenge it had.
---
Yup. That’s all I’ve done since starting this account. It’s pretty great, until you realize you’re trying to choose where to start on a circle. Then I just freeze. 
---
If you're saying you got banned for trading 2m across accounts, you're wrong lol. 
---
Agreed - especially if you use that resting time to do useful real-world things e.g. masturbation
---
Never going to happen.  I'm running 2 pures. Neither of which could vote. If the game got molded by a bunch of no lifers, I'd just quit and stop paying. So would many others. 
---
Never going to happen cause Jagex cares more about my $20p/month than your completed achievement diary.
---
So, hypothetically, I say to you right now that I think white people are the only good race, every other color is shit. You would say that I am not, in fact, a white supremacist?  
---
Making rooms more points doesn't matter, getting slow rooms is a waste of time. Sounds like you don't raid either, this entire scroll idea is a waste of dev time and if it's polled you shouldn't be able to vote if you have under 250 cox kc.
---
Is it agaist tos?
---
TIL we cannot smith throwing axes.  
---
Support except to the fletcher because it will make fletching even more useless that it is now.  
---
  
---
Als... perhaos thrown axes should be made with fletching?
---
Sure if we start letting ironmen and pkers only vote on their polls.
---
Inb4 the straight hypocrisy downvotes   
---
What "legitimate security holes", please enlighten me Mr. No-nonsense or are you talking out of your ass? Or is the BIGGEST security hole the fact that a lot of players have their accounts unsecured? What does that mean... Oh yeah, the process of securing your account is not intuitive and Jagex could make it better. That'd be it. 
---
Exactly haha
---
Make pkers pay for the wall
---
&gt; alright
---
It doesn't.
---
&gt; ?????????????
---
Addons improve your ability to do certain tasks as optimal as the game allows. People have been trying to do this since the inception of RuneScape. People literally used to put tape on their screens as screen markers. None of this is new. Why are you so confused? 
---
Streamlining arbitrary aggravations doesn't necessarily mean "easier". 
---
If never again being on a quest and realizing "FUCK, I forgot my spade!" means that the game suddenly becomes easier, then sure.. I guess you can say that it makes the game easier but in that same thought, if that's your idea of difficulty, then that's a little disappointing.
---
This isn't going to devalue anyone's grind, it's not going to actually make the game easier. It might free up a few bank spaces and prevent a trip or two when it comes to accidentally banking your farming equipment instead of giving it to the leprechaun, or prevent you from having to make another trip through the underground pass because (X) part of the quest required a chisel. I can't think of a legitimate reason to not want to implement a tool belt into the game.
---
The coin pouch, I'm honestly 50/50 on that one. I could take it or leave it, but the toolbelt was an excellent update.
---
Thanks my dude! They haven’t ever brought it up. It depends on how busy my load is. I do data analysis for an insurance company and everyone is pretty chill here! 
---
Gz insure it asap so you dont lose it. Unfortunatly most bosses drop pets at much lower rate then skotizo (it's harder to do kills cause you need a totem). So dont expect every pet so fast!
---
Woke af
---
While I agree with it needing a nerf this would make the cost of darts that are better than the current BP stats to sky rocket and those below to drop. Also higher end darts would be giving it a buff which it doesn't need. Or did I look at this all wrong? 
---
Just logged on to vote no after seeing this haha
---
Bank is locked behind Elite so it'll probably be fine anyway.
---
 1st to show 60M+ wealth wins dragon claws, and 20M more! 
---
It’s a fckin game, ever think they’re just trying to have fun?
---
Iron men?
---
On a new account 
---
I changed my password and bank pin and got back into the account. I played for 12 hours and then went to sleep. When I woke up, I was banned. So I'm fairly certain the account is safe. They cannot access any information with my IP. The email didn't look automated. It just said that my account wasn't banned. I sent another one in, and haven't received anymore emails from Jagex yet
---
Turn off your Authenticator in your account settings.
---
It *should* be for the informed and experienced to decide. In a perfect world, the JMods, the game designers, would be deciding everything, putting the longevity and balance of the game first. Unforunately, as we've seen that we can't trust Jagex all that much over the years, polling is a necessary evil. What needs to happen is Jagex putting more thought into the longevity and balance of the game when polling updates, which would help filter out some of the dumber stuff polled, but as of recently it seems that they've just been tossing everything to the playerbase to decide. 
---
We should have the final say as a community, but if the JMods put no thought or direction into whats polled the game will lose its direction and thoughtful world/game design that makes OSRS great in the first place.
---
No, you can freely transfer anything you like between accounts you own.
---
And there is 0 chance 2m would get picked up as real world trading, especially if both accounts were on the same ip. 
---
Shame. 
---
So far it's awesome. I'm about 20% done with the fossils and I'm up to about 400k wc XP.
---
Yeah I don’t give a shit if I’m an asshole because I don’t care about what other people say about me and it is a public fucking thread so you’re wrong there buddy.
---
Make it a minigame world and have bounty hunters go after and kill people who don't play there loans back, and the money is taken out of the bank, and a small percent goes to the pker.
---
Think about not having to do trawler again on a new account for rhe same set if you didnt want to.
---
Source:spent 12 hours!  getting anglers 12. Fuck that trawler i want my next account and new players to have options
---
Yea should have I used a vpn?
---
Cox is only the best content in the game, why wouldn't mods want to improve it?
---
It's not even a scam, hes literally saying donate to him
---
That's easy to get.
---
Because you entered it into the phishing site, man. 
---
VPN? The post because if it was agaist tos then dont wanna get permanent banned I only got suspended
---
Fuck that you should just be able to light ANYTHING on fire using it and it would basically have the same effect 
---
Theres a leprechaun at like every farming spot for this exact reason.... You don't need the toolbelt for this one
---
"old content" yeah sure...and here I am thinking maybe castle wars might get an update...
---
&gt; Streamlining arbitrary aggravations doesn't necessarily mean "easier".
---
It literally does. Sure, resting or whatever works in a totally different game like rs3, but those QOL additions that uneducated people keep suggesting don't fit in OSRS. The game isn't balanced around those things, and as such, they're a bad idea to add.
---
This seems pretty worthwhile. I love the idea of the blowpipe and the niche it fills as a fast, but close ranged weapon, but it's just too universally strong. Support.
---
Shame.
---
Its saying its suspicious account of being stolen
---
Improving ability == making things easier
---
No, you're allowed to trade anything you like between your accounts. VPN is not needed, and if anything is more likely to flag you for rwt in this instance lol. 
---
The biggest security hole is the account recovery system that provides people access to accounts with sketchy, incomplete, and non private information. 
---
That is not at play here. You, and others, not taking basic security steps and using common sense online is the issue here. Even if Jagex prodded you more, you still wouldnt utilize the security measures that exist today. 
---
Yup! An upgrade through volcanic mine minigame. Lets you cast ultra compost fertile soil as long as you have volcanic ash in your invent. 
---
Why are there frogs? 
---
O ok well can I recover the account in a few months or will I be banned by then?
---
Rcing is easy. Fucking agil is just ass
---
70% of the economy is private...it's not socialist.
---
I'm not at all kid.  This was literally just 3-4 back and forths between me and him and you chime in with a smartass response judging the whole discussion and then glancing over the part where I was repeatedly called a retard.  So yeah you are ignorant asshole here. FUCK OFF. 
---
Quality stuff here.
---
Won't the damage from the dragon hunter lance stack with slayer helm(i) if on task?
---
But what's "annoying" is subjective and broad. And sometimes, there just needs to be annoying things in your way to make overcoming them feel more rewarding in the long run. When everything slightly inconvenient is removed from the game, the world starts to feel less like an actual living, breathing world and more tailored to the player.
---
Provided you have the necessary info, you should be able to get your account unlocked via the osrs website. 
---
Is the GP/hr worth sacrificing duradel's XP/hr worth it?
---
R
---
You can spam click it to not fail the obstacle.
---
You'd rather do 10+ hours of efficient RC to get the same xp as one hour of construction? That's the argument. Everyone knows construction is terrible to do, but at least its a much less time intensive skill. 
---
Remove scouting? No from me dawg. Maybe if they allowed both scrolls and scouting as a way to speed up the scouting process.
---
Whoosh lol 
---
&gt;Be 99 farming
---
&gt;Lvl 32 herb dies in first growth step
---
Now we got the 17 year olds nostalgic for the wrong time period. The game is OldSchool RuneScape. That's not oldschool, homie. That's like a year after free trade had already been removed, lmfao.
---
Or perhaps I have the ability to look at the hydra fight and drop table to decide for myself whether or not it needa adjusting for when I do finally get to 95 slayer.
---
Same with PvP updates and skilling content that gets polled.
---
Just because I don't always have the skill level or I'm unlikely to partake doesn't mean I can't look at it and acknowledge if it appears unhealthy 
---
Yea but no mods will look at it I think I already asked via osrs website but It says it emailed the email which i dont have access too
---
Also try doing some quests. A good day of questing rounds out your account getting over those lower levels with ease and unlocking new content.
---
Maybe try not following a guide and actually experiencing the game as an mmo? 
---
Running is what makes planning trips a strategy.
---
You’re not gonna run around the wild without some energy.
---
Not always. You can look at it like that if you'd like. There were people getting max EHP long before Runelite. And most people can't even come close with Runelite. It hasn't affected the game in any negative way, and people who actually have issue with it are incredibly silly. 
---
Wouldn't say it's a niche weapon cause it's pretty high up in the list for bis at almost everything, but if that's to be the case there should definitely be a cost to justify that.
---
Is there a reason why 
---
I just got my first today after about 500 kills.. D Harpoon. 
---
I miss Soul Wars
---
What's your WC xp an hour? Are you afk?? I'm probably about 40% done the museum, from herbiboar, but need WC anyway from the new kebos requirements for elite
---
What bosses my dude?
---
WHO U CALLIN A NORMIE???
---
Idk man, I get your point, but I'll have to disagree. Without reposts and overly used jokes, we'd never have premium ironic memes like the "RC............... SLOW!!! 😂 😭😂" replies. So in a sense, reposts actually contribute to the prosperity of the meme economy.
---
They need your bank pin for both your coinpouch and your bank. It wouldn't make anything safer unless you're keeping your cashstack in your invent when you log off, but if that's the case, why even have a bankpin?
---
The only QoL improvement I need is for the mining rock visual upgrade to be put back.
---
Yeah I think the biggest issue with the poll is that there is no middle ground option.
---
Keeping drakes as they are is absolute garbage. Making drakes completely afk is garbage.
---
Just give a valid reason to deal with their shit
---
Regardless, he doesn't even have protection prayers so pvm is practically out for him.
---
It doesn't increase survability of the herb, just the yield
---
No it is not, it's been stated by Jagex themselves these events are very rare so no, you're incorrect on that. Moreover, they've never even done anything about it so what makes you think they'll start any time soon?
---
Far more people get hacked by being unsecured. You have no idea what people would or would not be doing but it certainly wouldn't hurt to make the process better and then people would definitely have no one but themselves to blame. 
---
Highlight of my week. Do you ever stream on twitch?
---
You would have been secure in the first place had you not given out your password &amp; login email. 
---
My feelings exactly 
---
What bosses? And get pray up atleast to 46 for al 3 protection spells. That’s a req for most. 
---
Sorry I guess I meant it like WHAT bosses? Like... Not possible...
---
I just killed him at combat lvl67 my attk is 50 my str is 60 and my def is 40 my prayer is 57. I used full rune lol and sword fish. The mossgiant boss  is much easier bc you only have to use protect magic. With obor he changes attack depending on which protection you’re using. I have heard people say that they just use the defense up 10% instead of any of the protection spells while fighting obor but I’m not sure how accurate this is. I had my magic protection on and just took his melee damage which is quite alot. It’s a lot better going with the moss giant boss just make sure to bring antipoisons and an ax with you so you can kill his minions.
---
I know, just saying it's pretty frustrating
---
Way more people do cox then cwars
---
Then give it to someone actually playing the game not someone just standing there farming gold 
---
Haha no I meant Ted 2. It's Amanda Seyfried and it's basically a line almost straight from the movie:
---
https://youtu.be/TuCuI_dEOF0
---
50 atk str def and whatever prayer u need for protect from missles. full rune (rune chain has a higher crush def bonus and obor uses crush) str potion and inv of swordfish
---
Locking polls that will affect the overall health of the game behind 95 in a skill would be absolute bullshit.
---
Let's just stop letting people vote unless they're on a maxed account

Nice, ive done 200 clues with 12 of them being masters and i havent even made 15m total from them, gotta love this rng. Oh well i only have 3k hours in this game, surely my bank value will go over 100m oneday
---
Easiest if you have decent range and entangle/bind or whatever. 
---
As long as you can keep him away from you and your prayer up you’re good. 
---
What is going to be your method of repairing Barrows? POH with a morytania portal?
---
Well maybe if it got an update
---
This a 43 req my dude 
---
Attach skilling catalysts to artisan and problem solved; you get assignments and temporary boosts to skilling so it’s not pvm dependent but also not farmable for 1 skill and doesn’t completely devalue skilling. For power leveling or achievement diaries directly leveling the skill would still be the most optimal instead of doing artisan and waiting for a catalyst. 
---
You could argue you are "forced to wait" if it were implemented. I briefly played with it, and it being beneficial really depends what perspective is viewed. It's beneficial in that it speeds up travel, but speeding up travel would also affect item prices, and arguably make the game worse what with having to sit and wait still if you want efficiency. These updates that make things easier really aren't beneficial, in my opinion.
---
Hard rumble doesn't increase defence iirc, only the damage the mobs do. So you  always choose hard to get more points at no xp cost. 
---
what are you having trouble with?
---
Settled, you and verfs content makes me moist as hell. When group ironman drops yall better play it together.
---
Plus 78 range for a blowpipe and 72 mage for a trident.  The grind is worth it, they're very helpful items for bossing!
---
Can u cross the log in ardougne tho
---
This is what bothers me. People don't know enough about the game to make educated suggestions. You can use a herb or any other farming produce on the tool leprechaun and they'll note it for you.
---
I’m assuming cause he got red, white and blue. Which can also be a lot of flags, but still pretty neat
---
you can get away with using a god book if you're comfortable with your def level. blowpipe really isn't required, but it makes it easier.
---
Yeah, I’d suggest OP focus on mage if he wants to do zulurah. But overall range is use in most bossing. 
---
Sure you can do 40... But they give basically no drops and they aren't even aggro. 
---
They're not good exp/hr. They're not good gp/hr. And they're one of the least afk tasks since you have to click every single one. Fuck that. That's like the epitome of a shitty task IMO. 
---
At least with a 30-50ish Drakes task it'll take around the same amount of time, have better drops, and you can pay attention a lot less. Especially if the antifire change goes through.
---
People getting "hacked" by handing out their login credentials to randoms online is not a security flaw, nor is it Jagex's issue. 
---
The tools Jagex provides to secure your account are sufficient to secure your account, except in the recovery process, which is out of your hands as the player. 
---
You are literally asking for a system that can identify you uniquely by login credentials, which you hand out to other people through your own actions. Such a system cannot exist, nor should it be expected. 
---
Jagex tells you not to click on phishing links, and tells you not to provide your login credentials to anyone. These are also both common sense. 
---
You do it anyway. 
---
You blame Jagex because they didnt somehow prevent this. 
---
You arent even remotely being reasonable. 
---
Very sharp "elvish" facial features, the nose, the giant eyes, and the blonde hair. 
---
The onyx is the really lucky part.  23 kills no onyx 
---
come grow with us!,hope to see yall in our family :D
---
Are you sure it was 2?
---
We could call the clue Chile, also
---
Ideally that should be its niche, and in *some* places its weakness of its really short range exposes itself, but not often. Your suggestion would help a lot.
---
I've gotten 99 firemaking on both a low hp Ironman and on a 99hp main straight after I did it on the ironman.   
---
Yes HP cape + Regen with pool between games is amazing but it's also almost required, yes it's probably faster than running to bank BUT this does not compare to how amazing wintertodt is with low hp.  
---
 on my iron I took 4/5 cakes and stayed for 8-12 kills, that's a way more relaxing and enjoyable experience.
---
That's the perfect time IMO. With HD graphics, new content, but no EOC. Gimme that 2010-2012 Runescape back! 
---
go to the barbershop w your neice 
---
You add it to the 29.  
---
And it isn't P.E.D.M.A.S., it's P.E.M.D.A.S.
---
Buckteeth much
---
If you havnt even gotten past Varrock yet, then just create a new account, and practice better internet security practices. You havnt lost much progress if you are only in the first city in the game...
---
its just qol man it doesnt make anything easier running is just annoying. you are just annoyd that it would devalue your agility you are probably autm elegy haha
---
It's probably more a case of a keylogger, since I removed some threats, or whatever it's called in English, via Windows Defender a little under a week ago... I don't use the same password anywhere.
---
Though I can't be sure. I'm by no means tech savvy, if this thread hasn't made painfully obvious.
---
rofl your friend sucks
---
Amazon £27
---
48 degrees Celsius here today... I do not support this
---
Typing coordinates takes up too much time as well. May as well have every in-game action doable with a button on the screen. And make it automatically press every game tick.
---
Don't poll this as it's clearly an integrity issue that should have been done a long time ago.
---
The 4 inventory 0 nuggets gets to real for me every time :(.
---
F2p is a demo of the game. Why would we add something to only directly benefit f2p? Resting is not their only option, they have Energy Potions. 
---
Graceful is not that much of a grind lol, and agility is all around way too useful to not consider leveling. New players will see others with graceful, figure out what it is, and simply get it. Adding rest is a lazy shortcut without encouraging new players how important training agility is. 
---
There are millions of accounts, many of them inactive, most of them have names.
---
Remember that the name pool is shared with rs3 as well, and that it's been out for nearly 2 decades. A lot of names have been taken already.
---
Occasionally jagex will remove names from old inactive accounts and put them back into the possible name pool.
---
Also, whenever an account is banned the name it had is also removed from the game. 
---
Lolol 
---
But thats huge waste D:
---
Yeah, why?
---
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
---
I don’t even have agility above 70.
---
It’s just a part of the game and when you get rid of it, it doesn’t make the game feel the same anymore.
---
Almost every rs3 did was qol based on that.
---
to be fair, all facts and statistics are flawed in who is interpreting them.  I would not call ben shapiro an alt right, he is way more conservative then most and even agrees with a good many liberal views and politics.  Calling him alt right would be like calling joe roagan alt right.
---
Petition to make runecraft, smithing and ranged p2p skills
---
...I’m a girl... but I’ll work on training prayer. Thanks.

Average 
---
Why is that?
---
I'm having decent AFK luck with Law Runes via hot air balloon. Castlewars to bank, take balloon, repeat a lot of times. More AFK than abyss nats and less "requires Mournings End" than deaths. 
---
1. Starts
---
  *  Bruno, Munro, Gambit, Kieren, Tide (new), Archie
---
2.  Mod Tide Chat.
---
  *  New Jr. Content Developer. Been here since Monday, it's a challenge but am enjoying it! Have been playing OSRS since 2006, stopped at EOC but started again. https://twitter.com/JagexTide
---
3.  Announcements
---
  *  Kebos post still up, poll open still. Alchemical Hydra head should be coming, Jar of Chemicals too. Expect a blog  post by Ash - QoL things for Chambers of Xeric. Warding: 50k players will get a warding opinion invite to help get a bit more concentrated data and feedback. 
---
4. Q&amp;A Starts
---
  *  Mod Archie arrives.
---
5. What is the state of Bounty Hunter rework that was mentioned at Oct/Runefest?
---
  *  Backburner. We don't have a competitive gaming developer at the moment but as you know have just hired another Jr Dev and another could be coming in March. Going to be a design meeting soon and will have a good chat - and talk with the community. We will be looking at BH tasks (i.e. Kill an opponent with full barrows set equipped and other achievements relating to BH).
---
6. Update on Deadman changes?
---
  *  We have a very impressive backlog of exciting ideas, there's no shortage of Ideas to keep it interesting! Hope to hear something next week.
---
7. 6 second combat timer for when Opponent doesn't attack back?
---
  *  Explain and get a bit deeper into that please.
---
8. A teleblock sound or timer message when TB runs out?
---
  *  Yeah seems reasonable
---
9. A timer that tells you how long you have to attack a player in the safe-zone?
---
  *  Yeah that would be great.
---
10. Remove water fountain in Lumbridge on PVP worlds?
---
  *  We should do something about it.
---
11. What happened to Bone Whip?
---
  *  We didn't feel it was the right time/place to put it in or offer it.
---
12. What about other designs that came up too? Flail, D-Scim etc, 
---
  *  Looks cool and is cool but not the right time for it. Maybe we could do something down the line - a 1h crush t70. 
---
13. Tentacle Whip and Lava/Ice whips aren't  great PVP mechanics (whip disappears and drops tentacle, Lava/Ice and be dropped &amp; retrieved)
---
  *  Something that should be looked into maybe. The issue is that tentacle was made to be a sink and lava/ice could be simply made tradeable.
---
14. Can you make a high-level skilling method for gathering skills that is good GP/hr instead of XP?
---
  *  Yeah? Some of them can be good GP - salt mining etc. What about skilling tasks (comparable to farming contract?). Doesn't seem unreasonable, just have to find the right idea for content.
---
15. Farming overall is in a good place, with the exception of Hops. They're not really used or in convenient areas. Can this be updated - maybe with the trouble brewing game?
---
  *  We can but this is part of a larger project that needs to look at brewing on the whole and what the role of brews are.
---
16. What are your feelings about the lack of PVM bosses where magic is the primary combat style?
---
  *  Would love to do another boss with magic involved. Though now magic combat isn't great - we have a lot of options like using ancients or elements. Design-wise there's a lot to explore - could also look at how range is balanced.
---
17. Previously you've mentioned maybe making melee more viable for Alchemical Hydra, is this still a thing?
---
  *  We discussed initially and talked about whether Dragon-hunter lance should be better for Hydra as well as how melee fits with Hydra. Meta's have been developed for Hydra so not a huge requirement to buff DHL given how good it is at rune dragons as it is.
---
18. Can farming guild door fix, be implemented in Barrows? It can be annoying to get through the door when other players are using it.
---
  *  Farming guild doors aren't mapping/pathing properly so that's been fixed. Also if you log out without the required level (like it drops) you'll log in and be kicked to the main part. Spirit tree now also teleports you (if you DON'T have the required farming level) to where the skills necklace sends you. Unfortunately we can't apply the same fix to barrows due to the mechanics and differences between the two - we would like to address barrows doors another way but again not in the farming guild way. 
---
19. Thoughts on explaining prayer book? Maybe a toned-down version of curses or ancient prayers?
---
  *  Not keen on those new prayers, beyond Rigour or Augury. Totally open to the idea of new prayers but we can think of newer and exciting things. It has to make sense too.
---
20. Kieren talks about Run Energy
---
  *  Feels that run energy is a bit of a broken and dated thing. The META is to get Graceful and some stamina pots. F2P run energy is awful. What can be done to soften the blow at the lower end, run energy runs out so fast. Interesting suggesting in F2P that is a quest that adds musicians into the world that lets people rest. Strawpoll 'Do you want a rest option?' 54% in yes. Would like make graceful scale with the pieces worn.
---
21. Consider nerfing black d-hide armour? Magic def is too high and it's too good for how easy it is to obtain.
---
  *  Problem is that it's only broken for PVP really, would have to consider how to fix it for PVP only? Could also need to consider the current way range attacking in PVP works wearing melee armour - it's viable to wear some rune and use a MSB - should this be a viable combat method? How do people feel about NEGATIVE offensive stats on armour being more negative. To make the combat triangle a bit more condensed.
---
22. There's been a few cold-fixes recently, can you elaborate on what can or can't be coldfixed?
---
  *  If it's server-script, we can hotfix it. If it requires information to be downloaded onto your client, we have to coldfix. Sometimes temporary hotfixes can be put in-place until the next reset. For example we can't edit the map, however we can spawn that dynamically in server-script.
---
22. Can we get a head-hunter NPC to trade in spare heads from KBD, KQ etc to trade heads for a pet chance and maybe some slayer exp?
---
 * Not keen, would maybe be better to cash it in for some slayer points or something but not a pet roll. 
---
24. Can Otto teach us how to smash jugs? 
---
  *  Places where it is used a lot, Wintertodt, Blast furnace, should be fixed from the get-go (maybe make it so the minigame acts differently there without having to go to Otto etc).
---
25. Can we change standard spellbook? It's abysmal for PKing.
---
  *  Support, be nice to changes entangles to remove half-entangles etc. 
---
26. To avoid breaking immersion could Konar Keys be replaced with a tablet that the player would then mark and take back to Konar?
---
  *  Keys are alright, at the end of the day it doesn't make much different and if there's any issues after that then we'd have to see what can be done.
---
27. Can the sections in collection log have headings turn green once completed?
---
  *  Seems reasonable but it wasn't created at the time given how few people will complete them and it wouldn't be likely that anyone will ever complete them all
---
28. Can Magic Secateurs function like a slayer gen for a farming contract?
---
  *  Would prefer to go down the route that Guildmaster Jane gives you a scroll or something. Not keen to quest lock it for no real reason but would be nice to have a contact thing.
---
29. What do you think about ironmen paying for protection in Revenant caves? They have to trade on another account and the benefits are massive due to the cash and supply drops, this feels against the spirit of the game-mode.
---
  *  How would we enforce that? Doesn't sound like a massive issue and the 'protection' isn't definite. That's part of the multiplayer aspect of the game.
---
30. Can we get Elite Void gloves to match the set?
---
  *  Maybe if the design is right, don't see a particular need at this stage.
---
31. Can we see a storyline tying the Lizardmen to the HAM people?
---
  *  We want to do more with Lizardmen but they're completely different to HAM storyline. 
---
32. Clarification on Konar Keys?
---
  *  It's not going to replace the normal drops on the monsters table, it's only Konars table. Leaning toward making them stackable. 
---
No d knives drop?
---
Says 3 in the chat 
---
RS3 actually hides the poll results for the latest comp cape poll. Why can't OSRS do it? But I doubt OSRS players would want that now since RS3 got it 1st.
---
Great idea. This deserves its own post.
---
its absurd that u think being to teleport around the map at will is overpowered. it is just quality of L
---
We are all playing a 20 year old point and click game and call it a lifestyle. We are all autistic. 
---
Didn't hide the eyes on the emote tab. Rip account
---
That completely changes how the game is played?
---
I believe it’s 1/4K 
---
White one is French flag
---
Sorry my dudette. There are some pretty easy bosses out in the wild that can be mages with an iban staff. Hit up YouTube, I think Theoatrix does a good video of low level PVM
---
soooo an asshole crashes someone and comes here to try and farm karma?
---
Later Virgins
---
just name it something like "gay shit" and it'll never get banned
---
shoutout hozw in this thread he wasn't bullshitting
---
Gl, bossing is definately what makes the game fun for me, especially group bossing
---
Putting a space in front of the / is user error not the game lul
---
It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you.
---
Maybe to you, but people that have been invested into not just OSRS but RS in general for years and years dearly love this game and have seen a lot of the negative changes throughout the years play out. OSRS was supposed to a second chance for players who loved what Runescape used to be, not what it ended up becoming. It's disheartening to see a lot of the community forget about the mistakes we were supposed to learn from.
---
Totally agree on the korasi spec! What else would you put in your top 5? I'd say DDS, D Claws and AGS are iconic. But the tune throwing axe spec was the first I ever used in members and I still get nostalgic thinking about it now
---
I want a gem bag to level up my crafting via tzhaars shops so im doing barrows for better gear to kill venenatis for the d pick 
---
Gz on the achievement, but my god that is pitiful loot. 
---
My alt is Rimjobington. 
---
Definitely helped ruin the game by making it too easy. 
---
No it's not 
---
I don't care what they unofficially said in random Twitter conversation, read the fucking dev blog and stop being stupid. 
---
&gt;As this method of influencing the contents of your dungeon is earned, we'd prefer that players not be able to bypass it for free by using an alternate client to scout the dungeon 
---
This literally says that scouting will only be removed if the scroll method is passed as it's "earned". 
---
I care
---
Where's the coke and sluts ?
---
Rest was actually pretty neat. It was fun to stop by and rest, maybe end up around some other players who you'd chat with until your stamina recharged. Rest was the golden period, I'd say. Having SC, resting, and the decent graphical enhancement before it strayed too off. Dungeoneering was also pretty fun with pals, when you knew what you were doing.
---
Honestly, I just miss Stealing Creation... 
---
'lose'
---
Let's not kid ourselves. The only thing you really lose on death nowadays is chins 
---
I’m guessing pretty much exactly base 70’s?
---
Stop ruining harems for me
---
2006
---
The changes are to normal hydras, not the boss fyi
---
Reading the question explains the question
---
Yeah 10hp doesn't compare. Have a HCIM that I occasionally play and I've mostly just done fm while it's 10hp to avoid wasting supplies later. Same thing of never needing to resupply due to how op cakes are for low hp players.
---
Skip to 0:11 seconds 
---
Forgot to mention the part where is swears to a reward at least triple your amount 
---
If you are that concerned with efficiency, then buy the stamina pots. Absolutely nothing would change there and there would still be a demand for stamina pots. 
---
Yes, some call it power creep while others call it new endgame content 
---
sick bro
---
And mage+smithing
---
Not a fan of the wards, rebalancing rooms should be enough to lower the overall time people need to spend scouting to find a "good" raid, don't need to add any additional methods to aid that, just properly rebalance the puzzle rooms, (thieving and ice demon take too long), I don't know the specifics of points compared to tightrope but that probably needs addressing aswell.
---
The energy pools should not remove poisons, if the raid has shamans, you pre anti, or bring a sanfew, if you forget, you get poisoned, do not cater to someone making a mistake like that.
---
Although this isn't a balancing change but I would absolutely love to see the metamorphic dust have the option to transform the Olmlet into Vespulas flying form.
---
If your looking for a clan join : average joes
---
We do some learner raid sometimes with clan mate. 
---
Lol! I wish that was the change. I actually decided to drop out of med school irl to pursue something I really want to do instead of what I’ve been pressured to do. 
---
Edited out of the video
---
You mean like hiding poll results, which was polled and failed?
---
Personally think Jagex should classify more things as game integrity, but that will go down like a lead balloon.
---
Almost yeah, my highest skill is 81 ranged
---
This is funny I like this story u have. 
---
Aussie?
---
What about RS HD? 
---
Yup! Just waiting for the day the whip is 70k like it is in RS3 lol
---
Sounds like a good plan, gl man (;
---
So if I were in fact a unicorn, would you not agree there is such a thing as unicorns...
---
Yes... yes if that were the reality we live in, that would be the case.
---
Also I realise I'm speaking to a :brainlet: if you start talking about colours. You don't even know what a race is.
---
Going all in 110%, you’ll make it 
---
*Psst! Wanna buy some wolf bones?*
---
Good thing it gives no exp, otherwise there would be all those people with lvl 99 firemaking trying to get 200m exp for free.
---
That's not difficulty, difficulty demands some level of skill. remembering your spade has nothing to do with difficulty. The only way I could see it actually making the game easier is like how if you got koed in the wildy while doing a clue, you wouldn't be forced to drop a spade to keep your clue. In that way I guess you could say it changes the difficulty slightly, but I can't really see how stopping you from having to walk back to the bank mid quest is "difficulty" related. When I think of "difficulty" I think of things like boss mechanics and avoiding damage, things with actual risk, etc.
---

---
The Arceuus spellbook could have been the OSRS equivalent of summoning but at the moment it’s a bit underwhelming. Has so much untapped potential, I hope they rework it at some point
---
Judging from the fact that this looks like the only bank tab it seems like all other skills are probably lvl 1. Since skill lvl plays a role this might be about average loot.
---
Because a lot of these dicussions aren't "hot" right now. And those of us who have tried to fight against them aren't seeing Jagex listening. Blowpipe has been a problem for almost 5 years now, which is more or less the same for clients. Most people at this point see those things as the status quo, and those that still have an issue with them have been trying to argue against them for years at this point.
---
It's not like it's been that long since these topics were frequently discussed though. People were clamoring for blowpipe and tbow nerfs with Hydra's release, and Runelite's development has been a huge community debacle, especially when it was open-source and saw opposition from Jagex before it went closed-source.
---
The thing i never understood is why the demi-bosses don't have drops... It's way more exciting then just grinding till the end.
---
I do indeed :) Drop me a DM if you like!
---
We shouldn't use currently bugged mechanics as an excuse to add more.
---
That was my understanding, but I never directly affected me so I couldn't say with too much certainty. Thanks for putting it into words 
---
Whats more profitable to do herb runs with? Ranarr or Toadflex? Im currently at lvl 39 farming
---
Fishing monks. 5.8k till 94
---
Dont change ballista, tentacle, saradomin blessed sword, slayer staff, staff of dead, and i think it's good. Maybe toxic trident gets it's magic requirement raised by up by 5.
---
Not that i'd want this:
---
But It was a fun thought when I was reading the list of if we bumped up attack level for whip to like a 80 if it'd change up what is actually used for a lot of people.
---
Not sure, sorry. I did them individually. Trained str with a Sara sword then trained attack and then defense with a whip.
---
Hah, good one mister geneticist. Multiple decades of research into human biodiversity debunked by a retarded leftist ideologue who thinks categorization is a set fact instead of a scientific method to find meaningful groups of correlation and dataclusters.
---
You don't think acquiring knowledge and remembering things is a skill in a game? You're wrong. An extra inventory space is OP. 
---
For bursting slayer tasks, what gear should I buy to increase my max hit?
---
Since dust devil and nech magic defense is so low, accuracy doesn't matter, so prosalyte for top and bottom. 
---
Occult necklace, tormented brace, and imbued cape are boosts. What staff and shield slot should I use? I dont believe any boots can boost mage attack
---
I got a medium farming contract and got a magic tree, is this a thing? 
---
You dont just get hacked, especially with 2fa. You're purposely leaving something out, and it's very clear. 
---
Join we do raids discord server, they have mentors that teach raids and many people that raid. There's no single cc for it, more of a place to find people to raid with and learn
---
I think it's harder to stay alive for 5 minutes at hydra than it is to kill it in 1:25 honestly. Are you a wizard?
---
Yeah, other than the obvious (firemaking, fletching, construction and wood cutting) all stats are 1!
---
Super Saiyan/ DBZ comments can be filed under here.
---
I disagree, see. In your hypothetical "perfect world", we've already been given EoC, squeal of fortune, effigies, etc.
---
Player polls are the only way to ensure that the community controls the flow of content, it isn't going to be a 100% perfect or foolproof system, but it's what we got.  You implying that the devs inherently know the best direction for the game shows how inexperienced you are with the devs choices, they have fucked the game to the point of ruin in the past. This version of the game started with a player poll, and should strictly stay on that system until the day it shuts down. 
---
