I‚Äôm in the process of my second master clue too, I‚Äôve grinded to 85 mining and currently grinding 80 crafting to complete it (damn sherlock). I could use some loot like that!
---
I always bring 2 bastions, 8 brews and rest restores. 92 range atm and 89 defence. Done it since a lot lower levels with ease.
---

---
You should really be getting to jad with atleast 6 brews left in my case. Healers shouldn't hit too much but if they do just drink a brew and keep an eye on jads attacks.
---
What am I looking at? Someone setting a cannon up at a highly contested training area?
---
Are those the swords of revealing light?
---
Uhh was this explained somewhere? I just bought it off of the ge
---
Im pretty sure you do get my point but you just do not want to conceded.
---
There are some things worth shitting yourself for. if you cannot agree to this at all, i'd consider you mentally disabled. 
---
Now the next thing is where is your personal line for what you would shit yourself for. Obviously youd shit yourself for 10 million dollars. 
---
Now if you play runescape consistently and i asked you if youd shit yourself for losing last weeks account progress you'd probably say no.
---
But if i said lose past 6 months account progress or straight up delete your account, you'd probably reconsider.
---
Feels kind of weird to have to spell this out to your like you were a 4 year old.
---
So instead let me ask this to settle this. Would you shit yourself if it ment that jagex would delete your account?
---
When you say you wanna go get stoned but get crushed by a giant boulder.  rip
---
Same logic applies to most posts here. For example the RL loot tracker, you can easily kill 1k monsters then just hide all the decent drops from the tracker and then post a screenshot of it showing how ‚Äúdry‚Äù you are. Yet these posts reach front page daily.
---
Dude set his cannon right next to mine
---
You stupid? You can get third age from that master clue like it couldve been 300k. So yeah, it could've been 500mill
---
Zulrah dropped them massively which was before the time on your graph or ge.
---
I can only manage like 350k with gold ores
---
Why wouldn't that be allowed?
---
so whats the xp doing this, where you afk
---
Dude, i grinded from 69 to 76 herblore. After that from 75 to 80 crafting. All for this master clue.. Just do it, it could be worth it. I proved it üòâ
---
Goodluck
---
Leave me alone, I just want to do my slayer task without being personally attacked.

Haha she got stoned all right

Yeah but who cares

I looked up your stats, at 500\~ total level it is going to be very hard to afford to pay for bonds early. You're looking at playing for something like 30 hours to pay for a bond, compared to more like 1 hour when you can do later game content. Someone linked the wiki money making guide which is a good resource

Deep wild they would, mainly the guys risking alot. Only way to kill them is ags or claw gmaul stack. They don't let them selves drop close to 80 hp so it's basically impossible without gmaul to get kills on em.

Definitely nobody has access to my computer, my login/pin is known to a friend of mine due to him playing on an old account of mine, but this is a friend with no motive to do so and claims nothing regarding the hacking - I would assume it's an inside job and that it was my friend but i'd very much like clarification, as he would never have known my password anyway and like I said, has absolutely no motive to do so.
---
I should note my account is also a pure, the hacker didnt level my defence, didnt drop any untradables, didn't sell anything in g.e, just took my stuff and logged coincidentally as I was out for the night (which is hardly the case lol)
---
Fucc unskullers awesome account btw
---
It‚Äôs kind of a dick move but we don‚Äôt own spots even if we got there first.  You should do biohazard for the other cannon spot it‚Äôs usually a bit less competition
---
oh no, "rant rant" A player did exactly what I did but one tile to the west "rant rant" only I'm able to cannon here "rant rant" this player should be banned.
---
I kept on getting stretches of cannon tasks. AFK cannoning for 30 minutes just to get another AFK cannon task wore me thin, so I banned them.
---
Wait, I thought if you dropped any item, somebody can pick it up after a minute? You mean there's special rules just for items that can't be sold?
---
Imagine having the axe head random event in 2019

Why did you ever feel the need to have more than 9B? You could buy everything in the game and max several account builds with that. Unless you were rwting (don‚Äôt mean that judgementally).

I mean the chance on getting an onyx is 0.000001% so saying semi regularly is a little misleading

If your task takes you 5 hours you're either incredibly bad or are have them extended. Iron and steel dragons take 40 minutes top with magic, with duradel numbers.
---
It's not... how do I explain this... at 90 I took the xp from 90 - 99 and divided it by 9, just to make some even xp goals while I get to 99... The bar is actually 16% to 7,054,000 from like 300 points behind 92, with 530 xp to the next goal.   
---
I got board with the traditional xp progression... plus, 850k xp sounds better than 1.2 mill to get 99
---
I know. The joke is no one has ever actually gotten one

nope, pet cats are the only ones you can always get without luck as well.

Just because a skill is slow and mildly click intensive, doesn't mean it's poorly designed. Hell, it has around the same exp/h as slayer. And I'd argue it's less click intensive than slayer, save for catacombs melee tasks, but then it's actually faster than slayer by a decent margin.
---
It's generally hated because it is not engaging. It's repetitive and non-changing, much like agility and mining. Slayer has a bunch of different tasks, loot drops and superiors. The randomness is exciting. Runecrafting has *maybe* a pet that you will get once if you're lucky. That's why the skill is boring. Not because it's slow.
---
Slow skills are a big part of this game. I wouldn't want to see that changed.
---
I have a bajillion oak planks banked right now for 99 con. After subtracting the cost of the butler, I'll have about 100k left.

"Why?" you might ask... because I'm financially irresponsible.

I mean 77 really isn't that bad, like 25 hours of low effort lavas

For some extra information here, Swang (the player in this clip) had no other accounts and was rank 299 on his HCIM, roughly 2207 total
---
Seconded. You need 6+ brews and restores at the start of zuk fight to have a chance with acb, meaning you need to play near perfect to the zuk fight. With Tbow you only need 3 or 4. Tbow also speeds up jads considerably resulting in less restores used as compared to blowpiping the jads. Tbow, karils, crystal shield, kodai, sgs is more than good enough and way better than max gear acb ely.

go to turael and reset your task then thats why it exists

Making bstaves and alching will result in less gp unless you charge the orbs yourself.
---
I would just sell plain bstaves on ge.
---
Haven't completed the quest yet - working on it
---
Think you replied to the wrong person
---
Not yet :P
---
no one really makes that argument. the argument for 99 prayer early is if you're gonna get 99 eventually, you might as well do it early so you save a little bit of cash during slayer/various pvm activities.
---
Lmao, took me a second
---
Either works, it doesn't really matter.
---
I know it can sound confusing and convoluted trying to calculate all the pros and cons... But just take it at face value. Selling the battlestaves is a quick flip for profit, so regardless of whatever you paid for the staves how much you can sell them for is what they're worth. You'd be losing money making them into earth battlestaves, but gain crafting XP... Then again with alching, you're making a few extra GP compared to selling them but you're taking the time to alch for mage training.
---
If you're worried about just profit then sell the battlestaves outright and go farm gold with the time you saved. If you're looking for crafting XP, battlestaves are a good source of it (tho it doesn't matter if you're doing them with your daily battlestaves or buying them off the GE). If you're looking for magic XP, you can always just buy battlestaves/onyx bolts (e) / whatever to alch for a slight profit, or train it in a more efficient manner (Plenty of ways to get more than 80k xp/h). Each step is its own separate action and should be considered as such for a main account :)

My first p2p item was a d axe. My friend told me woodcutting was a great way to make money. So, I grinded woodcutting to 60 and started cutting yews everyday after school. I had enough saved up and got my axe. I was amped af to use it. This was in 2006 btw.
---
I remember my spirit kyatt carried me through that fight. Was a super satisfying win
---
This was my moneymaker then Zulrah ruined it. So then I did Zulrah. Thanks Jagex for ruining skilling.
---
I've been thinking about revamping skills ingame. One idea I had was maybe putting NPC "adventurers" near popular spots that may be far from a bank that, if you have the proper theiving level, you can pickpocket for food or potions. Nothing that would be particularly GOOD, probably capped at tuna and maybe a strength potion. Still, it would add a very slight convenience, especially if you realize you run out of food right before you're about to finish something far from a bank.
---
I already have everything unlocked so it just feels like a waste.  I do occasionally play a few games when I‚Äôm burnt out of vorkath tho, but I‚Äôd love to have something else to work toward.
---
If you're maging, use a SGS as your spec wep, spec the small kalphites in between kills, imbued suffering is better than seers. 
---
No, it's only good because of the Sanguinesti healing, just do the first part to setup supplies using a looting bag but with the standard melee + range switch and DWH spec. IMO though the Desert Diary is kinda bad so it'd probably be better to delay it until you can afford a Sanguinesti.
---
Zanik is too pure for this
---
Couldn't agree more. ZMI is only sorta AFK, you still have to sit there and be paying attention. For me I find it more annoying cause I still have to pay some attention but not little enough to where I can also focus on another task.

Opinions really changed over the years, mentioning korasis here was a death sentence. It's overpowered in pvp, it would change the meta. It should be way more valuable if they were to ever consider something like it, and even then I think a melee wep with that level of magic spec is still too much
---
No thanks
---
I agree with your opening, but not your criticisms. A skill is made by the training more than the rewards and rewards are easy to fill, for the most part. But a lot of the training methods your criticized aren't inherently bad, especially if you compare to what exists.
---
For example, while Ship Building was a lackluster way to train Sailing, it works for Farming and I wouldn't say Farming is a bad skill because of its training method. Likewise, you claim minigame style Sailing would get boring, but how would that be any more boring than any other skill? All skill grinds get boring so I'd argue a dynamic training method like that would be the least boring. Also, it was underwater caverns; not islands, and I believe it was in addition to other methods, not replacing.
---
For Artisan, I agree about it limiting choice. That said, there was never a "Slayer helm-like bonus to every skill".
---
As for Warding, I don't recall any mention of the splashing mechanic in the current design. And complaining that "it is a bad item sink" missing the point of dissolving and undermines your original argument. Dissolving is not an item sink like Invention and it was never trying to be that; it is an indirect coin sink by providing an alternate way to remove commonly alched/sold items. But your failing here is that you stated "The skill is what you train" and then you didn't talk about Warding training. Dissolving is to Warding what buying thread from the shop is to Crafting; it is part of the skill, but it is not part of the training and it can be completely avoided.

Another pmod here. A word of advice, you're probably doing it wrong. You should remain silent when you mute bots for a couple reasons. 1) because the general runescape public are arseholes to pmods for literally no reason so its better to just be silent anyways. 2) some bots record pmod names and disable themselves when a pmod is near. 3) Theres no need to gloat or say "Alright that's enough spamming!" Before muting a bot. You're asking to be called a name.
---
This man deserves upvotes!
---
They don't use it for that because it is capped at 10 a day. And like I said, the diaries already give a bunch of rewards on their own; you don't need an OP Cape perk on top of it. Perks aren't meant to be game-changing, must have things; they are supposed to be small reasons to use the cape while training the cape's skill.
---
The more we try to overbuff things "because it takes time", the further we stray from this, making more content lackluster in comparison and leading to more buffs to bring it on par when it never was a problem to begin with.
---
Ikr. I remember the controversy when korasi sword released, and how OP it was of a spec finisher because it dealt magic damage.
---
Think you need to be quicker, maybe 2t to react. And I'm not sure if it negates all damage.

In general you set your prayer against the attack that is most likely to deal more damage to you based on your gear and don't change it.

You forget that there are many variables like warding level and quality of ward used to dissolve. Making something balanced for all levels and wards and items will be a mess. A totally unnecessary mess that won't accomplish anything meaningful. It's only being added to pander for votes because people will take it at face value and assume it's good for the game.

The point is to make the game more fun.

Some of this community would vote for outfit overrides so you can look however you want with the same stats, are you surprised?

Repost zzz
---
Cut the wings, its human. Verac doesnt look a lot like human tho.
---
Now you're saying I have a weak argument because I don't have a criticism for combining items, the basics of crafting. I would argue that the other mechanics actually weaken the overall skill, making this worse than simply crafting.
---
Damn dude consistent and impressive! Keep it up.
---
You did well.
---
you're 2mil over mate. there's way more than that many people with 99 smithing.

Yeah man come and enjoy some of the fun. This clan has been a home away from home for me.
---
A bunch of teleports that aren't very useful / all have other ways to get there (most faster) is not OP. Bringing up RS3 in an osrs reddit is retarded lol. You can keep typing, but you spend a lot of time on a cape and then deal with some level 90 who thinks you shouldn't be able to teleport to edgeville as many times as you want.
---
the quick guides do, yes. For example I'm about to start legends quest on my alt (kill me now PLEASE) and this is the first step.

---
I've been saying from the start that you contradict yourself by saying "The skill is what you train" and then spending all your time for Warding talking about everything but the training. I've literally said it in every one of my comment and you just now acknowledge it.
---
I can agree that some of the ways it goes about training don't help the skill, but you've yet to discuss any of that. You're also talked about Dissolving, which has nothing to do with training. It is as relevant to Warding training as mining Pure Essence is to Runecrafting; it is connected but no part of the training.
---
And you haven't given any reasons why Dissolving is bad. All you've done is complain "it says it is an item sink but it is not an item sink as good as Invention!". You also still claim that you splash for Vis when there is no mention of this anywhere that I've seen.
---
this sub is absolutely infested with 2008-2011 apologists nowadays
---
Cries on r/suicidewatch but wont kill themselves and make the world better, what a big baby.
---
You have 15 million exp. Level 99 is 13 million exp. You are rank 2345. That doesn't mean there are only 2345 people with 99 smithing. Lots of people have between 13mil exp and 15mil exp. Idk how you are not seeing this lol
---
I‚Äôm sorry dad, I have run into some hard times
---
Ah but what if my password is a string of 16 letters, numbers and symbols?

Hmm, I mean sometimes it's decent (~88ms) and other times really shitty 400+ ms. It's a hit or miss, but no internet connection is stable here, you'll get dcs at least 8 times a day.
---
then I'm misunderstanding the rank system...
---
anyone who has never dung‚Äôd before needs to take some laxatives
---
What shards exactly may i ask?
---
Damn no homo but steve looking kinda cute.
---
You can gear up in pray gear, ardy cloak and house tele/slayer ring and tele out to recharge and tele back to neive cave/kourens hellhounds fairly quickly for free pray and ~6 minutes of free protect from melee
---
well, you do have a solid point, but if what youre alching with the ring you recharged lets say it was 3k per recharge... you get a rune axe drop.. the item is worth 7.5k or so, by alching it you'd technically only bring in 4.5k gp. if you are saying you're bringing in more, id beg to defer, as by selling it to the ge, there are tons of people just buying them just to alch them, still getting rid of them, so by alching it yourself, even if you are bringing in less cash, its still a gold sink.
---
Woth √∂ow combat you can steamroll trough early leve√∂s by doing a few easy quests.
---
So you fucking hate runescape and spend your limited free time playing it, weird but whatever.
---
Those sound expensive
---
osbuddy omegalul
---
1. Yes
---
2. I don't think so. Not 100%
---
3. yeah. I think my poh cost like 30m.
---
I think you can have multiple Superior Gardens. I don't think the POH Spirit Tree is counted towards the limits. And yup; Con is quick, costly, and pretty dull.
---
Probably could have written that more clearly - I'm agreeing with you it is faster with ddef than dfs and that offsets the added cost of the potions and then some
---
Holy shit dude are you on  your period?
---
Thanks for the swift reply. Good to know about #1, was the most important. And yeah training wise it cost me 17m to 83, but building the alters and teleports is gonna take a nice bit more lol.
---
By showing off how wealthy you are it lets hackers target you vs random noobs at the GE who probably have 10m banks.
---
Also the theory goes that your reddit account might have enough personal info leaked that a hacker would be able to recover your account, but idk how often that actually happens.
---
I think the altar and portal nexus cost as much as training
---
Aw I think it likes you
---
Also 99 agi, because speedy boi.
---
You're 25, get a fucking life.
---
Well the assumption is that if you are alching it with the high-cost ring, it is in a situation where your inventory is full and you need to alch it to avoid banking. So if the current option is 1) leave it on the floor or 2) bank (if possible) and risk losing your spot, adding the ability to recharge rings for additional alch would create 3) use ring to alch, which brings in more coins that it removes if option 1 was the alternative. With option 2 as the alternative, it is harder to say since it depends on how much time banking takes, but if the banking time was insignificant, you wouldn't use the overcharged ring anyway since it wouldn't be worth the cost. So you'd likely only use the ring if its high cost was a profit gain, meaning more alchs than you'd otherwise get.

I remember getting my first d axe because someone was afking too hard and their d axe head flew off. as soon as it spawned I went and grabbed it and it felt like a century trying to break the tune axe head off to put the d axe head on.

*Best keyloggwrs* - Runescape Accounts and Powerleveling review
---
No, as getting a task requires you to either do garbage konar slayer or point/turael boost.
---
Yo where's that hook hand going
---
Waste of money
---
cant it varys so dramatically from level to level and theres 3 xp options to use tears on agility/ agility+thieving or just thieving 
---
its anywhere from 6-51k agility xp with the semi afk method but because its so afk you can get loads of xp in another stat while you are there, you also get thieving xp
---
ppl still die to jad in 2019? yikes
---
NMZ or Slayer. Rune drags are only good for money but you'll get some exp naturally
---
aside from the always mentioned Varrock and Ardougne diary tasks, which are other diary tasks worth doing for a mid level account?
---
you dont have to spam click, you can click slow and only spam as the clam closes. and you dont do chests every 10 seconds.
---
you can do a whole hellhounds task for 0 cost if you have a PoH pool and a training dummy. Simply use the prayer mace spec on the dummy, teleport to Kourend, go inside the catacombs (this doesnt take more than a min), then when your prayer runs out just do it again. Technically you can also do it with rings of dueling but its slower.
---

---
Sorry not shards I meant platinum tokens

I mean, it's not really wasting RNG when it's a 90m item?

6-51k  depends on your current agility level + loads of thieving and fletching/magic xp if you want

Just a question in general. If your email has been owned and it's associated with your rs account, how does one change this? Given that the email to log in cannot be changed.
---
It was until he went there to clean it
---
Prime example of why I don't want to learn to pk
---
What kind of emails?
---
we should get all three void colors just like in rs2.......

Sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit.

Yup looks that way - fixed itself a few hours later
---
I'm Australian mate.
---
What's the suggested way(s) to train woodcutting? 6 more levels to go for the diary and I feel like offing myself doing these mushrooms. I am tempted to 2-tick teaks just so this misery ends.
---
That‚Äôs all there is to it. Cut logs burn logs ??? Profit
---
Dude just get it naturally. You'll be doing post 99 slayer and raids right?
---
The farming pet takes on avrage around 55m xp to get from fruit trees and it's even worse for normal trees.
---
Do sea weed if you want the pet, but your chance to get it from 99 is low
---
Most likely. The only e-mail I've received myself to compare it to is when I recently changed my password, and that came from [noreply@a.runescape.com](mailto:noreply@a.runescape.com)... It'd be hard to tell from \*just\* the e-mail tho, pretty sure there are ways to spoof it so it looks like it's coming from official channels.
---
Just don't click any links in the e-mail. Any important messages Jagex will send you through the message center, they'll never e-mail you asking you to appeal an offense (RWT/Botting are the main ones phishers use, Jagex would just ban you outright) or anything like that so yeah. When in doubt, check the official runescape page and if you can't find what the e-mail was referring to then it's a phishing attempt.
---
I wish there were a reasonable way to have overrides. I know it's important in PvP to know what your opponent is wearing, so I know there'd be pushback there.
---
But there has to be a good alternative to having 80% of the population running around in full graceful all the time. I'd love to be able to change the look of just that outfit to something unique as an extra set bonus.
---
Or even something like taking plate armor to a smith (Horvik) to have it "modified". Change the shape of the shoulders, add scratches to make it look battleworn, stuff like that. It would still be a rune platebody, but it'd be at least a little personalized.
---
Considering they developed the model and textures within the last few years, I don't think so
---
My email is still the email used to sign in, but when i tried to recover the password it said it would send the email to D*******@gmail.com and my email starts with a different letter. I still have ownership of the email it was made with and its sign in name.
---
Because community run ban appeals would be a bigger shitfest than the current situation.
---
As a Ironman I just grinded 43 prayer from hill giants, got near 60 stats with almost full rune armor (+power ammy) and prayed range the entire time. I had a near full inventory of sword fish and 1 strength pot with the emergency tele obviously.  This obviously isn't the best strat but for me once I got used it, it got much easier to handle. out of my 33 kills I only died once because i didn't tele like a dummy. This is my first run on osrs and im now a member but hopefully it helped y'all :D
---
Sara sword spec?
---
Secure your email first yo

---
What, do you just do the boss without going to kill the big purple eyes that massively reduce the damage?
---
The more xp you have the higher rank you are. Most people stop at 99 smithing but because you gained 2m xp more than lvl 99 you gained heaps of ranks leaving you in the top 3k players smithing xp.
---

No genius. The most likely option is that op is lying smh

That's because we make up a majority of the playerbase. I don't think we did 3 years ago but now we do. More players today are 2008-2012 RSers than those that are 2004-2008 RSers.

What do you expect Customer Service to do? If you can't provide enough evidence to identify yourself as the account owner, then Jagex can't help you. Period.

Just locking the account won't help. I mean, the hijacker already fooled Jagex before, they'll just unlock the account again. Assuming they even care about the account after stealing all the wealth.

Half are bots, half are probably people impersonating the bots to scam others, ayyy
---
Find it funny your running north? Why not south and tele lol
---
In that case the only way you could have lost your account is due too malware taking controll of your pc.
---
Its based on xp not level.
---
the real order is switches, pots, spec weapon, food, loot, and then one click tele + rune pouch bottom right
---
?
---
What the fuck is that inventory supposed to be? 
---
Are you escorting those bones to wildy altar while ready to smite any \[b\]wana in your way?
---
This man is 100% correct. Just make sure you have augury and rigour on the account and you're good to go for all deep wild bridding. 75 attack med with 70 defense is still low enough combat to bully pures at chins.
---
[Here](https://pastebin.com/fJ4BMrtP) is an efficient barrow's glove guide that is a good goal to work towards while also assorting you a nice bit of stats.
---
Barrow's gloves are a real necessity for any account. Getting to work towards them first will really help you out in the long run as you unlock a lot of content as you quest and skill.
---
I'd probably agree, but zulrah is a boss that you can only really master once you've memorised all the rotations and phases and that's wayyyyy harder than just avoiding the big fireball and the big wave which you have to do with galvek. Galvek has four, relatively simple phases which are predictable (always switches every 300 hp). Zulrah has god knows how many phases and seems to switch form every bloody game tick. 
---
Galvek feels like an actual boss and zulrah feels like a whack a mole where you have to remember the pattern of where the mole will pop up next to actually hit it
---
I don't think a lack of a z buffer is a reason to not consider an application 3D. 
---
The z buffer is simply a way to deal with object occlusion, but not the only one. OSRS likely uses (a variant of) the painters algorithm as its less resource heavy and there is generally no depth ambiguity.
---
Farming guild and resource drops.
---
Farming and mining (specifically herb runs and coal) are both trash right now as well. Seems that mid game profit methods are getting squeezed out as more and more people get access to late game content that provide those resources at a higher rate.
---
The main appeal to this game is the decent money and fantastic xp with virtually no risk. Rewards also scale to the level of the skill associated with the drop, so it makes it alluring to come back to as you progress other skills.
---
It comes down to how many times you get damaged and interrupted. Mostly you don't need to fletch but if wintertodt is like under 20% and you're still not at 400pts you should start to fletch.
---
Yer account dookie and not worth the effort probably.
---
????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
PAY DIRT!
---
Agility is one of the worst ways to make money. Definitely don't buy amylase now, get graceful first.

Ah shit, here we go again
---
It says I‚Äôve been pwned 11 times
---
There's always a loser willing to be an ATM for them, even in their 30s
---
Depends on your world's popularity and if they're speedily killing it. Most of the time I played wintertodt on its home world I had to fletch for points and barely made 400 points, wouldn't get remotely close if I just burned. I assume if you were just soloing it for whatever reason you could get away with burning, or if everyone is just taking the piss.
---
All in all very situational. Otherwise it's typically fletch=points burn=xp/hr.
---
I would prefer to just be able to switch between them. No need to play both at once especially since I am normally playing a different game at the time.
---
Easily. It's never worth it to not use Dragon arrows unless you're iron, you save 80% with Ava's anyway.

The only strange thing here is you saying strange, before (pretty sure on this) even doing a bit of research on that website.

Is writing down a password in a safe place a good enough alternative?

Yea not much you can do against a clan of 10 except use another pvmer as a shield. 
---
I can tank 1 guy or 2 at lvl 112 with 81 def. Bring 1 sars brew 3 mantas and some sharks. You can click the mantaray and then brew at the same time and heal a lot and itll raise your def.

I also eat an anglerfish/super def before going to raise my  max health/def

See my problem with using unique password services is, all your passwords are still behind a single password so what if eventually this gets leaked. Aren‚Äôt you fucked anyways? For example: Your keepass file is stored in your OneDrive but then your OneDrive pass is stored in keepass, so if someone has access to your keepass your somewhat fucked anyways. Also, if you get keylogged/RATed you‚Äôre also fucked. So wouldn‚Äôt an email with 2FA be technically enough without using a password manager?

I think it was good but then this sub, probably, whined (probably people who werent even using it tbh((like always)) and ruined it for everyone else.

A full days work can pay for a year's membership (Depending where you live)
---
A full days work on OSRS, depending on players stats and gear; is variable; though lets assume you make a bond a day, is 13 days of membership.
---
People value accomplishments over being able to buy things. Example; having an infernal cape signifies you can beat a very difficult &amp; challenging minigame with limited supplies and a good amount of game knowledge.
---
Runes and tp on the bottom row, then id follow with the sharks and id make a 3x3 square with the bones and the helm and arrows would be on the right line , the rest, spec wep and pot on top
---
Blowpipe is very expensive to use. You might be better off using an rcb to practice the waves, then when you feel you've got it you can get a blowpipe to do a proper attempt, possibly selling it back once you're done
---
because its easy to get. pures can get it. by itself its insignificant, but combined with occult/ancestral/tormented it'll give you a max hit
---
Let's be honest tho, we don't tell anybody irl that we play
---
Memes aside, Hope they feel better and are doing well. clinical depression is a bitch and a half. Stay safe lads.
---
77-99 took me something like 60m. so I'd say ballpark 45m
---
God dammit LOL
---
Why do you need a dramen staff for drakes? Just take the one minute bank walk?
---
That's so true. When I started it was just like "hey check out this cool game called RuneScape" and I'd just figure things out as I went. It wasn't until I quit and came back years later that I'd start using guides and sites like RuneHQ to learn more and set goals.

knights of ardougne is the easiest way imo, but you need 55. you can find a world with a splasher trapping the knight and turn left click attack off so you can just spam click theive it with little to no attention needed.
---
Eclectricity

dude
---
Or, y'know, making snare f2p
---
Pretty dumb thing to say. Many people are legit depressed. Might be a joke but just don't take the risk. Just be Nice and tell them it will get better or something.
---
Reminds me of one of the Big Lez Show finales. Awesome job cunce.
---
Those illustrations of her and/or other female NPCs where it's everything-but-nsfw

He is trying to skull trick people on the Wildy end of level, name is close enough to the "pull lever" option people not paying attention may click on him and skull.
---
Why on earth would Jagex not let you use it as a spade. 
---
$11 btw
---
Imagine getting 30m range xp without completing animal magnetism
---
What are you even doing on this sub, shouldn't you have a life to attend to?
---
Can you show me the spot where people usually go? please.
---
That'd be really counterproductive because then snare would be redundant.
---
The fastest way is probably thieving ardougne starting from lvl 55 with atleast ardougne medium diary, gloves of silence and dodgy necklace. Join thievinghost cc and there‚Äôs usually some people splashing a knight in the east ardougne bank so it gets stuck, which makes it incredibly afk. You‚Äôll get around 85k xp/hr at lvl 55 and over 100k xp/hr at 70.
---
Thank you, but blackjacking is fucking shit, just tried to do it on the bearded bandits and legit getting 68 xp a minute, horrible horrible method. 
---
Then it started attacking me and I couldn't get him off, blackjacking seems like you kind of know how to do it or not, it seems like the slowest method possible to me.
---
Had my ranged cape from 13 tot 30m :/
---
I had like 70k extreme attacks in rs3 back in 2012, and now I just randomly like to have 70k regular attack potions for no reason again. Makes me remember that and it makes me happy for some reason lol
---
What's going on with the letters
---
Thieving is fine and relatively low attention, but there are other low-level activities that will get you more gp/hr depending on the effort you're willing to put in. 
---
Blast furnace bars are the go-to recommendation: good money and low reqs, but click intensive
---
Farm runs are also good, they are really nice for passive income.
---
You can also kill chaos druids in the edgeville dungeon for herb drops if you want to train combat
---
Dead ass makes some skill feel like a chore cuz gp/hr is trash
---
I hit 2k before realizing I forgot to talk to Oziach
---
Didn't know it could do that

ikr this is a sensitive topic but is there a way to not to get ban by buying gold? Im not buying gold from website but a local app
---
Ahhh okay makes sense. Didn‚Äôt think of it like that.
---
This happened to me once. I just took out the darts and used them for the remaining waves, then put them back into BP right before Jad.
---
I died, but not because of the darts. I'm just bad.
---
yh exactly craws bows were only like 200-400m a pop /s
---
the community has changed so much since sailing was polled, and it only failed with a few %. So it would defiantly happen
---
Oh I see, bit confusing.
---
If youre not planning on doing mole or using it later for nmz then sure
---
This is why I have player attack options hidden. I'll admit this is a pretty sneaky way but most the time you can see them easy
---
lol sorry but not everyone who plays this game has 50 m to spend on luxury items.
---
This seems like the best option, maybe a 1/128 so if you camp the boss long enough it would be rewarding.
---
fuck warding and everything related to it
---
It wasnt 74% though.
---
I've been playing this game for a week :thinking:
---
I realize this might be a question for a different forum, but I'm having relatively frequent disconnects from the game every 20-30 minutes and I cannot figure out why. I'm in the US and it's happening regardless of the servers I'm playing on. It's less than a 10 second lag into a DC and I can immediately reconnect. I have a twitch stream open in the background that has no signs of hiccuping. 
---
I'm coming back from several months away from the game and I'm wanting to make sure this isn't a "os servers just blow" issue. I assume not. Any help is appreciated!
---
You always know when someone is religous or smokes weed, cause they cant go more than a few posts without telling you.
---
Ya except he put in time and effort in the real world to have the luxury of disposable income while others can no life play osrs 12 hours a day to grind away at zulrah or vork, raid etc
---
Curious, why 99 defense and no 99 attack and strength?
---
PAY DIRT.
---
How are you going to even do tutorial island without right clicks?

I got my first fire cape in 2019, it was my first attempt.  The real point is though some people failed it as kids and still fail it as adults.
---
Fair enough I guess, all they got from her was maybe 3k, she didn‚Äôt have much
---
Would fail a poll now due to it being to close to raids the closest youd get is polling a mid tier raid.
---
I was also going to suggest this but I don't know, there must be some reason why there aren't already elite gloves right?

Yeah you are either dumb enough to get phished or dumb enough to use the same password and email combo as other places

You're welcome.

Depends on the day you go what I take. On a weekend blowpipe or dont go at all. Clans love to gangrape on weekends. On weekdays it's better unless you play at peak hours, then you are still fucked. If you can play at nonpeak hours during the weekdays it is great money, that's the issue though.
---
Yes but they're intended as team activities.

Like I said, I dont have any points. I did not want to spend any since I just got my first unlock ever. Slayer helm

"Yeah, tbh I probably used the same password but idgaf. There's a chance I didn't. Doubt they will go through the trouble of trying to break through authenticator + bank pin for like 200m"

Thanks!

Will try this out. Do people normally just go on there and say they want to play or do people have any times they play? Or how do it work?

That's called ragging

Why isn‚Äôt there? Cause it‚Äôs all on a Wikipedia page and there‚Äôs a button on the client directing you to the page

Yikes.

Currently have 0 points since I got bought slayer helm. Prob going for slayer ring next.

Interesting, I‚Äôll keep that in mind. I‚Äôve only used dragon arrows for inferno and tob

Yea I figured I wasn't clear enough

You dont get banned if its your first time buying under 100m.

The one time I got told off for moderating the jmod who did it got in trouble... Ironically they were telling me not to use a toy horse next to their gambler friend. I used scrying pools to scout the GE without auto-logging bots knowing I was around and it worked very well.
---
The thing nowadays is as Jagex decided to move away from the moderation approach (due to wanting to review less, probably due to the customer support layoffs around the time the mute change took place) PMods started becoming more event hosts and clan leaders, and people who are active on social media platforms.
---
I don't think any moderators would be stopped from moderating, but it's certainly been discouraged and they don't really recruit people for being accurate reporters anymore.
---
TBH they kept that option because everything else in there can be bought 50 at a time mate I think you're just trying a little bit too hard here
---
I remember when I got my first girlfriend, I became the relationship guru, teaching all my clanmates how to woo women.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want to work‚Äù. Well you asked for that mate.

Why you bully me

Every set is worth getting besides the farming one from tithe farm. Prospector you need for a diary and a clue step anyways, so may as well get. Angler set is also needed for a clue, and it‚Äôs worth the time if you don‚Äôt plan to 3t fish. Lumberjack is good because it only takes like 10-15 mins for the whole set. The rogue outfit doesn‚Äôt give xp but I would go for it at level 80 when you unlock the shortcut, although it‚Äôs useless for pyramid plunder. I liked it for ardy knights at least. However the effective xp rate from farming is so high that tithe farm isn‚Äôt worth touching unless you‚Äôre actively going for 200m farming xp asap. I love answering questions like this so keep em coming
---
This place is a troll's dream, lol

It's so easy to piss people off here

Lend me 10k for a gf so I can make it 25 :c
---
The biggest downside is also the biggest upside in my opinion: lack of trading with others. You can‚Äôt easily obtain most items on an Ironman, which at times is very frustrating. That being said, it also makes every seemingly insignificant drop that much more exciting. I personally enjoy my Ironman (HC btw) because of the level of independence and sense of accomplishment the restrictions provide. It is definitely a change of pace and challenging initially, but it made me appreciate the grind of the game so much more.
---
Eggcelent work Benjo. Thanks for being you
---
Fuck warding. Ill go play rs3 if that shit comes in the game
---
Use runelite. Tons of streamers and Jmods themselves use it. Just make sure you download from the legit site as there are a few fake ones out there with malware. Runelite.net

You will get worse yield if you are using bottomless compost bucket. There is a glitch that they can‚Äôt find or fix in the code but for some reason the bottomless bucket ultra compost doesn‚Äôt work as well.
---
She made the account, logged in, did tutorial island, 2 quests, and killed some chickens. She didn‚Äôt talk to any players and she never got back on the account. How could she have possibly compromised the account
---
I love doing quests in OSRS. Quests give really solid rewards across the board. Whether it be skill xp or items, they‚Äôre worth doing as early on as possible. Then maybe try and grind out 30 in all stats, then eventually progress to base 50s. Really up to you and what you enjoy!
---
Probably not, I don‚Äôt know the result, I was simply pointing out your statement wasn‚Äôt true. Polls aren‚Äôt 50% to pass, so the majority of people can vote for something but it still not pass.
---
even changing the stats to max just made the gap even further in favor or karils. got it set to bp, rune darts, rapid, karils 3 pieces, 15% prayer, ranging pot boost, salve ei, bandos dhide boots, barrows gloves, avas assembler, and blessing. .2 dps in favor of karils over elite void. as soon as you switch over to dhc and offhand it heavily beats karils. but until then its worse. if i knew how to put up a picture i would show it to you for review, sorry.
---
I haven't looked at the calculator recently but I know it assumes you're using all patches (disease free patches increase your average) and I think it assumes the use of the cure plant spell if your plant dies.
---
Wow what a lucky guy

Lmao can you really buy golden nuggets on the Grand Exchange? Or is the price that RuneLite showing just something random?

Finish Fairy Tale Part 1 to get fairy rings. Then TP to the ‚Äúenchanted valley‚Äù Code: BKQ. Try to chop down a tree and you‚Äôll get attacked by a tree spirit. You can safespot it and it has a common drop of up to 20 nats. You also have a rare chance of getting a rune axe, and it‚Äôs one of the easiest ways to get one.

Yes, yes!

Jk that was good advice, you sound like a nice person

I quite agree with making dead content f2p. Not everything, but some of it for sure, like Rune Halberd, Rune Claws, low lvl crossbows... Splitbark Armour will be buffed, so no touching that tho.
---
Making p2p dead content f2p can only do good, because f2p players get to try out more things, get more engaged with the game and then buying membership eventually.
---
&gt; odds slightly in their favour
---
&gt; they always come out on top over a large number of trials
---
&gt; randomly generate a number from 1-100, if it's 60+, you get double your money, if it's below 60 you lose
---
&gt; they'll always come out on top
---
It's not fair by design, see above.
---
Could well be genuinely rigged, but I imagine that's bad for their business model seeing as they always profit anyway.
---
Shit isn't legal anymore buddy
---
If you have Miscellania, you can fletch the maple logs it gives you into unstrung bored and dump them into the general store without hopping worlds; you make a little bit of profit and lots of fletching xp

If i thought the rolls were real I'd play. Same reason people bet on black. But I have no doubt the rolls are rigged to always lose.

---
BA is super overwhelming. Speaking as someone who has done the grind and by the end really liked the game, lemme tell you that the game is a confusing clusterfuck of ui and concepts.
---
I think the minigame was designed to be as confusing and obscure as possible, with the main "goal" for playing it to be having knowledge of what to do and meshing well with a good team.
---
I sat down and watched a bunch of youtube guides for each of the roles, until I had a general sense of what to do, so I didn't go in being a burden.
---
The minigame is not hard *at all*. Don't expect to die *at all* on waves 1 to 7, and even then I rarely ever see someone die after. It's literally all a matter of knowing what to do and using the callout mechanic vigilantly. The fun comes entirely from being efficient and *finally* having a good team. It feels really good.
---
That's gonna be a yikes from me dawg
---
Hey there, I'm the person that wrote this Calculator so I can maybe shed some light on how it actually works to alleviate any issues you might be having.
---
So the way we arrive to that Yield value is via a negative binomial distribution, essentially just a way to determine the expected number of rolls when you're looking for X number of successes at Y% chance. In this case X number is the number of Harvest Lives the plant has (3-6 depending on Compost level) and "success" is defined as the plant losing a life as we know the % chance of saving a life (and losing because of 1-Y).
---
However the complicated part of this is finding that % chance of saving a life because it's a fairly involved process due to it depending on both the herb being farmed and your Farming level itself, not to mention the various buffs that get applied to this value.
---
This is the main reason that all those player made spreadsheets that tried to estimate yields varied slightly due to differences in buffs, Farming levels and the herbs being grown.
---
Fortunately a Jmod was nice enough to provide me the values at both Level 1 and Level 99 for each herb, and discussed with me at lengths about how the values between 1 and 99 are evaluated, rounding at several stages, etc. 
---
Coupled with some tweets from Ash not long ago about what order buffs were applied in and which way to round them, we are able to come up with a model that uses the same equation that's used in-game for the linear interpolation between 1 and 99 and applies buffs the exact same way and even rounds correctly.
---
Now there is of course the potential for human error in the way of Jmods interpreting the code incorrectly (and there is actually a fair bit of evidence of this already happening for different parts of Farming code that have been revealed) but throughout the discussions this was brought up and the actual raw values from the code itself were given as well as the explanation of how the Rand() function works in the game's code so this is unlikely.
---
There's also the possibility of me writing the calculator itself wrong and there's never a way for this potential issue to be reduced without someone reviewing my code, which I'm more than happy to do, as well as explain how I arrived to my solution, etc. because of how confident in the model I am; it's really thoroughly researched.
---
I also took a look at some of the large, player constructed spreadsheets that documented (with all the relevant variables) their herb yield and found that my model was surprisingly accurate and followed the real-life data that was presented. I wiped those documents once I completed the project but it's very easy to apply the formulas and values to any thorough Herb spreadsheet out there if you wanted to confirm for yourself.
---
One thing to explain the slightly higher average than your regular experiences is to look at the potential range of possible values. With Ultracompost the absolute *worst* you can receive is 6 but there is a (potential) limitless number of herbs at the top-end. It's unlikely but you theoretically could receive 30 herbs from one patch. Of course this is statistically very low at the % chance's we have and is taken into account proportionally into that average yield value but it still does affect it. Those big yield patches you have occasionally affect that yield in a big way due to the fact that the minimum is 6.
---
I'd highly recommend recording your yields if you really feel as if you're getting a drastically lower amount than what that calculator shows, the data will either prove you right or show you that you're not seeing the forest for the trees in the way of most patches being under that average.
---
TL;DR: The calculator itself is pretty thoroughly researched and unlikely to be wildly incorrect, you're most likely either unlucky or within expected averages and just see your normal experienced yield be lower than this value.
---
I also smoke weed too sometimes also.
---
Looks like someone has never been to the second floor.
---
agree with everything except teleblock
---
I only like Shantay Pass because it's a passage to one of the better slayer tasks ingame.
---
if in multi combat an ironman kills a monster, but at the last second a normal player comes in and hits 1 hp damage, does the normal player get the loot or does the loot just vanish?
---
Except any change to current skills are hated twice as much
---
This would be in the same category as disassembling your slayer helmet just to go to the sand casino
---
Imagine not getting desert elite rewards for immunity in the desert
---
Autocorrect got me
---
It actually doesn't assume you're using all patches, it's on a per-patch basis so that you can calculate for disease-free patches yourself. 
---
It also doesn't assume the use of Cure Plant due to the fact it's surprisingly computationally and conceptually complex to account for a plant dying at a random stage of growth and then being resurrected again (for it to potentially die again later).
---
What‚Äôs funny about that?
---
Its honestly a good skill and really helps the economy out, while giving other skills more uses. Perfect for osrs tbh
---
I agree..we need to make this game as easy as possible. Make everything stackable. Everyone meet falador. We riot.
---
The point of runescape: enjoying the grind 
---
You: buy gold and skip the grind 
---
ok
---
r/quityourbullshit
---
Fletching maybe?
---
REEEEEEEEE
---
Not sure why you include a video, but the answer is no
---
First of all, if you are going to leave a suggestion you need to be more thoughtful than *"I'm just going to make up an excuse to have more ammo in my cannon"*.
---
Second i think everyone on this sub would agree that the cannon already makes the game even easier and more braindead to play.
---
Been playing rs for 15 years, never once i got scammed or hacked i don't even have  a 2step on my account.
---
Should also add Auto Rake from Tithe Farm to the Good To Have section. Eliminates the need for a rake.
---
I like this idea. Maybe not so much new weaponry for f2p, but the rest looks great.

Sorry to ask a noob question but what is VMK?

Well it's not 2006 anymore

My thinking is range may not matter as much. Maul gets the ko anyway so I just need to get hp down using knives or something until I can get a good maul spec in.
---
You should report him to Jagex so that they can hire him, that's the best content the games had in years.
---
Legit costs me 1.5 million gp per day if I go by bonds, that's 15 hours of 4m/ph per month, or, 5 hours minimum wage.

BA team finding needs to be adjusted in general. I actually like the mini game but I don't see myself doing for anything but fight torso and dairy reqs.

The two were friends and the dude who posted it originally stated that.

Yo spoilers dude wtf
---
How do you get up and prayer above your player head?
---
Not yet
---
I can picture this person in my head so easily. He's most likely a neck-beard who thinks everything should be given to him on a silver platter. And when things don't go his way he drops on the floor kicking and stomping lmao.
---
This.  I can walk the equivalent distance from Catherby to Yanille and still not leave Hosidius
---
If you got 30m from it in 1 day play time, why not just do it to 200m xp and see how much you'll make :)
---
If not does it work with herb, crafting and cooking via grapes? Not sure what wmk is. With more keys? Fuck knows. But if it's useful with bank standing skills then could work with those three :)
---
Sorry if this is no use my friend!

What are you doing on a 12 year old account with no 2 step authentication though?!
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
1.5m per day? How many alts is that? Like 8?
---
Why don't they just get their accounts up to a point where they can kill Vorkath and make like $5 an hour. They'd be loaded in their country.
---
doing KQ without elites done.... I always forget my damn rope

if i dont have the money for that

Oh man I remember buying these so much when I was younger. Those were the days.

Purple graceful is more aerodynamic.

that's me in the pic, Haw was just joking , also I'm an ironman aswell just the pmod icon hiding it :)
---
Honestly "1 star too many nerds" is a pretty fair review
---
The best one I noticed was Nature Runes. Look them up on the GE Tracker and you‚Äôll see in one day 13 million of them sold and after the power outage only like 6 million sold in the next day.

once in a while this sub produces something good.

I'm a few months of tears before 76 rc and 88 smiting doesn't sound fun bit off yet

Hello *sniffle*, and welcome to my guide

*quiet sobbing*

Ofc you can save inventory spots by equipping stuff instead of graceful!
---
We need a goblin grandmaster quest, after song of elves, the menaphos quest, and fremenik exiles of course :x
---
Going for 1k easy clues, only 57 off so hopefully i can get a couple of Cape of Skulls rather than the continued &gt;10k loots.

Because it triggers you enough to make a reddit post about it.

Take more food, take Super Restores instead of Prayer Pots, Take 4 Brews and maybe a stack of purple sweets.
---
Get blessed d hide, the cheapest one is like 200k for the body, and has prayer bonus
---
Which one though. What do I type in?
---
Too many p pots, flick. Bring maybe another row of pineapple pizzas
---
seems fine
---
good thing you have concealed your cat‚Äôs identity
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right, I was just letting ppl know I‚Äôm not reposting someone else‚Äôs shop.
---
With mace and max crush its easily 3,5 without any uniques
---
Yeah wow for corporal beast with best in slot gear  and going off the other stats of the other godswords your max hit would be 164...so definitely would need to be nerfed lol.  
---
Maybe only 1/3rd  of opponents stats could be added
---
Thanks üôè
---
Doable with that invent would have to know what other supplies/items you have access to
---
It‚Äôs even worse when you realize he doesn‚Äôt have a fianc√©e

Prayer -&gt; Pray flick location: Both

When the 360s start showing up, never take mage pray off. Use the tall rock to safe the 180s. Stay calm
---
Thank you sir üëåüèª
---
Sick thanks man
---
Today is 4/21 it was 4/21 when he commented.
---
"Slightly." It's noticably different dude. The rune plate has slightly better stats than a dchain. The dchain is much better as defensive gear. Training in dragon instead of a torso is silly. Ironically I play BA with a chain on so it's less work on the healer.
---
Wow, never heard of this. Thx for the heads up
---
It's 11$, then.
---
Hire more pmods
---
don't feel bad, it takes a bit for everyone to figure it out...
---
Coocookachoo

Haha, that grind took me weeks, God I hate skilling :/
---
Melee based doenst affect my combat, how is that stupid?
---
31 Kc, not on task. Never died with one so, 30 capes, at least 3-5 on task.

Well i was Being sarcastic bro :p

Have a look at ur pic again me Gothylocks ;) üòÇ
---
What quests were these from? Lmao
---
The church of fuck barbarian assault would like a word with you.
---
People now use the wildy altar as you get more xp/bone. The bone you use is really up to you though. Whether you go for gp/xp or xp/hr is what will determine what bone.
---
Hmm, interesting. It's a workaround, but I'd bet there is some way to run an equivalent to a virtual machine on a phone. Would be interested to see how phones would handle running 2 entire rs clients, I could see that being pretty intensive.
---
Yeah it's kinda sad to make fighting dragons the same as fighting every other creature :(
---
You can play the same account :)
---
I wish I could pay for everything by grinding out 8 hours of green dragons a day
---
Wilderness Altar &gt; Reanimation &gt; Guilded Altar
---
I don't find "vote no because I want something else instead" a compelling argument.  Assuming we can't have both is a false dichotomy I think.  
---
And the more people push back on updates because they aren't exactly what they want, the more time Jagex spends going back and forth on ideas that get rejected instead of spending time actually putting updates in.  
---
Arguments against warding are much more compelling if you argue against it in terms of health of the game and potential negative effects of the update, instead of just pushing back because you want something else.
---
Damage is calculated when the projectile appears so it has to be on then. Why are you trying to flick them though? Fight caves easily doable even with 43 prayer as long as you bring enough restores.
---
Just finished MM2 yesterday :(

Typical combat weeb stats

---
Lol
---
did you make throwaway to post this lmfao
---
You usually shouldn‚Äôt need to. But the damage is calculated as soon as the animation starts, which is when you need protect mage up. So as soon as you see the animation you turn it off. Wait 2-3 ticks then turn it back on and repeat

Why?  Skilling is easy.  Some skills are exceptionally slow AND boring AND pointless like Runecraft... well mostly it's just that.  But agility is easy.  Just watch something and click the highlighted areas.  Takes 10% of your awareness.

half your comment was filled with unnecessary information.

Venezualan gold farmers will earn a bond before getting into the real farming. Even without doing Slayer bosses or Zulrah, they justify using GP for a bond before getting back into RWT after a ban.

Once you enter Gielinor there‚Äôs no leaving. You can Run, but you can‚Äôt Escape. Welcome to Runescape.
---
The guy you're calling out is despicable, and while I ultimately agree with both your point and your sentiments, the other folks in this thread do have a point that encouraging someone to end their own life is a step too far.
---
I agree a place like stronghold security should haveca boss at the very bottom. Maybe you need a skull scepter and opening the door drains a charge per attempt. Upgrade to fancy and fighter boots upgrade to addy boots, snake skin, or equivalent magic boots with 40 defence/range/magic. Bis f2p boots, new BiS but untradable. Regular drops are juicy enough to motivate kills for money.
---
I bought one earlier this morning for 1138m
---
Same, I used to walk to 7/11 after school and buy them.
---
Quest cape and achievement diaries make great goals.
---
Otherwise just get ready for osrs end game - bossing life.
---
Agreed here. You shouldn't be able to use autochat and should be put on slow mode unless you have a certain total level threshold
---
Imagine taking any of this thread seriously
---
You're supposed to use the alts for paying thir own bonds and your mains bond.
---
Just get good at flipping/merching and you won't have to deal with any gp/hr nonsense.
---
In the process of grinding more death runes to continue my D-axe/B ring farmingüòÇ I‚Äôm super excited for it though!
---
Hey! Quest cape would be a good idea I have 242 qp right now! Thanks for the recommendation!
---
- Blowpiping Slayer 
---
Best way to passively train range. It's upkeep is pricey, but hands down still worth using over RCB.
---
- MSB + Rune Arrows/Blowpiping NMZ
---
Don't recommend BP for NMZ though, you can get much better XP/GP chinning.
---
-AFK Fossil Island Crabs/Sand Crabs
---
MSB + Mithril/Rune Arrows and AFK for decent XP at low levels.
---
Every time I say something positive about warding I get shit on.
---
Stop acting like this sub is for it.

Still wouldn‚Äôt explain the pin
---
Those nostalgia days were the end of runescapes good era lol
---
Official client still has ads in f2p worlds   at least it did last time my bond ran out
---
Well yeah, depends how lucky you get at the ending when opening the safe. But each run is doubled in length without the shortcut. Of course the amount of runs needed is completely random
---
Using the same login info as on other websites
---
No, you read the post wrong kai, if you actually read the post I was fighting for other hosts rights of hosting not just mine, please read shi before you accuse
---
what I do is after every attack change to pray mage, then i only switch once i see the legs hit or i do nothing
---
10 sara brews and the rest super restores. You'll need the resores for the brews and they give you more prayer than ppots for almost the same price.
---
Why not I was using someones PoH when I was doing vorkath/zulrah  kills
---
It was 10K before... 8K now. It doesn't seem to be going up anymore.

Oh wow, what about ironmen or people wi\\thout alts to hold the bones?

The Venezuelan Runescape mafia is not going to like this.  I fear for his life when they save up money to get a flight to America in 20 years.

I like the enhancing curses part of the staff and just the general idea of a.. account security boss- but I think "Apocalypse demon representing the four horsemen" is a little on the nose. A SoS boss should probably be more lighthearted
---
Has to be in your name which is dependent on points. Ironmen need to make their own potions so can't leech off of others with 90 herblore unless they get the ovl drop from the bosses that drop them (not a good tactic unless soloing). Also, soloing is the most efficient way by far to get items.
---
Lantern for what step exactly, did over 400 med clues never needed a lantern.

So this is the type of people that runecraft

Why downvotes? This is literally how it works. Are these brainlets surprised that scammers have found a workaround to the first thing they‚Äôd be worried about when scamming.

As someone else has commented , there is a problem with signing in with Google Play. You'll have to choose to continue with a different account then type in what youd type in on PC, even if it is the same.

You only need to sacrifice one cape like the other person said, and yes, you can stack them in bank
---
Remember that end of pvp wilderness came out almost the same time as the precious grand exchange though.

If ur using bludgeon  use slagilith, your hit is way reduced but get like 15% additional xp (for non reduced hit value)

Ok, but who are you? And why should I care?

THERES AN EGG BOSS? Where?!

In the egg hole
---
I don't know if you're joking but.. that isn't an UIM lmao
---
What wouldn't be logical is having inconsistencies, which is what you're proposing
---
By the bunny in falador?
---
fuck f2p
---
Just use remote desktop if you want multiple accounts. I use it mostly instead of the mobile app cause I can still use runelite
---
Egg hole yes

Thank you.

Wow the edge is strong with this one.

Hi, I am johno r, I have been a player owned house host for a while, I want to help hosts host in the new world 465 and why should you care? Well not sure if you been to a player owned house but they are very efficient and help players out a lot :)
---
just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing I love your house and I appreciate that you use worlds other than 330
---
Doh
---
Knock out those quests that give xp, early training can be very slow. You‚Äôll be surprised to learn that Waterfall Quest gives you instant 30 attack and 30 strength. Also Vampire Slayer gives you instant 20 attack. These are just a few. If you check the wiki there should be a page filled with quests that give xp as a reward, and it will be categorized by skill.
---
No **I** am the master of cabbages! &gt;:)

I know this sounds dumb, but did you accidentally log out and log back into a different world? I‚Äôve been afk and accidentally joined a different world than where my cannon was, just had to go back to the world I was on and pick it up.

Why does he look like MMK? It makes me uncomfortable.

You get the free week trial by choosing any month, 3 month etc subs. You just need to cancel before the week ends
---
Yes but ancestral is end game content and worth a shit ton of money. Cape is a quest item.
---
My english bad what i do wrong? Correct me
---
They will probably rise to 2k in about 8 months
---
you can bank all your stuff and go to a pvp world and loot shit off the ground in the wilderness and save up money for rune weps and armour.
---
You either say you're depressed to strangers to get free sympathy or to hear the truth. The depressed don't want to hear the truth and the people listening don't want to pretend to be sympathetic. Literally keep it to yourself if you don't want to put in any effort into improving yourself
---
Is that a fucking Haiku?
---
I wish this was my problem. I've cleared the waves 6 times now only to fuck myself over with prayer flicks on jad every time.
---
Jagex will never permanently solve any type of botting problems, they would lose to many monthly memberships

We're not going to discuss the giant cannon in the room, then?

Did you use bp for ranged?
---
I'm pretty sure you stole this video
---
Im having trouble finding a full list of beginner clue rewards aside from uniques. Does anyone have a list?
---
Its gonna turn the game into a knock off rs3 with old spec mechanics. I really dislike the skill. Its just like my opinion tho dude
---
Why should I even have to explain this? It's a bad idea. If you want a tome of fire, buy one from the G.E. or go do Wintertodt.
---
Ironmen choose to limit themselves, they opt in to do all the content in the game if they want all the benefits.
---
That'd be like if I said "Add the Armadyl Godsword to the BH store! It's really only used for pking anyways!"
---
Whole ftp Ironman community built around grinding out smithing for those two items btw
---
Noice.
---
Can you give him a Santa hat and fancy boots?
---
So you should have to combine it with best in slot mage gear from end game content to actually get a max hit from the bonus?

How are you 2200 with such a small bank?
---
i was expecting it &lt;10 kc
---
Have you tried logging into a 2200 world?
---
I‚Äôd say zenytes first for sure
---
I see it happen all the time.
---
Just thought that it would be fun to make, and it is the easiest skill symbol to recognize.
---
I would think it is, yea. I haven't tested and compared both, though.
---
1. Simply having an alternative method to 100's of hours of RNG (for which the main loot isn't even the tome) is only a portion of my argument. It adds value to the BH store too, and doesn't negatively affect the profit of WT.
---
2. I don't see an issue with adding the AGS or even claws to the BH store either so long as the pts were balanced.
---
I still have no idea why Zeah is so ridiculously huge. The 4 houses should have been the size of hosidious. Mount Karuulm is actually ok
---
Lol, FeelsBadMan about starting as UIM, definitely makes things way harder since you can't use the ge. You're doing fine so far sounds like though. Have you done strong hold of security? You get a free 20k I think from just running through it, make sure to bring some food for the bottom two levels some of the monsters can hit pretty hard (up to 8s on the lowest levels). Btw strong hold of security is a dungeon in barbarian village which is west of varrok. You can do it f2p. 
---
My best advice other then that, once your iron man status falls off is to kill cows in the pasture outside lumbridge. Farm the hides and bank them in lumby until you have 2-3 hundred. Shouldn't be too hard with your stats. If you're feeling super ambitious shoot for 1k cow hides. Then sell them on the ge and you'll get some serious money. Best first investments are going to be a rune scimi and a strength ammy. I haven't looked at cow hide prices in a long time so idk how much exactly you'll end up with but if you have enough get full rune too, (chain mail instead of plate body since you can't wear it) from there you just want to look up "optimal quest guide"if you have a membership, and it will run you through the best order to do starting quests. If you don't have a membership, just do every single f2p quest the order doesn't matter at all. The biggest key honestly bro is to just do what seems fun. Once you've got some armor and some money you can probably go back to hill giants but you don't have to if you don't want to. There are plenty of places to explore and fun stuff to kill. And there are other skills besides combat you can level if you feel. 
---
If you're f2p: check out the dungeon below port serum, there are level 6,24,40 and 50+ mobs in it, a place to fish right outside with trees so you can pretty much train their indefinitely if you want, and there is a fishing store at port serum to replenish your bait whenever you run out. 
---
If you're p2p: I recommend getting some agility levels, it isn't the most fun skill but it helps with all the running in quests and other things in the game. Other then that there are so many skills just pick one and try it out.
---
Wish i had your troubles. Took 15 attempts but i only died before jad twice
---
Your the best
---
I know. Maybe I'll try to make a gnome child stage where the extremely steep hat is the only place for players to stand on.
---
look at my gyazo of my stats i have a good amount of buyables, but this 40m loss is gonna make things interesting.
---
Dumb
---
An attempt was made
---
If they make a change to blacksmithing or crafting I expect this sub to take the same stance they have on Runecrafting.
---
Not true at all, Jagex has considerably targeted botting compared to the last few years regardless if it brings in memberships. Besides they buy bonds with in game gold, I highly doubt gamblers are using their credit cards to pay for their bots.
---
Hey man, not paying 5 gold to teleporter to Port Sarim is pretty great.
---
well, that's how autoban and bot flagging system works...
---
Did you just get 2200 total? Might need some time for the system to update?
---
Shut up Bond Boi
---
when you get avg of 7 herbs per patch, its about break even (AKA 0 profit)
---
I dont get how this really matters when everyone using runelite can just right click a player and see their advance stats and levels?
---
Konar assigns where you slay pussy
---
Let's just make a store where every item in the game is sold for it's G.E. value! Why should I spend 100 hours grinding a boss when I just want the item now!
---
You chose to limit yourself, do the content. Play the game and quit asking for things to be handed to you.
---
runelite has a virtual level option, turn that off to see your actual total lvl
---
Lmao its because I don't have 2200 Runelite is showing I have 2200 when I only have 2196. Ban clients too op!
---
Yeah I finished the event he got his egg machine back.  I may just have to log in and try again now
---
Pls don't tell Jagex
---
What a cunt
---
Just explain to them that you're contemplating the meaning of Beatles songs. They'll understand.
---
yes thank you
---
Are you using the world hopper or just trying to log in? I've heard of issues where someone JUST got 2200/2k total and tried to use the hopper to join. In those cases, they just needed to log out first (to update hiscores and everything I guess).
---
You are right just logged into mobile and saw :$
---
Do you feel entitled?
---
nah you are an annoying twat who just wants to make easy money hosting.
---
What proof do you have of the ‚Äòghost mousing‚Äô üòÇ

Just get 2200 total

Yup

You‚Äôre hilarious if you don‚Äôt think osrs has tiers just like rs3 lol

so u 1 tick light the marrentils? Lmfao get off your high horse you scrub

What level is that monster?
---
i know i wont be as fast or faster than him but it just seems like my kills are pretty slow for my gear/range level
---
haha, if you can't even see this is a obvious ironman setup i don't think you are the guy anybody should be taking advise from when going for a firecape.
---
I risk 40k tho(in supplies) pls no safe

Any chance I could see your account first?

I'm not a very wealthy player, especially these days, so if you've got a good account then there would be very little point in you scamming me.

This sub is great. All toxicity aside it‚Äôs the only game sub that‚Äôs got a decent community that I‚Äôve experienced.

So when Jagex develops something it takes dev time, but when bot makers develop something they are just finished instantly? That's not how it works.

Better of with d med and get the t bow +15 bonus

There is still rng involved to determine whether or not you hit, my dude
---
Maybe you're thinking of Plo Koon? He and Kit were both featured in The Clone Wars and had a few good story arcs iirc.

Wow if it goes from 550 to 300 in a day I don't know if I should get worried or not
---
Dont hate on range tanks..
---
So your saying that 1 or 99 range full armadyl or green d hide has no affect. It‚Äôs rng. On that logic there no max hit then? Just no one ever hit a 600 yet. Rng ?
---
don't put amount of months put it into hours. People play different amounts so "3 months of consistent efficient slayer" to me is like 6+hours a day, at that point its like 2 weeks to 95.
---
Then you'll overtake me eventually. My goal since the release of OSRS has just been to get a green stack of cabbages, so once I get 10M I'll be content. I'm finally almost there after 6 years! :D
---
Though I actually found it more fun to collect them pre-GE, that's probably the one thing I feel like the GE spoiled for me.
---
You can do barrows if you haven't started. You can solo Rex or if you get a buddy can do dks. You could do pretty much all gwd in duo or trio. 
---
Check out Noble Bros cc, we do a lot of bossing pvm trips. Pretty much everyone is 90+ so you'll fit in and find lots of stuff to do

this is fake news.

Can u do wyverns without 1? Not sure
---
No, that's not what I'm saying. Two people could have the same gear yet yield different results.

How do you at all draw that conclusion about what he is saying?

Imagine using quest guides instead of immersing yourself in the lore

Try osrs forums on RuneScape

How much strawberries heal depends on your hp level, if you have less than 84 hp then they heal less than other single slot food. It‚Äôs only worth using that slot if you have 84+ hp.

Personally I think that blood spells are better anyway particularly for your first cape off-task

why has D crossbow tanked 2m over the past week?

Just go world 302 GE, someone will hook you up

pretty sure its impossible to use up the runes before the buy limit is up again.

I don't understand this way of thinking where people make fun of those who buy membership lol. I'm a very casual player so I probably only make a couple mills in a week if I make anything (since I'm often spending money on Skilling etc) so spending 3m of my hard earned cash every 2 weeks sounds really tedious when I can just spend $11 for an entire month of membership. I mean, that's like the equivalent of 45 minutes of work at my job haha

Or add a kit in game or something that changes animations

There's 3 in there I sadly can't do because of the requirements

Description: during any irl obligation or before sleep it is possible to get around 85k xp/hour using either obsidian or bandos. There is some argument regarding the exact monsters to use but a combination of the following are all feasible:
---
Normal Rumble (customizable)
---
Count Draynor
---
Me
---
The Kendal
---
Khazard Warlord
---
King Roald
---
Tree Spirit
---
Sand Snake
---
ToB Update: all instances of whip can be replaced with rapier for a few k more xp per hour and if you have an avernic defender go ahead and use that too, although it isn't a huge upgrade.
---
In terms of xp per hour the best setups are, in order:
---
Bandos with dragon defender and rapier
---
Obsidian with dragon defender
---
Bandos with dragon defender and whip/bludgeon
---
Obsidian with DFS
---
In terms of length of trip the best setups are, in order, note that any setup can be extended to 6 hours through the use of rock cake/locator orb:
---
Bandos with dragon defender

Wintertodt is not a boss
---
no. but telling a price could lower the price they could get for selling them.
---
yup almost 5k only 1 pet message over 3 accounts
---
It's already extremely fucking annoying to have to type the same message 3 times because of this fucking spam filter, and you're suggesting a even more aggressive one? Lol
---
He also stabs a soldier cut out
---
But how many vorkath heads do you have?
---
1) Well, of course it can be. But the more nuanced you want a system to be, the more difficult it is to make and maintain. The ML approach sounds good on paper, but you'd also have to make a system that scrapes for input to teach it, and also categorize into what are acceptable messages and what aren't. Not only that, there's a big chance you'll get several false positives, which I'm pretty sure Jagex are heavily against, so it'd require a lot of monitoring, testing and developing before it is anywhere near good enough to catch a bunch of spammers AND not mute regular players.
---
2) They already get around the restrictions that already exist (the .com and several banned words even with profanity filter on), and there's no reason to believe they wouldn't go around other hard restrictions put in place. A ML could potentially work on this, I agree, but having a good enough ML system is the challenge.
---
3) Doesn't sound a good idea on a game that has a strong social aspect. Imagine just chatting with a friend and you can't send any more messages for a few minutes because you're typing too much? A hard cap would have to be too high to not catch regular players for it to be useful in beating bots.
---
That last paragraph... *sigh*. Jagex is already aware of that and been working on it ever since they made an anti-cheating team. The problem is actually making it into a reality, while also preserving the integrity of regular players. There's no point in heavily cracking down on top of botters and cheaters if half of your player base feels the effects of those systems and have to contend with temp bans, mutes and whatnot for doing absolutely nothing wrong. Imagine making an account, playing for a bit and taking a ban because the anti-bot system got a false positive? You're most likely turning away a new player from your game.
---
A guy I know got 3a vams and long within 4 elites, this is way crazier though
---
yeah i agree, one transmog is ideal. But it shouldnt be just something you et in a couple hours.
---
I hate myself.

[J](https://pittsburgh.craigslist.org/sys/d/pittsburgh-working-hp-2000-laptop/6871493331.html)ust went to check a major city near me on Craigslist and found a laptop with an Intel 2020m (2.4 ghz), 4 GB of ram, 120 GB hard drive for $50. Seems more than usable for Runescape.
---
While that might be an exception price-wise (most were closer to $60-$70 range), there were a ton of Desktops in the $40-$50 range that would run RS fine and include the mouse/keyboard/monitor.
---
You have to remember that OSRS requirements is 1.5 GHz processor and 256 MB of ram, it's very low, if your computer can run windows 98 or above, it can handle OSRS.
---
They fixed it though. This was a week ago... do you think it‚Äôs fucked again?
---
FYI pet drop rate 1/1000, avg game of 16 min if you on a decent team. Pet in 150 hrs would be extremely lucky.
---
Jungly 2. Hands down. Dont @ me
---
Lol fml.
---
You forgot the ante.
---
The pet is already one of the hardest to get in the game, I don't see a reason to complicate it more.
---
What it means?
---
Soon brah. What do u do for ur new clue scrolls?
---
Does it have to be Gmail or does Yahoo work too?
---
I get that it‚Äôs a blatantly obvious scam and hard to fall for, but you think twitch would‚Äôve done something by now. It‚Äôs almost embarrassing that twitch as a company hasn‚Äôt taken measures or come up with a system to combat phishing/viewbotted streams.
---
But those exam questions can be *pretty tricky*
---
Legend
---
where can you afk on an agility course for 30 seconds. If you let me know ill be happy to do it.
---
Noobs. Using mage with str amulet. Don‚Äôt you know it‚Äôs not good for mage?
---
:( F
---
Is this what a mental disorder looks like?
---
You mean "look what runescape related thing my girlfriend made me"
---
What‚Äôs wrong with that? It‚Äôs awesome afk exp which only requires 1 click every 20 mins which you can do on something like teamviewer/chrome remote desktop so you get free 16 hrs of xp while you go about your day (assuming 8 hrs of sleep). Seems smart to me.
---
$11

Sea shanty banged his girlfriend
---
Idk I'm mid 70's and I still think it's the worst skill in the game. Money gets better but I think if you don't enjoy getting a task and then killing the same monsters over and over again you arnt going to like the skill.
---
But theres a girl.
---
Awesome! 88 here, hoping to join the club someday soon
---
the blast furnace bicycle gives max 9k xp per hour when its working and ive tried it and it kicks you off after 10-15 seconds and doesnt give xp drops half the time. I think it was patched to take away the afkness of it.

1
---
Jesus lol
---
Oh I did. Still had to give him a nice smack for interrupting me though. Show em who's boss.

Instructions unclear, dick stuck in fan

#MY CABBAGES

\^\^\^ This is wrong... The, "task-only Kalphite Cave" is to the **East of Shanty Pass** *(not the west)*.
---
Got to ge, people will buy for you. Sometimes free sometime u pay em
---
And then get perm banned before the dicing bots do
---
only bot clients screens go red when a random event appears
---
r u botting fam
---
I clicked the link in the chat from the streamer shaperka and now ive lost my bank 45m worth
---
That‚Äôs not true though
---
In fact, that‚Äôs impossible
---
&gt;killing stuff in a mmo for xp seems dumb
---
just curious what else u think it could be
---
In the past when elites were changed from being 9-12 steps long, players who had elites partially completed from before the update would still have to do 9-12 steps to get the casket. Only thing I can think of that may have caused this.
---
You severely underestimate how hard it is to make changes in production code. And even if it was that quick, what's the point? The blacklist would be discovered almost immediately and then it's just a matter of changing the autotypers. We'd be back to square one before the end of the day, except now legit player might eventually get muted more often because the banned phrases are a thing.
---
nice
---
No, but the videos you see on their youtube is vods of the twitch streams just reuploaded there. No vod on twith -&gt; no video on youtube.
---
Wtf 1 hunter and 15 con?

One of my favourites is a quote from Ava during Animal Magnetism

"Don't be silly; everyone knows that true warriors don't ever sleep... or perform many other bodily functions, for that matter."
---
Why are u being downvoted, whats nsfw about the image
---
No, you were tripping too hard on acid and you don‚Äôt remember dropping everything
---
Too many herb patches, too many resource drops, farming guild.
---
ok well not everyone plays the game as much as you or watches twitch so often. I just didnt analyze it completely because i didnt expect twitch to be hosting scams you know?
---
and its not really greedy to enter a giveaway. i didnt expect 5b I just wanted like a little drop like bandos chest so progress my accoutn
---
No f2p, will get limited extra content as it‚Äôs f2p.
---
Why is this nsfw? Not funny either
---
I would really appreciate some mod help on this. The 9th clue needs a req I don't want to get on my build, and I shouldn't even have a 9th clue!
---
Imagine having 1 hunter in a world with birdhouse runs. He could have at least done the natural history quiz.
---
exactly bro. I was thinking the same thing.
---
not everyone plays the game all the time bro its an easy mistake for new and newish people
---
HP level? if its below 87 use obby till 87. Don't worry about attack right now get a higher strength first.
---
Do Slayer otherwise you‚Äôll just be xp wasting later on when you‚Äôre maxed combat but like 89 Slayer. I‚Äôm 93 Slayer and maxed everything but 97 Magic so I am more or less forced to burst/barrage anything I am able to otherwise I‚Äôm afk meleeing and not being as efficient as I could be.
---
Don't you know there are struggling swamp men in morytania who could use that, smh wasteful
---
So like 1k per day return on investment. Nice.
---
ye
---
dh is only good from 91 str obsdian is bis until then
---
Rune pouch should be in the bottom right
---
Every skill has always required feedback after going live to smooth out and get improvements. There's nothing wrong with that process
---
LOL that's amazing
---
Birdhouses are now used for the early hunter levels until chin hunting. You can farm seaweed instead of buying it for crafting, same as snake grass. The farming guild has sped up the acquisition of seeds and herbs for iron men thanks to farming contracts. Wintertodtis profitable firemaking until 99+. Probably a few others I‚Äôm missing
---
Sizable if actual
---
Lol he‚Äôs a day lay in rising again.
---
inb4 its only worth 500m and I've had more gp worth just in ores from mining stop saying dumb shit ty
---
Works with ALL harvested produce
---
Dunce boy is the most useful one by far though
---
Imagine getting 99 range without an accumulator.
---
Every single day someone posts on here they lost money from fake streams. And every single day they wonder why they get ridiculed when they post it. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúnew stream‚Äù most link to the same fake site that steals your shit. I just wonder how you could input all your info, then your 2 step, then your bank pin. And wonder half way through... maybe this was a bad idea? Like the website never asks for Authenticator or bank pin like the fake site does. Jesus Christ mods just pin something to the top of this sub about fake streams, if twitch and jagex won‚Äôt do shit you can.
---
Gargantuan if reputable
---
You can do tithe farm and unlock autoweed so they never grow back once cleared
---
Real shit?
---
It's one of the quickest way to tell what to pray. You can do it even before the stomp. Aggro a healer wait to switch pray. Rinse and repeat just do something amd be ready to switch pray. Usually you don't have to switch but that's how I've done it and I'm a fucking scrub.
---
Reallly good idea please someone implement this
---
God damn
---
Only if the tokens look exactly like OPs.
---
It's a bitch to get to at low levels, the docks are confusing and there's no way to tell which boat goes to which location, there's no bank and the Slayer cave is probably the worst in the game.
---
They're only so disposable because they're lvl 3's, needing to make all their accounts all have a 150 total level will severely slow them down
---
There's a music video which kind of blew up into a meme called crab rave I think. People then took that and added complaints from the game to the music video, making the long-term complaints we have associated with the crabs.
---
tl;dr they are a symbol of complaining around here.
---
Also The Feud quest gives access to Ali‚Äôs rune shop, which sells bags laws and cosmics
---
Vorkath would be easy...
---
U have to spend like 5-10 minutes to get a rock cake from rfd
---
sea shanty overrated. barbarianism is the real fire.
---
No he can't sadly, he suffers from idiotism.
---
What? Do you expect pmods to stop playing the game to mute bots that will be replaced in a matter of hours automatically? It‚Äôs not like they can just eradicate those bots and then go about their day.
