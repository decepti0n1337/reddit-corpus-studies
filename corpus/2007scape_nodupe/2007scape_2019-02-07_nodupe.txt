A lot tbh I think. My friend has a 60 att 70 def med level with piety, rigour and augury and it’s probably one of the most OP builds for tribridding. Lots of Void accounts also get to this point now since it’s really the only viable void build since it was nerfed a while back. 
---
Literally unenjoyable

thank you!! :)

Before you know it Sammy and Zammy will be nuking it's backyard!

Big slow low alch

jad already tells you what to pray when you look at him.

"the only people with experience in killing naked people are the only people who don't know that they never drop anything good"

Maybe pkers know something you don't

More likely an EHP competition but yea basically. Probably agility tickets or something.

Yes please, this would be a wonderful thing. A fun break and brings sense of satisfaction as you find disguised penguins in obscure locations.
---
Depends on when they do the engine work. If thats done it can come quite fast.

checked &amp; according to this site my email is safe, thank you! :)

I had a go on RS3 earlier. It's obviously a totally different game but something just shouldn't be changed, like Lumbridge or the Al Kharid gate. Please don't do this to OSRS too :(

Authenticator delay wouldn't help this scenario, they get your IP from you clicking on the link and they can already bypass the authenticator without removing it.

sugar and grease isn't really valuable  anymore
---
I use rune legs, helm, mystic body, boots, gloves, avas accumulator, glory, RoD, iban staff (all brothers), dragon long (for killing crypt creatures) and bone bolts w/ cbow (for Ahrim).
---
I manage with 1-2 ppots per run, and sharks or monks. 
---
I start dharok and work clockwise finishing with Ahrim, saving Verac for last (no real need for prayer). Flick prayer on everyone except Dharok.
---
I try to wait for the brothers to do their ghost face before I use a pot.
---
Made 3m in a couple days doing a few runs here and there at a time. Gl
---
yo when is the next riot dawg
---
Player from 2004 here. Completely disagree. Stopping change and progress in favour of nostalgia is what is going to eventually kill this game.
---
Gz 
---
Fucking RIP mith chain
---
While being very entertaining to watch and all...
---
These accounts are getting out of hand
---
Thanks guys! Hopefully I’ll get one soon to keep this grind alive haha
---
What about that certain outfit I see everyone wearing?
---
!remindme 1 week
---
SAD!
---
You don't have to spare anyone, just like nobody has to act like bad PKers are doing anything other than dedicating their time to fucking other players over. You're killing players who usually have a specific mission and are often not equipped for PVP, of course they're going to think less of you.
---
Same. For a couple of months, Slayer was even lower than my RC level. 
---
I understand it can be very profitable but I’ve yet to experience that. I trained from 58 to 63 recently and the the only tasks I received were 2 x Black Demons, Fire Giants and Blue Dragon. Yay, I guess? I just received another Fire Giants task today and I’m gonna take a break on Slayer for a while. Apparently Slayer only gets good until level 70. Right now I feel like I’m wasting my time doing all these shitty tasks when I can make more money from Barrows instead.
---
This might be because I played the forest recently but.. this kinda looks like an effigy 
---
Truly amazing. It has been quite some time since I saw an idea that was this bad.
---
Wait new plan lets put zulrah in the house
---
"Pile" is a strong word.

In fairness it is blocked by under Jagex’s own profanity filter.

Wtf am I looking at

Great work, we're onto something here.

How do I delete this comment 
---
It's a new, popular youtube series made by a guy named Settled where he has an Ultimate Iron Man that has to stay inside of Morytania and see how far he can progress. 
---
This is Episode 10 of that series. it's not a meme, it's just well made and entertaining content so people upvote the shit out of it. You can expect to see a post like this once a week, which is how often he uploads.
---
If you like watching Runescape videos and want to kill some time, you should give it a try. I'm not really sure why it's fun to watch, but it is
---
What I liked least about dungeoneering is that playing solo was significantly worse than being boosted.
---
This is where members of the pk community need to step in and notify jmods then.
---
game reverted back to it's natural state and being

a potato
---
Justice for Grug. He do no wrong thing. Just ice barrage.
---
Just wanted to follow up. That cc worked out very well. Finished Heroes’ Quest! 
---
You ruined the meme with this absurdity mate 
---
To be fair on myself, I mostly afk at work so it's easy to get my combat skills up without actually dedicating hours to the game.
---
Is your twitch rRamon?
---
I’d have no way of telling I guess lol
---
Do i need a card?
---
Good post man. So many people are against area locked accounts that Settled only got 20k likes to 100ish dislikes on his video
---
I wouldn’t know, i only played OG when I was young and don’t remember. But it’s still definitely annoying to run that many laps. I know there are a few ways that have a max of 50-60k xp per hour if done well
---
whats the point of this comment? you just restated everything he said.
---
Like most people 
---
Fuckin Jamfleggs not respecting our native pronouns.
---
Cool never expected a reply, yeah i love this game just hated the grind. I've really enjoyed the game though since i came back and kind of inspired to hit the ToB too thanks to swamp :P also started checking out your streams and some other streamers too. I have so much to learn but thank you for the warm welcome back!
---
eh, i mean you just seem like most people who just do pvm/slayer post-max but threw in hunter in there for some reason
---
i guess, idk i got over my achievement cape pretty quick once i got 99 craft, and now i just wear con cape everywhere. Function &gt; form for me haha
---

Again bitch

It's Dungeoneering music from RS2/3, not sure which track exactly but I believe it's the music that plays when you enter a guardian room. 
---
they are pk clients, you can end up getting banned for that shit though.
---
Combat triangle, mate.
---
Wb dragon hunter cannon?
---
[Here's EVScape's guide to it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3urm4m8SLbc) He recommends 24 Overload doses and the rest absorptions. That seems like a pretty good number in my experience. 
---
The damage isn't high enough to ko anyone who isn't defenseless already 
---
OK so what's the point of having established lore and rules in universe if it can all just be handwaved away with magic? Couldn't a dragon hunter trident just be enchanted with some kind of anti-dragon magic? There now it fits the lore. 
---
There are plenty of 0 stat involved money making methods that will make you more than what you can do with your skills. So I’d mix that in with just training until your skills can provide 
---
Usually PVM being the best but you’re far too low rn
---
The closest thing to bossing around your level will be Barrows, get the ibans staff and give that a try. I heavily recommend getting your combat up though, 50-70/80 shouldn't take too long, and if you're looking for a more afk method, killing bandits is fairly afk if you're wearing a god item. 
---
what I'm wondering is the dodgy necklace prevents you from taking damage correct? So wouldn't it be more beneficial to just have an inventory of those rather than food?
---
I hate getting pked when I'm doing a clue but it happens so rarely that it's basically a non issue. I don't understand the hate towards people who do it, especially considering it's mostly just an act of opportunity.
---
you've posted 30 comments in the past 24 hours, more than once per hour. get a fucking grip

When I was a lot younger I remember seeing a FPS runescape and modern warfare 2 made into one game. Look up "Runescape Mw2" on youtube and you'll find it

---
its cheap and weaker then imbue rings, what does it matter?
---
I mean easy or not it takes like 5x as long or more to get in comparison to any of those. Assuming noob method you're looking at 45k-65k an hour to 99 while cooking is like 450k/hr, fletch is 0 time, fm is 300k/hr. 
---
He will need a gargoyle task, and ask long as his dog task is incompletable he won't be able to get to grotesque guardians :( 
---
Same boat as you man haha. Just hit 73 qp and I already wanna quit. Though I had no problem stun alching 76-91 magic on mobile, or grinding out 99 range. Fuck I hate quests. 
---
It has a chance to prevent the damage but doesn't guarantee it so food is still necessary. 
---
Oh ok this is the first I’m hearing of this
---
I don't think the pray switching one is Exilent.
---
It’s THE best f2p method tho.
---
Drugs and alcohol. Another wank.
---
Sorry I’m not a therapist but I try my best 
---
Well technically you could fletch and do alchs if you're doing 3t barb
---
Balancing the game around single NPC's or builds is a crap idea anyway. Less room for growth. Some things have to get easier as a by product of meta changing equipment. Some things should also get harder, like camping Lava drags for loot. Just as much of an issue, just in the opposite direction. Tbh. 
---
Dragon Full Helm? 40m+ item
---
i mean we can argue this back n forth, i just consider it on the same level as those capes lol
---
also most noobs arent doing wines or 0 time fletching, theyre chillin with monks/sharks in rogues den and doing yew longs/mage longs
---
I like bringing my cannon out when I'm fishing monkfish.

"the boys at school were sure to snigger at him behind his back"
---
I would like a good zeah quest tbh. The ones so far have been good but too easy and short
---
But if you scroll in the New filter its in the wrong order still. 
---
Not over a fight cape, but the final fight. It turned out to be much easier than I expected it to be, but all the preps got me shaky.
---
#30% ACCURATE TO THE DRAGON
---
Farming cape makes you look tacky with all the different shades of green. Ranged cape superior
---
England is older than America, that is correct. Was just disputing the retard
---
I think he just wanted to get it done ASAP and not waste loads of hours praying to the barrow gods.
---
The real reason I don't make pures anymore
---
People enjoy castle wars but still don't play it because of the lack of overpowered rewards. People hate pest control but play it because of the, maybe not overpowered, but very strong rewards.
---
It doesn't matter if people enjoy a piece of content, if it's not worthwhile it won't be popular.
---
Lore matter wtf dude.
---
Dude how are you thinking that when her vageen is right there. 
---
The wiki is probably using a similar system to the website. Shows % of total votes, not % of yes/no. Since theres a skip option 74 can say yes, 10% can skip, and 16% say no. That averages to more than a 75% yes when you take out the skips. 
---
If you only at lvl 50-60 and getting bored best off finding another game imo the grind hasn’t even started
---
It ruined my hecking day, don't understand how people can be so rude and disrespectful.
---
I read it after I spam click the dialogue and accidently hit a "no thank you in busy now" option which doesn't progress me.
---
The amount of times I teled to the next quest spot without realizing the dialogue didn't progress me is enough to make me read it the 2nd time around.
---
Just wait until tomorrow 😏
---

Oof level 99

ignoring that one should not do this, postage for what is he mailing you a letter with the info? lol
---
I mean.... shaking is a pretty natural response to stress or anxiety, regardless of where it comes from
---
Do YOU know anyone that was there that day? No... Didn't think so
---
I set would be so cool. Maybe Varrock, Falador, Ardougne, and somewhere else?
---
please don't associate dungeoneering with rs3. runescape had dungeoneering for over three years before rs3 was released. in fact, next april it'll be an entire decade since dungeoneering came out.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i would like to re-live the 2010-2013 dungeoneering era too, but i have my doubts that the game engine is advanced enough to recreate it\* the way that you remember it, and attempting to do so would take an extremely long time.
---
 \*most notably "bound" items, monsters 'running' (such as Blink in the warped floors), loot appearing to everybody in the dungeon rather than only to the person who did the most damage, and various other things that were only available to the more advanced engine
---
Chu say? 
---
So would I, i'd like stronger links to chambers of xeric. Too bad its a novice f2p.
---
Regardless what tier cape, fire cape is str bonus. The few stab you get from ardy cloak don’t even translate to 1% extra chance to hit, but raising your max hit increases dps overall. Next to no reason to use ardy when you’re already so accurate 
---
fucking sure, it'll give people a reason to kill metallic dragons I guess 
---
How did you find said posting? I would like to know
---
Yeah man magic axe hit is the best xp/hr
---
Shit it's not 2002 is it
---
Gielinor is round and antivenom potions cause autism.  
---
Change my mind.
---
You and about 30,000 other people have it...Who cares.

Had to look up who they were, I don't think I need to be too worried LOL.
---
Why have they posted it at all
---
As long as the stew doesn't lower your stats (all stews have a +/- possiblity) you can keep eating stews until you get the desired boost.
---
As far as resetting your stats, it depends on what you're trying to accomplish. If you can complete your task near the clan wars portal, or get to the required area before the boost is exhausted, using that portal is fine. If you're afraid you may lose the boost before completing desired action, super restores are the way to go
---
Those moments when people trade u instead of lookup and then they log out lol
---
!remindme 2 week
---
Tbh i don’t find the demonic gorilla plugin that useful. Pretty easy to manipulate their attacks for a correct switch and if they switch from melee you just guess whatever you have weakness to then switch if it’s wrong.
---
For example: Gorilla switches from range = run back at switch time and mage mage, if gorilla runs forward pray melee. Repeat pattern for other switches. (Aside from melee to magic/range which was covered above).
---
So how exactly is it cheating?
---
Whats the point of literally anything, using that logic?
---
because she fucking wanted it, that's the point.
---
Sure you think its retarded, but you don't get to decide what other people enjoy doing with their time/money.
---
I have 3 ACC's over 70 fishing (and one at 95) now and lemme say I'd rather do 4 hours of fishing than 1 uninterrupted hour of agility or RC
---
It's hard to consider it cheating when everyone has free and equal access to the features. Sure you could argue certain ones are overpowered, but anyone who wants to use it can.
---
Slayer helm is absolutely not first, and it increases your dps at 2 maybe 3 tasks tops
---
I've got about 4500 unstrung gold amulets from my early crafting/smithing levels that I've left untouched in my bank. I just recently got 80 magic and I see I can now string jewelry. Is that a viable money making/xp training method? 
---
Bearer of the curse.  Seek souls. Larger, more powerful souls. Lest this land swallow you whole... as it has so many others.
---
this was so easyscape when it came out
---
This makes sense... He did drop his ecto's for the quest.
---
didn't know we're 9 gag now
---
Q
---
Fuck pvp LOL
---
Have you tried to yet, its really fun and f2p skill so you don't even have to be a member to level it....
---
On a serious note I found as soon as I got bored or the game I set my sights on zulrah and mort hard diaries. That meant I had a quest/stat goal in mind and chipped away at it. My advice is set yourself a goal or two so you don't burn out quickly from just one long grind. Ideally in your end goal you should see a great benefit, whether that's a QoL upgrade, a way to make bank, a PvP account or access to new content doesn't matter, then just work towards it so you feel accomplished and motivated to get there.
---
May help to break down your goal into smaller tasks/milestones so you see the progress easier. Man Runescape really has set me up for great life lessons.
---
Reddit doesn't have a way to edit image posts. 
---
Kinda odd seeing how you can do it with texts and comments. Oh well.
---
thats why i made fishing contest priority on mine
---
The shape and layout of the buildings should stay the same imo, but adding quests/npcs is fine.
---
oop
---
Really? Well i learnt something today i guess
---
Did you actually copy this post word for word?
---
&gt;If you're actually good at those games killing clueless people doesnt feel fun at all.
---
Completely subjective. Have you ever heard of smurfing in games like CSGO? It's fun to shit all over bad players once in awhile and lots of experienced players do it.
---
&gt;but that's besides the point because those games dont require you to invest currency into killing people anyway. 
---
Dude, no pker is stressing over 10k in supplies, this is the weakest argument I've ever heard.
---
Pretty good xp and very very afk. Loses money tho 
---
He doesn't know because he autoclicked on the cannon.
---
Everyone has free and equal access to wallhacks in shooters. NOT CHEATING! 
---
I just started watching today and I regret it , should have waited 
---
I think it would make playing mobile 100x better. 
---
You have a brain, that’s your puzzle solver.
---
If you’re so poor that you can’t spend 3K for a little rush then I don’t know what to say. Not everyone is interested in efficiencyscape
---
I don't know how this went over so many people's heads.
---
D
---
Fuck classic lets go back to deviousmud
---
Go to the wiki and open one of the quest quick guides. Anytime there is dialogue there will be numbers after the line [like this.](https://i.imgur.com/ZMc1KWH.png) Those tell you what dialogue options you need to choose. You can speed through quest dialogue by spamming spacebar, then whenever you see options pressing the corresponding number on your keyboard. So using the picture as an example you would spam spacebar &gt; press the 1 key &gt; spam spacebar &gt; press the 2 key &gt; spam spacebar &gt; press the 2 key &gt; spam spacebar &gt; press the 2 key and done. Takes a few seconds and you don't have to read any of it.
---
After we get some good craftable mage armours with warding K totally see this being a thing.
---
Uhhh, nah we believe you 
---
I will thanks. 
---
I shook so bad my first attempt I never went back, I use range/mage to kill vorkath and Zulrah so at the end of the day I don’t feel too bad not having a fire cape 
---
'Loot from 10 mins of scrolling on new'
---
Yeah, and yet OP can't be bothered to imbue his helm.
---
Nigga nigga nigga
---
Slayer level is weak, don’t want it.
---
And only a dictionary can do anything about either alternate spelling. Any coworker, boss, subordinate or friend will read it with the thought you might be English at best, and a raised brow at worst. Lingual dialects are constantly ebbing and flowing, no linguist would EVER argue a end-all written in stone """proper""" spelling. 
---
Lmaooooo
---
And an oak short bow
---
Ahh okay lol, that it was at how close the combat level is to a level up
---
Slain good work
---
I've done 500 hard clues and even I've gotten a bit too excited a couple times and opened it in level 40 wild by mistake 
---
And my axe!
---
Do it. You can always use the 78 atk later 
---
Enforcing repetitive content is bad for a skill?
---
Because dungeoneering was so much less repetitive than clicking the same tree/fishing spot/rock for 100 hours. 
---
It’s also as much a skill as slayer was. 
---
You tell me 
---
Same with Karamja only UIM.
---
Best decision of your life?
---
Only one bitching is you man 
---
But the average person doesn’t have time to get to the high level skill requirements or learn the techniques.
---
How long do you think the average, casual player plays a day..? 
---
using RL gives a clear advantage over people using default client. plain and simple. its getting out of hand
---
Like all people

I never said this wasn’t just a ramble, it’s the fact you tried to say ‘oh he has late stage dementia I heard it from a doctor’ - which is just bullshit. Any ‘doctor’ who claimed that is actually at risk of losing their right to practice, because you can’t diagnose someone like that.
---
I don’t like Trump, your particular comment was just stupid and reeked of ‘he’s literally the worst’, combined with the annoying superiority most avid trump haters have.

Downvoted.

living in a democrat ran city?
---
Amazing 
---
A Bandos Godsword is very nice to have for bossing.
---
Sadly :(
---
Because in the pkers mind you could be that one noob who brought his cash stack or huge rune stacks or something silly 
---
It just makes you make fewer mistakes and/or allows you to get the same results as someone else who doesn't use the plugin while paying significantly less attention
---
I'm assuming you're using either Chaeldar or Nieve because it's really scuffed to train Slayer before then. I'd really recommend waiting for Nieve though if you're at Chaeldar because Nieve's task list is A LOT better and the blocks you do for Nieve have a lot more overlap with Duradel than Chaeldar does.
---
In general, the rule is to look up the task list for your Slayer master, sort by highest task weight, then block the highest task weight tasks that you dislike (regardless of how much you actually dislike them). I'm guessing you want some recommendations though:
---
Black Demons - Awful task, made okay if you can do Demonic Gorillas after Monkey Madness 2, but even then the task is kinda bad IMO since you could just do Zulrah or Vorkath instead.
---
Fire Giants - Really versatile block because it's really bad on Konar, Wildy Slayer, Nieve, and Chaeldar, but not really that bad on Duradel because of their low assign weight.
---
Hellhounds - Awful task until you unlock Cerberus, no drops, clues aren't really worth doing unless you have fun with them, high task weight
---
Greater Demons - Really bad unless you do Zamorak GWD, same reasons as Black Demon, high HP pool, long task. Not that bad at lower levels if you Cannon but definitely consider blocking them as you get higher. 
---
I was only pretending to be retarded.
---
*..NANI?!*
---
Do you have rules with yours too?
---
Use me as a bruh button
---
Settle down Blizzard dev.

Wasn't trying to say that it was, just that Exilent really started pushing the limits more than any other well-known client.

I havent played osrs propely for awhile, can someone loop me into what is actually happening here
---
uhh, wouldn't it destroy sang staff's existence?
---
and here's where you tell me that your shitty midwest welfare state is actually good and the only liveable places in the US suck because liberals live there lmfao
---
Just started levelling slayer, and I'm even more addicted now. Didn't realise that was possible.
---
Yes!!! It won't be better xp but I can actually do these activities without clawing my eyes out and jump off a cliff. You can still reward the nutjobs who want to click individually but make it better for those of us normal people
---
Thanks for the highly info response! 
---
You could get magic xp while fishing with arceuus spell book
---
Think it's typically 5000+ hours, depends on efficiency though
---
I found two maxed UIM who did it in 5500~ hours, and I believe Settled maxed his UIM in 7000 hours
---
How do I delete ultimate Ironman accounts that utilize content outside of morytania
---
You forgot to pray against DC
---
Honestly I have some good memories of Penguin Hide &amp; Seek and would love to see it come back despite it not being "kosher" OSRS. There was always a cool social aspect to it and I'd often get into conversations while trying to help trap them. 
---
It wouldn't have to be the same exp rates as it was originally if players are concerned about balance, maybe not much more weekly xp than Tears of Guthix.  
---
Good u r am i!!
---
Are my eyes just fucked or have you unintentionally made some kinda optical illusion ... (Look from left to right on the pic) it's almost like when you look right the whole pic turns a shade more blue O_o
---
Casually ignore him checking his blowpipe in chat haha
---
You can get banned for killing someone in the wildy? Serious question
---
What do you propose? Something farmable by all players who have two or three months of play under their belt, while having unique drops that maintain their value AND are useful/BIS?  All while not being farmed super efficiently by high level players and keeping their value?  I'd love to see a suggestion.
---
It will pass the first two polls at least
---
Not really what I'm looking for, I'm thinking more of the low poly, isometric, no texture worlds. Thanks for the suggestion tho!
---
Wait what?! 
---
Bobby Knuckles plays OSRS? 
---
Yeah. That's not how that works. Every level in a skill means it takes more so to level up again. The first 50 lvl are easy. Up to lvl 50 in one single skill is like 1/10th the total required time for that skill. Maybe like 1/20th. Plus once you get even higher in level you will be able to buy membership due to the value of the resources you can get  at higher levels. That will open up another set of skills and about a million other things to do like member quests and better farming methods. You are like 1/10000 the way through the game. This is why runescape is the best.
---
This
---
To reinterate: YOU CANNOT USE SLAYER HELM WITH VOID. 
---
You need a ranged void helmet for void effect. 
---
Salve amulet DOES NOT STACK with Slayer helm and is larger, so ALWAYS USE A SALVE OVER A SLAYER HELM. The good news is that since you are now using a salve amulet instead of a Slayer helm, you can use void (including the void helmet). 
---
lul shit account nothing of value was lost
---
I honestly like all of these ideas. Sandstorm should have a level requirement comparable to 'humidify'. Perhaps slightly higher, comparable to the damage spell progression of air --&gt; water --&gt; earth --&gt; fire.
---
Hammer to sandstone should scale based on size, comparable to giant seaweed to normal seaweed.
---
Throne of Miscellania should have a toggle option between sand and gems, like it does for herbs and flax.
---
The end of the series will be when he gets the shroud

Its not even been polled yet. We have no way we could even remotely give an accurate estimate. Since its tied to engine work we can assume it wouldn’t take much dev time outside of engine devs so it likely wouldn’t delay any major updates they want to do like elf city or warding, assuming those pass polls.

The engine work also opens up an official clan system which is something they want to do but we’ve not had any solid news on it since the ideas inception apart from a solid “maybe later”
---
Ah yes, the absolute skill it takes to fill a bucket.

Terraria with the calamity mod installed is the only game that managed to take me away from rs for a while. Not sure if it has the graphic style your looking for but hell is it fun.

Turning 80 hours of no xp sand collecting into 40 hours is bad?

I've heard every 7 levels it takes as much as you had before. I.e. getting from 14-21 takes the same as 0-14. Then 21-28 takes the same as 0-21. Etc... 
---
Nice to see Critical Role mentioned :) I definitely agree.
---
its called ironman mode
---
Its actually really easy looking back at it. My method at jad was saying his attacks outloud. 
---
So I was saying Magic, Magic Magic, then if he did a range attacked, started saying range, range, range outloud. I know it sounds stupid, but it worked perfect for me. No missed switches or anything.

Uhh stardew valley. Kinda.

Maybe some divine divinity.

There is a rpg made by adult swim that is really good. The whole UI, and playstyle is like navigating Windows XP. Like file systems for your loot bags, web browser for world map, and popups for bad guys. Don't remember the name. 
---
i set goals do quest etc... but it only gets slower but working towards big and small goals keeps me motivated.  You should try and get all the unlockable easy to get teles.  Thats a decent mage lvl req, getting ardy easy for the cloak, getting ecto phial, fairy ring access.  This is a great mid level account goal that helps you move around the game.  Then start working on combat unlockables.  Proselyte is invaluable for higher lvl slayer task where you dont want to use food. Do diaries, all these things will require you to push skills up to levels to finish quest. 
---
except pkers have been bitching for months?

Yes

I remember diablo 2 being up that alley.

No, seeds are completely random from all birdhouses.

I like the idea of the sandstone being used here. To further add to this we should add in a transportation cart similar to a coal cart upon completion of digsite/fossil island to easily move the sandstone to a bank. I think with these two changes it could be a viable option.

Maxed mains are better than 75/75 for PvP anyway, especially since you probably won't have rigour for a very long time.
---
How's the click order? Herb+tar &gt; fletch &gt; fish spot? Or does making bolts/darts interrupt your actions like the herb does?
---
I didn't call anyone a fool I just said i don't like the fire and don't want it. You pull words and statements from air. I not like that!
---
It’s actual use is only to such a small game population though. They have much bigger issues to fix than a single prayer drain attack on an elite end game item.

Bruh, I have a 401K and that motherfucker ended up -12% for 2018

But that’s not what I called you out on.

Wasn't there a quest or something added to the basement of that building in 2008ish?

If you can afford rapier you can mage all day. Even as an Ironman I have plenty of runes to mage all day. But, mage isn't balanced in pvm and isn't too viable for more things than melee/range are. Also,  what makes it expensive are things like burst/barrage tasks for Slayer and certain bosses who are weak to magic. Burst/barrage Slayer tasks with Slayer helm imbued are some of the best exp in the game along with some of the best defense exp, too. Plus, magic has a certain utility to it that no other skills have. Whether it be enchanting items, teleporting, plank make, etc. But, this is all a matter of opinion and there may be other reasons but I do know for sure magic lacks in most pvm compared to the latter.
---
Got this 2 days ago from a demonic gorilla task, i also forgot to add the magic/yew seeds.
---
Got around 78m profit from that task, is this even normal.
---
Is it okay to share my youtube videos on this subreddit?

There is no way 10% of the playerbase could do DS2. That’s just completely incorrect and baseless.

LOL

Oh, nevermind, looks like she already got banned. Thanks anyway :)
---
You need to look at gp/exp measures. 
---
Magic has multiple profitable training methods such as: humidify, orb charging, tan leather, super glass make, and super plank make.
---
Mage and range can also be leveled using aoe. This allows you to level the skills 3-7x as fast. Player can then use that time saved doing profitable game play. 
---
Tbh, you just sound ignorant. You don’t have a great perception of the economy, efficient leveling, and efficient money making.
---
it does?
---
Yes 
---
Mate only way youre gonna be able to verify this would be showing the loot tracker option if you use runelite. 5 zenytes along with all the rest seems very, very far fetched. Is it possible? Sure. But i highly doubt it unless you show the actual loot tracker or the kills themselves. 
---
What do u mean my guy? Bgloves can only be obtained at Barrows, that's why they're called Barrow gloves
---
No? He recently did the 6 jad challenge he first attempt really casually so he made a runelite plug-in that turned off everything except for an outline of his prayer and the jad attack projectile (he couldn’t even see the jad) and completed it that way. 
---
Enchanting doesn't need automation. What it needs is to not swap back to the spellbook after every fucking enchant, and instead stay on the inventory until you press a cancel button. Think how the explorers ring works when alching.
---
What about gnome ball only ironman 
---
Yeah, undergeared is what OP meant
---
Look on the very right, the inv icon
---
The salt is real
---
Brain: lookup
---
Me: why?
---
Brain: You gotta
---
Make barbarian potions automated. Keep cleaning herbs manual, cleaning herbs can be op click intensive herb exp. Unless it can be turned off, it would make it bad (assuming exp would be significantly slower). 
---
I know exactly how mage works... my question (as post in OP) is based on design decision.
---
I got 18.8m no pet :’)

Woah buddy, dhl is perfectly fine right now. It does not need a buff, twisted bow and blowpipe need nerds
---
Well he’s 8/17 there already, pretty close if you ask me considering the content it unlocks!
---
No i think this is where I realize i'm stupid for having started this pointless ass conversation to begin with and for me to continue this conversation would be even more retarded.
---
Could you explain a bit more? I kind of get it but feel like I'm missing a step
---
I mean we have nerfed versions of all of them, and they're all tradeable. It came out the old school way. Though when you are slotted only so many different weapon types they do come off as the same. 
---
\&gt;:( wtf jagex i bought 10 of these buff them already !!!

Doesn't beat my Tounge &amp; heartbeat controls dragontooth island only ironman build

I know I'll get downvoted for this but I agree with you. I have no idea why this particular series is getting so much fucking attention. New flavor of the month I guess. Makes literally no sense. Woox circlejerk makes MUCH more sense considering that woox is one of the best pvmers in the game 
---
We're all going to experience swampletics withdrawals. Brace yourselves.
---
I saw this and down voted instantly as I assume others may have too. But then I read it. I judged a book by its cover.
---
delet 
---
Or you guys can use the official client. There is no controversy or topic of what is unfair. 3rd party clients help you by making the game easier. 
---
Bloodvelds are usually an easy task. Ive never done in GWD though. You'll want a peice of armour from each god (sara, zammy, guthix, bandos) so you dont get attacked constantly. There is a guide on the tube. I looked one up for spiritual creatures but idk if there is one for velds
---
Bad
---
This needs to be polled! I prefer sir!!
---
That was an instant skip from me.

Wtf? Put it somewhere else. Lumbridge is a sacred town that shall not be tainted.

What?
---
you can either safespot range them or proselyte protect melee they are long tedious tasks
---
Do you know which house it is?
---
bp is ~200gp per shot with adamant darts and shoots twice as fast as Trident, which is 372gp per cast. Per second, it's more expensive to use.
---
Someone needs to do an entraba locked uim
---
Because the community hasn’t cried/made enough noise about it to warrant a buff. 
---
Very obvious joke.
---
You forgot a pretty important step, cannon is not 100% accurate.
---
Take one saradomin dragonhide piece, one for bandos, and one for zamorak. That way nothing in there will attack you if you stay in the centre area with bloodvelds.
---
There's nothing at all difficult about it.
---
This is fake. You loot shows 722 law runes but you can only have 28 items in your inventory.
---
Are you gay?
---
Ironman btw
---
Blue cape Swamplectics best Swamplectics
---
Do you even play the game? Lumbridge is filled with noobs, naturally.
---
You don't need a Guthix item.
---
Well, you do get increased pet chance at 200m exp, seems practical. But in the spirit of what you meant... lol
---
Wtf almost a year between 1 and 2
---
I think if he jumps over to the zammy dungeon (bring Super Restore) you wont have to bring anything but zammy. I believe all the creatures outside of the Zammy GWD room are all zammy. 
---
You could safespot them in south chasm of fire, it’s a long task tho
---
1 spell cast should equal 100000000 buckets of sand

---
Why myth's cape?
---
Yeah same really, and if you like something do it- beauty of RS is any method is "viable" if you care about more than EHP.
---
And yeah it can be hard to drop shit on an iron, fortunately WC/mining both have super viable bank friendly methods (mlm at 30+ and teaks/mahog banking for cons, or even oaks in WC guild)
---
Fishing is similar now that we have minnows (and to a lesser extent karambwan) but personally I value the afk early agi/str over other methods especially since I'll be set for life on food just doing 96-99 at non-barb methods (66k karambwan or 32k sharks at minnows)
---
If you have better than trash slayer you can “splash” for FULL XP on the Kraken boss, just by not waking up any of the tentacles. You have to move the mouse every 4:59 so you don’t log out- or you can wake a single tent up to keep it for 19:59 but you need to eat a piece of food every 15 mins or so, assuming you’re in at least black d’hides
---
The double XP thing fully kicks in at lvl 70. Before that it is less.
---
Why is this an issue?
---
Why is dungeoneering shat on as a skill on this sub but slayer is accepted? 
---
Thats helpful! I havent gwd'd a lot so i dont know much.
---
You don't need that either if killing only bloodvelds.
---
*Wave*
---
Meet Swampletics 
---
Stop using elite void
---
You could spend like 3 hours ranging or maging the things to death, but since you are just starting out slayer, I would suggest going to tureal and just resetting the task and getting a new one. Black demons is a terrible task early on. If you have a cannon and a pipe maybe it gets to the point where its worth it but in your case I would just skip/reset the task.
---
only downside is if you fuckup and click as soon as your overload drops, now you're 41 hp and stuck between either leaving or waiting to get back to 51 hp so you can overload. happened to me a lot even with runelite timers
---
With this logic, why not make alching do the same thing?
---
That's a really good two letter name too that sucks, upvoted so I hope you get some support
---
Or maybe, just maybe, we could release engaging content for mid level players like they did back in the actual day..
---
That way, the no lifers can have their end game content but everyone else can have fun too. Wintertodt is a great example of content done right. I hear Konar is pretty cool too.
---
It's what makes the series so magical. Items that almost everyone would ignore are so precious to him
---
Fair enough. Just was letting him know what specific gear he would need to be protected. As i said never went for bloodvelds there
---
tweet @jagexsupport is your best bet.
---
Before you can make your own digsite pendants you gotta find one by cleaning finds at the Varrock museum and bring it to one of the guys to identify it, and once you do you permanently unlock ability to make them from ruby necklace - but you can't get a duplicate necklace and he had it in the bank the whole time.
---
No fire cape :’(
---
Awesome thank you! It really does suck
---
im lazy because i dont like taks that are annoying and not fun?

Yeah I usually just keep ice gloves in my inv for him and then avoid attacking the one who has two forms and just kill him with the power up.

Damn that sucks man, I would contact support and see what they can do.

# 30% ACCURATE TO THE DRAGON
---
I like the idea of the spell the most. Like others have pointed out, though, I think it should be more similar to spin flax rather than humidify, where it only fills ~5 buckets at a time.
---
Yes but its more of a courtesy thing, "gf" shouldnt be seen as rude at all.. its like someone saying "good game" or match or whatever even if they stomped or got stomped at a game or sport or whatever
---
Aren't dragons naturally resistant to mage? 
---
Your max hit is 42, claws hit for 75% of that if 0-0 first 2 roles so would be able to hit ~32 which should then be reduced by 40% by prayer which should make the max hit 0-0-20-20.
---
Unless some weird shit happens with the reduction.
---
Too many idiots*
---
S
---
Thats odd... maybe the game just cant handle calculating damage reduction twice on the same hit haha.
---
And you'll be wasting that 20m. It's really not all that great 
---
and and
---
You’re trying to tell me that i shouldn’t bring my bank into a pvp zone where i could lose my items? Reported
---
Cause 99% of the community hasn't seen it and don't give a fuck if they have
---
nah just faster
---
The hero we didn't know we needed. Fuckin amazing!
---
What the hell hes a real magician 
---
Thanks! After I mop up the few short quests I have left and get my quest cape I’m gonna get my fire cape 😬
---
actually it says it's only 30% accurate to dragons. So it's actually exceptionally shit towards them!
---
E
---
I have wrist problems and I can't do fast, repetitive clicking. I always choose the slower automated method to avoid it. Definitely support automating more things, as long as its slower I don't think people can complain about it.
---
 
---
If people are against automatic herb cleaning, maybe you can make Zahur clean noted herbs? Currently going for 99 herb on ironman and I would gladly pay to skip cleaning all the herbs.
---
I like the sandstone idea, it gives me a reason to go there, and it makes more sense than a lunar spell. 
---
Personally I'm fine with how sand is at the moment, my only suggestion is to add a left click fill option on the sand pit.
---
Haha, thanks!
---
Me and several people in my clan were talking about how odd it is that the skills are placed randomly (like Hitpoints being the only combat spell in the 2nd column).
---
So thought I'd give a go at sorting the skills. :P
---
theyre bis because they can say the n word
---
I don't think it needs to be a completely separate bank-  but it would be nice to have a place to store *all* the quest items that no longer have any use/little to no use once you're done using them. 
---
Half of them I don't know how to get back and it's a good 200-300 spaces if kept in the normal bank.
---
Definitely this, no matter how much shit people talk about no money from Skilling, it's super helpful to start with that
---
Good point 
---
Dailyscape incoming.
---
I'm un sure of specific clans, but d2jsp has osrs section with clan discussions and there are armed service clans. Goodluck on your search!
---
In the 13ish years that I've been playing rs, never have I wondered _why_ the skills are arranged the way they are in the skills tab. But I can get behind your arrangement everyday of the week &lt;3
---
obv he's gonna buy the cape, you don't ask questions like that if you know what you're doing
---
That's the real debate. It would make content less annoying and more accessible while nerfing the only (or one of very few) profitable herblore training methods. 
---
I don’t know
---
Great advertising campaign for boring, generic content.

kinda like my hydra task today i got 4 claws..

They're in the settings of your bank. You can click/tap "add 10" and it will put 10 in whichever tab you were in

Happy cake day
---
Even though it has graphic altering abilities?
---
{ - Squiggly
---
} - Reverse Squiggly
---
Easy to do and afk but really boring
---
It has functions that swap graphics, is that okay? It does all kinds of things the actual game should be offering, but they don't have the resources to. So a group of fans created something the game isn't capable of executing.
---
  
---
Runelite is necessary
---
I still look them up to see how much of a nerd they are based on their post 99 gains. Max dude in my CC with 114 RC and 112 Mining. NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERD!
---
For reals though this bro can come level my RC and mining instead 
---
Of course it is, I'm not saying that the graphic altering abilities are a BAD thing, just that runescape has previously stated they make it seem like a botting client too the system.
---
If you look at how they're ordered already, it makes sense to me. Like the last column are the resources skills, middle column is buyables/misc and first one is mostly combat. And they're kinda paired together as well (wc/fm, smithing/mining, cooking/fishing). 
---
Use 3rd party all you want, just understand that you’re still cheating. No 3rd party client is more or less unfair.
---
Half the overlays people bitched about with RS3 are in all of these clients.
---
OMG game is becoming too easy jigglyplex.. as player uses 1 million plug-ins
---
What if its photoshopped just trying to get someone banned? I hope jagex actually looks into this and watches for a sale.
---
Let us quick harvest allotment patches without having to spam click the spot to double harvest essentially.
---
If this was the case though, 60% of the entire player base would be banned
---
We have an honestly ridiculous situation where things like this even have to be an issue. A big portion of the community is essentially held hostage by a small one because they think that UI idiosyncrasies are part of skill.
---
Now this is the kind of pandering I come here for 
---
What did you do to 99?
---
Yes, which is why I'm asking whether or not jagex could ban for such things. I couldnt find anything revoking the statement about graphic-altering features seeming like botting, so I was hoping to get some more clarification on here.
---
Osrs banter is truly unmatched

---
Ironscape btw
---
Why not all the options? I see no point in saying 1 only when all are very good methods. It depends on the player on what he or she wants to do.
---
There have been several updates addressing training crafting for ironmen; i.e. giant seaweed &amp; bucket packs. Crafting for ironmen is already at a good spot and no longer needs buffing; the only real grind at this point is collecting sand. To render the sand collecting process moot is a shortsighted perspective and would long-term be harmful to game integrity.
---
i like it. some kinda add-on to a trident of the sea.

I believe I used about 25k scales charging my trident and blowpipe, so in total I would have about 190k

15 dragon bones adds up :D, some clue scroll hunters absolutely have risk and since they take like 20 seconds to kill you might aswell do it.
---
Ultimately it's a pkers job to make the wilderness dangerous, even to those who carry nothing. I fully expect pkers to kill people with no risk, but it takes a lot more to convince pkers to go to a place where they know people have no risk, when they can just go black chins, wilderness altar, revs or even green dragons instead.

Um, you definitely need energy potions for any non rooftop course, I'm not sure what you're doing.

Fken hell this video is fken insane omg the dopamine levels were high af!
---
I love it when this happens, even better when it happens to a pure
---
This meta joke
---
Not everyone cares about money
---
As a player who regularly goes through hot and cold streaks, this series has me playing way too much lately. It's such a unique revitalization for anyone who knows just enough to appreciate it 
---
Yes.
---
Most people who ok are already rich. I wouldn’t pk for money, that’s just not fun.
---
This advertisement team has gone crazy
---
I'd imagine you'd have many more problems than that if you're colorblind

Nice try  swamp guy

You not smart.

Finally some good fucking asmr

“Hey guys so today we’re gonna be doing uh- *squints* hunter i-I think..”
---
That's a leaf bladed sword btw
---
Id guess because back in the days we didnt have place holders. I do the same and i always take all but one when taking coins or runes from bank.
---
Sell your whole bank for it
---
this is the new a friend 
---
Swampletics would destroy all of them lol... he is the only one with access to raid gear
---
Really? That's fked twitch should take it down
---
They're fake streams to steal your account.
---
Change your password ASAP. 
---
Damn wow twitch got me Haha Fuck. If I change my pass should I be good?
---
I'm sad there's no more quests though. I feel like you'll just be grinding stuff now?
---
Not sure if it is a classroom or a prisonಠ_ಠ
---
No thanks. I didn't macro the first one, and really cant be arsed starting over. 
---
Get your construction up to set up your POH. Try to tick off as many hard diaries as you can.
---
I have a question, probably a dumb one but why is the old school engine written in Java and then the content is written in runescript, is it so non coders can make content for the game? If the content was written in Java would we not have the engine work excuse for things that get requested?
---
It’s fine because it’s AFK. This is just making a skill which has been updated recently easier and easier. This whole newspost is a travesty.
---
I guess you just do the best money maker you can, then buy the other skills.
---
Sounds like a fun way to play
---
I think it'll have to be the same thing for me, massive shame because I've been playing on and off for like 13/14 years.
---
Allow Zahur to clean noted herbs for 200gp each - this keeps manual cleaning viable and introduces an extra gold sink. 
---
Allow us to hide spells individually, so that new spells could be added without messing up the muscle memory of veteran PvP'ers/PvM'ers. 
---
Improve Lunar plank making, make it more like String Jewelry, where you hit the spell once and you automatically process your entire inventory. This would (and should) be slower than other ways of making planks, but far more convenient for mobile players. 
---
This ain't it, chief.
---
Zeah only Ironmen exist too. But yeah, justiciar plus rapier would wreck 
---
Dying sucks on a HCIM but I think most of us would rather die to a player in the wilderness than to a random dc or from afking too long
---
No, absolutely not, enough is enough my friends.
---
Agreed, these are all really bad ideas 
---
where can i read about it
---
Makes me wonder if there are any other easter eggs yet to be discovered
---
Got mine at 76 :)
---
Yeah...if only something like that existed....hmm....
---
They do it because people like you get mad when you get pked in the only pk zone in the game.
---
Sandstorm only affects ironman so it should be balanced around the ironman gamemode.
---
Currently you can manually fill buckets of sand and do giant seaweed runs for ~77k/hr or do the higher effort charter ship hopping with superglass make at ~90k/hr at 87+ crafting.
---
If sandstorm spell worked the same as humidify, it would be ~130k/hr at extremely low effort. This devalues ironman crafting and makes it one of the easiest 99s for the gamemode.
---
I suggest the sandstorm spell work link flax spin spell or string amulet spell, instead of filling the whole inventory at once.
---
Alternatively to balance out the high xp/low effort crafting method it could have a high rune cost making it a buyable method, instead of nearly free. I would suggest 5 blood runes 2 astral per cast.
---
Maybe. Change it ASAP.
---
Not when I get black demon tasks every other task and go 800 kills dry a shard
---
Maxing your account requires time, end game PvM requires skill.
---
99
---
Oh I'm never mad, it's just hilarious when I tell them I'm doing a clue and literally have nothing, and they think it's good to get exp off of me or something like they are training their account really good. Real strong players out there
---
The newspost coming out today or by watching their most recent stream.
---
So what was he wearing? Lol.
---
NMZ exists. Mobile exists. 
---
Friendly Reminder that irons are not human and all deserve a swift AGS to the face
---
can we please add a sandpit to the crafting guild instead of sandstorm?
---
make me
---
Is that swampletics
---
Isn’t the game over then? 
---
That’s a good price. 🤔
---
Damn I'd neck myself if I had to play on mobile
---
Literally €9.49
---
Why wouldn’t it be worth it? It takes no time out of my day to cast 3 ice barrages on them to kill them and on 3 different occasions it’s paid off big for me, 2 people accidentally had their cash stack on them and 1 guy was carrying 40k nats and 40k magic long bows. There’s been countless occasions where I’ve accidentally teleported to lava maze for a clue without realising I haven’t banked all my valuables which is why I kill every person I see even if they’re naked.
---
I will be voting no because Ironman mode is supposed to be grindy, and you guys don’t want to grind even though you literally chose the game mode. Crafting has been made so much faster through numerous buffs and is nowhere near as cancer as it once was. I did the charters grind, and it wasn’t that bad, people just need to not be lazy. Buckets of sand are about 2k an hour, and that means you’re effectively getting 3.2k molten glass an hour. That’s insane speeds, and doesn’t need a buff. Seaweed is already a joke now, buckets come in packs, and sand is fast as it is. 
---
And as for these requirements you speak of for gathering sand, idk what you expected from a game mode like Ironman mode. 65 runecrafting on an Ironman isn’t hard. You have weekly ToG, and essence shouldn’t be a problem with konar being a thing. If you can’t deal with one of the few bad grinds left, deiron.
---
Wow, you must be very familiar with physics.
---
but compass is joke right
---
Do the god spells from mage arena have any real use outside of the arena?
---
The idea with a "white list" of 3rd party clients was based on that Jagex could monitor them and the developers could work closer with Jagex when developing new features. They can't keep track of every new client that spawns, but if it's just 1-3 clients they could check so that no disallowed updates are launched (preferably before they're even developed and are still in the idea stage).
---
It's not perfect but it's better than flat out banning all 3rd party clients, which could end up being the only alternative if updates like this keeps launching.
---
he can't do me2, apart from anything else me1 gives 25k(?) hp xp, his only option would be killing them in the catacombs. i think it'd be possible with [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYHVZIQ6y6I) if it still works
---
Just take the system from mobile that cycles through them.
---
I dont always have the supplies to pay the gardeners. Im an ironman, seeds are limited at times. I dont bother paying, id rather just use ultra.
---
Ahh I thought so
---
It's past your bed time
---
If it acts like spin flax and it spins 4 instead of 5, that’s fine. But if it’s like humidify then no fucking way.
---
Ah well it is but..its definitely easier to learn on PC. Way better with a mouse and hotkeys. If its mobile you must use, then might I suggest going for a quest cape if you dont mind quests? Some of them are hilarious. On the other hand if you do have access to a PC or laptop try getting into pking if your not strictly forced with mobile only, it's really fun and I'd suggest that the most if your trying to spice things up out of boredom of the game. You can of course train the account up on mobile if you start a 1 def, but for the actual pking I'd say use a PC or laptop
---
Gf bank
---
so what? My faith in saradomin does not affect my identification as a 3cb BTW
---
Played ya self iiiiidiot
---
Make the humidify spell toggle to sandstorm like changing destinations from varrock center to the Grand exchange.
---
ah I knew I forgot something important lol, thanks for letting me know
---
yea i cant do mep2 cos mep1 gives hp exp, i can only kill in cata and you cant use cannon int here so was wondering if there was any other way of killing them that i cant think of, but i think i will have to just recoil them down and do 1 damage with mlb spec
---
There is no motivation, the game forces me to play
---
Are there any secrets to getting the defenders? I got bronze and used it on the npc. Then killed Cyclops for hours and hours and got an iron. Is it just bad luck? 
---
Jagex shouldn’t make updates because you choose to limit yourself smh
---
Rainbow boots.
---
Why not a staff to make it equal to melee and range instead of making it a pile of dung like thammarons sceptre ?
---
People have, and always are going to make macros and bots, it makes no difference if you ban RuneLite; except if you do everyone will be forced to use the Jagex client which is awful. 
---
Google the challenge, the npc will come up
---
Possible spoilers ahead: Maybe trying to hide that he got 70 defence for dharoks helm, the construction for repair stand, and fixed helm.
---
Isnt there a mechanic that he has to be past 30 wild to lose them?
---
Its 20, he's in 24. 
---
Guy got gmauled? Ok
---
The game has come a long way and im surprised it still exists, the WoW thing though has less to do with Runescape and more to do with Blizzard somehow overdoing it when they tried to see if they could manage an expansion thats simultaneously worse than Warlords and Cataclysm, the game got gutted to its core. Doesnt mean OSRS hasnt been doing great, its just also benefitting from another company taking a dump on their own products. 
---
The digging holes to bury stuff row is my favourite 
---
Clue Gang™ does *not* approve this message 
---
I don't think anyone is denouncing them, we just hype settled the most 🤔
---
Didn't know about that, cheers for the link.
---
He is quite clearly an ironman you uncultured swine.
---
There can be more fun/engaging ways to do things it doesn't mean it needs to be significantly faster than the current methods. If there was a method for collecting sand that was extremely fun but it was slower than collecting sand like it is now then it'd be okay IMO. That's balance. Making it stupid fast isn't balanced.
---
The spell would need balancing. One cast for a full inventory would be too fast. 9 per cast seems about right to me, 3 actions per inventory. Still way too fast.
---
Sandstone seems the most fair, it comes in 1,2,5 and 10 blocks. 1kg = 3 buckets of sand. It would be relatively fast to acquire the materials for 50k buckets of sand. 
---
I personally would then say it needs another process to convert them to buckets of sand. Considering it takes quite a while to obtain the necessary giant seaweed.
---
50k buckets of sand takes around 45 hours and assuming the average spore yields 20 giant seaweed per harvest that's 40 per 40 minutes which is 1 giant seaweed per minute. One giant seaweed yields 6 parts for the molten glass.
---
That's 50,000 / 6 = 8333 minutes which is 138 hours of waiting to harvest seaweed.
---
I know people like to quest and do other things in these hours but is 45 hours really that bad? You could collect all your sand from day one of starting the crafting grind and everytime you harvest your seaweed you have around 280 molten glass to blow. 
---
Aiming for item x or lvl y. Sometimes taking breaks if I dont enjoy the game or want to play or do something else. 
---
Tier 80/99 gear is already in the game. Tbow/blowpipe. Just falsely advertised under the 75 tag. Blowpipe with rigour and addy darts is stronger than chaotic rapier+overloads+turmoil combined. 
---
Could you consider adding an automation option for planting tree/fruit tree seeds in plant pots? As it stands it’s not a huge issue, but it would be QoL for something that’s unnecessarily click intensive (especially for giving no experience). 
---
How do you have 4 eyes but 2 hearts? Is it not supposed to work the same as totem drops in kourend, where you won't get the same piece until you get the other two? 
---
Or dont add ironman only qol updates in the game. 
---
The never even noticed this was a bad design I always thought I was just stupidly forgetting where th btns were each time. 
---
Why it is already good balanced.
---
Looks like your at a hospital 
---
He's gotta get 70 range with regular arrows too. My guess is he's gonna Fletch some until karil.
---
Or we could make sand buyable from either motherlode mine or volcanic mine
---
I also voted no, because it wasnt needed.. I dont think the game needs to be made more convinient every month, we are closing in on rs2 ez-scape by the day..
---
Everything becoming afkable and for longer.. I think we need to go in another direction, making it more interactive instead of less.. 
---
It was just a suggestion to [this] (http://services.runescape.com/m=news/feedback-suggestions?oldschool=1#_ga=2.79218324.1247534354.1549479337-1590077624.1537289953)
---
You're a mad man. How many hours would you say it takes to get 99 in OSRS? Considering the grind eventually. 
---
Planks drop from an event in temple trekking
---
Did you even read the news article? This is a counter proposition to what they're proposing, not the current crafting method. I share the same view that sandstorm in how they've propositioned it is too easy. Hell, even 5 at a time, similar to flax, would be too easy. 
---
Aren't PvMers clue hunters? 
---
Really really into this series right now. Such great content.
---
I don't know how Volcanic Mine works, but how much sand per nugget would MLM offer, to make it worth it compared to gems?
---
Depends on the 99 nut for mw i just did it over a few months of casually doing nothing but fishing
---
If you're that desperate for sand, you can do it too?
---
wow ty, didnt notice that at all mate :o
---
Hand in the sand part II quest to unlock the ability to blast sandstone with a spell to produce sand maybe? But to be honest I play as an ironman and I don't mind collecting sand. Besides there's plenty of ways to train crafting. I don't think a change is needed.

So he’s going to attempt tob with.... veracs? Lol. 
---
Liar
---
Charters and other shop man-mode is not better than what is being suggested tho.. The problem with sand is that it is a nmz product for normal accounts, thus they dont see the problem..
---
Sandstorm seems broken, agree with that. But giving you the ability to get it from misc wouldnt be half bad, even with the elite diary gathering sand just feels pointless.. Its Kinda like picking flax, mining essence or mining volcanic ash.. 
---
What world was he in?

Pkers need to dowmvote everything none pvp related until something changes, or jagex needs to make people take a test before voting to make sure they know what the fuck they are actually voting about

i dont like the zeah graphics either.

At my school they taught us if you pick on a disabled kid, you must be disabled. That happened after one of the tards tried swiping stuff from my backpack while I was walking and I did a leg trip. For some reason I was the only person that found it perfectly reasonable to trip him for that.
---
Cata is only option. Even then, cata is multi so you'll probably need another acc to lure the others away.

He might get 65fletch for yewshortbow which is lime +20accuracy over willow

ofc he does not.

---
As for automation processes, sure if it's significantly slower than manually doing it. Why automate cleaning herbs though? Zahur in Nardah cleans your herbs instantly if you cba to clean them yourself and provides a decent goldsink. Automated herb cleaning to me just seems redundant.
---
Ahh okay makes sense 
---
Could it be my cash? 
---
How's hunter? I've been playing for about 2 months (85 combat) hunter is the only skill I haven't even touched yet. Hell 8 even have 40 rc. Just thought hunter seemed tedious and boring maybe I'm wrong ^^ 
---
Haha thanks for the positive vibes
---
The fun part is that the dude probably died because he didn't want to risk as an HCIM, which means he died because he didn't bring the stuff he'd need not to die.
---
i guess its true when they say you cant just quit rs. 
---
Yep. My other attempts were a while ago tbf. 
---
I think that is the issues. All I see are people playing the most efficient way and it ruins it for me. What happened to just playing the game for fun
---
lol i head the sand casino is a no no
---
Curious, how much did the jar sell for? Or iron meme?
---
I still have no clue which is which.
---
That is interesting! 
---
I'm at 1k kc and have 2 rings no leather 1 tail. Feels bad
---
Whoever commented in this thread before me, you're shadow banned fyi.
---
who gives a fuck
---
Yeah one simply just does not quit rs
---
? Source on that? Completely depends on profession if I had to guess. For example the field I was to go into, healthcare, has by far the highest paying average in the world. Canada (which is what I was researching its comparison to at the time) is significantly below it.
---
I feel like the game is always calling me to play now that its on mobile
---
Buckets of sand in NMZ shop do no matter, as mains do not use it and Ironmen can't access.
---
Can anyone explain whats going on? Think I missed something
---
Make sandstone smashable with a hammer, turn it into 3-8 stackable sandstone dust, use 5 on bucket for a bucket of sand
---
In surprised you've got to this point in your life without using the casual word for girlfriend. Bird.

Well, obviously, just a thought/joke my guy!

Yeah I saw this but I wanted to check is that applied to all Wildy or is it’s simply just 20+ you lose it as you keep your fire cape below 20 so wasn’t sure if that was he case for a slayer helmet and in 20+ is when it drops and converted to a black mask

That can be learned over time

Adding konar keys even though it didn't pass in the poll? What?

I agree with you, It's nothing special just another area only iron man.

Ahk and other cheating stuff like clients with auto tab when high chance of dying and auto eats, etc are strong in that community

Yeah you missed that it didn't fail?
---
It passed with a 77.4% rate. 
---
49,064 votes for, 14,306 against and 5,467 skipped.
---
Noted the website will show that it failed because it is written shittly and counts skipped votes as part of the total. 
---
Then u would know how much xp u get dont you. Or ask the sellers.
---
Do Konar's keys replace the existing drops or are they an additional incentive?
---
Hell yeah evil trees
---
exactly 50 firemaking. my guess is that he entered wintertodt and immediately knew he had to get rid of his account to make sure he never went there again 
---
it did pass though?
---
Definitely needed to poll the change to lumbridge. Adding a new pub and npcs to such an iconic area was not part of the X Marks the Spot question or mandate. 
---
Got it at 51 from a herb run :)

How upset r u

Ahhh thank you I had no idea

imagine tryna force zeah on ppl by adding a new quest cx

I was thinking more along the lines of a single cast that granted between 50 and 100 xp and cost a couple nats/astrals. You can alch about 1000 things per hour, this would be substantially slower. This absolutely should not be a meta mage training method.
---
Also- don't strawman me. I'm here for discussion

imagine adding a f2p quest to get f2p noobs to buy membership to visit zeah cx
---
Use her, then alch her.
---
Think of it like this, do you not go and buy groceries on the basis that they might have a sale on the next day/week/month? The only time to worry is if you are simply buying an item to use for a small period of time, but then you can even track the price you bought at and just hold onto until it rises to the same/profit. 
---
Smithing (if doing dart tips or something like that), fishing,  woodcutting, potentially mining if you have the upper level in mlm. All are nice IMO cause you can start it, go to a different app for a minute or two at a time 
---
Lmao what's this loser rambling about?
---
Dammn, nice. You are right. Thanks :)
---
Oh fuck, I’m such an idiot
---
I’ve never felt so sick watching someone play on a MacBook 
---
Enchant jewelery, plank make, tan leather spells (maybe there are more spells like this)
---
Just do the quests then? They're easy and much better to get around zeah with 
---
They only made it a skill because it required so much dev time that they couldn't justify it without calling it a "new skill". (It was worked on for something like 2 years) It never was intended to be a skill, it never was a skill, and never should be a skill.
---
**Skills**
---
Combat: allow you to be more effective in PvM/PvP combat. Trained by engaging in combat, often most efficiently trained in medium level content, most rewarding in high level
---
Gathering: allows you to harvest increasingly valuable resources from certain locations /nodes in the world. Trained by gathering raw materials, most efficiently trained in medium level content, most rewarding from high level content
---
Production: allows you to manufacture increasingly valuable raw materials into increasingly useful finished equipment / items. Trained by creating items from raw materials. Most efficiently trained using medium-high level content / whatever is affordable. Rewards tend to be untradable, or profitable production is niche and gives very little exp. (This difference from the norm in training/reward system is due to exp in these skills being "buyable")
---
Support: Give various time-saving / conveinience / profitable benefits to other game activities, trained most efficiently in medium-high level content. The rewards of the skill are the point of training the skill. The most rewarding content is the higher level content.
---
All of the above: are trained in different ways at different levels, in different areas of the game world. Can largely be trained at maximum efficiency solo. The most rewarding combat content does require other players, but the vast majority of bosses can be soloed as well.
---
**Dungeoneering**
---
Allows you to buy rewards from a rewards shop. Trained most efficiently **and** rewardingly by rushing low level content (but never being able to stop doing it all together) and then spending more time on high level content. Always trained in this same way at all level ranges. Always trained in Daemonheim, a purpose-built area not only physically separate from the entirety of the rest of the game world, but with a different set on items and "rules of the world" from the rest of the game too. Grouping up with other players is required for remotely efficient training.
---
Blah bleh bloo blee blah 
---
Exactly. It’s too OP as is. If you could get your servant to get a few items at a time from the bank though, that might be nice...make the travel time a lot longer than construction resources takes. And maybe 20k to use every time. It has to be slower than using the jewelry box to teleport to the bank.
---
It doesn't suck. Its multiple different loot drops that stack in an inventory space that give an incentive to return to the Slayer master that work alongside previous 'special key' mechanics while removing the 'supply drop' DMM/private server-y mechanic.

I want to agree but the Hosidius range needs to be fixed first. It's bugged so that the first thing you cook burns and the rest including other inventories won't burn. I had a &lt;1% burn rate on sharks and karambwans from like 70 cooking, without even bothering to use the cooking gauntlets.

True that. Thanks for the help :) Appreciate it.

Alch yourself, then nothing can hurt you.

Yeah seems pointless to add the pub in where they did removing the house, when they could quite easily have added it slightly further north and kept both.

Add why add a port to Draynor, when you could have just reworked port sarim - again, makes no sense.

Imagine not polling an aesthetic change to the starting city of this game
---
ur a pker shut up
---
Okay so with todays update they removed the locking feature of the Zeah houses, so you wont lose favor in a house for doing tasks or such in another. Nice timing amirite
---
Sick update. The move to Draynor with the boat makes it easier to get to (Glory) and it's nice for an empty house to become slightly useful. 
---
Hopefully the change to a pub is non intrusive tho.
---
Don't be silly I'm not a high enough level.
---
He talked to him before he came to morytania the first time, it's in the description of episode. 1.

LOOL, imaging catching dwarves :p

---
You can easily add a larger interface with runelite btw.
---
Your argument isn't great anyway, even if the interface is big it's still janky. It was just a nice way of making things easier to navigate.
---
I miss serene's pale boypussy :/
---
Yep, now it's a fucking ball ache.
---
Keep.
---
&gt; Bloodvelds - Same as Greater Demons, okay XP early on, but gets to be a really bad task as you unlock Dust Devils, definitely worth blocking.
---
My man. 
---
Was fixed with kebos
---
Suggestion : Add a search bar to the quest list
---
Sandstorm spell makes sense. We already have glass make, plank make, bake pies, tan leather, humidify and so on...
---
The spell is only going to benefit ironmen, so, as usual we know why a large group of people don't want it. 
---
I saw them get somebody their name back just last month I belive.
---
Omnigender pansexual autistic feminist ham sandwich** 
---
\&gt; You just get introduced to the new unnecessary dock in Draynor Village  which no one had asked for, when there was a perfect Port Sarim dock  next to it.
---
Totally agree.
---
People who think absolutely everything should be polled.
---
To be fair, it was pretty cool in the beginning - Back when it was only a few people doing them, primarily the Zeah Only guy (it's been awhile forgot his name, something like EvanAndrew - too lazy to search), Caveman Only, Verf's Karamja UIM, and perhaps a few others. I do enjoy Settled's series, but his recent explosion in popularity has caused everyone and their uncle to create 'snowflake' accounts, most of which are just poorly thought out bandwagoners. The market is getting over saturated and it's no longer unique or that interesting anymore. Just my opinion.
---
WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT RANDOM HOUSES AND DOCKS YOU BRAINLET
---
More engaging than weekly discussions for most shows!
---
Smurfs are generally considered bad in most games that have them. That's why games try to prevent people from doing it. 
---
Since when? Jw because I always thought they did
---
Probably a bug.
---
Castle War kids think it's "depth".
---
He begged for his life, pathetic 
---
The keys are the private serverish feature, that a hellhound got a rune plate or 3 from misc adventurers seems a lot more reasonable than konar going around spreading out keys for you to find..
---
&lt;3 I don't even play osrs and this series keeps me coming back.
---
Yeah I hate having 5x the playerbase. They're clearly doing something terribly wrong.
---
Get the fucking cape then you melt
---
It’s a short quest for F2P players. It’s like Sheep Shearer or Cooks Assistant. It’s not supposed to be anything big. Grant it, I would have preferred they didn’t add that dock near Draynor just for this 5 minute long quest
---
“Ruined”. Ha. Who cares?
---
Seriously, Priff is going to be huge for that acc.
---
yes
---
You some kind of autist?
---
Considering you don't have to put any work into the seaweed anymore, isn't collecting sand fine as it is..?
---
The sandstorm spell is a cool idea, but will be too generous.
---
That uses way more runes and costs more in the long run. It also takes up one extra inventory slot.
---
These changes are like turd sprinkles on a perfect birthday cake.
---
In bad taste no matter how you slice it.
---
!remind me 1 week
---
Chinese Overlords are selling Jagex, I doubt they give a fuck anymore
---
So what you’re getting at here is you basically want spin flax, but with sand? If I’m right in assuming what you want, that’s stupid. Rn bucket of sand collecting is 2.5k at most if you basically don’t miss any time. Spin flax is 5K an hour, but it does have more intensity. So you’re looking at a minimum of a 100% increase in the speed of which they gather it, that’s absurd.
---
I'll never understand the Oldschool team. They do so much great work but every now and then they do something that is so mind-numbingly stupid you just can't believe it. 
---
I love the thought of automating these slow methods. Please do not forget about volcanic ash tho.
---
Did I miss something?
---
The keys actually make more sense than every mob just randomly dishing out additional drops. The new keys at least tie the Konar loot slightly to Mount Karuulm.
---
Haha I’ve definitely heard that throughout the years. But 3g rhymes :/
---
The pub is fine. The draynor change is hideous.
---
can you do gargs off task in the upper level floors?
---
The docks at Draynor looks odd and out of place imo but I really don't mind the pub. That old shack didn't add much imo. 
---
I'd say stuff like this probably should've been polled since there is varying opinions about it. 
---
I'll admit that it hasn't ruined my game play experience today. 
---
holy shit this community is so ridiculous sometimes lmao
---
Fuck u on about?
---
I can’t with you.
---
Thats because it wasnt added to any new drop tables or such, picking flax and mining ess was also profitable before they were added. I expect volc ash to be added to someplace soon :(
---
&gt; this is literally just a grind to reward you with ANOTHER GRIND.
---
Yeah that’s basically the whole game.
---
You will. Get it mate
---
Was this all just an elaborate RHH flex?
---
10k?
---
Been a lot of streamers moaning about auto prayer flicking and shit, and the owner or device said something about taking it down or closed sourcing it (I have no idea what it means) hoping somebody can tell me 
---
All of the mains with ardy elite bring in 84 per day. It may not seem like much, but it definitely adds up. And when you consider the fact that sand isn’t necessarily the most sought after item, that amount we get daily is fine. Plus, no one buys sand from nmz lmao.
---
I would kill any HCIM, so status doesn't get devalued
---
Suggestion: Make a suggestion about the suggestion.
---
Doing skills fast consistently and maxing skills in a macroefficient order significantly cut down the time to max and are skillful.
---
That wasn’t the runelite client though, it’s some pvp client
---
Who is this man in a blue cape? I do not recognize him...
---
Remember your anti-potion potions 
---
yh lol
---
which side are they protesting for?
---
im bitter about that ugly 48 defence op has
---
!remindme 2h
---
agreed
---
There is a reason giant seaweed isnt free tho, some normies do make glass, and some blow it as well. Without NMZ sand would definatly be worth more than it is currently, which will affect those players, on good or bad.
---
Funny enough, this was also one of the locations for player mod meetings (after they changed it from on top of port sarim jail).
---
Sorry but how does it actually benefit purrs? And of what type?
---
Are you sure mods aren't sloppy and misclicking?
---
A few months ago (over a year ago?) Spammers in CCs were a constant, by-the-minute bother. I've gotten 24 hour bans twice from different CCs because the ranks were sloppy and misclicked my name.
---
Sorry man, I wrote that at 5 am while tired as fuck. Probably shouldn’t be on Reddit that late, my bad.
---
If you make the sandstorm spell like the humidify spell, then yes i'm all for that update.
---
Is it worth it to use Konar now as a 77cmb? I'm interested in the droptable even though it's been nerfed.
---
&gt; Hmm and why is that? Because they’re a longer grind, leading to a stronger sense of accomplishment. So instead of just sucking it up and playing the mode you voluntarily chose to play, you want to make it easier. Not following that logic. 
---
Highly subjective. Being self-sufficient is what makes ironman great for me, doing painfully stupid grinds like DWH isn't enjoyable in the slightest. I'm not even arguing for making the game easier, that's a complete strawman. All I said was that ironmen have a right to updates as much as any other account. Personally I feel like crafting is in a fine spot, and there's zero need for easier buckets of sand.
---
&gt; It has nothing to do with affecting mains, it’s about the fact that Ironman is supposed to be a challenging game mode
---
Can you back this claim up in any way? The only "official" information that you can find about ironman talks about how it's self-sufficient and stands alone, nothing about the mode purposefully being more challenging. 
---
You can also more easily PK regular players collecting dragon bones, and more easily kill anyone who has a full TB and is trying to tank it out at green dragons.
---
Oh I didn't know that, but then the whole third party client thing comes into play again, I just want my bank tags man.
---
Id say determination is a skill.
---
well not they can have a pint while they meet. 
---
Who cares? Its not like ur there post 10h playtime
---
You mean like how RS3 can display virtual levels? Hmmm OS isn't osrs anymore boys
---
I hear that bro. I upgraded from 1920x1080 to a 2650x1440 a few days ago and man my inventory and icons were INSANELY tiny. What I had to do was turn on 'Scaling mode' or w.e its called, just search scaling in runelite. I also had to mess around with it for a few days to get it right. I don't think its 100% perfect because it seems a little bit blurry but its way better than it was.
---
Cheers 
---
Imagine doing Kraken for a shitty pet which everyone has in 2019 LUL.
---
Yes but there is a reward  behind that to progress your account that has actually engaging content. This is not engaging, this is not rewarding, it gives absolutely no value during that grind. The way to make grinds worthwhile feel good is to make it one of the two.
---
Yeah me too dude... I hope they don’t ruin runelite. I’m sure it’ll be okay though, most people playing use it and they’ll go crazy if that happened
---
one the pub was one thing but that dock looks terrible 
---
May god bless your heavenly soul, ty
---
OP is a player that lives in GE or POH when not doing high level pvm stuff, and posts about "lumbridge and draynor getting ruined" lmao the entitlement... The poll passed for a reason, and the pub blends well, you suck OP
---
How t f would a hellhound get arune plate, they're dogs
---
Awesome!  I'm glad you got it done :D
---
Now get out there and do Legends Quest!
---
I think it looks fine. You're used to Draynor looking the way it did without it, which is fine, and now you'll get used to the way it looks with it. Not like this is some game breaking change. It's literally a port.
---
If only a non-terrible was possible 
---
Fuck get it out of here
---
Was this polled?
---
I'm doing Gem rocks in Shilo Village underground mine when I'm not at my PC, the xp is ok, not very afk but the money is great
---
An NPC house that I bet most of the population had never even set foot in or acknowledged? Give me a break. 
---
Yes master wand is worth it as it can auto cast ancients. Your going to want to get it for late game might as well get the early mage levels for it. 
---
The fuck are you all on about? There's nothing wrong with this.
---
It means he know exactly what his right hand looks like. 
---
Invest in me
---
Yeah what so you think holiday items are lol.
---
The thing that makes osrs cool is how things fit together in a logical way. Throwing a dock in Draynor to make a quest slightly easier? Pshaw. I don't usually care about changes/updates to the game, but this doesn't feel right. I get a very bad feeling about this; I know the intent is to appeal to the lower attention span of mobile gamers (make the dock easier to find), but surely there's a better solution than this.
---
Honest question, how much time do you spend in Lumbridge whenever you are online? 
---
These series are all so interesting, but the end game restrictions are pretty big, ToB beats everything.
---
Hey asshole my HCIM was region locked to that "random" house
---
What does OSRS have over WoW? I’ll tell you one thing it doesn’t have over WOW - Activision Blizzard. 
---
All you need to know.  
---
Acceptance of something doesn't change the result. Even if they are willling to take him doesn't change the fact that he is leeching off their good gear to complete the raid. Unless everyone in that raid chooses to gear like him and then do TOB, otherwise he is still leeching.
---
Does anybody have tips for rebuilding with no money?
---
Yay!!!
---
I think your solution is better, 𝒥𝒶𝓂𝓅𝒽𝓁𝑒𝓍 plz fix
---
If you peel back the bark you’ll see a nice vibrant core 
---
Oh boy wait until they have to do one small favor. 
---
lorem ipsum sparks more joy than rampant latex errors
---
If you don't care about the pub, whatever. I don't like when they change existing parts of Runescape that way but it's not a huge deal. 
---
This though, this is a complete eyesore. And for what? Anyone with an IQ high enough to start playing the game shouldn't have trouble finding Veos in Port Sarim. Come on.
---
Get a fucking grip.
---
I remember I came back to rs in that time and was so so confused, it was something to do with killing a dragon - one of their weirdest decisions ever
---
Or they could rework the docks so that it's a lot more obvious which is which. To this day I still have no idea which is which.
---
Maybe dead to you. Don't diss the OG's, they defined the grind before most of us knew how to kill Hill Giants. 
---
Why would you bring any damage or xp into this extremely simple calculation?
---
Make it a fishing platform but you need 4 combat to use it
---
Yea, game developers that have proved time and again (historically and recently) that they cannot be trusted to create updates with the long term health of the game in mind. This is why we have polls, no matter how small the change may be.
---
I'm just angry they had to demolish my favourite house to build their pub.
---
So unnecessary.
---
You are doing the lord's work.
---
Teaching people in shit gear is nothing new. Neither is popular people having an easier time. Neither of these are new concepts. I have absolutely helped people with stuff despite not knowing them and them having shit gear. There's more fun to the game than just strictly doing things efficiently.
---
It be not the team, I'd assume. Just one intern perhaps that has access. I hope.
---
Support, but only if the cannon accelerates the sand to near-light speed, causing an explosion when the grains hit a monster.
---
I don’t think you know what a major aesthetic change is.
---
move that fucking boat
---
It took time to develop the skill, duh!! 
---
You are getting experience during all of that, even the smallest exp can do a lot in terms of the psychology, lots of those are also A LOT more engaging than what we see for collecting sand. So yeah, i dont consider your argument all that valid. 
---
get that shit out of here dude the pub too fuck that shit so hard just PUT VEOS IN THE HOUSE ITS NOW VEOS' HOUSE WHY IS IT THAT HARD
---
Yeah, at least she could have been the bartender.
---
Or just FIX LUMBRIDGE back to its historic form, Jagex!
---
Would anybody be willing to teach me how to do bandos? I have infernal cape and some decent gear but I just can’t stand soloing gwd bosses 
---
Tbh the PvM community is even worse, people are very elitist in PvM and they flame much harder at say raids or if someone is crashing/being crashed compared to PvP where the most ull get is some shitty "toxic" message when u get killed
---
Technically a glory can be infinite if you're willing to recharge it
---
Its ok bro we all go thru shit homie the most important part though is that you can get through these moments without permanent damage bro. Keep safe I will check up on u 
---
Filling Sand buckets is 0 xp, agility is just slow.
---
Any pvm clans I could join? 
---
I've just done the quest and no way is it worth the changes. Like you cant be changing to massively iconic locations for such a bland quest
---
Imagine playing a 10 year old clicking simulator.
---
&gt;major
---
The fanbase is mental
---
You're not just wrong, you're also an asshole. 
---
Tick manipulation and other timing based things in this game actually requires skill and time to learn
---
its a connecting flight (707) to the sarim ship (the 747)
---
Now it's dark and dinghy. 
---
have you seen draynor
---
Or you want to see what your fishing goal is while you’re fishing. 
---
I’ve been following this since the initial commits, and I’m glad it made it into this weeks release. As somebody who has a number of friends who are new(er) to the game, these features, especially ability to ping tiles, is going to be a great tool to help teach raids and other bosses. 
---
Good thing this was polled, right guys?
---
Personally I’m more impressed he has 100% lovakengj
---
Wait this isn't the good drama calendar template that other geezer made up 
---
Hey! You stole my meemee 😡
---
What? Why?
---
So it hasn't changed much then?
---
agreed. dock is great it needed to me moved. but they should move it south.
---
So much this. 
---
People just want something to bitch about in life,  nothing new. 
---
The lack or trigger discipline is disturbing.
---
But caller plugin was too op and had to be removed 
---
I don’t care?.. lol. Some of you people I swear. 
---
Do you have a medium clue in your bank?
---
WAIT.. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, RS3?
---
OMW

1 yellow duck in Falador park: massive riots, removed, mod apologized.
---
2 big-ass changes to MOST NOSTALGIC AREAS of the game: ???
---
Newscape
---
&gt;Regardless of if you care about these changes brought about today, it should be concerning that such changes which were in no way balance/game integrity related were added without a poll.
---
I am in no way concerned about Jagex turning useless buildings into pubs or adding a tiny dock to a village. 
---
&gt; big ass-changes
---

---
^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)
---
Definitely have a med clue in your bank already. No way you went THAT dry
---
I do think that there should be something to differentiate Veos from all of the other ships in Port Sarim, to be honest. I've gotten lost trying to find his ship quite a few times. 
---
Every mom is a grind fest it's how well the end game is developed 
---
I don't think it's that hard to gather sand as an ironman, not even all that slow. Move house to yanille. The xp gained from this type of crafting is fair for the time and work input, the only issue with it previously was the soda ash and seaweed when there were far fewer worlds. They gave another option for the seaweed and I think overall the method is balanced where it is now. If the spell is introduced, it should have decently high rune cost.

Ik ga die natte boypussy dichtkitten met mijn vlezige kitspuit
---
77% in game poll
---
Sometimes you need a day or two off osrs to realize what you should next time you play. 
---
We have polls to satitate the unbelievable levels of entitlement in a huge amount of the playerbase
---
Oh god why
---
Doesnt make any sense, why not add a new dock to the existing one in port sarim?
---
You get a key instead of the regular loot now.
---
You take the key to Konar quo Maten, and behind her is a chest where you will use the key in exchange for a regular loot drop.
---
Of course this should be passed and not other stuff like Letting Pures back on Ape Atoll.
---
I do, therefore your statement is incorrect
---
If you were truly sorry you would delete your comment
---
jagex: eh fuck it
---
If only... but where would a place like that be?
---
Ok
---
Actually it's more like having to kill all the chicken for the feathers to get to 99 fishing and someone telling you to de-iron because you "don't like the grind." 
---
Is this your favorite line or something lol... you’ve said it twice already lmfao
---
Nice work! Plastic print im assuming? Slightly nervous about those little triangular bits on the pommel since they’re connected at a very small point.  Only asking because I’m an architecture student and I’ve had my fair share of models break by making connections too small!
---
Is taking ten attempts really that bad lol? I thought that was like standard.
---
There’s already a shortcut literally 10 tiles away... if this isn’t an easyscape suggestion, I don’t know what is. 
---
Move the dock closer to the wall separating draynor, pub should be somewhere else in lumbridge such as near Fred’s farm. 
---
Guarantee I would rank you 100/100 times cuz you’re too big of a brainlet to spellbook swap for tb. Would. Chirp your 2-7 business day 4 way switches the whole way down too scrub 
---
Because they both need to get a grip, it’s the simplest way to put it
---
I've seen private servers with better design choices.

Unpopular opinion:
---
I couldn't care less than the dock is now here.
---
I'm f2p. I don't have that many places I can go, but I really treasure what I have. That cozy little house was one of my favorite places in-game. Now I can never go back :(
---
do we know an excact drop rate already? the wiki says rare
---
&gt;  1% chance to roll onto Konar's droptable for only an extra 60k or so.
---
Try between 50-500k with an average round 300k or so in my experience. Some tasks you'll get one, but I've had a task with 4 that brought me about 1.3 mil.
---
Rip man this is terrible news :( message me in game if you need someone to speak to brother 
---
Bro dont harrass someone for it he was emotional and you straight up took advantage of him 
---
In order for this game to be more about fun and less about perfect ticks the XP rates need to be increased. 
---
In order to get my agility from 60-76 is going to take like 20 hours at seers with Camelot TP. That's 20 hours of me not having fun so i can start doing some content (Zulrah and i want the lava dragon shortcut to PK)
---
Entitlement by paying for a game and not wanting them to take it in the same direction that they previously did? 
---
For the record, I don't care about the changes to Lumby or Draynor. I care more about the precedent that actions like this sets, which then allows them to start bringing in other changes because they simply want to.
---
????I think it looks good. Why does reddit bandwagon hate on every decent update
---
Seaweed/filling sand is almost as fast so there you go
---
They could just put a closet in that house that takes you to an underground bar and for the dock, move it to the rest of them or halfway between draynor and wizards tower.
---
Hence why I stated it
---
I agree the pub is fine, it really doesnt change the feel of lumbridge, and that house wasnt very iconic.
---
But this totally alters the feel of draynor willow coast, which is one of my favorite locations in the game.
---
I know its a nostalgia bias, but Ive heard that the OSRS team used to take VERY seriously any alterations to old locations, Im a little concerned with how much this alters just the overall vibe of the place. 
---
Maybe im just being overly nostalgic but at least poll this change.
---
Yeah everyone is freaking out. It’s no big deal in my opinion 
---
that easy, problem solved big guy.
---
Same tbh, it just seemed like an unnecessary addition and didn't offer anything significant. New players don't need to know about Zeah right away, this is kinda similar to when they made Burthrope f2p in RS3 to give new players a taste of p2p.
---
When I was a noob I got enough of a taste just looking at the world map and that left me wanting more
---
New pub in Lumbridge and new dock in Draynor for a new f2p quest
---
Thanks man :) You have the same username in-game, I'm assuming?
---
He destroys what you don't need- he doesn't store them for you.  I'm not looking to get rid of them, I want them, but it shouldn't clog up a third of my bank.
---
Lasagna would have been a bit funnier tbh. Update the pasta for next use. 
---
All of this negative over-reaction to very very very very very small changes is insane.  I've been playing rs for almost 16 years and I've probably never set foot in that house.  Everyone is crying about these updates "ruining" Lumbridge and Draynor... Get a grip folks.  These graphical changes have absolutely no impact on the game whatsoever except making Veos easier to find for the newest of noobs.
---
lol sandcrabs, git gud
---
Okay, bet those people use clients sooo.
---
Wasting time takes skill
---
You paid 20$ for dragon slayer 2?
---
It seems a bit odd for a small village to harbour the only boat that takes you to a different continent. 
---
Casting self-alchemy
---
It's OK my friends, there is no reason to be upset.
---
Making this crafting method unrealistic for low-level irons is one of my goals of making this method balanced.
---
Otherwise crafting is just a free 99 you rush at the beginning of ironman mode as soon as you get superglass make.
---
I agree that this is not the most ideal solution.
---
Not even close to hard.
---
3 years to make, what u playing RS on? A cabbage??
---
Or he's right and you are reacting pretty strongly to the most minor of changes.
---
Poll location change frogsex 
---
Its a lamp....
---
I actually am fully okay with this
---
He was, you’re right. I guess they did it to de-clutter Port Sarim, but extending the docks would fix that.
---
Move Veos to Varrock's pub and remove the town changes please and thanks
---
all good, if someone wants to show off that they achieved something with little to no effort that’s fine
---
Gotcha. Just saw there was an update
---
Veos looks absolutely ridiculous.
---
I do like the name of the pub, "The Sheared Ram". It fits nicely, Fred.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Sheared_Ram
---
So she can hide it from her parents.
---
Change it then. On bacon reader you can have nicely sized TNs or full on TNs.
---
New sand collecting method The Ballast Station. Merchant ships heading up the river to the Grand Exchange need to fill help up with ballast as they offload cargo. Help Captain Garufo and his assistant Beauregard fill ships with sandstone and he will award players with excess buckets of sand upon completion of his journey. Simply mine sandstone and place it in the storage crates to help out. 
---
Garufo will deposit 10 buckets of sand per sandstone mined 
---
Upon collecting 30,000 buckets of sand in this way Garufo will reward players with an ancient scroll he found left on one of his ships. Reading this scroll will unlock the sandstorm spell which will be a toggle for humidify (similar to how some teleports have 2 options) thus requiring dream mentor and not requiring a spellbook reorder.
---
Sandstorm will fill all empty buckets with sand for 2 astral, 10 air, and 1 sandstone
---
Faster sand collection but requires some work to unlock the spell and uses skills to make the process feel more worthwhile. I was thinking sand from Garufo should be approx. 4k buckets per hour so it would take around 8 hours to unlock the faster method which would still require mining for ironmen.
---
Monsters are people too!
---
Reeeeeeeeeee
---
what i mean was: using slayer helm with (per example) full karils and anguish instead of full void but i see its better use full void, tyvm!
---
It kind of bugs me that he calls every upgrade bis. It's not bis even for his own locked account perameters. 
---
My thoughts exactly 
---
Great suggestion 
---
Lying ass ; 
---
Yea I agree with that, very odd... but  the tourism and traffic are going to revitalize the draynor economy.
---
I do. It might not mean much to you, but as a f2p player that discovered the game a year ago, that cozy little house was one of my favorite places in-game. Now I can never go back :(
---
Also happens in fremennik isles quest, where you need like 10 yak hides and logs or so and the king is like: why would you just happen to carry exactly those items
---
To be fair, you signed yourself up for the challenge.
---
I mean it’s for a f2p, beginner quest so that’s not really a viable option.
---
It's not overlooked, this very thing is suggested 20 million times per year. They just never did anything about it for some unknown reason.
---
Probably something retarded like a bank teller saying the n-word. Now they want him to be fire and they want compensation for their hurt feelings.
---
is it better to use Dragon crossbow (not hunter) or blowpipe with addy darts?
---
Yeah I'm dumb. It was sherlock.

It's a fucking boat. Is everyone in here serious? I didn't even notice it until this post.
---
Normie account for added nostalgia 
---
I think you have a point that no one *should* care about a change like this, however, no one *should* want to play a Java based browser game from the early 2000's in 2019. 
---
I believe it's a core aspect of OSRS for myself and others who played the game as kids to be able to return to the older parts of the world and feel a sense of nostalgia. That's why this change is bothersome to many of us and should be polled. 
---
It’s not even tin foil with jagex. We’re talking about a company that’s been insided twice in its teams short existence. A company that polls inane shit and then not this. 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
drop ofc but what has that got to do with anything
---
Y’all are hating on this location and yes, it is not ideal. But I for one, am extremely happy that I don’t have to run all the way to port sarim on my noob account just to get to zeah. It was such a pain in the ass. FYI I got house in zeah now, but before I got 25 construction that was a horrible run. 
---
I get that but then this stuff becomes rampant and ruins 1v1 in the community. 
---
I believe he is genuinely excited when he gets a black boots drop or anything else that’s only good in this series. A lot of people have over the top reactions, but Settled is having genuine fun playing this account.
---
So I assume that you do all the raids perfectly every boss you prayer flick everything and you have an inferno cape
---
Yes... yes you can go back. It’s just remodeled... 
---
His current dock at Port Sarim is so hidden away it's a wonder anyone can ever find him.
---
If you weren't there for Zeah's release I honestly wonder how you even hear about Zeah existing, let alone getting there.
---
There’s a couple of free cozy houses in West Ardy waiting for you once you purchase your first bond. Very sanitary and the people are so sick to be around! Lmk I’ll hook you up with a rental out there.

What the fuck
---
Pretty obvious that it was either going to be bucket packs or sandstorm spell. And bucket packs won out.
---
I also disagree with the spell entirely. They e already made crafting far far easier than it was
---
Nice. 
---
I like it, definitely wasn’t ruined.
---
If this is your idea of comedy, I suggest you take a look at the old British comedy series "Are you Being Served?", specifically the comments made by the character Mrs Slocombe. Her comments should be just what you're looking for

Show us the screenshots then

On my last few invents of blowing 21k molten glass into orbs (I think 63-77 crafting).
---
Charters weren't bad, I never had to deal with logout timers on mobile. Did them on a 4-hour road-trip there and back as well as casual gathering now and then.
---
Collecting seaweed spores from lobstrosts was annoying but doable. Half of my seaweed plants kept dying but giant seaweed was overall painless. 
---
Collecting the sand was okay too, albeit boring.
---
Turning the sand and seaweed/ash/giant seaweed into molten glass was my favorite part - nice and quick.
---
The blowing of molten glass into orbs has me dying though. I don't know if it's the fact that I had to spend hours gathering the materials, then turning the materials into other materials, and *then* blowing the materials into a new material, but holy shit please end my suffering.

All you can do now is live your best life and role-play as a bar.

Well that escalated quickly

Starting a HCIM and planning to do wintertodt til at least 90, is 10h optimal or I've heard some people say a tiny bit more?
---
94 cb here, got mine on my third couple weeks ago. Pretty sure I missed a flick, but tanked the shot so Lord Jad and the Jagex gods must have felt forgiving
---
I'm quitting, this is the last straw. My life is completely ruined and I have lost the will to live. That house in Lumbridge was the best thing in my life and now it's gone and with it my purpose in life.
---
I just want to be able to have a pint with the lads in lumbridge
---
You mean runescape classic? 🤔
---
Lmao I have played since 2009 and I like it. Get your head out of your ass.
---
this post is the big dumb
---
&gt; fuck new players, fuck alts, and fuck casuals, rip it all out 
---
because they added a dock... lol.
---
The first place you end up on after tutorial island IS the most iconic location. Idiot.
---
The RuneScape wave is so cute man, I love it
---
It depends on what stats you would consider the baseline tbh then i'd be able to give you a more precise time frame.
---
Underrated comment right here. This new dock / new quest isn't "natural exploration", but more like (as I said in another comment) forced exploration
---

400 gold to recharge everything, don't even have to sell and rebuy
---
Yeah I was digging around and couldn't find anything. Sounds plausible though.
---
I understand that, but what I’m saying is that is it heavily noted and should be removed for that reason. Make it harder to obtain and hence rewards players for it than just sitting in NMZ.
---
He missed the blessed d’hide pk vs pvm bullshit
---
True. Not really sure why scales went so high all the sudden either. 
---
What are you trying to day lol? That's it's *not* there? 
---
But it shouldn't be a quest baiting new players into purchasing membership, right? I know that Jagex is corporation and they're intending to make money, but that just feels like a really disgusting thing to do
---
At least allow us to sit at the bar, have a beer, and talk about all the newbies running around.

Dilemma of changing my zerker to a main, hby?

Zulrah has been better than vorkath for a while now

Yeah mb. I didn't specify the client because I wasn't sure. 
---
3rd party clients don't "offer" these plugins, they're made by developers under the hood. There's nothing jagex can do about it but add a way to detect it and ban the people using it. Get a brain, moron.
---
Oh you're right. Sorry.
---
I’ll miss this beautiful house
---
Serpentine helm got a buff earlier.
---
Wait is this already there? When did this get voted in?
---
Looks a lot like it lol 
---
no im saying skill and time aren't independent of each other. one can acquire skill by dedicating time to practice.
---
everyone downvoting me is struggling to swallow the point of this post
---
uh well ss has a crush stance too, and it can be upgraded to a blessed version too (I can't think of any more positives)
---
Just a completely irrelevant reference to Dr. Disrespect. I assume he brought it up because you said "shroud", but it was still super forced.
---
lol I'm not asking them to, calm down.  Just think storage that isn't *completely open* is more appropriate- could be anything, a second set of "stashes" for clues, more armour sets, etc.  Quest items just seemed especially useless and cluttery to fit the PoH feel
---
PvP community always crying about everything and want it done instantly, that purespam guy wants it done and wants it done NOW, it doesn't matter that there's thousands upon thousands of bots being created / ran every single day and the anti cheating team consists of like 4 or  5 people.  
---
Never understand people like that who want things to change immediately so impatient.
---
For heavy ballista you need mm2 though. There was also mention of being able to do ds2 for accumulator upgrade. 
---
Go p2p and make your own cozy little house
---
There is literally no downside to a nice quest being added to the game. Any quest is a good quest.
---
many people would minigame tele to pest control then walk to veos
---
This is an idea I dropped somewhere else in the thread: Just move Redbeard Frank into the bar with every other pirate and commandeer his spot for Veos? It moves the ship closest to Draynor while still in Port Sarim, it's out in the open, that ship isn't used for anything, and it adds value to the agility shortcut.
---
It doesn't change the map, it just moves 2 NPCs, It helps unclutter Port Sarim, and it makes both Veos and his boat prominent features.
---
Unpopular opinion: I like the new pub. Just gotta add it to the bar crawl quest.
---
Why add another dock to crowded Port sarim, when we can put it in the neighboring town
---
It looks like you're getting pretty defensive over this, if you can't handle people having a different opinion maybe a game which should allow you to vote for changes isn't a good fit for you 
---
yeah those keys sound real fun
---
" this is a small change but many small changes will lead to the death of osrs "
---
this is 1 out of many more changes to come, if the community dosnt react then map will be changed drastically in upcomming years
---
The upgrade is t75 and has 10,000 charges before you need another ss? Crush stance has an even lower accuracy bonus again? Thats what im saying, there arent any more, attack style gets whip at 70 att, str gets the big tickler.
---
Devalues my cabbage patch only ironman 
---
Not when it feels like a promotion for membership mixed with a feel of forced exploration of content that a new player can't even access until they've purchased membership.

But why 50k though? That’s insane for ironmen, that makes one of the most important skills a decently fast one. Best skills should be hardest to level.

Well butter my arse and call me toast haha. Well you have a loyal follower spreading your good word :L
---
You’re a gold farmer. Your opinion doesn’t matter.
---
The amount of lighting effects make it look way too busy
---
Well, that's the reward of the quest, locking favour
---
They removed it as a reward, making the quest not have one.
---
So they added a new reward
---
I thought Konar Keys, Dragonfire protection at Drake's, and poison protection at hydras didn't pass the poll? Why were they added any way
---
I just grabbed it from rs3 wiki. 
---
Gf account
---
Truth. Died a few months back just shy of the top 5k rank on my hc, onto the next one. Happy to die to a player while trying to achieve something dangerous then to losing connect while bossing
---
Assuming that People play without the wiki open.
---
Both communities are toxic as fuck. Why do you go to wildy to do a clue? Because you think of the juicy loot you might get. Now try to use that same logic on a pker roaming around when he suddenly sees some guy running around in the wildy without any protection. Don't do anything in the wildy or a pvp world with the expectation that no one will try to kill you...

These are all places where magic is quite relevant. If you'd like me to explain the relevance for magic in any of those areas lmk.
---
I think you need few more pubs there
---
Oh my, a typo. How incomprehensible my sentence became. Better leave this to the comouter team of FBI to decrypt. 
---
I know it isn't a massive thing. But it still didn't pass. It is also a bit interesting how people get mad at changing some house in lumbridge, but something like this is completely swept under a rug.
---
Both good ideas
---
Its BiS at the moment, i dont see anything wrong with that lol
---
Doesn't matter if the current order makes sense or not. It's always been that way, and people are used to it now. Changing it would just be inconvenient.
---
Nobody will think "I'm wasting more time trying to find the skill I'm looking for, but OH MY GOD, I LOVE THIS ORDER, IT TOTALLY MAKES SENSE NOW. SO MUCH BETTER THAN BEFORE."
---
Really devalues my pub only ultimate iron man. 
---
Are you salty for your 40agi?
---
5% tops is from non-sand, maybe its enough when you are 40 crafting like you
---
Woah! Its Mad Achies birthday today! Happy mad birthday!
---
I don't think many people are saying its ruined, they're saying it looks like shit and needs to go....
---
Just like rc runs
---
yeah but since when have they juts stopped polling shit. I feel like there's a really clear change in the process over the last 12months.
---
Also a reminder that RL has a prayer reordering plugin, which didn't pass the official poll. But something like this is front page worthy... Lmao.
---
They could have put veos in draynor as NPC that quick travels to his boat, that is in Port sarim. 
---
What the fuck is this? More map photoshopping?
---
True true, but if it's a debate about dscim+def vs sara sword then the crush style is a decent +, albeit that isn't that great but that's why it's a secondary style. But in the end not having a secondary is what kills the ss the most.
---
Runelite gives the players what they want, and it doesn't cost Jagex anything.  They'd much rather have an open-source program imo than they'd hire a team to work on their official client to add Runelite features.
---
That tree is flexing
---
Obviously, you're not a golfer.
---
For you. 
---
ITS. A. DOCK.
---
^chill
---
I feel the nostalgia excuse is outdated... this game has been out for like.. what 5 years, and almost no old nostalgic training methods are viable anymore. 
---
Yo what the fuck is this?? This looks awful. Jages please revert these incredibly nostalgic areas. 
---
What's the problem? it's the wildy. Sure it is the lowest form of pking, but it is a fun sport to kill defenseless people in the wild or pvp world. 
---
Linking ur own vid trying to be relevant, holy cringe.
---
I will always and forever upvote Bobby Knuckles + OSRS

Because it's a port?

that's literally next to this new dock lol

Are you fucking serious they put that abomination in  Draynor??

Holy shit this looks like such a great feature for the We Do Raids Discord since now the coaches can ping the tiles for people :0

Why did you have 51m cash on you lol?

Good god... He's back...

Hi and welcome to my guide
---
And that's why unlocking the teleport is such a big reward. The very first thing I ever did on Zeah was to revive the fairy ring.
---
I understood what you wrote, I just don't believe it for a damn second. You couldn't even get to the end of your comment without raging about toxic PvPers, lol.
---
Adding roe/caviar to two dose potions for barb Herblore, please!

Bro, regular d hide has the exact same stats, and has always been available to pures (bar the +1 prayer).

From my own pvm experience (mass kicking at ffa raids, scamming, crashing), I genuinely can't tell the difference.

RIP old school

Too many weebs

Unpopular opinion but I respect your bravery

You mean like it was in 2013 when the game almost completely died out? No ty, sounds good on paper but isn’t good idea 
---
Le gnome kek’d

Still a shit task.
---
Thanks. Wasn't too hard was it?
---
What's up
---
   
---
   With the shitpost
---
Can't wait till we get the next edition for March
---
I just got one, what is this key for? Did they remove the konar drop table?
---
Oh fuck off. Quit screaming "MAH NOSTALGIA" when jagex updates something like this. Lumby is iconic from the castle. Not the one building with two people that most likely no one ever went into and if you had roofs toggled off, never even noticed.
---
I wasn't there for zeah's release and i found it just fine. a lot of stuff in this game is very hidden and obscure, thats nothing new
---
Explain!
---
How's it disgusting? Jagex wants people to be members and this teases a piece of membership content. No more disgusting than being able to see Taverley on F2P worlds and wishing you could know what's on the other side like I used to back in the day. 
---
If it gets more people to get mems OSRS makes more money and it lasts longer. :)
---
It makes draynor more lively. Even though they could of done with something like a small fishing boat or something. We need a mini game in draynor
---
All 3 passed with over 75%, you need to remove the votes to skip question, then calculate the percentages off the remaining votes.

Oh no!

Not fishcakez!

I literally lost 6 fingers typing this. Am in the hospital now. They've offered a merciful euthanization.

went for the Pewdiepie YLYL g fuel joke
---
Increasing player count suggests im not the only one who thinks that. 
---
Yup sure thing... can you direct me to the nearest grip store?
---
I think this sounds like the best of both worlds. jamflex pls
---
Yeah I should of clarified. I was meaning the lumby change when talking about dead content. Granted it wasn't really content. Just a building. 
---
I don't understand why they changed Draynor but doesn't bother me either.
---
Just quit if it bothers you. Jagex finally taking liberty of their game and not letting this circle jerk subreddit control the direction.
---
Problem is 3rd party clients are a far better experience than the native client, some push it too far true, but until the vanilla client offers even basic features like GPU rendering, these issues will crop up.

All would have made way more sense....

Where will the line be drawn between marking tiles for lets say a PVM fight and having tiles highlighted automatically for where you can freeze from and get get frozen in return? Should being able to highlight tiles at all be allowed?

I'm not pretending anything. You can tell by looking at the numbers.

Tell me one other poll that failed by a margin of 30-70. If you point me to one I'll genuinely concede to you.

Swap the willows and the patch
---
That's not how abstaining works. 
---
people on the autism spectrum do not have an easy time understanding satire/sarcasm, particularly over the internet. they also have a high chance of playing OSRS
---
Or you could not extend it further because it's already too long
---
With a price of like 50g per brick, maybe even more
---
And theres a quest you can only finish by going down into the dungeon. 
---
That's not how any votes in this game were ever calculated
---
Pretty much the best RS Youtube series since One Man Army.
---
Also replace the Corsair Cove, Entrana, Musa Point and Crandor ships with submarines in order to be able to get past the docks. Requires 95 sailing.
---
Maybe i’m looking into this too much, but my guess is more psychological:
---
-	Do a novice quest in Lumbridge that brings you to Draynor; or just head to the best/iconic willow spot for F2P
---
-	Notice a dock to a place you can only enter as a Member
---
-	Now that dock adds as a reminder of how limited you are as F2P and the “whole new continent” you can explore as a member
---

---
Yes, honestly BiS gear isn't THAT big of a deal as long as you can afford some goodies. The biggest thing is being able to afford supplies, since unless you're a god it's going to take multiple attempts so you can expect to spend 20m+ in runes/pots/etc...
---
SGS, Kodai, range gear (including rigour). Ancestral is nice for the damage boost, but mage accuracy is a null point. Mage is used to freeze + kill the nibblers (Which have negative range defense, so accuracy doesn't matter really) and to heal back up with blood spells. You should only use blood spells to heal when things are under control (You should never try to tank and outheal with blood spells), so again accuracy doesn't really matter. Your range gear on the other hand is very important, since it's what you'll be killing Zuk, the Jads, etc. so it's definitely worth maxing your range gear before mage. Dragon darts help a lot, but aren't really worth it until you've gotten to the point that you can at least reach the Jads... So start with addy or rune to practice with then swap to dragon when you feel like you've gotten the hang of things.
---
Justiciar isn't really worth it (except for the helm). If you're planning on doing hundreds or even thousands of attempts until the RNG gods give you a cape then sure, but other than that you're better off taking extra brews/restores rather than justiciar swap.
---
Also, a few tips:  
---
1) You should be able to make it to waves 50+ before touching your brews/restores. Blood barrage will heal you back up after you get spawns under control, and until you're getting mage + range in the same spawn you really shouldn't be taking much damage at all... Plus, the more supplies you can bring into jads/zuk the better. Don't get me wrong, when you're first learning the inferno it's better to run out of potions just so you can learn the higher waves, but don't get into the habit of relying on your brews before wave 50 or you're going to have to pull off some impressive pray flicking during Zuk mage/range spawns.
---
2) Don't wait on SGS specs, at least while learning. Really you shouldn't have to at all, but you're going to burn yourself out fast if you spend 3+ hours on each attempt. Just sip your potions and accept that run as part of the learning curve.
---
3) Adjust your brew/restore ratio to your needs, not what's recommended. If you're great at flicking/ticking prayers and don't need to use restores during the waves, bring fewer restores and more brews. If you're not so great at ticking prayers and need to use restores during the waves, bring more restores. Just keep in mind that the less brews you bring, the more likely you are to either run out or be stuck in a scenario where you have to swap between range and mage prayer while running the Zuk shield and attacking the mage/ranger. 
---

Do you know the definition of abstaining? If you abstain, your vote doesn’t matter.
---
lemme get that
---
I love when I lose my cape personally
---
I believe I do but I will have to double check when I get home. 
---
It should be made of much darker planks to fit the more grim feel of Draynor. Right now it sticks out like a sore thumb
---
I’m not, they shouldn’t have done it but saying it’s fucking disgusting is just a huge overreaction
---
1.5m for 2k more xp/h permanently? Sign me up anytime. Hell i'd prolly pay 10m for 1k xp/h increase. Also, if you cant fund using prayer, start flicking. If you can, stop bitching about it.
---
They did what any sane dev would do, and this gives new players a heads up to where zeah is and promotes getting membership for the game. Coming back to the game from a long hiatus, I had no idea how the fuck to get to zeah or why it is was in the most out of the way dock in port sarim. Devs want to promote the new content they’ve been working on not hide it in obscurity 
---
Agreed.
---
I agree it absolutely should not be allowed. However, in your statement you distinguish 'over others', in reference to the PvP-abused nature. You do however, also mean this to be against the rules in PvM as well, correct? Jad? The Inferno? Demonic Gorillas? Etc? 
---
Oh gosh that’s right! I used the max guild GE the most before I quit. It is true that OSRS definitely has had its fair share of interesting or OP updates, I think for any RS2 into RS3 player that OSRS is definitely a “downgrade” on easy xp for most skills however. A lot of my friends say they are worried that eventually the old school game will update too much and turn into the new game, but I was always confused by that. It’s clear that OSRS is in fact now a NEW GAME. As an old player who actually did play in 2006-2007 the Kebos lowlands, Kourend, and fossil island  have been the most confusing for me to get used to. It’s definitely old school, but it’s not as old school as people lead on.   
---
It’s not a big deal stop crying.
---
u/Rothenn yo
---
Lmao.
---
There was already a quest start map icon for Client of Kourend. That's what map icons are for. To identify where on the map things are. Are they going to introduce a feature where Haitus holds your hand and escorts you to Varrock next?
---
Same customers that only vote yes to things that benefit them
---
It is still Old School; it just isn't 2007 and it hasn't been for a long time. The game doesn't really market itself as a 2007 copy of RS anymore, just that it started from that and continued to build its own direction with the community.
---
People cry nostalgia, but I hear no crying over the Grand Exchange still existing.
---
I’m saying the method for rc that most people use currently is the abyss, and up until level 91 you only get 15K-20K xp per hour. I haven’t done the math, but I’m willing to bet that standing right next to the law altar, never having to bank, and having ess literally brought to you would be way more xp per hour than abyss rcing.
---
That is not what abstaining means at all. Abstains are not yes. Abstains are not no. Abstains are not garbage ballots. Abstains are abstains, that is it's own category. 
---
What if someone is crying about the dock?
---
The tribesmen on Karamja absolutely terrified me as a kid, would shit myself if I got poisoned because I didn't know about anti-poison.
---
A good chunk of the playerbase don't even walk past that location, none of you would notice a thing had they not mentioned it in the post.
---
I don’t really agree. It is true that more players is a positive, but think about what is popular in art/music. Most of it is awful. But that’s not to say popular things suck, it’s just that more people spending money doesn’t equate to quality. Also I’m pretty sure a lot of players are “new” and were brought back for mobile, give it another couple months and I bet the player count is going to drop a little. It also seems Jagex is having major problems recently engaging with the community, which might further escalate that. 
---
But my point is .. what’s happening to my precious runescape :( this isn’t a legacy game anymore.
---
60k d scim vs 1.5m sara sword, we arent talking about maxed accounts, im talking about the value by % upgraded. Its not worth it to buy over waiting for bludgeon, its also not about what I can and can't afford you child, go have a shitty day
---
OSRS is a private server ran by Jagex, I don't know why people are upset

Oh I'm sure people spite vote in general. I'm talking about that specific poll. I voted no on things like the entangle question. Not out of spite but because it benefits what I think is fun. I don't want to make it easier for people to kill me when I'm doing pvm or clues.
---
My favorite are the people trying to use logic as to how the boat wouldn't be able to sail from that spot. It's a fucking videogame where you slay monsters and use magic.
---
I gave my point already. A majority don't think killing someone who can't fight back is fun. That's why we see games try to combat the ability to smurf. Dead by daylight will punish people proven to derank, dark souls has added level and weapon matchmaking, in league of legends you just get matched against other smurfs within 3-5 games. It's toxic behavior that people are trying to get rid of.
---
someone on forums suggested letting the humidify spell clean dirty herbs, another idea i had was you can use dirty herbs on sinks around the world and clean them there
---
The dock I can understand, but I don’t understand the outcry over changing a completely useless building into one that has a purpose. I don’t think that needs to be polled tbh
---
Ofc it wouldn't have. Mystic in 2019? lmao
---
they only added that to soften the blow of the negative feedback Konar's loot table was receiving. 
---
havent played in 3-4 weeks, gonna go ahead and login for my RC exp. 
---
It's only unrealistic because jagex added methods to easily obtain feathers. Lol. Which is exactly what this whole thing is about. It's the same thing. What's the difference between killing 30,000 chicken for 100k feathers and buying 100k buckets then filling them with 100k sand for crafting? 
---
It is bad. It's poor worldbuilding that wasn't necessary to accomplish the goal of directing new players to Zeah. Should have just kept Veos in Port Sarim and have a villager in Draynor that starts the quest by directing you to him.
---
Thank you Will Smith

Someone hasn’t done garden of tranquility

"And you call it that, despite the fact that it's a re-purposed house?"
---
That scam is literally being spammed all day every day in most worlds at the GE, pest control, castle wars (sometimes) and other hot spots. You definitely saw it before, maybe not paid attention but there’s no way you can’t have seen it. 
---
Also go do security stronghold. Never enter your password anywhere other than the runescape homepage. 
---
That includes following links, if you didn’t go there yourself intentionally then you’re not meant to be there.

Nevermind it's in the Dragon slayer page in the trivia section

---
setting a new hurdle, a new bank value,  a new killcount,  a new pet, finishing a boss, pking accounts.
---
&gt;If the majority thought smurfing was fine then we wouldn't see punishment or outrage over it. It's a safe assumption that people don't like it.
---
People who are getting smurfed on don't like it. 
---
&gt;You can make wilderness pking toxic by doing something like camping a spot you know someone wants to get to. Killing someone who drops nothing and then waiting for when they come back would definitely be toxic. That's something I could see a smurf type player doing. Their fun is in ruining other players' fun.
---
Good lord I'm honestly done here, you're pulling out random arguments that have NOTHING to do with what we're talking about. I hope I see you in the wilderness.
---
This is what like 95% of update feedback posts look like to those of us that aren't autistic teenagers. 
---
Magnets.

Tbh at their current price these are still a hidden gem. Hydra bones are still way undervalued at 5.5-6k. The cutoff for being "too late" will be around 7.2-7.5k. Even at 7k, these are easily the best gp/xp bone for those looking for something faster than dragon but not quite as fast as superiors. Use Dagannoth bones as an example - 437 xp per bone @ gilded and they're currently trading at 8,750gp. Hydra bones reward 385 xp @ gilded after the update. Wait until you see the prices within the next couple weeks as YouTube guides get released.
---
you bet your fucking butt i haven't
---
Tithe farm tele works pretty well for that. 
---
By not going sicko mode 
---
Not lower, just less likely, defence doesnt work like that in OS, defence only affects chance to block the attack and take 0 damage, a hit will hit a random number between 0 and the attack’s max hit, defence has no factor in damage dealt on successful hit
---
Seriously though. Hit me right in the feels.
---
how ayiza gunna complain bout it, he was in position of being able to change it when he was a jmod but did nothing lmao cx

This ruins my nostolgia! Get rid of the purple skin and slayer helm asap!

And I agree with you. Played since 2005, lumby and draynor are probably some of the least visited of all places on the map. Everyone will get over it

---
That's not the fucking point. Not everything needs to have a use. The game isn't just a bank and vorkath and the Ge. It's a fucking role playing game. There are supposed to be random houses and shit so that the illusion is there that this is an alive world and people actually live in it. 
---
Yeah im sure they knew evolution of combat was gonna be a homerun
---
To answer your question, a range tank would be far more diverse than a zerker since you can more easily do all the content in the game, except for maybe ToB. A lot of the content can be done at max efficiency as well since you can have 99 range, def, rigour, and maxed gear.
---
A good alternative would be a 75 atk/99 str/75 def/99 mage/99 range build with 70/74/77 prayer, which can actually do all content relatively well, including ToB.
---
Beating 6 jads takes some basic skill, but it's more about understanding the game mechanics than anything else. 
---
This community never ceases to amaze me with the endless amount of things they can complain about, get a grip.
---
Emoticon checks out with name
---
not really sure why people are complaining about lumbridge at all, after the starting the game and leaving i almost never went there unless its for a quest. I think RFD is the most iconic thing lumbridge is known for but it mostly takes place in one room.
---
so out of my hundreds/thousands of hours playing i was probably there for a few hours total.
---
and as an older player why would you even be using the boat to get to zeah in the first place?
---
herb patch feels out of place tbh
---
unpopular opinion: this is just a minor change and doesn't really matter.. When was the last time any of you even went to Draynor?
---
hes 99 str and 99 magic 
---
While you're at it, you may as well add trading for ironman mode too. I can't understand how so many people choose to play ironman and then cry that it takes too long to do something. That's literally the point.
---
i'm just pointing out how comparing yourself to a smurf makes you look bad
---
passes
---
What? that's how it worked. The people training rc don't have to keep walking back, and the people running get free law runes.
---
The dock looks so out of place 
---
Who gives a flip. do you often go to draynor for your willow cutting needs? I didn't think so 
---
Thank God I can finally let people know I'm an FBI agent through text with the tap of a single button
---
If it really was, then you wouldn't be spending it playing osrs
---
this is actually a great idea and fits so much better. 
---
The only one I think may step over the line is the barrows one, but really that saves maybe 5 seconds of looking.
---
There were truly overpowered plugins that made the game too easy, but they have been banned and removed. 
---
no, because im not addicted to cocain
---
Then look out your fucking window. 
---
wow you guys really are autists
---
Polling ruined this game, I’m glad to see them add something without consulting the community. They’re actually game developers, unlike the people that come on here to cry about how they need something to benefit whatever niche activity they do 
---
Im at work at the moment and I cant tell if this is a prank or not just because I would never expect this to actually happen.
---
Ha you really dont know where this is heading
---
What a terrible idea.
---
We the community told them we want more quests, this is part of a quest. you can't have your cake and eat it too. 
---
MM2 and its not even close.
---
fuck that maze nonsense.

That doesn't make any sense. Muslims born in the West aren't as violent as refugees from war-torn Syria. I think you've got your facts wrong.
---
Sweet let me just start printing this monster... see you in 16 days 
---
It's Newscape now mothafucka
---
Pretty bumpin 
---
This is a good idea, which means they won't use it lol...
---
dude 25m is plenty for glories. you could buy like 10 glories(6) at once and it wouldn't make a fucking DEEEEEEENT. you'd only lose like 50k by selling them back uncharged.
---
it’s not on the runelite client at all, these are private botting clients 
---
Looks good, but I'd add at least 2 stam'pot sink bridges in there
---
Just idiots in this sub overreacting to shit and try their best to make everyone believe their tinfoil ideas. Seeing people legitimately comment that "if Jagex doesnt poll massive changes like this then what else will they do, we're just becoming RS3" makes me actually worried for the type of people on this sub. Its a minor QoL change to make it easier for newer players to discover the biggest update OSRS has ever seen and act as a slight lore expansion for what in future will be a pretty big quest series that dives into the Xeric/Zeah lore. 
---
Reaching? I mean, they just added a quest to introduce F2P players to the existence of Zeah. It's definitely a teaser for membership. I don't object to that, F2P has always been a teaser for membership on some level, and I think this quest stays on the right side of the line in terms of nudging but not pushing F2Pers towards P2P. Also it's a fun quest. People complaining about it being short / whatever are not the target audience for the quest, which was made very clear.
---
Says fucking but then uses the word butt... your a different type of person then most o.o
---
N
---
I know right!? I completly agree. It's no joke how jagex just slams these things down in to the game.
---
Im sorry if your no-ship draynor only hardcore mobile weiner clicks only ironman is offended at the addition of the ship. 
---
Yes, this. In Runelite, if you use scaling with GPU plugin turned off, it scales the entire game, making it look blurrier than if scaling was off. You're essentially running the entire game at a lower resolution then scaling it up.
---
With GPU plugin _on_, the game graphics still run at native resolution as if scaling was off, so you lose no level of detail. But the interfaces are still scaled, independently of the game. It works really well, and it's a game changer for me on my 1440p screen.

The prayer reordering one failed a poll. It should not be available and Puzzle boxes should not be solved for you either

Which dock moved? Havent been on in a few days

I did NOT hear about the pub wtf is that shit. The dock I heard about but wtf
---
*Xp per hour

I feel like if they think it wont pass a poll they dont poll it
---
They put in a pub for a house settle down. You’re winded up over a pub and a dock. Maybe we should sit down and get our priorities straighten out.

holy shit, this is the ultimate stam'pot sink bridge

I get that this ruins the nostalgia but it makes perfect fuckin sense that a village in the water would have a dock. People are raging too hard with this and reaching for excuses 
---
Ironman has become so easy nowadays. Almost every single update benefits irons even more than mains. Just look at Konar for example, trash for mains but great for ironmen. 
---
idk man it seems pretty successful in china
---
Perhaps the clip is a bit out of context, but saying "fix it" without saying how isn't very helpful. And encouraging players to vote against content because of factors other than the content is downright stupid. Saying "I'll vote no to all updates until the poll system is changed" is like saying "I'll vote no to all updates until we get engine updates"; they may be related at times but they are separate things and spiting one doesn't help the other, it just hurts everyone.
---
Oooooooo prisoners vs monks sounds nice 
---
Needs 3 giant ship's from lunar's quest
---
On my ironmeme that goes into Herblore
---
I think caveman does as well. I have no doubt it will be a blast for settled. But the end game shit sucks for content. Early and mid game are so much to do. 
---
saying snowflake unironically Pepega
---
It gave their reasoning in the same paragraph.
---
Make the fence in lumbridge swamp a wilderness ditch to the south, everyone happy. Make sure there’s a spade spawn all the way south so people will want to go there though.
---
Yeah, no, this thread is bait
---
The downvotes...
---
Yikes guys. 
---
This makes RuneScape 3 look more loyal to the game as it was 10 years ago
---
Shut up.
---
Yeah, I commented before reading it like a dummy. My fault lol
---
take a sip and sit
---
This is the biggest one for me and the reason I got into 3rd party clients in the first place.
---
That was yhe beginning route of RS3. We should avoid that.
---
wow this is really game breaking what a shame
---
a 2x10 hole in my heart
---
And cooks assistant is just talking to an NPC twice and collecting 3 items, what kind of quest were you expecting to be released?
---
The port is fucking cluttered. It isn’t easy nor good gameplay to have to navigate it at all. 
---
Zeal is meant to be low to mid level content so it makes sense for jagex to draw attention to it from new players
---
Nmz wasn't polled if I remember correctly, but I agree with your sentiment. I really want to imbue my Slayer helmet for the range boost but I can't bring myself to do nmz. 
---
OSRS future looks bleak with Jagex catering more and more to new mobile players whining about not having a lot of time to play. Game has entered a bad state through many OSRS updates such as blowpipe, Wintertodt, NMZ and twisted bow. RS3-lite.
---
I don’t like this. Who thought this was a good idea?
---
Zulrah loot table should have been nerfed long time ago.
---
OSRS team kept 6 hour  NMZ &amp; splashing thing alive for way too long.
---
These people got so offended when their RuneScape skill got questioned. Makes me think the average scaper is quite the loser.
---
There's an entire series of worlds dedicated to you guys, it's not just one area. There's nothing snowflakey about it, I rarely go to wildy except when jagex forces me to for clues because it's a massive waste of time dealing with guys like you.
---
I'm just lucky pkers rarely have high total levels so I can do the rare things I need to do in higher level worlds to keep away from you guys. I did the entire mage arena 2 miniquest in 1750 total world without seeing 1 pker, it was great.
---
It's not even risk vs reward, locking the best pickaxe in the game behind an arbitrary series of fairly easy wildy bosses is stupid. It's obvious they should have had it related to the RED AXE in Keldagrim like RS3 does. Most of the other stuff like chins and the altar at least have close alternatives outside of the wildy. 
---
I resent the fact that there's enough crap to get me pk'ed in the wildy, I don't need more stuff forcing me to go there. As far as your stupid polls go, I actually voted yes to entangle, it's not like anyone uses it anyway and pkers in f2p are a joke.

Carry fish on your back
---
Best idea right here. Veos said he's new to the area right? Would make sense to keep the ship anchored in the bay.
---
He didn’t say Jad he said the x6 Jad on the beta/testing server. Just to clarifying cause you seem confused on that point. 
---
Seriously that would be incredible. I hope it happens.
---
This makes 1 sense to me
---
Just call the priest already.
---
People who go law running aren't interested in making a gp profit, they just want law runes and they feel that its worth the extra work to get them for free.
---
Yeah that quest made no sense either. It taught you almost nothing about the game and was super slow.

Isn't it 30 minutes?

"Fix this" with no actual suggestion.

What do you use the brimstone key on? And what do you get?
---
Mobile says hi
---
I think you're missing the point big guy
---
Damn I suppose that wouldnt work then.
---
I get that some third party clients take it too far. But until the vanilla client has simple things like ground item names and values, chat commands, bank value, etc., people will continue to use third party clients. There is a difference between helpful and overpowered features, however if I can't get one or the other, I'll take a mixture of both before neither and so would the majority of the community. Lets not down people for using a third party client just because the client CAN be used to give unfair advantages.
---
Qol vs effort.
---
Is a whole discussion that needs to be had at some point.
---
But given Jagex doesn't know what QoL means, I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
As long as runelite exists their hands are tied as far as bot detection goes as well.  
---
Because their obfuscation is so solved, their client is basically open source.  Any changes they make are visible.  
---
Disallow third party clients and add the features to the official client.  
---
This exactly
---
You should make money through skilling and spend money to PvM, not the other way round. 
---
Literally no making osrs players happy. They're terrible. It's like asking a woman what she wants for dinner. She doesn't fucking know. 
---
Because it's not a new episode of swampletics. Everyone loves the same shit , and hates the same shit. This week it's swampletics, and a new dock respectively. 
---
Why does it matter though? Maybe the dude wanted to build anew dock. I feel like all this outrage is unnecessary
---
They're adding Svalbard Global Seed Vault into White Wolf Mountain 
---
Yes, the loot has not changed; it just adds an extra step to obtaining Konar's loot, since players felt the extra drops to be too artificial.
---
This update is impress, I don't keep up with future updates but I didn't expect to see this. Great Job to the people involved. 
---
Okay
---
I get the concern. But you do realize they are a company correct? They hired multiple new people and that costs money. 
---
Would you rather them add a quest that "baits" membership, even though we all know anyone who enjoys the game will pay for anyway. OR they can add MTX which is significantly more lucrative for little effort. Gotta pick your battles. 
---
my pure has 1 construction lol
---
I figured this quest was supposed to lead people to the cliënt of kourend quest, since that leads to Zeah. From the poll blog:  “a quest designed to tie Zeah to the rest of Gielinor. This quest will also encourage new users to find out more about Zeah and Great Kourend.
---
You can't note cooked sharks.
---
I mean now that I know, it's huge and I can't unsee it lmao. I probably wouldn't have noticed for another month or two if it weren't for you darn kids.
---
yeah that will be what i probably move to if i need to go back. my pure is basically done training there anyway
---
Thanks for the link!
---
?  
---
what do you think mobile is using 
---
&gt;I am literally dead these peoples’ lives are so uneventful that their most important memories lie in a trash early 2000 dialup internet java game.
---
You're in the wrong sub to be talking like that
---
Yeah and ironically graphic update would help bring a new generation into the game and everyone shit on it. The game will eventually die because of failure to attract new players once the ol boys die or get into a point of life you can’t play anymore 
---
What ended up happening, I need an ending to this story
---
Well now the old Zeah boat is useless because Draynor is just simply better with direct ammy of glory TP and a bank.  One less reason to go to Port Sarim which is already one of the least used cities.
---
Ski Shanty 2
---
Nice
---
People in this sub amaze me. Every month, everyone loses their minds over some inane shit. This update is not a big deal, and I feel bad for the devs that work so hard for such an intolerable community. 
---
The neet life
---
Because he ran out of good boy points for tendies
---
oh no one combat lvl the account is practically unplayable now....
---
Needs more iron ore outcrops, magic trees, lobster fishing, shark fishing, herb patches, thieving, and another agility course.
---
Take it or leave it.
---
You deserve not getting a claw for taking a picture of your screen with a phone. 
---
Imaging browsing the 10 year old clicking simulators subreddit. 
---
I mean the port is just next door why not there where the boats you know belong 
---
What about this? Never thought it that, but why not? Makes most sense IMO 
---
Use it on the chest next to Konar. Should give you an item from her drop table. Basically instead of just getting the drop during your task you can open the chests to get the drop whenever you want.
---
Yep. I turned off the spellbook filter on day 1 becuse the small icons were just awful
---
You are too obsessed with me and my client. I mean you arent even a lead developer of Runelite that would want a monopoly with his client. My client has been out for nearly 5 years and you are trying to draw the lines and set your own set of rules of whats right and whats not for others? Seems like you are just butthurt about not being in control. And get your facts straight, Loot sniper is nothing bot-alike, you are just taking the word of redditers. 
---
I don't think the port/pub will make it in the February slot
---
The devs don’t know what they’re doing: upper management does. And it’s not always in the interest of the current player base.
---
Assuming we aren’t talking about pvp, the difference in player skill doesn’t really affect most outcomes till you start bossing. I got to 70+ WC when I was in 4th grade as f2p chopping being horribly inefficient. At the end of the day it still got me the same levels as everyone else. 
---
I hate nuggers
---
That is not how bis works 
---
Pures are annoying af and them not getting updates past polls is lovely
---
Haha. Not fussed about you knowing my rsn. It's my user haha. The clan chat im in were saying some pretty unsavoury things. That's why I blocked it out lol. 
---
Wrong sub
---
Just make people spawn on Zeah already if you want them so much to see you shitty content
---
Maybe fix that hideous continent before trying to push players on it.
---
No word has been said to my knowledge, has been there since mobile release, so will it get fixed? Most likely. When? I have no idea.
---
I don't think most people in the game care about the dock or new pub one way or the other. 
---
This sub is overloaded with entitled players who want the game their way and will moan and complain loudly about things they disagree with. 
---
Ezscape
---
Downvoted for changes that nobody asked for. 
---
Best in slot literally means the best you can wear. It can be easily put as "in the moment". If he doesn't have slayer req for gargs, then he's wearing the best in slot boots at the moment with his current skills. 
---
Then some achievement diaries.
---
It's port Sarim not port Draynor. Please fix.
---
My opinion is, these changes are so minor that I’m assuming the bar will never even gets realized to most players bc we all couldn’t give less fucks about lumbridge anyway. 
---
The dock I understand the anger a little bit more but I still don’t see the problem. Especially with an area we prob give even less fucks about. 
---
It really doesn't look bad at all. I never would have noticed if OP didn't make a thread complaining about it. 
---
Which means the dev team successfully integrated new architecture without it looking out of place. 
---
We need to get over this "every piece of \*content\* added to the game needs to be polled" mentality. It's a terrible game design process and stagnates new content because somebody somewhere always disagrees and makes something as simple as a cosmetic recolor - or a fucking dock - into a "REEEEEEEEE EZSCAPE REEEEEEEE" argument. 
---
Like it or not the developers over at Jagex are the paid professionals behind this process and they understand what's best for the game overall and your $11 - contrary to Reddit's armchair developers.  
---
Let Jagex produce and implement content unhindered and have the players shape the rough edges through polls/forums... which I guess this thread complaining about a dock would satisfy, but still... it's a fucking dock not worth any additional dev time. 
---
yeah you're not going to get in trouble for that, it's not like they can detect what overlays you're actually showing   
---
and rather than writing your own, you could just go through the source history on the runelite repo and re-use the old one (you will have to modify it since it was written prior to some fundamental changes to plugins, but the hardest part is already done) 
---
OSRS has survived because they formed a dev team and launched it and have been very active in the community in keeping things fixed and adding new content. It's health is almost exclusively credited to the launch of mobile.
---
The OSRS devs operate differently than the RS2 devs did, they're not afraid to admit they made a mistake and correct it. So blocking potential content does nothing but hurt the potential of the game.
---
/u/JagexGambit is The Sheered Ram being added to the bar crawl minigame?
---
That way it locks it being efficient behind fally hard diaries
---
Someone else suggested moving Redbeard Frank to the pub a few steps away, and giving Veos the northern dock at Port Sarim. 
---
Surely you can acknowledge that what you're asking for is a way to recover someone's account without the email password, correct?
---
That is dead ass shady and if you forgot the password then losers weepers, get it?
---
another great example of the friendly Ironman. Entitled people man
---
Delayed? It’s already ingame. Pretty shit quest though, it’s basically an easy clue scroll.
---
Yeah cause the pub doesnt look super out of place..
---
Meanwhile the dock looks like shit and is out of place.
---
Looks nice.
---
Anyone can be zealous, not just newer players.
---
I never thought these would be my least favorite updates added to osrs
---
What you’d have to do is change that name in the original account and hope that when you change it on your new account that it’s available
---
Neck yourself 
---
Yeah but it’s all about suckering those noobs into thinking it’s good gp/h so they do it!
---
I was one of those noobs back in the day...
---
It's literally their game. So by all means boycott them, but the overall amount of players that would cancel membership over some content not being polled wouldn't make a dent in the game's infrastructure.
---
Soooo much better. Tons of chins, very few people. 
---
I'd never use it and I use Vengeance tons. I would still vote yes. Learning to click in a slightly different place is not that hard people.
---
back when i quit 25 was the max...
---
still a virgin, eh?
---
Lots of updates today that i really dont agree with, I hope 2019 isn't the year where we lose the "feel" of OSRS, because each poll and update lately seems to be inching closer and closer to a totally different game. 
---
God I hope this isn't satire lol
---
Just got Quest Cape. But seriously I doubt this would pass considering the north side of ge being opened up for F2P failed.
---
Also this would devalue slayer rings.
---
ty :)
---
The only players even in Draynor are willow bots and farmer thieves. Who gets their undies in a knot about something like this? 
---
I just see no point in complaining about f2p getting a quest.
---
I enjoyed the quest, even if I found it pointless and unnecessary. Although I'm biased because Clues are my favorite content.

Awe rough, I’m running on fumes here. Been up too many nights working on my research essay. That was supposed to be happy, lol. 
---
I may get downvoted for saying it but I dont think tick manipulation should even be a thing to improve exp rates for skilling. It takes muscle memory and thats it and it gives you a good chance at fucking up your hands, pretty sure thats why most people dont do it
---
Moments... 
---
When I think of a client getting 'out of control', I really only think of clients like that PK client that switches your prayer for you based on the weapon you're holding. There's also one that a lot of people use for DMM that highlights tiles where you can attack someone but they can't attack you etc. Those kind of clients are cheating IMO. These are a few reasons why I believe the Runelite client isn't an issue:
---
1. It's a free client, if you don't want to use the plugins yourself then that's fine, but it's not fair to complain about the people who do use them when you have the same opportunity.
---
2. Aside from small parts of the game (such as pking), the plugins aren't really giving any COMPETITIVE advantage.
---
Again, these are only for the Runelite client. I did have issues with OSBuddy charging you extra to use the better plugins. I also have a problem with those special pk clients that give someone a COMPETITIVE advantage over other players. But for people who aren't using clients/plugins for a competitive advantage, I don't see the problem in letting them choose how they want to play.
---
With all of that being said, when there IS a competitive section for the game (such as DMM Seasonal), I believe that EVERYBODY should be on the same client, whether its the official client or not. I believe that the fact that some people have access to special clients to essentially pk for them is where I draw the line for cheating.

I know I probably repeated some points a few times, I just kinda typed out my words as I thought of them.

Everyday there is a 99 farming cape post. Gz!

It has a castle dude
---
Congratulations, you've discovered the definition of spaghetti code.
---
Are you saying that it devalues his bis Ironman?
---
Fucking what wait can I have some more context. When did that happen? 
---
Why would a castle be surrounded by 
---
only like 7 buildings? The answer is it's not a very realistic game
---
Well seeing that I’m wasting XP by typing out this comment.. I’d say efficiency is the way to go
---
It’s silver jewelry. Use a cut jade with a bar of silver and a necklace mold
---
gotta do a free world man
---
Supposed to be a hashtag, but reddit just makes things really big with one in front of text. 
---
Because people using the plugin don't know that it's not allowed, sure buddy.
---
With that, you lost all credibility imo.. Fuck cosmetics being paid, keep game content in the game which we pay for already with a monthly sub. Let us grind for any cosmetics, never pay
---
no, i dont track how much xp i got from inferno because why wud i?

There is a difference between fantasy elements in a fantasy game and logic like that

Its all flicking tho? you dont take any damage anyway if flick correctly, but mistakes are more riskier

Prices seem a little whack. They should easily be 6k
---
&gt;.&lt; be gentle senpai
---
Guys.... Im okay with this. *instantly beaten to death by looted shovels*
---
Yes, it is
---
Watch out encouraging people to quit, undemocratic updates like this are what killed rs3.
---
Bstaves were dead meta ages ago. Farming giant seaweed is better and before that charters were better. The GP is very small compared to having to make orbs, slayer gives faster gp for macroefficiency 
---
Yeahhhh it's gonna be a no from me dog
---
I like how OP has not one or two, no, a full invy of box traps to test this 
---
How can inferno cape ruin zerker?
---
Thats a bizarre pipe dream you have. Subscriber counts continued to grow long before mobile came into effect. Your so detached from reality its honestly funny. 
---
OSRS exists and thrives because it is community driven content. It got a boost from its already consistent growth from mobile, nothing more. 
---
But seriously, you want to remove the partnership with the community hand simply have a clunky action rpg? What could possibly go wrong?
---
Bronze armor and such to match. 
---
The price will have to do the availability of the bones and how people view the xp/gp which tends not to be linear with bones. IMO the bones can range from 6k-7.5k depending on whether people dump there’s right now, or hold for long term. 
---
I assume 4-5 when I read that because that's how many I kill. Or 25/hr. Not certain though. If you are curious you can find the average loot value per kill and check how many u kill an hour.
---
It’s a good guide but it just seems the same to the ones I have seen
---
*haunted manor
---
I am gonna be honest nostalgia is gone for me. I get it potential new player who hasn't played may want the nostalgia but lets be realistic how many of those are coming in now. So it could be why they thought it was a good idea. I still feel it should be polled. But in the bright side it wasn't like Veos was a long walk sure it's shorter now. 
---
You know there are other games you can play too; you don't need to play OSRS if you don't like it.

I just finished galvek and no OP time didn’t make that fight any easier. Shit was tough

Man, you're gonna lose your mind when I tell you they drink wine in church.

I agree if you still feel nostalgia after 5 years God bless lol
---
KEEP BOATS IN PORT SARIM WHERE THEY BELONG
---
&gt;What we want
---
Be careful with this.  There is a reason people use the official client.  I myself have only ever wanted stat decay timer, everything else I find is totally unnecessary and ridiculous (highlights/timers on literally everything) or blatantly advantageous (ToG timers).  And I know people who are even harsher than that.
---
I also fucking hate this increased max zoom, even all this time after it's been out, I'm still not used to it.  It is nice on mobile though.
---
One thing you can do to royally piss off official client users is foist these features on them saying they wanted it all along.  Of course, I'd have to imagine (outside of GPU renderer) they'd all be optional toggles, which is fine... but if you aren't an official client user you have no business throwing the word "we"/"us" around
---
It's always sunny in Lumbridge
---
Player mod meetings?
---
Membership/bonds to double name change the account is the only way. 
---
While this is 100% true and won't ever change, if jagex would just make some basic improvements to their own client, it would probably greatly reduced the amount of people who rely on a 3rd party client.
---
As it is now, the game really is significantly less accessable on the base client. Just some basic QoL stuff would at least make it competitive.
---
NMZ was polled. But it was polled as just being a fun little thing where you could fight quest bosses again, with some nice bonuses thrown in. We had no idea it'd become the thing it is today (Though it was even worse at release with Afk Guthans)
---
no i want to know, if i cannot remember my email password and cannot recover the email using all the information i can, that i infact have to remember my password. if i have all of the information POSSIBLE but the password, why can't i recover my fucking email i dont understand, why have these things in place if the only thing that matters is the email password.
---
The people complaining only step foot in Draynor when they need to get their quest Cape from being ANYWHERE else.
---
Draynor's much more accessible and has a bank, theres no reason to use Port Sarim Veos anymore, if they're going to keep this eyesore they may as well remove his ship in Port Sarim and make that city even more dead.
---
Comments like these are why I "spite-vote" no to every pvp update. Pkers aren't willing to ever compromise so I'll do my best to vote them out of the game
---
Oooo that’s nice, and have a dialogue box referencing that, kinda like the one you get with the new hydra shortcut
---
This is basically eoc, game is litcherally ruined!!
---
Iirc that's the object for null items, saw it a lot on small private servers
---
Sorry the world doesn't fit to your fears
---
Devalues my bridge-only ironman. No support. 
---
A village on the water right next to a major port. (That's where boats go)
---
Tbh I wish they would just reduce the price of volcanic ash from Volcanic mine. Can only get a few hundred per hour from there atm.
---
Seems like an extremely slippery slope to me. "Here is some content that could be behind this quest/boss, but we could make $$$ from it instead". Making only players that want to fork out *more* cash, be able to get it. Eh. Bonds are the best MTX solution imo.
---
Bar is great.
---
Boat is no.
---
Lmao, got a link?
---
how exactly are you going around noting random items on an UIM? Please tell me your secret so I can sell it to the UIM community 
---
The house I personally don't think is that big of a deal, although I wish it would have been polled along with the out of place large dock and ship which is where I really take issue. Also, membership should be sold on the merit of members' content alone. Not a sales pitch thrown into the face of new players.
---
Yeah its fine
---
Move the dock to the pub.
---
Welp, here it is again boys and girls. RS 4
---
Obviously...?  
---
I think you missed my point.  Plenty of the folks who stick by the official client do so because they don't want/like/care about the features Runelite, OSBuddy etc. have to offer.  I number myself among them, you will find plenty more in this thread and basically any other thread about 3rd party clients, usually downvoted into oblivion by butthurt 3rd party client users.  That's the "we" that OP should be careful about, is what I'm trying to say.
---
In the loot notifications there's a checkbox to notify on untradable drops. I must have missed it
---
will do mate thank you!
---
Who tf doesn't log out 5 minutes before every update for this EXACT reason?
---
You died because you thought you could play till the buzzer sounded. 
---
Draynor is supposed to be a "major city" compared to Port Sarim being a PORT. Also how is Port Sarim useless? People have more reasons to be there than draynor on top of that port sarim is a cluster fuck of ships and places you have to go this also ties him into the game with the quest than just slapping him at the bottom of port sarim. You're just a whiny bitch. If it means port sarim becomes more "useless" for draynor to become more relevant I think that makes 100 times more sense.
---
Why not move the GE there as well
---
That adds to the adventure! Everyone always groans about not being able to go back in time and not know anything about them game. Well here is Zeah! and Kebos lol 
---
What are you going to go to Port Sarim for now?  
---
This should be the top comment.
---
Yeah because everyone *loves* more Zeah quests and they definitely don't feel tacked on at all.  Completely fitting with the Oldschool theme.  
---
I did not use any timers
---
I'd still rather just mine the ash manually than play that shite minigame
---
They've been trying for years. LMAO
---
Go to Morytania and be swampletics sidekick
---
Is this comment a meme?
---
I honestly can't even tell
---
Zahur already exists in Nardah and will clean herbs for you
---
I'd rather hang myself than level rc past 32 tbh
---
I prefer red cape days tbh...
---
The GE is now in level 20 wilderness. Enjoy. 
---
Me too!! I even pulled up the quest notes hat said he was south of Draynor, lol I’m an idiot 
---
Regarding the f2p ring of forging, isn't the NPC at the GE unnecessary since level-3 enchantment is already a f2p spell?
---
Cranky no banky
---
Probably because they know that aesthetic changes in order to help people who are completelly new to rs will never make it through the polls
---
Why? Because you guys ruin everything? This game has become the game of politic, on one side you got the party of pvp, disgraceful loser who hurts the innocent and on the other side you the the chads skillers/pvmers that works to improve the community with their content and love.
---
Dude I didn’t even know there was a loot notifications option until now
---
Except it's working backwards. RuneLite works by decompiling and deobfuscating the official client and using that. Jagex would still need to change a bunch of code to make it work with their unobfuscated original source code.
---
You guys are fucking morons. It's completely reasonable that people don't want some iconic spots changed. 
---
Imagine being an OSRS celebrity but not being Zezima
---
Sounds like they would need to get off reddit if they have to budget what posts to look at because of data charges lmao
---
Yeah that was the point of the post actually
---
“Stretched mode” to resize the interfaces it’s so much better than the standard full screen option!
---
Not sure if this is the same image, but I saw GentleTractor suggest this on Twitter. Putting it further away from the Port would make more sense. It could even be from Wizard's Tower or in Lumbridge Swamp.
---
I'm maxed and haven't killed a single person in the wilderness since about 2009. I'm also not a dunce that repeats reddit memes in comments.
---
Hey all, I've been asked to reply to this thread with an explanation as to why questions #8 and #9 are being polled. It might seem like a no-brainer to implement, but I'm told that the way icons are displayed on that specific interface requires substantial code changes to show sprite icons. So it'll take a chunk of the Skilling week's development time to implement.
---
I'll admit, I've not been too involved with QoL month, so if you have other questions I may not be able to answer, in which case I'll defer to the others who'll be back in the morning. Keep the questions and feedback coming though! 
---
It's another nail in the coffin for Port Sarim.  Why would anyone go there when Draynor is much more convenient? 
---
BOY THIS ALCHEMICAL HYDRA SLAYER TASK WOULD BE A LOT MORE FUN IF THERE WASNT AN UNPOLLED DOCK IN DRAYNOR 8^)
---
AHAHAHA polls btw 
---
pls
---
i made this image. I don't twitter, lol
---
As someone mentioned, they polled replacing a SINGLE PIXEL but didn't poll 2 changes to the oldest areas of runescape. Surely it's not impossible to see why some people are upset.
---
I meant the copy pasta wasn’t funny, but to each their own I suppose
---
This update brought to you by Darude.
---
what even is the point of this comment? Trying to call someone out on a technicality? 
---
"You said text guide but I see PICS!!!!"
---
It needs like fifteen green dragon craters. They won't look out of place or anything!
---
It boggles my mind that people are unironically upset by this
---
you only have jacked arms in a game loser
---
A boat isn't a damn sales pitch. It's a BOAT. 
---
F2P players often spend the first several WEEKS of their account time in Lumbridge and Draynor. 
---
A boat is supposed to be a "Hey cool what's this over here?" sort of thing.
---
It's not a boat with big letters on the side selling a membership. 
---
F2P players, ESPECIALLY PLAYERS WHO HAVEN'T PLAYED FOR 15 years, but 15 days rather, are deserving of more content too. How is jagex supposed to introduce new players to the "merits" of members content without selling them a membership anyway? What the fuck does that even mean?
---
He never stated they were cooked...
---
Jagex isn't a person you love, it's a company that has already ruined one game with updates that nobody asked for.  
---
Or a small dinghy like the one Captain Jack Sparrow had.
---
It's ok. Once you've played the game for more than one day you'll have more money.
---
Give him max strength cape as well then because that boy gotta be strong rowing that thing across the ocean
---
They changed the lumbridge house to a bar? Oh hell no
---
Here here
---
If you hadn't started the quest before you couldn't lock in favor.  That was the whole point of the quest.  Now that you never lose favor, the quest has to have some sort of point to it.
---
Where’s the stam’pot sink bridge?
---
yeah man boats are soooo gross
---
Didnt hide your run energy, sit kid
---
love the visual indicator when the hespori is grown, the sandstone being buckets of sand is a decent enough alternative which im fine with. encourages people to go out of their way to mine sandstone and it will (maybe?) most likely not change the current meta in terms of sand/hr. 
---
Why not offer herbs to the automated process questions, where autocleaning them is slower but manually is faster. 
---
Just give us an official overlay API and some moderate (non-gamebreaking) data bindings.
---
don’t forget about the 268362937 bottles clue
---
I thought it used to mean player jumping, never even knew there were variations of it
---
that dock has to go...
---
that's awesome. shit... imagine if Jagex put NPCs that had combat skills that advanced instead of the current dumb monsters everywhere. no NPC even runs I believe; enemies in games that run are super scary. I always wished they had that in minecraft lol (probably because of the dumb herobrine stuff). fawk, so much potential. do you know the names of any private servers like that? I'd like to satisfy my curiosity.
---
Considering all meter sticks are the same length [citation needed], it was a bit foolish to make the answer in terms of linear density
---
UIM Snowflake edition
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I honestly can't even tell if you are trolling or not
---
Amazing how some people say the House was useless but don’t realize that we have several other pubs in F2P and a dock on port Sarim that serve little purpose at all
---
can we just add the swimming skill so i can just swim to places
---
Wow, that’s super accurate. Since stick was 86 and weights were 500 grams, that makes you within ~3% of the real answer
---
Ah, so the meterstick is half the mass I expected, so 500g matches my calculations :)
---
Or he just rows you over to his original ship in Sarim where they should of just kept it in the first place.
---
Did you have 2FA on your email? 
---
aye
---
It's literally called 'Draynor Village' so no it's not meant to be a major city.  And yeah, PORT Sarim is a port, that's why the boats are there and not in Draynor.  Just have the quest NPC tell the player where Veos is it's not that hard. 
---
I may get hate for this but I really don’t think it’s a big deal. I have no nostalgic feelings for the way lumbridge used to look. If they removed the goblins in lumbridge that would be another story...
---
Membership is 100% worth it there is so much more to do, quests, bosses, slayer and all the other skills, f2p becomes old quick and with members you always have something to aim for!
---
Add me up as well - General HLgh
---
Tip 1: Think of a new name for when you get forced to name change.
---
Name game 10/10
---
Yes and has been since creation
---
Being efficient has it's value, I'd rather chop teaks than magics because it's a "faster" AFK method. But with mining I don't have any interest in learning tick methods so I'll slowly slog away at MLM and enjoy the chillness.
---
Buyables should be done as quickly as possible though. Figure out the gp/XP and get the best rates you can stomach. Ironmen are obviously different, but for mains doing crafting, prayer, or herblore should be the fastest rate you can handle/afford.
---
For learning Efficient methods I'd say learn them for skills you don't like so that you don't need to spend as much time on them. Like fishing, I will likely learn barbarian fishing to get to a point where there is an AFK fish I like. 
---
Gathering skills: what you enjoy is top priority
---
Buyables/bank skills: fastest/what you can comfortably afford
---
Combat: improves over time.
---
Rune crafting: cry in pain until 77
---
Saying there can't be paid cosmetics because they could be from some imaginary boss is an extremely limited way of thinking, and doesn't justify not adding something. There can be loot for a boss, AND there could be paid cosmetics. They aren't mutually exclusive. I'm not saying the paid cosmetics should be boss themed or anything like that, just stand alone fancy items to bank stand with.
---
Sounds like they still had access to your account from last time or that site also had a virus
---
Points always hard
---
Joke's on you tho I play the shit out of my F2P HCIM.
---
maybe they added it without a poll because they figured no one gave a shit about something little as this boi were they wrong
---
Probably much easier than the coding required to.make the spell work on only one type?
---
SwAmPlEcTiCs HaVe My BaBiEs
---
I agree with your final point. 
---
And no I'm not suggesting large graphical updates to announce new content. 
---
ah yes the bloodvelds drop one boot per drop, so I kept killing them for the other one.
---
Nah bruv I have two pairs.
---
No it's not. It's a dock made out wood using pixels. It is nowhere near game breaking as changing HITPOINTS to CONSTITUTION, or adding summoning, or anything of that nature. They added 25 tiles for fucks sake.
---
Its not pictures: like the inventory "icons", those things you see as sprites are actually 3D models but angled
---
Dam just checked my screen time and I only play an average of 3hr and 40 mins a day.... guess I need to get those numbers up
---
So people should be getting in a fit over the lack of a poll. instead they're sperging out about a new dock
---
I had no idea about the rs3 boat in Draynor up until now. Still, wouldn't you say this idea keeps that 'nostalgic iconic Draynor Village' more intact than what we've got right now?
---
The quest was polled my dude. 
---
Grind it mate. A few weeks of your life where you feel miserable, don't worry, 3 years later it will feel a bit better.
---
Source: 76 Agility, haven't trained it in 3 years. Still don't want to go train it, but now I can atleast sleep.
---
oh ok cool
---
Pretty much. Thing is, in RuneScape case, the community back in 2007 is what made the game so epic. It’s not just the gameplay but the kids back then and all the positivity ans sense of wonder that made RuneScape what it was. 
---
RuneScape without kids is like a funfair without children’s, a party without beer. it’s enjoyable but you never will reach the crazy state that make it so epic and memorable 
---
So yes RuneScape is a game that should update itself once in a while especially to attract kids un because that’s half of the pleasure
---
Running around and having a ''noob'' following you drooling on your dragon platelegs you know ahaha or helping a lil kid complete dragon slayer and he’s almost crying of joy wearing a rune plate body 
---
These little moment are what make RuneScape RuneScape 
---
But was the Pub?
---
This post right here, officer.
---
Hahah. Well only Defence and Agility are in "lol fuck it" spots. :P
---
$11 btw
---
They should have polled grapgucal updates to lumbridge and Draynor. It's not the same. People have been OK with other things. 
---
i quit run escape
---
What about all other broken 3rd party client features lol
---
What's next? Replacing a single house with an ENTIRE pub?
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---
hehehe the kill message after all that convo was a great ending
---
The placement of that dock is horrendous.
---
Seriously that amount of replies to OP saying some stupid shit is amazing. At least OP was cool about it. 
---
Jagex does not have the bandwidth to develop and support a client like RuneLite that supports features  you want. You want a third party client, but because the third party client is third party, you don't want it. 
---
So I made the analogy of standing in lines that never move to compare the wait you'd experience if Jagex were to take this on currently.
---
I unsubscribed a couple of weeks ago because I realized I wasn't having fun and I disagreed with almost every change added in the last year but I still stop by here for the discussion when I'm bored at work.
---
AYAYA
---
I think they should fix the bug and make it universal yeah, either remove it or speed it up so it’s not needed. But 1 click harvesting was a joke. I understand it wouldn’t influence prices. Idc about that I just think making herb runs faster isn’t necessary. Why can’t we just hire an NPC to do them for us? Just stay at the bank and have the NPC bring you all your farmed resources. 
---
one man army
---
Yeah your mother cringed after i stuck it in her prone-bone style
---
Something like that, but less shitty
---
Its just a joke 
---
Oh damn, TIL. Thanks!
---
But it changes the iconic places that make up “old school runescape” if varrock ends up looking completely different will you not care then? For my self the game is not just about content changes its about how it feels to play it like eg in rs3 they changed the look of items.. it loses its iconic feel.
---
What were you slaying? 
---
That is a GREAT name for a UIM. Making a new account right now.
---
F2P gets no say!
---
Devalues my DIS fairy ring island only ironman
---
Leaves to go cook sharks, so they’ve clearly been gone for at least 5 minutes. Then they claim you jacked the world? This is almost as bad as Thermy PoHers. Legit had someone say “Hop kid, I went to make lunch 15 minutes ago this is my world” as they d claw spec my Thermy that’s 45% into the kill on my 8th kill for the trip. 
---
But the spells already work on just Amulets for F2P. I wouldn't think allowing Level 3 Enchant to also work on Ruby Rings would be that hard to do. Either way, paying an NPC to do it for you feels kinda out of place and I'd rather F2P just buy them from Members instead of doing that.
---
Mega cringe
---
People like you are why I hope to God that new players do not ever find or join this sub. 
---
I’ve heard some people saying the boat in Port Sarim would be enough. That I can agree with, but the house being changed to a pub is nothing to me 
---
It would be impossible to do anything update wise if they polled every aspect of everything. Good to see you are a stand up fella no matter where I run into you on this sub, other's should take a chill pill and maybe consider that for the game to run properly some things just have to be done without polling. You have to be honestly bored out of your mind to care this much to REEE around Reddit about a few cosmetic changes to architecture.
---
I get it that the community doesn't want MTX or P2W, but fuck me I think some people think that means the game should never change. Like if it doesn't look like it did EXACTLY the way it was in August 2007, get fucking bent and stop trying to ruin my game. 
---
I don't know man, the longer I hang around Reddit the more people seem to lose their shit about the oddest stuff. And I'll be damned if there is any actual civil conversation, no it's always discussions of absolutes and the most upvotes goes to the person who most acts like the world is falling apart. Sometimes you stub your toe, doesn't mean you need to keel over and start crying dramatically.(This is how I picture some people around here)
---
I can't believe people are actually upset about this, go outside lol
---
Its.......him
---
Well thats my sister. She would pick anytime league of legends over sleep.
---
Take that idea back to RS3. We don't want it here.
---
I looked up to him back in 2006, but he's a traitor.
---
well if that's the case you might wanna start calling me garfield because i want some of god ash's titty lasagne
---
Oh look, a Pker with sub standard spelling and grammar.
---
That is a GTA mission start mate. 
---
You think maybe that's a bit of an overreaction? What if it was God Ash's idea?
---
hehehe
---
Why are u adding things and not checking with the player base if they feel right in osrs anymore? 
---
Lumbridge has historically been a dry town, I for one am appalled that they allowed the devils nectar to be allowed in our sleepy little town. What's next? Legalizing Cabbage? I for one will be boycotting these changes that take us further from Saradomin's Light. 
---
At 92 ranged with 0 DWH hits Adamant Darts is 8.95 DPS. Rune Darts is 9.34 DPS. A 4.18% DPS increase.
---
If you hit good BGS/DWH hits that number closes further, as the accuracy gained from the rune darts becomes less and less impactful with only 1 max hit being gained.
---
Good.  Whenever I go to ash on my BTW I literally only see bots and maybe the occasional other ironman.

Okay, but I don't want most of the features available on those clients, which is why I don't use them.  Also, Jagex has added plenty of things (for better or worse) to the official client.  A lot of these things were basically popular demand features introduced later in Runescape's life, like data orbs or xp drops, that were originally points of appeal for third-party clients.  
---
The house to pub is fine. I can't imagine anyone truly cares that it was changed and are just hopping on a bandwagon that started as a meme. I could be wrong of course, but ship in draynor is very ugly. I like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ao5fnq/perhaps_veos_can_have_a_rowboat_instead_of_a_ship/) suggestion by /u/glassmachine.
---
Stop trying, you already proved to me you lack the mental capacities to have this discussion. 
---
Draynor dock bad
---
Nerfing Konar drop table good 
---
had more pixels last time I saw this
---
6x Jad doesn't give any unique rewards you nutter. 
---
Exxxxxcellent
---
This is such a ridiculous post. I too have been playing since the beginning, and these changes mean nothing to me. TBH, I would have never even noticed the pub in lumbridge. Even the dock is fine, if you ask me. The original location for Veos was terrible.
---
As for all the BS about this being the start of bad updates. While I agree all new game content should be polled, we are no where near RS3. The devs know if they did something bad like MTX &amp; double exp weekends, this game would die instantly.
---
If you're upset about your nostalgia over this, I sure as hell hope you complained about Blowpipe, Zulrah, Tbow, Vork, etc..
---
Sorry, I misread your comment. I read "higher" as more kills per hour. 
---
Na it wouldn’t be gf this game it would just be gf to a very small percent of people who are too fucking dumb to comprehend playing a game without the game playing itself for them
---
I swear whomever is making these knows what real art is
---
I dunno man, I always thought the HP bar alone was enough.
---
I can live without the stat decay timer, but it just stands out as a feature that third-party clients have virtually always had, and that I would actually be appreciative of.  Other examples are things we already got, like data orbs.
---
I hate this.
---
Changes that benefit new players ONLY should not be polled.
---
Most people vote on whats best for themselves so this would not have passed. 
---
What is more concerning is they’re just adding content in willynilly without checking if the player base wants it...
---
Why not move it to the GE?
---
No this is a private server
---
I mean with his autism levels and the help he will get, he will easily make enough content in a week for an amazing video.
---
I miss when polls had more than 15 questions
---
A fitting end to a mad lad
---
It's really good xp/hr for low effort. If you organize a good team it's MLM-like intensity for upwards of 90k/hr xp.
---
keep in mind that volcanic ash will drop in price
---
Maybe it would be better if Jagex had a direct communication with the community, because it seems that often the polls don’t really do a very good job of reflecting what the community wants, for example everyone was fine with the new quest but there were unforeseen side effects of changing Draynor that could have been solved if the community knew they were happening and had some input while they were developing the quest.
---
That's what he said. That's what the xp tracker does...
---
Looks good to me. 
---
&gt;how many players you might have to punish.
---
why would they immediately punish people? As long as the clients were blacklisted and nobody could use them from X point onward, no reason to retroactively punish third party client users.
---
Banning third party clients ASAP would be best for the game. Questionable ethical mods and blatant exploits (like in this thread) are not OK at all and destroys the game for players. However sadly people would quit and that would be bad for business, which is what Runescape is, a business.
---
I wonder if they Mods that monitor this sub call in to work sometimes because they don't want to deal with our shit. 
---
I find VM to be too stressful, even when I'm doing "well". I also dislike how the initial vent conditions can determine how frustrating a game will end up.
---
See now I completely agree about the bar in lumby but admittedly the draynor dock looks silly when you realize port sarim is like 8 seconds away. I just would’ve rather the dock look a little nicer instead of just being a random added in asset. 
---
I'm not sure if either would kill the price. Not a big fan of adding to Slayer, even if it is the less popular Wyverns, but if players still skip those tasks it won't change much. As for Mining, it probably will be an increase, but I'd expect most of the supply comes from players (or bots) with lower level mining. And if the price does crash, then there is even less of a reason to mine and sell at higher levels. So I think it will probably sort itself out reasonably well.
---
They went after Runelite because OSBuddy is made by an ex-Jagex employee with favor. 
---
They need to just stop adding so many quests.
---
I really hate the change to Drakes, a change to the amount assigned to be similar to Metal Dragons would have be so much better.
---
Removing something that made then unique and non AFK is poor IMO
---
What
---
There's such a thing as too much detail in design. Keep it simple.
---
She should have learnt to code!
---
Wtf why? All the good memories in RUINS,,! 
---
Also people have been using AHK and the like to make scripts for switch+spec/switch+mage.
---
What you mean first 99? You clearly already have 99 RC. 
---
you the realest! best guides out there my guy!
---
Just memeing lad
---
Name one purpose that isn't just saving one inventory spot or because you forgot
---
Good job. Kinda. Its their own risk going to wildy as hcim. I like the fact that you still killed him since the gamemode, one life. But otherwise im a ironman killing revs (wildy task) and pures always let me live, idk why. I enjoy that but losing the thrill
---
I mean. That was literally the point of 07scape so no point trying to make it sound dumb. 
---
[I know you haven't been playing for very long, so you might not know about this](https://i.imgur.com/GGK9PO9.png)
---
Just a memey way to say ironman
---
I don’t really mind just a qol
---
then cry for release servers like those other EHP retards
---
We already have t bow and scythe, the most overpowered shit to ever exist, new weapons come out every few months but of course you’re still complaining and crying. Tiers don’t exist in rs because lvl reqs are irrelevant
---
examples of other things not being logical is not justification for things not being logical
---
For the record, the "yolui're fucking disbled" comment was because you don't know how to blackjack at all and kept fucking it up so I couldn't just do it on top of you. 
---
Was also incredibly drunk because that's the only way to blackjack for extended periods. 
---
Just as a cosmetic to show off your 99 range or actually combine the benefits of both?
---
F2P Nostalgia &lt; P2P Nostalgia
---
You’re getting really stuck on this coin pouch thing, my point was that people tend to reject any idea that was released after 07. And those are the main two reasons I’m not seeing your point here.
---
Personally it just seems weird and out of place. Draynor always had this spooky feel to it and we got port sarim next door
---
95k/h and not click intensive isn’t rewarding enough? 
---
Not really that much skill though, it’s just repetition.
---
They don’t poll something and the community goes up in arms, they really should learn to just poll everything 
---
Doesnt matter where they put this dock you guys would complain 
---
Was the food Korean? 
---
If so, how was the diarrhea? 
---
Realistically I'd be happy with just:
---
GPU rendering
---
Bank value counter
---
Ground item texts and values
---
Pub fits. But the dock is horrendous.
---
[What are you gonna say when they add something that you don't like without polling it?](https://i.imgur.com/GGK9PO9.png)
---
Listen jagex.
---
Yeah it had been a few months since Ironman crafting got a massive buff, guess we are due for another 
---
Can you imagine thinking that a bunch of nerds spamming glow wave text have ever mattered lol
---
The pub is Lumbridge is ok. The Draynor update is aids
---
REEEEEEEPOSTI
---
If you have to ask what are the signs that you are addicted to OSRS lmao
---
i seen an ironman speedrun to 32 qp on yt but thats about it
---
Not sure if this is a joke 
---
What if Veah were to be moved there from port sarim for everyone until you complete the quest? He would still have the option to travel to Zeah before and after the quest but him and his boat would move to port sarim after you complete the quest. But for the dock to look good it would require the suggested dock from the picture but instead using the charter ship. 
---
At 84 you can boost to use the southern rev shortcut. That's the only shortcut I've seen that held any interest to me since getting 76.
---
Thanks man it felt so nice. I couldnt believe it.

I had a similar situation with my dad. I used to play hours on end and he never really cared but one time it went a little too far and he beat me with jumper cables in the garage. :)

---
Literally nothing in rs is as simple to code as you would think. Remember this next time you're looking at an update going "it's just copy and paste!!"....it isn't. It never is lol. 
---
So it's some kind of suicide machine? 
---
I would rather use zulrahhelper(dot)com
---
He didn't say that at all...
---
Jagex can continue to let 3rd party clients do most of the legwork on new features while still tamping down when necessary to prevent exploits.  In fact, that's *exactly* what this thread is about.  
---
Please delete this, when the player base see's this, there will be uproar! Haha
---
Def not cosmetic, the benefits of prayer bonus and defense bonus from cape are why I want it.
---
I wonder how long it would take to travel that.
---
Runelite is basically the same as curse/addons in wow (idk if it still works the same I haven't played since cata.) There's definitely some plugins that go too far but for the most part they simply offer information that is either already available or should be in the game but isn't possible due to restrictions in the code etc.
---
There's also a grey area though, things like clue puzzle solvers etc I don't see as an issue because they're pretty irrelevant already since there's a mindless method to solve any 5x5 puzzle every time anyway that even 5 year olds can figure out. I'm surprised that we're almost 6 years into osrs and Jagex still hasn't sorted out a real client, it almost feels like they've been winging it all this time despite osrs being their biggest saviour, I have no doubt that without osrs Jagex would've been absolutely fucked yet it gets the least attention.
---
So now we selectively decide what to be upset about for being illogical and what not to be upset about for being illogical? That sounds completely reasonable. 10/10 response would debate again
---
Local noob here, what and where is this kill log menu? 
---
lol lettuce lake park, had my 5th grade 'going away' field trip there and we lost some kid.. maybe he did turn into bigfoot..
---
Arguable the speed run belongs to the the only guy who’s ever done it, but I’m sure it could be done faster 
---
okay here’s my guess as to what the meme is without knowing beforehand. ppl who play iron men tend to brag about it like ‘oh and i’m ironman btw’ so that’s why btw is retardspeak for ironman. am i close?
---
Boy do I have bad news about the entire continent of zeah then. 
---
i think they made it so you have to have an emblem in your inventory yourself before you can get them from a target
---
I mean it is a good suggestion though. I would do it on my UIM if it have rc tomes 
---
Do you know the combat read for it?
---
I've said it a few times in the thread, but I'll drop it here too:

I like the passive xp from cooking the sharks. Lets me work on cooking without having to just drop them afterward. 
---

lmao idiots

Sure they can. He's currently employed for the low, low price of free. 
---
Not a bad idea.
---
Lol thats me in the background. Was on break at work and come back to this 
---
Not anymore,reason I said above statement,they are forcing people to fight now 
---
Yea ik I was just curious if the salmon and the cake thing is like a calling card type deal haha
---
Out side of it not being polled, why are people so upset about it? 
---
That just means they're doing a good job of it!
---
I’ll do some research, but all I know is I just recently got the quest cape, that was my last one, and I died on the final boss about 15-20 times at 101 combat, so I assume it would be very hard for a low level to do it 
---
June and July are also incredible as well
---
Cook's assistant
---
Imp catcher
---
Goblin diplomacy 
---
Simply impossible at low levels
---
So much xp waste
---
Yeah but that increases runecrafting xp, which is terrible by training agility, which is terrible.
---
This increases the ease of getting to a fairy ring for people who can't be bothered to unlock faster fairy ring locations.
---
Literally passed a poll. Congratulations of being one of the &lt;25% voters that didn't want it but this is what the majority wanted, plain and simple.

Swamp Crab, Vampyre Juvinate.

All u saying draynor is nostalgic dont even go there. I cant remember the last time i teled there
---
isnt it just when you examine the herb
---
You’re all a bunch of losers
---
Revert to regular account, uim is not a beginners game mode 
---
its nothing to cry about but it is kinda dumb to have ONE DOCK for ONE BOAT in a town right next to a large port.
---
Isn't that the entrance?
---
mmm...bacon
---
Ah, nice to see that then. So they fell through on their promises. I’ve been playing for like 12 or 13 years, but haven’t really kept up with drama recently.
---
&gt;Did you ever play back in the day and wonder what was behind the taverly gate? Or the digsite fence?
---
I remember speculating with friends about the trapdoor (H.A.M. lair I think?) in the Lumbridge woods with the goblins, we all agreed there's probably a cool demon boss down there.
---

Imagine being so retarded that you think if someone charges glories once they're permanently banned from pking and they can never be a threat to you 
---
First, I have to assert again that commenting on reddit about something I feel important is not "crying."
---
I'll agree with that menu entry swapper on RL is very powerful and pushes the lines of game integrity in the same way, no argument there. However I would argue that you could add that plugin to your client yourself.Part of what I've been posting about regarding your client in the past weeks is lack of clarity on Jagex's end of what is and isn't allowed, so developers are left to draw those lines themselves.
---
The community as a whole is a lot more accepting of things that only independently affect an individual versus one individual being affected by another. Someone else training their prayer faster isn't going to affect me, while someone else being able to switch their gear more easily and not have to manually track freeze timers does affect me. And so these paradigms are the lines that other developers abide by, meanwhile you disregard them completely. That is my issue with your client. If Jagex doesn't care about those types of plugins then I would like that to be made clear so that the playing field can be leveled.
---
And those plugins you listed at the end are the ones I meant regarding automated input. I was also under the impression that one of your plugins automatically clicked to loot items on the ground over a set value threshold - but I've never used your client so I don't know about this exactly. Lastly, the plugin that circumvents the need for team capes also seems inherently broken.
---
Because it looks like shit, ruined an iconic area, doesn't make sense as there is a port right next door or one at Musa point. 
---
Part of game experience is how it looks. 
---
Drama? Isnt it more like just a bunch of complaining from entitled players?
---

I think the funny thing is people are upset that you're wrong but no one seems upset by the fact that for some reason the website counts "Skip question" as a part of the total voter base.
---
Yes, absolutely, it makes sense for him to have a rowboat in draynor but he should still keep his large naval vessel in the location meant for large naval vessels - A FUCKING PORT.
---
The point was to make the game fun again, not to keep it exactly how it always was
---
You can disable all the plugins in runelite and use only the ones you want to use you know.
---
Personally I have a lot of the plugins disabled and use it primarily for its ability to remember your game window resolution. Not necessarily an issue if you play on fixed mode, but if you play on resized it is. I also like seeing my xp/hr and my xp gained for the day and what not.
---
So yeah, you can disable everything it has and it'll act as just a glorified official client that remembers your game window resolution 
---
(as an example).
---
They added a single dock and a boat to the bay and moved an npc from sarim to lumbrdige. That is it.
---
da gam devlopers made unpoled change and ruind my nostalgick combat. its not the same anymor
---
The point is to use 1 inventory slot instead of many and to know when you get a konar drop
---
rip players cutting willows
---
They have low weighting though, so blocking them is not too clever use of a block slot, youll be better off blocking something like Hellhounds assuming you arent doing Cerb or Black demons if you dont have Demonics
---
You found the joke
---
The bottomless compost bucket was a very nice addition to the farm skill. Is it possible to know the difference between which bucket has ultracompost and which one is on supercompost? I bought 2 and i cant tell which is which without going thru a dialogue. 
---
I mean they never poll location changed with quests, right?
---
What the fuck.. wheres the harbor of limbridge?
---
Aw that's lame. Healing the dude and fixing barriers makes it an inclusive minigame. If anything, to balance, building barriers should be rewarded. It's attack and defense. Give and take. Yin Yang. 
---
I can't think of a anything more drama worthy than sticking an out of place ship literally half the size of draynor on its shore.
---
Clearly doctored, the Slayer Tower on the right should not be in draynor
---
sad honestly. i remember when people wanted a nostalgic experience of their favourite childhood game. now its just another cash grab mobile game looking to rake in those big fortnite bucks.
---
"major" is quite a subjective term here...... Adding a boat and changing a building sre hardly major
---
Is it really nostalgic when you’ve spend 18hrs a day for the past three years playing the game?
---
How about no 
---
Is this...bait..?
---
Fast RC XP?
---
Just set loot value to 1gp and the chatbox will tell you everything you need to know. It's not that bad.
---
You can disable the increase max zoom. It's an option. 
---
"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be"
---
Literally blows my mind that Veos being located in Port Sarim isn’t convenient enough, BUT Dragon Slayer 1 (A F2P QUEST) has revolved around the Port Sarim docks since 2001? 
---
Did you really re-upload an iDubbz video for 1.4k views, and also post it on a completely irrelevant subreddit? Then use a clickbait title in an attempt to get more views? You're pathetic.
---
Yeah and it's a cluster for no reason
---
\- Grand Exchange was in RuneScape prior to Old School's Release and it passed a poll.
---
\- I don't mind Doomsayer that much but could belong better else like Edgeville but I don't mind since it is a small NPC and not an entire building.
---
\- Hatius I do care about since he does not fit well into Lumbridge as he is wearing 3rd age. But it failed a poll so I cannot complain.
---
\- The Skill Tutors fit very well thematically and a great way to distribute skill capes.
---
\- Count check and Perdu is fine tbh.
---
After these small NPCs are not as big changes as whole entire buildings being put into the game being unpolled so it is not really a fair comparison.
---
Since when?
---
Oh that's nice
---
Port Sarim is 2 seconds away
---
Is this satire?
---
I used to use the free tele to pest control, it brought me pretty much right next to veos.
---
Well the real question is why it couldn’t just be in Port Sarim? The already existing port directly to the east?
---
they do it like they have a gun to their head lol
---
So you can predict the effect it will have on the game then? What will it do to the game?
---
Hardest part for me is personally finding time to designate a decent session. I’ve got 3 kids so it’s difficult to stay online for 30 mins at a time without interruption  
---
People speed run quest capes all the time I see posts about how fast they got it with a picture showing In game time from Hans. 
---
I believe there is a record of fastest max I’ll edit this comment and add if I can find it.
---
PvP takes both 
---
This just in, core community demands poll when maker of game adds a boat and renovate a small building.
---
Kind of ruins:
---
Glory amulet -&gt; Draynor Market -&gt; Ship
---
And as far aesthetics, it looks fine where it is.
---
Sweet thankyou man! 
---
I think its less important to look at just the amount of hours versus what the person sacrifices to play that many hours. If a person would just have done another entertaining activity, then it doesnt really matter. If they were giving up preparing for work, then they are actually addicted.
---
Best idea right here. Keep everything in Port Sarim -- you can go there if you like -- but have the row boat in Draynor which will "take you to the ship in the port" but actually take you straight to Zeah as well.
---
But where is Prince Ali rescue going to go? I can't afford 10gp to get to Al Kharid!
---
that last one tho, dont gib them excuses or ideas. plz
---
Puzzle solver, Menu entry swapper for bones and demonic gorillas are the biggest offenders imo but i think any plugin that gives 3rd party users a significant  advantage over vanilla client is an issue. This would include things like tile marker and clue scroll helper.
---
The actual qol things like chat history, hiscores, and showing world ping are totally fine and imo should some day be integrated into the official client.
---
Pest control tele would have been faster before this change
---
They'll riot for a day and go back to doing slayer tasks

Worded a bit negatively, but yah. We got close enough to the next tier that they gave us some of the stuff from that tier on a trial. But the poll system was always part of getting updates; it was either no updates and just bugfixes or updates with polls. So polls were always a promised feature; we just didn't get enough votes to guarantee it.
---
Group ironman isnt going to be even started until other major updates get done. Dont expect group ironman to be even able to get started in 2019 lol
---
A really simple thing to do would be to combine down different ships and simply allow them to sail to different locations.
---
The fact that you don't hear it till his head pops over the hill is phenomenal

the ability to put up with leveling up boring, meaningless, garbage numerical values on a database in Cambridge we call "runescape skills" is not actually a skillset in itself , but keep telling yourself otherwise l0l

I really hope they finally add Squeal to OSRS so I can just buy a max cape and finally kick this damn addiction. 
---
I'm tired of people asking me what games I play and I have to make shit up. I can't tell people the only game I play is a 20 year old medieval clicking simulator for children. 
---
A dock, sure, but it should be populated by small fishing boats, not a large ship that makes intercontinental journeys.
---
Trigglypuff
---
Dragons are supposed to be pretty smart tho... I honestly like the idea but I don't think it fits with the lore. 
---
All the different variations of the navy seal pasta beg to differ. Although, the original tendies pasta is good, lasagna would just fit osrs better.
---
Uhhh wtf
---
It's the principle of the thing.  If I'm going to do that, I don't see the point of even installing it.  Never you mind that any objection could then be met with, "You're not even using the client to its full potential!"
---
As I said, over the years the only feature I've ever wanted was the next change timer, that's been in OSBuddy for as long as I can remember, but I never wanted it badly enough to even warrant the installation.  The fact is, I'm not going to only use the plugins I want because I don't want any of them, I think it's very un-OSRSish to even have them.
---
Autoswitching prayers is botting, anything that creates any input is botting and should not be allowed.
---
I dont know much about the topic, but from what I've heard it would be an INCREDIBLE amount of work for jagex to create a client to the same affect as runelite/osbuddy since they would have to do it server side instead of client side, is this true?
---
Good. All 3rd party clients should be banned. We don't need EasyScape. 
---
Idk I mean those pros look very nice but the cons are just monumental...
---
I never once said those words, you did actually. It’s apparent that you don’t know how to have an intellectual, fact-based argument and instead resort to calling people trash and brainlet whenever you disagree with them. With that being said I hope you don’t cry too much next time you lose your spade in the wilderness. See ya bud :)

Tbh the game is not a historical site , if it tickles your rage too much find something else to do , the game enough is packed with nostalgia , let creators be creative.

1. Your progress is linked to your account. What world, or server, you're playing on just affects what players you're playing with.
---
2. The activity is just a dedicated world to that activity. You can do other stuff but if you want to, say, play Pest control it's best done in the Pest Control world because that's where most people go to play it.
---
3. Your progress is saved if membership lapses. You can't use member items (They're just called 'member item'), you can't use any of your member skills (They'll be grayed out on the stat menu), and can't go to member areas, but if you get membership again it'll all be available just as it was when you lost membership.

i like this idea,
---
With all due respect, this looks like shit. Make these sorts of changes to post-2007 areas but you can't just build a wharf in Draynor Square and put a big boat there and expect no backlash. Veos had a location in Port Sarim...if it aint broke, don't fix it. 
---
Conveniently ignoring the whole reason resizing would be a bad thing. Great job pal.

You sound very butthurt today. Maybe you need to level up a few more total levels on osrs to calm down since that's the only thing you're good at.
---
Yeah I agree its far from the most accessible skilling content out there. I do wish more people gave it a chance though, the xp:effort ratio is way higher than anything else for mining
---
&gt;Torstols (Herb) Buffed - Only liquids to make Super Combats: It's hard to believe people are making this error unintentionally, putting Torstols in vials, can we get a figure of the amount of sleep deprived players doing this?
---
It's not people clicking on a torstol then putting it on a vial of water. It's people taking their stack of noted torstols to the guy in Nardah along with all their other herbs and creating noted (unf) potions from them.
---
But there is a dock - loads of them, right next door at Port Sarim.
---
Anyway, a dock in Draynor could be okay, but it should be for small fishing boats, not large ships that make intercontinental journeys.
---
Well when OSRS was first implemented, Jagex said the membership fee would be higher in order to sustain the project since there would be a smaller playerbase. WE were the investors, man. If anything they should be paying us back tbh.
---
I've updated the post to reflect this.

Relekka doesn't border a pre-existing port and already has a fair amount of docks to leave on, meanwhile Port Sarim is 2 clicks away from Draynor yet they slapped a dock in anyway
---
The point was to make a good game. If it was pure nostalgia osrs wouldnt have a dev team
---
i can't take anyone seriously that is concerned about puzzle solver
---
Good luck getting THAT to pass a poll. 
---
I have thought for a while that adding weapon specific resistances and immunities to certain bosses would be a way of making them more intricate and would require more prep. 
---
Oh fuck off
---
I rarely do the same but the boat doesnt ruin that for me. There is a use for it, its not on the farthest dock where nobody ever goes, its in a city that gets a lot of early traffic, I like that theyre showing new players how to get to zeah
---
Refer to the comment you just replied to.
---
k
---
Yup, i was one of them. 1 click to throw away herbs
---
^(yeah but Varrock has a pub *and* a church. And Falador is the holy base of the white knights and also has a pub...)/s
---
how do i unnote them without opening a bank then?
---
And that’s perfectly fine with me. Two different people, two different views.
---
require 90 agility and 5 different grapple actions to get over the wall and I will support
---
There's a big difference between the first and second sentence. 
---
Shut up you babies, these changes don’t hurt anything or anyone except for your shrunken egos. 
---
Not everyone is all about efficiency, some people play the game for fun
---
Just add more ads for bonds, don't even have to think about new ways to mtx
---
Actually the best suggestion related to this situation.
---
I'd rather stab myself in the eye with a rusty nail than accidentally glance at the ruined lumbridge from the world map. Already changed my respawn location to falador and I will never risk looking at the world map again.
---
Can you please move the Make-All option for smithing and jewelry crafting to the top of the menu entries? I can see an argument be made for smithing to avoid accidents, but for jewelry crafting, most people usually take the exact amount of resources needed for however many pieces of jewelry they want to make.
---
Slayer with Superior Monsters unlocked is the best way.
---
Watch the video. He tells you. 
---
Better than leaving you with a crude chair and a rope.
---
While I get what you're meeting to say, I think a thumb tack would hurt more than a syringe (a needle, you mean) as those are actually sharp and meant to penetrate skill.  Thumb tacks r dull and not designed for that, so it would probably hurt way more.  
---
So failed analogy aside, ya blowpipes OP we all know this XD
---
So it introduces you to the NPC, okay. Could we not have been introduced to the NPC at Port Sarim where he was before, and achieved the same outcome? 
---
True my man, so depends what speed run we’re thinking here 
---
I don't think people care about the quest they just care about how it was added, they made a unpolled changed to probably the most iconic area in runescape. 
---
I personally don't care that much but I understand how it can annoy people, especially the dock that was added it looks very out of place.
---
No. There are 26 hours in a day 
---
There isn't specific userbase the game is/was directed for. What's the matter? You can do whatever you can with your life
---
because you never make mistakes  mr perfect 
---
stop
---
What’s the point of the poll then lol 
---
WAH WAH MY CHILDHOOD 
---
Grow up, you aren’t 4 years old shitting in a diaper anymore. Things change, suck it up. 
---
lmao you virgins need to get a hobby
---
Not necessarily.
---
Some ocd cases are about neatness but a lot of them are focused on really bizarre things like having to flip light switch exactly 20 times or excessive hand washing to the point that their skin is raw, or only entering a room with a step from the left foot while exhaling simultaneously.
---
It gets pretty strange 
---
Autism is a lot more common for the type of behavior where any slight deviation from routine or what's normal for the individual can just ruin their entire day 
---
My friend's kid is pretty autistic, and when he was younger, if he didn't watch jungle book when he woke up, he was just wrecked all day long.
---

Imagine being so shit at PK'ing that a freeze timer is considered an advantage. omegalul

---
&gt; What further limiting the amount of time you can just stand in game getting xp without interaction is an issue.
---
Atleast remember to use all the words your planning to, as now you're just furthering my point.
---
But just because they're changing the game in a way you like or don't mind doesn't make it okay to try and do it unnoticed.
---
Apperantly it was a big fucking deal changing the size of some magic icons when I strongly disagree, so you're the one who should get off your high horse.
---
I wanna see this lol send pics
---
Posted these in the wrong order... F
---
Well, you tried at least.
---
We'll take it from here citizen.
---
 Yeah dude running laws seems fun and interactive
---
BIG if true
---
And as my last argument, throwing a rock into a pond from 10 yards can be considered a skill. Assembling boxes in the top shelf is a skill. The main argument IMO from OP's point of view is that, it doesnt really take that much but its more about a time grind rather than skill based.
---
Now the way is being argued in this thread is "well can u assemble boxes in the top shelf, for 8 hrs straight, perfectly in a column?" Erm...? I guess not? 
---
Nice. Got any stats for dhl and tent whip?
---
No WiFi too, smh Jagex
---
I can't hear you, not listening. Lalalalala
---
Why....
---
haha ok im that stupid i guess ty :)
---
why do u guys like the house so much
---
True. Hopefully I made it better now haha 
---
Jagex just ruining their possible returning playerbase by confusing noobies
---
I'm sure we could have, I'm assuming they didn't like how he was tucked away in a corner of port sarim. I'd be fine with them moving him back if people really don't like the new dock, I just don't think the changes they made really deserve the complaints that they're getting.

AHK is completely against the rules, even for disabilities. I think it was Mat that said that. You can only use OS native remapping like windows keys. Any 3rd party, such as AHK, isn't allowed even if 1:1. I've been using it after the ban and never got a warning for 1:1 so I doubt it's on their list of players to ban.
---
Or just put in Port Sarim?
---
Sorry I forgot a question mark? How am I furthering your point? You are either retarded or insane. 
---
Yeah dude you can just fuck off.  I'm not arguing with idiots. 
---
Go into some of the older dev blogs.
---
I'm 10 levels off max and haven't touched Hydra. It's shit content catered to the spastics who used to sit at Zulrah and Vorkath 8 hours a day. They polled a quest then added shit somewhere it doesn't belong, it looks out of place it's that simple.
---
Jagex couldn't focus on a dot on the wall without going cunt up. Kieren wanted to change Graceful without even knowing what it did. Shit it will probably hit polls soon, and he's a Senior Dev, but sure believe what you want.
---
Right, but they currently can only use them on amulets I believe. And maybe setting it to allow only lvl-3 to work on rings would be difficult?
---
This isn’t even a joke, fuck Jagex.
---
So vials and jugs don't get in the way of the owner?  But regardless, only the owner can see all of the items they drop.  So if you vote no, you drop a jug you see it, nobody else sees it.  If you vote yes, you drop a jug it's gone 
---
If there was a viable solution it would have been made ages ago because these bots have been an issue since literally original 2007.
---
Jagex locked the anti fire shield behind starting dragon slayer but that only slowed them down so really there isn't much else they can do.
---
whooooooo fucking careeeeees it looks fine 
---
Do you really need that? Just use the camulet to get there.
---
Herbiboar is pretty nice. I fucking hate how they added two separate pets for hunter though.
---
Until players screen shot him in the same place at the same time it's 100% probable that he is just always where you are
---
&gt;I'd like to think the owners of the house had some extra cash lying around and decided to renovate and bring in a bit of extra cash flow. 
---
I personally am really sad about its replacement because it was one of my favorite spots. But thanks for suggesting this little bit of lore, it makes the change easier to digest :)
---
Cry all you want. This isn’t a game that is made strictly by the players. Just be happy they poke as much as they do.  God all you cry baby bitches. Get over it. I’m assuming you’re an avid high lvl player by the way you bitch. You shouldn’t even need this boat so it won’t even affect you. God damn kid. 
---
To ask if the person who dropped them should be able to see the items or if they should just disappear....
---
I guess common sense vanished with all of those ground items
---
Like they changed the surprise exam random so that you can now use any door lol
---
There is a certain spot you have to stand in, and sometimes your character will stop auto retaliating 
---
Slightly less noob here, I know about the status bars, but in my client they are ugly placed next to the tab and obscuring a part of the screen, how do I get them like OP here?
---
tiaras are for girls jk i like this but the one killing a demon was pretty damn funny

God damn ogre children becoming my speed boat from karamja during RFD ruined my immersion. shit game.

---
Nice bait, m8
---
I haven’t played RuneScape in the past couple of weeks, what’s been going on?
---
it's less about the house and more about keeping the old layout intact 
---
This made me laught. Take my upvote.
---
The devs can do what they want. They work for the company that owns the game. This game was not born from players who hated updates. It’s people who liked the style of the older game. Don’t play if this tiny update is gonna make you go cry. 
---
kthanksbyeeee
---
I legit thought I was dreaming. People defending their elite PvM skills. Just stop.
---
Per piece. It adds up.
---
Memories. Gained lots of firemaking levels near that house.
---
Is there a Zeah boat in tutor island?
---
The difference is that Zulrah and TBP don't overlap original content . I don't have an issue with new content being added so long as it's not replacing something from the base game. It's one of the reasons why I'm open to Zeah and Kourend since they take place on their own landmass separate from the mainland.
---
C
---
Draynor City.
---
The jab at pride events is pretty uncalled for 
---
Ur stats are garbage, kys.
---
Or move the house north and keep the pub where it is. It’d make sense to have the pub near the center of town
---
How do the boats get out of the dock?
---
nothing beats good ol field work
---
Lynx Titan
---
You're a little bitch, huh?
---
I couldn't care less, I don't see how this negativity affects the game. Nostalgia is getting ruined? Gimme a break, there is still plenty left that's the same to feel nostalgia.p
---
We could also stop bitching about a boat you only use once ever. If you've ever had to help a noob get to kourend for their first time, you understand how helpful it is. I bet most of the people complaining haven't used the boat since release.
---
NGL, there's often a lack of stuff to talk about with this game. "What did you play last week?" "Uh... I did some herb runs, got my fishing from 81 to 83, grinded out Pest Control, and did 100 Barrows runs with only two drops"
---
Hell, even with my friends that do play osrs I don't have a ton to discuss since we're both farming Barrows on our btws at the moment
---
You think you do but you dont
---
Pub is fine, dock in draynor isn't imo.
---
Unless RS3 changed how the cape works for some random reason, the way the game checks if you've completed all the quests is by checking your quest points.
---
It's too late for you
---
No answer what a surprise;)
---
True before I did poh ring I almost always used slayer rings for clues and fast access 
---
R/woooosh
---
No they dont. They keep them or reword them.
---

I'm not denying its more convenient. I'm saying that it's not better to fuck with iconic landscape for the sake of making something more convenient. I suppose you want an anvil next to every furnace as well?

Stupid question*

He suggested it in the main thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ao36az/i\_can\_live\_with\_the\_pub\_in\_lumbridge\_it\_doesnt/efxwuuf](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ao36az/i_can_live_with_the_pub_in_lumbridge_it_doesnt/efxwuuf)
---
Because it's old school, it doesn't remove old school content.
---
Well it's obviously not as easy as just copy and pasting lol
---
Snowflake ironmen is how the game really should be played. Its still goal-oriented, has its own challenges, and requires its own research. It's also centered around your own favorite activities because you make the rules. You can be as strict or as loose as you want with the guidelines of your account. It truly is a unique way to play the game, and if you don't have to use it to provide content to the community. It aligns with how noobs play the game when they begin, and isn't overly concerned with other peoples accomplishments and comparing to others.
---
oops suppose to say town/village.
---
Maybe give Veos a fancy looking, unique looking ship if they want to draw new players there. 
---
I'll bite, may I ask why pures don't need a buff? Generally these discussions devolve into me getting mass downvoted, but I'm always open to having these discussions.
---
That's the beauty of being a novice isn't it? To go through things unexplored. You must have the most methodical life possible to complain about something so insignificant. Infinite time to complain about infinitesimal problems. You don't have to tell me the time of day because time is not a construct for you. You just live in your own little universe and think that maybe your actions have no repercussions. Understand that even if this is late I didn't forget about you. This may not be the first or the last of our meetings. 
---
Same, gotta go riot now brb
---
I come from rs3, but you guys need to chill, this isn't that bad lol
---
This is obviously the right stance to take on this. Appreciate the quick response as this is further endangering an already endangered form of pking (tribriding)
---
I have to ask though **is this going to be hard to enforce?**
---
 I feel like this is one of those things where it would be really hard to be caught for since your not constantly doing it since their is downtime between fights/clicks giving variety too your actions. Im sure your all already aware bots like this typically fall through the cracks fairly undetected.
---
Some people go 400 dry, so gl.
---

---
Yeah the only reason I would notice is the red mark in my F2P quest list 
---
First month I don't have Amazon Prime in years. Real nice
---
im "against" rs3 because i like osrs more pretty simple lol. i like how simple the game is
---
lowqualitybait.jpg
---
Those are rookie numbers! 
---
Eoc literally changed the core experience of what made the game RuneScape and just turned it into another cookie cutter wow clone Korean mmo
---
No id actually be in full support of the second part of what you said. You were confusing realism and logic and now you're confusing nostalgia with resistance to all change. Imagine you grew up in Flint, Michigan as a kid. You go back to it after you've become a millionaire for nostalgia. Would you think investing in some water cleaning plants would ruin your nostalgia. Dirty water was part of how you grew up!
---
There's a line where you're ruining nostalgia and when you're preserving it while improving upon it. Restructuring port Sarim in a convenient way that gives Veos his own dock (tho I still really don't get why this is such a necessity) would not ruin anyone's nostalgia because it preserves the feeling and essence of what port Sarim is. It doesn't add something out of place or remove anything iconic. You know what is addinf something out of place and ruining nostalgia of an area though? Placing a single dock in draynor, a place that has never had any ships involved with it because there's a port right next to it and no traders have any interest in it whatsoever in the lore. 
---
[REPLY][NSFW] because pre-eoc Runescape is dead and RS3 is the murderer 
---
Could've been a normal pker as opposed to a RWTer's bodyguard, but I had a pretty unusual gear setup compared to the actual bots and they went after me but seemed to make no attempt at going after the bots.
---
I mean it would also make sense to dock it at the port fifteen seconds away
---
I don’t see how Lumbridge, or Draynor are “iconic” no one goes “yes! I can finally go to lumby/draynor” 🤷‍♂️. No body cared about them until an update that doesn’t affect the core element of either city. 
---
Says exactly what it means
---
????? Wtf Jagex
---
If players are too stupid to find Veos in Sarim then fuck em. Get this out of Draynor
---
Only one way to level it up.
---
Stay the hell out of NMZ. lmao
---
Postal about rs3 in 2007 scape.
---
Gr8 b8 m8. I r8, 8/8
---
I obviously asked since I’ve never made a “transaction” on the account and was wondering what it was 
---
That’s fine black boots are bis anyways
---
What do you mean what would happen? 
---
If they wanted MTX or to incentivize OSRS even further, pitiful upgrades to membership wouldn’t suffice. They make significantly more in real MTX, especially for cosmetic stuff. 
---
Ok the vast majority of people wouldn’t. I’d only done a few quests at that point and grinding out stats while afk made everything quicker
---
Not even that big of a change, it’s not like it gets in the way of doing anything that’s the point. Been playing since 05 and I really don’t give a shit about the nostalgia of draynor
---
they arent quests. They are scrolls dropped from monsters and some skilling methods that you can choose to go and complete.
---
Random clutter everywhere both visually and mechanically. Several skills that are almost identical to existing skills that could've been an extension of existing skills. Rare to see new content. Every quest has to be world scale instead of just helping a bloke out. Content tends to be time-sink based instead of actually entertaining. Things like auras that not everyone can get and have to be got from some odd store. Ugly cosmetics. More but I've gone on enough.
---
The prices would go up, and people would start farming said resources for profit. If it became a large enough problem, I’d imagine that Jagex would tweak drop tables to try and regulate the costs if it got too out of hand
---
Then the price increases. What are you asking?
---
I agree, Percy is a piece of shit. Gives me anxiety,  just trying to mine in peace not get all this bloody yelling all day. 
---
I'm sorry you haven't got any black d hides 
---
It's a cock tease 
---
i didnt ask how to level slayer
---
only when you're talking about afk pvm, even if it was +10 prayer bonus it isn't a stat anyone that knows what they're talking about goes for.
---
Also considering everyone flicks pvm content now it's weird that everyone is so concerned about prayer bonus pvp of all places which has never been relevant.
---

I feel like we have to accept the fact that runescape's older design is superior to the Rs3 design. 
---
OSRS started and was fueled by nostalgia but now, almost 6 years later, it's almost as if osrs *is* Runescape and not just some legacy server type thing. 
---
That's the revision, I meant server base. 
---
Thank you!
---
You know what worldbuilding is, right?
---
Port sarim should have a bank for members.
---
The november one lmao
---
When the hell is jagex hiring the runelite creators?
---
lolololol i had a guy literally think that he had all his money glitched and just randomly disappear, turned out that this dude had been playing rs3 for like a year and decided to play osrs and left all his money in the bank when he went to the ge and got pissed when it was all gone, this is the how the conversation went. 
---
\*me sitting at ge selling runes and shit\*
---
Guy:WTF
---
Me:what happened
---
Guy:all my money is gone
---
Me:?
---
Guy: i had like 20k gp and now its all gone
---
Me:well what did you do
---
Guy:idfk i just did a quest got the money put it in my bank and came here to buy a sword
---
Me:did you remember to get it back out of the bank

Guy:?

\*guy walks to bank booth withdraws money and buys sword from ge\*

Zero, because reddit always lets you down when you need it the most
---
I feel for you mean, I remember the fear of logging in and seeing a cake + trout in your inventory.
---
That thought haunted me.
---
Nice! Thanks for the info you sweet peeps
---
God damn. They got anyone partially moved into the regiment/CEB area? I know we (CEB) kinda sprawled our ass out living up there it seemed like.
---
Guess that's fair, Jagex does like to over correct literally anything these days.
---
Because people have blinders and are stupid.
---
They consider fury -- &gt;( +5 attacks, +2str, -15 defs) torture a good upgrade for 15m (it is). 
---
They also consider dboots --&gt; (+1 str, +2 attacks)  prims a good upgrade for 30m (it isn't)
---
But clearly bgloves ---&gt; (+2 str, +4 attacks -12 defs) Fgloves for 8-10m "Is bad" and "not worth it". 
---
Its literally the same upgrade as torture (including the loss of def stats) for even cheaper. I think half the cost? Its a great buy.
---
Ppl just have blinders on for the gloves/boots for some god damn reason, probably has to do with either 1. Prims are also fashionscape 2. Bgloves are so ingrained in them they don't wanna give them up. 3. Maybe physiological, like ppl consider bgloves "free" and have been for so long and thus paying anything for the hand slot is a huge no/turn off and thus "not worth it". 
---
Idk. 
---
Oh God I spit my tea
---
thank you for your opinion
---
Maybe instead put a port at Al Kharid or a little jetty on the river lum. This location is just strange. 
---
Unlock shamans for slayer
---

---
Agility isn't really even a skill. It's a convenience. It shouldn't be in the game. 
---
Well if it is something notable, they'd usually poll it separately. Like they won't add a new BiS item with a quest unpolled.... ^^^Unless ^^^it ^^^^is ^^^^the ^^^^^Ballista.
---
And I don't see the exp lamp question as slimy. It is asking "if we remove one reward, should we add another?". The alternative is to offer adding an additional reward whether it needs it or not, which is not great either.
---
Ok. 
---
Yeah was thinking about it for a while, and now I’m so addicted again I think I’m actually enjoying it more now I’m a bit older it’s a shame I don’t have as much time as I used to 
---
Assuming no def, f2p pking might be fun. Just keep getting strength and ranged exp
---
The nice comes after the tray
---
Imagine if the entire east side of Falador was redesigned when the rooftop course came in?
---
You'd lose your shit, even though 99% of things there are useless. Besides an upstairs clue, those houses are "pointless".

But they're "Falador".
---
wring its neck is how
---
It's literally in the rules that these clients are ok to use. I don't know where you got the idea that this is cheating.

they kicked everyone non-ceb out of those barracks even reg
---
i hate how accuratly you hit the nail on the head and the combat system in osrs compared to rs3 is insanely unforgiving when you are low lvl. mice are your targets at low lvls in osrs in rs3 its fucking swamp mosters
---
^^
---
yeah, for the most part. parity between it and black d'hide was the other side. the 40 def requirement didn't make sense for the difference between them being so small.
---
personally, i think the d'hide pieces should all have defense requirements like the blessed sets do, not just the chest pieces, but that would be "completely changing the meta" according to pkers, lol.
---
Rofl, not the same at all.
---
It's how the argument is used that makes it fallacy. When there is no evidence of the slope it is a fallacy, but there is evidence based on Jagex's prior practices. 
---
If hes using brews you dont need to waste cash on bastions the brew does super def anyways
---
In terms of the ACTUAL lore of Runescape, Port Sarim is not "right next door" to Draynor. It's more likely at least a couple day journey over. The game just makes them close together because it would be super miserable otherwise to get anywhere.
---
Lol, cause they added a platoon to each engineer company.
---
I think their TO is like 1200 now technically 
---
You don't need to be sprinting to attack while moving with any weapon.
---
Any chance I get for more free runecrafting xp i'll take.
---
reply "Runescape is my pussy" lololololololol XD
---
How about adding Ferocious Gloves to the Attack and Defense skill guides while you're updating magic and prayer? Not sure why this hasn't been done yet.
---
Jokes on you, it will be added without a poll
---
Veos isn't in the old Port sarim spot anymore...
---
It's fair to give feedback on ways to make the game look better, I dont think anyone is going to stop playing the game because of something like this (i mean, we still have the private server sore-thumb that is nightmare zone in the game and we've learned to look past it), but when it's been shown the mods listen to this community's suggestions it totally makes sense to tell them something looks a bit out of place.
---
Why the fuck does there need to be a dock?
---
Please, I’d like you to go through the clients throughly and make decisions on what is fair and unfair advantages. Even things like changing the use option on bones to the top instead of bury makes prayer training 100x faster and easier. I don’t want to feel like I’m at a disadvantage by using the vanilla client but I don’t want to use a 3rd party client. I’d like to see it toned way down to basically timers, ground drops and bank value. Probably a few others but even hunter timers and other skilling aids are too much. 
---
Fury to torture loses 15 def stats, gains 5 attacks and 2 str
---
Bgloves to Fgloves loses 12 def stats, gains 4 attacks and 2 str
---
Dboots to Prims gain like 5 def stats, 2 attack and 1 str
---
Torture is 16m. Fgloves are 8m. Prims are 30m
---
makes sense
---
Its not the loss of def 
---
Jesplox pls

as far as distance it isnt much farther to run for glory teleport.  This position is also closer for ironmen without glories to use home teleport and run less to get to this boat :)
---
It's a pub and dock.. No sane player would give a crap about this. I don't want 100 polls up about every little thing. 
---
And btw, micromanaging sucks. If you think devs are okay being micromanaged by a bunch of fickle, bitchy armchair experts, you're wrong af.
---
Damnit
---
Save me some time, how many pixels are there?
---
He's right nu male
---
gfd
---
New dock that has Veos there. 
---
Got dwh in the first 10 kills while hunting for fangs
---
Yeah. Nobody gave facts nor arguments nor sources.
---
Dock with Veos to go to Zeah.
---
Couldn't be bothered? You're still replying.

And I didn't say his disability didn't contribute. How can't it? It influences everything he does. He lives with it every day. I said that it wasn't the sole factor. My point wasn't to say his disability didn't exist. My point was to combat the negative connotation that's attached to it. You wanna keep insisting Asperger's makes you robot with no personality or life goals, be my guest. I'd give you the benefit of the doubt that you don't actually interact with people with disabilities and you're just operating on ignorant assumptions, and that's understandable, but you're coming off as an asshole. 
---
Ooooold buddy 
---
Let's pretend it looks nice. We should still care. We're addressing the integrity of jagex, the osrs team, and polls. 
---
Zerkers can do DS2. Its not that. 
---
Why do you spam chat in an instance?
---
1 in all other skills
---
###yes, you will be hacked or banned using a Runelite or a non Jagex owned 3rd party client.
---
If you need 2 teles to the same place, within a 10 second walk of each other, you're autistic lol. Where else in the game does something like this exist? It's just utterly unnecessary. They might as well add another Draynor bank in the wheat field east of the current bank
---
This still doesn't make sense. If you're sailing into the mainland from that direction why would you NOT dock at Port Sarim? Adding a new dock anywhere but the already existing port does not make sense.
---
that would be counter productive to new players :P
---
Goteeem
---
Why not go straight to 200m fishing?
---
OSRS only exists because we wanted our old world back. New content in a new place is fine, just don't significantly change old landmarks (I'm okay with the pub I guess)
---
fuck it move it to the wildy
---
"Content"
---
The upsetting part is that a major content change was pushed through without being polled. It brings into question the integrity of polls and of the staff.
---
why is everyone typing oldschool runescpae?
---
Ffs it was my turn to post this
---
Just because Zerkers can do it doesn't mean everyone will do it/has done it. DS2 has a lot of reqs, especially in Quest Points, and the fights are not easy. It is likely that most players will be 80+ in Combat Skills before DS2 so they can't use F Gloves but they could use Cerb Boots and Zenyte. That gives those items more of a demand because they are more accessible.
---
Yep. I'm at 70 def and I last for 6 hours with 5 super combats and the rest absorptions. Every 15-20 minutes drink a dose of scb and an absorb
---
Burthorpe games room should be moved to the top of the G.E. 
---
All those bankstanders would have something to do.
---
yea because there are no other ways to get to kourend besides the boat
---
It's in GPU plugin, mine's set to 5.
---
oh shit thanks
---
I'm just assuming but maybe they didnt want to rework all of port sarim yet and didnt want to crowd it even more 
---
I eagerly wait your reply in 3 months time. When your viewers may have doubled. To 2
---
How about we move you out of the game?
---
Probably referring to the Draynor Manor from the quest, via the boat in Lumbridge Swamp
---
900 hours? What skill are you training?
---
The higher the cb lvl the better the drop rate for shards, weigh that against the ability to kill them quickly and you're basically left with Nechryaels via bursting/chinning. If you're not bursting or chinning then you're best option is going to likely be black demons as they have the highest cb with the lowest requirements to kill while still being able to kill them somewhat quickly.
---
I actually like both of them. Zeah has plenty of low to mid tier content, and putting it in Draynor guarantees f2p noobs will see it. Burying it 3 level down the labyrinth of Port Sarim guarantees it will never be stumbled across.
---
This is true but you don't have to brew to up defence this way. Should be brewing as often as you're rang potting
---
That's not what people at Kraken think. This has happened to me several times today.
---
They'll say this was they're world, they were just banking. Or ironically ask why you don't go in the instance instead of themselves. You lose everything if you die in the instance so it's not worth it for Ironmen.
---
But I'm pretty sure there is an exhausted resource sound, at least for mining and woodcutting
---
If it's trivial then why can't it be changed? 
---
In real life plenty of houses have docks
---
Good point. 
---
Oh and btw! This isn't me complaining. I pointed out who the fuck would watch you? Not one complaint there.
---
A complaint would be stop posting this shit. Because 4 year old kill jad
---
Why do you think you're entitled to that world?
---
Then there are a few areas where it doesn't exist - such as motherlode mine.
---
Right, there definitely should be a limit. Where the limit should be is probably impossible to agree on but my take is that the interface should never be an impediment to partaking in the content. I'm thinking of the spellbook situation and how some people were opposed to it because it would make it easier to click on the right spell in combat. Would that really have harmed the experience of existing players? Or would it have just removed some artificial difficulty and made it less likely for people to be turned away by the outdated interface?
---
As for end game PVM stuff, crashing aside, it's not a zero sum game and it's a lot easier (and less tedious since gear isn't lost) to practice PVM than PVP so I don't feel that bad just telling people they need to "get good". Like PVP, I think potential PVMers' issues should be listened to as long as they're reasonable. Again, what's reasonable is open to interpretation and again, I draw the line on the interface getting in the way. The recent Vorkath poll is something that I think would have been a bad change since it would have simply removed a mechanic for no good reason. What needs to be avoided is keeping a bad thing in game simply because it's been like that forever and established players thinking that everyone has to deal with the crap just because they did at one point. I tried to think of one but honestly at the moment I can't come up with an example of something like this in PVM. 
---
In general (and this applies to all aspects of the game), I think the OSRS community has a huge problem with keeping crappy things crappy because removing them "devalues" the player's experience of dealing with the crap and throwing around "EZScape" is often a way to dismiss legitimate suggestions. I want this game to succeed but it feels like Jagex has painted themselves into a corner trying to appease so many different parts of the community while also not "devaluing" things. I will be very surprised if they can find a way forward without seriously pissing off at least one fragment of the community. Sorry to go off on a bit of a tangent, I've just had a lot floating around in my head regarding OSRS lately. 
---
You do you but I fuck them. 
---
Hey, that shortcut was a huge time saver the ten times I used it before I could use the rat pits teleport to get to Port Sarim when I had to glory teleport to Draynor. 
---
Instead, r/2007scape just mocks the opposite opinion with stupid memes.
---
RS3 has a dock in Draynor too bud.
---
shhh he brawn no brain 
---
This port is the most ghetto shit I've ever seen in my life.
---
Because people turn all their herbs into unf potions in one trip. When you are withdrawing all your stacks of herbs it's easy to forget that you should leave the torstols.
---
See, I actually can get behind this. This would be good. 
---
Whats his actual full username
---
Clear voice. Not confusing. No long intro. Great job man.  
---
Wow, It's been so long since I've visited the quest I totally forgot there was an instanced version of draynor manor. This worked thanks!
---
Should be investigated how they can afford it tbh 
---
To be fair that's a problem in almost every mmo to one degree or another.
---
if u can out dps the other person, then u deserve it, plain and simple, hell mod roq supports this, ur competing for resources and such 
---
Everything you see when you come off of tutorial island shouldn't be touched at all. 
---
yeah nah your both definitely over thinking it
---
Making things AFK actually makes me play the game more.
---
so tired of you whiny reddit fucks crying over literally every single update
---
just shut the fuck up
---
Not if you're an Ironman.
---
it wouldnt be doubling the speed, it would be making the speed of picking normal so they could fix the double pick bug
---
Zero death galvek here. Is he suppose to be hard? 
---
Shut up Serene
---
Ahh okay thanks
---
roflman
---
You get 30 days regardless?
---
So because one guy has a personal opinion means it's okay and not a dick move?
---
I agree. I do alot of hard clues. this one iseems to be the oddball. I dont have friends and I hate trying to find someone.
---
Quest remake
---
They can't even develop anything but their slayer bosses/raids updates. QOL features are completely out the window. I doubt we'll see text over drops on OSRS within the next 10 years.
---
diary's and more diary's lool; 
---
Quemake.

---
As an aside, in my opinion, you aren’t solely entitled to anything in the game because there’s no “spot check.”  It’s first come first serve.
---
like a fucking dog.
---
They could easily implement some form of Runescape chess
---
Don't know why they haven't tbh.
---
Unplayable
---
I know haha. He has confirmed it. Check the top comment in this picture haha. 
---
People who think polls should be removed clearly don't remember anything from Jagex's history of running Runescape into the ground with shitty, unpopular updates. If anything polling is one of the main things that has prevented OSRS from devolving into RS3-tier shit.
---
I mean theoretically, it should be as simple as finding and replacing the sprite ids per prayer and replacing them with the correct ones. For it to be harder than that would be just unusual.
---
These jagex mods are trigging my autistic nostalgia rage.
---
How dare u change muh childhood
---
mole, sara gwd, dks(range n mage), brutals 
---
I'm sure they're working on it just like how adding someone to your ignore list makes ur chat all fucky
---
Thats pretty cool.
---
Why we no have that osrs team 
---
Just like a real democracy!
---
runcraft slow
---
The reason it wouldn’t have a dock is because the port is literally next to it. Why no have airstrips a block from the airport after all it’s right there. Granted that’s a garbage example but still why move it? Why not just direct people to veos in port sarim? What purpose does it serve to take content that is in a thematically fitting place and move it to somewhere that it doesn’t fit? I cannot think of a single reason it needed to be moved, possibly it was too hard for people to find veos before but still the quest solves that problem by telling you where he is. 
---
still, and no one forced u to play that game  mode, like if i have a task, and im not interested in hopping and i see someone in the spot for my task say dust devils, regardless of whether they r ironman, norm, w.e if i see they arnt using the spot like ur supposed to, i.e bursting/barraging, ima take the spot, does it make me a dick yes, but thats how the game is played, its a game of the strong survive and the snowflakes melt away
---
Yeah, realistically sized maps, where it takes hours to walk between towns, would be pretty stupid and boring.
---
I mean I can agree kind of. I didn't mess with sizings and the transparency is broken too but imo I think it'd look nicer with better sprites
---
Thank god for runelite, wouldn't play the game without it.
---
Are people really autistic enough to make a f2p ironman?
---
Devalues my large ship only UIM.
---
Genuinely curious to know which jmods’ idea this was
---
What he said
---
The Culling has began
---
i didnt say it wasnt a dick move, i just dont care about being a dick
---
Yeah the bludgeon is better by a fair margin, even without counting the higher str bonus it's more accurate than the abby dag. That being said if you want to maximize your rates you should use bludgeon with the abby dag as a spec weapon.
---
Right.. receiving and implementing suggestions from the subreddit is one thing but expecting them to run all their ideas by *us* first? Haha dude, I would blame them for quitting their jobs.
---
Literally unplayable rn. Finally some good sense
---
No one has the right to any world. It’s free for all. If you can out DPS them then they’ll have to leave. Even if a person was at bank 
---
September hurts me
---
I would say that charters were not originally poor game design because previously hopping and buying from shops was not viable with the hop timer (which was poor game design). I do agree that moving away from shopscape is a good thing, so I would support changes that offer an ironman crafting method that is competitive with charters.
---
That being said, it really feels like a lot of ironman players are campaigning for crafting buffs not so much due to fundamental design flaws, but because they 1) want crafting to be faster overall or 2) don't want to engage in a 0 exp activity such as collecting sand. I think the notion that every activity needs to give exp is misguided, especially when the activity in question is part of larger process that does provide decent exp. Ironman mode is all about being self-sufficient and personally I think that comes with the reasonable assumption that you will have to go out of your way to grind some not-so-rewarding things to reach your ultimate goal.
---
I ask because it's no harm to do so, but frankly it's their world now and I'll hop if they want to keep it.
---
Here's to hoping less people go toxic apeshit over this, though.
---
Laughed my ass off, thanks
---
How do people play that much? I work full time and I barely have time.
---
Nice alt
---
Sorry, devalues my alcoholic ironman acc
---
Did the whole thing on my alt 70 rNge with 9 brews 2 rpot 1 stamina 18 brews. Used karils crossbow, as for the blowpipe i’d just use adamant darts. 2k scales/darts is more tha enough. Don’t forget to use your blowpipe spec to heal up.
---
So the bug should be removed why would we just buff something to mimic a bug
---
TIL there are RS novels and I want to buy them all. 
---
Thanks
---
I very much like the sandstorm idea. Obviously it makes getting sand easier for ironman, but I don't think that is bad. We still have to get seaweed and superglass make everything, then the actual blowing. Exp rates for glassblowing are not insane by any means, they are just solid so it is not like this is busted op or anything. It just streamlines an extremely tedious process into something more manageable.
