Does anyone know what the current best use for crystal shards is to convert them into gp? The wiki values for the divine potions is way off at the moment - cheers.

Go for the quest cape like I am. I just started again recently myself, and I’m trying to fullfill my childhood goal of getting that cape.

Lets you dictate your way of playing a lot, mixing skills and quests, and nothing feels too grindy or repetitive

People who don't play osrs anymore but still subscribe to the subreddit! Nothing to worry about! It was a great explanation.

This meme format is a little deeper than the surface level joke that it seems to be making. In a way, it's making fun of both the player on the right and player on the left.

Watching this series since day one and I have to say the fact that we have to wait weeks in between each episode makes this so much better. Even though hes saying that it took 40 hours or 200 hours, waiting the weeks in between just cements how much work hes putting into this. Great job man I wish you the best of luck, easily my favorite RS content creator.

1tick flicking to guarantee never losing prayer is more click-intensive than 3ticking anything lol

Why the new version looks well better
---
I thought it looked much more "crystalline" and fits the colors of the bow and shield
---
is there ever any point in switching prayers? i remember reading the wiki a few days ago and seeing that range/mage is purely 50/50 each time, but has anything new been found?
---
tbh I didn't think I'd care much, but I finished the new quest and tried Zolcano and The Gauntlet. I don't really enjoy either of those. It made me realize that I don't particularly enjoy PVM. Leveling up skills is what I like, so missing out on a new skill is an extra bummer for me.
---
New spec, tard rage?
---
Character overheads a "REEEEEEEE" before doing sustained dclaw spec for 4 seconds. Players can move 4 squares to avoid this.
---
Chop Chop!
---
Its like the hydra. It has a set number of attacks (4 I think) in a row and then it switches to the other.
---
Even without MVP rewards are most likely based off a sort of point system.
---
MVP is just an extra special roll and a chance ar pet
---
They could literally just move the pet out of it and it's be fine, people would still put in extra effort to get the extra loot roll(which is an extra chance at tool seed too)

I actually really love both version of prif, that is from rs3 and osrs. I like rs3s because I just think it looks very cool walking and doing stuff on all the crystal structures but I love the osrs version too for being more nature connected with crystals interspersed. Overall I'm extremely happy with what we got and definitely can appreciate amidst some of the complaints.
---
People didn't like it. Which is why we have the current one...

Maybe check the webside if it autofills your email?

No words for it. I just love you so much.

Oh cool! And which weapons/armor did you use?

I can show you this really cool new piece of content in the wilderness, but you need to bring 100m cash along to access it

Man... i'm still sad they scrapped the original idea of a tank crystal armour.
---
Yeah it would be a lot harder. I think that for all that extra effort, a slightly brighter shade of red on a cape isn't a big thing to ask? I'm not even a HCIM btw, but I see no problem with it.
---
okay now THAT is an idea I like.  Bursting Nechs would be so much better.

I miss my dreadnips, so OP pre nerf

This seems a little self-righteous.
---
I’m happy that exploring the game provides a source of fun for you, legitimately.
---
But most of my enjoyment of the game comes from optimizing XP gain - I’ve described it to friends in the past as ‘an efficiency simulator’.
---
And you know what? I have more fun playing the game now I did as a kid. So that being said, this:
---
&gt;Veterans here, think about back in the original RS2, nobody did the most efficient ways, and the game was fun as hell, and it's precisely because we didn't know or didn't care about being efficient.
---
is so lewronggeneration it’s comical. 
---
You can still play the game this way. Hell, you can still play it this way even *if* you google EHP rates. 
---
Just seems a little self-righteous. It would be like going on /r/Teenagers and making a post about how things were so much better in the 80s and everyone should just try living without their phones and ‘not getting so hung up on social media’.

Happy it works for you, but seems a little circle-jerky.

You’re good, I do zulrah with 80 mage/range and 1 def
---
Yes it is, with the Blade of Saeldor it's in between Vorkath and Raids 1, at about 4-5m gp/hr
---
Playing devil's advocate though, the Blade of Saeldor doesn't have a very stable price and it's unlikely to maintain that gp/hr in the amount of time it would take you to actually hit the droprate.
---
Ugh. Lucky. It was so hard to explain to my parents why I needed to be on a computer during holidays for those drops... the only one I was on for was the Christmas hat drop from my grandparents’ computer right before Christmas dinner. Sold that baby for 150k! (That was a big mistake, obviously)
---
That said I loved the idea of the drops rather than the holiday quests. Wish that would come back.

---
Jests aside, some updates are necessary in to be in tune with the times. I love all the new quests and most of the PvM as well. I'm on the fence about adding new skills, I think it could be a good idea with the right skill. (Personal opinion), I don't think any of the ones polled thus far have fit the bill perfectly just yet. Warding was the closest so far, though. Despite the way it turned out, I applaud all the hard work and perspiration that went into warding. This is really one of the best game dev teams out there and their dedication serves to make OSRS a very special game to so many people around the world.

Oh right I see - I suppose it could be done for the digsite pendant as there are only 3 options.

&gt; ...Also Mod Gee has shown these models on the Q&amp;A and on Twitter a couple times and there wasn’t no back lash, but suddenly once they enter the game everyone freaks out?

I personally don't watch the Q&amp;A nor use Twitter and had no idea the models were shown there.
---
You've got that backwards. Other companies are pulling their content from Netflix so they can try and use it to prop up their own steaming services, and Netflix is just trying to plug the gaps with their (most mediocre) OC.

It was this model update that killed og runescape for me.  I was a fashionscape socialite kid, free to play - so when they fucking *butchered* the look of rune armour (and thus all the trimmed versions) and the scimitar, I knew I was never coming back.

In 3rd party clients like RuneLite. It's still one of the main reasons I can never use the default client. They fixed zoom, they fixed mousekey requirement by adding all the shift functionality and make X interfaces. They added XP drops. The only thing they never will add is loot text on the ground, but chat notifications are decent for this.
---
Now they just need gpu rasterization and interface scaling and finally 3rd parties will just be QoL plugins and trackers

The problem with Hunllef isn't that they hit hard through prayer. The problem with Hunllef is that they hit hard through prayer and constantly hit through prayer.
---
I'm familiar to Raids 1 and 2. In any of those other boss encounters, you may be comboed out once or twice in a string of bad luck. If you compare that to the Gauntlet, it's not bad luck - Hunllef and the corrupted variant are incredibly accurate, every single encounter. Hunllef seems to output more damage through prayer than Verzik P3 or Olm, which is where the frustration comes into play.
---
I'm not asking to make the boss easy to the extent that it's not a challenge, but even when players are performing the mechanics correctly, it still seems that players are being wrecked. No other boss in the game consistently feels like this, aside from maybe Muttadile.
---
With how much it costs to use in shards you will hardly ever see the armor in game. Stop complaining about appearances. Same with dragonstone armor, rare and expensive and youll hardly ever see it in game

Have you done “the feud” tho that quest is so funny with all the Ali’s and the toilet jokes

Biggest stretch for the dragonstone armour. Yes the helm looks similar and they're both based on rune colours, that's it. The helm is a design akin to real world.
---
Tldr you don't care about the graphics and therefore everyone else is just overreacting and also shouldn't care
---
Yeah, I think that was actually a super dope implementation.
---
Exactly. Also OSRS (with its “bad” graphics) is way outperforming RS3.
---
So much for “graphics updates needed for game to survive” argument.
---
I've spent a while trying to find it, not having any luck.
---
It was definitely posted though.
---
So normal reddit shit?
---
here
---
That's very true, but between making things fit in the world, having the map be interesting, and having the models look good it's a tall task. And while the old models do look good, a lot of them are really plain. There are only so many ways to make armor using the old design technique before everything looks the same.
---
The new dragonstone armor already looks too much like rune imo. It looks nice (controversial opinion I know) but it's over the top. Why things like justice are well received and why things like dragonstone aren't is what the dev team needs to pay attention to.
---
We like new, but we don't like gaudy.

You’re literally going to kill yourself lmao, you’re not thinking this through—the idea is that you need to be paying 100% attention because all it takes is 1 mistake in Tesla’s autopilot to kill you.  If you’re only paying attention 90% of the time and Tesla autopilot makes a mistake every 50-100 miles you’re literally going to kill yourself within a 1000 driven miles on average.  Tesla’s autopilot is meant to be used to enhance your ability to detect its failures by removing the need to focus as closely on some of the more mundane aspects of driving; it’s significantly less safe than driving without an autopilot system if you use it the way you do (which is why GM and others in the autonomous vehicle space are already developing driver alert systems to start alarming if you aren’t paying attention to the road, in a similar fashion to seat belt alarms).
---
I’m coming up with 21 ranged strength and 82 accuracy bonuses to replicate a 15% strength and 30% accuracy increase in otherwise max gear.
---
A 15% damage increase is not the same as a 15% increase to your ranged str bonus. You have to add 64 to the actual values to get the stats that are truly rolled with. That’s why it takes 64 str bonus to hit exactly twice as high as zero str bonus.

Imagine not fishing minnows to 99 fishing.

First thing I noticed was the elf warriors next to my fruit tree. Would of been nice if they continued with the same original artist lol. Or like you said OP if they studied the original art to add on. Not completely re do and make it look too fancy or out of place.

The vote is not stacked in any odds. The most popular choice wins. Full stop. It's not a "pass threshold of 33%". If 40% say compromise, 38% say stay and 22% say old, guess what? It's being changed to the compromise.

Murica’ is bout to downvote your ass down to mexico
---
In a general sense, bossing SHOULD have regular drops just enough for you to profit some and supply drops to keep you going. They should also not let you teleport right to the bosses. Then their uniques should be what make up the GP/hr that makes it worth it, making you have shit GP/hr until you get a unique.
---
In this case specifically idk what the drop rate is and if it'll end up being worth it, but it's definitely a step in the right direction
---
wtf
---
I think we need to be careful about over-critising the artists. Don't get me wrong, I'm 100% against this new art direction, but we need to hold Jagex as an entity responsible, not the artists.
---
We don't know what their approval process is. For all we know, there was an old school style version of these assets which was rejected in favour of these new styles. Someone approved these assets to go into the live game and they are just as responsible as the artists.
---
We've sent a huge message to Jagex, here's to hoping for some change in the future.
---
Crystal shards have value to them as well, so it's not a blank drop at least. Each shard is 10 dust which is 2.5 supercombats which at current prices is about 25k profit.
---

Well if I told you I wouldn’t get the 1 bil would I
---
More then no but if you do you can always tele out, its also not multi so if you see someone you think wants to attack you just let the earth warrior keep you in combat until they give up. Your risk wont be worth them waiting around for but it might annoy them enough to keep hopping back to check if youre not in combat.

There was also rev hunting where we camped the wildi altar as our base lol
---
It was due to them changing the degradation effect. Crystal equipment always acts as if it were old imbued crystal equipment now. Due to this they had to revert them as they were no longer the same item and it was the easiest way.
---
Don't worry I derped and crafted a halberd back instead of reclaiming it, so I wasted like 1m profit of crystal shards by accident ahha

Right, you're not wrong. What i'm saying is they've already gone down the loot pinata road, you cant just flip a bitch and head back the other direction. It just doesn't work that way. Unless they significantly reduce the profitability of those other bosses, people will gravitate back to them once the hype of the new content is gone.

Nope. There was burger that had was third of pound burger that competed with mcdonalds? quarter pound burger. so you had burger that had 1/3 of pound beef fighting with 1/4 of pound beef. 1/3 of pound burger was cheaper too

Do you think what won?

You guessed it. it was &gt;!1/4 burger because math wasn't 1980's Americans strongest talent and thought that 1/3 was smaller than 1/4th. Oh by the way the A&amp;W's 1/3rd of pound burger won with tasting at customers when comparing with 1/3 and 1/4th burgers. Fractions were hard=lower quality and more expensive burger won= lower quality had more popularity !&lt;

Sure, this is the most common response.
---
To that I’d ask: how does that fit in with the idea of content needing to be ‘old school’? Is the essence of ‘old school’ itself not comprised of ‘incredibly boring skills like Herblore and Crafting’?
---
This is my point. You can’t demand content be like the old content while at the same time insist that our standards should be set higher than where the old content is. The two viewpoints are simply incompatible.
---
Either we get a fully realized, fleshed out skill that is totally unique - something that, based on the existing skills, is decidedly *not* ‘old school’, or we find an underdeveloped niche to add an ‘old school’ grundy skill. 
---
These are the options. What you are asking for does not exist.
---
If you think that’s wrong, feel free to correct me with some hypothetical skill designs that satisfy that criteria. But i honestly believe no such skill exists.

Somewhere in Kruk's dungeon.  The game would automatically make it impossible for about half of the playerbase to end up in your location.  Besides that if it's just 1000 random active players, many of them won't have access to the dungeon in the first place.

What's the point of "supplies" when you take no damage? Isn't a boss supposed to be challenging?
---
Seems like normal fluctuation to me. Unless there's a new mode released
---
Why did everyone enjoy the summoning update so much as well? All I see on here is "we want summoning" but when that first got released it was shit and made me quit. Did a lot of people start around that update? Because i played years before and i did not like it.

I'm talking about this comment chain lmao

A crypt rat or something would be cool if it semi permenantly followed you until you died or you shooed it away/killed it.

They're using our conservative polling system against us!

I played throughout my childhood and just did whatever I wanted, it was just a fun sandbox MMO. I only started OSRS this year and honestly I'm amazed at the obsession over XP/hr and efficiency. Maybe I just didn't grow up the same as everyone else but I still couldn't give less of a shit. I'm actually dumbfounded at how much people view this game as some kind of XP grinding prison, the amount of people I've seen who say they want to get maxed so they can stop playing the game is astounding. I feel like 99% of people playing this game have forgotten that it's a GAME and have no idea how to just be impulsive with what you're doing and have fun. 
---
I'm well aware that there are the "most" efficient methods, but I read what they are and I usually just think nah that sounds annoying, and do it how I want instead. I've always expected people view me as a noob for the way I play the game, I probably do nearly everything extremely inefficiently, but the truth is I'm well aware of what people THINK I should be doing, I just don't care and don't want to. I see some satisfaction in minmaxing games I guess, but most of the time it's just going to force me into a box that I'm not going to find fun a lot of the time. I've legitimately been really shocked at how people play the game these days, and I understand why people want to minmax everything, but I'm just kind of dumbfounded at how people recognise how unfun it makes the game sometimes but they keep doing it anyway.
---
I think it comes down to the fact that we all found Runescape fun because it was about setting your own goals and accomplishing them. But because of the years the game has been out, and all of us ageing to the point of knowing there's going to be an optimal route, everyone's goals are the same now. You don't really set your own goals anymore, you just choose from a set of pre-existing goals and optimal routes. Maybe it's just me, but I can't find games fun when I'm just doing what someone else tells me all the time. The game is much more enjoyable if you just maintain the mindset of not caring what the optimal route is, and choose what you find most fun instead. I can guarantee you most "noobs" and people like me have 10x more fun with the game than most people.
---
At least we get polls for shit like this. Have you seen the way other game developers like let's see.. Nintendo reacted to fans being upset about huge problems. Basically Nintendo told them to fuck off they wont change shit.
---
*Ryan stare* *nod in approval*
---
Swamp fan sad.
---
12 step meetings or a treatment center or whatever you’re willing to do. I had to cut off pretty much all my friends and all my guys now are in recovery. Some of em I even got to scape with me.
---
I firmly say that all accounts should start w a medium term goal of getting all medium diaries. It's not too hard and gets you most of the quests to barrows gloves.
---
It's just much easier broken into the small diary sections vs "omg i have 120 quest points left to go ugh"
---
In a democracy the population doesn't vote on everything, elected representatives vote on this they feel best reflects the desire of their continuance (in theory at least).
---
This method of polling everything is basically "Twitch players Runescape" but with extra steps.
---
If they have data that shows doing X would actually be a major QOL improvement for those brand new to the game, they should implement it. A quest obstacle shouldn't be causing people to quit the game, we're a small percentage of the player base and all represent a survivor bias.
---
Maybe you should try finding Ilfeen. Look her up on the wiki. She bounces between two areas outside of prif
---
I just reached level 61 ranged, and am gonna afk at the ammonite crabs for a while till 70. Should I be using a rune crossbow w/mithril bolts(not enough slayer for broad bolts), or a magic shortbow with mith/addy arrows? Thanks!
---
I see your point and agree, here's to hoping they keep the genuine OSRS style graphics.  If they ever do start wanting to update newer models I hope they give us a method to stay with the shitty graphics we all love
---
Ok but what about actual gameplay content and the lack luster uniques ? I'll admit the chat heads were awful and the memes were funny... But how is that a priority ?
---
Better wiped than striped
---
Really cool video settled but was it really appropriate to say "green n***** lizard and the electric wizard"?
---
Literally why I started my ironman. I was so annoyed that I'd camp zulrah and every unique would be "fuck yeah thats 3m" instead of "omg i actually got a blowpipe".
---
Now my irons higher level than my main lol.
---
999k isn't that rough. Maybe a few hours at absolute worst for people with mediocre combat stats or entry-level setup for some PvM.
---
27m+ on the other hand...
---
" Initially, Ilfeen charges 750,000 coins to re-enchant a crystal seed into a crystal shield. However, the price is decreased by 150,000 coins each time Ilfeen re-enchants a seed for a player, in the following manner, until reaching the minimum recharge cost of 150,000 coins: " 
---
I shouldn't have to pay again to re-acquire my shield that I already paid for &gt;.&gt;, i'm down 1m on a low lv iron. Quite irksome.
---
They mention that ‘his husband’ was killed in some war somewhere or other. I had to go back and check because I wasn’t sure. That I saw no one complaining about it on the sub meant I knew post people had missed it
---
You get the shield back free at the elf lady
---
Its u/uwutranslator
---
Could you imagine the "If I have to suffer so does everyone else" way of thought taken to quest guide videos or the wikia?
---
Imagine if slayermusiq "lol peace deleting my videos and not making any more guides. You guys are just leaking off my success".
---
Have you tried talking to her? I know that normally you decrease by 150k but I’d find it really odd that Jagex would make this locked behind Prif.
---
Tim is that you? You were supposed to cover my shift buddy
---
Shade robes are a f2p item
---
Is this if you have SOTE done? Or you're saying I can get it for free now?

you should be able to easily get more than 1 t3 wep and 1 t2 armor piece every time unless you mess something up during prep
---
either 2 weps or 3 t2 pieces is easy enough, sometimes both

I saw Settwed at a gwocewy stowe in wos Angewes yeshtewday. I towd him how coow it was to meet him in pewson, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bofew him and ask him fow photos ow anyding.

He said, “Oh, wike yuw’we doing now?”

I was taken aback, and aww I couwd say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and cwosing his hand shut in fwont of my face. I wawked away and continued wif my shopping, and I heawd him chuckwe as I wawked off.

Yeah this too. Though I imagine it does take a bit to find a graphical replacement as well, for the models that weren't preexisting
---
I need it
---
You should get the shield lost back for free. They did some changes to it that necessitated reverting it to a seed. No need to imbue it to prevent the stats degrading for example.
---
Oh, so once a bot is flagged it is pooled with the other bots and once they have a collection, a heat map builds and they just hop to the preflagged bots?
---
Ah, and which elf is this? Ilfeen?
---
In this game you really can just pick a direction and go, just pick a skill to focus on, or complete as many quests as you can. Quests can act as a guideline for goals if you're not sure, because they have skill requirements to start. So if you want to finish a certain quest, you can set yourself goals to train those skills to reach the requirements. You could focus on making money, just improving your stats, or whatever else you want. One thing I loved doing when I was younger even though it was super slow to level was construction, just making stuff in my house. There is no real path you have to follow in this game, you can set whatever goal you want and just go. If you're unsure I'd just pick a skill you like the look of and start with that.
---
True. And there's a LOT. Some are a bit over the top though imo. Still better than RS
---
You're at a severe disadvantage playing RS3 in Legacy, or with the Legacy UI. Not a solution when it's a nerf to your player. You also can't get the old visuals back, item icons, item aesthetics.
---
Very cool idea. I like that last part you said. I’m tired of learning cycles it would be cool to have to react over predict.
---
I mean, I saw them too. However we're talking about hundreds of upvotes versus thousands. I personally hate the dragonstone armour and the purple elves in particular. Mostly because side-by-side, they look (to me) like they literally used WoW models as a template, a game with a different genre of fantasy in mind.
---
I also think Mod Gee deserved some of those positive threads and she was getting a lot of hate around that time. So some support threads were bound to pop up no matter what. I very much enjoyed those threads as I found them more constructive (people talked about what they'd like to see changed in them, found a lot less "REEEEEEE" comments as those people probably clicked another thread).
---
I see a lot of people playing with the gambling bots at the ge. Can you get banned for doing that?/why do so many people use them?
---
Then what will we do during Destroy Dick December?

Im boutta do it at 72. I was nervous but not anymore
---
I’d love to give my reasons why I’m against warding but this is reddit and there’s zero discussion that goes on here, just a lot of arguing. So I’ll just take my downvotes and move on. It’s just unfortunate pro warding people won’t even listen to us. Oh well, at least it’s not in the game.
---
I agree with a lot of you that this game was in its prime and so fun in like 2010-2011 just before EoC which subsequently followed with solomons scam and squeal of misfortune etc. but between 2007 - EoC the only really bad update aside from wildy/free trade removal was the HD update.
---
The graphics got slightly better shading and rendering, but it didn't fit in at all. Everything just got covered in little dirty spots and shadowy to make it look more like texturised and glamarous. 
---
Minecraft came after Runescape, but that was the big mainstream game that had worse graphics than Runescape but was still so fun. It showed that even a game with terrible graphics can be so beautiful in its own way, and so fun and memorable at the same time. Legit OSRS players knew this since the golden era well before Minecraft, like if they changed the dynamic of that game so that all the graphics had to be texturised and fancier, I guarantee their whole community would lose their shit.
---
Bad/Classic graphics are such a good thing. Few games nowadays can pull that off. Runescape is one of few gems that actually did it right - it has timeless graphics because of how unique it is and the world it created as a result that even new players who never played with us back in the day can appreciate (Source: my baby brother plays and he's 9, and has played plenty of photo-realistic graphics games on PS4 and just started Runescape, he says he loves it, and in his words, "Why does everything need to look like real life? If it did I'd just go play outside". It's crazy how the youngest of us sometimes sound the wisest.

This fucking ugly

He said in the description some people helped him get through to that room for the cinematics, would have just used his main.
---
&gt;Can you get banned for doing that?
---
i mean technically "player run games of chance" is on the list of things to report people for but in practice nobody is getting banned for playing with them, no
---
&gt;why do so many people use them?
---
because they are fucking idiots and the thought of actually having to play the game for rsgp is simply too much for some people to handle
---
They can get creative. Weapons that have double uses, like the scythe could have had less stats than the current one but have life steal.
---
Nice
---
Yeah I agree. I don't like this armour, but I don't hate it. So that's a win for me!
---
Osrs is beautiful dude.
---
On what grounds do you KNOW they'll do it again? False accusations of a past of RS3 development? These dev's have stated and promised OSRS and RS3 will forever be separate because they learned their lesson. There is no formidable proof that these enhanced graphics will continue.
---
people vote, if you look on the osrs homepage there's an article that says "golden gnome finalists" and it has a link to the survey to vote. i'm not gonna bother linking it cuz you shouldn't trust my link anyway.
---
I'd save the dragonstone. You need 5 to unlock some content in the Forthos Dungeon, which from the looks of it to me would be good on an ironman. There's a prayer alter, a place to use bones for 3x prayer xp, and a leather tanner for when your crafting is high enough for red d'hide. If you have protection prayers surviving is pretty easy down there too.
---
Did you guys fuck?

Don't be a little bitch. It's just a picture

Dragon island near port phasmatys, opposite side of the clue scroll step. Alched 56k bows here and never saw a soul.
---
yea hey thats def my plan for doing crafting and prayer gotta get that range up first, and i thought it was more but dope ill keep it for that
---
cheers man!
---
But with rune at 99, how would that work? I would very much to like it to be reworked, but I have no solid suggestion for how. I've had some discussions with a friend about it, no conclusion. We debate ourselves into "fuck, idk man". Gonna need to bust out the Excel sheets for this one I think.
---
"What's best for the game" is such a vague concept though. Do you mean best for the company, for shareholders, the majority of players, the skilled minority of players, the casual minority of players, the new minority of players. A lot of things are black and white good and bad like partnerships, obviously no. That would be good for the company/shareholders but bad for the players. 
---
Like consider warding. Just a couple aspects of it; it would be better for the economy of the game to have an item sink. That would benefit the game and indirectly the players. But at the same time it would be detrimental to the players that don't want to do it. 
---
If you try to do what's best for the majority of players every time then eventually *everyone* will dislike it. The point of polls is to provide the community a veto to the developers. The point of *that* is to make sure people still enjoy playing the game.
---
aiming for a certain number per trip is kinda silly imo cuz in theory it's a basically 0 damage boss, so you can kinda stay indefinitely with average luck on pray/range pots.
---
i think it's most fun to go for record length trips every time personally.
---
Holy shit, the great audio quality is too much.
---
Cheers, and good luck! I don't have the time to try a hardcore ironman these days, hope you enjoy the experience!
---
maybe elysian can increase chance of being hit a 0 then 🤔
---
I'm pretty sure they move them all to a special world so no real players are killed as collateral damage.
---
Damn dude
---
the best thing about stealing creation is stealing other people's creation
---
I said I’m guessing the *pet is the only thing*, implying that maybe the shard and tool could possibly be mvp only. Never implied the pet... as that’s what the original post was already about.

Maybe he was doing multiple RC diary tasks in a row or something.
---
So Zulrah and Hardcore IM were the two biggest updates in terms of player base. (HCIM is debatable though as it was already trending before the update).

Rn all the late game smithing options are combining items rather than starting from scratch.

It's fine imo, just mess with other shit instead.

All the romantic chat options in the quest and then at the end when she &gt;!friendzones you anyway!&lt; was fantastic

When runecrafting was polled, V was the only player with the total level required to vote. It probably wouldn't have passed otherwise.

“Engine work”
---
I knew the comments would only be a bunch of quotes I don't understand with little context but I clicked anyway
---
It was like that before the update and I don't see anything in the update / poll saying it'll be nerfed like that.
---
I know what you're saying but some people really want to preserve certain aspects of the "old school" in OSRS and these small changes themselves are not the end of the world but without the backlash there's no way to convey to Jagex that they don't want things done a certain way
---
Diaries are annoying to do, and has overpowered rewards
---
I personally thought HD was best. I would love that crispness to return
---
Well I’m pretty sure he does a lot of the cutscene production for Settled as well. For instance the whole Verzik thing today was him voicing her which leads me to believe he was behind that part of it. I’m sure Settled does a majority of the editing but I think the cutscenes are J1mmy.
---
I don't think anyone legitimately making feedback is saying tick manipulation is bad. I think people are saying making it a required thing to do to be able to roll on a pet and get decent gp/hr is retarded.
---
I'm all for you getting 10% more xp/hr because your tick manipulating. But it affecting the whole teams drop and you hogging loot while doing minimal effort elsewhere and just abusing ticks to do more "damage". Nah fam, enjoy soloing.
---
A lot of the time those “people” are actually just other accounts run by the bot farm to make it look legit, FYI.
---
I'm not sure if you understand what the guantlet is. It's literally like 7 layers of RNG stacked inside a game where your damage is RNG. Of course it's a ton of RNG.  But there's also a lot of optimization in the method as well.

well i got 3 loots so i think i was, totally unsure though
---
RuneScape, specifically OSRS rewards player effort. You EARN your rewards from hard work and dedication, not giving up and sitting through the grind. The experience, the QP, Achievement Diaries, skills, skillcapes, those ARE the reward. 
---
If they started giving out stuff for free, you can bet there'd be a slippery slope waiting for them. Just another bullet point to bitch about in the posts on this subreddit.

Like I thought I was getting ragged by a bunch of elves that were hiding inside Prif when they rolled out in the rs3 gear

its possible but probably extremly buggy.
---
there was a osbuddy christmas thing where every tree was the event poh one
---
I agree the community can be pretty "reeeeeeeeee" when it comes to new gear and I don't doubt gear rewards/drops is probably the hardest piece of content to come up with for the devs that hit that "perfect" (lol) in between line of not too much "power creep" but not "dead content" but it definitely wasn't the community that dropped the ball on this or the reason why. 
---
The original idea for buffing the crystal bow was a quiver idea that made it better in __ way. Tradeable, rare, worth money, lost in pvp death always (so you couldn't rag even harder with it and crystalbow)
---
The crystal armor they proposed at the time was just super tanky, with no negative attack bonuses and had WAY higher range def than jusiticar. The community pointed it out. Later on they then released and update blog https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bmwewd/song_of_the_elves_poll_blog_ii_rewards_and/  with updated info/reward ideas they were going to be polling. They had scrapped the quiver idea entirely, changed the tanky crystal armor into range armor and combined the armor with the crystal bow buff. Probably due to being at a loss of ideas for the armor. It was pointed out by many that it was going to be crap, they ignored it and didn't address it at all, not a single comment and rolled with it. Completely missing the mark/point on the gear/upgrade. And now we have what we have.
---
I mean sure i can lazy flick but i cant 1 tick to save my life. Its a mechanic that helps you last longer in places and gain xp faster. However when it is an abusable mechanic that allows for people to lock down a certain boss for the best chance at loots and is the only way to get a pet that IMO is a problem. The game is not balanced around tick manipulation and never has been it is just an ease of access thing. Even the Inferno while everyone cried at having to flick the inferno is very much doable without flicking you just have to put in the 4+ hour run waiting for your sgs specs
---
Word thank you. For f2p is there anything better than silverlight? Blurite sword and iron scim have lower stats but idk if I’m missing anything.

I’m hoping you’re trolling. But just in case you aren’t, or others are reading this... you can’t bring any outside gear with you into the gauntlet

Theres a thread on one of these dragonstone hate trains where Mod West posts a possible revert or dumbed down version and its sexy af. As for the current state, the legs and boots are the only decent looking parts. Just my opinion though.

They bounce a lot of content off eachother for sure. But j1mmy's series is way more funny than swampletics.

I dont know a lot of lore behind the quests, even though i think its really cool (like the elven quest Line). Therefore i have to say Dragon Slayer 2 is my favourite with all the fights making me forget im even doing a quest.
---
Welcome back! The members game has changed a lot, but F2P is basically the same as it was in 2007. I would say make a free account and start work towards doing dragon slayer. In the meantime, browsing this subreddit and the [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/) are good ways to improve your general knowledge of the game. 
---
Youtube also has a lot of good guides, I think theoatrix might have a guide for returning players.
---
People tend to be very concerned with efficiency nowadays, but one of the cool things about the game when you first start out is that you don't know what anything is. I would say just explore, and set goals as you discover them.
---
Yeah but osrs released when everyone was over 13 xd
---
Whoa i missed this as well
---
I didn’t reply to a specific person as there were more than one bringing it up, so I just made a general statement. I get what you’re coming from, I just don’t agree.
---
From what ive seen its the helm and shoulders that got people upset. The helm is literally the ancient helm from rs3 ,osrsified. And the shoulders look like they belong in rs3 and don't fit the oars look. Which some could take as they are trying to slowly get people used to rs3 looks to try and get them back on rs3 ,in order to try and get them in the heavier microtransaction ecosystem.

I’ve been waiting for someone to say this.  I know for a FACT anyone who played in 2007 will mostly play this because it’s Pre-EOC.  Lumbridge and the rest of F2P is untouched for nostalgia, but stuff like Fossil Island is such a unique and well designed addition that adds fucking amazing content to the game that fits perfectly with the formula.

ER doctors in America are oath-bound to treat anyone and everyone, regardless of their ability to pay.  I'll add in the personal allegories.
---
Aunt had an ectopic pregnancy in England, arguably one of the best health-care locations in Europe.  They sent her home and told her it was just normal pregnancy things, refusing multiple attempts to persuade them otherwise.  Told her to just eat more seaweed for the nutrients.  My uncle paid full medical costs out of pocket to take her to a private doctor who saved her life (ectopic pregnancies require immediate emergency surgery and even then you might still bleed out on the table - risk increases the longer the pregnancy continues).  Luckily he's wealthy enough that it didn't *completely* destroy their lives.
---
Here in the US I have a couple of friends who routinely would rather go to the ER and get "free" healthcare and then just only take jobs that pay in cash and stay in shady hotels that don't even record your name and live semi-off grid.  Whenever they file their taxes the entire return is taken by multiple hospitals to cover long-standing medical debt that they just never pay.  Rather than pay $20 to go to the local clinic (which has a scaling pay-what-you-can model based on your income in addition to taking insurance) they'd rather go to the ER, get charged $500, never pay it, rack up interest, lose their taxes for the foreseeable future, rather than make the sensible decision because they don't want to pay the $20 on medical expenses *now*.
---
I have a family member here in the US who had a fallopian pregnancy.  She felt something was off with her pregnancy.  Went to the ER on a Sunday instead of going to church.  She'd have been dead by the end of the day if she'd been in my aunt's shoes.  She didn't have time to go home, get a private doctor, and schedule a surgery.  They threw her into surgery as fast as they could and even then she still nearly died.  Eating more seaweed... honestly.
---
Not all the doctors at the pay-what-you-can clinic take my insurance.  The one I go to now is amazing.  I went in with a cold and she knew I was getting my first sinus infection (never had one before in 30+ years).  She's not even a full doctor but a physician's assistant.  I was going to a different one than her with my first pregnancy.  That doctor didn't listen to me when I had concerns with my first pregnancy.  I switched doctors.  I had a missed abortion, about a 1 in 100 chance per pregnancy.  To put it in perspective, ectopic is about a 1 in 50 chance per pregnancy.  Like ectopic it is life threatening but not as immediately (you're fine until you aren't with missed abortions).  For mine (everyone is different after all) we had time to do two blood tests (a week apart) and schedule a surgery with my new obstetrician (the one my family member in the US goes to).  My surgery was an hour late.  The hospital gave me a gift card to apologize (free pizza ftw) for the wait.  They mailed me a card to encourage my recovery.
---
My insurance company swindled me.  Took my money and ran.  Paid my premiums to them and they refused to pay for my surgery after sending me a letter saying that the surgery was approved and that they would cover it.  I had to pay everything out of pocket and a few of the bills incurred by my surgery and failed pregnancy went to collections.  I paid zero interest to any of them.  I paid one collection fee (learned better shortly afterwards).  I've got records of everything.  I didn't pay what the hospital and doctors all asked of me.  I paid exactly what my out-of-pocket would have been if my insurance company hadn't swindled me.  One day those bills may come back to haunt me (there's always a risk some of the hospitals and doctors will decide to try to collect what insurance never paid but it's unlikely) but if they do I will have everything I need to sue the insurance company that swindled me and not only get my money back, but also damages.  I could sue them now I'm not since I'm neither litigious nor think a judge would listen since I haven't paid anything I hadn't agreed to.  The hospitals and doctors would need to sue them (and I know at least one company is already).
---
So with all this personal experience from the US healthcare system and the information from my friends and family I'd say that the US healthcare system may be more complicated but I have a lot more recourse when things go wrong and a lot more say in my treatment than I would if I lived in Europe.
---
My current doctor prescribed me something that rarely can cause lethargy and other dangerous side effects in nursing infants (if their mother is taking it) and I asked her to switch it to another drug that works the same but has an even lower risk of issues.  She went ahead and did it and if she hadn't, I'd have switched to a doctor that would listen to me (but she's a great listener and I love her and she's the best).  Here in the US, switching doctors is as easy as calling them up.  If you don't have insurance they take they'll often negotiate a price plan specific to your needs (my obstetrician was the most understanding of all my doctors with the insurance fiasco from my surgery and knocked thousands of dollars off of my bill while they work on getting the remainder from my thieving insurance company).  Not sure if that flies at all in the EU where your insurance is accepted everywhere *except* private doctors.
---
TL;DR the US healthcare system is a jungle, but it's a jungle that you can negotiate.
---
Can we get some more information on this? I’m saddened by this but want to know more about the guy

For those missing the mourner outfit it's better to use the slayer ring teleport to darkbeasts and kill one of the elves there as they will drop the already fixed version of the outfit.

Yeah I misinterpreted it to mean that the sub is 400k and only 1/4 of that was the player base. I though op was saying that with 100k players online, which is usually around what the game gets, that the sub was a lot of people who don't play. I think you can read it from both points but I understand what OP means which at it's core is pretty accurate that Reddit doesn't fully represent the player base.
---
500k ring selling for about 3m? Some sold for closer too 10m.
---
stop leveraging the mythical new players. rs is, always has been and always should be a niche game. forcing it to be like other games in any direction, monetization, gfx, mechanics, e-sports, player count, gimmick (first mmo to have an rts lol MA) has empirically and constantly, failed the game and it's dedicated players.

Bad luck my dude, lesson learnt at least hopefully haha if its not buying above price pick a new item.

The reason they don’t do stuff like this is bots and abuse. People will say it’s there birthday tomorrow for the freebies, irl it’s awkward to lie about it, online it’s easy.
---
Alternatively if it’s like one year after account creation your eligible and get a weeks mems for your b day. Bot farms owners will script the bot creation software so hundreds of accounts have birthdays coming up one year from account creation dates.

Saying it’s my birthday at subway might get you a cookie but you can’t abuse a cookie on that scale.

I mean, this kinda is his job. Lol.
---
Ye it's crazy that they thought who does the most damage mechanics are good like can you imagine if something like that was in the game elsewhere? It'd probably break the entire game.
---
Like let's say you went bossing and did the most damage on Zilyana, you got the drop and no one else did? That'd honestly be insane like hugely game changing and I can't believe they thought that adding this kind of mechanic to Zalcano was a good idea.
---
Ya i doubt the skiller/pvmers that are actually risking something wouldn't want that. From a pkers standpoint that would be nice.

This helmet is based on the Tyras helm which in turn is very spartan in it's design.

People like you are the lowest of the scums in OSRS. 
---
Low alch yourself.

Yeah, we tried that over in RS3, wouldn't recommend it. Would kill for that initial design tbh.

Why were they selling for so high?
---
That Koven track worked perfectly, music choice on point
---
Why are people expecting a fucking birthday present from Jagex it's a company not your family.
---
Your comparison is flawed. Think of it like this.. you go to bandos with all your friends. You are all guaranteed a drop from the boss but the person who does the most damage gets 2x drops for absolutely no other reason than they got better hits
---
Do some quests. It forces you to do all kinds of skills and most quests give out very good rewards/unlocks.
---
The northwest corner of the Shadow Dungeon. You need your ring to go in, and the correct paths to get further in the dungeon are directly to the east. Nobody has ever gone to the NW corner
---
Yeah, honestly inconsistency looks way worse than however dogshit the old graphics could look.
---
No, like 2 minutes per kill
---
Imagine it took 30 minutes to get 1 zilyana kill solo and 2 minutes with a 4 man team. And some random is sniping kills with  his tbow at twice the rate by using a pestle and mortar in between clicks. If were making up shitty hypotheticals atleast make a good one.
---
Lmao, go fuck yourself.
---
I agree, no one should expect shit I was just responding to the other guy
---
Cos those companies need to give you free shit to drag you back there, we're quite happy paying $11 to get a He back and they know it.

I'd prefer a system based on damage dealt than MVP, personally. Still rewards high performance, but reduces that feelsbad gap.

---
To be completely honest, as you've seen with our Twisted bow shenanigans, our map editing tools can sometimes cause issues we don't easily pick up on. 
---
I don't know exactly what happened on this one for certainty in comparison to the other though, but these things do sometimes happen especially when people are in the area doing other things.
---
Regardless if it’s marketing or not, free stuff on your birthday is still free stuff on your birthday.
---
Coloquially RS2 is 2006, RSHD is 2008, EoC and RS3 are whenever those happened

I can't think of another game that is as involved in the community as Jagex, they give us a 10% voucher worth of love every week leave em alone

It sounds like you are watching the wrong channels then. Try ones like settled, jimmy, links ocarina and raugh, etc.

They added it for shits and giggles basically. More so just to have a 1/1million drop.
---
I think they should actually have a slayer monster/Demi-boss/boss that drops an item 1/1million, unobtainable in any other fashion... people would be camping for weeks before the first item is found. Which would then sell for over max cash easily to a streamer
---
Changed shoulder plates and recovered the helmet plume? No, delete this ugly RS3 shit armour
---
What are some good quests to do to unlock slayer monsters?

what the fuck are they doing?????

Gotcha, yeah i did some digging afterwards looking for information. Do we know if there is a set bonus or anything to accompany the armor? Or is it purely cosmetic?

Well you still got 30+ hours left so don’t miss it too much

Red herring.
---
if you're good you can to get to the boss in 7 minutes and the boss itself probably takes a good 3 minutes if everything goes well. Typically a run takes 10 minutes plus and to be fair, it's pretty damn click intensive and you have to be decent a pvm, and even get a bit of rng in there to be successful.
---
Thanks for the advice, I have done quite a lot in the last month but I need to start doing more quests. My current goal is desert treasure. Been thieving at fruit stalls for the last 2 days and I’m almost able to start the quest.
---
Can we revert the new elves skin color? And preferrably get some reworks on some of the models as they are hilariously different than 99% of the game. Also how is such a major graphics update to existing characters changed without a poll?
---
 Pizza hut only ever gave me heartburn, and a sense of money not well spent. Jagex makes me work for spending my hard earned cash.
---
Congratulations on a good Song of the Elves release.  
---
Can the art direction of the game go more towards the style of the new Hosidius rework with more "realistic" looks, instead of trying to make things look "HD" in Old School?
---
This is true I tend to vote no for a lot of things.

Because he made 7m per hour. This obviously needs rebalancing. It needs a point system, and tick manipulators should get more points. But right now its completely broken that in a giant skilling boss mass where 20+ people are contributing 1 guy makes 7m per hour and everyone else gets 2.
---
By being slightly ahead of the second place guy, you get a massive increase in profit due to the all or nothing nature of the mechanic. Instead, people should be rewarded relative to their actual contribution.

Entangled, tbed, fire surged like a 25 into a 70 ags

Well... If you're doing it at 10 hp *maybe*. But you're probably just as likely to die while thieving cake stalls. I introduced a friend to osrs and he was able to do waterfall quest at 10 hp without any complaints then he died to the lost tribe quest.  That's why I said they shouldn't have changed it but it really was not as big deal as people are making it.
---
Ok well ignoring the specific items on the table and just referencing the gph of vork vs gauntlet. If you think vork needs nerfed rather than gauntlet needing buffed that's your opinion but I'm just saying in terms of mechanical challenge gauntlet is much more difficult of vorkath and is worthy of being a good money maker relative to vorkath.
---
shift click walk under and easyswap are only features i use... its really same as runelite with like 10 extra features nothing too op like runelite+ has
---
Lmao imagine trying to flip but having no patience
---
Depends on what route you take, if you want to get 99 fishing by doing barb fishing before Wintertodt then you would want to do Waterfall for 30 strength with 10HP.
---
I don't think DPS matters at Zalcano. Unless it's been confirmed?
---
that's not an argument against him, just a lazy personal attack.
---
he's right that the boss is boring. most things are done at fixed intervals (i.e. imbuing and throwing tephra) and if it weren't for the random sources of damage then you could just hop to an empty world and basically afk solo it.
---
it's a definite improvement over wintertodt but still more repetitive and cyclical than all current pvm. part of the reason is jagex has a shitty base of skilling content to work with -- you can't really do gear switches since there's not really any skilling gear, there's no real skilling equivalent to prayer switches, and perhaps the only truly interesting skilling mechanic -- tick manipulation -- is something that they reasonably do not design around, because it is wildly unclear to the uninformed player and was not an intended game mechanic anyway.
---
jagex has neglected skilling for so long that making a skilling boss is like trying to build a house without a foundation. there are no skilling mechanics other than running around and click-and-wait because they've never put any effort into developing skills.
---
better but not waaaay better

I have high level friends that help me financially if I need it, (lucky me right) so money making isn’t my main goal right now. But I have got woodcutting to 61 which I enjoy doing so once I can enter the woodcutting guild maybe I can make some easy money that way.
---
Im not kisinformed lmao I did it myself. Tb does not block the mage. Idk what you smoked but you're wrong.
---
The problem is that Jagex changed EXISTING, iconic elf graphic models that have been in the game since 2004-5... Without a poll... that’s the heart of the problem.
---
If they want to make new content and try to make its graphics match 2007? Fine. But don’t mess around with existing models.
---
I think RS3 has capes for years played, perhaps they should play that.
---
I never know if that's the fail rate of tripwires or if that's caused by us clicking "the other side" of the tripwire and thereby walking over it.  I could get behind them making the click radius bigger for those.
---
kinda interestingly, granite is 3t but uses the same clicks as 1.5t teaks afaik. 1.5t granite would be insanely cool though

Lol at the downvotes. Last episode ended with him saying he was going to be at swamp lizards so by that logic Settled spoiled his own content.
---
You're legit arguing mobile made the game easier? Yikes.
---
Of course there is. You can't tick eat against certain monsters. Or tick manipulate certain situations. Why not? They were designed that way. Anything you run into in osrs That's bordering on world record (solo ToB, low combat inferno, Barbarian Assault speed runs, Woox walking, etc) is people figuring out how to use tick manipulation to their advantage and you're arguing that Jagex didn't intend for this?
---
I'm pretty sure it's ment to only be used at bosses and not ur to go weapon for slayer
---
Nobody ever puts their car in neutral during start stops (even though you have to during driving tests) you just hold the clutch in and when moving really slow you just balance on the bite point. It’s exactly just like lifting your foot off the brake a little in the automatic the only difference is we’re controlling the clutch. Not the car.
---
I siad he lost rank 2. Lwarn to read my dude, that means he had it then got bopped.
---
I'd assume it matters else the people tick manipping wouldn't be getting more loot than others. So the amount of damage done to zalcano during the mining phase plays a major part in the loot system.
---
Yeah thats the design philosophy, still is extremely difficult to keep running

You cant now lol unless you roll back and im not doing that fucking quest again lmao
---
But why was it change in the first place?
---
fucking crybaby shut up did rs3 abuse u or something kid stfu not even looks like rs3 coz in rs3 they have more pixels/ different engien / lighting changes soo nothing in this game can ever look like rs3 on this version of the game. its imposible
---
Oh so another game does it so this one should too I see.
---
Did you know that your crosshair is static in a shooter? Always in the center? A shooter and an "Aim booster" are simply not the same concept.
---
This isn’t even funny, just bringing down his own game and being a dick.
---
Huh?  Why would it not be equal loot?  If two people are doing 1.5t and say 2 others are doing it normally, the two 1.5t'ers have equal chance of getting it assuming they both do exactly the same damage (which is unlikely due to RNG) then it probably allocates MVP to the lower ping player? But that's probably not something that happens often if at all as 2 players will have different RNG meaning one of the 2 1.5t'ers will have done more damage than the other, which is sort of what this and a lot of games base things off of.  
---
The 2 people doing it normally have 0 chance, so they are less effort = less reward.
---
First of all, some people absolutely do. People get on here and argue with me all the time that that's what they do. Especially in /r/motorcycles. It boggles my mind, but you're wrong if you think nobody does it.
---
And secondly, that's exactly my point. You have to sit there and clutch-in during traffic. Which makes it more work. The person I was responding to was suggesting it wasn't more work. I was demonstrating how it objectively is more work.
---
But as always, people jump to absurd conclusions on reddit *shrug*

Can the frog slippers from beginner clues function as flippers when underwater?

JMod confirmed on reddit that the obstacles in the elf quests were made easier by mistake and will be reverted.  Is there an ETA on when this will happen?

Or people just want everyone to get MVP loot?
---
Never said that, just gave an example of a game that does offer these specific rewards.
---
Considering she probably doesn't do it for over an hour, and I don't pay for everything every day, maybe 1k xp/$5. Not ideal.
---
Jagex is really trying to ruin their game again.
---
Just to answer your title, everything in f2p is a waste of time. Even f2p quests can be done 2x faster since you can use stamina potions and better teleports in member worlds.
---
I'd say with that amount of hours it's probably likely he's counting multiple accounts and sometimes playing more than one at a time.
---
That's a lot of words for you to admit you were wrong while refusing to acknowledge that fact, and instead shifting your focus to their QA testing team while making sure to insult Jagex's team multiple times.
---
Mvp hunting is done by hopping to worlds of 5 - 6 players and 1.5 ticking to ensure you get it. The results of that are on the left, on the right is standard loot from participating in the mass.
---
Don’t have to have so many stones imo. Maybe dragonstone belt, bracelets, maybe around neck on chest. Less is more.

Pizza Hut still profits off of you buying something with a coupon. Jagex giving you a birthday present doesn't earn them any profit.

Correct which is why I will always be against that. I’m here for gameplay, graphics don’t really bother me. I don’t get troubled because of a chat head. But I get it though so I’ll say let it go to a poll should elves be purple yes or no? And if everybody says no then fuck it well have regular skinned elves.

This goblin boy doesn't know that you just need the hard diaries done, wow!

Swamp man good
---
Yeah I’m of the personal belief that pvm should never be consistent money. It should be a loss until you get a unique and make your money. Should be a risk/reward situation. Blade will never drop below 90m, no matter how many charges each crystal drops.
---
You need tickher skin if you think that's toxic. I'm sorry you being called out on twisting rality to fit your narrative annoyed you this hard.
---
Mining, Fishing and Woodcutting will be quite a bit faster in P2P depending on what you do. You can still powermine iron quite efficiently, though, especially if you're not banking it.
---
You can do cooking to 70, maybe a bit higher, without too much loss. The primary benefit in P2P at this level is cooking gauntlets.
---
Combat skills, especially melee, there are a bunch of F2P options that are good. Just have to find a quiet world, I guess! Ranged can be a bit slower because you're missing out on knives/darts, but it should be fine until level 50 or so. Prayer is easy to level just from combat, at your level.
---
Magic is a very good option in F2P, as there really isn't too much of a difference in training F2P or P2P, especially at your level. If you want maximum AFK, look into splashing. Otherwise, go for something like Superheat Item, and later, High Level Alchemy.
---
I don't really know about Runecrafting for sure, but the main benefit you'll be missing out on in F2P is easy banking methods.
---
Smithing and Crafting can definitely be done on F2P. Some P2P methods are significantly faster, but also a lot more expensive. So unless you have a ton of money to spend, you might as well train them now, as they won't be much faster in P2P anyway.
---
Those 3 skills you mentioned are fine choices, you won't be losing out on much experience compared to what you would get in members.
---
Fly fishing at barbarian village is great experience, and I believe you can cook on the fire there for some cooking experience while you're at it. Chopping willows is respectable woodcutting experience and you can save the logs for fletching (or get 50 firemaking first since that unlocks you Wintertodt in members). Mining and dropping iron is one of the fastest experience methods for mining overall until a very high mining level and in f2p the only problem is that mining spots tend to be crowded, but if the spots are open, you'll get plenty of experience.
---
Probably bonded up his alts to vote no on warding because he doesn't want to bring another skill /s
---
You know the wilderness ditch? And how they've polled to remove it multiple times? I think we need to add another ditch for every level of the wilderness.
---
But seriously, I have no interest of taking any real risk into the wilderness, it doesn't matter what they add to it. I haven't even set foot into the rev caves. I doubt I'm the only one.
---
If they want to update the wilderness it's fine by me, but don't expect everyone to suddenly want to go out there with risk.
---
Because he liked the base game, I would imagine
---
If I were to hide on a place accessible to all members, assuming everyone is searching very throughly, and I'm found as soon as someone sees me (no need to be on adjacent squares), probably would be inside one of the largest runecrafting altars, because most people probably wouldn't look there of forget you can look in there, most obscure ones like body a lot of people don't even know where they are, and just happen to be carrying the tiara/talisman is so unlikely too, they could just walk near the altar and not even consider I might be in there.
---
Hey there! Actually, once you read closely I'm sure you'll realize that it's not like Summoning at all. Neither bred/captured animals nor companions follow you (unlike pets/summoned creatures) and the perks are specific to a Ranching location (ex.: increased production for that location). In fact, it's much closer to Farming than Summoning, with the introduction of a few unique drops.
---
Full void would be nice cause it's just changing the helm slot but it's a grind to get it. So honestly just your bis melee mage and range gear with prayer pots. Watch a quick barrows guide it's easy as hell and I'm preeeeety sure your fine to do it.
---
Faster kills on packed worlds. Just the MVP will be hard to get, but people seriously aiming for it will probably also be on quieter worlds so they have a higher chance
---
We have already seen with the discord pictures that the jmods assumed making underground pass easier would pass so they preemptively implemented them. 
---
This is one of the intro quests into the elf series, so making it easier was definitely in their intentions. But they will deny it and say it was just a fucko boingo and reddit will eat it up because jmods.
---
[Blade of Saeldor](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blade_of_saeldor#Charged), the new BiS slash weapon and Crystal armor/weapon seeds.

Really cant scrap it now. Its going for like 50m, and the only way to get peoples money back is a roll back, and I'm not feeling SOTE a 2nd time.
---
The game is definitely better if you just don't interact with the community.
---
Ironmen had it right all along.
---
Yeah I’ve played for 15 years and ima be honest I don’t think I’ve ever not used a good. So I literally couldn’t imagine it lmao. But yeah it’s just an obnoxious quest. It’s easy but just fuck, Ana in a barrel.
---
This was supposed to be the mining equivalent to Wintertoad, aka basically a team minigame, it's kind of shit solo'd because it's not scaled, and you don't get pet roll if you're not MVP.
---
More like imagine only the player who did the most damage at castlewars got the tickets, or only the one who called the most times at Barb Assault got points, or only MVP at raids got a roll on the drop table but solo was a garbage way of doing raids.
---
I’d say so, gearing up I might forget my rock hammer when jumping to a gargoyle task, or maybe I forget my soul barer when going to a cave horror task. A single item on an entire gear switch is enough to cause a quick trip back when ultimately I was trying to get in and out of the bank as quick as possible.
---
If you honestly think this then you have no history with the game nor understand why polling is essential to the integrity of it.
---
Yet again a form of PvM gives like x100 more skilling loot per hour than actual skilling..
---
Yes I know it's a skilling boss.. but training the actual skills becomes more of a burdon due to the ridicilous low amount of gp/h it yields
---
This is stuff that matters,  not fucking chat heads.
---
Look at Mr.Elitediary over here.
---
Holy freakin entitled

Unless he plays on his work. And a 12 hour shift is pretty insane. But I don't think he played that many hours anyways.

Buy some alch items, do some agility while alching.

Haha I went from LoL -&gt; WoW/HotS(rip) -&gt; here.  Ironically part of what brought me here was seeing posts on r/all and thinking "hey this community has some quality memes seems like they enjoy their game"
---
But I like to just stand there with blank expression.
---
Yes. Ans this applies to all tick manipulation (mostly). We choose to tick manipulate ticks because they are already the fastest, and tick manipulation improves it further. We choose to tick manipulate barb fishing because it is already the fastest, and tick manipulation improves it further.
---
In Chambers of Xeric, the "Push boulder" shortcut allows us to click and path through the obstacle once it's been moved, but the "Cut tree" and "Mine rock" shortcuts require you to click to climb over the obstacle instead of being able to path through it once it's been cleared. Can these be made consistent with the "Push boulder" shortcut as a QoL update?
---
They polled to skip it not make it easier.
---
Ring of duling to use the Clan wars free for all portal after each kill and youd probably get 5 minute trips in. Will 2 prayer pots realistically to start. Magic level being higher would be a big advantage
---
Balloon animals, Mime show, maze, evil Bob, and classroom are ones off the top of my head I know for a fact aren't instanced. Most of the OG teleport random aren't instanced but I can't think of them all.

They drive on the left in the UK so I guess this is the same principle.

we already have like 8 trims, something new would be cool

This is literally the realization I had two years ago. Never made a better decision to focus on my business and not grinding.
---
Bankstanding strikes me about a week before I lose interest in the game.

I legit do not know if I'll ever have time to play like I used to, so all that's left is to buy my herblore and run into the endgame sunset.
---
&gt; Where is this content located? Would this be an addendum to construction, as in the pastures and stuff would be additional rooms in your house? Or would this be an open world skill, where you have various ranching plots spread about similar to how you have various farming plots?
---
The **Environment** section is the one you'll find interesting! Each location will be accessible in the main world, exactly like Farming patches. A major difference is that much of the content will begin as bare (yet fertile) land that needs to be built upon, from the main pastures where your herd will grow to the upgrades that will provide various perks. I'm personally a huge fan of evolving environments (I *love* when quests, diaries, etc. lead to a change in scenery, showing you how the world progresses after you've spent time in it).
---
&gt; Additionally, what are the effects of various rewards like the Venomous Telson, Draconic Essence and Charms? Are some of these crafting/smithing materials to improve existing stuff, or for new things altogether? I read that charms were jewelry, but which slot and do they have stat or additional effects?
---
To be perfectly honest, I haven't gone as far as designing each of these items precisely. I've tried in the past to balance items with regards to their requirements and taking into consideration existing content and the scenarios in which they'd be most likely to shine, but I'm never as good as a whole community. This goes back to the idea that Ranching is still an early concept, with fully built tables to show how the skill could scale, but basically no polish yet.
---
&gt; I like the general theme of the skill, and I really think the untradable aspect is a very strong incentive to train the skill.
---
Tutorial island. Second floor of the church.
---
Those are cosmetics.
---
Blade recharging is expensively prohibitive as a reasonable option for anything really, even more so for armours, as each hit recieved degrades it once. So they degrade even faster than weapons.
---
On top of armor stats being trash, it's just a cosmetic. Only reason to get them is for fashionscape on female characters tbh
---
But seriously though. It doesn't really matter if you learned to speak all languages of the world or got good career. You can't take them with you once you die. We all have just one life and for that reason I don't see anything wrong in using your time doing what you like. The only reason people obsess with work is because of the indoctrination by the rich who want you to waste all of your life making more money for them.

i agree
---
Thanks a lot! I would rather try out F2P nowdays since I used to have a membership back in the day, and want this time or ”playthrough” to be a bit unique to the other ”playthroughs” I’ve done. Thanks for the tips and recommendations!
---
Iven seen ppl making 5m in 1 hour no need to be an engineer to see thats broken
---
Not sarcasm. You should be. I've accomplished a lot on my main including an Infernal Cape, but I physically can't picture myself playing an ironman effectively.
---
Time  should remain so it gives an element of making the right choices all i ask is they make the rooms not retarded so that they actually make it easier to collect what you need instead of going 6 rooms north 6 rooms south to find the same rooms and fishing spots far away from spawn. It's frustrating for sure. Boss hitting through prayer should be a thing just not hitting fucking 20s though. Combat pots in mini game would be nice or even just an accuracy boost would help greatly.
---
There are plenty of people like him.
---
There aren't enough people who can critically think and say, "hmmm, he seems well informed, but I don't know enough about the topic to say for sure." Or even bother to fact check. How many people do you think know 0 about art, read that comment, and googled any of the words?
---
Instead, because it *looks* like he's informed, people automatically assume he is. He literally said himself he just added polish to make it stick out.
---
And when the Mod pointed out that all his examples are from 2002-2004 (which at least in part invalidates his argument), people just doubled down and claimed West couldn't take feedback and just wanted to be right.
---
Lol dude spud lord looks like a piece of shit asshole. That haircut/facial hair for some reason screams wanna be "alpha"
---
Sorry, didn't realize you were just being dense.
---
Perhaps they should. Most people who hate rs3 unconditionally haven't played it at all.
---
Right, but the base game is long past.  There's a couple people like this in my cc too, who constantly bring up how bad Jagex is and how much they don't trust Jagex.  A new poll blog will come out and they post in discord immediately trying to find issues with it.  Like there's feedback and being passionate, and then there's just being an continuous outflow of negativity.  It just begs the question of "why?"
---
Fight lower level enemies?
---
Skillers aren't people confirmed?
---
i guess you are right, im sorry
---
Alright, so starting new is what I have to do then anyway, thank you for the tips and suggestions, I’ll try my best! :)
---
Go buy a str ammy and upgrade your armor
---
I was the same - I also one shot Galvek but died on the fights leading up. I can't remember the fights anymore now lol but I think it was 2, maybe 3 deaths towards the end. I think quest vorkath might have killed me too but I'm not sure ansmlre, if it did it was just once
---
too long for me to read but fucken hell congrats on this thesis of a post.
---
If that was true then people wouldn’t be complaining about mvp. Hint: it’s not true.
---
The feel when I’ve played since 2004 and I’ve never been ”hacked”. You guys either use sketchy sites and/or botclients. Can’t come up with anything else.

Tl;dr: Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

I'd like to think he was rich enough that 27 mill is not much of a risk
---
Look, I think there's a pretty clear and distinct difference between the original art style of osrs and the new art style. I can't put into words exactly how it's different because I don't have a background in art and design, but anyone with eyes could see the difference.
---
There was never a poll to change the original osrs art style to this new one. Therefore,it shouldn't be a matter of everyone's different opinion on what the ideal art style should be. It should just be the original osrs art style.
---
If it's really as vague as you claim it is, they need to have a in depth discussion with the community and set some sort of ideals/guidelines/limits that the community agrees with in the same way that they've done in the past when it comes to creating content.
---
If it's vague, then it's their responsibility to try to define it. The playerbase's responsibility is to try to help them define it in a way that they like.
---
&gt; ...there used to be several dialogue options which caused the chemist to destroy your plague sample if you chose them
---
Yeah; there was a choice to be discrete, or straight-up say you had a plague sample.
---
If that's removed, wtf?
---
You can easily do it, just whip the tunnel for 100%, mage the brothers and range ahrims with rcbow... Iban's blast or slayer dart for the start, then upgrade to trident after mage 75
---
Are you perhaps thinking about Zalcano?
---
Can more NPC's get left-click pickpocket options?

This would be for regular pickpocketing, **not** Blackjacking.

yeah I think he went with option #1

Moss guardian isn't a new NPC, it's an old one from the quest Roving Elves...

My personal opinion, make the helm maybe styled more after a veracs helm, and add a bit more pl8 to the legs, reduce the amount of gems as well.
---
no it is decent gp/hour and the best herbs get up  to 600k/hour
---
thats probably why the playerbase has gone smaller year by year right? dumbass

coin share ruined that economy because of how it was implemented. With the way it worked drops were essentially alched for their ge value.

If i recall if the players all killing the boss were in the same group chat, and they switched on coin share. If the main boss item drop For example a weapon from God wars was worth 500k GP for example, they would all receive an equal coin split. So in that case each player gets 166666 GP.
---
Honestly it was just a thought that came into my head, but another comment explained why its not in play
---
Is it possible make an option for the slayer helm to change betwen all of the recolors? Players have to unlock the recolor and obtain the recoloring part to add it.
---
To overcome an issue of players that have 2 3 4 recolores helms , there will be an npc which will combine the helms, of you do not have multiple helms you will have to pay in whatever currency the dev team will choose to add another color to the helm.
---
Yes i am. Thank you for noticing.
---
Ya I forgot Graceful also helps. I replied again to someone else but without graceful and lower agility the experience from this quest is one all players should have at least once xD
---
I like putting it in the slayer helm a lot
---
Agility, then mining, then runecrafting. They're the most annoying to get to 99, and they also give you a fuckton of money without any inputs so you can efficiently do all the other skills with a big budget.
---
They came out and said that while it exists due to a bug, they like it and want it to stay. That literally makes it a feature, not a bug.
---
Everyone bitching about the look of the game. If you ask any modern gamer, is that the graphics be high quality. Just because YOU like the older style graphics doesn't mean others do too.
---
...
---
I fuck with jimmy johns too, the delivery is clutch as well
---
What if it had a helm design more like veracs? A bit bigger than a typical full helm, kill the bright purple plum and make it dark like the secondary colors, and remove a few of the gems? Add some pl8 to the legs too i guess.
---
at this point, I think Jagex is just trolling people like NMZscape and tbh I'm loving it.
---
Could we get a notice board on the side of one of the buildings in Edgeville, close to the Wilderness ditch?
---
This notice board would be, "THE LAWS OF THE WILDERNESS". It will state every unique property/interaction that exists within the wilderness, for example (can't teleport past 30 wilderness, can't teleport past 20 wilderness unless with a glory amulet and other items, unprotected untradable items will turn into coins on death past level 20 wilderness, untradable items will break on death under level 20 wilderness and will need to be repaired, dropped items will become visible to other players immediately, on PvM deaths your loot will be visible to only yourself for 1 minute instead of 60, special attack orb does not work, and all other unique properties of the wilderness etc.)
---
This is all vital information that should be accessible in-game. Upon entering the Wilderness (or first time only), you will get a warning suggesting you to read "The Laws of the Wilderness" noticeboard in Edgeville, this warning can be toggled off.
---
You can find my name on the So_Wreck3d petition too. This guy is tryna flex so hard. He might even have an account from before email logins but it’s pretty obvious he hasn’t played consistently until recently.
---
A looks the best
---
Yeah they did. And if you read you would see I disagree with them getting rid of that risk. However, the risk is very small. A new player would not have a problem beating it even on a hcim and I speak from a lot of experience here. More than probably the vast majority of this thread has considering I have several accounts and I have helped several new players through it at level 3. 
---
Also, pretending that I'm saying it was a good risk to remove is taking away from your argument.
---
Some what frequently, though, I do get the no drop kc where it still gives you a drop but isn't stated in your chat box and its always something really good.
---
Yes record it, and I want to see it be the exact same account shown in your pic. Do it
---
Game devs made it a mechanic when they said its here to stay. That turned a bug into a feature. Literally.
---
You would group with other players and if there was a drop it would automatically be put on the GE and the GP split between the group members, minus some tax.
---
Then people would just get ddosed again
---
damn! I got mine probably 6 weeks ago..might want to send some emails?
---
All this does is increase its speed? You go for full crystal which ups the damage. You go for the quiver if you just want a faster bow. Combine both and it's pretty straightforward.
---
Jagex should remove runes from their droptable they add it to everything even when the boss has nothing to do with magic! it's ruining the prices chaos runes for example went from 98gp each to 85gp within just 3 months..
---
or lets just put in the current rs3 death mechanics. You die you get a 30 minute grave and spend a % of the value lost on death to reclaim the items. You die at DKS in max gear? spend 100m to get ur shit back
---
People have different opinions, I like the set I like the color purple, and I like the tyras looking helm.
---
It's all on the wiki :) Obviously that's not as good as spotify but it certainly is better than just in-game :)

---
What does this question even mean
---
&gt; The one person in CoX who consistently gets the most points would earn significantly more than someone who is leeching.
---
The person in CoX with 0.5% more points earns 0.5% more rewards on average.
---
Ye 5k death runes is a lil much maybe lower it down to 1.9k would be more in line with the others
---
I'm personally in the camp that "unintended game mechanics" are fine if they don't grant you a direct competitive edge against others and are fairly simple to figure out. Prayer flicking is easy to figure out independently, I'm sure we all at least had the notion that it would work when we were 12 playing RS back in the day. While it gives longevity to a, say, bandos trip, it doesn't give you a tremendous advantage in securing a single kill. Some dude competing for one bandos kill still has equal RNG to get that specific kill regardless of prayer flicking (assuming the same gear, etc).
---
In my eyes tick manipulation is different a bit. It's not very easy to figure out tick manipulation, in fact it took the community much longer to do properly than prayer flicking. You can't expect an average curious player to even know it exists without specifically learning it. I still think it's alright in skill training as there's no significant detriment to others around you. They aren't being affected by you being efficient. When something so unintuitive *does* affect those around you by yielding tremendous advantages is when it becomes an issue IMO. Just my personal take.
---
In my poh and turn off guests can enter
---
Thats so great :D had me confused out of my mind too
---
Obsidian fences and two pools, this man's living large.
---
Are you suggesting one of either, only the person who does the most damage gets the loot or the drops scale from the most valuable player to the least?  Because the second is what it is now and you've just called it incompetent, and the first would mean only 1 loot/world which I don't know if anyone wants.   Also if it doesn't really do it, no one would be doing 1.5t and there wouldn't be people getting angry about it?
---
I agree, I wish they would rework all the monsters that shit out 3m/hr.
---
idk how many more loot pinata's I can take...really about to hang it up.
---
Since warding skill has not passed, what will you do about the content you created and the items that would come with warding skill? will we see them implemented without the warding?
---
Glad they're just reducing it and not giving full immunity. Having gauntlet runs be "get 2 weapons as fast as possible -&gt; go to boss and do mechanics perfectly to avoid prepping food/armour" would have been lame.
---
Speak for yourself braindead.In 2012 the armour and weapon updates/god wars rework were so bad I had already lost motivation to play before eoc
---
That sounds fascinating, do you know where they said that?
---
As one commenter said, It looks much better. Maybe just downsize the gems a little, they're a bit much. Especially in the knee's.
---
/r/woosh
---
Do you mean using !kc in chat?
---
Yes it is
---
The problem is that you're eroding a foundational skill in pvm for the sake of "integrity" which will make the game even more rng based. Half of Woox's or any other players' incredible achievements in pvm are some form of tick eating and one tick prayer flicks. Getting rid of these unpolled could be a mini EoC.
---
Im not the biggest fan of the shoulders, and i dont like the helm at all. Def shoulda kept the dark plume on the rework though. Too each their own though!
---
why spend many money when few kill do trick
---
They do. They give their most profitable game the most resources.
---
Just because you keep ignoring my question - So whats the maximum reward to effort you would accept then? 
---
If you want more rewards, put more effort in.  If you don't, wait until the minigame has died out and then go try it out.
---
I updated my ? It was unclear but no not that
---
How dare they try to update the early 2000s era Java graphics. This is a slippery slope jamflex! I want my game to look like shit damnit, stop messing with it.
---
/s
---
Just buy urself the infinite tele crystal
---
Provides zero argument for why this should be changed. Good discussion lol. Likely only wants it cause he saw a guy in expensive gear die next to him
---
add a way to nosedive to the bottom of the path from the wizard hat pls
---
I wonder what happens when 8 people all ring each bell in one world at the same time... :)
---
Fleshstick good
---
The blowpipe is more than enough to get it done. A higher range lvl is really just gonna make the process of getting to jad 10 minutes shorter tops. I say once you get 75 range and have a decent cash stack for supplies go for it!
---
This is why I think if it was added to the game, instead of removing the item and turning it into coins, it would be auto-sold on GE for the highest price offered at the moment and then the coins split between players. If there's no buy order for the item within +-5% of the guide price, the item itself would be dropped.
---
Ok to be fair, let's also note that literally everywhere that tick manipulation is available, it is promoted to get you more exp/loot/pet chance.
---
Who's we, you do not speak for the community, I enjoy the dragonstone armor, I find it nice.
---
Can we also not forget all the scouting bots?
---
The problem is that you're eroding a foundational skill in pvm for the sake of "integrity" which will make the game even more rng based. Half of Woox's or any other players' incredible achievements in pvm are some form of tick eating and one tick prayer flicks. Getting rid of these unpolled could be a mini EoC. How crazy would it be that jagex did not learn from their past mistakes.
---
In an economy such as Runescape, if I use prayer flicking to kill more bosses an hour I will indirectly affect other people killing those bosses by making the loot cheaper so I don't like the argument that this is bad because it is "detrimental to other players" when that could be said about any "unintended mechanics".
---
Amazing username lol.
---
Must... stand... around....
---
Big doubt.

Damn that’s awesome!
---
🦀33$🦀 (3 accs) For this deeply touching expirience, I can't find other games that provide such plot twists and emotional rides.
---
Thanks jamflex
---
I mean I can agree with that. 
---
A road map of graphical changes would be nice. Updating bits and pieces based on chunks.
---
I really liked monkey Madness and Ape Atoll, except where you escape the prison and need to go through the tunnel
---
There is a spirit tree in Priff already
---
Yep.  Logged in during the first week of OSRS too.  Didn't make any meaningful progress til mobile came out and I could afk my combat stats with my phone at work.
---
the chaos rune drop in price is linked to the drop in price of onyx due to more of them in the game rather than from the chaos rune drops themselves
---
Fuck agility, but it was so worth it for the herb runs.
---
That and I believe that bgs spec will reduce more defense levels typically because dwh reduces a flat 30%. So 2 dwh specs would lower 109 levels. Idk what your levels are but figuring you're max strength you should hit pretty high with bgs, idr the max, sorry
---
I few years back, I completed Underground Pass with 9 agility. You could say I was a giant idiot or a masochist (or both).
---
Try doing corrupted more then. Honestly the normal gauntlet is fine where it is. I found little issue with it. It's the poor balance in corrupted that is where I'm mostly complaining
---
Since you are ok with the CoX system, how about just a system with rewards proportional to "points".
---
If they need to balance the Crystal Bow around 2 different buff items, it is harder to balance the Crystal Bow. A speed increase is a big deal and with it, the current Crystal Armor set would be a lot stronger. But do we really want to add yet another item you need to use with the Crystal Bow instead of improving the armor? This idea originated before the Armor and the OSRS Team knew of the Quiver but went with the Armor instead; trying to add a Quiver on top of that is needlessly complicating things.
---
&gt;Pizza Hut still profits off of you buying something with a coupon.
---
??? How do they earn profit from an item they are literally handing you for free while spending employee time and resources (both ingredients and operation costs)?
---
There’s a concept called customer retention and the goal isn’t to make profit from an item while giving it away for free - that’s impossible. The goal is to “remind” the place exists and to encourage you to come back when it isn’t your birthday. 
---
Jagex could easily profit in the long run by giving away even a week’s membership to people on their birthday. It would work on luring back ex-addicts so well it might even be considered unethical.
---
Her face actually creeps me out knowing what she did
---
I did 30 kills yesterday for a total of 2,1M. I was MVP once. I'm 74rc and 75 mining. 
---
What team size do you normally play with, because my kills was from 4-7 people team, so that might have something to do with it?
---
probably magic in order to be able to tele around the game. The most annoying thing early is not being able to get anywhere. Either get 45 magic or complete ardy easy diary in order to have easy access to that half of the map!
---
This way of looking at it is far too reductionary. I think leisure time is important, but if all I did was leisure I'd contribute nothing to the world. Most jobs, even if they make money for your employer, affect other people in some way. Me being proudtive means my impact on the world is higher, which in my opinion is what makes life fulfilling. Even if I had the means I don't think I could live entirely for leisure, and I'm sure I'm not alone in that.
---
Very minimal at best. Depending on how heavily they nerf it will dictate how much food you need going in to the boss. You're already going in with minimal food, it's just a question of actually fishing the food versus rng drops.
---
Gonna make it easier for casual runs and people still learning the gauntlet though.
---
Except they probably would
---
Which means the game is protected already so why all the 'reeeeing' at proposed changes?
---
I always run out of prayer after like 20, but I'm using a bp and not flicking at all
---
No but I'm also not blind
---
I never said it wasn't, only that tick manipulation exclusively now is a competitive meta and yields higher advantage at Zolcano than prayer flicking does at other competitive bosses.
---
Uhh I still hate it, I'd like to see some community submissions like how we settled on a design for Justiciar armor.
---
Ddosing was a huge issue, there was a clan that openly talked about having a Zybez staff member on their team who would provide IP's from anyone who used their site to post an item for sale. They would lure the guard in Draynor and knock you off when you aggro. 
---
They would also scout gwd and knock people or even worlds offline to kill pvers and collect the loot when they die.
---
$925,000 at $25 an hour. 
---
Oof.
---
As another mentioned, scouting bots are worth a mention
---
agreed
---
Yep same issue here. I first thought it was because i was 6 way switching but im not sure now
---
Here's what I recommend to anyone new to pking. Start with a fresh account, do vampire slayer, and then train attack to 30 and str/range to 40. You'll be a low level with very little risk so dying doesn't matter. As with anything, starting with the basics and working from that is always the best idea.
---
Exactly, so why not improve that then add yet another item into the mix? Also, the original Crystal Quiver was way better designed than this version; it lowered the cost per shot while buffing the damage while this increased speed and raises the cost considerably.
---
Really like this. /u/JagexSween
---
were you around then? it was awful, ddosing was huge back right before they introduced the new death mechanics. if you did dks or gwd frequently you got ddos'd, thats just how it was
---
That would be amazing
---
It's incredibly unpopular, as nobody is willing to vote Yes to the "Big Ticket" items necessary to make that style of loot table work. So instead all your get is alchs and resources only bots collect the proper way
---
Better, but still bad
---
You can go via the underground pass I think.
---
Yeah you could do it easily
---
That's actually a great idea, which I didn't even think about (which is silly, since farmers actually somewhat fit that role by taking in payments to prevent crops from dying)! This is why I believe that if OSRS is every to get a new skill, it will have to be slowly co-created by the community as a whole and not simply polled in its finished state.
---
I think he means all those free birthday shit other companies give you means nothing, so we dont need to expect jagex to give us something that means nothing as well.
---
Gosh, I thought the right one was the reworked and I was like... they really missed the mark

---
Also constantly shitting on RS3 doesn't really make this community look very welcoming coming from the outside, especially when you join the game and realize it's not just a meme.
---
The game's Reddit community as a very prominent "us vs them" mentality compared to other game's communities I've been in (heck just look at /r/Minecraft, even /r/tf2 is better behaved and they haven't seen a substantial update in over a year and a half).
---
I can't help but think the 'Capture' section should be part of hunting. But I very much agree. Great to see such extensive suggestions from the community.
---
Using eternal glory for unlimited Tele to edgeville while running abyss runes, no idea why he has different assortment of runes and that many tho, would fuck up the amount of xp per hour
---
I think with a more Veracs helm style with a dark plume like the current, less gems, and a bit more pl8 on the legs it'd be crisp! Idk how to do all that fancy editing stuff though to make that lol
---
It’s not your birthday though it’s your character’s birthday.
---
Iron in the mining guild if all you want is xp
---
😂😂😂
---
RS3 got something similar with player owned farms!
---
So you’re here because devs ruined your game for you yet don’t want players that actually have a say in their game to use their voice?
---
Are you the brainlet king?

Me: expresses opinion rationally and respectfully, then moves on
---
You: LMFAO NECKBEARD IDIOT CALM DOWN IMAGINE CARING ABOUT A VIDEO GAME
---
No new skills will ever come to OSRS. I think we've determined that by now.
---
I like this though. Feels like it can fit alongside other skills. I also love when multiple skills are used at once. Discourages skill grinding which is dreadfully boring.
---
Just a note, the boss HAS to hit through prayer or you have no reason to get food. A different solution is needed.
---
Incredible! This will make the gauntlet worth grinding. Thanks for listening to the players
---
Some skills like runecrafting are persaverence tests. I want tmthem to stay that way
---
If you dont like rcing, dont do it. Im still only 71

You know what? That makes perfect sense.

I honestly forget what I voted but I think the reasoning was something like the bastion and battlemage potions are already extensions of regular potions, and making divine potions would be like an extension on an extension of a regular potion. Just my guess
---
The biggest thing I'll never understand with this community is that even though Jagex allows you to VOTE on game changes there's still entitled outrage no matter the outcome.
---
You do realize OSRS is one of just a handful of games that even consider this feature, let alone fully utilize it. yet even when jagex gives the community what they voted for there's still massive outrage and more importantly harassment to the devs over social media.
---
Image if Mincraft's developers got cussed at over social media en mass every time they wanted to add a new block or mob. We'd have stop seeing development long before they ever hit 1.0.
---
If about 50% comes like them, it would be an accurate presentation about TRUE player count.
---
Right now it feels like a 50% damage reduction, could be increased to 75%.
---
thats double d thicc damm lol
---
This is actually a really great idea for a skill. Too bad it'll never pass if it were polled.
---
a small price to pay

Jokes aside the models themselves (minus Iowerth being purple that is dumb) don't bother me, just the chatheads.
---
Yep. Oddly enough I don't have any issues with it on mobile though. Go figure.
---
it all makes sense now
---
Stop complaining, since when osrs's dev haven't heard us? There will always be adjustment to new content, that's how it is... it's impossible to please everyone first time around!
---
Brutals and kbd are fun
---
Yeah I mean it depends on prayer level, pray bonus, pray pot drops etc...also your inventory, once you're super comfortable you can bring very few food and stack the pray pots.
---
I'm in the same boat. I'm not keen to redo every NPC, but if we did, option C wouldn't be a bad way to do it.  Still want original bae tho.
---
You wouldn't call yourself a PvMer if all you do is safespot. There's nothing wrong with killing people who don't fight back it's just not real PvP imo
---
I'm not downplaying it at all. How many times have you done it? I've done it 3 (maybe 4, can't remember) times. 2 of which in the last year. I'm an experienced player so it was a very easy experience. 
---
Its pretty obvious that so many level 3s take the risk because 1. It isn't as risky as you are pretending and 2. because a good percentage of hcim that play just pick hardcore to start because there is no downside and they dont actually focus on staying alive. 
---
If it was as risky as you're pretending it wouldn't be recommended to do it at 10 hp in so many hardcore ironman guides. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out. I'm speaking with experience and facts. You're just using the fact that a lot of hardcores die there out of context. You'll notice that a lot also die at the agility pyramid. Is the agility pyramid risky? No. A lot of people just aren't playing to stay alive. They're just seeing how long they last naturally.

I get the rng damage to a point and it does slow you down a lot with only being able to heal 20s but i feel like people are overstating how bad it really is at this point, I fail maybe 10% of my corrupteds now in t1 armour and id say at least 7/10 of those I made a mistake somewhere that could have made the difference.

These are amazing and well thought-out ideas; I completely agree about Gauntlet having so much potential. I'm still having a blast with it, but I feel like it could have so much longevity and depth if they incorporate some of your suggestions (and maybe give me more than 50k every ten minutes).

Yes.

Personally, I found range was much easier to use though.

Dumbass, the moment zulrah was released was the moment alchable and recource shitting bosses was made meta

I miss back when the unique was the content and not 2m/hr in resource drops

I did exactly this, I made a zerker, quested it, got the stats, then realize I wanted to do end game content.

Haven't regretted it doing it once, add me if you want: ChadSupreme

Not with that attitude it won’t.
---
Even with all the issues with warding it was pretty close. This is already more fleshed out and (anecdotally) better accepted in the sample size of this sub.
---
If this is only 9% more popular than warding, it passes. That’s easily doable.

What is their update system when a planned changed that's currently being polled can get pushed onto the live server so easily and not even noticed?
---
Do they not having any kind of test build or do they just do all their work on the live build of the game?
---
The Mutagen drop from Zulrah is already incredibly rare at 1/13k or 1/6.5k for either or, more rare than pet drops. It doesn't make sense to me how the game can give you duplicates of 1 Mutagen without giving you the other somewhere along the way. I'm about to break 20K Kill Count with two Tanz Mutagens and no Magma in sight. Now don't get me wrong, I like a good grind, but this is getting a bit nuts.
---
Here are my two suggestions:
---
\- Option 1: Update to allow a NPC in Zul-andra to swap your mutagen or mutated helmet for the opposite variant with a fee (gold sink yay)
---
\- Option 2: Update Zulrah to drop you at least 1 of each mutagen variant before giving you duplicates

Please save bounty hunter,it sucks so much these days. Remeber the 3 BH crators? That was fun, also the EP days of BH were great...  good post, I agree with many points made.
---
P.S: When will they nerf gmauls?
---
Yes of course by all means, acting like children is the best way to get what you want.

Don't be surprised when Jagex says fuck it and removes polling support all together.

WHAT ARE YE DOIN IN MAH SWAMP?
---
With either method the loot is still op imo.
---
Aka dead content. 8 str bonus is fine, especially given their rarity. Also 40 def req so yah all 40 def accs should have barrows gloves anyways so again, whats the big deal?
---
Dude I just started rewatching it with my GF and now my brain is wrinkled hard.

Iron No Bank or something close to that

Damn where did you come up with that one? Ive never thought of that myself haha

I restart my client prior to every trip there. Otherwise you get lag spikes every 10 seconds or so. Type ::displayfps and notice that the lag spikes happen when the memory resets. Not sure what the deal is.

Rune gloves take literally like 5 hours to get. Bgloves like a day.
---
These guys manage to "accidentally" nerf a shit tonne of content related to new quests and spawn Tbows in a random location.
---
If we don't make a deal out of it then jagex sure as fuck aren't going to notice their mistakes.
---
No no this isn't an osrs meme or complaint I must be on the wrong subreddit.
---
Why can't the developers create a boss that is fun enough even if players had to make a loss? Of course there should be an incentive but why can't it be without affecting the economy negativly? There should be more mini game based bosses to upgrade already existing things Imo. This is just lazy
---
She just wanted to up the ante yknow?
---
All flipping literally is is taking advantage of people with no patience lol.
---
The main problem with that is the blade being the only unique that would boost your gp/hr by much. Even then the estimated rate of blade right now is 1/1k so if you assumed you got one every 1k gauntlets for the sake of this calculation you would add about 700k or so per hour for normal gauntlet. So total average loot per hour would only be about 1.2-1.3m. and while I agree that it would be nice if design wouldn't always just spit out alchables, even if you manage to get a blade in those kills you get half of the gp from most other bosses that have less requirements. It doesn't have to be the best money maker but frankly it should be at least near zulrah for the amount of effort and quests required to get to it.
---

I like this

NUMBER OF SCALES**** not amount. It’s countable. Barbarian.
---
begging you to change gauntlet rewards.... i want to do it but it's just not worth time when you look at effort vs rewards
---
Imagine a "game mechanic" that gives you an even larger incentive to give players carpal tunnel syndrome.
---
This would really remove all integrity from that icon though since you could always have traded over enough supplies to 1-99 every skill then convert at level 3.

People who make money trading don't need money from making tutorials.

The problem with the magic class is the lack for affordable pk equipment.  The most affordable robes to pk with are mystic (140k) from there it goes to ahrims.  We need more middle level robes that were suggested with warding.  Range has void at low wildy to pk with and black d hide for high, both are faily good. Mele has cheap barrows gear and rune while magic has ahrims which is quite expensive and not practical to use in places like revs.  Because of the lack of affordable med level pk gear magic splashes a ton unlike range, (rune cross bow/balista) which are very accurate.  I know al of people will troll the Xeric robes + water staff.  But atleast I can speak for myself, I will risk 600-700k with magic includingsupplies robes runes. While ill risk 250k with range.  Magic will never get kills even when against pray range, the rangers still get all the kills.  So to say magic is not under powered is incorrect.  Magic is only balenced if your in full tier 70 gear and risking 20m+.
---
I think EoC has made everyone so gun-shy toward changes, that Jagex can't even fart without a poll.
---
He could have mastered 3.7 actual human skills in that time.
---
Yeah but also easy to right click and look in all holes
---
Shit
---
It's a bigger affect than that. You'll now be eating less which means you can spend more time attacking for faster kills. If you originally brought and ate 20 food, that's 36 seconds spent eating and delaying your next attack. Cut that in half after the update and that's 10 seconds saved in addition to all the time saved fishing and doing inventory management during prep. Player confident in not making mistakes will be able to go in with 8 or 12 food probably with t1 armour for corrupted comp speedruns.
---
Cant wait for this update tbh gonna make gauntlet so much more consistent and speedrunnable.
---
Not really. As cool as warding is, there were a lot of issues left unresolved before it was polled. Even given that it was only 9% away from a pass.
---
A less controversial aspect of the game with a more well fleshed out plan could easily pass given this. Sailing comes to mind immediately since it was a similar situation and came even closer to a pass.
---
And this my friends is Your Brain on Reddit
---
Maybe to combat this, a requirement to transition is you're only able to save a certain number of items/armor up to a certain gold amount depending on your combat level.
---
"0day" is a bit misleading here, as it's already an [established term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)) and is *very* misleading in this context.
---
He did post proof, type in the image url in rideje9's post.
---
I Definitely expected this to be a meme when I clicked it, but this is actually thought out. Good job. Glad we get real suggestions occasionally.
---
Another piece of rs3 content people praise as a new idea (here come the downvotes, I said something about rs3). Dragons bring the top thing to farm again... Component of capturing... I honestly enjoyed how rs3 made this just an alternative way to train farming and the capturing was part of other skills, I don't think it fits as it's separate skill, and rs3 gave an insane amount of rewards for POF, but still feels like not enough to justify a skill.
---
Additionally a skill like this doesn't help much with the need to remove items and gold from the game that are now driving prices up until everyone claims the game is the same as rs3 in terms of economy, infact it would most likely just add items into the game through training other skills and passively training ranching, with the items most likely being slightly more valuable than farming.
---
Idk man downvote me, my opinion is unpopular.
---
 bwana what the fuck
---
they should buff the blade/differentiate it more from rapier by giving it a spec or something (not the super busted damage+stun spec that was polled) so that it maintains its value. Imo it is both more fun and better for game health if the profit comes from getting a super valuable unique rather than constant high value resource and alchable drops
---
its worth a good skim at the very least
---
But it should though. Would be better for the game imo.
---
That is why I don't try to merch. Anytime I leave a pending GE offer, I tend to get anxiety that the item will crash or spike while I wait, whichever is worse. And that is when it is something that will always profit; it is even worse if it is something I invested in...
---
correct items sat on the ge for whatever their mid price ge value was until they were purchased however the coins were put into the game instantly and there are still Elys and stuff sitting on the ge for their old prices when coinshare was first put in
---
I love how everyone is keen to jump to conclusion l, a quick search of high scores on rs3 would answer the question..
---
turn on gpu plugin if you havent, shits good
---
And I need to be veteran player to have an opinion in this community?
---
You do realize this entitle outrage behavior likely steers many, many new players away from the community right?
---
As far as numbers go I've probably played about 6 years total since RS1.
---
Got anything else i can poke holes in?
---
Also just repost some shit thats a week old or take whatever memes trending and mix it with an older meme.
---
Being honest to most people reading this post, it’s you that looks like the king of brainlets.
---
cinema 4d or autodesk maya is what I use
---
Basically, yes!
---
They should just make the crystals tradable or let the blade be chargef with coins like 200k/h same cost as chaotics
---
&gt;In terms of effort: the tick manipulation makes Zalcano arguably less effort then it is without it. This is because you always have enough rocks in 2 xp drops, dodging at least 1 Zalcano 'attack' while people who do not 1.5t have to deal with this too.
---
I've done about 100 kc of Zalcano both with and without 1.5 (so 200 total kc) and this just isn't true. The 1.5 timing/cycle is pretty easy to mess up and if you mess up one cycle you get bad loot. If you get the 2 tick mine from the crystal/dragon pick you also lose the timing.
---
 In regards to dodging attacks, I've found I get hit by the rock explosion far more often than before because I'm committed to the longer process of starting a new cycle. Since the rock explosion usually comes on the 2nd mine it doesn't matter if you 1.5 or not. 
---
Also worth noting that 1.5 doesn't really help in larger worlds. You don't have enough time to get more cycles than anyone else, either at the rocks or at the boss, and you don't really need more than 3 or 4 rocks in faster worlds so the double mine doesn't help there either.
---
I mean, he was always an elf. But with SotE they made him a more relevant character with a proper name so they updated him in the previous quests to reflect this.
---
Argh! I'm 99, too... Shame on me.
---

---
This is great! This is the kind of new skill that I like - it fits in with existing old school skills while I feel adding completely new mechanics and feeling exciting
---
You're fighting a dragon, thus dragon darts are the only logical choice
---
Eh, you tried.
---
Jagex
---
Was this polled?
---
He kinda has a point tho lol
---
I can’t speak for everyone but a lot of the time I am playing scape while I’m doing homework. I can’t always give scape my full attention, like this week I had to read a chapter AND I have a ONE HUNDRED word essay due next week that I haven’t even started. If I don’t do some research on my subject while I do Zolcano I don’t know how I will be able to finish it in time.
---
Sh bb is ok
---
It would be too op if it didn’t take crystal bow charges too
---
but here's the thing though........you nerds don't have a clue what you're talking about.
---
What’s the best strat for defenders in barbarian assault? I get by on my own but the runners are definitely last to be killed. I see other defenders some how kill them in what feels like the first 30 seconds of the game. 
---
Also is there a dedicated discord or something for it? I’d like to grind out the pet. I’m getting by with pugs but it be nice for more consistency.
---
What? Making the gauntlet easier/faster applies
---
Well I admit I was wrong but there's nothing stopping jagex from implementing a toggle anyway.
---
So you won’t touch me, nerd
---
I can’t unfortunately :(
---
I believe you can get a weeks free membership on mobile, so i would google how to do that specifically and do members quests to power level your stats, witch's house and waterfall quest are a must
---
Allow me to rephrase. Anywhere i said i was being nice. Replace it with trying to assuage your concerns. That better? Its not my job to be nice. Im sorry calling someone a dumbass for directly contradicting themselves so quickly hurt your feelings.
---
Y’all suck
---
Imagine doing the abyss and not spending the 3k on abyssal bracelets
---
So bullshit... it's already such a fuckin easy quest. So unnecessary. Like... why?
---
Easy: get around lvl 40 farming and do a couple herb runs every day. Takes about 10 minutes and earns more than enough for bond. Another way would be getting 70 attack/ranged/magic on F2P and doing barrows on P2P. Farming is passive, barrows is active, both are easy and quick.
---
More like "blink Twice" if you know what I mean
---
Agility is not the best, but its better than mining and RC. Agility is at least decent xp rates with a good reward in Graceful. 
---
Mining there's NO afk other than MLM, and that's ultra shit xp.
---
Runecrafting is AFK once you're at Zeah, but before that its awful.
---
I love the idea of this skill. I think it’d be really nice to be able to combine parts of this skill with construction, in order to make plots of land to raise animals on (similar to pet rooms). 
---
I’m a little worried it’d become a buyable skill but still love the idea!
---
Ah. That's a good point.
---
Whelp, I'm all out of ideas but I can't disagree that this looks unlike OSRS. =/
---
YEs yes yes. Ever since they mentioned they wanted to add livestock to the farming guild, which didn't make it in the end, I've wanted something like this. 
---
Although I feel it could fit in farming, I also feel it could stand well as a skill on its own. Awesome job OP, I hope this gains traction.
---
Barb fishing.
---
The ability to pk and get loot probably
---
Give me a reason why please. I gave my reasoning.
---
Drink a super restore.
---
I personally like the idea but I thought this sub is against any changes to OSRS?
---
/u/zuhaar my boy
---
This is literally RS3's PoF but with extra steps
---
Nice one my first and only 99 was at the MLM
---
Add fairy tales 1 to that list
---
Its confirmed that dmg through prayer is being reduced but dmg on wrong prayer is being increased. Also it will always start on the range phase. I think the rewards are fine for something that requires 0 supplies or gear. Corrupted offers better drop rates for dedicated/skilled players. Also even though there is a "meta", the randomness of the rooms keeps things interesting enough imo
---
I love the amount of work you put into this.
---
Just don't see how it would fit on the overworld. Much like how orignally PoH was supposed to be on the overworld, I feel like this would just take up way too much space to live up to how it's being described.
---
It would have to be much larger than farming patches, granted there is a lot of unused space on Gielinor, I just can't picture it fitting in without being intrusive.
---
&gt; One idea I was really set on was being able to pay a farmhand to watch over your livestock, similar to how you pay a farmer to watch over your crops. 
---
Yes, something like that was [suggested by someone else as well!](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cjrz5e/suggestion_ranching/evfttk3/) I like the idea.
---
Hard mode is supposed to be hard, though. Terrible change.
---
Not to mention unique titles and skins you can only get from those anniversaries. And yes it's per character, not irl birthday or account bday
---
👀
---
Good idea, but this should be added to the farming skill. Farming should have 2 components: plants and animals
---
I don’t understand it at all tbh but I don’t understand farming either. I’d vote yes.
---
Oh no I’m implying you’re going to get hacked for posting your account creation date  all over the place. Your opinion is shit based on the downvotes it’s received alone.
---
I think if they model the helm after Veracs and remove some of the gems, or make them a tad smaller it would work better for OSRS.
---
I would support this over warding
---
Fuck you both, swamp man good
---
sir, you are not allowed to have this opinion
---
Lol no im not on the spectrum. I understand my tone has not been friendly. It wasn’t intended to be. Last I checked though not being friendly doesn’t make you a brainlet. You and many others have made claims and when asked to back up or explain them you bail. Every time. So unless you care to explain its fairly obvious I’ve hurt your feelings and you can’t actually back up what you’ve said because your disagreement comes from being mad at how I’ve said things and not that im wrong.
---
Dude this is some good shit... Gives me a nice homestyle-harvest moonish feel lol
---
Personally id like the whole body to be more buffand a smaller ponytail
---
I don't think you understood what I ment. If you want to have children then of course they come with other things too and that's your choice. Someone else might choose to not have children. On the other hand don't need to waste money on other things either. Bills don't just "become higher" unless you want to live that way. You could absolutely just decide to live in a small apartment and not have to buy big cars or eat out or go to holiday trips around the globe. These are all choices.
---
If you think the boss doing (by the sounds of things) significantly less damage to you is insignificant for speed runs, you are very stupid. This change would cut down on both prep time and boss kill time.
---
You make no sense for a range armor
---
but the low gp/h dissapears with higher cb levels and slayer, can't say the same for many of the skills.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I had intentions of poking but it’s hard to do without a main so about 70 ish ho I was like fuck it and trained def from 1-70 then later 70-80 I don’t regret it I can see more of the game. My osrs account is furthest I’ve ever gotten into endgame.
---
I can't downvote you enough times.  It's like you didn't even read my comment.
---
It's a little easier that way for me. I can make lance work no problem too now but I think staff/bow is ideal.
---
You get most of them in the course of just playing the game
---
You did what jagex couldn't do
---
Because it is a team based minigame where there's a big group of people pvping versus a solo boss with no incentive to kill it. That doesn't sound fun to me while group PvP does.
---
I agree Jagex should focus on more fun content but solo content with no incentive is not the way to go it will be dead content within days.
---
I understand being upset by something not passing but I like to look at it like this.
---
What's more upsetting to you? 
---
Seeing something in the game you would have liked not passing.
---
or
---
Seeing something the the game you would hate to pass passing.
---
A lot of time, I'm thankful the threshold is 75% because I see A LOT of content I would have strongly disliked hitting between 65-74%.
---
And chances are we'll see a lot of the warding content in future polls anyway.
---
This puts a smile on my face
---
Like crystal shards lol
---
I think this just proves you dont interact with other humans as your equals. I genuinely dont think you think other people are intellectually equal to you
---
No because then there’d still be a complete disconnect between effort and reward in the majority of cases. If you’ve got a team of 3 who do 40% 30% and 30% contribution then the 40% gets at least 10-20 times more reward than the other two despite only putting in 1.33 times more effort
---
This also makes masses stupid because if you’re 95 mining you’re almost never going to get MVP if there’s anyone higher level than you in there
---
I chuckled when I wrote it
---
It just takes a few tries to learn in my opinion
---
Well, the farming skill is already quite full. There's content at every level, and I feel like Ranching would be different enough that it warrants its own skill. It's really almost as close to Hunter as it is to Farming, so why not?
---
both raids are better
---
ironic to claim the community refuses to accept any changes after the largest new quest, and seconds largest new area, just got released after being approved by a poll
---
selective memory, i guess
---
That's too much money, people aren't going to want to learn pking if they're gonna have to risk that much. It'll also make it so that the other gloves will cost more
---
I’ve moved my character to right outside the fight pit, hit me up when you’re on and I’ll log in and help :)
---
Anyone wanna go rev or wherever pking with me in approximately 6 hours? I'm 109 combat, 84 mage tho so I can possibly tb or blitz. Send me a dm
---
Still a slippery slope. You are basing it off the past actions they took with rs3 and saying they will apply the same actions to osrs, which they have shown many times over they have no intention of doing.
---
Slippery slope can be used non-fallicously if the underlying evidence is strong, but the argument they did it with rs3 is really weak given the entire context of osrs.
---
Main point here though is: no matter what, this line of argument is still a SSA because its the literal definition of a SSA.
---
It would be terrible if they were as good as rune gloves and simply buyable, I'm still bitter over the fact combat bracelets took over the iconic mithril gloves for 1 def pures.
---
There are construction requirements for every part of the **Environment** section.
---
Zulrah stores your items when you die, but it still deters a lot of people from learning it.
---
Wow sick suggestion can’t wait to ride my horse around. ( no sarcasm)!
---
This is a skill I can get behind.
---
More like you changed so much. No longer a half wit kid that doesn’t know math, gear bonuses, efficiency training and internet resourcefulness... looking back, I was such a noob and now everything makes a lot more sense.
---
Good on you for killing it so quick in 4 months.
---
If you're using BP, I would highly recommend using blessed dhide or Karils, you'll be a lot more accurate and only sacrifice like 2 max hits, especially over regular void. 
---
Lag could definitely affect your ability to avoid damage in the acid phase, it always takes a while to turn around in Vorkath's lair for some reason.
---
BGS/DWH are definitely helpful. You definitely CAN do it without them, but it will certainly help with getting the hits consistently. 
---
Also, are you using bastion potions to raise your def and range? Could help a bit to avoid some hits
---
Throw a roulette table in that bad boy and I'd find you in a hurry.
---
This is a good point and an important distinction!
---
It has too much detail and the helm still looks like its ripped off of rs3.
---
It's bothering me that only one has gilded boots

Whoosh indeed

Not something I want but cool nonetheless

It feels like they're using the Warding argument. "Why add it when it could just be incorporated into add skill here?". I enjoyed reading this though. Well thought out.

Try skilling a stat to 90 from 50 and getting shit

Probably would hide on the far side of the scarab boss room from the Contact! quest.  Used to farm monsters in there in DMM and no one ever showed up

Nice.

I would say it depends on how you respond. In equal terms, you’re probably ok though not always. In greater force because someone hurt you in some insignificant way, I’d probably say the same thing I have said to you. Seek help. Responses like that show a lack of ability to process emotions adequately.
---
When you try too hard to be funny 😖
---
To be perfectly candid, this post only contains a skeleton (albeit with a little bit of flesh to it) for a skill. The mechanics are vaguely defined, which leaves much space for imagination and I suspect everyone is interpreting words in a way that makes it interesting *for them.* That being said, that's exactly what I'm looking for: a ton of feedback, enthusiasm and crazy ideas. I'd like the first skill to come to OSRS to be a melting pot of concepts and ideas originating from the *entire* community, so that it may reflect it and truly be worthy of being added into the game.
---
Helmet might be a bit much.
---
$33*
---
I think the point was that people can continue to play and get a faster time, if it's made easier.
---
If it's made harder, then older times are more difficult / impossible to contend with.
---
The only people impacted by making it (however much) easier would be the person that got the best time, then said "my work here is done" and never returned to either improve their time or beat challengers.
---
I'm literally shaking right now as I type this comment on my phone.
---
the boys in crafting guild say no
---
I’m actually kind of impressed.

IIRC there were a couple people in the original voting threads that admitted they voted no but didn't know what the potion did.

Now that priff has been released, as well as all its content, can we get the drop rates of ToB? Pretty please.

---
Its easy and safe to say "this is what I like, I don't want to do anything else". It's natural to want to stay in your comfort zone, thats how our brains are wired. 
---
I am guilty of this as well for the first 20 or so years of my life. The reality is, you can't know what you want to do/not do in life until you have thoroughly done and experienced making friends, going out, getting a girlfriend etc. If you have tried these things more than 1 bad experience, then I agree with you. I just feel that many people stop at that one bad experience and stay in their comfort zone, causing them to miss out on the things that "normies" love to do for a reason.
---
I don't understand it either. But it is just the way it is. Like people on twitter are losing their over the proposed xp buff to the priff agility course.
---
I agree with that. I think the boss is fun, but I'm only killing her for pet and shards. I'm only 80 mining.

I didn't do POF last year when I started back up again in RS3, but I heard about it. Just like with Song of the Elves, it feels like OSRS players forget there's an entirely separate main game they can get ideas from. It's perfectly ok to bring their better updates to OSRS. I thought that was the whole entire point - take what RS3 "got right" and incorporate it into OSRS to make a much better experience.

not rly. he's probably creating some dope video. dont worry.

Ah, but they haven't thought about one thing: a new skill means a new skill cape, and a new skill cape means a new skill cape perk! They've fallen victim to one of the classic blunders!

When I asked Mat K two or three ago, that's pretty much the answer I got.
---
Short and easy version: It's official RWT (real-money to in-game gold), and people don't like the concept of being able to do this.
---
Really great work man!
---
It's a shame it would never pass because it's "too similar to farming".
---
And their shared Chadette.
---
Looks like the tin man finally came out
---
Buy out ALL the ironmeme shops or pk ALL the chin hunter pkers

Now with 50% less dragonstone but 100% more practical application of what's left of it.
---
Most quests were designed with obtaining items in mind, Questing should be the least of your worries. Traveling around the map is a pain in the ass however
---
The map editor doesn’t delete one NPC and replace it with a cloned, but entirely different, NPC. “It was a bug” is a bald-faced lie Wolf tells us because he expects us to just say “lol classic Jagex” to and move on.
---
You get offended way too easily. Imagine getting triggered because I said 50 kc is too low to make the conclusion he did.
---
Nope
---
🕷🕷SARACHNIS DROP RATES PLEASE /u/JagexHusky 🕷🕷
---
Apparently not. I swear people lose their minds over the smallest changes..
---
I mean what are you even saying?
---
Someone posts a reasonable argument on the Internet and your retort is to tell them to stop sending mods death threats?
---
Who are you even talking to?
---
&gt;In greater force 
---
What did I say that was in "greater force" than what you said lmao? You love to play the victim, dont you?
---
&gt;In greater force because someone hurt you in some insignificant way, I’d probably say the same thing I have said to you.
---
So then how do you justify calling that guy a dumbass, idiot and moron before he ever insulted you? You know what I would say to someone who does that shit?
---
&gt;Seek help. **Responses like that show a lack of ability to process emotions adequately.**
---
Responding to normal people having a conversation by insulting them shows a severe lack of ability to process emotions adequately
---
Face shield sucks
---
Yes, activities that yield high GP/hr tend to yield low XP/hr and vice versa. Congratulations, you've discovered a basic aspect of how this game works.
---
Big update, probably finished up with a high pressure crunch.

See if i can use that old disk of returning in the fally mine that takes me to the black hole room and you can only get in it if you have that item.
---
Aaaah your right, your right.
---
What's wrong with dailies? Birdhouses, herbs and farming are my favorite skills atm.
---
I would STRONGLY encourage you to upgrade to second floor first before getting the kit IF you have future plans to train mining.
---
I got my set first then went for upper floor, and it was torturous. Top floor mining is at least 30% easier and more afk than bottom floor. It makes mining MUCH MUCH more bearable compared to bottom floor. 
---
If i have a choice, i would just get upper floor and then get the full set afterwards.
---
Warding is being taken out back and shot. The new skill.
---
The other stuff polled with it I'll be surprised if some of it doesn't end up in a poll as stand alone content since it didn't get a fair shake in the polling blog.
---
They're zammy dhide chaps, same stats as black dhide but +1 prayer. That's an endgame zerker 4 sure
---
&gt;In greater force because someone hurt you in some insignificant way, I’d probably say the same thing I have said to you. Seek help. Responses like that show a lack of ability to process emotions adequately.
---
I just need you to remember you're the guy who insulted someone for absolutely no reason other than you disagreed with him. Seek help. Responses like that show a lack of ability to process emotions adequately
---
Not nice?
---
Its also what came before, as well. Its revisionist history that only SoF and EoC killed the game. Dedicated members were quitting all the way from 2008 until 2012, including Zezima and Zarfot, because the game was becoming too easy and convenient. Its the small stuff that gradually erodes away the challenge and integrity of the world that really hurts the game IMO, but EoC was obviously the big thing that put people off for good and made the game unsalvagable.
---
New skill idea: Italian Dressing.
---
Unlocks after 99 Ranching.
---
Firemaking cause it's super nice with 10hp
---
This is a part of the skill:
---
* Unlocking a new **Environment** requires a certain **Ranching** 
---
 and **Construction** level to be able to access and build upon the new location.
---
* Within that **Environment**, certain **Capture** monsters, which have both **Ranching** and **Hunter** requirements, can be housed and cared for.
---
This is a good explanation answer, that’s helps me understand a bit but to be fair I can see where  there coming from. I mean if I had all the money irl I would be tempted, if I had money to blow it would be nice to just pop a d lance or d hunter c bow into my bank to help kill dragons instead of having to grind 3 weeks for money to even buy one when I’d rather just be killing stuff I want or something.  
---
Time is money and sometimes you just wanna cut the time out with money.
---
People suggested that because warding was uninteresting and had no depth to the skill. If there is no depth than it is easy to lump it in with something else. This proposed skill is deep. Integrating this with Hunter would fundamentally change Hunter. I think that it is a good sign that this skill can exist on its own.
---
Ye that was me :D
---
Boingo my dick.

Read it, it's wondeful.

Thanks for hiding the pic but you probably shouldn’t put the reason for hiding the pic the the title. Kind of defeats the purpose
---
When I do agility I like to hop in an Xbox party and chat with friends, and it helps to ignore how slow the xp rates are. Seems to help me get through it anyways :)
---
this was a inside joke with a friend of mine on twitter to start out with then some dickhead moved it to here, i don't have 37k hours played i have like 9k, it actually makes me hurt that the world is this toxic tho, and don't worry i have a amazing career and a loving family
---
Why are people bitching at this now? How many times will people visit that area? If it was endgame stuff fine, whine all you want but lol a cave in which you stay for no longer than 5 minutes in your entire RS career. ok bruh.
---
I'd love to read it if you manage to ever find it!
---
For something to become "alive content" 1 or more things have to die.
---
It's fine. Prif is pretty. The red chin spot and agility course are awesome. Divine potions are great.

+3 acc +1 str upgrade (even on release prices, expecting a 15m loss in a month) for my unquested alt training meele stats is worth it for me

what I did not expect is a hidden programed nerf, which for me it doesn't support the price, as then they're a worthless cosmetic after 2 days
---
This is a swampy boi meme my dude
---
Definitely get upper level first, it’s much better. You’ll have plenty of nuggets for prospector after that
---
Thats what i was hoping to hear lol. I got 70k to 72 mining so i have some time to think.  The other person was telling me i could sell outfit back but im curious how many nuggets ill get back.

Hey sween can y’all make it so we can change the left click on the teleport crystal from lletya to prif

I've quit for the last 6 months due to being bored with the game but I'm 100% serious when I say I'll renew my membership if this is added as a skill.

I love that.

You will kill the game if you cater to those who have been here for 15 years.  You need new players.

Haha there's more to it :)

Yeah I usually die to getting screwed by awkward orange tile layout in combination with triple tornado spawns in combination with Hunllef blocking my path away from the tornadoes. The boss can be really annoying sometimes, but I can also appreciate the difficult mechanics. My biggest grouch really is the rewards are pretty lackluster for the time it takes, especially if you die at the boss which cuts enormously into gp/hr.

So farming 2?

---
Ahh pure pking in the name 🤣 name checks out
---
I'm guessing this is from the picture of the subway car filled with crabs?
---
Oh I see, I didn't realize mediums had a chance at dropping a master clue.
---
They're making adjustments this week to the mechanics to make it feel less RNG-dependent. The rewards aren't great but it has a dope pet so people will do it for that. I don't really understand the argument that a drop table buff will really help it, unless you're saying we should buff it to TOB tier 10m/hour then what is the point? People will just do tob instead for money. 
---
IMO gauntlet is really fun and a nice piece of content. Not something to grind forever, but pretty fun and I will probably sprinkle it in as something I do occasionally for quite a while.
---
At first I thought it said marijuana

Nice guide if you don’t wanna fuck around with safespotting this bitch.
---
I don't think there's much of a reason since Romeo &amp; Juliet gives you 5 and Merlin's Crystal gives you 6. Neither are very difficult or impressive quests.
---
We've braimstormed it and have decided that going right to "Farming 3" would be more appropriate. Thank you for your suggestion.
---
- Management
---
Unfortunately all too common among humans.
---
Lmfao nice try troll
---
because you dont you use range when hybriding...
---
and even with rag hybrid setups (with range) it would become even more stale than it already is
---
Can we expect massive expansions to skills like this to be polled?
---
I ask because I feel new skills won't pass poll but maybe being an expansion to a skill would be more likely to pass.
---
Can ya source that? Most christians can't agree on anything except that you should do your best to love your neighbor as jesus would
---
Why theres so much drama on graphics atm you think? Cuz ppl start understand we slowly losing the purpose of osrs
---
Best way? Ever since Zamorak Monk Robes turned f2p, you could literally get them from outside goblin village, without trekking for 20 minutes through the underground pass.
---
However, **a continued verbal  assault, especially one of this length, is indicative of a severe mental health issue which is why im so concerned for you.**
---
So then explain these comments to me you've made in the past 90 minutes, as I feel you've made a verbal assault of considerable length, prompting me to worry for you:
---
&gt;Yes I called him a dumb ass for directly contradicting himself off the bat. **Im also inclined to call you a child for being upset I offered to correct the issue you pointed out.**
---
Then 
---
&gt;**Im sorry calling someone a dumbass for directly contradicting themselves so quickly hurt your feelings.**
---
And again
---
&gt;You have time to keep replying and complaining yet cant address any specific point ive missed. **I think its pretty fair to say you’re a child throwing a tantrum!**
---
Even more?!
---
&gt;Also, you clearly have time to keep responding yet won’t point out the things you complained about. **You might be a child throwing a tantrum.**
---
And another?
---
&gt;**I can tell, though, you’re incredibly quick to make massive logical jumps when you’re upset. You’ve yet to point out how im wrong in any way. Even when asked.**
---
Holy shit, it keeps going
---
&gt;Forgive me if I don’t put a lot of stock in someone who has time to throw insults for an hour but cant spend a few minutes backing up a single claim. **That says a lot about the quality of your character as well.**
---
No way is there more
---
&gt;**But you’re a terrible person who would rather spend their time and effort insulting people because you can’t back up a single thing you said. Reevaluate yourself mate.**
---
Is it possible you said more?!
---
&gt;**Again, reevaluate yourself. Im worried for you.**
---
Imagine if you acted like you weren't insulting me for the past 90 minutes:
---
&gt;**You’re obviously hurting and need somewhere to vent so thats cool and why I haven’t gotten angry over your, at this point, unprompted verbal battering.**
---
**USE MIRROR NUMBER SEVEN TO ADMIRE YOURSELF**
---
Aye farming 3 works for me too :D
---
Yeah, no you don't. It's not even remotely believable that you take "basically 0 damage"  in corrupted. I'd love to see your corrupted kc. I've literally been hit 10+ times in a row without catching a 0 on correct prayer.
---
They're going to make it more punishing to fuck up and miss a prayer switch, but less luck based on how much random damage you take. It'll make it more accessible to more people while igniting a new Pb race in week 2 with riskier plays due to more predictable damage. Win wib
---
As swampletics once said... 99 hunter.
---
That's called the substance. You're asking me to ignore what he said because he's an atheist, and instead believe that she was a wonderful person because she was a Christian. Neither way makes sense. Instead, focus on facts and logic. (inb4 ben shapiro)
---
Armour looks nice but helm is kinda weird? Maybe do a rune ish helm with a dragon stone in the middle and back? Idk tbb
---
I like it a lot. Shame that we won't ever be able to get a new skill because there will always be enough maxed mains and other people that will downvote it out.
---
No u
---
Abyss is almost always better than running to the alters.
---
Check out Ourania runecrafting when you get to ~50 rc and have 71 magic. It's profitable and only slightly less effiencet/ better than other profitable rc methods.
---
Cosmics are good until you can make nats at 44 and laws at 54
---
Alright have an upvote, that was funny.
---
In all honesty, yes. The decorative cloths and gemstone pieces make for a fairly exotic addition when contrasted with the trims of god-affiliated sets and the plain tabards of heraldic armor.
---
&gt;I have not been verbally abusing you in any way in the last 90 minutes. 
---
I listed 10 comments from the past 90 minutes where you insulted me
---
All of the hosts use that one because there's more traffic and they get more people coming in to their houses. It'd be kinda lonely and boring for the hosts if they did it on some other world. Plus as the other guy said, ping really shouldn't impact altering bones.
---
you get like 73 str and agility from it if you fish their till 99. wouldn't really consider that no real agility gains at all.
---
this is not an issue of price moves or downtrend from release.. but core value nerfed in days, unannounced, thats y a jmod apologized lol, if core value is zero, price wont hold on aesthetics or a small rarity
---
in 3 days you'll se my insta sell as a smart move

Prayer flick Piety speeds up your DPS. :\^)
---
I said with t2 and I have like 6 corrupted but it’s not really worth it to run a bunch of them cause normal is faster lol
---
I have no idea where you got that first number  
---
Lookie here https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Experience#Experience_table
---
Also, they should get rid of the time limit for gathering supplies and instead make it unlimited with a decreasing reward factor based on how long you take (for regular gauntlet only, hard mode should still have the time limit). For example someone who took 7 minutes would have better rewards than someone who took 15. This would make learning the boss much easier as you arent rushing for supplies and can take your time to gather supplies and armour/weapons.
---
Okay but it's unrelated to Seampletics so I still don't see what that means?
---
This is a step in the wrong direction.
---
doesnt look like dragonstone at all. cool design, just rename the whole set to royal rune armour or something
---
Id drink to that, buzz me mulano🤙
---
Pleasant
---
That was a great era for rs YouTube content
---
No problem. Fixed is generally the best way to play the game since the minimal mouse movement allows you to do more actions more quickly and accurately. It takes a little getting used to but it's worth imo
---
I specifically remember picking the wrong option and being ducking pissed cause I had to go back and get another sample and that was a pain.  Yet another sneaky change for song of the elves?  I wonder if they would try to cover this one as a bug as well.
---
Really? I could have sworn he was just called Head Mourner even if introduced himself with a proper name.
---
That would be a good start
---
Updating graphics is completely irrelevant to why EOC was released. RS3 was literally a marketing ploy.
---
 Try mod mark
---
I like the general idea, but not as a skill.
---
When the farming guild was first discussed, IIRC we were going to be able to farm livestock there (red spiders, baby blue dragons, cows, snakes etc).
---
But either that was too much feature creep for the content idea or it was completely forgotten.
---
I think quite a lot of these individual pieces of content should be added into existing skills like farming, construction and hunter (boy hunter could really use some more content - it's super bare bones).
---
Having a whole new skill for stuff that is already covered by a few different skills is what I'm not so sure about.
---
i like the joker
---
hit me
---
/u/jagex_wolf /u/mod_curse any insight here?
---
no
---
It’s bis range defense
---
And OSRS is somehow immune to marketing ploys?
---
I never bought a single tree seed and I have 14 mil farming xp. My advice is to plant nasturtium in all but the hosidius flower patches to prevent disease and then plant watermelon in all allotment patches. You can make tens of millions making ultracompost and they are fast easy xp. I planted coconut trees in all but the farming guild fruit tree patches and picked them every run, they are another excellent money maker.
---
In the farming guild i plant the allotment patches half watermelon and snapes so I can finish more farming contracts. White lilies in the flower patch prevent disease. Use the rest of the patches to do contracts and always keep something growing in them because sometimes you can fulfil three or four contracts in a few minutes.
---
And ALWAYS kill the hespori. It awards about 13k farming xp for planting and harvesting. 100 kills is about 10% of the way to lvl 99. And the anima seeds they drop are very helpful. I prefer the attas seeds as they increase harvests.
---
Are you saying we have a minigame version of sheep herder? Yes pleaaasssee
---
Im sorry but making observations isn’t a verbal assault. Would you disagree that someone spending 90 minutes (probably more now) assaulting someone makes them a bad person? Or is that good behavior in your book. Surely this behavior hasn’t been high quality? The rest of those messages I’d be tempted to check the time stamps on. I stopped trying to fuck with you after I became concerned for you.
---
As for the ones expressing concern and offering to be there for you in light of how you behaved i fail to see how thats bad in any way.
---
Yes this sums it up
---
This is an amazing idea, well thought out, and well presented. Kudos to you
---
I’de recommend you tbf
---
Get this man to the doctor I think he's having a stroke
---
If you don't forward this story to 3 friends, you'll wake up and your bank will cleaned tomorrow
---
This man spent 48 hours in his hunter area. Eventually, he's going to be bored while not yet in the meditative state, and ask himself "hey, I wonder how big this area is that I've been in for the past week and a half".
---
Sounds great. Thanks for the effort
---
I'm not sure if they stay hidden post-quest; still, need to check that. It would be odd if they bothered to remove them for the quest then had they come back post-quest so I think it may be permanent.
---
I hate that you cant get the pet without mvp most. I've got almost 250 kc and maybe 25 mvp's (yeah I suck), the grind is going to take forever this way. Making the chance smaller when doing less damage is fine, no chance at all simply sucks.

If range is too powerful, it should be nerfed accordingly instead of being treated unequally for the sake of restoring balance.

Not sure what you mean.
---
Its easy to create accounts and a lot of them are banned in first few days. 
---
Unfortunately there are some profitable things to bot that you can get in literally an hour or two of play time (ex thieving).
---
PLEASE DON’T EVEN POLL EoC JUST PUT IT INTO THE GAME
---
Are you implying easier and skippable are the same thing? Do YOU speak english?
---
Thanks, this has indeed been mentioned by quite a few other players, however this comment sums up my views on this:
---
&gt; I disagree with people making the warding/crafting comparison here with ranching/farming. This is an entire new dimension of content that would like double the size of farming, whereas adding magic robes to crafting is something that already exists in game (salad robes) and would barely increase crafting’s size.
---
&gt; While it technically could be added to farming or hunting it would drastically alter those skills, totally unlike adding a small update to crafting to account for warding. This makes a lot more sense as it’s own skill.
---
Keep in mind that there are farming, hunter, fishing, construction and other requirements within Ranching, so it does very much require proficiency in those skills to train effectively.
---
Bring back warding.
---

WoW is not that difficult even at mythic. Maybe because I've been raiding since vanilla with the same people but it isn't difficult to rinse and repeat what first clear guilds have done and when meta for a mythic is learned. Sure being a first 50/100 clear is difficult but after that it's just about having the right gear/comp and not being an idiot and pushing for completion. Also its not hard won because as long as you can clear some bosses youre coming away with something. Maybe for super casual players it's hard but for anyone who's been halfway seriously playing WoW it's just a time sink till you finish.
---
Yeah mobile makes it easier to clean, on pc it is very tedious to do
---
Very cool
---
It’s cool, but kind of a waste of time to make this because realistically, this game won’t ever see a new skill. Nice effort though.
---
I mean you say you don’t visit suspicious sites but probably click every link someone posts on this page and watch porn (usually suspicious sites) but that’s just my guess
---
REDDIT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE
---
I think only a slight loot table buff personally. It's one of the rare pvm opportunities that you require no start up cash. It also gives crystal shards which are pretty necessary for most of the loot.
---
Why is the dragonstone part just some purple cloth?? No resemblance of dragonstone at all
---
you and me both.
---
add little bit of purple on shield and it's 5/5
---
We voted no because they would of been used exclusively in pvp and fuck pvp updates
---
84 mill. Random guess
---
Now this, is epic.
---
Good fashionscape? Yeah, I heard people loved that armour set.
---
I love the idea of the cloth rather than using only dragonstone gems to highlight the armor.
---
But.. it is player owned farms from rs3, which means its "nOt OlDsChOoL eNoUgH". Where do we draw the line as to what fits old school rs and what doesn't?
---
Everything.
---
Removing the skeletons and keeping the agro on the moss giants would make this a lot harder
---
Hahah love the office that's great

I hope you're joking

Player Owned Farms? I feel like I’ve seen this before.
---
### WELCOME TO RAM RANCH
---
Really cool, except for the helm.
---
I'd love parts of this added to the game, like having a "Ranching" section under construction would feel very flavorful, as well as adding stuff from the skill as described in the post.
---
However, having this as a standalone skill would feel a bit out of place for me since it just reminds me of farming and POH activity with bits of hunter slapped on top of it.
---
Don't get me wrong though, the parts about companionship and the farm animal stuff seem cool and fresh, especially with some kind of balanced rewards for completing certain activities.
---
I personally appreciate you putting in hours of your time on this, these are the posts that keep the reddit part of the community interested and alive, at least that's what I think. Great job, cheers!
---
There was only one vote for warding though.
---
#streamerfavoritism
---
So everyone jumps off a bridge to save their lives your not jumping because everyone did
---
it would be funny as fuck if they polled warding again and made the poll "Would you like to see Warding as proposed in the blog NOT be added to the game"
---
Why the fuck you buying 61 bonds bro lmao
---
So I’m down for a new skill. I didn’t like warding much, but I skipped vote on the main skill and said yes to almost all the additions in case it did pass. I did that because I think we do desperately need a new skill to break the ice of OSRS’s “purity” before it begins to stagnate.
---
However, I’m going to disregard your post because your attitude and copy/paste cynicism is shit.

We don't know how rare the blade is yet, I'd like to know what price it will settle on before making any changes (130m atm). Even if you would buff the normal drop table, you could still end up with the long-term profit staying about the same, since the value of the blade will probably drop as more people will grind it and bring more into the game.
---
"Big ticket" types of drop tables is something that have been requested for ages, and imo if the blade can single-handedly keep the long-term profit on par with other bosses while keeping the resource/alchable influx low then why not.
---
That’s great. RuneScape didn’t have instances for 10 years. It got along just fine. Cry babies like you want everything instanced because you can’t out Dps people who actually know what they’re doing. It’s ok, we’ll make an easyscape just for you guys because “wahhhhhh every other MMO I can instance fight the boss wahhhhhh”
---
Yeah lol, it doesn't even matter what the change is now.  It's a treasure hunt of who can find the change first, claim indignation, and reap that 50 karma.
---
Looking like iron mario
---
No.
---
Just let us have sailing
---
I havent posted or viewed this subreddit in over a year dude
---
it actually is
---
1.  That's obviously a bug.
---
2.  A single bug doesn't make it an unsafe death.
---
That's like the anti-vax moms that find 1 source that suggest vaccines cause autism vs the millions of papers that suggest it doesn't.
---
This could be a very good resumé if you wanted to go work for Jagex dev team haha
---
Holy shit, /u/Mod_Kieren
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
im pretty sure the first and second floor are the same song?
---
have it also coexist with cooking and have a butchering option. new foods would be cool as well. I didn't read much into this so just disregard if it already discusses this
---
Is making an attack unavoidable that deals 98 damage good or bad game design?
---
Rune armor with purple butt flaps and eye protection... What’s ‘dragon stone’ about this exactly?
---
Good idea man i actually dont have 2fa on my email. Im.gonna do that now
---
Looks better but still not a fan of the skirt on the platelegs, feels out of place
---
People with that kind of mentality are just so stupid it's unfunny. 
---
"It's in X game, it shouldn't be on our game"
---
Like, how stupid can you get?
---
use achievement diaries or quests as a goal instead! that’s how i’m approaching it - getting 70 agility for SoTE and for some diaries vs. earning back the shit i dropped a month. good luck man!!
---
Just like the og dragonstone armor design
---
They are a booming range task to do.
---
What I've learned about r/2007scape is that all the people at "new" are always the most negative, so I'll be dismissing your comment.
---
Literally the first people at u/bLbGoldeN 's post are all negative comments.
---
you don't get hp xp for splashing
---
dont risk what youre not prepared to loose. also you can change your ip and not go to dodgey teamspeaks and websites. it falls on the player not the game.
---
Damn
---
I think its just something to do when im working on a towboat for 4 weeks, its 1am, we're just cruising up the river, and I run the deck so me and my deckhand work on wildly slayer while all them salad boys are asleep.
---
It would be really cool if they had a list (unofficial or official) of second or third themes for worlds. 
---
This would be a great place to put social things like agility or country themes. 
---
For example: obviously there won’t be a server for every country so perhaps we could make a theme for them on a close world. (I.e. Italian players theme, UK server), New Zealand world on Australian server? 
---
I think 46 was the agility world back in the day.
---
LMAO imagine paying $420 to attempt to swing the outcome of warding
---
How’s the blackjacking been going?
---
There is no evidence to suggest Mother Teresa ever told someone to reject pain relief.
---
For sure. I’ve spoken to other folks about that very concept, where perhaps Warding unfortunately worked against itself by not being something a player had ever explicitly asked for (at least not as an entirely new skill). Moulding &amp; shaping a new skill with the community will be vital if it’s ever going to gain traction, and that probably does need to include its inception too. Bringing ideas to Jagex, not Jagex bringing ideas to us. 
---
Again, keep up the good stuff. :)
---
If your boss is fine with you lookin at some fat milky elf udders on the job you got the ideal workplace my guy
---
Ummmmm.... my friend and I legit were talking about this a while back as an idea. I even suggested it in a osrs survey about new skill ideas. Really happy to see that other people are having the same ideas!
---
he has like a dead stare and points at Robert while nodding, yes
---
I’m pretty sure the I don’t want to max argument was entirely strawmaned into existence.
---
1st - Castlewars - can't active set bonuses due to missing helmet for hood / cape slot. 
---
2nd - Wearing blue chaps instead of void bottom (therfore no set bonus).
---
3rd - Wearing mixed sets of barrows Verac / Karil's / (Ahrim's top? - pic 2 blurry) therefore no set bonuses. 
---
4th - Has 3/4 Guthans pieces, however is wearing a Neitz helm, therefore no set bonus is active.
---
Imagine being stupid enough to think that was an attempt to flex mining levels and completely missing the actual point.
---
Like I said, this sub is fill with brainlets.
---
Good skill and suggestion, therefore it won’t pass a poll
---
If you have your mind set on staying f2p finish all f2p quest
---
Thank you. Yeah, just noticed the link is botched on mobile for some reason
---
Every other boss like bandos, zulrah, or vork requires 90s in your cb stats to kill them. You shouldn't be making the same gp/hr with 70s in mining, rc, and smithing compared to a kid with 90s in those stats.
---
Pitter patter
---
Even weirder then is that it is noticeably worse on my computer with GPU from rl
---
So its farming, construction, hunter, crafting in one skill? It's a bit much and I think you put a great amount of effort into it. But it's not needed in osrs.  That being said I encourage you to build it into your own game, I for one would try it out.
---
I have 79 agility and have done like 10-12 laps. Im not sure about the xp per hour but I'm almost postive it can be done at 70 agility
---
Have you... not played the game? At the very least swampletics would illuminate this for you. If you dont know what swampletics is, then why are you commenting on this post if not to ask what it is, since this is a very direct reference to the most recent video.
---
The limit is still there for me. Although I noticed about 30 minutes of no issues earlier today but the issues are back again.
---
Always wonder how the devs really feel about this community, like not the bullshit pr cop out omg we love how passionate our fanbase is. Also kinda funny how entitled some people act on this sub when id say this is probably one of the more mature communitys in terms of the average players age lol.
---
This was my first thought when I saw this lmao
---
Consider it done.
---
Streamers are probably going for speedruns, and the issue with speedruns is that if you go for fast times, you under-prep or make risky plays that lead to you dying. Going for the best runs isn't the same as going for the most consistent runs, and it's often true that the fastest/best runs are worse than just playing consistently. Chambers of Xeric Challenge Mode is another example of content where this is the case.
---
Could you address (if not already) the fact that monsters that have full health can still not drop loot for ironmen if they kill it. Surely you can have a warning which indicates to players that the monster has already been damaged by someone else so that you don't waste time and items.
---
This is why the HCIM mode is utter sillyness
---
Just long hands, his arms are normal
---
The bay area is insane I dont know how people do it
---
They are proposing a buff to it, so I'd assume no.
---
Bread and pasta 🥖 🍝
---
Can Mod Wolf be my osrs BF. I would give him furry fashionscape and make him carry my whip
---
N..nice
---
I agree that it's frustrating taking so much damage through prayer from the Gauntlet boss, but you gotta keep in mind that if you reduce it too much, it makes the armor a lot less useful.  The gauntlet isn't just a boss fight; what makes it unique is prep, and 75% reduction with prayer would make gathering materials a waste of time for most people. I'm not sure what the best course of action is, maybe 75% reduction with prayers would be fine if you also give the armor some offensive bonuses so it's still worthwhile to make.
---
Youre my favorite jmod
---
I just know value (qualities) and rarity (scarcity) carries price
---
If value increases, price also follows. IF value is deleted, price will follow too. Without the dude in my cc by thursday I would have lost the bis gloves and 30m
---
It looked good on mobile.
---
i guess you could say it needs to evolve am i right guys
---
If it weren't for the beer bellies, and the Justiciar set existing, Barrows armour would be my favourites
---
Lol it really is something to watch, this is the only game subreddit I check and don't bother much with any other games but this has to be special with just the osrs community?  Every gaming sub cant be this big of a dysfunctional family.
---
You stop right there
---
Yeah, I think it looks the best too.
---
Ahh thanks!
---
This really needs to be reposted, id love to see this and a green version added at some point
---
It's way more xp to do damage. People only splash because you can AFK for much longer than other methods. It's only if you want to afk for 15 mins at a time and you also have the cash to spend on all the extra runes.
---
Oh yea you're right. Don't know how I missed that lol.
---
Im
---
Bad take lol. We're paying customers
---
No, EOC would definitely get below 50% and be shut down relatively quickly because of overwhelming negativity in the poll.
---
The same thing happened with partnerships, something like 30% of people voted yes to them, I think?
---
I understand what you're saying about a large portion of the community voting yes to so many things, but there are some things that this community has strong opinions on. Don't even pretend EoC has anywhere near that much support. I don't care if it was an example, don't even pretend for a second that more than half of this community is dumb enough to want the Devolution of Wombats.
---
It's like that same old shitty slippery slope bullshit argument that new skills will turn this game into Runescape 3. This community might be full of idiots but only maybe 25% of people in this community actually sniff glue and eat asbestos.
---
"Just caring about the game" is the most overused excuse on this sub. Obviously, there's reasonable frustrations with Jagex, but please, people, just accept the fact that a vast chunk of the OSRS community has legitimately turned people away from the game.
---
Whats that have to do with him being downvoted, just because he was lazy and didnt feel like questing on an alt?
---
So you agree with me then?
---
Because 1t with base 70s will beat base 90s every time and that’s the problem with abusing the mechanics there’s no fairness about it.
---
MVP is a toxic mechanic because you have people 1.5ting, the best meta right now if you want pet + best loot is to find a group of the worst players and go in their and 1.5t to guarantee MVP
---
Yeah, I just get high and AFK shit.
---
I think an unofficial list would be cool.
---
But, they added a world for sulliscep cutting lol, they should add one for agility too.
---
The crystal halberd is a pretty shit weapon. Making it useful as a main weapon would require a massive buff, and I really can't imagine people are going to bring a crystal armor switch just for the spec. So it would only even be useful if you're already using the crystal amour and want to spec. That seems like a really niche use.
---
The one day the tables turned. That glorious day, a gamer rose up to smackdown the mods.
---
How many unintended and unchecked changes came in with this update? Quest changes, gear buffs. This needs to be better, it's not fair to your playerbase to bring in items and make changes this big that are just ooopsy daisies.
---
Nice. Yeah it’s annoying.
---
Found the auto clicker
---
Thats what i did for the 3000 
---
Exept i meant what i said and lapped them all, good times
---
My post was mainly referencing people complaining about MVP mechanic and that someone with worse stats isn't getting as much loot as people with maxed stats.
---
Some kid literally said to me "Watching some sweaty max cape kid make 5x what you get is fun?"
---
Glad you enjoyed man!
---
I have slowly drifted away from playing runescape over the last year and a half, but still follow the updates. I had heard of the warding skill that failed the poll, I didn't know much about the skill but it seemed lack luster. I have to be honest after reading this post, if this skill were to be implemented into the game I would subscribe and play again. This skill well being more simple really peaks my interest. It seems similar to some of the skills I really enjoyed when I played. (Farming, runecrafting, and Hunter)
---
Good on you, that's quite some going!
---
nah, thanks
---
Gold is currently about 0.52-0.6 atm, atleast for me it is
---
9,194 it's not hidden lol
---
construction is something you can only train for money...
---
oh wait.
---
slayer?
---
I think your design is neat as hell, but yeh not really for what you were going for. More as another cosmetic version of rune. Good work though!
---
Pussy, lol.
---
It has been noted. Will do that when i'm at the heroes' quest part. Thanks
---
Smash the barbarian assault speed WR next vid pls
---
It's pretty meh tbh. The lack of enemies in the library makes it a very chill (if not still annoying) puzzle.
---
That was a miss click on my part my bad
---
Abu Zubaydah?
---
Most uni degrees are 4 years long and he’s done that playing a game in actual fucking game time.
---
I’ve played A LOT of rs in my life, I’ve got probably 300-400m xp on all my accs on osrs and I have like 4000 hours and a shitload of those are multilogged and bank standing and afked. I have no idea how anyone can play something for so long and not get burnt out
---
should’ve watched the vid when it came out
---
I have never once said instances are great. I have only said that they are a strong feature of MMO’s and MMO gameplay. That is a fact and is not up for debate. You are welcome to start listing reasons why instanced are bad, but just saying not having them is more fun and better isn’t a reason. That’s just you rehashing your opinion.
---
Why is it more fun? What impacts do they have? Why are those impacts good or bad for the game? Those are actual questions that are relevant.
---
“Instances are bad because they’re not MMO-like” is a brainlet argument. Your talk of the good old days is an attempt to appeal to nostalgia, not an actual argument.
---
What a mountain of text but I'll sort thru it.
---
1. Yes, you can leave and come back without being lost. I play off and on myself every few months.
---
2. You can play with either the main client or runelite, cause OSRS is Java based, which is cross platform. Just look for jar files instead of exe files when downloading.
---
3. Runelite offers UI scaling.i use it myself.
---
4. Just pay attention to any warnings when entering somewhere new. Aka wilderness, boss areas, God wars dungeon, etc. Don't take items into the wilderness you are not prepared to lose. 
---
Just focus on having fun.
---
5. You can build a house via the construction skill
---
ah, yes... social peer pressure. the classic. it's cool to break rules and do illegal things. that's how you get the girls.
---
If you care about the aesthetic and look of the chat heads and such you won’t like it, it also makes it really obvious who is the villain! It took me like 3 hours to do, but priff is neat, you should do it!
---
thats some effort bro good shit take the upvote
---
Do you call the girl at McDonald's a cunt when she fucks up your burger? They miscalculated. They're polling a change. People are dicks.
---
Not worth doing?! Dude the boss is around 2m+/h with a 35-40m unique (crystal tool seed) on a crowded world for non-mvps with zero gear/skill requirements beyond completing the quest and its requirements. Not to mention it's very easy and the only challenge you face is making sure you get a couple hits in. This is absolutely incredible for a mid-level player who is not able to do high level pvm money makers. That said, mvp should probably be changed or removed. I'd say the biggest issue is only 1 player getting a pet roll since solo'ing is so awful.
---
POWER RANGERS, GO!

No world exists in which purple is good for metal armor.
---
I used his guide and no wiki and it was fine. Slayermusiq is really good about taking out unecessary steps
---
Hence why the Lunar Staff is made from a Dramen Staff. IIRC it's *underground* on the moon, though.
---
If only there was less clicking, would be perfect lol
---
I'll carry ur whip. meet me in wildy where we can get wild bb
---
Try Ironman mode. The progression of an account feels much more natural. You don't grind for gp/hr you go for gear and stats you need.
---
thanks
---
 "Pest elimination"
---
That just sounds like a fancy word for "You need to slay 124 Mutated Grubworms in the Falador Farming patch dungeon."
---
;)
---
It would thematically make less sense if you received duplicates way before having the ability to enter the fishing guild. No one wants to hit a 1/2500 drop and shout “yay I will now receive 50 bass”
---
who
---
There literally was a Tbows spawning glitch at farming guild and you think this is intended?
---
Transferred gold to alt account ... How i did it atleast
---
yeah, that's what i did next i just had gotten the drop and wanted to screenshot. i wouldn't stand there and just waste ppots like that xd
---
To me what is sad is the negative stigma on buying/selling gold in game is completely gone, it used to be something that people would do, just not openly discuss it and accept it. All the nuance is completely gone and people openly discuss, brag, even suggest to people where and how to go about it. Truly sad as gold farmers supporting these sites hurts the entire player base.
---
I'm pretty sure he immolated himself in protest of the Catholic/Buddhist violence in south Vietnam and Ngo Dinh Nhu's south Vietnamese raids on Buddhist temples like Xa Loi Pagoda.
---
I can’t even do one of these
---
&gt;Yes, for you. If that's important for you then go ahead but someone else is complerely free to live like they please.
---
Right, that's why I specified "in my opinion." Also I am working in R&amp;D in a field that I think important, because (as I said) it's important to me that my work has an impact.
---
The consumerism part is bullshit - of course we buy into consumerism. By the nature of the developed world, you essentially have to for the sake of practicality. That doesn't mean you can't still strive to make a difference, and it doesn't limit the impact you can have. It's a lame excuse to justify not trying, when in reality it should be used as motivation to try even harder.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes

I havent seen him since may i think.

Computer programs don't make mistakes. Programmers and users do. A bug is a mistake that isn't the fault of the user.
---
Great idea! I’ve thought of some skills too! My idea is kingship, you buy “land” and reign over it and have it produce recourses. I could go into deeper depth but I’m only taking a break from studying
---
Fake news nice try tho
---
Agree with this, I'd rather reword this question as "looking into MVP system as the problem" not just tick manipulation. MVP hoarding can be like 4-5m+ gp/hr ATM, which would look incredibly OP, but the rest of the team isn't getting anywhere nearrrr that.
---
ok?
---
Damn! Really good idea and amazing post,  Warding compared to this is nothing
---
We've done nothing but ask for high APM skilling content comparable to PvM content that yields good rewards for YEARS and now we're complaining that clicking a rock should be the actual go to method of getting rewards
---
Very down with this. Seems amazing. Give farming a little more content to help out the grind.
---
I fail to see the problem here
---
I was thinking it's a perfect spot for a bush patch or something like a belladonna that only has one patch in game ATM.
---
Hell, even another crystal related farming patch (doesn't have to be another tree(
---
A majority of people that voted no on the first question skipped the remaining answers or just said no because they said no to the first question and just wanted to say no all the way down. You may have been one of the hundred thousand that took the time to choose yes or no but I assure you that wasn't how many of the no voters did it.
---
I’ve RWT easily 2bill + at this point (gambling problem :D) And never received a ban. A buddy of mine bought 20m and got banned lol
---
Because in Runescape sounds which for the most part players find annoying shouldn't provide an advantage.
---
Put side by side, the right one looks a lot closer lol especially to RS3's ancients rune. But i think if you change the helm on either people stop saying that.
---
Lmao at this point I think literally anybody other Jagex is more qualified than Jagex to design things for this game
---
you dont need to complete mountain daughter to get the head
---
well i saw him 3ting barb while doing zulrah on a dif post so I was fooled.
---
New players don’t understand that this game exists because of RS3, and old players don’t realize this game will go nowhere and die with themselves at the wheel.
---
Oh wait really? Thank you so much!
---
nice.
---
Had Armadyl for awhile but it was crap so bought Karils 😂

Classic Jagex, useless company

Looks much better. Just hate having the massive shoulder guards. Feel a wonky and out of place.

&gt;if you went to Bandos or literally any other boss, those sweaty maxed kids would get the loot instead of you.

literally any other boss except the other skilling boss you mean

Add warding first

SPOILERS JFC

Some prime r/subredditdrama

Or maybe several of those years were in school and he stayed logged in afking while doing homework every single day, as one does.
---
Within the first few days too. This dude better win a gnome for his 18 firecape video. He pushes the game just like swampman - to its purest limits
---
Happy cake day brother :)
---
Are you planning on unskull pking?
---
So I guess no one remembers 10 and 15 year vet capes.
---
I really dont like this
---
SoA is easy enough that you can make a new account and do it with yourself. It sucks, but it's a last resort.
---
As for Heroes Quest if you're in Phoenix Gang I'm pretty sure the only thing you need is to get the Pete's Candlestick, and I have like 10 of those in my bank for people who need it. Heroes Quest is definitely better designed, since you can help people once you've finished the quest.
---
It’s not “illegal” it’s just against jagex TOS and generally just results in a temp ban for first offenses. It’s also extremely rare that they actually catch it and act on it unless you’re doing it very frequently for very large amounts.
---
If the alternative is getting my account held ransom by jagex for hundreds of dollars, then I’ll take that risk.
---
Why do you persist in acting like a child? Instead of coming up with an actual reason for your opinions you’ve just replied aggressively. You have the emotional intelligence of an 8 year old
---
I feel like I'm starting to see a cycle going on here... 
---
Jagex releases item --&gt; Jagex nerfs items after release --&gt; player posts, discussing gp loss from the nerf --&gt; op get lambasted by others saying you deserved it
---
True, but there's what, four clue steps around the Legends Guild? And charge dragonstone scrolls are 214gp each right now.
---
the nature of this game tends to attract the type of people who prefer..."rigidity" lmao. there is a large portion who don't want change or do want change but only if its perfect and all ramifications are known beforehand. as if the developers would just allow economy-breaking, game-ruining updates to go unchecked for any amount of time.
---
A human requires around 10 000 hours to master a skill.
---
He could be a sculptor, a painter, a musician and almost a black belt judoka with those hours.

Worlds are instances. Runescape has always had instances.
---
Dust devils are not, and were never aggro.
---
Yes clearly the difficulty of hopping worlds was nothing compared to the hours of temple trekking or catching lizards.

Has anyone received a ban from using a touchscreen computer? I was ban for macroing so I thought it had something to do with runelite so I quit using it and mostly play on mobile but will sometimes play on the pc. I have a mouse that I do some movements and clicking with but sometimes it’s more convenient to just touch the screen. I could understand why it would be deemed as such but I’d like to dispute it but on the webpage it links me too says I’m not able to??? Has anyone else had this issue?
---
I'm so proud of this community
---
Can i PM you my IGN so you can add me later tonight? I wanted to complete the heroes quest and i'm in the phoenix gang.
---
I would really appreciate it. Is the item tradeable after the quest is started or i need to be at a certain step to accept it?
---
These look awesome!
---
The “just revert it cunt” had me dying lmfao
---
I haven't thought that far yet, I will be getting prayer, but I was thinking of stopping at 13 for the time being. If I do id just bring 50k in gp plus an emblem
---
Chat heads and character models looking like complete shit is not a small deal.

whats raids 2 without scythe?

Get uBlock Origin? It's 2019 dude

Can I get a link to the new models?

yeah I do. Autocorrecct is a cruel bitch.

If you got banned for buying GP from Gold Farmers these websites would not have any customers. Jagex has said before, publically, that they do not care about buyers - only sellers.
