Alright thanks mate!

I'm working on agility and mining as 2 of my last skills for base 90s myself. Funny how I always seem to "coincidentally" take a break from the game any time I need to grind out one of those two. Slow and steady does it tho.
---
Having an odd legacy 2003 server is actually fairly common in places (not that I'm saying it's ok).
---
And tell me how a PvP key system/emblem system that is balanced around ~500k an hour is going to be abused more than the current bots?
---

---
You can purchase 10x zulrah accounts for around $200, and suicide bot them over the weekend for 50m profit PER ACCOUNT. Literally every worthwhile boss in runescape is responsible for bringing massive amounts of gold into the game via alchables alone (not including uniques), please don't bother telling me that something like this hurts PvP. 100% of PvP interaction outside of BH is already a net loss in GP (supplies and untradeables dropping values below their worth to repair/buy), whereas I'd say 99.9% of PvM interactions are a net gain in GP.
---
It's not that it doesn't run on Unix based systems, it's that the plugin currently requires OpenGL 4.3 to run and Mac dropped support for OpenGL versions past 4.1.  There's some work being done to replace the compute shaders used in 4.3 and their GLSL to OpenCL but it may be some time.

If any of these stories are at all accurate and jamflex is seriously letting people recover accounts with just ONE old password, thats fucking insanely terrible. I mean Jesus. Never known a worse support gaming company when it comes to shit like this lol. 
---
Also - bank pin is 100% the best way to save your items. To answer you OP, theres a multitude of things that could be going on. Scan your PC for viruses for one, if you haven't..second, idk if you can or not but update your recovery questions and set a difficult password.

God I hate upvote memes. A lot of subreddits have cracked down on them, but you can still see "Upvote if" slip through.
---
What a unit.

Fabulous. Really hope we can see more from you, you've got a fan in me.

"Officer, he left me completely naked, except for my wallet, shirt, and socks!"

---
You're just mad cause your facial complexion wasn't as pure as theirs.
---
It's okay though, you're still a cutie.
---
The stagnation of memes at me_irl is just indicative of our lives slowly grinding to a halt, where the idealistic pursuit of new and exciting things fades out with the lethargy of unfulfilling and menial routine, leaving us only wanting to live out those glory days of the classic memes and wishing for a day when our depression memes were still ironic in nature.

Works for me on Linux Mint with the latest Mesa drivers. However it toggles off every time I restart the client, and you kinda have to spam the toggle button to get it to turn on for some reason.
---
After that it works great though.
---
Inferno is definitely a high jump that not a lot of geared players are even capable of doing. Start with some smaller challenges, perhaps a checklist of requirements for quests, some elite diaries, Raids 1 or 2, and then work from there.

I personally found Lumbridge Elite to be very rewarding due to how often I used fairy rings, and getting prepped and then hopping into ToB was a challenging but rewarding experience too.

Life long Fluency in german or 99 slayer is defo a tricky one.. maybe somewhere in between!

Congrats man!
---
are you asking if you can out dps the healers with 98 range and dragon darts? depending on your gear and if you're on task, yes you can, but it really isn't that hard to line up the healers. i'm also not sure if you'd be up to doing a dart switch if you're "dreadful at flicking," but you do you. bring chins to tag the healers all at once then do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_eCUNtUMt8) to get them all in a line. practice in nmz if you'd like.
---
remember you also have, like, twelve years to switch prayers correctly. jad's animations are ridiculously long. log out before jad and make yourself some tea or jerk off or something to calm your nerves. pray rigour or whatever your equivalent is through the entire fight, focus on your switches, and don't panic pot.
---
you've got this dude, don't sweat it.
---
Nice man, first fire cape is a solid achievement.
---
So anyway what the fuck is up with your post history and, as a follow up, what happened ~6 months ago to break you out of whatever that is and into runescape?
---
Man inflation is too real. Back in the day gfs only cost 10k! Jamflex needs to institute a universal basic income so that everyone can afford such basic necessities

Don‚Äôt forget about the item value for drops and monster HP. Also agility click spots. I could probably go on for hours about this...

I have faith, but it was very unfair of Apple to just delete the most popular API in the world from their OS just because they were struggling to puff up Metal.

Oh well, developers will just write a Metal translation layer.

IMO if you have a Mac and want to play OSRS, you're better off just installing Windows in boot camp. Macs have excellent GPUs compared to low-end PCs, so it shouldn't pose a problem anymore once you switch away from Apple's SpiteOS.

Disappointing that the potions passed. I guess PvMers will vote yes to anything that makes slayer more afk.

Also, I guess preserve is dead content now.
---
75 ranged for blowpipe ideally, and 43 prayer at least. 70 defense is nice for veracs skirt. I probably did it around 81 ranged, 80 hp, 65 prayer after 7 tries.

I camped them for 4 days averaging 800+ kills a day and I‚Äôm finally got it. On runelite (idk if I missed a plug-in?) it doesn‚Äôt tell you in chat that you got an untradable so I kept my loot tracker on. Got about 4 whips and I finally got it. Gl!
---
Those lower prices on things like runes and arrows also make it much easier for low/midlevel accounts to actually get resources to level. Back in the day, the prices of arrows and runes were a massive constraint to leveling range and mage which is why so many accounts back then were so heavily tilted towards melee stats only. Now 5gp runes and 30gp Mith Darts mean that low levels dont need as much starting capital to train stats and can actually move on to meaningful content rather than mining coal or crafting fire runes or whatever. The other benefit is that newer players can easily get a good idea of the market price for an item as soon as they want it which is much improved from '06 where a newer player looking for a gear upgrade would get absolutely trashed by the career merchers who spent all day at Fally taking advantage of them.

I just finished my cape and MEP2 is without a doubt the worst because of that ledge. It's infuriating losing all your food and prayer points to it. Even if you're smart about it, you will probably come very close to having to bank each time. Failing, losing health, and having to run back like 25 seconds all while your prayer is draining down... It's not like you can just flick it either, since it's in multi and the ghosts travel about somewhat randomly.
---
The MM2 obstacles are a joke by comparison. DS2 is harder than either, but it's harder because it's has the most challenging quest bosses -- it's my favorite quest.

Depends how much time you have to play and what you do. if your only goal is to sustain a bond then it would be pretty easy to do so but if you actually wanna play the game i would recommend paying for a few months til its easy to make a few 100k a day
---
Sounds good man!

Don‚Äôt fuck furries mate.

and the fact that they‚Äôre all max CB, that takes a crazy amount of dedication

I believe the client you are referring to is Runelite, I use it sometimes. If you decide to download Runelite make sure you go to the correct website, Runelite.net. There are a lot of copies of the website on the internet that may steal your account details. If you're scared to get haked I'd recommend sticking with the default client.

Also tons of YouTubers have done a self sustaining membership from F2P type video series. They are pretty informative, but like the other scholar mentioned, with the twitch promo you‚Äôll have a massive advantage. If I‚Äôm remembering correctly, Raiksey has a video series like that. But there‚Äôs a million different money makes out there that can make a bond in a month if you just stick to it.
---
I feel like Jagex should have explained battlemage and bastion potions... Kinda pathetic those didn‚Äôt pass. That‚Äôs a pretty significant buff to melee vs ranged in a lot of scenarios. I feel like it should either be all those potions or none of them. I don‚Äôt understand how people can vote no to questions they don‚Äôt understand. Either look it up or skip it.
---
Well yeah that‚Äôs clear. Just the state don‚Äôt make sense. All have 69 WC, 28 fishing, 31 smithing, 41 farming, 46 crafting and 25 thieving. 
---
Every bot the same exact stats. None really make much sense to me. Not max mage or range though
---
I appreciate that bro

They look like they have diversity so it's assumed to be less likely to be picked up by algorithms, but no one knows the algorithms so it's just a speculation.

Oh, fair enough. I recall there being a dwarf in Keldagrim that could let you customize them further. So they DO have an established presence other than some arbitrary stylization. As for lore/practicality, maybe player characters were former slaves from Tutorial ~~Prison~~ Island released to start a new life after having their memories wiped.

Exactly. Tbh its laughable when people bring up graphics as a selling point for rs3/osrs/rs in general lol. The games never been about graphics or visuals really. I mean, like i said in another reply i could find dozens of free MMOs on steam with high quality really good graphics. RS has..unique..? visuals, but they don't compare to your typical run of the mill open world rpg lol. 
---
Dont get me wrong im a big traditional mmo person - I love them. Im not a fan of rs3 for several reasons, one being mtx and another being that RS just doesn't "work" as your standard mmo. So it ends up just feeling weird compared to your standard ones out there, since its still a top down point and click game. I dont trash it like most osrs players - to each their own. But for me Ive never bothered with it because of what i stated above, its a top down point and click mmo and that just feels weird to me when theyre trying to be a more traditional mmorpg.
---
I'd assume they're all quested the same exact way and the skills are the outcome of that

what makes this a meme? 0/10

My whole osrs experience has been me dunking on kid me and doing all the things kid me couldn‚Äôt do because I was too noob

I won big at duel arena, went from 200m to 2.7b over a few weeks. You know, the whole 'okay time to leave for real' and I kept going back. So at 2.7b, I meant it for real. I was done. I went pking for a bit, to have some fun. Got skull tricked for claws, so I thought to myself - okay, I'll just sell my tbow and stake again, but only to get claws back. So off I go to g/e, sell my tbow for instasell, 984m at time. I tele to the duel arena and BAM.
---
Worst sound a man has ever heard, as he gets teleblocked. I immediately tried to hop, was using osbuddy at the time. At the time when you hopped in combat with osbuddy, it'd just xlog you. When I got back in, I found myself in Egdeville with 2gp and a tent whip. Sold the rest of my bank and rage staked, got cleaned. Still have all the placeholders in my bank as a reminder.

I mean, the potions have been in the game since TOB, which isn't exactly fresh content. Seemingly people don't know what the potions are so a couple of thousands voted no (maybe confused they were adding new potions?). Either way you still get divine ranged potions and divine super defense potions, you just lose 1 inventory slot when using range which is fair imo.
---
Hahaha what a story mark!

&gt;more rewarding

Slayer is already the most rewarding skill in the game lol

Social engineering to mislead someone to unwillingly give personal information which is later used to commit a crime should still be bannable lol

Hey Guys! Current total level is 620 with combat around 50. I've completed all free to play quests and have a little more than 1 mill in the bank. What should I be looking to do as I transition into membership? I get one week of free membership with mobile, and I'm fine paying for membership for a trial month. Early on this account, I bought membership and did Client of Kourend, Fishing Contest, and Gertrude's Cat as well as started both Druidic Ritual and Waterfall Quest before I got busy with school.
---
I was considering following the Optimal Quest guide, but am trying to find an idea of the path I should forge as I try to self-sustain membership after my trial week and a month. What goals would you recommend I should be working towards to achieve having a self-sustaining member account? I've been looking at some videos, but I feel a bit lost in all the options and would love some definite steps I should take before/as I look to jump into membership. Right now, almost all of my stats are in the 40s/50s. Should I bring everything up to 50 first?
---
Thanks for the hep!

Do you have up to date gpu drivers? It never does that to me even on Linux.
---
I 100% agree, on the internet there is something called the "ignore button" that isnt there IRL that can be used if some stranger on the internet who knows nothing about you is actually offending you that much.
---
I really hate the people who cry "toxicity" about EVERY little thing these days, I dont know when it became "ok" to cry about every little thing and be offended about everything but quite frankly youd be called a crybaby and dismissed if you did that in the past. Instead, today youre often praised for such things. People really need to stop being such pussies to put it in the most real way possible.
---
Not that I support people who are overtly racist or sexist or homophobic but I also dont care if someone wants to make themselves look like a loser spamming shit like that on a game, it means nothing to me. 
---
The only shit that should actually be acted upon is stuff like ragging in PvP which is a big problem or in PvM people who will follow you and grief you, and other ways of griefing im surely missing. 
---
Remember, sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me..people need to start remembering that again in 2019.

If you wait 30s before hopping you'll never hit the limit.

What the hell... that is actually insane
---
He is overly dramatic, you know he‚Äôs upset when he starts stuttering
---
Ragging should 100% be bannable, there are losers in this game who will legit spend all their time ragging you all day long for even weeks or months. Its a rather significant problem in PvP.
---
Some of the more mentally unwell people who PvP who probably are projecting their real life frustrations in game will literally start ragging you just for killing them or attacking them or some other pretty insignificant shit...those people need to either be banned or get help IRL, preferably both.
---

---
The skip % from supercombat to battlemage/bastion is a 25% increase, it seems people are unfamiliar with the potions. Most likely because they've only been in the game for a year and they're relatively niche.
---
These were amazing rewards. Some are a bit deprecated, but a majority could really spice up free to play PKing, especially if they are untraceable and only obtained when playing the minigame.

I love the pet but this is funny as fuck

4th attempt, my third was a couple of hours ago, I lost because I was paranoid about getting hit with Jad's melee (first time using bp at jad) so I kept moving away to target healers and missed the prayer switch.

Big oof. I just got another Jad task though (three in one day?!) so I'm gonna get some sleep and give it another shot tomorrow.

Best of luck. I remember my first cape.... hope you get it!
---
Some things yeah, I agree, but most features really should be in the base client. And they don't have anything that osbuddy doesn't have in the paid version, which jagex allows.
---
Do you have time to talk about our lord and saviour runelite?
---
Now THIS is socialism I can get behind
---
The offenders do get banned, I think the damage is already done at that point. That sort of stuff certainly doesn't give the game a good name, and there have definitely been times when I've heard about that sort of stuff happening and I've seriously questioned whether or not I want to play a game where people can act like such blatant pieces of shit. Obviously OSRS is hardly the only place on the internet (or real life) where people do shitty things, but it's still unequivocally a bad thing for the game and for all of us.
---
It does get back to the original issue that a lot of people have been raising though--there's (probably?) not much that Jagex can do to stop that sort of behavior aside from reactively banning people who have already engaged in it. Any solution has to get to the root of the problem, which has to do with psychological problems and unhealthy relationships and many other complex issues which long precede this game. I think it's not just up to Jamflex, but ultimately all of us to make the community one worth being a part of.

Not always. Some servers stay old and no one moves the software because no one knows how to set it up again. Or new OS versions break the software and no one knows how to fix it.

Bump up def and buy dharok set. For full afk experience use guthans
---
The Scythe only works under specific conditions. The Rapier has no conditions; it just works. It is the BiS General Melee DPS Weapon and I believe the BiS Non-Degrading Weapon across all styles. There are enough niche weapons that surpass it that it doesn't have a ton of uses, but that doesn't mean it isn't still best at what it does or that it needs a buff. It is a successor to the Abyssal Whip and that is not a small thing.
---
They brings me back to being 13 in 04.
---
Well, then don't do it if it's a chore. Not once did I suggest that anyone should be obligated to do anything that they enjoy. However, I think that if they do genuinely enjoy it, as I do, then judging them for spending their time how they like is pretty silly. Also you keep talking about maxing as though it's something that needs to be done in such a short span of time that it necessitates you sit there for tens of hours straight to accomplish it. Sure if you want to do it in 6 months, maybe. But if it's a goal that you're slowly burning towards over years, then not at all.

Because all original accounts are still on RS3. OSRS uses new servers, and so none of the stats/items carried over
---
It doesn't get security updates anymore (except in very severe instances... it's happened a couple times).
---
It could be useful but guess they haven't thought of anything, yall remember in rs2 around 2011/2012 when dwarf hand cannons were around and your FM  level played a part in using it
---
Good choice my man
---
Yeah I was thinking of soloing it but that's like less xp and gp perhour
---
Thank you!! I'm so happy it's so well received and everyone can come together and ride the nostalgia cloud for Elvarg!!
---
they already did. dailies are UBI
---
Do some quests, train some other skills, go do some pest control, go PK, do some slayer, etc. I get what you‚Äôre saying though lol but there is a shit ton of other stuff to do to take a break some fire making
---
Thank you so much!!
---
Yano,things OSRS don't implement in their own client/game, because it makes it easy Scape and shouldn't be allowed, you want RS3 cause this I how you get RS3.
---
What next? Spins? Solomons? Dung?
---
idk why but the 'Are you fucking serious man' from the skill specs edition of pkin runescape streamers fucking KILLS me...I would make it a ring tone if it was 2003.

Stop worrying about efficiency and gp and you‚Äôll have fun

Giant mole

very smooth brain indeed
---
They should do half xp weekends. Encourage us to go outside.
---
The dlc better be good
---
Nah
---
Thanks, I'm trying again tomorrow. Idk why but I'm focused on my first Jad kill being a slayer task, it's taken forever lol.
---
Ya I'm thinking of dropping a few mils to get some crafting level or maybe get 80 Smith lol
---
crashing or just freezing? Because for me with gpu mode when I open the client, it freezes for 1-2 minutes while loading everything. But if you wait a bit it unfreezes and then I can play with no problems at all. Try disabling hardware acceleration for the runelite.exe tho.
---
Yeah I'm slowly getting there, questing is hard af on mobile tho lmao
---
Because his birthday is every fucken day
---
It‚Äôs ok. You‚Äôll get past it.
---
FULL obsidian armor with berserker necklace and the sword. It's going to be better than dharoks until 90+ combat stats. I think 94 hp is when dharoks is considered better.
---
Make sure you get dragon defender + dragon boots as well.
---
Dharok is shit at those stats, wait til 90+ hp and str before using it.
---
Until then run full obsidian with berserker necklace and obby sword.
---
DO NOT ADDRESS TOXICITY
---
Used a cat. Got ptsd from spice farming with a kitten so i just afk skilled and did rag n bone while waiting. it only takes 3 hours for it to grow.
---
Bot farm turned ‚Äòalts‚Äô
---
You guessed right. Fedora Linux.
---
I wasn't aware that custom cursors were only working windows. I don't really mind though, since I just use my system cursor with osrs anyway. Still, it might be fun to use a d scim cursor every now and again. Maybe it will be fixed some time down the line, but it isn't exactly a deal breaker.
---
i dont like this
---
please stop, joshua
---
Yo he did chin ups to prove that he's not a nerd, wtf lol
---
Barrows is a nice goal with it being a very good early money maker. All you need to get it is 50 ranged for magic shortbow(i) and 50 mage/attack for iban's blast.
---
I hate this hacker and botter grrr
---
Yea, this game is something else  http://imgur.com/D5PznOC
---
I love how it captures the black void skybox
---
Like no joke. I second this from personal experiences, please get help I don‚Äôt wanna see another person get trapped in that mindset.
---
I would be instabanned.
---
Cos I don't cheat.
---
Only daily worth doing on RS3 was some xp challenges, viswax  and Robust Glasses if your crafting was that high up. If you're an IM probably only daily challenge is the good thing to do(But most of the time they are not IM friendly) and viswax  only when you get the auras finally then potion flask is end game content. 95% of the dailies are a waste of time and  xp waste or give poor compensation tbh. I barely did any dailies when I maxed in RS3.
---
I only discovered RS because back in the day i got bored of playing RobotRage and RuneScape was the most played game of Miniclip back then. It was truly a nice gaming platform of its time
---
there's a free month of membership with twitch prime currently, so there's always that
---
you got my vote bro! #SpookieBoysPls
---
I'd like to see more PMods in the game to mute the bots and toxic people and scammers. I can't even tell you the last time I saw a PMod in game.
---
It doesn't take more than 0.6 seconds to move cursor between 6 windows one at a time?
---
Cute noob here, I don't understand this but I want to
---
Honestly, you‚Äôll level up so quick now that you‚Äôre older. But as others have mentioned, your old account is in RS3 now. Everyone had to restart
---
Good for GE scavenging

No u.

Sure, if you call 50 ppl afking for thaler alive

I feel nothing but sympathy for you. I hope you get better soon man.

I liked this one.

Get a job and buy a new one. Then quit said job and go for max cape

is it weird im slightly aroused..

Hey guys, I was just wondering how I could improve my barrows runs? My current stats are 70 attack, strength and defence, 75 range, and 73 magic. I also have morytania hard diary done. My current set up is Ibans staff, fury, neitznot helm, torags plate and legs, dueling ring, barrows gloves, unholy book, god Cape. With my range set up being black dhide, rune crossbow with broadbolts, archer helm and avas. My inventory has fire runes, death runes, 2 prayer pots just in case of dhorak, karil or ahrim tunnel, barrows tele tabs and the rest being monkfish.  I average probably about a 8 min run and have about a 5mill cash stack right now. Cheers
---
Nice
---
go padres
---
He still needs the reality stone
---
Careful that you don't jinx yourself. Remember that post of an IM crafting a duplicate lmao.
---
Basically any content from August 2007 would be open to use and those players would have from the above date until the launch of OSRS (14th of Feb 2013). 
---
It's something that catches people all the time but think of OSRS as a completely new and seperate game to the runescape that you played as a kid rather than a different game-mode or way of displaying the same game.
---
berserker shield üëå

You could be Framed who died to Jad when Jad hit for 73 after Framed typing to Jad (for whatever fucking reason.)

I remember Chris Archie's YouTube channel being hacked or terminated, and Sparc Mac uploading a video linking it to Archie's other YouTube channel in an attempt to support him. And Archie saying something like, 'Thanks but i can't just throw away 5 years of hatred for someone'' Lmao idk why I remember this

Repost #1282893
---
But then PvM happened and it became pointless.
---
Does anyone actually enjoy skill specs
---
Well its pretty decent im 93 range 97 magic and im getting 3-4 kills trip, im using ring of suffering also which helps a lot
---
\*tips fedora\*
---
\*crash\*
---
Literally unplayable
---
Figured
---
Thats reassuring, thanks
---
It's a feature from 2009, this game is from 2007, so it wasn't removed, it was never added.
---
I was just messing around. I still would put the risk above 0. So even if it‚Äôs 0.001% etc, it‚Äôs higher then the solid 0 with the original client.
---
I have yet to try any third party client for this reason.
---
tes
---
Just because I played it in 2009 doesn't mean it was a feature added in 2009, could have been added in 2004 or some shit.
---
Telling people they scouted a good raid on a pvp world.  
---
The warning for hopping to a pvp world and and a high risk non-pvp world used to be identical so people who were tired &amp; doing late night raids would sometimes miss it.
---
If you could withdraw a preset inventory/gear set, that would be really nice for raids etc.
---
But it was added in 2009..
---
How is barb fishing afk? You fill an inventory in like 30 secs then spend 10 secs dropping it all. I've been doing monks and those are actually afk
---
Ye for sure, soulbound items won‚Äôt work in risky pvp areas :)
---
My dad got perm muted back in 07 for showing me this very thing . RIP to his chat until Quickchat came out .
---
Use a magic shortbow imbued, rune crossbow is trash. Get 2 levels for a trident, bring an occult for mage and upgrade your mage cape. The rest should be fine
---
When you're running 6 clients at once to maximise alt gains
---
Yes I do! I will look into that. Thanks
---
This deserves so much more upvotes.
---
You want flat 70s so you can use piety and aby dagger or ss, after that focus primarily on str
---
its weird that people look at this and are nostalgic whereas i look at it and see the darkest days of rs
---
i remember the day they added those hitsplats and it made me want to cut myself but i didnt because i didnt want to see that shitty hitsplat
---
Is there a use for mind runes? I'm at 70 magic and have about 13k mind runes from barrows. Wondering if its worth using a smoke staff and mind runes in NMZ vs just splashing for training mage?
---
NGL FoG would die so fast now a days. Also doubt any of the BiS F2P stuff would even pass making rewards non existant.
---
IMO if any old mini game would be added I think stealing creations would give the most bang for the buck.
---
Kieran looks like he's on Britains got Talent lmfao
---
Theres a certain regex string you can paste into the plugin settings. Shouldnt be hard to find on the runelite wiki or on reddit. It mutes all annoying spammers :)
---
Now ull have a runelite plugin that finds and attacks the target for u lol
---
Like.. where else would OP get it from?
---
but what if it was added in 2004?
---
I tried to learn TOB, my friend who do TOB have like 200+ kc and those who don't do TOB are like 0 kc, I tried to do with my friends who have kc but was basically dead weight which is kind of the reason I stopped

I personally don't like rune lite and mainly play from osbuddy, but I do use both. There are a couple features rune lite offers that's worth swapping client for a session.

Just grind out 1750 and never leave the total worlds.

Not sure what the peak hours are. Make sure you're in the dedicated BA world. Its an american world.

Popular Opinion: nostalgia boners for FoG are as strong as OSRS nostalgia boners, not all minigames are dead content (look at wintertodt) Free magic xp awesome rewards, robes, berserka shield and runecrafting gloves that keep you coming back. Competitive leaderboard and it's FUN üëå

Hi and welcome to my guide!

Why is construction in D? Extremely useful for convenience.
---
Disable anti alliassing see if that helps
---
they should remove alchables from hydra
---
It doesn't make anything more AFK. It makes a few things easier, like Demonic Gorillas and Clue Scrolls, but otherwise it's mostly QOL stuff.
---
It's definitely not considered botting. It doesn't do anything for you.
---
A mini hill giant would be cool but pets arent f2p

Remove a couple sentences and it's an ad.

Like the addy sword... first time I killed Elvarg was with full Addy armor and an addy battleaxe lol... on runescape classic
---
I always hop worlds in my dreams

With 60 range 59 str and 25 pray? Probably just bought and sold bonds and splashed or auto clicked till 94
---
So almost 8 hours a day playing OSRS? Congratulations with your weird flex or do you got a Summer break which you love to spent on OSRS? Just trying to get this post haha
---
Ppl been keeping gear because they go up for summers big update. This big update is gauntlet that has no gear requirements. Gear will not go up prior to update so ppl sell the extra items they been hoarding for it. A lot more items dropping than just zenyte
---
i returned in 13 but left due to lack of GE. GE is the one of the best additions to the game imo
---
Lmao can we get a jmod here
---
Honestly bring a magic comp bow and some arrows, way more chill for the healers
---
Hardly

Physically yes, but model No.  
---
I had my samsung galaxy note 8 recently replaced under insurance is there a way to allow access to more ram on mobile via the app or perhaps a setting?

I know that the adroid 9.0 cookie update i think its called screwed alot of apps up |:(
---
Yes, I completely agree with everything you said.

Why would anyone play a Runescape private server lmfao
---
Lumbridge
---
Never
---
Really depends on whether you maximise time. Could take a week or two.
---
You know that you can do nmz for melee combat multiple acc simultaneously, prayer is under 20 per acc, so having 1 maxed acc takes more time
---
I did a master where I had to get 90 wc, 80 crafting, 85 mining and just got some pure shit reward :C

Con is both insanely useful to the players and a great gold sink for the game?

What if they make another game and call it "Oldschool Scape Run" to attract their old players?

Your ip address changes daily. Usually it doesn't.

Thank you! Is a bit confusing that a pet counts as a duplicate, as with any other boss you can get duplicate pets.

Oh man I remember playing on dial up internet. My mom would be on the phone half the time and we couldn't tell her to get off or we would get beat lol

---
Make it diary requirement
---
i use vanilla client and I‚Äôve tried Konduit, osb, runelite, oshd, lyzrite and everything else.
---
The nostalgia bone for osrs died really quickly. This game wouldn't be as popular as it currently is without all the updates it's received.
---
FoG would be dead in a week unless it had rewards worth farming, then people would just figure out an efficient way to farm tokens rather than legitimately playing the game.
---
Pretty sure he does yes
---
Put a spoiler tag on it ffs
---
over half the plugins are broken
---
Honestly, probably not, congress is supposed to be in control of the money and executive orders are really not supposed to be used for that kind of stuff though increasingly they're being used for whatever the president wants and there doesnt seem to be much of a challenge from congress so hey maybe he could.
---
real
---
We don't have to change your mind, you can be wrong.
---
No
---
Ah yes. Tracking my XP per hour and loot drops so my stupid ass doesnt miss them is totally cheating.
---
Well if he's reading this then I hope he knows how to win my vote in 2020.
---
Having cheaper buyables doesn't matter if they remove rewards from the clan vs clan portal so you can't play non-combat SC to get rewards faster.
---
Does it really matter if someone is grinding out SC to get 50-70k~ xp/hr in smithing, crafting or con when if you actually trained the skills/made gp you could get more xp in the same time?
---
Exactly. I got spoiled and it ruined the moments
---
Vanilla client is a client for masochists change my mind.
---
try the plugin for harambes, or the plugin that counts ticks for verzikp3
---
Honestly same
---
But you need the balista part duplicates to make the light and heavy balista, so he isn‚Äôt finished
---
Agreed, but not as a skill. Different house items should be unlocked through crafting/smithing/fletching. Its great as a money sink and could still work that way, but doesnt need to be its own skill.
---
Yeah agreed, I'm not 100% on this but that's what all the info I can find says
---
There's no artifacting or any indication this was shopped. What are you basing your professional insight on?
---
It really tickles my pickle how runelite users bitch about ezscape updates yet runelite is the epitome of ezscape.
---
Noob question: Is OSRS world really a globe?

There isn't $7 of discretionary spending in the budget?

Maybe jagex just quit inviting him because they figured he'd turn it down yet again (pretty reasonable and understanding action tbh). Him blowing up at that is his issue and hes 100% in the wrong on that.

&gt;To fix this, the Tithe Farm has been shrunk to accommodate 40 plantable locations (10 patches with four spots each) and moved to the south-eastern corner of Hosidius House. 
---
I don't see how this is enough to even accommodate two people that use different types of "planting routes". osrs.wiki propose this route: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/8/89/Tithe_Farm_Strategy.png and 2 rows and 5 columns of patches will work fine for two people using the same planting route.
---
However, I prefer this route https://i.gyazo.com/79c2598cde58006e89cb9e0f28794b06.png which means it's impossible for me not to crash someone else that's using the osrs.wiki-route. I fully understand it was necessary to reduce the size of Tithe Farm, but now it's just crippling small.

That guy in the agility cloak runs like Naruto I bet.

Could u explain how this worked now that it was patched ?

Lmao wrong
---
Idk i'm just confused that runescape is the game they got addicted to I enjoy it but It is pretty low stimuli Ive fell asleep in the middle of playing multiple times
---
Is that a farm for ants?
---
I love how everyone that was logged out in the old area got teleported to the bar in the updated version. I still got my Bologano seeds outside the minigame tho :(
---
That's a well organized 99 party, what have you planned for when you max?
---
I was about to comment the same. Good on them fixing it, but it still sucks he can't get his status back even when they're now officially admitting it was a bug.

Nice... where were you born?

Also what's your mother's maiden name?

Soap Residue!

&gt;Additionally, the guard dogs have retired from their post at the cooking store. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì they‚Äôre going to a farm.  
---
Not gonna lie, they had me in the first half.
---
I'm glad to see the herb patch moved closer to the house teleport, and closer to the spirit tree. I always felt it was a weird teleport since a (redirect) home teletab will be closer.
---
One question: I can't see on the map where the fruit stalls are? Were they moved to the center of town? If so, are the guards aggressive when we try to steal from the stalls?
---
And people laughed at me for suggesting on reducing the size of the tithe farm. Bloody. Sit.

Yes, the engine team are currently working on a grouping system. The OSRS team are going to use this for better clans and grouping such as slayer.
---
The exp wasn't even good.
---
\&gt; Showing you the exact health of the boss
---
You get a numbered health bar, that's the only difference. There's nothing telling you where to walk or when to pot. I think Jad used to have an ez plugin but that's been gone for a while.

Yeah, I tried to cut all the white area from the picture but paint is wack, and I couldn't gyazo it while left clicking lol

Directly north of the house teleport / east of the spirit tree.

Hosidius looks fantastic! Thanks for the great work as per usual!

If you kill 3/4 of the jad healers will they respawn if they get jad to 100% and you bring him back down to 50% or will they only respawn if all 4 are killed?

Ok

You know there‚Äôs a seed vault right ;)
---
&gt;It really tickles my pickle how runelite users bitch about ezscape updates yet runelite is the epitome of ezscape.
---
I wish people hadn't memed "easyscape" into the ground.
---
Fishing spots never being interrupted or moved would be easyscape, trees never being depleted would be easyscape, your prayers auto flicking themselves would be easyscap.
---
Difficulty should come from something being hard to do, it shouldn't be hard because it's badly designed.  Eg the inferno compared to the bank withdrawal update that made banking more convenient. The inferno is legitimately difficult and is meant to be that way. Having to type 14 every time I bank is just poor design.
---
Too many people confuse easy with convenience.
---
Have you seen the female clothes laying around upstairs next to the bed? Looks like clues aren't the only thing he hunts.

No it doesn't you never deposit 28

But, daaaaad... mom said it‚Äôs my turn to break the game.
---
I thought Zulrah was considered one of the best ways for ironymemes to get pure essence?
---
I don't use runelite myself because I think its a dumb concept in general but I've seen in a lot of screenshots how stats are displayed with a timer on when to pot again. I'm also pretty sure there are colored tiles to show where to walk.
---
They have that in rs3 and it's amazing
---
Not new at all
---
Really beautiful work from west, super hard to please everyone in this community yet he seems to do it consistently. A tremendous revitalisation of what was a very awkward area.
---

This is so sad
---
Alexa, can you play memories of guthix?
---
It's called nightmare zone
---
They should make the chest in the underground gem mine a full bank, too. I never really liked the Con and Crafting capes, they feel really strong.
---
Oh, so max for the full time. That's lit
---
I've always went strength, attack, and defence in that order. 
---
Strength raises your max hit, so you can train attack and defence more effectively.
---
Attack increases your accuracy, which will also increase the effectiveness of your attacks, allowing you to train defence at max effectiveness.
---
Your defence is already high enough to be fine against anything.
---
Another method, you could get your strength to about 94 or 95(for higher max hit), then train controlled with a whip and defender till your strength gets to 99. By that point, you can just switch attack styles on the whip and train attack and defence separately and you'll probably be half way there already.
---
Has nobody used the auto inventory set buttons on rs3??? I feel like I'm the only one who has experianced this beauty of a feature by the responses here

Nah, well deserved death. That's what you get for being an Irontard, let alone HC

Read devblog before ranting please:
---
Below is an example of how the Divine potion's renewal effect will work:
---
Provided that your Strength level is 99, drinking a divine super combat potion will boost that level to 118. The renew effect will ensure that it won‚Äôt drop below 118 for 5 minutes. If, however, the stat is reduced by either an NPC, spell, or a potion such as a Saradomin brew, the effect won‚Äôt renew the stat back to 118, and will instead begin renewing the stat at the level it‚Äôs been lowered to.
---
There are two stalls without guard dogs [here](https://i.imgur.com/VxkWTfP.png) which you can steal from like you could before.
---
Its already locked behind 93 slayer. If they would nerf anything, it would be the droprate, which would make its price increase. Other things need nerfs more.
---
Way to out yourself as a new player.

bro i've gone to the ge saw you arguing with someone who thinks you're just seeking attention, gone to do a slayer task, herb and birdhouse run then come back to find you arguing with the next person who decided to give you their opinion. you're not skilling or anything because you're away from the bank in the sleep animation. the fact you've found yourself on reddit and instead of replying to nice comments you just argue with negative comments just shows your insecurities and how you think this is some sort of great achievement. like don't get me wrong, you're allowed to do whatever you want in this game. but if you're going to shove your insecurities in our face be prepared to face opposition. no one likes a show off even more when they are toxic about it.
---
Its a client not scam software to get your information.
---
Nooo haha
---
theres always a risk
---
Thanks I appreciate it!
---
They say "use 3rd party sites at your own risk" but realistically with RuneLite the risk is completely null. To our knowledge nobody has been hacked or banned due to using RuneLite.
---
Dude, 
---
I live alone, I'm the only one who accesses my computer, nobody I know plays runescape, I don't talk about runescape IRL so they wouldn't even know to hack me, and I don't normally invite people over. If I get hacked then that means somebody broke into my house, knew my runescape and computer password, and decided to steal my OSRS gold of all things. 
---
Security is lovely and I'm not saying it's not, but the odds of me getting hacked are really really really small and if I do get hacked then the circumstances that lead up to it would mean I have a dozen larger problems than my OSRS account.
---
Depends on where you downloaded it from
---
Bank pins aren‚Äôt even inconvenient. In 6 months when you‚Äôre hacked, please spare us the Reddit post that your bank was cleared.

And your solution for them being too strong is buffing other teleports?

If someone found out that I played this game, knew two passwords of mine, and breaks into my house, then I doubt one more password will keep them out. That person would be a freak of nature.

The seed is strong

Yea, doing dragonstone all the way is about 240m, while diamonds is, as you said, around 100m.
---
Although a combination of 65% dragonstone and 35% diamond is 200m.

Or the eternal glory you can sell it when you are done

That‚Äôs true! But if you deposit your excess seeds and just keep your most used in your bank, you‚Äôll save hella loads of space!

Kingdom has the best slayer dungeon in the game tho
---
So, when you train to 4 prayer, 13 prayer, or 31 prayer, each of these gives approximately 0.5, 1.5, and 3.75 combat levels respectively. We will use this to figure out how many strength levels you need to reach the same amount of combat levels. So, to get 0.5 combat levels, you need 2 strength levels. To get 1.5, you need 5 strength levels. and for 3.75, it's approx 11 strength levels. We can then use this to find out which strength level prayer becomes more effective than training strength for the same number of combat levels. Basically, we're looking for when the 5%, 10% or 15% bonus to strength gives you a higher bonus than if you were to train strength for the same number of combat levels.
---
So, at 40 strength, the 5% bonus from 4 prayer gives a bonus of 2 strength levels, as 5% of 40 is 2. 
---
At 50 strength, the 10% bonus from 13 prayer gives a bonus of 5 strength levels, as 10% of 50 is 5.
---
At 74 strength, the 15% bonus from 31 prayer gives a bonus of 11 strength levels. As 15% of 74 is 11.1

Using a slayer staff (e) on mage slayer tasks (that aren't burstable) is a decent use for mind runes IMO.
---
Eh a lot of people barely touch Zeah besides major content like wintertode and raids, because to be fair most of it is just empty space so Jagex could say they doubled the map size

Does anyone remember the bone saw video where he convinced a girl that you have to hatch the egg on runescape

I'm sorry if I offended you - I honestly had no idea what you were talking about as your post had a lot of emotion in and was written like a 6 year old throwing a tantrum.

Anywho.. looks like Mod West already cleared it up with you and you just forgot you were in Hosidius when you logged out. So no point in us continuing this conversation!

---
Current BH is a clusterfuck thanks to bots. I'm just saying the same system in something like the wilderness would be even harder to detect because the bots could be anywhere.
---
Potential systems do not work. Pkers who only pk will never get good drops, because you're cashing it out every time you get a kill. It encourages the same sort of skillers that myself and many others abused in the 2008-2010 days. I farmed tens of millions of gp and god knows how many pvp world skilling gloves by skilling while risking 26k back in the pvp world days of RS2. You only got good drops once your potential was high, guys who actually pk'ed were getting black d hide and magic shortbows from the potential system, I was getting statues worth 5m or 10m when me and my friend 76k'd eachother after a few hours of skilling. 
---
Balancing pking to be 500k/hr profit doesn't make sense, by its very nature pking is profiting off the losses of others. If I log in to a pvp world, or go to BH world, most guys are walking around in void or zerker pures. That is the problem with pvp. I don't think pvp, even back in 2005 or 2006 was ever actually profitable for most people, the real problem is the skyhigh skill barrier for (learning f keys, 1 ticking g maul combo specs, prayer switching, etc) discourages people from wanting to try it so everyone left is on near equal terms.
---
The difference between zulrah bots and other bots is that zulrah bots take a long time to actually level to the stats and quests to kill zulrah. The existing BH bots take maybe an hour or 2 since most are like 20-40 combat level. 
---
Anyway I think most people agree zulrah should be nerfed in pvm, content wise the snake makes an asinine amount of money for the fairly low requirements it has compared to other bosses. Stuff like vorkath is locked by grandmaster quests hundreds of quests, or gwd is locked behind high gear and stat requirements, or slayer bosses behind hundreds of hours of slayer. Zulrah doesn't require almost anything besides maybe 75 mage/range and a few mil in gear. That's a discussion for a different thread though.
---
Finally regarding tentacle whip, that's a problem with jagex and this community. For some insane reason, most new items worth more than a whip need to be massive item sinks. I personally don't understand why we need tent whip consuming a whip every few hours, but that's how it works. If pkers could get the whip and the tentacle, pvmers could abuse it with their friends to never degrade their tent whip and lose the whip. I'm sure if jagex bothered they could find a middle ground like dropping a percentage of whip's degradation as part of the drop, but as everyone is complaining about in this thread, jagex doesn't care.
---
I can im over 5000

It's more like a blank slate for future content.
---
Did you find that the increase of 5 cb levels impacted massively on your opponents, I mainly PK Revs/Deep wild in a team.
---
It's not easy for me since nmz is possibly the most boring thing in the game, hard to grind it for hours and hours without eyeing the nearest window to throw myself out of

5400+ (got 15 year cape on rs3)

I'm curious. When do you or would you like to use the helm?

Watch him as he goes

Fist of Guthix was released before the hitsplat and hp changed? It came out early 2008 ( look at my first post) this is pic is like 2009
---
I can only play on 4. Everyone who watchs your vids wonders it I bet xD
---
Where you gonna be pking mainly and are you gonn do other PVM/raids or just PK on the acc? 
---
It's highly preferential but for me I hate getting hit by mains at revs so I never got 75 att
---
It really spiced things up and makes slayer much more enjoyable if you‚Äôre into that thing. 
---
Ended up getting 75 prayer as well since 52-75 is only 2 combat levels if maxed 75 attack pure.

Wow thanks for the tip about using the spirit tree patch for dust devils. Now that they removed the bank right there, I was thinking the task was going to be worse, but using that spirit tree to get back is probably better than running out was before.

Please!!!
---
I can‚Äôt speak for the original dudes intention with his comment, but I can offer my experience of getting 80-99 crafting for free a few months ago via amethyst arrowtips.  
---
If I remember correctly, it was around 160k xp/h and I could afk for almost a minute at a time. Sometimes I‚Äôd only break even but other times I‚Äôd profit (I guess the market was volatile).  
---
I have no idea how viable it is today, but it worked pretty well for me!

If only there was a way to find this tweet with the information displayed in the image. The technology just isn't here yet

Yeah that's what it looks like.

Move it to ToB drop table and delete all that are currently in the game instead. /s

Or just cast a spell on someone on the opposite side even without runes you turn
---
It is ezscape.
---
You can AFK, paying completely no attention besides potting every 15minutes.
---
This is the guy from the "NPC Contact" spell.
---
Gummies? This isn‚Äôt a sick_nerd tune
---
Max hit might not change but the max DPS absolutely does. If you can stay potted to the max for the price of a single dose you will do more damage over the 5 minutes.
---
Jmods don‚Äôt read this thread

yeah p sure

There is really no point in polling any new mini game until  the others can be fixed. All current mini games are currently a complete ghost town  besides BA or PC which are still kind of dead. The issues with Mini games have not been addressed this mini game would last a month at the most and then be dead.
---
Have you tried turning it on/off
---
What a great angle
---
I would play SC even if the rewards are polled and significantly worse than the first iteration. It was just so fun, even as a noob account back in the day
---
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy
---
Up over 5k here...
---
I almost missed the poll results hidden in the dirt, you really matched the colors well on that one!
---
The 200 IQ move is to start your nechs task ~half an hour before reset so you can get 60 alchs, and not have to leave rune axes/med helms on the floor.
---
i like that idea
---
well you can do it the full focus way of putting on the bonus xp bosses and actively attack each one so you don't lose combat ticks. That's 150k instead of 70-80ish afk
---
Model Ashley
---
Yo imagine bein given the option the just start your account straight up or to wait 9 months for an ingame pregnancy period between two players and you get base 60 stats when your character is finally "born". Also the two players get to name your account.

WHAT how the fuck i didn't know about this

That shouldn't matter, in csgo you also buy a key but its still not allowed in some countries.

Yes but you get xp from gems and you don't from carrying a hammer. Woosh.

Wintertodt is a training method wouldn‚Äôt even call it a mini game. Your actually a client give up this crap mini game is never coming
---
You need to go to IE security settings and change it to lowest security
---
lol so you need validation from strangers on the internet cause you're insecure with yourself and you try feeding off peoples 'jelousy' 
---
id like to see what other lies you've been spouting now counting i've seen you in the ge told you not to waste xp as a joke and you started "insulting" me for not having maxed combat skills. you can keep saying statements about me and believing thier true but you've proved yourself the youre doing this to flex when you said you haven't, proven you're toxic af when you said you haven't, proved that you've lied about things when you said you haven't and you've proved you're an insecure no life that has nothing better to do in their free time then trying to impress strangers on the internet and get into arguments about how you're not a no life with nothing better to do with their life. Like i said be proud of your achievements have your insecurities but stop pushing them in other people face while believing everyone against you is salty and jealous because theres only one person who is.... you. you think everyone is against you because of jelousy but fail to realise no one likes you because you're not a good person and you stink of insecurities and your method(s) to quell them just amplifies it.but again you're basically going to reply to me with "no u" and think that makes you look smart and cool.

Heard they‚Äôre putting in a Whole Foods next to the pond and a row of player owned  condominiums on the beach..

Maybe that's the case for jagex also. But it's not the case for jagex in those countries where it is for csgo so there is clearly some differentiation.

Just stating the potential way that jagex can subvert the ruling.

you also think rs3 graphics are what makes the game terrible? thats far from the reason as to why im not playing.

id 100% be down if they would re-release the oshd client.

I think that has more to do with csgo being 1 of thr frontfunners in the lootbox discussion

I too was taken from the woodcutting guild.

Yeah there's definitely that factor. Maybe RS3 awaits that same fate! Just needs to be "found" by the media for it to blow up enough

'super weapons.' I don't think I've even seen someone ironically use a rune halberd in years.

His "uhhh" when he realizes what he just did is priceless
---
Hosidius looks so much more runescape like now. I still dislike all the other houses though. They look way too big and general
---
got to go through that whole learning the raid process, though. And for that you need other people to be on the same page you are.
---
Lmfao what are you clueless about PvP and ragging or something? Jagex actually doing something about people who do nothing but rag or pay people to rag you or that put a rag bot on you KILLS PvP? Quite the opposite LOL, ragging is part of what kills PvP. The only way to combat it is have someone anti rag for you, which is just furthering ragging. Clearly you‚Äôre either a multi bot or you don‚Äôt PvP and you‚Äôve never been tagged for days and weeks on end by some butthurt retard. 
---
It has nothing to do with ‚Äúgrowing a pair‚Äù or ‚Äústanding up for yourself‚Äù LMFAO. You know what happens if you kill the ragger? Nothing. They just come back over and over again no matter how many times you kill them, hell whatever butthurt loser or clan that‚Äôs ragging might get ANOTHER ragger on you too. So then you need 2 other people hitting raggers off just so you can attempt to PK. What a fucking moron you are lmfao.

Look into purchasing the services of a ticketing system like Remedy or ServiceNow? Hire employees to answer the phones and dedicate a select experienced few to focus on answering web tickets. I‚Äôm sure you could get high school age teenagers to do this for minimum wage pay on a part-time basis and working remotely as well and who‚Äôd be pretty dedicated for their love of the game. Put like a preferred playing time of 5 years + on the job description. They get a phone shipped to them or access to credentials to process web tickets.

I drop gems because the mining xp is more to me then the gem.

Yea some people would get more points then go in houses to die but occasionally people left and I got free win Haha.
---
Is land of the goblins still coming someday?
---
Arceuus House especially needs some love. It's an eyesore to the point where I actively avoid it whenever possible. The design has absolutely no cohesion with the rest of the game. The first time I saw Arceuus House, I had to check and make sure I was still playing OSRS. I get that it's supposed to a distant land and an alien culture, but it just looks ridiculous. Something about the garishly colored bookshelves and deep purple accents juxtaposed against the grey patterned tile floor makes me want to vomit.

Better buy those bonds in bunches for the extra days

Now you can run 8 runelites at once before your GPU is 100% xD

I lost 70 million from an account hack a few months ago. I would absolutely love to have it back again but support never helped me, would it be possible now?

I was about to tell you how I used to only play RS at the public library and how now every time I go back into that library I get flashback memories from playing. I see you've already beat me to that. Cheers!

BonziBuddy. Someone made it into a website called BonziWorld, but without the spyware.

I currently rock a i5 8700, 16gb of ram and a GTX 1060 6GB. Not insanely great by any means, but I'm pretty confident it'll handle RuneScape for the foreseeable future.

You're too fat, this is Jagex's way of telling you nicely to lose some weight.

That gpu feature is ridiculous. It seriously makes a world of difference.

i don't. denying a request without any further explanation is the opposite of good communication. leaving room for interpretation is (imo) not a good idea.

but hey, having different opinions is fine. that's what reddit is for.

No it's not and is subject to copyright hence the water lol it's not a water mark it's not even transparent it's just covering a name
---
No please. Osrs probably only gets like one shot at a new or revamped: safe, fun, minigame with pvp and good rewards that could actually be popular. FoG is so linear so it doesn't feel like a game. I remember back in the day people would just run mid and kill each other cause it was fastest way to farm games
---
If polayers like you were in charge the game would have become stagnate by now and died out. Nobody wants to play a game that NEVER updates even slightly. It's not like this area of the game even existed in the original 07 game. They kept the art style the same as every where else.
---
Only just started to play a pure and ran past him for the first time. At first i thought it was just someone role playing the dude from Runefest. üëå very good npc üëå

&gt;haha that was literally hotfixed within a couple hours of the update
---
Thank god.

I forgot :(

Try learning only phase 3 or 4 (based on the wiki) where Zulrah goes green-red-blue-green.  If Zulrah goes green or blue on the second, just tele out and try again
---
Graphical overhauls and geographical overhauls are a little different imo
---
It sucks unless you just do afk stuff :)
---
Looking at the front page, I don't think anyone is aware of this update
---
BRING BACK OG VARROCK FOUNTAIN AND GUARDS!
---
Yeah, makes it an entirely new game
---
So, tiles in RS have a few flags for pathability depending what objects are on them. In the case that you're moving on a diagonal both the tiles directly each side must be crossable. In this case the NE corner of the Oak tree and the diagonal fence opposite occupy both tiles and there is no valid path...
---
Clearly noone tried pathing around the area ingame ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  Oops
---
Still hear yanny but whatever
---
i used this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-g4CHWdCU

basically just camp one weapon style and reattempt until you get an easy rotation.
---
I have an account called ‚ÄúSparc Mad‚Äù that I still get emails about occasionally lmao
---
.... over almost 2 decades of playing this game and this suddenly clicked in my head.
---
Cos of nerf, less demand now, so prices have gone up cos less buyers
---
Oh it's being introduced as a training mage  method people don't like the word minigame üòÜ
---
It literally doesn't matter, because they can just require being 18 or older to buy keys, and since the vast majority of the playerbase is over 18, it won't affect their sales.
---
Players under 18 could also lie about their age, and as long as Jagex never actually heard their real age, they wouldn't be responsible for it.
---
What, did you think this would force Jagex to remove all mtx? They could also just increase the age required for using in-game chat to 18, from 13, and suddenly the game is targeted towards adults.
---
It is a very nice table.
---
Not only is this a repost, but you're also in-explicitly advertising a RWT site.

Outstanding move

The only thing about a society using lava to forge their products would quickly have an uninhabitable environment, which makes sense that they live above ground instead. I could see a really nice fortress built directly from rock being nearby though. Dwarves love their fortresses.

The OP probably uses OSbuddy
---
He's saying he doesn't want to see them on a normal ranging and mage pot.
---
All true, though I suppose the free mage XP was more of a cherry on top for those playing at the time. Normally there was the nagging worry of spending money on runes when doing PvM with magic. FoG didn't have that and was a nice way to be a mage more freely.
---
Far as I know, Protect From Magic prayer does not affect splash rate in PvP, simply a straight damage/duration reduction. Entanglement and limited bandages could only keep your opponent alive for so long.
---
I can't think of anything for the degradable skiller rewards.
---
Yea because everyone repots range at ever level right?????

That‚Äôs the best advice I‚Äôve ever seen

There is a certain amount of trade off. If you're doing bgs/bp method at vork then you need to both hit, and get a relatively high roll assuming you're not near max ranged to get the benefit of the debuff. If I hit lower than \~40 total I would tab out and respecc. With dwh you just need to hit and you get a flat debuff. That being said I think bgs is still better overall, and has a much lower price tag.

Hosidius Rework and Deadman Beta
---
23 May 2019
---
Ôøº
---
This week sees the release of the Hosidius rework.
---
Ôøº¬†
---
Hosidius Rework
---
The layout of Hosidius house on Kourend has been overhauled. Following a poll, Mod West has graphically reworked many of the buildings and moved sections around to more appropriate places. This careful design should reduce the feeling that Kourend is vast but empty when spending time there.¬†
---
ÔøºLeft:¬†the old Hosidius house layout.¬†Right:¬†the new layout. Click or tap the image for an enlarged version.
---
Tithe Farm
---
Previously, the Tithe Farm was the central location of Hosidius House and filled an entire map square unnecessarily. It also contained more patches than any player could use at once. To fix this, the Tithe Farm has been shrunk to accommodate¬†40 plantable locations¬†(10 patches with four spots each) and moved to the south-eastern corner of Hosidius House.¬†
---
Due to the Tithe farm minigame teleport being moved close to where the Glade teleport is currently, the Glade teleport on Xeric‚Äôs Talisman has been moved to be closer to the player farm, so as to not impact any farm runs.¬†
---
Another notable change is the lack of Logava Gricoller's Cooking Supplies store in the new Glade location. Logava's store has been moved into the main town market, while the building itself was moved to the north of the Vinery. Additionally, the guard dogs have retired from their post at the cooking store. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì they‚Äôre going to a farm.¬†
---
Hosidius Town
---
Moving the Tithe Farm freed up a lot of space. To make good use of this (free) real estate, a new town has been built.¬†
---
Most buildings seen in the image above are not new, but rather¬†relocated, and in some cases have had their layout changed. The only new buildings are the ones directly north of the Farmers Market and the rounded building east of the market, which are a¬†Corn Exchange¬†and a¬†Granary¬†respectively. The house of Lord Hosidius has been moved from its previous location east of the Vinery. The chapel has been replaced by a mysterious ruin. The main bank and the pub have also changed location, and a thriving farmers' market has popped up in the town square.¬†
---
Most houses and businesses have been moved into this area where the Tithe previously was, this includes: Little Shop of Horace (aka. The General Store), Various market stalls, Estate Agents, Farming Store, Food Store, Church, Bank, and The Golden Field Pub.¬†
---
Note that the southern church in Hosidius has been converted into a priest camp. Following this, the priest Charlie Brown decided to move away from the area.¬†
---
There are a few new additions around the outskirts of this town too. To the south is the new location of the farming patch and the Glade teleport, to the west is a ruined temple and to the north there now features a flax field and some cows.¬†
---
Western Hosidius
---
Western Hosidius is now far emptier due to the houses being moved into the town, giving more space for the Hosidius kitchen, as well as reshaping of the Mess to have a smaller footprint. Another notable change is Watson's house - he's had a bit of an upgrade.¬†
---
Ruined Temple Dungeon - aka ‚ÄòHosidius Dungeon‚Äô
---
Those of you who read the original blog may remember a unique dungeon that was pitched for Hosidius house. The design is still a work in progress and can be expected to be revisited at a later date.¬†
---
Forthos Ruin &amp; Saltpetre
---
The Forthos Ruin is a relic of old Kourend, a stronghold that was utilised during the war of the five houses. The old town is now occupied by a small company that operate the saltpetre distribution to all of Kourend.¬†
---
The saltpetre deposits have been moved closer together and a deposit box has been added in the centre of them. The clerk who accepts sulphurous fertiliser donations has also been moved here.¬†
---
The shortcut has been moved farther north and the shortcuts old location now houses a bridge. This improves the flow of the area and puts the spirit tree almost as close to the farming patch as the house portal.¬†
---
Kings Town
---
The entrance to Kourend castle has now been improved graphically and raised to give a more imposing feel.¬†
---
Now that the buildings that used to take up space here are being moved to the new Hosidius Town, there is more room to place parks and houses for the Council within the castle area. This will help create a buffer around Hosidius House and make Kourend look less like a kingdom sized city.¬†
---
Deadman Beta
---
ÔøºThe Deadman Permadeath stage beta goes live tomorrow (Friday 24th May). There'll be two playtests and participation is open to everybody! Help to test the Deadman content and enjoy some intense PvP action at the same time.¬†
---
As usual, the beta playtests will take place on a world that doesn‚Äôt use your saved game profile ‚Äì commonly called Unrestricted/Tournament Worlds. This means that you can visit that world and play without affecting your account‚Äôs stats, items or position in the other OSRS game worlds, and any progress you make on the Unrestricted World will be wiped when you log out. This means that logging in and out during the beta playtest will reset your state in the beta; players are advised not to log out if they wish to avoid being reset ‚Äì especially as you can't log in after the permadeath phase begins.¬†
---
The First PlaytestThe login period will be available at 10:45 (BST) or 09:45 (UTC)The Permadeath stage begins at 11:00 (BST) or 10:00 (UTC)We want as many players to participate as we can get, and it'll be an ordinary playthrough.¬†
---
The Second PlaytestThe login period is available at 14:45 (BST) or 13:45 (UTC)The Permadeath stage begins at 15:00 (BST) or 14:00 (UTC)We want as many players to participate as we can get, but we'll be killing off a number of you at the beginning of the 1v1 stage in order to test the matchmaking mechanics when faced with a change in player numbers.¬†
---
We'll confirm that the playtests are going ahead as planned by 09:45 (BST) or 08:45 (UTC) from the¬†@OldSchoolRSand¬†@OSRSPvP¬†Twitter accounts.¬†
---
Spring Finals Re-run and Summer Finals¬†
---
For anyone who missed our recent PvP blog, the Deadman Spring Finals re-run is happening on the¬†14th of June 2019. The Deadman Summer Finals will go ahead on the¬†22nd of June, concluding with the permadeath stage on the¬†29th of June. Full details of the re-run and the summer finals can be found¬†here.¬†

Deadman / PvP Change:¬†The lever for teleporting out of the KBD lair now respects teleblocks on PvP and Deadman worlds.Once Ilfeen has learned your resonance and will sing seeds into weaponry or armour at their lowest prices, a new right-click quick-buy shop option will appear on her.Additionally, Islwyn has been given a right-click trade option for purchasing crystal equipment.The stats for the un-imbued crystal halberd now change depending on how much the halberd has degraded. This is in line with how other crystal equipment behaves. Imbued crystal halberd stats still stay the same.Players are now able to leave the viewing area of the Rogues' Den by climbing down the ladder.Adamant dragons now play a sound effect when they launch their poison attack, as they do for their other attacks.The toggle to control when the Barrows chest sends runes to your rune pouch or arrows to your ammo slot now works correctly. You can speak to the Mage and Ranging tutors in Lumbridge to check your toggle settings.Shantay now recognises that players have inventory space to buy a pass from his shop if a space will be freed up by deducting the 5 coins.The Shayzien archer practicing on targets has been updated to point at where the scenery actually is.The main Herblore shops, such as Jatix's shop in Taverley, now stock water-filled vials as well as empty ones.Ali the Operator now has some dialogue at a certain point in The Feud, rather than failing to respond when clicked.The defend animation played while wielding chinchompas no longer interferes as much with walk animations.Leprechauns now have bank PIN protection.Players who reached zero hitpoints in the Fight Cave as they won, and who were then put outside, should no longer proceed to drop dead out there.The scrying pool views of certain towns have been adjusted to use more isolated maptiles to prevent interaction with the surroundings.Ôøº

Is that tile by the tree unwalkable?

Yes, it is impressive. Impressive isn't synonymous with healthy. Very few people could keep focused on *any* task for 12 hours straight.

Yes, because everyone who plays this game focuses 100% on ehp 100% of the time

U can host rsc on a potato and rsc was already given about 5hours of dev time/year. Hardly bleeding resources. And rsc took membership to play. 100 players dedicated to rsc is $1000/month lol. Private servers make nowhere near that, can have more players, and can still afford servers.

It should be done in sections, each house gets a rework, as each release publicized they can correct changes as needed, let us test it before publishing another section.

Probably cause a large chunk of the community is so hostile and jump throat. They read concerns, why the hell do they have to reply to every single person expressing something and a large chunk bitching? People fail to realize that JMods are people, some with husbands and wives, kids, who go on to live their life while doing their best to develop the game for the hundred thousand that play. 
---
They‚Äôre the same people as you and me, give them a fucking break considering how hard they work and how much they‚Äôve improved the game already. When you realistically look at the game, very little is broken. I‚Äôd rather the JMods involve themselves with new members of the community to show support for the game they‚Äôre building. If they respond to everyone who bitches, it‚Äôd be a 24/7 job. 
---
If you worked anywhere and you had people bitching at you all god damn day long for everything you do, I have no doubt you‚Äôd find it beyond frustrating and irrational. These people bend over backwards to actively improve the game and no matter what they do, people will trash it.

You‚Äôre doing your job at starbucks, working 10 hour days, helping people out. You see this young girl crying so you give her a cookie, you then have a herd of a thousands neckbeards trashing you for not doing your job.

In one of the houses there are two sides you can go up. In one side is a chest with a Picklock option, but when you do it you get a message saying "You have no reason to do that."

On the other side is a lesser demon. Around it is a prison cell with grain in it, broken glass, and a skeleton (both behind the wall between me and the demon). It seems that a ritual was performed that summoned the demon, as you can see blood and demonic markings on the ground.

your prayer bonus doesnt effect the barrows crypt unique prayer draining effect
---
Like 1400/2000 qualified accs log into dmm tourny based on highscores so by most you really mean significant at best.
---
No highlighting the exact square you have to dig for a clue scroll, basically solving challenge puzzles for you. Giving you the exact number of Laps and treks you where to click so you can click 50 steps back, having a prayer bar(I dint know why this is a thing, you can see your Prayer Points), instead of figuring it wifi should be part of the challenge, tells you what exactly to do in raids. Showing how long you have left to boost, exact enemy hp left, and what your stats are.I'm pretty sure there is a tick tracker so you'll never have a 5 minute pot deciding when to click it, but always a 6 minute one.
---
Just a few things that make it easier

Id give it a yes vote if I could trade the baby in for 200 death runes

i don't play OSRS but i know a couple of guys who live directly from the game... is normal, most of people here have weird sources of income.
---
You'll have to work very hard to sustain bond from get go, and imo that's not worth it, if you can it's really worth to just drop 11$ for first few times. Also some member stuff is better done at low levels; eg you can do waterfall quest at 1str and 1att and get 30+ levels in each, or you can do it at 50str and 50att and only gain 1lvl in each
---
Lmao you‚Äôre so right. What an absolute fucking cretin. What a buffoon, the fool. The absolute brainless imbecile. What were they thinking? /s
---
The settings shown here do not give you any xp advantage, just make runecrafting more bearable considering it's over 200 hours long for 99.
---
Magic heart is good because of the insane number of boost. Not the fact that it's a magic pot
---
Imbued heart Adda a few max hits even in some scenarios. Magic pot can add maybe 1 sometimes?
---
That is true. I think at the very least they should return untradables. Things like infernal capes and elite void are a bitch to get back, not to mention things like gold castle wars armour, TB items etc

Found a solution!!! Go to  [http://oldschool30.runescape.com/](http://oldschool30.runescape.com/)  and it should work.
---
My only guess is the https vs. http was making a difference
---
Your first point was right but your second literally contradicted it wtf LOL
---
Should‚Äôve made it harder to photoshop out tbh. Anyone with ms paint can get rid of it in seconds.
---
Even with the xp reward will you even be able to equip the scim after the quest?
---
I‚Äôm thinking of deironing.  My goal when starting 2 months ago was to get quest cape, and I didn‚Äôt want to be gifted the early game, or only do the fast training methods.  I felt I‚Äôd be missing out on a lot of the game.  I‚Äôm even doing no quest guides - even for quest items.
---
But now I‚Äôm thinking of deironing.  I‚Äôve got all the items I feel I should buy at shops.  I have dragon weapons and defender and rune crossbow as well as Ibans unlocked.  I have an okay bank on top of my items.  I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm about 1/3 of the way to the cape (finished most easy, and intermediate quests, done some experienced, but only a few of the masters).  My combats are all in the 60s, and my skills other than herblore, farming, runecrafting,  construction and hunter are all 50 and above.  
---
So why do I want to deiron? Herblore, smithing and crafting requirements.  Smithing requires so much material to train and afaik, the only fast method to train it is in the blast furnace - a mini game I don‚Äôt love.  Herblore it‚Äôs herbs (I don‚Äôt like farming).  Crafting, I‚Äôm going to be buying my levels anyways from charter ships, it might as well be bought from the GE.
---
Should I stick with my ironman?  I still have to grind a fair bit for requirements anyways.  And this is my ‚Äòmain.‚Äô  I‚Äôm likely quitting after questcape because I can‚Äôt imagine maxing.
---
MTX are the way to completely tank your player count

what if we want to go to the trees house? chill with him, crack open a cold one.

I always die because in the wilderness everyone uses runelite and then they already see me while I can't and before I see a White dot they already fire arrows at me

I mean, it's good that it got fixed, and it's sad that it took so long. Things can be two things. That's the whole point nuance.

I am very interested. Please PM the the name of the account so that I can verify the stats. In the mean time, I will get my payment in order.
---
careful now, too much salt is bad for your blood pressure. literally the only things that are a little op are the demonic gorillas feature which is still fine, and the clue scroll feature which essentially saves you the 20 seconds it takes to look up a guide on the wiki.

I have $3.
---
Thanks! It means a lot, truly. World building is a passion of mine and many parts of Zeah are missing a level of cohesion and character that I‚Äôve been wanting to fix for a long time now. 
---
Big reworks like this one are difficult to get out due to the push back from changing things and the massive amount of testing required. I‚Äôve plans for other houses too but it‚Äôs too early to share, but hopefully they‚Äôll be just as good :)

Thanks also go to Mod Maz for making sure all the content worked and Mod Bruno for testing it all! (And all the rest of the team for feedback and play testing)

I just ran through a few different high weight slayer tasks with both of your potential set ups (bludgeon and d boots/abby dagger+ddef and prims) and both of them had some scenarios where they were better, but then if you consider other tasks like demonics where you wouldn't use either the bludgeon or dagger, in which case you'll still be getting a boost from having the prims.
---
With 22m cash, you're not far off from being able to afford to have both the bludgeon *and* the prims. So what I would do, personally, is get the dagger and save up for a bit until you can sell it to get a bludgeon.

People skipped it, that was a significant contribution to why it didn't pass. They only failed by 1.7%, but yet have 1.1k-1.2k more skip votes than the supers questions. If those extra Skip votes had voted yes, they would have accounted for 2.4% of the 48702 voters (47502 + 1200 extra skip votes), and would have brought the total up to 75.3%
---
Of course, there are also Skip voters who would have instead voted no, which could have resulted in a fail regardless. This isn't caused only by people skipping. But the point is, "look it up or skip it" doesn't hold up, because looking it up also leads to more No votes due to more people knowing that they don't want to vote for it, and skipping the question just means that less Yes votes are being made.
---
Sounds sensible to me, I'll do just that. Thanks!

You replied to a thread about how it's op powercreep not about it being "a small buff"

Average for completing the barrows collection is 1400kc, you've got a ways to go bro.

Except it's photoshopped, ya dummy. Those same websites said Obama's birth certificate wasn't photoshopped, didn't they snowflake?

aint it someone called mitch, i think
---
&gt; if you legit have 100k-200k worth of XP in every skill that's not a combat skill, you haven't really touched much of the real grinding that exists in the game.
---
But I have touched most of the *content* in the game.
---
&gt; This game skews heavily towards the end, when grinding takes forever.
---
In time that you need to spend to progress it does - but in content that is unlocked it most certainly does not. How much more do I really have to unlock? Mostly just elite diaries and raids. What really is the difference between 75 fishing and 99, aside from dozens of hours of 3ticking and a few million more XP?
---
&gt; If you really think 2 weeks of gameplay is "mid game"
---
Maybe 2 weeks of optimal efficiency training with a main to feed you resources. I don't think that's any benchmark for your progression in the game though. And if it is, as a casual player, Hans is telling me I've spent 625 hours on my account so far over 1200 days.
---
I'm sure Jagex already has some way of accessing this data, they wouldn't need to put an in-game element for this. Their issue isn't that there are bots that have been around for years that they just don't know about, the issue is how quickly people are able to make bots.

I like where your head is at for vigilante justice though :)

You can still run RS3 in the web browser that uses Java (not JavaScript, those are completely different things).
---
I teleported to my herb patch in Hosidius and ran around for 10 minutes trying to look for the patch lmao.
---
The problem with that is that theyre designed to a specific niche and if a weapon like rapier takes that spot, the difference between tentacle and rapier rises insanely much, and it puts the price up by a lot and you get a weapon thats worth +600'ish m while devaluing other weapons that have specific niche uses

Dude I just spent a bunch of time walking around and exploring and it's easily just loaded with charm and exactly what I could ever hope for
---
It reminds me of my favourite oldschool areas like Taverly, or Legend's Guild; the quaintness and how condensed everything is just makes it feel SO much different. Zeah's massive tithe factory with the highways and no door houses left such a bad taste in my mouth, this update managed to like "wash it out" and make the place feel like something I'd want to keep coming back to

Why are you posting about RS3 in an OSRS subreddit?
---
Yeah, no autos here. Just looking for a more comfortable way to rest my arm when playing. I don‚Äôt really type too much in game, and I use the click wheel on my mouse for camera movements most of the time.  So just wanting to be able to move the F keys to a more natural arm placement.

Seems like you're the one deflecting now. That's sad.

So that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt trade spirit seeds

Start doing farming! If you do ranarrs (32 farming) and yanillian hops (16 farming) several times per day, you will almost definitely be able to sustain membership! Do Fairy Tale Part 1 for the magic secateurs to help get more yield from them! You can add me in game "ThisMuchDad".

Nice.

Fair enough! Yeah you should definitely be fine to do that!

Literally just dinh's + augury + rag hides and you actually have to go afk to die lol.

Ahh thanks man don't give up hope I already had in my mind that I would do 1k kills and hope for arcane, at least now after 1k I should actually have it. So pleased and never expected it tbh

Its quite a bit closer to the tp now.

I always had the thought that similar to trollheim that a fortress is built into the cliffs of the canyon-y volcano, with multiple stories/ layers.

It's disappointing by Jagex to only half remedy the situation. This isn't as small as someone losing expensive gear to a glitch.
---
This person lost hundreds of hours of time to an old glitch. Regardless of what the community thinks (even though they agree in this case), the right thing to do is revert his status.
---
Yeah, figured that one out after LOL. I started running the wrong direction and was lost for a bit.
---
its old i forgot to delete it lol :D
---
Lol I‚Äôve never used sand crabs ever so I wouldn‚Äôt know about this
---
Just get laptop
---
Sounds like you are doing it the right way
---
35 kills per hour is pretty good - what are you expecting?
---
I have a Pixel 2 XL and the battery life is pretty good (around 4-5 hours on a good day), lowering the FPS of the game, being on less populated worlds/areas makes the battery life last longer for me. You might need to upgrade your smartphone (with one with a larger battery and increased performance) and invest in a portable charger.  
---
Honestly long term an iPad Pro might be the best choice. I don't know if the multitasking is compatible with OSRS Mobile (someone feel free to clarify), but from what I've seen they have pretty good battery life, and you can watch YouTube on the side.
---
They're the worst cause even if the notification itself didn't block it there's an invisible unclickable area around it.

That‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt really need any items from GWD in tob.

Most people don't whine about their KC when they're still low KC and actually enjoy the grind
---
Thats assuming we kept all rewards the same from fog. I'd love to see new shit added that builds on the old rewards. Like a dragon berserker shield with a unique design (requires legends) which is an upgraded dragon square.
---

It was playful banter. Put the crabs away NEET's.
---
&gt; No Linux support
---
I only play from Linux, and the official client definitely exists and works on it. But as far as I know, Jagex makes no known public mention of the .jar client even existing, or the quirks about it.
---
I largely made the wiki page for the installation guide for it: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Linux_game_installation_guide
---
But on a totally different note, wtf is with the official client not having GPU support in 2019? Was teased by a jmod over a year ago on Twitter, and then nothing since. 30 FPS is absolute best case for me, and I usually average in the low 20s (Varrock rooftop is 15-18). The great library in Kourend takes me to single digits.
---
Will he go for tob or bitch out?
---
No worries haha :p I'm just joking around
---
Why would you lose it if it's your plus 1..?
---
I've been eagerly anticipating this rework since it was first previewed a couple months ago, but I wasn't sure if anyone else was going to give a shit when it was released. It's good to see that people are concerned about the aesthetic of the game world.
---
???? What accident tell us
---
I get more people watch because hardcore.. but idk i feel like rumecrafting and mining for months would probably hurt his viewership
---
If in the event that I am smited I know I lose the helm, its imbue, and its coloring, but if it is protected I am unsure. Hope that clears any confusion up. The wiki just throws me off and makes me uneasy.
---
You can also run it directly with Java: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Linux_game_installation_guide
---
If it‚Äôs protected it‚Äôs protected. If you would lose the slayer helm, you‚Äôd lose the head as well.
---
not actually his daughter, but actually a good streamer

Oi Wolf, whats the last boss of the inferno calles again?
---
So much room for activities!
---
it wasnt a major problem before the glitch got leaked tbh
---
Okay thank you, I didn't want to run in all willy-nilly and lose it because I didn't do due diligence.
---
Google.
---
What's really funny is I've done this and gotten a huge amount of runes and my buddy has smited an eternal glory. 
---
So believe it or not there's idiots who don't protect thier shit
---
Same, I was thinking "oh Frankie's in trouble."

I mean he took the time to make guides, he might not have perfect English but you can easily follow and complete quests because of him.

Oy vey, the goyim know! **Shut it down!**

just when it ended Cartoon network wasnt nearly shitty as it is now

I‚Äôve been at sand crabs for like 600 days so I was definitely here first so you need to hop

Yeah lol why would it be lost if protected? That makes no sense

just do some other slayer tasks and get more charges 4head.

i always forget about SU

The scenery is beautiful, now lets do something about the music...

This npc is based on a guy named Mitch. (would put his last name but I honestly can't spell it) This was his cosplay he won at a runefest contest I'm pretty sure. He is an admin to the osrs facebook group where I first saw this outfit

---
247 to go then
---
When you do Corp like that, how many kills / hr do you get on average?
---
I don't have super powers, I have Sara brews and Anglerfish. If I know I'm tanking 4 healers for some godforsaken reason, I'm going to make sure I'm at my maximum health. You know before you're attacked that 4 of them are hitting you based on the juxtaposition of the enemy to your character, no? Also, their attacks will be staggered, they wouldn't all be hitting you at the same tick unless you fucked up tremendously. The truth is, you probably have more than 5 seconds to react.
---
Regardless, my main point is that if you're 70+ defense with verac armor, the chances of all of them hitting you back to back for nearly their max hit is close to impossible. I have done probably hundreds of fire capes, across maxed mains and low level pures and I even specialize in mentoring people who are so shit at the fight caves they can't even get to Jad, yet I have never, ever seen those healers hit so accurately. The post just seems like one of those cop outs people use right before they cave and buy a fire cape, claiming "their internet is too bad" or something. I have friends who have used that excuse, yet miraculously outside the fight caves their ping is better than mine.
---
What annoys me most about that post is that the person he is replying to is talking about how practice makes perfect and calms the nerves, and his rebuttal to that seems to be 'I used to think that way before the healers randomly RNG'd me and there was no way to avoid it.' As if everyone doing the fire cape is at the mercy of the healers, and whether you get it or not. The truth is, the guy probably didn't have enough practice, panicked, and tunnel-visioned the healers for the entire last half of the Jad's HP and he was so focused on the Jad's HP bar and animations that before he realized it, the healers whittled his health to 0.
---
I'm going to Wisconsin next month, I'll try to steal a few of these bad boys for yall
---
So your logic is that "cheaters will cheat no matter what, JMods may as well make it easy for them."
---
Bgloves are def a mid-game thing not "veteran high tier"

With the game having already been made, I doubt there's a material amount of dev time that could get wasted.

Quests, especially if you're a member. And achievement diaries also if you're a member. But you might want to play free to play for a little while to get a feel for things and because a lot of low level training methods are not significantly better in pay to play than they are in free to play. Also if you link a Twitch Prime account to your RuneScape account you can get 30 free days of membership
---
Nah that's settled not swampletics
---
Access to fairy rings, waterfall quest, lost city and monkey madness, 75 mage/range ASAP. And work on slayer, it's pretty profitable when you get higher levels.
---
Zammy spears/hastas I think
---
I get the feeling you have less than stellar gear or stats for that person to bring it up but I don't see the need to call noobs out on playing how they want to...
---
Yeah you're not wrong, but that's why they have all the worlds, plus total level worlds.
---
The thing I think I wouldn't like about RS3 is the outdated tick system together with EoC. I don't mind the tick system on Old School but I feel like it would be super clunky with abilities. Is this true or should I give it a shot?
---
Just log in. The old stats will be on RS3 though. On OSRS it‚Äôll start as a fresh level 3
---
I always though of Dwarven architecture as a testement of inverse size ratio. They build up and out with grandiose proportions and haute attitude because they themselves are so small in stature.

I will say they had to move people around (teleport) due to the hosidius update so there is a chance that cause the movement.
---
so login to a f2p world to make sure its the correct acct lol
---
I would work towards doing Monkey Madness (lets you equip dscim, really good/cheapish wep in early game) and Lost City(lets you use dragon daggers, you want to buy the poison++ one, has a really good special attack) quests. Also maybe try the easy tier and medium tier of achievement diaries. You'll probably be able to breeze through most of the easy ones without too much trouble and they give you a lot of good rewards.

My biggest worry about this update laid to rest. Big thank you to the team!
---
3 hit u was actually brilliant and more or less created the concept of a pure. If I remember correctly, classic had a mechanic where you couldn't eat, run, or really anything until you had taken 3 hits.
---
3 hit u figured out how to exploit that mechanic at the suggestion of a friend of his (bettr than u) who was fiddling around with low defense builds. His friend suggested making a 1 defence account, which he did and named 3 hit u.
---
They discovered that this 1 defence account (which could wear rune, btw) could kill regular accounts within that three hit window of opportunity. Soon pure pking became widespread, with a few giants among men.
---
 One of them, I Wicked I developed a method of "catching." I'm RSC, after the three hit window had passed, a living character could flee and basically never be caught by the pure because all accounts moved at the exact same speed. I Wicked I developed a method to catch these fleeing players (I think it involved abusing diagonal movement?), and introduced the first real raising of the skill cap to pure pking.
---
They downvoted Jesus because of his dumbass edit
---
i logged out a day or 2 ago at crabclaw isle doing sand crabs and when i logged in today i was north Hosidius. is this due to the Hosidius rework?
---
just curious if it was moved for that or if i need to start changing all my security info. i already use authenticator and bank pin and nothing was taken.
---
I play on a laptop. Laptop life.
---
Your 200k gp would be just enough to get those unlocks. Barrows gloves require a lot of questing and unlocks a lot of content and areas that would be good for making money. 
---
After unlocking those items you can probably do lots of Slayer content which would give enough drops to increase your cash stack.
---
Weapon speed is only one of three factors when determining how viable a weapon is. If it had the speed of a long sword but the stats of rapier, yeah t would suck. But if they wanted to make a high tier, long sword speed weapon, they‚Äôd just give it better attack/strength/both.
---
As someone who has their final university exam next week, this hits me hard. I‚Äôve played 168 hours in the last 3 weeks, an average of 8 hours a day.

you sure that's possible as non-member? According to wiki, mining runite ore makes the most profit with only 458,000/h

You're using the wrong password, try hunter40

I actually made this while fixing my funds, after buying a bond to escape F2P I had like, 100k left, but I managed to hop on the Gout Tuber train quick enough to be over a mil. That setup is actually the reason I'm drinking wine in melee gear, I'm not attacking anything, just stumbling through the jungle with a machete, absolutely smashed and covered in snakes, spiders, and mosquitoes, Trying to find a plant that will make me rich.

Also you only get 5 minutes of boost. So a regular supercombat gives potentially 27.5 minutes of boost (with preserve) and decays the whole time, while divines give 5 minutes of full boost (7.5 if preserve works)
---
pretty sure there are actually mentions in dialogue where characters remember the "horn-less unicorns" and that they were hunted into extinction for their delicious meat (or something along those lines) this might be in rs3 but i remember that being a thing at one point in rs history
---
Awesome, I also enjoy the other basic skilling grinds like Woodcutting, Mining, and Fishing. As long as there's a spot close to a bank I can get some decent materials (in terms of gp), I don't mind sitting there all day and farming. It's sort of relaxing.
---
The way I did 20 plants can no longer be done in this smaller Tithe farm :(
---
Consisted of 10 plants all in a row, then doing 10 on the opposite side. Can't do that anymore...
---
It is more it takes them awhile to log back in not they they are getting mass banned.
---
Glassmake spell makes you a bit of gp i think and gives decent exp in mage and crafting but I'd recommend learning some decent moneymakers like zulrah and vorkath and spending money on faster crafting methods (or for when you're doing other buyables). Time is money too :P
---
As long as it lasts my lifetime, Im good.
---
For anything except bossing I go 8 minutes between repots, so this is actually less afk.
---
Are you a btwman? If not, air battlestaves are good
---
Slay and pray
---
I don't do much crafting but just in my head an 8m budget to go from 92-99 is going to be rather rough man. Im not sure if its even doable with the least expensive (and slowest) methods. 
---
I mean you can gather stuff yourself though like an ironman would then its free, but again time consuming. 
---
I would look up theoatrix's videos on YouTube, or other guides on it if his is outdated. They usually go over cheapest method, to the fastest

If you will sell lootboxes you will fall under same rules as online gambling. Yes, minor can access them, but in most cases it is parents responsibility to monitor their kids. Say Pornhub cannot be held responsible, if little Timmy accesses it and wanks off.
---
However, it can be enforced, for example here, all online gambling sites are blocked if they do not hold our license to practice it. With the way lootboxes are going, I predict most western countries will have passed or will have bills in progress to regulate them. Extent will depend from country to country.
---
How far they want to take their control, depends on the government. But parental control can be enough to an extent, as the little Timmy will harder time to get mom get him the lootboxes. If parents will get informed properly.

In the past, they had closed access to new players while keeping the servers online. Every few years they would let new players join. Last year they took the servers offline.

Yeah I use the second strategy you linked above and it works great. Never have any time pressure and it's fairly chill relative to the time pressure if you did it any other way.

As a whole, though, Tithe Farm is cancerous. I'd rather saw my hands off than do any more of it (already have auto-weed, seed box, and outfit... there's no way I'm ever getting the stupid can).

There's literally nothing balanced about the pk scene. You have a very limited range of account possibilities governed by the limited range of VIABLE equipment and  viable account builds. Today's meta is limited and unbalanced. You're retarded. Stop giving your input.

I think the full write up on that bill from one of the sites states a few games have been pulled out of Belgium due to these laws. If enough countries start enforcing it on games like RS3, they‚Äôll either be removed or the game will die

Yeah i feel you. I quit back and forth so i measure my progress based on items mostly. I have a mid to high level ironman so right now there is a limitless amount of items for me to get. I just set goals for whats the best to get for what content i want to do(raids upgrading inbetween raids is where im at now.) If i quit, i quit. And when i come back i can still go for the same shit. No point in comparing myself to anyone else.

If everything we do in game became profitable, the value of our gp just goes down. The economy will adjust and everything will just inflate x amount to account for the increase in profits brought into the game.
---
You have to keep the gloves and torches banked till the grind is over. The max you can have banked is 3. If you roll them again you get a torstol or magic seed drop.
---
They should at least discuss this. Why ar they trying to reinvent the wheel with lms???
---
I find Verac hurts more than Guthan does.
---
Who‚Äôs is short for who is... so they are correct
---
That‚Äôs when you use it at a +1
---
darn it I was foiled once again by a master debater
---
That'll be a no from me dawg
---
DH Lance is less of a drop and it was still included. And it is a drop, using the saradomins light on staff of the dead.
---
Yeah but at the same time the 3 hit window was rly about the same as both players dumping their g mail specs and teleing lol. Like at the time it was cool and all but man it would have gotten stale fast.
---
Combat lvl too high..?
---
Whoops I just sold them straight away but still should have a even chance to get any peice and RNG God's ain't on my side lol
---
If he is willing to sit at Bandos on 39 I'd imagine he could stomach sitting in sub-30 wild for a bit to farm some keys. As long as you are paying attention there its pretty hard to get pked.
---
I think he was just going for a 1 defence pure tbh
---
I really like the idea of a magic whirlpool
---
Absolute trog you are m8.
---
A belief and an assertion are two different things. 
---
Your reasoning isn't that everyone dies on their main isn't an axiom. 
---
You don't see the point in planning and prayer flicking? Those are the only two aspects of the game that any skill or thought goes into at all, outside of pvp. You not personally liking or enjoying a way of doing something isn't the same as not seeing the point. And if you truly don't see the point, that speaks to your intelligence...
---
Conquest was fun but I remember solving it in like a couple days
---
Its not crazy to think Jagex has offered him a job and he turned it down, its happened before
---
Why did you switch arguments 3 times?
---
The gate is members-only, so why don't we just teleport **past** the gate? Genious
---
&gt;Anyone can make a picture of a new menu
---
Although I agree with your point, I would like to point out that it takes some serious graphic design skills to create maps with the quality that GentleTractor does. Visually, they look straight out of the in-game world map.
---
You're very condescending and you offered no evidence to the contrary of OP's suggestion.
---
nah dude. jabex removed serp helm for defense pures and pretty much ruined every single one of those accounts without even polling their decision. they clearly don't want defense pures to be offensive. so instead they should allow them to be more defensive.
---
So, you mean us in illegal states?
---
I want to know too. Asking for a friend.
---
Ah for that I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôve never used a blowpipe for hydra. I assume it would be sorta random, since one of the poison splats is where you stand and the others are randomly near it, right? So if you‚Äôre moving while shooting bp you might end up running through it. Might have to just miss 1-2 hits to get into position
---
Watch sirpuggers video from a couple days ago where he addresses this exactly
---
Darn
---
8 is unload
---
Oh dang haha I never made a main on this game mode since I knew how I'd end up playing knowing what past me did when those options were on the table (GE, staking, etc.). Felt like ironman is more core to the game's intentions and indeed it's felt that way since the start.
---
And yeah sure I'll hit you up sometime soon! I don't like to post my RSN publicly (mostly future-proofing in case I post some interesting drop and someone is able to track my name to this comment). Feel free to PM me and I'll send you my RSN! Or if you have private messages set to All (I doubt it though) I can just PM you in-game.
---
Being a stat that only boosts dps after 80 is fine.
---
I like to do them for extra hespori seeds. I look at them as a little bonus for getting xp (or pet chances) anyways
---
Nope that's correct.
---
It's like that to deal with the notch of some phones.
---
Should it really grant thieving xp, then? It's just a free fruit display now.
---
No, he doesn't just draw pictures. He also does extremely comprehensive gameplay analyses: https://reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ap8cv2/the_drop_table_problem_analysing_gameplay_design/
---
literally none of the 4 comments in this post at the time im writing this understood the question
---
Wait for what.. some rando to gear up? Lol waste
---
bring your hc iron meme to wildy and I'll embarrass both of us
---
I'm NoT a BrAiNlEt FiGhT mE 1V1 RuSt!

&lt;wheeze&gt;
---
They don‚Äôt ban for buying unless your buying hundreds of mills. It  is a mtx just not sponsored by the developer, and yea probably not the safest thing to do.
---
is your volume up? l0l
---
PaYiNg YoUr BiLlS iS a ChOiCe

I think we've all been there. Not literally though because why would I go outside? But in all seriousness though, I've been on that grind trying to find something to make me rich too. I honestly don't do anything for cash right now, I actually just screw around mostly and afk stuff while watching TV shows or movies on my other monitor. I probably should be more interactive but I dunno. If you ever need some $$ though I don't mind helping out, my bank is only worth like 10.5mil lmao but still I am always willing to help people out since folks have helped me out since I started back.
---
Yeah. Which order is best. Im not asking if you are visual learners or not lol
---
Yeah definitely.
---
I actually don't have a main on OSRS because I knew that if I made one, I'd just end up doing what I did in the past (GE, trading, flipping, staking). Ironman mode seems more core to what the game's intentions are, and indeed it's felt that way since the start. Seems like mainscape these days just relies on PVMing for enough money to get gear and then buy a bunch of 99s, which is exactly what people did/do in RS2/RS3.
---
And great, yeah I would love to talk more! I don't like to post my RSN publicly (mostly future-proofing in case I later post some exciting drop and someone is able to track my name to this comment), but if you PM me we can exchange info. Or if you have your private messages setting in-game set to All (though I doubt it), I can just message you there.

Etsy ‚Äúcustom rolling tray‚Äù and it said any image on it, so I made an image with some in game friends
---
You don't know that maybe he is chilling in his bachelor pad on his time off
---
Etsy!
---
It is but I'm in California, I only ever heard people say it like "Oshkosh Bgosh Oh My Gosh!" as like a funny saying. I never knew it was an actual place until now.
---
Still a noob unfortunately
---
huh, I could see that. However, this phone doesn't have a notch? Maybe just an oversight on Jagex's part for the new series of phones
---
Brilliant show, you crazy son of a bitch.
---
Well, I'm in California and the closest one is at a Mall so no Air Shows there lmao. Especially in the town it's in - it's got one of the highest crime rates in all of Central Valley lmao.
---
Not working until after updates has kept me from getting myself banned. I know me and I would've sold those tbows.
---
I never realized that this wasn't just a really fat raccoon.
---
Are you talking about the store lmao?
---
TTG has gotten significantly better since the initial episodes. Total dramarama is the current hot garbage.
---
Bro..lol..first off, if you buy any amount of gold or an item you can be banned. The difference is its harder to detect real world trading if its a small amount. Secondly, real world trading is not a form of microtransactions..at all..mtx means that the game itself sells in game items/gold/etc. You can RWT in any game that has player to player trading, that is not the same as mtx/its not a form of mtx.
---
There was no gp doubler 14 year ago, only armor trimmer.
---
he merches bulk items. He buys limits in g.e, and re sells them for insane profits. I.E he buys blood runes, cannonballs, dart tips, feathers, etc. &amp; resells them to skillers/players. Having 10 accounts buying the limits helps him a lot with that as well.
---
Agreed.
---
After zuk get enraged, you need to follow the shield and not the marks anymore
---
It hits more often :/
---
Fuck offf I'm at 250+ kc not a god damn thing. But nice tho
---
Engineering at it's finest
---
He strikes during maintenance breaks and forced logouts
