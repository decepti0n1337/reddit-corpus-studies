I take 10 tbh. They cost like 100gp each and it removes the chance of ruining a run because you auto-retaliated against a dagg, specced a dagg or the ace chained the supports wrong

look into a ryzen 3 chip and maybe an rx570

Whatttt
---
I agree with you that black dhide is the problem. But the problem is cost not balance. Black dhide should absolutely cost more than it does for what it does, but it shouldn't protect from magic any less than it does unless it moves tiers. If you want more magic accuracy you either gotta trade down your +1 or spend more money because in terms of the level difference the dhide is doing its job.
---

---
With that said I'd love jagex to implement some sort of way that black dhide set becomes 150-200k to at least balance out its utility.

Is there any particular reason why half of your combat stats are lvl 49?

Congrats man SO DESERVED!!

Guitar hero lmao

What's this mean?
---
They definitely do. People are blown away that I got Rocky at lv40 and groot at 60. They always ask. Theyre always impressed. Have you ever played before?
---
So your logic is it’s ok to lock players out of zulrah who have always been able to do it because another boss was released which is targeted toward lower levels?

Imo the best way to nerf the bp with an idea I've seen before would be something along your lines; nerf the base accuracy &amp; str, and then double the bonuses you get from the darts. It's a more consistent and straight-forward way of doing it. Currently bp is OP even if you use bronze darts just because how high the base bonuses are relative to the darts themselves.
---
For instance, bp could be nerfed to +40 att/+20 str. For ddarts, that would add up to *(40 + 2x18 = 76 ranged attack, currently 78)* and *(20 + 2x20 = 60 ranged str, currently 60)*. So practically no difference for end-game pvming. But for addy darts this would result in *(40 + 2x11 = 62 ranged attack, cuurently 71)* and *(20 + 2x10 = 40 ranged str, currently 50)*. For rune, it's -5 ranged attack and -6 ranged strength.
---
Yes, roughly -10 in attack/str for addy darts is a bit of a nerf, but atleast it's not the immediate go-to weapon for almost everything you wanna do. And I want to stress that we now have lots of content balanced around the strength of the bp like the Inferno, which is why the highest dps option (ddarts) should remain about the same.

Next panel would be getting cleaned, and starting an Ironman then rinse and repeat.

I have an alt account with 76 range that I'm considering converting into a slayer alt to do wyverns. Since I won't be using melee I'm considering just doing wildy slayer with a Craw's Bow the entire way - would this be viable? Also, if I'm training range and I can't chin just yet, is it worthwhile to be relatively afk at elder chaos druids with a craw's bow, or is NMZ just always better exp?

This got me an idea; instead of guards killing you, you would be stunned and thrown into a corresponding city's jail - just like in the H.A.M. hideout.

My friend claims I got him Perma banned, because on a osrs Facebook group I posted his ign and said I like botting. Is it true

If he was using a combined max cape (like assembler max cape) it loses its teleport options.

    ME2 light puzzle is hard enough to fuck with bots being made
---
Doubt. Just because it's hard for people, doesn't mean it's hard for bots. It's a fight that they only need to do once, and no doubt they would do it, even if cracking it the first time would take some days, it would be solved pretty much forever. 
---
I think bot nukes in RS show that bot makers can recover faster than jagex keep throwing hurdles at them, and it becomes less effective as time goes on.

I’m on my last 2 sub-quests for recipe for disaster and need to complete Hero’s quest. Is there a cc or discord that I could find someone to help me complete it ?
---
I am in love with the major updates since release— especially Zeah, Great Kourend content fits with the other lore of the game and introduced many new items, bosses, and skilling content which ultimately revived the game from decline at one point :’)
---
Idk maybe it shouldn't be built into the game that your enemy has to just look at you because there's a fuckin log in the road
---
No

Come again?

Each point on the blue line represents the # of clues he got per opening 100 eclectic jars. The red line is a constant 4 because that's the drop rate, 1/25, meaning 4/100. The bottom numbers are just scaled by a factor or 10. Twenty would mean 2,000 impling jars opened, forty would be 4,000 etc.
---
Yeah sorry about that I probably should've explained more.
---
So the units on the bottom represent 100 jars opened, and the y axis is how many clues I got from those 100 jars. So in the first 100 impling jars opened, I got 2 medium clues. In the next 100 jars, I got 8 medium clues, etc. 
---
The red line is the average I should get per 100 jars. At a drop rate for medium clues of 1/25 per jar, I should expect 4 clues per 100 jars I open, hence the red line.
---
So this shows that the max amount of clues I opened in 100 jars was 10, while the least was 0 which happened 3 times.
---
Hope this helps! Thanks for checking it out!

Doing quests is always a good idea.  Getting farming runs and birdhouse runs is pretty good money once you get the hang of it.  When I started on mobile I did a lot of AFK type stuff like MLM and fishing/WC.  
---
You should set a goal and work towards that, like maybe RFD, all medium diaries, just depends.  Maybe you prefer combat so like 75 slayer or something.  Just kinda find something you think is enjoyable and work on it.  If you want a general best for you account type deal, probably farming for money while doing quests.

Season 8 Episode 8: Charlie Rules the World

Currently the Mage Training Arena rewards shop only allows you to buy runes individually. Could you change it so we can buy 10 at a time? I currently have thousands of points at MTA sitting around on my ironman, but it's just not worth the time spent to buy runes individually.
---
The OP of this post is getting recovered for his tbow. Hes not randomly getting locked out of his account.
---
This post needs all the upvotes.
---
I really tried to get into sire. I genuinely wanted to enjoy it. The unsired drop is a neat concept, the pet is cool, and I love having bosses as alternatives to slayer tasks. But good god is it a clunky, lengthy, boring boss to fight.
---
If they could streamline the phases, make the transitions faster and smoother, it would be so much more enjoyable. That is to say, it would be some degree of enjoyable. But as it is now, I'll probably never touch sire again.

The AHK controversy is mostly founded in people spreading disinformation. 
---
Using AHK will not get you banned- I have been using multiple AHK scripts since it became popular. Always 1:1, for simple things like withdrawing x amount from bank. I have since stopped since the QoL updates that have made it obsolete. 
---
If you stick with these types you'll be fine- it's the people who were using scripts so automated/complex that they were essentially botting. It is not likely you'll be using these, so you will be ok.

I can't tell if you're trolling or if you truly think this is ok

I disagree entirely, I think an item sink is much cleaner to implement and sort of solves both sides of the problem. It also wouldn't force so many arbitrary prices that could fluctuate in true value completely with the in/deflation of gold.

The barrage is really just being able to do it sorta quickly. Maybe filtering your spells so you can find the spell more quickly would help.
---
With the acid pool, maybe walking over a couple acid tiles to get to a spot with a large gap that you can walk back and forth on would help. I'd say click the tile before the one with the acid on it so you can't accidentally walk on it, and walk back and forth more quickly.

why did you think these questions were special enough for mods?

this shit is easier to make than people thing cus the runelite api has all the built in shit already made to make stuff like this with like 10 lines of code.
---
Okay, I'm seeing everyone on this bandwagon for what you wrote, and I'm not trying to be confrontational here, but why would the average player want this?
---
I'm an average player, and I can't see why the current situation is bad for me. I just unlocked the blow pipe and to just set it up I invested 7m in darts/scales/weapon. I get that I could make that back by doing high level content, but I haven't gotten to bossing yet, and higher monsters like Shamans and Abyssals are still out of reach. I don't have access to big money makers like higher leveled players do, so the tpb was a huge investment.
---
From what I gather, you want to raise the reqs, or nerf the item that is the best value/chance for me reaching end game without giving me alternative.
---
I'm sorry, but I truly don't understand why this would be a viable solution.

I dont really do wildly and for the wilderness hard diaries I needed to kill the chaos elemental. Decided to bring along an abyssal whip which I had just bought for the first time and wanted to try it out. Tried to kill the chaos elemental but couldn't in one trip and left it with pretty low hp. When I got back someone lower level than me tried to steal my kill so I attack him to get him to leave. Got my kill for the diary but was completely absent minded about being skulled and proceeded to lose my whip, dragon chainmail, and dragon boots to a PKer.

Well. You said this was an inferno plugin, which it's not.

Lots of quest fights are more punishing, but the DS2 boss is definitely the hardest!

maybe leave saeldor at 75 since it degrades

RuneLite is probably the most popular third party client at the moment. OS Buddy is probably second, and I think pkers like using Exilent (Tho I've never used it personally). RuneLite plus and LyzrdLite are also semi-popular, but both are basically RuneLite with custom made plugins. I wouldn't recommend the latter; RuneLite has a reputation/history of complying with Jagex's requests, so if the OSRS team decides a certain plugin is too OP or interferes with bot detection then they remove or modify it for the safety of their users. Both RL+ and LyzrdLite have plugins where Jagex has stated they didn't want plugins to be used, and there have even been cases of people being banned that absolutely abuse the plugins, so yeah. I suppose they'd be OK if you use them in moderation (plenty of streamers use LyzrdLite/RL+ and are fine) but if a plugin seems too OP then you might wanna steer clear.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for advantages... It just makes all sorts of things more apparent or improves the interface. For example, boosts. With just the vanilla client you need to tab over to your stats screen if you wanna see what your levels are at. Most third party clients have some sort of tracker that shows you your current boosted levels as well as a timer that shows when they're going to tick down next. Another example would be marking tiles. You can learn the exact spot to click in the vanilla client, or you can just mark the tile so that specific tile is more apparent (Really helpful in raids). There are also nice other QoL features, like text on ground items (You can even have it set to different colors depending on the value of the item on the ground), tracking your XP rates (rather than manually timing and doing maths), bank tags (Like bank tabs but you can have multiple tags on a single item, really helpful for storing different loadouts like for raids v.s. vorkath v.s. Zulrah v.s. farm runs etc.), and a plethora of other things.
---
Well that's dark

Y?

There are some decent skilling money makers but after 1m per hour it's mostly pvm. Raids, vorkath, hydra, zulrah

Is there a way to close out the bank with a keyboard command? Space bar works to go through dialog ect, just wondering if there is something that closes the bank

Never admit defeat. Mark my words you shall find a small friend following you soon.
---
1) There are spell filters.  I believe they're enabled by default for new accounts though I don't know the exact settings. 
---
2) there are four different spell books. You can only have one of them active at a time.  At the start of the game only the standard spellbook is available. Lunar spells require the completion of Lunar Diplomacy. Ancient Magicks require Desert Treasure.  Arceuus spell book requires 100% favour with House Arceuus
---
RuneLite has a history/reputation of complying with all of Jagex's requests if they think a certain plugin is too OP or if it messes with bot detection, so you're pretty safe with RuneLite.
---
Now as for RuneLite variants (RL+, LyzrdLite) or if you make custom plugins... You might wanna be careful. Generally if something seems just too OP you might wanna steer clear. Also avoid anything that adds plugins specifically for the Inferno; Jagex has stated they really don't want people using/making plugins specifically to help with that particular piece of content.
---
Its not worth learning unless you want the pet/mutagen or you are an ironman.
---
OP you have stats similar to mine. Add me in game if you want, Ultimate G3, I am UIM as well. :)
---
Skilling is fairly easy to get into and practically requires no effort and very little gear, but you're competing with bots or players with multiple alts in the same market. If you make 3-4 skilling accounts, you can somewhat approach some low-medium level pvm profit rates (at the cost of some of your sanity). A lot of the skilling resources are pumped into the economy by Jagex's famous droptables as a partial means to combat botting and reward consistent PvM players.
---
PvM by far has the most potential profit per hour, if you can perform consistently and possess various prerequisite stats and gear. You often need to complete various quests and diaries to unlock access to the boss and your gear (and you can go on some major dry streaks), but you are typically generously rewarded when you obtain the larger drops.

Make the wilderness so deep that at level 90-100 deep there’s a wall of demons(5 in sight all along level 90-100 wildy) that hit 50’s consistently through prayer and other strange creatures that Agro you. If you can make it through those there is a thriving chest with charged glories to thieve. Disable high alchemy spells past demons wilderness.(glory high alchs for 10k) and boom content... also add other 
---
Said demons would drop “demonic ashes” which can be buried give prayer xp(1k/bone) these demons would also be found scattered around north of the wall in solo spots(they still hurt like hell)
---
Perhaps disable prayers all together in this part of the wilderness “it is too dark for your gods to hear your prayers”
---
Make revenants deep wildy with the same drop rates as if you were skilled in the normal revenants area.
---
Closest spot to safety would be mage bank.
---
Take this less seriously than the rest:
---
 
---
Make the wilderness 200 levels deep and make it nearly. Impossible/impossible to get to level 200.(bigger wall of demons)
---
Add 9 secret tiles of grass with a bank booth that doubles as a grand exchange at level 200
---
Once every half an hour on one world an npc makes “God Ash” will appear at the wildy g.e. and hit any players in the area for a 99 every 5 ticks. God Ash has 1,000,000 hp and drops a full inventory of twisted bows if you manage to slay him. 
---
*Should you die by the hands of God ash it will be considered a hardcore Ironman death and your stats will be set to 0. *
---
(This is Jagex’s incentive to never add instakill darts to osrs)
---
Impressive.  Showing off his scammed loot by the looks of it
---
Cuz 1 requires skill and the other is just being in the know
---
Fairly unlikely but possible. At best if a JMod saw it then you unintentionally caused an investigation into his account... So if he was botting, you might have been what got him caught. There's also the very small possibility that the investigation turned up a false positive.
---
If he's saying you got him banned because you posted on facebook and that's that, then no. That's not how it works. If it was, then people would just do that to people they don't like to get them banned.

Obsidian is worth holding onto though for max strength gear, since it is only -2 total behind Bandos chest+legs.  People ask me why I'm still training in obsidian at such a high level, and it's because there are so many more, better upgrades to spend money on before going for bandos.

This happens when someone initiates a recovery appeal as well. If they get most of the info correct, it will boot you out of the game.

Not sure if there's anything you can do about this, just change your emails a few times so the next time the people try to recover it, they'll get your email details incorrect.

I think *finding* is a subjective word here.

Once he got a non Hydra task from Konar he would go to the slayer master Turael and skip that task and do the small task Turael gives then go back to Konar to try for Hydra again. It resets your slayer task streak so it's mainly just a method for either going for a specific task or grinding out slayer points by doing 9 Turael tasks and then going to Konar/Duradel for the 10th task point bonus

Get out of here with your PhD in Math bro, no need to flex

Every time I hear people say DS2 is hard I always think they are talking about Dark Souls tbh
---
You posted this at least once already that I've seen, in which post you were raging at everyone in the comments for not giving you the response you wanted.
---
What happened to that post?
---
A bunch of high level mobs drop noted iron including zalcano.
---
It's a recurring joke on this sub because that's the time when jagex said mobile would come out, only for it not to hold true.
---
It was also a "demo" in 2008-2011 when it had Corrupt Dragon weapons hhhhhhh
---
Zalcano should drop almost no shards based on how rewarding she is outside of shards, and the Slayer dungeon should drop twice as many shards as it does currently.
---
Dude I fucking bursted our laughing when I read this! When I read it, I read it in the same tone as Patrick as well!
---
Even wizards are better than climbing boots (g).

This is so good
---
thanks for the good laugh!

You posted this at least once already that I've seen, in which post you were raging at everyone in the comments for not giving you the response you wanted; saying you were done with the game, screw jagex, etc.

Content creators do not live glamorous lives. The top .1% shouldn’t be used as a reference. Let them waste 2 minutes of your time so they can get paid so they have money to spend 50hr on the next quality video.

The odds of getting 2 Bandos pieces in one go would be (1/127)\^2 so the odds of it not happening is 1 - (1/127)\^2. Thus the odds of this happening at least once in 145 KC would be
---
1 - (1 - (1/127)\^2)^145  = ~0.9%

If you want I could help you start out with it in game, DM me on here if you would like to.

He used BP, had to do a ton of zulrah as well to keep up the scales

As a free to play ultimate who has gotten (and had to drop) the Zammy rune scim kit twice I would love a way of getting a rune scim!

Depends on which rev you killed. They have a scaling drop rate based on combat level.

I also need it, we can work together

Oh Dovydas why do you do this to so many people.

You still register a mining tick to it quicker, even if there is the restriction in play, I agree it’s stupid but it’s still registering.

Upvoted because these are good unpopular opinions. I have when people get downvoted out of the converstion for actually doing what the thread asks.

good idea f2p ironman shouldnt have to get 90 something smithing for a level 40 weapon that's BiS forever

Twitch plays runescape stopped because the guy who created the twitch account wanted to keep the account for himself.

Bows and battlestaffs have incredibly high buy limits - only downside is that you lost the cost of nature runes. Gold-type jewelry often nets neutral gold.
---
Thoughts on my first time Jad set up? 
---
*75 Range, 72 Defence, 78HP, 60 Prayer
---
*Veracs helm, Veracs skirt, Toxic blowpipe (Addy darts), Holy blessing, Amulet of fury, Ava’s accumulator, God Dhide body, boots and vambraces, Archers ring.
---
*Inventory - 100 dragon dart switch for Jad, 3 ranging potions, 6 Sara brews, 6 prayer pots, 12 Super restores.
---
Well how can they do something if 80% of players wants to use runelite? We are the reason that clients exists
---
?
---
Will the elven robe bottoms ever be fixed? will we see more gold sink tied cosmetics anytime soon?
---
50/50
---
it’s a feature of runelite!
---
Rule of thumb: Jagex NEVER emails you first about anything that has to do with data entry.
---
Is there any chance of getting a ground items indicator on the official client?
---
nice
---
Differential equations or any advanced differentials and integrals? 
---
Doesnt really help alot having cheat sheets
---
Yes
---
if you didn't make it it's a repost
---
I quit RuneScape right before RS3 came out exactly because of this. Still haven't really gotten back into it since then, though I like to follow up on what happening.

In says 120+, which is anywhere between 120 and infinite

You can tell he’s in so much pain after the first hit and the second one makes it way way worse

The big con of this though is that anything put in f2p is heavily botted.

---
Wtf?
---
I feel like theres a lot of people that dont realize that max cape variants are litetally just fashionscape alternatives to BiS capes
---
For sure. But as far as quest bossing go it's not threatening to any account type bar hcim, which is a mode that can make a Draynor guard threatening 😂 if you die it's a small cost and set back. The checkpoints mean at most you're gonna get stuck on Galvek / Vorkath for a few deaths. Which sure will cost a few 100k, but after messing up their relatively simple mechanics once or twice you'll learn.
---
Compare it to something even as open to do as Zulrah, and they're simple.
---
Any tips for a first timer? I’m trying to get my 1 kill for Western Hards on my Ironman and I feel like Zulrah’s lunch order at this point.
---
Yeah I get why it's there. However even that is a pretty dull PvP experience.
---
I'm doing the wildy hard diaries. Between kills for scorpia and the crazy arch and the chaos fanatic, can I log off, or only world hop?
---
Using any form of AHK can result in a permanent offence being applied to your account, the severity of abuse often determines whether you will get a temporary ban first or not. There is no "1:1 is safe" - even remapping keys using AHK will run the risk, and I suggest the use of Mouse Keys or remapping keys using your hardware vendors software if you're wishing to do so.
---
use more brews if you are new to fight cave. About 10

Just get infinity, they’re quick af

ur welcome

Im missing the first step btw
---
Back when people had to "host" dreams there were accounts that had only completed the 'right' quests. This would allow you to only get the good melee bosses instead of all the other ones too. 
---
For example if I've only done 5 NMZ quests and you've done 20, then we can only get 5 quests in our dream (after forming a party), that we've both done - my 5 quests.
---
This was changed to allow for customised rumbles. It was pretty fun back in the day, I used to host so many people for free it pissed off these grubby little bot/multi owners all the time.
---
ur welcome koltove
---
We don’t need another CM because our current one is just the cutest
---
A rune dragon alt would be ideal but I don't really have the starting capital necessary to fund one - from what I can gather almost all rune dragon alts have DHL and either bandos/justiciar, and I would rather use my bank to get my main ready for raids. Something else I had considered was doing rune dragons with a budget setup (hasta, torso or proselyte) but I'm not sure if this is worth it.
---
Zulrah alt is something I considered for sure, but ultimately it something I want to do atm because I'd rather have something very afk
---
Noted re: the wildy slayer stuff, thanks. Also looked up some video guides and it seems like it's rather bad for purely leveling up slayer, so I won't be doing that either.
---
just brute forced Zulrah with Ahrims for diary. Have no idea what I did, will never do it again, but got void.
---
S
---
How do you know that wasn’t a gold farmer
---
Yes it does. You could put 100 jads or 1 jad there, it would still work. With too many jads you could have a range and mage attack on the same tick though.
---
[Source Code](https://github.com/runelite-extended/runelite/tree/master/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/inferno)
---
Very attainable for who though? What percentage of the player base has 1.5b in Zulrah supplies?
---
Dont forget about dragonfire ward. 30 mil. rigour 54 mil. so as soon as you get 200 mil on your fresh acc you're good ;)
---
Bro I legit had the same thing happen to me. Someone sent in an email at 10am yesterday to recover the password which made me change my password at 12pm. I then came home later and tried logging in only to find that I was locked out of the account and was tweaking out. I ended up transferring 1.7b to my friend to hold onto until this shit gets sorted out. My friends were saying that a lot of others had been experiencing similar issues. 
---
What I’ve done since is make a new email only for osrs, put 2fa on my rs account and email, and change all my passwords to brand new ones. Not sure what else I can do now except 🦀🦀🦀no authenticator delay🦀🦀🦀
---
People downvote this, because everyone is using runelite and it's become accepted, but people have to be delusional not to recognize how ridiculous even the official runelite base client is. Swap menu entries, farming timers, boss timers, stat changes, clue overlays and info. It's fucking crazy what runelite does.
---
Does void count as untradeables?
---
How long has this been happening
---
&gt; on pures
---
Yes, they literally built their account around being able to deal high damage while having no way to tank damage.
---
No shit it can accurately hit over max hp on pures
---
That's objectively wrong.
---
One of your complaints was that it was cheap too, so I assumed you meant fire strike. I don't find 6 gp/xp cheap for a skill that can be done for half the cost and up to 4-5x faster when not afked.
---
watch the video. i put timestamps in for a reason. he pk's the bot once, and sees the bot doing the same thing. it's a bot. clearly. watch video before commenting.
---
I like the boss tho
---
Why would you autoclick in Nightmare Zone? That shit is already easy enough... I hope you don't get unbanned. As for the bots, a lot of the time accounts like that are people playing legit but gold farming, as a JMod stated in a post directed towards Zulrah bots - he said most aren't bots they're just legit people gold farming to sell for irl money, still against the rules, but that's how they go unnoticed for so long.
---
almost a month
---
Adding in a rune scim drop is just eliminating one of the two end-game pieces of equipment available to f2p ironmen (the other being the rune war hammer). Why is there such a push to do this? F2p ironmen knew when they signed up that a scim was an insane achievement, and any other account type can just buy one for 20k. Leave scim drops alone please.
---
Imagine playing for years without making a single mistake and then being called careless when you do make one mistake.
---
Yeah I mean most upper level science/math classes allow a formula sheet. You can't cheat the problems too well. Dude probably never took a class and just knows a friend/etc.
---
Got my quest cape back, so now going for base 70... except my last ones are thieving and 55 rc.
---
Don't fancy making 60000 odd law runes so I'll get base 70 in like 2 years 🙌🏼
---
I mean sure but that's just another f2p boss and not just a fire giant spawn.

There is one big thing your missing out of all of this. You are not the person who has the say on this jamflex is. Sorry 
---
Jiggleflex has decided that it’s not healthy for their game.
---
Yeah most clients are iron men and pkers. Some max mains wanting it for master clues and others just cbfd spending 4plus hours learning the mini game and doing it in 306. If you can make decent money it’s worth the time saved.
---
If you can do the mini game semi efficiently then I’d just do it in 306.
---
I buy about 6 daily sometimes, I run 42 p2p accounts, but I don't think I'm the culprit, am I?
---
Really sorry for your loss of a close friend. I know that can’t be easy especially since he was your gaming bud as well. Life is so fragile man.. you never know when it all could end. Go hard for your friend and may he bless you with heavenly RNG 😎
---
I genuinely lol'd at this, perfect execution.
---
It honestly looks so sick. I love the color.
---
I don’t need friends, I need Xp.
---
So what values does the right vertical axis display?
---
Hey if you can create footage of your issue and send a bug report at the same time that would be helpful means others can see the issue as it’s occurring
---
The problem isn't setting it up, honestly, if people can set it up by eye and knowledge I'd give it to them. The problem is people with cheat clients getting the tile shown to them
---
I transferred the cash from my old account which I had on a sticky note 😂 Spent 5 mil on dragon bones and used the house party world for gilded altar after reading a guide. Did waterfall. Tree gnome I am looking to do. Where do I do tourist trap?
---
Didnt think about it, but now I want this
---
Remember to always keep an ecumenical key in your bank for situations like this. You can make it back with Trollheim teleport. Just bring a stamina potion (or some energy potions if you don't have staminas) to keep running through the ice section.
---
It's not wasted money. You'll get 20 attack eventually :)
---
Honestly, if someone set this up by eye in the wilderness I'd give it to them, but the problem comes in when people have cheat clients and get the tile show to them
---
Sure will reply soon
---
I don't think the drop rate on the wiki is wrong, people are just generally bad at interpreting it, it says 1 in 250k per pickpocket, so 1 in 25k accounts will get rocky at level 1, 1 in 12.5k by level 2, 1 in 8k by level 3. How many accounts have started thieving since the release of pets? Hundreds of thousands, therefore there is going to 10+ accounts like this even with the drop rate on the wiki.
---
Funny they did this in RS3.
---
I bring fury and archers ring to help speed up kills. Always do dag kings on slayer
---
Thats the white one
---
Delete all trees?
---
But you’re telling me what their gender is?
---
If your budget is to spend on mage pking gear and not your full account budget and you mean for 1v1s in edge then I'd say.
---
Neit/barrows helm, ahrims top and bottom, tome of fire and maybe toxic staff of the dead with fire surge then occult necklace, probably some tanky boots for extra def bonus and MA2 cape. You will be really squishy though. Seers ring I and a blessing in the ammo slot.
---
DBM/Bigwigs don't tell you where to run and what abilities to use, they just give you notifications when something is about to happen
---
Actually, something like that jad video was released where an add on actually drew on the game world and marked where you were meant to move, that lasted about 3 weeks before it was banned
---
It's different. Even with DBM people still fail raids, but there is no way someone can fail Jad when told what prayer to press when
---
But is it?
---
Lets say corp loot per kill is 256k gp (ref: https://twitter.com/prncssosrs/status/955153429646671873?lang=en)
---
Corp has 2000hp (+ regen). Each bot can recoil from 5-25hp per trip roughly. Lets say 20hp per run. 100 runs = 1 kill. 
---
Each run would net a value of 2556gp, minus the food and recoils.
---
At 60 trips per hour that'd be 150k gp, which is pretty solid, but realistically the bots wont recoil 20hp per trip and profit will likely be sub-60k per bot. 
---
... ok yea that's pretty plausible. Also possible that they have a maxed main sitting there and grabbing the kills and possibly getting boosted for a corp pet.
---
Any update on the suggestion of using a knife on dragonhides to extract scales? Obtaining scales for low level money making/ironmen is good awful. I know Mod Ash liked the idea before.
---
That's not what I said lol...  
---
I was clearly pointing out your 'disclaimer'
---
Bring a ring of visibility and the spade effect is countered
---
SirPugger killing bots is the best content.
---
Nah nah. Get a couple knife hits and when they like 70% hp go for a normally ballista or crossbow and then either 1 or multiple thrownaxe spec/s
---
So d knife as main hand
---
Bally as ko wep
---
And thrown axe as spec. 
---
Honestly just go back and watch some of torvestas combos. He has done a load of them and you can slow the vid down to watch his clicks for the combos
---
I'd like to add Cerb into this comment as well, terrible drops unless you get a crystal.
---
Yh because you can do vorkath on a fresh account... By the time you get to vorkath you should have the money
---
11-20 is less than an hour. Looking for a grind? Get into runecrafting.
---
There are different grades of mistake though. 
---
There are plenty of mistakes you can make as a hcim that won't kill you. But doing a grandmaster quest without an emergency tele seems like a pretty major one.
---
Good good good goooood
---
But you can't even afford Dharok if you don't have your first mil.
---
Not going to lie I dont even know where to start with slayer. I have done a tiny amount but the task was vampyres and was hard to just do 16 so I'm assuming I was just doing smth wrong
---
Spent the entire weekend killing it (100 kills per day, 234 task size) and everything in this post is accurate. Got my bludgeon and never going back to the boss, ever.

RuneLite is a free third-party osrs client that gives you a ton of add-ons such as a total bank value calulator/overlay, player high scores lookup; it can make osrs run off of your GOU instead of your CPU, make it so you can see twice as far, and so much more. 
---
I’m not a shill for them I just love them. At least 75% of the community uses RuneLite
---
my condolences, should have waited for the 70 cmb boat to do it
---
Congrats my dude! Any chance you could show us your setup? (gear/inv)
---
Either you are botting or they think you’re botting. It don’t have definite proof. Either way stop or you’ll be banned soon

1 word: Runelite
---
wtf I love man supremacy now
---
Darn statists
---
Zulrah isn't easy: He's predictable. If you get sub 2 minute kills you know exactly what to do after he pops out of the water the second/third time. There are only four possible variations he can give.
---
Once you can do your equipment switches, know where to stand, eat up while running, switch prayers (the only hard part), Zulrah becomes easy. But learning is hard because you need to do every single thing, at the same time, and not miss a single click.
---
To get either chestplate or tassets from Graardor himself is about 0.5249%
---
To get the other piece from a minion is 1/16129, so \~0.0185988% from any of the 3 minions
---
Chance of both of these to happen in a row (on the same kc) is about 0.0097631%
---
And for this to happen during 145 kill count, the chance is roughly 1.4%, so on average, 1 out of every 71 players experiences similar luck during their first 145 kc. Surprisingly high odds actually.
---
Higher prayer level, use god ranging armor
---
Cheating or qol? This game is old as fuck the official client is a ducking forest fire,  IMO far from cheating
---
Full green graceful, farming cape and seceturs master race.

If I never gambled IRL and still have enough money to be happy, I dont need to gamble in OSRS. Stay away from stakes boyssssssssssss :D

How is that crazy

I agree with you 200% but when you say shit like this I have to give you that tasty blue arrow.
---
Fuck time to go back to the caves and try for my cape again
---
It was implemented early into the games life cycle try using /m now is wow. Osrs has been going for 6 years runescape many years before that, it has been part of the game that you follow the games, cosmetic differences matter and change how challenging the game is. The more you practice and learn to spot them you will enjoy the experience, are you have more success than failures over time. 
---
You do you. I don’t think there is any talking you around on this. Gl with whatever you do
---
The lunar spell is almost invalidated by it. At least Runelite can't tell you if the patch is diseased/dead when outside of viewing range.
---
From a goblin it’s like 1/100k
---
Yeah, it's worth it. There's a city in game names Varrock. If you go to the west side of town there is a bank. If you go north past the bank you'll find the Grand Exchange, it's a market stand that let's you buy from other players like Amazon. You can use it to sell items and look up prices for things you want.

&gt;I do hold a stance on your comment being dumb as hell. Congrats.
---
Well what is your stance?
---
Have you guys considered an upgrade to the Void Knight Mace rather than or in addition to the SotD Guthix upgrade? The new reward stands to put Claws of Guthix on slightly more even footing with the other god spells, but still leaves the unique Void Knight mace as being effectively useless aside from its prayer bonus.
---
If this is a real post OP pm me and I will give you 1m to help you along your journeys
---
For me it's opposite. When life is good and everything comfortable, I enjoy playing. When it's bad, I have zero motivation to play. Gf left me last week and I'm struggling with my thesis, haven't played since then. Too bad I spent the extra time not being productive but just worrying.
---
You're looking at it the wrong way.
---
Back to the wildy altar example; if you die 50% of the time losing your entire invent, it's still as good as using bones on a gilded altar. That's *insane*. You are extremely unlikely to die more than 50% of the time, resulting in great xp/h with low gp/xp. 
---
A lot of people understand that and use the altars, this attracts bottom feeding pkers. These low risk pkers kill prayer trainers for their bones, it's fairly profitable and is an easy fun way to learn how to pk.
---
These bottom feeding pkers attract bigger fish, pkers with higher risk, who then attract other pkers.
---
I recently used 1500 bones on my ironman at the altar, lost maybe 20, while I was grinding I saw a loooad of pvp fights happen, most were between pkers, it was great entertainment for my grind, these updates are definitely good for the pvp community.
---
The pvmers that hate pvp updates just need to look at the pros and cons of the content, a lot of the time wildy content is great even with the risk of dying.
---
Called it years ago
---
I told you so
---
I mean he's good but could he break a million?

Any idea why that's the case? Are you supposed to match what their resting heart rate should be beating at?

Shout out only trails CC!

This reply right here officer
---
Yeah, that's what he said
---
I'm afraid I'm not far enough into my degree to tell you that! All I know is that it's primarily obtained through data analysis - CPR performed at 110 BPM tends to produce the best outcomes for patients.
---
If you’re looking at endgame content then questing is the best place to start, you’ll get xp rewards and have to train some levels along the way. Quest cape is sexier than most 99capes also.

Hey everyone - found the dick I was talking about. Guess what, I didn't even read your comment except for the first sentence and last. This kind of garbage doesn't warrant a reply - but lucky for you I already made a comment about this earlier. Go find it.

I loved your video about the rune fest reveal. Brilliant.
---
Yes.
---
Darts I always thought knives where best. Also where are swamp crabs?
---
herblore?
---
Or we could allow for an option to get a rune scimitar as a drop from something that woupd be lvl 100 and require decent stats to kill not to mention the biggest quest for f2p to access.
---
and I highly doubt in those days you had cheat plugins.
---
Most people consider the mmo from their childhood as the best regardless of what it was. (also lotro was better than wow eat poopoo loser)
---
I think at his prayer level with the number of pots he would be taking its probably not as good as simply having an extra pot although I cant be bothered to do the maths.
---
It is if you want to cancel a task. But yeah you're right.
---
No I think they do, but it's hard to draw a line under what is and isn't fair. I love Runelite I think it makes the game so much more manageable without taking away from the game for me, but I get why people feel this way about cheat clients.
---
As I say tricky subject, you allow a Barbarian Assault callout timer and menu changer and then you've got people making scripts to show you how to do zulrah.
---
It's definitely hard to decide where the bar goes because it's probably ever moving, and the only sure fire way to sort it would be to disallow all non official clients and I personally don't want that.
---
Some people assume the worst, there’s a lot of beggars.  Just ignore them

The offer is from an NPC

Is that a question or a statement?

---
Because RS is a grinding based game. The entire "fun" of the game comes from the light at the end of the tunnel.

When you start speeding everything up or making it "easier" there comes a point where the "grind" means nothing anymore. Maybe it's out of most peoples memories now but there was a point in OS where being maxed melee meant quite literally nothing because it required no time or effort.
---
The main thing I use Runelite for is the GPU plugin which allows anti-alliasing and the fog instead of the standard black void. Oh and the skyboxes are a nice touch too
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
Could someone quickly explain the idea of food combos and their benefits.... Someone in a zulrah post earlier recommended sharks/karambwan.... And I've seen pkers do the brew / food combo.... But I'm clueless.
---
Huh very interesting. As convenient as that may be I see how that becomes an issue. Thanks for the reply!
---
Well its former swamp gear so yea its worth it
---
Oh god you’re so pure, I love it
---
He’s probably f2p
---
I own my Bitcoin. You dont even own your account , jagex can take it at any time - hence why you came here crying
---
Tbow isn’t bis at zulrah.
---
“Grind 9 lvls” as if 11-20 was anything to bat an eye at. Have fun!
---
Just get every set then
---
Good to know never dipped my toe in slayer or herbalore before so both are very new to me. Especially the items involved 😂
---
Delete your post don't taint him to the world of begging
---
So you want old school old school runescape?
---
you know something is fked up when 90% of the community is okay with the game being infested with cheats...
---
Doesn’t matter when your whole character is done on mobile.
---
Imagine posting this top quality Kek for less than 1000 viewers
---
A man of culture I see
---
I agree.
---
blowpipe shouldnt have been added in the first place, its literally more dps then turmoil, overload and a fucking rapier.....
---
So in other words, another bot nuke?
---
I play on PC mostly and still don’t have a fire cape... I would never even attempt on mobile. So gz from me!
---
It’s not ground loot overlay but I found the chat option for loot extremely helpful! If you go to the in-game settings, click the little green guy with a speech bubble at the top, the click the lightbulb, you’ll have an option to set/change your loot drop notifications. This way you’ll have at least a chat notification of drops worth picking up, you can set it to 1gp which would give you a chat notification for basically every lootable item
---
are you colorblind?
---
Should i  remove some food &amp; add a spec weapon (for eg, gmaul &amp; ammy of strength)?
---
You using the right slayer master? Because 1 task in 3m exp sounds like bullshit
---
where are the bots? lumby?
---
You playing an ironman?
---
Come on now
---
I like shadow spell disorientation, I just wish that lower tier versions were more usable. Maybe make shadow barrage a 1 min disorientate, blitz 45s, burst 30s. That way the respirators become less of a ballache as you improve your skills.
---
As for energy on the respirators, you shouldn't really be running out if you're using house pool or clan wars to reset between kills. If you're not using them then you're not using the best methods available and shouldn't be rewarded as though you were.
---
As for phase transitions, they're pretty fucking annoying and I wish they could be reduced a bit.
---
Brand new player!  So cool.
---
FYI: I'm asking this because I've recently noticed alot of people including myself receive this "legit" password reset e-mail. Out of curiousity I went on the website to change my password and the first thing I noticed when I logged in that there was no authentication after I signed in. I then went to my authenticator option on my account and checked if it was disabled but it wasn't.
---
Out of curiosity, why those bosses? Get yourself a couple verac sets and camp Calisto with your accs
---
no
---
if you are paying enough attention to really actively focus on veins chances are you should be doing another mining method. just mine open veins, try not to half kill a spot- if you have one spot left for ore for example just go dump it, cuz if you mine it that spot will only net one ore by the time you get back.
---
&gt;farming timers
---
...The thing you can simulate with a literal fucking timer?  Is using a clock cheating now?
---
Bitconnnnnectttt.
---
are you fucking kidding me with this shit?
---
I am too! What key?!
---
yikes
---
Once I’m done farming xp, kalphites
---
That's how it's designed. It's the exact same as GWD and a large amount of the older bossing content.
---
The price of osrs gold is pretty low right now so which directly affects bonds. Also school is starting back so people will be playing more
---
HEY OP ARE YOU STILL ON? i sent you a pm! hit me up when you get a chance :)
---
With the wildy slayer update no longer going to be receiving emblems, can you please not just improve larrans keys..... If larrans drop rates are improved and the only worthwhile loot for doing wildy slayer... Then the chests will just be camped. Currently the keys are shit enough that people don't camp the chests and it's perfect. But you're turning a guanteed 60k loot with normal wildy risk.... Into no almost guaranteed 60k with the same risk as before, but then a vastly higher risk to risk getting a random reward. Why not just enable a pvm way to get bh points (a bit like currently at very difficult slow levels) considering it is one of the least bottled things.
---
Generation Fortnite, Generation Mobile, Generation Entitled and Generation RS3 has taken over the game and community. 
---
RIP OSRS.
---
The same ones that you would do on PC. Fish.
---
I didn't change my password by clicking the link in the e-mail no, I went to the website without it. I find it strange that you don't need to go through an authenticator when logging in through the website. Seems like that's an easy way to hijack an account.
---
For real. Clue puzzles used to take me 3 minutes. Now it’s like 20 seconds.
---
Initially just get your farming up and then do ranarr herb runs, gets an easy 500k/day for 20 mins of work
---
As others said, run off. I personally bring a slayer staff with auto cast of crumble undead to never fail at hitting the spawn.  You should try to only eat during the freeze (I switch to staff, eat, click spawn, eat again if necessary). When acid pool starts I usually click one spot away and follow that until a long space if clean ground.
---
With time it gets better! I died probably 30 times but am up to 400 kills now and only die if I look away and get hit with a bomb.
---
Either the 3rd or 4th attack option on your weapon.
---
I think my luck only comes in pixel form
---
what does that matter tho?
---
Weight*
---
I would like to again bring up the suggestion, to make rare drop table a secondary drop. It has been briefly discussed on stream before. Lets be honest, not many like getting it as a drop, especially for bosses.

Dust rune is cheap. And both air and earth

Suqahs, one of best xp tasks in game.

First blocked them as they cost ~300k/task since you pretty much have to cannon them, and I had a 1m bank at the time. Theyve stayed blocked since even though I now have a 230m bank and piss away cannonballs for fun

Well it depends what you mean by “cheat.” Deadly boss moss, which literally does what all these “cheat” plugins do was definitely around. Or big wigs which is the same. Plus a bunch of other addons which generally made the game more manageable.
---
What’s with people calling everything cheats? Is it playing the game for you? No. Is it botting? No. It’s like fucking politics in here and people are getting super butthurt over shit which I’m telling you has been in every other mmo for over 15 years now.
---
Just drop a second cannon to reload the other cannon. Then they just shoot cannon balls into each other and you never have to reload smh so simple 4head
---
Oh okay, pretty new at the duel arena. (probably only about 30 duels including clue steps) I went fully aware that I could lose a lot and was comfortable with it. But just kinda gave me a sour taste of duel arena reality. Probably won't go back until the endgame when I have nothing else to do.
---
Start farming, learn how to plant trees and herbs you’ll passively get wayyy more than enough for a bond in herbs.
---
You can unlock rannars at only level 33 and with trees and a few quests you’ll have that in a day or so with very little effort.
---
From then learn herb routes find out how to speed them up, unlock fairy rings do some diaries figure out how the transport systems in the game work.
---
When you learn about farming try to grow toadflax or other cheaper herbs to minimise loss due to learning process then move on to the more expensive herbs when you’re confident.
---
If you have some decent skill levels start doing a few wintertold runs a day, sometimes you’ll get lucky and gain a quick 500k.
---
In between your runs and quests start training slayer for a long term way of never having to worry about cash, it’s a fun skill as it’s all combat based and will allow you to explore the map in new locations.
---
If you want you’re more than welcome to join my clan, it’s mostly new members and a few experienced members who are always willing to help out and walk you through processes as you get used to it all - pm me if interested we’d be happy to have you !

I saw this 58 mins too late!

Oh no. It looks like I slipped. What an unfortunate disaster it would be if someone were to somehow rip off my clothes and ravage the area.
---
Those are the Tekton and Vasa metamorphoses for the Olmlet.
---
Both of those are actually the olmlet ("default" pet so to speak) with methamorphic dust applied to it so it can change forms.
---
Theyre all raid bosses
---
Is this a setting on the app? How do you do it?
---
Normal food has like a 5 tick or something delay on attacks after consumption.  
---
Potions don't have any delay, you can hit within normal delay time after drinking one (even brews).  
---
Karambwans have the same delay as normal food but the timers overlap. 
---
So if you eat shark-karambwan in one tick then it's just the same delay as just eating a shark or a karam separately. If you drink just a brew, you can attack at the same speed as if you didn't drink/eat anything.
---
Ey? I don’t get it.
---
ah i remember no problem &lt;3

Thankyou mate!

they don't even see that, all they see is if the client launched is contained in a "frame" or not

Your whining is hilarious. Do you not use NMZ or the blowpipe?

I guess that's one thing I like about WoW from what I've seen is you can customize how you want certain things to be in your UI from the positioning to the size of the UI etc.

Just turn the 1m into Platinum Tokens so you aren't tempted to spend it. Use the coins on a banker and it'll give you the option to turn the into Platinum Tokens. You can turn them back to GP at anytime you want.

I received a password reset email yesterday even though I never done it, on a email that has only ever been used for my RS account.

You can do a few simple quests to gain access to it

I have both a galaxy note 8 and an iphone 8 plus and both of them start cooking after like 20/30 mins of running around rs lmao
---
It actually is highly worth it as an upgrade from steel or iron
---
Yeah you profit from it but it leads to powercreep if extremely good gear is only 3m and cheap to use
---
Like amazon lmfao
---
If you know your rotation it makes all the difference, you plan where you stand at each wave and you will almost never need to tank the range and mage simultaneously.
---
That said, it does slow down the caves a bit

How much money do you have at your disposal? Rigour should be first upgrade and then DHCB is pretty solid too.
---
Yeah they have legit no way of addressing this apparently 🦀🦀
---
I mean, trying to do the inferno on your account is possible, however it would be very difficult and be very rng based as well. If I were you, focus on getting defense, range and mage all very high before you attempt it. It is supposed to be a high level pvm challenge; you should only do it once you've accomplished a lot of other big things in the game. Either way, whatever you decide to do, I say good luck!

I'm glad to see new players constantly joining the OSRS community. 
---
First off beware of phishing links, streams and emails.
---
Double EXP DOES NOT exist in OSRS and you should enable 2FA for your account and your email, set up recovery questions and you will want to activate a bank pin as well.
---
If you are looking to be efficient early game there are a ton of guides on youtube for low levels wether it be skilling, money making or questing. 
---
I haven't played early game in a few years and wouldn't be sure where to start with all the new content, but don't get discouraged.
---
Take your time and enjoy yourself.
---
Yes the click boxes are terrible
---
Just a quicker, easier, buyable 99, but a 99 regardless
---
I once got Reddit Gold on a post with 2 upvotes, which then got removed for irrelevancy. The reddit gods work in mysterious ways.
---
Unlocking Herblore enables you to start cleaning cheap herbs like guam, and if you are someone willing to do chaos druids for levelling (wary of left click lures on fake chaos druids - players dressed up), it can be quite decent $ and exp.
---
You should start Waterfall quest asap as it gives you a good xp jump for attack/strength. 
---
Increasing agility would be good too
---
That’s a good idea. Cheating definitely. But a clever plug in for sure.
---
Noice
---
Wym?
---
Have some self respect.
---
either agro all of them and run through jad or agro them all and chin them down. my last pure run i tanked healers, but i only used sweets pre-jad and had full food (7 sets of manta ray/karam + 5 brews) at jad
---
That's some Andy Kaufman shit.
---
Feel like I could frame this without instantly getting called a Runescape nerd. Regardless, very iconic location, and pretty cool to include everything relevant to the area, like the dungeon entrance and the gnome stronghold. 
---
I love it!
---
To be fair, a lot of the armors look better on the female model, and the chat dialogue heads expressions seem more *expressive*
---
If you want to cash out fast in an easy way, collect the bones from the things you kill and sell them at the grand exchange.
---
I promise there are faster ways to come by gold but this will feel familiar to you, and make your decision about the scimitar feel insignificant.

all dragons are weak to stab, you need to bring a hasta

Don’t use attack prayers until the 360s come out if your having trouble saving prayer points

You get used to it tbh.
---
just bring dwh
---
Treat yoself 2019!
---
Which brings up the age old question, where the fuck do black weapons/armor come from?
---
The real answer is to grind whatever you want, but the following are the most common goals:
---
- full graceful outfit (done by doing rooftop agility and collecting marks of grace that are on the ground)
---
- fire cape (completing the fight caves)
---
- fighter torso (doing barbarian assault and getting enough points in each role)
---
- helm of neitiznot, dragon scimitar, Barrows gloves, ultimately quest cape
---
- slayer mask 
---
These goals will all take some time, but if you are looking for goals to stick to and achieve, these are good ones, none of which require 99 in any skill or hundreds of hours doing the same thing.
---
Well it's 70 skill requirements are more what I'm talking about
---
Yea green-green is probably a good place to start for learning, the need for specific positioning isn't as prevalent as it is in the others so you can focus on your gear/prayer switches more.
---
Maybe you'll be less myopic about the issue when bots crash the profitability of your favorite boss.
---
Definitely, don't tank the healers. There's a couple ways to do it on pures.
---
 You can drag Jad around either the north or west rocks so the healers all spawn behind him. Then with a long range weapon (I bring Karil's xbow just for this) you can aggro the healers but they will remain trapped. The downside to that method is dragging Jad is a bit of a bitch and requires prayer switching based on sound.
---
You can stand in a way so that at least two of the healers spawn and get stuck behind Jad naturally (without you moving... you do still have to aggro them) and then you can pick off the remaining two healers. 
---
Finally, you can aggro all the healers and then run through Jad, which is pretty easy but does have a trick. You need to wait for Jad to start an attack animation and then run through if you time it wrong you're going to need to pray melee in case Jad pops off a quick melee attack.

I agree lock zulrah behind sote so i can get my zulrah alt to quest haha
---
Takes more luck and whether or not you start stalling your account level progression to PvM with friends/clanmates or solo instead of leveling.  Stuff like joining in CoX raids, couple hours of Zulrah with Ahrims Trident/Void Range Blowpipe peppered in, a random Zenyte drop from Demonic Gorillas, extreme Sl
---
The house does cut in the cost though and I agree some of the money draining skills cut the bank value back hard.  Getting Construction up for the pool and appropriate amenities is its own upgrade cost.
---
Lower your fps
---
I like that that everything in the foreground looks straight out of RS, like it's on the same grid as the game itself.

This man.. I fear
---
You can do it with shit gear but there is really no reason to be trying with low range/mage, they are pretty inexpensive to level and will be a huge help.
---
it also has a 90s neon windbreaker vibe to it
---
but somebody had to put them in there...
---
How do I join your all female clan? It would be nice to meet some other ladies 😊
---
Remove all non BiS str pots, it's time
---
/s
---
You can turn that off if you really wanted to
---
Oh you are welcome :)
---
Definitely recommend combo food and eating on range attacks. If you get hit a 35 by a range attack, a 15 by a snake and another range attack is coming you’re dead if your hp wasn’t saved up in the first place.
---
At the very least it's tons of fun, which is what really matters. Money won't be super good but *shrug*
---
that is a phishing email..
---
I like this toothy grin! &lt;3
---
This speaks so much about your pvp knowledge
---
Me too but it turns out it's a guy
---
I think Zulrah should be revamped completely tbh. 99 percent of the fight is standing where a guide once told you to and praying accordingly.
---
I think it would help the botting issue too if it was more reaction based.
---
Wha?
---
you still offered him the money.
---
Here’s a tip that helped me a ton with the healers on a pure, use one inv spot to bring a few chins, when the healers all get close to jad just hit one and you’ll most likely pull them all, if the spawn is right most of them will even get trapped, as for the waves you’re definitely gonna want to use the airplane method
---
Why does he do that?
---
Try over 300 steam games.
---
I like how most of the gear looks on female characters like bandos or most robes

I used to take super atks and regular str pots with me to do slayer in pray gear to save money. Then I caved in and bought endgame gear, tried it with super combats and never looked back since.

My iPhone 7+ heats up, but it’s not that bad, and I’ve racked up hundreds and hundreds of hours on mobile lol

Sounds like the boss is easy enough to where nobody thought making a guide was worth it

Secret black knight smithing techniques?
---
If you can defeat a zamorak warrior with mage or range(can be safe spotted) he drops a rune scim. Hes under the altar west of the battlefield thats south of ardy

And here I am with 78 range 80 defense and 91 hp with no cape.  Feels bad
---
Speak for yourself
---
Because I'm lazy mostly. I learnt to do switches with a 3 item switch but after a while I just got lazy about it and only took a staff, house tabs, a magic pot and sharks. Means I can just watch youtube whilst casually killing zulrah
---
There are tons of guides for max xp and max points at NMZ. But can someone help me figure out how to set it up for max points while afking?
---
By afk, I mean flicking rapid restore every minute and sipping an overload every 5 mins without having to worry about ice gloves switching or using the power up to get rid of the DT bosses.
---
Scazmatars are best
---
Could land of goblins be added to osrs? The ending of the quest could be change simple to Zanik needing a key to open bandos box and leaving with you.
---
Could path of glouphrie be added to osrs? Warped terrorbirds were 50k slayer xp per hour
---
Could firemaking cape perk be changed to allow you not to be interupted by cold of wintertod? As of now firemaking cape's perk shares same effect with kandarin headgear.
---
Yesterday there was a patch in rs3 that accidentally removed an ability and (unrelated to the prior mistake) certain actions in combat caused people to disconnect for short periods of time.

There are more things that happened but these seem to be the main two.

Hahahahahahahaha what a G of a grandama
---
Golly
---
Still your most intelligent sounding sentence in this thread 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I love you, fuing0
---
Yeah I have that issue still too sometimes. Very inconsistent
---
im 89 range and debating to buy 43m worth of red chins or buying acp
---
The command is:  
---
    java -version
---
Chill bro, gotta understand if people don't wanna spend 1000 hours for that little extra bonus. If the bonus is so insignificant what is the problem to get it other way? Either way a rune scimi isn't the biggest goal, f2p can also get 99 rc, max their acc or even get 200m on all f2p skills, so I think the being able to obtain the rune scimi via  pvm challenge that can also take hundreds upon hundreds of hours don't seem that crazy.
---
Dart tips are good $ too if you can sustain the bars.
---
You can get the 25 Agility from the quest straight. If you did Knight Sword's quest (F2p) you get 29 smithing instant.
---
if you use the WASD camera on runelite this doesnt happen because you have to press enter to type
---
https://youtu.be/uN2OGBs5PKU
---
Idk personally I can't stand the animation smoothing
---
It's like the animations are designed with their choppyness in mind so they add little nuances that are lost when you add tweening
---
Right, I wasn't thinking about points. :p
---
To ur suggestion, I thought about that before, just with limit time to play now and who likes to pet hunt/col log didn't wanna waste time on them if I could be fighting a different boss instead/faster. Thanks for the suggestion though. (:
---
Just skip past the ad, it’s not hard.
---
Jagged needs to authenticate 3rd party clients by recognizing a select few and distribute and rotate tokens, then repeatedly warn then ban accounts using illegitimate clients. These suggestions aren’t great, the game shouldn’t be modified to delay botting for each activity, the game should just not be botted.
---
Sophisticated scripts rely on special api’s available through certain clients, we just need to single out the cheaters and prevent them from playing anymore.
---
I wish it didn't crash my client
---
How do people sleep there at night? You know because of the noise, the fear of your son not coming home anymore and adventurers knocking on your door all the time?
---
Its attainable if you just grind for it. Literally everything in this game is attainable if you work for it ya know??
---
Dont bother buying chins, you'll get 99 during slayer anyway.
---
Not sure if that logic is very sound. 15 dollar Blue snowball mic is way more affordable than a recurring 11 dollars/mo long term.
---
Even on the new prif course there's some spots like that (the chimeny click is really off center)
---
Appreciate it. :)
---
I did it at like 90 hp with wines. I would bring 6 wines a trip and house tab after every kill and bank.
---
My iPhone 6s doesn’t get hot, I play at 30fps or 20 If I’m afking.
---
yeah my thinking is 99 range would be very useful at cox
---
\&gt; Other third party clients exist and jagex can't ban some of them (not a shouldn't, but literally cannot enforce it according to public statements). These things have to be assessed in bulk. So yes, these plugins matter. 
---
Yeah no a lot of this is Jemflox bullshit - the concept of Jagex being unable to anyhow differentiate between different clients connecting to their game (something virtually any competent or incompetent multiplayer game can and does do) is comical.  By that logic, theyd also be refusing to ban bots.   Hell, even the runelite guy said that the default runelite client sends a unique client message.  They can selectively enforce without banning all 3rd clients, and they will do exactly that if things continue to get worse.
---
\&gt; Clue scroll puzzle box solver is substantially faster and easier than doing it yourself. No need to be patronizing in your attempt to hide that. 
---
The feeling of patronization is actually just your embarrassment at realizing that your logic would dictate we should literally ban quest guides and calculators.  The solution algorithm exists and I literally can make a utility to run it separate from rl or any runescape client.  Unless your grand plan is to literally ban all software you're kind of senselessly ranting about this.
---
\&gt; By removing the plugin, it incentivizes either just doing the raid regardless or getting good at manually scouting. 
---
It incentivizes printing out 2 small wheels and looking at them.  The same exact action except analog and not digital.  There is no loss of speed or difficulty, there is literally just a loss of comfort you walnut nobbler.

Not a runelite feature.

Mmm, sure thing honey.  Old man shouts at cloud.

Instead of a new rotation, a captcha is required every time you try to enter the boat.

True endgame is wearing a quirky set of fashionscape and a Tbow while you and your date for the hour do the follow-dance seven steps away from the GE counter so everyone can see you talk about weed and your kill counts.

Better love story then twilight
---
I don't know why this is being downvoted, all of these are pure gold.
---
&gt;​Except that of the game existing. Runelite getting removed would lose more playerbase than EOC and no wildy combined
---
Lmao
---
I tend to go with the classic “hop” or “fuck off”
---
Kinda surprised there isn't any mobile clients popping up
---
I know runelite said no  but you'd think osbuddy would use this opportunity to take over a niche spot for clients.
---
true but how many people are willing to do 1400 hours of sorcerers garden? So far in the past 6,5 years it's been one.
---
Ngl I would hang this in my apartment
---
imagine not setting drop notifications from the in-game settings
---
I would love to see an OSRS docuseries with Mod Ash as the narrator

No, it is a 1/1048576 drop.

You done Dream Mentor?

Power ammy is better all around, but slightly less str bonus.
---
50 kc here no pet and getting close to 99 slay :(
---
Nice but prices rice and fall.
---
Damn, what’s your kc?
---
They won't vote yes for any skill it doesn't matter what you do.
---
I dont like the idea of limiting zulrah kills. But I do think they should add some reqs for killing zulrah. As it is, its way too botted and makes it not worth doing anymore.
---
Rotations would be coded within a day, this update would do nothing besides fucking normal players over. Fixing the bot problem isn't a matter of making game content harder to obtain, they should attack the bots themselves.
---
Not yet and yes it will still be viable. Normal g maul after nerf will still function fine for the classic DDS-maul combo. The upgraded version which in the newest blog can be +1 and only costs around 500k will also be available. This means pures can still use it as a primary and those wanting to AGS, Claw or Elder Maul combo with the G Maul will be forced to risk a bit more for it.
---
Personally I think they went from one extreme to another. 500k and no +1 or 2M and allow +1 but this current proposition will barely affect any meta, and just acts as a barrier to entry for less experienced PKers which will be going up against people able and willing to use a +1 to G Maul combo.
---
Is it common to be hacked? Well, no. The risk is especially low if your account doesn't have anything really worth taking. The real question is do you lock your door when you leave the house? You really should, even if it isn't a perfect defence. Put the security in place and don't click on (sketchy) links, don't sign up for double exp, etc.
---
Unrelated to this topic, I wouldn't treat the quest order on the wiki as absolute truth. For example, waterfall quest is doable at even 10hp, but you might have an easier time doing Witch's house first for the HP boost.
---
No thanks
---
OP just finished the quest in 5 hours using guides and feels entitled.
---
I used to use dragon battleaxe spec to save money.  Still occasionally do it honestly.
---
I pked a d pic there once. Guy attacked me with it on a high risk world, then cried in pm asking for it back
---
Thanks! Totally look into some brush and texture painting tutorials for Gimp or Photoshop, I've been practicing off of a few of those.
---
Its also worth noting that out of you your att/str, ranged, and magic only the highest one will be calculated in the combat formula.
---
So if you have high att/str and 1 ranged it'll take a long time before you gain a combat level from gaining a ranged level because you'll have to catch up to your att/str first.
---
I hope it is.
---
full graceful is overrated as fuck.
---
This makes me wanna try my hand in making a ranged mole guide myself
---
 Can we have the option of prioritizing "walk here" or looting items, removing the attack options from players/NPC's, with something similar to the shift button drop? A button that would temporarily remove the attack option, without having to manually change it in the settings.
---
No worries bro anytime
---
Are you mentally challenged? Its more about the fact that jamflex keeps forcing pvm content in an area where I can be killed because they are too idiotic to realise that wont "ReViTaLiZe pVp". I literally am not upset that I went into a pvp zone where I know brain dead trihards are going to kill me despite not risking anything, im upset that if I want to comllete pvm content Jagex created, I have no choice but to go into the wilderness.
---
Inb4 "dont go in to the wildy then", thats the problem, is that jagex provided me with content that I WANT to do, but they stuck it somewhere people can kill me. THAT IS THE PROBLEM, not that im dying, but that to complete pvm content jagex provided for pvmers, I have to even risk that. Idc about you killing me lol.
---
Trying to deflect the topic away from your poor life choices? You sound upset
---
Not gonna lie not a huge fan of warding or bringing dung to osrs but I gotta admit this is well thought out and quite an interesting idea
---
Same, I find the animation smoothing really jarring. But the extended map drawing is great

---
hey only just read your comment a bit late, thanks bro and i agree, you have said it really nicely. i got back into cycling and it has been really positive
---
uncle stop
---
Definitely an exaggeration, it takes that long to hit 70 in every skill if trying efficiently.
---
I used to be an adventurer like you, until I took an arrow to the knee
---
I can't argue about rates getting nerfed, maybe zulrah should be a little less to/hr or something or should have a higher quest requirement, but I think doing a massive mechanics overhaul that makes the boss impossible to memorize is too far. There's major changes that could be added to nerf the boss like a blowpipe nerf (thus lowering the price and demand of blowpipe parts), and putting it behind a grandmaster removes accessibility enough to prevent bots from being a major issue.
---
The fact that there's 2 issues here muddies the problem a bit. The first issue is the bots being able to farm, and the second issue is even without the farmers, the BP is too easy to get and too powerful.
---
I think trying to attack both of these with one change is too much.
---
That's not meme-y though
---
It's much faster to train with red chins. Might be worth spending the money for 99 then returning to bossing for more profit
---
Yes exactly i just didn't want to overexplain too much but you're completely right, i could have mentioned that thanks man
---
Thank you for that awesome explanation. I understand a lot more now. So, I have a pure that has 50 attack, 1 def, 1 prayer (but might make it 13), and I’m going to get 85+ str, range, and mage. Should I stay 50 attack? Or no? What should I do with attack in your opinion?
---
&gt; No Patrick, being able to left click straight on the exchange clerk at the GE to access the exchange is not a bannable offense.
---
&gt; 
---
Left click Use on Bones is extremely broken.
---
Remember when AHK was banned because it was "not fair" that people could drop Granie or empty pouches faster than others?
---
Soft pass to be honest. My issue with Dungeoneering and Sailing is that they're too much a minigame for me. 
---
Entering caves and raiding for the boss is, well, much like that. This is why CoX shines as a minigame, it incorporates many skills in order to beat.
---
Just can't make everyone happy though, many others would vote in favour of Sailing/Dungeoneering.
---
I'd like to believe "gold pieces" is more standard for fantasy-MMORPGs than "gold points", least of all "golden points"
---
I mean I don't even have an idea of what fantasy game calls coins "points"
---
Theres a cap on how much you can do underwater iirc
---
Demonic gorillas are similar/better xp than afking black demons though.
---
The reason for killing regular abyssal demons would be to afk an easy task (or barrage them for efficiency) instead of putting in focus and effort for better loot and somewhat better xp rates.
---
As noted, sire doesn't need to be amazing xp/hr, but getting 9-13k slayer xp/hr while doing a *slayer boss* feels like a joke.
---
I believe I was your teleblocker on that kill, if I remember correctly we PK'd a dragon pickaxe together, ah, it seems as though my split has not yet arrived.
---
Do people use the cooking or crafting guild anymore (other than banking with the skillcape)
---
Playskill? By clicking somewhere where you know something is? I'm okay saying stuff like inferno takes skill but arceeus library? It takes a decent memory and a few minutes looking it up on the wiki without Runelite lol. Idk if I'd call that "playskill" as you say.
---
Last time I checked 60 something, not that high to be honest but it's better to go for it while you're still doing slayer for a reason.
---
Huh, that's funny... that's because the item never used to check for the quest completion and we added that fix/check in recently which caused this issue. Thanks for letting us know :)
---
I've started the waterfall quest, recipe for disaster, and druidic ritual. Based on your comment and the others above I think this will keep me busy for a while. I'm planning on grinding some agility though before going deeper in those bigger quests as it seems most beneficial.
---
theres some black magic bullshit where you change your target to the melee minion right before it would throw and then click attack on the big boss again. if you straight up hit the big boss his def is too high to hit, and if you only hit the minions the boss has some special attack that really hard really fast.
---
Maybe a harder version that gives better drops after sote instead of locking it behind sote?
---
When will we finally see a bug bounty program started by Jagex?
---
The state of game and account security would be drastically improved with *something* to motivate researchers and potential bad actors to report exploits and vulnerabilities.
---
Should be a civil discussion here in the comments.
---
Does it fully crash your client or does it just lock it up while loading? (I ask because the latter was my issue on my laptop and someone contacted me with a solution)
---
That's very helpful! I'll keep this in mind as I progress.
---
Not even close to accurate but I will let you have your say. DBM and these clients are very very different. Your just trying to justify your use of it and that’s okay.
---
&gt; A lot of Runelite's features are... I mean, let's be real, they could be replaced with a word doc or wiki visit. Or even just a good memory.
---
Ah yes the good memory that helps with macroing with the Menu Swapper, or the word document that literally shows you what slides to click in the puzzle.
---
As I said in another comment, the skill is having all the book locations memorized and knowing which books you currently have so that you can pick up the ones you don't have as you pass them without waiting to check and look them up. 
---
The plugin removes this skill.
---
You can get a rune pouch for around 500k using the ring of wealth enchantment scrolls btw
---
Again, we're talking about average players, not max efficiency. Agility alone is like 30 hours from 1-70. Mining and Woodcutting are pretty slow as well.
---
Turn back to what?
---
This is the equivalent of a 30 year old man wearing a onesie.
---
sit
---
O dang its that cheap these days? God bless third world countries and OCR. Also yeh, captchas are useless beyond stopping skiddies with curl scripts.
---
well aware, but if someone is seriously that dependent on runelite that they wouldn't touch the game without it, it's for the better.
---
Have you considered locking Zulrah behind SotE? Vorkath is behind DS2 and is easier but offers more reward due to the amount Zulrah is being botted leaving the prices low
---
Keep this comment with you, and when the time comes you'll understand.
---
Half of 99 is 92.
---
I'm very interested in this, not sure which way I would vote. Up-voted for visibility. Curious to see what others and Mods have to say about this.
---
Nice one nosey 😉
---
Whats a 70 70 70 iron?
---
Didnt censor your slayer damage %.
---
Gf account
---
I'll think about it...
---
Amazing concept, afraid of too much "new stuff". This is def. one of the best baselines for a new skill, i've seen to date.
---
1. Why is the cadarn clan symbol the old star version and not the stag like it in is rs3? All the other clans have their proper symbol except this one. Just like why rs3 changed it, it looks too much like a saradomin symbol atm
---
2. Can the pc client please be fixed so it shows the full login screen picture, atm its cropped off short even in full screen
---
3. Could we also perhaps get the option to choose our login screen picture from previous versions like we can in rs3? I'd love to keep the prif login for good over the normal image
---
How is he limiting himself? idk what a 70/70/70 is.
---
Ah well fair enough. You can find rune scimitar in the ourania altar
---
ground item overlay for mobile is understandable  
---
colorblind shouldn't even be listed as it's common sense to have it  
---
 world hopper shouldn't be listed since it already exists and should've existed from the get go.
---
if someone considers anything other than having smooth&amp;stable 50fps a necessity that they wouldn't play without, even more of a reason to get rid of 3rd party clients and the peasants
---
V
---
what about the crystal bow and armor for solos? or is it still bad even with the accuracy? same speed as scythe
---
Yeah but couldn’t it just be said “The client just helps people learn the spots. You can learn them yourself if you wanted to!!”  It’s essentially the same reason people are allowed to use clients to aid them in doing clues. The information is available without clients, but is easily accessible with them.
---
I’m from big pine! What year did you graduate?
---
TIL I'm the asshole.
---
The main issue imo was that there were some degradable items that Jagex decided to remove and you only got a full refund if you had it fully recharged. The only place this was written down prior to the update was in an edit to a reply to a post on Reddit, which said it was happening last week. Then the change was made this week, so even if people repaired their items to prepare last week, they still got screwed.
---
Furthermore, they broke a bunch of other things as part of the update, and there are nothing but patch weeks scheduled for this month.
---
Lower ping
---
Put all your lamps on Runecrafting. Be patient on the MM2 maze part I guess, that shit's annoying. Also fuck Rat Catchers.
---
Crystal graceful please! (using both marks of grace and crystals!)
---
he just ruined the best part of rs for you
---
I was doing pyramid plunder and in one of the rooms you can see some Keldagrim or other dwarven basement.  In another room there is an ice cave (i assume its icy, it looks white).
---
Not enough leaping trout on the ground
---
Not if the drop rate of Unsired was lowered to compensate, like what Jagex did with Chambers of Xeric when removing dragon stuff from it.
---
I’m not sure the whole context of the post
---
But if you’re basically a fresh brand new player I’d love to see someone new journey their way through this game. Will give me nostalgia. Anyways good luck on your adventure keep on grinding my friend!
---
Flax is worthless. Bow strings on the other hand are ok.
---
"Jagex should just ban the bots"
---
Let me guess, someone stole your sweet-roll.
---
Useful or expensive? I'd go Sennisten or Annakarl. Both are useful for clues and are expensive.
---
Glory is better.
---
But why HCIM and not HC normie?
---
::toggleroof
---
Only if you actually wear it I think. But the top comment says he didn't bring teles, so I'm assuming he didn't have it on him.
---
Go back to RS3 you scum
---
 Can we use the Elven coloring crystals to change the color of crystal weapons, tools and equipment?
---
hahaha what a pathetic attempt at PR
---
OP don't delete this post, in a year when your a high level player just take in all the nostalgia.
---
Only explanation I could form is with the rune shields you are creating the shield out of bars from scratch, where as the shields you are just connecting a broken shield together like a puzzle piece.
---
I did the exact same thing in my most recent slayer task jad, I ended up waiting for BP specs on so many rounds
---
Fun fact, SpongeBob was going correct Mr.Krabs but was interrupted. It is definitely NOT #2.
---
I love the style, please make clue hunter vs. Max brid
---
thanks you so much!
---
&gt; one of the best baselines for a new skill I have seen to date. 
---
The only Part in this whole suggestion that i am adamant about is the baseline, everything that i added after that is just my vision to help people capture the essence of my idea, and everything can be changed!
---
Exactly some of these people don’t consider how shit hurts new players and OP probably already did sote which is why is saying that quest
---
Delve into Arcane Ruins that are very similar to dungeons from Dungeoneering but instead of getting Xp from finishing the Dungeon, you will have to Collect Different Types of Resources and Study Arcane Transcripts that will give you Xp And blueprints for Magic Equipment.
---
When you Exit the Ruins, you can Combine the Resource you've gathered and the Knowledge you've learnt into Magical Armour and Equipment.
---
They've been over this, they're basically at capacity, which is why they've been adding additional storage areas. Make use of these and manage your bank better.
---
oh right, nice, it will be way better with a salve.
---
Ive since increased my wealth and can afford super's! :) thanks anyway
---
I wanted to

What a jad lad
---
[Suggestion] Remove Mage Training Arena altogether.
---
I tried it for the first time ever this week and feel as though I have aged a thousand years. All I've done is get part of the way towards Infinity Boots.  My jaw actually dropped when I saw that each completion of the Telekinetic Theater was only 2 points.
---
Shouldn't you stop getting angry over doing some runecrafting?
---
This, I had issues a few months back and had to find a fix to use browser again
---
they also did big overhauls with the way client interacted with server, didn't they? the lag that was introduced with bot nuke was actually insane i remember
---
Locking it behing SOTE will hurt a lot of legit player tho. Making things way harder to do for both bots/gold farmers and legit players isnt the solution.
---
The gmaul being OP is a separate issue from the balancing of the high-mid to high tier PKing meta. Nerfing it doesn't really change anything (except for removing arguably the least skill reliant finisher in the game).
---
Venge + spec combos have been the bread and butter of high level PKing forever, and even with a gmaul nerf there are still a litany of possible KO weapons/specs, including the hit + 1 spec g maul (which can still stack 50+ in addition to a venge). 
---
This g maul nerf just stops people from 3 swinging a g maul for more than max HP before you even account for something like a venge combo, which is good for the health of the game.
---
Nice bro!
---
I never sold the white cats so he has nothing to worry about :).
---
Nothing good will come from having your items appear for others. The community would take advantage of that no doubt.
---
I'd like the rs3 system where you can get your items for free if you can reach your grave in a minute or 2. If not it goes to an interface where you have to pay a percentage of your gear's worth to get it back.
---
that's even worse than i thought lmao, thanks for the correction
---
Seeing as Im done with rc, I dont know why I would get angry from doing it. Shouldn't you stop getting angry when people tell you your favorite skill is shit?
---
100%
---
I also put some into Agility at first because I disliked it and needed agility levels more badly than RC. But trust me, agility isn't that bad once you get 60 for seers, just complete the Kandarin Hard Diary. After that its super easy.
---
Runecrafting never stops sucking until 77 for bloods, and you'll need high RC for like every elite diary
---
Is it possible to have a look into Zalcano's mechanics, right now world 2 has completion times of about 1min 50 secs with the average loot coming out at 50k and 4 man groups having completion times of 3mins and average loot of 250k.  
---
With this difference in gp/hr it is driving players away from participating in larger groups and forming smaller groups of 4 in other worlds.  The problem with this is that small groups don't last long and disband quickly.  Another problem is that people are constantly switching worlds to hide their groups.
---
SOLUTIONS: 
---
Make Zalcano health pull bigger by 'x%' as more players enter the room.
---
Add a debuff by 'x%' as more than 4 players enter the room.
---
Make it so no more than 4 players can enter the room.
---
I believe you drop cash when you die with it, a few hundred k.
---
He needs Runelite to outline the bank booth clickbox in neon green or else his brain can't comprehend where to click

That actually sounds pretty cool, thanks for the tl;dr, I couldn't read the whole thing cause I'm at work.

What part of 7 attacks -&gt; special -&gt; 7 attacks -&gt; other special isnt predictable lul

Those are some long ass kills, do you have any idea why it's taking you so long?
---
That art style is crazy good
---
selling cow, 2k
---
It’s good but you could save up for rapier, it shouldn’t take that long
---
We also got Addendum back when the 07 servers came out.
---
Still don’t really understand.. if it’s half the XP and it took me 2 weeks to gain it, wouldn’t the other half also take 2 weeks?
---
Np my friend, Glad you liked it!
---
What do you usually do on mobile? Run? Doesn't seem that hard actually.
---
The 2500 brew guy
---
I was anwsering not askin
---
Ratcatchers won't take as long overall, but I'd say the guards part is worse. Just a lot of the time they can see you, it doesn't make any sense. Also there's times where there patterns line up in such a way that you literally can't complete it. If that happens, just switch worlds.
---
Suggestion: let me click a button that says "I want my account maxed with collection log filled" to instantly complete the game because I'm lazy. No better yet let me have that button clicked automatically via speech recognition because clicking a mouse is hard.
---
Gets you more herbs on average because your chances of the herb patch running out goes down.

Whoosh

That guy must exclusively play very low level Ironman accounts or something if he thinks that's the most fun era RuneScape had to offer.

Everything in the warding poll failed.

Not anything at all? Do you know that mobile is the same exact game as desktop?? There's no difference.

Jesus I never understand how people can be so toxic

You can do raids.
---
Hard farming contracts are also worth a ton. And you get more herbs on average the higher level you are.
---
Give the Sire's tentacles the same mechanic as Zulrah's melee attack, after a few ticks have the tentacle swipe where the player would have been. Make this a possible option instead of having to disorient the sire each time, considering there are moments where the respiratory system tanks harder than first phase without a spec weapon, over half the kill consists of taking out the systems that tank your hits.
---
I got that pet early as well. Grats man
---
Dang man! Best of luck, I was so afk doing my shaman task and was so shocked when I got it
---
For melee it is that simple yes (assuming attack speed is the same). Range and mage are more complicated because monsters don't use spells or ammo like players do, so those attacks are weird.
---
You so seriously underestimate the chances of winning the lottery.
---
How do you feel about players buying voted from other players in polls? Is this allowed or should we report it somehow when we witness it? It doesn't seem healthy for poll integrity even if it may not affect the results.
---
You actually have decent stats. You really need to hit nzm for a month with DH and get your strength to 99, defense to 75-80, and attack to 85. Won’t take long. Also get barrows gloves.
---
I think the drop during the day is also the simple fact that a lot of RS players have work/school during that time. Night is when most games have their peaks, during weekdays at least.
---
tbh I don't get why you're seething so hard over runecrafting
---
Could be that there is a lot going on graphically during the specials, and it overwhelms the mobile client.
---
Mobile used to crash a lot if zoomed out in a resource heavy area while moving (fossil island / sulliuscep trees). Haven’t tried myself in raids though. Reporting as a bug did get it fixed on Fossil island eventually.
---
Spoiler: He went back
---
Runelite can tell you exactly what to do at all times when fighting 6 jads too. That doesn't mean it's easy to do legitimately or that the "core design is broken".
---
gave up?
---
nah, i just went to sleep and knew i couldn't smelt 13k ore in a short period of time
---
It's not difficult with your trash fire of a country 🤷‍♂️
---
This is big, if true
---
Honestly it's kinda how the osrs team messes up from time to time. It is still jagex after all
---
As someone else has already said, people refer to Zulrah as both male and female in game, but I just go with female. I haven't asked Zulrah her preferred pronouns though.
---
Thats spicy! Woah!
---
Blessed d’hide is better than Karis for Zulrah, because you don’t take any mage damage.
---
I'm not colorblind and it's literal eye cancer trying to read with the transparent chat box
---
Well if you’ve defeated some of the bosses already there will be a flag hanging in the champions guild basement. If your talking about scrolls. You can get the completionist log at varrock musuem to show you the once’s you currently already have abs get from the point it was released
---
Its allowed, probably half the playerbase or more at this point use it or osbuddy. As with every non official thing though, use at your own risk
---
yo this is awesome
---
I agree, but do you consider every form of auto-casting in the game 'ezscape'?
---
Anything? STUDY
---
Sorry, where is the reach here?
---
It's a whole country built on "fuck everyone else so long as I am OK"
---
I'm sorry to say, you're an everyone else.
---
That’s why you go for the 18 year olds 😎😎
---
Only if you don't hate Anish Kapoor.
---
 I'd say try it to see if you like it. Even if you are not at max efficiency but you are having more fun/ making more money than you are right now, I think that would be worth it. If you don't like it, or money is too slow, you can always go back to your previous methods

Which means that you gotta repair the wheel yourself and pay tons of attention. 4D-Chess, may as well do 3t4g at the Quarry at that point.
---
FWIW as someone who knows nothing about art or drawing I find this really impressive. That's so cool that with some proper modifications you can create such nice, natural looking background out of the in-game graphics and avoid drawing it by hand, and it fit this piece perfectly.
---
Spectres, not worth the ppots
---
Like many people here I have severe crippling autism and obtained all unique items from the mage training arena on my ironman.

Can confirm that telekinetic grab minigame needs to allow autocast or give you more points per run.

The amount of extra time and effort spent playing this minigame when compared to the others is disproportionate. When you need the same amount of Telekinetic points as you do Graveyard points they should take the same amount of time to earn in my opinion.
---
I spent 1k kills there with no uniques :(
---
No one said anything like that dingus, you're just flying off the rails because I don't want to see people use that T_D shit in the osrs sub
---
What the hell is wrong with you dude, you don't even know my politics. Fucking Reddit spergs
---
It just never reaches anywhere near the front page, so people don't see it unless they're browsing new multiple times per day like you and meee
---
Fair enough. I don't find the room difficult either. Auto-casting contributes nothing towards solving the puzzles. I would argue it allows people attempting them fairly to focus on the puzzles even more.
---
wish i could unlearn runescape then actually enjoy it, having put nearly 20k hours into it since classic i now have to do everything at max efficiency(minus tick manipulation/real greaser shit) and its just not the same

2/1 is still a fraction.

They don't ban people until they break rules.

The issue with lowering the levels for smithing is the alch value of rune items.

How many QOLs do we need to add together to get one EZscape update? Because there's a constant stream of small QOLs that may not be much on their own, but contribute to making the game easier. Inb4 you call me a virgin max caper

ok thanks after i get 70 herblore ill get 70 prayer thnaks

Most of the comments in our thread aren't actually helpful though, it's just a bunch of people memeing and posting about their own nostalgia. In a way you're right, this does perfectly illustrate the difference between the subs. And I wouldn't change it for the world, lol...

Little do you know, I’ve set a script to run in the background to key log anyone that’s not OP. Thank you for your account! Muhaha
---
This is hilarious
---
Idk we'll see I'm just not on board with it. I might change my mind if we get a beta with it being utilised and not harmful to the game.
---
Nice you even did it the hard way with rune cbow
---
I dont think its okay in this day and age to wear a white amulet of power
---
Can the wilderness agility course occasionally spawn Larran’s key pieces similar to marks of grace which can be combined into a full Larran’s key. May give incentive to train there and pk there. The pieces could be dropped to the killer on death but not be tradeable.
---
It’s rare for me to see art regarding Runescape that I like, but damn this is incredible. Great job!

This is just a Suggestion from a Simple man on Reddit, it's lightyears from anything like a beta haha
---
zulrah gives blowpipe not kraken. zulrah has no slayer req
---
The reddit community specifically was loud and clear that they DID want SOME new skill, they just couldn't agree on what it was.
---
This is why people laugh at Reddit lol

single value answer sheets would do jack shit for you which is why answer sheets for more advanced questions are multi paged and go through the question step by step.

So the source is your far reaching theory? lol

Yeah i dont like rc either

I call them dandy rock candy I mean just look at those bars, they gonna taste like after eight I bet

Get that range way up boi

The droprate is 1/800 so that's not really wierd.

I kinda had to don't even have range level for blowpipe lol
---
This meme can be understood in a high IQ and low IQ ways, both seems to work fine
---
LothricsLegs... Nice name!
---
I inferred it. It’s only natural you create items that are more powerful, to have hacker requirements, otherwise why have any requirements of levels at all?). But I’ll take your version over none at the end of the day. 
---
Power creep issues are natural, and to be honest I prefer their existence, as it shows there’s progress in higher end content expansion. If they decide to do the whole Virtur route, it would be unfortunate as all that serves is a self serving circular reward (oh you killed this boss? Here’s an item to kill him faster now, forget about PvP use, forget about training use, forget about most other uses). But I also understand you can’t introduce a purely level scaling items like the classic armor and weapon series, as by that metric, level 90 fears accuracy would smack everyone in PvP to oblivion regardless of defense level (though this has solutions with respect to armor and such other complimentary things like passive effects in the same way Torva sets increased max HP back in RS2). And we see hints of that with with Justiciar’s Divine Spirt Shield-like defense. 
---
Basically.. I’m simply just extremely curious for now over a decade to see how they tackle the issue with higher level gear that never existed back in the day. We still have Torva-lvl-80-type gear that can release. But my main curiosity is how they handle the gear that comes after that. I see the design restrictions that make this a challenge for them, but in the same way people like seeing talented folks perform their latest display, this is what I hope they do themselves for this game.
---
box pls
---
Lel just runecraft
---
he was just sitting there for like 2 minutes when i came afk
---
Aw thanks a lot, it feels like making a sculpture with modeling clay but you're presented with Play-Do models for reference.
---
The death immediately after it is way funnier imo
---
Haha, yeah it always surprises me.  Still good tech and can play most current gen games at 1080 low graphics at 40-80 frames.  Not great but for the price it's usable.
---
It only increases run energy when you are standing still or walking, so you can replace it with other weight reduction gear that is significantly easier to get with the same effect and simply use staminas. There's a few situations when graceful is needed but not as many as people think. For example graceful is useless when training agility or something similar where you are constantly running like runecrafting.
---
Question
---
I've never played rs
---
Should I?
---
I keep checking the GE and can’t find the garlic hammer. Is this an untradable from another quest?
---
All you need to do is make a Runelite account and be logged in when you kill the stuff.
---
I wish!
---
I feel ur pain! Good learning lesson, just a shame for it to go to a scammer.
---
you learn to enjoy the 0s because they make the 73s sweeter
---
Looks better now. Seems like a block to me!
---
It's taking advantage of carelessness, which in itself is a skull trick. It's one that deserves to be there though and anyone willing to fall for it has nobody to blame but themselves.
---
I've done a decent amount of Obor on an area-locked account that had basically f2p gear. I used water blast, basic magic gear (zammy robes, elemental staff), prayed protect from range &amp; used Snare to trap him. You get 2 casts per snare &amp; then you need to move and cast Snare again; you can eat whilst running to stay high HP.
---
Snare is still members atm tho so you'd have to use Bind which only freezes him for 5 seconds. The main advantage of using mage over range is the better accuracy when casting Bind/Snare. Obor's got low mage level &amp; mage def tho so shouldn't be too much of an issue. Perhaps you could try not using vambs so your mage penalty wouldn't be as high?
---
see you in fally bois

they ban like 50k bots a week...

Fuck man as someone currently tryna get this pet. Fuck you
---
 Congrats and all but fuck man. 500 KC on fanatic and just hit 155 on elemental. Hoping RNG blesses me soon
---
Thank you for your kind words, good to see another person who cares about the future of the game :)
---
I can try to Explain to you how i Forged this idea:
---
First, i analysed the Whole Warding "Shenanigan" to try and find what caused it to fail, it became pretty clear that if you take out the part that votes no on anything that resembles a new skill, Warding Failed because of it's Training Mechanics- it was just too boring and familiar, but the Majority of the people agreed that the Rewards Warding Proposed are Healthy to the game and much needed.
---
I decided to look back at Runescape's history to try and locate  a piece of content that was the opposite of Warding- Good gameplay mechanics but Bad Rewards, and i came across Dungeoneering, which not only was my favorite skill, but also a skill that i've seen many requesting to be implemented to Osrs.
---
I decided to try and take the Best Aspects of Warding and Dungeoneering and merge them, while throwing away the Bad aspects of both, i took  the training mechanics of Dungeoneering, while leaving behind the Reward system which made it feel like a minigame, and took the Rewards from Warding , while leaving behind the Training mechanics which made it feel to similar to other productions skills.
---
i'd suggest that you try to Analyse what went wrong with Warding, and try to cut the bad parts, while leaving behind the good parts.
---
If you need more help or someone to discuss the concept with, i'm here :)
---
What do you mean boss tasks excluding bosses? Are you talking about hellhounds, smoke devil's, hydras and such? In that case no I think normal hydras are better. But even you have a semi high level Slayer level I would rather do kurasks or nechs or black demons than gargoyles.
---
When I reach a level that gets me new gear I tend to give my current gear away to someone else. I think gifting is cool and yeah sometimes you get a fake asshole scamming you but often it's just a dude who's super stoked.
---
Damn
---
While I don't necessarily think people should use the term freely because it is quite annoying seeing people describe wanting organization and then saying they are SO OCD OMG. I think the best way to stop people from using the term is to just stop enabling it with responses either positive or negative.
---
Obviously there is varying degrees to this condition but it genuinely does ruin the livelihood of some people due to the "obsessive" traits they have. To better answer your actual question, it is OCD when you physically cannot ignore something and have to constantly think about it (eg. "I hope I locked that door." And proceed to constantly re check over and over endlessly even though you know you already did it.) as a kind of tldr version of the disorder.
---
Though I can see why some people show negative reactions to these types of posts, it's quite clear that no one who uses this term is trying to down play the disorder but rather just want to be seen as quirky (aka annoying, thus why I think ignoring such statements is appropriate lol). And here I am replying to such a thread anyways... haha
---
Just got my slayer helm and dragon defender, as well as finished all prereqs for rfd.
---
Planning on doing rfd next to unlock barrows gloves and rock cakes.
---
Gonna use rock cakes with absorptions to afk nmz to get my attack, strength, and def to 70. Spend all my points to imbue my slayer helm, then the rings that I have. 
---
Going to go back to slayer then, and get my range up. 
---
When I need a break from nmz or slayer, I’ll be mining and crafting to finish up those prereqs for lunar diplomacy, and do that quest.
---
After this stuff, I’ll have access to barrows gear, ancient and lunar spells, bis slayer head gear, and bis rings.
---
Hoping that after this, I’ll be ready to start bossing and hopefully pking.
---
Any suggestions for me to do either before these goals, or after? This is my one and only account (aside from the one I had 12+ years ago), so I’m pretty new to this.
---
Guaranteed replies
---
Figma, an Awesome free program that is surprisingly very easy to use!
---
I like this conceptually, but i agree this feels much more like a minigame than a skill.
---
The idea of having to use many different skills and make your own armor as you go through a gauntlet is cool as hell though.
---
I think this concept could really work as a type of raid content that is more skilling and team focused that you could get into much earlier.
---
I was for warding to begin with, so I'm biased. This could bridge that gap between the people that didn't like the "magic crafting" skill warding was with those that wanted a new unique skill. I like the direction this idea is going! You could probably fit some really cool and rare uniques in the ruins for more incentive.
---
Also offering help if you ever need
---
It's fun and not too difficult to avoid small teams. Big ones no chance though
---
&gt; However I use the Bonecrucher necklace, which means I don't have the bone count.
---
Bonecrusher only crushes 100% drop bones, not bones that were an extra drop. So that's not needed, you can get that from the amount killed and it doesn't really add anything to the wiki.
---
What a terrible idea from another backseat Reddit Dev, I've had it with these 1500 total level players fresh from their Birthday Bond DFS purchasing suggesting idea to my beloved game
---
Thanks alot friend!
---
oh youre right im dumb as fuck
---
im a new btw
---
Small alch icon is broken
---
Good goals to have would be easy and medium diaries, they will average your skills all around and provide relatively good rewards and exp lamps. 
---
I would highly recommend getting that farming up ASAP, because you do not need to be present or logged in during the growth process and at lvl 32 you can do ranarr herb runs to make decent GP to maintain supplies for your upcoming slayer levels. 
---
Birdhouse runs (through hunter) can also be very beneficial for long term GP.
---
But overall your skills seem well rounded.
---
2013 👀👀👀
---
No, I think OP means literally use your pet as a sword itself not have it fight with you
---
Depending on your level of commitment I'd probably go with the laptop. 
---
The tablet/mobile version is great when your on the go, but I found it uncomfortable after a while and soon reverted back to playing it on the laptop. If your planning on putting in 4-5 hour sessions then I'd go with a laptop rather than the mobile version. 
---
I also found it a little buggy with certain things, clicking the text box often involves your guy running off in that direction, but I was playing on my phone not on a tablet and perhaps a bigger screen would resolve that a little.
---
Story wise it doesn't make much sense why SotE would unlock Zulrah. To my understanding the cultists that worship Zulrah have nothing to do with the elves (shit they have more to do with Dragon Slayer 2  due to Zulrah being a Dragonkin experiment).
---
Blowpipe, salve ei, void (get elite void as your first upgrade) God dhide boots to pegasian boots as your next, rigour as your third, dhcb and Dragonfire ward as your last upgrade. Not sure if bgs is worth getting as I've never done vorkath with blowpipe

Almost the opposite of real cats tbh, I had 1 cat and it was by far the lowest maintenance pet I've ever owned.

Got a patreon?
---
My note9 doesn't have any issues with the game at 60 fps heat wise. Battery though it fucking gulps that shit down
---
It's not even training wheels in most cases though. Sure while they do help, they don't make tasks any easier to do other than a select few things like Jad. They're primarily used for the overlays, which just makes it easier to see things like for example drops, and it's nice to be able to see the xp per hour that you're getting using a method so it helps a little with efficiency or if you're OCD about that kind of things. The way you make it sound it's as if it gives some huge benefit over people that don't use it, which most of the time that simply isn't the case.
---
Are you the guy from Mudkips stream yesterday?
---
Dude that’s a disgusting crystal count.....
---
Same, I wanna get the original source, size it up a bit, slap that baby on canvas and hang it on my wall and upset my girl with it because she obviously can't appreciate real art.
---
Damn took you no time at all, I've been playing for a few years and only have the grandmasters and some other smaller quests done.
---
That's like the definition of QoL. All the clue solutions are known. What's the difference between my client looking up the solution and me manually looking up the solution?
---
True
---
The thing is we have to base our kill count on something, so we have to approximate sometimes if bones are being auto buried. RuneLite doesn't track those as a drop.
---
However I'm not telling people to not use their bonecrusher, but there is that issue with RL data currently.
---
Whats the black dragon head item on the left side?
---
Thanks for the Support!
---
&gt; You could probably fit some really cool and rare uniques in the ruins for more incentive.

---
I did 80-99 mining all at pvp world MLM, it's usually pretty empty, so more AFK mining. And if you die (which happens rarely), you're back in 20 seconds with 0 gp lost.
---
repairing is less work than busy worlds MLM where you gotta run a lot for new veins.
---
u/b00rad13y is correct with their response. Although it's ignorant to say that just because you don't care when people misuse the term OCD doesn't mean other people shouldn't care. Misconceptions of mental disorders creates uneducated ignorant generalizations of them. What your saying basically is that it's okay to call a depressed person sad because that is the jist of it. This type of thinking will lead people to believe that they are just constantly sad and not get the proper treatment they need or simply misdiagnosising themselves. We should encourage educating each other rather than putting each other down, or building each other up for using the wrong words to describe something.
---
I get what your saying though. People who get angry at others for using the wrong definitions to describe something are just as bad. That why I said in my original comment that I was just trying to educate. Not put down.

Hm, I wonder why they don't use that then
---
nice merch

Thoughts on creating a skill that is centred around creating only personal weapons (Forging) where you start out with simple hilts / stems / sticks, and have to add pieces from other weapons (effectively creating an item sick) which allows players to self craft unique bis items, for example adding string of twisted (this would consume a twisted bow) to your personal bow, giving it the magic amplifying effect (this being the only tier 70 ranged bonus u could add to the bow you are forging and locking you out of other paths)

---
It's 1/256 per roll for a unique on the wiki. Ergo (1/256)^2 = 1/65,536.
---
Basically the minority who votes no on every skill is very, very minor, Probably About 5%, and they keep taking credit of the people who vote no on a skill just because they don't like **that** specific skill, and making themselves look bigger.

So we always see content from the player base in regards to how the community wants future content to look like or contain. Things like new skills, bosses and areas. What I’d be interested in, is knowing what the OSRS staff see for the future of the game. There has to have been a few ideas you guys would like to implement and add, that isn’t proposed due to the potential backlash from the community. More lore, skill additions (current or new) etc.
---
Honestly mate, as much as you can trust a fella on the Internet... I promise you on my wife, my dog and my family - it is the hand to gods honest truth.

I don't think it needs new rotations, bots can easily fix scripts but these aren't bots anyways they are gold farmers like you said. There is nothing wrong with locking stuff behind high level reqs, there should be a large time investment to get to these bosses.
---
Stand at the GE and spam reeeeeeeeee
---
Both are banned. But as Weath discusses in the full reply, it isn't as easy to ban Goldfarmers since he can't just ban them because they look like they will later break rules and sell gold.
---
I'd like to hear the story about how People ruined the game for you, it sounds very sad :( what do you do with all your free time now? Troll on the internet?
---
Just an fyi, prayer flicking doesn’t work by just flicking it on and off as fast as you can. If you’re doing it to defend then it should be active on the tick your opponent makes their attack, and inactive on the ticks in between, and if you’re doing for offence then it should be active the same tick that you attack.

If you need any help in game add 'ffs lag' :)
---
You got me. How about every other boss in the game? Do they all have such deep and intricate lore explanations for why you can fight them over and over? Call me crazy but I think they might have just added that line of dialogue to justify it being a boss you can fight over and over again...
---
Pretty sure that if that was the skill req most Artisian, Sailing and Warding would've already been a  part of the game

Raids

This is amazing
---
Bro i'd pay good money for a full desk mousepad of this
---
Probably to not make it so easy to just spam click and get the best items, or maybe just afraid of changing it in general. You don't really mess up with the PK community you know, maybe Jagex just doesn't want to change what isn't broken.
---
wasn't necessarily implying he is lying, just that there is missing information
---
And once again someone wanting to be spoonfed and speaking out of their neck. Try actually looking it up. Same reason they removed custom plugin importing because the features they stated would not be tolerated could still be added by users and they basically said in the past if they didn't obey, it would be considered a cheat client and would be pushed to their legal team. A simple Google search or just following along their discord can be amazing to help prevent looking dumb.

Can't obtain a max cape without 99 Cooking. Go for it my dude. My only 99s are Cooking and Fletching.
---
I want that mug!
---
This is fucking good.
---
I have cape on two accounts, one with max stats (acb) and a lv 109 (tbow)
---
You’re still a way off from having a decent chance of completing inferno due to your stats. 99 ranged and 94+ mage are a must if you’re planning to use acb.
---
As for a non tbow gear for a first timer, you need these items at the very least:
---
Kodai (Extra inventory spot saved due to water runes)
---
SGS (You’re going to be using this a lot to regain hp/prayer)
---
ACB (On long range, has the max 10 tiles range which is needed to shoot jad on wave 69 from the West safespot)
---
Ava’s Assembler (Ranged strength and saves you a lot of money in dragon darts)
---
Armadyl top/bottom or Karil’s
---
Justiciar faceguard or Verac’s helm
---
Anguish
---
Occult
---
Crystal Shield
---
Blowpipe with rune or dragon darts (Once you can consistently get to wave 69 with 6+ brews and restores use dragon as every bit of dps against healers helps)
---
Nice to have, only if you can afford the above and still get
---
Elysian
---
Imbued heart
---
Justiciar top/bottom (You’ll use brimstone boots or eternal boots instead of pegasians if you use these. Luxury items, you can camp armadyl/karil’s entire run and have two more pots)
---
You don’t need ahrim’s or ancestral to freeze, you can wear justiciar or armadyl.
---
Good luck, I’d suggest grinding our 99 ranged, 94  mage and getting enough gp to afford the gear mentioned above in addition to your ely.

Nope, permanent.

Nice a grammar Nazi even more of a reason to put the dunce cap on. Go read all the rs storie lines

The no lie part was just for added info, tbh deleting the post. I don't think anyone's gunna make sense of it
---
Then its not for rwting but hacking. They dont perm ban for rwting from my understanding.
---
No no. The rule jagex goes by is: "Does the PvP community want this change? If yes then we take away the wildy instead. If no then make the change."

I don't think any pvper would fight this change.

To be honest the way you did it makes it more impressive to me. I get the general gist of the explanation, but beats me what the hell kind of specifics it entails. Straight up drawing it might require more skill, but it would require fewer skills, and regular old painting is pretty straightforward.

I got back into it once I found out about mobile and I’m having a blast.
---
Jus finished a hard where I ran into 4 different players , no combat occured and nobody logged
---
Coconuts can be good money too.
---
Definately worth getting up.
---
If it makes you feel any better I got ahrims robetop on 29 :)
---
No that's in the ge and 27fps at vorkath
---
I've got a few hundred KC on my pure from when I was trying to go for the pet, even with 99 range + ACB + diamond bolts it's a serious dick and you go through 2 doses of stamina's per kill unless you get lucky.
---
If you're a low level you're better off at KBD or crazy archaeologist if you really want to do some bossing.
---
Calm down bwana
---
the amount of elite diarys i did just to get a few rc levels...
---
Found the pker
---
Reddit likes them because 500k gp/hr and afk is decent for a lot of lower leveled accounts.
---
Although Grotesque Guardians is probably the best boss slayer xp/hr in the game... it's 1451 xp per kill and at 25-30 kph you can get almost 40k slayer xp/hr
---
You do you man that's terrible performance lol
---
Took me to 78 on my pure then got another on 83
---
I definitely see where you're coming from! Someone suggested a permanent amulet of chemistry effect. Amulet of Chemistry give you a 5% chance to make a 4-dose instead of a 3-dose. Each time this effect activates, it uses up a charge, and the amulet disappears after 5 charges. Giving the herblore cape that effect permanently would be pretty neat I think. 
---
&gt; Even with the (4) dose potions, the player can only make about a third of the money back 
---
Consider prayer potions. Ranarr pot (unf) + snape grass is \~8k. Prayer potion (4) is about 9800gp, Prayer potion (3) is about 7300gp. So it goes from a 700gp loss, to an 1800 gp gain, a 2500 gp swing. According to the wiki you can make about 3400 potions per hour, which would make this a 6.1 mil/hr moneymaking method (and a swing of 8.5mil, since normally you'd lose \~2.4mil/hr), all while bankstanding. Currently according to the wiki, the best bankstanding moneymaking method is making unfinished snapdragon potions, which gives about \~550k/hr, and gives no xp. Obviously all of these prices would go completely out of whack if something like this was implemented, but you see my point.
---
As far as comparing it to the cooking cape, the difference there is that by they time you reach 99 cooking, you mostly don't burn food anyway, especially if you're using the hosidius range. So while a change to never burning your food is nice, it doesn't really do much to swing cooking. Its already fine money and great xp, and with the cooking cape its slightly better in both respects.
---
Yeah when you’re logged in your on Jagex’s server, doesn’t matter how you get there.
---
Haha thank you for the observation. As someone else, and now you stated, I did it badly. Didn’t even start doing it until I believe 3 prayer left. It was my first time attempting to do it after hearing about it. I thought it was just spamming prayer but I was told otherwise. I can understand you suspicions but I appreciate your Gratz anyways.
---
Nope, inv order makes a slight difference but supplies are usually slated lower. Alch value is NOT the determining factor, not even close
---
Lucky mf lol. Grats :P
---
Nonsense! Nothing to see here! This is not at all reflective of how welcoming our community is to new female players!!
---
You could try out giant mole with Dharok's, or maybe try to do some GWD with some friends. You definitely should try to solo GWD with those stats, you'd have a bad time.
---
Jagex really needs to buy out runelite or something, and make all alterations/other clients bannable, things like this are getting way too out of hand.
---
Yep!
---
I am in pain at this, I am so so dry of anything at sire
---
I just started for the first time last night. I skipped RuneScape all together when I was younger. Now I'm 30 and get to experience it
---
Nice work! Get those lips in!
---
Yeah? It’s also a free 2 play item/moneymaker.
---
Can people who have downloaded the game via the Windows client play with those using the Mac client? Just want to know before getting back in if I can play with my friends.
---
🥴
---
I'd noticed that too, you can also see the brine rat cave from keldagrim. The underground parts all seem very close to each other you can see some of the rune craft alters from some caves and from the other alters too.
---
Looks sick
---
It was just under 2 hours. Although I did spend around 20-30 minutes afk waiting on healing through rapid restore since I was down to one dose of brew left on wave before jad.
---
To be fair Gordon Ramsay was screaming at him for lamb sauce.
---
I made an excel spreadsheet, nice
---
Ok
---
By far one of my favorite spots. So incredible, you deserve all the eyes on this as possible.
---
You posted the same thing on two subreddits yesterday.
---
99% chance this is a scam where you give someone an account, they put bank on it, then you request it back.
---
Wow thanks for that fast reply 
---
Have not considered finding a group 
---
Giant mole is not an Option because I am nowhere close to the agility level for the diary and it is my least favourite skill to train
---
And if he moved to magics he could make 100k per hour
---
The best way to make money from woodcutting is picking up someone Elses teak logs and banking those.  That's pathetic.
---
Even as a pker there's nothing more satisfying than scoring a box while a huge clan is on your ass.
---
True didn't think of that, my banks only worth 8m maybe they couldn't be bothered
---
as in 0 hrs for runescape a week? because with 750m it doesn't actually take much effort to progress with small amounts of time, flipping and occasional raiding will be enough income, pking is fun and low time commitment, think about what if anything you like, or haven't even tried in this game, was it actually only about progress? If you aren't ever going to be able to enjoy runescape again, sell the gold, auction off the account, it's probably not equivalent to the time put in, but you can at least walk away with something, you have like a stack sittin around in virtual goods.
---
Meanwhile the poor iron green d hide noob at the g.e. probably be looting arrows.

Best OSRS art i've ever seen
---
one of the best pet drops in real life
---
People like you don't even realize that eoc was the biggest downfall of Rs3. Making things easier as a quality of life improvement will most likely never ruin the game. Shortcuts to obtain huge goals will. No more of the generic "escape will ruin the game BS pls"
---
He should play a role in a TV series like that! That would be pretty cool, seeing such a huge knight!
---
Understandable. And I’m not in that field so I don’t know how it works (how long it would take) but you think that you could hire two or three that can be trained. Wouldn’t the investment of time be worth it in the future? 
---
(Assuming they would be willing to stay for 5 years or so)
---
We all enjoyed dungeoneering, we just didn't want it as a skill.  
---
If dungeoneering is just a process to get to the skill we train, and a different skill at that... I think that just about solves the problems everyone had with dungeoneering.
---
Oh okay okay
---
Nice.
---
Your name peaks my curiosity swamp lady.
---
Have fun bud! Remember, as many nice people you may find in the community, they are outnumbered by scammers and other toxic kiddos. As a general rule, dont trust anyone, ever.
---
Maybe they should re-work the quest a bit so that in order to reach Lady Hefin (the elf NPC who you reach by crossing the poison waste) you have to defeat Zulrah to cross all the stones. This ties Zulrah into the story and gives a reason to lock it behind the quest.
---
Again not relevant to the point he was making you're arguing to argue.
---
Used to use osbuddy client but stopped after all the controversy. Never felt comfortable putting my user and password into a 3rd party client anyhow, especially since the guy running it used to make bots from what I heard.
---
Been using the vanilla client now for ages. I do often see 3rd party client overlays for PvM that seem incredibly overpowered unfair to use, but I’d personally rather just learn to do it myself. There are a lot of quality of life updates that would be great. I think a clue scroll solver would be a fair addition for clues we have already solved in the past, like why do we need to solve them again if we know the answer. Some overlays like loot would be nice as well and I doubt it would be too hard for Jagex to impliment but I can only hope
---
You can just stand two tiles away from the Black Knight and kill him with a halberd
---
I love you, half_smoked-joint
---
You need 3 levels of dragonfire protection. If you’re using shield then you’re ranging. You use super extended anti and can protect range instead of mage. If you’re meleeing, I’d recommend a defender instead and protect mage with super extended
---
I think Jagex should add clue solutions if you’ve already done the clue before, I think that would be fair. It makes sense right? If you’ve done a specific clue already why would you need to figure it out again
---
Imagine that! Bond money for eternity
---
Well defense ia used for both magic and ranged as well, but Melee having and extra stat compared to the other two combat styles is silly.
---
Fun fact though, Magic used to be split into good and evil magic early in Classic iirc.
---
The main argument against a quest lock, from what I can gather, is that it hurts/interferes with legitimate players. An instance lock would interfere even more than a quest lock, same for basically any changes we make. It's inevitable, I think quest locks will interfere the least. I consider Zulrah high level content, but some people consider it mid level and if you consider it mid level I can see why a SOTE requirement seems drastic.
---
A certain someone would be really sad to see this ... It's the rune crossbow
---
Ahk was banned (meaning the most recent banning) because people kept pressing its uses and doing more automated things and non 1:1 things with it and didn't stop when jmods asked. Shift drop is arguably even better and is an official feature
---
WATERFALL QUEST.
---
I see. That's pretty neat. So as long as your ping is less than the length of a tick (which is absurdly long) PID will be the determining factor?
---
If I find myself consistently losing item pickup battles against specific bots, then would hopping off and back onto the world give me a new random PID, which I could do over and over until I'm the one winning those conflicts?
---
Well everything in Gaming can be bought haha
---
I genuinely want to know how this is made, the skill level here is amazing and makes me want to get into making art.
---
Make a super op amulet for pkers, but when you kill someone with a spade and a clue scroll in the inventory, you die instantly.
---
That's me!!
---
It's dark in there man
---
Saw that lol
---
In other news, I killed a bunch of fire giants and made shit money
---
With overhead prayers and tank gear ds2 and mm2 are hard as fuck for mid cb levels. That’s why even though the qpc combat requirement is technically only 85, most of the quest capes you see are on 100+ cb accounts. The bosses aren’t like mm1 dt and fight caves. At low levels you *have* to rely on flinch manipulation for mm2 bosses, and you have to hope for good ruby (e) rng to stand a chance against vork and galvek in ds2. DS2 would be impossible for a pure but mm2 has been done at ~30 prayer 30 def
---
Might aswell get barrows gloves then back to slayer, Good money and exp especially cause you have a slayer helm.

BeetFarmMose. Canada. Welcome to the family

We were very close to getting a new skill already twice, I truly believe that if Warding had Cool Training mechanics at least 9% of the no voter would've voted yes instead.
---
A new skill is possible.
---
Zulrah isn't a new player boss lol
---
He's just shedding his winter coat. Both bears and insects have an exoskeleton that must be molted as the organism grows.
---
Look at my second comment
---
This is the best thing i have ever seen.
---
Well can’t you make a triangular prism
---
I don't know when the first time I ever died was, but I remember the first time I died on OSRS.  I was like 90 something combat and I remember thinking several times "man how did I ever die on this game when I was a kid, this shit is so easy now".
---
Then I tried to do an elite clue step in multi-combat.  Those wizards fucking DESTROYED me before I even realized I was in danger.
---
Wut
---
Yeaa... I thought i played old RS when I actually played rs3 when it just got released. It wasn't that different from old RS then.
---
You go Wilderness you bad.
---
Could you please make one with kq and zulrah?
---
M'lumby
---
Love Rargh and Link
---
1-10 how fun is it pking someone in 10k worth of gear who's doing a clue scroll step and won't even fight back?
---
This guy is something else
---
Glad to hear it! Mobile was one of the best things to happen to the game for sure.
---
Awesome.
---
I saw it. You're still wrong. Zulrah isn't a new to pvm boss. Thats why Sarachnis was made.
---
Yeah the tickets take forever to get. Max of 60/hr. ~~You can get them in the northeast hut in the town of brimhaven in northwest karamja has a ladder that goes underground (youll need to pay the pirate only several hundred coins to get in). It takes you to a 5x5 block agility course. you traverse the obstacles to get to the pillar with the yellow arrow pointing to it. This pillar changes every minute. Touching consecutive correct pillars awards you with 1 agility arena ticket each. Obstacles have different level requirements upto 60. The tickets can be brought back upstairs and exchanged for herbs, a pirate's hook worth around 5m iirc, a recolor of a currently owned graceful set to match the skillcape, or varying amounts of agility xp. Trading in more tickets at once awards more xp. You also get more xp depending on your agility level and your karamja diary completion which can also award you with extra agility arena tickets upon touching a pillar. There can be a lot of down time between pillars so you can either bring alchables, anything stackable, or continuously do a nearby obstacle for extra agility efficiency. Iirc, this place can be the best agility xp in game if done correctly and continuously training.~~ &lt;b&gt;just take 5 seconds of googling to pull up the wiki&lt;/b&gt;
---
Technically of depends on if your talking pigment or light... combination of all color pigments = black, Combination of all colored light = white.

But it's not a reward

in order to better secure my account i went ahead and made a new email strictly for this.  i know that the log in will never change however when i changed it, it is still sending emails to my old email.

does it just take time to become effective or what's up with that?   I've had multiple fishing attempts for fake websites trying to get me to change my password and want to lock this down.
---
This is awesome, keep up the great and also funny art!! :D
---
Now THIS is RuneScape.
---
Here’s how to figure out your block list:
---
1. Go to wiki page for whatever slayer master you’re using
---
2. Sort tasks by weighting
---
3. Block whichever ones you don’t want to do, starting at the top. 
---
4. Use your points to skip the tasks with lower weighting that you would’ve otherwise blocked.
---
Yep. And it wasn't always this way. Back in the day, mystic top protected over whip :).
---
I actually just finished season 5 a few weeks ago. I can't push myself to watch the rest of it, since everybody says the last 3 seasons are bad. Do you think I should continue watching, or is it really not worth it?
---
Did they add this training room again recently?
---
^is BS. PMd and is trying to talk me out of it.
---
Nobody buries bones outside of free to play, left click use bones is a QOL update that should have occurred everywhere on members servers. It's people like you who make construction so horrible to train by insisting "remove door" be right click while in building mode.
---
Just because something makes less clicking is not "insane" or "OP", it's something jagex refuses to implement because they either don't care, or they have the same bizarre elitist viewpoint of "If I suffered doing it, you do too". 
---
God bless runelite for making prayer training tolerable, I've done 99 prayer on 2.5 accounts and burying bones on accident sucks balls.
---
Zulrah was my second? A lot of people I know try Zulrah when they go bossing for the first few times ? But if you want to keep locking old stuff behind new content be my guest
---
Did he shoes come off
---
Lmfao something about this with the call center woman’s face on the side is so funny
---
D claws are lower than supplies in inv as well as in loot pile
---
Totally down to you. It's still good TV but not as groundbreaking as the first 5 seasons.
---
Personally I'd watch it for the closure.
---
These aren’t classes they are combat styles. What type of combat do you see beyond melee/range/mage that fits into medieval combat?
---
How lol
---
Obligatory Herblore Cape is OP for POH tools comment for IronMEMES.
---
Its the only way to have a pestle and mortar in your house. Also BIS skillcape for ULTIMEMES to show off their Masochism.
---
Might as well add some GP for straight GP exchange, it's just QoL right?
---
sorry if i made it tough to follow :) not too bright myself so just offering experience

Why the fuck did this make me laugh.
---
We shall see what the outcome is this time

Says the guy sweating in his gamer chair over runecrafting, right?
---
Best fan art of runescape I've ever seen in 15 years of playing osrs.. and I seen a lot of good fan art..
---
Fuck the last guy who took half the fuckin line to himself
---
Yes because the skill icon looks peng ting
---
They typically do 4 accounts from what I've seen
---
Motherlode mine(its essentially the AFK way to do mining) and Recipe For Disaster quest.  Which gives the best* gloves in the game and is a mid level goal most people work towards when they first make an account since it gives you a little bit of direction and sense of working towards something.
---
Cooking and fletching both proffit going to 99
---
Mah im good
---
It's similar, because you collect Magical Energy which is similar to what you do With Divination, but the mechanics are extremely different, and you create Magical Armour and Equipment instead of Tweaking Other items.
---
Good job buddy
---
vork is locked behind ds2, gorillas are locked behind mm2, i see no issue with locking vork behind sote.
---
Revs is a solid 3-4.5m an hour for me. That’s with rigour and craws with the agility shortcut. I find it more relaxing than Zulrah or vorkath.
---
Not going to suggest a pet idea? Just the chance of one. Nice.

If you ever bring out big enough risk most teams have a dedicated cannon account that stays logged out at chins full time and multiple people know the password to. At that point your best bet is just to run south or try and juke em at GWD.

Outcome last time was very positive, and this one is aswell :)

---
Downvoted to hell again, just mute yourself.
---
Yes it will help. With dhcb and 99 range it won't extend trips (the limit is inventory space either way).
---
Gargoyles, wyverns, brutal black dragons, and rune dragons are probably the ones worth considering.
---
No this is the actual inferno
---
So 10% are bots? That's still a lot.
---
Can Vorketh be botted?
---
Speak for yourself!
---
kill yourself if you leave
---
A lot of people are saying quest but i say make enough money for your next bond. Once you get mems, making money for bonds is too easy to be going back to f2p and doing that shit again

There are two rolls per kill though.

Saving my marks until then. Fuck agility.
---
Well to be fair, this isn't so much a question of 'making' a shield as it is fixing something with compromised structural integrity.

A whole toothpick is a lot stronger than a toothpick broken in half and then taped together.  You don't have to know blacksmithing to understand basic structural concepts.
---
Anyone know how close to the max rate 165k/hr is at prif red chins at 91 hunter? I'm not sure if it's my mistakes with bark and knife/log lowering my rate or if it's the fact that I'm not 99 hunter. There are a fair number of traps that fail to catch the chins, and I've noticed that when the traps don't fail the rate is closer to 190-200k, but that's obviously just small snapshots.
---
It was at -7 earlier and went up to -4 and back to -5. Finally hit -2 whenever you got here so... and yes I thanked the two serious answers so? You don’t know true whole story don’t think you do just because you like the sub doesn’t mean it’s not toxic when it wants to be.

thanks for trying to argue with them. you are completetly right in that Vorkath is not being botted due to the requirements. 
---
You can write a script for every PvE Boss and Vorkath is  far from the difficulty of raids /inferno.
---
Problems? Judging by the title I think he means he would much rather play RS than have a girlfriend. Nothing wrong with that.
---
Okay, sorry to hear :)
---
Are you sure you're not super upset over runecrafting? It sounds like it.
---
How about no. The older a boss gets the more the profits decline. That's how its been and always will be.

You are special :)

World 322 out of coincidence but I'd be happy if I picked accident memes. I wanted a world with 69 in it but there wasn't a good one.

I hear dharoks is sub optimal prior to 90 hp, full obby with zerker neck and obby sword best til then (for low def mobs like nmz)

Eh, "Stayin' Alive" is still perfectly functional, as people are pointing out. Don't worry about which song you're using as long as it works for you in the moment :)

there are plenty of people that go really dry for 1/5k drops, why the fook would you be an exception to change the way drops are managed. keep grinding like the rest of use and stop complaining. have a nice day :)
---
Jagex fucks up all the time, but come on, diconnecting people when using an ability? Did they at least do a rollback, or was everyone who died to that just forced to pay death the fee and move on?
---
Not sure why this is downvoted, bludgeon and dagger are the best options if training on higher def mobs outside crabs or nmz

Advice on mid-level goals? Been playing for around 2 months and have reached a point where basically all of early game goals are out of the way (see pictures below). Any advice on where to go from here? Thanks!

"A lot of legit players" can you back that statement? The only legit players I see at zulrah are far above/ very close to SOTE reqs. 
---
Or are you suggesting full ancestral / TBOW armadyll is harder to achieve than 70 in a few stats? To me it feels like a lot of low level players are skipping on zulrah until they feel more confident // or at the very least im very unlucky in not seeing them during my zulrah trips.

They'd be ok in WoW because it's a different aspect. This is essentially just timers, but in RS the difficulty in this is timing the prayer flicking, in WoW the difficulty would be executing the mechanics.
---
What’s pog? Thank you! Grinding strength right now. Just trying to get buff
---
Omg, this is badass.
---
i dont see why zulrah should not be on equal terms to Vorkath. Zulrah seems more difficult/ click intense to me. Kill times are roughly the same. Rewards used to be roughly the same too.
---
I wish they would add stuff from the 3rd party clients to the vanilla one
---
Divine super combats are basically guaranteed certain value now whereas the expected value of the crystal chest is lower than that. Maybe you're lucky with the chest though.
---

Haha yeah 322 is what people spam in dota when they think someone is throwing a game

Allow Ironmen to purchase bonds from the grand exchange.
---
They can't trade them, and they're a use for an ironman's accumulated gold. You can already use bonds on ironmen to give them membership.

Trident is A LOT more dps than iban.
---
I mean, little weird to target them specifically. Rageb8? I can’t tell anymore tbh.
---
Tbh I love this idea. I get the idea of not necessarily being punitive to someone who doesn't have one of the mutagens, but exchanging mutagens + scales for the other mutagen. Would definitely be a passive scale sink. u/dreadwraith8d made a really good point with us needing a scale sink with all the bots. I rememeber when scales were 200+ gold a piece, now they're like 160.
