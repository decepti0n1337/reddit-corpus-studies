Looks like you got Reddit behind you, so you'll be fine.

If you don't have Reddit Upvotes or a large Twitter following, you're fucked.
---
Yea wtf us that stream
---
ALSO ADD HORSES
---
Please find the nearest fire and nature runes and alch yourself. Jesus christ that was the most fedora wearing neckbeard shit I've ever read my whole life. 
---
Holy shit i need to see this, is there anyway to rewatch it?
---
Thanks for being a dick, in advance
---
Drop the shitty seeds, and from now on when you open seed packs turn on bank fillers then deposit all and drop the shitty seeds again
---
&gt;They only get leaked by using them on different websites.
---
Which a massive amount of people do. 
---
I doubt it's just coincidental that the amount of "I've been hacked" posts has been higher than normal over the last handful of months after a huge leak happened.
---
Guys I gave someone my money. He said he would double it and the. He took it. He’s a big liar. Can I make him give my money back???
---
Ahh totally forgot to check on mobile, thanks again tho fam

New Afriend drama? Where can I find this?

---
A dysfunctional relationship reaching breaking point, live on stream.
---
Did you take this through a screen door or something?
---
Wow, I don't know even half of these countries existed until now.
---
no its real ads would never lie to you.. SIKE!
---
Check with the people who manage your Internet if the domain or port (43594 AFAIK) is blocked
---
Imagine being this triggered by a joke between two people. You ok, man? Who hurt you?
---
i love how this guy's viewer/follower count shot up, wholesome boys
---
99 str req. you’re not the chosen king, you’re just really fucking strong 
---
I hate it for pking. I reg play with chat closed and when chat is open, I see lower fps. Having to close it is just a nuisance when you're suddenly in a fight.
---
WISH I COULD'VE GONE WITH RYAN ON THAT COOL RETREAT!
---
Grats!

You can 1 tick people your level from full
---
im at night auditor at a hotel. So i work overnight i do like 3hrs of work and the rest is customer service but no one shows up from 2am-5am so i get to have some fun
---
"I'll just finish this clue and then I'll end the stream"
---
Congrats man! You got the pet?
---
 Congratulations! That is a decent chunk of change to get you going. 
---
What happend to him?
---
**back by popular demand!**
---
Tonight at the blue moon inn I’ll be hosting a joke contest. Participants will tell one joke each, ill pick the best two for a final joke off, and the crowd votes for a final winner who gets 1m gp!
---
**If you weren’t there last time here’s the rules:**
---
When I call your name step up next to me near the bar and tell one joke. Any jokes told out of turn won’t be counted.
---
Everyone will get a turn to say their joke so keep the chat to a lol or haha when other people are doing theirs. Just so we all get a chance to type a setup and punchline.
---
If you want to tell a joke talk to me in game before the show, simple as that! Also if you just wanna hear some jokes come out and help vote for a winner.
---
After the contest we tell some more jokes and drink some beer. Thanks to everyone who came last time and gave me a donation! They’re always appreciated. Last time we had a matching donor so the winner of the contest got another 1m gp on top of the prize money!
---
If you have any suggestions, especially if you came to the last one, reply to this and let me know.
---
East green dragons have 5+ bots with 100+ combat on every world. Revs, chins and some shops are full of venezuelans farming gold to RWT. Jagex doesn't care.
---
I did it for a couple hours and made about 2m.  But people bot so they are on 24/7. Fuckin bullshit man.  
---
Moms credit card. XD bossing with my clan allowed me to get some income and rev cave luck
---
it’s based on a lot of skills, not just firemaking 
---
Can I see a pic of the stats? I’m just curious 
---
What the fuck was he doing? Did he have another window open or something? ￼
---
Is that really worth it? If you even save any, you'll barely go even plus risk for ban
---
me and my arm are on talking terms getting better
---
YO WTF
---
D 
---
Wtf is going on holy shit, this is so fucking fun lmafo
---
Immortal golem mommy
---
thanks im like nervous feels like im going on a first date 
---
She told the police he hit her. Disgusting behaviour.
---
Thanks! Sadly no pet, maybe in the future though :)
---
Same, idk if you know where Greensburg is but I’m like 20 mins south from that, only thing we have is shitty weather
---
well that was something..
---
hell yeah! theyre trash! let me boot up and get some screens
---
you need to make friends with both arms dont be mean 
---
The police just showed up at his house 3 mins ago and the stream ended
---
This is a stretch to say the least. 
---
My manhood doesn’t seam to care though. 
---
nope, your feet very small
---
what a shame
---
she says he physically hurt her... wow this woman is crazy manipulative
---
ikr
---
It's a joke about how a friend has been streaming this clue step for hours but hes just bank standing and doing some kinda fake ass drama stream with his gf
---
That is not my email lol. That is a fake email the phisher used
---
Well good thing we live in 2019 and the entire argument was all while he was stationary in a chair streaming lmao.
---
i hate the grind of it!! but i do MLM so i might switch to iron 3tick method
---
Holy shit man, that's awful.  Best of luck to you.
---
Who is "she"? For those of us not watching a stream.
---
Just looked it up.  Guardians can mage but their magic level is one so it can only do 1 damage and they usually melee.
---
The walkers attack with crush based melee, leeches with slash based melee, and guardians with stab based melee.
---
what a dumb bitch, telling cops that dovy hit her...
---
He needed 700$ realllllly badly
---
Quirky enough to be a clue reward. I love it.
---
So i dont really understand mlm. The wiki says the sack limit is 81, but I can put 84 (3 full inv) in it. So am i losing 3 pay dirts when I put in 84?
---
Damn she called the cops and said he physically abused her.
---
He straight up lied to the officer that he wasn't recording anything while streaming to 17k people.
---
Hey it's me a friend, i just came back from smacking some bitches.
---
Then he lied about the stream to the cop... He should have said yes it's all recorded and you can watch the replay. But if he was smart none of this would be happening LUL
---
I did reported it in game. Found while doing dragon slayer 2.
---
Who is he speaking to over voice chat?
---
crazy bitch
---
His now-ex girlfriend
---
I hope someone has the vod before his gf deletes it.
---
In before nerf. 
---
Barely a she, his ogre of a "gf". 
---
He'll be fine, she told them he physically abused her yet he's got the whole 3 hours or so worth of footage to disprove everything she's said. She'll be in big trouble. 
---
smorc 
---
His girlfriend, he broke up with her yesterday and was badmouthing her on stream. 
---
i was going to do the same but then i realized how easy Zeah favours can be 
---
Dawn tha' hill
---
Jan has plastic boobs
---
How many red flags does he need before he leaves her behind completely...
---
gay mods stop white knighting and banning
---
Great rng! All in the wrong places
---
Olmlet though
---
I think he mentioned earlier that he didn't save any clips.
---
Well, that was the most intense OSRS stream I've ever seen. What a ride. I hope he gets out of that shitty situation somehow.
---
It all seemed so staged at first, I was sure he was doing it for attention. But now I have my doubts.. That was a real Dutch police officer.
---
Honestly this whole situation is uncomfortable and shouldn't be put on stream. I hope he was able to save the whole cast because she made false claims to the police that he was physical with her. What the heck. 
---
who can be this fucking stupid? everything that has happened today is on fucking film via twitch. god fucking damn
---
That slut should get hiv
---
Grats!!
---
Haha i saw you wcing before nice job :D 
---
She got some mental issues bruh.
---
It's not fake lol she called the cops, unless they are the best actors in the planet
---
I wonder if I’m ever gonna be that lucky.
---
Come be locked up Dovydas!

*clap FTFY

It was his brother in voice call?

Yeah seriously. I'd recommend pouring bleach directly onto the motherboard, usually works well. 
---
By saradomins light!
---
No.
---
This.
---
I’m sure there are some you can PAY
---
He should just have a counter for how many adderall's he's taken this stream instead of a timer. 
---
It was enstated without a poll for "integrity" reasons. Kinda bullshit how easy it is to abuse with false reports imo.
---
Is this not DMM? 
---
I
---
..no?
---
Exactly the kind of fake stunt he planned to get a following again. Seems to have worked so grats to the scum bag
---
I worked at Eat N Park in Belle Vernon, not the best customers lmao but it’s weird to finally experience someone online that knows about this area lol
---
So I thought I'd take a break post RFD of questing but I really want MM2 and DS2 done soon for the nice training areas and bosses eventually.
---
I'm 60 mage and 63 range currently. What's the best way to train magic to get some barrage level stats (smoke or otherwise?).
---
I'm guessing tele alchs? I just want a decent level so I can train it better when I unlock the new chin caves
---
Zmi is 4m/hr? Lol
---
If the community wants it....
---
I have heard several people state there is another way to brute force pins without hitting delays, but no one has ever explained that to me. 
---
I don’t blame you, not much going on but the new(ish) subway 
---
Does anyone have a link to the full video?
---
yo sick thx for the shoutout!!
---
Or maybe its because the alchemical hydra actually drops deaths and bloods 
---
surely this is bait, but ''pure'' europeans can be dark. I am Dutch, and i know some people who are naturally extremely tanned but are still caucasian. It happens. European and Aryan are not the same
---
You can't force a woman to get an abortion. You can't force a woman to give up a child so that you can take care of it on your own. That's not how the world works lad.

There already is one, she's called Fiona

Who has time to do free art lol
---

Now show us it’s butthole.

Catherby maybe. Camelot tele and run south east. iirc

Lol "free art" what are you going to do pay them in exposure?
---
Poe’s law hittin real hard here
---
I got sent this on discord by a friend of mine and didnt know someone already posted it on reddit so i went to find him to credit it
---
Underrated 
---
What in the actual fuck
---
Is there a link to the full video somewhere?
---
She said, while they were arguing, that she will call the police if he keeps mentioning her in his stream. What she didn't mention is that she will lie about physical abuse and try to press charges against him, I assume to increase the child support and use the sexist law in Netherlands to anally probe and abuse him.
---
That's awesome man. I'm happy to see a post of 1kc that has to do with doing something(at least with experience considered) well vs just getting some rng roll
---
Damn 1m gp
---
You could literally circle any one of them fingers lol
---
trust in a friend restored
---
There is alot of confusion because most people just go by what they've been told instead of actually reading and researching the actual law itself. I thought for many years it was within 4 years of age 16 but again this is Michigan and if your 16 you can have sex with anybody basically.. EXCEPT authority figures (teachers, cops etc..) the age of consent in those cases would be 18 or 21  years old (I cant l remember exactly and dont care enough to find out again). Varies state to state though
---
Right that phrasing was kinda scary lol
---
It looks really funny but they would have to create hundreds of new models to make all the normal ones for kids too. 
---
I’m from belle Vernon lol. This weather is confusing cause it don’t know what it wants to do.
---
Isn’t it just kind of annoying to have to switch out barrows gloves every kill? I mean I see the value in them but lots of tasks I like to afk
---
Bro, I still get onion tasks and I have 70 farming. I hoard every seed.
---
In 80 kc I have a zenye, limbs, and spring :)
---
Tricks was meant to be a joke, no idea about a friend but tricks was hilarious.
---
Sounds familiar, I’m in westmoreland and all we have are druggies and shitty food
---
Nah mine looks pretty much the same.
---
103 kills:
---
1 tome
---
170
---
1 garb
---
3 gloves
---
3 torches
---
10/10 more air went through my nose than normal
---
Other than the literal fact the police were involved.
---
Here's the thing, this isn't something you can fake and not have the internet know about it, I'll assume it's legit until it's proven other wise... since it's so easy to prove it's fake.
---
Just a little gay
---
Most retarded thing I've read all year
---
Right dude and the winds earlier... Jesus 
---
Its a quality meme brother
---
Show me the clip where you actually see a police officer and I will believe it. All I saw was the shoulder of some random guy and a friend saying the cops were there
---
What happend? Where can i watch it??
---
Need your m'speak ammy and a banana bro.
---
cmonBruh
---
wouldn't give that bitch any kind of pie
---
Lmao, this thread just turned into Pennsylvanians talking about there state.  Gz op
---
Sure, but for those that want to get faster / slower tasks, it is really nice.
---
Your dks axe drops count under this tab

Quests for xp. Dragon defender, fighter torso, fire caps

I got a pestle and mortar for Christmas. Shit is so fire. 
---
Throw some garlic chilies limes and oil in there and makes some delicious food. It just feels so...natural. It’s cool as fuck and I definitely recommend. 
---
If you live in the US, usually TJ Maxx or similar places will have cheap pestle and mortars in their cookware section. 
---
Except she called the cops
---
Yeah I reported that over a month ago but it's probably not an easy fix.
---
I'm not sure if I'm more embarrassed by them airing their dirty laundry for everyone to see, or this community stooping as low as finding it entertaining. 
---
LMAO

He fought with his girlfriend on stream for like 2 hours. She called the cops on him claiming he hit her and I think he was arrested.
---
Yay, the guy with the neitiznot running past the furnace is me :D
---
Wait... People still support this dood?
---
broke with this gf yesterday, had a fight on stream, she called the cops, she claims she physically hurt him, he didn't it was all on stream.. bitch should go to jail for filing a false police report. Cops are talking to dovy right now. But he is clueless. might go to jail. Stream is still going on, he's going back live when the cops leave.
---
Won’t it be on camera that her claim is false
---
These are happening too often now. You should really cut it down to once a month otherwise this is gonna die fast 
---
The value is in its status symbol as an incredibly rare 'item'. 
---
Still pretty windy currently lmao
---
It may be just me, but is anyone else getting the same vibe as Bloodborne's Kirkhammer from this image?
---
Personally, I would alch to 70, just start mm2 to unlock the cave, then ice burst in there for very fast xp. It’s also the best place to chin if you want fast range levels but personally I’d just do that through slayer. Up to you
---
Jeez just get a cat or somethin 
---
Barb fish until guild. 
---
But Jagex don't work the weekend, so "It's been 3 days" is actually "It's been 1 working day"

Why are you doing easy contracts at 70 farming exactly?

u r only wasting ur own bank space

I'm an ironman. If I cant do the medium contract, I cant just go to GE to buy the seed.
---
U r not that bright.
---
it is perplexing to me how low IQ A Friend truly is
---
how has he made it this far in life?
---
Well yeah it's a parody it's supposed to sound retarded.
---
&gt;any form of feedback or logical thought. 
---
Is simply dropping junk from your bank really not an option? lol
---
Um obviously..? But also add variety to a place where there is literally no variety and where there is a missing "top tier" set whereas for 1 def Range and Mage there is Rangers and Elder Chaos Robes. Why wouldnt there be something there? And comparatively melee is the weakest for pures compared to higher defense accounts, it has the largest gap. You can still hit and do relatively close DPS and top end damage with range and mage as a pure compared to a defense account and yet they have these higher tier 1 def sets in Ranger and Elder Chaos. 
---
And the point here is what is the significance and impact of adding a mere +1 strength to pures? And the answer to that is the most marginal and minor buff possible to the point where its legitimately barely noticeable. Adding ONE STR BONUS literally doesnt even increase top end damage for a pure, AGS max in max gear will still be 72, D scim hit in max gear would still be 38 etc. If youre 99 str and not potted or praying, it doesnt give a max hit either, same if youre just potted. 
---
The **ONLY** time it makes literally **ANY** difference is if you are potted and praying from say 99 str to 118/99 and say your pot has ran out to 115/99, on SOME of those effective levels the +1 strength would end up preventing you from losing one max hit that you would have otherwise lost on that level if you didnt have the +1 strength.
---
So the addition of +1 strength legitimately has next to ZERO impact on pure DPS, its about as marginal as you can get and largely noticeable. Theyd still be by far the weakest and least melee dps/accuracy account to PvP on. People are acting like +1 strength is like fucking +10 str bonus, they dont realize that it would make a completely insignificant difference.

You can't force an abortion, but I'm pretty sure the courts can force a woman to give up a child. (Custody)

you think if the threshold was something like 2-4x the drop rate of the pet it would really result in a lot more ppl with the pet? im pretty sure the number of people with 10k+ kc on any boss is in the .01% of players.

We saw that shit coming too but nothing you can do

Oh shit, so video caught it? Damn

Finally, someone else who has seen A Christmas Story. For some reason no one I've ever run into has even heard of that film.

Hmm
---
OSRS streamer, streaming OSRS, for charity, doing kind things for his viewers. 
---
vs.
---
Attention hungry retard streaming scripted domestic violence, of which has nothing to do with OSRS.. on the OSRS subreddit.

Yeah idk I can’t figure it out either tbh. 
---
Once the mods build me a comedy club I’m doing five shows a weekend

Lol I own property in the Dunbar PA area. It is interesting there. 
---
what are u using that marks your items like that
---
Ahh I see, eh sorry I was thinking a desktop when you said that. But yeah I realize that now, and for a lot cheaper too. 
---
Sometimes more!
---
thats the charm
---
Ehhh, wouldn't be shocked if he wanted to stream it so there'd be some video evidence in case she claimed something that wasn't true 
---
I think you would have a bit more credibility if he were, say, in your clan.
---
IDK why he wouldn't end his stream. I get it you're a personality but come on and have some fucking class.
---
It wasn't funny in chat, it's not funny here.
---
shes literally laying down.
---
Hahaha that’s karma for a friend for taking all those shitty dicing sponsors 
---
Yeah it also got him a tons of views and his fan base back which is not a coincidence
---
It's passing

 Is it worth starting NMZ at 60 att, 56 str, 55 def? Should I train up to 60s so I can use obsidian?

At the end of the stream there was a officer in a police uniform. Pipe down

This is not bait. Most Europeans are light (especially in the north).
---
You get more tan and olive as you go south to places like Italy and Spain.
---
Although these areas have some intermixing with non-whites such as Arabs or north-africans (e.g. during Islamic control of iberian penensula). 
---
There are also darker gypsies, but this group is not European, they are originally from India. 
---
Generally Europeans are white.

Lmfao.

You can't fuck a cat. Go stargazing. Go to the movies. Spoon. Resturanting. Etc 
---
Does anyone have the VOD?
---
Putting his dick in that monstrosity was a questionable thing too.
---
Even if they didnt count as bank space, we'd technically have less bank spots. The issue isnt what is counted as an item or not, it's the fact that there can only be so many items in a bank total because lack of engine capability. This is why we are getting a separate bank for seeds, rather than more spaces.
---
I honestly dont know, I've been expecting a name change forever now. I wont be too upset when it happens lol
---
Yeah you saw a little bit of a shoulder of someone who looked like a police officer that is definitive proof right there lmao

What are some good uses for dragonstones on an ironman? At this point, I have way more than I will ever realistically need.

I already have the ornate jewellery box in my POH.

The only thing I can think of is either turn them into jewellery and alch them, or make a ton of glories so that I have to recharge them less often when runecrafting.

Any other ideas that I haven't thought of?

Np!

Go to your closest Asian style grocer. They have them and they're pretty cheap. Get a stone one rather than metal or wood.

It doesn't happen anywhere near 30% of the time like you're suggesting and also fixes itself after a minute. I wouldn't call it a "major bug" worth spamming threads over.

You're right. Im not sure you can even stay below 0kg when you're carrying all the ore
---
I want to suck you

he talking about you now lol

It’s true im in his clan

Yea I got upset when fucking blizzard changed my name on WoW. It was called FromLeButtox and I was a rogue. I still have it on another server on my 120 I don’t get it how they changed it on a level 90 but not on a 120.
---
Turns out he got it from facebook and the post from facebook was from a tweet and the tweet shared the link to OP so i thought i would share it too
---
Some of you guys should stop assuming people are bots. I personally have 4k+ alts and people accuse me of being one once a week when I'm far from one.

Indiana's consent law is definitely 16. There's also that Romeo and Juliet law, which applies to 14 and 15 year olds at minimum, that states  they can have a relationship with someone no more than 4 years older. We solved this mystery, now we know you can't bang a 13 year old if you're 18+. But just add 4 to 16 or 17 to see if you're eligible today to pound a minor. 
---
? You just said you hoard every seed.

Thats just dumb he was making rly good money through rs. Then he started sellout and calling people on rs the n word. 
---
Wait OSRS has more advanced combat than RS3? If it us complicated it does not mean it is bad, you just need to get used to the abilities.

if even not abortion, he should be able to completely remove himself from any sort of financial obligation the child brings on.
---
Oh true lol.
---
If I had to assume, based on the fact that she called the cops saying he hit her, it was for proof of innocence
---
It's unique to Konar because she doesn't assign Jad tasks like Duradel/Nieve.
---
Depends on how good you are at lasting against her for the whole task.  Or you can skip like you would Jad by entering her cave and leaving to reroll for a new one.
---
stake was not a rwt advertisement, it was a online crypto gambling advertisement. the reason he got perm banned was because he was comparing it to duel arena ingame, acting like duel arena was a online gambling service is a look jagex wants to stay far away from.

Dude relax 
---
Remeber 
---
Does anyone honestly believe he hit her? Lmfao. she was just sitting next to him all stream and then out of nowhere that accusation comes up.

ikr, i can't believe you'd say something so stupid

Why is everyone talking about A Friend? I want to enjoy the memery but am painfully out of the loop

I hope for him the stream is archived. That stuff is evidence  now.

In the Netherlands you're the dad whether the kid is yours or not (you become some legal term I can't quite recall.).

It's true, kids on this sub have no idea about anything outside of RuneScape
---
since we know the situation, it's easy to call her "that thing" but in reality relationships are based on how two people connect. Not by looks. If you haven't already seen, a friend isn't too much of a looker either (no offense to him). He says he was a 27 year old virgin and made a stupid decision to stay with her. Stupid decision in hindsight, but understandable from his pov

I loved FoG! I'd even be down for it to be incredibly shit xp, and just give meh rewards. I played the shit out of FoG back in the day.

---
as a runescape 3 player, piling up these types of distractions/diversions is going to make the game feel really weird to play
---
it's like how cache was introduced to make it so you could do something while training divination for some extra XP and in turn it made it so everyone just ditched the divination aspect and trains by doing cache. if the XP wasn't BIS it would mean nobody would do it.
---
if it's there purely for rewards (think hespori and the bottomless bucket) it would become a menial daily task, and when you get too many of these daily/weekly tasks, the game just feels like it's a bunch of chores
---
It wasn't rwt that was the problem imo.
---
First he took money from viewers, then gave most of it to a scammer. Then he took a sponsorship from a gambling company.

This is probably the best reaction I've ever seen

Well... she could have done  it with a little bit of tegridy..

 Meet A Friend, my Red Light District locked Hardcore Ironman. After recently impregnating my gf I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No loyalty, no trust, but this time I can't leave Netherland because of my pregnant girlfriend. All leading up to eventually taking on one of life's biggest challenges: taking care of another mans child.

Why would RS think using email is more secure than a username lol
---
The embarrassment...just turn on record
---
Same man, and I'm 170 dry since the axes lol. Might just give up
---
Buy a separate computer that only plays runescape. Never surf the internet or do anything else on this computer. When the computer is not in use, disconnect it from the internet or turn it off completely. Just to be safe, before every runescape session, run at least three different virus scanners.
---
If you have anyone besides you come within 5 feet of this computer, always search all USB slots and the keyboard wire(if wired) for physical keyloggers. Do a complete reformat of this computer once a month.
---
Do you mean bursting? Because ice burst is lvl 70 magic and enough to train slayer with. Bursting dust devils and nechraels is amazing slayer and magic xp and profitable.
---
As for training, I would do it through bursting slayer tasks and if you haven’t already done mage training arena for bones to peaches (required for lumbridge hard diary), then I would do that now. You’ll gain a cheeky level or two.
---
LEVEL 2
---
You beat me, got mine on my 4th.
---
Ok then get a dog
---
Look at all the downvotes from these so called “pro lifers” these are the same people who would let a baby live even if the father is not there/mother dies during childbirth. Lmao 
---
I bet you think the world is flat. If you're so suspicious why bother showing interest
---
Gz! I also got my first pizza cape today. I was so nervous
---
that's what his fanbase has always been lmao, how new are you 
---
There’s no way either of them cheated. I’m sure it would take both of them months to find someone desperate enough to cheat with. 
---
Definitely hasn’t always been like that
---
it was his most successful stream he's even done in terms of donations subs viewers and followers so i'd say it went well lol
---
his sister is anoying asfk
---
A FUCKIN LUV RUNESCAPE DRAMA
---
Any way to get account reverted without posting to forums? I can’t post to forums 
---
LMFAOOOOOOOOO OMG 
---
Calm down, Blackie. 
---
yaaas girl you file that false police report!  
---
Oh, oh wait. all she did was make people doubt legitimate victims. Thanks for encouraging this stuff.
---
While were on the topic of minigames, why is almost 99% of minigames dead with a playerbase that is the size of peak 2010 days. Doesnt make sense to me considering we have less content but the same amount of players. 
---
I got mine on Kc 18 first day of wintertodt release, was the best to have such a pet so early after an update.
---
You have autism.

Maybe years ago lmfao, do you have no memory of runefests and whatnot 
---
"For no reason" then the pillory guard will say - "You're under arrest, For No Reason, you'll have to come with me."
---
Nah I am not a dumb ass I know the world is round and that a friend is a scum bag. I am showing interest because he brings a bad name to osrs with the scummy stuff he does and this last one is just getting him a fanbase back.
---
its some twitch chat emote cancer
---
For real i see all of these fake emails and in the 8 years ive played this game i have yet to see one.
---
Surely not as the police showed up
---
wow youre a fucking genius
---
As weird as this might be. I’d rather do all those things with a cat than that savage missing link looking monster 
---
I do. Doesnt mean I own every seed. How stupid are you? Do you know how often I get white lily contracts and have 0 white lilies?
---
Zing
---
I see no issue with this.
---
If you're offended by anything, that's your problem.
---
That’s sad then. That’s nothing
---
Jesus christ what a rollercoaster stream. Hope he goes back to the Netherlands and cuts all ties. If he goes back home he luckily won't have to pay child support either.
---
Ah fair enough lol, what a legend
---
No, he should make a main/med then after that a pure. Low level pure pking is resident sleeper 
---
Girlfriend cheat, break up, not on pill, said she was
---
New.
---
The major problem is that a friend is still one of the biggest osrs youtubers i terms of views and still the longest runescape YouTube to still be popular. 
---
For clarification: Dovy had sex with other girls yesterday after telling her he's breaking up with her. He did not cheat on her. She is gaslighting him.

I dont understand the people saying aithenticator delay wont help/isnt necessary. If your login details have been compromised then 2fa doesnt do anything.

If someone gets hacked somehow yeah its most likely their fault, but that doesnt mean there shouldnt be a last line of defense.

You’re proof that siblings shouldnt have kids

this is pretty funny presuming the terrible image was intentional

also happy cake day

NOBODY ASKED ABOUT YOUR PRIVLEDGED ROBIN HOOD WEARING ASS I WALKED 2 DAYS FROM MORYTANIA IN MY SWAMP RAGS   TO BE A PART OF THE MOVEMENT.
---
Zmi was rough, take little breaks from it if you are prone to burning out on goals like me. I'd grind a few levels then train another skill. Once I got to the low 70s I'd only do one level at a time
---
You need that scene from Get Smart when he’s running the obstacle course
---
Recommend training to 70's at crabs.
---
Yea I ain't too worried about it, just educating others so they dont find themselves in a bad spot from terrible advice they found reddit lmao
---
Stick to the milfs boys, they mom an dad ain't gon throw youn in the slammer ✌😁

She had an ex she cheated with, he broke up with her and payed for a prostitute which since they weren't together, wasn't cheating.

Eat that snakes ass

TIL you’re not actually riding a broom ..
---
THE WORLD WAS GONNA ROLLL MEEE
---
I'm not sure how you would't know that Ice's old streams had tons of a friend viewers mentioning him in meme songs, so therefore new.
---
Yeah that's my bad. 
---
Cheers for the recommendation, I just wanted to find a way to get it to that level so I can enjoy slayer and do it efficiently. Right now im meleeing everything and I don't want to miss out on that later when I get the better tasks like you listed. 
---
can someone update me on this shit
---
 Ok, whatever you say
---
Pff
---
so u mean to tell me that it might not even be the little karambwan wew lad
---
Irl money subscription. I've got the grandfathered $7.95 rate because I never let it drop even when I would take extended breaks for work and shit.

It was definitely on purpose and not just because I forgot to cancel it even though I thought I should every single month it was on my debit card statement

just change it to a broomstick

Don’t care about the details lol the whole situation is retarded and he should keep his private life private

do you actually believe half of the shit you type?

fox news watchers lol
---
Dovydas finally broke out of his girlfriends control and is a free man now
---
Yeah I hang out in dovy’s CC, she’s in there sometimes and is a straight up nazi mod. Also they talk in there as if in PM’s, some lovey dovey shit but it’s obvious he’s wrapped around her finger.
---
unless i'm tripping this is the most humane she's looked in a picture before
---
He's also a piece of shit for various reasons.

Nice stats m8. Can't wait hack you. /s

thanks!

Meet Cuckletics, my cuckold locked irl Hardcore Ironman. After recently watching my girlfriend be impregnated by another man, I decided to up the ante and take care of his child from birth. No love, no trust and this time I can't even have the respect of my girlfriend. All leading up to eventually taking on one of life's biggest challenges: realizing I was born alone and that I will die alone.
---
Any recommendations for decent things to alch? I know I'll lose some money but if I can mijnizt the damage that'd be great 
---
Oh lord what A Friend drama did I miss
---
Agility is more of an incentive or should I say more precisely, a surplus skill that makes things easier.  In reality you can even be a member, and if no quests had required agility, you could do all quests and get 99 in all other skills and have never trained agility.  Agility is not even a necessity, as I stated.  
---
Fuck A Friend.
---
Nice copypasta.
---
How is his comment narcissistic? 
---
Imagine dating that goblina lmao wtf i thought that kid had money from whoring on youtube/twitch?
---
Woah, easy there man, no need to use the hard "R". 
---
I AIN'T THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED!
---
Such a nice guy. Sadly he's not going to continue the account, despite it being such a unique and interesting idea.
---
F
---
Ultimate level of anxiety for no reason
---
The game will not record experience past 200m. There is no way to tell if someone is 200,000,001 xp or 500m xp. Therefore, there are no virtual levels past 126. Anyone claiming to have seen someone higher is either inebriated or lying
---
hahaha
---
What holiday lmao
---
I feel sorry for Dovy but can’t say I’m surprised. This chick knew he was killing it on YouTube and took advantage of his karambwan heart.
---
Oh rip. I saw this dude at clan wars and I he said he was trying ds2. No idea he was a streamer.

https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide  
---
Some quests have low requirements but give you a lot of XP which lets you skip the early levels for particular skills that can be really slow to train. For example Waterfall quest can take you from 0 attack and str XP all the way to level 30 in both and it'd take you like half an hour max, while training would probably take you an hour or two at a guess.  
---
You don't have to follow the list to a T either, you can think of it as a list of useful unlocks. If you feel like you don't need something that a quest rewards you with, then you can leave it for now.
---
Besides quick XP there are quests that allow you to use certain types of teleports, and those save you a lot of time in the long run especially if you can get them done early on, such as Tree Gnome Village for spirit tree teleports, and Fairy Tale 1, which unlocks the fairy ring network, somewhere around 40 teleport locations from a single quest.  
---
As well as quests, some achievement diaries have pretty useful rewards even for just doing the easy or medium part. The easy ardougne diary has hardly any requirements but unlocks a useful unlimited teleport close to Ardougne. Lumbridge diary has a ring that restores run energy + teleport, and Varrock is good for some passive income every day.

Wtf dude

&gt;when you accidentally ahk your password into the chat

Now he can play the game again.

Most people in the primary age range that play have a week off now.
---
Guys this man is a god!  He delivered me my spade 😊😊
---
He could have still done better, he's got money. Paying whores would have been better than that.
---
Kumar really is amazing. Just got back into this game after a long hiatus. Did some shitty task, with monsters that drop nothing, got a brimstone key, and got half a mil worth of dragon dart tips.
---
Victim indeed.

WE GOT FEB DRAMA CALENDAR FILLED BOYS

Is it really “hacking” if he posts the email and password in-game and therefore all over his stream? Sigh... Dovydas...

isn't she the reason why a friend did all that selling out? bitch trapped him with a kid.
---
Worth
---
so hows rioting in a game doing anything
---
Oh yea forgot about that giant ass boss from quest.
---
Noones cares, dude is old news.
---
Thanks bizzy
---
Yeah well it's not us who are streaming and going nuts. So yeah quite entertaining, with a little bit of cringe and awkwardness. 
---
That missclick. Such an unfortunate timing as well :(
---
T
---
His viewers knew she was trouble the moment we saw her, I'm just sad our intuitions weren't wrong
---
Found different screen recorder 
---
Noones cares, this dude is old news.
---
REEEEEEEalise the truth brothers and sisters the truth shall come forth 🚨🚨🚨
---
Instead of a child why not an RS Classic model? If they managed to do that then it’d be way cooling I think
---
damn didnt he just move into a new house with her lol
---
Once theyre banned there are new ones immediately to take their spot. Its a futile task. 
---
Unfortunately you posted this at the wrong time and will be overshadowed by the A Friend drama. Good shit tho.

Blessed d hide. Oh wait.

smh lol

Frogs can’t use photoshop, you on crack or something? Probably.

easy bwana

That's not a little ass that's a whole swamp full of ass.
---
He’s going on quite the attention blitz today - and you’re taking the bait. 
---
No one cares, this dude is old news. Stop trying to battle Rez him.
---
In my experience, it's justified. They don't do shit.
---
Lost a few accounts and had friends lose accounts and it's really fucking difficult to get them back. It's not impossible, just way more difficult than say World of Warcraft which takes a week at most, and that's just to get a response due to the large ticket volume. When they do respond it's practically fucking instant.
---
What happened? Source?
---
No one cares stop trying to battle Rezz him.
---
Source?
---
Happened after hydra update because of all the bloods coming in from the new monsters. 
---
says the fucking ironman jesus christ this is rich
---
only if she drops a 2H mace called "the pillar"
---
To each their own. I figured the pure was a good start simply because after it’s made you can really take it in any direction.
---
unknown, where do i check that? also how can i check info for an old account? is there any sort of online stat tracker? my OG is long dead
---
LOL ssh
---
Once you pick up litter people just throw more garbage on the ground anyway, so it's a futile task. /s
---
 C'mon dude.
---
In one of the clips he admits to paying 3 whores lol.
---
all of these should be profitable if only slightly: adamant platebodies, most rune gear, dragonhide armour, basic elemental + lava battlestaves, some dragon equipment (typically older items like dagger, longsword, scimmy, med helm, etc)
---
s
---
Do we have any proof of any of this though or is it just his word? A Friend doesn't have the greatest past so it's hard to just believe him here.
---
Really? That actually makes me feel better lol why it do that 
---
It's happened to me 3 times in 2 years.
---
Garbage item anyway youre good, also pures are gay, noob.
---
Strap on your headgear and go to his twitch page and check out the clips. Holy shit what the fuck did I miss is all I have to say
---
There are several alch calculators online. Just google them
---
Generally profitable items are either fairly expensive (50k+ each) or have low market trade volume/low limits. But with patience you can mijnizt the losses pretty well
---
No
---
I heard from johno r that they make fuck all.
---
This is the best post I've ever seen on this reddit 
---
S
---
I think it got to be more than just about his dick. Cutting down on his Play time for mental health and moving to a better country and such. He probably really cared for her but every interaction between them you could tell it wasn't going both ways.
---
That's how it works in mine :/
---
I'm hoping the best for the man. She was a cunt.
---
cute dog
---
Agreed
---
We already have excalibur though
---
Exactly.
---
[https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) \- probably used a reused password that has been breached
---
And swag
---
you guys are pretty salty damn
---
Thx for this. Im on task 41 right now and doing canafis slayer until the 50th task when ill switch to konar for the big point drop that will let me assemble slayer helm. 
---
Probably shaved a good hour off this grind. 
---
The price of alchables doesn't compare to how much money you make from alching the item itself. 100gp per alch is literally nothing when you are making 1m a task anyways. 
---
Minigames Will never be a thing because most of ppl just want slayerscape, end game bosses and pvming, don't u see that pking only exists thanks to revs (which is pvming) ? Otherwise I bet u, wilderness would be dead.
---
&gt;why is almost 99% of minigames dead
---
How can give pregarganet but not get babi?
---
Very nice, only thing I'd suggest is changing blush color to match internals (blue, in this case)!
---
Always great to see more :b:onar
---
it's definitely worth getting a torture, but it also depends on if you have other gear as well.
---
For example, if you don't have a berserker ring yet, buy that instead
---
Also upgrading your Barrows Gloves to ferocious gloves is a better upgrade for your money than the Torture is, assuming you've done DS2.
---
Just keep in mind that both of these upgrades come at a loss of Defense and Prayer stats, and also cannot be effeciently used for hybrid situations, since they lose all offensive bonuses to range and magic.
---
Bosses should be loot&gt;xp not the other way around. I don't really see any need for new best or near best training methods for really any skill, but what skills really do need is some good, engaging money making content. 
---
Dovy's life feels like a tragic sitcom, crazy shit follows him everywhere
---
So I've just sunk an hour into the Mage Training Arena hoping to get a Mage's Book - Before I waste anymore time, just confirmation that I need all 4 kinds of points, not just say the 500 Telekinetic points? As I had a brief moment of hope that it'd be that easy to get my hands on one.
---
What?  He gave a complete description. It’s the complete opposite of clickbait.

where did you see this?

There's clips on his twitch channel that cover most of it.

Awesome, thanks bro 👍🏼
---
&gt; Set a fucking week long delay on removing the authentication without entering the authentication itself
---
You realize the problem you stated would still exist yes? I guarantee they'd have a method to bypass the delay, just as they did with security questions. So bing bang boom send in that support ticket "please turn off my auth delay" and you're in.
---
If you refer to your child as a little karabwan, you probably shouldn’t be having kids...

It's not true. It's bullshit. He did not hit her. He did nawt.

Wait whats happening?!

did anyone record the whole thing? he has vods disabled :/

lets hope mod jed gets some nasty cancer and his whole family rots in hell

Oh god shut up. Who gives a shit if he's a "top content creator"? If he makes good content then he deserves to be. I don't care that your feelings got hurt because he sold out to a staking site.

---
Do you know the definition of insanity? &gt;:)
---
Saving it.
---
Lol that man A Friend...what a rollercoaster he is.
---
New skills are different from stuff like quests and raids in that they change the market economy by changing the economy and the methodology surrounding the way we all train other skills. 
---
Runecrafting completely changed the distribution of runes, making it actually viable to do things like alch or cast higher level spells in pvm. Things like nats were insanely rare back in RSC, and magic in general was expensive and unwieldy. This was almost unequivocally a good thing that saved magic from being a dead skill. 
---
Slayer probably changed the game the most. It added tons of new bis gear through drops, and changed the way we all pvm. Now if you're camping something outside of slayer it's either crabs for xp or bosses for gp. Nobody sits there killing fire giants anymore for rune scimmies. And over time the skill grew to completely define the way normal accounts earn money and ironmen gather resources through their resource drops. To the point where it's better to just get drops through slayer (and bosses) than to actually use resource gathering skills to gather resources. Nowadays people just mine and woodcut for the sake of levels and then go do something else. The skillification of pvm impacted every single other skill in the game. Some people love it, others hate it. And that's been the case since Slayer's release.
---
Farming is probably the post-RSC skill that takes the most from other skills while spitting out the least. It revolves entirely on thieving and slayer to pump seeds into the economy, and in return it's really only served to rebalance herblore.
---
Construction rippled through other skills in a medium degree. It made prayer training viable for the average joe, and it made oaks more useful...the skill's main impacts are trading a money sink for lots and lots of QoL features. Which nobody really complains about.
---
Hunter basically just pisses money and also made it possible to get 99 range in a day or two through chins. Everything else about it is dead content. 
---
So, on a scale of hunter to slayer, where will warding come in? Probably somewhere squarely in the middle. A new skill is different from a raid because even if the rewards are good and balanced, in the case of a skill the content itself is what impacts the gameplay the most. "It's not oldschool" means that it can potentially change the way we train 10 other skills overnight. It will undoubtedly change the balance of resource generation skills along with causing shifts in similar skills like crafting as it squeezes itself in. It'll change pvm yet again making magic more competitive at middle levels, squeezing itself into the range meta. Might even affect pvp in that regard too. Warding isn't just about warding, ultimately it is about changing everyone's relationship with magic.
---
Is all that change necessarily bad? No, but it's a fuckton of change for a game that's trying to maintain the way it feels to play. And we all know how delicate it really is.
---
How did I disprove my point. My point is that Europeans go from pale white to an olive tan.
---
If you're obviously darker than that you're not European, or you're mixed.
---
She is obviously not European from both her facial features, and her skin colour being too dark. 
---
I didn't say there's only one type of black person, so I'm not sure why you're bringing that up. It's obvious there's a variety in darkness for Africans. 
---
Oh hi denny 
---
A rat born in a stables is not a horse.
---
No problem, dude.

iirc the F2P metal gauntlets were untradeable.

Exactly my point, its better to call it a time table of some sorts
---
What song is that playing?
---
take a break
---
Is that a challenge
---
that's really lovely of you to say :) thanks!
---
Authenticator delay doesn't actually secure your account, it only shows you that your account is vulnerable.
---
If there was an authenticator delay, what are people going to do once the delay triggers and they get an email stating their account is compromised? Since most of them will probably go and make sure their account is secure and make a unique email with 2fa and all those good things, why not just secure the account from the start and avoid auth delay coming into play in the first place? If a player is putting thousands of hours into the game, but need jagex to fire a warning shot across their bow to get them to take  action, that's on them.

Dunno about that but I’ve two accounts with 54 attack and 99 rc.

No, I simply suggested if I were to stage something like that I'd keep it going a lot longer than he did, leave donation TTS on, etc.
---
How you drew any other conclusion than that is incredible lol
---
Why make one when you can make 2?
---
My record was 8 in a row (can’t remember the order though):
---
Celastrus, redwood, potato cactus, cadantine, white lily, snape grass, watermelon, white berries.
---
So lucky.

It may not be a bad marriage. They may do more discernment before getting married. Catholics, for example, are required to do pre-marital counseling that helps identify potential issues and stops them before they get married. Or they’ve just learned how to work through road blocks. 
---
Does this top the time that accounts were being hacked by a jmod and having gold stolen off them? 
---
LMFAO
---
Yes unfortunately this happens when a smaller streamer suddenly gets a huge influx of viewers and isn’t equip to deal with so many people :/
---
RIP John Travolta's HCIM

That is my bad then I took at is it must not be fake because he didn't keep it going longer

The void knights decided that flooding the island would be easier.

Did warding pass or something? 
---
According to what he said she told him it was "tight pussy"
---
Ahh yeah and only faked a fight and getting the cops called once. I see the pattern now only do it once and try something new
---
Why does every assume GP ruins the game for people? Ok, yeah, id say if someone walked up to a fresh lvl 3 and gave 500m, that would kind of ruin it. 
---
But not everyone is like that. When I started (well, came back to the game) I never forgot how shitty that starting grind is. I, personally, and I know for a fact for a lot of other people also, the start is easily the most boring part of it, especially if its your second or third time doing it. Right of the rip, bought membs and bought 3 bonds which sold for like 12 mil at the time.

12m was just enough to get me all the buyable stats I needed to get to the content I actually enjoyed, Mid level quests like Monkey madness and Desert Treasure, in about a week, and while doing that spending my GP on skills and passively making a bit back, by the time I got to where I wanted to be, I was just barely skimming above the surface GP-wise to sustain myself, while progressing at the pace I enjoyed.
---
Ya'lls need to stop making assumptions for other people, The checked out his stream and it definitely DOES NOT look like anyone is ruining anything for him.  
---
That's nuts, got a screenshot?
---
Oh absolutely, you'd have to be an idiot to think this was staged given all of this info lol. I just don't know how you thought I would say "this didn't give him added attention and viewers" 
---
If you flip it sideways, it's an A for "Actually, where the fuck is Runecrafting?"
---
Makes it really nice since you don’t have to move between cooking and banking.

Baiting kids into gambling for your house money is pretty fucked as well if you ask me.

There was a dude in my clan (booted now but that’s another story) who would buy gold and then get high, and bored and just give people in the clan $$. Can’t fault people for taking free stuff. They didn’t know where it came from.

Honestly I love slayer, but if this is a Fishing Boss I feel we should we reconsider the slayer requirement.

Hellcrafting blocked out, I see what you did there.

Bust in yer' trousers, did ye?

Nope, had no reason to screenshot it, sadly.

The gated area with the ladder in lava maze is also f2p but you can't open the door on a f2p world, and is in 50 wildy so you're literally trapped forever until someone with ranged kills you.

Y’all do know you don’t need to make new emails, right? Just throw a period anywhere in your email and it’ll still work.

For instance u.sername@email.com is the same as username@email.com and you can throw a dog between any letter you want and it’ll register a new account.

Oh when you try to climb the ladder in f2p, it says it's a members area? Weirrddd been ages since I was f2p thanks for explaining

I would give a lot of things for 850$ right now.

Hell I’d give a lot for a lot less too..
---
Mate you must really enjoy the game because it wouldn’t touch it without being a member lol. It’s absolutely disgusting being f2p so many boys every where and everything is so slow there training f2p is aids. A good day or two in members and you’d have base 40s maybe even 50s just from quest alone.

oh shut the fuck up. he was livestreaming this because he needed the support of his fanbase to get himself out of his horrible situation with his manipulative cheating girlfriend. who he said "i could have been trapped in this for 10, 20, 30 years but thank you guys for all the support getting out of this. i feel so free." he WANTED us to be there an experience this with him. otherwise he would have turned off his stream. dummy head 
---
I'm having the issue with both the default client as well as with OSBuddy
---
I accidentally did this on my account. I removed the auth which was instant as long as you have access to the email. When I logged back in, it didn't ask me for my bank pin and I shat my pants thinking my bank was breached. After hopping it started asking me for it again.
---
Didn't really test it after this, not sure if it was by chance or it has something to do with it.
---
If you need help figuring out what happened DM me.

Just means he's not a good one

But if it consumes the item it lets genuinely rich people flex and also adds another item sink into the game

Been a while since I had OSBuddy (I use runelite now, as do most of the community), but I believe there was an option called resizable fixed client, or something along those lines. It should allow you to "magnify" it.

Second, do you think "the sword in the Stone" sorry was originally created by...a game developer?
---
Man I know a large chunk of the community hates him for selling out (AFAIK), I can't help but feel bad for the guy. I can only imagine how alone he feels right now, not only losing the only person he cared about in his life, but being cheated on by her, and being shunned by the community he loves.
---
Hope he moves back and gets back in his groove 
---
Why is your drop notification so low
---
Yep. If you’re not an Ironman the only point of mage training arena is to unlock bones to peaches
---
Missed out steelman and blackman 
---
Ouch. Ended my membership 12-10-2007, didn't come back until February-March 2013. OSRS or bust.
---
Take two out of the three melee hits then stand back so the gorilla can't hit you (use the water or mountain areas) then switch to protect from magic and attack using range, after you hit once or twice he will switch to range attack if you use runelite you get 1-2 seconds to switch from prot mage &gt; prot range with a bit of practice for the timing you should never get hit. Hope that makes sense!
---
Because all the kids grew up and now they know how to play the game in the most efficent and max exp per hour 
---
Try runelite. It’s lighter on cpu and crashes less. Also it has way more features but that’s not related to the issue
---
how do you know? did he say?
---
He staged and scripted a a fake break up to become relevant again and it worked
---
Copied from above:

Legitimate question for you: How does somebody become aware of cohabitation incompatibilities with their partner if they don't cohabitate before marriage?
---
A while back I was 2 years deep into a very serious relationship. We moved in together, realized after spending most waking hours together for a year that spending the rest of our lives together wasn't what either of us wanted. I don't think we would have realized that if we hadn't taken the plunge and lived together.
---
What, in your opinion, was the move there? Keep dating towards an almost certain eventual marriage? *Then* cohabitate and eventually divorce due to the incompatibilities?
---
Is *that* the best case scenario for how something like that goes, to you?
---
Do you not see how, despite the breakup being much messier, it benefited both me and my ex to realize these things *before* making the big Marriage Commitment?

What usually happens with domestic calls like this in the Netherlands, the cops come inside and diffuse the situation, then try and advise the couple to split up for the night, to avoid any other calls, in this case it sounds like the cops and them agreed that 1 stays upstairs and the other downstairs.
---
You always have 2 officers, one talking to each person, advising them what to do. The streamer got told to stay upstairs and not say anything about her on video because if she pressed charges the computer and footage would be seized for investigation.

At those levels you’ll get rekt. Try beta worlds and practice with different setups (gear, level, etc). You can get a taste of pking and adjust based on your needs. Also good prayer switching practice.

He's only going up from here - mark my words. 
---
We’ve reached an all time low for this subreddit with this post alone. Congrats on confusing the shit out of everyone you dweeb
---
&gt; They didn't change it from RS2 to RS3 just because they added Summoning  or Curses or Dungeoneering or Nex or any of the other bigger pieces of  content.  
---
They never did shift from RS2 to RS3 directly ever.... I do not know where you are getting that from.  It was RS2, then RSHD, then RS3.  The only difference from RSHD and RS3 was EOC and they made all skills F2P till level 5.  RS2 to RSHD was only the graphics.    
---
Oh.... I belive you somewhat on that though..... people were already complaining to make RS2 to RS3 when the controversial summoning was released.  But instead they changed it in June of that year, and that too not RS3 but RSHD.  
---
These complaints to upgrade the game number happened again when Jagex released [Deadliest Catch Quest](https://runescape.wiki/w/Deadliest_Catch) which had [Anemone and her other 2 sisters](https://runescape.wiki/w/Anemone), and people wanted Jagex to rename RSHD to RS3 or RS4, thinking RuneScape was going to turn into the next adult game.  However that never happened thankfully, and Jagex did not rename the game.  
---
&gt; The mechanics you are talking about are all minor surface level stuff. 
---
Majority of the minor surface level stuff mechanics that was added, was added in the original game series in RSHD not RS2.  
---
&gt; Warding is a big change since it wasn't in RS3 .
---
It was never proclaimed as a skill in RS3.   Warding in RS3 is basically crafting imp hide or spider silk into magic equipment.  Thus warding (the ability to make magic armour), would be something that is similar to what was added in RS3.  
---
Basically a lot things, especially mostly the mechanics, that were recently added to the game was added in versions of RuneScape after RuneScape 2.  
---
Still have mine, 103 combat btw haha
---
Hey, did you just blow in from stupid town?
---
But what’s the problem you have with it 
---
Oh the irony.
---
He wrote it like a question.. Definitely looks like he was asking chat if he should break up but he was asking chat if what he did was the correct move.
---
whats beta worlds?

I don't think it's the "transform" part of the item as much as it is the "remember which item its transforming to". But now that I think of it, it might not be too much of an issue..
---
My account got falsely banned, I sent emails, went through the forums and even send them a letter (Don't judge). Then I decided to create a Twitter account and that's how I got my account ubanned
---
If you look at his views from before his first big hit (the taking donations and then immediately giving 150m to a scammer) compared to now, his regular views are basically halved. He went from 200k average per video to nearly 100k average. That’s not his “entire” fan base gone but it’s a large enough hit to warrant being concerned.
---
I feel you man, I think she wasn't worth it for him at all.
---
Agreed I'm all for him doing what he wants instead of what everyone else wants
---
Yo they are so fucking cringe, like A Friends career and rep are soo down the hole. Poor guy needs to move back &amp; get a 9-5.
---
Oh shit should i be doing tears of guthix

But that would require 66 runecrafting. Ewww
---
Most bosses. Zulrah seems promising for your stats if you have some mils to throw towards gear
---
Don't know why you're getting downvotes, source on an accusation like is reasonable to ask for.

Why would he report himself
---
It is, but A Friend is also in the picture
---
Do people not use password managers? KeePass won’t can auto type usernames and passwords into websites and apps/clients and you won’t risk typing it into the wrong place because it checks the window you are focused on matches the password entry you set up for it.

it's 94 not 96

I really doubt it’s stake that’s donating. You can set the name to anything when you donate.
---
I mean, realistically even if he is, so is she and she started the toxic relationship spreading her attitudes, ideology, and morality over to him.
---
Joon the King did a real good video about his situation.
---
Sorry are you his accountant? Writing his biography? 
---
Does any anybody have the vod?
---
Let's hope twitch gives the whole vod for use as evidence, and he might get the physical abuse charges thrown out. 
---
You sound fun.  
---
And giving someone all the gold they ever need takes away the grind.  “How do I get armor”? Just go and buy it. 
---
“How do I get good”?  Go buy it. 
---
There’s no wonder and excitement being able to go from having to steal cakes, or eating anchovies, to finally being able to fish lobsters.  
---
Or using an iron dagger and saving up some change to buy a mitheral scimitar.  
---
All my best memories as a new player would have been ruined if I could just go buy everything.  
---
“Absolute bullshit” lol.  Ok kid. 
---
What would be the requirement?
---
good for him she looks like a mountain troll
---
why does she keep saying he's not cool when he clearly is?
---
A friend made up drama to get twitch viewers. 
---
This made me laugh harder than it should have, have an updoot
---
Careful, I think he took my Knights Sword once.
---
Im not dedicated to gaming enough to sit in a flooded basement and play. Kudos to them.
---
I think it’s fun to see, watching him got 5 years and even if he’s done some scum stuff, I still like to see drama, he was a big part of the RuneScape community for a long time 
---
It is. He knows what he's doing. 
---
Yes, basically if you want your username and password to be autotyped into RuneLite, change the title/heading to RuneLite instead of OSRS or RuneScape etc. Basically the name of your saved details need to match the window title, if that makes sense.
---
 &gt;Afriend being an aggressive chad
---
I'd be pretty aggressive too if the girl i broke up with 3-4 days before came in and started airing their dirty laundry on stream. he didn't cheat btw. he started fucking whores after he dumped her but she can't accept that the relationship is over.
---
Best way to stop 99.99% of hacker is use an Authenticator.  
---
is being worked on, last status update was "you can put stuff in, but you cannot yet get stuff out"
---
Because he's a fool.
---
She’s actually a Suqah superior.
---
Dude is enjoying the game. He's a r/cutenoobs not a brainlet.
---
That was a spicy double entendre
---
Fuckin weeb. 
---
whats the ideal set up for a g maul pure?
---
just started playing after years, lost on which direction to go with this acc I've started. Want to keep it at one defense
---
Iron, man.
---
(I don’t actually know if that’s good or not I just wanted to make that bad joke)
---
Hmm, I wonder if this is bugged specifically on Linux then. Even after setting the autotype title to RuneScape (name of the window), it still auto-types into the last window I had selected regardless of the title.
---
Congrats brother, I love the 1 defense but 95 strength as well haha. Who needs defense when you can hit harder than Tyson. 
---
But that’s like 10% of the toxicity i’m used to? D: EUW lol player btw
---
Admit it’s griefing and i won’t treat you like a piece of shit. The audacity that you people put so much effort into an alt to grief new players while acting it’s normal human behaviour is disgusting. 
---
Treat people like shit, get treated like shit. 
---
This so much this those bombs are pretty much irrelevant if you just walk east and west.
---
Really?
---
No lmao, he had police called on him
---
Yeah, Jagex are so great that they'd listen to us and implement it immediately, like how they hid the poll results.
---
What do you expect from a 28 year old that plays a game for 16 hours a day for 5+ years.
---
btw
---
It isnt close to ehp. Not even close. 
---
Got mine at 1465...glad I'm not you XD
---
r/lostredditors
---
you think 75 STR ATT RANG 70 DEF is enough ? kinda excited to try this if not what bosses will fit my stats ?
---
I’m 90 attack/strength and 93hp and dharoking I get around 96k/hr without using a spec weapon often, if at all.  I don’t really know why your xp rates are so much lower, but maybe it’s the bosses? I tried a similar list to yours the other day after seeing it on reddit and saw my xp rates plummet.  I use Roald, Count Draynor, ice troll king, moss giant, and Arrg.  Maybe that’ll help.
---
With that boss list, flicking piety and using d claws as spec weapon I can get over 120k/hr pretty easy.
---
70 and 70% done won’t do anymore until unlock seers tele 
---
What the hell is the point of a long password that you ahk? Itd be better to have a 4 letter password and actually type it
---
99% of people getting hacked is their own fault; change my mind.
---
Nah, fuck that dude. Bitch is being petty as fuck. She knows damn well he’s streaming and brings their personal life into it. For what? Why? Him roasting the fuck out of her on stream was some of the funniest shit I’ve seen in a good while. And she sticks around because she sees the money rolling in and is hoping it’ll come to her.
---
Fuck her and props to dovy for seeing her as the gold digging cunt she is.
---
Joon the King does great videos on everything
---
Yeah shes ogre status in every one
---
Idk, I watched for about an hour and it seemed like a pretty genuine dispute. He was surely milking the scenario by continuing to stream - but I think the dispute itself was very genuine. 
---
Jeff get on Skype
---
idk man I came back to osrs and Ive only been playing like a year, approaching 1700 total and I wish I had people throwing me money to speed up skilling. Honestly now that I think about it I don't even know where my first mil came from
---
he seems like he's just unlucky
---
dude, i feel sad for you. i'm hunting the chin pet 24.7m xp. I know the feeling. I thought 3 guys to hunt chins and they get a pet :| 
---
It’s some sweaty shit but people do much worse in this game 
---
Dovydas technically didn't cheat, he broke up with her before buying the 3 hookers.
---
should i aim for as low hp as possible?
---
use cannon and splash methods to train range/magic?? quests as much as possible for att/str?
---
For the cure
---
Lol dum
---
OSRs is safe.
---
Jagex has a poor recovery system and no post-hack support but if you are safe w your info you wont get your acc hacked.
---
Not saying they dont need to do more- they do, but if all your friends got hacked theyre idiots
---
i've just slowly been spending what was left of my rs3 money for premiere packages on my 2 accounts. I can probably afford 1 more year assuming i don't make any more money on rs3. 
---
You can already do that, talk to any banker and one of the options is to change bank pin settings when hopping or logging
---
He said it at the end of the stream almost
---
lmfao
---
Why would it not be possible in pvp worlds?
---
I did this quest before jagex implemented the increased zoom limit so I only remember this guys feet. What a unit.
---
blowing Dovy is the new meta
---
I think it’s a meme
---
Sorry saw Alfie so downvote
---
But you came back to OSRS, it wasn’t your first time.

I just love that you're called lucky bone.

i know, but it will cost you 35 euro

Tell that to the poor souls who devoted their precious time in maxing out, to what many in the community refer to as, "not a skill."

How can no one correct a guy on his pose. I see these pictures a lot. How can that even be comfortable for even just a few seconds

Equip it

I don't remember last time I've seen someone not doing that mistake.

Our realistic one?
---
What kind of support do you people look for? Jagex isn’t going to return items. Change your password on your email and rs account and get 2fa on both. Nothing jagex can do.
---
Honestly, I would love a return to his 10 hour videos, but MrNoSleep basically picked up the slack there, so...eh. Honestly, A Friend killed his shit for no real reason and I do not think there is much to be gained from going back. He needs to either return to the old shit with a twist or reimagine his shit (and no, Fremmy-locked ironman does not count...that shit was lame....)
---
It's his, he's said he's sure, she even offered a dna test

Why not?

Give it a spec which makes you plop it down and try to pull it out. You are only succesfull if you are 99 strength. 
---
Let’s just say the mic is doing her a favor.
---
It depends which worlds you hop to, try hopping to 330 through quick hopper it will always happen
---
You get graceful around low 70s if you trained it efficiently xp wise. Meaning questing, bit of barb fishing early, doing xp courses over rooftops when theyre superior xp/hr
---
You get it around late 50s if you trained inefficiently xp wise. You can get it sooner if you were real lazy, marks are per time spent on course so if you super afk while doin canafis for example you can get it rly low lv
---
I mean I remember asking him on stream how much YouTube pays and he said for every one million views he gets 1,000 dollars 
---
No point in pk’ing as a hardcore ironman because you can’t pick up other people’s items, or get exp off them. 
---
There's more money in suing Epic Games. Plain and simple.
---
Beautiful
---
Guthix ain't peace, he's balance
---
Yeah fair enough if I started playing for the very first time I feel like I would be so lost. Pretty sure everyone on this sub takes their game knowledge for granted
---
Perhaps because you just read it normally and don't think much of it
---
I'll keep an eye out for your plugin!
---
excuse me sir why is the moon further from the earth than the sun
---
all money is good money
---
Setting a week long delay is just delaying the inevitable if they have your email. How inconvenient do you want it to be when you get a new phone or something. Take some responsibility 
---
Not to scale
---
They're paying taxes tho so dont think they're making exactly that. Still, better gp than zulrah and a greater chance of getting a mutagen or a pet serpent
---
Now this is the content that I subscribed for!
---
I got some decent fishing xp out of it. What’s made me laugh is her saying he should stop talking about it even though she invaded his stream talking about him, but when he started about her it became too much 😂
---
well i did a few raids with them, the only problem I felt was it was either the people who joined us in the raid was super super good or they were bad.
---
It's a part of the default client.  You can enable it somewhere in the settings tab.  It's also great for fishing/mining.
---
Got hacked aswell. I'm extremely careful with the way i handle myself in the internet, so there is no fucking way that my computer is infected or something else. I honestly thing that there was a information leak that jamflex isn't acknowledging. 
---
He is a dumbass who brought this upon himself, acting like dovydas wasn't also at fault here is ignorant
---
Actually would be an interesting mechanic. Dark Souls 2 had a spear that was stuck in stone until you broke it and after that it was actually a very good spear.
---
He is a little bit unlucky, but he's also a fool for diving into things like dodgy sponsorships and uncertain relationships so recklessly.
---
This makes me want official wilderness locking for Ultimate Ironmen that delete on death.
---
At first glance I thought it was a meme on A Friend’s ex. On topic though, I wouldn’t mind this suggestion 😄
---
Hap cak day
---
Did u ever do vorago back when that was new, or rots or telos? All those were way more fun than raids imo. Anyways glad you're having fun, i've also been doing lots of raiding recently :P
---
47k in the coffee eh? Gg account. 
---
whats your ram and cpu utilization when you try to run the game
---
Nope. made it myself :)
---
Idk how to feel about this. I got my zulrah pet on KC 75 and it devalued it in my eyes, since I didn't really work on it. At the same time I'd for damn sure want the pet before I got 10k kill count. If it were implemented a long time ago I'm sure everyone would love the mechanic, but like you said, people that are already super dry would get a consolation prize.
---
I just got a bow as the first unique in my name a few days ago. 
---
Was 72 kc. Also did like 120 raids on my other account a few years ago, but even then i don't think i hit the drop rate.
---
Fireballs do your entire HP bar regardless if you have 99 or not.

Name checks out 
---
I bet you blame the waitor when the food is shit you brainlet.
---
Or you could be a real chad and manually cast barrage with SoL/SotD so people know not to mess around. Aint no one out dpsing this mage bonus boi
---
Got mine at 74 but I also did all the xp quests and used things like legends and one small favour lamps on it. Also I dont believe in getting garbage rates at canfis post 50 for more marks
---
Is there any way of increasing the size of the inventory? (not inventory slots just the actual UI)
---
I have a 1440p monitor so my inventory is annoyingly small.
---
She looks like the cave man from those issuance commercials
---
Theres a baby involved?! God damn you guys weren't kidding about the new sitcom
---
Wait this guy had a charity stream the day A Friend tweeted he will becoming a full time streamer... Well there goes all the money he could have raised. Feelsbadman.
---
Eh I dont see why not quest rewards being bis is a bit silly they should come from a place like ferocious gloves.
---
Is all that true?

Youtuber meets girl

They fuck again

What seems to be an abusive relationship proceeds
---
Some cheating on both sides happens (prostitutes and an ex boyfriend)
---
Shitty relationship ends
---
Nah, dovy is a grown ass man and he played his part in it, too. The best outcome of this is him seeing how much he fucked up and getting out while he can. He did some fuck shit to make her happy. Maybe in the future we’ll see a return of the dovy we used to love, but it won’t happen while he’s under her thumb.
---
Its not exactly 10%, the equation is more complicated than that but its pretty close to 10%
---
How u on reddit but don’t have access to wiki u lazy nerd

sounds like dutch police to me

I woke up and now its fixed. I didnt did anything.

I woke up and it was fixed, i didnt did anything. 
---
I'd love to contribute, but I have the same dream
---
 Something about fat rune stacks make me erect
---
Ayiza bitches so much, idk why? Like look at him on twitter and sht after he quit. Mod gambit is shy and he does play the game. I'm not sure where you get your facts from though?
---
Devalues my self-consciousness
---
Chocomel. V delicious 
---
-almost ????
---
But if you had fun during that time, and played as a pastime, it makes sense to get rid of it if you desperately need money for something irl
---
Lvl 1000 is not even close to late though
---
Yeah he definitely is to blame for not seeing more than just 2 red flags lmao. I just hope he is serious about kicking her out and being done with her because these fucked up relationships always seem find a way to recover after shit like this.
---
The real dream is 10m of each, but I won't ever have gp for that XD.
---
Didn't he make a ton in the crypto boom or something?
---
/r/runescapegonewild ;)
---
I checked the instructions but i still cant seem to figure out how to do that. can you help?
---
Is it criminal in Netherlands to deliberately report fake crimes to the police?
---
Well that didnt last
---
Hmm, glad it's fixed for for you.
---
I feel like any reasonable person would do the exact same thing for that kind of money
---
Yeah when I see stuff like this idk. Just wait for the facts to come out before throwing shade. Cashing out was dumb on his part but everyone fucks up if he starts making better content I’d be open to it
---
Can easily tell you we’re quite relaxed in western europe :^)
---
I think he made a good amount but not enough to not be worried about losing basically half your income and social influence, especially considering his move from Lithuania. I can’t exactly remember if there was a specific number revealed or anything.
---
How many staminas do you take in
---
Has been asked before, jmods answer is thats what an Authenticator is. :/
---
Might want to rethink your title
---
Hes causing drama to try gain views. Hes literally abusing his GF
---
Damn, A Friend may have been very stupid the past year but he definitely didn't deserve this...Tbh I was happy for the guy when I found out he had a girlfriend and wanted to start a "real" life. However, it just turned really sour, I mean imagine changing your entire life for some girl and your kid and then the bitch does smth like this...Hope it all hets better for the poor guy.
---
Nothing like faking drama for views. Side note if he isnt faking hes literally domestically abusing his GF on stream LOL. 
---
Then mom calls and says stop streaming so manpig doesn’t sue you... overall awesome mom
---
When you've come to a conclusion about who the new repost of 2007scape is
---
Dutch law says that the father always has the right to see his child unless (child)abuse is involved.... 
---
So he's just either really bad informed or **ding ding** looking for attention
---
Would heavily devalue obsidian platelegs. I would rather see an iron platebody with strength bonus if anything
---
Right?! I say make HCIM the only playable mode and limit exp to 10k/hr max! Fuck these scrubs wanting even an iota of what we had in pre eoc, almost like that's what osrs was supposed to be or something, the whining shits!
---
I dont think hes to blame. Dude's a 27 year old virgin, of course he had no idea what red flags look like. Not saying this in a mean way btw, I've been there myself. All men were romantically inexperienced at one point.
---
Well to be fair, Dovy is technically a cheater too if he had sex with 3 prostitutes.
---
ya thats what I meant, i was the guy in the quest cape haha
---
Why not a weekly drama calendar
---
Yes the bot situation there is bad but i would recommend switching to another money making strat sadly :/
---
Uncharged dfs aswell
---
Yea making jokes means you’re incapable of parenting.
---
He was banned from Twitch. He's still big and streams on youtube

nothing to do with runescape

---
Nah, was actually Dutch police. Seems legitimate right now. I doubt he and his GF would have doxxed themselves twice if it was fake.
---
I also doubt his mother and sister would get involved if it was fake.
---
Don't try to find moral redemption on OSRS or this subreddit. Waste of time.
---
Honestly you’re better off training your stats to make it easier in the future to buy a bond as opposed to working to make one now. 
---
I got mine at 123kc, I'll pray for you brother. 
---
Race mixing is disgusting. Agreed.
---
You got recovered boy, these hackers only needs your username, if you use that multiple places they get passwords and ip adresses from different data bases to gather enough information to recover your account, they will even change their ip adress to your city to get the recovery.
---
Posted Feb 25th...HMMMM
---
Your "proof" that it's fake makes no sense. Did you not see how cautious he was about talking about her after the police showed up?
---
Also, why would someone move all the way to the Netherlands &amp; impregnate someone &amp; live with them for quite a while just to stage their breakup (note: it was his first relationship) and get some money out of it? It makes no sense.
---
r/Theredpill
---
Looking at the GE history a ridiculous amount have been dumped into the GE over the last two weeks which is going to cause a price crash for probably another week minimum. If you have a lot you’re probably going to want to hold on to them, because it’s going to be hard to sell them for much more than 70 gp in any sinificant quintet right now.
---
lol that donation text at the end
---
this is not Monster Hunter that you can do cat puns, you hear me?
---
i'm still trying to make sense of it but based on the clips ive seen, she cheated on him, he cheated on her, argument started, she called him out on some personal life shit and then when he did the same she freaked out and called the cops and lied to them about him having physically abused her
---
my black d hide body came from crafting &lt;\_&lt; i was very unlucky with hards
---
These shields are used alot in the wilderness and in clanfighting

imagine if people played alt accounts wtf
---
anyone got a link to the vod? 
---
Now I could have chalked the first portion of this to life experience, but woo boy that last one is a dick punch.
---
&gt;Seems like there were police involved?
---
wow how did you figure that one out
---
thats definitely not what happened, but legally, yeah he shouldnt have killed the camera. he likely just wanted to cut the mic to say something private to her, but also cut the camera unfortunately.
---
The fact that people actually entertained this shit blows my mind. What a stupid fucking attention cashgrab.
---
Big noob here (used to play as a kid but never good): I've done a few quests, like 40 QP and I'm going to do animal magnetism tomorrow because I want to get my rang up. But my main question is whats a good way to make money? I'm p2p and a legit 100k cash stack... I have 40 att, 50 str, 44 def, 40 range, 33 mage, 25 pray, 23 slayer, and some mid 20-30s in most other stats, with a few 1s
---
I'm not being pedantic it just seemed like he was confused as to what he did wrong. I personally don't view posting a lot on a subreddit as "cashing in", more just participating. I don't see how "im sorry?" translates or implies denying what he's doing in any way and I was just wondering why you thought he denied it and I honestly don't know why you thought he was pretending. Maybe I'm just fucking autistic
---
Guess he was right about the salty part though, maybe you should have less. It raises your blood pressure
---
Bruh 
---
Bluh 
---
You can repeat your comment, but that means I can just repeat mine:
---
Court here tends to side more with the mother. I know plenty of cases in which lawyers even say to the moms like "If you want we can make sure he will never see his dad again" and some accept it.
---
Wait, so does that mean you kept your hardcore status?
---
Ah ok. The same wasn't true for the zerker shields though right? You could buy them both charged and uncharged?
---
Who the fuck cares about this idiot ffa

Yo is that an Aqua cosplay?

RC to 99 and you can buy bonds for years.

A friend rn 
---
Anyone clip it or any vids on youtube? I missed it
---
He has a natural charisma that just sells the standard OSRS content, then in his later videos he goes into a lot of depth about working out how certain game mechanics work which is fascinating. 
---
what happend?
---
Bwaner.
---
Interesting
---
Not sure why you are being upvoted for that. The fact that you can remember them means you're being unsafe with them. You should have a different password for every website and service you use so that if one of those services gets hacked, only that account is compromised. The fact that you have so many passwords means you can't remember them and have to use a password manager. You just need to remember the master password.
---
Also, the password length and complexity is probably not good enough if you can remember multiple of them.
---
Manipulative bitch like my ex
---
He's balding.
---
My thoughts exactly hahah. That was more shit happening in 30 minutes than the whole Trump presidency. I guess some people just don't want to call negative shit like this entertaining.
---
Bottom line is though, A Friend is out of a toxic relationship and things should start getting better for him again. I know he's had some dark times lately but I know we'll get back the guy we used to watch in 2013.
---
Kek, everyone is downvoting you but nobody wants to bring up an argument to your suggestion.
---
Salmon and trout is one of the quickest methods of training fishing, just not worth doing Pike
---
Ah the old, wait for the person to come up to you and hit them with the Seercull spec and then take bets on how long it'll take until they figure out they're not casting.
---
Yeah, no shit. What about it?
---
*Shhhhh*
---
Ik snap het niet
---
Linux here too, it also just autotypes it wherever it wants too. And even if it works on X11, it'll probably not work on Wayland.
---
I know I saw it but why would you do this on stream
---
Top tip: go to dragons watch them bots and wait until they get a full inv or they start running south to tele away then ice burst them to death. Dead in like 10 seconds, no food cos they have full inv of loot = easy bank! I made near 100m doing that back pre eoc :D 
---
Need to get these on jagex March store
---
At 75 cb, is it better to get slayer tasks from chaeldar or konar (xp wise)?
---
I wish but I’d never be able to match her perfection or get down here water magic and party tricks. Megumin main btw 
---
A
---
I don't know. Ask OP. I'm guessing he's referring to the fact that 27 is quite young age to be balding.
---
Loot from Penda next please.
---
She's 7 months pregnant and the cops were called. Maybe he tried to make it worse than it had to be but it's hard to imagine her part being fake.
---
Does anyone have a recording of what happened?
---
Top quality reference 
---
&gt;Don’t be daft
---
&gt;If you want to be pedantic
---
&gt;resort to ad hominem, it seems you’re more interested in name calling
---
The original game included summoning.  They would probably have to rework too much of it to make it “fit” OSRS. 
---
No, this is genetic MPB.
---
destroy them and reclaim from diango.  better yet, buy membership/
---
What are they made from?
---
Do they work? 
---
Jeez imagine being that hateful
---
am i the only one who doesnt fully hate runecrafting? i can get behind hating on agillity but i kinda enjoy rc
---
Selling for a friend
---
The whole thing was on stream...
---
I mean I didn't even realise you could close it to begin with.
---
it was something like agc@ml.vc or some shit like that.
---
There's Discord and the official /r/2007scape cc's, reddit 07 &amp; 2007 reddit. 
---
Only uncharged but it didn't take too long to charge things unless you wanted to charge the purple Battle robes. 
---
I know. But she could have been hurt before the stream started.
---
Im an hour from pittsburgh, our shit went out earlier for a sec :O 
---
I don’t play enough to justify membership
---
She wanted to proof with a dna it is his karambwan but he doesnt get to see the kid anyway 
---
I actually think that shit is real.
---
It fits with the A friend I watched for the last 9 years.
---
This is what I do, and I mentioned it in my post. It's not a very good solution, and the music doesnt fit the gameplay if you do this. Of course you can make it fit by manually controlling it, but thats a huge pain. 
---
You mean 73? I forgive you for the typo
---
I fully support having an extra layer of security. 
---
Everytime I log in I access my bank so this would make me feel more comfortable to log out with gear on my account and not having to bank all of it every single time. 
---
Subscribers only chat? wtf you on mate. Been there chatting just fine for 2+ hours as it happened.
---
You can get a google Authenticator on your computer btw 
---
RuneLite's Inventory Marker!

I use it to tag my melee equipment in red, ranged equipment in green and magic in blue for easier switches.

&gt;I do not think he is a liar.

You must have missed all the drama around him several months back.
---
Negative $11 actually 
---
Look mate, I presented you with a logical response proving your inaccuracies and hypocrisy and now you're saying I'm providing nothing of substance. It's ok if you can't make out what I'm saying, I work with the handicapped for a living so if you need help feel free to ask. I understand some people have trouble gleaming context from text so if you want me to explain further i can
---
You don't use these? They're amazing for switching.
---
you know I love this community every time something happens people just start to riot at falador.
---
at this point they should just add an npc there who's selling protest boards.
---
Torvestas great as he’s one of the only content creators that doesn’t hold back and capitalises on memes at the expense of other content creators. 
---
Damn. Runecraftings been getting to you in a bad way 
---
So many of these accounts and similar ones for mining in MLM. Meanwhile my old main (over 300 days game time from rs2/rs3) got perma banned from doing 57-65 runecrafting so bot detection isn't completely hopeless. Makes me a bit salty but I can't blame anybody but myself :).
---
I would love to start a new account for RS3, I just can't bare doing the same 15 year old quests I've had to redo on 07 already.  
---
Other than that I wouldn't mind doing the original grinds
---
I didn't think you could get 2 pieces of the same set in one chest?
---
Reddit is now ice_poseidon2 
---
Content going a bit downhill lately. He even privated the reddit because of too much hate so ppl moved to ip2. 
---
Let’s be real. They can. They’re not a small fucking indie company lmfao. So many people seem to think jagex can’t do anything when in reality they can but don’t want to. There’s a reason I only login for events now y’know.
---
Yeah? I literally created this image. Good try 
---
Stupidity
---
Didn’t censor your barrows loot. Hack incoming 
---
How about 11$?
---
apparently you can get 3 items... lol
---
guarantee there are whales out there with billions of gp that would sink a tb into this to fuck with people
---
you're right it was 73kc, didnt want to become a meme 
---
“Smoke some weed” as Oh_Cannabis donates
---
Calling the cops for disconnecting the internet?  
---
PAYING for sex to get back at your partner?
---
Staying on stream while arguing about it?
---
Wtf...
---
Alright honestly I’d love to reach some kind of agreement. Why? Because I unironically find it entertaining to argue with internet strangers (call me a masochist or whatnot) and because I’m putting off a report for my chem lab.
---
First off, it would be awesome if we could both drop the name calling. I called you daft and pedantic. You called me professor, salty, implied I’m handicapped. Wanna call it even? No more jabs at each other because we’re not twelve btw. Let’s just talk with reason.
---
If you agree, then since you offered, I’d like you to explain. Could you explain how I’m inaccurate? You didn’t address any of my points in that “essay” so starting there would be fine imo.
---
True, but 'A Friend' is a narcissist so memeing him is completely reasonable imo.
---
I love this meme 
---
credit to my uncle for his picture manipulating skills that will land me ajob at jagex for my smart design ideas : )

Yes, you can check the worlds at the world picker
---

---
I'm sure it's only up from here
---
It's pretty game changing to allow 40 def with barrow gloves, since you can't do it now because of monkey madness exp. If this was changed pures could once again get addy gloves, and 13+ def could get rune. 
---
You lucky bastard
---
They're absolutely nice quality. 
---
Rather go to jail for hanging it around urs &gt;.&lt;

Does not solve keylogger problem really, there are some keyloggers that also take screenshots of each pin insert. But it would otherwise be a nice security upgrade. :)

So he has evidence, the whole reason she wanted him to turn off the stream was so she could have no one witness this situation so when she fabricated the “he abused me” line to the police there would be no evidence against her. You would want her to get away with that?

I have a feeling you don't have the desert treasure bosses on with all the others (including dream mentor), it made me go from like 200k points per hour to 1.1m.
---
I used dharoks with piety, absorptions and overloads and had similarish stats to you (about +5 in every stat) 
---
This guy actually cares about karma
---
Yeah this is the demonic gorilla
---
didnt mean 1 to 1 drop tables, just an upgrade. They are quite an high level monster to kill with to possible good outcome.
---
Why should every monster have a good drop table?
---
Jump on the cap  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I started a small clan chat with random people. It's been a year and we have learned raids together, tons of pvm and even pked. It's a good way to play the game.
---
We also could’t fly planes a few hundreds years ago, and we couldn’t use internet 50 years ago.
---
They could spend time to inprove their engine so these things are possible to update:) 
---
Theyre all poisonous no matter how you cook em
---
I would assume bgs speccing vorkath and then switching to a blowpipe with rigour would still be better than just a dhcb, but I could be wrong. rigour is 23% increased damage everywhere, where dhcb is 30% increased damage only on dragons. I’d buy rigour, but if you want to do like 3k vorkath kills, then definitely buy that dhcb. 
---
I think we should call child protective services so they can right on it when that child is born.

Slayer and agility in the same class ?
---
Nice, ice Warriors with dragon claws incoming
---
I prefer a mansion &gt;.&lt; like the one in draynor :s
---
You have to do rooftop agility to get them.
---
Not any slayer task doesn't we have hellhounds, dust devils, bloodvelds etc, but they have also the ratio to time to kill, the xp and the possible outcome. I feel like black demons are quite unbalanced on that part.
---
No I made this thumbnail myself, this guy just stole it and changed his thumbnail on his video posted before myn
---
Yeah, but if the ring isnt too rare the ring wouldn't be worth much, as players would have to waste a lot more gold to troll
---
what mong wouldn't accept a dna test? literally no downside to proving it
---
Sorry, let me make it clearer. Reeeeepost of the same joke we've had several times before.
---
Was only a handjob... not even cheating... smh 
---
Level 10 borderline. Get the hell out of there Dovy
---
Do unlucky
---
Again just because it’s a high level monster doesn’t mean it should have a good drop table. Jagex already gave you Demonic Gorillas if you want to make money.
---
Well? How did it go? I missed it
---
AVGtje gaat er altijd in
---
Yea, because not every task is supposed to be good, if you want to make more money on a black demon task you do demonics or stop bitching

Despite making up just 13% of Karamjas population, bwaners are responsible for 50% of poison-related deaths

Well that's fucking autistic lmao

Would be too OP for F2P imo. They only did Ruby rings cause without them making iron bars in F2P is a massive pain cause you ruin half of your ore and recieve no bars. 
---
You forget to mention what makes starting over in games like diablo different. It doesn’t take fucking forever. 30mins if I’m slow and lazy af to reach max level (in diablo 3 anyway) then I’m just grinding better and better gear to reach the same place in a few weeks at most if I’m being slow.
---
It’s just so much easier than runescape ever could be, losing your build isn’t really that big of a deal. (I’ve lost lots of builds too, before eventually surviving the season fully in top 100. Shits got hard af and super stressful when the slightest mistake instagibs you.)
---
Super rare as in I meant just normal loot, but rare because low level. 
---
I only just saw this, I have no idea the history around it all so can someone kindly fill me in on what is actually happening
---
42 is still very viable. 
---
what actually happened to Jed? And how much money has he made :o
---
Meet A Friend, my Red Light District locked Hardcore Ironman. After recently impregnating my gf I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No loyalty, no trust, but this time I can't leave Netherland because of my pregnant girlfriend. All leading up to eventually taking on one of life's biggest challenges: taking care of another mans child.
---
I hope they do these more often.  I like when they include the whole team on a project.
---
Dovydas is a piece of shit, he had this coming too.
---
What's even efficient for hunter now. Is 3t red chins still best? Or is herbivore better
---
oh boi im in for the protest boards
---
Don't think there's rates, but [this](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Thieving#Chests) has all the drops on it.
---
It doesn't have to be about parents break up, you could just use phrases out of context like you always did. I know you don't to those remixes anymore and why you don't to them, just wanted to say I really miss them and I still listen to masterpieces like 'where a friend at' or 'karambwan shop' from time to time.

I think there's a bussiness opportunity for private customer support (outside of jagex) to deal with player's problems and facilitate contact with jmods lol
---
He's talking about the gp's. Calm down
---
Saving for jmod smackdown
---
I mean, assuming Ironman here because that arguably makes agility more useful.
---
I would counter that doing select quests and training magic asap would save far more time than agility could hope to. Teleports are the real time saver ;)
---
it's not about having a case, it's about annoying Dovydas and wasting his time
---
Oh you frisky little thing 
---
Dude needs to alch her right now 
---
You only use 10 different services then? Why go through the trouble of burner emails and even the decision if something is important or not if you can just use a simple password manager?

And with complexity I mainly mean don't use info about yourself. Say your birthdate or the name of your parents.

I hate when someone receives a pet and starts screaming like a little girl. My parents might hear this and think: is my son gay or something? Why is he watching overgrown people act like babies... Seriously... 
---
I agree it made it easier, but it made it easier due to time consumption. I wouldnt say switching styles is a skill. With F keys being a thing also it doesn't save THAT much time but it is noticeable I'll give you that. 
---
But yeah..less time consuming = faster which can be seen as easier. But in no way was clicking an attack style a "skill" lol. I see where youre coming from at least. Doing updates like this are a slippery slope when the thoughts of ezscape is what ruined late rs2/now rs3. 
---
Eh, Galvek fireballs can hit up to 255. Sure, 99 hp would've been better than 70, but you'd still most likely be one-shot. (50% chance to be one-shot if you having 99 hp and are topped up with an anglerfish as well)
---
Mod Geeeeeeeeez god damn 
---
Well, it's fine that you disagree with me, but you don't have to call me retarded for it.
---
Being able to remember _a_ password isn't unsafe. Even remembering all of them isn't unsafe persé. However, the fact that you know all your passwords out of your head means they're either way to easy too guess with a bit of social engineering (by using common knowledge about yourself like your birthday or your parents name or something), you only use a few passwords for tons of services, or you only use a few online services.
---
Since most people here probably don't apply to the last one, people here knowing all of their passwords out of their head is a bad sign. Password managers exist so you only have to remember the master password, everything else is managed by the program. Please, use them.
---
Jesus, dude, people do that shit to look at child porn in the deepweb, doing all that just to play Runescape is beyond paranoid.
---
My recommendation would be: have a good, updated antivirus, don't click on shit you don't know, make an account at "haveibeenpwned" with your RS email and keep yourself updated on that. Having 2FA and changing your passwords regularly(2\~3 months is good) will do.
---
The next step would be to use a password manager, which I do, but may seem complicated or overkill to just Runescape. With one, and keeping your database(stored passwords) out of the web, you can be 99% safe(if some Neo dude wants you fucked, you'll get fucked anyway).

This approach worked for the Kardashian’s right?  Maybe he’s using his manufactured drama to springboard his career in streaming?  
---
Since you seem to be well informed on the topic, could you explain how exactly runelite works in terms of open/closed source? Is client itself closed source with just the plugins being open-source? Also how was it created in a first place, is it that some people just reverse-engineered and re-created the client from scratch or did they obtained official client's source code and assets somehow?

well, not if u dont have friends to play with and are not the highest combat or not in a clan. then u have to solo. the current system works; but i still think it can be better. and yes; you can build your luck up, but everyone can do it. that's the beauty of it

Can someone fill me in on what happened? Or refer me to something I can search for so I can understand what's going on with A Friend?

I would much rather see "the stone" used for something during a final camelot quest. Eg Excalibur must be inserted in to the stone using some kind of rare drop from a boss monster  to create the "Sir Rated Blade"

lmaoooo

Also felt it was fair to point out, like 85% of what I know predates this version of runescape I either learned it during 02-05 or from reading numerous osrs posts and comments (which has seemingly turned in to some sick hobby as actually playing the game bores me for the most part now lol) over the years.

no, but you can download the mobile app, redeem it and then its good to go

exhausted all f2p content? where is ur rune set? where is ur 60 wc so you can do the highest tree(yew) same goes for firemaking. Dont tell me you defeated obor and bryophyta with those stats. Where is 43 prayer?   
---
We dont see a proff of all your f2p quests being done. With those stats you will have a problem with elvarg (if you didnt safespot).

require to start it, you can get 32 QP very easily with alot of quick quests, romeo n juliet, sheep herder, merlins crystal etcetc

My only osrs account is an iron man and I love it. I would find a normal account more boring. The only thing I miss out on though is group bossing with friends. However I can still do group raids so it's not that big of a problem

Who does she think is looking at A Friend and going "Yeah, I want a piece of that"?
---
Agree'd but the Vote Yes happy community will pass anything that makes the game even slightly easier or more convenient to them.

imagine playing a game unintentionally
---
Whether it can be considered "QoL" or not is ultimately irrelevant though, as it was polled and passed (by a whopping [91.1%](http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=1550)).

thats unfortunate. They should definitly do something about it though. Its a shame normal users cant enjoy/play a specific piece of content because of goldfarmbots

Thank you

It is the twitch prime free membership. It is very easy for gold farmers to make new accounts on amazon and RS and use the free membership to bot for 2 weeks. /u/Bacon_And_Eggss  we have seen a massive crash in all/most bottable resources as a result of this.

43 prayer is really hard to get in f2p and why do i need to cut yew trees? and i still have 2 quests to do

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I ocassionaly drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

i just wanted some goals

Want to be my friend?

finished barrows if you were ironman (guthan not really needed, dharoks not either since mole is useless now, torag not needed, verac in some occasions but overall not needed either :O)

It wasn't scripted, you are giving them way to much credit as actors if you think it is.

&gt;	A friend, and he clearly wasn’t always a douche nozzle. 
---
He always was, people always just downvoted anything negative about him when he was popular to burry it. He doesn’t deserve what’s happening to him now though this chick is nuts.

That account is a fresh email, sure maybe same IP but that isn't definitive at all, it hasn't broken any rules until it trades the gold off to a RWTer. There's nothing to ban it for if they're not botting.

Every different colour is a different model

&gt;I don't understand why people would spend hundreds if not thousands of hours just to play HCIM safely

Because some people like to play for ranks/slight competitiveness, and it's basically the only game mode where that's possible. 
---
Nice.
---
Fishing should be on either b or a.
---
Defence is easier to train than str and attack.
---
Hit points should be down in e or d.
---
Construction should be down in c.

Agility swapped with mining.
---
Slayer placed in b.
---
Funny how it works. Haven't played the game in over a year and yet I still check this sub every so often. Mostly for the memes though. And drama is always entertaining.
---
Yeah they're both insane, although I could make the case that his ex was a little bit more crazy while dovy is a little bit more dumb. Like he said that he didn't ever do anything about the cheating thing to get revenge or anything, and the jealousy pushed him into going to whores. I watched the stream yesterday and he really seems to think he did nothing wrong and that going to whores just balanced the whole mess.

So how exactly is she being manipulative (I don't know anything about this except this video). But why are they even talking about this on stream lol? I think she makes a fair point to not air their private matters on stream.

first of all i literally already forgot what the beginning of the month drama was, but also this has nothing to do with rs, so why should it be on the rs drama calendar

Im so confused how she keeps spinning lies to work against him and he doesn't clear it up?

And how the fuck is he on the hook for twitter/twitch chat hate?

Is this the one he impregnated?

that feeling of anything i get will be lost at some point because i have quests where i have to drop my whole inventory left to do make me quit uim

You can't get 2 of the same item in one chest, but you could get all 4 items from the same set.
---
I think you have some of my loot from my last empty 25 runs. 
---
Not really. The fact that you can only make 14 potions an inventory and only gain roughly 150xp per at level 70. And you lose a lot of money on herb. And you have to clean herbs, make potion (u) which gives 0 xp, before you can actually gain xp.
---
With gauntlets and a stove near a bank, you gain levels so quickly. I remember getting to 85 from level 45 or so in 1 day just by cooking lobsters, and I didnt lose nears as much as I did going from 60-70 herb.
---
It's from her twitter she posted today which is 25th of February, 2019.

Getting 3 items is 1 in 1,063,830.

Getting the top 3 items is astronomical.

Maybe not exactly, but Jagex has spoke about how they do detect bots. For instance, one of the J Mods stated that they do know when you are connected to Team Viewer, which makes you wonder? Perhaps they know when you are using an altered client. Which would make the most sense in terms of initial detection.

I used the DPS calculator and the DPS seemed to be only a little bit less with full armadyl. Which of course means that i have to tank a few hits more, possibly couple more magic hits, but even then if armadyl can tank them most of the time it should be worth it. Right?

You're probably right about something else going on behind the scenes, but I don't think runelite collects user exchange data. Back when everyone was using osbuddy the ge prices were always super accurate and pretty much updated in real time. This is no longer the case, which is why i believe the numbers are getting a little wonky with less people to update them.

good info, friend; thank you!

you had the opportunity to say so many different things, or nothing at all, yet you made a conscious decision to be a douche.

 Imagine dragging 48000 of those around with you in a pouch...

yes.

If playing minigames was actually a more enjoyable way to play the game I am sure they would be more popular. Maybe all the people whining on reddit that no one plays minigames anymore can get together and play them
---
I did that too when they were buying for 2.7m or so last month. I have 20 saved.

I never liked the gauntlets in FoG because I felt like it took away from completing RFD, a challenging but highly rewarding quest 
---
Agreed, The Ardy diary + quests to Tree Gnome Village (The Grand Tree is short and gives lots of combat exp) + Fairytale 1 is a great early game goal to have that most people can achieve without being subject to a huge grind and provides ton of mobility.

If your strategy is to trust your dick to know what chicks aren't crazy good fucking luck.

What do you want them to do, it's legal... they have no reason not to smile at you

How does everyone know this stuff? I feel so out of the loop

So for all the people actually believing this is real. does anyone have an excuse for why the supposed police officers uniform doesn't actually have the Crest on the arm?
---
His mom told him also to get her the fuck off the stream because she keeps provoking him like a dog, teasing him and crying. That he could get fined for having her on live stream. His mom basically called her names and told him to get rid of that trash. 
---
no shit, do you want your son to get a gold hording SMOrc? 
---
Not sure if clues is the right place for those items. If the robe sets aren't cosmetic, it would make more sense to come from other content such as Warding, Quests, or Minigames.
---
Also, I'd kinda like to see the Gauntlets from Slayer like they did in RS3. It would make sense for Slayer to give both Boots and Gloves and the Gauntlets could slot in for some of the lackluster creatures.

I think it’s more showing just the tip. Of what the game has to offer

For getting banned from the game if i remember right? He had an unnecessary fight with his bird on stream which had nothing to do with runescape.

Yup it's very little money and I'm not losing any sleep over it, funny how negative the community instantly becomes. 
---
Gonna keep trying to pay it forward!

As far as I remember they were worse than rfd gloves statwise

Basically how I felt when someone pked me doing Mage Arena 2.  I dropped probably less than 20k value and had the Guthix boss down to like 10%. I think all they got was a super energy pot and like 40 blood runes?

I never played OSRS before so please pardon my noobish questions:
---
1) I live in SEA and I notice there are Australian servers. Are the servers physically located there? I started the tutorial but it seems there's a delay between when I click and the avatar moving. Is this the global 0.6s for everything or is it because the servers are in NA but labelled Australia to make it easier for people in the same timezone to gather? 
---
2) My UI is completely different than what I see on youtube/twitch. Not sure why =\
---
Pretty sure there are plenty of better ways to clickbait and get publicity that don’t involve framing your relationship as toxic and abusive...
---
They were but only slightly. Way easier to grind FoG than 175 QP

I'm a fairly new ironman that is nearing the end of my two week subscription. I've started out by doing a bunch of quests and I'm around 100 QP right now. I've opened the spirit trees and I was on my way to open up fairy rings but the roll for three items may be very terrible. I got a nature talisman for one of the three requested items from Malignius. 
---
As an ironman, I have to get this as a drop as it doesn't seem it is sold in any shops. The abyssal monsters drop it and it's on the gem drop table so sand crabs *might* be a good option. **Are there any other monsters that drop the nature talisman on their normal table?** I suspect this grind is going to suck as I'm only 46 combat and haven't really been gearing up yet since quests have been my main source of xp. I was going to gear up to green d'hide in the mean time as I don't want to invest in any armor before I get 40 defence. 
---
Stats right now are 45a/35s/31d, 25 range, 38 pray, 49 mage.
---
I was hoping it wasn't gonna last lol, ever since he got together with that hoe all the bad shit started happening.

You're actually reposting your own comments &amp; if that's not ironic I don't know what is

I think we should have a tool belt. Will be very useful.

A lot of people just desperately want to see him fail. He's still pulling decent viewership with low quality videos. If he starts making interesting ones again people will come flocking back.

I wish there was a more mature subreddit for this game. You can’t even read through posts anymore without coming across somebody circlejerking over poll results or other shitty drama that’s happening.

There's actually alot of Asians that play RuneScape obviously not as much as others but there are Asian players manly from places like Malaysia and Singapore. but I'm sure the market for Asian country's is out of the question due to the lower playerbase and I don't think too many ppl in Korea or Japan would be very interested in a game from 2002
---
What’s the point of streaming all this shit for? Take care of your business on your own. Sure does make a good stream when you get all the viewers hyped up talking shit and donating lol.

Regarding what was actually said though lmaooo both argue like high school or even middle school kids it’s embarrassing to watch.

I have 1k trout and a good number of salmon but with my current situation I can only get 4-6 leech kills before I get destroyed. It might be really helpful to get my hands on 43 prayer and a prayer potion. I just need to survive for 10 minutes then I have free reign.
---
I'm going to do Dragon Slayer for some extra defence and then go pick up full green d'hide and see if that really helps. My best weapon right now is a rune pick, haha. I honestly haven't done any combat on my account beyond quests.
---
And yes, XP is reduced in abyss. I do enough damage vs the leeches I just think I need some armor. Thanks for the help!

I forgot about falador patch. Yeah they have it all. Leave it as it is and I don't see why f2p shouldn't have farming. 
---
Also I’m an American currently studying in Thailand and I’d love to have a server I didn’t have 100+ ping to. 
---
They were only slightly worse defensively, but offensively they didn't even come close. I believe they had similar offensive stats to bronze gloves. 
---
As far as I remember they just added a little more gear variety and DPS to certain f2p accounts, which isn't necessarily a bad thing

Strawmanning and using that incel buzzword because you can't come up with a real counterpoint, how the fuck can I be an incel if I've had multiple long-term relationships and sexual partners?

If you want to use cannon I would advise using it during slayer for efficiency sake. If you want a cheaper and more afk alternative I would use a bone crossbow at a 4 crab spot at sandcrabs. 
---
Maybe reddit isn’t the place for you...
---
I think theres a mod reply/post somewhere saying you could potentially get all the items from one chest, the odds are just insanely astronomically preposterous for anyone to even come close. I'll see if I can find it if nobody beats me to it
---
fuck no

How is that different from world hopping over and over and buying the items over and over? Or just waiting it out?

Congrats, but fuck you for getting it at 60 agility. Took me until 93.

Your reward chance is based off the combined level of all the monsters you killed. IIRC max reward chance is 1012 kills. But as [RockLobster17 said](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aujfcv/so_this_happened_tonight_at_37kc/eh8xrfz/), if you want max rewards (assuming you did Morytania Hard *daddy* diary) you want a reward potential of 880.

If you are in twitch chat or Facebook or something and you press the key combo to auto type username/password KeePass will not key in your runescape credentials as long as you set up the entry correctly to be for runescape. That’s what I meant by it will check what window you are focused on. 
---
so do I? I still managed to get to 70 attack, 75 range, 72 mage, 55 prayer, 71 hp, 68 slayer, 68 defense, and 54 strength, plus 91 fletching over the last two months. Just play.

Do people pay membership/bonds for multiple characters (main, Ironman, pure, for example) or can you link multiple characters to one membership/account?
---
Might be a stupid question but I’m just a broke man trying to play my way through Gielinor.
---
Why?
---
I agree with this. Not every NPC needs to have an accompanying set for actual players. It's a lot cooler and more unique if NPCs have gear the player can't obtain because, you know, they are supposed to be unique and interesting individuals in the game world. If you can look just like them that takes away some of the scope of the game.
---
You are welcome
---
I’m not defending shit, you just sound like an incel. If it’s been 15 years I’m real sorry you’re a grown-ass man who is afraid of women and will die alone. Just get a vasectomy if you’re that distrusting lmfao.

MM2 definitely nice to get out of the way. You will be able to do it w/ safepots and high healing food for the cave part. I did it w/ 70 def and karambwans on my iron. Caves took a few attempts but well worth it.

I think adding some of the fog rewards as endgame f2p content might be a nice incentive to work towards with a view to getting p2p at the end. Currently the endgame f2p items come from dragon slayer, not much of a challenge stat or quest wise. 
---
Maybe for something like the spikeshields, whack a 50 defence and strength requirement on them, mid way to the next tier of viable p2p gear.
---
Not sure clue scrolls are the way of acquiring them though, perhaps an endgame f2p boss, not difficult, but not easy like the current ones. 
---
Most of my PvP is done in f2p, and so I'm fully aware that any releases need to be careful not to change the entire meta of PvP, people get very upset about it for some reason.

You would get about [one more nest per run](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hunter#Bird_house_trapping) switching to Magic birdhouses. This could help cover the costs of buying the Magic logs.

'Cute' isn't meant in a demeaning or condescending way in this context.  
---
  
---
It's more a team of endearment. Usually it's used to describe someone who is blissfully ignorant of the overall game. They're not jaded by the grind or efficiency-scape. They're innocently finding their way through the game usually in a non-efficient manner.  
---
If it helps when calling a player cute like this I'm not calling the adult male in the webcam cute, it's more that their character and behavior as seen in, or sometimes relating to, RuneScape is 'cute' as described above.

Im pretty sure you did the same thing to someone else in this thread though, something about them last commenting 3 weeks ago so you blocked them, saying that they only comment for arguments.

Underrated comment
---
Well, this is kinda awkward, but after reading your argumentsfor the mage and range hood, i thought to myself,"why not just wear the hat or coif then". I now understand that this applies to all of these scenarios. 
---
Let's just leave the hoods the way they are, it you want bonuses, just wear the hat.
---
Well yea, that's why he said until tormented bracelet, silly.
---
Oh no, SCP-3085 is leaking and taking new forms
---
It’s reddit you idiot, you make posts and get karma. He’s just doing it better than you.
---
You're wrong though. There are six rolls and you need to hit 3 of them in any order. You calculated as if there were only 3 rolls.
---
Check the wiki
---
I'm on mobile so I can't... :/
---
Did you just say “You have the right to *be* an attorney?” 
---
But that only applies to Helm and Shield. There is no Prossy Shield and no one wears the Prossy Helm... Also, if those items could be Steel, Adamant, Rune, Initiate, or Proselyte that would be a restricted cosmetic override, which is something that had a lot of opposition in the past.

then its kinda sad that people are more offended by my name than actual racists. This is an actual problem.
---
That is a good question since it isn't the most useful item. But it does have some places where it is useful and Vet'ion is not a very popular boss so not many coming into the game.
---
You see maybe his comment sounds stupid. But you yourself are stupid. So tomorrow he can say something not stupid. Tomorrow you'll still be stupid

It doesn't really cost anything

Its still fun getting unique items on mains but it sucks knowing you can just buy them in GE for like 10k. At least on ironman theres proof you got them yourself

a formal request to King Roald requesting thot banish proceedings could give you back custody of little karambwan. the proceeding usually consist of a follow up with Zavistic Rarve, headmaster of the Wizard’s Guild, to cast “thot banish,” and in some cases “thot smite,” on your ex-spouse. you may need to provide current gp/h statistics to settle on this agreement though. your personal infidelity shouldn’t be taken into account given you only partook in 20 minute sessions. in any case, best of luck to you. i hope you can be a good father to little karambwan. 
---
Issa copy pasta lol
---
Or you came across the few people that care about names and they didn't. Or you annoyed someone and they didn't. Or you pk and they don't. It happens. Just change the name and move on. What others are doing will never be an excuse for what you do.

I came to OSRS after having quit in ~2004 while playing Classic. I was fully aware of how little full mith meant.  
---
But I loved working towards it. I enjoyed that I started from nothing and built my bank enough to afford upgraded armor and weapons.  
---
I understand if that's not something you enjoy, but thrusting that much wealth onto a new player can deprive them of the chance to go through the grind and look back at what they've accomplished.
---
If the smite prayers are up then it’s drama!
---
Nope.
---
Its still A Friend
---
That's a really good question. I believe it would be considered rape if you agreed upon wearing a condom, and someone knowingly ignored the terms of that agreement. BC is simply a different contraceptive, but I feel that a condom also limits STI infection so I dunno

Don't worry, i saw the comment.
---
Awesome stuff though, keep going.
---
Exactly, even though mine can be taken as a sexual innuendo but id think of it as rather mild to others ive seen in game. But its more about the fact that people have racist names and dont get banned. Like that one guy who was rank 2 in dmm had to change his name from something really racist and he changed it to Fk Reddit or something like that cuz there was a reddit post about his name. Sad that jagex had a person that high on the hiscores without doing anything about it until reddit made an uproar.

What should my priorities upgrading melee gear be? Currently I have barrows gloves, a b ring (i), and just got my first fire cape. I have seen some upgrade trees in the past of what to prioritize such as tassets/prims/etc, but am not too sure.
---
I have a quest cape from a couple years ago, so quest gated content usually isnt a problem. 
---
pepega detected
---
Thing is even if I don't afk and do the corner method, it becomes more time efficient as I don't have to pick up the pots. So I guess it's just a matter of which thing I want to optimize
---
Yeah
---
I like arubberband's fashionscape
---
This is going to sound like I'm just complaining about bad rng, but hear me out,
---
Since the farming guild and getting the bottomless bucket i am convinced that herb yields have reduced. Using farm cape, 9 patches, hard kand/zeah, ultra compost, magic secs and attas. I've been very often getting 6 herb harvests on several patches each run (i assume the minimum yield) since using the bucket. After checking the previous harvest logs I've done prior to the release of the guild, i noticed getting 6 herb harvests was extremely uncommon.
---
But opposing this, i have had random luck and on occasion not seen a single 6 herb harvest in a farm run, and gotten 100+ herbs easily.
---
Maybe it is bad rng, but has anyone else found something similar happening to them?
---
Im at 690 and losing my mind lmao
---
Never go to the toilet killing wyverns.

That should give you plenty to do.

His Fremmy locked ironman is cringe-worthy bad. He really makes me appreciate what Settled does even more. You can tell he's just trying to do it without putting any effort in and it leads to him making stupid exceptions and stupid mistakes. It's better for youtubers to take a break and figure their shit out than it is for them to release half ass content, but I'm sure they want that irl GP.
---
Europe is a magical place where there's absolutely no freedom of speech and any guy (that isn't rich) can be arrested based on the words of one woman. 
---
"another" 
---
I forgot to mention, but it's probably obvious, that the sets are max melee Keris and Bludgeon.
---
Centering it on Bludgeon was why I asked for ideas.  It absolutely must maintain a significant lead on Keris.  Things such as turning Keris into a nuke with a spec/timeout will be a dangerous thing to even talk about with how finicky 07 players are with economical decisions, same for buffing it in any way.
---
Maybe the Bludgeon would be the item to get an upgrade.  There's a rather stabby looking bit on the bottom of it.  Maybe the Kalphites aren't weak to a Keris styled blade, but something about Keris that could be added to the Bludgeon to give it some extra punch.

tbh no one likes poor people

You wrote that yourself? wow congrats dude, really, that's very cool. i just told everyone in my family about it, everybody thinks that's very impressive and asked me to congratulate you. they want to speak to you in person, if possible, to give you their regards. they also said they will tell our distant relatives in christmas supper and in NYE they will ignite fireworks that spell your name. i also told about this enormous deed to closer relatives, they had the same reaction. they asked for your address so they can send congratulatory cards and messages. my friends didn't believe me when i told them i knew the author of this gigantic feat, really, they were dumbstruck, they said they will make your name echo through years and years to come. when my neighbour found out about what you did, he was completely dumbstruck too, he wanted to know who you are and he asked (if you have the time, of course) if you could stop by to receive gifts, congratulations and handshakes. with the spreading of the news, a powerful businessman of the area decided to hire you as the CEO of his company because of this tremendous feat and at the same time an important international shareholder wants to sponsor you to give speeches and teach everybody how to do as you did so the world becomes a better place. you have become famous not only here but also everywhere, everybody knows who you are. the news spread really fast and mayors of all cities are setting up porticos, ballons, colossal boom speakers, anything that can make your name stand out more and see which city can congratulate you the hardest for this magnificent feat.

I like how they just get their real estate license and all of a sudden they're the gods of construction.

it's the exact same thing as stealthing, which is rape by deception

This isn't the best example to make fun of America's justice system.

True that.

Its definitely just bad rng.

Theres civil law in the Netherlands though

3 or 4 def will suffice
---
Depends. Just don't do it in pk prime times and you'll be okay 
---
Living the dream. My gf is a pretty good gamer but she never got into RS much. Enjoying Apex together now tho! 
---
Potentially, but she’s still definitely in the house. I assume he can’t kick her out legally, or maybe doesn’t want to leave her stranded being pregnant with his kid. 
---
The rule was just meant to be she stayed down stairs, he stays upstairs.
---
Let's be real he has a lot more than just that
---
To go more in depth on the phase with blue in the middle top, you can't stand on the corner with a BP. You have to run up to the middle and sit a tile away from that cloud and attack mage from there.
---
After he shoots out all the snakelings and melee spawns in the middle, you can hit him once with your trident and then you have to run through that venom cloud before attacking again so you don't get melee'd.
---
If that's not clear, let me know and I'll try to explain better.
---
Draynor Manor no doubt.  Good vantage point, plenty of rooms for item spawns. Bottleneck entrances.
---
Wow its almost like having a huge population some people are bound to commit crimes. You act like if guns were gone we wouldnt have kids spaz out and kill people other ways or some people doing a blantant hatecrime. As for health care Im sure many people would argue theres pros and cons to each type but alas im sure whatever I say youll beat down with "hurr hurr your country just sucks"

haha you can think what you like sonny but the outside is quite a nice place this time of year

What if we had a forum that just updated daily with the drama. And when there isn't daily drama we could just put like memes and achievements and stuff.

something tells me this has to do with the seed vault not being implemented yet
---
I prefer the original client, why need handicaps for an already easy game?
---
You can technically avoid mage hits. It's how people without overheads complete zulrah kills. However, it is very inefficient and shouldn't be attempted.

He made it seem during the live stream that the main reason he did those things was because she pressured him to. So hopefully he will become a friend 2.0 after those whole shit is over

Joke's on you, I can't even grow a beard.

I genuinely couldn’t care less about A Friend’s breakup. Oh well, subreddit might be RuneScape related again in a few days.
---
I'm not even an iron and I'm fucking geeked for you.
---
That dude was so annoying, “hey guess what” for hours. 
---
Don't waste time killing snakelings unless you really have to (broken recoil or something). Just be sure to always have a fresh recoil when you tele in, or one with &gt;20dmg left. Sneklings will burn thru food but knowing the boss fight better will save you more food than killing them, and if you waste time killing them you're just setting yourself up to take more dmg from the boss. 
---
Bring a low item switch, don't forget your antivenom and recoil, and just focus on learning the boss. Watch guides etc. You should never take damage from its melee form, or range form (excluding jad phase), or smoke cloud damage once you have a good feel for the boss.
---
Was just a joke saw a pic with money from clues and gf so wanted to post we all kno how to get bonds.

Absolutely not.

He would have been a weird dude with or without RS. RS just made it so he can be a weird dude and make money doing it. The thing that concerns me is that he doesn't manage his money well - he spent it all on seeing some girl that was cheating on him. If he has money he'll be okay, but he's too anti-social to not get taken advantage of for the money he does have. Hopefully he's learned from this and recommits himself to making good content as RS is one of the few positive things this guy has in his life and he's been doing his best to ruin that too.
---
Now there's an idea
---
To pay respects 
---
This pains me greatly
---
Its just personal preference really. 
---
I like having a couple of handy tools ready to use at all times. 
---
Plus I like being nosey while I'm skilling and just look peoples stats up without having to go to the actual website. Lol
---
Eeeee he’s salty :D :D :D
---
Thank you!
---
All "rape test" kits do is show if sex happened.  It has no bearing on whether or not that sex was consensual.  Calling it a "rape test" is incredibly misleading.
---
R u trying to be a yew?
---
No lol.
---
resisting urge to fanboy.
---
So you're saying use mage on his blue form, even though he has higher defence from it?  If that's what you're saying then it makes sense and I gotcha
---
To the top you go
---
U can use it anywhere likw fishing or woodcutting
---
It's actually really sad, I feel sorry for him like we all know what we were like before we matured. 
---
Poor guy fucked everything up cause he didn't know how to handle a relationship.

No I booked my ethuanasia appointment already so that's not needed anyway.
---
Ah I forgot Astral Runes xD good work mate. Do you have a video about these?

I lead this whole thing in an Indian ascent.

Just train your combat through slayer, the order you do it in is rlly up to you.. I would say 70 att if u buy a whip, do that first.

It doesnt take up a potential item slot. You'll most likely get less runes though.
---
I'm not a fan of the Wrath rune or other combination runes like mud or lava, or the Astral rune. I went with the classic set from early 2005

I see clifford's pawprints and weewee in ur pic

What are you implying?

Elidnis help me
---
That he doesn't get the value of earning the GP. I get that. I dont know any fucking person that wants to legitly grind out 10m in the starting levels. The starting grind us trash. I guess guy legitimately likes doing that stuff so maybe he qill enjoy it all but theres a reason everyone does waterfall quest right away and that one with the blurite sword. Even if he were to look at a guide it shows him how to skip all that bs. 10m is nothing nowadays. Back in the day besides party hats n shit i dont know one item that would be 1b plus except the elysian, that was always pricey. Nowadays everything is 1-30m. That 10m aint shit, itd help him get into the game rather than get burnt out killing cows getting nowhere..

Maybe it means something
---
i mean, i live in england, you know the amount of times some kid goes crazy and stabs up a school? not actually that many, sure we have knife crime but atleast going to school is fucking safe for us. you get hate crimes everywhere but the english stopped killing people for being fucking gay a long ass time ago, now we just have to shut down the fucking reprobates that support EDL. america doesnt absolutely suck like syria and shit but this fucking mug is spitting out "hows that freedom taste commie" and you're gonna sit here and give me shit for tearing him down lmao. as for healthcare, we might have to wait to see a doctor but the fact i wont be turfed out on my ass if i dont have insurance or charged an absolutely disgusting amount for an ambulance ride means i really wouldnt ever want privatised healthcare, its even created this whole fucking tinhat paranoia about "big pharma" that americans constantly spout as if everywhere has privatised healthcare and my doctor is just trying to sell me pill which doesnt make any fucking sense cause i dont have to pay for my pills the same way you do. you can say what you like if you want but its not going to make me want to live anywhere in america over somewhere nice and chill like the netherlands where people are statistically very happy. i dont really agree with america being the eternal war machine either but thats just me

poor bait 2/10

What makes you so sure?

It sounds fucking retarded man

I feel like an idiot for not knowing this, but what in the hell in swampletics?

For friends who do stuff together
---
You'd just send them all to a specific part of the minimap when you get in(regardless of where the characters are), since you can see the whole place on a map iirc.
---
It'd take 5-10 sec to cycle through but I think you could pull it off.
---
I'll kinda a lazy person, but if the price is high enough I'll get off my butt and make some for people. $4 each for unpainted raw prints, $6 each for painted and sealed prints (with $7 shipping).
---
Expensive, I know, but like I said it would have to be enough money to make it worth my time, haha. There are other cheaper and possibly better ones over on Etsy
---
And also osrshd
---
Yeah, I'd like a source on that please. Sounds like you've never stepped foot in Europe
---
I can't remember the exact details, but I believe the gambling site gave him both real money/bit coins AND in-game gold to sponsor them.  He took both and admitted to it in the same clip he promoted them.  Taking the in-game gold qualifies as RWT iirc, so Jagex perm banned all of his accounts because of the severity of it.
---
You're not cheated. You're just a second rate fucker. 
---
He was the 'experienced high level' Jmod right? RIP game balance from here on in
---
That's because I don't have a life
---
Lol, I don't think he's smart enough to come up with something as convoluted as what's going on. Sometimes reality is stranger than fiction.
---
If this whole thing really is fake then Dovy and his pet troll are fucking good actors.  That whole stream was a perfect example of an unhappy, insecure relationship.  I think he was just being really blatant about everything because he wanted validation from his viewers that she really was mistreating him.  
---
Also make them use the ge but only able to buy for market price :)
---
Yeah they're in the Netherlands where men are even more fucked than the USA. Wouldn't be surprised if he somehow ends up charged with something or having to giver her a bunch of cash 😂
---
I agree but that list is just 5-10 cast. When you have a stack of 10 nechs it’s gets clustered. Once again if you set your notification at 8k you could miss 7k coins. Your a idiot. 
---
No. Run to the middle area and use blowpipe on the blue form. Once red form spawns, hit him with your trident once then run through the clouds and hit him again.
---
impossible
---
Just drop it and do another easy, noone will ever know
---
I got a triple drop a while back at like 70 kc, was nowhere near this good of a drop though.
---
Idk if it's a redemption arc at this point. 
---
I feel your pain (literally).

Just a really good joke
---
plz

Yeah a friend is just cringe here, not in the wrong, she just needed to fuck off it's pretty simple

Hello it's me, A Bachelor.

Confirmed, iron men get better rng
---
That was suggested the other day and I wasn't a fan of that just for Steel, Addy, and Rune. Extending to more armors just makes the problem worse; it uses a lot of different armor colors with some being similar/same as existing armors, and you wouldn't know what armor the player is wearing. I'm not sure if seeing someone in Purple and Green armor and thinking it is some new armor or wondering if it is Rune, Prossy, or such is something we want in OSRS.
---
yeah his fans have forgiven him selling out already and everyone pretends nothing ever happened, kinda like pretending mommy and daddy still love eachother after breaking up but you know how it is
---
I'd have to take both capes out and test them. I'll submit a bug report when I get home, granted I should have done it when it occurred.
---
If Zulrah goes into her range phase and shoots snakelings/ venom clouds out instead then you can pray mage because Zulrah won’t attack you during that phase. This negates a lot of the damage taken from the mage snakelings. Autumn Elegy has a really good guide explaining how to do this.
---
Doing herb runs daily on multiple accounts with no noticeable loss of yield. Plus Jagex is super above board when it comes to nerfing rates. Wouldn't make sense for them to nerf this without saying something.
---
i think (hope) they know that and are just making a joke 
---
Honestly I loved the lawlessness in that chat because that type of thing happens so rarely on twitch. Based mods.
---
imagine this in dmm
---
From the site;
---
&gt; We know that 99% of you just aren't good enough to best Zuk and beat the Inferno. That's why we've made this. This is one Infernal cape you can flaunt without needing to get good.
---
This is what happens when game additions are based on the opinion of a somewhat conservative community. Ofc they're going to move on to a company where they can better use their knowledge and abilities, can excel and make more of their career. 
---
That being said, I'm totally fine with this. Never a new skill :)

How longs it been since you checked yer gardens?

Iirc he already said he is moving back to Lithuania so i doubt it

10 degrees is practically barbados to me, like its cold here in england but its also a really nice sunny day, warm enough to smack a hoodie on and have the back door open

Hate people with this argument. Dude doesn't deserve to have his life picked through because douche bags on the internet.
---
Naaaah, it's a destination for me. My character is only level 50 something, so this will force me to stop skilling
---
No court has a 100% proof standard. Criminal court is beyond a reasonable doubt which doesn't have a hard definition but is self explanatory. Civil court is preponderance of the evidence which is 51%.
---
I feel like she probably won't get into trouble unless she has a history of this stuff. It's just not worth the police's time to get overly involved in domestic disputes because they have more important stuff to deal with. But I didn't see what she did and it probably depends how much he goes after her for doing it too.
---
Your character goes idle when you put in your pocket or he logs out after 10minutes of no inputs. 
---
Have u even done mm2 yet?
---
From this I can tell that you don't live in The Netherlands. In The Netherlands we don't do half-assed shit, you need hard evidence, and even then the punishments are mild af. High chances are they won't plea him guilty, if there even is a case. Absolute worst case scenario is that he needs to do community service for like a few hours. Oh, and jail sometimes looks even better here than some college dorms.
---
And go away
---
if you use bp  you should he able to kill vorkath. looking at 1 kill a trip though with your stats. 
---
Not reallt talking about a nerf so much as a possible bug. Are you using the bottomless bucket + attas on those accounts?
---
I just found a post that got decent attention that describes the same experience that I'm having. I'm more convinced than not that there is a bug
---
For Zalcano-
---
&gt;While you do this, she will do everything she can to fight back and will have a variety of abilities at her disposal. 
---
To combat continued advancement of individual skill in players in PvM combat I propose one of these phases be Zalcano just spewing excessive amounts of stick traps that players must navigate to re-engage in the boss. 
---
How many darts should I take to fight caves? I will use adamant at 75 ranged.

Looks amazing but I will still vote no cause I hate questing.

Should have added the part where he plays the crab rave music after she finally leaves. Lost my shit when he did that.

Well #BelieveHer so if you had consensual sex which she regrets, you’re gonna get booked for rape.

Better than all the settled spam. At least these posts are entertaining.

I've been called both before, just never at the same time.

No, that's mod Bruno who is maxed and completed the inferno fairly early

His new HCIM account, A Dumbass, where he trains and does everything in the least efficient way possible. 
---
I got the mail without my shoes on and almost cried when I got back inside.
---
I’ll take it of your hands if you don’t want it. ;)
---
I like to keep my str at least 5 levels above the rest, then train attack, and then def as having that higher str and att makes the def training faster.
---
Maybe vote yes for some of us that like questing ❤️
---
Well, in away it would help people because they wouldn't be sucked in the computer.
---
Of course it's kinda funny but it will get a friend even more into trouble
---
Gamer==incel so yeah

maybe at ge?

Europe has insane speech laws.

I'm a metalworker and we have a few people rotate in and out each month and only have like 100 people between 3 shifts and 2 plants. Totally different industry but the rate at which we see osrs mods leaving doesn't strike me as high turnover.

Baa

Who tf is even on twitter in 2k19

Vorkath is not gonna be good money with bp and those stats tbh. I'd go for zulrah instead if you want to make money, otherwise slayer.

swampletics is the name of an ultimate ironman account that is limited to the morytania area, made by a guy called Settled. he makes youtube content and swampletics is his current project.
---
its a nice cake but that dragon scimmy you put wrong way triggers me terribly
---
He died though 😢
---
Keep strength 10 levels above att/def for optimal training.
---
Testimony is testimony, its not evidence of something taking place, its a claim that something is taking place.
---
"Its not circumstantial because its not circumstantial" also called "begging the question" or "circular reasoning" 
---
That's not how a confidence interval works. Those are used when estimating parameters (such as the mean) based on samples from an unknown distribution.
---
This is calculating a probability from a known distribution, so your 95.18% means on average, ~5 out of 100 people will not receive an item after 47 kc.

Half the people here are autistic, suprised the retard even commented in the first place

I clicked on the link and thought it was Settled's UIM content

disappointment :/

Ah possible but I'd think unlikely. I'm using Kronos rn so maybe a bug with the attas.
---
For me it's one of those things you get told to watch by your friends and never end up watching

OH MY GOD

If anyone dares vote no i'll fucking kill you

Not really. At least we can curse on tv

I know lol, obv healthier to take needed breaks

LMFAO 73 HAHA!!!

WHERE WE DROPPIN BOOOIIIIIIISS?!?!?!

This is the right response, but also we will never get the facts from her perspective.

But, if I think about it honestly what percentage of the female population would want to spend time with this guy if he was dirt poor? It's not a lot.
---
Access to the red light district

Allright so Zulrah is worth it and doable with these stats?

yeah i'm 4 at 51... this just feels unfair.  I'm also 161 dry on Rex.

I never thought I'd run into a full blown incel on this sub. Thank you and nice post history btw you should make multiple accounts FTFY
---
You can't tell me that this can be topped. I have a hard time believing anything for the rest of the year could top this.
---
Gauntlet would have been much more appealing to “me” if it could be a potential team based challenge, and solo if you so please. 
---
So I wish I focused on this when I started my OSRS account, but a great goal is to get   [Culinaromancer's](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Culinaromancer%27s_Chest) gloves. That way, you can try to scale the gloves with your combat/monster hunting level and ability. 
---
Sounds like you should just skip in that case rather than vote no for personal reasons.
---
Ahaha thank you and sorry! I didn’t plan on making the scimmy until the end and it was a bit rushed 
---
A lot of good stuff, the new pick and axe would be sick but I don't think it will gonna pass.
---
Right, but it's disabled in the wilderness for obvious reasons. And to me it sounds awesome to be able to wear both at the same time. The only problem is that a keepsake chest or whatever to turn in-game items to cosmetic items costs money.
---
Makes sense, thanks! Another question if you have time: is there any way of telling when she’s going to do the mage &gt; range &gt; melee combo she always does at the start? 
---
Unlucky
---
I'm more curious about what the lowest possible attack level is after questing, do you happen to know? 
---
Addy darts are pretty cheap, I'd just buy 1k so you don't need to worry about it.
---
Can we keep the herb patch question, and renove the hosidius herb patch instead?
---
We have no herb patch in the elven lands, but hosidius alone has 2 of them (the regular one and the one in the farming guild), which IMO is too much.
---
Yea
---
I'm into it 
---
As opposed to whom? If you're talking about America then you're just misinformed. Different channels have different ratings, and there are plenty that have swearing.
---
Thank God the herb patch is gone.
---
Have they put out any of the reqs for song of elves quest besides mournings end 2?
---
Lol hurt. 
---
Why do people think this?
---
I mean he left the stream on for attention.  I won't deny that.  However the drama doesn't look fake.
---
I’ve stated this somewhere else, but my password is not leaked through a database.
---
Honesty we need a weekly drama calendar not monthly.
---
the rng gods were on your side!!
---
Sounds like you two have a great relationship
---
Were you member or nonmember? I attempted this and got to around level 30. Next thing I know I got maxed by a mage and didnt even have time to eat lol. 
---
I hate
---
Yikes
---
I'd just keep training until 90+ everything. You dont really need a lot of money at those stats and the money is too slow to justify the time spent. Your stats are easy enough to level up to be worth more than gear upgrades
---
Could we possibly get an upgrade to the crystal bow in some form? It's one of of the most iconic weapons in Runescape that really needs some attention.
---
I love hydra. I got 95 a week or two ago and I've been having a lot of fun with it.
---
gf
---
? Pretty sure it was based off runescape, similar to maple trees, steel, Romeo and Juliet do I need to go on
---
Reminder that these two are bringing a child into the world GG's dovy, you played yourself.
---
To be fair the dock looked fucking stupid 
---
Can make it back quick at zulrah. Gl dude.
---
yeah it’s very click intensive but once you get to chins with runelite client it ain’t so bad 
---
You don't, you just leave them on. 
---
Have a downvote, retard
---
Must've been pretty convenient for your account to get all that prayer and mage xp
---
If this faked drama hype is enjoyable to you then you have the personality of a cardboard box
---
Ye but who the fuck is that lol
---
Alch yourself  because it's going to pass 
---
In my opinion anyone who is stupid enough to drop all their items on the ground because a stranger told them to deserves to be scammed. 
---
Gz! Gravedigger event is always nice /s
---
in terms of proximity, the Catherby and east of Ardougne patches are much closer than the 2 on Zeah
---
There's room for multiple shit. Shorten it down to A Friend Breakup.
---
You could easily add pics of Lumbridge, Level 2 defence and A Friend, with the text "Unpolled Pub/Dock, broken pures, A Friend Breakup".
---
Oh I thought this vid was when they broke up
---
Did she know she was doing it all on video?
---
Oh ok. But these runes look sick, nice job with them!
---
I'm just claiming that's its popular in that it's something that seems to attract a fair bit of users in a game where being an ironmen locks you account of a good bit of stuff. I wouldn't have expected the number to be anywhere above 20%, but the point is that there's enough players willing to play that sort of account on an MMO that arguing "people play MMO's to interact with people" as a justification to not add some solo content is a bit unfair when we have a population of players that specifically play in a way that they don't have to interact with people - especially after we've had some very major group content added to the game recently with a lot of BIS items.
---
People use Justiciar for its set effect though, not just the pure defensive bonuses. 
---
What happened first? 
---
Her giving a hand job, or him sleeping with 3 hookers?
---
Good 
---
I like to think that the quantity is just how infused a single rune is. Like in your inventory you don't see a stack of runes with a number like you see with GP, you see a single rune with a number. Like that one rune can cast four thousand times. I know that's not the case, there's too much evidence otherwise, but I can still have my head canon
---
Boy that was a lot of mental gymnastics. Please don't put words into my mouth, thanks. No, by my logic people should take responsibility for their actions and use contraception if they do not wish for a child. Abstinence is not the only choice, as there are condoms, pills, and yes in the extreme there is surgery. Pregnancy is a choice in this day and age, end of story. If you accidentally have a kid today, you are an idiot.
---
thanks for linking it
---
Europe has lots of laws that are hundreds of years old but nobody cares about until someone's like "hey maybe we should delet dis"
---
Don’t we all
---
Honestly I feel kind of bad for him at this point. Makes me think all the terrible decisions that led to his downfall were all because of the terrible influence from his girlfriend.
---
Entertaining post history thanks for that. You should make highlights of your worst comments so we don't have to look for them. Truly a degenerate.
---
At some point we have to stop "upgrading" armor's and weapon's we have and start making new ones. This will only make armadyl and Bandos equipment more of a requirement then a choice. Having a Crystal Sword/Warhammer and a crystal staff will make this an good addition because right now there is only two choices for "best in slot": Void and Bandos/Armadyl.
---
Is there a way to "afk" chins?
---
Dont really feel like paying that much attention and having to move a tile etc every other second
---
No that makes no goddamn sense considering the crystal shield requires 70 defense and 50 agility. Dumbest thing I’ve read all morning. 
---
&gt;UK
---
&gt;Netherlands
---
Hmm, something isn't adding up here
---
*Oops, misclicked decline.* Scam.
---
In many places, it's legally considered rape or sexual assault to lie about birth control.
---
A Swiss man was charged with rape for secretly removing a condom while having sex with someone.
---
I'm genuinely asking if this is similar.
---
got 2 in 75 clues. sorry not sorry.
---
Good stuff
---
Don't tell them that the Priff layout functionality is very similar to RS3's haha. The mining, farming, combat etc are all in the same spots as RS3's.
---
I DEMAND A POLL TO ROTATE IT 90 DEGREES
---
Can’t you go back to the zulrah and get your items back for cheap?
---
Revs
---
I meant the heraldic recolor for shield and helm. But fair enough.
---
Agility pet after training agility... Thats rare fam
---
“Go to waterfall and skip all of that”
---
What do you mean “skip all of that.  Waterfall gives you 13k atk and str experience.  You get to skip killing cows for an hour and a half hours.  Not sure how that’s a valid point to what you are trying to say.  
---
And “10 fucking mill” is a lot of money for a brand new player.  I remember having no clue what to do for money and picking flax to see my first 100k.  My point is that this guy doesn’t need to earn money for a long time and now money AND items he’s receiving are just gonna make the game less exciting.  The small discoveries are already lost to him. 
---
“No one I see plays like the old days” 
---
Uhh Ironman and ultimate Ironman? 
---
Stop trying to act like people giving this guy their banks doesn’t somehow take away from the excitement of learning new things and earning your own money.  
---
No, rape tests contain the following:
---
Bags and sheets for evidence collection
---
Swabs for collecting fluids from the lips, cheeks, thighs, vagina, 
---
anus, and buttocks
---
Sterile urine collection containers
---
Sterile sample containers
---
Blood collection devices
---
Comb used to collect hair and fiber from the victim’s body
---
Clear glass slides
---
Self-sealing envelopes for preserving the victim’s clothes, head 
---
hair, pubic hair, and blood samples
---
Nail pick for scraping debris from beneath the nails
---
White sheets to catch physical evidence stripped from the body
---
Documentation forms
---
Labels
---
Sterile water and saline
---
And generally examiners will be able to identify signs of assault and gather an overall account of the assault if possible.
---
So that's not just a matter of whether sex happened, but whether it happened, who it happened with, DNA evidence from the victims skin, clothes **and** underneath fingernails, as well as getting an immediate account of the assault and keeping all evidence correctly stored.
---
Now obviously this doesn't necessarily prove rape, but it gathers a huge amount of evidence that's comparable to the standard expected of many other crimes.
---
Should probably do ds2 on my iron meme soon. With rcb+amethyst bolts/blessed dhide and like 86 range am I just going to breeze through it or is it still gonna be tough? I really don't feel like grinding for a bp.
---
I don't see anyone making fun of him.  Mostly people who are commiserating with him, some of whom have been in this situation before.  I know I have.  It's refreshing to see someone escape it.  I wish him the best genuinely
---
I love me some memes bro how bout you
---
What about passwords about specific dates with added hexadecimal
---
For example 2001911506c616e65
---
It's not that hard to memorize and should be pretty safe. Maybe add a @ or # at start and finish or something
---
Tell me about it man. I have 19kc and still don't have any full sets. Rubbish! lol, sarcasm
---
Why not
---
Didn't know better but also completely his fault? I don't think the dick in crazy was completely his fault. I think he's an easy target for manipulation given his lack of life experience and the fact that he makes money. That's why I do feel bad for him. But I hope he learns from this, it'd be hard to feel bad for him making the same mistakes going forwards.
---
The banned for gambling thing was really dumb of him, but whatever he can just make a new account.
---
For being a 27 year old man child. I think he should be an example of why you have to grow up and not spend all od your time scaping. I do feel bad for the guy. But this is bound to happen to anybody who hasnt had any life experience but play runescape and browse reddit. 
---
id drop in varrock and go for the spades from general good store. 
---
Uluvboobs
---
yeah, for free, but i must have died after killing it because of vemon 
---
I'd disagree.
---
6:06 subtitles says that Dovydas spies a dragon at the bar
---
Great video! Do you have a goal for the account? It'd be cool to see you working towards something and having your progress helped/hindered by the wheel
---
Mod who?  Says it all pretty much
---
you must be new here
---
Yeh, we have enough herb patches as is.
---
That said, would it be possible to consider other types of farm patches? 
---
 - Hops/bush/additional special
---
It isn't a random event. It's the final boss of the quest "troll romance"
---
Yeah, people seem to think it's meant to be the #1 drama of each month. It's meant to include all drama of note. This month is gonna be stacked with 3 entries currently.
---
This show makes the exception that you actually have to watch it lol. Its such a funny show
---
Try this on for size
---
https://twitter.com/antisemitismeye/status/1099321644861009920?s=21
---
But then we wouldnt get to watch
---
It is enjoyable because the alternative is spam posts about settled’s stupid uim series and those are fucking annoying. So yeah, I’m perfectly content. 
---
I don't think you'd wear the whole crystal armour like you would justiciar, you'd use it like you used Bandos now, to have higher range defence, but now with 0 negative's to magic. 
---
It's chestplate has +31 range defence over Bandos without the -15 to magic attack 
---
Ahhhh so you killed her and then left. Yeah that’s mighty unfortunate. Sounds like you shouldn’t be hit too hard based on your gear but still a shame
---
What nobody is mentioning is Twitch chat was being utterly cancerous during this and it should’ve gotten shut down. The verbal abuse hurled at her was pretty disgusting whether you  think she’s a shit person or not. Seeing thousands of people watching and a literal text-walls of “Kill Her” and “Abort the Baby” was pretty horrifying. 
---
Possible but it just seems fishy that it was his first full time stream and all the drama seemed so manufactured. For a while they were just sitting down smiling reading donations and twitch chat
---
The kebos one requires hosidius favour, so it's still tied to it.
---
Everyone, be sure to reserve your Prifddinnas-Only UIM account names!!
---
Full hp prayer and run is whats satisfying
---
They will still be in Europe, just not in the EU. 
---
holy shit was not expecting that
---
You do know that the EU=/=the entire continent of Europe, right?
---
Was actually on my normie! I was doing slayer on my uim and decided to get some bond money on my normie and this happened.
---
Why the fuck would you drop your valuable items on the ground? You have to be retarded to fall for these
---
Uatu only watches
---
Unironically using epic......
---
I ain’t. Just perpetually disappointed with my peers 
---
Always man, I’m not an animal

Oh uhh.. that's just Thessalia's sister who is visiting the desert from Varrock to learn about desert fabrics but she has found herself in this predicament.
---
495-570nm
---
Oh how the mentality has shifted. I'd rather have new armor (that's useful) but literally everyone was against devaluing other shit. 
---
No they didn't you dumb motherfucker lmao. Go back to shooting your schools up

He needs to close his curtains and point a lamp on the wall in front of him  you can't see him at all.

don't mind me just an unpopular opinion passing through

Wasn't he becoming less edgy and his cancerous fan base can't take it?
---
USA: This female claims you are the father. We will be court summoning you and garnishing your wages until you submit to a DNA test.
---
Oh, looks like it's a likely match. We're gonna retroactively garnish a couple more months as well btw.
---
Oh wait sorry, that test we did last year was incorrect. We're not reimbursing you btw! :\^)
---
Happened to a friend last year. If we got invaded by Japan or China, I'd just let it happen.
---
Oh haha, but really what were the details
---
&gt;The Netherlands has a law on inciting hatred.
---
We arent the only one. You make it sound like its a bad thing.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech#Netherlands
---
How it went down was pretty confusing especially if you weren’t there at the start of it. Plus at one point he made the straw poll asking if he should break up with her or stay with her but he just worded it poorly; he was using that to demonstrate to her that people agreed with him that he should leave her.
---
When the stream started he had already told her she was being kicked out but could stay for a few days.
---
As long as you have a high enough combat level so as not to downscale the raid under 115 combat i wouldnt mind personally. Others may be scared of "semi-leech" unique snipes however but there's no harm in asking if you can tag along and prep to gather resources.
---
I suggest VH1 or MTV. 
---
Nice account
---
He started getting into shit after he started dating her. It seems like she could easily be the roots of his issues, he changed a lot. It could easily not be too, but don't just jump on a hate train, he is clearly not having a good time and that woman is definetely crazy
---
literally what gap?? an armour for people with 70 defence that for some reason cant wear barrows yet they have a grandmaster quest complete? no this isnt filling a gap its just tanky armour that increases your accuracy over other tank armour for no reason.
---
id like for them to specialize it more like make it tankier than karils but less accuracy bonus, this is just melee barrows gear that works with range and its an awful idea
---
Name checks out
---
RED ALERT BROTHERS, A GRIL
---
10/10 would make 0.6s eye contact with on street and then fixate on the rest of the day
---
And an upvote from me!
---
I didn't deny shit dumb fucks, I said I'm sorry? Implying that it doesn't matter
---
blows one's mind how someone can possibly get a 99 without a party and a reddit post.
---
This guy understands
---
I thought it was fake.  Came to comments to joke about it.  
---
You might need some medication
---
Yo ive been missing my bed! Thanks forgot where I was parked
---
Frankly I don't even care, I've not watched his videos in years. I was just trying to bring a bit of positivity in the mix.
---
From her [assignment list](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar_quo_Maten/Slayer_assignments), I would probably block Black Demons, Fire Giants, Kalphite and Hellhounds.
---
Escape from Troll Stronghold
---
Well I was asking the hottest girls on the actual strip where they overcharge so maybe that's why but I'm not lying. I'm talking about Amsterdam here.
---
I've always pronounced it like "Ardigan" as in rhymes with "Cardigan"
---
I got my first master clue from my 3rd ever hard clue in November, and I've only finished it around 2 weeks ago. I had to grind to 80 crafting (from ~60) so that I could boost and make a black dragonhide set in Entrana; in retrospect, I should've asked someone else make it. I also had to purchase a brine sabre, obby shield and pharaoh's sceptre. All for a 400k reward.
---
Prove someone wrong then it turns into I am dumb and need medication. Ahh the internet
---
&gt; Even if he has the money, he would be way behind in life in everything else.
---
Yeah and you can safely feel good about yourself knowing you have everything in life but money, while b0aty spins his wheels playing video games for money.
---
Oh, trust me; I've seen it. Aside from the whole being suspended over a massive hole part instead of, you know, being on the ground, it is pretty nice. But I'd expect OSRS to go with a different vibe, even if it is full crystal.
---
66 prayer, 66 defence, 78 ranged and 76 hp

The worst that has happened to me is waking up to dreams of me login-in to see my accs hacked/cleaned.

I need to talk myself it's a dream to chill kek
---
I like It myself, I can’t stand the skill as it is rn
---
Yeah my record is 7. I usually get around 5 like once a day. And then on my herb runs I can get like three done. But im 99 farming.

They're both fucking crazy.
---
I'm not saying A Friend isn't wrong in trying to break up, but he was clearly being a prick as well.
---
Do we even have her side of the story?
---
You died, a hacker would leave nothing. All the items you kept where untradable/three highest value.
---
That’s a fact, I agree, but it doesn’t mean calling something “stupid” just to justify your opinion
---
I’m aware but if your gonna bring your best gear into the wilderness and not be careful you are an idiot. As long as they made it so there wasn’t a sword gloves or boots that were transparent you would just have to be paying attention to make sure you know what you are clicking on. As you always should while in the wilderness
---
I'd change your password anyway.
---
All those extra patches must be nice
---
I feel bad for him, shitty Runescape stuff he did aside. Those types of relationships are the type of shit that makes a guy try men for awhile.
---
Jagex, remove the body rune from this painting because clearly nobody gives a fuck about them
---
Haha of course you can, have fun being gutted by a traitorous government while thinking you have more freedom than Europe. Have fun getting bankrupted from an illness. Have fun being run by literal Russian stooges lmao. Whatever shit mess the UK is in, the US is a million times worse
---
Logically, a correlating skill.
---
Woodcutting for firemaking and construction. 
---
Fishing for cooking.
---
Mining for smithing. (Might also be other way around, they just prefer mining over smithing)
---
The game
---
You must not have a lot of life experience if you can watch this and actually think it’s scripted. Go outside
---
your sample size is way to small to draw any conclusions. i have not noticed a difference in my farm runs with the bucket. got a few pbs on herbs/patch since the update tho. i think its just a bad string of rng my dude.
---
My thoughts exactly. Up until now, all we’ve had is the gate/walls to imagine what priff might look like. It’s a bit disheartening to see the design we know changed, regardless of how your or my rendition of Priff might look like
---
Europe doesn't throw people in jail.
---
https://i.imgur.com/sHt5q.jpg
---
I feel the same way about the gate and city walls. Obviously it's still WIP, but the original structure is just so hard to top imo. Even almost 15 years later, it holds up remarkably well and is definitely worth preserving. It's become a huge part of its identity over the years, much like other unfinished pieces such as Castle Drakan have become integral to the area they're in.
---
The crystal/wooden concept is a fun idea too, and I'd certainly love to see that theme explored more within the city itself.
---
ok but why not use the more graphical version of the calendar?
---
No this is not good, it is amazing.
---
i chortled in public. i feel your pain brother
---
I haven't yet heard from someone who doesn't want this update... it's due to pass with flying colors. 
---
Aren't demonic gorillas good money?
---
Is the 15x higher chance for a pet at 200m xp scaling, or flat? As in do you get a higher chance as you go from 13m &gt; 50m &gt; 100m etc, or does the 15x multiplier only come in to play at 200m?
---
It goes idle when it stops fishing, mining, woodcutting ect.
---
Yes, I could have. That would help some more, of course. That's a study you can do, take my numbers and see if the cost of chefs delight would pay for itself.
---
So Silverhawk boots?
---
You can't sell quickly for a decent price, nor can you buy big amounts quickly because of very low trade limits.
---
You should look at black d'hide bodies.
---
The point is if you have hundreds of passwords it is not feasible to remember them all.
---
Using a password manager is a secure way to create a unique password for all of your accounts.
---
Actually I do have real life experience and that is how I know it is fake. I dont just sit on the internet all day believing everything i see with no life other people here
---
He's dealing with all this shit and she's probably gonna walk away without any repercussions
---
I'm really sorry to hear that :(
---
I just insured it an hour ago. I'm glad I didn't lose it before I learned about insuring it. 
---
I don't think she let him know until it was too late

Meet prisonletics my prison locked ultimate Ironman 
---
Soft clay rocks at level 70 mining and behind a grandmaster quest seems dead on arrival, what's the point of that? A new grandmaster quest should have me rubbing my hands together thinking "Ohhh I can't wait to do that quest so I can unlock...." ....unlock soft clay? Is this targeted at ironmen? Because I don't feel like it could be useful for anyone else. Even bots have better things to do with their time lol.
---
I initially thought the armor was a very lackluster power level for the requirements, but if more crystal weaponry is being considered that could actually be pretty decent (if nothing else, it'd probably still be decent with the bow).
---
Crystal tools don't look worth the degrade investment. I get what they're going for because they wanna have something cool for zalcano without having too huge an impact on skilling, but they look suuuper lackluster.
---
These are some of the most well made irl runes ive seen
---
Thats a hairy dong
---
I'm in a similar boat, only no D Axe from Wintertodt and a bit higher KC probably. Kinda annoyed that I still haven't finished the outfit but I got a pet so I guess that is fair...
---
Sometimes when i’m trying to find something in my notes or a textbook I have the urge to Ctrl + F.
---
So the takeaway is that you should do something else for money then make wines?
---
Someone needs to do the bar crawl
---
She doesn't give you a Black Demon task in the Crash Site Cavern meaning you cannot slay Demonic Gorillas for her tasks.
---
It'd definitely be worth your time to make some ruby bolts at the very least. They'll be better than anything else in the first 3 phases since you can just take huge chunks out of the guy's final HP bar.
---
I did it around 73 range with blessed d'hide, so you should be perfectly fine.
---
literally anything else
---
If you went and watched a 10 second clip you could’ve answered this question yourself and avoided being an ass about it

Ah, increased deflection, you even threw in a softball question for yourself so you really feel like you slammed it

I guess we will be seeing a friend, his gf and that “cop” in some feature films shortly then because that was some fantastic performances
---
I just have one real question. Has anyone actually pmed you bob the cat rule 34? If so hmu
---
At least it’s RuneScape related and not some degenerates hanging out their dirty laundry for everyone to see and meme on
---
Yes, block Konar and use another Slayer master. 
---
Yeah you can afk for as long as you hold aggro i think 10 minutes if you use a bonecrusher and dragonbone necklace 
---
Don't bother, his favorite antisjw youtuber probably told him EU is fucked because of the sjws removing all speech.

Her twitter has been deleted
---
No, it's shit and you should feel bad for posting it. 
---
That’s what a lot of people do when they are in awkward or uncomfortable situations. Especially in front of literal thousands of people. 
---
Only after 200m iirc 
---
It's definitely worth it. Makes it so much nicer chinning and bursting. I would even guess it's more efficient than running to pick up single doses of pp. The method for melee is also extremely afk. I maxed all my melee stats this way while afking on my phone. Would literally only open the app to reset aggro then close it. Easiest "grind" of my life. You can also get a whole lot of charges for the bonecrusher just by collecting the daily bonemeals from Robin. 
---
When you say speaking their views, do you mean people saying "X people are from an evil death cult that wants to take us over"? Or "Y people have low iq because of their race"? Or "we must remember the 14 words!"? Or "Z people run the government and the Sizan were right."?

Only downside I see personally with it being a mini-game is exp waste. "Why do this when I could do stuff more effectively?"
---
It would either need great rewards or to be "fun".
---
Did you just tell me to cut my wrists???
---
Is that true though? Junior devs at jagex get ~£28k which is pretty standard no?
---
you take that back
---
Which means I have another challenge! Being a lowbie is fun if you see them as hurdles instead of walls. I've got a hard clue I need to finish dragon Slayer for because it wants me to wear green dhide body
---
nice bait
---
its yours??

Northwest of the west varrock bank used to just be trees. Regular trees and maybe some maples if I remember correctly.

Anyone know game mechanics of zulrah i may not be aware of? I’m using good gear with 90 def 65 pray and 88 mage but i can only get zulrah consistently to 75-90% killed. KC 6 all time 
---
"Calls you safer even though he safes"
---
Lmao I literally walk away from fights when people do that.  Not tele out.  Like eat to full, turn off run, and walk out of the wild.  Nothing annoys me more that kids who try to force you to a higher moral standard, just so they can try to get your pixels.

Look up what an LPO is.

gitgud? Yeah let me just go bank and grab a chally when he already has one with full spec and comes in and takes more dmg on my kill. you're literally a retard diregna, a solo player cant do anything to combat a crasher by themsself. Also i did report him as if one report will do anything, he needs to be perma banned imo
---
114gp, nice 
---
4 items in 51 chests? That's actually really good, on average you'd be at 3 by now
---
And the fucker throwing snowballs at him to top it all off. 
---
My head hurts reading that
---
This has been mentioned nearly once a month on the q&amp;as. Every time it’s brought up, the reasoning for not having it has always been too much work for a small change.
---
If quiver gets implemented, would risk that. 
---
Yeah, Rigour and Augury are definitely things to get with Zulrah money later.  You might be interested in keeping your Fury and getting an Anguish instead of a Torture, would help with Zulrah.
---
As for raids, I am not yet raids ready either but I'd like to be able to do them soon on my main.  (Currently in retirement while I prod my pure) But from my understanding you can probably do just find with 90+ stats.  Still a bit of a grind, but not as bad as the full 99.
---
Isn’t it possible she thinks people are just misspelling her name when they say they are going to kill zulrah 
---
Good movie, another solid example to never stick it in crazy.
---
WHATS IT CALLED
---
Congrats
---
Yes, it could be possible, but did it happen? Nah.

All this comment shows is that you are way too new in the RS streamer circle to even comment on it. This is besides the point that it's actually a very good thing he did it on stream for legal purposes.

102k gp in a little over 100 kills is pretty ok
---
I am tempted to explain this to you, but due to your shitty cell phone picture, I will not. Learn how to take a screenshot, dumbass.
---
1) Set your PIN, you'll regret it if you ever get hacked (speaking from experience)
---
2)  Its engine work since the bank currently opens every object in the bank at once, so there's an upper limit on how many objects it can store.  Ash has said he's considering just adding a 2nd bank to get more space.
---
All those people by the west bank!  That's where I learned flash scroll and color effects :) good times 
---
I mean, in terms of high level PVM very little is solo content. CoX, GWD, ToB, Dks, Corp... all are very much group content that is also soloable.
---
Most likely this.

Just started a new ironman and I know I'm going to have lots of questions, is there a friendly cc I can join? 
---
Or even spirit tree to Port Sarim. No, there are definitely ways to access, but even those examples are relatively high-level content requirements, and it doesn't change the problems that the other patches inherently have. The Seers patch is isolated from everything else in the area, and the only shortcut (which isn't really much of one) is the Kandarin hard diary teleport, the yanille patch direct teleport is locked behind 58 magic and a quest, or 50 construction, and as you've pointed out, they're actually both better accessed by the minigame teleports of Castle Wars, and Nightmare Zone.
---
Futhermore, I'm unsure you can even have your Magic Secateurs on you when trying to get to Entrana, so you have to juggle them in the Leprechaun. It's just a mess.

Runelite often has scam ads on google redirecting you to a site with malware in the client. Verify you downloaded from the official site. 
---
That's awesome! I got mine at 65! 
---
Some fun math for you... (Cuz im super bored between classes)
---
The chance that you would've gotten the drop at or before  level 60 is about  1.05%
---
I cheated a bit and ignored the rolls from mining to lv 30, but assuming you're level 60, you've had approximately 7821 rolls at the pet at the aforementioned 1/741000 chance. (An average of the changing drop chance as you level up, but it doesnt change the answer much)  
---
And with binomial probability, your formula for you getting a drop after a certain amount of rolls is \[1-((740999/741000)\^7821)\] = 0.010499 
---
So basically 1/100 accounts that gets to 60 mining using iron ore has the pet. Kinda cool to think about.
---
Yeah but the requirements for such is quite high. We are no where near the required stats. We will get there eventually! 
---
Its a fair attitude, but each step will take you weeks to get the requirement for, fair warning.
---
Oh that sucks! I guess it's slightly better than getting hacked
---
It's an event toy. Somebody throws it at you, and if you have both hand slots free, you will catch it and have it equipped.

---
&gt;I dunno if the mining company is looking to mine anymore profits or not.
---
they are selling Jagex stocks
---
Still would be absolutely insane that 2 out of 6 people (per your example) are playing the game for more than 12 hours per day
---
At the end of what I said I added “and solo if you please” 
---
I have a feeling people stop reading something the second they see something they disagree with. 
---
There’s nothing inherently wrong with solo content whatsoever. 
---
I got it figured out. Took all the suggestions and am at 300k+ points just 20 minutes into the run.
---
Wasnt this posted yesterday
---
I better suggestion would just be for each iron Man to have their own discreet shops so they never can't buy due to a shop being overstocked
---
Why yes those, bonus points if it's armadyl instead of bandos
---
Better than dungeoneering because I don't have to do it because it's not a skill.
---
Seriously, fuck dungeoneering. Most expensive buyable in game.
---
Pretty hard to say without seeing what you're doing. If you could at east describe your setup and method it would help.
---
Some general pointers would be:
---
Make sure you're avoiding the avoidable damage. Things like getting hit by the mele zulrah, stepping in the poison clouds, venom scaling up etc.  There are times where you can avoid getting hit by mele minions, but that can be tricky. If you don't have a suffering make sure you keep up your recoils.
---
When you have to eat, time it so that you don't miss attacks if possible. This means eating when Zulrah goes under the water. Combo eat if you can (something like shark -&gt; karambwan).
---
Use range if you can. Mage only kills are pretty inconsistent and slow.
---
Make sure you're getting off all the hits you can. When you need to run around, mix in attacks. (Run a few squares, attack, run again). Try to get your switches fast enough that you can attack zulrah as soon as possible.
---
A lot of it comes down to practice and being proactive. If you're reacting to what zulrah does you're always going to have trouble, you need to be ready before things happen. Things like moving towards the right place for the next zulrah before the current one dives make a big difference.
---
Who hurt you? 
---
Yes, I need someone to talk to. I am getting fed up with all these retards who this it is remotely acceptable to take a fucking picture of their computer screen and post it online for discussion. How retarded do you have to be to think you need to "have reddit" on your ipad in order to post a screenshot? 
---
Mostly it’s just practice? Are you only using mage?
---
And that he takes thirty minutes to get to the fucking point. 
---
Raids 1 yes, raids 2 if you're woox.
---
Gotta be ready for a quick escape if things get crazy

Designing 4-5 different bosses is a huge time sink, especially for something that I bet is not going to be very popular content past the first week when the "new factor" runs out. That's almost like an entire raids3 worth of bosses. Unless all the bosses don't really have mechanics and are just "stand there and pray."

 I've tried it 3 times and I have pretty good stats so I have always made it to Jad no problem, but every time so far I just spaz out and can't stay calm when the healers spawn and miss a pray switch and then I'm out of rhythm and miss another and another... then I die.

I was streaming for my friend and I clipped it from there. 
---
He's definitely more sustained, so brews+restores are best. His only real burst are his special attacks, which you can dodge.
---
Brews+Restores+2 Ranging pots should be more than enough to kill him. Some people bring a stamina pot along with them because he has some attacks that can drain your run energy and make him a bit more annoying.
---

Combat brace is clever. I try to hit Seers off of the Ardy allotment, nmz for Yanille, and canoe from a homeport for Lumby. I ignore Entrana. Any shortcut's a good one.

With none of the gear, you will burn sharks until 99 cooking and you equip the skillcape. With only cooking gauntlets, you will stop burning them at 94. With both the gauntlets and the use of Hosidius range, you will stop burning them at 89.

Took me 8 tries, always got to jad but always paniced n stuff missed prayer switches and ect. But the last try I did on course of 2days so I did like 10 waves, logged off, did more waves later in the day, and before jad I watched few guides again to memorise the attacks, also had some chill beats playing in the background which helped me to calm a bit
---
If you ONLY had the outfit in this picture I’d consider it good RNG. And you got pet, tome, and d axe....

Very glad they removed the herb patch. 5 months ago there were 6 herb patches (7 if you completed morytania elite, but 6 for all intents and purposes). Since then they added Weiss disease-free patch, and last month they added another patch in the farming guild, effectively increasing the number of herb patches by 33% since November 2018. Add in the reduced risk of disease w/ Iasor plant or increased yield w/ Attas plant, Kebos Hard diaries increasing 2 of the 8 herb patch yields by 5% and you can easily hit 150k xp/day just farming torstols for 45-50 minutes over the course of a day. Then consider that in the same 5 months they introduced new best-in-patch white lillies (flower) and snape grass (allotment) that doubled the amount of xp you can get from their respective patches, then added another new fruit tree and regular tree patch (20% increase in patches) and farming is starting to become EZscape.
---
You clipped a stream then fucking phone recorded it?

---
They should be better, but that doesn't mean there is no limit to how good they should be. If it did take 20 mins to make them and they lasted 10,000 uses, perhaps that should be upped. Likewise, if it took 10 hours to make them, perhaps that should be brought down. But without knowing the rates of Crystal Shards, knowing the amount needed per tool is pretty meaningless.
---
Best for what? Both of those methods are terrible xp and the gp doesn't really make up for it.
---
Most people had an idea that she was bad news from the beginning

Yeah. I need 2185 shortbows to get the exp for doing longbows. I'm a quarter of the way there. Might not be massively efficient, but I can do it at work and not feel like it's mind numbing. RuneScape has a good postive feedback loop with skilling (at least in mid-range)

I play on a nitro 5. I havent noticed it getting really hot above the F keys, but I have noticed the bottom gets really hot, especially if using the GPU. I opt to use low graphics and the CPU and it runs cooler. What is your settings setup? I'll give it a go and see if the area above those keys is noticeable. 
---
Sidenote -- Sounds like you use the nitrosense app to manually control the fans. If not, its worth firing up. 
---
I know /: I didn’t even get any death runes. Tough luck

I would have to guess you didn't have 2 step enabled on your linked email or RS authentication even, so your first bet is to question a client who tons of ppl use without issue daily rather question yourself about your failed ability to secure a runescape account.

Bruh no joke, I was at the ge like a month ago and got invited to some wierd clan.  I was fucking with them in chat and some dude starts talking about how he is playing on mobile from prison.  Nobody pays him any attention but after I got bored of fucking with the other people I decide to take the bait.  Turns out he actually was, he linked me to a YouTube and a twitch, the only videos on them is a dude sitting afk in the ge, while a facecam on the phone records super dark video of like a dude usually with a bunch of other people smoking and shit.  A lit of them are in the bathrooms, to I assume hide it, so the audio is super shitty and distorted.  
---
Tldr, it's already a thing and I'm pretty sure it's just a front for like contacting people on the outside I dunno. 
---
Look up storm drawdy for proof, thier videos are total shit and haven't uploaded in two months so maybe the got caught lol, but it's some wierd shit.  Dude told me he was in for selling guns.
---
Along with attacking themselves with whip/blowpipe.
---
I always do my hops runs at the end of an herb run. Finish at the Falador patch, run south to Port Sarim, bank deposit box my herbs and Ardy cloak, take the ship to Entrana, then Seers' tele, home tele for combat brace to Champions' guild, then Watchtower teleport.
---
sounds to me like he was pretty savvy with his money before the gf saga. he'll be fine my dude.

Do you think she will stay arround with him? Do you think he will kick her out of his life? Or do you think she will say im sorry and he will forgive it, cause i wouldnt. At that point i would just think for the child

Your choice is between another pk build or an Ironman?? That's a pretty wide difference

A 1 Defence Pure seems to be a popular account type. You could try one of those.
---
On twitch he was getting minimum 10k, generally 15k views on avg. He does not get that on youtube. He also has a far more toxic community than ever before, so I would not be at all surprised if they drive him to quiting or suicide.

Most email providers allow this. I personally use the + modifier for each service I sign up for so a normal email like this

you can use

&gt; email+twitter@domain.com

&gt; email+reddit@domain.com

That way I can filter the messages for each service I sign up for. It'd also be an easy way to keep track of accounts by putting the name after the plus

they take like 3min ea. I had the time but I took too long in the end

100%! I'd hate to lose my progress but at least I can try and build my bank back up a little !
---
That is. Amazingly relevant, especially since I feel in my soul that 'damnit, now I need to level construction'
---
Might be true but I hardly ever get blood runes unless I get 100%. Its mostly minds and chaos with a few deaths sprinkled in. With 100% its mostly chaos with decent deaths and occasionally bloods. Which to me seems better?
---
This was answered on a Q&amp;A. 
---
The issue here was not the model of the capes but the development time needed to make an option to attach/deattatch the hood to the cape. They said that it would be an easy job if they could just replace the current cape model but, that the community would probable like to have both models/options.

I said "Arr-dohg-nee" for my entire life, until one of the early Q&amp;A streams when Ash pronounced it correctly as "Arr-doy-en" and like a switch I just flipped to the correct one 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Yes, although it can be slightly easier to learn how to predict them by using ranged, because Cerberus mainly only throws magic attacks at you when you're ranging her, so the MRM combo sticks out more clearly.
---
Basically, excluding the start of the fight, Cerberus can only use the MRM combo:
---
1. If you take too long to get her hp below 400hp (can happen even with max stats and BiS gear, if you just get terrible RNG hits).
---
2. If you get lucky while Cerberus is between 200-400hp and she randomly decides to skip the souls, you'll get a MRM combo instead.
---
3. Very soon after spirits have finished attacking you.
---
4. Very soon after Cerberus has thrown the lava pools.
---
In the first two cases, if you pay attention to the interval at which she attacks you, there'll be a slight extra delay added to it **immediately before** she uses the MRM combo. If you're feeling unsure as to whether there was such a delay and you hear a magic attack coming, you can always just switch to praying ranged immediately after you hear the sound of the magic attack, since praying magic already counts when you hear the sound and the orb isn't visible yet, and then switch back if it was too early.
---
In the last two cases, the delay before the MRM combo should be fairly obvious, so it's down to just trying over and over until it becomes muscle memory pretty much.
---
Someone finally got it right.
---
I’m so close to maxing my zerker right now, but I also just started a fresh Ironman account.
---
I’m having a lot of fun playing the Ironman right now in the early game. Probably going to try and turn this Ironman into a med lvl because I’ve never had an account with higher than 70 def.

How do you level ranged and magic quickly without a bunch of money in the first place?

They seem to have designed crystal equipment specifically to not effect ehp while still being useful to more casual players. So I really doubt they'll do that.
---

---
Agree with everything aside from your point about the graphics of the city. Priff in RS3 looks terrible imo with it all being crystal, there is so little variance in design or colour. I think the mix of trees plus crystal looks miles better and will be easier on the eyes in the long run

---
Wait.... Are you referencing true creativity in a thread that discusses “meme templates”?
---
This definitely isn’t the case. Most people in America are even complaining about the lack of consequences for domestic violence cases, so realistically he has a LOW chance of spending a night in jail, and that’s chance is even lowered because she has no proof of anything he did to her. In fact he has an entire stream worth of proof full of situations where she looks to be the crazy one and he looks to be mostly calm and collected.

If your friends have roughly your stats or higher you guys are totally ready to start learning raids 1, I’ve got 88 attack/def, 93 str, 86 mage and 91 range and we’ve been going strong on raids!

I don't want this place to be an BE-ALL for ALL place. There is so much to do in this place that it will neglect all over locations around RuneScape. Thinking, "why go to Falador for such-in-such when the elf city has such-in-such". It is SO cringing to see. 
---
\--------------------
---
Anyways I have a big concern about Poll question #6  
---
" **Poll Question #6**  
---
 If Prifddinas is added to the game, should it include new Soft clay  rocks? These rocks would work exactly like clay rocks but would give  Soft clay instead of clay. Wearing a Bracelet of clay whist mining Soft  clay would grant two Soft clay instead of one for every successful mine.  These will require **Song of the Elves** and **70 Mining**. "
---
My concerns are, hear me out because this is where the concern comes from. The varrock armor grants a chance of mining an additional ore. Would the varrock armor allow an additional wet clay to be mined? Now, along with bracelet of clay, would this allow up to 3 soft clay be mined?  
---

The Saw Mill, Hardwood Trees, and Player Own House:  
---
These three ideas in one place would be beneficial to players doing construction manually. Chop the wood, saw mill, go to house and do your thing. Rinse and repeat. The distance from POH from saw mill is quite some distance so I don't see people rushing construction using this method.   
---
However, how I feel about them in a location where it is an Be-all for all.  
---
Teak and Mahogany Trees - Fossil island already satisfy this need. You have your own personal tree; 3 of them exactly! If you add them, go ahead, just don't add a shit ton. I see this ben  
---
Player Own House - Besides quicker teleport to Prifddinas and construction, this doesn't seem much purpose. You have the Gautlet which strips you barenaked so no benefit there. So, I see it as a teleport hub to all locations if your house is equip with such things. So, add a new location for the Teleport Crystal and/or add Hot Air Balloon.
---
I do like to see two things added.  
---
1) Brewing location. There are only two in the game and they take up to 2 days to make 8 doses of beers. &gt;.&gt;' Another location will help out here. More hops will be used up a little bit more than at the rate they are at.
---
2) Gem Rocks. I believe these fit well with Prifddinas. It will reduce bots from shilo village for those who didn't do the Elite Karamja. If not, add it to the Legend's Guild's Dungeon.
---
Anyways, please comment.

To A Friend: make sure to take a paternity test, especially if you even have the slightest suspicion of her sleeping with someone else. She might be trying to frame you with someone else's baby.

Con is of course that if you prove to be the dad, she can come for child support. But if she sues you for that and you decline a test, then you'll be stuck with it either way...

Or just get your ass out of this country...

Good luck A Friend!

your first run, will be expensive, bring a bunch of prayer pots, and melee only bosses, get like 400k nmz points, and then switch to absorbs (rock cake helps drastically with this) and then its 100% free, unless youre like me and like super combats over overloads..

depends on what boss you want to kill, your stats seem fine to do most pvm activities, focus on getting your mage up i'd say if you would be interested in CoX for example.
---
It’s called a “mandatory arrest”, many states implement it, and it calls for an arrest if the police officer finds “probable cause” that an offense was committed. Probable cause isn’t a defined term. Also, a couple jurisdictions even implement a “dual arrest” system in which both parties get detained for at least a night. This seems to be due to a call for action in the 1970’s from women on domestic abuse arrests.

Not OP but I have 170 kc in CoX and trust me they do get repetitive.  Everyone prescouts nowadays so you end up doing the same 5-6 rooms over and over again.  They're definitely better than normal bossing like gwd but I still need to take regular breaks especially on dry streaks.

---
&gt;I've said from the start that "that's not saying much" when you said he's more trustworthy than her. I'm not contending it because it's not my point. When your entire outrage with me is that I'm not defending the strawman you built, it sounds like you were right after all: this isn't a debate: you're just having a manic episode.
---
Except I explained how it is saying much, you're not contending it because you gave up on it, don't twist it. Your original point was we had no reason to believe him over her, which I pointed out her actions on the stream were both very dishonest and very poor in character, what she did was far more telling than anything 'A friend' has done.
---
&gt;Except you're still here, so no it wasn't. Someone being less untrustworthy than someone else doesn't make them the tru tru, there can be (and often are) two liars. The "people are fallible" argument you're going for highlights how your argument is falling apart and you're having to rely on generic statements like that, far fling from that "shutdown" you're claiming.
---
Well yeah I am, mostly because you refuse to not have the last word, but also because you started completely different and separate points to the original.
---
You're actually right someone being less trustworthy doesn't make the other person immediately correct, but it significantly raises the chances when it is a 'he said/she said' situation of only 2 outcomes, he did cheat or he didn't. She is less trustworthy and says he did cheat, he is more trustworthy and says he didn't therefore we can much more easily trust his word especially since he has a history of being honest even to his detriment.
---
My argument has remained the same and you haven't brought forth a single point until that one, so that 2nd half really doesn't say much of anything considering it is literally just blatantly false.
---
&gt;Literally everything I've said has been a point. Pretending they don't exist isn't an instrument, Patrick, it isn't anything. Also, funny that you were on my case for not responding to every word of your shit when you've abruptly dropped the draft discussion &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Everything you've said has been deflection and semantics at best, you literally spent several comments trying to argue definitions of something completely irrelevant to the actual situation while ignoring a dozen or more points and examples presented, on purpose.
---
Pretending they don't exist is basically admitting loss in that situation, it'd be one thing if you did it once or twice but you basically did it for every single one. Including the draft one at this point, you literally didn't offer a contending argument to the draft debate you straight up dropped it yourself don't act like a child and make shit up at the very least please.
---
&gt;Far as I see it, the more you've opened your mouth the worse your argument has gotten. If you hadn't gone on that pointless debate arc that you lost before you even began because words have definitions, maybe you'd have something, even then the crux of your argument is because you claim that the girl is less trustworthy than him (a statement that I never contended because that's not what I'm talking about) you have reasonable cause to believe him, which is fundamentally fallacious.
---
So admitting I'm right but because you 'think' you had a better spam of definitions, which you didn't even continue to debate hilariously enough, and then changing what your original point was? Somehow you think... what? You came out on top? That is hilarious quite frankly you would have to be delusional on many levels.
---
&gt;You talk about surrender when pretty much every single avenue you're pursuing is proving that you have nothing to actually claim trusting a friend is a good idea. Guac boi's derangement counseling center is going to be open for a bit longer, so you're free to send more debunkables my way, but you're pretty much pushing rope right now.
---
You've talked about nothing while I've presented points and examples over and over, and you just ignore them and focus on an attempt at deflection. Just like you're trying to do right now with how you typed out this entire thing and tried to make exactly 1 point rather than actually directly addressing anything said.
---
How is this runescape related :D
---
Holy shit. I didn't know it was that much more. Sweet :) next patch will be mahogany since I'll be 55 before then! Man I'd be 70+ for sure right now had I started doing this a long time ago.

The odds of it are low because the odds of your wife calling the police on you for a domestic that didn’t happen rarely happens. But once you’re there and the cops show up you’re going to jail. The real problem here is the lying bitch of a wife that you have, not so much the cop that’s following protocol.

In full vision of the item, it's entirely a quality of life item that would be a extreamly rare drop.

It doesn't effect the use of cheaper rings or necklaces, as you use them to charge the eternal ring or necklaces.
---
Their uses may be specific to a hand full of things, runecrafting, clan wars quest teleports, blah blah but there are plenty of items that only revolve around 1 or 2 things so that argument is irrelivant.
---
If the obtaining of them is to easy then the rate could be made rarer, yes there is risk with the eternal glory, but it's also a large money maker method on its own.

Depending on how the prices of keys go, it could also end up a huge money maker, but that'll be seen.
---
To answer why the games ring its also a item that can clutter the bank cause of multiples and adding a less wanted item reduces the drop rate of the more wanted one while still having use for the other item.
---
Crystal chest is mostly magical items and gems so there is a premise for there to be magical jewelry.
---
Perhaps. I'd compare the Gauntlet more to Dungeoneering than SC, but both have a similar foraging aspect. Personally, I'd say the competitive part is what made SC. Even if you didn't PvP, it was still competitive since the team with the most score got an extra 10% points. And the base system made it so that even if you just wanted to skill and craft, you could do that for points while supplying your team to do PvP and help secure other nodes to skill at.
---
I'd say my best memories of SC weren't just draining nodes and crafting; that is pretty much just normal skilling and you don't need a minigame for that. The most memorable parts were fighting the other team over resources, building walls to try to lock them out of the T5 as they try to break in or being the ones trying to break in, pickpocketing runes before vanishing into fog, and the battles in the middle when both teams were still strong. It definitely had its flaws, like when the only T5 spawns right outside the enemy base giving one team a huge advantage or the previously mentioned spawn camping, but I think a foraging style team PvP minigame would still be great to see if balanced a bit better.
---
By doing this they make those minigames dead the rest of the time. Want to get your void set? Well shit gotta wait a month for it to be up again. 
---
If they just made better rewards for the shit minigames people would do them.

You're on r/2007scape....

Im sorry it should not of happened :(

Jagex can’t tell me how to live my life :^)

I cringed so hard. Dear god, help
---
Thanks a lot :D

Best shortcut to Sears hop patch is music cape, and yes you can take magic secateurs to entrana. With a port sarim spirit tree and a tree in your POH, it's actually an easy one as the bank deposit box next to the ship means you clear a few used inventory spaces at the same time and takes like 2 seconds.

I was just curious and I hope that’s a thieving skill cape you toon is wearing.
---
&gt;The odds of it are low because the odds of your wife calling the police on you for a domestic that didn’t happen rarely happens. But once you’re there and the cops show up you’re going to jail. The real problem here is the lying bitch of a wife that you have, not so much the cop that’s following protocol.
---
I'll admit I have not read the domestic disturbance policies for all 50 states. But acting like it's the norm that you'd be arrested with 0 evidence (no injuries, etc) is absolutely untrue. It is not some generic policy that you're always arrested. That's my point. You keep trying to just matter of factly say it is when it is not.
---
I never stopped liking Dovydaddy. His voice gets me every time, he could be sponsored by ISIS I still click. Hey guys it's me a flrend, okay byeee
---
No one is going to do content because "the boss is cool." The rewards are what incentivize people to do content. The rewards, as is, for Gauntlet seem very underwhelming, so it's unlikely very many people will do it. For that reason, I'd prefer they didn't spend a ton of time on designing multiple bosses when 1 boss works just fine.
---
Yeah I remember some of the stuff in this book being complete bullshit. It's be nice to flip through and see what holds up after all this time.
---
You guys know this is all fake right. This is a publicity stunt to regain the viewers he lost.
---
Sorry, I don’t understand the post. Can you tell me what I have to look at?
---
Ive been going for 75% because then you also avoid bloods for deaths..which when rolled will be worth more on average.

Heal appears the tick after I believe

For whatever reason my settings had turned off desert treasure bosses. Just turning them on made my points skyrocket. 
---
Do I think they are the pinnacle of creativity? No. Did this one make me chuckle? Yes. Therefore, upvote from me.
---
I am doing exactly that right now. NMZ seems to be the best balance for me. (Lines up with a productivity hack called the pomodoro method.)

Ar- doe-gen (gen is like the second syllable of again)
---
ya it was one of those. Aggravating. What makes it worse is that he was a lower level than me
---
I got like 5 range levels from Hydra boss slaying lol
---
It would be nice to buff those spells because they really are useless right now. I'm not sure what kind of buff or if your idea would be most viable but they def deserve something. Right now they have no use that i know of at least. For a high level spell such as smoke barrage it should be usable somewhere. Shadow barrage too could use some buffing. I think against Abby sire is the only use for it right now? And i dont even know if people use it for that even lol. 
---
There’s no situation where I can think of wanting to use Crystal armor over simply Mage/Strength gear in PvP except maybe ranged tanks. Also, pretty sure they talked about the armor dropping the shards or something in the blog when you kill someone with it in PvP, so similar to how the Wildy weapons work.
---
oh no, I read the whole thing.
---
It's the fact that you said you'd rather have something SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR soloing be a team based challenge, with soloing as an afterthought, when that was purely the exact opposite in the first place. Which is why I made the comment I did.
---
I have a feeling people immediately get defensive instead of seeing that their original points weren't good to begin with.

Do quests but even then i would’ve played F2p for a bit so the membership won’t be wasted

What injuries are there for pushing, slapping, he hit me with the phone book, etc. The laws are irrelevant because the cop is not a judge, a lawyer, or the jury. Cops have a very rudimentary understanding of the law which is why illegally obtained evidence is still being tossed out of the courts constantly. They don’t know what they can and can’t do. Until recently plenty of cops thought it was illegal to record them. Plenty of cops think that we are legally required to give them our ID without committing a crime. 
---
It's an exaggeration. It's still easy 600k/hr for a very simple boss. Especially with fally hard done. Plus a chance at a pet.
---
A...

Maybe being a god of construction was a requirement to get the licence.

He is too lazy to realize it is just as easy to take a screenshot.

Pretty sure if you die then the trident/blowpipe are emptied. The only logical conclusion is ur brother being an idiot

Talking about ironman
---
How did you set it up to work with the gpu plugin?
---
A streamer pretended to have a life crisis entirely on camera. It was extremely cringe as he and his girlfriend argued very passionately while A Friend played runescape with his headset on in front of a few hundred people. 
---
That isn't how real life works people and if the stakes were as high as they should be in this argument, it wouldn't have happened on fucking twitch. This subreddit has proven so gullible today. 
---
Idk if you’ve missed out on basically anything lately between pewdiepie and YouTube but he’s 100% no longer their golden boy whatsoever. That much I do know.

what actually happened to him

the best part about your video is that it's not 10 minutes long. 
---
the best part about this comment is its not 2:33 long. 
---
thanks. 
---
This is the first actual clip I have watched of this whole situation. This shit is so staged! 
---
RIP account buddy. Take this down and repost with blocked name and run energy
---
they are adding an indicator to the cave (?) so you can see when hespori is fully grown without needing to enter. 
---
One shaddows to imagine what inhuman thoughts lie behind that mask
---
\&gt; the point is that kind of law would not be constitutional in the first place in America 
---
Yeah, and overt bribery is.  But hey at least you can heil hitler in peace.
---
Also, the point is that count Dankula doesn't resemble a friend in any fashion, and discussions of comparative law are irrelevant.
---
Damn. I’m at 20 kc on my alt and I’ve hit it 4 times, including a dragon med helm (fuck me.) I’m waiting on something like that to happen lol 
---
Yeah cuz that shit looked like poop, bad memories
---
Finally actual 2007scape content. 
---
That dot on the image.
---
Why do you do this to me 
---
new ardy cape 5
---
But its really rare to find a non taken one. Even if its random letters
---
Sounds embarrassing
---
Not sure where you got the impression that I said it was okay. I just said how he felt lacked any kind of self-awareness.
---
Idk I was in a hurry and did a google image search
---
I've had those dreams 2 or 3 times and they scared the shit out of me everytime
---
Shitty vid
---
Gz on fish chicken
---
Yeah. Karma has no value, so if i have 5 million or -5k it doesn't make a difference. 
---
Ironmen have 80% increased drop chance because they're useless accounts. Gratz tho ;D
---
so you burn 8.3% at 82, but 8% and 81? 🤔
---
Have you thought about cannon + toxic blowie?
---
Ya this i honestly one of my favorite ash gifs. I'm not gay but I'd totally let him rail me in a seedy bathhouse raw!
---
he got "sponsored" by some gambling site and recieved a fuckton of money. Also recieved some osrs gold, so the jmods banned him for rwt on all accounts.
---
Then he suddenly realized hey, I just shat where I eat, and ruined his entire channel with that. 
---
A lot of dislikes and unsubs happened. Some like to pretend it never happened or "I woulda done da same xd" reactions, like the guy before me trying to explain it. 
---
Nobody gets banned for "no reason" and Jagex takes their shit seriously.  (Also he used to be a player mod few years earlier but got status removed due to making vid about how much money scammers make, as it would encourage scamming)
---
Would big tiddy Uighur organs do fine?
---
That's the spirit, we all believe in you!  One day you'll get there!
---
CUTE!
---
Hacked. That bottle gave me the location of your school, which lead me to your name, and both of your RuneScape bank pins. 
---
I’m not at 75 yet, but could happen after I get it! I just can’t find good spots to cannon at all
---
He had more viewers when he was taking donations. 
---
They broke up before the stream. He can't suddenly evict her so there she was.
---
Ive been playing for a decade and sometimes I nolifed hard, but have never ever seen the 6 hour log. I can't go that long without eating, toilet or just a break. Or world hops too.
---
i feel like he only lost like a few hours of progress, im sure his more knowledgeable friend can help him rebuild
---
Ur eye raping me
---
what an idiot
---
Honestly, being this new to Runescape, I don't think tying his goals to a master clue is very reasonable at this level. I feel like having more manageable goals will make him less likely to burn out and quit.
---
DD2? Don't you mean DS2?

Well yeah but why are you actively trying to get rid of it? Are you hurting?

Hello, a shamed here, today we have loot from 50 acts of infidelity...

It would never pass a poll.

omgf did you take my visafe
---
Expand on story please?
---
lol 
---
Agree with about most of that post except the cringe ending 
---
Pretty sure that's the inferno
---
Okay but once you turn 18 and just watch those youtube videos for 9 years instead of going out and actually practicing sometimes, you have no one to blame except yourself.
---
Keeping up with the karambwans.
---
Template please? This has to be one of my favorites.
---
Yes. Everything is fine. I don’t know what happened but door opened after I left the Iceland and came back...
---
Salamander is ranged/magic based melee though.
---
The mace is a guthix staff. The title is confusing me on how it would work.
---
Arnold

She probably will be charged considering all evidence is on stream lol
---
someone explain! I’m out of the loop
---
I spent a week or two at skeletal wyverns awhile back and had a lot of dreams where I forgot mind shield, left safespot, ran out of food, etc.

I think someone took a big fat smelly wet heavy dump in his cereal this morning

So in a few years, I trust you'll change your name to JagexOak?

Just stand on opisite ends of and and protect melee and stand in melee range for longest trips
---
Oh wow, someone said a meme phrase on reddit, time to show off how above everything I am, and how unique and original I am. 
---
Mate, no one gives a fuck what you think about on the internet, especially not a generic as fuck comment as "hurr durr, don't want to make the rich richer, amirite?"   
---
Go develop a fucking personality instead of relying on simple contrarianism to guide you through life outside of highschool 
---
Close. I’m A Peirce. The A is Adrian tho. Threw me off
---
Can confirm. 
---
I’m the guy that’ll get the alert when you try to install anything. I caught a guy thinking he was smart and tried to install bitminer and steam. Obviously not smart enough to consider that corporate machines would be monitored. 
---
I play OSRS on weekends and night shifts. Kills time. I simply use the unmonitored and less locked down guest network as opposed to one of the corporate or employee mobile networks.

On my laptop too.

I’m pretty new so are you guys serious when you say this?

I agree with that

now we know why a friend was upset for being told not to order any packages to his house

damn this is a game changer thanks

An actual thick cunt.

That's a great idea

Mage training arena
---
Hey man I'm eating cereal right now quit that.
---
Is this downvoted because of inaccuracy of prostitute age limit in Nederlands or because of americans not liking the 16 part?
---
Absolutely. It was that forward progression that made it work best.
---
Youre justifying inequality with more inequality.  Break the cycle, yo.
---
I don't see me :(
---
The only place I think it could have a use at is the inferno since it doesn’t have negative mage bonus like justiciar does. This means you won’t splash on the nibblers as often. Other than that I can see it maybe being used at bandos too. Overall pretty niche/useless. 
---
If the gauntlet is meant to be akin to dungeoneering I'm hoping there would be more diverse rewards than just crystal armour with stupidly high ranged defence bonus. 
---
Also as a skilling boss, skillers won't be able to do zolcano because of the HP required which to me seems a bit odd. (But I guess they choose to limit themselves yada yada)
---
Good luck!
---
Good, you didnt deserve it anyways

I'm pretty sure the obby mauler pic IS from 2012 RS, or HD release anyway.
