Yeah im pretty new, got any tips. I think the best is with 99 range?

What sort of account do you want? A 1 defence pure? A zerker? A void ranger? Do you plan on edgeville/bh style pking or no honour pking? There are a lot of different builds around the 80 combat mark, and so we need to know what your looking for.
---
and i just got a jar of swamp :(
---
Nice
---
I only ever liked staying 60 because it's the nostalgic of being a \*REAL\* zerker. haven't really played it anymore because i got bored of it like you just said. 
---
I think he's just doing random ironic dancing lol
---
Yeah I mean that's just the kinda game it is. Runescape does not hold your hand at all. 
---
Not as bad but 300kc 1 unique
---
Yo........this actually happened to me. You just dug up a ~15 year old repressed memory that I didn’t even know I had. Wow.
---
Definetly not a 1 def, but 1 with like 99 range. What do you suggest then?
---
loooool fml
---
So movement isn't actually required, just the fact that it's instanced means you can get double logs from 3t? It seems odd that the only videos I see of this move around so much. 
---
Wot? 
---
it won’t be for hours and hours because it’s a speed run and a cross fit only ironman so i wouldn’t be training on cows id be in the gym doing crossfit 
---
How long have you been at The Gower Institute for the Autistic? 
---
Understood, thanks!
---
Start burying your bones GG
---
maybe make a voider then 42 def and 50/60 attack and 52 prayer and rest 99, theres guides on youtube
---
Lmao I do
---
This is why I stopped playing my Ironman lol
---
Whitest party ever
---
Honorable mention to Blighttown.
---
I mean to be completely fair, I think Mithrilman is still a great idea. Sure it's a lot less efficient than taking part in the legitimate ingame economy but that's like saying Ironman is a stupid idea for the same reason
---
I think its currently 10 on mining and 5 on raw fish

I don’t know much about pvp I was just asking so you’d answer and then others can add to it

But if I was to pvp I’d def make a zerker cause of the risk value

Gotta be good enough and then there's a discord for it. Believe they require a trusted mm that then pays out the runners after. You need to be decent at running and get reviewed usually after working and then are more likely to get people using you for runs

its only arbitrage if you make the two trades with two accounts at the same time

otherwise you're taking on the risk of one logging out

Bots for sure though. Curious as to what they need Earth staves and magic for.

No?

Grind out the elite void and use a blowpipe/bgs spec..you will still profit alot even with the cost of scale/darts

I am a returning player who admits to using bots. I just use it on the mundane skills up to about 60, like mining or hunting.

I do all the quests my self, I love to PK, I enjoy doing slayer.. But I just hate spending my time endlessly grinding a skill that I did long ago on my main as a kid.. I don’t have time anymore for that and when I log on RS I want to enjoy the game. 
---
I respect those who did the grind and I definitely don’t boast about anything related to my skills but that’s just honestly why I use a bot and I’m not bored with the game at all. 
---
You're the type of person that sits in the corner and glares at people having genuine fun.

If the account is an alt not doing anything than 100%, but if your farming on your main than honestly I don't think so.

If by all you mean having multiple untrimmed skillcapes of the same skill, yes, you can drop them all, telegrab each one and keep them all untrimmed.

If by all, you mean having multiple untrimmed skillcapes of different skills, no, you only have the opportunity to get one untrimmed skillcape.

I remember my frustration at finding out the sword shop in varrock won’t let you buy/sell every type of sword and that I’d need to walk to the other end of the fucking map to find a specific shop. This is how you know it sucks to be an IM.

Probably Jay. Imagine waking up and being him. Fuck that.

Make sure you are minimizing lost game ticks from eating, moving, etc. Ive never done vork but seen plenty videos. Typically that's the issue for most when they have slow kill times. Your TTK can be improved quite a bit just by doing what I mentioned with making sure you dont have any wasted ticks in game. The damage can add up s BUNCH if you're not really being conscientious about it. 
---
While that may improve your time a little bit, your gears good so it sounds like you're just missing something or possibly doing it very inefficiently? Not trying to be rude at all - would be easier if you posted a vid of you doing a kill so that those who are experienced could conment on what to do or how to do it better. You got rigour I assume? Maybe just higher range and then like someone said elite void if you dont have it. 
---
Def sparc. Kids find it funny. However I’d say making 6 figures a year in your mid twenties is “doing something with your life” lol. I don’t really find it entertaining but I get why people would I guess

I'm going to go against the grain and say neither because melee isn't that great DPS in Barrows. As long as Ranged isn't &gt;10 levels under your melees, MSB (i) + Amethyst Arrows in Void Range or Black/Blessed D'hide &gt; Whip + Welfare strength setup (Fury, Fire Cape, Torso, etc.)
---
I forgot you’re not allowed to do things with friends until you’re over 18

Oh, okay! I was hoping for that but was also preparing myself to be well into 70 before I got it, ahaha. Wanted to get my Agility up/get Graceful before doing Underground Pass and the reqs for Recipe for Disaster. 
---
Compromise suggestion: Ban all normal ironmen
---
Easily, two kills a trip probs
---
It's why I honestly hope they never get the "GE spammer" issue under control. Well, that, and nostalgia. It just isn't runescape unless there's someone doubling money and trimming armour.

You want us to tell you how to play the game?

This scam still works on the ge. Find an it not frequently traded and sell it for high amount. Then just tell people in chat you’re buying so and so for more than your offer. You sell the item and they are stuck with an overpriced item. Shit happens all the time at the ge.

Honestly dude you need to not let ANYONE on your account if youre dealing with something like this. Period. That will just make things more difficult. No matter how much you trust them, from jagexs viewpoint you need to be the only one with access.

Upvoted for visibility tho and good luck.

I mean I literally don’t even know where to start or what I should be doing I just want to get back into the game and so am looking for advice. So basically, yeah.

GE exists, game is mutilated, just quit already.

No? Guess GE isn't that bad then.

Start by maxing all your skills to 99.

The vicious circle of asking for help from a Jmod, having them point to the useless support system, then having to go back to asking mods and posting on Reddit etc is a disgrace on the part of Jagex management, moreso after the influx of new players with mobile and the cash they must be bringing in, that could facilitate better support.
---
Yeah this would never be a thing, ever. For starters the sheer amount of coding to be done and also take into account the bugs/mistakes that could be made or brought into the game would make things worse..it would just be pointless tbh. 
---
Think about those Who would need to buy a bold or something right away for membership. Could take them ages dealing with people in theory.
---
Also yes the amount of scammers would be absurd. 
---
ya but i had alot of hp and i was only poisoned for 1 i think

When I run a tracert my ping is actually higher than what runelite says. That usually shows 500-2000 ms delays. I am losing packets when I get to L3 Servers so the address doesn't resolve all the time.

there I said it. 
---
U have 100 hp, you  coulda got that cape a long time ago bro 
---
It's not really necessary at all for Underground Pass. I did it with 48 and barely fell at all.
---
Then again, Agility itself *is* super helpful.
---
Forgive me, but what does a +5 runecrafting boost do? Just let you craft specific runes at an earlier level than normal?
---
Well hopefully you can get 73 in a skill for maximum meme

Got full graceful and recolored all pieces at 59 agility at canifis. Playing 2 accounts helps a ton so you won’t just be focused on agility.

What are your goals? If I were you, I’d get membership and get my str, attack, defence all to 99. People say that’s not the legitimate way to play (they level up through slayer), but I tried that and didn’t have the time or patience. 
---
Once I became near max melee, I did all my quests, and solely trained slayer up to level 90. I made a lot of money off slayer but only because it was quicker to do slayer once I hit high levels. 
---
There’s lots of guides but my go-to is Theoatrix, and for quests it is Slayermusiq (he has a spreadsheet for the optimal order of quests). 
---
no
---
dude acted like that when his iron man account only has 3 hours of of gameplay on it lol.  36 wc and 32 fm.... hahaha
---
Is there proof you can provide for these claims? 
---
Why’s it seem like the scammers always stand in the south part of the Grand Exchange? 
---
Also haven’t seen a trimming armor scam since I left RuneScape for the first time in 2008 or so. 
---
You can be a dumbass like me and make your first ever boss Zulrah... At the bare minimum stats. 
---
what stats should i have before attempting to range fire cape? currently 71 defense, 68 ranged, 44 prayer was gonna get 70 ranged for black dhide and try with rune cbow and broad bolts but also debating on just getting up to 75 and using blowpipe
---
if on slayer task use max melee you can afford to bring out like whip/drag defender combination make sure you only bring items you dont want to risk, can be like slayer helm,dragon hide/whip+defender.   
---
I seem to hit way more often on flick mode with whip while doing as slayer task, but offtask stick to veracs set
---
Merching today is just GE flips.
---
People used to make little businesses. Buy from fishers at location then go sell to people at varrock or cooking places, and a hundred other similar things. It used to be an actual activity, not what amounts to another daily.

---
I'm nearly 99 slayer, childhood dream.
---
Goals for the future probably see what the outside world is like right now. 
---
Yeah, you're absolutely right. I'll likely take that step in the future. I figured I had the recovery sorted, so at this point hindsight is 20/20 unfortunately. Thanks for the support.
---
put a blessing in the arrow spot, for that +1 prayer instead of just wasting it on dragon arrows when you dont even have a bow.

Yea you should make an iron. The early game isn't grindy and every small goal feels like a big achievement. Stuff like getting your first rune scim or 43 prayer. Just buy a bond or even start in f2p, you will probably get hooked.

Imo, the Kandarin headgear is overkill, so you could slot whatever instead.  Flax keeper clue isn't that common and the run from Seer's isn't a huge time saver.  Chronicle is fastest teleport to a chicken that I can think of.  
---
I withdraw 14 imps at a time and open 2 at a time, since wasting money on jars kills me, but it would be faster to just spam open them all.  I also don't use stams, just teleport to house whenever you find a good moment to refill.  House in relleka.  
---
Biggest thing for me was just learning all the fairy codes, figuring out shortest teleports, and answer puzzle questions quickly.  
---
Over 2.5k run, and it still can be fined tuned (need spirit tree in house for example).  I plan on getting 99 const and crafting for the sole purpose of running clues faster.

If you got any other questions feel free to ask.

Honestly it's up to you play style. If you think you would like it give it a shot otherwise I would suggest a break. Finish your membership and do something else for a little bit. Probably more refreshing than trying something more of a grind

Wyrms are assigned by more than Konar... Harpoon will tank over time regardless of anything, unless the game dies before it can happen.

I agree i think hcim looks the worst
---
moron btw
---
Lol
---
It’s true though, I always like to chat while wc, never see people talking at barb fish or mining smithing 
---
The grind really is the fun. But to answer your question, yes absolutely make an ironman. I wouldn't say it's harder but certainly longer. I've been enjoying my hcim on osrs and my ironman on rs3, and have basically phased out my main account on both. Ironman also forces you to get better at the game (dps rotations on rs3, prayer flicking on osrs) because your supplies are limited. You have to think more about a lot of things but getting big drops is so satisfying. A much longer, harder grind went into that drop than simply buying the gear or nmzing stats for Bandos and leeching some kills off some dude that knows how to tank.
---
Also the oziris ironman guide is really fun to follow makes you feel like you have a big brain and make.big smart
---
It is pretty common for people to suggest making an ironman if you're bored on your main, I think the reason is because you're starting a new account that you can't just transfer your bank from your main to, because a lot of the fun is starting from scratch. 
---
If you don't wanna grind you can just start another alt account that's specialized like a pure or something else you can altscape on when you feel like going back to your main.
---
Way to go. Not only did you ream that guy, you tore those kids a new hole too.

New to slayer and I'm slightly confused about how slayer points work. I know we get bonuses for doing consecutive slayer tasks (every 10, 50 tasks and so on) but is that only if we do it with the same slayer master.
---
What I'm getting at is if it's possible to do every 10th slayer tasks with the highest slayer master you can, and do every other slayer task with Mazchna in order to maximise slayer point gain.
---
I've never done that.

DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIYAH?!

Fletching cooking crafting fire making construction have some of the fastest xp rates in the game. Pretty sure cooking and winter todt have the fastest profitable methods

It depends on where you live. I live in EST timezone. I think anyone who has WOW internet that lives around me is going to have this same problem.

You could find out if it is the same problem as me by running a tracert.

I disagree, range pots can help reduce ppot consumption, especially if you use blowpipe specs for healing rather than brewing. I recommend bringing 2-3 range pots saving about 4 doses for Jad in case you have trouble with healers.
---
This is fucking awesome lol
---
They're probably hard to catch. People good at coding shit spend many hours making for-profit scripts specifically to bypass the automatic systems.
---
Cooking in Hosidious kitchen is the best method. Sharks are profit and it's like 4-5 days of cooking to 99 once you reach that point.
---
Yeah, definitely take barrows gloves over prims; prims give +2 stab and +3 str over climbing boots, while barrows gloves give +4 stab and str over rune gloves, even better if you've got ferocious gloves, which give +8 stab and +6 str over rune gloves.
---
You can say that, but at the end of the day it's the opinion of someone I don't care about.
---
Hm? If its clear op got phished and hacked he will get his acc back.
---
Its not a "i wasnt macroing" appeal, it was a "my account was stolen when the cheating occurred" deal. Ik quite a few people who stupidly get phished and end up unbanned.

My friend asks why I like RuneScape, and my top answer is despite the community being autistic in its own way, it's the only mmo I've played that you can have a genuine conversation with a person that is chilling in the same area.

Met a guy doing tree gnome village, and I just got done talking to him about life and whatnot. We've been keeping each other accountable too, and we plan on bossing once we get our skills up there.

Attack one healer, switch prayer, attack another, switch prayer until you have all four off. I know it seems stressful at the time but jad takes like 5 seconds to attack it’s actually quite a long time.

For real though, runescape the way it was immediately before eoc was my favourite

Plenty of content, but no eoc

I remember hunting lumby spiders to craft stuff from their webs to sell at the ge

Can’t do that in osrs

A true classic. A masterpiece of our time. What more could we possibly need. 
---
ok
---
Nope, gl finding another 
---
That's quite the theory. So instead of saying "nah fam, I just have a kid" he decided to let everyone think he was dead?
---
Its got to be the only option, I have had about 4 different accounts now and every time I do the 2 step Authenticator dungeon I have to pick the fancy boots. 😁
---
Yea, have 80 attack 85 strength. 
---
What level magic or attack would be an efficient time to start?
---
Thank god...
---
Imagine playing a game for fun rather than efficiency 
---
life is simpler at 13 def where my BiS for almost everything is Addy gloves and slayer helm i lol
---
Because cool people talk about moms still and called their dick a joystick. Please tell me you’re at least in middle school...
---
Yah but who needs them separate when you can have them both at the same time. 
---
I must be in the same boat as you.  Two years and she just lost feelings for me.  I spent so much time wondering why I wasn't enough for her.  But that's never on us my man.  It hurts, it always will.  But I promise you, you are worth it to someone.  You are worth it to me bc I don't feel so alone now knowing someone else going through this.
---
Tassets are basically the last thing you're gonna want to upgrade.
---
For instance, you'll likely want primordials and a torture amulet before tassets.
---
If you have all that, though, i'd go tassets and chest over sgs personally.
---
You’ll probably find a way to break the speed of light before I hit level 2 RC.
---
i don't know about after the buff/nerf week or two, but before it was 27.5% per seed for a nest for a redwoodhouse, and subtract 2.5% for each lower tier of log. now it somehow depends on levels too.

Just invested in 83 construction, what are the essentials for my house? Planning on getting Rejuv Pool, Ornate Jewelry Box, fairy ring, spirit trees, and an armour stand. Should I get a portal nexus or the individual portals? If individual, which portals would be most beneficial.
---
You can lose neither. Just fix the recovery system (by using one time passwords or gov ID) and there's literally no way to ever having your account compromised if you have auth on both email and the account.
---
If the delay comes into play, something is already REALLY wrong. No one else should ever have access to your account. That's the whole point of account security. Fix the security system, don't add a "fix" that MIGHT help after I got fucked
---
That's how I learned to type so fast

You just went full retard.

You made your entire graduating class in on the act. Legendary.

That’s my secret.

Or you could carry a melee switch to take advantage of the combat triangle, instead of just expecting everything to be handed to you.

It's your fucking email account. This isn't tech support. Is this seriously the first time an email has been caught by your spam folder?

For your first question I think it's because they stand where other people typically stand to get the most publicity possible

Even with a guide going step by step to solve the puzzle this quest is still ASS
---
I feel you but like... just have a bit of discipline and don't.  There are multiple ways to do this: don't ever go to the duel arena. EVER. Invest all your money in items so you'd have to sell your bank (which takes some time and would make you realize what you're doing), never allow yourself to buy a tentacle whip.  Think of it as great practice before you ruin your life with actual gambling.
---
You can't ban all url gambling but u sure as hell can avoid it like the plague 
---
Ah yes, the stat track addy full helm
---
If you have rigour then probably, if not i doubt it
---
You're a god
---
I think the BiS prayer boots AND BiS stab boots are a pretty good drop for a level 84 Slayer monster tbh.
---
I got all the bitches once I got lvl 2 runecrafting 
---
Goddamn nice. You’re so close. The 97-99 grind is so fun, at least it was when I did agility. You’re so motivated to just end it and you’re so used to all the routines of it. Reg or btw? 
---
logging into rs3 made me depressed
---
I remember spamming world one for 10-15 minutes at a time waiting for the world to open up. 
---
Regen bracelet, zerker ring, fury, fully obby armor, and obby shield let's you max hit 2's without pots or prayer. 
---
Shit he's on to us
---
No, you were depressed before 
---
Not really 
---
I don’t use clan or trade. Private was off because I was hopping a bunch for an empty world for the screenshot. 
---
Perhaps. Everyone could use some self-improvement. But don't let it get to your head; you simply can't please everyone, no matter what you are.
---
Nexus makes the most sense. Less space required.
---
Thanks for the advice I guess my best bet is just staying away from the tent whip
---
Also not high enough combat level 
---
😥
---
Sure bro. I left 10k for you in the stronghold of security. Enjoy :).
---
And you don't really have to invest 200 million on anything to live comfortably. Even 1 million would do fine if you own your apartment/house(s)

I used his guides getting my quest cape. Ever since I just the wiki. He's really good and does it all in real time. Except that monkey madness 2 quest lol.

Yup. 6 boots in 363 mediums. 4 wizards and b2b sandals, but no rangers :( 
---
I would love that

Definitely requires engine work

Just give me your card info and I’ll get some bonds for you bro

maybe change it back to the original color

Didn’t see a reliable link on amazon, is it available somewhere else?

This would probably be balanced too lmao.

Looks like he's joking lol

Depends. If you’ve done firecape you know how jad can be

Zulrah is a safe fight so it can be easier to learn

Wildy bosses typically are medium difficulty, some can be safespotted but pkers can make your life hell

I just made a tutorial on buying tiers as well. Feel free to ask any questions
---
This isn't outperforming any other prayers. It's combining them in an affordable and convenient way.
---
I don't know about you, but having a high prayer level just makes me appreciate the low drain prayers even more, as they become an almost "permanent" fixture of every trip. I'd rather leave this on and gain a little power as opposed to enabling Piety for 2 minutes or flicking it for 20 and gaining a ton of power.
---
I don’t flaunt my stupidity by posting a screenshot talking about someone’s mom on my dick and defending it by blaming once again the rum. 
---
Right thats what I’m wondering, They’d have to know your differing passwords (hopefully they’re not the same) AND on top of that they’d have to know your bank pin to get anything thats not equipped.
---
People probably clicking risqué links for that FREE 10 MIL just follow this link.
---
It's an exploitation of a feature that was never intended to exist. If prayer flicking was intended, there would be no such thing as a prayer bonus.
---
I like how you thought this was a serious post
---
Someone should organize a Runescape rat race... with stops that have challenges.

Oh dang, thanks. I'll be sure to give that a try in future.

Ye Konar is really bad for anyone except super casual players that just AFK slay without ever paying attention. People had a lot of points stocked up for Hydra on release to farm it but now that the hype died down and Konar's task list is ass, a lot of higher level players (the ones that kill Hydra) just avoid Konar because of how bad she is for efficiency.
---
If you think i was being serious then you shouls probably uninstall reddit because theres a lot of humor that you wouldnt get and would probaby just upset you as much as this did
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** cob_1311! ^(hug)
---
An imbued slayer helmet is literally the same thing. This triple-school boost already exists and is one of the most convenient and amazing features in the entire game.
---
Imagine having to switch from one slayer helmet to another so you can use a different type of combat. Sounds pretty stupid, huh? It's because you already subconsciously desire a convenient one-fits-all solution. The only difference is, what I am proposing is nothing close to as powerful as a slayer helmet. It's also way more expensive than flicking a tier 70 prayer.
---
Hollow Reed, mint cake, loar remains, tons of stupid niche trash items.
---
Nice! That's almost equivalent to like level 100 on osrs
---
I'll give that a try. Recommended gear set up? I mean I could YT it but I'd prefer some other perspective.
---
I'd use this prayer on both.
---
Is it members only, just wanting to know in advance so I can sell all my noob stuff. Seems like a good investment I think I have around 4 mill in items
---
When you walk past any ironman at all.
---
It does though...?
---
It does?
---
I see what happened, it wasnt a glitch.
---
I'll explain it here. I'll refer to the player in ancients as player 1, and the second person to attack you in the video as player 2.
---
Right before the point in the video where you got skilled, you were in combat with player 2. He stopped attacking you and ran into the building.
---
At this point, the game ASSUMES he is the only person you attacked, and ignored anything that happened before you attacked player 2. 
---
Player 1 then splashes (does not hit you or damage you), and immediately afterwards is when you click to attack player 1. This counts as the "first attack" in this engagement between you and player 1, since you were in combat with player 2 in single-zone before attacking player 1, thus skulling you.
---
If he didn't splash, you wouldn't have been skulled.
---
This one isn't as toxic as that, but I just saw it not too long ago

I am a btw, btw. I've actually been doing ToB lately so the grind has slowed. I did 2.6m xp last week so this week I'm a little burnt on it, probably will only do like 1.5m xp then finish up by Friday.
---
Hell yeah that’s nostalgia and pure AIDS at the same time
---
People are vicious. I’m actually really friendly in task spots. 
---
Not really, you were insecure with your own data.  Logins/emails/passwords you willingly gave info to a 3rd party by being phished.  Your account will never be safe again on runescape, only for the most highly visible people in the community does Jagex put notes or lock accounts (which means suspend recoveries).  Good luck but your chances are slim to none. 
---
I’m pretty sure they’ve said they don’t do this. 
---
Here we go again. Everyone who supports more security gets down voted. Makes a ton of sense, this community is great.
---
??????? Jagex literally gives you a tool to avoid people you don't like. That's not asking someone to "change" because of bullies, that's not being a fucking retard by keeping a target on your back for literally no reason.
---
Turn it to friends. What are you going to miss out on? The few spammers trying to advertise a gold selling site to you? 
---
That cc is a hive of scum, but in this case that's clearly a joke.
---
those aren't skinny jeans, those jeans would be what is called slim fit. They just happen to be skinny fellas so the slim is accentuated.

Create an ironman mode that prevents the use of stores, so players can be genuinely self sufficient and create all their supplies themselves.

My sister told me she played it once at her job lifeguarding and they played it at every lifeguard party thereafter. It's actually a good song.

you dont have to fill it, mine only has like 7 teles cause i dont use any other ones. havent even got the highest upgrade yet.

if you only use 3 portals you make a good argument though, its only a time saver when you start needing more than that.

I’m sorry that this isn’t helpful to your post, but how can you check ping? Is that a client feature?
---
You're Wrong.. first off, the game doesn't assume things. It's programmed to do certain things.
---
Second, he's in combat with both of them during the video.

This guy knows what the *fuck is up!*

Yea I’m 57 agil with 3 pieces. I’m fucked too lol. 
---
Void and Dhide are definitely close but I think since void is a % boost it’s only better than hides at very high range levels and with rigour. Also hides have much better defense so you don’t have to bank as much. You can plug different things into a dps calc if you want 
---
I think it was cute when we were kids, but ain't nobody got time for that now.
---
💕💕
---
&gt;That made me lol so hard once I noticed it
---
Glossed over your post and read "Lol that made me so hard once I noticed it"
---
Network congestion also has an influence on ping.  As well as almost everything else.  
---
I don't think this is correct, but I'm not going to say I'm 100% certain you're wrong.  
---
But on a separate note: Splashing doesn't count as attacking someone (in regards to skulling)? Forgive me if it's a stupid question. As I said, very new to PKing.  
---
ngl I needed this right now
---
You're probably high alch'ing or something. As everyone else stated, combat skills that do damage will give you HP exp..utility and splashes will net you 0. 
---
&gt;that wont cost an arm and a leg to actually kill
---
Go fish karambwans and just use that instead of buying food. 
---
congrtulations! I also really haven’t meant people and I know how

this game is meant to be played with friends, so if you want to add me in-game feel free to do so! IGN is same as my reddit username :)
---
You probably wanna upgrade your boots
---
Possibly? Not quite sure
---
queef more like it
---
H
---
Funny, that's actually exactly what I said when they nerfed it 30% on release day.  I was saying how the original amount was debatably too low already.  
---
I guess I'll be interested to see whenever somebody eventually does the research and figures out exactly what you give up by using Konar, in exchange for that 150k/hr and the possibility of Hydra tasks.
---
As a side note, is there any chance Jagex would add Hydras to other masters (Duradel)?  Having a great boss like that locked behind a seemingly useless slayer master seems kind of sad.
---
No, it's the deathstreak from MW2 which is red (im pretty sure)
---
Nah the commentating is the good part and it pretty much carries the video. 
---
I mean... he or she probably didnt have someone ask them nicely in a while
---
At the time it wasn't. 
---
Of course it doesnt actually assume it like a person, I'm a software engineer I know how programs work. I'm abstracting it so it's easier to understand how the program runs, I'm not giving technical terms to how it actually works.
---
And he's in combat with one of them in single-combat zone, and then switches to the second one while still in single-combat zone. Here's a step by step of what happens:
---
User is hit by player 2.
---
User hits player 2.
---
Player 2 stops attacking, player is no longer in combat.
---
Player 1 splashes user.
---
User hits player 1, user's hit is the first one to actually hit.
---
What is your longest farming contract streak using the "optimal method" of planting everything beforehand? Just hit a 4 contract streak and I'm wondering just how lucky you could get
---
Best damn vinyl I own
---
Wear rune plate and legs, a mystic hat, rfd gloves, mystic boots, use slayer dart if you don’t have ibans, you can do 1 run per trip and back each round, one invent of swords and 1 pray pot are enough to get to chest. Do Dharok and Karils with full prayer first, the rest you can manage. 
---
It really do be like that
---
Oh boy I feel for you, I had all my marks by 58!

Best of luck!

I mean does it matter what level he is, begging is begging, if he does it everyday people probably do give him money

Every decision has tradeoffs and convenience is one factor.

Where are the party balloons?!

https://runescape.backstreetmerch.com/en-us/artist/runescape/vinyl/original-soundtrack-classics-double-deluxe-vinyl
---
&gt;User is hit by player 2.
---
&gt;User hits player 2.
---
&gt;Player 2 stops attacking, player is no longer in combat.
---
&gt;Player 1 splashes user.
---
&gt;User hits player 1, user's hit is the first one to actually hit.
---
First of all, BOTH p1 and p2 had prior attacked user.
---
Second of all, that's NOT at all how multi/single cmb functions.
---
Third, splashing DOES count as initiating a cmb sequence and would not cause user to skull up if he attacked someone who splashed on him. Even if it did, refer to my "first of all"
---
Did you shanty her sea? 
---
He is saying he also has a shit drop rate but his is not as bad as the other guys’, but it still sucks
---
You're just talking nonsense. This was never the case in RS2. 
---
\//\
---
I've never understood why PC just didn't have simple bosses in place of the portals.
---
It's the perfect environment to introduce players to basic boss mechanics, like prayer switching, dodging or de-aggroing. If I had something like that, I would've began bossing way sooner.
---
Just 3 recolored versions of your design in place of the portals, and a chance of rolling a pet at the end. Boom, PC is fun again. 
---
who
---
I mean, I'm not saying Patriots DID delfate footballs with the void knight deflector, but it looks kinda sharp... So, I'm also not saying that they COULDN'T have. 
---
Support, but only if you have to do the head banging emote every time.
---
Ffdn36
---
That's fair, I feel like if more people tried bossing, more people would enjoy it. I just got into it recently and it's a lot of fun.
---
The combination of that, and recently getting elite void made me think this up. 
---
Awesome
---
Or the one where they sell full Guthan's, but put up a leaf-bladed spear instead and its noted so you cant tell as easily
---
Get spellbook swap pls
---
Thank you!

Omg like the name of the game lol
---
Everything changed when the free trade restrictions attacked.
---
Who tf would buy that
---
Jesus this is cringe. I love it.
---
youre actually dumb as shit if you think his friends would bother repeatedly hijacking instead of actually just taking his stuff when they log onto his account
---
And like that it do be.
---
Also going to do something I never did before, I first played Runescape in 2005, I was 8 years old. I always looked up guides and then did the quest.
---
This time, I'm going to have more casual fun and find about quest through actually exploring the game. (Unless I get stuck that is). 
---
:)
---
Other people's strangers may seem like your own because they look aggressive, but they cant fight with you because they are not spawned by you. The same happened to me outside of ge, and I only noticed after a while.
---
if all you're going to do in a thread like this is accuse OP of wrongdoing then just shut up.
---
yeah that's what I ended up doing. Thank you.
---
Nice job! Cooking is one of the best looking imo
---
Yea I’ll fight u if u use eek
---
upvoted for visibility,hope you get some help
---
As soon as you look at your phone after studying you pretty much have to reread it again because you’ll almost granted forget. People need to just commit time to studying haha
---
You cut 2 lines that we're halfway through which confused me on how you got random gibberish in the game for a solid sec
---
This happened to me and that's how I lost dclaws. It happened in a much stranger way, but barrage was also involved. You can see how he barrages his friend instead of you, for some odd reason when you barrage another person and attack the  barrager afterwards (at the right time), you end up skulling somehow.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA2iTT7YJzQ
---
You can see here, I attacked him and didn't skull up. Then when he barraged the other guy and I snared him, I instantly skulled. I reported this to Jagex ages ago, they don't really care. Unless a youtuber cries to Jagex about it, nothing will be done and it won't be fixed.
---
Oh my...
---
Thanks man, I really do appreciate it.

This is why there should be one weekend a month or so that the ge staff take a break and force old school trading.

gz m8 but wheres ur rune pouch? u should have 1 by the time ur zulrahing
---
Well that's sort of a question only you can answer. Since it's an MMO you can do whatever the hell you want and work towards whatever goals you set yourself. 
---
So if you want some direction just ask yourself what you want - do you want to make money? Do you want to get your combat stats up? Once you've answered that you can come back here and ask some more specific questions that are much easier for us to answer.
---
Agreed. And "Herblore" pretenses further uses than just making potions

Slayer so you can make money, and for learning the game go for quest cape, will take you all across the world and make you level up skills

---
I'll give the guides a look, something that interested me the most was blacksmithing imo, so I'll look into that. ty.
---
haha okay they made him just a lil guy
---
Dude, Sprite kicks ass.
---
I'm mostly interested in blacksmithing/mining right now and I'd like to capitalise on that. But right now, as some other answers have said, I'll probably look into doing some early quests to learn a bit more about OSRS.
---
yeah you're pretty sad. I kinda pity you?m, haha
---
I wouldn’t say it’s a minority but I definitely agree that osrs could use a graphics overhaul 
---
thanks man
---
I got very fucking lucky and got a visage from steels after like 40 kills, sold it and bought a dragon chain to complete the sick set.
---
Fell for "free sharks show invy" scam and bought 27 sharks for 20m. Took ages to realise my cash was gone and I fucking raged, couldn't believe people like that existed.
---
Never fallen for a scam again.
---
I said that RSHD should happen and got slated for it lol 😂 
---
You'd have the accuracy of slightly above par mystics, so basically infinity and still be severely under ancestral. I think it would be fine.
---
Sydney. I have the same issue.
---
I was about to say the same thing...but in a much nicer tone lol
---
Magic vs Ranged cost for combat: e.g. Rune arrows are &lt;20g per shot considering only 20% chance to break, Chaos runes 100g per shot, and better spells only get more expensive.
---
Is using magic for combat just extraordinarily expensive compared to Ranged, or am I missing something?
---
avas?
---
I litteraly cannot think of anything where you utilise the different damage boosts of an imbuid slayer helmet  apart from a few slayer boss tasks.
---
you're right
---
Share I tb’d
---
I like what you’ve done to try and make the fight different to it’s RS3 counterpart (given the obvious changes). Given that, I wouldn’t mind her looking identical.

shits fucking sad bruhh legit nothing you can do and people STILL argue we don't need better security 
---
Also, this is usually a scam with the buyer working with the original seller and never actually going through with the trade. Common in Eve Online.
---
I bet who ever wrote this post has just a huge penis 
---
True, they're probably just dry for titles after posting 1-2 a day haha
---
But that’s the whole point of merching.
---
If you’re in a hurry you buy items above the market price and sell your own items below the market price.
---
People still do this with the GE, they simply press the 5% lower button to sell their stuff instantly if they want to. Or wait longer times if they want to sell 5% or more above the market value.
---
The difference is that it’s more automated and that it takes away a huge part of merching since you can just keep your offers in the GE and wait till tomorrow till it sells. Huge disadvantage for a merchant.
---
Yeah. Just remove it. Ge was a mistake that barely passed.
---
Hey there. I was plagued by the same exact issue. Every night at 9PM sharp (EST) the ping would skyrocket to 500+. At that point I too had Wide Open West Internet (Gigabit Service). 
---
I too made a post to reddit a few months ago but really only attracted trolls with no real useful input to the problem. I had multiple service lead technicians and engineers out to my house and they told me sorry not our problem. 
---
Interestingly enough, it doesn’t seem to be their problem. However, the weird part is, I swapped over to Spectrum when they started offering Gigabit service at my address for a better price and it’s never happened since. My average ping (before the 9PM apocalypse) was around 40-60ms. With spectrum my ping is &gt;20ms at any time throughout the day.

Whatever the issue was I’m glad switching to Spectrum fixed it for me. I was getting home from work just in time to get screwed out of playing OSRS at a reasonable ping. No bossing. No prayer flicking. From 9PM to about 10-11PM.

---
Whats your username man bro, I'll be you're friend.
---
I’ll buy it
---
This is why you read dialogue instead of guides. Don't be a sheep.
---
Yeah, there was also alcohol, because in Denmark you can buy alcohol at the age of 16.
---
You need actual info for that. The more common method is hacking a user's email and then recovering the account with that access. 2FA on your email and an authenticator on your OSRS account is 100% secure. It can't be removed unless by you or someone that knows your account recovery info.
---
Even if all that goes through, there's still a PIN delay with zero know methods to hack a PIN or skip the PIN delay.
---
RS3 is honestly gorgeous, and has a lot of features I really, really like. Unfortunately after loading up for a few hours, checking a couple things out, I met like 3 players, and each one was floating around, cosmetic spamming, etc. I just cant put up with that. 
---
Congrats man ! I’d love to come to your next 
---
At least your bank value is more than OPs bank
---
Bet this dude is rocking a Wil Anderson hair cut

If you don’t want to jump to members just yet you could raise your skill levels up a bit more like Range,Mage &amp; Cooking. If you want to jump to membership do the waterfall quest. Super quick and easy to do especially if you use a quest guide online. Search for the Gnome quests and do those as well. It’ll be a long quest but look into Monkey Madness and Recipe for Disaster after that. If you get bored and want to level your combat I’d highly recommend looking into slayer guides online to help and go from there! Down the line there decent money makers too. 
---
Do whatever you want.  All your stats are low, level them.  Complete all f2p quests.
---
No it's not.
---
This is all speculation by a bunch of users who don't know anything about security.
---
2FA on your email plus an authenticator and you CANT BE HACKED unless someone has had previous access to your accounts and email addresses that you've used in the past, or they know all your recovery info.
---
Even then, you can't skip the PIN delay once they're in the account.
---
tbf some people actually just enjoy that. I loved that I could make the game fully revolve around merching. I still can now with G/E but it just doesn't feel as fun. It's like the comparison between a stick shift and auto... Auto does everything for you but the stick lets YOU be in control.  It was like another aspect of the game, another skill if you will, just one that wasn't tracked by stats but by the GP you earned. Good times...
---
That's nothing compared to when I take the quest guide's advice to "bring lots of good food" but by the time I've completed the quest, I've eaten maybe twice and thrown away a lot of food to make space for items.
---
Use print screen

if you got denied twice means you are not original owner 4head, maybe try and get the account details right, making a post on reddit wont do you any good/help

There's an account age/quest point minimum for using the GE, however yes, i think we need something else to stop them even accessing the ge.  That said a lot of the spamming comes from high level accounts that have been hijacked.
---
The option to add a vork head to the ranging cape to give it the assembler stats, while also removing the stats of the cape would work.

this shit the best lmao

I had untrimmed farming for a few years and accidentally trimmed it a few weeks ago at 33m XP when I got 99 strength :(

I'm surprised no one has mentioned it yet but just before you skull one player runs into the church and his white dot on the mini map disappears for a second and reappears. Basically he logs into a different account, probably with a similar name and cb lvl.

That build is generally referred to as ”piety pure” or med level

---
since the Barbarian Assault Minigame has a pet reward, could Castle Wars and Pest Control please have one too? here's the suggestion: https://i.redd.it/egzb0t8t5pr01.png
---
Weed is degenerate
---
Diary rewards aren't too immersion breaking if you think of them as like a town relic, their diary tasks are the 'initiation' like the Fremennik Trials to become a Fremennik.
---
Slayer only spots though... I guess are analagous to people setting up animal breeding farms with the express purpose of cashing in the grown animal for a reward like when you have invasive species bounties or whatever.
---
Maybe it's just me, but RuneScape has never been an immersive game.
---
How can I optimized points from NMZ using Guthan's in rumble mode endurance? I get about 30k points per hour at CB level 98. Using count draynor, skeletal warhound, khazard warlord, the kendal, tree spirit and king roald (so 6 enemies, not 5). It's slow, but since I'm afk training it is okay I guess? Just wondered if I could do better.
---
Currently I'm still using a glory amulet, but rather than upgrading to fury, is it worth it to instead equip a Salve Amulet (e)? I imagine it would work against the skeletal warhound and maybe tree spirit (or is that nog a ghost?). Does it work against count draynor?
---
Lmao nice

---
Sort out lava whips/tent whips/avernic defender/imbued rings (untradeables in general deep wild)
---
The reward you get from a kill should match the target's risk.
---
Blowpipes and tridents should also drop their ammunition on death. 
---
Any other form of ranging/maging in the wilderness risks ammunition.

Cosmetic overload makes it look like a game of club penguin

Completely agree. I cant get over it

No thanks.
---
Torags is already used for cheap tank gear. 
---
Not to mention that buffing it serves no purpose. There will **always** be useless sets or items. If you buff one item, other items will be less used and potentially become useless. 
---
Also, people (like you?) are hoarding these kind of useless items and keep making threads to buff them. They don't care about the item itself, but only care about the potential profit they'll make.

You do not need a slayer helmet, you only need the Black Mask. And the bonuses it gives only applies on slayer tasks, and if you're just training offtask at the moment, don't use it.

I'd do slayer, you might be able to do Zulrah but it can take a while to learn and get your first successful kill.

If you've done mm2 you can start doing demonic gorillas on a black demon task. Might be a bit slow with 75 range and it takes a little to get good at killing them.
---
And so do most people. Osrs didn't have ge when it launched in 2013. The nostalgia of spamming "buy 1k lobster" gets old after 1 minute. GE is definitely one of the best updates ever.

---
Not many players go back to Pest Control after achieving Elite Void... Maybe upon release players will do it for the rewards, but once players have bought their rewards, the only people I can realistically see playing this would be people going for experience (UIM for 99 prayer, tanks for 99 def, etc)...
---
I think you'd struggle to find a team of 4 players a few months after release and it would be dead content..

I want to point out that the deflector wouldn't be BIS in anywhere near the same amount of places as RS2. Majority of slayer tasks would be far better with blowpipe, majority of bosses would be better with TB/Blowpipe. 
---
Deflector would be used at Hydra and would probably be BIS with DHCB, it would probably be used at Kree'Arra too. Outside of that? Chinning maybe?
---
Basically everywhere TB is used, deflector could be used as a secondary option. I imagine it would probably devalue twisted buckler though.
---
No, it’s saying society is ignorant to the sacrifice of war.

You don't get my point.

My Question was: Is promoting a phising site illegal?
---
Not: Is it legal when people steal my rs bank?

I got the ranger at my second med scroll to!!!!

It means your account doesn’t get recovered. 
---

---
Fighting the abyssal sire is kind of annoying right now.
---
One issue is that running around to avoid the poison pools almost always requires a right-click, since the spawns get in the way of your left-click when you have attack options set to left-click. This could be solved by giving the sire itself a "fight" option instead of attack, so the sire could still be attacked when players have their attack options set to right-click/hidden. This subject was brought up on the q&amp;a a while back, but nothing ever came of it.
---
Being able to left-click the ground in the sire fight would make fighting the boss on mobile a much more realistic prospect.
---
Another issue with the abyssal sire is that when it gets hit to trigger its phase changes, it never takes damage even if the hit was successful. This feels very clunky. Could it be made so the sire's changes phase more like zulrah, where the damage carries over?
---
I think it is because this sub is quite USA dominated and many here are young males. That correlates with a right wing political attitude, and that again correlates with the use of the word snowflake. Used as an insult for people who disagree with these political views. The accusation is that they feel special and unique, like these area only ironmen.

I was wondering this the other day too. I reported the dude for being off topic/trolling a lot and figured maybe some mod had slammed him. But this makes the situation seem even weirder. It’s possible he was just farming karma to sell his account.
---
As long as you download it from the correct source, there are some imposter clients which will conpromise your account. 
---
&gt; make it so you get to prevent the inevitable hijacking and then Re secure your account before losing anything?
---
Just secure your account properly and there is no "inevitable hijacking". You don't need to re secure your account or deal with the headache of being hacked if you use the tools already available and have some common sense when browsing the internet.
---
To log in now you need to know:
---
* Email/original account name
---
* Password
---
* A physical device giving you the authenticator code
---
If you don't take the half hour to secure your account properly, whose fault is it really?
---
&gt; why is there one for pin removals?
---
Bank pin exists because at the time, the only account security was a password that you could very easily have compromised.

If you are going for points and not xp, it's better to enable as many bosses as possible, but it won't be very afk.

The beekeeper random event was disabled for mobile users a while back. Could the beekeeper event be disabled for desktop users as well? This would slightly increase the chance of getting a more useful random event like a genie or dr jekyll.
---
I think promoting a phising site is not legal, but I think facebook prioritize banning real phising site over banning phising sites that steal ingame money.

Exactly. Having to actually manage your mouse apm is one of the main things that sets osrs apart from all the "hot keys for absolutely everything" cookie cutter MM0s

It doesn't matter what auth app you use. A lot of different apps support the "generic blue tokens" which are required for RS. For example if you use two factor auth for twitch/humble you have Authy, you can use Authy for RS if you'd like. Authy has the advantage that you can put it behind a finger print reader on your phone and it's also backed to your phone number, so an extra layer of security. 
---
Note that Authy's default two factor is different than the generic blue token RS uses and that the google authenticator app supports.
---
They literally all just hopped wtf help me find them
---
I hope he’s alright. No matter how much shit i throw at him I don’t want him to get hurt.
---
It's super afk. You'll only need to setup 1 trap and it takes around 45s to catch a monkey. This will give 1k exp. (Around 80k-100k exp at lower levels)
---
To setup a trap you need 1 banana. You can bring bones to peaches tabs and pick up the bones (Theres tons of them). This makes it a little less afk. What I did was bring 20 baskets of bananas (5). That will last you a while. 
---
You'll need to complete mm2 and have the kruk's greegree though.
---
Pretty sure it's the same person 
---
You're a god damn hero in my eyes because 80+ is unplayable for me. I feel too spoiled right now
---
Then fix the recovery system instead of adding security features that do nothing to secure your account.
---
hes just on his way to the beach...
---
Allow the mage arena staffs to store the runes they use inside of them.
---
This is a small thing, but can we make the +1 boost you get from putting on skillcape/hitting 'Boost' a permanent effect as long as you're wearing a skillcape? Other than a max Cape, I can't think of a situation where this would harm the game in any way. If you can infinitely boost one level, then why not just have it there permanently? It seems like a rather useless perk when you have to reapply it every 60 seconds.

---
Can you make it so each minimap orb (hp, prayer, run, spec) can be toggled on/off separately? Currently the spec orb is totally useless for many activities and I'd prefer if I could turn it off.
---
Upgrade the mace to have a spec that consumes all the remaining spec and converts it to run energy (or it too OP, maybe at a rate of 1:2, ie 100% spec restores 50% run energy) or maybe to not devalue staminas, make it like the  dragon battleaxe so that it drains stats a little, maybe boosts defense tho, while restoring run energy, idk
---
While back they said it probably wouldn’t be possible for them to allow the damage to carry over to the next phase due to how dire is coded.
---
Yeah dawg, sprinkle some kindness on your words and shit gets done easier. Crazy.

I would go as far as to say all game companies who can't produce more than one successful product in 10+ years of being established are bad companies (imo). OSRS to Jagex is basically what Skyrim is to Bethesda except Bethesda have other successful games on top of that lol.

Hey all - just went mems last week and am so lost in a few areas.
---
Had full rune armor and just upgraded to Dragon platelegs. Will eventually work towards Fighter Torso but haven't had a chance to do that yet. Meelee stats are 61/61/60.

Should I still be using a rune scim until I do MM for D scim? Any suggestions on gloves/boots (currently using fighting boots) for when I do meelee slayer tasks?
---
Bush yield improvements.
---
Please be dead
---
Great idea, would prefer the boat to face a different direction though, and the 2 middle portals to be on East/West sides rather than being south from north portal and Souther from North portal, especially if they're random this saves having to run around the 2nd portal when the 3rd drops barrier first 
---
I’d either take heavy ballista spec or ags/gmaul so you can combo

cant wait to see what people come up with lol

What the fuck. How??

“Waterskins will soon be necessary in Lumbridge if we dont act now!”

He did get less hostile reactions elsewhere on reddit though. I could understand quitting /r/2007scape but not reddit in general. Hopefully he's just on a holiday or made some lifestyle changes.
---
Why does that look like V the Victim 
---
On a similar note can the master clue step involving Viggora be changed. It doesn't make much sense that a clue step should depend on an account bound random roll during a mini quest to decide if you should have to go into wildy or not.
---
Devalues my monotonous, agonizing grind for void
---
 
---
Jk I love the idea
---
As someone who has never bossed i think more people don't try it because of the presentation around it. Its all max combat characters with gear worth more than my entire bank 5 fold. It makes it seem really inaccessible especially without clear information on what the recommended stats are for each boss.  
---
This is my point though. They might have been shit games but they were successful in sales terms at least.
---
The only "new" product Jagex have had success with is their original RS game turning into RS3 as it's basically a different game now.
---
FunOrb was successful for a few years and had a lot of potential. I think the lack of marketing and moving with the times (mobile) is why that venture eventually failed too. It doesn't take a genius CEO to realise that they could have simply moved to mobile to save FunOrb games instead of working on Transformers and other crap that didn't even see the light of day.
---
Hahaha how much money have you lost on shill coins you autistic fuck lmfao.

MMK is a scape goat and gets given the burden of breaking the bad news. It wasn’t his decision to ban runelite or most of the things he has had to talk about.

Why? Everyone knows about climate change in the west and that renewable energy is the future. Go to Asia/Africa where they are building shit loads of coal power plants and annoy them with your street blocking, shitty signs and reeeing.

Yep. I kinda gave up on then after FO4.

Same here. After trying it out for a week to give it an actual chance, it's still incredibly daunting to work my way about the UI. I can never find which menu something has that I'm looking for and I spend more time on the rs3 wiki than really playing the game since I have to relearn a ton of things.
---
One thing I can say though is that the voice acted quests are extremely well done. They feel like they have a purpose and I  had a ton of fun working my way to unlock Menaphos. The game is downright beautiful and smooth as butter compared to old-school. 
---
It's the BiS for mining, and mining alts are fairly popular. To an amethyst alt the pickaxe could be 15m GP and you'd still profit fairly quickly.
---
So when you take into account that everything else has been rising(Black masks, Obby Capes, Blowpipe, Trident) it makes sense that one of the best profit % increases in the game would rise in price. 6m to afk from 72-99 mining is also very worth it as you'll easily make that money in ores then can sell off the pick should you not want to mine anything.

Is it possible to organize the teleports on the pharaoh’s sceptre and make “wield” the default left-click option. It can be frustrating accidentally clicking on it in the inventory and teleporting, and when right-clicking the teleports are just so cluttered with the other options.

Take a seat, dear

You guys remember the obby cape scam where you’d switch a noted obby cape for a noted cape with purple trim as they were getting their money ready?

I got lucky when I first started. I got one at 73 kc. I then promptly went like 700ish dry. But then I've had 3 on one task multiple times and also another 800 dry. RNG is weird and my average drop rate is about 1/200 over more than 20 shards. Keep trying lol

Wow this is actually pretty great! Upvote!!

I think it was troll stronghold where he had me laughing my ass off. Hes like "Now we can walk all the back down, but fuck that! *Uses tele*

The point is that the seed packs are such a great source of seeds that you have surplus which is a significant boost for ironmen. You don't have to do so many contracts to get net positive seeds. You don't have to do as many as you have done. That's the point.
---

I plan on making a clan again once I can boss. I used to run one back in the day around pest control with a few hundred people. While I didn't know everyone obviously, it was still the highlight of my RuneScape career. 
---
ye, I just use guthans from start to finish, and halberd the toads you have to pray mage against. All you have to do is enable pray melee after every attack he does until you can see he's doing a different attack.

Really nice art there fella

How many people have you seen behind the bank? I’ll wait

Yeah but first I’m going to need you to hop

Coin gun :Galaxybrain: Jagex hire me
---
At each agility short cut that needs a grapple. Have the option to store one nearby with rope so that it can be used whoever you are there making it more useful. Once stored you can’t get it back and it stays there forever/ has durability 
---
Have the ability to store dragon axes with the kayaking guys for easier transportation up the river lum.  Once stored you can’t get it back and it works infinitely.
---
Add a minecart to Kebos so that you can get around kebos using transport methods outside of fairy rings and some jewellery that stick within the lore of the Zeah Continent.  To connect this to lore it could have been made as a lovrajki mining outpost or something? 
---
- if not a minecart, a teleport in the Arceuus spellbook would make a Ton of sense too and could be used/ part of Mod West’s rework of the spellbook that sounds awesome 
---
I also think the medium Kebos diary requirement needs to be changed that states “Travel to fairy ring”.   Why is another lazy requirement that is found in 5 other diaries still being used when it has zero relevance to kebos. If it was an Easter egg like the ardy zoo Fairy ring then it would make more sense, but this is just random. There are plenty of possible tasks you could add instead that fit into the theme of Kourend far better.
---
Yeah, hopefully he's just on a nice holiday and is taking a break from reddit. I'd imagine all the negativity would get to anyone eventually, even if they are trolling.  
---
Even if it was optional people would still whine if they can't play for a week. I'm just quoting mod steve w here.
---
You are a hero

We live in a society. 
---
They literally didn't do anything except buy Jagex, whether as an investment or just parking their money somewhere for other reasons. They never had any intent to actually manage or run Jagex, and they never tried to.
---
But my whole point is yes its good, but its even better for a normal account.  Which shows that its not an ironmeme specific content, like you said it was. 
---
Whats with all the hype around the song? Is it one of the most popular RS songs or something?
---
Yup that's a real fear at times :p
---
So far it hasn't been a problem, but before I start the autotype, I have to make sure OSRS's game window was the last window I had active. If I for some reason had a chat program as the last window that was in-focus, it'd happily autotype right to that window instead.

It's about wintertodt, a firemaking boss. You have the ability to cut logs and put them in a brazier, some people choose to fletch the logs instead for a 30% loss in XP but more points. Once you go to wintertodt you'll see about 15-20 people fletching and someone will occasionally say why fletch.

Can confirm i’m in his cc

Getting herbs seed as a passive reward is better than spamming master farmers / doing slayer. Since it's passive. You really have to get my point here, you seem like a smart guy.

Exactly, that’s what you want from a good investment holding company. They let the local leadership run the show as long as cash flow looks healthy.

**Mobile Suggestion:**

An orb you can place on the screen - when you are touching it, any other tap registers as an immediate right click. This would let you immediately switch between right and left clicking.

This would be *tremendously* helpful, and make a lot of content more playable on mobile.

So I tested by putting my rune pouch in my bank, and it worked. But it doesn't make sense, because it counted the law runes in my inventory \_(as there isn't enough in my pouch)\_, and I have enough air runes in both inventory and pouch, yet doesn't count?

&gt;Currently you have to attack wyrms twice. Can this be changed so you don't stop attacking after they 'pop up' (after the initial attack)?
---
That seems like a feature considering it's the exact behaviour from RS2/3's StrykeWyrms.
---
Papayas+calquats and mahoganies primarily have gotten me to 95 from like nothing over the past 6 months ish. Pretty cheap if you are like me and don’t have the nest egg for magics and palms. I’m also doing redwoods and hespori and contracts now.

I can't complain cause I'm averaging 120k a kill my the end of my trips but I don't get any uniques
---
EZ Money
---
Probably not to stop wasting ammo. If you hit Vorkath with a slow weapon as a DHCB, you might not have enough time to cast the crumble undead on the spider. It happens.
---
The barrows (excluding archer brother) have no magic defemce and no magic level. Because of this you can have a negative magic attack mod and still reliably hit them.
---
While we're at it, let me give the tool leprechaun 1000 of each tool because I keep forgetting to re-store them and I'd rather just throw money at the problem

Run scape, is how my mom use to call back in the day...

Of course you seriously try to use "white knight" in a discussion. That's all the confirmation I needed. 
---
Can you make the chemical pools at hydra more consistent? Sometimes they hit the hydra immediately after transformation but sometimes it takes like 6-7 game ticks and I’ve accidentally lured the hydra off the vent (after it’s been there for 3 full seconds) and it still has its defenses. 
---
Can you make my character immune to the flames ?
---
Should probably only work if skulled
---
I mean he probably never works with anything that hot, that level of heat always takes away from the actual flavor of the food. 
---
Capscaicin makes you think your mouth is literally on fire. Humans simply don't have a tolerance for that amount of heat unless you somewhat frequently eat stuff that hot.

If you want to see someone be a bitch, try dj Khaled. That's a legitimate bitch.

This was amazing! I thoroughly enjoyed most of these. I mean the NPC ones I disagree with a little but but for the most part I agree!
---
Well done, it being passive but not great is not better than guaranteed.  Doing the most efficient way of doing something is more efficient than inconsistently banking things that you'll never use.  Even if it requires input its still better than doing something that's unnecessary.   Doing battlestaves gets you awesome gp, its not the best xp which is why its not meta, sure the gp would help but its more efficient to just get the xp, farming is the same.  You will get the xp if you just do pre-contracts things, and doing contracts won't reduce your time to 99 as you will get too many of things you wont use whilst not getting enough of things you need.  Which is why MF is better.   I'm not saying farming contracts aren't good, I'm saying they are better to do on a normal account as they aren't that great for ironmen as we already have better methods. 
---
dib on the haters
---
we are talking pre-confirmation screen.  it was a fucking free for all
---
You should do everyone a favour and take your own advice. No one will notice a difference. 
---
Really small but when a ruby bolt(e) procs as vorkath is entering his white sploogie frozen phase, you don't deal any damage because he's immune to attacks but it still hurts you as the bolt spec usually would. Could this be changed to just not be able to proc a ruby bolt(e) effect when entering this phase?
---
Just to throw this out there, I just started an iron man a few days ago and have multiple times used tactical deaths to get free lumbridge teleports without the 30 min timer and also full run energy. Run energy has been the most annoying thing about an iron man.
---
Sounds like a cop out, but if you can honestly say maxing an account or even just playing for fun enhances your life, then who am I to criticize that?
---
I'm speaking more to the people putting in 8+ hours a day into their btw's. Unless you're a streamer earning a living, or someone like Woox and programming, I don't know how you can really feel good about that. 
---
Because its all degenerate
---
Bait
---
Ty
---
You click the floor first which is standard practice anyway
---
I use DHCB and there is still plenty of time to get off an attack and cast crumble undead without taking damage.  That being said, I wouldn't mind this change.  I was just offering a solution in the meantime.
---
I like the idea for the grappling hooks. If I need to use a specific shortcut a lot, I can just use a stored grapple there until it breaks, saving an inventory slot.
---
As for the axe part, I think it is a really cool idea, but if you wait until dragon axes, by the time people can use those, they typically have enough magic levels to tele Varrock and Lummy, making the update basically obsolete. Maybe at lower level axes it would work, but I do not see it being overly useful at dragon. The only difference is it would raise the value of the axe by decreasing the ingame quantity, as a lot of people would store one, effectively taking it out of the market.
---
I haven't played enough Zeah and Kebos content to comment on the other suggestions.
---
For me it personally never clicked. Granted, I haven't played RS3 since it came out. It could be worth looking into now.
---
Offer? 
---
That and Seer's.
---
agreed! just finished up last week after over a month of "working" on it. like, when I saw that desert treasure was one of the requirements, it was quite hurtful to my soul. these gloves are *marginally* better than the next best option though, so that's nice.

Oh no not degeneracy

You have a point. I despised EoC when it came out and it left a sour taste in my mouth as a result. I should give it another attempt, I heard they added a lot of unique things into the game recently as well. They apparently have voice acting these days?

With the shit Elon musk has done I legitimately have like .000001% of me that believes he would actually buy jagex to keep the memes alive
---
Did this happen this afternoon? Because it just happened to me. They somehow had access to my main's email-address but also to my alt's. I received emails but they got deleted instantly. They changed my email's passwords, as well as my runescape passwords. I'm for sure they've taken my inventory+gear, but because I cannot login to my account: I have no clue if they have access to my 1.5B bank (yes, I have a bank pin but I don't know if it got compromised.)
---
I have a pending recovery request with some details from the past + I've contacted Jagex Customer Support on Twitter, asking them to lock my account (which they apparently can't do.) I also changed my emails' passwords and put 2FA on them. Too late for that, I know, but maybe they can't get access to them anymore.
---
As I have absolutely no idea what to do besides those things: does any1 know what else I can do, at this moment? As of now, my laptop's internet is off because I don't know if it's my laptop or only my emails (the emails are connected to eachother). Malwarebytes didn't give me compromised stuff either. 
---
It might be part of the official game

Check your Runescape mail on the RS website.

Make tithe farm give more points per run.
---
Currently the full set of farmer's clothing requires tens of hours of constant playing of an extremely stressful game, where as things like lumberjacks, anglers are less than 2 hours to obtain.
---
To 2x spec you needed the dungeoneering ring and some timing. It used 54% spec with that ring. You had to use a magic longbow spec first, which brought you to 68% spec with the ring. Then you waited until 98%. Then you would attack someone right before you would gain another 10%. So you'd spec once with korasi then be 44% spec, then you'd have to get the 10% regeneration before your next attack to be 54% again. 
---
It's a bit confusing to explain.
---
I like the idea, some things to add would be elite void helm's and gloves and deflector. Same extra price as normal and give +3 prayer. If using 5 pieces of void you get another 3% damage increase (could be useful over a glove/shield slot). 
---
BUFF the Mage set, it's terrible. It should have a damage increase as well. 
---
Someone mentioned a buffed version of the mace.
---
Make the boss weaker to claw's of Guthix (thematically good). Instead of coins as a reward you get supplies for more runs preferably if they're limited to only being used in PC.

imo you should just watch sync's guide and do solos until your comfortable with the rooms and strats.

In a Group they might explain you something, but the guide does it even better and you will just get carried through without much time to practice.

Long requested QoL fix for mobile: Please make the chat bar button that opens the keyboard smaller or add a (toggleable) smaller button instead because when you have chat open it's extremely likely to misclick it and it's very annoying, specially when doing activities like bossing or slayer.

Yes that is possible but I don’t want it to play in screen capture. It becomes unsightly to see everything in the background

---
cheers
---
well 99 fm I think is a good idea! get that out of the way, and as far as gear goes, youd probably be better off spending that few mil on zulrah gear and doing that, I feel like it will be much more passive GP, not relying on chest piece drops. 
---
He acts super surprised for 300k pk's but at the same time goes "oh nice smited him for 2m" at other times lol
---
i thought so, just horrible rng i guess heh
---
mmh wow the person who knock on my door was your mum gg
---
This is why I quit my other iron after it was recovered twice. Used to stream on it and slowly I suppose someone gathered enough info to recover the account. Recovery system needs some work, although a delay on the authenticator would help--it wouldn't entirely solve the issue.
---
Up to about 35m XP and still don't have it. alch yourself
---
Youtube it
---
This can be done by any iron though and also in TOB aswell.  There are many mechanics in this game that can question the spirit of specific modes.   Do i think ultimate ironmen should be able to use bosses to store stuff?  Not really but they do.
---
Yeah, and your solution is to add authenticator delay which is only useful after your account is compromised?
---
Why not fix the problem in that accounts can be recovered by fixing the recovery system so your account security isn't breached at all?
---
How about being able to check quest/skill logs during afk-ish skills?
---
Right now opening those logs cancels the interaction (even switching between quests/minigames/diaries tabs does) and it would be a nice little QoL thing to be able to check quest requirements or to check when you can get your next unlock in a skill while cutting down a tree, fletching some bows or mining some ore :) 
---
I don't mind his voice but the way he pronounces "but" always gets a chuckle from me.
---
Don’t associate with the rabble
---
If you don't manually stop the attack, and it fires a bolt any time after the white freezing attack hits you, you will not have enough time to cast crumble before it hits you. Unless you got an incredibly lucky far spawn. It's just how it works.
---
And honestly its bad design. The easiest fix would be for them to register the damage of crumble undead faster so that you couldn't hit it, and it still walk 10 steps and explode if the server is lagging.
---
I agree with you more or less, I don't think he should loose his status, but they need to fix that. Its not like he can even use that shit anyways. 
---
Can you make cleaning finds at the Varrock museum a little easier? Currently you can’t quick pass the gate and having to use the finds on the table can be frustrating, making the grind take way longer than necessary. 
---
A quick pass and left click clean finds at the table would be two very good steps to improving it!
---
I guess its easier to bitch nowdays on here rather than google something in 2 seconds. 
---
Elite clues are different because they use a newer and 'better' system. Easy-hards were done pre-osrs while elites were done in like 2014. If anything, they would change easy-hards to be like elites and not the other way around
---
Great job! I'm just 97 levels behind you.
---
I fail to see the irony in your statement, and the humor for that matter.
---
If you have bank pin + auth you should probably assume you've been RAT'd.
---
I would try to recover the account from another location on another machine.
---
You should also do a full wipe of your current pc and a fresh operating system install. There's no great way to tell how compromised you are so it's best to start from a blank slate.
---
Immediately after installing the OS and getting all of the updates for the OS, download and update anti-virus and anti-spyware programs. You could even go farther and use a 3rd party firewall software. I believe Jagex has some recommendations on the subject.
---
You can also review your email account. It should allow you to see the IP addresses of anyone entering your account in the past X days.
---
Best of luck.
---
Great suggestions! The leprechaun comment made me hope they'll make leprechauns left click for tools (mostly for mobile).
---
RFD is as much about general account progression as it is getting the gloves themselves.
---
I.e, like the firecape, people often care more about the achievement and status symbol then actually having +1 more to their strength bonus.
---
Plus, there's literally not a single thing a person with a combat bracelet could do to flex on you.
---
Full 3rd age with a tbow talking shit to you at the ge but no b gloves?

I probably wouldn't play rs anymore if I wasn't an ironman. Imo it's much more fun to do something in game to unlock content than to do something for gp.
---
Buuuuut, I probably wouldn't feel that way if I didn't get hacked like an idiot. 
---
Realized I made too much sense and tell me to shut up? Wow. Really clever. Can't even handle a simple comment on a simple post on reddit.

Is he able to login with the active authenticator?

If yes, there's probably no way he was actually hacked. More likely he shared the account and his friend cleaned him out.

From what I've gathered it's an engine issue plus the jmod working on it left.

Great idea, I love the whole theme of PC. What would you think of Elite Void recolors as a reward as well? Right now we only have white, but I remember there was black and grey colors available as well.

It seems to be a thing for English people to keep saying "but" as a filler word in sentences similar to "um/uh".

Technical:
---
1. GPU acceleration. Playing at 20 FPS average at 4K on a RX 580 and 2 Opteron 4386's (good GPU, great multi-threading capabilities, bad single-threaded) is relatively terrible on the official client, but framerate goes at a smooth 40-50 FPS when using RuneLite's GPU plugin.
---
2. UI scaling, that isn't tied to the game texture resolution. With the **sun.java2d.uiScale** flag, the UI will happily scale when the value of that is increased, but the textures of everything else in-game decrease as well.
---
Interface:
---
1. Option to hide completed Quests from the quest list (similar to spellbook filter)
---
2. Option to hide locked Music from the music list (similar to spellbook filter)
---
Game:
---
1. The lock on the door for the Chaos Druid Tower. Right now, you just spam the Pick Lock option until you get in. I don't imagine someone is going to go to that tower with the required Thieving level, fail a few times, and then walk away. They're going to stay there, pick the lock however many times it takes, and get in. Why not just have the pick lock option succeed 100% first try if you already meet the thieving level?
---
2. For Pest Control, perhaps give a slight bump to activity (1-5%) for closing the gate. Maybe this may encourage people to close them.
---
There's really no argument to be made here.
---
Unless you lack the mental capacity to mimic another person doing something, there's no way reading a guide could be quicker.
---
If you really really wanted to give it maximum effort and read ahead and memorize steps so you never need to pause and only look back at the guide during periods of dead time, you might be able to come close in terms of time. But all that effort just to come close isn't worth it.

I don’t really see a problem with void melee becoming the highest DPS. You basically have no defense and you have to get right next to an enemy to hit them. This game has been rangescape for years now.

Anyone with 40 defence 70 range can buy black dhide top n bottom with ridiculous magic def bonus. Im proposing to reduce the stats of dhide because its too close to karils at 70def.

With the addition of the seed vault, is it possible to make a similar vault for clue gear, for sets that you haven't finished to put in the chest in your PoH. As in the chest in the PoH would take alot of dev work to fix, this would be a nice work around. Places to put this would be at watson fx.

don't compare a shittier version of crafting to summoning lol

I'll never understand how we went from a community with 2 games to a bunch of cry babies who cant accept there are 2 versions of runescape.  If you love old school but get bored after a while theres an entirely different runescape you could play! Same skill structure and everything.

I don’t know how much this will help but this happened to someone I killed a while ago at chaos alter. I had been attacking him for about a minute and he auto attacked me and skulled on me for apparently no reason. I didn’t really question or argue because I got 15m loot. But I can confirm it has happened to someone else
---
What I heard was that they were the reason mtx was pushed so much in rs3
---
Didn't know about the telegrab part, thanks fam
---
As much as I would have liked this before I got my void, Jagex probably won't like it.
---
Just click CC only?
---
Do I throw the dagger at Zuk?
---
why not just buff karils instead? I really doubt a black d hide nerf would pass just because some pkers are angry they can't catch every tb/barrage in +60 mage accuracy salad robes and a water staff.
---
You know what else people whine about? Losing their Ironman with 5000 hours of progress on it. I’m sorry but no one who specifically selects “7 day authenticator removal delay” is going to complain if they can’t access their account for a week. They’re gonna go “damn, I can’t play for a week this sucks, but at least I don’t have to quit the game forever because my 2b bank is gone”

Can instancing for the GWD bosses be taken in to consideration? I wouldn't call world hopping to being locked out a viable game mechanic.

High profile targets are also anyone with a significant bank. So what you’re saying is we should make sure our accounts and banks stay low value so we aren’t on the radar. I’m sorry but this is just trying to blame the victims. 
---
Yes, there are some people who get hacked by clicking a phishing link, have no auth delay, use the same password for email and rs, all that dumb stuff. There are also people who use EVERY available security measure offered on their email and rs and still get hacked. This isn’t an issue on any other game I’ve ever played, out of hundreds. Jagex needs to figure it out.
---
Would be cool.
---
I think we found serene's alt
---
Hundreds of millions of unaffected accounts but yeah sure Jagex is the one with the vulnerability.

For real, full verac's was the first big investment I saved up for and of course 11 year old me fell for this trick.

Im about to sleep since its 4am here but could you explain how please? I'll read it when i wake up.
---
MM is not as bad as people say, so do that as soon as you can. Look up slayermusiq1's guide if you want to make it as easy as possible. For melee slayer, you want black mask/slayer helm ASAP, prioritize that over dragon boots (rune are fine). Unrelated note, fill your bank with teleport jewelry. Glory, ring of wealth, skills necklace, combat bracelet, games necklace, and ring of dueling are a good start. Also get a bunch of law and elemental runes.
---
De Nardah. 
---
This is a serious longshot, but I'd like to get my REALLY old account back. Problem is I can't remember much about it besides the password and something that has to be very close to the username. Do I have any chances?

I moved the portals around like you suggested, that's a good call.

Right, I just think that in addition to that timing (or instead) they should automatically trigger when the hydra changes phases

Not too off there, I guess.

It’s regarding the poll from Jan 25.
---
Gud fight
---
TOB could use a few QoL fixes:
---
There’s an issue on several of the bosses, especially maiden, where they will attack you after they are dead. I think it’s because their attack animation is so lengthy, but sometimes it KOs a player and it may or may not count the death. 
---
If you accidentally click too high up on the pillar(s) at bloat or P1, it can cause some weird pathing issues where it will Yeet you back where you don’t wanna go. Could that be looked at?
---
At Soteseg, the white screen every 33% is blinding, especially if it’s at night. Could this be changed to a black screen with white text? Also there are issues with the orbs rendering if you pass certain lines in the room or stand on top of another player when they spawn. It sucks getting hit by an invisible orb.
---
Getting 1ticked by a web in P2 is super frustrating. I can’t think of a balanced way to prevent it, but I’m hoping y’all have some ideas since it seems a bit lame that one web will last longer than others and just wreck you in one tick. Maybe reset the web expiration timer to a couple seconds when someone gets caught to allow their teammates to save them, or make the damage a function of the time caught.
---
Damn, that guy got all that? I know the guy you’re talking about and it’s nuts he can do all of that with simply an RSN. It just proves if the right people want you hacked it’s very likely you’ll be hacked no matter what you do.
---
Wow so cultured.

Made some changes due to feedback, see this comment. Included change to deflector.

This is too relatable 
---
Haha, alright Serene, you got us you can come back now

It feels like they're not.  You get more money from herbs, and more exp from trees.  Alloments just make farming runs more tedious, cutting them out significantly speeds up the runs.

Off topic, but really good episode of hot ones!

Not yet they’re not

I think the point is that he didn’t really complete it, he got carried. There’s no way he was useful to his team with those stats

Linear buff to EVERY dragon tool - why? Dragon tools are incredible as hell.
---
More hourlies and dailies and general catering to ironmen - why?
---
Extremely cringe content. Voting no all over the line. But wont make a difference, it will pass like all polls do. It doesnt matter what value you poll stuff at you could make something 2.5% better 25% better or 40% better or 17% better it would pass at any given value, people close their eyes and vote yes.

You're cool tho

I don't care so much about reverting the look, but it should be easy to recolor the gloves to match.

What sort of general experience amounts are you thinking for zalcano? Vague estimate and/or strict upper bound is fine.
---
The gauntlet isn't doable for uim unless they risk literally everything. Could this be changed?
---
I'm also annoyed by this, but I'm hesitant to implement any more changes that make this boss even easier. Currently with a tbow you very regularly skip entire phases (lightning, fire) entirely. Currently the only thing you really have to pay attention to is the "Raaaaargh" text and counting to 3.

How would this change negatively affect non-mobile users?

Nice, feels good, I got 2 by kill 80 after mm2. I expect a long dry spell now.

Lower ranged attack, add ranged strength for example. Or add defence but lower attack bonus.

The tanglefoot does require the secateurs, they're provided for you.

oh man, not another herb patch that provides an expected profit of anywhere from 2.1k to 9.8k gp, this is literally game breaking and i'll have to go back to profit dragon / revs for no effort GP/hr 😡

I'm not sure if it is true, but people say that every snowflake is unique in symmetry and therefore one of a kind. Just like these special ironmen accounts are. Combine that with the usual condescending meaning of snowflake and yeah, that's why people say it.

---
Yes and no. Like any music profession, playing the part helps immensely. Keep in mind that artists are in the entertaining business. 
---
Lol his comments were shit 90% of the time
---
What was your grade 
---
&gt;if I do hop to store some things I’d gain nothing from fighting a pker 
---
Gee wiz you and literally every single other pvming account. That’s the whole entire fucking point. The risk is you would come in contact with a pker that you have no means of fighting against. The reward would be 28 extra inventory slots you could put shit into but not take out. If that reward is not worth the risk in your eyes, simply don’t hop to a pvp world?
---
 Oh and btw you silly btw, do you know what you gain from killing a pker? Your fucking stuff you dolt. He can’t kill ya if he’s dead now can he? Do you really think the retards picking on pvmers are good pkers? Rag range their ass back and Ull be surprised to see how many of them can’t deal with targets that dps back. You don’t need a gp gain to justify an action, a mitigation of gp loss works just as well......... 
---
Game integrity is indeed completely destroyed. In order to boss/skill at maximum efficiency in this game, you need basically 2 accounts with thousands of hours in them. The average player doesn’t even have one account with thousands of hours invested, therefore he can never pvm efficiently. Setting the bar unreasonably high for the average player ruins game integrity just as badly as lowering the bar.
---
24 hr boss trips refers to the alts ability to be a mobile bank for you, meaning you can stay indefinitely at all bosses. That’s nothing to do with a long boss trip. That means they can literally boss for infinity as long as they want to boss. That is a problem. Not having to bank loot or get kc or resupply is a problem.
---
It just means you’ll be in pvp worlds more, which means you should probably learn a vital part of this game just as you learned to skill and pvm... 
---
This was the like the gateway drug of scamming
---
I don't think they're using it in the context you are used to hearing it come from. 
---
I think this is coming from a place of literalness. Not a place of name calling.
---
How do you figure that? The chance to get dagger on one specific kill and whip on another specific kill is 1/16,777,216. OP’s picture will be more common though, since the notable part isn’t that he got a dagger on kill 500 and whatever, and a whip exactly 2 kills later, it’s notable because he got both drops near each other.

Will it be possible to use a smoldering stone on the crystal axe to get the log burning effect that the infernal axe has?

Ok, thanks!

Don't be! It sucks to get scammed, sure, but it is also a valuable experience, especially if you scammed a kid. It teaches 'em something about the game, and gives them a valuable lesson on trusting goodwill of others. I don't know how many millions I lost to scams as a kid, tbh.
---
No.... Not really. Have you done it?

You might be right, that could be faster than my method. I just personally don’t like having to constantly click over on the video. From my experience (I’ve only ever used slayermusiq two or three times) I felt like I was constantly skipping or having to pause like for instance if he had a TP I didn’t have. Just personal preference, I guess.

The Crystalline Hunllef proposed in The Gauntlet will likely look like a crystal form of this: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cehd0aSWwAEkq70.jpg 
---
People don't seem to get the joke
---
Bank presets for different outfits or loadouts please!
---
crystal armor is pointless with the proposed stats/set effect, stats are geared towards melee and the only melee crystal weapon is a hally (switchscape?).
---
for range its just a worse version of void since it forces you to use the crystal bow which is inferior to many other ranged weapons.
---
mage does not have any crystal weapon anyway.
---
I got first one at 1600
---
I remember when you were called a teletubby for teleporting away from a fight.
---
Wasn’t there a point in like 2013 or something where people literally got banned for it?
---
Drop them 
---
&gt;Did you ever stop and think that you could click the map then 1tick click attack the boss to stop yourself from getting too close to the tentacles on the sides?
---
Did you ever stop and think of literally any reason why you should have to do that?
---
&gt;Why must sire change to be catered to you, when since it’s release and the shadow barrage changes it’s only gotten easier with tbow and scythe ingame?
---
Why can it *not* be changed in a way that doesn't affect actual difficult? 
---
&gt;There is nothing difficult about map walking or right clicking
---
Right clicking takes longer on mobile, user can't prevent that without hampering themselves. Map walking to an exact tile on mobile, not exactly precise without a stylus. 
---
Cool, could you also add a poll to add a second set of stick traps that directly follows exsisting stick traps in priff?
---
That way when we actually pass the first stick trap we have to roll again on another one? 
---
Pros: helps reduce HCIM population
---
The way I see it is Runescape 3s direction was seen to be in the wrong direction and old school allowed to turn back time and take another direction, which it largely is succeeding in. I wouldn't really support a game that wants to be literally stuck in a certain era of the game with 0 updates.
---
Add defense and lower attack bonus and it’ll be dead content too. It’s all about the dps 
---
I assumed they were both daggers for some reason haha my mistake. Did (1/32k)*(1/32k), would be better odds than my number for sure. 
---
I highly doubt the forced name change is automatic. What was your name?
---
Easy argument: I don't want my herb runs to be longer. You could say "Just don't use the new patch", but then I will make less money from my herb runs than I do now, as people using the extra patch will drive down profit margins.
---
What was your setup?
---
It's not copied, they're taking parts that worked and leaving out parts that didn't, like they've done with all of their updates that borrow from rs3 ideas 
---
I understand your sentiment, but I honestly think it has more to do with the type of account he is fighting against when he is like that.  If it is 300k off of a 1def pure that was lvl 50-60, that is surprising, especially if he didn’t notice any items of exceptional worth during and prior to the fight. At other times if he gets bigger loots while fighting a zerker for instance that is risking a fury, he gets excited but is not surprised because he is aware of the circumstance and potential outcome of the fight.  He pks a TON, which I imagine (i don’t pk so I don’t quite know) means he gets a lot of garbage loot under 100k when pking pures, so when he does happen to get decent loot from one it would be reasonably surprising.  Maybe there is a point where my logic is skewed, but i feel that the ratio of good loot to bad is pretty stacked towards the bad loot end. 
---
That's great! definitely a big improvement on rewards from the first post! can almost get behind this if it wasn't for the part that allows you to switch out of piece of void. Idk, I guess its more so a personal thing rather than a "flaw", but it just doesn't seem right to me haha. Maybe instead of that if it was like, only the glove slot, I would support it. I guess its just void has become such a staple in gear, it would just be too weird for me to see void range but a karil top instead, like in the pic. Great work regardless of what I think though, its ideas like this that are manifested into a visual project that help keep the game alive and help it grow. I appreciate you. 
---
I totally agree. Please make it a true challenge. This is the quest line that brought us underground pass and MEP2. This storyline-ending quest needs to represent that
---
Wow, I did not know dragons could yield that much money - do you have a certain setup and strategy? I have 88+ everything but prayer. 
---
It looks dope, I want my dungeoneering fix.
---
A skilling only boss is also really interesting.
---
They literally don't even need to poll any of these. They will all pass with flying colors except for maybe the herb patch. 
---
Almost inevitable with the refugees coming to our game 
---
He's most likely using his alts now, they usually have a partyhat flair, usually blue. They're easily identifiable because of the very noticeable ego and cringe. Aside from that, he will always have thousands upon thousands of *positive* comment karma points on all of his accs because he spits across all possible imaginable subreddits 24/7 and goes outside just to desperately crave to go back inside.
---
Thanks, you too!
---
So his computer is compromised. They were able to take his token from a recent login and apply it for their purposes.
---
Does he use any third party clients?
---
I made a similar request in a Q&amp;A to use James Bond outside GE to let ironmen buy bonds. Since James Bond gives info about bonds already.
---
Mod Kieren basically replied, that they'd just give ironmen the ability to use GE to only buy bonds, not sell and not able to buy or sell anything else.
---
That was about a year ago, so I'm still waiting. The fact theres now a tax on top of giving bonds makes being an ironman worse. Since we already have to pay for our main to be mems, just so our mains can give us bonds

hey buddy, I was the same way! took me a whole day to finally learn zulrah, and by "learn" I mean just to get one kill without dying or tele-ing out. Once I finally got a kill, it boosted my confidence a ton and I managed to get a low kc to where I could say I 'did some zulrah'.
---
Keep trying! you'll get it soon, there are some really really good guides out there. 
---
Thanks for the feedback, a lot of people suggested making the deflector just give a defensive bonus instead of acting like any of the other pieces, I could go either way personally. 
---
Don't think you should need to use the Dragon Equipment to make the crystal items. Seems a bit pointless.

---
My dad owns that bank. That's how I get back there. Don't be hating virgin pleb. 😤
---
Farming is actually a full time thing now. There's a lot of herb patches, good or bad.
---
They should just add some random hops or bush patches to new landmasses to make the world feel a bit more natural imo
---
Doesn't take away from the fact the grind is awful.
---
Balance isn't the problem. The problem is being forced to add yet another patch to our herb runs or else be punished by a reduction in our profits compared to what we have now (since more patches means the profit margin on seeds will go down).
---
main thing I liked about dungeoneering was the team work aspect of it. Hope they make the gauntlet for 1 to 5 man.
---
This but also say you tap it and then tap the game, it will insta-right click without long pressing anything.

U used to get kicked for making those jokes back in 2012 ish when runescape were super hot on muting people for dumb shit lol

"We won’t be polling the addition of every shop and resource - they’ll be covered by the main poll question"

Ok, can we at least know what else is going to be in the city then?
---
Spelled white wrong.
---
Nice :DD simple but funny
---
This existed in 2013, where were you? Not around apparently because the game almost died in that state. 
---
My opinion for the elf quest:
---
1. I would like a Grand exchange, It would be an area away from scammer bots,dicers and beggers.  Doesn't make sense for such a big continent to have 1 trade market.
---
2. A new agility course (95), when I think elves I think agility.
---
3. Quest completion for all crystal equipment.
---
4. Spirit Tree
---
5. More skilling alternatives with agility included, example (hunt/agility).
---
6. Why does everything in the game have to be level 70? give the Armour a Different level req. 
---
7. We been waiting for this city for so long,yet I can tell already there's little to no reason for it to be a social hub.
---
Sounds like having high total level will help in the Gauntlet. While that's not good news for people like me (who are not maxed out), it's better game design. Rewarding players for high levels makes leveling up useful, so they have more goals to achieve and be encouraged to play for the higher levels. 
---
I don't know if this counts as QoL in everyone's eyes, but here goes nothing: 
---
Requirements vs. Rewards: 
---
If someone chooses to limit the stats of their account, that's on them, and the consequences are that lots of content is (quite rightly) locked away behind quest requirements. Other than the option of boosting stats (in some cases), requirements are a clear cut way to define the limitations of a particular build or style of play. 
---
Why then, is "reward" exp mandatory at the end of some quests? A 1DEF account can never return to ape atoll, for example, because of a reward which does not relate to any requirement for Monkey Madness. 
---
A low prayer account is unable to complete a multitude of quests, purely because of the reward and not a requirement. 
---
My suggestion is that quest reward exp should be optional, with perhaps a checkbox on the "quest complete" scroll. 
---
I understand that some people may dislike this idea, but it just bothers me that many "rewards" are barriers rather than a positive thing, which a reward should fundamentally be. 
---
Dont say the truth here. Go and post Le god ash XD meme and enjoy your karma
---
Of the unofficial clients runelite is considered the safest. It's most likely his computer is compromised.
---
You should probably assume he's been RAT'd.
---
He should also do a full wipe of his current pc and a fresh operating system install. There's no great way to tell how compromised he is so it's best to start from a blank slate.
---
What?

How much are game developers going for in GE? I searched it but found nothing.

---
Update the thammarons sceptre by only using ether instead of runes (given its own spell too)
---
I just don't see how they would even avoid "copying" rs3. The elf questline started years ago, priff has been on the map way before rs3 was even a thing. People meme about RS3 not being "runescape". But in reality OSRS and RS3 are still very similar, so you literally can't avoid copying the other game when both games progress in a similar way.
---
I didn't call you a prick.  You made the assumption that I crash and wait for people to ask me to hop before I hop.  Not my fault you're both presumptuous and can't read.
---
Cool idea but people will downvote this post because it’s pvp related. 
---
Lol, literally the exact same armor in slightly different colors confuses you? 
---
The blog says its solo Pvm.
---
Except it's not as you're assuming:
---
- The engine can change the colour of sprites. It can't resize sprites so I doubt it can change the colour.
---
- The server already has some way of identifying who dealt what damage
---
- The client already has some way of identifying who dealt what damage
---
- The engine can access that information in the render path
---
Can you add an alternate way to imbue your crystal bow/shield with this update? Having to do nmz doesn’t really make sense to me
---
Ill tell him, ty for the info!
---
If Zalcano ends up being well-received I sure hope other skilling bosses get added to the game eventually. It'd be great for skilling bosses to feel like actual bosses since Wintertodt feels like a semi-afk minigame.
---
Here’s one I’ve had for a long while.
---
In the ancient spell books the teleports are named, but they are named very old and strange names for the locations. I don’t want a change, but maybe a more modern description in parentheses? Or maybe in the description when you hover over the teleport? Gets annoying having to wiki which teleports are which. 
---
I brought that pair after I started to afk for a while and died because I was just hitting 0's for 10mins I was just showing an example. I didnt get a pair in my inventory?
---
This quest would be a great opportunity to take out NMZ's crystal stat degradation perk and putting it somewhere meaningful. A rare reward from the gauntlet could for example be a specific kind of crystal you can use on crystal weaponry/shield to prevent them from losing their stats when they degrade. 
---
Or maybe have it simply be the quest's reward: A unique singing bowl only found inside prifdinnas that turns crystal weapon/shield seeds into a seed that won't lose its stats upon degrading. It just seems like such an arbitrary mechanic that doesn't really do anything and this would be the perfect opportunity to get rid of it.
---
Personally I was also hoping this content update would bring something that makes the crystal bow worth using. It's such a cool bow that's unfortunately not worth using anywhere since msbi + rune arrows is *far* better DPS. Even rcbow + broad bolts I think is better than the crystal bow, or at least on par AND it's cheaper to use. I don't think the crystal armor will be enough to make it worth using, even less so considering it degrades and doesn't have any ranged accuracy bonus. The +15% accuracy increase doesn't sound like it'd be more than your standard black dhide set up and the +5% dmg increase I think adds maybe 1 or 2 max hit to the bow. Compared to the slayer helmet or void the DPS aspect of the armor is pretty horrible tbh.
---
every time you steal on osrs you have a chance of obtainig a pet that will follow you the pet is racoon the longer you train thievibg the more likely you gonna obtain the pet

Nice of you to vote no for the quest which doesn't give any benefits itself. Seems like some people close their eyes and vote "no all over the line." Fuck all new content, am I right?

Would a new crystal tree patch be a good way for farming crystal shards?
---
So ive been f2p for a few weeks now just came back to rs from being an old player but i didnt really get really really far in those days. I have enough for 2 bonds really so i have the chance to do some exploring before i make money and carry on grinding. But my question is, once i do that, what should i do with my stats to get myself a bond using a skilling method? A lot of people say slayer. Some say fletching, herbs, barrows... would like to know your opinions. I seen a good guide saying steel bar blasting i think makes 500k ph but what do you guys think is best for me ?

---
Basic setup is your best ranged defense e.g bandos/barrows. Zammy hasta or good stab weapon, insulated boots (lowers damage from their special attack), dragon fire shield or anti dragon shield. Neitiznot helm and torture and berserker etc
---
You want super combat pot, extended anti fire, 4-5 prayer pots and set quick prayer to mage and piety
---
Increase the size of the fairy ring click box 
---
They complain if you attack them in PVP worlds. Fuck them. If you want that extra reward of a bank chest nearby, then you take that risk. No different to the wildy.

Is it an idea to not gate everything behind 1 grandmaster quest but behind a grandmaster quest AND other new quests?

e.g. seperate Zalcano into a different quest and add that later?

I understand that an overall rework of sound settings requires engine work, but can we at least have a high range of choices for how loud/quiet something is? 
---
Then just don't do herb runs at all? No one is forcing you to do them lol

The server/client doesn't need to identify who dealt what damage, all it needs to know which damage is from the user. Which it also already does, look at xp drops, being visible short moments before the hitsplat actually appearing

I don't get why the minigame is dangerous? since you can't teleport out you're just expected to die if you mess up?
---
Some low IQ spade hunters think they can change stuff that affects them in a good way.
---
I think the crystal pickaxe/axe/harpoon would be more useful if the Dragon item was removed from the game too. So after all the charges are used you get a depleted crystal item instead of the Dragon item that needs a crystal seed added to be used again 
---
the set effect is a little underwhelming for crystal armor, what good is the boost when there’s hardly any crystal weapons in the game. it’s good for the bow at least. but would be nice if they introduced a new melee weapon, or even a crystal staff. there’s no negative attack bonus on the armor so mage could work too
---
salve + nosepeg isn't just "good enough", it's BiS. Pissed me off when the guy in blue d'hide bone crossbow safespotting bloodvelds called me failed for spending slayer points on blocks before slayer helm.
---
judging from how wintertodt and volcanic mine turned out, i assume group skilling content is harder to make.

The Quest
---
“You think you’re the hero of this story, but you’re not…” - Lord Iorwerth 
---
Big things have small beginnings. Sixteen years ago, the Plague City quest was added to RuneScape. This quest marked the beginning of the fabled elf quest series, the oldest and longest quest series in the game. From elven rebellions to Dark Lords, the series has told a thrilling story with many twists and turns. Now, after all of these years, it’s finally time for this story to come to its conclusion with Old School RuneScape’s newest Grandmaster quest, Song of the Elves! 
---
Song of the Elves will see you team up with a range of characters from across the series to finally put an end to the schemes of Lord Iorwerth and King Lathas. Do not expect this to be easy - you will face challenging puzzles and deadly foes as you fight to bring peace to the elven lands. 
---
That’s all we’re going to say about Song of the Elves for now, as we don’t want to ruin the surprises of the quest. However, you can be sure that it will be an epic adventure unlike any other. 
---
Poll Question #1
---
Should the Song of the Elves quest be added to Old School RuneScape?
---
For years, the empty city of Prifddinas has sat untouched on the Old School RuneScape map. With Song of the Elves, the gates of this legendary crystal city will finally open to those who succeed in bringing an end to the tyranny of Lord Iorwerth and King Lathas. 
---
Prifddinas will contain a range of shops, resources and other amenities. It will also feature some brand-new content, offering some exciting rewards. Check out the map above to see what Prifddinas has to offer. 
---
We won’t be polling the addition of every shop and resource - they’ll be covered by the main poll question. However, the more useful pieces of content have their own separate questions which can be found below. 
---
Poll Question #2
---
If Song of the Elves is added to the game, should completion of the quest grant access to the elven capital of Prifddinas?
---
Poll Question #3
---
If Prifddinas is added to the game, should it include a new Player-owned house location? Moving a house here would require completion of Song of the Elves, 70 Construction and 50,000 coins.
---
Poll Question #4
---
If Prifddinas is added to the game, should it include some Teak and Mahogany trees? There would be three Teak trees and two Mahogany trees.
---
Poll Question #5
---
If Prifddinas is added to the game, should it include a new Sawmill? This Sawmill would be further away from a bank than the one in the Woodcutting Guild. However, if the above question passes, it would be the closest Sawmill to Teak and Mahogany trees.
---
Yeah lol rune to iron was super common and easy to do, I'm pretty sure the mutes on my account were from that.
---
That is what i'm saying. 99% of the questions they poll aren't controversial in any way. So i don't see why people expect the voting behavior to change by hiding poll results.
---
50/50
---
Made some changes due to feedback, including the deflector. See this comment. 
---
Sounds great. Nice to get more details on how The Gauntlet and the Mining Boss work. The Gauntlet does seem like it will strike enough of the Dungeoneering vibe even if the end boss is tough. The Mining Boss also sounds great; I really hope this finally lives up to a proper skilling boss.
---
One thing that could use clarification is "Each piece of Crystal Armour will degrade back into a Crystal armour seed after 2,500 hits are taken." Does this mean the Chestplate, which takes 3 seeds, will degrade into 1 seed or 3? Aside from that, I do agree that another Herb Patch is a bit much since we've gotten 2 new Herb Patches in the past 6 months already. I'd much rather see another Flower or Bush Patch (or both) instead.
---
Also, while there is a second blog to cover more of the stuff in Prif, it was a bit disappointing to see new crystal gear like Armor and Tools but nothing about upgrades or changes to the current Crystal Items. The Armor may work with the Bow, but it seems worse than using Void and it does nothing to fix the cost issue; 72gp per shot is not cheap compared to other Ranged Weapons that only use ammo 20% of the time thanks to Ava's. I still like the idea of a Crystal Blessing or other item that halves the chance of Crystal Equipment losing a charge; this could apply to Armor and Weapons but not the Tools.
---
It starts becoming overwhelming. 
---
You never know it could be expanded on in the future.
---
I skip irons, but I do steels Because it's a 5 minute task. They aren't worth blocking because of their weighting
---
Same. I’d personally prefer to do this with a few mates as opposed to soloing.

It won't let you shoot one or one won't appear? I know a few people had issues with a chompy bird appearing so just lay more frogs down but nothing I've heard of not being able to shoot one that's there already sorry.

No more herb patches please.
---
If it makes you feel better I'm down voting your replies too because you're a fucking moron lmao.
---
I did Superiors &gt; Blocks &gt; Slayer Helm and will probably unlock Herb Sack, Garg Smasher, and then from there it's either extensions or unlocking tasks.

Pretty sure torture+Slayer helm is better, but idk. I can put it in the do calc when I get home.
---
I've heard some people suggest that it really forces them to focus on their rap career since they are unemployable elsewhere.

This represents Fukong's failings, not Jagex. Jagex is doing well enough and currently at a peak, with Fukong struggling financially they'd be stupid not to sell Jagex right now. 
---
It could be. Or it could just be wintertodt 2.
---
Not generalizing anything, the 'NPCs' thing is used pretty exclusively by the right, and ascribing value judgements to actual defined belief systems isn't generalizing. Right wing beliefs are inherently 'soulless' as far as i'm concerned.
---
What's immature is an inability to confront or denounce ideas just because people hold them, that's such a childish and unhelpful way to view the world. 
---
Infected?
---
As someone who has only played a few games of Wintertodt, am I actually not supposed to fletch? Whenever I played on the Wintertodt world the games ended so quickly that I was just barely getting to 500 points before it ended while fletching. I feel like I wouldn't get enough points to get a reward if I didn't fletch.
---
A better amulet provides more bonus than ~4% atk/str bonus. So I wouldn't say salve with nosepeg is the best combination here.
---
Wtf is crystal armour

Why couldn't they just make a required 2 day delay on authenticator removal? It just doesn't make any sense to me.
---
77.7 % of the time you’ll end up pressing the banker if your zoomed out, a massive portion of the player have these options switched with clients so no advantages are created. 
---
Can the "all-but-1" bank option be removed? It seems pointless with placeholders now in game.
---
Try do like 10 barrows runs per day and quest as much as possible
---
I agree with you! RSHD was beautiful. 
---
It shouldn't give any prayer bonus imo. Possibly a bit lower melee defense also. 
---
Smithing isnt a hated skill.
---
Don't blame him he's from UK
---
Well sure, but then just don't do it herbs at all or just don't do all of them. It's a game, you shouldn't do things that overwhelm you. You're already doing content that isn't exactly efficient so the only reason you're doing them is for some small amount of cash and because you enjoy it on some level. If it gets to the point where you don't enjoy it then ease back on it or skip it altogether.
---
Yessss! 
---
Looks like they have given up on warding, good.
---
Thanks i appreciate your advice sir
---
There's no need for another herb patch, massively powerful tools and a 300k xp/hr method for training mining/smithing/rc.
---
This entire update is easyscape.
---
Budget justicar
---
This is a great idea. They should really implement new bosses similar to raids bosses for newer players that want to get into doing raids but cant get a group.
---
If they were going to rebalance anything, I'd rather them nerf lavas (only by raising the required level to craft them) instead of buffing other methods.
---
I believe lavas are actually balanced since they are one of the most click and attention intensive methods in the game for them to get the best xp rates, all while losing money.
---
ZMI, Bloods, Souls dont require even half as much attention and profit while getting a fair bit less xp/hr. If that's not balanced IDK what is. It seems in line with the primary design philosophy in other skills.
---
&gt; I would like a Grand exchange, It would be an area away from scammer bots,dicers and beggers. Doesn't make sense for such a big continent to have 1 trade market.

oh my god, it made me more and more uncomfortable the longer I waited for it
---
amazing suggestion
---
Crystal equipment can't burn the granite, fish, or logs like infernal can. More stuff to drop means more chance to mess up ticks. Crystal will also consume shards so it's likely costlier than infernal.
---
That being said, yes XP rates will increase for the tick-perfect. But there is a trade-off.
---
I haven't finished reading the blog yet, but there's something I wan to say, seeing as this is a Grandmaster quest.
---
PLEASE do not needlessly kill an iconic NPC during the course of the quest, like in DS2 and MM2. If the death makes sense, that's fine. However, I would rather not see a Bob style death again.
---
Same! Took all of 15 minutes. Now I'm gonna go dry for the next year.
---
A lot of stuff is going to happen, but what you just suggested is not one of them.
---
I lost my first mil this way :/ cammy bank circa 05/6'

It has not been released or polled yet but is a new armour being proposed. You may want to see this blog: [http://services.runescape.com/m=news/song-of-the-elves-poll-blog-i?oldschool=1](http://services.runescape.com/m=news/song-of-the-elves-poll-blog-i?oldschool=1)
---
noted torag legs and noted iron platelegs 
---
animation smoothing plugin on runelite
---
Will the gauntlet allow for some sort of storage of items while in the mini game? Or will UIM not be able to participate?
---
Thanks pal will explore all of this eventually
---
Could we poll making the Rum from Trouble Brewing tradeable? It has an awesome [death animation teleport](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/File:Trouble_Brewing_Rum.gif) which needs to be more popular. It can be given the same requirements as Trouble Brewing to use similar to some clue scroll teleports.
---
eh, lots of new content being pushed out. Havent even gotten to the old stuff yet 
---
Says game balance
---
That does suck
---
Can you post the original?
---
Can someone please tell me why hiding poll results is so important? In what way does seeing the current result change somebodys voting intentions?
---
Let’s hear your side of the argument lol. It’s hard to take you people (on this sub) serious because I can sadly picture what you guys look like, but I’m going to hear you out. Give it a go sport 
---
&gt; In general I can't see where the crystal armor will be useful. All I can think of is at bandos and maybe DKS
---
It's overpowered in Inferno because it has no negative bonuses. In general I just don't think it's good design to not penalize rangers and magers wearing tank armour because if you deal more DPS, have more utility, have range, and have the tanky stats of melee armour, what's the point of using melee in PvP anymore apart from specs. I wouldn't mind the set giving like -50 to both but give it something like 100% accuracy bonus to Crystal Bow.
---
Whether it's only controversial to a small community or a big community, do you not think that the poll should be hidden to prevent bias?
---
Cuz you can just secure your fuckin email and it completely eliminates this problem. 
---
Gambit told us a few months ago that like 75% of accounts don't have bank pins. The problem isn't, and has never been, that security is inadequate. The problem is that players simply refuse to use the options available to them. It's user error the whole way down, unless you were one of the absurdly unlucky people to get hacked by jed (which is an anomaly which is unlikely to happen again and also 100% indefensible no matter what anyway). 
---
Isn’t the gauntlet supposed to be a top level pvm challenge why is it giving crap uniques
---
I'm just gonna copy and paste this post I made, just replace hammer with your thing
---
&gt;What everyone thinks it would be:
---
(hammer==1);
---
What it would actually be:
---
Finding every line of code in the game that checks if you have a hammer and manually adding this item
---
I can do barrows on mobile ? Is it ok ? As i can do barrow runs in work while i have free time there and then quests when home on pc. 
---
&gt;People who have finished a grandmaster quest don't do herb runs.
---
Lol wat? 
---
They should have made the Gauntlet an OSRS version of Stealing Creation...
---
Just death bank before attempting it.
---
bro missed opportunity, shudve said iron man btw
---
he did miss the chance to say that i know
---
Please make a way for skillers as well as 1 def pure skillers have access to the area and the boss. Don't hide good and fun skilling content behind combat requirements..
---
Zal couldn't convince the elves to help and now he's stuck underneath Prifindas, making him tonight's big loser!
---

---
Took about 30 when I timed it, I thought it would be at least an hour
---
Terrible youtuber...
---
I'm thinking about it when mobile releases but I also don't want to play in an empty world. And the RS3 world is just so devoid of players. 
---
Pest control is, in my opinion, the best minigame this game has with a close second being barbarian assault. I would LOVE to see a rework like this to both of them.
---
&gt; since more patches means the profit margin on seeds will go down
---
Can you explain that? That claim isn't very intuitive to me.
---
It's not factually incorrect. Like I said, the quest itself doesn't give any of the rewards below if they don't pass. Of course the quest will give quest points &amp; xp rewards but rest of the rewards are up for the players.    
---
&gt; So the content this quest will unlock and can potentially unlock is huge.  
---
Please tell me what this quest will unlock, you know, except for the polls 2 though 11 which the quest can potentially unlock.
---
Great more useless level 70 armor thanks jagex...
---
This is how i feel when i see pizza capes -Lasagna cape btw
---
First thing is basic group conformity, showing votes leaning a certain way influences other votes coming in. Secondly, many people just chose not to vote anymore because they see everything at 80-90% and feel there time will be wasted and there vote means nothing. There is no downside in hiding the votes, it simply removes potential bias. 
---
I think it's an attempt to deal with the f2p clay mining bots.
---
theyve recently posted some artwork of this (i think on twitter somewhere)
---
The Cave Horror cave says it's dark even if the cave fire is lit. Maybe fix?

---
Just accept fate and throw gold/gold ore into the blast furnace to make it quick
---
Never mind I don’t want to continue this with you lol. I read through your post history and you are exactly what I’m envisioning. You tell people to “low arch” themselves, and brag about having 350 DAYS on RS3. I fear what you look like or do for a living in real life. Good luck in the future you social mutant. 
---
If you aren't skilled you won't be able to scoop out proper lumps you'll just smush it
---
I absolutely need that agility course. Cheers.
---
i remember watching a tutorial about how to get shazyian favor and it was some other random european dude and the top comment was "diet slayermusiq"
---
made me lol
---
ty ;)
---
First, I am not saying that only efficient things matter. Efficiency can be used to justify doing certain things over others, but it's not the only thing that matters. People do things simply because they're fun - "if you're still doing them after you get your way into Prif then that's on you." I'm not saying that it's right or wrong to do it, just that it's not really worth it gp-wise for high level players.
---
If you enjoy farming herbs then do Prif, if you feel overwhelmed by the new patches then stay with your current one. Honestly I just don't care, it's your gaming experience. 
---
The profit on seeds has not gone down since the farming guild came out so I don't see why it'd go down with Prif. 
---
I mean, it makes sense to have the most commonly used option be the left click option, even on the desktop client.
---
Mate I'm not arguing with some retard about face tattoos on an autism simulator subreddit.  Just wanted you to know that you being a moron wasn't a singular opinion.
---
Alch yourself.
---
the fire cape is the pinnacle of skill
---
Annoyingly it doesn't seem like there are any smithing or runecrafting rewards. Hopefully that isn't the case.
---
&gt;Wintertodt was the warm-up skilling boss.
---
Heh.
---
pointless
---
The new armor is going to be absurdly good for inferno 
---
I'm sorry, based on that comment I don't think you get it yet. 
---
You give 1 dragon axe &amp; 1 crystal seed for 1 crystal axe. After 10k logs it turns into a depleted crystal axe (instead of the Dragon axe) then you use another crystal with it and it becomes a crystal axe again. Just a way to take the items out of the game without worrying about a big impact to the cost per use
---
This should have been discussed pre-release but this please. I have too many hops seeds and I would actually go around to using some of them if there was an accessible patch like in the Farming Guild. 
---
I think there's a lot of potential with the gauntlet
---
Here's an idea for the boss, Crystalline Hunllef:
---
Once you kill it, you can either choose to **take the loot and leave** or **kill another version, that's slightly more powerful** - (risking all the loot you have so far) this could keep scaling up to a very high difficulty if you have the abilities to do so
---
This will offer a base challenge for the average player but also a cool challenge and reward for the higher level players who have the  abilities to go further
---
cml tracking
---
When using basalt on Snowflake to note it, skip the short chat and go straight to the confirmation dialog.
---
When having the butler return with items from the bank, don't have their return trigger an interruptive dialog stating that they've returned with your items - unless, perhaps, you don't currently have enough inventory spaces to accept the full delivery in which case they would continue to inform you of this.
---
When teleporting to the Ardougne monastery, remove the single tile between the two depleted rocks and boulder on the west side as a teleport destination. To go east from there, it forces you to run several tiles further west, several tiles north, and then south/east.
---
Add a right-click Remove-all to the blast furnace coffers.
---
When banking, queue up inventory actions after triggering the bank interface and the bank fulling loading (or being aborted by moving or ESC) as bank actions rather than immediately executing them as inventory actions. This is the player's intent and is especially helpful when banking is not free, such as at ZMI, or when the item clicked is a consumable. In these cases, an inventory action aborts the bank interface mid load, and costs consumables.
---
soft clay looks like its going to be dead on release - grandmaster quest prereq, and you'd have to be able to mine/bank it as fast as you can mine the 3iron spot in mining guild for it to be even near viable
---
Biohazard 2
---
Oooooh, ok. You're totally right; my mistake. I just recently started playing again, so I'm very out of the loop.
---
to piggy back off of this. The "Ow!" from Pyramid Plunder.
---
tbh velds are easily flickable. With the bonecrusher in the catacombs, its really not that bad and they give a shit ton of exp
---
*Stanford Engineering is triggered*
---
At 99 when you sell it on the ge, it's just a nice item sink to add and know for certain it won't be used again 
---
Volcanic Mine is fine though. It's simple, but there's at least a semblance of actual teamwork where WT is mostly just a hundred people doing the same thing.
---
I was thinking this but seeing the stats, they have no offensive stats unless you plan on using a crystal bow.
---
sounds like stealin creation + jad 2.0
---
From what I understand of OSRS's spaghetti code, this sounds difficult to implement.
---
D
---
If it's the rune crafting pouch you want, just kill the low level monsters in the abyss. Take 3 items and an Inv if food if you're worried about getting pkd.
---
If you can use fairy rings you can go to the abyssal area and do it there too.
---
It won't even be worth using if you're going for EHP but by all means please continue complaining about things that aren't happening
---
👌😂
---
Just curious and not insulting anyone's taste, what is it with "new" rappers and face tattoos?
---
Check your message center on the rs site. I believe you would get notified over there too when you were asked for the survey.
---
Shit you might be right 
---
Exp divided by 4 = damage
---
Someone had said Song of the elves content is cringeworthy, I proceeded to voice my opinion by saying OSRS isn't meant to be a serious game and yet they say I shouldn't vote on polls, (which I don't) and that I  have diminished brain function.
---
Nice?
---
When you get to Duradel you might consider unblocking steel drags. He only assigns 10-20 and with trident and expeditious bracket they're a 10 minite task. Obviously only if you have other tasks you don't like doing more though.
---
I feel like the polling system has overstepped it's bounds a fair bit. I think it was always a failsafe to ensure we kept the oldschool feel, and I don't know if polling "should this be noted?", "should this PvM mechanic be removed?", "should we add an Agility shortcut here?" really fit that bill. I think it's fairly obvious that players by and large vote yes to mostly anything that makes the game easier for them, or for new content for the sake of it. 
---
Jagex needs to take the reigns a bit more, imo.
---
Can we get an auto enchant option for jewellery such as enchanting rings of recoils? This would naturally be slower than manually doing it. 
---
You'd need a D Pick to make the Crystal Pick though
---
Ok, and I can use fairy rings. Do I need any prerequisites before going there?
---
My shit wont even spec guards in falador bruh I honestly think its broken.
---
i love blast furnace personally but yea youre right
---
I don't like WT, but if WT gave RC XP I'd be there all fucking day until I wrap up my elites. 
---
What the fuck is this shit, gave me hemorrhages 
---
Thanks! I'll pray for your 1 kc drop
---
Oh yes
---
It’s still doing it wrong. Cos it says enough laws but not enough airs. If it was pulling from pouch it should say not enough laws but enough airs. If from invent then both fine? So there’s still a bug there 
---
Can we also add an additional question to pay someone within Priffindas the ability to permanently upgrade our tiny elf crystals to never run out of charges? I'd rather have that over a new herblore patch. Either way, I like a lot of this. I think the armour should also increase the shield's defensive capabilities, making it probably a viable alternative to more expensive pieces of equipment when solo or tanking. 
---
Man the Venezuelans and bots consistently screw me over and steal my d imps.
---
I remember this passing a poll yes, I took a break from the game for about 18 months and came back and it has still not been implemented so I did some research to double check it passed it poll, it literally took about 30 seconds to find the question but no answers 
---
Haha gratz dude!! Such an awesome pet!
---
Hydra boss drops a lot. I think I got like 20k blood, death and Astral from ~600 kills
---
God, you've reminded me how atrocious the balance of dungeoneering was. Gathering resources in the dungeon? Nah, fuck that. Bind shadow silk hood + promethium/primal weapon + platebody and speed run past half of the content.
---
Depends what job you have though. As much as it can suck for someone with a face tattoo, not everybody wants it shoved in their eyesight. 
---
Might be sweet tattoo for you and some others but not everybody likes it so I can understand the lower chance of being hired for jobs where you interact with (potential) customers IRL instead of the phone or mail.
---
When osrs was first released I bought a rune scim but the dude swapped it out for a noted addy scim. Spent almost my whole bank on it. When I realized what happened I legit got dizzy lmfao
---
It’s one of the preloaded runelite add ins
---
Fuck LOL I guess I didn't read the whole blog post 
---
Lmfao. You aren't wrong.
---
zendaya is meechee
---
I mean, I don’t see why I can’t complain about something I as a player don’t enjoy. Different strokes for different folks I suppose!
---
Crafting has come a long way. I don’t enjoy things that take a ton of time and don’t gain exp when it takes multiple hours to accomplish. That’s just me! If you enjoy those things then great! I don’t think it’s the end of the world and I am able to accomplish those things today, just personally would enjoy a different route if one came up. 
---
Boy do I want that deflector. 
---
Lightness and Knightly are my favorite RuneScape songs. Don't kill me :o
---
Please make all clue scroll levels work the same way with challenge scrolls. Some you talk to, get a question, and answer. Some you get a question, click the scroll, answer, hand back.  
---
This is ever so slightly annoying.
---
Alt + Print screen works on everything after Windows XP.
---
What OS are you running?
---
*Generous for about 3 days then nerfed into oblivion.*
---
Dragon defender is definitely your goal for the near future.  In the mean time, you can use an obsidian shield (Toktz-ket-xil).  It has a +5 strength bonus which will probably increase your max hit and thus speed up your melee training until you can get a dragon defender.  Costs around 200k gp atm.
---
Ill never forget getting tele blocked, 3 dbags descend on me, the one with an AGS pots up and specs me to kill me instantly the very second i teled to lava maze. Like wtf, they actually only got my bones for what was probably 1k+ in runes and the potion drink. 
---
And of course they topped it off with “gf Faggot” as i died. 
---
Wow.  All I can say is congrats, man.
---
E.A. stands for

**E**bad

Holy neck beard
---
My mom works at a bass pro and she had someone come in with a cinnamon colored raccoon one day. Apparently they're some super rare specific breed, like an irl shiny.
---
Maybe I'm alone in this, but I think it'd be sick having all the crystal tools not come from seeds and instead be a rare untradable drop from the boss. Still gotta recharge with crystal shards, but gives us a reason to grind out the boss for a sick unlock.
---
Void's been nerfed since then and it was only overpowered with Swift Gloves. 
---
I mean to be fair only bad people used hood lol. The nature of having an entirely separate world with a different item pool is that they could make broken monsters and broken weapons/armor to match them. All things considered the balance was good, just *everything* was stronger than overworld. 
---
Speed running past the majority of content is the best way to do virtually everything in every game. That's not a fault of dung and was even arguably half the fun. 
---
Shouldve made warding like invention and it'd be the biggest money sink 
---
sounds like a cml problem, not a jagex problem.
---
The longer it gets the more power I gain.
---
I can remember what got sold where lol
---
That thing that looked like a book strapped to your wrist? Pass.
---
Good luck dude. Think on the bright side though, at least doing dry for the pet on this boss isn’t that bad. I’ll probably quit if I go this dry on the grotesque guardians lol
---
*Proceeds to die*
---
You are talking about 2 different things in the same sentence. Do you want the bounty hunter pouch or the essence pouch?!
---
If it was 146 why did you only kill 144
---
stop with the god damn herb patches holy fuck
---
You disrespected the uploader's wishes not to upload it to Reddit &gt;:(
---
Cause hydras shits em out
---
Obor is a solo boss
---
oh
---
The reason why it does apply is that in politics we vote for people who implement ideas they campaigned on while in office. The vote just moves a little farther down the line, instead of voting for the people who implement the ideas, we vote on the ideas themselves. In an analogy, if Jagex is the Executive Branch, the player base is Congress, we veto the bills that are suggested. 
---
when youre getting ready to go out and be offended
---
good to know, thanks
---
Butter pats are in the rfd chest
---
Konar is more profitable and best points but not good if you want to cannon and barrage/burst every task due to being assigned specific areas.
---
Duradel gives more points than nieve and I think is slightly better experience at max efficiency? Nieve is easiest to get to if you don't have the shortcuts to Konar or quick access to silo (or don't have no contact)
---
If you dont plan to cannon or burst, go Konar.
---
Ooohhhhh muh daze!
---
Right, but when you are granted access to a place of importance, you should be able to walk right down the middle. It seems awkward trying to just shimmy around a giant snake, as opposed to the snake just lifting its tail (which blocks the path just fine), and letting you through.
---
FENDI on deck 
---
MFW I got 99 dung all before eoc but apparently it's tied to eoc... :o
---
The click area on the iceberg for that master clue step is too small
---
My point was the game itself doesn't actually explain very well nothing to do with the inability to Google.    
---
When information isn't readily present people often don't seek it out. 
---
If everyone took this mindset of thinking their vote doesn't matter almost no one would vote after barely any total votes. 
---
I can’t wait to start shitting on other people for not having an obby cape.
---
Better yet remove all grape drops in game and replace with seeds 
---
How so
---
You can try some king black dragon
---
Anything replacing Pros needs to come from that questline...
---
You don’t understand how long I watched this... Should have read the comments first
---
&gt; I've gained over 30 just from casually doing farming contracts
---
Yea im calling bullshit on that one fam.
---
u right
---
How is afking vs logging off not efficient lol
---
I've forgotten teles during clues or wildy slayer more than once haha
---
lmao
---
Yes, that is what I meant.
---
That’s why someone can’t say “it won’t be oldschool”
---
You forgot to tag this as Humor. 
---
Only if the seed is untradeable.
---
I wear an obby cape doing slayer. Just so that when that little shit with a fire cape pops in to say 'bruh u 126 cb no firecape you newb'. So that I can then swap in my infernal cape and rek him harder than ben shapiro in a gender studies class.
---
The thing is this armour seems like it will ONLY be good at inferno. If it's a general devaluing by a new cool item, that's fine, but this armour isn't good for anything else. 
---
Ironman making potatoes? Honestly not sure why else. 
---
I want one
---
I spent like 50k on bone spear lol
---
Or just add in the ability to right click with 3d touch
---
Not everything attacks with one style
---
Maybe... it could give... crystal blossoms?
---
Depends what level is higher, but I’d recommend mage 
---
max
---
It was more of the person on the left having a face similar to Kieran’s that made me make the comment 
---
Vote no if u don't want it I guess
---
Yeah my hard clue count is like 25 or something like that so thankfully the times I forgot a telly were like the bandit castle so I just walked back. 
---
Would rather finish my irl shit in 1 hour and Raid for 9 hours rather than sit at rune drags or brutals for 10 hours.
---
95 range and 84 magic
---
If he aspired to be an eyesore he'd have met his goal already
---
What do those mean?
---
The rest of us shouldn't have our content neutered just because some people decided to play with a gimped account
---
Just wait til you forget a tele at lava maze :D
---
Is there a reason why on the mage phase I still get hit and near enough did instantly even though protecting from magic
---
Apparently, the crystal tools aren't as good as hoped for since infernal tools are so good already. 
---
Infernal offers XP and convenience by burning resources at a low price - Crystal tools offer only small increased speed at potentially high cost. 
---
But there's a big opportunity here with the content and ideas in the blog. And the rewards aren't finalized yet, so maybe we'll end up with something different.
---
460 kc, 2 claws and an eye within first 300, all within 50 kills. Nothing since.
---
Well good luck complaining about armor prices with the whole “vote no to warding” brigade out and about.
---
I never had a problem with that, it's one of the few bosses people are nice about not crashing at.
---
After some investigation, I have reason to believe hes alive. He retweeted a tweet from Donald Trump 6 days ago. I feel this is his account because hes openly pro trump on his reddit account. Also he follows an Osrs Account.
---
Check out _Serene_ (@_Serene_96): https://twitter.com/_Serene_96?s=09
---
its not my internet, the servers are shit
---
Hey man, I'd just be happy to not have to constantly contact the abyss NPC to repair pouches. 
---
&gt; Additionally, any recovery system even relatively similar to the current one will always have loopholes. For a proper recovery system they need to implement something where you use physical irl objects to recover the account, such as a proof of real identification (like some other game developers already do, especially for high target players).
---
Yeah, that's the kind of thing I had in mind. I'm just surprised that the auth delay is being pushed so hard by the community when it still ends up with someone knowing all the info they need to get into your account.
---
&gt;To keep you on your toes, the layout of the Gauntlet will be random each time you enter, causing the monsters and resources to spawn in different locations.
---
Will it really be random or will a 3rd party client be able to insta check the layout for resets?
---
**Jagex**: "We continuously run out of ideas for new equipment"   
---
**Also Jagex**: "Here is everything you can possibly think of in one update!"   
---
**Jagex a few weeks later**: "Help, we ran out of ideas for the next update!"    
---
**Me**: SurprisedPikachu.jpg
---
Seriously, why do we need to get so much?    
---
Are we never going to get more elf related quests after this one or something? Because if we do, it's going to be rather difficult to come up with new rewards. Pretty much all relevant crystal items are taken already.
---
Here, let me show you what we're going to get if this update passes:
---
1. A grandmaster quest.
---
2. Access to a new and highly requested zone.
---
3. Soft Clay rocks.
---
4. The Gauntlet (Solo PvM challenge).
---
5. Three pieces of Crystal armour.
---
6. Zalcano (skilling boss).
---
7. Three pieces of Crystal skilling equipment.
---
Then I'm not even including already existing utilities like:
---
1. A new PoH location.
---
2. New Teak &amp; Mahogany trees with a new Sawmill (probably making it to be the most efficient area).
---
3. Yet another herb patch.
---
For comparison we unlock **two** crystal items with Roving Elves and **one** with the Hard Western Provinces Diary. With this new quest we're going to get **six**.  I get that it is a grandmaster quest and deserves a good reward, but this is too much in my opinion. I would suggest to drop one boss with tree crystal equipment rewards.  Not that I don't want them in the game, but it would be better long term. Save it for a future update. 
---
This reminds me of the criticism I had on the Dragon equipment for Dragon Slayer 2 and Chambers of Xeric out. They released too many at once and in one area. Plus they released so many Dragon items over the years that we've ran out of them. In comparison: prior to OSRS, we only got one every year or so.  I quietly enjoyed it when Jagex removed some from Chambers of Xeric and used it for the new Kourend Slayer creatures. Kinda proved me right. :)
---
So you think Range cape prayer bonus is better than upgraded Ava even with worse accuracy? 
---
I was thinking fury because it would help hitting with the SGS specs as well just wasn't sure how high I needed my magic bonus but now I realise you barely need any
---
Thanks for the advice 
---
I've had four steps in the past three days take me to the upper north east bridge. Fuck that area mate. 
---
This could have been a beautiful Rick Roll.
---
More like the bitter and lonely young incels on reddit. I’ll give you that though they’re probably “underachievers” because school was “too easy”. 
---
Could you unfilter the message telling you that you treated a patch with compost? I don't know how often I double check the patches because there are so many and I can't look at how many empty buckets I have now
---
Strange how you can freeze people who try to melee you into place :thinking:
---
"I'm like, really smart. Like a stable genius"
---
-Trump
---
The mage phase randomly switches between mage and range attacks. You protect from mage but are forced to tank the range hits if they happen
---
Yo I dig this.
---
Save time, see world
---
You can remove special attack orb iirc. Check out options 
---
Imagine wearing gear that gives a prayer bonus!!!!
---
Haha yeah that one's annoying if you don't have wildy hard. Once you get past med level it turns into teleportscape though
---
You're a hero
---
Android, feelsbadman

11 year old me fell for this, then pulled off the same scam 30 seconds later and bought real full veracs another minute later.

Can tool leprechauns let you withdraw noted buckets and noted compost. Whenever my empty buckets get to 999 it is very tedious to take them all out and drop them. Also same with the compost because it takes forever to withdraw all compost
---
That got me for a dfh lmao. Was like oh
---
Gratz. Thank you for making me depressed again. L0L
---
I understand what you mean and i worded the title poorly. the combination of the way points are earned + the faulty servers is what the problem is. all they would need to do to fix this is make it to where if you suddenly log out in the middle of the minigame, anything you have planted should return to your inventory in the form of seeds.
---
Can we just make the pouches not degrade? It's really just annoying more than anything
---
Notice how pot heads always have to inject the fact that they smoke weed into every single thing. Fucking 420 dank kush smoke everyday bro.

Are you joining "jeisuru" or "jeisuru cc"?
---
Brown cocaine is not an in game item
---
This account is LITCHRALLY the most overpowered account you can make
---
But why is it a unsafe death, you bring nothing in, Its actually being balanced explicitly against them rather.
---
It doesn't make any sense, normal accounts are losing nothing when dying they get the reward regardless as do dead hcims.
---
There's absolutely no penalty for death is my point except for these accounts.
---
You can go to an npc in nardah that will crush all of your secondary’s for a small fee
---
Yeah that's a good idea. Seems thematic as well with the other crystal equipment upgrades
---
Anyone else concerned about a huge content update locked behind 7 quests that are not easy to complete?
---
The ability to wield fishing rod/fishing tool and not take up a space.
---
Hehe, not this time.
---
'Mage' phase has a 30%(?) chance to range. People will usually venge when they see the range hits come out (little green orbs).
---
ohh I get it now
---
Also the bow can be imbued at nmz so you don’t need to repair it until it’s 0/10 which if you don’t use it much, makes it waaaay cheaper than that 
---
Duradel if you use cannon/burst 
---
Konar if you don’t.
---
elite diaries and raids are absolutely NOT aimed at casuals, nor should they be.
---
57 herb for qpc, 66 for all hard diaries, both boostable. that's well within reach without any changes.
---
same mistakes as rs3 did back in the day + osrs has gotten waaay more easyscape updates than rs3 did= its pretty clear how osrs future will look if jagex dosnt change
---
It passed twice lol. By the time Jagex for their thumb out of their asses the vocal community members swayed enough people to barely make it fail and even then it was by less than 1%. If the polls were hidden it would have of passed.
---
Treasure trail steps that require you to answer an NPC's question are currently answered in different ways depending on the level of the clue. Could these be standardized?

Servers are fine for me and many others my dude. If your internet is fine then your ISP is shitting the bed somewhere along the way. 
---
You no lucky 
---
&gt; Because that content demonstrates value to the customer
---
What customer? F2p customers?
---
&gt;shows some of the stuff available in members
---
It doesn't show anything in members if it's f2p.... In fact, speaking specifically of rune arrows and yew bows not being f2p, it's probably a better way to tease members content, because f2p can see the progression of bronze to rune and they realize they only have adamant arrows available.
---
Jesus dude, the vast majority of your comments are heavily advocating for super easyscape because you can't be bothered to play the game. You complain about literally anything that you can't do because you either lack the little amount of skill required, or you just don't like putting effort into a game. What's wrong with you?
---
It still costs 150k to have it recharged, imbue doesn’t do anything to the initial cost.

The fact that she’s standing in from of an immunization banner, ain’t no cure for RABIES honey boo boo

If Microsoft bought them and brought runescape to xbox id be so happy. Not to mention the funding-moans-

Except nobody actually reads the questions, they just look it up on the wiki or use a client plug-in. So it’s more clicking for most people.

A crystal pouch which can hold 16 pure ess but needs the shards to repair.

I should do that but I'm too lazy to set them up

Isn't not dying the entire purpose of your accounts? Just don't die. If you feel that the risk is too great, don't take it. I guess I just don't see your complaint.  You create a HCIM/UIM explicitly because of the risk and difficulty it entails, and yet here you are crying on Reddit because the content is too risky for an HCIM/UIM. If you don't believe you're good enough to survive content without dying, why are you even playing on one of these accounts? 
---
Post your stats please ans good job

There will be enough people and the whales will outspend you 100x each.

Top 3 valued items, then untradables.
---
If your untradables have higher value than the tradable ones, the tradable fall to the floor.
---
Also make sure to excercise, even doing some simple bodyweight excercises will go a long way. 
---
How about this: if you want stackable food, you use the one in game? There's no wiggle room to add something weaker than sweets. Your idea to balance them by limiting the stack is a no go for me.
---
Stacked food isn't meant to be accessible to poor people. It's very powerful and as a result, very expensive
---
Whine-whine, but please Jagex keep the design in a low polygon style... It makes my heart warm.
---
Look on the bright side. Blizzard could buy it, we could all ride around on our pets as mounts, and we can completely sunset agility as a skill! /s 
---
That's why you limit cookies to how many you could have, and they'd only heal 1. Purple sweets can heal up to 3.
---
Exactly.
---
This is an MMO. It's way more interactive/entertaining for players to play content as a group.
---
Can't the gauntlet be made into group content with a choice to go solo?
---
Thank you, will do!

Sorry didnt mean to come off personal to you, was my opinion to what you posted 
---
People said the same things about Ubisoft after AC Unity and all the AC/FC formulaic games that they've always kind of cruised on since 2011.
---
The Bethesda thing will probably just fizzle out the same way because that circlejerk is mostly made up of people who can't see the forest through the trees.
---
Bethesda (and Ubisoft) don't have a moutain of defunct developers and franchises under their belts either.  
---
There's one publisher that does.  And it's going to take a metric shit ton for the likes of Bethesda to dethrone them.
---
Bad idea, sorry man. Save up for sweets if you really want to use stack food
---
How lost can one be lmao
---
okay, so a new quest which won't be completable for hcim, and if you are among the top 0,1 % who would manage to do the quest you get access to a new minigame - which of course will remove your hardcore status, do you really hate hardcores that much? If there is no risk for normal players there should be no risk for hardcores... Will surely vote no for this update.
---
Still if I didn’t have black dhide on they would’ve had a much higher chance.
---
I mostly want them for poormans fight cave, the brews and restores are expensive enough.
---
Yeah this is why I have trust issues now 
---
Something something $11.
---
I'd rather activation buy it than Epic.
---
i could write a 100k word essay on everything that is currently wrong with old school.

But this tweet from sick nerd can be said about every newspost + jagex whole concept of 4 big updates every year even tho they dosnt have anything good planned are 2 of the big issues currently

you mean f2p end game right?
---
&gt;Currently, the first option of the Pharaoh's Sceptre is a teleport instead of the usual "Wield", which in some cases can be frustrating for our muscle memory, even leading towards the point where some people are encouraged enough to take advantage of this by part-taking in lures. Please, make "Wield" the default/first option.
---
No, when you do PP you left click it
---
sorry your hardcore died m8 but this post has nothing to do with that lol
---
 Stack of 50-150 would not last for a  fight caves run.
---
I hate killing sire. I feel like the effort outweighs the reward.
---
    trident of the seas cost for 5 casts: 1875
---
    SOTD fire wave cost for 4 casts: 2035.5
---
    SOTD fire surge cost for 4 casts: 2553.5
---
    trident of the swamp cost for 5 casts: 2975
---
if you wanna factor in how the attack speeds affect your average kill times, see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/40bvk6/accuracy_and_exphr_combat_formula/). work out the average damage per hit, divide the enemy hp by that number, and then multiply by the number of ticks (4 or 5)
---
They have mentioned the wiki on their stream, and they have it on their website, every video talks about it, hardly anybody plays the game without googling, don’t make an excuse, you found this game some way, therefore you were on the internet, everyone learns from somewhere and starts from nothing. Invest your time to learn things and how their done not just assume max is necessary, watch streams, go to YouTube and go to wiki. Easy GOOGLE  lol
---
I only had a kitten, worst quest experience yet could have done one small favour in the time it took me to get orange spice only.
---
Link to his soundcloud?
---
Not if they wear black dhide
---
Yeah, but it came out with mud staff, seercull, and dks rings. I don't think that slightly better skilling items is interesting enough for new content these days
---
Sparc Mac too 
---
I see, this makes sense
---
I’m a teleblockie and i support
---
Why not completable for hcim?
---
Did you stop watching the video?
---
If you're stuck in a part and the guy in the video isn't, that's user error on your end. Sure, for you personally there might be a disconnect in following the directions of a video, but if you're wondering what to do next when someone is literally showing you click for click exactly what to do next, that's on you.
---
Either they should do away with the degrading stats aspect, make non-degrading a bonus from either Mourning's End I or II, or add it as an achievement diary benefit. Half of the NMZ rewards just don't make sense.
---
You can also use any of the items you get from the urns on the mummy and he’ll charge the scepter with that type.
---
You're not in the right place. The fight caves entrance is in front of the bank.
---
Adding a new hops patch might make it go the same way as herbs though, where you need to do more patches to get the same amount of profit as before.
---
Yanillian hops are decent profit for the amount of effort required. If you need to invest more time to get that profit I can see it drawing players away from doing it. It'd go from being a nice little side thing to do to being a chore.
---
Bush patches though? Sure. I'd be down for mushroom patches getting some love as well. Growable Mort Myre Fungi when?
---
So does this new armor make justiciar dead content?
---
That's pretty cool
---

I really recommend using a zulrah helper plugin to learn. If you google Josephs place zulrah guide you can find his youtube video explaining how to use his plugin and a link to it.
---
The main thing is to start running as soon as it goes down, and switch while you run. 
---
If you're on mage phase make sure you always have at least ~45hp, and bring a few karambwans in case he bullies you with ranged hits

Haha I have a 3rd generation iPad too I'm browsing on right now.

Yasssss🙌🏼🙌🏼
---
I was just looking at keyboards from the 90s and they have it lol
---
Couldn’t agree more lol. Cooking cape is worse than rocking obby cape imo.
---
Right, main reason I say fire wave is cheaper than seas is because of Gp/boss or Gp/minute. Hypothetically let's say trident of the seas and fire wave killed a boss in the exact same time. You'd end up spending more with seas because you fast it more even though you kill it in the same time
---
Fair enough. I will say that it's important to recognize that I think they just want you to risk more with black d'hide. So if you want to rag do so in Blue/Red d'hide. Kinda like using Xercian Robes to PK with when you don't want to risk mystic. Except black d'hide is as close to as powerful as kharil's for non degradeable. It's also the same price as the rag mage set up using Xercian.
---
The reason I bring up robes is they were also discussing Wildy balance and Warding. The intent is to provide tanky mage armour via warding to help balance things a bit.
---
They haven't polled anything and are clearly not of one focus yet, so everything is just suggestions. It doesn't help that Youtube puts front and center that stupid clickbait video from OSRS video rehosters saying in bold letters "MOD ARCHIE NERFING BLACK D'HIDE??!".
---
Seriously that video is stirring some shit up that was just part of a discussion for a Q&amp;A.
---
I don't either, but yes that would be better xp. 
---
Tick manipulation means you do the fewest amount of ticks possible anyway, whether using bronze or dragon or crystal. That's just how mining works.
---
Uhh why would you assume that?
---
I can't speak too well for Ubisoft since I stopped supporting them a long time ago. No idea how they are now.
---
which one? there’s 2 of them isn’t there?
---
I mean cactus spines are dropping because more people are growing them and people are insta selling everyday.  Even with yew seeds rising everyday. 
---
Oh, i didnt know it used to be against the rules lol. When did it change?
---
You don't have to use the new patch? And if you're concerned about profits, you already have much better money making options if you can complete a grandmaster quest and get to Priffindas. Herb runs wouldn't be worth your time GP wise. XP wise, herb runs are mediocre when compared to planting trees.
---
Adding a new herb patch benefits Ironmen and people who like farming.
---
Well yeah... That's why you wear armour with magic defence...
---
sure lemme just find this snapdragon drop from the 13 loot piles on the floor, a lot without bones so you can't find the actual pixel-sized seed.
---
brb posting to QOL month thread

Oh my dayyyyyssss (wtf does that mean ?!?!?)

And a Crystal pouch  instead of the Crystal harpoon as a fishing tool doesn't fit Zalcano. The Crystal Pouch can hold up to 16 pure ess and needs to be repaired using the new shards.
---
Jagex is adding chemicals to the water and making frogs gay, making ra
---
I got to level 90 ranged with an incomplete void set. i didn't know gloves was a thing
---
Yup that's exactly right. I mistakenly said seas was cheaper than fire wave though. The important takeaway I like to make is that swamp is actually worse than surge in dps and cost. Most people think swamp is a default best magic weapon and everything else is dead content, but for barrows it's not the case.
---
No xp waste
---
It should at least compare to a rune crossbow with broad bolts. 
---
you are right, but the average person in 2019 isnt considered "smart" so no surprise that the average person hates pures :)
---
More like Minigamescape which is yeah kind of exactly what we need. It's the only neglected part of the game (with the exception of LMS, which just had so much potential and was dropped)
---
Honestly thought I would never get a pet, so I believe in your luck! Go get em :)
---
He went down like a champion and will forever be remembered as one
---
I mean if you're geared enough to clear caves in 30 minutes you should already have the cape tbh.
---
\*Video Length 10:01\*
---
What is that item anyway 
---
Its 4m+ per hour doloing with max efficientcy. Bringing more pvmers to the wildy isn't the answer to reviving the wildy. If you want to say they're all dead content just becuase other money making methods are better then I guess zulrah is dead content now and needs a buff becuase vorkath, tob (I think) and maybe hydra are better. 
---
Hmm weird, usually whenever it's stuck at updating on any app it's due to corrupt cache or network issues. Have you checked the permissions for the app? Maybe your phone is blocking it from using data. 
---
I would love for it to be non degradable w/ really high reqs. 
---
Amen.
---
I've been doing this and I'm currently sat at 161 QP. I've had the sub quests done for about a month. Quest grinding sucks lol
---
Ever since For Honor I never brought from them again. Campaign was just a long tutorial D:
---
&gt; I get maybe a kill with it before having to teleport out. 
---
1 kill??? Are you doing it naked or without antifires? Pretty much all of vorkath's damage is avoidable.
---
A new runecrafting pouch would be a good thing to poll later. It's a way bigger deal than harpoon/pickaxe/axe.
---
And the Ironman herb grind is REAL. Give me 100 patches and honestly... I'd still want more 
---
Don’t forget other obscure items like Polish buttons and Charcoal, everyone was genuienly a noob back then and had no idea that those items existed, you had people selling them for 500k each, Varrock sellers were devious as fuck back in the day. God i miss that time of my life man.
---
I miss the dragons

&gt;	It was the last big update that people remember alongside Eoc so they’re forever associated.
---
Not really...
---
Just looked at the [game updates,](https://runescape.wiki/w/Game_updates) there were massive updates between the release of dungeoneering in 2010 and EoC which released 2012.
---
Updates between that time were Runestax, Nex (which was major...), QBD, polypore dungeon, dominion tower, Jadinko Lair, and so much more. 
---
1. Monster (noticeably big) dies
---
2. Chat alert pops up saying it dropped something 
---
3. Click square where monster died
---
4. Pick up loot
---
You are free to complain that if you're afking you might miss something but you're *literally not looking at the screen on purpose* so it's that's gonna be a tough one to justify. 
---
Sounds kinds hot tbh does she let him watch
---
I am going to win the lottery and purchase Jagex in full.
---
I don't want any profits, I just want to play...... and be given the ability to instantly reset someone's account to lvl 69 combat when crashing me at Bandos....

But other than that, just play.

Hello darkness my old friend

Again that’s not what I’m saying, but as you can’t seem to understand I’ll just end this here, have a good day :)

LET OUR CHARS BE LEFT HANDED
---
So easy, but it would actually be sick if you were left handed IRL and wanted your char to hold whip in left hand defender in right hand
---
RIP 4 sharks
---
When banking items, sometimes the first item in the inventory is deposited when any of the same item is clicked, but sometimes the item that is clicked is deposited. This makes it really annoying to deposit multiple items by left clicking. Can the behavior be uniform for all items?
---
The blowpipe with a bgs is dps than a dhcb with no defense reduction.
---
You should be able to get around 5-7 kills without leaving the room with the dhcb. You are missing something. Watch a guide or post your inv setup and gear and what overhead pray you use.
---
dumbfucks need to learn to not put the same passwords on all their shit lmao. 3b bank and never got recovered or hacked in over a decade, I stake a lot so I know my name goes around. Let idiots lose their accounts my man ✌🏼 it's their fault, not jagex's
---
increased total level requirement to vote on polls to 2000, maybe even with a retroactive recounting of all past polls :)
---
entity hider for official client, because using remote desktop to not see people while on mobile is unfeasible
---
actual punishment for deaths - blowpipe losing percentage of scales/darts, rune pouch loses x amount of runes, more costs to retrieve stuff etc
---
Due to the effects of overkill dps, swamp is likely better than surge for barrows due to how little hp each brother actually has.
---
The whip can be protected, just use a DDS for specs.
---
I still only see you guys complaining about the price. 
---
So maybe it should take more d-hides to make a body.
---
Well said, was quite excited till I read “solo”. :(
---
*seal claps followed by Dudley Dursley laughs*
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you
---
I fully agree,
---
Wilderness bosses should provide the highest gp/h in the game.
---
After all, the wilderness is the only place in the game where risk still exists.
---
Is there any reason why the devs are so vague on what will be in the quest? Isn't it important to know about the puzzles or boss fights about the quest before voting on it, rather than just the rewards?
---
My stats: 78 Range, 63 Prayer, 71 Def, 74 Hitpoints.

Doing in void with extended superior anti. Range hits me hard. I am on mobile but even on PC it can get up to 3mins plus a kill
---
I’m at 7700ish right now, good luck homie 
---
I distinctly said it would not increase XP rates by an extreme amount. This would be a small enough change so you'd get more XP than before, but only by the amount of time it takes for you to do an NPC contact spell. This might increase the XP rate and not have the hassle of having to contact an NPC to repair pouches. After doing some calculations, it would only increase XP rates by about 767xp per hour. 
---
I don’t like them because for the low-mid level bracket of pvp they are incredibly overpowered. There aren’t that many games out where a lvl 60 has anywhere near the dps output of someone lvl 90. 
---
I don’t automatically vote no to pvp updates, but things that buff pures, most recent suggestion being a 1 handed strength weapon with stats better than a whip. 
---
Same concept to irons. I don’t want updates that are overpowered for ironmen. Most recent buzz thats a straight buff for only irons was the proposed sandstorm spell on lunars. Its an unnecessary buff that trivializes a somewhat difficult skill. 
---
There has to be a reason and it has to be balanced. Pures are already overpowered for their combat level. Adding things to make pures stronger for the sake of making them stronger isn’t something i can easily get behind 
---
What Pest Control needs is activity meter that's based on damage done on portals and spinners and those ONLY. People who spend all their games whacking other monsters and causing more to spawn are not helping in the slightest
---
Quit clowning' on yourself
---
Here's my uneducated point of view: people probably hate pures because it feels like they are 'cheating', abusing game mechanics to gain massively inflated damage output at a very low level. So massive in fact that you cannot effectively fight back as a normal average low level player. That's my look on things; might be open for discussion.
---
What if we hire the hijackers to get our information for us so we can correctly fill out the recovery questions?

How do you replicate this? I've never seen this and am interested if I'm doing something different. 
---
How about we get jojo poses instead
---
I think you are missing the point of what it would be used for. People already mage in band is and justiciar for the range defense and this new armor has higher range defense without the negative mage defense. You would bring a range top and legs switch still 
---
these are hilarious i really wish these all still looked like thhs
---
I don't think "enjoy" is the word I would use
---
isnt jad one of the easiest bosses in the game?
---
It isn't lol.
---
This game isnt designed around Ironmen. You already got a massively ironman pandering update with Kebos.
---
This is likely gonna shit out resources and make a fair amount of gp too if previous content is anything to judge it by. Good gp+xp is too much considering the current state of RC. Bosses shouldn't be the best xp for anything, it's the unique drops that should matter
---
Another herb patch lmfao.
---
Also the armour set is only good with the chally? Will we receive any other crystal weapons?
---
I refuse to disagree

---
It’s a fucking big content expansion you brainlet, not just a grandmaster quest.
---
Because authenticator delay isn't really going to fix this. Every website and game that has 2fa has no removal delay. But the problem with Runescape is that you can recover account with old information which doesn't make any sense. The reason you change your password is that your old info is not safe anymore. Also if you have 2fa enabled, you can still log in on the Runescape website even if you don't have access to it. 
---
It should not, but they should still be taken into considerstion. All updates lately are locked behind high req. or just qol updates for ironmen, no updates for a very long time that skilling oriented people could enjoy.
---
Farming guild was just a qol for lazy pvmers and ironmen.
---
camelot lumby and yanille patches are very accessible.

Why not focus on making the skills more interesting? This just makes the grind worse since you miss out on content

Great gesture, but the grand exchange is not the best place to give out items.  Most people there are beggers or people pretending to be noobs so they get free stuff and transfer to their mains.  Best thing to do is walk around and give items to people actively training their stats 
---
true, but just for dks its pretty OP.
---
Yes you can play your account on your pc
---
Are people really complaining about the magic defense? I think the magic defense is fine given that it is range gear, and range is supposed to be good against magic. What isn't fine is that it also offers very good melee defenses on top of that, and the chaps and vambraces don't require a defense level to wear. 
---
Yeah I always use ultracompost too. Still see them die occasionally, and it hurts a lot more when a ranarr dies than a toadflax. 
---
not counting aoe attacks, yes.
---
That’s a great idea , I should find people grinding woodcutting or mining any skill really , and give them a TON of what they are grinding 
---
As if we need more bosses
---
but it always had a solo mode
---
Increase click size of agility obstacles on mobile - specifically the tripwire 
---
controlling rs with an xbox controller sounds like a nightmare
---
Pretty sure #1 killer is malaria
---
What do you guys think the face tattoo people will do in 30 years?
---
I think it was discussed on the q&amp;a, but not confirmed.
---
Thank yourselfs for encouraging jagex to focus on PvM updates 'only' and no proper skilling updates to make the long grinds more fun and rewarding
---
Not sure if this qualifies as qol but I would like a sleeveless toggle on my fighter torso. Purely for fashion scape purposes, this surely wouldn’t take up too much time? ^^pretty please
---
bank the bcp and bracelet.
---
You say that, but that's exactly how they are designing the game now.
---
that's true if you don't understand probability.
---
You can cannon and semi-safespot. Really doesn’t take long at all to get that
---
&gt;Why does it?
---
It's literally something extra to do, it's additional content. Unless it's bad content, why is it wrong to add to the game? 
---
&gt;I see the storyline as finished. You can add storylines ad infinitum. Its fabricated. And not needed. Why would it be needed? Lol.
---
Jagex don't. **Why does it have to be NEEDED to be in the game** holy fuck dude. You just keep stating that as if that's a sufficient reason to oppose it.
---
&gt;Dragon tools. Not dragon armour.
---
Tiols are equipment you tit. Again, why remove dragon tools?
---
&gt;? what is it about then
---
It's about updating the game? Giving players new stuff to do? What do you define as 'needed'?
---
&gt;Thats literally what it takes for something to be considered an update worth introducing. You wanna introduce updates, not for good reasons, "just because" or "muh something new xD new good new good" 
---
And you want them to not introduce updates, even if they have no negative consequences and only add to the game, because they aren't literally necessary.
---
Honestly you're a fucking gimp dude. 
---
Deal. 
---
no.
---
Decrease the range defense bonus on the armor and increase the damage and accuracy effect?
---
Adding 120 capes/comp capes even if theyre just cosmetic. Give us something more to go for!!!
---
Rs3 became a cesspool of constant microtransaction events that make up 90% of the updates. 
---
Makes it easier for people to relate and see the engagement
---
I think it's just a vocal minority.  I've never talked to someone ingame that hates pures.
---
I dc at least 5 times a day.
---
Can we get this to the top of google when you search for torvesta? 
---
I mean it's not really an issue with those, since they *do* disappear if you don't have the required runes; meanwhile the enchant crossbow bolt is literally always there, even if you have no items on you at all
---
Lets start a go fund me for andrew gower to take back the company and make runescape great again!
---
GE clerk at every major bank.
---
So you can use your analog sticks to move your cursor? Sounds terrible 
---
Runecrafting isnt as bad as Agility or Mining.
---
Fight me.
---
Yes, you share the same OSRS account regardless of whether it is on PC or mobile.
---
There are two instances I can think of that you may have been reading about. Although you share the same username/password for the below, they are separate "accounts":
---
* RuneScape 3 and OldSchool RuneScape do not share the same account
---
* Logging into a Deadman world does not share the same account as OSRS
---
They're 200m thief or something, since a pet doesn't make em' move
---
Meanwhile  we get 10 new bounty hunter worlds...
---
If it's in an area that's already quest-locked behind Underground Pass/Mourning's Ends/etc., I'm not sure what else you could do.
---
I miss the zombies :(
---
The crystal tree idea is fine since a lot of people seem to dislike the herb patch. 
---
But crystal shards being untradeable limits how good the crystal tools are. Basically a tiny improvement over dragon tools except you have to spend tons of time to recharge them - not worth it. 
---
Crystal shards being untradeable seems unnecessary, they should be tradeable like zulrah scales. Either that or the crystal items need quite the massive buff to compensate. 
---
I just dont see how  any1 except a very very small percent of people can actually listen to the People i just listed
---
The game's AI is also really broken which really makes for terrible gameplay when there's nothing to do aside from exploring and combat.
---
Nice budget cape w/zero reqs!
---
I don't even do clue scrolls any more, after hundreds of clues, the best I've even gotten was a pair of ranger gloves from an elite clue. I sold them for 1.5m and guess what? A week later Jagex announces new BiS range gloves...made using ranger gloves + a new item. It fell through, but it was still a kick in the teeth.
---
If they didn't force us into wilderness content, clues would be much more tolerable, but pkers honestly have way more than enough people to kill without also getting to harassing clue farmers. And I don't enjoy having to either take all my gear off, or put on my anti-pk rag set every time I need to step past that stupid ditch. It just breaks the entire flow of clues.  
---
Some kind of 'bad luck protection'(eg, you do 100-200 clues without ever hitting rdt, then you get a guaranteed roll on your next clue, then it resets.) would also be great, but I don't many would go for that.
---
Remember that there are integrity changes coming to death mechanics. That would mean that the death would be punishing in the future. I think jagex are just sick of making all content safe deaths
---
Yes. You need to associate it with an email before you do. 
---
Can we imbue the secateurs to either speed up or give higher yield with crystals?
---
konar was probably never worth it.
---
God damn I miss runespan.  I've played runescape since 2005 and the highest my runecrafting level ever got to was 35 without runespan. That's only because of quests/tears of guthix.  Rc sucks.
---
But when runespan came out I got it to like 80 or something and it was enjoyable
---
Oh ya and that lv 35 Rc is my current main lol
---
Yeah people would claw korasi a lot :p
---
What corp scam? Explain pls?
---
How much does that actually happen though? For example, the price of torstol seems a little more erratic. Their lowest price was 4-5k, which was before fossil island was released, which greatly increased their yield with volcanic ash. The price has decreased some since the release of the farming guild, but its still going up and down.
---
That's why we need headphones amd a hoodie in game.
---
Wait.. no dat boi was last year right? It was wasn't it? TELL ME IT WAS!!!
---
Can we add a crystal crossbow and/or crystal quiver which can add either bolt/arrow effects or add more range strength to the crysyal bow?
---
But it makes massive profits, yields nostalgia if you're doing laws/nats, and is quite enjoyable when you get into it
---
^(actually rs3) 
---
Honestly so surprised with how negative the replies were, but at the same time now I understand why PvP will always have problems. 
---
ur looking at the number of people who now have a life
---
I believe Since 2005 all accounts created need to be logged in via email. Not username. 
---
I actually really like the idea of updated secateurs. To me the elves are not the ones to give the reward though. That's just my two cents.
---
Just one more level and you can boost for Falador elite.
---
Search for youtube video for clear instructions. It's a really misleading scam didn't see it coming at all. 
---
gf bank
---
The game is 2D isometric and the camera is fixed like in Diablo 1 and 2, and all combat attacks and spells can be avoided by moving, like in League of Legends and Dark Souls. No excessive rolling though, that'd be a nightmare to animate and I suspect not everyone would want the combat to be fast paced.    
---
Other cool things you can do is build fortresses underground. Extremely impractical at the moment cause of all the survival aspects, but I'll add supply wagons sometime later so people can transport goods easily across a large distance.    
---
It's still pretty unfinished. I'll ask a subreddit mod if they mind me promoting sometime when its in alpha.
---
Boxer
---
Also worth noting (sorry guys rs3 info coming) that the majority of the best content creators over on our side left a few years ago too.
---
I hope something good comes out of whoever buys them but i’m worried for the future of both our games 
---
 1500 kc and u suck so much? Wtf xd 
---
oh my god, valve never creates a third title...
---
EVERYONE MESSAGE GABE, WE NEED THE PC GOD TO ACQUIRE OUR HOMELANDS!
---
They can though. You can always have separate pvp balancing.
---
What does your house layout look like?  If your house fits in a 4x4 then that's all it'll load.  Level 50 just means you *can* have a 6x6 if you build enough rooms.
---
Maybe with a rent to own option? After so many payments you get to keep it forever. But if you k/miss 1 it's gone and so is your money
---
I think that it seeping into every other aspect of the game just to balance out PvP is more impactful on the game than dhide currently is. I’d honestly rather keep it how it currently is because I don’t see changing the amount of d’hide you use to make the d’hide armor being a good way to balance a problem that only affects PvP. 
---
guys im sure there a list longer than my body on that log, instead of more, please work through some of the list already.
---
keep doing what you are doing
---
much love
---
The Virgin Zalcano vs The Chad Wintertodt
---
As a maxed player, I would have raced you for them so I can sell them. Doesn’t matter what total level you are, you can always be a noob at heart.
---
Its am ADVENTURE game, youre supposed to go ADVENTURE and find shit out. 
---
Back in the day yes it was sir. I’ve played this game since 2006.
---
I  saw it happen bro, brand new account, not compromised
---
OH MAYTE THIS IS A BANK PEEKAAY 
---
Literally stayed up all night doing that damn quest. Been camping harambes since. Got a heavy frame and 2 springs so far in 144 kills...... rip
---
Black d hide is fine
---
200m xp pack 149.99
---
pvpers will vote no
---
Yeah revert it back and enjoy getting 5000 air runes
---
Rambo?
---
No, Serene is much more polite and eloquent to the point of appearing pompous. This guy is just a boorish imbecile.
---
Ha same, except I need to finish Shadow of the Storm, Desert Treasure, and Monkey Madness. 
---
Grotesque Guardians. This boss is cool and unique but not fun in the slightest to kill (in my opinion). The main reason for that is the amount of down time in each fight.  
---
Could we please get to do SOMETHING in the transitional phase where they are spawning "energy" on the ground? It could be something like halved damage like with vorkath. You would still have to avoid the energy but it would slightly speed it up and would make it a nice optional mechanic.  
---
The orbs you have to get to stop the healing are also annoying. Once again the idea it self is not bad but considering you take more damage the longer it takes to get to them, they are spread unfairly. Even if you have to be tick perfect you should be able to collect all 3 with time to only take 5 damage from each. It'd also be nice to be more easy to click on when spawning under the boss.  
---
I don't mind the gp/hr or xp/hr of the boss. I don't think everything has to be better than the next. I just don't like the downtime where you do nothing but walk around a bit.
---
maybe reduce to 80 and give 15% then its good. Lv 95 version = 25% to all.
---
New whales stop coming in when the game dies
---
nice black mask
---
exactly
---
You would burst them in catacombs so probably alot more :)
---
Yeah bird nest boxes to make Sara brews 
---
It’s literally your choice to go and do that content in the wilderness, and the only reason people do that content is because of how good it is and it’s only that good BECAUSE it’s in the wilderness. It doesn’t seem fair to nerf the PKing communities biggest weapon and then force them to either PvM for it to make it the same weapon they just had or buy it off the GE. Seems pretty scummy to do. Imagine if they nerfed blowpipe but there was an item that you could get that changes it to how it was pre-nerf BUT it was a 1/100 untradeable drop off of a BH kill. I think putting it in the BH shop is more than fine.
---
True. Might be a good follow up quest that involves fairies?
---
How does it devalue pets when every pet is a unique pet?
---
Hmm not to sure any that
---
You chose to limit yourself, its not like you can't get combat xp, you just choose not to.
---
Have fun at sand crabs
---
Tbh
---
Looks cool
---
This is incorrect. Even just switching to ahrims over dharoks or some other tank armor is a 2-3% dps increase when casting on dharoks. The dps change is even bigger against Karil.
---
7kc finaly? 
---
Honestly I’d say an hour..
---
content bloat
---
It is a change to the content if the profit margin on herb seeds changes.
---
Besides, the comment I replied to didn't say not to do the new patch, it said not to do herb runs at all.
---
I think he might be too late now.
---
I always feel so awkward as a near max main in my bis slayer gear running down from greater demons in katacombs to pick up rune axes and other nech drops the barragers are leaving on the ground. 
---
Thank you! Lots of afking involved :)
---
I appreciate it. :)
---
Thanks friend. This is related, but you’re great.
---
I feel yah, just finished all the subquests now 30 qp away from finishing.
---
repost this in 2020 when Priffdinas is in osrs and devs are thinkin bout adding more tier 80 equipment
---
Really would like to see a buff to crystal bow as even with the armor it would be outclassed by everything (as it currently is) still seeing as it has no accuracy. Its such a cool T70 weapon that needs a major upgrade. It would be really nice to see it have a use in PvP, yes not accessible to pures.  Even a few new crystal weapons such as a crystal staff(mage k0)  or sword/ heavy axe. 
---
So many opportunities here jagex! Please expand on them and make them useful.  The fact bows go from msb (t50) to tbow(t75/t90) is really underwhelming for what should be the most used range equipment.  Maybe even use seercull with crystal bow for upgrade insperatio 
---
Support, but there needs to be more rewards. Maybe make a new upgrade patch for elite void that boost its defence or strength by a little bit at the cost of making void degradable.
---
What's 'substantial justification' then? Cause it sounds like unless it's what you personally want exactly you'll bitch about it being included. 
---
&gt;Your entire reasoning is that "its good". That's the entirety of your reasoning. Incredible. Incredible.
---
Lol dude you're falling apart. New quests are good. New stuff to do is good, unless there's a problem with it. You can't identify a single fucking problem.
---
&gt;ME SEE NEW CONTENT ME LIKEY LIKEY
---
&gt;ME LIKEY LIKEY RUNESCAPE 3
---
&gt;actual brainlet
---
Lol dude as if you think your fucking argument is in any way intelligent hahahahahaha get fucked you complete cretin. 
---
U know he got ags bc he's a pker. Pvmers ain't dumb enough to do this shit 
---
as a pet hunter this is making me thirsty af pls spinner pet jabits
---
What bosses exactly? 
---
\&gt; but not enough for this change to be of benefit   
---
literally every bracket except 60's is dead in BH every usa cycle.
---
that's just silly, if you're already doing 6 why not do 3 more?
---
Right though lmaoooo I’ve done over 200 mediums never got rangers 
---
Even if there's enough mobs in a world for 2 or more lol I'll still hop to an empty world. when I have to complete wyrm task I wait till like 4am.
---
It's like an actual farmer playing Farming Simulator.
---
Or go to 2k total worlds to kill skillers and people that don’t even put up a fight because they weren’t expecting to be pk’d
---
RS3 actually has some of these QOLs.
---
more bank space please
---
It's funny yet sad at the same time.
---
Owh yeah that happend too.
---
Pretty clever of whoever found it. Personally found it a tad to tedious to use though 
---
dumb question but how do you boost rc?
---
Loooooool main quiting for 33m wen uim loses bills and still plays 😂
---
I’m going to buy it.
---
not quite though
---
Bit of elitism going on here, fuck might even give it a stretch and say narcissism. 
---
Cool it big boy
---
Is this a joke post or something? 
---
Wax Man Only Ironman - Can only move and do things if nobody else is on your screen or minimap, must play on high population worlds.
---
Fuck it, let's get a kick starter going!
---
Him getting posted here was probably his best chance at success, and here we are unanimously shitting on him and we don't even know his name
---
God forbid they release new content to maintain the momentum and growth the games had this past year.
---
God forbid they add a city that’s been on the game map for 14 years. 
---
Lmao yeah mine was to get the infernal cape and I got it 2 days after meeting an irl friend with an 11b bank who gave me his spare TBow and Ely. Now idk wtf I wanna do.
---
Herb patch belongs in the farming guild.
---
Tbh I prefer this 100%. I don’t want another patch to add to a farm run lol
---
