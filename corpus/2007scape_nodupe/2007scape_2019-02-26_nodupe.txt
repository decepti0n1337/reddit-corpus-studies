What did you do for 70 prayer? I'm also an UIM but having a headache thinking about getting from 61 to 70 prayer

the best part about your video is that it's not 10 minutes long.

the best part about this comment is its not 2:33 long. 
---
thanks. 
---
This is the first actual clip I have watched of this whole situation. This shit is so staged! 
---
RIP account buddy. Take this down and repost with blocked name and run energy
---
they are adding an indicator to the cave (?) so you can see when hespori is fully grown without needing to enter. 
---
One shaddows to imagine what inhuman thoughts lie behind that mask
---
\&gt; the point is that kind of law would not be constitutional in the first place in America 
---
Yeah, and overt bribery is.  But hey at least you can heil hitler in peace.
---
Also, the point is that count Dankula doesn't resemble a friend in any fashion, and discussions of comparative law are irrelevant.
---
Damn. I’m at 20 kc on my alt and I’ve hit it 4 times, including a dragon med helm (fuck me.) I’m waiting on something like that to happen lol 
---
Yeah cuz that shit looked like poop, bad memories
---
Finally actual 2007scape content. 
---
That dot on the image.
---
Why do you do this to me 
---
new ardy cape 5
---
But its really rare to find a non taken one. Even if its random letters
---
Sounds embarrassing
---
Not sure where you got the impression that I said it was okay. I just said how he felt lacked any kind of self-awareness.
---
Idk I was in a hurry and did a google image search
---
I've had those dreams 2 or 3 times and they scared the shit out of me everytime
---
Shitty vid
---
Gz on fish chicken
---
Yeah. Karma has no value, so if i have 5 million or -5k it doesn't make a difference. 
---
Ironmen have 80% increased drop chance because they're useless accounts. Gratz tho ;D
---
so you burn 8.3% at 82, but 8% and 81? 🤔
---
Have you thought about cannon + toxic blowie?
---
Ya this i honestly one of my favorite ash gifs. I'm not gay but I'd totally let him rail me in a seedy bathhouse raw!
---
he got "sponsored" by some gambling site and recieved a fuckton of money. Also recieved some osrs gold, so the jmods banned him for rwt on all accounts.
---
Then he suddenly realized hey, I just shat where I eat, and ruined his entire channel with that. 
---
A lot of dislikes and unsubs happened. Some like to pretend it never happened or "I woulda done da same xd" reactions, like the guy before me trying to explain it. 
---
Nobody gets banned for "no reason" and Jagex takes their shit seriously.  (Also he used to be a player mod few years earlier but got status removed due to making vid about how much money scammers make, as it would encourage scamming)
---
Would big tiddy Uighur organs do fine?
---
That's the spirit, we all believe in you!  One day you'll get there!
---
CUTE!
---
Hacked. That bottle gave me the location of your school, which lead me to your name, and both of your RuneScape bank pins. 
---
I’m not at 75 yet, but could happen after I get it! I just can’t find good spots to cannon at all
---
He had more viewers when he was taking donations. 
---
They broke up before the stream. He can't suddenly evict her so there she was.
---
Ive been playing for a decade and sometimes I nolifed hard, but have never ever seen the 6 hour log. I can't go that long without eating, toilet or just a break. Or world hops too.
---
i feel like he only lost like a few hours of progress, im sure his more knowledgeable friend can help him rebuild
---
Ur eye raping me
---
what an idiot
---
Honestly, being this new to Runescape, I don't think tying his goals to a master clue is very reasonable at this level. I feel like having more manageable goals will make him less likely to burn out and quit.
---
DD2? Don't you mean DS2?

It would never pass a poll.

omgf did you take my visafe
---
Expand on story please?
---
lol 
---
Agree with about most of that post except the cringe ending 
---
Pretty sure that's the inferno
---
Okay but once you turn 18 and just watch those youtube videos for 9 years instead of going out and actually practicing sometimes, you have no one to blame except yourself.

Yes. Everything is fine. I don’t know what happened but door opened after I left the Iceland and came back...
---
Salamander is ranged/magic based melee though.

The mace is a guthix staff. The title is confusing me on how it would work.

She probably will be charged considering all evidence is on stream lol

Just stand on opisite ends of and and protect melee and stand in melee range for longest trips
---
Oh wow, someone said a meme phrase on reddit, time to show off how above everything I am, and how unique and original I am. 
---
Mate, no one gives a fuck what you think about on the internet, especially not a generic as fuck comment as "hurr durr, don't want to make the rich richer, amirite?"   
---
Go develop a fucking personality instead of relying on simple contrarianism to guide you through life outside of highschool 
---
Close. I’m A Peirce. The A is Adrian tho. Threw me off
---
Can confirm. 
---
I’m the guy that’ll get the alert when you try to install anything. I caught a guy thinking he was smart and tried to install bitminer and steam. Obviously not smart enough to consider that corporate machines would be monitored. 
---
I play OSRS on weekends and night shifts. Kills time. I simply use the unmonitored and less locked down guest network as opposed to one of the corporate or employee mobile networks. 
---
On my laptop too.

Lmaoo

thanks

I’m pretty new so are you guys serious when you say this?

I agree with that

now we know why a friend was upset for being told not to order any packages to his house

An actual thick cunt.

That's a great idea
---
Mage training arena
---
Hey man I'm eating cereal right now quit that.
---
Is this downvoted because of inaccuracy of prostitute age limit in Nederlands or because of americans not liking the 16 part?
---
Absolutely. It was that forward progression that made it work best.
---
Youre justifying inequality with more inequality.  Break the cycle, yo.
---
I don't see me :(
---
The only place I think it could have a use at is the inferno since it doesn’t have negative mage bonus like justiciar does. This means you won’t splash on the nibblers as often. Other than that I can see it maybe being used at bandos too. Overall pretty niche/useless. 
---
If the gauntlet is meant to be akin to dungeoneering I'm hoping there would be more diverse rewards than just crystal armour with stupidly high ranged defence bonus. 
---
Also as a skilling boss, skillers won't be able to do zolcano because of the HP required which to me seems a bit odd. (But I guess they choose to limit themselves yada yada)
---
Good luck!
---
Good, you didnt deserve it anyways

nice fantasy world lmao. So i guess when u see someone trade gp to a money doubler it's entirely the doubler's fault when the guy gets scammed? take some responsibility
---
thats some absolute ass gear too, gz

The Gielinor public education system is completely outdated and a mess

I think it's fine. It can train strength which is nice. I don't think it's meant to be super strong or expensive

Has anyone brought up the idea of adding a new Grand Exchange to  Prifddinas?  That would be a fantastic way to give higher levels a break from scam spammers....

Can someone fill me in on the streamer drama?? I don’t want the streams very often
---
naive ppl thinking its ok to just trust someone else about literally the most life changing thing u can do (having a kid) lmao
---
It’s a reference to the ‘unforgivable’ series from YouTube when YouTube was first getting big. Relax Captain America. 
---
Most profitable alts? Finally got some more time to play and wanna advance my account without having to grind zulrah for a bond every 2 weeks.
---
Calling peta
---
Where do you think the bonds come from? Someone buys them, and it actually costs more to buy 2 bonds and buy membership with them than buy a months membership.
---
he is most definitely a low level, lol.
---
Where’s it stored?
---
*Up ya bum!*
---
No, i was just saying people may be iffy about you alting and potentially sniping a unique. Full leeching wouldnt be worth it for you or anyone else as you'd get no points therefore no resources.
---
Might be a lot to ask, but could you explain the current streamer drama? I think I’ve missed out 
---
Not quite. 
---
Woox level abuse of game mechanics
---
Oh holy shit, gonna do this tomorrow. Thanks!
---
Be too much just to say boyfriend already?

Rune Dragon alt switching to a Raiding/Zulrah alt for the less intensive skills like Agility.

Finally some good fucking food
---
I'm not justifying anything. I didn't say the inequality was okay. I just find your lack of self-awareness about the situation absurd.  
---
Since the dawn of man, the defining difference between our genders has been ones physical dominance over another. And now, thousands of years and billions of lives later, I am unironically reading men write about their fears of being falsely accused, terrified for the very first time that a woman may hold some undeserved power and malice of them capable of tearing their lives apart.  
---
How you feel is legitimate. How you express it is an insulting farce.
---
&gt; They broke up before the stream
---
Ah, nevermind then.
---
Still no response, not from support or a dm.
---
Nah nothing his content was just pushing twitch tos. Never any drama really.

Forgot Making Friends with My Arm
---
Along with what other people commented, she also tricked him into getting her pregnant so she'd have something from him no matter what. She liked about being on the pill to get pregnant. Sooooo fucked
---
Lmaooooo no way?! 
---
It was definitely fake.
---
It's not fake *because* it's on twitch. I didn't say that and that's your mistake for thinking I did. It is obviously a fake and gay publicity stunt. Remember when all of Reddit hated A Friend? He sold out to advertisers and didn't disclose that we was being paid to promote content. He took bids from bad parties.
---
Now it's "oh, poor A Friend, they spilled all of the negatives of their sexual history on a live broadcast! This poor guy really got ruined by this crazy bitch girlfriend".
---
Open ya fuckin eyes and realize when you're being sold something.
---
That’s the moment he found out Runescape addiction ineed does exist.
---
The big reason the war against T Series and the whole ”sub to pewds” thing is so big, is because no one wants to see a corporation as nr. 1 youtuber. It brought the community together, gave other youtubers a chance to get more subs if they helped out. It was a fun run. I might be biased, but it does help Pewdiepie that he’s super humble and down to earth 
---
It will be fine pretty sure twitch keeps the vods privately just in case something like this happens.
---
That still requires the 10% cost to make it tradeable
---
say it with me
---
DEADBEAT DAD CLAP
---

---
This is why I subscribed using their website instead of using Google Play. Google takes 30% of the subscription. I'd rather that money go directly to Jagex to support the childhood game I love.
---
Does anyone know how many new players stayed after mobile released?
---
Thats not what the video is showing. Hydra dealt a 40 on his 40 hp, but he healed 1 hp just in time to stay alive. 
---
Yep, closest thing to free points there is :P
---
But to answer your original question, blowpiping in that gear is probably fine for brutal blacks. But it'll be quite a slow task. Just head to [Slieve](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slieve) and get it done super quick
---
Not 99
---
*fake disaster
---
Go back every day or 2nd day to get 100% it drops 1% a day
---
Half of 99 is 92. Quick maffs 
---
One could only wish I love this thing. Even if it’s only for looks I would be pleased lol. 
---
Crypto refers the way the currency is created, not that's it's just digital money. RS good has monetary value, buts it's not created through "mining" an algorithm.

I understand people are skeptical about things on the internet being fake, but this is the same person who kicked everyone out of his CC the moment his power hungry girlfriend started causing issues in it. It’s almost like everyone has this glorious image of Dovy in their minds and forget that he’s actually a dunce more often than not.
---
They're already going to add an indicator for the hespori.
---
Does anyone know what the ability symbol on the map signifies? Is there going to be a new rooftop course? If so, what level req?
---
Or filter out ones you don’t have the reqs for
---
Well you left the good life to out enjoy the drama
---
Pog? 
---
Unless it was a team of friends, I'd imagine the others were actually pissed at you. We're you even useful in the raid with those stats and gear?
---
Is this achievable via runelite plugin?
---
We want a name!
---
You make the bin chicken look so good. As opposed to what it actually looks like. I've got my herron in my bank 
---
I agree the gauntlet should be dungeneering for osrs. It shouldn't be a skill but a raid so to say that is more laid back and more about using all the skills to overcome challenges.
---
You say that like almost every single recent content pill hasn't passed
---
Im just realizing i legit just did this 
---
Btw this is lovely! Fantastic style
---
.00005% of the time it works every time 😎
---
Can confirm, blocked out everything except my run energy once and got hacked by 4 different people then one of them cane to my house and robbed me and another had sex with my dad

You can have your ahk script only work when rs is focused too, rs also will censor your password ingame

Why u heff 2 be mad?
---
I play both and I like both. Remember most RS3 player also played the game before it took a shit. I played since classic...
---
At least we shield you from all the MXT. Have some respect please.
---
i think its fine tbh, running through the cave isnt too bad. maybe a little shortcut in the caves would be nice though, like linking the staircase segment to the other side of the wall
---
He fears no God but God fears him.
---
Did you forget to stand up for the 2 minutes of hate?
---
So is the money rolling in or what
---
Ohhh ok, I thought it was purely based on HP!
---
I will never feel bad for people who walk away from the game and lose their drop.
---
Think this is the first positive comment i ever made in this usually cringy sub. 
---
Signed.  Wheres the gofundme so we can even offer to pay for the development so they have no excuse?
---
Stick with konar if you want gp.
---
I feel personally attacked with that last build...
---
I got my first zenyte on 15 btw but not a btw
---
Looks like a good way to break ribs
---
Depends on how badly you need the gp, if you're like &lt;70 Slayer and need GP right away, just do Konar, but it's considered better to use Nieve if you can cannon/burst tasks so you can get to the better tasks like Brutal Blacks, Wyverns, Nechrayaels, and Gargoyles faster.
---
Good call, ruby bolts(e) shredded him.
---
I'm not sure you know what random means. 
---
Sit kid
---
where'd you get a coconut? 
---
its fine until we get dung with choatics
---
Thanks for the detailed reply mate. I’m keen to practice now 
---
no
---
He didn't realize he was gonna hit his 99 and it happened at a time that wasn't pre set. The time was random. You're retarded. 
---
incels always gunna side with other incels tbh
---
It affects mains though. The runs get longer but you still get the same amount of profit due to the seed prices adjusting.
---
I just wish the store was updated with more products and made more available for US customers :/
---
They migrate
---
Not mine
---
Needs to be audible by other players as well.
---
And 19k viewers learned first hand via quality free content.
---
What do u mean exactly by Duradel is too far? Even without Karamja gloves 3 u could always tele to Ardy, take the ship to brimhaven and pay the cart to shilo; its still pretty fast to get there imo. 
---
&gt; Yeah, and overt bribery is.
---
Actually it isn't. It's very illegal to bribe a politician. Which is why gun businesses donate to Republican Candidates and democrats that are pro gun instead of giving money to AOC. 
---
Alright, I hate all these AFriend posts clogging up this sub but this meme actually made me laugh a lot. I don't even watch streams 
---
Like the dragon, Arduin.

---
Yeah, it's supposed to be a wall, presumably for protection, so even if it's really hard to do, I'd imagine they would sing the shit out of the crystals and make that thing solid.
---
It is pretty good stats for the cost and BiS Crush for the Cape Slot. I don't think it needs to be better than that. If any cape needed a buff, I'd say Legends since it doesn't give anything unique and it is just a budget defence cape, but since Mythical is kinda a successor I think that is fine.

Depending on your definition of Terrorism there could be the child rape gangs that went on for a decade because the police didn't want to be called racist for stopping them as being unable to track terrorists.

There would be no devaluation.
---
The exact same amount would be used as you'd need to make them to fill the eternal ring or necklace. It just makes it into one storing all the charges instead of multiple rings.
---
They'd all be destroyed when adding to the ring.
---
Now do a raid with those battleaxes
---
i mean he made agillity courses he has to be satanic
---
Make sure you only guzzle the rock cake to 51 BEFORE you drink an overload.
---
It’s your health man. And you need overloads on. Use a rock cake to get to 51 hp. Then pop a overlord to take you to 1hp *thats where the full effect of Dharoks takes place being that it increases damage to the amount of health you have lost. But it only really is good if your are over 90hp. Below that and you will see a significant loss of exp a hour using the method. Without overloads and just using full health you aren’t using the dharok set effect at all. 
---
Wait hold up, serious question. Instead of just using arclight specs over and over and over on Corp, could you just use these spells do do the weakening method without BGS/DWH/Arclight?
---
I liked when chris archie pk with it and called korasi tamakashi or whatever. 
---
Artists already do this.  Just as long as you don't call it official Jagex art, you're fine.
---
We need more in game references to monty python. I approve. 
---
He's probably using something like OBS with a small window capture over his HP and Prayer, then the position is moved for the stream inside of OBS's preview screen. So unless you're recording or streaming, you might not be able to do it. (I'm happy to be proved wrong though)
---
I can see his hairy sack from here
---
Title reminded me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUpKaG9qtWo) song
---
There’s only so much my heart could take....
---
You can use super combats over overloads if you dont want to worry about 50hping
---
Would it be worthwhile to invest in an Obsidian set for the 10% Strength bonus? Or should my current Main setup do fine?
---
Id say the biggest obstacle would be a dong in the arse.
---
You could tell he didn't want to put effort in on the game. He'd only ever go for new content or the usual drop of ironman content for that bunch of content he did over 3 times prior. He even openly stated a few times that all he wanted to do was afk, no one gave a second thought to any of this and then when he flipped the new advertiser token everyone jumped ship.
---
wait..you want the eternal ring to crumble to dust if you forget to add more charges?
---
I definitely hit bugs with it pretty frequently. Very rarely I get the one you're talking about where the whole side panel bugs out. More often I get ones where the cursor automatically highlights entire textfields every time I try to type making it impossible to type more than a character or sometimes not being able to update the notes tab at all. Only fix I've found is restarting the client which sucks.
---
Then you know how to get it all back, and subsequent times around the block it gets faster, the more you know. Who plays mainscape now anyway?
---
ah good to know! I didn't even know it could fail, thanks for the tip :)
---
It's not a trap

Probably
---
Some of the elves in Tirannwn (especially Lletya) are walking around without any shoes or socks on and since they're going to add a new elf quest &amp; Prifddinas with bunch of new content, I'd figure it would be great to have this option come from Prifddinas.

You get one chance to kill Jad.  If you win, you get 25k extra Slayer exp and finish the task, and if you die then the task is cancelled and you get no bonus exp.  It doesn't break your task streak if you die.

This kind of inequality terrifies him because he is uniquely positioned to experience it.

Just like people of color have a much different kind of inequality to worry about.

It's very telling how you continue to trivialize peoples feelings. It's fine to have your little power fantasy, but we're not obligated to care about it. Nor are we inclined to engage in, or acknowledge it.

From the US, when youve lived with someone for a long time, you have to give them a reasonable amount of time to find alternative living arrangements. Here in Oklahoma, that usually means 30 days, depending on circumstances.

Also, you can be super pissed at someone, despise them, what have you, and still have enough humanity to not want to throw them onto the streets with nowhere to go.

---
I just keep using my bones so they get nothing and I get a free trip back to the bank lmao
---
I did not think of that. That makes me concerned and wonder how Jagex knows if someone hijacks an account. 
---
I still remain confident though because Jagex should hopefully see the logs of IPs and see that whatever IP was being utilized when I was hijacked was shortlived. 
---
I am not very well knowledgeable on VPNs but afaik it gives you one unique ip address. If someone uses a VPN that ip address will never change and over time Jagex should be able to see that IP address as the rightful owners. For me being hijacked it could not have been more than a week or two is my guess (All my other accounts were compromised recently) that a new "suspect" IP address was unrightfully tapping into my account. 
---
Really doesn't matter.

Uhmmm got it, probably I will buy a win 10 laptop over all a better choice

You missed the best part: if you follow someone, they gallop as well.

I thought he moved to netherlands to draft dodge. 
---
I did this quest yesterday with a candle. 
---
You will need a tinderbox on you as well, and some food to be safe. When you cross the stream on the way to Juna you can fall in the water, which puts the candle out, and can kill you if you can't relight it 
---
If you haven’t yet bought and you wanna play osrs then deffo don’t go chrome book I had to buy another win10 laptop after I learnt the hard way 😁 good luck 
---
Probably not his child which makes it funny.

No, you.

Definitely true, and I'd advise everyone who's switching jobs (who doesn't absolutely hate their jobs), to go in and be upfront about salary expectations.

Hiring is an expensive process, so you save everyone time if you tell them up front. They can stop the interview process if the figure is out of their range.

you can enable authenticator by going to runescape's home page and logging in and going to account settings. There should be instructions there for iOS and android.

I think what many players would like to see is a grand entrance for the city, something as imposing as the giant crystal door that should currently be there.
---
While the wood + crystal would look fantastic for some buildings inside the city, a giant solid crystal entrance really gives the city a powerful image. But in the end, Mod Ghost has proven himself very capable so we'll see how it turns out.

Thanks :) as a player of both it would be great to have merch that represents both. Skill cape hoodies as an example.

That’s where the “in theory” part comes into play... Jagex would need to rewrite the game

Yeah hahaha! how about this 
---
Why don't you research the game mechanics on agility so that you would realize you don't need to wear that at the moment considering also if you wait til you can afford full graceful it would motivate you more and you would of postponed making yourself look like a total jackass in that attire I mean come on you look like a pussy 
---
If its your first time, I'd recommend getting 75 range for a blowpipe. 
---
Where's this guy get he water? From the well, actually. 
---
How about you finally get REAL customer support? The fact that these posts need to be made to actually contact a real person at Jagex is absolutely ridiculous. I honestly do not understand how an MMO of this size has such horrendous support. This is the one thing that you guys just absolutely drop the fucking ball on and there seems to be zero acknowledgement on it. Address this shit. Why is there no email/support ticket system? If its team size why hasent the team been increased? This MMO has more players than so many F2P ones yet they have better support than you. Are we ever going to get answers or get a working support system that isnt social media and a shitty KDB?
---
You can do it at those stats with a rcb, but its highly recommended to get 75 range and buy a blowpipe for it. You can sell the blowpipe back when you're done.

Bring 10 black chins
---
When the healers spawn just equip your chins and attack Jad, dont even worry about singling out healers. The AoE damage will aggro all the healers, then you can go back to your main weapon and finish jad
---
Never do more than one action between prayer flicks and its easy. You fuck yourself over when you try to do too much between flicks. No rush

Turns out it’s blue and looks like a lobster.

are you sure about that?

Unfortunately not, I had to make a Amazon.uk account. Luckily with the currency conversion the gear I had planned on buying ended up being significantly cheaper even with international shipping 
---
I don't need bait ask your sister I already got her hooked on my profile

only reason u want to is because u can't do it as is now. if pvp was disabled. no1 would bothered besides chins for xp rates. everything else would be devalued to dead content

Reasonably high level account here. I'll tell you that I never worry about my account getting hacked. Most posts you see in this sub about hijacked account usually involve user error. Something like account sharing or using the same password for every account on every site or whatever. As long as you use a burner email for only rs, have a unique password, 2fa everything and stay away from phishing links or account sharing you should be OK. 
---
Blah blah blah blah blah you're obviously just a negative jerk I can do whatever I want in that game better than anyone nobody has as pr3cise and speedy clicks as me while keeping the mouse light and smooth nobody it's time to remove PvP in all worlds besides PvP worlds 
---
Solo or i'm voting no.
---
you can craft and enchant amulets in f2p
---
If the Gauntlet gets a good reception then surely there will be more content that combines different aspects of the game. Skilling/combat/PVP, and perhaps even NPC allies. 
---
Now imagine content where you have to spend gold to hire NPCs or mercenaries to defeat it. You can train these allies with a separate leveling system unique and give them commands on the battlefield. There could be new weapons, gear, and food to equip these NPCs with. Possibly even a new Commander/Tactician skill. 
---
Or just Sailing and you hire different combat/support NPCs to take certain voyages... infinite possibilities. 
---
You use them for a bunch of the reanimate spells.
---
Oh yeah, I agree! No real complaint from me, but I definitely turned it into an ongoing joke. My only real bother from it all was the fact that Jagex was paying content creators such as Cr1tikal and CallMeKevin to promote Old School Mobile between my announcement and now. They clearly could’ve gotten this done sooner but chose to prioritize advertisement over competition payouts.
---
From a business standpoint I totally get it, but I hope it’s understandable as to why it kind of rubbed me the wrong way.

Lower level tasks are gonna be pretty rare. But if you get hellhounds or black demons or something you'll certainly get a few kills per, or a dragons task. Which Btw i didnt mention the obvious pvm but dragons are also great money. Tbh green dragons in the wild, they are relatively safe just tele if you see a pker. I think the east dragons are better if I read correctly - bring a looting bag and you'll be able to haul back 100k+ every trip. Which isnt bad tbh.

Yeah all the bots and their dam steel pickaxe smithing

I play RuneScape, warframe, D&amp;D, shadowrun, and mtg. All of them require a lot of googling (RS items, Warframe builds/guides, MTG cards, shadowrun weapons/augmentations, D&amp;D classes, spell lists, and stat blocks) and every time I look up anything I invariably type the wrong shit.
---
Update:  i got my cape!!!
---
The only thing is for the achievement tele’s to compete with most of these is for them to be elite for infinite tele and its way more practical to obtain either of those items than go for elites same thing would go for the shield
---
But i do like the idea of the shield having a tele i think the only way they would do it is to change the tele on the skills necklace to tele you directly into the mining guild and the shield to take you into mlm
---
not wrong
---
Lmao nice troll
---
theres already a black lobster and now you want a blue one??
---
Is elysian worth it for a rune dragon alt?
---
Well youre melee oriented so id say lance, but I dont know the fight so well and it may be better to just go for rigour and get range up? Then do vorkath or zulrah/continue raiding. At least i always see people say vorkath is the go to money maker lol. 
---
getting hacked for an account which you secure well is not really a thing. every single account should have an email which they use exclusively for rs and never anything else. that email should have authenticator as well. makes you pretty much bulletproof.
---
DHCB is much faster and also makes the boss braindead easy to do efficiently. Only concern I'd have is the items price being fucky. 
---
I have the tank body, but no legs to wear with a fighter torso. :')

Just don't randomly fall for the random crap to make the solo content somehow group content and you have my yes vote

Just made my first IM and haven't done much of any research on how to start out yet. What are the MUST DO short-term goals at the beginning of every Iron Man? 
---
What? You make no sense bottomless compost went from 1 use to storing 10000 uses... the exact same concept with the ring...
---
The reason I say charges over infinite use so it doesn't effect the cost or production of duel rings.
---
And the eternal ring won't be a obserd price..

Herbs runs and slayer until you can get mid-high 80's combat stats for bossing.

Is this legit or scams?

There’s a post on the actual rs forums. They’ll roll your exp back. Someone else might be able to forward you directly to it.
---
POG
---
&gt; Has anyone done the math yet in regards to her overall gp/hr when including hydra? 
---
IDK about overall gp/hr but I know for sure it's worse than boss slayer with other masters because you can't choose to do tasks like Vorkath, Cerberus, and Kree'Arra like you can with the other masters and you get stuck with really slow tasks that you have to do sometimes which drags down your overall GP/hr by a lot.
---
Down to 8m wow
---
Since I do herbs runs, I prefer to avoid herb farming contracts. I start with a medium contract and then switch to an easier contract if I have to plant an herb. The last 4-5 times I’ve done this though, I get another herb contract anyway, so does anyone know if the patch chosen for the contract stays the same on the reroll? Or am I just getting unlucky?

Go play rs3, theres no pay to win here in osrs. Everyone strongly opposes paying real would cash to have an advantage on osrs. They don't want it to end up like rs3.
---
Nah fuk u. Competition prizes shouldn't be announced if they're not ready to go. 
---
Yeah, Raids are such good GP/hr that rushing for raids requirements is definitely the best way of "getting rich quick" IMO, the only issue I'd worry about is how much PvM experience you'd be entering Raids with and the gear you're in making it even harder to learn.
---
Its a good beginner set that gives a bonus and is easy to switch gear and you can take more supply with you.
---
Do people that don't PK really play with sound?
---
In-game all you see is a name, on Reddit you have a whole history of comments that could potentially contain information that put you account at risk, think pwned email addresses or answers to recovery questions
---
I almost lost my whip like this, luckly I saw it on the ground, but I was so panicked when it happened.
---
I was doing this then I realized it's profit to make pizza
---
If you want to get your range or mage up anyway. I spend some money on chinning or bursting so you get some really easy hp lvls. This would increase your dps in Dharoks a lot and it would make obtaining a fire cape a lot easier. 
---
This actually made me lmao
---
how do you pay 9 for membership?
---
Do you have an Instagram? Would love to see more!
---
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to get at is like max gp/hr for both of them, which would amount to random konar shit + hydra vs. all kinds of boss stuff from Duradel as mentioned.  I think the consensus is that you're correct but I'd sure like to see the real numbers if anyone has worked them out somewhere.
---
Useless.

I think you'll find that it's PvMers &amp; skillers who are doing that to PvP. Luckily Jagex is going to address this issue soon so this won't happen for much longer.

Ah right, that's what you meant.

That extradition, not deportation. Deportation only works if you can’t come back - it’s done by immediately denying your visa applications. However if you are in the Schengen(in which both the Netherlands, Lithuania and every country inbetween them is) area there is no sure way to not make you come back, because there are no visa checkpoints.

Your comment here is what I'm referring to, where you express your feelings and complain about how you're bothered/took it personally:
---
&gt; Oh yeah, I agree! No real complaint from me, but I definitely turned it into an ongoing joke. My only real bother from it all was the fact that Jagex was paying content creators such as Cr1tikal and CallMeKevin to promote Old School Mobile between my announcement and now.

The big point is no one can define hate speech, speaking an unpopular opinion could be justified as hate speech by a majority when it’s not. It’s a tax for allowing free speech but it’s a sacrifice many of us are willing to accept. Imo shit crosses the line when you are “calling for action”, for example saying I hate (insert any ethnicity here) is fucked but part of the sacrifice for total free speech, saying I hate (insert ethnicity) and wish people would hurt them should be punished though

Awesome. Fuck all the salty boys this is actually pretty cool.
---
it really depends if you arent actively trying to improve yourself you will never reach that level, but in general after you start working in one language you can reach that point in 2-5 years, take note that you need to constantly study to stay at that level, as the libraries change so fast that its hard to keep up. I know alot of my friends who couldnt cross that line and decided to move towards IT administration, if you are junior level dev and cant keep up, in the long run its better to move towards hardware administration, it pays more than junior level programming and is less stressfull
---
Scared the fuck out of me at 2am
---
Nope. Just covering all my bases.
---
I wanna keep my def as is though. Which items are better you think?
---
Nice you got the Chompy Chick, how long did it take?

Makes no sense whatsoever. Jesus, this community is stupid.

If you are trying to give him the blurberry drink and he drinks the ales instead, maybe try dropping the ales first? That’s the only thing I could think of. You wouldn’t even be able to give him a drink at all if you messed up at a prior part. 
---
Is that a bin chicken?

Source?
---
This is my favorite art style to come out of this sub
---
Your best bet would probably be to ask around Raids cc or whatever that Ironman raiding chat is, or look around wdr for some people. Not sure about any organised groups though.
---
I got it too but I dont know why/how...
---
Is this how it works in Europe? For example Saying “personally I hate (insert ethnicity)” wouldn’t be prosecuted but saying that and adding we should do something about it would be?  Haven’t looked that far into it honestly
---
Gargoyle is definitely the most afk and doesn’t really require much banking. But I’m pretty sure wyverns will get you more money but requires banking
---
I don't know if this subreddit is the best place to be making judgements about lameness. A nostalgia-boner video game is kind of the definition of lame.
---
That outfit is some next level kinky 
---
At least it makes sense not to know how Ardy is pronounced. Nothing like those heathens who can't pronounce Scimitar correctly. While we're at it everyone says Elysian wrong too. 
---
Use the runes requires on it 
---
Makes me feel better about the 40k of magic logs i forgot
---
wow! thanks for sharing
---
Fax
---
Aim to do a level of RC, then spend some time on other skills then do another level on RC.
---
I couldn’t stand mining and the thought of getting 68 for DS2 killed me. Doing my route above meant I never really did mining long enough at once to resent it.
---
Another method would be to never spend more than half of your time online each day on runecrafting OR only get one level per day OR get 100K RC xp (whichever comes first). 
---
Imagine polling ACCESS to a BANK locked behind a GRANDMASTER quest. WOw WhAt WerE tHeY tHinKiNg?!?!?!
---
Ohhhh
---
Here's some fun ideas
---
 https://i.redd.it/5ea81i2jvq021.jpg
---
Use it on the Grand Tree too
---
But I've already done 70 laps in the seers, can't I have a break?
---
I use it but what’s this specific option called?
---
thanks guys! first pet ever lol
---
Currently lvl 65 at seers. Please end my life.
---
&gt;Just out of curiosity, what do you think the average age players are? How old are you? When do you feel like you'll be "too old" for runescape? Are you scared of waking up in your early 30s one day and after thousands of hours only having a 2b bank and a few capes to show for it? I'm probably reading too far into this. Just having a shitty internal crisis I guess. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks
---
No, I'm afraid of waking up in my early 30s to not having enough money to support myself or not being happy in the field of work I've chosen. Jesus christ, there's more to life than RuneScape.
---
There is no "too old" in life. But you definitely sound like you're obsessing too much and need a break.
---
Bad bot
---
Looks like some kind of chimney...
---
I hope many OSRS nerds learn a lesson from this.
---
It's never worth it. 
---
What D and prayer? I only have my overheads and 40 D. And only like a 4 mil bank.
---
When you wanted Jordans but get Shaqs 
---
I kept a “legacy” master clue scroll in my bank from the beginning of my account until I completed it. It was a good driving force for finishing quests and other requirements. It’ll be worth it.
---
Would also kinda need what your mage gear is looking like
---
1 nature rune 3 fire
---
woah now, if its not your kid and your SO is extremely toxic in your life you leave that alone completely. If it was his kid thats another story but none of this is his problem. Its the guy who knocked her up's problem. Come on now.
---
Sit kids
---
Honestly, it's probably because skilling doesnt actually make money.
---
His slayer level isn't quite high enough to start making tons of money from that, so he wouldn't be able to know about that really.
---
Tenga egg
---
haha honestly that made me laugh
---
Yeah, your gear is the only thing that needs the most comment. 90 mage is pretty decent for him.
---
Thank you so much for the reply! I guess I'll expect some guidance from you. I've also tweeted JagexSupport so hopefully something happens....Hopefully I hear something back as well. I've tweeted Mod Ash but he redirected me to the support team....Please let me know who to tweet as well. Thanks!
---
You can always buy pizza bases from the bandit camp in the Wilderness.
---
She SHOULD get an abortion, but she probably wont because she seems like a serial liar. I get you're probably pro life but this is exactly why abortions are a thing...to stop this from escalating.
---
I think there is a chance but it’s super rare. 
---
If it’s in the game but it’s super rare and no one got it yet, how are we supposed to know it is in the game?
---
I know for a fact the legendary black lobster is in the game
---
What level stats are you sitting sat?
---
low combat hit high
---
Once you get 70 Slayer, you can get Kurasks. They are like 1m+ per task. Then 75 for Gargoyles is like 2m+ per task. This is slayerscape and one of the best ways to make gold is by just doing slayer forever.
---
Alternatively, you could go for 99 WC. Magic logs in the Woodcutting guild are really good money. Redwoods at 90+ will be better xp, but less gold.
---
You’re literally replying to a bot
---
You know jamflex has the money to improve it. Jerkmeoffx is just being stingy and won't do anything. Honestly scares me that I could have 2fa on my account and email have a bank pin and authentication code and jarlflux can just reset my account for some random person like they did for my friend. (He had max range gear on including a tbow.) 
---
Holy shit I'm dead xDD
---
Still there?
---
Why not chaos alter?
---
When this happens to me I just click a whole bunch and it eventually stops happening. Hope it helps for you too!
---
The points system is in ToB too, just hidden for whatever reason
---
This is a good one hahaha
---
Also summoning with pak yaks that let you bank from anywhere.
---
Yeah and most of the game was a pvp free for all. Zezima talks about training on the Lumbridge goblins when he first started for a hilariously long time.
---
ray williams is dat u???
---
Ya I low key feel like troll
---
75 thieve (or whatever a gem stall requires) isn't too bad of a req, I'd say go for it. But when you get some of the really high req ones, no shame in dropping. I drop probably 75% of my master clues after getting terrible Sherlock tasks
---
Be aware though - master clues are not automatically crazy loot. Seems to be an average of 300k for me
---
Playing game properly doesnt mean that you istantly forge huge stack of gold
---
This guy has probably done quests and hard diarys asap, grinded some untrable gearpieces and gotten decent stats while at it
---
I do
---
Congrats but fk you :)
---
I’m 31 played since 03 my bank is 800m and almost base 90’s. I just chill in my CC and play at my own pace man. It’s a good escape from reality. 
---
Everything on the internet is fake, got it.

Make it like the big shark so it's mountable in a PoH

I totally agree but when the streamer went to check it out there were so many people there

I’ve been wanting to give it a try but I’m unsure. Visually it does look cool.

Looks like the wall placed closest to you was pasted first then the other wall was pasted on top of it and they didn’t think to fix it.

Hey i did some pre blowpipe/trident /whip tob on my iron and i felt like i wasn't properly carrying my weight at maiden and nylos. What's your experience without these items 
---
Keep it up bro, solid content can't wait to see whats next &lt;3 
---
I used to argue with the gnome at the first agility course. Good times
---
Just stop dude. The white knights will never be able to accept the truth.

he comes back in 10 minutes all 'i was banking!'

Reminds me of the South Park World of Warcraft episode where they grind on level 2 boars for weeks
---
You are tearing me aparat Zulrah!
---
Just flip do herb runs and train slayer like everyone else 
---
Just gotta hit 75 attack and I'll be guilty of doing this once in a while
---
thanks bro!
---
People who say void is trash are dumb. It’s marginally worse than bandos arma ancestral setup. At most bandos arma saves you like 20-25 seconds per raid. Yeah, its that mininal. Void is obviously not meta but its not far off. 
---
I still remember gypsy moth being the hardest to beat.
---
Swap ur rs3 cash and start raiding. U can easily make 500m-1b per month raiding. 
---
There is, but fully automated bots discard it or is left in their inventory since it's untradeable.

Including the recent transfer ban also
---
Yum not yuck

You got phished

By the way how is your sex life?

It's on the top next to water.

Crystal pouches! They degrade just like normal pouches. But they're crystal
---
The 10m rise was around the mobile release, the dagger was stable around 6.5-7m for a few months before that.
---
More like 600k an hour probs 700+ in max gear.
---
just have another clue scroll reward drop that lowers poh load time
---
It's also the only skill that you're effectively using all of the time no matter what you're doing
---
Where is the proof it's even his kid?
---
The Jorge is clearly just using him for his YouTube money and has admitted to cheating. Dude fuck her. 
---
I honestly think they wanted to give more xp but the community seemed nervous about it being meta like wintertodt a few months ago
---
No, Mod Ash replied to someone saying sgs will work on kurask and turoth, but not Guthans.
---
honestly i didnt have to read anything other than 70 slayer and kurasks. 
---
Yeah, that's why I wanna afk the training. I'm not really a harcore player and play around 2 hours a day. Most of the times I will watch something or play another game at the same time. Of course with doing Vorkath or other bosses I won't be able to do that but that wouldn't bother me because I would get money to show for it. But I'm not really statisfied with intensive clicking training for an hour or 2 just to get 200k xp or so, so for training I like the afk methods more, even if they are slower(not too slow of course).
---
Have you seen a waffle that’s blue? Just as cool
---
Has happened to me before haha
---
The thing that annoys me the most is that unless you have lumby elites or a music cape, you need a dramen staff to use the fairy ring to go to McGrubor's Wood. And you can't take that to entrana. You can just go to Entrana last and bank the staff in cwars before you go but it's still an extra hurdle to do mid farm-run
---
Defo do seers. Probably not enough marks but even just grace legs and body are great.
---
Also I think u can't boost for Sara, but I'm not sure about that 
---
Read it as JEw slaughter and was debating whether op left it in intentionally
---
I'm 22 with a bank of like 20M at most. I'm mostly playing to reach some childhood goals. Already got some stuff like first 99 so thats great. Want to finish Recipe for disaster, go for base 50s and get a fire cape next. Its fun to just set small-medium goals for yourself instead of only focussing on the endgame stuff.
---
Any chance for the discord info, im 1 def 78 str 93 rng 95 magic

Well he just had to survive some rooms to be able to get loot
---
Id setup a gargoyle alt and let it train up to 90's or higher at gargoyles, once youve made some good mpney and want an even better alt, you can do dragon slayer 2 and monkey madness 2 to make a rune drag alt. Rune drag alts are arguably the best alt in the game, making over 2m/hr at very low intensity.

nice account

No i don't really think brought accounts is to true either.

Just hacking is probably true large amounts of people fall for it.

Priff will pass, I have 0 doubts.

99 Magic Skillcape does it too.
---
Selling gf €35ea
---
I had about 70 marks when I started seers at lvl 60. Got full graceful just before hitting 70 and I even had the medium diary bonus. Think I was super unlucky tho... 
---
62 from questing and lamping? Yeah, no.
---
It's top quality content though. Look at it from his pov, he's in that abusive relationship for how long now.. 3-6 months? Imagine that dumb biatch, nagging you for every little thing there is. Liking your own family member photos. Not liking USB color asking to throw it away. Throwing away your custom table your father made for you cuz youre actually tall asf. At some point he runs out of ways to even doubt himself and starts questioning why.  This was honestly the best move. He brings it all to light why he's fallen from grace in our eyes and now theres a good chance well get our old a friend back. What he did is exactly what abusers dont want... all of it going public lol. So if anyone is in a similar situation and youre trying to justify it somehow... just stop doing that and leave.
---
He wasn't but whatever helps you sleep at night. They're both horrible people in their own right.
---
never
---
Nope, try a different game friend.
---
  
---
neopets?
---
I feel this. Been like this with games for almost 15 years.. I don’t mind people knowing but I hate adding friends because they see my time played. I hide when I’m playing in shame oof
---
I’ll take that, thank you.
---
100% support, i never wear shoes irl and i want my rs character to reflect that
---
Want to be my rs gf?
---
They don't even know what streaming is nevermind twitch vods
---
I believe they use some kind of alt code between each letter. I think it was 0151? 
---
Yes, you will have to provide your full name. You are allowed to cencor the social security number but everything else has to be visible. Better give as much info as possible, because back and forth discussion can take ages on these matters. 
---
lol, mate. ofcourse i can only speak for for ps4 for honor, but shit is toxic as fuck. will **figuratively** give you cancer.
---
Gauntlet really going to be solo just because TOB is in the game? It's an MMO it needs content for groups of people to do together and not just solo bosses and challenges imo. I know they said they'd be open for more group stuff in the future but I dont get why they insist on making solo content? Two of the most consistently profitable activities are solo bosses and the only thing you can really do with your friends is raids or gwd, and we all know those dry gwd trips suck
---
Wonderful
---
I just did this quest last night and slightly wishing i actually red dialogues and didn't do them at full blast with netfix or music on
---
Wait habbo hotel in 2015 wife wtf? Do adults keep that game going?

Depends on your banking method and stats. 
---
Thank you kind sir. I appreciate the words.

Wait, what happened? I'm out of the loop.

Start swiping. Lower your standards first time if you have to and work your way up brother

A simple google search would let you know that's not true.

---
I was doing Revs when Sparc Mac came up attempting to DH bomb me. I had a Craws Bow which is why I ran, wasn’t sure what the hell was going on.
---
Hi
---
Alright so I see what you mean. The core game wont ever have increased xp, but you still have few options:
---
1. Unrestricted worlds. You can spawn your items and go maxpk instantly. These will be shutdown in like 3 weeks so go play while you still can.
---
2. Permanant deadman mode. There is a server where you will have something like 5x xp rates(Not 100%), but the world is all PvP. Permanant worlds will not get reset like seasonals do.
---
3. Seasonal deadman mode. These do get reset after every season but they do have faster xp rates. 
---
all ironmen should be able to solo ToB dude, didnt you know?
---
when you create your account it says "if you cant solo ToB, this isnt for you" 
---
That's cause 200m is $150 lol.
---
Please instead of the herb patch a spade that harvests herbs and allotments faster? Even with spam clicking it takes very long for allotments.
---
He’s not saying he spent 10 years failing the fire capes you numpty....

Anyone know why baskets of Apples are dropping so much? They were like 2k the other day and now you can get them for 1k .
---
Fixed :) 
---
Isn't that technically rape? He didn't consent to unprotected sex etc
---
Imagine you get that in DMM
---
RS3 quest system is amazing in this aspect, it filters out ones you have done and filters ones that are recommended/can complete.
---
You can add to that we will be getting huge map expansion also. Not just the priff but areas behind and around it might potentially have something.
---
I am Maxed and I do not need xp anymore, so Im really hyped to see content with more reasons than big xp rates. 
---
If nobody would buy gold, those woodcutting bots wouldn't exist
---
This is what happens when thurgo doesn’t get her raspberry pie.
---
Potentially:
---
If people were training Farming to get into Farming Guild, the price started spiking so people could train quicker. Now that a lot of people have gotten levels/stopped going for it, the price is dropping.
---
It's also important to note that it's crossed the 30 day average, so it's likely to drop further/have sustained negativity.
---
Nice repost.
---
I actually like this idea, double the run energy or triple it in bars + also give it a double health restoration boost.

Thoughts on brothels in Old School? I, and many other players, lack female companionship and this would fill a huge hole in the community. I'm sure that it would be a great gold-sink (brothel tax) and an excellent early-game moneymaker for new players with an imagination and obliging personality.

Camulet outside temple makes that trip so much better if you're iron or not interested in POH.

Some of them know, i remember seeing one video where dude went unconscious and later when medics arrived, they turned the camera to down. 
---
I create different goals or do shit like a few games of castle wars, few games of pest control, maybe throw on some cheap gear and supplies and deep wildly just to lose it. Do a marathon of bosses. Fish one of ever fish. Maybe just run around the world examining stuff
---
Uhhh- he ended up getting every single account banned for the way he “made money”. Promoting a bullshit gambling site isn’t respectful at all to your audience that 1.) supported you 2.) trusted you. There are appropriate ways to go about sponsorships, and scamming your viewers isn’t one of them.
---
Hahaha, DAE like OSRS moar than RS3 like myself and have to compare everything?!1?
---
🤔
---
i thought its a friend story in this photo
---
He is an adult.
---
Sure he is naive, but he is also in full control of his life choices.
---
A friend made shit choices before the "E-thot" was visibly in the picture, he made shit choices in moving to the netherlands with her.
---
I don't think people should just 180 on their opinion of him just because he willingly walked into a toxic relationship.
---
Are there any ideas to adding new prayer unlocks to the elf quest? (Like a significantly nerfed Soul-split and a new Retribution prayer that does more damage and in a bigger area + skill based prayers?)

If you purchase the 12 months it comes out as 1 payment.

Think were ever getting another chapter of Berserk ? :(
---
wtf is this?
---
100% increase in run restore for free, *and* it's f2p lol. Graceful only gives 30% and it requires a massive grind.
---
The usual (relatively low-effort) response to this question is to play the main RS game instead of Old School.
---
Have you tried RS? It's still a relative grind, but (imo) less painfully noticeable compared to OSRS.
---
Keeping the stream on was a smart move so that he has video evidence that she can't delete.

Can you at least give us an update on what's going on with the clan chat system kicking you out and making you unable to rejoin cc every 3 worlds you hop?

Hey man. You're already thinking about your future instead of ignoring it. If RuneScape is what is satisfying to you right now, then go for that shit. Remember to take care of yourself and those important to you. Be happy just getting gainz
---
Are the proposed Death Mechanics still in development? 
---
1 extra slayer lvl and camp kurasks
---
could also do mory hard and camp barrows, but kurasks are literally afk
---
Gz, alch urself
---
2nd jmod to max in osrs. 
---
Yea ok lol
---
Except it doesn’t. OSRS is not even 7 years old.  
---
Also, RS3 bad.  
---
Also, grow up and let people play whatever the fuck they want without your self proclaimed authoritarian bullshit. Fuck off.  
---
Yes, I’m mad. 
---
You can get 60 agility fairly quickly without much of a hassle.

Also he didn't say he was a new player. He said he was new to ironman mode.

This is a good suggestion, thanks BallsDicks

tried to find it on google and all i found was women "falsely" talking about getting raped and pregnant :/
---
I’m 200 dry at barrows with no fire cape or barrows gloves wtf :(
---
made 900€ in btc because i was curious when the GAMBLING SPONSOR drama came out. who cares what kind of sponsor a content creator has you only have to watch it for max 10 seconds. also how did he scam viewers? if youre that stupid to give your RS gp to a streamer which probably has more than enough gp and means to get them you're just stupid and i have no simpathy for those that got "scammed" by a friend. btw not defending him, never liked him, just wondering
---
That feeling when you don’t have enough IRL self esteem points to skip making fun of people their appearances. 
---
If you can sell 15b for $50000 you can flip for one day and retire 
---
I meant in that osrs is based off a game from 2007, so older than 7 years 
---
Also, I agree.
---
Also, you’re telling me to grow up but you are the one that’s getting mad over a meme, so..grow up
---
Go to become a member on oldschool.runescape.com and you should see premier club somewhere then it is the 12month option 
---
It should have a link to the comment you added the tag on.
---
Thanks boss
---
The joke travelled galaxies over your head

You can kill baby black dragons in taverley dungeon. Extremely fast task. :)

Just get 83 construction?

it doesn't end there

Ah didn't know that one, thought you'd only get a cabbage if you died in every single room

I’m not getting mad over 1 meme. I’m getting mad constant memes from children telling people the games they enjoy to play are bad. 
---
Smoothly sliding into those DMs.
---
No
---
There's no way someone would rather random run / attack crabs instead of just afk. If you ahve more than 4 accounts, its even worse.... You would need to have 2 brain cells only..

Weekly repost
---
It's not white knighting. Invading your personal space and having cardboard thrown at you doesn't justify punching, smacking, or slapping someone. Not to mention that he went after her AFTER she left, so he voluntarily put himself back into the situation after she had removed herself from it. He should have called the police, he didn't, he lost his temper and turned himself into the bad guy in the situation.
---
She got a different pie tho... pretty sure Dovy wishes he gave her raspberry.
---
He did this to himself. It was painfully obvious this bitch was fucked in the head (i.e. clan chat drama). He chose to think with his dick and he paid the price.
---
thats why you spam 1's in the chat and spamclick the ground waiting for "items" to apear.
---
This meme has never suggested games that people enjoy are bad.
---
My title, ‘applies more to osrs’ isn’t a dig at rs3 like at all, i simply said it applies to osrs more because osrs is an older game technically... that’s it!
---
And I totally agree on the fact that people should be able to play whichever game without being ridiculed for it
---
I believe objects get a z order or viewing order assigned to them. I would suppose the back of the other wall has a higher z order than the front of that wall
---
That's band name...
---
Can someone link this for me? Im behind in the news 
---
Go for 88-89, that's fine as well, just that it's whatever extra experience you want on top. You can go straight for 99 if you want.
---
Whip + DDefender is the fastest training (for a reasonable price) for Attack and Defense, whilst Bludgeon is best for Strength. If you're training in NMZ, then use Full Obsidian with Obsidian Sword.

At least sell..
---
No, you retard. Having a piece of cardboard tossed at you and it gently hitting you does not justify hitting someone. The law certainly doesn't agree with you. And she had left after she threw it, he went after her, any justification for self defence is lost then.  
---
People like you are so transparent, just so god damn eager to hit someone because you're weak little men that no one respects and you just can't wait to show someone how tough you are. It's like being in high school all over again, but somehow even more pathetic.

You're correct about it being "pretty trivial" that it's only 900gp roughly, however currently some players might have completed the quest (like me) at an awkward time and hence not have the ability to ever reach 100%. 
---
I collect once a month, which according to your 900gp calculation means I lose 25k profit a month just because I completed the quest at the "wrong time". As opposed to a player that completed it around 5am, whereby they will always have the opportunity to make it 100%.
---
I'm bothered about when it resets because it wasn't explained at the time of quest completion that the "take time" would be dictated at the time I complete the quest.
---
I like everything to be ordered and squared away, so it is a pain to me. And if it's easy to fix, why not?
---
If it's a pain to fix, don't bother- you're right. But I would like to hear them discuss it.

I love the whole post except 1 thing, the tools, I think it should not be better then the dragon items. It should be slightly weaker then (at least )a dragon pickaxe because it is a good thing for people who pk. the 1/4 chance should be like 1/7 chance so it's slightly weaker then a dragon pickaxe. Since you can obtain everything else outside wilderness I guess it is not a problem

Also the shit that the community hated him for (whether warranted or not) has zero to do with it. "We got out boy back" like what? Since when was he the sweet prince.

Sounds like you're absolving the mother of accountability too much. Keeping the stream on and doing it there meant he had evidence to defend himself against her fictitious claim of violence, he played it smart. She was happy to roast him on stream but as soon as he pointed out her various faults she just put on the water works and claimed bullying. He did well.

I'm almost 75 mage been using Iban Staff with Occult for Barrows and Dag Rex it's pretty good so far. However, I always see people recommend Trident for these but it scales with magic level. Would it be better at 75 than Iban or not? Seems more expensive and not worth it until 80+
---
Imagine projecting this badly.

&gt;I'm a weak coward who wants to prove how tough I am through violence, therefore that's why every violent person is violent.

I had the same shot happen last night, got into rev caves and saw stacks of food and potions, didn’t think they’d be around.  Boy was I wrong, I got facefucked trying to kill revs in a matter of seconds.
---
Defeats the point of the clue step. The difficulty is meant to be traversing the cave and for many perhaps forgetting witchwood icon and getting smashed to bits
---
If you think so much is wrong with the game.. maybe don't play it? Idk just a thought

It's not hard to imagine that the only reason he sold out was because he desperately needed money for the kid and to move to the Netherlands.

My first 99 (ranged) I stopped 4xp short to save for a party. The next day, I log on and go to do some non-ranged Slayer, and get nechs. Without even realizing it, I chucked an iron knife to start stacking them. I wasn't even looking at the screen  :( the only reason I put two and two together was I noticed I wasn't getting ranged xp drops anymore (runelite bug, fixed on relog). 
---
F

I still ended up having a party, but it felt kinda hollow :/

If you have it set up and it decays he will give it back no matter what, if you have it in your inventory and lose it he won't give it back.

I mean we’re “chill” in the sense that we’re not actively anti-English and we don’t cause shit for English people living in Wales (although we will take the piss out of them). In my experience with the English, Northeners are basically the same as the Welsh, more down to Earth and a bit rough around the edges but Southerners just seem to exist in a perpetual state of misery and have to be grumpy fuckers about everything they encounter.
---
Welsh people who know their history generally feel some resentment towards England but rarely does it extend to English people themselves. Most Welsh people are generally indifferent to England provided we have our identity, I think this is helped by the fact that violent conflicts between the Welsh and English last happened hundreds of years ago, whereas for ROI and NI its all in very recent memory so people are likely to have much stronger opinions.

Elite diaries?

It could grip it by the husk!

True that. I would suggest making the shield untradable, it makes sense because then it falls in line with other quest items such as the myths cape

Most people in Wales are fairly English friendly as you say, and any jibing is usually not serious, they just take the piss because they grow up around it. In the same way as the English and their sheep references.

Can you gives us a devblog on what updates you have in the backlog?
---
It feels like every other week theres a great suggestion on the Q&amp;A that the community likes, that you write down as possible in the future, but then we dont hear anything about them for months.
---
Would be nice to see where we are and maybe it could be combined with a small priority poll which suggestions to work on first?

Yes precisely although I have met a few Southerners who can’t handle the banter.

They ignored the context of the video to frame it as him "breaking the law". In the video he clearly states it is a fucking joke on his girlfriend and even says he thinks nazis are the worst possible thing. Any sane person would be able to tell that it is a joke. Court of law ignored the context to make him an example to control speech.

this literally implies the opposite, that you CAN play a game for as long as you want as long as you enjoy it you diddy donut

You can control the mouse with the keyboard but unfortunately, you would need to overwrite my Arduino program with another one for the mouse.

As I just got 99 smithing I’m probably going to bounce between making rune stuff and doing seers agility training while alching stuff, in between blood rune runs... it’ll be a long skill to work on but it’ll be be super profitable. So the monotony won’t be so intense.

Crabs are the only npc people can realistically train their stats on until you can actually start doing slayer after you get to 70s or 80s in meele stats.
---
Crabs are literally designed to be training spots (multi, 2-4 spawns next to eachother, lvl1 in all stats except HP). Other NPCs are generally just inferior in every way.
---
Right when I thought this sub couldn’t get any better

2) yeah but somethings have gone under the radar and is considered qol, prayer switcher is bannable but other 3rd party scripts can be made and not known to the public.

3) there is 0 risk invovled back in the day there was a slight chance you would die
---
4) not particularly true but i see where your coming from  
---
5) buyable imps was introduced into the game even rs3 doesn't have it, why should the price of high level foods 20hp-22hp be dramatically affected in price when 16hp foods are worse and harder to obtain o wait its because drop tables are mainly addressed with "ironman content", i only suggested things what they can do to help pvp and have more people try it out.

After royal trouble I would put your extra workers on teaks/mahogany till you have banked whatever level you want, 82/83 most likely.

I appealed a botting ban on my normie account, account was reviewed and they were satisfied that my account was compromised and I got my account back within 2 days. Was pleasantly surprised as I was expecting it to be gone forever. 
---
Would be good if they had an email that was monitored that you could contact them on, I agree it's not great to have to rely on upvotes to get a reply, but the automated system has worked in my experience even though my appeal didn't technically fit the criteria.
---
Ok so why would you expect people to respect or care about him anymore then? Because he made some terrible decisions with a goblin we suddenly should come back? It’s also not a very smart choice to destroy your only way of getting a decent income when you’re uneducated and have no skills.
---
If there only was people nice enough on Reddit as there is in-game.Sad

At least you have rng 😂😂

It is a **Rare Drop** table. The drop itself is rare, it has nothing to do with its value. There is nothing inherently wrong with it.

---
&gt;Can lucky Implings be updated to only a roll on the unique drop table of all 4 tiers of clues instead of giving anything a clue scroll can give?	
---
&gt;Yeah, I think they need an improvement for how rare they are. Stripping the non-unique stuff off the list seems to be a fairly popular approach. We could manage that and it seems to have popular player support.
---
Can we see this implemented?

Agility definitely needs a buff. It's a horrible skill that has unbalanced shortcuts.

I really like most of what’s in the blog, but I’m a little bit disappointed that none of the rewards scale with agility. I feel like the elven lands have always been associated with content that scales to your agility level (Underground Pass, falling into traps in the forest, the stepping stone for Zulrah). 
---
I’d like to see the armor and tools (and possibly weapons if they were to be introduced) become progressively better with agility level. 
---
The set effect for the crystal armor seems really bland, I’d propose changing it to something like the full set gives a small chance to cause a successful hit from an enemy to roll a zero with the effect scaling dramatically to high agility levels. Just one possible change, I’m open to other ideas.
---
...no. We should never, ever have prayers that block more than one style. Maybe 5-10% at like 99 prayer, but even that is just no.

If you think bossing with anyone besides a maxed main is leeching your retarded. And you don’t get rewards if you don’t do enough DPS, so yeah it does matter how they work lmao

1 Skele, 2 Bloodworms and 1 rat gets you to the optimal 88.0% from what I remember. It may also be 1 bloodworm and 2 rats instead, but 88.0% is best as 88.1% gives you a drop chance of bolt racks which drops the average value from what I've been told.

Honestly, just record using OBS. Use a movie editor to bring the file down to what you need. Reddit can convert a mp4 to a gif.
---
well... updates such as "qol" have made the game easier for example clicking if you compare boaty to the average player you cannot click as fast. Look at banking for an example you had to have fast right clicking and know the position to take out pure essence for runecrafting but now you can just left click it and all the essence is in your inventory meaning everyone can technically get the same exp per hour.

Yeah it actually made runecrafting bearable, There are still mechanics that require skill. Qol on banking is only a good thing.

Yup. Some of the replies in this thread are concerning.

Idk I heard from everyone it was optimal to do waterfall quest and then sandcrabs until 60 in your melee combat stats so I did it. I'm new to the game and it only took a week or so of sandcrabs to hit combat level 70 so it seems pretty good to me.

OR. OR. OR. You go to the fucking pub, drink a beer, and don't go anywhere near her until you get her ass out. Streaming your argument where you demean your baby momma, no matter how trash she is, makes you just as trashy.
---
Some things are private, some things are public. In this case he isn't even a man because he has to use his nerd fanbase to doxx and insult his baby momma to completely ruin the relationship.
---
You say whatever you want but Adults don't livestream their trashy break ups to their rabid Runescape fanbase who then threatens her. Which I wholeheartedly believe people threatened her life because people online have even less remorse then Dovy has. Just look at how they post on this subreddit, now imagine what they are saying to her dm's in twitter or in an e-mail.
---
If she's this much of a scum sucker he needs to cleanly and quietly remove her from his life, not have this fiasco. It makes him look even less mature and garner's less sympathy from me then if he manned up and did it properly.
---
This should be allowed. Clever use of game mechanics exploiting total dumbass noobs.

They deserve each other. They shoulda just headed it off at the start and made it an open relationship 😂

Normally it's the gold that gives it away. But with swamplethics gold is expected. This one got me good

I get to the blood altar through the abyss actually using a glory to get to edgville then stop at the bank to swap glories and deposits blood runes. By the time I reach the wilderness my skull disappears and I just go back to blood altar and mine more dense essence... I like that method.

support but only if when you have the items stored they show up as "ring of dueling" and not the item that they are, and they have to remain slightly misaligned from one another to trigger people with OCD

Yeah i noticed. Can't find the delete option anywhere tho.

99 defense, bird houses, wood cut, cannonballs (3 minutes activity), guess you dont want to do mining, afk slayer, barbarian fishing, those are my options. gl

Doing anything takes development time.

The community did band together and try to help him when the relationship was beginning. The problem is when someone tries to help you, and can you tell them all to fuck off, they wont keep trying to help you.

Really wish this would be implemented

imo the gap is closing between mechanics that require skill skilling wise but some of the updates in recent times have made the game easier.

For sara you can try to attack her from different sides and have the person she's focusing run away. She'll turn around to another person eventually if she doesn't hit you, but if she hits you you need to keep running. Very annoying boss to kill imo, but if you do it well you won't take any damage.

God, reddit is a fucking cesspool of whiteknights even for the most fucking evil women. Imagine you're a bit of a socially awkward guy, you dodged the military just to play runescape more than 12 hours a day and made a job of it, you got your first girlfriend, got baby trapped, what do they expect? He just made a dumb fucking mistake, panicked about the well being of his first relationship and his KID, and took every necessary precaution, even if it meant his entire online livelihood. No matter how I look at it, a friend is the most noble guy in this situation despite every mean thing he said about the bitch. TIL reddit cares more about respecting all wamen and the quality of their free youtube content than the sanity of one poor guy and his desperation to provide for his kid that his insane girlfriend forced upon him. fuck.

I have done 99 fishing, woodcutting, and runecrafting (from 77) all afk at work on mobile. fletching and cooking could also be done very easily or afk combat training

You're trying to provoke me into revealing my stats!! Scammer!!! :"D anyway ty
---
Gotcha. I really miss the aspect of using actual essence and being rewarded for fast banking. All the time you spend mining doesn't really feel like RC to me. It's definitely nice when I can only afk though.
---
Ok thanks for the advice. I'm a bit new to posting gifs
---
Sand crabs are afk and low defense which is the highest appeal.  Fire cape is pretty irrelevant, you can do the 4 crab spot until around high 80 melee stats (and always with moth darts), so that's the main reason.  After that, they can typically go to ammonite crabs which have more hp, but not all of them have unlocked it

I laughed so hard at this I got a headache. I wish I could give you gold. Let me hit you up in an hour or so see if I can get enough money to get you some gold. You deserve it.

In a past Q&amp;A Ferocious glove recolor options were discussed as a treasure trail reward. Instead of having them come from treasure trails why not add them to the brimstone chest drop table to add more incentive for Konar tasks since she is the only one that assigns the monster that drops the recolor item.

lol  my little bro has the same build man   hes 21 now  and has been working on it since he was 19     almost has a fucking quest cape   high 90's in str  a ton of dairy's done,  has every single void and fighter piece from barb assault  is worried his 50 runecrafting is too low  yet has not went into wildy one time to pk    but hes a Berserker.    you guys gotta get out there lol   he has it built up in his head that everyone out there is maxed and will slaughter him if hes not maxed  with maxed non combats hahahah and 45 def

The time it takes to hop to 330, go to host, and then hop again because 330 is laggy as hell. Versus just straight up teleporting to my own house on any world I want and bam done. Very worth it.
---
That's basically what jad is. Once you do it, it just clicks, and you can do it easily from then on.
---
Took me 5-6 tries back in 2010 or whatever, and once it died, I was like "Ohhhh that's easy". Still panic while doing the caves, but it just makes sense now so there is no more issues.

Yes yes yes

So any reason to vote no on any of these?

Yeah ofc abyss isnt afk. Doing it by running to the altar is chill as you can click super far away and most of your time is mining the essence anyway...
---
&gt; 99 mage is less than half the cost of 83 con as well
---
What? Humor me, do the math here please.
---
I remember jagex saying something along the lines of if the lure is clever enough, and you're dumb enough to fall for it, it's just smart gameplay not scamming lmao

Funny idea, but damn is that thing ever ugly.

But look at the cost of the spells, Ice spells cost less, while dealing more damage.

I'm still in a f2p account, and I have a week long membership trial. I'm wondering with my levels, what's the easiest/ most efficient way to grind for a bond within that time. Or should I hold off on using the trial until I reach a certain level? Any advice is appreciated, thanks!
---
You've just gotta find some funkier trees to cut, then
---
Cause knowledge is power!
---
Buy membership. It kills me to see that you've played that much while stuck in f2p. It really doesn't even feel like playing RS if you don't have membership

Before I got 99 smithing I made it known to my cc that RC would be my third 99 after mining and smithing. 
---
Getting to 77 was brutal enough, and while I’m just at 80 now, I’m aware it’s a bit irrational to call it my third when it’s not even 90 yet. 
---
But 99 RC is something I have been pushing for for a long time, so this is just motivating me a bit more.
---
Apparently Dovydas spent 35 euros to get 3 hookers and some weed. Now I am not sure 35 euros would be enough for that, but that's how much was mentioned on stream so it became a meme.

Lets say you want 82 con. A reasonable goal 
---
This will cost you 30m give or take 
---
Lets say you make a more than reasonable 1m/hr doing whatever. 
---
It takes 15 seconds to hop to 330, get into host house, then hop back. I measured.
---
Youd need to make upwards of 7200 trips to a host house to equal out to the profit you could have made by being "more efficient". This increases exponentially with increased con levels.
---
And thats not even factoring in the time spent to get those con levels. 
---
Its honestly a waste.

Agreed, hosting brings end game content to every level of player so long as they have the other requirements. That being said some people don't play the game for the game, they play if for max xp and/or gp per hr.

I mean that's exactly what happened. Like I said you people might need to go rewatch the video again but she was clearly abusing him after repeated attempts made by him to de escalate the situation. She threw like 6 different things at him, and was punching his computer monitor and shit. Being a streamer that is literally like destroying someone's tools for work. He was defending himself and his personal property from a persistent aggressor and I'm sorry you think women levitate above the rest of us or some shit but nothing will happen to him. In fact SHE might be the one walking away with assault and battery and domestic abuse charges.

With a Level 70 Construction house location being added to Prif, can a 60 Construction house be added somewhere else on the map to fill the gap between it and Yanille's 50? Maybe in Slepe, Weiss, or Arceuus, or a private island near Fossil Island?
---
Not gonna lie, this made me laugh and smile in a genuine way. good job reddit stranger for making another stranger smile
---
I don't see an issue. The rewards are a separate poll anyway and we know there is a Second Poll with more Prif content coming after the main poll. Whether they polled the armor and the minigame in the same poll or in separate polls, it doesn't make it any more likely to pass or fail; it just makes it more rushed.
---
Bingo.

I hate these words because I hate questing but I love them because at least I'll be 1 step closer to RFD complete.

How about adding a tax when buying/selling from the grand exchange. Example: when you buy a item for 100M, the grand exchange taxes you x amount lets say 1% of the offer. 
---
Wave completion time = total time spent actually killing each boss.
---
Total completion time = all boss times plus the time running to each next room, spent buying stuff from chests, in Verzik room before starting her, etc.
---
But it's something that is permanent and you get more than just the altar with 83 
---
It can be dangerous to do it this way but this is how they did raids 1 and 2. They won't release something without drops, so if it fails they continually repoll the rewards until its something people like.
---
If you'll recall raids 1 originally had 4 sets of armor. Ancestral, mage tank gear, range dps gear, and melee attack based gear (instead of strength). But only ancestral passed after like 2-3 polls.
---
i’ve never had to touch my altar since they added the 5x per day thing tho 
---
&gt; Training agility means your run energy depletes slower, which is very helpful.
---
Well, it makes it come back faster but it doesn't explicitly make it go down faster, unless you mean Graceful dropping your weight below 0kg but I feel like you touched on that in your second sentence separately.
---
Yeah there aren't many worlds in f2p that aren't botted or full up with people telegrabbing zammy wines. But I'll look into windertodt thanks
---
gotta make 35 euros somehow amirite

Can somebody link me to a source video of the A Friend drama?

Do you ever feel guilty for making a judgement without looking up the facts? I posted on two separate comments saying the credit was all Winged Souls on YouTube, where he ASKED someone to post it on Reddit. Maybe dig a little deeper next time, or actually just dig at all.

But did you see the Jmods comment,Just do it man its only 45 seconds.You will get full infinity + zgs btw did you see the Jmods comment?

Go ahead and bust out the math then bud, id love to see you justify your position without strawmans or hand waiving.

U can build that occult altar with 82 construction too.
---
I would recommend luring jad to a safespot to every single person learning. That's how I did it easily with base 50s, and I never even had to tank a single healer. 
---
Just because lots of people do it everyday doesn't mean you should. Looking at any situation from a third person is always easier but the situation he put himself in with terrible decision followed by the next he just set himself up for a distaster that he may or may not beable to reasonably recover from it.
---
I gave one 100k yesterday and it said I won but never paid up. So at least the og host ones are a scam

Did you have 94 magic? I wanna try this with some friends but only one of us has barrage atm.

Don’t understand that

Not really how that works son.

---
Is there any plans to buff the idea of using magic in pvm as a whole? Very few bosses have magic as a viable strategy and I would like to use magic against more monsters and bosses
---
Go ahead, do the math and prove me wrong. Ill wait.

Ah yes the Trump method
---
Im already 99 slayer, just want the social aspect

It can, but often doesn't. Your hearing about a few extreme cases you hear about in the media that get blown out of proportion.

Nerf g maul
---
There's no way to police it so you are correct there
---
No, justiciar has the damage soak effect, better melee defense and does not degrade.
---
the magic bonus for the Justiciar should be lowered imo. It has a -10 extra penalty for no reason.
---
Maybe the crystal armour could have some negative magic/range attack bonus to be consistent with the shield but the defensive bonuses are fine. Crystal gear is suppose to be high range def mediocre melee defense.
---
Finally, Inferno will get progressively easier anyway with new updates.
---
Actually fair enough point.
---
If you're happy to spend the time interviewing, then you're definitely right there.

Although best in mind some are gonna flat out refuse you even after spending the time. But the overall chance of getting the higher salary is probably improved.

In order to like the game, playing it form the start or somewhere in the era of where it began plays a huge roll in how much time you like spending on it in general (or so to my belief)
---
Most people in the game nowadays are well above their 20's or in that region; though obviously starting later means that there's more for you to learn since more things are added to the game
---
I've seen the OG ones try pulling the "dummy account" scams. There is an account called OG Host89 that will log in under each of the OG dice bots after some time. 
---
Idk if he is actually affiliated with the accounts, or if he stakes them out and waits for a crowd to form, then logs in under them. Scamming 100k doesn't make much sense on one of those bots doesn't make much sense,

Huge support! Maybe make a guilded theme as like the rarest drop from masters or something. Would be pretty awesome to have a gold house

You know I’ve actually been thinking about this. It’s probably going to end up as a cape item but it really should be in the ammo slot. If it’s in the anno slot it opens up the crystal bow to be REALLY good, as it deserves to be.
---
So then that begs the question of is it morally wrong if a lot of people do it, and I’m sure plenty more would if they were simply given the chance. I wouldn’t say his decisions were terrible at all. They’re terrible for us because his content went down the shitter and we get less of it, but he gets more money, and that’s what matters to him. I doubt dovy gives a flying fuck about RS and it’s community, it’s a job, and a jobs purpose is to produce income.
---
I don't particularly care about A Friend's gambling crap he did or the way he gave donated gp from fans to scammers or even when he got his accounts banned. I DO care about A Friend thinking all these things are totally acceptable if he had a shitty gf at the time and his fans use that as an excuse to be like "hurr durr that explains it, he was simply being MIND CONTROLLED the whole time by a woman."  Come on guys, this ain't Enakhra's Lament!

---
Honestly, I think it would be pretty cool for it to go on the back.  Ava's passive is worthless on crystal bow, but you'd still be forced to use it since it's bis.  It also allows it to have ranged stats and bonuses, without allowing blowpipe to abuse it.  It would significantly increase the cost of blowpipe if they wanted to use quiver.  If it goes in the ammo slot, which thematically makes sense, it limits the design of the stats and ranged bonuses (either no stats, or only crystal bow bonuses).  Backpack gives the devs more freedom without worrying about breaking blowpipe.

Grats on 99 slayer my man
---
I mean you really have to have it first man. You can hate on everyone but if you really want to do a lil math friend. 15 seconds, I use my house portal for basically everything so at least 15 times a day that I play. That's 3 minutes and 45 seconds. Now I'll be honest I play nearly everyday but lets use a more casual example and say 4 days a week. That's now 15 minutes of a week. That totals to 13 hours a year spent going from your house, finding a host, then typing said host. Now lets just take an easy skill say cooking which with grapes is 500k xp/hr, so that time totals to 6.5m exp, basically half the total exp needed for 99. And this is for a casual player, not one that plays everyday (22 hours and 45 minutes) which would add up to around 97. So the cost of 82 construction is the time to almost get 99 cooking within 1 year.

Agreed. But the community likes it when everything is made easier for them so they won’t have to take any risks. They just hate the wilderness in general and pking 
---
Unique accounts that have only have 99 slayer or something like that. Restricting the ways people can build their skills is just unnecessary if you ask me

All the video credit belongs to Winged Souls on YouTube. He has a website with contact info, I’m sure he’d be fine with it but I’d ask.
---
It would increase Crystal bow damage and have a chance to not use a charge.
---
It is definitely possible. While getting untrimmed slayer on my HCIM (btw), I made a calculator to help determine if it's still possible for your account to get to 99 untrimmed and how many cannonballs it will take.
---
It's the third calculator on my spreadsheet if you're interested:

Is there any reason why the level requirement to vote remains so low? With the issues of recent passed polls being game breaking and having to be removed, it raises the question if players have game integrity in mind when they vote. Perhaps raising the level to vote to 1250 or 1500 would give players who actively play a voice, and make it so players who don’t still don’t have a high threshold to reach. 
---
Wait, hosts get money for that?! Is that why so many people just stand around hosting for hours?
---
I made my password ‘pollresults’, as you can imagine Jagex failed to hide that as well.
---
Understandable. LMK if you're out of bank space and you need someone to hold it for you. I also offer trimming packages starting a 19.99M if interested. 
---
I'm pretty gay, but that doesn't change the fact that if you actually play osrs and don't realize how similar this game is to the progression of rs3, then you're daft.

Something is extremely off with those tax numbers if you're getting taxed 200k on your first win (2m), = 10%...
---
Ah I see. Yea i dont think its currently possible to get a bunch of recoils and stay 3 cb. With 4 cb it should be possible.
---
Obviously I eventually need to do everything. I'm asking which unlocks are essential to grab first. 
---
You can barrage abby demons. Not all that easily due to overcrowding i guess but still.
---
Really good suggestions
---
No offense but in the time you spent getting that spare change from ankous you could’ve been improving your account. Questing, getting your stats up, working on barrows gloves. There are things that come as a high priority in this game. decent-level stats and barrows gloves would be wayyyy more beneficial to your account than doing ankous, and wayyy more beneficial than bandos or a torso, which only give small str bonuses. unless you can only play afk for some reason, and even then, there are far better afk money making methods. Basically what You should keep in mind on this game is everything takes a long time. The more time you waste doing pointless things like killing ankou for money is exponentially worse for your time because you could be using the time to progress and unlock far better money makers. One kill of vorkath or a few kills of zulrah is like what you make in an entire hour of ankous. A lot of this game is just common sense! 
---
How many are you killing per hour? Abbys should be a lot better than that.
---
But it is a bit silly; more so that they made Kurasks and Gargs so consistent. But the point of Abbys is going for the big rare drop and I'd say the whip and rarer chance of dagger still does make them worthwhile. Also, if you want more profit on task you can kill Sire.
---
You need it, but for now, obsidian armour is best bc it has str bonus
---
Stop making every requirement lvl 70. Almost everything in this game is unlocked at lvl 70. It’s almost like once you’re lvl 70 and do a few quests you have BIS everything. Jagex needs to start focusing on lv 80 gear; skilling equipment and combat equipment alike.

Damn that's not many hits. Would full crystal armor have a chance to be bis at arma?

One of the trolls upstairs notes it for you, so do that and run back to mine more.
---
Cool, what are you trying to say here exactly? 
---
I love the idea, but I don't think it should come from clues

You realize almost all gambling is "rigged"

No I didn’t I barely played the account, my main that I play on the same computer wasn’t touched

A Friend got a gf around a year ago (she's monstrously ugly btw) and she systematically lured him for his virginity, ruined his CC and made him block all of his platonic female friends. He started selling out because of this, stopped making good content and actually impregnated this escaped hobgoblin and moved to Netherlands with her. It all went nuclear on stream the other day with a multi hour long argument. She falsely accused him of physical abuse after he bragged about fucking 3 Netherlands whores for 35 euro, cops were called on stream. He is now moving back to motherland Lithuania and leaving his demon seed to nest within the womb of Thurgo
---
&gt; Dude how are you actually trying to twist the words enough that a direct quote from the official wiki isn't enough to convince you
---
You linked the definition to scamming, and it specifically says nothing about luring which is completely different than regular scams. Jagex knows about luring, and have known about it forever, theyd explicitly put luring in the context by now if it was something that was bannable. Hence why, no is EVER banned for luring unless people are doing it by abusing a bug.
---
Some may look at it as scummy or frowned upon but, and some make define it as "scamming" but the only thing that matters in the context youre talking about is if Jagex thinks it falls under their Scamming rule and according to them, it does not which is backed up by the complete lack of bans for it. Regardless of what YOU personally see it as, Jagex clearly views it as something different than the usual scamming and therefore never bans people for it, its only looked down upon. Its pretty much that simple my dude, if what you were trying to infer from the wiki was actually true then it would be prosecuted just the same and as often scammers are under the Scamming rule, but it isnt.
---
Anyway, for this specific lure to even work the person being lured HAS to acknowledge the fact they are about to be teleported into the Wilderness by the warning that comes up and because of that warning in place and the person having to accept that risk, Jagex will never ban for it they will say its unfortunate but the blame is on the player and they have to be more careful.

Can you lower Callisto's +900 magic def to make mage a viable way to kill him, as was originally intended

I am not whining I am just genuinely curious as how could of it have happened

May as well

Oh fuck that’s funny my bad you’re not a cocksucker

People are mad?  I didn't know anyone's mad at him.

I open snuggle quests guides because she plays out all the requirements in a good format. Then I use slayermusiq's guide for the actual quest because I like how he tells me which chat options to pick.
---
imo you should have stayed 60 attack but might as well get 65 since you’re 61
---
I bet you voted yes to buffing seers rings
---
the woman is far worse IMO. I don't know how you can look at someone who said "I lied about being on the pill and got pregnant so atleast I'd have something from the relationship if we broke up" and completely dominated his life.
---
He bought a house for her to live in with him, buys her expensive shit when she asks like a 700 euro phone and didn't cheat on her in the relationship.
---
Wel consider this your daily reminder

I have bitrate set at 6000 atm, what would you recommend it to be set as?

Dude I read my comment after I posted it and realized how bullshit it sounded lmao

Taking their time though. I would get jiggleyx some leniency though because they aren't nearly as big of a company as something like Blizzard/Activision

You'll know when you do, because you'll set boundaries and communicate.

More like 16m if you do oak stuff instead of mahog tables. Then the altar is really only expensive because of the Sceptre

What are your stats. How the hell did you finish ToB with a cb lvl 95? I’m in awe!

How bruh I never go on YouTube or twitch 
---
I see u when I brain fresh

Damn lol you ended up looking like a dumbass in the end, if the whip drop rate stays the same but the overall gp/hr is increased then more people will do them meaning more whips coming into the game.

Yes please.

B0aty, sparc mac and woox, will all be common "I'm quitting" phish links.

Are you kiddin me, OP delete this shit.
---
Isnt it like 20m extra for the altar?
---
If I remember right, every shard gives 100 charges per piece. In an hour you get 50~ shards, but you may be able to earn them while profiting or such so hard to say how much of a time sink it will be.
---
Anyway, depending on where you are, you will get hit more or less. Like at DKs or GWD there is a lot of things hitting you while at Vorkath, it is just the one thing. Not sure if Crystal Armor would be BiS at Arma; I forget its attacks styles and not sure how Crystal Bow would compare to stronger weapons. It would probably be weaker than Chinning for sure and losing the shield may be a bigger loss than the added Defence of Crystal. Also, with the boss and 3 minions, you're armor would degrade fast.
---
I’m out of the loop, can you please explain me this?
---
For me if it gets to the point where my gf is like damn you’ve been playing all day I kinda go yeah maybe I should take a break.  he handled it like shit honestly. Taunting her with this 35$ for 20 minute was him tying to anger her so he got what he wanted lol, I woulda turned that stream off so fast 
---
There's 2 groups. Those of us that played in 2005 and were 11, and those that are 11 and starting now because of mobile.

&gt; Nah, he's immature and stupid for impregnating a girl - birth control takes longer than two weeks to confirm if it works, even if she was taking it you wouldn't chance that.
---
what are you trying to say here? that its his fault for not requiring a blood oath from someone he was dating to tell the truth about being on birth control? how was he supposed to know before any of this shit went down like the fact that she was being manipulative and a liar well before he met her. She claimed she was a virgin so why would he be afraid of diseases? she claimed she was on the pill so why would he worry about cumming in her? he trusted her as naive as that makes him. but that doesn't change the fact if we reversed the roles and it was a man lying about having a vasectomy and she had proof he'd be charged with rape. 
---
&gt; Your issue is that he shouldn't be responsible for his actions because he's a youtuber you like.
---
no I feel like he should be responsible for the kid regardless of the fucked up shit she did to have it (if its even his). I don't think any of his actions warrant my disdain in this whole situation.I think the way he handled it was fine.

The wiki is written by people other than jagex and is incorrect. Jagex moderators have stated the rules of luring in the past.

Your concept of how much money you can make in a day flipping, and how much money you need to retire, are both very inaccurate.

I'll never understand why they made the armour stands so limiting. It's one of the coolest cosmetic house trophies and you almost never see it.

Hot but insane.

They're mostly autistic children with zero life experience sitting inside efficiently grinding xp. They'll get there eventually.
---
I wonder if Morvran will be appearing in OSRS... Probably as the Gauntlet's keeper if he does. Either way, the design looks nice. Though instead of the black metal-looking armored bits, it would probably look more like the Crystal armor even if it kept the same shape.

---
the actual definition of victim blaming
---
&gt; Victim blaming occurs when the victim of a crime or any wrongful act is held entirely or **partially at fault for the harm that befell them**. The study of victimology seeks to mitigate the perception of victims as responsible.
---
But because I like how stupid your concept of victim blaming is let me leave you an example that would also technically not be victim blaming if you spoke out against the womans actions
---
&gt; a woman slaps a man who proceeds to rape her
---
clearly the woman shouldn't of slapped him and nothing would of happened.
---
Consider using Smoke Bstaff + Tome of Fire charges instead of Trident of the Seas. It's a higher upfront cost but if you're planning to camp barrows for a while and want magic xp, it's the better option.
---
With a max hit of 36 and a very very consistent 6.5 casts/brother at 75 magic, it works out be cheaper and faster than Trident and Iban's. 6.5 casts\*4 melee bros = 3,172gp compared to Trident's 11+ casts\*4 melee bros =  3,993gp+
---
The only previous downside to bstaff was the spell select but last week's update fixed that.

You must be new here then

Probably ranged 70 just afking ankous is pretty cool and chill.

Do it. Right now.

This is ezscape that will cause slippery slope

That percentage is not the percentage of winning that stake, but the percentage of winning that stake and all preceding stakes. The method of calculating it is (0.5^n)*100% where n is the total number of stakes completed at that point.

Back in actual rs2 it was actually very bannable. It didn't become ambiguous until osrs came out. It still definitely fits under the official rule of scamming though objectively.
---
&gt;Asking/trying to persuade another player to give you their password or bank PIN for any reason is against the rules and will not be tolerated. Players must not scam or deceive other players.

&gt;An 'item scam' is an attempt to obtain GP and/or items from another player by dishonest means.

Lol 200 hours grinding zulrah, try raiding
---
you should be able to loot kills without losing hits, loot stays in the ground for a long time.
---
Gargoyles drop ~3700-4400 overall profit per kill (based on a few 10k~30k loot tabs i found on google).
---
15s per kill is 888k gp/hr (using the low end estimate, which doesnt pick up pure ess, fire runes etc). 
---
again, your profit per hour there VASTLY depends on how efficiently you attack gargs, loot and use piety. Anywhere between like 200k and 900k in raw drops per hour.

Yeah, and the fact that those 2 or 3 exist is enough to make me rant.

Can I change my dragon spear into a dragon hasta now that there is an option available? 
---
torso is overrated.
---
most people don't manage their boost pots properly anyway so one max hit from torso on avg hardly helps. you'd get more dps from just repotting properly.
---
my last suggestion for this included a "engraved with "off" on the handle"
---
Definitely get your p2p stats for barrow gloves. Its absolutely the BEST thing to get out of the way early on :) your f2p stats like others said are already high enough so thats good! You have a nice foundation going already. Id say maybe go for 70-75 range? Or at least close and then cannon the rest at dagganoths under the light house after you do horror from the deep. Its 150k-200k exp/hr and they drop good seeds + med clues. Its honestly a great way to train. Will require pray pots and some food though but it's extremely afkable. Stand by cannon and keep auto retaliate on wearing your best range gear. 
---
Blowpipe at 75 range is so good. Get a fire cape soon as you hit 75 :P or honestly 70 and use rune cbow/diamond (e), but blowpipe makes it so much easier and faster. You already got the melee stats for dragon defender too, get that done! Then torso. Once you have all your untradeables done (b gloves torso d def fire cape) you can really start grinding slayer or pvm. Tbh b gloves is the best way to start out because it not only trains some essential stats that you'll need later on, you also do some essential quests. And gets your skills to a point where its not so bad training for other quests later on. 
---
I always say this to every new member, but its just so valuable and good to have out the way. Getting your untradeables done before you start really doing pvm/slayer is miles more efficient. And since your combats are already high enough you wont need to train those right away other than 55 mage for alchs and 70+ range (and 44 pray is worth) for fire cape. Before i had my combats up to 65/65 for defenders I did some wildy slayer to train mixed with just sand crabs. Wild slayer got me clues and emblems so a little bit of money. On top of the wildy master giving most slayer points I built up a nice amount of those. 
---
Will the bonus to crystal equipment make the crystal bow more viable? Really miss seeing it. Such a cool item.

Nah, this isn't for the sake of ironmen. I think gear drops should be interesting for everyone - being forced to use the G.E. isn't fun for any type of account (imho). ANd I agree, the difference is not too great, but it's a difference. And the defence bonuses also play a role. Getting the rune c'bow requires high mage or melee stats and is pretty dangerous. I'm combat 87, and I can kill it once per inventory. Getting supplies to grind for the crossbow is not feasible for me yet, while I've had to use the bone crossbow from level 28 ranged up until 66 now, which just hurts a  bit.

I'm asking a question that doesn't affect you at all, I'm enjoying the game in it's current state (f2p) for me and I'm working towards a personal goal for a self sustaining membership without spending any money which is only positive for the game itself by being attention and having a consistent player. Hope the rest of your day isn't as negative as your comment.

L0l sit

Also if this is satire I apologize but it didn't come off as such.
---
Hey, since you didn't post it here, here's your message you sent me and my response to it :\^)
---
&gt;People like me are why dice bots exist? No buddy I don't run any dice bots, I wish I did, but I do not. I'll tell you what. To prove to your Naïve little brain how dice bots work, Go find a dice bot in game, Send me your in-game name. i'll come to you with 5m, i'll trade you over the whole stack so you can see there is nothing in my inv, and then we'll play! with a dice bot of your choosing. I'll trade you over each time and show you what the cash stack is at.
---
&gt;It would be a nice lesson for you in how gambling works, and you can see how the real world opertates.
---
Your type incentives their existence, you don't have to run it, just promote it, which you do. And nah, I'm good, enjoy your silly spending
---
Nope, just monkey nuts
---
This is really cool. I was just thinking we needed more POH themes.
---
can’t complain about getting pked in the wilderness lad.
---
Why are you asking such a dumb question?
---
It's because the size and number of the item boxes. Can't have an even layout with the banner without odd looking spacing.
---
I think he just means a normal spade that is also gold.
---
u need a lint brush friend

\*looks at slayer level\* Pitiful.
---
&gt;  revs for quick and easy cash 
---
We kill you for the quick and easy cash you just made from revs
---
because you are an easy kill. Or you could be a scout. at the very least you have a bracelet.
---
dont want to be killed? make yourself harder to kill. deep wild pvm is not a safe activity.
---
Different issues entirely. But the eternal Anglo is still involved I guess
---
Wait yo is there actually a bug? I’ve been so confused lately how my shit has been switching to attack or accurate!
---
This is the general notion that I agree with. However, dude.. if someone is risking jack shit and looks like easy bait, as a pker, wouldn’t you aire on the side of caution? 
---
Yeah it’s a joke man
---
PvPers don't give a fuck what level you are or what gear you might be wearing. 
---
It's the potential for reward. Maybe you've got a fat stack of runes or arrows or gold. People DO take ridiculous amounts of goodies with them to wildy, don't bank when they get good drops..ect. 
---
If you're skulled and they see you, GL fam. 
---
I can feel the collective energy of thousands of brainlets trying to figure out how their pked spade collection is going to top one goldy boi

I’d be down for Prifddinas to come with extremely expensive (1-10m) under-the-armor cosmetic upgrades such as shirts, pants, (no) shoes, and haircuts. Everyone who’s done the Song of Elves would be trotting around this new utopia with ridiculous fashionscape, while others were crying their way through the inevitable death maze that will be the quest - looking to reddit in envy. + issa gold sink

'Bro how was he supposed to know ejaculating into a girl would get her pregnant'
---
This is all I see from your argument. He said she told.him she took the pill for 2 weeks before they EVER met.
---
2 weeks isn't long enough to determine if the pill works, let alone whether you knew a fangirl would even take it or not.
---
Literally, just don't ejaculate into people you don't know, it's not hard.

If your not wearing a condom, your asking for your income to be sapped by a savvy fangirl.

But then you have to hop into the most aids world immagineable, sometimes nobody is hosting, and often there is a 3+s lag for every input.

Honestly, just get at least 72 so you can do all the main stuff, but seriously consider the higher levels as well.

&gt;Does MVP increase your chance at receiving the loot.

Yes, effectively. This was covered... a couple weeks back on a Q&amp;A. It works basically the same as having the most points in CoX. Higher chance, but totally possible to be passed over.

Thanks everyone, this was on my alt, I never even expected to get a pet until I just saw something following me LOL
---
You can literally do the math on this. It is a simple calculation. 
---
If you get 25 hydra kills per hour that means your expected value for a 1/1k claw is 40 hours. It's 80m. That means you're earning 1/40th of a claw per hour or 2m per hour just off claw, *on average*.
---
If you get 30 vork kills per hour that means your expected value for a 1/5k skeletal visage is 166.67 hours. It's a little under 40m. That means that you're earning 3/500ths of a skele visage per hour or 240k per hour just off skele visage, *on average*. 
---
This is simple stuff that you can explicitly calculate. That's how math works. If you cannot see how these numbers come to be then you are unqualified to be a part of this discussion. 
---
I haven't been able to build the artifact jar with dev mode enabled if it makes you feel any better. This is just compiled source running in my debugger

Ok going to try and do them on my account and don't have anti fires so trying to figure out the best way. 
---
You people warm my heart.
---
If they wanted to keep the duel arena around, they could remove betting from the duels. Just have it so that two guys fight and at the end, a local announcement is made: “Player 1 suffered a humbling defeat at the hands of Player 2!”  
---
Would definitely be the coolest way to settle arguments in game.
---
For real, this dude can still chuck another 6m
---
I agree but there needs to be more reason to get higher than 77 pray other than more prayer points. So having a 80+ tier prayer book could fill a nice void from 77-99 prayer. 
---
Late to the party, but could we see a revisit to poll thresholds for quests/minigames/lore expansion for the game?
---
I feel like linking the 75% threshold across the board is extreme. *Good* for gear, new skilling methods, and quite possibly what could be new skills imo.
---
But lore/minigames that dont direcetly affect top/mid level PvM or various PvP levels could be healthy for the game as a whole. 
---
Yes this could be harsh if content were to pass at 65% and previous content did not at 75% but thats resentment that could hold the game back. (Obviously 65% was just an example)
---
If you can't figure it out shoot me a pm, but the guide on how to compile rl on their blog works fine.
---
No, I like the new OSRS graphics in the Dungeon of Kourend and Mount Karuulm. I think low poly graphics can look really good. The style of OSRS is unique and cohesive. You can always tell when you're looking at OSRS. RS3 looks like every other generic MMO now. With a few upgrades, like Runelite's increased draw distance and anti-aliasing, it improves even more. 
---
GET OUTA MY SWAMP 
---
Nice
---
If you know how to add runelite plugins then sure. I'm gonna upload the source to github later tonight after work. 
---
is that your only concern? the rest of it looks like absolute shit too lmfao
---
looks rly good 
---
Praise Jesus my herb run shits were getting way too long
---
Was getting triggered because I thought the GIF wasn’t loading for me 
---
Can you look at buffing the Crystal Axe? As it currently sits at 15% faster than rune axe it will be less time efficient (and presumably more costly) than simply using an infernal axe. Bumping it up to 20% would make it only slightly better than infernal axe. 
---
This is assuming level 99 and max efficiency rates  with 2 tick teaks for WC and redwoods for FM but should scale down roughly the same for lower levels and methods.
---
If Agility isn’t useful then you’re probably still level 1 in it
---
I see no reason why the whole book needs to be limited to above 80. If we could have some above 80 prayers, that sounds perfectly reasonable, but building that high of a wall for players just to access this content feels really wasteful in my opinion.
---
I think I should clarify. No one cares about your contrarian political/economic ideology especially when it comes to a meme. Yes people care about discussing opinions on a forum, but when it comes to a meme like this most people don't care about certain opinions. Like no one is subbing to pewdiepie saying "I'm going to support the rich". It's mostly for fun. Cause honestly who gives a shit if he's already successful. He's a nice guy, he make entertaining content, and even better YouTube hates him and demonetizes everything he makes. I love supporting him just cause of that last part. Fuck YouTube. 
---
I think all this would be better suited for an entire Construction update instead of TT rewards. But this all looks very very good!
---
Please dont add a god damn bowstring to the crystal bow. Ever. It ruins it. Thanks. 
---

---
Future ironmen might not get too many soft clay from nechs anymore since they're not necessary anymore for herb seeds thanks to the farming guild from what I'm hearing. You can choose to kill catacombs nechs now instead for faster slayer xp and do farming contracts for seeds.
---
I think I'll probably end up making bracelets of clay myself if the soft clay rocks are close enough to the bank, regardless of whether they're efficient to make. As you said, can just AFK enchant them and 1 inventory of bracelets is worth either 650 or 1300 soft clay.
---
Yeah I can get behind not locking the whole prayerbook behind level 80. 
---
I like the idea. I really really like the name 
---
&gt; This is all I see from your argument. He said she told.him she took the pill for 2 weeks before they EVER met.
---
She did far more than lie about being being on the pill and claimed to be on it, she never gave a time period for how long she wa on the pill and she got pregnant 2-3 months into the relationship not at the very start. 
---
&gt; If your not wearing a condom, your asking for your income to be sapped by a savvy fangirl. 
---
Thank god she admitted on camera that she doesn't want any child support from him.
---
I agree wrapping it up is always better than impregnating a psychotic fangirl. But claiming the entire situation boils down to immaturity discredits the severity of what the chick did. She straight up conned him and emotionally abused him throughout his entire stay there and when she realized the relationship was over completely she tried to get him arrested on false domestic abuse claims. Not to mention the whole letting dovydas he'd never be able to see his kids again.
---
Exact same thing happened to me, made my week getting it back
---
I never said abby demons needed to be buffed. They are balanced because they have one insanely good drop and a bunch of mediocre ones. If they had other good drops, more people would kill them, and whips would saturate the market.
---
But in regards to what you said about it being OK to not have content not worth doing... No. Even if the content is decades old, it should still be 'worth doing' to some extent. Abby demons are worth doing because people need whips. Traditional firemaking is worth doing because it's the best firmaking xp in the game. Motherlode is worth doing because it's an afk mining method. Cormorant fishing is worth doing because you get the equippable rods. But when you decide that having content that isn't worth doing is just as fine, then you get Drakes...

Back in 2004 when demons and dragons looked super weird. I remember my friends and I were walking around in the wilderness in mithril armor and weaponry and the teacher (we were in some computer class) unplugged the router or something. We lost all of our riches :(

Thank you! I appreciate it, I put a fair bit of thought into it, and I'm glad you like it!

Can elite void gloves be created? Its annoying to have to remove a full set of regular void AND elite void from POH armor cases.

People are not taking much pity on his as he has done so much stupid shit as of late, that this is just the icing on the drama cake. People only care when they have a reason to and it is much easier (even if wrong) to just laugh.
---
Didn't the devs come up with a Gilded Spade idea already that you could buy for 100k gp, increased loot in the Wilderness and if they added Farming Plots to the Wilderness it would yield double loot from digging up trees or something. Always dropped on death and could be traded to the vendor for like 80k gp.

Now you and your boy both have lik ziks gg future relationships

---
Wondering myself :D
---
given op is asking this question he probably isn't prayer flicking -&gt; using prosy or barrows is almost always going to be a better choice and in the cases where neither are useful the obby plate is fine. It's not "torso vs no torso" its "torso vs obby plate", +1 str hardly increases avg dps, at best you either have a higher max hit for 60/90s or you keep your max hit for 60/90s.
---
the "camp torso always for slay" meta is for people who are 1ticking the whole time which is a really small % of the playerbase.
---
Fuck no.
---
or you could just right click/ hover over them like a normal person

from someone who struggled using karils xbow and guthans in dozens of attempts to get their first cape in 2006 where if a player error didn't end me then high ping and latency on dial up internet ended me. Lol if it is an option for you I suggest bringing in a basic 4 way mage switch and ancients. The number of uses freezes and blood spells have in the caves is infinite. Also, i know it's very popular to just camp bp but (esp for people who have never completed the caves before) I highly highly recommend bringing in either Crystal bow, Karils xbow, craw's bow, 3a bow, tbow, rcb, or even a damn ogre comp bow or magic longbow ffs. Lol there is always waves where bp's short attack distance prevents keeping a mob safe spotted while killing another. As well as agroing healers if not bringing in ancients. My first fcape attempt on osrs I just brought blowpipe and when I went to agro a healer my character had to step forward and jad 1 banged me with a melee hit. 
---
Lmfaoooooo I hate you 
---
this is probably the best one so far, never saw it coming lmfao

This area is botted a bit, usually groups of 2, occansionally identical stats. Names don't really seem that off though.

You just found that same meme format (super ez to do) and just reposted the meme too it and added your own watermark. You’re trash
---
I recommend going full herbs and half maples till you're 59 fletching (for mith grapple used in 6 achievement diaries) or if you decide to get a grapple from barbarians, get teaks or mahogany logs. Cooked food is nice too for early days if you decide to get into pickpocketing ardy knights for money. Once you get 65 slayer though ardy knights pales in comparison to slayer.
---
If you do maples you'll make about 15k (14,696) when selling the maple longbow (u)s to general stores. Little boost toward paying back daily Misc costs.
---
Easy way for ironmen to get dhide shields, especially high level ones. I'm not on board

i started playing rs3 yesterday and made 600k in literally under 5 minutes of play time from some mtx promotional chests, on the brightside the "one of us" hivemind swarmed me at the ge and gave me a trimmed fury and some ring that teleports you to the GE
---
Not bashing I think every mmo does the "one of us" thing lolol
---
You never truly achieve quest cape until RuneScape ends. 
---
This happens to me almost every play session. Very irritating

Ahh yes, cause someone who doesn't play rs who know that that means slayer, recognising something doesn't mean you know it is

Add onto that he's got one of the rarest pets in the game from one of the most hated minigames, which he apparently plays six accounts at once for, this is next level autism. Go outside bro.
---
These are all supreme suggestions. 
---
Go on shark brew (assuming you’re a pure) and join a clan and ask in their discord to practice with someone. 
---
Otherwise w2 at clan wars is popular, usually can find someone to brid.

I know you don’t want to use a p server but they can be very useful and it’s free practice. Just don’t use your RS login info and make sure you’re using a popular one .

Yes, but these are just cherrypicked items. Like, are we not allowed to have boot upgrades? What kind of line in the sand is that?

why do you care, you do the inferno once and thats it.  Oh you think your cape is special its 2019 shit ton of people have the cape and even pures now
---
yeah, context, regarding pointlessly buffing things/older content, I'm just going to copy paste my other comment since you seem confused, I also said the opposite to what you seem to be implying
---
&gt;aaand  this content was crafted 15 years ago. The Gower brothers were not  exactly game design professionals. Runescape (and many other MMO's) are  pretty content saturated. If you start going at everything with X needs  to be buffed because Y, well now we need to buff Y because of Z, well  now we need to buff Z because.... etc. Then you get poop. It is perfectly OK for some content to not be worth doing and just left to exist on its own.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**New content should have a purpose or else it would be a waste of development time.** But buffing old content *just because* leads to imbalance and inconsistencies (like the OP shows). The problem is that the community is retarded and votes yes to buffing anything.
---
Good tip I suppose that does make it easier :)

Then take a break and train something else. You bot you get banned. If botting was allowed there would be no reason to reward 99s

The Mourners inside of the of Mourner hideout basement. As a plus, they'll automatically aggro to you (assuming you aren't wearing Mourner gear for some odd reason) so the task itself is super AFK.

If you have slayer rings, they'll tp right to the basement door.

Bwa(the guy with pets) is actually a great person.

She made claims to cops that he'd hit her physically. If he hadn't of kept the stream up who knows what side cops could have taken. At least he's got evidence with the stream to say he didn't do that
---
yeah, I ended up doing the same. felt like the additional brew/restore was more worth than a switch for a tiny bit more dps

Lmao weed is *mostly* accepted in the U.S., even if its not technically legal everywhere yet, the general attitude of the public is that it is. This commenter was just an edgelord about weed and hookers and is probably just jealous he doesn't have the required capacity to get dat ass himself.

After the attack style change where it would remember old styles there was a bug that even if you were on aggressive style you would be given Def or Atk xp.

I don't think there is right now, but that would be completely doable as an option on the menu item swapper plug-in. I'm not sure if it would be allowed though, it seems kind of in line with the blackjacking plug-in that they explicitly ban in the docs.

i've known bwa for like 4 years now. the ba community is shit and not skeptical of what higher ranks say.

Why not?

this is probably a dumb question but if you’re doing pyramid plunder and you have a pharaohs sceptere in your inv does that affect the chance of u getting one as a drop?

The community had no idea how abusive she really was but everyone took a big hint after the CC craziness. Also, why should people give up after trying to help him once? Do you really think he should have trusted people on the internet for relationship advice on what seems to be his first serious relationship? You can’t always just listen to what people tell you to do, sometimes you have to do it on your own and make that mistake but at the very least your friends (or fans) should still support you even after making that mistake  except in certain situations like the gambling site. If anything his fans and friends should be accepting of his current situation and offer love and support for him, not just offer him a big fat “We told you so” because that helps nobody.
---
What? My point is that two games that are carbon copies of each other are bound to have similar progression no matter how you try to spin it. OSRS has done great job with what it's been given, more than this guy is giving it credit for. You can't call something as trivial as boot upgrades a copy

I was just there! I tried to join the circle jerk with my heron and was escorted off the property

I actually ended up being super good on supplies so I brought some dark crabs for the last fight instead so I didn't have to keep using a brew and restore

How does it work with osrs though? I can only ever get it to capture the whole desktop, not only runelite.

Alot of the clues have their niche like easy have zammy pages for bis and some wizard pieces iirc 
---
Or gamble it and see if it's real. You feeling lucky today?
---
he just messaged me again today just now but I was busy raiding so ignored it XD he hasnt given up lol
---
Yea im poor because i understand the math behind the time spent hopping against the cost of spending money and time on construction levels.
---
I really wish youd do the math instead of reee'ing and spreading misinformation.
---
If you compared the time spent hopping against your GP/HR or kills/hr and compared it to the cost and time of leveling construction, i think you'd be surprised.
---
Obviously there will be outliers like corp solo, but for the majority of players its an unnecessary expenditure when they could be upgrading their gear or training other buyables.
---
Go drunk, you are home.
---
Maybe beginner could focus on f2p bis items
---
okay, trying really hard to make a case for allowing botting that would be good for the player base and they would buy into. and there isn't one.  
---
you could have Jag say botting is a-ok and they release their own bot tool that you pay for, but that makes it pay to win instead of grind to win.  
---
at the end of the day, your stance is on the wrong side of over a decade of evidence; the game is still strong without botting. so obviously banning based on bots works AND it doesn't "Hemmorrhage" money because if it was so bad Jag would stop enforcing it or go out of business. but they haven't done either of those things.   
---
This game is all about time and dedication and a good feeling when you finally get the thing you want. if you want a game about quick fixes play a MOBA or a BR but even those games reward you for patience and perseverance. 
---
video evidence of what? Look no part of me desires to get into the nit and grit of whatever the fuck happened in this guys life; but she could've just claimed that he was beating her or whatever off stream. 
---
people unfamiliar with the spotlight tend to act pretty irrational when 10k people are watching.
---
Assuming Jagex wants some sort of warning, we could compromise and do it Dark Souls style, where mimic chests are SLIGHTLY different looking than normal chests. Similar enough for you not to notice at first glance, but noticeable if you know what to look for.
---
Yes im kind of a superhuman

---
The ones they've been releasing haven't been that great. The older ones are way better. 
---
and make it so that you have to pay 10m upfront, and then pkers will get 5m if they kill you. Gold sink and all. Also make it so that you always lose it on death.
---
But you get it from dying not from killing, little consolation prize

Or they're turning white in a top / down pattern?

Also have the spade always protect on death no matter where in the wild.

---
alright, but do you not think Jagex know they've a huge bot infestation?
---
I get my nightly dose of color blindness when flux kicks in and makes a bunch of pots look the same. Tbh just remembering where you put each pot in your inventory isn't so bad. You can intentionally put them not right next to each other so it's more clear, too.

Whoa, thanks. This is rad.

Hmm. Other guy says whips okay. Is it really a lock to use arclight? I may have to go to catacombs for a bit then and get one more shard for an extra 1k charges.

Congrats on the drop! Construction wouldn’t be a terrible thing to spend your gp on because you will eventually be able to do high level pvm and when you do get there you’ll have it already. I recently hit 85 construction and man do I love what came with it. Just know when it comes to building the stuff that comes with it that can be pretty expensive too.  I will say that there are better things to do than construction but if you want to get it out of the way go for it! 
---
Other things could be getting your prayer up, gear upgrades such as a torture army, anguish etc. Spending some gp on skilling for quest/diary requirements.

double agent clues are the only ones that have warnings, though. other clue enemies like saradomin mages and ancient wizards dont give any warning before attacking you...

I like your suggestion that examining the chest could give a warning, I think that's a good compromise
---
You are aware that you can calculate the percent rate from the weights on the wiki right? Add up the total weights and then the percent chance for each task is (individual weight/total weight)*100

Most people's long term goal is maxing anyway, why would you not get your construction up?

Is the point of them being in the tombs known? I'm basically trying to suss out whether or not it would make sense for my character to be using Veracs armor, I'm under some RP restrictions I quite enjoy and am just trying to figure out what my BIS items may be.
---
My character is a saradominist priest, I can only wear prayer gear that is neutrally/saradomin alligned, and I'd prefer not to kill morally "good" NPCs to obtain it. AFAIK my best gear is prossy/saradomin rune armor, but was curious about Veracs armor.

Yep. Could be a toggle-able.

Not necessarily.  Universities, especially in the U.S love to throw in "filler" classes which are downright useless, but you still have to complete (you choose a few).  It sounds like a general class based on like Societal Culture.  I had to take one and even the professor mentioned something about overfishing of the Atlantic Cod which caused an imbalance in aquatic wildlife.
---
It's really not that farfetched here, especially if your professor doesn't give a damn.  Holy hell, I hate uni.

Stand at GE for an hour and you'll find someone. I just do my buyable skills at GE, eg. Herblore, cooking, magic &amp; fletching. 
---
Most of the time people will come to you, but just typing "selling feathers" every half an hour works. 
---
You're very critical of something people have done for years successfully. Try it and get back to me tomorrow.
---
Because its better to put that cash and time towards other buyable skills to improve your ability to generate xp and resources.

Con should be something you do just for convenience, not for efficiency.

Top 10 anime battles 
---
&gt;	several strangers have approached me about it
---
Yes this is part of the joke of "doing your part". Mr beast did something similar stopping people on college campuses to ask if they have subscribed. It's just for fun. Only a minority actually pretends it's for a cause. There is some gain to it which is keeping an individual creator at the top but most people don't actually take offense or some shit if you don't sub.
---
&gt;You certainly don't have to be botheted by him being rich, but the fact that he's already rich is why it's stupid to work toward making him ever more successful by telling people to subscribe. He'll be just fine.
---
I don't understand this at all. Do you only support people in desperate need? Cause you realize everyone except those in poverty will be "just fine". They have a place to sleep, things to eat, entertainment, etc. To top it off what kind of influence do you see in subscribing. Do you really think that button is some limited use thing that you need to save for the struggling content creators who need it. It's like upvotes, you can use it as much as you want whenever you want so why take it so seriously. Like ya it helps him, someone rich, get richer. It's at no cost to you though so why does it concern you that you're "supporting" someone who doesn't need it. It's not like you're financially investing in him.
---
And then finally, why do you think he doesn't need it. You realize if everyone had that mentality he wouldn't have any support. YouTube demonetizes all his shit and copystriking is a literal business now. All his success comes from subs and merch. He's not a bad guy like I said so if it costs me nothing to make sure he retains his success I'm going to do it. It's just a button for me, it's everything for him

the crystal tools seem quite useless as they are... How about increasing their equip stats from the dragon versions?  This will atleast make the crystal pickaxe useful as BIS for killing guardians in cox.
---
everyone has preferences lad, just set your own personalized goals; they don’t have to relate to others’ goals.
---
People buy feathers at the same time as they buy dart tips from the exchange. There is no reason to buy from someone else whenever the buy limit for feathers is higher than darts. Why don't you try selling darts in bulk?
---
I mean...putting in four potentially best in slot armours, and having them fail is a good thing. Armadyl and elite void are still plenty strong. 
---
Hell, the ghrazi rapier is still a bit bullshit as it's a non-degradable best in slot item for almost everything melee based. 
---
now pkers can pk something worth value
---
That'd be counterfeiting money ;)
---
Like what? Crafting? Just use castle wars bank. Farming? Herb runs aren't even worth doing at a high level and farming can be cheap as shit anyway. Smithing? Useless skill. Fletching? Useless skill. Prayer is very cheap to get to 77, which is the highest you'll need til you go for diaries/max. The only buyable you need is 90 herblore, and herblore can be very cheap if you're patient with ge prices. And even for herblore, 78 is usually fine for raids.
---
Construction is objectively the best buyable to train on a main unless you're rushing inferno or something.
---
Just buy it from the ge bro!
---
Glad to hear it! This game does stand on its own (it has far more active players than RS3) but part of the reason why it does is because of its simplistic graphics. It's also the reason why a full mobile port was possible. The graphics will never change, they're a defining part of Old School, along with the combat system. 
---
did you ask this question just to be able to tell people you are an ironman?

Hey a water-themed version of fight caves sounds like a n**ice** idea

As much as I love the nostaliga, this would completely go against the artstyle. Cool suggestion though.
---
no idea is that not possible? i thought it was or maybe my memory is incorrect. But i think I had two accounts on one email but i could be wrong.
---
Makes sense. I had like 100k from doing the mushroom wcing, herbi, volcanic mine, and a few wyverns. Wasn’t sure if ironmen really do that other content lol
---
Cute.
---
Well you need less of a cash stack to buy feathers in bulk, plus, fletchers can alternate between different metals when it comes to darts and even bolts for the same method. They're more likely to overpay for feathers. 
---
You're a fucking chump. If you can sell &lt;20k worth of currency for over 2x its value then the amount of time you'd ever have to work is minuscule. 
---
for real? Good shit man maybe I need to look back into it when i have some down time. Also it seemed like there was like a mini monopoly on the hosting worlds. I'm doing a terrible job explaining it but like the same few people are always hosting and they bring in most of the people.

Can I just point out that 600k in Rs3 is nothing.  It's like 40k OS GP, if that.
---
It's the same when people say shit like "HAHA YOU CAN CAMP GRAARDOR INDEFINITELY IN RS3 SO EASY GAME HAHA".  Failing to realise that Graardor in Rs3 is now a low-mid level boss because of higher tier content.
---
Worse at mutta lmfao thats complete bullshit. Others are correct though. Still overall void range is better than arma on some layouts, especially if u skip vesp.
---
Fake email. Jagex doesn't email you if you break the rules.
---
I saw these accounts in the level 1 ba room  a month or two ago and none of them moved for hours, I assumed it was a broken bot.  I recognized the pink hats 
---
I can agree to some extent. I started playing in 2004, if memory serves, and quit playing when EOC came to the game, it just didn't feel the same anymore. However, even then I never had a high leveled account, I want to say my best account in those days had around 70s in all the combat stats and my Skilling stats were just as bad. To that effect, some of the older late game content these days doesn't do a whole lot for me. My osrs main certainly isn't raids status, but I'm enjoying Zulrah and GWD. The older content doesn't do much for me. I've never attempted KQ but I imagine I would feel that way to some extent. For me the feel of the game is so much more important than the task though, even the grind doesn't bother me much because it's nostalgic. This is most of the reason I hope they never update the graphics, because that was the beginning of the end for me. It didn't look like the same game anymore, then with EOC it didn't feel like the same game.
---
bro i afk all day long there at work, it's legit been lifechanging going from barely having time to train to 75k from my second combat 99 in 1.5mo.
---
you have to raise the operation inside the parentheses to the amount of kills you getting e.g.  1 - (1999/2000)^2500 is 2500 kills
---
Google "ge tracker" it's a fliiping/moneymaking tool they have a discord and a cc
---
Bwaner is our word, but you can call me bwana
---
And i know void is not bis overall, but people saying its trash make it seem to be 10%+ less dps which is nonsense.

congratulations! i think we all remember our first time.. oh that jail, and that monkey child! I can litterally feel the exhaustion from trying and trying over and over again.

It's a pretty ingenious way of getting an unsuspecting new players information. Shitty thing to do all the same.
---
According to the tomb, the brothers were saradominist God wars warriors who died under strange circumstances, and buried by their allies. A stranger was then seen performing some ritual on their graves.. 
---
But according to rs3 lore, the brothers were sort of resurrected and basically repurposed by sliske(not saradomist), who then granted their current armor to them. 
---
Barrows armor doesn't count as a saradomin aligned armor in the god wars dungeon. But then again, neither does proselyte, and the white Knight army is a saramonist regime. 
---
Barrows lore isn't really expanded on at all in osrs. So it's really up to you to decide if you think rs3 lore should count here
---
Probably but it doesn't really seem like these things should be open to interpretation.  There's a million other patterns you could do that have one clear answer.

Honestly, part of me agrees. However, the problem for me was that the wiki has about[ 7 different pages](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Crafting), each with [multiple tables](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Crafting/Jewellery) on them, making it extremely difficult to get a quick overview. Hence why I made the plot - lack of all information in one place, and a table would have to be pretty huge for all of these data points.
---
Quests, in a vacuum, don't break the game. The rewards can be a good or a bad thing. Did you even read what I said lmao
---
A quest and its rewards are, in osrs, entirely separate. We vote them in independently. Quests do and should always pass. The rewards often shouldn't.

&gt; I mean you would end up with someone confusing a stamina pot and Sara brew instead for example.
---
As long as one has a noticeably darker colour than the other, no colourblind person would confuse them. Even people with achromatopsia who see in greyscale will be able to tell the difference.
---
Thank you. I'd hope people wouldn't do anything malicious to me but thank you for the advice you are right
---
Infernal chuckle. 
---
I see, I suppose I will skip out on veracs then. Thank you and anyone else for the info.
---
what a loser lol
---
indeed
---
Please no, we don't need any more platforms with upvote systems.
---
Yes please tbh
---
Me too, I was in discord with 2 of my irl friends (both experienced players) who said it should only take like an hour to two but that’s not realistic for a noob lol
---
Got mine at 97 man. There’s still hope for you.
---
A huge thank you my friend
---
This comment made less sense than your last one. Are you ok?
---
The i got sent to the jail more times that i can count, but the monkey child i found easy, just slooooowww.

Are you 100% certain that this is the reason you got hacked? bearing in mind you are about to cause me a lot of inconvenience if you are lying.
---
Are they not the same shade of colour? It would be helpful if the brightness of one of them was changed. Changing the shade of colour won't help much because it will probably just get closer to another potion then.
---
I've heard that that guy is a pussy.

What's so funny?

When can we expect to get more information on group ironman mode, like the release date , group size, and what happens if someone leaves your group?

They were originally saradominists who went into morytania to fight draken and his forces, but they were slowly getting overwhelmed; its when sliske showed up and gave them armor, but in exchange they would have to pay a price, they agreed, Though in life they can serve their god saradomin, in death they have to serve sliske's god; zaros. Source is below, note this lore was written well before rs3, don't see why people saying sliske's is not canon in osrs. \*shrug\*

You click once on fishing spot, then hop to another app. Osrs mobile will stay logged in and fish like on a normal client.

Crazy as this sounds, I have no idea what you mean by that. Not even a guess.

Did you ever notice the drummer of Smells of Team Spirit totally looks like the singer from the Food Fighters?

Oh mine always logs. Maybe its because of battery saving mode.

And yes. Pants are equipped. Trimmed

Mage form can randomly use ranged attacks. It's not possible to predict them.
---
I recommend questing, it’s a nice introduction to the game
---
Thank you!!

It is, you can see the line below the text in the chat box
---
I agree wholeheartedly to everything you said here.
---
Well, I would but it’s just id get in the mindset of never wanting to make a mistake during risky content, restricts you from quite a lot of clue scrolls too and other content that involve the wilderness
---
around 6 months to get the supplies for 82-99
---
I'm almost always afk for now. This account is 2 months old lol so stackable are perfect for me to stay down here and farm decent xp and decent gold. The gloves are good, but they're not worth getting an entire stat to 70 and doing another 120 points worth of quests. If we're talking about priorities, how about having stats vs. having gloves. 
---
All ironmen are children.
---
Ironchild btw.
---
Oo wow I did not know this, i couldn't figure out why I'm taking so much damage even tho I'm protecting mage, so anytime hes in mage form he can use range as well?
---
ah shit, almost clicked on this at work. Not this time...
---
It's true. ITS DAM TRUE!
---
Really looking foward to starting raids, still need to find a good group and get some better gear. 
---
When you unlock GE teleport from diaries the varrock tele becomes very useful. Jewelry box is op same with mounted glory until you get the leveld to unlock it in jewelry box. Spirit tree? It depends on what you wanna do tbh
---
retardation is also for life, bud

No it’s funny

Fighter torso is not bis.

Who in the world uses video guides for quests?

Morvran was next in line for the title of Lord Iorwerth, but gave it to a dude you meet in Plague's End (RS3 Song of the Elves) for reasons of peace and clan stability. The actual Lord Iorwerth gets nommed halfway through the final boss fight on that quest.

I think you should look through OP's history.  He's really just here to draw lewd art, similarly to how Zuhaar started the trend here.
---
Are you color blind by chance? I feel like you mixed something.

Woah, killer. I believe you. (:

I fucking searched his stats I'm so pissed fuck I ruined everything
---
The fucking thumping sound the guardians make is so annoying to hear from across a bank 
---
/r/deepfriedmemes are lit
---
Yeah. If you see a little bluegreen splash looking thing heading towards you while fighting mage form, definitely eat up. He can easily combo a back to back 40 40 lol.
---
Don't bother trying to pray flick on mage form. You'll just die for nothing.
---
dya mind if i ask how you estimate that number? based on roughly how many herb runs a day etc n what else is included. thanks pal!
---
Yes please
---
Might as well finish off runecrafting before you do anything else
---
Sorry I should have been more clear in my post, I meant the actual portals in the specific room. My bad.

Forever lol, like 10 hours afk at work. Probably could have cut it down by 2 hours if I was paying full attention. Not worth it at all, do Barb fishing haha
---
If you click it basically immediately before you get hit, you get a pretty long time in it. It's weird and it's been a while but you get like twice the time.

[https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Sliske](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Sliske) the post from hedge as stated in here was well before rs3, and was written in 2007 so he exists. Same with the elder gods, as Ful is actually stated in osrs.

Did you use runelite?

On mobile, can you change it so there's a small button we can press to bring up the keyboard to chat, instead of being able to press the whole chat bar near the middle of the screen?

What's your goals for the time being? They all have certain uses cant really answer that

You are correct.

Oh my god
---
I just looked at the xp graphs for herblore and farming on crystalmathlabs to get an estimated start/end date. I think I averaged around 5-9 herb runs per day.
---
It's a grandmaster quest so it most likely won't be possible for pures to complete.
---
Well i'm not an Ironman so, anything? I wanna start Bossing in God Wars and Zulrah.
---
This is it. 
---
It's all passing at like 90%+ so it's fine.
---
Okay wow this might actually have been the detail I needed thank you so much! I was getting pissed seeing him hitting consitent 30s through my prayer lol

WHERE'S THE BLUE CAPE
---
The drain does not take into account your gear, correct.
---
The difference between wearing prayer gear (prossy, devout boots etc) vs wearing mage gear for dps is so insignificant you will spend far less on supplies (prayer pots) wearing the prayer. 
---
You can try both and compare results, I have and found that the prayer is much more efficient. :)
---
started laughing because i knew what this was before i clicked on it xd
---
Yes, anytime you see a blue zulrah pray mage but watch for his range attack. Keep your HP above ~45.
---
Holy shit im in tears, well done sir
