I tried f2p Skilling and wanted to kill myself. I'd rather runecraft in full obsidian without stamina potions
---
---
---
So instead of the same shitty and stale memes we get the same shitty and stale "after 4 years of playing" posts. Fantastic.
---
Gif source? Or is this OC?
---
My face when
---
It’s part of Pirate Pete’s subquest in RfD.

Let's say for Hellhounds or Black Demons

mountain time (right now its 5:10)

I mean, the equivalency is in the knowledge of the possible/likely consequences for his chosen actions, even when alternatives exist. there are a million ways to play the game, he's chosen to play a piece of content in the wilderness, he knows whats up, it's on the signs when you walk north!
---
[removed]
---
Honestly, I'd rather see "I just hit 99" posts than memes.
---
Only if you want 20% more exp, not even that, stop spewing shit without knowing. You can get 2gp/xp with 150k/xp, there is many ways to train it.
---
Top comment btw
---
Does justiciar have any uses other than the inferno and rune dragons?
---
And pet drops
---
Yay!
---
I've gotten 500 nats from doing this. Lol
---
Nice at least you know you’ve done it. Life long failure here
---
Adding this here; Slepe is lacking in content and a rooftop course here could be a great place for Black Graceful to come from. Make it an alternative to Seers-tele for 80-90 agility. The NPC that sells you the black graceful set can be an arch-enemy of Grace's (hell yeah, lore baby).
---
I mean unless you've got a raking fetish and disable it
---
At the very least you can get consistent 4kc trips. I know, I've been there and done it without rigour.
---
Lmao, how do you guys come up with things like this??
---
OH SHIT BROTHER YOU BETTER CRANK THAT HOG WHILE YOU CAN ARRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOO
---
this isn't a random event though
---
i really think an ironman would solve a lot of your gripes with the game
---
While normally I'd agree with this sentiment adding an otherwise unobtainable(for no reason) item to a shop stock takes 0 developer time.
---
Oh that's fair, I was fuckin ready if there was a way to get herblore to 99 in 3 hours lol
---
Lol? Can get 750 slay PTS in a day, gl doing 100 farm contracts in that time.
---
TIL filling my enventory with platebodys doesn't max my defense level
---
I love that is never the punchline, he always just kinda casually says it. You can't just look to the end of the comment to see the " in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."
---
Sheet. Maybe on weekends. It's midnight in uk
---
Credit card fraud.
---

---
Many stolen credit cards was spent on runescape, the credit card companies got sick of all the refund and tasked jagex to deal with it.
---
As a result we got trade restriction.
---
That's like saying seconds exist to make life as devoid as fun as possible? EHP is a unit of measurement used to measure the minimal amount of hours required to level up an account to it's current stats. 
---
That's it.
---
This sub has a blind hatred for ehp without understanding it.
---
Wait till you hear about my dad
---
damn rip btw add me on osrs ZayOsrs
---
Roll tide!
---
In all seriousness, when my friend first told me about the game in 2006, I went home after school and got on my dad’s computer to play what I thought was called roomscape, but when I typed it into the browser it just took me to a interior design website. I was sad and I had to wait a whole other day before excited young me could try out a cool new game
---
I bought a Brine Saber for Rock Slugs.
---
A guy got it qith 18 cb.. Lol
---
That 18 combat fire cape was crazy to watch
---
That's late game, early game is shit. Like think back to 1 or 2 traps
---
You're an honorable man.
---
I'd say having a job and being able to support yourself is much more fulfilling than spending an average of 14 hours a day for 6 years clicking on pixels.
---
I can't have twitch finger control forever ready to log out at a moment's notice. I'd like to be able to access inventory and prayer sometimes
---
Disgusting "smooth" animations 😷
---
I don't think it's worth anybodies time to try and convince you otherwise. You've made it pretty clear you would never understand a pet rat.
---
You sound like a problem solver
---
Lol I think your exaggerating that a bit...
---
I'll put it in my notes I'm not at home rn
---
I call Minecraft Mineman because of what a friend's mom called it in the background of a discord call
---
I just had an orjazzm
---
Ur hot
---
Anyone asking that is braindead enough to forget they destroyed one version of the game by doing that
---
You can spam click some herbs and allotments to harvest them faster!
---
Yes; they were nerfed as the prices of brews were affected by it.
---
I miss this a lot from RS2.
---
Yup, that was the point of my comment, wintertodt is fun and fast xp so it doesn't deserve the "z tier."
---
No it is not safe, it downloads compiled java code from the owners server every time you run it and executes it. I doubt anyone is going to read java byte code, and I very much doubt anyone would notice if he added something malicious. 
---
Is it trust worthy? Probably. Guy seems chill enough. Do you trust him? Then you're good to go. Do you trust him to keep his Web server secure? I personally don't, so I will not be using his client. You should learn to compile your own runelite and add the plugins you want if you care about account security.
---
I just hit 60 atk and def and don't really know where to go armor or weapon wise after this. I'm super poor with 150K to my name alongside my rune set. What should I aim for now?
---
Been playing osrs for 3 years and never knew this existed lol. I thought it was a Jmod trolling him at first 😂
---
Could you point me in a direction where I can learn to do so! That sounds awesome
---
Practice on the jad simulator.  I did jad first try, and 3rd try in general (died trying to pray flick the mages) with 60 def, 60 pray, and 87 range or something.  
---
Jad is honestly easy I feel like most people fail because they get nervous and can't keep their heart rate down and focus.  Logout before jad and take some deep breaths before you start
---
1/10th chance of herb dying with ultra in 1 event. Therefore you exponentiate that percentage with the number of events. (1/10)^3 = 1/1000 which is fairly unlucky
---
😢😢 guess I'm just in it for that sweet sweet Hunter exp then. Was hoping to sustain a bond tho
---
I'm almost positive older people like to do this just to fuck with their kids, then when their kids get older they do the same. As is tradition.
---
Has this always been the dialog? I’ve been a space bar warrior for every quest, I never would’ve noticed
---
They patch stuff it’s not intended to be there, and for my experience in game, zuk is slightly easier than triple jads.
---
So if you meant getting every wave harder than the wave before, yeah. 
---
Idk man, Jagex don’t test many stuff
---
when you are walking to lavas why would you need to do those things?
---
his username?
---
NOBODY CARES ABOUT ANYTHING

---
Don’t complain then.

Would love to have an explanation on how you get around the magic blast hitting you while praying ranged.. It chews me up.. I get 2 sometimes 3 kills per trip ( tho just started it)

---
Would love some input does elite void have more magic def?
---
Perfection.
---
Yeah why the obby cape?
---
lol
---
The point is not the correct calculation but the tiny chance of this occurring, if what you say is true then it only proves it is only more rare.
---
Mobile
---
I don't know yeah it seems like they're still probably broken. The wiki suggests an average of 8 nests a run but I'm getting more like 4 at best.
---
On the flipside my parents thought their credit cards would be hacked and refused on that reason alone
---
so am i wrong there? would that allow him to get into your email thru 2fa?

You need 60% favour and min 45 farming to enter the guild 
---
There was an update very recently so that you no longer lose favour in other houses. To gain favour you usually just do a couple of monotonous tasks, and you'll gain favour for each action or whenever you hand some items in to an NPC. For Hosidius I think you need to start out just pushing a trough back and forth (simply left clicking to move it, nothing tricky)  
---
You can also make fertiliser, check the wiki on how to do it. It's really cheap to buy the supplies, and really fast favour too. But can be quite click intensive. I personally did this method to 100%. 
---
You should complete the depths of despair quest at 20% favour because it gives 10% as a reward. And you can also start Hosidius Kitchen to gain some decent cooking xp as well as gain favour. The wiki will explain how to do that better than I can tbh
---
Can't swim with wep equiped and seuctuars don't work on seaweed.
---
Could we see some improvements to NPC spawns in regards to old quests?  
---
For example:  
---
\- In Fight Club, when you fight General Khazard, the original NPC still remains, so there are two General Khazards in the same area during the fight. After that, both Sammy and Justin Servil remain in the Fight Arena jail after Khazard sets them free. Only in the Quest Log does it mention that they are rescued.  
---
\- In Merlin's Crystal, Merlin can be found wandering around in his room while he is still locked away in the crystal.  
---
Things like these made me go "Huh?" when I first did these quests the first time around.  
---
These are the only two examples I can freshly remember going through a new account but I am sure there are more.
---
you'd have more success if you did
---
And sometimes like that it be. Runelite doesn’t track runs I start on my phone unless I come near the patch again while on Runelite. Is that a thing? Am I imagining this?
---
Careful. You'll get down voted talking about that around here.
---
Stop giving Jagex stupid ideas because they always do it lol
---
Lmao
---
I was starting to think that the whip was a myth
---
Yeah the runelite client doesn't know you planted them so doesn't know. It's a thing, it be like that
---
Holy b
---
Nice
---
Yeah and I’m bill gates
---
Even at zanaris there’s a bot crisis between rcing bots and puro puro bots
---
I wonder how long you have to wait in the instance for him to wake on his own.
---
Hmm, the wiki says this about D(e):
---
&gt;This increases the max hit by 15% and ignores your opponents defence and your own accuracy for the hit it activates on.[1][2][3] A tinkling sound can be heard when this activates. 
---
Does that mean it can't miss? It kind of seems like you could still miss, you just have a better hit chance against things with high defense.
---
I'm not sure though.
---
Get a dragon scimitar first, then go for fighter torso and dragon legs, and dragon boots.
---
Once you get 130 total of attack + strength go to warriors guild and get dragon defender

Lol, this is simply recommending a fix, not reworking the entirety of sire. Not like this is going to take all dev time from every department. Sire is underwhelming as hell, shit loot, annoying as fuck to kill, is a overall useless boss without the bludgeon.
---
Can someone explain the 11$ crab stuff?
---
that guy probably has neither
---
You don't end up on the the seabed when you equip them, though.
---
Apparently this happens when you log out with them being equipped.
---
That's where my confusion and intrigue stems from.
---
Y u lying
---
Why is it such a big deal then?
---
Can we remove the stones under the tool leprechaun at the allotment patch north of Ardougne? I often miss click on them when trying to note herbs on mobile
---
A1 meme
---
I thought my 817 was bad. Grata man. Still hunting that heart myself.
---
Those people actually did something useful hence why their accounts are superior. I'd rather see that than a bunch of loser 1.3k total accounts post stupid memes all day. You guys are probably the same bunch that'd cry streamer and maxed main catering and think you're entitled cuz mommy told you one too many times expecting content to be designed for you guys when you haven't earned it.
---
I've never posted any of this, but it's just outright disrespectful for those who put in the time and effort. Some of us enjoy seeing those posts.
---
its about time this gets talked about, the sceptre deserves its place as a useful item.

No

Do you not like it because of how some animations loop poorly, or is it just the smoothness in general?

Someone should make a RuneScape cover band and just play all RuneScape classic hits... it would probably be cool to see a live album of like 10-20 tracks on Spotify or someshit
---
&gt;You can use your spade on a patch to clear it even if there is something growing in it.
---
Except if it's a herb patch.
---
I’ll let them have their moment. 
---
It’s a big achievement and this is one of the few places to share with the community, if we can’t celebrate others successes in the community then what’s the point?
---
We pay $11 for both OSRS and RS3, yet OSRS is the more popular game by far and the dev team for it is a tenth of the RS3 team. That’s why we 🦀🦀
---
I'd say exp rates are way different between games.
---
Did you know if you Control click with run off, your character runs to where you clicked, I hope this blew your mind too 10 years and I found that out the other day -.-
---
Imagine this: they're both different games with different development teams and different communities.
---
I'd consider upgrading soon if your phone if you are normally concerned about your phone over heating. 
---
Plenty of 300-400 dollar phones these days with specs similar/better to top end 1k phones.
---
I have the s10e and I really like it. The battery life is awesome. I upgraded from an s5.
---
Um rapid heals bis for thieving tyvm.
---
I think you should separate these suggestions into individual comments next time. None of these suggestions are necessarily related and it makes it hard to judge their individual quality.
---
Master penance helmet is a nice idea.
---
Acolyte armour would barely make a difference to anyone, but I want a continuation of the temple knight quests and acolyte armour seems like a fitting reward.
---
Guardian boots are fine. They don't need changing, especially now that we have brimstone boots for proper hybrid boots.
---
Karamja diary needs rebalancing, but I don't think noted metal bars are even that good tbh.

Noted wyrm bones should be on the hard diary. The medium diary is already pretty good considering the requirements.

Lmao no. 3 pedals only man. I actually swapped my car from an auto to a manual when my transmission broke 2 months after I bought my car
---
How does he plan on beating the inferno? With whats weapons and gear? What kind of food/potions. I’ve tried looking it up but don’t understand since you need range to kill Zuk
---
as for the invo and misclicks i was playing on fullscreen strecth because i didn't know shadow play was going to only record the runelite window. As for the clicking too fast, I thought it was based off of the herb+tar animation not dropping the fish.
---
It was nerfed a long time ago. If it was just the past week you noticed it then you where probably just unlucky.
---
I'm with you on the 99's, not with you on the 5 KC pet drop/etc.
---
Thank you for your feedback!
---
So because the xp rate is lower its not a bug?
---
Case in point :)

Makeover mage ftw

Going out of your way to obtain them isn't really worth it, but I figure if you get one while randomly doing something else then it's a fun distraction.

 Q. Can white lily seeds be added to the Hespori's unique seed list to have a chance to be dropped in place of an anima seed?
---
Currently it already provides much more anima seeds than you can use and would help to get enough lily seeds for contracts.
---
Since when?
---
Nope. I expect there will be a blog about it soon.
---
Ah, didn't know it was different between RS3 and OSRS. You can get +6s in RS3, so I just assumed it was the same in OSRS.
---
No that isn't allowed anymore they changed it maybe a year ago
---
New discovery: When you equip the secateurs it seems to begin the animation of you descending to the seabed, however, it seems to bug out half way and allows you to swim with the secateurs. I assume they intended to have it put you on floor when you equip a weapon. When you log out with them equipped, then log back in, you actually end up walking as the developers intended. It doesn't make very much sense though, considering the secateurs aren't heavy at all lol.
---
The cry of the menaphos.
---
They probably do, but people who can reanimate those heads usually have 100% favour already. The data is mostly player-collected so if you find values for those feel free to add them.
---
Seen them at 7-eleven at one point. You could also buy a visa giftcard or something and use that to buy membership.
---
For example people on Etsy 3d printing modules. Shirts being created. When does it become “enough” for jagex to step in? There’s obviously hundreds of people profiting.
---
What statistics do you mean? The four or five on Reddit that have made claims?
---
tbh its a lot easier just watching what jad does
---
Doing barrows.
---
The real question is, who brings house tabs to vorkath and not law, dust, and chaos runes in a pouch.
---
its a nice drawing either way  xD &lt;3
---
Yeah it doesn’t work with Mac or older computers for some reason
---
What gear should I be aiming for melee slayer? I currently have neitznot helm, fighter torso, d legs/lboots, amulet of glory, whip, obby cape.
---
80 attack/def/str
---
Any advice please?
---
i just shit myself more xp that way
---
&gt; Location specific.
---
What makes you think you could do it NMZ?
---
yeah.
---
Real talk though: why is a plugin that tells you what to do in Vork/Zulrah cheating, while a plugin that shows you how to solve every clue not cheating?
---
Bruh that’s a Cleveland steamer!
---
I’m a decent baiter. My cousin, Mose, now he’s a master baiter.
---
People would continue autotyping wouldn't they?
---
how do you play osrs with those graphics? :O
---
When assigned Black Demons you are able to do them in NMZ with the Black Demon boss from The Grand Tree quest.
---
From the wiki:
---
A black demon is defeated during The Grand Tree. This demon can be re-fought in the Nightmare Zone after the quest has been completed. Killing Black demons in Nightmare Zone will count as a kill for a slayer task.
---
well said.
---
Lol wow
---
rs3 has a lot of "cool" looking stuff that hurts no one
---
All they’re doing is preventing you from banking the books. If you weren’t doing the Woox Imp-in-a-box method for Runecrafting before, this doesn’t affect you.
---
He's getting a rune crossbow. That's like the whole point of the hunter grind
---
What cute noobs
---
Flute Salad!
---
But that's not the location konar told you. I feel like it's pretty straight forward lol.
---
Well if he was the one to do it he knows exactly what to do to get his account unbanned, and it looks exactly like this. But no one should assume that op is doing that.
---
If I where to try this all I need to do is make sure I was botting only on my VPN after a suspicious password change. Then when my account gets banned I can simply try to log into my account from my home ip then get it recovered then bam.
---
It's very common to see this suggested in the botting forums. It's sad because it's truly hard to tell when the case is legitimate or not. 
---
*No one should bot, this no guarantee it even works, or even if jagex will get back to you. Not botting is the only 100% way to not get banned.
---
Any upcoming changes or thoughts to the granite ring? Very very cheap and almost useless ring that no one uses
---
That's really though tbh the client looked so good. Strange how they just gave away all their work so easily
---
I checked the message that is in the jagex inbox and no word of a free trial. 
---
Also it isn't that I won't have 11 dollars, but that I won't have it in the same place. I bought it through my phone and don't think I will be able to so next week.
---
Rip. I just finished a master and and got 230k. The elite that I got it from gave me 250k...
---
omg you monster it would take 10 seconds to wipe my drive
---
Oh damn. :/
---
Good luck, I'll be rooting for you.
---
slayer helm then fire cape and barrows gloves. verac skirt or obby legs depending on what task you're doing, dragon defender as well. Eventually you can go for a fury but this stuff should definitely be a priority
---
Yes, seems straight forward. Considering the abundance of information in the Wiki I was surprised this was not explicitly stated. I suppose I will have to just go and try myself. Less time than waiting for a response lol.
---
Wrong game then bud.
---
What part of "location specific" do you not understand?
---
I want OSHD so bad. I've been playing this game for 20 years. I'm ready for something new... Ugh It was gorgeous.
---
That's cool I guess but I paid through my phone and don't think I will be able to do the same in 7 days, so that kinda sucks since I don't have a credit/debit card.
---
Did you tag the healers and tank them or kill them? Also 60 defense so I’m curious
---
Seriously who keeps upvoting this shit.
---
"Woman casually poops in the middle of a store GIF"
---
 something should have been done years ago about this. the blind eye makes me very suspicious of jagex at this point
---
Ty buddy!
---
I'm not sure you're aware that you're supporting my position. I'm saying it's players that are toxic, not PvP inherently. 
---
PvP has existed for a long time and it has essentially been unchanged from the rs2/old b0aty era where people were very civil despite the PvP activity. So PvP isn't inherently toxic.
---
Another example is castle wars, where the people that are playing and not afking are quite civil and friendly. Castle wars is a PvP game mode, so PvP must not be inherently toxic.
---
Literally Unplayable
---
One of my old accounts had something similar happen. They wouldn’t unban it. I just wanted the name off it :(
---
He said he’s probably to go into the inferno next time with 1 range, and just level it up from within the inferno. Absolute madman.
---
Yeah but my bill kinda resets soon so I don't know if I will be able to pay through the phone next week.
---
And how does it work
---
you have a funny feeling like you’re being followed.
---
:O
---
Whichever offer was first
---
The problem is, the chance of getting a pet at EXACTLY whatever KC is always going to be a really small number. Whether it's getting Skotos at the 5th KC or the 105th KC.
---
A better, more informative probability to calculate for posts like these, is the probability that you get the pet *by* a certain KC. Eg. Getting Skotos pet *at* 3 KC versus getting Skotos pet *by* the 3rd KC.
---
I don't think the store has RS cards at least by me. I can get a gift card though.
---
It isn't a big deal, it's just a matter of convienence.
---
Also I didn't know if it WAS a trial so that's why I asked on here. The inbox message didn't say I got a free trial. Just that they got my payment, which made me think I got charged.
---
...slayer
---
What's your stats/bank like? Completing these other milestones in the past days makes me think you likely aren't raids ready. You want 90+ cb stats and a decent bank value for gear, but can go lower if you are looking to do it to try out/for fun.
---
Mod West was a teen when EoC was added
---
It probably needs AI to counter large scale botting but then again bot makers make bot AI that counters Jagex AI. Then we have 2 AI-s that try to one-up each other in the never-ending cycle until bot AI plays exactly as humans do.
---
By looking at the stats, rune crossbow seems to outclass Karil's crossbow in every way. Is there ever a good reason to use Karil's over a rune cbow?
---
Well back in the days, iron bowz had 4 melee peices, dupe kite tho he was on sparc mac live
---
I needed that laugh
---
Between herb and birdhouse runs you should be able to sustain bonds for the most part depending on how often you play
---
Brother in sister?
---
Go with Duradaddy and run that cannon dry.

36 bongs
---
You can get away with no prayer for most of the game but once you start higher level content you're going to have a bad time.
---
Neither are bolts or javelins.
---
Not the pet itself, getting it at 59 farming.
---
? Put them on ?
---
The hunter method is using 2 different potions one that acts as a overload for skilling and another that gives the same affect. The second one isn't actually used since you already have the boost but it gives you the drinking animation instead of the laying trap animation.
---
Good point.
---
Raiden, I need you to squeeze my hog
---
Hey one of those guys is me

This is a good day.
---
Can we allow the Ivandis flail to cast claws of guthix? Currently there is no reason to ever choose claws of guthix over zammy falmes or sara strike in pvp. This change would be enough to give claws of guthix a niche and the staff is a cool looking, quest locked item. I'd like to see it used more in the wild. 
---
It might also see some pvm use with this change. I'm not too sure what's meta nowadays, but low levels and ironmen used to use flames of zammy for some pvm stuff. Ivandis flail gives a nice prayer bonus, and a bit more magic bonus than the normal godstaves, so this change would make it mid tier, above the default staves but below the Staff of the Dead and the Staff of Light. It takes a good amount of time/effort to unlock the invandis flail so it wouldn't be op.  
---
A bit more about Ivandis flail and pvp: Ivandis flail has a spec bar, which makes it possible to 1tick into your special attack/ko weapon, so it is sometimes used by players on ancients even though it has worse bonuses than the ahrim's staff and the ancient staff.
---
 Also, 1 defence pures wouldn't be able to use the flail because the quests give 2600 defence xp, so this change could be considered a small buff for 20 defence pures. 13 defence pures would need to do a quest that gives 600 defense xp to unlock the flail, which would put them at 15 defence. 13 and 20 defense pures are considered weak so I don't think a slight buff relative to 1 defence pures wouldn't be an issue.

I remember that lol

I'm not sure if they sell the ones specifically for membership anymore? Last I saw they sold the ones that give you say a $10 credit for whatever you want to use it for in relation to Runescape.

My guess check Gamestop, Walmart maybe, 7-11.

Why do you always resort to being so rude? What’s you’re problem man? Are you okay? I get that life’s hard but taking it out on others does nothing but spread the hostility. I know you’re a child because adults do not do that. Word of advice try to be nicer.

And to respond to your post yeah I see what you mean. It has happened before. Have a nice day

great, now i cant forget about this. i will be thinking about it while taking my final exam.

What's your great idea that doesn't ban legitimate players and won't cost Jagex a small fortune to maintain?

Do emerald bolts only have a chance to proc if they do damage?

I never said I couldn't afford it. I said it would be easier for me to pay through my phone, but won't be able to do that next week. It is that I can't afford it at all, just that the t would be easier both time and budget wise to pay through my phone.

If you're worried that the price would go down and that you would "lose money", that only means you can't actually afford the gear.

I use lower tier prayers all the time depending on how long I expect to go without an altar if I'm on my ironman where ppots are scarce. Also sometimes on my main if I need to afk and don't want to have to drink a super restore every minute like I would with piety.

For a skilling method, making iron bars in the blast furnace is click intensive but has very low entry requirements and is good, consistent money. Ideally you want to have a coal bag from motherlode mine which lets you make steel+ bars efficiently, but if you need some cash and have a few hours spare then this might be the way to go.

I think that's what happened in the first place considering how shit it turned out.
---
Just think of things as investments, you invest money into tassets for slayer, make the money with slayer so even if you end up selling it back it won't hurt. 
---
If you're worried about losing money just look at GE charts of the item, if it's the lowest it's been in a couple months it might be a good time to buy. 
---
I normally buy things that stay in my bank. That way you never lose money selling it back :p

Maybe if you’re piece of shit device could load more than 360p, you’d see it better

It's more like 100% of the time.  Since lava dragons take like a minute to kill each you can just camp logout with your mouse.  I died maybe twice my first two times going there and then I did two tasks after that without dying.

Ya’ll got anymore of those ropes? I’m on my 6th try and what gets me is juggling the healers. With 60 defence they hit pretty hard so I’m juggling brews, restores, prayer flicking jad and trying to lure the healers into a good spot. I always mess up on something.

If you know what your doing you can do it with a rune scim and rune armor easy.  If you want random people to take you on their team and not leave after the first wave get a d scim and a defender.  The only role where stats matter is attacker.
---
If you get an organized team you could play second attacker and switch roles for the later waves, so your stats really won't matter.  If you learn the other roles and make calls your good to go.
---
All 10 waves should get you all the points you need for a role.

Is crazy how people think warding can change the game, comparing to eoc and p2p stuff

Hey, I worked hard to perfect tapping overheads consistently on mobile without hitting other shit. Don't devalue me!

Similarly to the amulet of eternal glory, why cant we get an endless stamina potion? Or, does this royally fuck up PvP since you cant teleblock it?

If it's what you're taking to 99 and if it's your last stop, then yes

Lol warding changes pretty much nothing

What about the initial get-up? How did you get to the point of being knocked down?

 #squadgoals

Yeah but I just thought it was silly that they block stuff like pure essence from NMZ (Ironmen can only by redirection scrolls) but they let you buy everything in the one store that is ripe with abuse. Ironmen should just be allowed to buy the cosmetic and untradeable stuff like rune pouch and clue box.

Since they just did it, it's meaningless. Exactly your logic, not mine.

For skills that aren't random, you can do math yourself, and skills that are.... It doesn't matter. One guy can get 5 ultra rares and another can get none.
---
 Thinking about it from a roll playing mind frame I think gives better perspective for the way magic works. You train your offensive abilities ( attack and strength) to hit harder and understand how to penetrate defences. Training your own defensive capabilities will help you understand how to dodge or soften a blow. Magic is only ever countered by knowledge of magic or magical items. Just because you spent hours getting hit in the head doesn't mean you should be more resistant to anything other than getting hit in the head. As far as how powerful dragonhide is as a defence to magic.... dragons are strong against magic, weak to range, everybody know dat.....

I think its crazy to assume it wont, we wont know what will happen till it happens. It could be worse then eoc, after a few months of sounding like an okay skill, it could be garbage, or we can think its garbage and it be really fucking good.  But till i know for a fact im not saying either, im talking hypothetically.  If. Its bad, and this happens. Not its bad and this will happen.

I got 50 fishing with just shrimps and sardines at Draynor, and I wanted to commit not living before doing that, I think I'll just do it till 99 because I don't care at this point tbh.

Question for mr mod roq, will there be a legacy leaderboards for lms after the rework? Also can we see a lms server for each region, ping is crutial in this gamemode because of the prayerflicking and especially the vendors. Having lms globally i think will encourage a more compedative nature for leaderboards and will let the real best players shine.
---
It do be like that always
---
Picture...?
---
Amen couldn't have said it better!
---
This sub always makes me chuckle
---
Who knows? Seriously, only Jagex does and they don't release that info often. 
---
It's a logical fallacy (pretty sure its confirmation or survivorship bias or something) to look at bots that are like 50m exp in thieving and say "woah Jagex completely fails to ban Pyramid Plunder bots" because we aren't seeing all the bots that are banned.
---
The reality is that there are some accounts out there that have OBVIOUSLY been getting past jagex's measures for an extremely long time - whether that is because of unique scripts or that they're actually run by people who rwt on the down low - I do not know.
---
That's what I did :(
---
Honestly your response sounds like you really dont have much real experience with this topic.
---
&gt; You aren't doing a tribrid analysis. You're only analysing TWO attack styles and two types of armour (hybrid).
---
Thats because people rarely bring a full melee/tank setup, at most people will bring tank legs some of the time (at least meds/mains) and tank shield. But if you want to talk about melee's DPS, its 100% without a single doubt higher than magic's even through pray or a brid being in tank.
---
The conclusion doesnt change at all whether or not melee is included, mage comes out clearly at the bottom in terms of DPS in pretty much all situations which is the major point here. Not to mention, if were comparing a real brid situation, youre going to be frozen a good amount of time and Range+Mage is most of your damage, with Melee being used to KO.
---
&gt; Magic is strongest against melee armour. The fact that you haven't included this in the analysis is ridiculous.
---
And this is the real indicator that you clearly have next to 0 experience actually bridding, sorry but dont really know what else to tell you because you wouldnt be saying this if you did. Magic is SUPPOSED to be the strongest type of combat to use against someone using full melee gear, however if youve ever bridded across multiple accounts/brackets youd know that that is VERY CLEARLY not really the case.
---
If your opponent is 94+ mage (which they probably will be), the amount of times you will hit low or even worse SPLASH is actually astonishing and SUPER frustrating. One of the best examples I can think of to illustrate this is by telling you to watch Amenity's streams since he is very often maging people who are in full melee setups (or just dhide chaps in some cases) while in MAX MAGE gear for whatever account hes on and the amount of splashes and how low the dps is at times is just mind blowingly broken. Ive seen the guy splash FOUR times on one kill while attacking a guy in full DH, and whilst he was in full max mage praying augury on a main. And the problem is, splashing on full melee is not exactly a rare occurrence at all regardless of gear and DPS on a full melee setup provided they have a high magic level is most of the time NOT the most DPS which is fundamentally broken and something Jagex has chosen to ignore for ages. 
---
You can currently do more DPS in a rag range setup(so a good...50-70k? risk) with rigour bolting someone than you can being in pretty much full max mage( 500m risk) and augury. If your 2nd point was even remotely true, this wouldnt be the case. Anyone who has a decent amount of experience actually PvPing will all agree upon the fact Magic's DPS is complete and utter dogshit and its broken as hell.
---
&gt; You've completely skipped over the massive utility of mage. Being able to freeze, teleblock and so on, in particular is game changing
---
How is this relevant...? So because there is utility to it, it therefore deserves to be as broken and terrible as it is? Youre supposed to pretty commonly splash 3-5+ times in a row on a guy because hes wearing a single black dhide top(let alone double hides) while wearing tank everywhere else while youre in mystics+TSOTD+Occult etc.? 
---
This point is just completely invalid. Magic's damage (and magic defense) has been something that has been terrible and broken for a long time now, that same utility has always been there and guess what? **That utility means very little if you can only land spells once in a while.** No one's asking for it to be 90% guaranteed that your TB or Freeze will land, just that magic stops being completely broken dog shit, its not much to ask given how long its went on.
---
Honestly not really sure what the point of your post was since you just clearly dont have the greatest grasp or experience with the topic, but it sounds A LOT like youre trying to insinuate that Magic actually isnt completely broken and terrible. There is no argument to be had there, magic is and has been in an absolutely terrible, broken spot for a long time.
---
Wow that was fun!
---
I bought 80,000 buckets of regular compost on my ironman last year while leveling crafting. Would it be possible to use them on the Sandstorm grinder? I have 48,000 buckets of compost left and nothing to use them with
---
It gives you 3 combat levels.
---
Strictly from a pking perspective I don't think it's worth it. But if you want those benefits then go for it.
---
Honest question here, what should i use as alternative? I dont like bloodveld and fire giant tasks, so i found using cannon and blowpipe is a good way to finish them fast and maintaim high ranged exp/hr.
---
I dont really care for the money since i earn that through other means.
---
? Milking sgs specs gets you to zuk with full supplies unless you royally fuck up on one of the later waves
---
Unless you're running at (or below) 0kg (therefore a pretty empty inventory/gear), then Graceful still helps you. Full Graceful is around 2.1m and it takes a while to gain it, in comparison to Zulrah/Vorkath money being well over that in a single hour.
---
You're better off buying Graceful, using both bonuses (the negative weight as well as the set effect) and using other money sources to buy Staminas.
---
Lmfao you are clearly a fucking noob. 150k xp/h ahahaha. You know fast herblore is 400-500k xp/h, right? So ye you stop spitting shit you 1500 total freak.
---
Assuming it takes 1:30:00 to complete means you get ~67k slayer XP per hour doing inferno. That's assuming 100% completion rate. I'm sure there are faster slayer tasks
---
"Being at neither extreme" is in there somewhere. I would definitely say the start and finish of a quest are considered extremes
---
I almost wanna just go to 99 with swordies cause it's so afk
---
Can we make it so you can fletch inside barbarian assault, or atleast inside the waiting area for waves?
---
Is this all in one session? If it isnt and is across multiple sessions, how do you get runelite to keep tracking it?
---
Every time I start up a new client all of my loot tracking gets reset.
---
99 is 13 million XP. 13 million. You don't even hit your first million until after level 70 so yes getting to 13 million XP in a single skill is a heck of an accomplishment. For buyable skills it represents frequently hundreds of millions of go to billions in the case of something like efficient fletching. Some of the gathering skills like fishing it represents over 250 clock hours of efficient training with no profit for example barbarian fishing or much longer doing profitable fishing. So yeah a 99 still means something in the land of no double XP weekends.

Can a giant spade be added to the hesporis  drop table?
---
It would allow you to harvest allotments and other crops at twice the speed.
---
barrage and cannon all tasks that it is possible to do so, skip the others.
---
Reminds me of when I was at choir boy
---
Birdhouses are 4k xp per run if you're doing Yew birdhouses.
---
Unless you're deep within a task (mainly slayer/combat), then it's worth it.
---
All it takes is being at a bank and you can do the run in a couple of minutes and return to whatever you're doing. If you're just skilling at a bank then it's definitely worth the time.
---
I’m at the beginning of the quest lol. I haven’t even done the first step. I only started it. But I guess 1 is in the middle of 0 and 100. So thank you for coming to my post feel free to browse the other comments here.

Youre also completely clueless and should probably not give your opinion on things that you have no real experience or knowledge of.
---
I think your brain might need a small (large) buff.
---
only 1/4?
---
Could we have more options for the costume room? A melee weapons rack to store every melee weapon, armor vault to store every non trimmed set in, staff rack, archers hooks to hang/store every range weapon, a combat jewellery box that actually shows what's inside it (to a degree), etc.
---
Also any word on groop ironman mode?
---
I won't have heresy about Farming.
---
It's probably the easiest skill in the game and one of the quickest as well in terms of actual time spent.
---
zerk with obsidian sword is better

Existence of diarrhoea doesn't make one's whole body ruined.

Sounds like you're just bitter about certain drop tables not being to your liking. This is way different than things like MTX, wildy removal, EOC, and other updates that alienated a huge portion of their player base.
---
I don't know why you're pretending to be ignorant about these differences. But if for some reason you want to act like resource drops (which were a thing in RS2) is the same as EoC, you do you.
---
Also no point to save them

A bot running 24/7 should not be lasting an entire week. Alarms should be going off after the first 24-48 hours of straight game play. That's like 168 hours. Even if it isn't running 24/7 though 168-200+ hours of play time should be more than enough time to detect these bots imo.
---
aha ye this, since I started raiding my FL fills up quickly :P

You just have bad rng.

I've taught my body to absorb my shit back into my system, shitting is for lazy kids who should be grinding...

he'll never be able to complete the inferno. It's unrealistic, but a fun endgame 'goal' I guess?

Dont you need to kill zuk once to get a zuk task or is jad task the same? If u got 99 slay and pet on 1 kc thats insane but i didnt know it worked like that. Does jad tasks count too?

Imagine completely forgetting that Ironmen exist.

Torvesta is that you?

&gt;Question, what are Jagex's plans for big updates if the Warding poll fails?

????
---
The same thing they have always done? Only put content in the game that passes a poll.
---
Well played.
---
Yea, how can they allow a political parody name?

Except it does.

If you were in a state where diarrhoea persistent for extended time, you'd eventually die.

Can we have the option to toggle off beginner clues?
---
Basically, barrows gloves were op. Void has better accuracy than max str, but max str has higher max hits. If you are against a monster with very high defence (e.g. Graardor) then void is actually better dps. The difference, however, is very slight, and only against high defence monsters. Against medium-to-low defence enemies, void is lower defence and lower dps, so there's no point. 
---
Also, the addition of ferocious gloves and serp helm buff have tipped the scales in favour of max str. Even against high def monsters, void is likely to be lower dps.
---
Yeah its nice seeing the loot posts. Nice to see people grind rng instead of us. Or to say "ha I get better rng than you" or "fuck sake you are so lucky"
---
What bank is that?
---
Lol ty dude.
---
So you're telling me you're not interested to see my 100 kills from zulrah?
---
I guess my phrasing is kind of wonky, but I know this and stated it outright in my last paragraph.
---
If less than 75% of the playerbase likes an idea, then the statement "75% of the player base did not like the idea" is true.
---
Bro u got spare 500k?
---
"75% of the playerbase doesn't like it" *heavily* implies the majority of the players doesn't want it but sure lol
---
F
---
1) Nothing is organised.

2) Having the none-colourful stronghold boots.

You don't do hunter early game, you just quest reward/bird house it.
---
I'm fairly sure this isn't how it works, and is actually a bug to do with Attas seeds and the bottomless bucket.
---
If this was the case, then an ultracomposted herb that lost a life wouldn't have a guaranteed 6 harvests. There have been reports of people only getting 4 herbs from an ultra'd patch when using an Attas seed.
---
The way it works is that ultracompost reduces the chance of it dying by 1/10. That is 1/10 of the base disease chance on any given growth stage. For herbs the base is 26/128, so ultracompost reduces that to 2.6/128 which is rounded down to 2/128 or 1/64, or 1.5625% per stage. Herb patches have 3 chances to become diseased, so with binomial distribution that's a 4.61% chance for a herb patch to become diseased and die when used with ultracompost. 
---
If it worked how you say, then after being saved from becoming diseased once it would be a *lot* more likely to become diseased afterwards, and you would have extremely low yields from herbs. That's simply not how it works.
---
Idk about your specific model but every programmable mouse I’ve had allows me to set pretty much anything to the buttons.
---
Check my comment in response to this, I don't think it's accurate.
---
At level 20 its pretty easy to just pk with magic, you will never leave the rbacket or gain hp xp, its not 'emblem farming' if you are legit killing targets instead of killing yourself on another account

OP said bots were wearing rune items. It's not much but if the kills are easy *shrugs*
---
First attempt is like monster difficulty, every attempt after gets cut in half in terms of effort.
---
Then when you finally beat Jad, the difficulty is cut down to 1/10 of whatever you were experiencing.
---
Think I’m at 1250 or so on my new mouse, feels fine
---
Matt k intentional bad game design
---
Considering you’re only awake for 2/3 of your life... yeah probably. So are the rest of us though :)
---
this was not my character
---
People in other subs play runescape, and people in this sub don't only talk in this sub. Big deal, these posts are just stupid now
---
People finishing school, demand is up probably?
---
forgot to take those out of the loottab, my bad.
---
Implying it's not already.
---
if i'm reading the wiki right, you ARE able to keep ava devices on death, but if it isnt protected, it doesnt drop, just disappears.
---
shitty, time ti invest in more draynor manor tabs.
---
I am
---
It's also super easy to psyche yourself out and react "wrong" cause you anticipated the opposite attack
---

^ shows where his hands go like half a second into the animation even. Ranged has his "paws" expose outward, while mage he tucks his hands in immediately.
---
You gotta pump up those numbers
---
Looked it up, not any changes in the amount traded
---
Do you gain anything for recovering the account? It looks like the username has been removed and using it to play old school you’ll have no stats.
---
You lose nothing starting a brand new account, actually it’ll be more secure crating a new one.
---
I don't know of you can say "this lucky", since there's no luck ay all haha. I know that pain bro
---
Use a DPS calc to figure out which is better for you. For me personally, blessed dhide is better. I use a 5 way switch to torso/b ring/d boots/fire cape/bgs for my specs
---
What movie?
---
Your language skills are amazing for someone 3 months old!
---
Shit, did you lose it?
---
&gt; Your dps is not going to be higher if you increase strength unless it gives you a max hit
---
Yeah I was talking about it assuming that your max hit is increased.
---
Most shops will sell equipment including the Rune (light blue) pieces if you find the right shops.
---
Anything stronger than that youre gonna get from questing or drops from monsters, most equipment in the game as an ironman youre gonna be killing hundreds of the same monster for one equipment drop
---
Bandos/arma/corp/sara. But first get fire cape, zeek ring, fury and barrows gloves. Gonna get fire cape this weekend when i have done a few more herb runs for somw money
---
Wow I hope that's not the requirements seeing those things alone are like 200m+++ total.
---
Oh that doesn't sound like fun
---
You can literally just buy a Scythe though
---
Any inferno account with 10m bank is more impressive than a 20b account since bonds exist
---
Really good guide man, props.
---
i always thought if it might auto download something when u click the link, it still wont run unless after the download u run the program?
---
Don't have rigour yet, that's a 60m extra I'd have to earn (or somehow sell gear/resources to get)
---
Hypothetically speaking let’s say 99 rc is 100ehp. Doing the best rc method would get you 100ehp faster than if you did the worst method, but in the end both people would still have 100ehp.
---
You got it, ima check them out for. Feel free to add my discord.
---
You have to make it yourself
---
XD lmao is it really that terrible??? I guess that Longswords have always been pretty underpowered, although I played RS2 back before Slayer and Monkey Madness were out so Dragon Longs were the way to go back then heheh totally different game nowadays.
---
the classic bait is ask them how much their inferno cape cost, If they act defensive say it makes them guilty and if they try to play it off double down until they get angry which makes them guilty.
---
you can apply this to any situation, get creative.
---
Free money Trihard
---
Thanks! Looks good!
---
Paying for emblems is such a hassle, why not just do wildy slayer? Its fun and isn't relent on other players.
---
Get 80 Hunter
---
Also was debating adding Ancient Staff, but I will likely skip Desert Treasure anyways. Just gonna be training Magic up for Magic Defense, and maybe some random TBs or w/e other nonsense.
---
How about all 99s? I feel like that's a pretty rare one.
---
They don’t manually enter any of the info, it’s done with bots.
---
When you spam clicked that web, I felt that.
---
You are dumb , i should be capable of receiving pms from people whom i don't know which are interested in contacting me without being trackable/annoyed by people i ignore .
---
Forgive him , stubborn people like him can't accept that they are wrong , that's why  he changed from his first argument which was clearly wrong to any other argument just for the sake to make you sound stupid , and feel smart .
---
He is stupid , that's a fact .

I have big balls, I pray nothing and don't use any antifire
---
I got my first fire cape back with garbage stats and gear after multiple attempts a long tome ago. Just did it again for the first time in years with high level gear on a slayer task and crushed it lol I don’t think I even needed to mess with healers but I did anyways. It’s so weird, for so long this stressed me out and last night it felt so easy
---
Runelite
---
How do I do this....emblem farming.
---
shit I might be down to. I'm taking a bit of a break atm but was considering coming back soon.
---
Yea, in all PVP scenarios
---
It's for absorption potions.  If you have one hp the potion only has to absorb 1 damage per hit, rather than whatever a monster would hit normally.
---
don't stop man. I believe
---
plz play u will love it, and dont worry about end game content, will take u forever to reach there
---
Yeah fucker and you can be 'that' guy too if you hop worlds once or twice.
---
Bloodvelds aren't exactly a premium Slayer task with lots of crowding.
---
Anyone else click these and fill out fake details for epic lols?
---
That makes sense
---
KBD and Cerb are examples off the top of my head.
---
That's the best way to do anything.
---
ur trash
---
Nice try Lynx Titan, but you won't get rid of us that easily!
---
Wow that’s awesome, thanks for the tip
---
It's like that when you play in fixed mode. Look for "stretched mode" in runelite plugins and you can fullscreen it. Also make sure you have gpu rendering on or it looks very pixelated when it's stretched
---
Hell yeah. Make it so you have to go get artisan tasks from artisan masters, and your goal is to go somewhere and craft like 100 of an item
---
Post 99 Slayer is 90k/ehp, but considering that you have to get the best task with right methods every time it is unreasonable.
---
I use Caerleon only to sell items, but still not always. Cause some time other cities more profitable. Just check cities auction, whenever you run around it.  
---
For example I collect leather in black zone via Thetford teleport (or territory near Bridgewatch), then craft it in Martlock and sell items or leather in Caerleon.
---

Good?

what
---
But the wrath of the subreddit brings out the crabs
---
I think you need to empty them out first.
---
They really don't, though. Not worth the time invested.
---
imagine being this mentally fragile
---
Do with Slaughter: Nechs, smoke devils, dust devils (all burst), dags, kalphites (cannon).
---
Do with Expeditious: Trolls, suqahs, (cannon both) black dragons (baby), dark beasts, bloodvelds only if you are low on points.
---
Block: Cave kracken, abyssal demons, hellhounds, greater demons, and 2 more weight 8 tasks that suck (gargs, wyrms, drakes, black demons).
---
Skip everything else.
---
She shit with the quickness...
---
You let me know if he gives you anymore trouble
---
Heh, you think you can just comment ‘/rwoosh’ to me kid? 
---
Delete this comment, or else feel my wrath.
---
Dude i was litterally shouting yesss no fucking way yesss shaking lmao forgot how to even read at that point
---
Thanks Thor
---
Pretty sure ded wilson has a 60 minute inferno posted i dont think there are 100k/hr tasks
---
Garbage show, not surprising at all
---
the cape gives rapid heal
---
Congrats on the pet man! And at your first KC in wintertodt too! You lucky pyrophoenix
---
Ive already my quest cape, dont need slayer for vorkath
---
Username checks out
---
Depends on your bolts and what you're using it against. Check with a dps calculator to be sure.
---
Yeah but they can only buy iron items
---
Absolute chad
---
No it wasn’t, he asked what gear he has to buy to get started...
---
Stockpiling for gauntlet?
---
Yeah but make it so the emote can only be used in member worlds
---
or go to colombia or bolivia and get it for $3 haha
---
Correction: Same thing they have always done, sneak in the things they want under the guise of a poll. Then add everything they already worked on with slight changes to future content. 
---
If you don't believe me look at the recent clue scroll expansion, they added a one handed event rpg, and two new BIS's for pures aka the fremmy kilt and the menacles, all three unpolled.
---
High level PvP is not something you can balance with maths like these. It is not like fighting NPC's where all that matters is DPS. The most important thing in PvP is the momentum and combo's you can put out. Also mage damage is heavily increased once someone is brewed down in a fight. None of these stats above have any impact on an actual 1v1 fight in the wilderness.
---
Reeeee, I'm mining sandstone and I keep having to log out
---
&gt; Since it's come up a lot on Reddit lately, could you confirm that emblem farming is against the rules. If it is, how can players report for it?
---
&gt; It is against the rules. We ban for it. You can report for it via tipoff@jagex.com and there also is work behind the scenes on the rulelist as a whole.
---
This shop has to be removed or emblem boosters need to be eradicated.
---
Guthans?
---
Ctrl + click so you run without clicking the run button just saying it.
---

Takes a while to level up like that, a conpitent pker would get a few t10s before theyd be in any danger of players with gear they cant compete with easily

Non-bifurcating integer sequences.

Dear Jagex,

Delete game please

Thanks

The crab meme is bigger than us now
---
There is no alpha way to get 99 slayer.
---
[This is a table for almost 10k Herbiboars](https://i.redd.it/7u0pr4wm61x01.png)
---
Stay 70 or 75 def, and get 90+ str and try to get 94 magic for veng if you can.  70 def is kinda better than 75 if you arent going to pk with 75 def stuff. But it doesnt make a massive difference either way. You should get ur ranged up but its not a requirement. Also 100% get 70 prayer. Best of luck and remember have fun most people forget that one lol. You can do well without being a maximum min max lord.
---
Color bots were used about 10 years ago and it is why dressing in green robes made it possible to lure flax picking bots to giant bats and kill them. Both bot making and detection has improved leaps and bounds since that time so good luck if you think it’s that simple.
---
At current price, Sanguinesti cost almost twice as much as the Swamp trident and 3x for sea
---
Did you make a WT meme?
---
Yes. 
---
What did it cost?
---
Everything.
---
Thanks man
---
What happened? Did you just die the same time? That's heart breaking.
---
Msb (i) with rune arrows is better than rune cbow with broad bolts.
---
about 8% better
---
how do you train magic at higher levels? i’ve been alchung for a while but i’m up in the mid-70s now and it’s getting... dull. is there a better way (for poor players)?
---
Mining req for DS2 62-68 mining making me feel sick.
---
If you look closely there is a lizard stuck in the wall...
---
Its not nearly as relevant as you make it out to be, probably less than 1% of ironmen abuse BH store while 100% of them would abuse NMZ store if Jagex allowed it.
---
Doing diaries. I have the ones I want, just haven't got around to doing the 'useless' ones.
---
You should see the range exp on the ones doing brutal dragons in the catacombs.
---
My comment was sarcastic.
---
No. Mfw is my face when. Tfw is that feel when.
---
As long as your mouse doesn't move in straight lines, doesn't click at the same exact pixels, doesn't click within the same time intervals and takes breaks, it should take long enough to get banned.

You have to be combat 20 to get a emblem.

But muh extra 1 hit. /s

The heal has been far more beneficial than I could ever imagine.

Is it possible to learn this power?

Not from a swampyboi

didn't hide a thing, not even his face.

People are saying that magic is an important part of hybridding and within the same comment saying that dmg is so low its basically bugged. Ironic.

Idc what anyone aays fishing is top 3 worst. All good fish are better obtained through other methods, tick manipulation isnt satisfying or impactful unless ur doing pvp swordfish, like 2nd slowest skill in the game overall. Its a fucking terrible skill. Atleast the trees dont stand up and walk to a new location making for the most inconsistently afk skilling method. Fuck fishing
---
If you have a high enough slayer and desert treasure done, at level 70 you can burst dust devils in the catacombs of kourend, pretty much pays for itself most of the time
---
E🅱️ic
---
Best in slot
---
I'll take anything to improve it, almost all my other skills are 40+, prayer is in the 20s
---
Damn, you’re right. Your gear is probably better then haha
---
D
---
Honest to god, this sounds like an interesting experiment, I could do it but I fear to get my accounts banned :(
---
When I got the pouch on my ironmeme I did it before wildy slayer was a thing. I would up just bullying an alt for a little while and then called it a day. Beats trying to BH PK with a low level iron.
---
Meaning?
---
How else are they supposed to get Jagex customer support?
---
It's the little things that go a long way. Well done, good sir.
---
Ssssh thats a secret

$11

Just hit 96 strength and thought on just getting 99 to get that out of the way.
---
Debating between DHing at NMZ or using a Bludgeon while training slayer?

You should see his depressing Quest Point total

Got dragons? No, got dragon.

The specific units of time (seconds, minutes, etc) may be arbitrary, but time definitely does exist.
---
I dont understand how people have problems with jad, the attacks are so slow. I understand if you miss the first prayer flick but turn sound on
---
Why would the mods care that you didn't secure your account properly?
---
There is a new best defender, but you get it as a drop from raids 2, not from cyclopes
---
yeah you can clearly see that the number of kills skips sequence, what does OP think we are scrubs
---
I had a complex password and didn’t tell anyone. What else could I do?
---
Thanks man! Damn right it did. Working on finishing out the pure now. I know the worst part is still to come, 76-99 strength with a sara sword lmao. I wish I did desert treasure and barraged my mage to 99 though, because if I'm calculating correctly I'll be finishing with 92 HP.
---
Call me Euron ^
---
lmao
---
oh id be pissed
---
2mil? What the heck were you merching? Bronze daggers?
---
I just beat him yesterday after my ~6th time getting to Jad!  Tell him to keep at it!  It'll feel so good when he gets there.  What in particular is he having trouble with?
---
Listen to the rhythmic difference when he first plays the theme then at 0:38-0:40
---
I guess you could call it artistic choice if you want 😂😂
---
I bet you have not done like any quests
---
Just play for 10 more years.
---
Is that a runelite option to get health bars like that?
---
50 red sandcrystals mine per day limit

You’re a god. I revel in your brilliance, lord, and I am not worthy to be in your presence.
---
As an ironman I'd be more than happy with removing logs from monsters. Beyond a chore to fletch them into unstrung bows, then use flax make to get string, then string the bows, then alch them. Also adds some use to woodcutting, as it's perhaps the most useless skill on ironman.
---
Seems to be my only option
---
Maybe the mobile data isnt stable in your area.
---
he wasnt replying to the code, he was replying to the guy saying he doesnt know where to start.
---
Posting this for everyone to see is the opposite of what I’d want to do, honestly
---
Legit my biggest fear when doing Chaos ele
---
Can you stop trying to steal my boyfriend. I know he slept with your dog but please it is not my fault
---
That is a fact, but I am on Wi-fi with mobile data turned off now.
---
When I killed Jad I had em in a congo line only tanking 2, it was like a month ago too
---
Finishing MM2 for the quest cape. I really hate the quest.
---
I’ll relay the message! I think he just gets confused with the prayer and style from focusing too hard. We’re trying to work with him, but he’s had some genuine close calls!
---
I have a fire cape and I'm wondering what tears of guthix does for it as well...
---
My Wifi can do literally anything besides play runescape mobile
---
It gets your rc up
---
Message me on here later, I will refund you the 2m.
---
In the mean time please make sure your account is secure and your computer is clean.
---
Have a bank pin   
---
Have your authenticator enabled  
---
Use an email that you only use for rs and nothing else  
---
Have an authenticator on said email   
---
Don't click on phishing links  
---
The complexity of your password is meaningless, your email was probably leaked or you put your info to a fake twitch stream.
---
Idk about much higher but it's better than rune cbow and rune bolts vs nearly every monster I checked on a dps calculator. 360s and jad, zulrah mage phase, ahrim, chaos fanatic, every revenant I checked. It seems kind of underrated to me
---
It's already there and you can visit with a holiday item!
---
Can you please not offend him. He’s worked very hard on this account and with my support will be one of the most famous runescape players ever.
---
If I drop something in the wildy, can I run back and pick it up before someone else gets it if I am being pked?
---
Indeed, it goes against the spirit of ironman! It's on par with using alts to tank bosses for you or the duel arena bug that made you able to stake your main.
---
My oppinion does not matter however, it's just something I know by following all the Q&amp;As, discussing stuff like this ingame and reading all the newsposts. It's really hard to find sources for stuff like this, but it has come up a bunch of times. 
---
As for downvoting his replies, I did that afterwards since I don't appreciate passive aggressive downvoting when you're having a conversation with someone. I also don't like being treated like I'm his enemy.
---
Not sure if srs but. You still have to do mm1, and getting emblems for a scim takes longer than getting 100k
---
Not a whole lot I can do to help you in that case. Maybe this has the solution: https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207344375-Common-Connection-Solutions-
---
Something tells me your cat clicked. I’ve afked in vork for like 15 minutes while I was on the phone. And he didn’t wake up.
---
:P
---
You’ve done amazing babe so proud of you! &lt;3
---
I’ve been hacked for 100m pls help me
---
I never put my email or password anywhere. That’s why I’m confused. I don’t use twitch and I don’t do the “buy real gold” stuff. But all good ideas, thanks
---
Dang. I should’ve reached out to you before it got posted. Thanks for lookin out though I really appreciate it!
---
To add on to what Unexie said (Which is 100% correct, questing is absolutely the best way to start out a new account), you'll probably want to look into birdhouse runs and herb runs ASAP. These two combined will be your best moneymaking methods until the late/end game and will more than pay for everything you need in the mean time (Including membership, if the monthly fee isn't ideal for your current IRL financial situation)
---
I’ll change my password and use an authentication
---
Could someone link me to the original post please? I can't find it and fancy a laugh.
---
Thanks sweetie. Without your support IRL and in game I wouldn’t be here.
---
Give or take
---
I appreciate you. Not all of us are elitists, trust.
---
Good. I'm at work just now but don't worry I got you friend.
---
Omg what about that idiot who was posting every day for about a week complaining about Drew G?  He was fucking annoying
---
You’re not making a better case for yourself, you know.
---
Anyone else getting booted the second they stop doing something productive? I'm not even getting a countdown. The second I stop fishing, I get logged out.
---
Thanks for the support man! 😁👌
---
I don't need a fucking "case" from you
---
Gtfo.
---
Username checks
---
The problem is it's not really cheating if it's there to use.
---
Nobody is going to use 1250 slayer points to get a rune pouch if it's so easily obtained elsewhere.
---
Same goes for paying clans to get you a fighter torso, or back when you had to pay for the blast furnace CC.
---
They should have implemented a way around emblem boosting if they have a problem with it.
---
You are amazing.
---
Literally go to the basement and splash on spiders lol
---
I guess it just takes practice! It’s one of the best “coming of age” kills on runescape! Keep on keeping on! ❤️
---
This isn't a limitation they imposed on themselves, what are you talking about?
---
2 planks (depends on what clue type u can google it, hammer, saw, and 10 nails are needed). There are rocks and bushes and crates near clue sites (equip x item and do an emote steps). After buulding stashes you can store the required itemd in them so you wont need to bank to do those steps again
---
Yeah, my mistake sorry.
---
I was more leading towards a keris upgrade or some other useful unique, the recolour is the only reason I even started killing kq though
---
You must've swapped to an Australian server by accident.
---
No. Again, that's not what ehp is.
---
I don't get it 😯
---
I think ill enjoy the game more by not emptying my wallet to play it tbh.
---
I mean dpi is just a matter of preference haha, I use 1200 but I don't think there is a right answer. 
---
For bankstandinf skills I will sometimes remap right click to escape so you don't need to use your left hand at all
---
I just tried this and there was no option for claiming a chef's hat. Maybe this is because i've started RFD though, because the only options i get when talking to him are questions about the frozen guests. Reading through all the options, the chef seems to think i have completed RFD, which i definately have not. So there seems to be a little bug. Hope this gets fixed because i actually don't have acces to a chef's hat either.
---
cc: jeisuru
---
A keris upgrade would be neat if it were BIS against kalphites
---
Idk, but this is stressing me out super hard, so I'm going to delete my replies here before I'm going to have to make my 6th account 😕
---
I actually have a rune dragon alt with lance/justiciar, and imo that is the best setup. If it's not an alt and you're actively engaged then bandos yeah. If alt, then justiciar for sure. Also if you're in bandos, fighter hat is better dps than neitz. As is ardy 4 over fire cape.
---
Wow that’s crazy. I did 5.2k for pet but I had easily 10 of each rare during the process; no mutagens tho, and pet at 5.2k.
---
So its pathetic to ask for help? You sound like the biggest loser "stop askin for help...stop asking for help prgressing in a game you lost everything in...". Ya im not gonna stop aaking for help just cause some loser told me to
---
me as a zerker when stole is required
---
just got 70 attack. Think it would be worth it to get 75 before going for the 99 strength? I'm on the fence about it. Just not completely sure how much the 5 levels will really help my accuracy in the long run
---
If you're thinking of the method where you bind QWER or ASD/LKJ to fletch darts at rapid speeds it should be fine. It's using mouse keys and 1:1 remapping so rule-wise it should be okay. Nobody has been banned for it either.
---
you do you, if you can't handle a discussion on here why even comment my guy. anyways have a good day sir.
---
Up to 600+ kc and this is my worst fear
---
Yeah really lame that a whip beats keris in dps against kalphites
---
Always, always, always check your in game inbox when in doubt.
---
Also, maybe go ahead and change your email address. Make sure your bank pin is enabled and set. Make sure you have 2FA on your RS account and anything you've linked to your RS account.
---
This is almost certainly a scam. Get ahead of it. Somebody knows your email address so expect more phishing in the future.
---
Well the info you’re providing isn’t correct. And you’re the dummy who forgot his email password why is that Jagex’s problem?
---
&gt;its no inferno
---
enjoy your vanilla max cape then
---
Zerk and it's not close
---
Eff yall
---
Where did the equipping to get the equipment effect meme start?
---
Aw you lost everything? Aka pixels in a video game hahahahahah stop being so pathetic kid. 
---
To make money back you just play the game... You idiot.
---
When you say "not gonna stop asking for help", what you mean is "not gonna stop asking for sympathy donations from rich players"
---
this physically hurts to look at
---
&gt; range and stand in melee distance
---
Yes if using a antifire shield.
---
Avoidant personality disorder. I can handle and love discussions, but I get panic attacks from being personally attacked... it's not about you, just thought it'd be polite to mention before deleting my replies.
---
It's how I live my life. What type of person deliberately shits on someone's happiness for literally no reason and no gain? This is the case of most people who interact with others in gaming communities. Mostly toxicity.
---
That’s like saying level 2 in any stat is end game if it’s your last stat...
---
bruh
---
I’m so high I looked at this and said out loud: “when the fuck did we get granite pickaxes”
---
I'm in my paypal looking at the runescape transactions, the info I provided is correct lol
---
Oh totally, I just was lazy af and wore everything I needed for the clue lol
---
&gt; Some of these types of email do have a real Jagex email address as the 'from' address
---
It'll show in the message headers. They either won't have a legitimate email address ("From Spoofing") or they won't have a legitimate sending mail server ("Server Spoofing" I guess).
---
Regardless, most email providers should be picking this shit up if they have basic SPF checks.
---
Once you get some money for law runes, go telegrab wines of zamorak and sell them.
---
Well yeah. No one here is expecting to earn a PhD playing RuneScape. We know damn well that all reward is virtual... just like in every other game.

If it makes you happy playing, who cares that you’re wasting time? Most hobbies are a waste of time.

impressive way of getting 99 congrats dude

I forgot my email password as I don't remember it in the first place since I use a randomised string of numbers, letters and symbols for all emails I own

I see, but you do realize this is an anonymous forum. No one knows who you are IRL so I'm not sure how you could get offended.
---
...I legit did not know this, and I appreciate knowing this now.

Each player plays the game in a unique way (clicking on the mininap vs walking on screen, switching tabs with f keys vs clicking them, checking xp left with client or hovering over the skill, etc). Publicly written bots can only match these things for so many people. You get a large group of people acting differently from their normal playstyle and acting similar to each other, is a pretty obvious sign people are using a script to play. Writing your own script that acts exactly as you do but playing for extended periods of time probably won't get you banned at all. But that's just my opinion on botting and detection, could be full of shit could hit the nail on head.
---
Sad but true. People can’t just let others be happy
---
I was looking up Hey Jase actually lmao
---
Yeah, it's not rational!
---
Is it better to use black/blessed dhide or elite void for KBD?
---
Yeah that makes sense, the only thing that made me question is was the URL they ask to copy and paste rather than click on looks legit. Obviously if you had the actual email rather than a screenshot you could easily check the link

Everyone talks about Jad's feet with regards to the "slam" for ranged, or the "dangle" for mage.  But there's actually a quicker way to tell which attack he's going to use based on his feet.
---
When Jad ranges, he always picks up his right foot (on our left, looking at him) before his left.  In comparison, when he mages both feet come up at the same time.  Might give your friend an extra tell to look for!

Got a Blue Dragon task so figured I could get 70 agility.
---
Oh that’s right, I forgot about that. I still don’t use the scroll book primarily because of my teleport tab organization lol
---
Lmao I don't and would never, it's just interesting coz I didn't realise they shared since there was obviously no reason for me to ever own more than one at a time
---
Just melee it, learn the rotations by heart
---
Watch out for this guy's credit card
---
Man I remember I checked mine a little while back I was at 45 days played out 91. I thought that was a lot, but you my friend are insane lmao good progress though
---
Ironmen are a non-issue, they don't affect the economy and they're only ruining it for themselves and it's a piss in a bottomless bucket compared to what Sir Pugger have shown us. Personally I got a T1 through slayer and upgraded it in W18 to a T10 to get the pouch, msb(i) and saved the rest of the points for cosmetics / spare pouch if I die.

It's the same with Zulrah. I died like 50-75 times before I got my first kill, but after the first one I would only die every 1 out of maybe every 25 kills.

asking about endgame stuff before even starting to play is like trying to run a marathon before you understand how to walk.

I think the color edge would fit in great with the armor though. I mean rune zammy armor is all edged in red, so I think by doing the same with the blade in a similar style would look pretty awesome cohesion wise.

Goin for firecape again. Failed twice a little while back. First time was a lag and second time I got distracted by healers. I'm pretty confident I can beat him this time because I'm able to use BP now and I'm going to try the chin route. I just haven't felt like sinking 2hrs into for that off chance I fail again. Might try this weekend.

rng rewards sucks, but it makes sense to incorporate a high lvl con req.

at your level, dangerous and not overly fun.

most everything in the game is profitable in some way, to different degrees of course. google osrs moneymaking, the wiki has different methods listed with the requirements and the approximate profit rates.

Honestly don’t know. Hardware is hardware. Major differences will be all the bloatware (if you don’t replace the boot drive, but you should). Keyboard, trackpad, screen. That type of thing. Any big brands should be alright. I would suggest a desktop, but that’s just my preference 🤷‍♂️

They actually spend tons of time out in the wilderness. I remember fighting framed on my zerk 2 months ago and I just saw myself in his video yesterday. If you spend a lot of time in the wilderness, these things happen. I used to camp crazy arch and some guy tele’d in to the bandit camp in full slayer gear to do a hard clue step. I got around 15m off him in gear and 30k cballs
---
That's what all liars say, as we've learnt from even the top brass of the gaming industry such as Randy Pitchford of Gearbox, and I'm afraid that trying to pin the blame on me for being a 'masculine' man isn't going to do you any favours Jadeine, though the proof is in the evidence that can speak for itself.
---
Just like GameInformer isn't trying to 'ruin' Randy Pitchford's career by 'fucking him over', I'm just here to state the facts and let people know, unless you don't want them to? :)
---
Only that I am stating a fact that I know the person behind the account, funny how that can come off as intimidating but that's the world we live in today I suppose! At least I came out of this with my integrity intact whilst yours, I suspect, was never there to begin with. :P
---
Alright we'll tell them to go fuck themselves instead then eh?
---
Ever pked for more than like 14 minutes? I get kills all the time where people are doing stupid shit life this lol.  It's probably not staged, there is just legit players that do stupid shit
---
Fuck off. I’ve been depressed myself in the past. I know it’s not much but sometimes a stranger saying something nice even if generic can help you get through the day. You’re just a twat, at least I’m trying to help even though it might be shallow I don’t know enough about this persons life to give any actual real help.

It just doesn’t make any sense. It’s not a vital change or anything, just a quality of life thing. Either side can go with or without it so there is no reason to compromise. And there should NOT be a compromise because the pvp and pvm communities are not mutually exclusive. There are some people that enjoy playing the whole game that cannot make any use of these updates for what reason?
---
Damn he's thicc
---
What would count as a day then? Would it reset at midnight, and count as two days? You also have to consider time zones.
---
If you want a reasonable way to train it pretty quickly, barraging in mm2 tunnels is great XP, or sacrifice some XP and burst nechs in the catacombs to save some money. A more unreasonable but faster method is to 1t enchant bolts, it can be significantly more XP per hour but it's also significantly more expensive and intensive. 
---
If you just want to passively work on training mage, bringing high alch or magic imbue pretty much everywhere you go will let you get nonstop low XP/hr as you do other stuff.

I must have messed something up a while ago, because my og account only has my stats in RS3. Don't really want to grind again.

Well im kinda noob when it comes to anything related to wilderness/pvp situations. My only survival guide myself is "maximize magic resistance so you freeze wont hit so often" and only hope they dont hit high damages with range/melee

While I'm nowhere near as cynical about these things, it does get tiring in the same way seeing predictable/reposted memes. I'm certainly not about to make a post complaining about it, but a filter would be appreciated

or add the other gods

Also everyone knows you do more damage in PvP if you're a black female
---
Oowee theres a lot going on here.
---
Lance, dhcb, buckler, dwh, torture, anguish, ahrims, occult, torm, swamp trident, blowpipe. Those are the minimum things I’d personally go for. If you feel like it I’d go for arma, otherwise god dhide is fine. Same thing for ancestral and ahrims. Prims and pegs are really nice but you’ll be fine with dboots and dhide boots.
---
I don't know if it's just on the subreddit or not but are there any new player guides out there? The game is pretty overwhelming.

I find it fine when the OP does it in the image, but I'm pretty tired of the top comment being "Didn't blur your nat stack, gg account". It's literally the same joke as in the OP

What'd you think of BB. Best show of all time imo

ah ok, thanks!

Dang lol. Better than no kc at all I suppose :p

Do people actually struggle with thus joke of an afk boss? Lol. Even the Inferno's become a joke now with all of the guides out.

they still lock down 2k total worlds at revs making hundreds of mills a day. =(

Good luck lol

You can do the math yourself, but I don't mind seeing a reddit post about it. Even if it's basic, they're sometimes informative vs someone just posting their levelup message

Yeah it’s a very nice serie, best show for me is the walking dead

I have torture, anguish, ahrims, occult, torm, swamp, bp, god dhides

Edgeville spawn point &gt;&gt; House tab &gt;&gt; Wildy Hard &gt;&gt; Obelisk to the Chaos Ele spot might barely get you there if you're efficient with the clicks. However, in such a stressful situation it would be highly difficult.

---
Found your vid on my recommended list. Subbed and liked, all my respect goes to you, you big brain.
---
1. in runescape almost everything is useful, and exists to be useful at some point in time. Especially for ironmen
---
2. your progression is very nonlinear and if you properly build a bank, even less than best in slot items have usage. For instance, one of the best ranged weapons in the game is unlocked at lvl 61 ranged, the rune crossbow. It's usefulness is tied to its ability to use cheap broad bolts for slayer, another skill that allows you to grind and unlock bonuses like that. This weapon, despite being less than the best, is still very good, and provides excellent economic usage.
---
3. PVM progression exists for multiple skills and multiple setups. You can have BIS strength training gear, or grind up BIS gear for slayer, or BIS gear for KBD etc. Lots of things are useful lots of places!
---
Lol now you're just being rude. Other games give much better value for the money, so I play those instead.
---
How about keeping the same boost but leaving it at max for X minutes? Like an overload but if your stats get drained they don't go back up
---
insufferable. shut it back down plz
---
I always bring a stack of purple sweets to the wild to make sure I’m not out of food
---
I didn’t say it wasnt. Just that it wasn’t as big as I expected from rs3
---
A lot of people seem to forget that pking is fun and that the incentive isn't always to make absolute BOINK. I don't care if you are defenceless. If you are running around in wildy, I'm going to try to kill you even if I lose money.
---
I mean, you do you, but imo you wasted hours simply by not spending 3m on a whip.
---
I guess if you enjoyed those hours it's not wasted but those are hours you could have spent doing something other than afk str training. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I get the best in slot part, but what does non mean?
---
I disagree, it's interesting to see when people created their first acc
---
In my opinion Hard clues should have a chance of obtaining an Elite Clue, not a Master Clue.  Some people, like myself can do most steps of an elite, but not most of a Master.  Out of the 20 Master Clues I've gotten I completed like 2 of them.

Honestly my mans getting mad fashionscape points for this look

Imagine spending money you could use on slayer for construction

go play them then. tbh dividing up hobbies by "value for the money" is pretty autistic. if you dont wanna play get lost plain and simple. the game is extremely affordable and if you really cant afford it theres an in game alternative

You are right though. I can understand that first couple attempts can be scary, you might be nervous and just missclick a lot or be generally unprepared, but failing it like 14 times? I genuinely would like to see the video how you can fail the same thing 14 times in a row.

Dont I need fossil island for that?

Log in to the account on mobile and go to account settings next to friends list i believe. Havent done it myself but im confident your problem can be solved through there.

I'm pretty sure the bot posts every single variation of a word. So settle, settled, settler, settlers, etc.

Except that mage pray literally does nothing.
---
Dumb idea, no subscription plan on the planet does that. If you don't have the time to put into the game it's not a game for you, don't stress this much over it.

BIS means best in slot and this post is in reference to some guy who got the infernal cape and posted it in reddit, then a day or so later made another reddit post saying Jagex should remove non best in slot cape from merging with the max cape.

DYUDE!

That's gonna be a yikes from me. How big is your fedora collection? Could you teach me about atheism?

It's just annoying because I've personally been through it. When a ton of people tell you it's going to get better but do nothing else, you can tell they just want to feel good about "helping" someone when they didn't do shit. It takes 0 effort to tell someone to get better, it shows that you care and you're invested in the person if you let them vent to you, or you actually help them with their issues.
---
It is for lynx. He only ever did the most efficient methods. So it's 3t granite, vs lava's

Oh that makes a lot more sense. Very impressive to get fire cape with such low stats nonetheless.

I would wager the drop rate of a packed clue book is about 1/2000.  That's from my personal anecdotal experience.

Still worth

Endgame in osrs isn't remotely comparable to WoW or any other MMOs. You likely won't make it there without several breaks or giving up altogether. It will take you over 500 hours (and that's generous) to get the stats and money required to efficiently play endgame content. Osrs endgame is about setting grindy goals, like finishing maxing a skill or getting certain items or a certain amount of kills of some boss. 
---
There is also no linear endgame progression, it's not like WoW where you get better gear for doing harder content (people who haven't played wow will disagree/downvote but it's true, getting an inferno cape is not the same as farming high m+ or mythic raids on farm). If you're looking for something where skill will set you apart, get into NH pking or high tier pvm with self-imposed restrictions. 
---
I'm not discouraging you from trying to get into osrs because I love this game too, but you can't come in with the same mindset as a top percentage WoW player or you will be disappointed.
---
I bought the merch move over
---
Rendi just put out his lvl 18 combat fire cape video.
---
Max Strength gear is always better than Void. In the dps calculator, there is no scenario where Void gives better dps. Not even if you put the enemy defense bonuses to 9999999, which is far more than any enemy in the game. The extra accuracy is so slight its worthless versus the extra damage, no matter the defence of the enemy.

You should have an ornate pool, fairy ring/tree, tele nexus, and ornate jewelry room as close as possible

Things have been better since I staked everything, lost, and quit. Zero urge to come back bc I know it's just a nostalgia trap. Been using my time on actual hobbies and dating, and I no longer feel like I'm wasting valuable time in my life. 10/10 would quit again

Not the ones I named, but alt store trading is also fundamentally not playing the game as a solo player. NMZ doesn't have this problem, Jagex just decided that Ironman mode also needed an unwritten code of ethics that nobody can decide on.

all scroll books share teleports, a lot of people open caskets in wildy and get the book, even if there other book is at bank they drop all scrolls, i often get pks of scrolls, geting cash stacks is not that uncommon or tons of teleport runes, people are lazzy to bank items.

Pretty sure you camp range if you're going by sounds as the sound for ranged plays later than mage. for me i played with sound off and camping mage was alot easier.

Arguably, survivorship bias is what the people on the botter forums experience when they talk about what they do to avoid getting banned. Toupee fallacy is what us experience when we see all these bots around. Chances are good you see bots all the time you don't even think are botting because they are written quite well. You *notice* those 24/7 pyramid plunder bots, you're far less likely to notice the PC bot that actually runs and kills gates, does farming runs, then logs out after a few hours.

It's weird how some people are willing to spend hundreds if not thousands of hours on this game but when they lose 5mins to a wildy death they lose their goddamn mind.

You have a funny feeling like you're being memed on.

Dude, people got angry with me because I followed them with an Mime Mask and green hair repeating lines from Joker. It's really not surprising that people get mad about something ruining their training, lel.

this is giving me anxiety

Valid question, no idea though.

I think it's explicitly because they're frustrated at a minor inconvenience. Minor inconveniences are always the ones that piss people off the most, especially when it's a conscious decision by someone else.

I don't think I've ever seen anyone at Jagex claim that the 3 combat styles are supposed to equalize in dps.
---
The only problem with magic is that magic level and defense are calculated in magic defense. (Should just be def, so 99 magic / 1 Def characters aren't absorbing all your teleblocks.
---
Yeah i can agree with that, never do encounter that myself since i don't cannon much.
---
13 is pretty easy for pking. with 1 you dont even need to bother with prayer which can  make it easier but without a 1 prayer firecape you would be at a slight disadvantage.
---
31 would be more worth it with 60 attack because you dont really need protect item for your gmaul
---
I always wonder how that first redditor who found the courage to actually put together a proper post about their gripes feel when they see their format being reposted mockingly all over this sub. I'd give 1 gf to see their initial expression

Agreed.

damn got me

This post would get more attention if the gifs and pictures were in an imgur album so they would be easier to look up.
---
As for the actual content, they're all nice except for the private party room. It would be used for scamming unless they made it so that only the house owner would be able to deposit items.
---
Kinda interested, how good is lance at kbd? Compared to like DHCB?
---
You interrupted their pornhub time DUDE

1 prayer fire cape sounds ridiculous lmao. At 60 atk you use dds with what?
---
Weird flex but okay?

Did you though? No chat raises my suspicions

Giving away gf

YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
---
I know almost nothing about EoC but don't their protect spells not negate 100% of the damage? wouldn't this make the extended stages really hard for them since they have to take damage?
---
Help him.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head there. Because yes no matter what you read, if your objective is to get offended, you will get offended. Which makes connotation super important.  You can’t control the readers predisposed feelings. You can control weather or not you use words or phrases that have negative connotations.

why are splashers such brainlets? you can splash on almost any other monster in the game and this won't happen to you

The next step if you're at that point is just to start fighting back. It's how a lot of people actually learn to PK. Just bring rune gloves, black d'hide, climbing boots, MSB with amethyst arrows and a g maul. If you're already using a clue box, it's worth it. You'd be surprised how easy it is to stack out a guy in robes who's focused on trying to barrage you. Get a taste for it, and you'll never go back.
---
congrats. i'm 200k away from 86 and i really enjoyed it from 77 onwards. slow skill but really chill. not gonna touch it after karamja elites though, unless i wanna heavily afk

Lava 130k with 3 runners and astral around 90k with 3 runners. Tho at astrals you make back over 500k per runner per hour in runes you craft pre 82 and post 82 over 1m gp back per hour per runner.
---
How dare you, zeah rc is a gift!!
---
yeah i agree, just re code the entire game to a new language, cant be that much work right?
---
Repost this Friday afternoon it’s fuckin good
---
It might be due to internet connection. I know lately I’ve been getting disconnected a lot even though I have a signal.
---
Copyright law is Exodia. Which will obliterate this idea.
---
very good!!
---
No, my dad is mod Ash and he said they are bringing out a new metal dragon

This happens when I open the app, I’m not disconnecting from the game.

I think a desert raid would be a good opportunity to incorporate boss prayer mechanics (among others) like you have to whittle down the bosses prayer points by surviving long enough (only pray when being attacked?) or smiting them. 
---
EG:
---
Ra - prayer boss, must switch prayers, attack styles, and smite prayer.
---
Slifer - 2 phase boss, must clip wings with range or maybe in arena skilling (building a special balista while avoiding attacks?), then fight with reduced prayer mechanics like demonics
---
obelisk - high defense, high strength, can only survive by removing defenses (specific attack styles on different armor pieces? idk this one isn't that interesting)
---
It's not that magic is strong, it's that Range armor is sufficient enough to cover any defense needed.
---
Can I get some "too lazy, did not watch" cliffs
---
This is like the 8th one I’ve seen today all saying remove all non bis games
---
Exactly, plus I wouldn't actually consider anyone maxed a "casual" player whether they played at a casual rate or not. If you're maxed you're a dedicated player lol.
---
Will check it out
---
Why does everyone forget about Seren?
---
Idk if youre out of the loop or im just getting whooshed but thats a real xp drop from completing an inferno task
---
People still play this game?
---
If it's a pvp area why do they keep cramming non-pvp content into it?
---
Try jumping into the other room. I waited for like 15 min, then jumped into the other teams room and instantly got in
---
I’ve been waiting for an electric staff since I was a kid because of this
---
Spiders and human Npc's everywhere
---
What the fuck is Eurons ranged level he killed a dragon bigger than Galvek with like 3 ballista shots? Thats got to be like 100+ damage per hit?
---
There's pkers in every bracket so don't worry too hard. Plus you're only really risking like 100k so just go for it and have fun.
---
Can't you just get another scroll book and they'd still be in it?
---
I appreciate your commentary
---
Do you offer your services IRL? I need people to know I'm a true gamer and I'm getting tired of telling people about how bad Anthem is.
---
Sounds like you're the kind of toxic person I aim to avoid. Just because you have no life doesn't mean others cant enjoy this game.
---
Yah I pk for the fun of it and the loot is just extra :p 
---
I remember playing games like wow in warsong gulch for hours on end just fighting people for no real reason. (Pvp rewards were shit at the time and I was already GM lol)
---
What level would it be good to get smite at?

---
Thanks bud.
---
I got it at kbd 2014/15 went for 16 mil

Yeah I'd love that. I'm chilling at home on the couch but don't feel like watching a video atm
---
Maybe he just doesn't want to talk to you, ever think of that, asshole?
---
All of them, or just one?
---
Down with the patriarchy!
---
Token nice
---
Idk, havent been on demonic gorillas for while but thats prolly still there
---
Not exactly. If you get it as a loot and die you won't lose anything, but if you place a tele scroll into it then it instantly shares storage with your main scroll back in the bank
---
i considered that, but i don’t think so. i was still getting hit standing in the middle of the stepping stone path between the red and steel drags, so unless there’s anything else in that area that was hitting me with magic (idk what the shades’ attack looks like but i saw some of them wandering around down there) then i don’t know what was going wrong.
---
Strange flaunt but affirmative
---
Theres no reason to learn anything, just switch prayer and gear accordingly and dont stand in green shit
---
I dont want to play a game where the only thing devs care about is making short term profit. I saw that countdown on the RS3 subreddit. Tell me the the RS3 aren't short termed money whores (even though it may be up to fukong)
---
RS3 is just so heavily monetized, that not paying for MTX is just too disadvantageous
---
after MM2 and 60 hunter. Maniacal monkeys with runelite monkey plugin + banana baskets = Woodcutting like AFK hunter for decent xp. Source: Did 60-99 hunter there, was easy as fuck.
---
If you enjoy killing people for the sake of killing people when they dont have anything, you're an asshole. If you enjoy killing people in hopes that they have something, that's fair
---
Waste of points if you're not a hcim or late game UIM. You need those points to maintain high ehp slayer exp rates skipping bad task. Wildy slayer gets you points and BH points for the pouch. So you can progress to things like herb sack much quicker.
---
an addy scim pure? xd
---
Early ironman wouldn't have glory.
---
Also kind of anecdotal but on my own ironman I hit piety before I had a glory.
---
But one thing you should keep in mind is that BiS strength over anything else also assumes you're doing perfect flicks. If you don't flick at all, tank gear is suddenly valuable, hence why I intend to wear torag/dharok/verac legs over obby legs on my own ironman, when I get them.
---
what u/Mice_And_Men said :) do a little research on some guides and just have fun with it :) be excited when your script does even the smallest thing, and try not to get too frustrated when it doesn't work.
---
I paid 124 😬
---
You should be fine to pray melee in melee range. But I could be mistaken. 
---
The super should protect you fully from his dragon fire, but he has 3 unique breathes that will only at max get reduced down to like 10dmg. 
---
Go try it and find out. If his special attacks still hit high, then you know it doesn't work.
---
so just dont die? great advice.

rot basically killed the clan scene because of taking shit irl, and then you have other clans that followed.  The fact that rot took it so far as to actually taking peoples accounts and cleaning them out who the hell in their right  mind whats to deal with that on a daily basis?  Believe me, you can deal with getting ragged, having your information taken and leaked is not just a light offense.
---
devalues my 30m bank loss from dragon hunter lance tanking in price
---
How did he get the points for skips and unlocks
---
Log into your account on the website and check if the email changed. The email should say your player's display name in the email so I would say this is fake.
---
To add to this, making the bars into dart tips or nails usually adds another 100-150gp/bar and is a slightly less click-intensive activity.
---
Getting the money to pay for them can be argued as part of the time. No they arent quick they are just buyable
---
tele grab it
---
Try praying mage
---
Probably forgot he had them on since they're not visible on the player model. Literally the only explanation I can think of tbh
---
He did Wildy Slayer with cannon + Craws bow
---
..... the higher the confidence level the smaller the variance mate

Lmao might want to read what you type before posting it to make sure it’s actually legible. But either way, if you think anyone is “disadvantaged” your idea of the game is pretty warped and not worth trying to argue with. You seem to just hate rs3 cause you want to hate it.
---
Huh, I actually could have afked that instead of 200m fishing. Lol maybe I'll go on that when I get back to maxing on osrs.
---
Stay in your lane man.

My password is such a pain in the ass to type that I've largely given up on mobile because of this. Oh well.
---
I was where you were at 6 months ago. I decided to do Vorkath because it's easier than Zulrah. Also, it's the next best boss that you can do solo without a Slayer requirement.
---
Start grinding quests and skill to make your first 20mil. From there you can learn vork and make 1mil per hour. Then once you hit 110m, buy dragon hunter crossbow and make 2.5m per hour. Getting to 200m on Vorkath from where your at now including questing shouldn't take more than 250 hours if you push hard. That's not really that much time either.
---
Rip avernic defender hilt
---
It's time.
---
Or you could just do like 1 suqah task and bank the teeth for spirit tree payments?
---
My bank is worth 90m on my ironman and I've been playing the account for 5 months.

And I'm not exactly going for high money making methods.

---
He doesn't want to talk to you.
---
I've seen that suggestion several times in the subreddit in the past, and I don't remember it ever getting opposed so much. I'd support it just because the fire max cape is ugly as sin. Lol the meme is alright solid though.
---
Imagine training rc via abyss instead of lavas or zmi.
---
weird fact: one of the 4 spiders in the basement can always be killed regardless of whether someone is hitting it. I have no idea why but every time i bank ill try to kill it lol
---
Sorry but in order to make room for BIS we have to remove BJS  ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
My account is back to tutorial island but my account is still on the leaderboards.  I only have 1 email. Not in deadman.
---
You being penalized is a mindset, not an actuality. Sure it's pretty shitty that people can get huge xp advances because they chose to spend money, but at the end of the day, their choice makes no legitimate difference to your account or gameplay.
---
I play both games, I enjoy both, MTX is annoying, and of course I wish it wasn't so prevalent, but I understand that there are always going to be players that are ahead of me, due to MTX or otherwise, so it's really not that big of an issue for me, choosing not to partake.
---
? It's not hard to make a 126, you can literally 20 minute afk every combat skill except for prayer which is borderline useless in pvp above 77
---
Oof, sorry friend.  
---
Reminds me of when I got a champions scroll from fire giants in wild and was immediately pk'd

I mean.. have you done it? I recently did it and even with the guide, the puzzle was incredibly tedious. Like, 1 single mistake, you waste 30mins and have to restart. It was way worse than ME2.

Did you switch from mobile to PC?
---
It is a reasonable question when you look at it from the perspective of a player who has played more traditional MMOs. With those kind of games you aim to get to end game pretty fast. It's not really applicable to OSRS.. but for someone who doesn't know that it makes sense to be looking for a new MMO based on what the endgame is.
---
Why u do curtis dirty like that?
---
They are reported constantly and not banned or the throw away bots are just re made straight away
---
Are they bad over there too? I only see the ones at the ore shop in Jatizso and they're actually running free.
---
Nice switch btw, haHAA.
---
If you want a change of pace you can try running essence, it's 4.5m/h for astrals and 8m/h for lavas. It's very intensive though
---
Great marketing, Starbucks.
---
Got all the GoT people talking about this “mistake.” Nice
---
Yeah you wonder where all this toxicity comes from, then there's people like you who willingly spread it
---
This is a good one
---

I think it's also possible missuse of the tweet.  If they let it stay up next thing a bunch of white nationalists are retweeting it or crying about a double standard.
---
I’ll never get high then that... too damn hard
---
Step 1. Train cat to high alch
---
Step 2. ?????
---
Using a rcb then is fine. I've done it before, but its just slower and requires slightly more skill. Some people prefer a rcb over a bp at Jad because you have a lot more range for the healers and its harder to get into melee range. Make sure you use diamond bolts (e), especially on jad and on anything that is actually damaging you like a ranger when the mager isn't safe spotted.
---
I would give this attempt your best shot. Probably just regen, then keep going depending on how much you value your time lol. Practice is the only way to clear the caves. You might even go all the way!
---
Zeah rc is basically mining with extra steps
---
Nmz
---
Cast (make sure you splash) level 80 stun on an npc, then alch and repeat. Can do it with 76 magic if you boost with a magic pot. I did it in the wizards tower
---
I feel like there should be a brainlet version of the dumbasses who brings bank in wildy.
---
His ballistae were made with T bows
---
You got any info about that? 4.5 and 8m sounds like a fking ton
---
Voting yes can confirm have a small penis
---
I think steve is only preferred if you aren't gonna burst AND you wanna cannon the most tasks possible, but with bursting and a proper blocklist, duradel wins across the board for xp/pts/gp (unless you can do konar hydra). You'd also need western elite to make the points even and doing konar every 10th is a good idea so you can skip more shit tasks
