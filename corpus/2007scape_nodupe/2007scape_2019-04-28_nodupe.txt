Thanks mate :)

Saving Slayer for last.... so 30 months I'll get there
---
Has anyone tried putting together a 2nd edition for OSRS?
---
Eh, if OP can't check to make sure they're using the right fuckin' WORDS, I can't blame someone for not doing the research.

Right at the start of the video. It takes him 20 seconds to run from BJS straight to the dock. This is an hour long video and this run is repeated so it seems consistently that length. 
---
 This isn't even including whatever method you are using to get to the fairy ring in the first place. Likely a house fairy ring will still add upwards of 10 seconds making it about a 30 second trip. Most people are 1/3 or more of the way through their kill at this point. 
---
 if you are getting only 2 kills in "above average gear", then you are doing something wrong. Period.
---
You can argue that there shouldn‚Äôt exist a 1m an hour melle xp training method without saying it‚Äôs bug abuse.
---
Also I‚Äôm probably not smarter than you.
---
ok but it all comes down to them being separate stats on the highscore page
---
Yeah hoping early Slayer goes by really quick..
---
F
---
Holy crap mind runes? Those things let you do actual magic. Like you can throw fireballs at people.
---
He definitely puts in the work :) 
---
Thanks mate, appreciate it
---
2nd last
---
Idk my company send to handle it just fine
---
Thanks bro!
---
i feel like it'd be hard to regulate only letting PKers vote in a poll, if its a KC threshold people would just boost

I got one from here while going for brim blue graceful

Idiocy is correlated to verbal diarrhea
---
Focus on buying bonds
---
yeah I'll chill at Tithe Farm for awhile! While trying to plant atleast 2 lots of trees every day and a few herb runs to make some money back
---
Yes. If there is a 10,000 buy limit every 4 hours, for example, and you buy 1 at 12 pm, you can buy 9,999 at 3:59 pm and 10,000 at 4 pm.
---
Konar is currently rather underwhelming. Clue scrolls are always in addition
---
991atatime rolls off the tongue easier. Also I think both those names are taken now.
---
For some reason the 2nd ones "Ill put down my weapon" reminds me of Tommy Wiseau.
---
Thank you
---
correct, 600k cannonballs
---
They are separate stats, but they dont change the combat system except for what you can use and your DPS output. Your choice of weapons and armour change the combat system more than stats do.
---
Your chair must smell awful

That'd lose the value of saying sit kid to your opponents.

Ahhh ok. Thanks

That‚Äôs a good point

Negative.

This nigga deleted his fucking post LMAO
---
git gud
---
do the real OGs too!
---
Turn on vpn. Make new account, transfer everything to it
---
The only thing more annoying than those bots are the multiple post like this who think there is some quick solution and the players who get a rare drop and say "there goes my rng".
---
Not true at all. Jagex has a link to remove it. I've done it after my iron was hacked. A simple google search would help
---
TBH someone probably has got a pull request for such a plug-in on github in a few days :D
---
YES YES YES
---
Dude, the fact that there is a non zero chance of it happening means that it is quite *literally* possible. Extremely rare, but *possible*.
---
Anyway, you seem to have glossed over most of my post because I‚Äôm not arguing that this tiny percent chance happened, I‚Äôm saying OP probably didn‚Äôt pick up every single mask because he was playing on mobile without item overlays so it‚Äôs possible he missed a lot. Especially if he was doing it at work or somewhere else with a lot of distractions.
---
The fact that the pic is of his *bank*, not the collection log, there is no guarantee that that‚Äôs the total amount of black masks he received anyway. Ergo, all of your calculations are moot because the dataset is potentially incomplete.
---
Didnt you get 2 str o before 99 range so isnt this tittle a flat out lie
---
Nothing to say he can‚Äôt do other things while things are growing. If he does farming after slayer, he could just slayer or other skills until 99 farming is done passively
---
Thanks mate!
---
Would have to be the worst one for sure...
---
slayer xD
---
Ah, the anti-vax scale.
---
Thanks!
---
cause im using prayer at the time
---
As good as raids are, i always enjoyed the fuck outta dung
---
what is hitpooints
---
Would you mind posting a pic of your collection log? Just to see the total number of black mask drops. I‚Äôm curious if the drop rate is wrong after all.
---
No but he'd love to call you a bitch
---
Obby Maul lol it was torture
---
slayer :)

---
A trick for instanced boss fights is to bring all untradable gear so if you die you will still have it instead of losing it. Just don't make the mistake did monkey madness 2. I brought all untradable except a whip, thinking since it's the only tradable item I brought, I would keep it on death. But I had at least 3 items worth more than it that were untradable. So I lost the whip lol
---
fuck you fe :)
---
Think you'll ever make pins of bosses?  I'd buy a Corp or olm pin
---
Makes me wonder how that 200m 1 at a time guy is doing.
---
It means that you gained construction xp if it tracks there. get some xp in other skills and you'll see.
---
I *could* make that argument but it's boring, because Jagex clearly never intended for this method to be used for training. I think it IS bug abuse and it shouldn't exist.
---
tight as fuck
---
Turbo support
---
One small favour p2
---
Yea, bonds are already a MTX and I can't see any others being offered. Untraceable weapons as a MTX would result in a riot from the community. MTX to buy stuff like xp lamps also would. The only MTX I can see players not revolting at is bonds.
---
Yes, I understand it is possible, but it is a waste of jagex's time. God forbid anyone has to suffer the consequences of the choice they willingly made.
---
To üëè The üëè Top
---
And the 99 farming in a year.
---
I dont have much free time so i did it inbetween my playing my maim also cannoned all my range.
---
But i agree it leveled slow lol, cheers was fun as to realise i can fight vs people 80range/94 mage massive confidence boost to try fight others.
---
Can confirm, some days it‚Äôs just writing a crystal report, do a bit of afking. Other days everything is down. IT generally also puts in a lot of offhours work, gotta make up for that EXP waste somehow.
---
ok? so?
---
use runelites stretched fixed mode if you want to keep the same ui. I like this ui, but with 1440p it's awful to look at. stretched fixed with gpu option on makes look good
---
Dont give any ideas

If his job is 100% results based (who's isn't? unless you're making a 100% science based dragon mmo...) then he must be in sales. 
---
If you're a salesman not attempting to make sales then of course you're just bad at your job.
---
Some jobs require full attention 100% of the time. Other jobs can go 0-100 real quick and vice versa when a project is done.
---
It's almost like different careers require different work ethic...
---
Get runelite and turn on "stretched mode" plugin.
---
It can't be pixelated if it doesn't exist
---
With that budget, you could go with:
---
* Neitiznot helm (fremennik isles)
---
* Proselyte top (Wanted)
---
* Proselyte bottom (Wanted)
---
* Dragon boots
---
* Dragon defender (Warriors guild)
---
* Warrior bracelet/barrows gloves (RFD)
---
* Dragon scimitar (Monkey Madness)
---
If you don't have those quests done, id highly recommend getting at least monkey madness and wanted done, they're pretty easy quests for some gear you'll be using til your 90's.
---
Im sure im in a couple videos, i dont really remember much but i was in uhh... Rsrclan, seperate forum, daily events with weekly recorded pk trips(just full rune with inv of lobstersss), one of the last events i remember doing was a fist of guthix mass followed by red portal soemthinggg
---
I don't have a business degree.

But I think you messed up
---
Depends on what we react better to i guess, audio ques are how i react in almost every game so its second nature to listen for them now.
---
I had my phone's ringtone changed to the ice barrage sound. No one ever calls me but I leave the ringer on so I can hear when I receive any notifications. One day my mom calls me while browsing reddit on my laptop and the ice barage sound comes on. I immediately look on my task bar searching for my Runelite window so I can react to being attacked. Only seconds later did I realize it was my phone ringing.
---
how did you make these? They look so well done!
---
Stated above that they work in IT &amp; have free time.

\#NotAllPKers
---
I'm not 94 mage, but yeah never knew what attack style the ling's use. I can definitely use that, know some of the phases I don't have to pray for. I have a few hundred kills, it's not like it's hard. I'd say just about every trip for me is 2kc though. 
---
Do you take brews and restores? I just shark karambwan and usually my limiting factor is I only bring 1 ppot I've finished my 2 kills with like 6 food left more than once. Think I'll work on extending it maybe to 3kc trips, could do it easy with like 3 brews 2 restores prolly and gonna try out vulnerability or whatever looks best so thanks again for some info
---
Many things in this game can cause this phenomena. The only prevention is "Physical Activity", so after you get done with your farm run, go tend your garden. After you get your woodcutting level, go cut up some firewood. Go plant some trees. After getting all those chin's, go hunt a deer. After 90 Herblore for raids and varrock elite's, make some herbal tea's with herbs from your garden. Take some mushies and go practice magic. Go take some archery courses. Practice cooking and get that fishing level up. Learn to smith  something. Go camping and build a fire. Probably don't steal, but practice lock picking. Get 90 agility for ardy elites and then go do ninja warrior.

OSRS does the best job at depicting the simple truth of games
---
PvE games have less toxicity because you aren't directly competing against other players, usually you're working with them or coexisting.
---
PvP games are infinitely more toxic because you're pitted against other players.
---
that's not at all true, many people including myself after update are waiting for runelite to update as well, if it's not updated yet I do my herb and birdhouse run then log off and wait

Questing too! If you haven't done all the quests that give you combat xp (that you have the reqs for) then what are you even doing? 
---
Jk, I just wish I had more time to quest...
---
It is but it's the most balanced form of it. It not only benefits the buyer with in-game currency and Jagex with their electricity bill but also players who don't have the financial means to pay for membership. It also adds another layer of goalpost for f2p.
---
In my case I buy a lot of bonds because I work long hours and wish to maximize my in game fun. Someone with time and patience can buy them up.

go pking?

Wow thanks asshole, you totally spoiled the movie I wouldn't care about if it wasn't for a fear of missing out.
---
I play on mobile :/
---
Not completely sure about sotd, the tridents are just used for general magic dps, especially for wildy because you don't have to risk runes. Swamp trident has one higher max hit and can venom, but costs about 50% more per cast.
---
For Barrows I like to use the normal trident because bringing a stack of fire runes means you can recharge it in the middle of a run
---
I was never bothered by skins or cosmetic transactions. The problem is the overrides.
---
It‚Äôs a game?....
---
I don't like it. Dont pay attention to ^this ^guy
---
Came from an Oak tree so the drop rate (I think) is 1 in 21558. Mad.

same, pking isnt impossible on mobile, just takes a bit more effort

Can you elaborate on NMZ with obsidian ?

Your mad at me when your blatantly lieing?

Yeah people were getting DDOSed for stuff

So I like doing barrows and do 6 bros + 2 skeles + 1 bloodworm for 86%. Was trying to work out how many runes I should have by 100 chests so I was reading reddit and see people mentioning 14kc runs and 11kc etc. I‚Äôm guessing 11 is 6 bros and 5 skeles for 100%, what‚Äôs 14kc? I‚Äôm guessing all skeletons no brothers for pure rune chests?
---
Black chins, very often.
---
Ofc if you wana get rich pking, fighting other pkers is the way to go ... deep wildly be spade n black chap territory
---
so why even have a pvp build?
---
I'm still ok with cosmetics. If it means OSRS keeps their lights on longer then it's fine. Something that breaks the integrity of the game, I'm not for.
---
Wait its unreasonable to want Jagex to actually start giving even half a shit about PvP and updating/fixing it instead of just continually paying lip service saying that they will give it attention and its something they actually care about?
---
Yes, youre indeed stupid if you think people being mad about wanting updates for an entire part of the game thats been completely neglected for so long whilst being promised things that ultimately never come. Somehow thats an "unreasonable" to be mad over.
---
The brainlets who are so crazy against PvP on this subreddit are just straight up delusional.

I‚Äôll show you how to do the math so you can do it in the future for other situations. 
---
8 fish exp per fish 
---
5 str exp per fish
---
5 agil exp per fish (i think, confirm)
---
(Experience needed for 70) - (current experience) = Œîexperience fishing 
---
Œîexperience fishing/8 exp per fish = fish needed to catch 
---
Fish needed to catch*5 agil exp per fish = agility exp awarded
---
(Exp needed for 45 agility) - (current agility experience) = Œîexperience agility 
---
If agility exp awarded &gt; Œîexperience agility you will get 45 agility
---
Okay, so does the loot appear for other people at the end of the hour then?
---
Nah, I think you mean ¬∞. W wouldn't fit cause there's no space.

How long did this take

Trident of swamp is good for zulrah

you're locking yourself out of higher level(and therefore more profitable) pvm by restricting your stats, if you cant even pk rn why not make your account into a regular account then when you get a PC make another for pvp
---
Bonds is the best balanced MTX I've seen. There are many players from foreign countries that can't afford 11 dollars a month to play the whole game. What bonds are is basically subsidies. If the demand for bonds isn't high the price goes down.

Isn't that already in runelite?
---
What PvP updates? Oh you mean the ones that Jagex have been talking about and feigning that they care about for years yet have produced absolutely nothing?
---
Yeah apparently youre a dumb fuck for wanting Jagex to stop completely neglecting an entire part of the game whilst lying about wanting to fix it for so long. The logic of the hive mind on this sub is fucking incredible.
---
And what stats? I think I read 70str 40atk 40def 70range. Is that right? And if so is that 1 mage 1 prayer?
---
Long long grind. Suppose its very afk

Ags has more instakill potential but claws are more consistent. For bh pking 60 attack builds are more powerful compared to 75 attack builds, but it doesn‚Äôt matter so much for nhing

If I tell you ‚Äúpls context jagex but I‚Äôm not telling u what I want LOL u fuckin moron why don‚Äôt you ever give us updates‚Äù
---
Do you understand now?
---
Ah yes, I too was hurt by the trek of temples. We are now blood brothers.
---
Want xp ? Use sotd and flames or best firespell. At low magic lvs plus without imbued heart this is better dps too.
---
Trident for bossing once your magic levels higher, since trident gets max hits as magic level increases
---
You‚Äôre doing it right with 2 skele and 1 worm. With more than that you‚Äôll get more bolt racks and less runes, meaning less profit
---
Maybe you'll take your first screenshot one day too

MTX destroyed RS3 so I doubt they would try it here. A ton of the 07 community is here because they hated Jagex pushing EOC on them and the rest (like me) came because RS3 became a non competitive p2w shit show. Jagex knows that 07 players would just quit again if they tried that shit. I mean most of us have already done it before...
---
Nope! Only shows up in PVP deaths
---
My setup was full obsidian armour, Obsidian cape, berserker ring, berserker necklace, toktz-xil-ak, toktz-ket-xil and dragon boots.

Use the minigame teleport to get there, or fairy ring code CLS or if you're lower just ring of dueling to castle wars and walk to Yanille. There, deposit money into the coffer, and talk to the guy to start a dream. Customize it however you like and start.

If I was a skilled programmer looking for refine my skill with a challenging job, do you think adding content to a 10 year old game is the way to go?

I know, I was standing at the ge and came here to comment when you were talking about it :)

This is amazing.   I had no idea they changed all that.   Such a game changer lol thanks!
---
T80 gear doesn't really matter, I wasn't playing at the time stuff like BP and TBow were added so I can't speak for the community back then, but JMods like adding T75 weapons because regardless of their actual powerlevel, people tend to not see powercreep if they read it as a T75 item. However, there's definitely been a shift with people wanting to change the reqs on items like Scythe, TBow, BP, Ghrazi, Sanguinesti, etc., to more accurately reflect how much stronger they are than other items of a similar tier.
---
For summoning it's just damage control, if everything is getting to be a bit too strong, you don't want to add more all at once to make the situation even worse.
---
I don‚Äôt think a bond is a good item to use in this instance considering you can just buy them with real money.
---
I was definitely just thinking King verac's flail, how's he gonna get smited for a vigorras unless he's skulled up being an idiot
---
Honestly 65 runecrafting on mobile is the most impressive to me.
---
I'd recommend elder chaos druids In lvl 13 wildly at the chaos temple while using a ring of wealth (I) for hard clues , as good a chance of clues from hell hounds (1/64 with row(i))with also the chance of some other drops can insta tp out if pkers and there's a alter to restore prayer right by there so you can keep prot mage on constantly
---
i see you drew my waifu

Cool vid. What do you do for the 2 weeks that bh isn't on your ping?
---
I was hopping worlds in the mining guild looking for the rocks closest to the bank. Find spot no one mining and some dude afk at the bank chest so I start mining. After about 5 inventories afk guy goes over to the rocks and tells me to "get the fuck off his world". So naturally I moved to the square 7 spaces away from the deposit box and made sure he only got one rock every respawn. All he had to do was be polite and I would have left. Dont be a cock nozzle and things will work out better for you in the long run.
---
Suppppport!
---
It depends on items, definitely not bonds. Things that are easily produceable like supplies can never be controlled by players, but there's certain rare drops/items that have certainly been hoarded to inflate their price like 3rd age items or Scythe of Vitur when it was new.
---
Also the alternatives to efficiency isn't fun so there is no point in some cases. 
---
Tick cooking isn't fun so if I wanted 99 cooking I would just spend 8m to make jugs of wine. That's the logic/mindset of it at least.
---
You won't get any loot if you don't kill any brothers
---
yikes
---
Ah the memories
---
Ok, I mean you're not gonna die 50 times, barrows makes some sense vork has way more effort involved requirement wise and way more profit also, just not that comperable. But yeah that's an option, go do that if you prefer? Why the hostility
---
Ancestral Khakis

Alright, thankyou! Just got to kill 30 more hellhounds for slayer task.
---
Ever since like 2008 people have been theorycrafting insane xp rates with d2h in the combat ring
---
You can still get these rates at a few places. Albeit with a lot more effort.
---
You could get 60 clan mates to run into mm2 tunnels and spec transfer you while you crystal hally/ d2h/ Scythe the monkeys there. You would get the same xp rates.
---
You could go into clan wars with ~22 alts and do the same thing as the PoH method with those aoe melle weapons.
---
The reason why this was doable was that the combat ring allowed this. Rejuvenation pool just made it more efficient for all the alts.
---
You can get 200m construction xp in a day from demonic thrones.
---
99 farming in a day from bagged plants in poh.
---
200k xp/ hour runecrafting at zmi with runners
---
1 mil range xp/hr with two alts dancing in mm2 caves
---
You can 1.5 tick teak trees on fossil island
---
You can two tick monkfish and lobsters in pvp worlds for the best chance of Heron Pet.
---
You can 3 tick chins for a 40% increase in hunter xp.
---
None of these are bugs (but resulting from an archaic engine) but are crazy better xp than pretty much anything.
---
You can still get 1mil melle xp an hour with crystal hally and d2h theoretically (mm2 tunnels and clan wars) but it just is so insane that people don‚Äôt do it.
---
For this guy that played 78 hours in one week with 22 accounts that he individually trained to to do this and spent months planning this. He got this insane method because he would have been putting in 1000000% more effort than pretty much any of us have ever put into this game. So it isn‚Äôt a bug but just an insane pushing this game to the absolute limit. We very very rarely see runescape pushed to this limit, and that‚Äôs what we saw with this record
---
Found watching guides just over complicated it, get the picture up with each rotation and learn it as you go it‚Äôs all about repetition, should be auto pilot by 50 kc
---
I tried with my iron man alt to get to 70str with 40attack. It was painful to say the least
---
Just make sure you have your BIS switches with a ring of suffering/recoils and pots. The longest part is learning the patterns. If you only learn one then you can tele out and back until you get lucky, but for multiple kills you will need to take the time for all four.
---
For the sake of my faith in humanity, I hope this is a shitpost
---
The only thing he said that's actually bad is when he called people virgins tbh
---
That too. Watching an overconfident streamer getting himself cleaned only adds to the enjoyment.
---
So afk
---
Thank god your opinion literally means nothing to most of us.
---
I agree with you there, I care about efficiency to a degree but not enough it 3tick or shit like that. Just prefer to do the best methods of training that aren‚Äôt awful to me personally.
---
Like alching while training agility is definitely more efficient but for me I just find makes training agility a lot more unbearable for me, so I just zone out listen to something and click a lot less doin normal laps as opposed to alching
---
I see this a lot but dont know where to start. Where's a good starting location to loot?

Okay so I believe farm alone is 130 odd days, slayer probably gonna be a further 250 hours depending on gear and salts and that rc maybe another 200 unless you're a G and run it through zmi then it's only 70-90 hours :) good to see progress from you bud.

I forgot about mobile for a second and thought you were in an accident or had a disability.

How long does it take to get the little fish that it uses as bait?

Once you max, doing all the achievement diaries in 1 hit will be really satisfying

One to show multi lines in wilderness and one that displays nonclan and nonfriend usernames above players head in the wildy only if they're within your combat bracket. Hope this makes sense and happy to clarify.

I'm looking to start doing barrows runs for GP.
---
These are my stats: https://i.imgur.com/Xn5OSb6.png
---
and these are my combat items: https://i.imgur.com/pUDWPsr.png
---
What kind of equipment should I be using? From what I understand, I need my RCB + broad bolts, staff of iban, my whip and defender, barrows gloves, glory amulet, and warrior ring. However I don't know what armor I should be using here. 
---
I only have about 1m liquid currently. Every guide I look up has super expensive stuff in it that I can't afford yet. Any suggestions in that price realm, even if I have to grind a bit more GP, would be much appreciated.

LMFAOLMFAO
---
Arguably Fury is better for solo Bandos for the tanks stats, but honestly cannot vouch for OP
---
Players who use the wild for non-PvM/PvE content aren't a monolith. And even though that's what you seem to have been going for, it's nice to not see it in the form of a tired spade post.

HERE WE GO AGAIN!

Immune to Endgame spoilers? Let‚Äôs test that theory.

Han Solo kills Jack Sparrow in endgame in Lumbridge
---
Oh shit I didn‚Äôt even notice it was b2b I read the one above 58 as 23k
---
They randomly show up trading each other
---
Risks 200 vs 100 or 500 vs 300
---
That's true. I think strength would still be done before attack though
---
This is probably your best bet, you can just go in with anything more than +0 mage bonus and be fine with a smoke battlestaff, chaos gauntlets, and rune.
---
Or just go to bed in some parts of the world. Me personally I always wait 8 hours now to avoid losing anything to rollbacks.
---
Atlanta's Classic Hits.
---
These images would be cool if they were actually made out of lego bricks but the fact that it's just a generic photoshop effect and it hits front page easily makes me believe people on the sub are amused by anything.
---
Same. To both of those. 900 KC but I‚Äôm not too bummed cause I‚Äôve made a crap ton of money and still waaay below drop rates.
---
No.
---
They don't?
---
It's updated just as often, with a solid focus on high level PvM these days. There's MTX out the ass sure, but there's no neglect at all.
---
I agree, direction, not a clue, wouldn't know what I was saying if I were saying anything, sounds good man!
---
You will get to lvl 46 agility.
---
They're adding what sounds like solo dungeoneering with the new quest expansion. It's called The Gauntlet or something.
---
I'd love to, however I am terrible so not really going to try and go out of my way lol.
---
spoiling my vorkath grind? aw hell no
---
Look; I'm an advocate for free speech, but in no way is it acceptable to shout racist slurs at somebody while your clan of 15+ people dog pile on a single person, thinking they're hot shit because they were able to knock you down in a single game tick.
---
Giving pkers easy kills by putting pvm content in the wildy is objectively bad pk content. Why would anyone that genuinely enjoys pvp want to waste time killing people that wont even fight back? It's lazy development and avoiding the real issues. Pkers deserve better.
---
Me too! Only 1 mining level to go lol.
---
Welcome to the low level tangleroot club!
---
You will be hated during your runs until about 60+ farming
---
I‚Äôve tried doing runecrafting in mobile and it‚Äôs just terrible to me. Don‚Äôt mind it on my pc. Did you do abyss or lava?
---
The grind is really annoying if you don't get fairly lucky, horrors drop way too much decent loot to have inventory space for hundreds of kills, accidentally going in range means getting that frustrating max hit yeet scream (unless you wear the amulet and have less dps), and the cave itself is far from any bank with the trip itself having annoying jungle fucks. I did my own grind when I could kill them (870 kc btw) but looking back It probably would've served to get better range lvl through moee slayer before doing it.
---
Or add a playlist option because even if there's a 1 in 700 chance of getting the hosidius banjo song, I'm not chancing it.

Yeah I can‚Äôt imagine how ugly it really is.

Hey mate I can help you out by donating 25m if you need it :)
---
As somebody who's very familiar with stagnating wages; Jagex is a stepping stone job to get into video game development.
---
Jagex like most software companies are reluctant to promote from within, because if you're good at your position; they don't want to move you onto another position, then have to hire somebody as good or better than you.
---
Hence why a lot of developers move diagonally rather than directly up, because you're more likely to get a pay raise by changing companies.
---
This happened to my friend. But I don‚Äôt believe he used a generic password. I gave him 100k which at the time was a 1/4 of my money. He didn‚Äôt use it and quit and said the game was too laggy for him. Well month later his account is hacked for major macro. And turns out he had no authentication. Either or it was crazy to see that happen to a fresh account. He couldn‚Äôt even see the evidence and I should of done this for him at the time to see what happened
---
Last time I checked the ratio was like 1:7 for osrs rs3
---
OSRS music is fucking lit, what are you on about?

Is trident better than Iban's blast right at lvl 75?
---
Is this a copy pasta

Completely devalues farming, unbelievably cheap training method that would astronomically decrease time required to get 99. 60 farming btw, all for this idea.

11k kc and no head :(

No just the truth. It really should be copied onto all these threads so maybe people start realizing it is a meme
---
Holy snap dude. 3 uniques what a clue
---
I just made a pure for fun and tried some free to play PKing. PKers are absurdly toxic. One guy (who was running around shouting Endgame spoilers) kept shit talking me and saying how bad my switches were and how bad I was because I ate more than once and it's absurd what these kids get so riled up about, especially considering that he teleported away while losing. This sort of thing happens a lot. I think it boils down to PKers being hypocrites who love killing defenseless players and noobs but hate it when people try to kill them and don't play by their "macho" PK "rules"
---
He was 84 hp at the moment he got hit a 92. Calculated risk on his part - the chance to actually die there was like 8% for him and for his opponent like 90% (sitting on 20hp while Oda had 2 gmaul specs and an ags coming up)
---
Your best bet is probably the [news archive](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=13/archive?oldschool=1&amp;year=2013&amp;month=2)
---
And boy, do I wish you good luck. It's a lot to go through. Maybe the wiki has a more condensed version?
---
Yeah! I'm pushing for rangers
---
Yeah but I think they‚Äôd investigate a site getting ddos‚Äôd to figure out a possible motive, and I‚Äôd assume their are some sort of laws in place that involve around maliciously deceiving people and attempting to steal info. And I believe technically accounts and items are jagex property? Not entirely sure on that but sort of remember hearing or reading that somewhere.
---
Ofcourse none of that gives you a free pass on DDOSing someone but just a theoretical would you get in trouble for it type question
---
I‚Äôm amazed out how well bonds fit into the game. It‚Äôs maybe the one time I‚Äôve seen MTX actually work without feeling intrusive. It‚Äôs literally just buying someone else a membership for ingame currency. Genius.

this but castle wars

Shamelessly? What is wrong with making my own memes/pictures and having people actually like them?

buy a bond with rs3 gold and use the membership to play on the osrs account

Ron Swanson got 99 runecrafting the long hard way... and loved every moment of it.

Is this supposed to be a grand achievement? You guys gilded this moron for doing nothing but cataloging his 99s. Yikes.
---
More confused on why he wasn't using elysian against a guy who was in dhoraks. If you're going to carry an elysian you may as well be using it, the strength bonus at that point is one point of damage, elysian's proc rate and damage mitigation is worth ten fold what the 1 damage would end up being.
---
Either way, was a good watch. Thanks for sharing.

Upvoted and agree fully with this addition to it.

I'm not saying you're wrong, but I really don't understand the Jagex model.

What
---
What a stupid fucking comment, it‚Äôs like you spew shit out of your ass without knowing anything. There‚Äôs been suggestions for years now, reworks, fixes, content, suggestions from Jagex, promises from Jagex on reworks, yet nothing has been done or listened to. The community has given a surplus of ideas at this point with no outcome out of it. Besides, it‚Äôs Jagex‚Äôs job to come up with ideas considering their the fucking developers of this game. It‚Äôs not uncommon for people to want new shit to pvp. Small stuff the community asks for is implemented by the devs, but no one specifically asked for Zeah, aerial fishing, Hydra boss, etc. 
---
All people asked for was a new slayer boss, the Jagex team came up with the rest. How fucking god damn dense can you be? Besides that, ideas have been pitched for years, promises have been made for years with no follow through whatsoever. God damn I swear to god you can really find amazing people in this community but on the flip you can find amongst the most idiotic and stupid people to exist. Reread your comment again and really think about what you said.

there is no way in hell you got 83 con on mobile. absolutely do not believe it.

Training Strength or Agility?
---
Because its the osrs subreddit friend. This is the only place those people can talk like that and get away with it without having a nervous breakdown in real life
---
Not the Zulrah Scales!
---
Can you show me proof of that ban? I have a hard time believing /politics is any worse than T\_D. Its the definition of an echo chamber period. You are free to express your political beliefs in politics but you are also free to get downvoted for them.
---
\&gt;  Because young people browse reddit, young people skew liberal because they have no life experience yet and think everything they want should be free and don't think of the consequences 
---
College students average to be about 2-1 (liberal to conservative) upon graduation  66%\~ vs 33%\~ this is a recent trend where it was more like 46% - 54% before 1994 so i'm not sure this holds up.
---
My other issue with this take is that you immediately dismiss a portion of the population because they are younger. The demographics of reddit are certainly skewed young liberal but from some Pew research papers (i'm sure you can find them) this liberalism is actually following them into adulthood.
---
\&gt;  I'm not saying I agree with it, but to toss shade at once sub because it's conservative echo chamber, and not the rest of reddit is a bit.... yeah 
---
Its not an echo chamber when you are allowed to express your opinion without getting censored by moderators. isn't it ironic that a subreddit for a party which favors deregulation and privatization is so heavily moderated and filled with enough vague rules that can allow anyone to be banned at any time for going against the "narrative" of the subreddit. There is enough censorship to make china jealous
---
I would say I'm a left-leaning centrist when it comes to certain ideas but I take a hard stance against T\_D moderators banning the way they do it does not create a healthy environment.

I won't lie this was my initial reaction too, but he's a really good dude with a big heart and totally grows on you. He is very well aware and familiar with the names that pop up in his chat regularly, subs or not, his reactions are pretty hilarious and he's extremely playful with his chat.

BA is one of the only good minigames

---
You could make the item itself tradable, but actually using it has requirements.
---
And that's a pretty old concept since the rune platebody, dragon SQ, D long/dagger/baxe/mace have all been locked behind quests since the early days of the game.
---
I think making the items both have a requirement and be rare could be cool. Like when you saw someone with a Dragon SQ back in 2004.

Does the defender have a higher alch value than the GE price if a bow?
---
Umm was he like 20b in debt? I don't think he's very good at it
---
I see you are nearly a quarter of the way to 99. Get to 50 wc and you'll be halfway there.
---
Okay but that‚Äôs clearly a slippery slope fallacy. So is saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs tried and failed content‚Äù because where does the content failure begin? Obviously not GWD, obviously not Corp. EoC plus P2W plus coinshare ALL made it fail. But individual pieces of the RS3 game would (and have already) made OSRS a better, more fleshed out game.

From memory it was the grind for 99 hit points - and he was using knives to train his HP and then ran out

As an OT student I agree, make the game as accessible as possible
---
Stop dick riding jagex facts are facts
---
if you are not cannoning/barraging in the only cannonable/barragable spot, then im sorry but you can move.
---
Barrage example: Dust devils in the Kourend Catacombs, there are so many open spots in the north room, if you are in the south room you better be barraging or im taking the spot.
---
Cannon example: Fire Giants in Gnome Stronghold, the middle and east spots are the only ones where you can multi combat cannon while you range from a safespot.
---
Cba yet still comments ü§îü§î

this stuff is awesome lol
---
With the immense quality of the new wiki over the obsolete fandom wikia, I personally would recommend just saving a bookmark to your home screen. All the information about the game is on the site
---
No one cares about the money risk. They are just talking about the chance of dying. Other people have pointed out the streamer has to risk bank otherwise no one fights him and his doing all this for views so add those to your calculations.
---
Funny how the rules change in the 100cb boats. Dont attack spinners, and leave gates open

---
Im not sure if this is the best, but I used to put the cannon in the middle room, and then range in the small narrow path between the middle and the east room.
---
Even better if nobody is in the east room(or just ask them to go south as that spot is melee only), because then you can range towards the east cave and let your cannon solo the middle ones doing a lot of double hits.
---
Do it please I'm interested

If you are a good healer all you ever really need is the first call and maybe another call if you go to restock on later waves so you know what food to destroy to free up inventory. Basically faster to guess the type of food it's gonna be, since it can't be the same 2x in a row and theres only 3 options, it's a 50/50 shot if you use one and its wrong then you know it's the other. Also you only lose something like 1/3rd of a point for using the wrong food so there is really no penalty for it. Collector can also guess at a 50/50 chance and it only subtracts 1 egg from your total eggs if you choose wrong one. Attacker and defender rely more on calls for sure, wrong attacks get costly fast and it's only a 33% chance to guess right, and defenders can end up with runners everywhere and just a general nuisance if you don't know what food to drop, unless you already got enough right food placed down because it stays right. Defender should be done within like 30-60 seconds anyway per wave if they are good
---
If we assume he is aiming to make money by risk fighting (which most people are), then this risk he took was not calculated.
---
The odds were in his favour this time, sure, but if he made the same risk enough times to make enough profit to cover his gear, he would probably lose his gear well before he made that. 
---
This was just one risk after many, and if he played like this every time, this death was bound to eventually happen. So yea, not really calculated.
---
I feel ya. Especially considering you're usually more than halfway through the waves by the time you realise
---
It's definitely a lot more
---
Do u know da wei?
---
What? The fact that you consider agility high intensity is laughable.
---
Grats!

__I know I‚Äôm gonna get downvoted because not what but wtf does the lever do? I‚Äôm super confused__

I like agility. Got 73 today and did Fremmy diary for the shortcut to the troll stronghold herb patch. Am very happy with myself for doing it. Going for a level a day till 80 for the Taverley shortcut.

Take it as a learning experience man. Everyone's been scammed at some point when they were new to the game. Learn from it and move on. Don't take money super serious in this game either. As you play more you will find methods of making more and more money per hour, as well as sometimes just getting lucky and getting a really expensive item drop. It sucks but trust me, you will make that back faster the second time and it only gets faster as you play more. 
---
As a general rule, if something sounds too good to be true, it's a scam.
---
Is there a really good lore documentary I can watch on youtube?
---
That's not right, right? I thought it was a rolling limit (buy 10 at 17:00, buy 9990 at 20:59, you'll buy 10 at 21:00 and 9990 at 0:59)
---
I usually press ESC but might use this when im holding my dick with my left hand

Read the limm

Perhaps this should be a wake up call.
---
1. Pay attention.
---
2. Sacrificing ‚ÄúALL your sleep‚Äù for pixels is a waste of so many things on so many levels. If you‚Äôre that depressed try getting into a hobby that will actually help you.

Twisted bow, made of ham.
---
Yeah even with like 1/3rd of the playerbase rs3 makes 60% more profit than osrs.
---
&gt;Each account should only be used by one person. Never share your account with anyone else, doing so will likely get the account banned. Players may not sell, share, transfer or lend their account to anyone else. Players should not accept an account that anybody else offers, as they may be stolen, and this could lead to your own account being disabled!

Jagex can't promise that MTX will never be in OSRS because it's not Jagex's decision. Yeah, what a great smackdown. All Jagex can do to keep MTX out of OSRS is to throw statistics at our Chinese overlords and hope they don't compare some Asian-market demographic to us and fill the game with thinly-veiled MTX garbage.

That is exactly my point, and that is why protocols as dmarc comes in. If people know it's a problem why do they not adopt the necessary protocols to fix it. So I agrre the email standard as is doesn't look for verification. However if dmarc exist why doesn't all large providers use it. Just like we converted to https. Saying that this problem exist because the standard is outdated means the same to me as saying people are stupid for not using the new "fixed" ones
---
Most gamers had been scammed at one point or another
---
Also 
---
&gt; I've sacrificed ALL of my sleep

&gt; ... more depressed than I was ...

maybe try sleeping healthy amount of time? lol

It‚Äôs like real life... people and cunts... why would osrs be any different?

Anyone that could tell me optimal gear? Looking at old guides from 2010 but there has to be new items since then.

Yes I know, seeing as it was mentioned earlier in this exact comment thread.

3k tokens and I'm on iron ugh

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yes. The quaint 2007 era where things like economies and even electricity were not yet a concept. We lived in small 10 man tribes with our families and ate dirt pies.
---
It‚Äôs only 240 more xp per trip over magic birdhouses, but redwood birdhouses are cheaper than magic logs on the ge. As long as you can get them it seems like it would be worth it.
---
I played mid for full void so 850 points and he died countless times. Mid was horrible for me but luckily I was 90cb so when I went to get elite I was on vet which is amazing
---
You can't fool me, that's Murdock.
---
O really... cool. I thought it was from rs! But it‚Äôs the client.
---
To the people saying a lot of them are bots, there‚Äôs definitely way less bots now than there were in 2004-2007 when we used to hit 200k. Old school RuneScape is doing extremely well.
---
You must still be in college
---
Tbh that will probably be osrs in the far future too. There comes a point where people will get bored of a game even if there is new content added every month.
---
But let's just hope osrs will continue to grow for at least half a decade more
---
Trying to explain EV to Runescape players is a fucking nightmare
---
Never seen someone try so hard to be funny while failing this massively.
---
RECTANGLES!
---
Runescape and OSRS are two different games. JMods already said they wouldn't ban for account sharing and that the only thing they'd look into if it was services done.
---
They are making us do all the work then sell the gold off themselves! Holy fuh
---
Mods have said before that you will not get banned for account sharing with some exceptions. Those being rigging mini games, gaining an advantage on high scores or competitions, or completing inferno
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the same as I brought as an emergency because they still heal pretty high. Can not wait to have enough for a dhcb and give that a try
---
Pay 50 gp to open the door

You hate people who wanna get the most out of their game time? You have an issue, dude.

It's 0.057 out of 1.

The guy had the right premise, but he added the percentage sign. Simple mistake
---
It kills HCIM and gets you a flashy cape, whats not to like?

Would you have to telegrab every (unlikely) time you drop the cape?

Congratz, but what's the super combat pot doing in your inv?

The worst one being Desert elite for the KQ shortcut.

You really have to emphasize on the 'sometimes' part.

Not if you chin

Nah I was just bored, since I graduated high school I haven‚Äôt been able to creatively write in awhile lol
---
Never had any issues in explaining RS lore or gameplay to anyone. They understand it perfectly.
---
IMO I reckon jagex would rather remove it than promote it.. just sounds like something jagex would do if there was ever going to be a change in the duel arena. 
---
Only benefit for them is coin sink 
---
If they changed to your way 1,000‚Äôs of new players who didn‚Äôt grind the stats will be losing their banks and rage quitting.
---
It's not that people choose to do this, it's anger / mental health problems, surely?
---
I got fighter torso in like 2 hours and literally only had 5 minutes of reading a guide of prior experience. BA is dummy ez
---
BA is a cool minigame in itself, it's just that the process of building (and worse, maintaining) a team in the BA lobby is absolutely horrendous
---
For sure. I just dont want to spend 10 hours getting sara brews when i could just spend 1 hour getting 3m and get 1000 of them. I just cant dump the time into the game
---
Ye I can see that
---
Holy fucking shit I love this

Did you happen to kill the hellhound in gwd? I did this the other day and it didn't seem to count so I had to go kill one somewhere else. But I didn't lose my clue either though.

Imagine how bad this person must feel inside for him to need to say such things

If you hit an npc with ice barrage and the aoe hits a player, do you skull? If not, do they auto retaliate to it? And would they be skulled if they did?
---
Good point, agreed
---
2000 dollar gaming mouse btw, his keyboard looks cheap and I highly doubt it even broke.

Sometimes when I pk someone who's flaming me, I specifically turn my private on to see if they'll flame me in the pms after they spawn in lumbridge

I'm not autistic and I like tick manipulation. It's relaxing and very easy to get into. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean people who enjoy that are "autists," besides if tick manipulating is "autistic" to you then why even play rs. Entire game is a grind and super repetitive l000l
---
Oof... now we're talking.

I do like Hunter and Construction (both 2006) though

They literally can. If you were intelligent enough, you would have pointed out that salaries aren't adjusted for cost of living, rather than FX rates, therefore they aren't as comparable. At that point, I would have pointed out that the cost of living in Cambridge is much higher than most places in the US.

I found out about it a few months ago and it made her runs so much quicker.

Dunno how it's coming along though

Some people find playing more efficiently more fun. It's just a game mate, people enjoy different things than you do, and that's ok. Also the guy harrassed no one. He literally just said ''lore is xp waste'', was probably memeing, there was not once ounce of harrasment or agressiveness in his comment. Why am I so aggressive about it? People who lack the common sense a 5 year old kid would have are annoying as shit. Sorry.

What happens when he goes to the bank for 26 planks but you still have 2 in your inventory. He will be holding two you so you must talk to him to get the 2 planks from him before he goes to the bank for 26 more
---
A lunar spell for a temporary anvil would be super niche but kinda cool for metal drags
---
Balance is an equal amount? So if one gets too powerful ofcourse he‚Äôd cut them down to restore balance. Sure by aiding one side he‚Äôs tipping balance but he‚Äôs only doing it to restore the balance which has already been lost due to one becoming more powerful?
---
Nice addition of the ü¶Ä nebula

No bro wtf you need armadyl and be on task with slayer helm to have any chance
---
Podcasts/ listen streams in werewolf, but on rooftops you can read anime subtitles while training 2 other accounts it's so damn easy. Especially the later ones like Relleka or Ardy, where you click on a house-sized hitbox for a 4-5 second animation on a like 7 step course
---
If runescape was real how big would runes be?
---
I mean if you're playing runescape, 2nd monitor is kind of a given. Like maybe you could do some window squeezing on a big 4k monitor, but runescape just seems like one of those games that are 5000% lamer when it's the focal point of your screen. I always thought of it as a second monitor game.
---
I made 60m from 89-99 agility which was pretty chill. It's also very useful for things like herbiboar which i did till 80-99 hunter straight after i got 99 agility and i notice a significant difference in how long my stamina lasted and how quick it regened.
---
thanks, honestly no idea, because I had to buy upgrades as I went, I got 2 Skeletal Visages in the process though, so was really good money. Think it had to be around 500 mil
---
Easily

Wish they didnt make so much of the lore about the 3 gods.

People will just throw money at him again, no real risk

Mate if you photoshopped it you can just say so. The skill in the skill tab should say 93/99 and there's some misaligned pixels. No one will doubt your achievement since it's easy to forget to have the right tab open

That‚Äôs stupid. Was it always like that pre07?

lmaoooo

Dragon slayer 1 gets the champions guild... Want to change DS1 to Champions quest too?
---
You make alot of gp per hour so maybe thats encouraging
---
Don't feel bad, those gains aren't too bad for your first month. :)
---
Hey man can i have another clue?
---
Like maybe your email and password pls wont hack just wana try it ykno
---
Perhaps I should have said "changing exchange rates". The weak pound has weakened but that hasn't really affected the actual cost of living much which causes a big disconnect when purely using exchange rate to convert the currencies.
---
Getting a ZGS for the spec damage is just for fun. Which is a perfectly fine reason to buy an item of course, but for efficiency you're infinitely better off investing that money in a Fury or something.
---
They are not hosting at the moment because personal problems
---
Thats what i just said. Specific megarare being 200x16 (rough numbers dont know them exactly) even if your edited comment you are still wrong.
---
Mega rare is 1/3510, no its not. Thats the chance of hitting 3rd age.
---
I don't care at all mate, just making the point I don't think acting like that is a conscious choice.
---
It makes sense but I still would prefer a more unique name such as "Wrath of the Dragonkin".
---
Why is the cape of skulls worth so much?
---
Apparently they do
---
Got enough trees and other farm methods already. The guild made farmer even easier also. Nothanks
---
Maybe but there‚Äôs something pretty hype about doing ‚Äòdragon slayer 2‚Äô
---
It's just the slow grind. Getting from 44 to 59 is going to take me probably forever, and it's put me off playing. I do like 10 minutes of training then I log back off because it's simply RC.
---
Every game except runeversi (reversi) has been solved mathematically, programming perfect playing bots would be too easy.
---
Bossing gives more of an item per hour than skilling such as manta rays and zulrah
---
Uhhhh, it types in 580m but the M didn‚Äôt register. Your are a dense one arent you.
---
That man way assdt mee
---
I am 44 RC too and I would definitely drop that clue. Runecrafting, regardless of method, takes a lot of attention and is super grindy.
---
The tribal leader and his tribal warrior have just arrived at the famous GE from a long trip from Karamja.
---
I do rc slowly like a couple clicks every few seconds not full attention and also rc is my lowest skill and most of my levels come from diary lamps they are huge for me

Almost did.

You tried to trick people, but you forgot your IQ seems to be lower than anyone else

tears of guthix
---
Do you have Astrals unlocked?  They're good at lower levels imo since it makes decent money and doesn't involve the abyss.  Stamina potions barely cut into your profit, too.
---
Guthix, duh.
---
For real though, thieving HAM members for easy clues is good money.
---
BH revamp is pointless  osrs and Rs3 have tried it multiple times and it never works. Players just don't give a shit about it.
---
Watch tedious on YouTube I thibk he's done this boss
---
At 70 and I've gotten hammers. Once.
---
3 reasons why this most likely won‚Äôt happen on the scale you might think
---
1 - hoarding items in merch clans is a bannable offence on osrs
---
2 - there‚Äôs new versions of every item coming into the game all the time, nearly 100k are online at a given time, unless the item is extremely rare being able to control supply completely is virtually impossible 
---
3 - there are trade limits for most hoardable items which prevents buying out unless you have a very large number of accounts, all of which will require bonds if the item is a members item
---
The people who reply to the "I have no friends, family, dog but I got 75 woodcutting after 12 years" reddit posts.

Cant waste that xp

this community is wild it would rather do every skill as slow as possible and complain about how long the game takes. 
---
you got me dude if you hate the game and you just afk everything there are other skills that are more afk than agility.
---
Ironmen have separate stocks for chatters iirc
---
If you have big balls and big skills lavas are 95k xp/hr.
---
I‚Äôm a billionaire because of staking tho...
---
Astrals require lunar diplomacy, which is a quest you really want to polish off asap anyway because lunar spells are super useful.
---
Imagine thinking rev caves is a PVP update. It‚Äôs just a bunch of clans in rag gear clearing worlds of low risk PvMers lol. Thanks for calling these updates as they are.
---
Then why are players complaining that it hasn‚Äôt been worked on?
---
It‚Äôs literally in the clip, why not watch that
---
@me
---
Till i try sand casino or pking and lose bank
---
I would have yoinked that shit so quickly.
---
Some kind of tick metronome. It would help with efficient skilling
---
Ironmen do have separate stocks lol..
---
You're a stronger man than I am
---
So without the ring of the gods drop, 4m in 20 hours?
---
1999 actually
---
Boss attacks someone else, ironmen won't get loot
---
125. Was explaining the drop rate to my friend who just started playing and got it that very moment.
---
That honestly sounds a bit over exaggerated.
---
I've never even heard of this dude until now and he's definitely not super well known based on his Twitch numbers. Plus, he could just play on a different account or change his name if he actually is known to be so good, to the point which no one will fight him in 1:1 risk. Are you saying that most of the people who risk fight in his combat bracket are constantly checking his Twitch to make sure they're not possibly fighting him?
---
*cries in c engineer*
---
Holy FRICK
---
You probably shouldn‚Äôt take more than 8 brews. With only 43 pray it‚Äôs going to take a lot of prayer restoration.
---
I mean how the fuck is Jagex gonna track if you got anything for giving a Tbow to someone 'for free'.
---
Like 13 lol. Leveling prayer drags because I don‚Äôt like burying bones.
---

---
Think they are rs3 gold rates lol
---
Thanks
---
Take this down bro, just playing how I want to
---
Exactly
---
Ah okay. I‚Äôm going to have to watch some tutorials on that cause My main goal is completing all the quests and bosses
---
I'm around the same with only an Ahrim's staff. I hate my RNG sometimes
---
He didn't sell anything?
---
its also an extra 100m for like 20 hours saved if that.
---
Just got the suit from there for diary and I support this 100%. So many miss clicks
---
dude if that is ur prob ur playing the wrong game.
---
It's not uncommon at all to go 30-40x  dry over the drop rate. You could very well be looking at 1000 kills dry friend!
---
Ouch
---
Nah, git gud scrub.
---
my mistake.
---
What‚Äôs the significance of crabs
---
I was more referring to the beginning of the game, where yourself and some noob are the only ones at the portal and he's attacking the portal with his granite maul as a main hand and getting nowhere, while you kill the spinners yourself. There's definitely no need to kill the spinners if there's 4+ people on it, but sometimes you get stuck in a situation like this where killing the spinners are necessary until backup arrives.
---
Hacker coincidentally hacks him while he had 3 tbows in his inventory while leaving his hcim status. Thus leaving him with rebuild content for stream. Totally not a staged hack/rwt to promote his twitch channel btw.
---
im well over 40 the drop rate. 5/128 is 1/25
---
Addressing the real problems here.

Why do you venerate twice? Is there algilty recommendations?
---
Competition for resources is a crucial part of any MMORPG. Go play single player games if you don't like that.

I got a mute in 2006 for advertising a pest control IRC channel. Everyone used Swiftswitch then which defaulted to a specific IRC server so I hadn't even mentioned the server name in my message.

Gross. Then don't wear meta gear
---
Essentially str &gt;&gt; void melee. Range &gt; melee against ahrim, the accuracy against him is complete shit with melee. I'm pretty sure void ranged is bis against ahrim using rcb or bp, but void for mage isn't better than tormented bracelet. Elite void is pretty similar to dps though, as far as I know. Running void mage/range with melee str is how I did barrows, quite unsure what setup I would use if I return. Probably mage/range only using bp for kc in tunnels.

why would the king fund such a useless bridge? no one cares about the sky in Gielnor and there is nothing but pitch black up there anyways.

---
It's not because I had never heard of him that it sounds exaggerated, it's the fact that in over a decade of playing this game, never once have I heard someone claim that every PKer is afraid of one guy... Seemingly so afraid to the point that they're constantly checking his Twitch to see if he's smurfing them or not.
---
You must see how that can sound ridiculous when taken at face value, regardless of how well known he is.
---
But it's been clarified with me that risk fighters in particular are the ones who will go to these extremes to avoid fighting him in 1:1 risk, which makes sense. Hopefully you can understand where my skepticism was coming from.
---
Pretty sure its chymistry or something not sure if he still does it though
---
Significantly more. But that's partially because skilling items are so low in value now. I know they'd never compare, and will never be allowed to compare, especially because it would be too easy for bots to make ludicrous amounts of gp.
---
I'm currently on a 4 month binge and have gotten pretty far in the game. I love it, but I probably play more than I should right now.
---
Just finished RFD and some other great stats, will probably play less for a little while and focus on my business.
---
200 Qp but doesn‚Äôt know what an instance boss fight it. Bro stop lying how much was your account.
---
I'll help: wear black dhide and an msb and bring more than 0 brews lol
---
That comment is essentially my entire philosophy about this game so I‚Äôm surprised you would say you don‚Äôt normally agree with me
---
jagex devs catering to shitter normies, didnt even have the balls to add 90 rc req on kourend elite diary.
---
Yes.
---
And you literally asked how you were to know..
---
How long ago did this happen?
---
Both wiki and slayermusiq says you have to protect from range for the quest guide, the wiki also states Giant Roc's attack styles are melee and ranged. Nowhere it says the boss attacks with mage or you have to protect from magic.
---
Are coming down the stairs
---
I've grabbed less from people not paying attention. Floor loot is everyone's loot.
---
Well shit I guess I‚Äôm lucky.  I was getting peeved at the 4 minute games

I mean they really are powerless in this case
---
Technically, that would be Zanaris.  Iirc, it is located on Gielenor's equivalent of the moon.
---
I really don't know why I didn't like eoc, because I've played a bunch of other MMOs with hotbar combat and enjoyed it. I'm curious how many people quit because of that, vs how many quit because of mtx and the rest of the bullshit.

Might mean you don‚Äôt have a GPU.

Why the fuck are you risking 2b if you're going to be that mad about it.
---
Or that was just someone who tried scamming people trading gambling bots by standing underneath them with a similar name but then got phished.

If it's any consolation it's about a 99.7% chance you should have it by now

Hell, so many skilling guides discuss on how to mitigate risk from PKers in the wilderness. They make no mention of what to do about other skillers or PvMers.
---
Becayse is a very satisfying word to say.

I think it was like 20-25/hr not paying much attention, when I did a similar grind. Other option would be to do scullicepts on fossil island or afk the crabs for fossils then use the lamps on rc

---
Bad that they made a reasonably difficult skill extremely piss easy? Yes, I dont think bad is a sufficient word to do this justice, perhaps "absolutely garbage" will do.
---
You basically have it. Down the road you can get armadyl, but most people primarily use dhide for the prayer and that it‚Äôs not much worse than arma.

932 I think

Yeah but it isn't visible to other players for an hour, this change would massively affect them lol.

Yeah, except this guy can‚Äôt do it. So he‚Äôs paying a premium for the skill.
---
I mean it's probably hard, younger kids aren't down for the grind like they used to be, just look at what happened to WoW, they had to add selfie sticks and flying mounts that are faster then their quick travel to appeal to an instant gratification generation. Without the nostalgia it's probably gunna be hard to get him to want to grind. I would have him do some high level stuff on your account like bossing so he can see the reward and that might draw him in.
---
Somewhere up in the next demension, the ancient Egyptian god of sex is giving you a thumbs up.
---
Because the hard part is grinding. A lot can do a very difficult method for 2 minutes. Very very few can do it for 6 hours. Thats the whole point of Runescape.
---
What's this post on about? Didn't see an increase for Google Play subscription and still get ad free youtube.
---
Tell me about it. Most of my childhood was spent fantasizing about what I would do on runescape after I got done with whatever bullshit I was caught up in. 
---
The itch is real.
---
I love clint.
---
3 fire runes and a nat.
---
Or I could spend 5 minutes teleporting to the places I can get them for free.
---
Axes were renamed to hatchets back in 2009 though.
---
What do you mean by "superfaked" though?
---
Or he's killed a lot of snakes
---
Thanks bro, you too.
---
can you just not
---
I assumed the 1 hour death mechanics would stay the same, just only pertain to UIM. OP doesn't say anywhere that items should appear for other players or despawn before 1 hour.
---
Shit, that's his girl now. He's got fighting boots instead of the colorful ones, he isn't playing around.
---
Four fangs and a serp by 190 kc... That's fucking insane
---
More faked then regular wrestling
---
I know it‚Äôs around and I followed it for a bit but there‚Äôs nothing really interesting about Runescape‚Äôs lore imo. I read up on WoW lore because of how deep and interconnected the stories are weaved. 
---
But ya could still quiz me and I‚Äôd know it
---
It may look like plenty but I've used up my 200k scales and it feels like they went away too fast :(
---
But runecrafting isn't very difficult, it's literally just slow and repetitive.
---
I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd kick his ass with her superior fancy boots
---
Gz
---
Whoa that's bigger than a Lil Mac ban
---
Bryophyta would also mean he has to grind out mossy keys which I'm sure he wouldn't wanna do. Not very good GP/hr at all.
---
Very few greater pleasures in life than grinding out some osrs baked af.
---
Sounds optimistic, hoping this is a similar case
---
p2p is much more enjoyable than f2p. If he doesn't like it he doesn't like it though. Can't force him to enjoy it.
---
mine is so far innie that its a reverse outie
---
Wouldn't you be upset if you pk'd someone for a spade and instead got a glory?
---
Wtf when I first saw " I Ching" I thought it must be typo. You should probably try to come up with a way to explain this using English.
---
I've been in shitty high level boats where spinners overrun the damn portal and we cant out damage it lol. Problem was that the nova were blocking the spinners and we couldn't kill them lol
---
But what youre saying is also completely wrong. The skill gap to something like lavas is insane. Like you would have someone like Autumn Elegy who is better than 99.99% of players at lavas and then you have people that are way better than Elegy at the method. So yeah, its just outright wrong.
---
I‚Äôm thinking p2p will be good. Give him a long 14day adventure ü§®
---
I have not once had a pleasant experience in the wild. Its not real pvp, its predator vs prey. Its pvp vs pve there. That's why I'll vote no to every pvp update. Every pvp update is "look, we will bring more pve stuff here for you to prey on," instead of "here, have fun fighting people that want to fight or learn how to." Theres to big of a risk to go learn properly and the community isn't inclusive to new pvpers. With all of that in mind, each encounter pushes me toward voting no to pvp updates even if they're good for pvers

Imagine not using YouTube Vanced, and actually paying for ad free YouTube lmfao

I just did this quest on my maxed main bc I hate quests and put it off, I used the same guide and he constantly said to bring food and made it clear you would be fighting a boss. If your trolling your shit at it.. if your being serious you need to just grab your sack and go make that money again bc that was user error my dude we have all been there. But it‚Äôs a solid question.. who the fuck brings 215m cash on a quest? üòÇüò≠

Med helm I can deal with. Fighting boots? Aight its preference. Vambs? Alright whatever. Chain body though? Come on guy fuck outta here
---
Tormented heart?

That sounds very old school.
---
Is that available to iPhone users?
---
Hey, you got some! Congrats!
---
WOW HAHA YOURE HILARIOUS
---
That guy has never done any PVM. Also, id rather get super-fast slayer xp and just afk melees if need be.
---
He's not talking about an old version of RS. Java was disabled by all the major browsers because it's a huge security risk and a constant source of severe vulnerabilities. Jagex decided to migrate everyone to a stand alone client in response. Otherwise, theres no real reason why RuneScape isn't played in a browser today.
---
that crab looks like when tony stark and black widow dies.
---
I got the head only 10 kills later bro!
---
can I have a space skybox on runelite? I'm still using the default client but I'll def switch over to RL if I can have that
---
Dumb cunt

Thanks man will do.

Look at this fucking idiot posting comments on reddit. Don't you know excessive computer time, especially typing, can lead to carpal tunnel?! have fun not being able to use your hands. Ughh so irresponsible.

Hulk dabs
---
You are expecting the game to adapt to you instead of the other way around and think you're gonna get supportive comments? Wtf dude.
---
People with more than 128 MB of RAM
---
Considering how easy Galvek was, Id be okay with that.
---
Grats. Also good call in hiding the wiki button. Can never be too careful.
---
Just remove specs from certain portions of the wildy? How hard is that?
---
I'm really happy that you included the gloves and boots since they are BiS f2p melee gear lol
---
He kept adding me and then disappearing so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to reply.

Also, there is gear that can raise your prayer bonus to make your prayer points drain slower. You can check your prayer bonus in the equipment tab when looking at your worn gear.

That's just normal.

Eww osbuddy
---
I was in the same boat as you about about 6 months ago. My advice would be to not sweat it for now, just play the game as you used to and you‚Äôll start to pick up on new stuff as you progress. If you actually try to catch yourself up on everything you‚Äôll get really overwhelmed.
---
That being said, when you‚Äôre looking to train certain skills or find the best strategies to kill monsters, look it up on youtube. The methods you remember are probably obsolete and there are a million guides out there for everything now. In some cases, it‚Äôs not even a matter of new content but people have just found super efficient ways to do things after playing the game for so long (also, not being 10 years old helps).
---
I melee when I want to afk otherwise I‚Äôll never stop using the bp, it‚Äôs hard cause I‚Äôm almost max range and 80‚Äôs in my combat + 90str, it‚Äôs just way to good.
---
Sounds like a publicity sham. Maybe he drop traded the items and sold them for GP, and just lied to everyone, which isn't against Jagex rules, unless it's actually RWT.
---
Why do I keep opening reddit lol
---
He'd probably ask for 5m trust trade for a "good reward"
---
If he was hacked they would‚Äôve taken his status too. Obv rwt.
---
I usually vote yes to PvP content in the polls even though I don't PvP.
---
One of the reasons I think a lot of PvMers vote no is because of the toxicity from the PvPers. 
---
Sure, I get that it can be absolutely hilarious for PKers to say "Sit &lt;racial slur/offensive name&gt;" but most of the time what you accomplish is an annoyed player who will vote no to PvP content whenever they can because they now hate PKers.
---
Takes 15 seconds tops to hop...
---
I will. Going for it again today when I get home from work! I don‚Äôt care if it takes me 100 attempts.
---
Bring an explorer ring. It's +1 prayer from any tier of lumby diary
---
yeah, he'll say this after My Arm's Big Adventure if you talk to him after the quest
---
291 scales!? Nice!!
---
PSA: people like op are allowed to vote in polls
---
No full helm, no shield, and no plate body, easy match.
---
It's because combat is so much more reliably lucrative. No point in fishing monkfish/sharks for 350 hours when I can just do barb fishing in much less time and do combat with the remaining time and make more money.
---
The alternative i.e. fishing monkfish/shark isn't fun so there is no point in doing the non efficient method.

No video has ever made me so anxious in anticipation of dancing crabs. I feel blue balled here.

Only 2% of RuneScape's players is under the age of 18, and the average account age is 8 years old (based on statistical data, not player given birthdays). This is probably an 18-24 year old dude.

It‚Äôs pretty clear that you‚Äôre a pathetic manchild

Opening a casket is a single action, not a combined chance experiment. Which means that hitting a certain drop table doesn't mean you got any closer to any of the items on that table.
---
You got a 280k hard clue. Be content.
---
Yeah, us osrs players have some etiquette. Mobile migrants are a bunch of degens. If somebody is camping something and they were there first, take 15 seconds tops and hipity hop your fuckin' moron.
---
Yes I get that I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt think anyone is using an older version of a browser like that
---
Wholesome, even though you can't realistically be blamed for keeping a drop that has been on the ground long enough for you to see it but that's still kind.
---
Probably playing without Ground Items. It's not an actual RuneScape feature after all.

It's a response, it's not valid because it has nothing to do with the subject matter and offers nothing to either support or dispute it.

It amounts to deflecting from the topic at hand and derailing the thread.
---
Also try high risk and 1750 worlds. Obviously you‚Äôll still get pk‚Äôed but when I was on the Vetion grind I would sometimes go 100 kills without being killed but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs more dangerous now with the mace update.

33 total attempts, not sure how long I spent but it wasn't toobad

Doesn't matter what your HP is, cutting the kindling at the beginning is full afk, and after that you pay minimal attention.

I didn't get to 86 yet but I was fairly similar. Took me ages to get to 77 and then it was a few days and I was already at 82.

Hello. Unfortunate that you lost all your stuff. I remember clearly that I was warned of an instanced fight where you loose all your shit. Either slayermisiq says it or the quest has a warning. If you missed the warning then that sucks. Pretty much any boss fight where you're in an instance you'll loose your shit if you die. Many boss fights have this. I guess you'll just have to mark this down as a learning experience. 
---
I wouldn't say there's so many "grey areas" and I think it's an exaggeration on your part because you're pissed off. I get it, but there are clear warnings within the quest that state you'll loose your shit.
---
EXACTLY. And exchange rates are very poor indicators of that. Hence comparing a USD salary to a GBP salary purely using exchange rate is downright shit.
---
glory / warrior ring is fine. What's your def level? Generally people wear either barrows top/bottom for defense, or proselyte for prayer bonus if using protection prayer
---
jagex didn't even bother making a 99 battery cape #winter2017
---
Use what you like, it‚Äôs a game.

Sure, I personally dislike construction even though I enjoy 3t skilling etc so anything that gets it done faster.

The new Mahogany benches are around 1.1m xp/hr too so that would have been nice if I didnt have 99 already, will be nice once I go for 20m base.

You must of had boring friends sorry but to most people being locked in a room and forced online isn't as fun as being next to your friends laughing, shooting the shit, drinking brews, and just having a good time. Yes online is fun but virtual socialization can't compete with actual socialization. Also I didn't state my post as fact this is Reddit 99.9% of the posts here are opinion.
---
I‚Äôm nearly the same kc but haven‚Äôt gotten a single drop in my name. Me and my buddy duo and he gets chainskirt on 1kc...
---
oh so ur saying slippery slope i get it
---
We absolutely are forced in it we want to do specific content.  PvM content.  Certain bosses only point towards the wilderness.  Certain clue scrolls point only into the wilderness.  If we want to participate in that content, we are literally forced into the wilderness. If we wish to complete our collection logs, which is a major point of any game with an extensive loot system, we are literally *forced* into the wilderness.

Same but you got to be careful, you don't want to overcharge your battery so a maximum of 5-10 seconds at 700-800W for me.

I'm confident those wizards have the highest kill count of any RS monster.
---
That's exactly his point
---
The only bots left are the suicide bot farms or self written scripts.

Back in 2008-2012 everybody and their mom could bot. It was so freaking easy to bot your regular account for levels. This really isn't the case anymore.

It's like y'all don't remember what it was like back in 2008, it was so much worst.

...for absolutely no benefit over an open-source and completely free one
---
Fighter Torso if you can bear that grind. It has a strength bonus so can increase your max hit
---
Obsidian armor if you can't be asked to get the Fighter. It also has a strength bonus. If you wear the full set and use an obsidian weapon your max hit and accuracy are increased by 10%. If you use a berserker necklace is increase your max hit by another 20%. Full obsidian with an obsidian sword and berserker necklace is actually a very good combo.
---
The D plate is so expensive because the piece to make it is  1/5k from Rune Dragons.
---
If your attack and strength add up to 130, and you haven't already, go to the Warrior's Guild and get a dragon defender. It's an awesome offensive offhand.

Imagine thinking you're better than anyone because you throw money away

I completely get where you‚Äôre coming from with that. I was just coming from the perspective of being told by multiple jmods over the course of the past two years that something for PvP was coming within x amount of months and it never did. I know I was being irrational with it even at the time (which is why I removed everything) but it just sucks to care a lot about something, be told changes will be coming to that something and be kept on the hook for multiple years with a throw away ‚Äúwe here your concerns‚Äù every few months.

Regardless I know I‚Äôm in the wrong here and don‚Äôt want to cause frustration for anyone else. It‚Äôs meant to be fun at the end of the day after all :)

This is not a gif.

It's like people don't remember how bad it was

Everybody could bot their mains, it was so easy to get away with.

Now it's mostly gold farming suicide bots or self written scripts. It's nothing like it used to be

---
I'm aware of the workaround, but I literally have to leave everything at 50 and runelite at 1 or 2 to make it bearable. It's fucking ridiculous. I shouldn't have to rely on third party to have listenable sound.
---
Okay? Your sense of accomplishment is different from others. Besides, the amount of players who buy max gear is irrelevant because that number is tiny. It‚Äôs confirmation bias considering it feels like often because those posts always hit the top on this subreddit. The amount of players who do so shouldn‚Äôt even be taken into consideration towards any of this discussion, 2% of the player base is under 18. Max gear will costs hundreds of dollars, you‚Äôre talking as if every new player is ‚Äúbuying‚Äù max gear which is simply not true. Most players load a few mill onto the account so they don‚Äôt have to struggle.
---
Everything you‚Äôve discussed has been, players should play the game my way and making these insanely broad assumptions. Most of the player base whose loading bonds onto their account are already returning and new players who do so are still enjoying the game and exploring everything. Instead of doing it in bronze gear, they‚Äôll be doing it into a dragon chain and dragon legs. Having 3m worth of starting gp doesn‚Äôt change a new players experience, it just makes it less miserable. This is also taking into consideration the tiny percentage of new players who load money onto their accounts. 
---
In regards to talking about existing players who return to the game, it does not make achievements less valuable loading 10m onto their account. Your sense of achievement is drastically different then another players. To me, grinding out 70 slayer broke as fuck is not an achievement considering I‚Äôve done the grind many times now. Existing players are primarily the people loading gp on their accounts to skip petty grinds, the one who don‚Äôt see achievement in quickly going through those levels don‚Äôt do so. 
---
All in all to summarize, the playerbase who actually buys max gear is fucking tiny so isn‚Äôt even something to consider, new players will still be able to enjoy the game fully if the small percentage that do buy bonds to give themselves some starting gp, they‚Äôre still new to the game and still have the entire game to explore. ‚ÄúEffeciencyscape‚Äù hasn‚Äôt ruined the game, most of the player base are veterans who already know the game, there‚Äôs no enjoyment to just walking around killing bears anymore since that‚Äôs no longer new to them. Almost all of us didn‚Äôt know how to play the game to begin with which is why ‚Äúeffeciencyscape‚Äù wasn‚Äôt as rampant. 
---
Did you also think about the fact that people find being efficient fun? I grind efficiently to get to content that I want to do, it‚Äôs fun to me to be efficient in achieving my goals and get to where I desire. Your statements are extremely broad and misleading overall mate and most of what you said only applies to less than 1% of the player base.

The amulet (one orange gem in the middle) is for melee. It's all offense no defense. The necklace (which is several small orange gems strung together) is for range offense bonuses.

Hello,

I've also updated the list for more dice rollers, thanks.
---
imagine having a S/O
---
it was a joke referencing the comment above, saying "Don't like it don't look at it" getting a negative response
---
somehow the exact same thing, just with substitutes for "it" and "don't look at it" gets a positive response.
---
Totally forgot that teleport exists lol, I still walk to Sherlock xD
---
how is that a req?

ü¶Äü¶Ä MOBILE DEVICES ARE POWERLESS WHEN CHARGING CABLES ARE LEFT UNPLUGGED ü¶Äü¶Ä

Do it.
---
U gotta spell salmons salmones if u wanna catch the spammers
---
It‚Äôs a great comment. I‚Äôm sorry it bugs you the way I wrote it.
---
You get about 2/3 the drop rate if you do it till 99
---
I hate people like this, like genuinely hate them.
---
Whos that pokemon?
---
wait what do i say now the script ends here
---
You‚Äôre right I remember seeing it. Tbh it was a while ago, I‚Äôd expect it to be done by now.
---
Runelite already has it
---
How does private red chin area compare to black chins? 
---
I don‚Äôt really want to deal with pkers but I will if the difference is big
---
Imagine not using total level worlds, noob.
---
Calls it an underrated comment, doesn't upvote it. Sounds like self fulfilling prophecy to me
---
If I was KBD I wouldn't want to give every adventurer I met head either.
---
Good one
---
hahahah i love it when egotistical hype nerds lose their shit
---
I actually really like this as an idea. Only issue is that warding is f2p while EW is p2p. I'm sure they could work it in somehow and would love to see this happen.
---
Lol there's no way I 2ould have given that to him
---
we do raids
---
You guys replied so many times to say the same things a different way.
---
Fuck spinners.
---
no shit
---
I did though, when I first saw it.
---
Honestly mate if your as ditsy as me, only take 1.5k at a time, I‚Äôve died a couple times chinning monkeys in the mm1 caves just through letting my prayer drop, it happens so by having low amounts on you the loss will never be that big
---
What stats should I have to do zulrah. I'm in the upper 40s on all combat stats. Heck,  what stats do I need to do any of the cool bosses (or any bosses) that drop some nice stuff?
---
Time and money
---
It still shows zero for me, maybe im just a brainlet
---
It‚Äôs probably the crack lol.
---
I got the head 10 kills after I posted this lol
---
Anyone have any idea how much data per hour mobile uses?
---
Exactly. Not sure why its not since it was so simple
---
Added, thanks :) hopefully I'll catch you on sometime
---
Commit not breathing.
---
London has a higher COL than the US dipshit
---
I know far more about this than you.
---
I didn‚Äôt know waring was F2P, i just want then to finish the content, i really liked EW series too
---
Where‚Äôs your list bro?
---
God Ash pls hotfix
---
Where is your list???
---
Bad title then - you said client, not app :x
---
If you think Perdu has collected a lot, take a look at Mod Reach
---
It was better in terms of trading tbh. Being a merchant was a gameplay choice, instead of being an autonated system
---
We're in the minority when it comes to not liking excessive convenieces though, I guess
---
what a unit
---
How rare is that?
---
Good
---
The best advice is to just not train construction on mobile. The painful long press duration makes tasks like this way more difficult than they should be.
---
Yeah due to disconnects they changed it to one hour. Would suck to lose your stuff due to a DDoS or server failure right?
---
I never once said or even implied that. If you felt like I did then you're probably the ones with the insecurities here, mate.
---
Yea saw it on stream too, what a unit.
---
Yes, unless it's a one use key like the crystal key.
---
False
---
I just learned this the other week!
---
Rs3 bad!
---
Congratz man.
---
My uim is at 97 atm.
---
Enjoy the real world for me :(
---
I‚Äôll wreck your bitch ass
---
Yo deadass what I said
---
Full obsidian with berserker necklace and obby sword is also very good.
---
Ok I‚Äôll check on runelite
---
I got mine at 72. Used PC to train to 70 range from like 66ish
---
Void is bis when using blowpipe. Full arma when using tbow.

Was this at the draynor bank on w307
---
Guy walked uo to a giant group repeatedly begging for 100k
---
i actually work at a place that allows me to have my phone out as long as there are no customers so i'd say i would probably run like 5 wintertodt rounds before putting it down as to not over do it and get the privilege taken away
---
Dang. Didn't even know the crushed nest was a thing lol good job nonetheless!
---
Ah your right. Mobile made it seem like 2 columns only lol
---
Never got into EoC pvp, but compared to WoW:
---
 OSRS has a higher focus on reflexes, muscle memory, and most importantly knowing when to take a risk
---
WoW for me has more strategy / teamplay and thinking involved (I mained disc / shadow priest, sub rogue, and frost / fire mage. Not a warrior).
---
Overall OSRS is faster paced due to 0.6 second ticks vs. 1.5 second global cooldown, more punishment for a bad decision (loss of items), and at a higher level is focused on faking out opponents with dancing/sliding (Edgeville PKing) or predicting / reacting to the other player (bridding). Takes more muscle memory
---
WoW (as a healer) is more strategic, such as looking at the situation and quickly creating a plan with your teammate to win. As a DPS its more about execution (as least in my 3's teams). I was generally the one keeping track of enemy cooldowns, telling my DPS what they can and can't do based on my available cooldowns, and calling for DPS cooldowns when needed. The two are just different kinds of thinking--OSRS is smart risk taking, WoW is about creating and executing a plan
---
13" thin laptops are for internet browsing and using office products. if youre using runelite, its actually quite cpu intensive
---
Why does it matter? Shifters can tele past gate. Defilers and torchers can shoot over the gate. Splatters don't attack the night and I'm low key sure neither do the bmfs. And shredders will just kill the gate and walk around. I don't honestly get the reason for keeping them shut. It just makes it harder for me to get from the night to the dudes attacking him.
---
Boooooooo
---
Teashirts lore videos are pretty nice, tough they are like 15mins at best
---
Thank you, I've made those changes, and I've also updated some of the code to work better.
---

69/69/60 combat and 56 slayer. Black mask worth the \~800k? Or should I try and grind for it through a drop. Don't have slayer helm yet
---
Pretty sure that's an angle you can't get with the standard client.
---
False.
---
Some people like the idea of seeing it fill up. Like a collectathon. Not for everyone maybe but I like it.
---
The time that you spend grinding for a mask could be used for making 800k on a good task
---
Something something engine work
---
I'm stating that the implementation of RubeLite's extended render distance plugin into the base game isn't as simple as you believe.
---
How did you get 99 hp one at a time?
---
They abandoned the "HTML5 Client" in favour of the native NXT client. When NXT launched, they said they will support the Java calient (which could run in a browser) for a limited amount of time before completely killing it off.
---
I switched to toggle instead of press and hold and it works a little bit better but it is very click intensive.
---
Unfortunately i got 99 fishing, woodcutting, and cooking before mobile came out, and now I have enough money to go for 99 construction, which is the 99 that ive always wanted the most
---
I mean, it makes sense.
---
Runescape is just another planet floating around right? 
---
I want a sick galaxy skybox fucking NOW. 
---
I want to see guthixs planet in the distance.
---
How much are the cape of skulls selling for?
---
But con exp is better than a stupid hammer. Exp is life.
---
Yeah I am not asking for special treatment. It is purely an economical thing.
---
You risk skulling and getting almost assuredly nothing from me as an iron while wasting 5k in runes and your time as well as all that inventory space for 27 platebodies for what? 15k profit? 
---
Just trying to see if there is a hidden reason.
---
Granted, the 2007scape servers are seized by the government and used as an infinite power source, the game itself is never played again.
---
I do it and I'm legit btw f2p btw
---
Thanks for help. I usually combo eat during this phases, I can land some hits during acid phase. I will try to improve tho.
---
I‚Äôm only 63 rc atm, what‚Äôs the method when I hit 77?
---
yeah
---
It's just a little cancer, Stan.
---
That's actually 2 paragraphs. I thought I would make it easier on you to break down the flaws in what you've said individually since you seem to have trouble grasping basic concepts. I guess even that was too much for you. I hope your day gets better, though. I'm sorry someone else spending $3 to support a client triggers you so much. If you need someone to talk more in-depth with about your issues feel free to pm me. I'm here for you.
---
Man buying bonds makes this game ez scape
---
You‚Äôre the brainlet if you‚Äôre wasting your time collecting steel plates on an iron
---
They‚Äôre also totally hatchets. A hatchet is a short, one-handed axe. The items in game are not axes.
---
r/cursedimages
---
Dont you fucking tee-hee me you bitch!
---
I don't think anyone actually hates calling hatchets. Or at least I hope so haha
---
Congrats, I still feel punished to do partner slayer rather than encouraged, I do too well? fuck me, I play more without them? fuck me, I have more quests done or better gear? Fuck me, sounds terrible.
---
Multilines has already been made but they decided not to implement it for being too OP. Really stupid imo since you can mark the tiles, it just takes a little bit longer.
---
lol I used to play Wynncraft, level 101 magic main btw.  
---
Also I remember there was a server called Minescape which was all the f2p world and part of p2p recreated into Minecraft, with custom plugins and texture pack that recreated all skills, mobs, some quests and other RS mechanics. Shame it closed like 2 years ago, really liked it
---
lol at the champ doing konar slayer
---
I went 341kc dry for my first unsired
---
Why 84?
---
Fuck that shit I‚Äôm taking them tassets and finishing my trip with 0kc
---
My buddy just did it the other day. With paying for priority it cost him 45m
---
One is mostly open source and takes in donations. The other was made by a former bot script selling website that requires you to pay to get the same features you get for free in runelite. People tend to prefer companies that operate on good faith and genuine love for the game, rather than companies that seek only to make profit. I'm not saying osbuddy sucks, as I used to use it before runelite. I'm just pointing out that runelite accepts donations and isn't a for profit business model.
---
The off brand slayer helm though
---
Full nexus at 92.
---
Then explain to me how I can make some money at 800 total on mobile without using nature runes? Don't  hate on my method if you don't have an excuse for a better one.
---
There‚Äôs a good chance they haven‚Äôt looked you up and seen you‚Äôre iron, even so, I have killed an Ironman before and got about 300 law runes out of it. If they‚Äôre looking to skull up anyway then they‚Äôll just kill whatever is available.
---
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
---
Yeah ... I ran past the rimmington poh portal earlier and was like wtf is the warding icon doing here - can‚Äôt believe they recycled that
---
Oh right, you must have a lot of money to afford that! No tips, just prepare yourself for one hell of a grind
---
I wish a lot more posts were as wholesome and cute as this one ;w;
---
^^^^even ^^^^if ^^^^this ^^^^one ^^^^is ^^^^a ^^^^repost... ^^^^):
---
Haha. Saving up for small QoL boosts like that to make my future pvm grinds better.
---
Gotcha. No reasonable excuse other than chance to get it big. Like gambling makes sense. I ways make it a point to talk in chat so they can see my head.
---
How about multilines. Is there any way this is going to be implemented? I know it was rejected a while ago but it seems so silly considering you can mark tiles aswell.
---
Honestly never gotten burned by a doubler, although I rarely try my luck. 
---
Yeah its stupid for anyone to give them their money like this, but I never give much and never give more than I'm willing to lose. They must think that if they double my 20-50k I'll try it with more cash but I just peace out.
---
I don't believe the engine work excuse, because if nmz it cycles through the music for all of the bosses you're currently fighting so the shuffle technology is there
---
No, runelite is the best youre gonna get, unless you use the vanilla client
---
Your collection deserves a bronze medal.
---
I played Sea Shanty 2 once and got 99 sailing instantly
---
For the sun diamond part isn't symmetrical. Compare the right part that has a reasonable stair shape and the clusterfuck on the left. Top and bottom have normal stairs on one side but uneven steps on the other.
---
wow gratz this is one of the rarest capes in game if i recall.
---
Do you have GPU off? Do you have low detail on? GPU really fucks up shit computers if they're trying to run a video or something similar at the same time.
---
holy shit that is an actually usefull idea alltogether with the Ring of Connection which ports you, when you loose connection
---
Just take the risk and let us know
---
I got a noob buddy in the Karamja Volcano who can use them
---
Probably Motherlode Mine
---
Just use an imbued msb for slayer until you make the switch to blowpipe. No need for a crossbow at barrows. Get it if you start doing bossing and using dragon bolts. Otherwise just skip it for now. Better things to spend cash on.
---
pretty fast if ur into collecting untradable items took me like 50 hours just to finish my blurite swords
---
When you realize he's trying to use the credit card scanner to straighten his bill to use the vending machine.

are u simple
---
Anything Jagex does to stop them will be circumvented and prone to false positives. A chat filter like this is exclusive to a small subset of players and invisible to the spammers, and so is much, much harder to circumvent.
---
Im 60 kc higher than u with 3 pets 2 def n 1 chest so uhh fuck off
---
Get a mages book and eternal boots. Use rune darts if you aren't already
---
Yea on steel dragon tasks most people need both spawns. The time u waste waiting for one to spawn makes the task a lot longer.
---
Michael-Jackson-ass coward

ur an idiot hahahah

people arent logging from u, they are hopping to find other pkers lmao, and they are dding you to do the same

nobody in teams type lmfao so it's obvious ur a brainlet pvmer le trolling XD!

GE shows on any given day around 400-700 tbows are traded. 
---
So there would be well over 1trillion gp in circulation

hey man I just like it when the numbers get bigger

I think it will be man, once you throw in those fruit trees and hardwoods your levels will go very fast for a while. And after the first couple runs once you have your route memorized how you want to do it it'll only take a couple minutes a day.

True!

its used for pking to 1tick.

I don't think this is a healthy view of addiction. It's been established that addiction is a hard wired impulse toward activating reward centers. Pair that with a game where you spend the majority of the time literally clicking a button to get a treat and it's no wonder people become very addicted to it.
---
I think I know exactly what you mean
---
Well why isn't it champions quest 2??
---
Or respect that he does not want to do it? Or doesn't enjoy the content? lmao how do we change your mind that just because you want people to do something, and they do not, doesn't mean we have to change anything about said person.

It‚Äôs fucking crazy that this video was uploaded **11 years ago** and is still completely relevant today. If you told me in 2008 that I would still be playing RuneScape now I would have laughed at the idea.
---
Yeah unless it's 2k+ sometimes those worlds have popular spots taken bc it's the first place people try to go.
---
Only pvm with Indians or language barrier?

Leviathan Weiners invite Anal Yeeting?
---
I don't mind being called a brainlet but I don't think asking a question about why something happens.
---
I understand the answer. People need to have their two cents and comment the same thing without reading the edits or other people's comments that they already answered it.
---
I have been playing this game for 15 years. I understand how and why it works. I don't understand why some people do what they do and wanted to see if I could get an answer.
---
Yet, people are too ass hurt and too emotional about this topic apparently that they give answers like this. You aren't really open about a lot of things in life are you? Because this is a closed minded comment.
---
Pures are brainlets for not taking two seconds to analyze if something is worth it or not. However, I understand why they are brainlets.
---
Funny how a lot of this kind of toxic is on the OSRS but its opposite on RS3. Mainly toxic people on there are elitist

if there is demand there is supply
