I've been wanting my original account that got hijacked and banned 4 years ago.

Why was this so soothing?

its just a glorified private server lmao

Very few EHPers actually like barrage tasks. But it'd be stupid to not do it if it's in the game.
---
What‚Äôs so important about knowing what‚Äôs going on?

Different spells and many are capable of hitting targets in multiple squares in a single cast, so you can kill a bunch of dust devils at a time

load times under a second and fairy ring is like 5 squares away

Full obby with the obby sword and defender + b nexclace is best xp before full dh at like 94 hp

Easy mode makes it so that you don't even actually get hit most of the time (Watch the vid, blue 0's are misses and don't affect your absorb, the red 0's are hits that were absorbed)

Lmao okay, i really dont know much about this game so i genuinely had no idea lol

magpies and natures are both significantly better for getting a hard clue scroll than ninjas, since the math comes out to ~60k per hard clue for magpies and ~70k per nature, assuming regular rates of loot and the impling jar remaining intact, where ninjas make you spend about ~210k per hard clue. 
---
the osrs wiki has the estimations. maybe they're actually inaccurate, but i've been pretty happy with my results from doing natures and magpies over ~200 hard clues.

i know its not easy, but the hardest part of raids is learning them.  I'm going to assume that you can solo raids even in min gear at this point and then slowly progress your gear back while getting drops.  As someone who has had to deal with this before, the information you already know for pvm is more valuable then your current bank networth.
---
Go play rs3 if you want that feature.
---
now if i could actually get dust devils or nechs.. probably 5 levels dry on devils and ONE nech task during 80-82. are they really this rare?

*gets infernal cape first attempt conveniently during these 2 weeks*

Yeah you're right. I did go from nothing to 1.5B from solo raiding pretty much. Sad to see the hours go away tho

It's easy to add good content to slayer. All it takes is a new boss or dungeon or monster. It's hard to add good content to skills that have no good content which is a lot of skills.

Great post

My understanding of this game tells me, that you can do this all you want, but at the end of the day, it will fuck up something completely remote of what everyone is thinking of.

What else is there to do mid game for clans? Every time someone asks to have an event or do something communal its Dags / Gwd / Corp. Minigames are either not clan queue friendly, dead content, or have no team play (windertodt). Other bosses are either slayer bosses, wildy bosses, or solo instanced bosses. I know raids opens up a decent chunk of content but a lot of my lower levels arent ready for that
---
Whats your range lvl? Its a piece of cake with bp.

Nah fuck you

You really think it's this interesting? The content is not worth obsessive circlejerking for months on end on reddit.

Saw my brother playing it on our Grandmas computer during a holiday and got my first account that day. That was back in 2006, and I think there wasnt GE back then. Lots of people hiring others to get cow hide for them. Sometimes I wish we could have made dedicated servers to pre-GE OSRS, kinda like iron man but you can trade with people.
---
Anyone have any Galvek tips for ds2? I keep getting killed by that animation attack that goes the whole fight. When I don't screw those up though, I'm always running out of food.
---
I'm using the recommended def gear (verac helm, karil robe, verac skirt). I'm bringing combo food and 3 Sara brews. The damage I'm having to tank though just does too much. I'm outta food before wave 4 starts. 
---
Oh, and I'm 85 def. I know getting my def up could help, but there's no reason I shouldn't be able to do it now.
---
It still had authenticator on it, just not my phones. I would've gotten a mail if someone logged into my gmail on a different device. He must've done everything without accessing my gmail

Your fault

I'm personally 80 farming and know practically nothing about the skill.  I barely even herb run, I've done like less than 5 runs ever.  Trees are so good and easy that I've just never much cared to learn anything else about the skill, especially since I've never liked it.

This is a skewed number though.  If someone gets multiple vork pets and you start counting on the kill they got the first one, they will almost always be above droprate.  Almost 1 pet above droprate, specifically.

To be fair, the catacomb ones have much better drops, so if someone wants to melee them, it's still more lucrative to do in the catacombs. At least dust devil's have one room with less in it that mages don't use. But meleers should aleaye expect competition at nechreayls
---
Did with 80 def 84 range. Make sure you‚Äôre using ruby bolts (e) for the majority of the fight, it speeds it up a lot. You should always have Galvek in your camera so you can see his tell for that attack, but you should always be moving anyways unless you‚Äôre on the water phase. 
---
I mean you could be a zerker get 94 mage and vengeance, 80+str 60+attack getting your range up is pretty optional depending mostly if you plan on deep wildy/nhing or clanning

lmaoooooooo thank u!

Buying birdhouses will eat into your profit margin if you're doing it for the seeds/birdhouses. If you only want hunter exp, I'd say just buy it and forego crafting them yourself.

typically RS hackers don't rat/keylog (prob 0.1% or less of hacks occur this way)

typically it's due to a few a few things:

- broken recovery system that Jagex won't fix

- phishing / shared acc (phishing typically only affects fairly new players)

I think most things in the Wild should get influenced by the energy of Zamarok. But this is a nice start

I think just diving into the game is best, thats how I went into it when I was 14 around 2006. No guides basically, I made the best memories that way. Find a skill you like and train it, maybe do quests. Then I recommend you become an ironman of some sort. But it‚Äôs all up to you, which is trhe beauty of this game. Welcome to RS btw.

Depends on how you die. I think it may be kept on PvM Death, even if 30+ Wildy... But I don't want to die to Callisto with protect item off again to verify...

Not really, almost everything is available though, with inferno being the notable exception.

Yes you can, you can very easily test it yourself if you dont believe me.

The real question are you maxed tho ?

&gt; Not to mention, it creates home teletab-&gt;pool-&gt;barrows portal/nexus tele-&gt;repeat.
---
as opposed to home tab-&gt;pool-&gt;barrows tab-&gt;repeat?

a tele to barrows is a tele to barrows. having to pay a few k per tab is no less harmful than having a free tele to barrows.

A ton of consumables are crashing. It's likely because of the rise from when mobile dropped.

At least in this case it isn't that bad of a change. Like I'd prefer to have more options in how you train than just new course=better, but if Rellekka was better than Tele-Seers it wouldn't ruin the skill or anything. The same is less true of other suggestions recently...

Probably. There is an official concept for new death mechanics from the other year. They'd like to add them, but it still needs more revision from feedback and they haven't had the time to fit it in. I recall it was less than an hour, but I think it was still more than 10 minutes.
---
Me playing apex legends: 
---
My teammate: Hear that gunfire? Lets run straight at it!
---
Me: that.. sounds terrible... I'll lead the way
---
Literally a .015% chance this doesn‚Äôt happen of this happening
---
Relax. I'm sure they get thousands of emails every day with false claims. 
---
And not a single pro mouse in sight üò™ f1
---
Not in this context, faggot. 
---
They can change it without a poll since the current mechanics were never polled. They are temporary death mechanics so it would revert back to the 2 minute version unless the community approves another system.
---
The only problem with a lower death timer is that even a 10/15min timer wouldn't punish a normal player. Every boss is reachable in that time period; it would only hurt you if you DC; your internet shouldn't be the determining factor of whether or not you lose bank.
---
Which half the game does lol 
---
This is a christian reddit please.
---
Thats spaghetti
---
ok i see what you're saying: there arent enough logs to keep up with demand, so we need more reasons for people to want to harvest logs.
---
Only a blow job...? Yikes man
---
the specific topic is whatever, its more of a worrying trend. its the fact that they seem to lack even a basic understanding of the game and the arguments they use to defend their positions really makes me concerned about the future of the game.
---
Hmm I hadn't thought about that - that's a really good point.
---
What if you could only re-roll location once? That way it gave some option, but still kept it somewhat varied instead of just being able to re-roll until you got your preferred location?
---
You'll always have Pieve.
---
Which bank? Theres 5 houses.
---
I didn‚Äôt do anything to anyone. So why you being toxic?
---
I agree, so I would vouch for a 2 minute timer, 3 at the most. At that point it becomes visible to every one else, and disappears the normal span of time after that.
---
Can't really tell whether you got it and got out or got it and then died. 
---
Pretty useless image. 
---
SC was always popular up until EoC (IDK after that because I quit). 
---
They don't have to make the rewards identical, they just need something to make it worth playing so that it's not a straight up waste of time like Castle Wars. 
---
Still don‚Äôt see a point in it . There plenty of other things to spend points plus some slayer monsters only have 2 different places or even one like wyrms. 
---
Got it and banked my shit to log off.
---
If pkers are retarded, then what about the pvmers who bring their bank with them into the wilderness?
---
Do I still have 100% accuracy if I mage in Proselyte armour?
---
You can risk basically nothing with a pure as long as you don't get smited regularly and just do fine.
---
You won't really be making money off other pures though, unless you get a smite. You'll have to huntpvmers for lootations. 
---
That‚Äôs the incentive to use Konar and visit other places not normally used
---
It wasn't an iconic or fun minigame imo, but even then I'd support it being added **except**, OSRS has already added a fuckload of fishing updates that make fish flingers redundant. 
---
I would imagine that they could use the same system that uses the g.e. value to determine what items are lost on death. 
---
Why not wield it for the image?
---
You being nekked in Edgeville just make me assume you died. 
---
Thank you to Auenke, Zulhaar, Riot S Retro, Trinky, UIM, JV(Prezleek) and all the rest of yall for inspiring me to draw again. Just bought my first drawtablet today and knew what i needed to do right away. Thanks Everyone!

It hasn't been a while, there's posts about that dog every couple of days dear god I think they get the point
---
Not true. They are not always lost like rune pouch es etc. They are just worth so little essentially everything has priority. 4 iteming with protect item and then suiciding has worked since osrs release 
---
But why 
---
Do you have a link/name for those mini keyboards?
---
Me, the other black guy.

Likely players attempted to prepare Guthans for Konar Slayer. Once they realized it wasn't optimal or kept getting tasks that have range/mage as better choices they panic sold.

Stories like this are why I compulsively bank invent + worn items every night before logging out. The bank pin is your last line of defense.

A friend told me about the game and showed me it back in 2005 or so? At first I thought it was called Runestone or something like that (I was probably like 10 years old)  finally figured out that it was called Runescape. And it's all history from there

I think slayer looks best, I never like the light blue of fishing but to each their own.

I am thinking of grinding out 99 fishing since in May I will have two months off from work and school and literally no money to do anything outside of the weekends, so I figured I could set my account up to be fun for when I won't have time. I saw the guy post his friend with 54k sharks banked because he is addicted, I wanted to do that but figured it is afk enough I can just do it at work. Probably will focus on slayer and getting all combat skills up since it is less afk, maybe even bring my rc up from 0xp.

Then the only real repetition is in the skilling aspect, the part of the game that, in its inception, was never intended to be done to 99. Part of the enjoyment is the challenge of endurance, which kinda implies repetition.

Did you ever play the style of games RS was (attempting) to imitate? The entire genre was built around clicking at that time. Maybe it‚Äôs only painfully clear because your threshold for suspension of disbelief is so high.

I miss this fucking game, luckily I left myself some gold so I'm buying a bond and going back to it right now.

Maybe my reply went to someone else, but I actually wanted to suggest a middle ground for PvM resource supplies entering the game (a hot issue lately) and skilling providing those resources. Since flat nerfing PvM of all its resource supplies is an unpopular option for a lot of people, I wanted to propose Elf city instead have an option for faster woodcutting trees (let's call them Elderly Magic trees) that are basically non-PvM ents or minnows - really fast log gathering for little xp. and is meant for an endgame woodcutting option. But since sharks crashed from minnows, elf city should also have a sink for the logs as well, since in the event too many logs are entering the game from this update, they're also given a resource dump directly in the city that ties (logs specifically) to a price other than their alch values, which could be higher without hurting PvM prices - actually buffing PvM prices. 
---
It wouldn't be a long term fix because when crystal shards slowly lose relevancy in 2020 and beyond the demand for shards will drop below the alch value of the logs and its back to step 1, but I wonder if it would make skillers happy without making PvMers mad experimentally.

I didn't.

Why is it that I can deactivate 2 step auth with in 3 days but it take 7 to remove my bank pin? Dont you think auth should be just as important to have on hold for 7 days.. seeing as theres no REAL customer support if someone is being hacked, getting their account locked/safe depends on their amount of reddit upvotes. I love the game but your security is poor.

I camped cyclops pre EoC whe we had the cyclops mask, and we got noted drops. I had soooo many dragon defenders, and the masks were free to play items. They had a fairly high value in the g/e (I think this was during trade limit? It was a long time ago) but didn't actually sell. However, they had a very odd graphical glitch where if you sat down while wearing one, your head would stretch out like crazy.

I sold them in edgeville bank advertising them as 'glitch helms', and they sold like wildfire.

Its comments like this that remind me this community once had a meltdown over a rainbow scarf.
---
1. Has been happening since day one. Only difference is brid fights used to be primarily smite/no overheads and became nhing when PvP was more powerful leading up to EoC. Everything else has been pretty standard. 
---
2. Although that‚Äôs more psychological/your own greed getting in the way, I would agree that mace clans have scared some people off. But then again you should never assume your +1 is safe and only risk what you can afford to lose.
---
Eh not really lol

So what about Barrows though?

Lines up so well
---
Probably because the lines are blurry and it would be more difficult to police than other bugs. A better question would be why haven't the safespots been fixed, they could blunt force it by adding new barriers on those routes so the boss wouldn't pass anyway. It would hardly be difficult to fix

In modern European countries were it‚Äôs legal, this is a pretty normal rate tbh

Agreed. The fight through Drakan's Castle in *The Lord of Vampyrium* is probably my favorite part of any quest in RuneScape.

Also, while this one probably wouldn't work in OSRS, the hallucination scenes in *River of Blood* were just stunning.

Does some sort of farming guild contract google doc sheet exist that I can use to see if it's worth doing the contract? I have lvl 99 farming and always do hard.

Right, but it doesn't vary when killing different monsters. Catacombs nechs vs slayer tower nechs vs crawling hands, every monster in the game with a superior version has a 1/200 chance of spawning

Could it be made easier to keep untrimmed capes untrimmed?  Not necessarily making it so you can get them retroactively, but at least making it so we don't have to drop and telegrab them every time we get a new cape.

I find people doing KBD not to really be worth it.  Your usual runner will have black dhide, prayer potions, good food, a short distance to escape, and not that great loot.  Occasionally you get someone who thought it'd be cool to bring thousands of diamond bolts (e), or maybe I'm just unlucky?

Nechs give 1m profit per task? You aren‚Äôt forced to do cerb/hydra etc. You can just do quests and focus vorkath demonic gorillas zulrah. I‚Äôd rather use these tasks to build up gear. It‚Äôs not that easy going from onyx to zenyte, d boots to primordial, fighter torso to bandos etc. Takes some grinding but that gear is kinda required for high end slayer bosses anyways i assume.

2 questions
---
1:  
---
can you look into a method to detect disconnection and activate ring of life, suggestion would be to ping the client when ring is equipped, not return response server activates ring. even if only for hc/uim  
---
uim status lose over disconnection rather than game play is a stupid thing, and protects the prospect of the game instead of losing all that work and effort from something out of your hands.  
---
2:  
---
new item eternal duel ring acts like ring of suffering, holds charges, recharge with duel rings 10k charges, 1/100k chance while enchanting duel rings.   
---
if theres a technical reason why the charges cant be transferred, why not just make something like the crystal items (with no loss in power) and it always tiers down when it drops in wils so it can't be abused.

I.e. die in wild with a 6/10 whip and pkers get a 5/10.

Newbie Melody has always been the #1 definitive rs banger imo, sorry Sea Shanty 2

Probably for a number of reasons. One being I admitted almost instantly that it was a repost and used the meme to try and get my situation heard by a mod and 2, this meme is just as relevant as the last 4 times it has appeared this year on this sub

Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing my Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can‚Äôt leave Morytania. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescape‚Äôs biggest challenges: the Theatre of Blood.

I done this before when my membs ran out saying I would just do some f2p stuff to get my total up and ended up doing fm all the way to 99 from 65 but this is when bonfires were a thing so I sat in g.e chilling and talking

Yeh knew a guy who botted 1k rune defenders lmao. 
---
Okay so it's been nearly a month. I kept a spreadsheet for the first like 15 days.... 
---
At which point it became apparent that I just had awful RNG for the 2 days following the drop.
---
So I stopped because I could generally see no difference
---
That's reassuring to hear, but it was an unappealable macro ban where they say in the evidence they have looked over it and decided they are right, which is either (hopefully) an automatic email, or a mod has made a devastating mistake 
---
It's only uphill from the first bottke: you were sober before, now you've got ur buzz goin and the empty bottle makes a cracking weapon.

I mean if you are doing end game pvm i expect the player to be good at this game. 
---
If you cant handle some 6 way switches without your client highlighting your items what kind of end game should that be.
---
Me too
---
When in Free to play, Flex that FashionScape YO :')
---
Unfortunately yes they said it was a macro ban and un appealable. I then went to the appeals page, appealed it and the appeal was granted.
---
Weak to crush 
---
I mean i cant say much as im not at end game,  but is it not like tick manipulation? Trying to make it efficient,  so being able to do the switches while still attacking or move etc will save them time, so for being doing end game non stop, it will save them considerable time in the long run
---
They have answered it many times already though, it wasn't even that long ago when they last answered it. Maybe you should actually watch the Q&amp;As.

Give me some crystal

There's a seperate section on their website where you can appeal bans (Might only be in the case of hijacking though?) I had my account hijacked and botted MLM, I appealed it and Jagex gave me back my account :) Worth looking into, I did have to tweet them first though for a link to the unban section because I doubt I would've been able to find it on their website by myself (may be purposely 'hidden')

CocaineDebt, must be having a wonderful life if this is how he spent his time..
---
The words you were looking for were fuck and you. 
---
Of course it's going to be less profitable overall. PvP is a zero sum activity in all but bounty hunter worlds. The reality is that pvp in osrs is only made profitable by the new players who enter the wilderness/pvp worlds. It's basically a pyramid scheme.
---
By "They" I mean the majority of the skiller/pve guys who praise clicking on a spot for 50 hours over a learned "skill" wich is pking. This is not reaching out. 
---
I do not want to defend pking. In fact I don't care, I dont play this game. I just tought this was an interesting topic. 
---
&gt;they want to get something they don't get in real life.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Do you hear yourself?
---
Escapism is common in this community. I do not mean anybody of course, but I would argue that well over 70 % are finding something in the game, that they do not get irl and that is maybe: easy dopamine.
---
Pvm/skilling: easy reward hormone  
---
pvp: not so easy reward hormone  
---
But you can add your thoughts to the theory instead of taking it personal and insulting me.
---
What other Hunter pet is there besides the baby chiN?
---
If he died at 50 fm does that mean he died on his first attempt?
---
well they couldn't have gotten all that out of thin air, your first and last name is all he needs
---
How do you know about all the aspects of his life?
---
He's in a position to make income easily doing the thing his parents have enabled him to do, they are going to die eventually and he's not only going to be fucked but he's going to have also given them back nothing in life when they allowed him to "succeed" in the first place. Most parents would kick their kid out if he did nothing but runescape all day.
---
Meme review this
---
the guy obviously knows CocaineDebt. You don't go into a cc and out of nowhere see a guy doxing you. OP is hiding something 
---
Imagine getting a drawing as a gift when you're 25
---
Wait does no one else do pyramid plunder for thieving exp? I can't stand normal training methods, and the pyramid minigame is fairly quick and really good exp rates.
---
Lmfao üòÇ

Wtf why are you showing his rsn??

Two wrongs dont make a right

Haha

Can the agility Cape be buffed? Ita one of the most 'intense' 99s after runecrafting and even a small buff such as the hood also working as a graceful would make it seem worth it 
---
Don‚Äôt mind the virgins in here hating on you, the closest thing they have to a fianc√©e is the hentai drawings posted on this sub.
---
Differences of perspective. The obvious observation to me was that anyone willing to blackjack for 6 hours straight must be braindead. 
---
Yeah but what's the backstory?
---
What if op doxed or hacked or w/e that guy? Sure doesn't make it 'right', but without any explanation it's just fucking stupid.
---
Swampletics good
---
How is it extreme? Rs3 literally has that
---
&gt; Play a p-server like everyone else or practice in clan wars. That shouldn‚Äôt be an excuse since everyone started from 0. People are too attached to their money that they won‚Äôt put the sweat equity into getting better. It doesn‚Äôt help that new pkers are coming from a PvM background which has safe deaths and instant gratification as well.
---
Even back in the day it was intimidating to start PKing so your last sentence is irrelevant. If anything it was *more* intimidating back then because dying meant losing proportionally more of your bank than you would at present since making money is significantly easier nowadays. 
---
It's also a bit naive to say that being intimidated by the skill gap isn't an excuse. Like that literally is an excuse lol. Lots of people don't want to try new things because of how intimidating they are and saying that can't be a reason for not trying out pking is weirdly dismissive and illogical. Look at this from a new/inexperienced player's perspective. Not your own.

That one is gold but yes!!! The way everyone gets hype after the drop üòÇüòÇüòÇ

If he did then the guy should also be looking for support, but there‚Äôs no excuse for doxxing, even retaliation. We don‚Äôt need the history behind it to know that the guy doxxing should be banned

Go to the police man. Doxing is illigal and can carry a sentence of up to 3 years in prison. Asking Jagex support to take care of this is not the proper approach. Take this more seriously before something happens that could have been prevented.

Lynx is at least normal intelligence so that doesn‚Äôt apply to him

Is that true? Idk what you mean by functional but if you mean they can live a rather normal life, I've met plenty of autistic people at school and shit and don't really ever hear about severely autistic (like unemployable) people honestly

I tried googling statistics but dont see much

?????????????
---
Just do ardy knights on mobile while chillin out
---
Lmao no. Agility isn't even that bad, just watch something on the side
---
Why really doesn't matter. Doxing is illigal for a reason as it can carry very serious real world implications. I'm sure OP was a dick but it doesn't make doxing him justified. 
---
dont listen to this guy. the shit quality is part of the charm. add unregistered hypercam 2 to the top please.

What are those boots. Please, let me be hallucinating

You could pk on an account with 90 all melees, 90 range and 94 mage without any bother at all. Most people these days have high strength and as long as you're 75 attack and defence you'll be fine to pk, this whole "specialised build" argument is dogshit.
---
If you want to have fights consistently and be able to go to certain areas in the wild and get more fights then having multiple accounts in different brackets is amazing...
---
Also to make a second account that is fit for pking then all you need is an account with 50 attack and 50 strength with 60 range. Takes about 2 hours to quest to 45 attack from scratch. The rest you afk at crabs for a day. Then you've got a gmauler in the most active bracket that cost you no more to make than 2 hours of Vorkath... There ya go, you can die 20x and barely lose any money whilst learning the basics.. 
---
update on the situation?
---
This is a great idea, it's just begging to be a longer video... Please? 
---
Woah dude, What a drama. Id call this post FAKE if I didnt know better. 
---
Well I think 'being interesting' is a very difficult task for most, especially those who are autistic. And I don't think being #1 would've been enough to maintain consistently high viewer counts. Hey Jase is pretty entertaining and #2 yet *only* gets 200 viewers.
---
Although, for certain events the content could be interesting enough - notably, the 200m all. If he streamed 200m all with a small party, he would've likely generated thousands of dollars in donations.
---
Or you can spend around 4 hours in BA, and save yourself 20m. For it to be worth buying, he'd have to be able to make 5m an hour, which is definitely not happening at his level. Let's be honest, the dude just bought bonds.
---
Theres no incentive to learn either coz of the shit loot compared to pvm

Hidden jmod at next event throwing around the ban hammer.
---
Yeah I have appealed the ban despite my ban saying it's unappealable, it's the fact it says unappealable that I find awful. I mean if I'm a mod and I look at a cmb 111 main with 78 herb 70 farming 99 range 75 smithing a bunch of elites done It doesn't exactly smack of a zulrah bot does it? Surely it merits enough suspicion to at least make it appearance or non permanent or something right? It just seems callous on jagex part to permaban such an obvious main in the same category as a lvl3 woodcutting bot you know? I gotta say it's pretty pathetic I never realised how much this game meant to me until now 
---
What backwater country do you live in where doxxing is illegal? lmao
---
Iirc, if you don't have space in your inventory and go to the net and walk away, the items are dropped to the ground. It could be possible that where you've sent it to the bank, it's been dropped to the floor instead.
---
One salty boi
---
The alternative is to show results after you vote. The community couldn't complain about not seeing results because all you'd have to do to see the results is vote. Everyone would know very clearly whether results were "faked" or not.  
---
Cmon' man this has already been suggested numerous times in this thread lol use your noggin'.
---
I just fucking love RS lore.
---
Birdhouse runs take about 2-3 minutes optimally. While the go earned is no longer great, I still effectively earn 80K Hunter exp per hour from them (only counting active time doing set up and collect) which is pretty awesome. So I would say they're worth doing for Hunter exp mainly with a small benefit of minor cash gains and a chance at some good cash (Magic Seeds/Dragonfruit seeds)
---
The fact that you think this means you're either 12 or retarded tbh 
---
do your clues title is only acceptable when you get the double coif drop
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
oh i know man. especially since the mobile release, i noticed that a LOT more people have been playing and totally different people. osrs used to consist entirely of stoners which was fine but i kinda wanted to meet new people and with mobile i meet a lot of people who are at work lmao. also yeah there is a LOT of content in osrs these days. it is genuinely one of the best games of all time but i just hate the aspect of grinding for SO long just for a video game
---
Honestly pretty sure he has severe autism and its probably not easy to make and narrate a bunch of videos
---
PSA: you're not special for getting a drop, pet or third age. 
---
You are special if you post unironic memes reddit
---
Where're you seeing this? Feels like fishing link that will steal your account
---
Nah man, keep registeren the fuck outta that thing
---
would you consider giving out your instagram which has your IRL name on it in a clan chat after starting a fight with someone being doxed if they found your family members names and occupations from it? Cause thats what OP did.
---
It's not illegal in a single ameriburger state.
---
Imagine thinking googling someone's username and putting their facebook name into whitepages.com is illegal.  Absolute brainlet.
---
This is false I did not give out my IG, even 'if' I did does that justify doxxing?
---
TIL
---
Nope. Not true. Cross ledge and cross plank both deal 10 damage if failed. 
---
You could get 65 agility too...
---
No disrespect intended towards you or your brother I just needed to find a pic of 99 mining so I sorted posts by top all time. Sorry if this caused offence to you 
---
For xp yes, for money not really
---
Probably spam asked people in that clan chat to check out his twitch stream where op streams himself runecrafting to My Chemical Romance with a face cam and no interaction. Of course there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúDONATE MONIES TO ME VIA PAYPAL BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO GET A JOB‚Äù button. The guy got pissed off because op is annoying as fuck, donated a dollar and got all his info via PayPal. 
---
Can‚Äôt say I blame him, people who spam their shitty twitch channels deserve it
---
its not doxing if you give out your personal information IE first / last name which are probably on your instagram which they can they facebook easily enough to find occupation, you voided your right to privacy when you did that friend.
---
what evidence do you have that it was obtained maliciously based on OP's post.
---
Not saying he owes anything to anybody, but obviously he doesn‚Äôt have the balls or mental strength to deal with the people who wanted to see him succeed.
---
I came into this thread hoping for Flute Salad
---
used maliciously. obtained maliciously I don't and I actually suspect (from talkng to people in the CC) that OP gave out his instagram and thats how they found his irl name and family members. I wouldn't even call it Doxing at this point when you give them everything they need.
---
Yeah, he is obviously referring to the deaths my man.
---
Would also support a set of Proselyte for each respective God from clue scrolls, provided it's possible to program quest requirements on clue rewards
---
I don't think you understand, it's a personal instagram only close friends and family know about it. Why would I tell online strangers about my personal instagram?
---
why is seers 80% less marks? I dont understand
---
To be fair, that's just the more commonly-used definition.
---
By older definitions, doxing is simply the act of acquiring "dox" (documents) that contained information on a particular person. The mere act of doxing is generally something that is associated with the blackhat community. Unsurprisingly, it's largely become conflated with the idea of releasing private info obtained *via* doxing.
---
This is more or less a result of the terminology surrounding the release of doxed information, which is referred to as "being doxed". Which has lead people to erroneously conclude that "doxing" *was* the release of the information.
---
As for the legality of releasing personal information, it's not outright illegal in the US at least. Depending upon whether there's a clear threat intended, or whether the information released is public (NDA, database breaches, etc.), it very easily can be.
---
That being said, just because something isn't against the *letter* of the law, that doesn't mean prosecutors won't *try* to convict you. In any case, I'd think twice about trusting the average American to understand the difference and care enough about it to prolong the trial.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
At least, that's my understanding of it.
---
380 and no uniques here
---
Lmao that was my first thought when i saw the dude‚Äôs name. 
---
Why would you need a private tab
---
That's probably because it isn't legal.
---
I think mining and slayer are the worst, I don't mind doing rc.
---
Not sure but why would they lie? they told me about the instagram bit before I Mentioned this reddit thread.
---
Wow 631k, you could buy dbewts with that
---
Nice post my bwana
---
&gt;used maliciously.
---
isn't actually illegal anywhere but the UK.
---
OP still hasn't explained why this is happening.
---
It's not even close to useless. 
---
Man.... that's some crap... I haven't been able to get much of anything from barrows 
---
Shouldn‚Äôt have a spade with you while doing agility, that‚Äôs where you fucked up. Get 6 way switched you fukkin bitch
---
wheres the original vid
---
All that dopamine is getting to his head
---
yes i do, u on the other hand clearly dont. theres no magic, if u get doxxed is 100% ur own fault, just cause he 'gave away' his info, doesnt mean it was on purpose, its still his own fault tho
---
My favourite track of all times is still easter jig. Loved that one.
---
I don't know of many doxing incidents leading to jail time, not doxing on its own. Swatting on the other hand. We all know how that turns out these days.
---
that would be amazing, thank you so much
---
Please report to the appropriate authorities. 
---
oh of course, I just thought you might be interested in what OP lied about and tried to claim as doxing. I actually wouldn't even call this doxing anymore IMO giving someone your personal information and baiting them into using it against you so you can get them perm banned via reddit is really 6d chess.
---
Why would you kill those things? They are horrible everything
---
You're cringeworthy
---
Pro tip: Do any elite clues you get, even if they're wildy clues. They're worth it
---
But this solution still has the same problem, just on a smaller scale. Instead if everyone knowing instantly what polls are, some will see the winning/losing polls being talked about in CCs, on Reddit, etc. There will still be a bias affecting the outcome.
---
But I suppose it is better than nothing
---
This bwana got his nails painted. Cute

It wasn‚Äôt even turmoil as much as ss flicking and spec sap.

What do you mean waste on slayer exp? Nechs are an amazing task to burst in catacombs. I had a nech task yesterday and got over 215k magic exp, 100k hp exp and 1.3m in drops. No reason to melee them honestly. There are plenty of other tasks you cant burst that you can use melee on.

Meet Hackedletics, my login screen locked banned main account.  After recently recovering my 2016 main account I decided to up the ante, To log back into the game.  No sleeping, no social life.

---
(Day 5 of waiting for my appeal and no end in sight ÔÅå.  My 2016 account was hacked after I took a break and was banned for macroing a few months after I quit.  Hoping to get lucky on my first appeal, pray for me)
---
is this factual? i really hope so 
---
Make it drop Abyssal vertebrae, based on the number of charges in the Tentacle?
---
Could be used to charge the Abyssal Tentacle, since the whip is an Abyssal Demon spine - so you'd basically just be adding a whip bit by bit.

---
I've done over a 1000 runs on my 10hp hardcore ironman, never died tho.
---
I definitely see ‚Äòhold-the-pain Harold‚Äô in there.
---
Yet if you open the map in mobile it still crashes the game 90% of the time.  Great Prioritization! 
---
you cant use that teleport anymore without the artefact getting destroyed. Its been patched so you wont even come close to 200k/h now.
---
the addy ores lol I'm drunk

Anybody can get people mad, but there are few places where just uttering true statements will make that happen.

No it isn't. I literally use the benefits of agility daily.

Have you tried calling your government representative?

If you are 20 Levels above the course, it has its marks reduced to 20%. Seers is level 60, so by Level 80 (Rellekka's level), it should have the harsh penalty.
---
Bringing up names only serves to lower the validity of your argument. Who cares it‚Äôs Reddit mate.
---
Now as for your points, I want you to honestly sit here and think of what an American based police force is going to do to a uk based company. I want you to even formulate what the fuck you would even tell the police in this situation without being hung up on...

10-14 15-23 is extra dmg

Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing my Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can't leave Morytania. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescape's biggest challenges: the Theatre of Blood. 
---
I recognized the post when I seen it, sorry for some peoples insensitivity 
---
To be honest you still profit a lot bursting the task after taking into consideration the rune costs. 
---
TIL i guess, 1000+ runs never died on my hc 10hp aswell
---
With due respect, if that information was available to everyone, wouldn't it of been wise to delete it, or do you mean that someone had saved your personal info with pictures etc and then doxxed you with it?
---
So you picked the dead brother one whose title you mocked? Just needed a pic of 99? ü§î
---
First of all. Level 30 teleports should be removed. Either that or move rev caves up 30 tiles so you can't teleport inside of the northern part of the cave. This would make people actually think about what they bring.   
---
Then i would nerf black d hide and xerc robes. Make Range have a "better" form of it, above making it the cost of a mystic set.   
---
I think the issue with PvP right now, is a high level pkers can use Black D hide/rune gloves/ climbing boots/ xercian robes/ 50k in runes, spirit shield (Protected) and a dds and literally be very very good at fighting/tanking/freezing  
---
This is like a 250k at most risk after supplies and you can compete vs people risking much more. (Including reck the people doing bosses with barrows)  
---
So i would increase the risk, but then i would also add some uniques to wildy bossing. Also make their profit per hour vorkath level because it is MUCH higher risk. 
---
But people will make more money doing clues
---
Ironically just started blackjacking for the desert treasure requirements....never touching this skill after 53

Saw some Chad the other day splashing on a unicorn between Camelot and Catherby.

F
---
safety + getting this dimwit banned or talked to by the cops. double value
---
Because people have been doing multiple clues at a time via dropping and picking the other one up and repeating. 
---
Just makes it less of a pain to do. 
---
Congrats bud, You know my psn.
---
Go and do something with that infomation, go on big boy put your money where you mouth is.
---
You're not gonna do shit. Because going to all that effort to find out more information stemming from that (which I'm sure you couldn't do anyway) just to find that my psn has nothing but false fake details.
---
No-one puts all their effort into doxxing over petty in game squabbling, op has done or said something, no smoke without fire.
---
By all means bud keep playing devils advocate for karma, I'll even upvote your last post seeing as you're so desperate for it.

I think you stole some of my luck sir. 70 kc dry so far

Won't stop people from voting no on any content that benefits limited accounts. This can be seen from where people voted no to removing the XP from mounting heads in your POH.

People will spite pures because they can.
---
sad because its kinda true
---
Imagine seeing 3 'Hey guys! SWAMPLETICS!' posts a day minimum.
---
Also an easy change would be making freezes harder to hit with weaker gear. But with better gear (Ahrims) Hitting more often.
---
So more risk more reward. Gets rid of the pure clans which IMO being a pure shouldn't allow you to compete with mains, but with prayer you can 
---
Nechs shit gold. Like seriously shit gold. They puke it, sweat it and wipe their ass with it.
---
So much gold that the gains outweigh the cost.
---
It would be nice to have an option in the bank to be able to tag items so that if I were to search my bank with a key word like "farm" the items I've tagged with "farm" will pop up. This will make withdrawing them so much easier than searching for them each individually. This would be a major QOL as my bank is organized but it's still annoying to try to find things for different activities. 
---
Puro bots don‚Äôt do clues, they either loot them for the items, or just sell the implings.
---
Acolyte should come out
---
Grats! What gear did you use for DS2? I have the same range, mage and def as you and am about to do it.

Manacles would be bis for pures, kilt would be bis for pures, cape is just fashionscape, like many TT rewards. 
---
If you‚Äôre 1 in all other skills the wintertodt rewards are shit anyway. It‚Äôs good for early game cash/resources but staying til 99 is a waste imo
---
should get hcim back smh
---
That‚Äôs about average for easy and mediums. Hards will net you 50-150k sometimes without uniques. 
---
That is what happens when the community is involved in the design process. This is what the community wanted you know.
---
Rerolling should only be allowed if you have completed that same clue step before.

Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing my Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can't leave Morytania. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescape's biggest challenges: the Theatre of Blood.

Nothing stops people from seeing pole results then before they vote. People can find out pole results on accounts before they vote (granted, it would require more work such as having another account or asking a friend, or online thread) with that method and so it still doesn't seem super worth.  
---
I'm not sure what huge gain the community is expecting from hidden pole results. I understand that there is a social aspect that can maybe change how people vote based on results, but it is probably not that significant.

Oh, shucks, he doesn't know little jimmy's name boys. Better give up the search. Oh, what's that? There's a multimillion dollar company we can contact that can provide us with useful information like that? Naaaaahhh.

Time to update our weekly drama calander.

So how did these runescape e-thugs get your information to begin with?????

Still working out the clue tiers but do you have any ideas in mind for them - I'll be happy to bring them forward! As for implings, the answer I believe is yes and I'll update the post accordingly. 
---
Upvoting bc VW
---
Not only that this picture is actually a tribute goal to someones dead brother. It‚Äôs actually pretty fucked.
---
who is that lol, just make new account
---
Oh, those are some interesting points I didn't consider.  The fact that the str bonus is equal to dboots is simply dumb, it should be +3 if anything.  The kilt poses the interesting question since it's iron level, so would mains really use it?  And it would add a second item that's almost ranger boots level of value into the game.
---
I think people need to get over their irrational hatred of pures.  In a pvp aspect, 1 def pures risk the least, so items like these would give them more options to equalize their risk outside of bringing a cash stacks.  In a PvE context, I would love for pure items to be added to clues, since it would increase the overall value of clue uniques.  I'm pretty sick of the fact that Master clues and ranger boots are the only two real things in medium clues (and holy sandels/wiz boots to a minor extent).  
---
People scared of pures aren't likely to encounter people wearing these items in their normal PVE lives anyway, so they should really reconsider their stances.
---
As someone who never played or even seen much with Private Servers, it is hard to fully grasp exactly what makes something private servery. But chances are most of the 2013 and even early 2014 will qualify since that was before they had proper dev tools or artists, leading to a lot more copy this npc and recolor kind of stuff. So in that sense, I can get most of these.
---
But I don't think Corp Cave or Wildy Bosses are that bad. The Corp was literally ported from RS2 pretty faithfully and while it did lack the Quest, it isn't that unusual for a boss to be added like that. The Wildy Bosses did a pretty good job at reusing assets in unique and not so obvious ways and while most bosses have some clunkiness to them, I'd still say they are passable.
---
your first mistake was going to a pvp world 
---
DCs aren't cool, but if you enter the wildy with an item that is risk, and lose it, that's entirely on you. If you weren't prepared to potentially lose the AGS you should have not taken it PKing.
---
No nothing
---
Imagine not knowing what a subpoena is.

Like I said nothing wrong with the painting and I personally think Pump is a great artist so I get the whole thing just the fact it‚Äôs a treasure trail chest would have made more sense to me if it was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a sick fuck I like a quick chest‚Äù since some clues take so long. Keep on painting brother and keep doing you.
---
Maybe his mother is a minor?
---
People like Verf have been doing that for an entirely different reason, nobody does multiple clues at a time by dropping them/picking them up
---
And how do you get the money for the gear and stats to do vorkath, zulrah and raids with? (Why even train slayer at all?)
---
Pretty cheap stuff-  black d hide top and bottoms, rune cross bow, antifire shield, nez helm (for prayer bonus), dragon boots, barrows gloves, accumulator, glory, and explorers ring. I used diamond bolts e for vorkath and diamond/ruby e for the final boss. The helm and boots can be changed if you want to kill it faster. Once i learned the mechanics it wasn't really too difficult with these stats. Good luck!
---
Come on man, sharks aren't in the same spot. Would have to be a lobster
---
I would go to the Iron Man sub reddit for this. 
---
But it would depend on your stats. If you have prayer and just flick evlarg / range him from a safespot you will have no issue he isn't tough
---
That Druid set is garbage, need some stats on that pronto
---
Mimic boss sounds cool as fuck, the idea it morphs into a random boss will keep you on your toes
---
I had an idea of it morphing Into a copy of yourself with the gear you‚Äôre wearing but I suppose that would get easy real quick as people would find work arounds
---
I love the stackable clues, but with the 5 hard cap. I think that is an amazing compromise. 
---
Not completely distraught over the loss, but it just sucks I had no control over what happened.
---
Put it into price checker please.
---
It sort of makes sense for the cape to be easy (and f2p), manacles medium (since it's all boot rewards) and the blessed shield and kilt hard
---
I‚Äôm happy with 2 pets in ‚Äò52 kills‚Äô still ;)

---
daggs kalphites and trolls are expeditious bracelet tasks not slaughter
---
You played yourself 
---
Just do whatever you did to acquire wealth in the first place.
---
hard clues are the MOST in need for stacking, they are so common in slayer that they disrupt the peaceful flow of the game if you were to do many/every-one of them
---
Dyeing? Really? That's like not even close. 
---
Yes but why only boots and legs? Range and Mage have almost full sets of BiS in different aspects. They did Range for purrs perfectly with almost each piece locked behind a different tier. Would like to see a BiS for F2P in all attack styles or BiS for other skills locked behind clues. Shackles and kilt are a good start but I saw the rest of the list of straight garbage like the last update
---
This sounds like something that could be useful for a lot of people. even with the accessebility of mobile. Would be interesting to hear jagexs view on offering it
---
They‚Äôre essential/incredibly useful for Ironmen really.
---
Demonic gorillas, zulrah or vorkath. Probably demonic bc your ranged isn't that great.
---
Change the shoulder pads and cuffs to the same color on normal and maybe the same on gold to get a since of silver and gold even though it would be gray
---
Notice how you switched the word that I used, PUBLIC, to a completely different one, PRIVATE.  The information being posted about OP is publicly available information.  The fact that his first/last name is apparently on his Instagram account (according to other comments) means that it is in the public domain.  If I cared enough I could easily get the same information that they have on him if I was given his first/last name from his Instagram.  I wish I could remember the name of this video that has some reporter "doxxing" someone and it takes him like 5 minutes to get basically anything he would ever care to know about the guy from just his first and last name 
---
They are not getting this information from a data breach.
---
&gt; Doxing someone is also illegal. It is a form of harassment and it is only being used to cause harm to someone else.
---
Gonna need a source on that one.  A court ruling, law, literally anything.  OP is based in the US so you are going to want to look through the US related information here.  The only information I have ever seen says that doxxing someone using publicly available information is not illegal.  I always just see people on the internet parroting the same thing you just said and then never back it up.
---
F in the chat boys.
---
What is that real life everyone talking about?
---
Except people do because they want to capitalize on their rng and do the clues instead of doing one and waiting another 200 kills to get another clue. 
---
11.1m
---
His xbox gamertag does not connect or relate to his social media and personal info in any way.
---
Might be because Ironman play style is much different than normie accounts. 
---
Could it be possible to make the blessed d'hide Shield a "upgrade" like a scroll with a blessing for the existing d'hide shields instead?
---
Its a joke :)
---
what is? 
---
&gt;They have to stop at one clue currently.
---
They have to stop because bots cant complete clues. They can farm them, but once they get 1 clue, a real person needs to get on and complete the clue. Now, the hypothetical bot can just keep farming clues and the owner can spend an hour banging out a bunch in a row.
---
I'd say the specialized build argument is pretty valid, or else you'd see a lot more variety in builds, which is not true. If you have anything between 2-41 def then there's already a huge disadvantage, even seeing 13/20 def accounts is pretty rare. On top of that, if you don't quest barrows gloves or have 94 mage for vengeance in higher brackets, you wont be able to compete at all. So it's pretty ridiculous to tell a new player to put hours upon hours getting these items/stats just to be able to have a chance at pking.
---
I agree that OP probably should not have instigated the troll/user, but that doesn't mean the troll is permitted to operate outside the law and dox him (if what OP says is true).  
---
Following your analogy to its logical conclusion, the pissed-off person then either threatened to stab or actually stabbed the other guy.  Unless an exception like self-defense applies, either situation is illegal.  Sure, the guy who was threatened/stabbed is an idiot and should have tried to avoid the situation, but that doesn't give the guy with the knife a free pass to threaten and/or actually attempt to murder someone.

Gotta be careful people don't chargeback their MTX.

How does the team feel about bringing dungeoneering back? The rewards can be changed to something more fitting of OSRS. Possibly as a mini game or in place of warding if it fails. 
---
I always thought Dungeoneering was one of the best things added into RuneScape and have rarely heard anyone negative towards Dungeoneering other than chaotic weapons and people that thought it should have been a mini game.
---
These were good fun, but oversaturating game with items?
---
Gilded is always rune 
---
A copy of your player would be super cool, but I'm unsure it's possible as we don't have dynamic NPC configs :/ As for the druid set, we wanted to keep it useful but not BiS - much like the rest of 3rd age, it's rarity will make it expensive which is generally what they're about.
---
jungle
---
Hope so
---
I don't want to leave ironmen out in the cold. If an ironman takes the risk of completing a deep wildy step at least once I'd be fine with him being able to earn a reroll on that step for the future 
---
i‚Äôll take a shot, why not
---
-**Cape of skulls should be an easy clue reward**, to keep consistency with other capes. 
---
-**The Manacles should be an elite reward** as they will be worth quite a lot and elite rewards need some more love imo
---
- Not sure where to fit the kilt in honestly, I think a hard reward would be fitting though. **Blessed d‚Äôhide shields should also be a hard reward, to fit in with the existing god dhide rewards there.**
---
- 3A druidic would fit nicely as an elite/master only 3A but wouldnt be against adding to hards too. 
---
Glad I got the pet at 400+ kc. Never going back to that boss.

---
Yea, that's exactly what I'm talking about, stuff like that.
---
Apply directly to the forehead
---
Catch Red Chinchompas to get the cash for Slayer supplies like prayer potions or food.
---
Why would anyone in F2P want to wear a cape that skulls them while providing no beneficial stats to them though?
---
Actually runescape stole it then from donkey kong country before god did.
---
No.
---
The caskets would stack. It says the clues would each take a bank space.
---
Nice opinion Chola bro!!!

If you talk smack about dead peoples relatives, how rich you are, act like a dick to females (this is all just a percentage of his behaviour as seen in imgur album above) ur gonna get merked, simple as that, I would do the same. Whether it's moral is your opinion

I killed 300 and got none d boots now is a permanent skip
---
Something with the rollback is causing this I think, not seen outages like this before and been getting ‚Äòerror loading profile‚Äô at times when logging... saw reports of this message on the day of rollback by people who couldn‚Äôt get online.. I‚Äôve never saw this error before in 17 years, or a rollback for that matter.

Unfortunately when it is his Twitter it does. And unfortunately when your Instagram and OSRS name are the same, the same thing will happen.

Sharing your personal info will get you doxxed. Claiming to dox others and sharing your personal info **WILL GET YOU DOXXED**. Come on kiddies. Do you really think big bad hackers used hacker tools to find his info?

Soon
---
/s
---
I mean I agree I'd consider for example cutting magic logs way more afk than Ardy knights but my point was that ardy knights are wayy more bearable than for example Pyramid Plunder(funny story Pyramid Plunder was what made me quit OSRS for a year)
---
You should work in the truth part, you've got the other seemingly down.
---
It's been an hour 
---
Big fan
---
This is the real issue here...
---
&gt;Jagex needs to understand that clues are already practically not worth doing,
---
Maybe if you're sitting their with 90+ stats able to do any boss in the game but for mid and low level players, doing clue scrolls is an incredible source of income.
---
Double cosmics, gargoyles, plant profitable herbs. Zulrah, vorkath?
---
Nah, keep rewards locked at maxing skills
---
Lynx‚Äôs achievement was great but way less interesting. He literally just did the same thing you did to 13mil exp all for hours upon hours more. Settled actually challenged himself and is discovering new things about the game. 
---
the stackable clue one is an important change and hard clues could really use it
---
I dont think its worth starting a new hcim if you jusr want to play ironman afterwards. Because if your high lvl your more carefully, you do less bosses since you more scared of your status. And once you die on hcim high lvl you may get burnt out from hcim
---
If you die on hcim any xp you gained in that session wont be applied to your hcim stats. Stats don‚Äôt update till logout. The game sends a hcim revoke while your logged in but any unlogged xp will not show on hcim stats
---
Reward items look super sick. 
---
VOTE NO TO STACKABLE CLUES
---
vote yes to stackable caskets
---
Nice rc
---
And it's RemindMe! 'duration'
---
3a mage looks better
---
Is dedication what we call it nowadays?
---
Again, I used Robin hood specifically since it's a hard clue, low drop rate, pure specific, no item sink, not used in pvp, and would be worth less.  Assuming it would be worth less than a Robin hood is just poor reasoning all around. 
---
Maxing my ultimate Ironman, creating my own journey. 
---
Easy clue scrolls already give less than 1k in drops as a reward. Are easy clues going to be buffed to gives beginners the current easy tiers drops or are beginners going to be even worse? Why are beginner clues not their own separate question?
---
I'd vote yes to the treasure trail expansion as a whole but not with beginner clues tacked on to it. They just pointless to be honest. 
---
"Not only is it sick boost to my kill death ratio but its also insane money". Sounds exactly like something coming out of Nathans mouth if he played. 
---
Great video 5/5
---
So it does, mechanically still seems to work that way however.
---
Saying this sub doesn't have misogyny is rich lmao it was just within 2 days that a picture of female staff at jagex was called "drama in the making" because they posted something pro diversity on international women's day.
---
I disagree, this pace has no downsides. Updates have still seemed well thought out and where they haven't there has been adequate time for community feedback.
---
&gt;big for autism
---
Buy cheap gear, Do Barrows &amp; herb runs till you can do budget Zulrah. Kill Zulrah x times (can mix it up with demonics too). Buy better gear and get stats for raids. Easy game.

---
okay, that's fair point of view, i definitely see where you're coming from. it's like a SLIGHT buff but yeah i'm sure it will lead to a decent % of more clues completed which would prove your point.
---
i do want 3a to be an expensive item as i love the idea of it, but i also want to just stack clues from slayer and go on a chill clue grind for an hour or two, so i'm conflicted here now.
---
Dude. Fuck.
---
Okie dokie but the literal ONLY thing that can be done in this scenario is op telling his local authorities that any bomb or hostage threats to his residence are swatting attempts. You can‚Äôt just press the report button ingame and expect your local pd to arrest cocainedebt, we both must know that... 
---
Contacting the authorities with the intention of bringing cocainedebt to justice will yield nothing.

It looks absolutely horrendous.

The mimic is hardly good shit. They could've called it something else or made a new concept  just the fact that it's a treasure hunter thing is offputting for be tbh

It actually is. If more rangers enter the game then more pegasian crystals can be used on surplus rangers.
---
I'm envious
---
Have you looked at the data for easy clues? Average loot is much higher than 5k. Closer to 50k.
---
Since we know that Black Graceful is a potential outfit for new and fitting content in the future, can you confirm whether or not Marks of Grace may be needed to obtain the outfit? 
---
Sitting on enough Marks of Grace for one recolor, but too afraid to use it now and find out that I need to farm out another 200+ or more for Black Graceful.
---
All leading up to eventually facing runescape's biggest challenges
---
There were all of pvmers and antipvpers in those pure threads saying the same to a jagex caused issue.  It's a vicious cycle.  Put anytime a pvper says something we get one of these fuck all pvper posts. You are part of the problem. 
---
You don't see the irony here do ya bud?
---
r/whoosh
---
You nub get a locator. 
---
I just camp clue spots in wildy on my accounts now. 
---
As a clue hunter part of me would enjoy being able to stockpile and then spam clues. But I know it would harm the price of the rewards. So I'd rather vote no, at least to the proposed changes. For the sake of compromise I'm willing to come to the table for rewards and potential rerolls. 
---
Pures only fight pures dude. Why do people who don‚Äôt pk try to talk about pking as if they are informed 
---
Noted items and coins currently protecting over valuables in the most recent update too
---
If ranger boots become more common than pegasian crystal, then pegasians crystals will evetually cost more.
---
&gt; You saying I'm taking it personally 
---
You come off as taking it personal.
---
&gt;I wouldn't consider the inferno an easy piece or content.
---
Inferno is completed by maybe 5% pvm'ers? As i said, **not** everybody in the pvm niche.
---
I am speaking about the \~70% of pvm/skillers who bash pvp because they think it is "retarded".
---
What is challangeing about skilling/ the rest of pvm content? My friend has tried raids 1 and 2 5 times and literally never dieds after that. He has barely all combat stats at 95. 
---
My point stays, you are not farming logs/items/stats/bosses, you farm easy dopamine because there is no challange at all, its is only repitition and after a long ass time there is a screen saying "gratz you're 99". Pvp stays challangeing even if you are in the top 0.5% because you can face guys in the 0,5%. You face **humans**. That way it is more challangeing and involves risk.
---
Fucking toxic mate. Chill.
---
Vote no to people telling you what to do.
---
I think you misinterpreted what I said, Jagex know what your email address is and details you use to pay your monthly membership bill (if you do).
---
They would at least be able to put a name to a debit / credit card and location of where they are from (IP address) easily.
---
If he contacted the police, they would force action on Jagex' behalf 
---
All this legal bs and attorneys for literally nothing? You can seek no action against cocainedebt. I don‚Äôt care how hard you try, a transnational subpoena will not work. 
---
Your literal only course of action would be to drive down to your local pd and explain the situation to alleviate any future swatting attempts. Or of course you could always move. 
---
So a retard will go around throwing his money away at attorneys for no reason, and anyone with half a brain will simply address the swatting threat and move on... 
---
It would have to be done manually so ofc jagex isnt going to. Gotta spend all their dev time pushing low effort content updates.
---
This quite a rollercoaster of a title
---
Vote no to stackable clues, vote yes to stackable caskets 
---
Alright, I need a source, even private servers use databases 
---
This is a nice livestream to watch.
---
It‚Äôs possible I just misunderstood the statement initially, I thought he just meant clue scrolls in general weren‚Äôt essential. 
---
You die to something you can‚Äôt control and try again

Stackable caskets I'm fine with. For the dopamine.

When the teacher tells you to restate your thesis in the conclusion

There was no inspiration from Treasure Hunter... Mimics have featured in fantasy media for decades. I think Dungeons &amp; Dragons were the earliest, and Dark Souls is probably the most recent. 
---
No, fuck off with this nonsense. We have scythe and rapier already

What gear do you usually use?
---
If you lend someone money once and they never pay it back it would be stupid to do it again. 
---
Yet people make HC after HC mostly after they die to a DC yet expect this time to be different? Its stupidity

I dont get why its a big deal though. CLue scrolls lose any real integrity when you can just buy them from bots. Stackable clues are already a thing
---
Why do you bring food for wilderness clues? Just 3-item it.

/thread 
---
OP is trying to start drama where there is none 
---
First off, I just want to say thank you for giving a very well thought out response, you're one of the few people on this subreddit who actually explains things well and doesn't just resort to throwing insults... I appreciate that.
---
You make some very good points. I completely understand that getting a clue can put you in an annoying situation where you have to debate regearing or missing out on more clues. However, I'm just not sure it is something that needs to be changed. There should be points in the game where you have that sort of a trade off, where you really need to figure out what you want. Dulling that sharp decision with lower chance of clues takes something away for me.
---
Anyway, it's mostly a personal quarrel at this point. If stackable clues pass and are implemented with the ecumenical key style drop rates and they are punishing enough I will be alright with it given some time. Thank you for taking the time to discuss with me, it's just good to see someone else's point of view.
---
That and repairing the rest of the damage they did in February haha. 
---
I've seen a few predominantly sub-based companies offer a pay as you go option; I don't think it's completely unheard of!
---
&gt; the greedy swine that care more about pixels than doing what‚Äôs right.
---
Lmao you are one entitled cunt. 
---
Ok, retard. Let‚Äôs dance. 
---
So you can‚Äôt open a case up if you don‚Äôt have a target right? Aka the name and information of cocainedebt? You have to then prove it was him on the account and not somebody else. So how exactly are you going to do that without a subpoena? Subpoenas come after other pieces of evidence come up, you don‚Äôt just snap your fingers and magically subpoena someone just as you don‚Äôt just magically open up a case against someone.
---
You need evidence, and you have none. Retard. 
---
u/Mod_West I see that Ranger Tights are features in the bundled reward list at the end, which I guess is added to complete the Ranger's set. What are their stats? Given how strong d'hide legs are for 1 def accounts, would you give ~ +13-17 ranged attack, being BiS until black d'hide like with ranger gloves? Or would they be more of a cosmetic-only?

I'm a pretty elitist OSRS player when it comes to polls (like I vote no to mass majority of updates) but I think stackable clues are one of the better updates. Let's get one thing straight, I don't care about ironmen because updates shouldn't consider them IMO, they chose to limit themselves. With that being said, clues are a waste of time. 
---
They're not efficient in any way, not even mediums, so if you're doing them, it's for the untradeable unlocks, or for fun. It's not fun having to stop doing whatever you're doing and regear your setup for just a single clue. This becomes a problem with higher tier clues where it's less financially feasible to just open implings for more clues in your clue gear, so if people are that worried about prices, just make stackable clues only for Hard+ since there shouldn't be anyone doing those for money anyways. Stackable clues just make the content more engaging, since you could do clue after clue, not having to bank and regear.
---
He's saying they aren't necessary to do. They can sit in your bank forever and you won't miss out on much, it's optional content. Due to that they shouldn't be made easier and more convenient because the point of them is to do it just for fun as the chance at getting something good is so low you can't really expect to get rewarded unless you grind thousands of them out.
---
added to the list, thanks.
---
&gt;But I know it would harm the price of the rewards.
---
How does stacking clues honestly hurt the price of the rewards?
---
I don't see a difference between a clue-doer getting 3 clues at once and doing them vs getting 1 clue-&gt;finishing it-&gt;going back for a 2nd clue-&gt;finishing it-&gt;going back for a 3rd clue-&gt;finishing it
---
ok the fact that all of these buffs are most likely passing and coming at once, that makes perfect sense to vote no to stacking then, ty for the reasoning
---
Send this comment response response to the top!
---
It certainly makes sense from my position! I play near enough never at the moment, with this I'd actually play every now and then. Just then depends if there are enough players in a similar position to justify it.
---
*"If you're feeling brave, dig beneath the dragon's eye"*

Some steps are more time consuming/dangerous. Like a Tiranwin or wildy one.

Grats man!!

Hey I bought some shrimp off this guy the other day. We had some fun chatting, funny guy.

But some brainlets on this sub would REEEEEE about anything nevermind how good it was if it was featured in RS3.

Go for another bond, f2p runecraft ain't fun
---
Lol right 
---
Teleports
---
You checked two out of about 30 threads that were started, + all of the twitter posts/comments from PKing community. Maybe do some actual research before jumping on the bandwagon kiddo. 
---
Im not sure this will ever happen but if youre open to it you can afk certain members skills and create enough cash for a bond within the two week period. You would need to make an initial investment in either gp or irl money for a month or so of playtime though imo just to give you the breathing room to start up
---
Sounds like you get my point.
---
Not backing it up with anything substantive means basically nothing, so basic disagreement is enough to invalidate an unfounded idea.
---
Hacked account ofc
---
You skimmed the blog post, and then you make a whole post about this, without even reading the blog post properly.
---
Your logic amuses me.
---
Perfect cheers mate 
---
yeah but that picture was taken just as people started to arrive to cheer on Lynx Titan
---
Let rerolling every clue be a secondary perk for those that have achieved the respective clue tier's rewards (500 Easy/400 Med/300 Hard/200 Elite/100 Masters).  Only once per clue and it has a rare possibility of a downside.
---
Add the secondary requirement to have done the actual step before so you can't just bruteforce your way to each tier's reward just to skip over a skilling step.
---
No, the course of action is the one I provided. Just because you‚Äôre a quitter doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to quit too
---
I play everybody wants to rule the world every Wednesday on my morning commute now.  It‚Äôs necessary  
---
You should get a stackable empty casket when you open your clue scroll casket that is used for constructing a Poh treasure chest. 
---
25 chests to store easy items
---
50 for medium
---
100 for hard
---
250 for elites
---
500 for masters
---
Just looked into it that‚Äôs such a fail but at least they sorted it now 
---
I read that. Which isn't bad for Beginner-Hard. Master's I feel should be 1 at a time and Elites are up for debate.
---
No, you can't reroll rewards, you can reroll a clue step, so if you're a HCIM you could reroll a wildly clue or reroll a clue that is quest locked that you haven't done
---
Obby shield only if atk+str combined is less than 130
---
"Lol do you even play?" 
---
God forbid the guy doesn't keep up with every single update that happened in the past couple years. I forgot you're not really playing the game unless you do.
---
Meleeing them with elites done is fine if that‚Äôs your thing, I just like how short the task is bursting with good mage gear. 
---
i just want reasonable stack caps
---
5 easy 4 med 3 hard 2 elite 1 master
---
just want to not feel forced to do a clue mid-task, would be nice if i could accumulate multiple from my task and then do them all before getting another task
---
guess it'd speed up easy clue grinds a bit with HAM pickpocketing but it's not a huge deal anyway
---
Vote no to vote no posts.
---
Ill vote however I please thank you

10 hours of that to imbue my helm just seems super not fun

Whether you deserve it is for people to decide for themselves, but your behaviour incited this response.

A 5 clue cap is literally nothing compared to the 25.
---
In my experience at least, the lava maze is one of the most popular spots for pkers in singles, so I go there to try and find other pkers to fight. The kbders and rev killers are just bonus loot or something to do while I wait for world hopper to reset.
---
Aka if you‚Äôre a scrub
---
I will, i promise
---
Maybe if it's behind a gold wall it could work well, say 50-100k? 
---
Yeah most wow streamers I've watched have had it spammed a lot and "omg when is Wednesday"
---
Nah
---
I have made my item informed decision to come no.
---
meh. some of their mtx in recent years goes contrary to the initial design and is a little greedy. the mystery boxes are cancer, transitioning out of 3rd party forum scraping indexing for trade to much needed trade systems being deliberately locked behind premium stash paywalls (2 for 1, you force the people who bought tabs with the old system to have to buy more tabs as premium and force all new players to have to pay to engage with trade which is a core balancing point to the game, and the arguments of having an antiquated forum scraping option dies when you remember the xbox/playstation push), deliberately adding more and more clutter to justify selling more and more premium tabs. they deliberately keep the currency tab not fitting all pieces of currency so they can sell league specific tabs for their new flavour of the 3 month league currency to force you to buy another expensive tab. deliberately adding in stuff like fossils designed to take up a lot of stash space and not being stackable. etc etc. the initial monetization and mtx approach was a breath of fresh air and amazing. it isn't anymore.
---
played since early in closed beta and supported them very generously. their promises of how they were going to monetize the game were dishonest, and their commitment to a hardcore game and vision were quickly forgotten when they were put in a position to appeal to the casual player to boost their playerbase and bottom end. the game has trended heavily towards simplicity and had severe power creep which really kills long term playability for someone experienced looking for a less casual sustained experience.
---
it's still a good game and the best in the ARPG genre, but fuck me if it hasn't overall been a disappointment compared to what it had the potential to be. 2 weeks and i'll be back to this autistic 2007 paint shitshow because i'll have done everything there is to do in the game.
---
Only if the drop rate is exponentially decreased
---
Nice. Maybe I should just go for obsidian armor then? I'm sort of OCD in my armor matching.
---
Like I said, I thought OP was talking about a change that I didn't see in the blog post.
---
No need to gatekeep. He might be a noob or someone who came in from mobile release. Why shame someone for asking a simple question 
---
There's a lot of master clue steps that do not require talking to Sherlock (in fact, most of them). While it is a bummer to get a really high level sherlock clue on your 7th master step after getting a series of relatively easy clues like "talk to thorgel at the death altar/kill a spiritual mage/do 5 hot and cold clue steps", it does defeat the purpose of having those very high step requirements if you can simply reroll it. Like the fella said above, that clue step could be the very reason some people train certain skills.
---
Nope. Even so it will still reduce the reward. 
---
PoE lmfao...
---
Exactly! Imo it's a risk vs reward should I leave my slayer task to do this or grind through it? It sounds so dumb like oh now I can just do the whole task and whatever. It's like any thinking required is being taken out of the game
---
Literally someone at Jagex just go fucking implement this already, what the fuck?
---
okay
---
I don't see why stackable clues are any worse than banking thousands of implings.
---
I'm pretty sure ill be quitting my ironman of almost 800 clues if "multiple" clues are added to the game
---
Sir do you smell toast
---
for some reason i thought swordfish referred to sailfish and not marlin
---
Because Jagex acknowledges that the wildy bosses are designed terribly and safe spots are the only decent way to kill them
---
like i said in the other post, it doesnt, he provided everything himself now hes just pulling the victim card
---
Only thing that brings me back is the 40k slay XP hr. If drops weren't shit and their animation cutscenes werent so goddamn long maybe it'd be enjoyable
---
Just wanted to say you guys handled my ban appeal fairly quickly due to the volume you get.  Got approved this morning and can't wait to get home and continue playing!  Thanks!
---
Almost positive they check those when you do a recovery request
---
My opinion: Ranger boots are overpriced and I'll be glad if they come down a bit
---
"There's a wiki, use it instead of spewing nonsense."
---
Yeah I know it would be just a band aid fix for something that needs reworking, but there really isn't much that can be done to please everyone. 
---
Potato redditor smackdown!
---
Thank you for the epic guide my friend. Sorry about the dc
---
Atm at 82 slayer brutal black dragons earn me the most and then nechs, then wyverns/gargoyles/kurasks. When i finish questing then i‚Äôll do demonic gorillas, vorkath and zulrah. Slayer is a noob skill. I‚Äôm talking bout first account, on a second acc ofc i‚Äôll burst and cannon tasks but that‚Äôs not the point.
---
Why would an increase in clues/hour even matter? Let's assume each clue takes 20 minutes to get. If I stockpile 10 clues, thats around 3.5 hours where 0 clues are getting done. Clues/hour would most likely average out to be the same
---
‚ÄúMy Wednesday locked ultimate Spider-Man‚Äù
---
well if theyre doing what their boss tells them to, they need to find a new boss. the past 2 months has been shitstorm after shitstorm with fuck ups all over and no end in sight.
---
Amazing
---
So I‚Äôm confused, reading the blog post it says that it won‚Äôt be able to stack in the bank or inventory so how does the clue stacking work exactly?
---
actually a really cool design
---
They are looking into changing death mechanics also and im still waiting for that too :D
---
It's not even entirely about efficiency. If I gear up to do a slayer task, get a clue to drop, I can either continue my task, ensuring that I don't get any more clues for the rest of that task, or I have to go through the hassle of gearing up, then teleporting back to a bank to degear, do my clue, gear back up for my task, only to get another clue to repeat the process. Yes, I know that's the tradeoff, but it doesn't feel like a meaningful choice, just an annoyance. I don't think that clues should be stackable to the extent they are in RS3 (you can stack 25 of each rarity at a time), but a max of 5 each with a decrease in drop rate after each one is a good compromise imo. 
---
Obby armor is ridiculously expensive. Maybe get a fighter torso and rune/d bottoms, better for the price.
---
im voting yes just because dropping everything to do one clue sucks  sorry op
---
Is that Adolf Hitler?
---
Shocker
---
More clues = more rolls = more uniques = more supply = lower price.
---
Nobody is forcing you to do a clue the moment you get it
---
I like this idea, but if you‚Äôve already done 500 total clues you should be able to make the chest right away. This is a QoL update for Ironman that has been neglected for far too long. Now Jagex has the audacity to do yet ANOTHER clue scroll expansion without updating the chest... brutal
---
Thanks dawg
---
I'm guessing it won't be worth it considering double agents and guardians don't add loot
---
Is that swampletics?!
---
Cry more nerd
---
Mithril is actually less weight than other metal armours. He is being defensive and efficient.
---
Please don't allow rerolls either. If you can just skip hard steps why not just make monsters drop the rewards casket?
---
I don't mind having clue scroll chest stacking, but if the clues stack themselves it would definitely make farming them so much easier, quicker and lower the price of items. Stackable reward chests = yes, stackable clues = no.
---
Lol they‚Äôre only 1mil? 
---
They used to be like 25m. 
---
Only do if you need keys fow gwd
---
Well I mean I‚Äôve never voted thus far because I‚Äôve felt I didn‚Äôt have a real grasp on the issues because I didn‚Äôt fully understand the game. And I didn‚Äôt want to vote for something that I would come to understand would cause harm.
---
But I mean the point of campaigning is to show why something is good or bad beyond a simple explanation. I‚Äôm fine with it.
---
It doesn't take anywhere near that long for 1.25m points lol. You can **easily** get enough points in 2-3 hours with mid-level melee stats
---
Mediums are still profit without rangers.
---
It's worth it, and the melee gains are nothing to sniff at. There are also methods that allow you to afk for 20 minutes at a time (for lower xp and no pts), so you can pick a method that works for you
---
11$
---
I havent gotten to that stage in the game yet. I've completed a bunch of quests and leveled slayer a bunch. 
---
Master clue's are 6-8 steps meaning 18-24 clue steps. The only way to currently skip a step on a clue is to drop it. Introducing a skip roll isn't a non-issue because it literally changes the way clues are done. 
---
That's not what I'm saying anyway. I'm just saying you don't necessarily need all of the stats for master clues just because you completed three. 
---
Happy cake day, but no.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù nature abyss runecrafting is like 20k per hour. Afk bloods/souls are more, 70k is bloods. With runners at zmi I think you can get like 150k but that costs like 20m per hour or something crazy
---
Whats the point of beginner scrolls? Easy clues already have basically no requirements. Highest possible requirements for easys are 20 attack, defense, and range.
---
Why not both
---
Dragon plate is ridiculously expensive though, but there's also Dragon chain right?
---
TAKES LONGER TO SYNC THAN THE TITANIC

On top of that its way to small...

exactly my though, more than likely an ironman.
---
Change was made for multiple reasons, most notably select people in the community were ddosing. Rather not have the death mechanics back at all, more hassle than it was worth
---

---
Am my bad. What dangerous content can't you TP away from? Obviously if you are in PvP content and it happens you just kind of suffer the consequences 
---
Came here to say this. Making a pure is a conscious decision to limit the content you have access to. The game should not cater to you, just like it shouldn't cater to HCIM or UIM. 
---
Ironmen that‚Äôs what. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some jmods in the background silent crusading for this change because they can‚Äôt be assed to do 1 clue at a time on their Ironman account. This trivializes the fuck out of clues and I can see all expensive drops plummeting because of it. It would mean nothing stops me from spamming impling jars open for a hundred scrolls that I can then steamroll through. 
---

I gave payment dates for the last 6 months, submitted the link in my request showing that the recovery was not me. I don‚Äôt know what else to do

Which is an even better reason for them to host there infrastructure in AWS. Setup correctly you have multiple availability zones and fail over. 
---
pegasian boots arent even necessary l0l, you're acting like it's a must have. anguish is a must have, assembler is a must have, etc.
---
it's like literally the last upgrade possible. d'hide boots are literally good enough. 
---
You can't slow down updates and spend more time on QA, the devs would just have nothing to do while the QA team works over time. You have to realize, that while sometimes bugs get through, 99% of the bugs that happen will never make it to live servers, you just dont hear about those because jagex catches them. That's how programming is though.
---
Can there be a toggle for a desktop like interface added to mobile? The current layout is good for playing on a phone with two thumbs but when you go on an iPad for example which is basically the size of a small laptop, the regular desktop interface would be more useful.

---
This. The fact so many people blindly upvote OP's post when he provides NO reasoning. It sounds good but it's all talk. He also leaves out pertinent info such as a max of 5, reduced drop rates past the first, not to mention "stackable clues" in itself is a misnomer. 
---
Up to date poll blog can be found [here](Read the [updated blog](http://services.runescape.com/m=news/treasure-trails-expansion-poll-blog?oldschool=1), they stack up to a max of 5, with drop rate being reduced for each subsequent clue you hold after the first.)), I suggest anyone wishing to vote on this poll read it and make their own decisions.
---
I'm glad that you don't follow others like a sheep, your comebacks were slick. Have my updoot.
---
Yikes. It was almost reactionary to Oziris dying. That's a real shame and seeing the announcement late was probably insult to injury.
---
stackable clues alongside invention for compnonents has been one of hte best QOL updates in rs3 tbh so much fun doing clues now.
---
more like a quick $350  USD
---
Looks like some noob in Veracs training range on guards?

I don't know what's your problem. We should just be able to mow the lawn 20 times in one afternoon, and don't bother with it for 2 months. /s
---
Seemed like not many people were interested in him until he actually hit the 4.6b total.. Then out of nowhere only 1 post got up to the top. Still a crazy achievement nonetheless.

God forbid you have to choose between dropping everything and doing your clue after your task.

This seems like a good time to tell the story of when I made a pkers day at kbd. I was trying him out for the first time and just completed my second trip and the last kill I got kbd heads.  Like 8 kc or something. Then I realize I don't have a tele and start panicking running around looking for the lever out and I run out of prayer just as I escape. Then I log out and get my f2p alt to bring runes to right outside the gate. I log back into my main and try to get outside of the gate to logout and right when I get out of the gate a pkers shows up and kills me for my +1 slayer helm and I lose the kbd heads. Haven't been back since. 
---
not a great argument...
---
HCIM is no harder than ironman, there is no point. The restrictions are exactly the same, avoiding PvP areas are not required in the game mode. You're the one missing the point.

&gt; I always lives by one golden rule. You don't cross my shitline, I don't cross your shitline.

&gt; But when they polled stackable clues they crossed the goddamn shitline.

Sounds straight off a movie from r/iamverybadass

Nevertheless, my comment was more so directed to the subreddit, every once in a while a post saying hide poll results gets to the top, I'm just saying if the poll results were hidden it wouldn't prevent the herd mentality due to posts like these.

We have found something we can both agree on!

You said that you have to drop everything to do one clue.  
---
This is not the case. Nobody is forcing you to drop everything you're doing to do a clue.
---
Refer to the hypocrisy when they mentioned on a QA that black d hide is essentially broken for giving 0 penalties and being dirt cheap. 
---
Whilst, only a week later they propose crystal armor. A set that has defensive stats comparable to justiciar with literally no penalties and prayer bonus. How do you obtain it? A mini game that requires no items and a quest lock with some lv 70 reqs.

Some of the devs / mods are out of touch tbh.

---
Everyone has given you decent methods, but there's a way better method to full afk nmz.
---
Get the full obsidian kid, do normal rumble with the following bosses: Trapped Soul, Sand Snake, The Kendel, king roland, and count draynor (the 5 weakest bosses possible). Bring 5 super combat potions (or regular if you're broke and don't mind a little less exp/hr), and fill the rest of your inventory with absorbs.
---
When you get in, walk to the very center (one spot north of the spot in the middle of the 2 rocks), take 1000 absorptions, a dose of combat potion, and your guy will last well over the 20 minute mark.
---
I use Chrome Remote Access to access my desktop from my phone. This allows me to maintain this on my phone without needing to have the app running, which is required with the mobile app.
---
So basically once every 20 minutes or so I unlock my phone, take a dose of super combat, then afk for 20 more minutes.
---
I got 70k exp/hr for most of it, but get close to 80-85k now that I'm 99 str.
---
You don't get quite as good exp as flicking prayer or taking an overload once every 5 minutes, but it is incredibly afk, and is objectively better from every angle besides entry cost compared to something like sandcrabs.
---
This method completely trivializes maxing melees.
---
Do you have another app forcing the orientation of apps?.
---
Just another day on the casting couch with the boys 
---
I almost started maniacal monkeys in my nice shiny new elite void... phew
---
Tbh the suggested changes all exist within rs3 and work perfectly fine. The rare items have still held value.
---
Just as I was about to post this I began to think that invention may play a huge part in that, as it creates an item sink. The lack of item sink would be the issue here rather than the (good) suggested changes.
---
We need some benefit for combining 50 clue scroll rewards (losing the 50 pieces in the process) or something along those lines. 
---
Can the item storages in POH be reworked to act like a bank? They could use a similar layout to the collection log interface so you can stack multiple clue items of the same type without needing a full set. This update is just going to require further bank space that is already so limited.
---
Is it just me or does this look like it's a shower toy?

How about voting whatever you personally want to vote for.

Ohh ok. Thanks for explaining, I didn't get that before. Totally on board with them then.

Just watched the Q&amp;A, and I was very happy to see some of the aspects from my suggestion into your current final renderings! They look great, and I understand why you went with the "common -&gt; Legendary" color scheme. I was thinking the same, but thought perhaps it could been translated into "bronze -&gt; rune" color scheme (but you did do it with dragon). However, due to the colors being already in a way hard to distinguish (mithril, adamant and rune have very close hues), the traditional way is a solid solution.

Thank you again, I am very happy to see the new changes :)

No it‚Äôs still Ranarrs or snapdragons all around. Especially if you‚Äôre using the resurrect crop spell.

I can't force you to vote a certain way. I can only make my case for voting a certain way.

Lol ‚Äústop believing in things I don‚Äôt believe in!!‚Äù Carry on, child.
---
Just because its easy doesnt automatically mean the'll flood the game. Look at the price of the easy clue team capes, they have no practical use and are perfectly fine, more expensive than the obby cape.
---
why you giving yourself blueballs idoit
---
I feel the "dc-problem" is blown out of proportion because of Reddit.

Besides, connection related deaths are a part of all HC-modes, no matter the game. If that isn't your cup of tea, I didn't blame you, but it definitely is mine and many others'.

This please.

this might be the most useful jagex support comment ive seen
---
Having a gp cost associated with recovering your stuff is a better solution. I don't want to go back to the days of only bringing 4 expensive things to GWD etc. because there's no way to get back fast enough.

OOPSIE WOOPSIE!! Uwu We made a fucky wucky!! A wittle fucko boingo! The code monkeys at our headquarters are working VEWY HAWD to fix this!

Started the discussion? It's literally titled "Vote no to stackable clues"... and ends with "VOTE NO TO STACKABLE CLUES".
---
That doesn't sound very insightful to me. Not does he bring up any counter points. If you see his replies you'll also see he didn't even read the updated blog properly before making this post. 
---
Wow people don't care about people online unless they do something impressive.
---
So sad.

Where are mole slippers wtf
---
The locks also create another goal thats usually not too hard to achieve. Its good gameplay wise to have many goalposts a player should aim for from beginning to end. Keeps people invested in the game.

Does he respawn after you kill him or do you need another totem

The treasure trails expansion blog mentions "better rewards" for fighting the Mimic Boss. Can you expand on what those better rewards would be that would make it worth unlocking the chance for the mimic to show up?

Thanks for taking the time to reply, it doesn‚Äôt make sense why everyone is blindly agreeing. If anything the one thing he wanted, the re roll, could help bypass some requirements making everything easier as well as faster. 
---
We should collectively thing about the change and then decide, not pick sides. 
---
No, because ranarrs on the disease patches have a chance to die, making you lose 30k, which, over time, makes you average out to less than if you used a cheaper seed that still has decently priced herbs on those patches.
---
Move it back so we can lure again

Are you doing this for points or exp?

If you're all good on points, there's a much better method if you want to afk

This isnt actually the first time I've seen that guy beeing posted to reddit for something similar. Eighter its a setup for karma or he's legit mental. 
---
Haha who cares? You're allowed to not like anything you want.
---
What exactly is the point of this post
---
something like that. clues/hr is really player skill based
---
Am i the only one that thinks their props like the claws and dfull look bad?
---
Only if you make it unhealthy. It's perfectly healthy to spend a couple hours a day running runes for RC, for example, but you can make it unhealthy by rushing it and doing it for 16 hours a day.
---
You literally just explained why they're doing it right.
---
A professional dev cycle is taught as follows:
---

Did you stop for a minute to think why there was a qol month between the other content releases?

Also none of those drama issues are really that big of a deal. They would have happened anyways, you can fucking forsee everything hence the maintenance stage after an update. Or you're just a fucking drama queen who flips the table every time something doesn't go their way.

Small update, mod ash sent me a link that I was able to use to cancel the membership that was linked to the card.

Still no word from the support department but at least that‚Äôs one thing

Seriously to be at 101 with all this just sounds silly. 75/90 option is ideal. I'll see if there are any other suggestions that I think fit better, but right now I'm excited at the possibilities with what you've told me. Thanks a ton.
---
You went and deleted comments my man.
---
That's a big F in chat right there if I've ever seen one.
---
Will do
---
Well yea, I mean the proposed change
---
Only if it can move to the beat of the OSRS song we are listening to.
---
Since we want to have random convenience/profit trade offs, let's remove noting produce at tool leprechauns. It will be a nice trade off: you either go to bank after harvesting every patch or you drop your produce. But noone forces you to do that, and shame on you if you if you want to have both your harvest AND farm run without banking.

For me, when they added a bloodhound pet to Masters. I know I want to get it eventually, and I know that the total amount of clues you can get from other bossing is quite limited compared to how rare the pet is. So as a result I feel forced to do every single one I get, which is pretty annoying. Being able to stack them up and do a bunch of them at once when I feel like it would be a load of my mind tbh.
---
I mean I barely have any knowledge of rs, I enjoy the series even though I hardly play it myself
---
Where is your evidence this will destroy reward prices?
---
I hate having to drop a clue I can't complete right away, adding stackable clues would change that, not the rate at which I would complete them.
---
It would also nice not to have to leave godwars dungeon everytime I get a clue because I have to complete it first to get another one and this update would provide that.
---
I would hate to not have this quality of life update just because your scared for your profit, I like clues because of the experience and have only once recieved something worth while after 400 clues hard completed, this update would also allow me to farm multiple clues and save them up, allowing me to do a clue evening without having to camp godwars or slayer after each clue I've completed.
---
I just think you should give a better argument for me to vote no. Your profit doesn't concern me, and if clues are one of the most enjoyable content you shouldn't either.
---
Gotta feed those hamsters. 
---
Being an absolute unit
---
Isn‚Äôt it ‚Äúnoughties‚Äù?
---
They said in the poll only 1 clue of each difficulty can be active at a time, so you can't just check 5 hard clues and go to the nearest one, so this won't be a factor.
---
I agree with you, but here‚Äôs the simple argument: 
---
For a lot of low-mid levels, Runescape definitely lacks exciting content. No real bossing or raiding etc. Clue scrolls can be one of the few opportunities for lower levels to actually obtain valuable rewards.
---
With an increasing player base and for the longevity of the game Jagex definitely needs to address this, as you can‚Äôt be expecting your average player to spend 500+ hours to be able to start doing bosses. You‚Äôre going to see a lot of people quit prior to reaching the exciting part of the game.
---
I‚Äôve recently started playing world of Warcraft after 13 years of runescape and this was one of the nicest feature I found in wow; is you can almost immediately start doing fun exciting content where rewards are satisfying.
---
The new slayer master was a good bump for this issue, but I do see the merit in making clue scrolls more convenient to complete. 
---
xp =/= points.
---
I see you're also waitung for the 49GB update
---
With your stats, fight caves should be more than manageable. I'd dump some of the money (temporarily) into a blowpipe and some good range gear and get that fire cape. It's a great upgrade for melee gear and feelsgood account milestone. 
---
its not an efficiency question because ignoring all clues will still be the most efficient option. stackable clues is great for the casual or semi-casual players who enjoy doing clues while having almost zero impact on efficient gameplay (unless you're a pet hunter i guess)
---
with a hard cap of 5 and the scaling rarity it really seems like a decent compromise.
---
..lazy shits, who still have to complete the clues, just later? don't really follow this line.
---
They don't. If you have somewhere else you can keep a tally, then repair them after the 9th fill.
---
yet im smarter than u/smorc_farter73
---
I got 10k tickets there with karamja elites, took like 150 hours. I liked it because I didn't have to be constantly clicking and it was so easy to watch movies and series, especially with mobile
---
I've had so many different builds, some that were tanky melee, some that were caster typed, a few rangers. I've used daggers and hammers and wands, had really mobile builds with leaps and dashes and teleports, and slower stuff too. The only thing I've yet to try is summoning type builds because it's not my play style. My most recent was flicker strike and that was both dizzying and fun as fuck. 
---
If you just build the safest fastest clear speed most efficient build, then yea you'll most likely always have something about the same. I play the game for fun and although I do want to complete difficult content and have reasonable clear speeds for efficiency, I also think about the fun-factor of the build. When I'm looking for a new build, I usually watch streams or look up youtube videos and ask myself, does this look fun to play? If it does, I'll hit up a forum post or guide to see if it's going to require some unobtainably rare unique, and if it doesn't then I try it out!
---
This game has so many possibilities for playstyles, and they change every  league because new uniques are available, new league mechanics are introduced, old league-specific uniques are rotated out, etc.....  I'm never bored. 
---
&gt; Mediums only profit if you don't go dry on rangers (I believe)
---
Yeah and bandos only profits if you don't go dry for drops?? Mediums are like 3m/hr on average or something insane like that.

True. Bandos reigns supreme. 
---
4 straight updates have had major issues. you think that is 'doing it right'?
---
i dont care about a professional dev cycle, that isnt relevant. i dont care how they produce what they produce. the issue is what they are producing and how much of it.
---
the issue is the quantity of large scale updates happening which are not being properly handled from both the perspective of development and community input.
---
I agree, for me it's one or the other, multiple clues or a step reroll, both just seems too drastic of a change
---
Because it's fun opening a shit load at once.
---
I think the frogs in the Lumbridge swamp have low defence and decent hp, so that would be a good source. I did 1-60 there a few years ago. 
---
what are d&amp;d?
---
interesting. I felt like I had to be constantly moving around and paying attention to get anywhere but like I said I've only done it once.
---
Go tweet jagex
---
They said you'll only be able to complete 1 clue of each difficulty at a time, so you can't just have 5 hard clues going at the same time. 
---
Are there any plans to revisit old quests in the game and change their XP rewards? For example The Legends quest involves Farming but this existed before the Farming skill was introduced. Similarly, Chompy Bird Hunting existed before the Hunter skill. 
---
If not, is there a possibility to add Hunter XP when plucking Chompy birds?
---
Also, the whole "just make a hc iroman and don't care about whether you die it won't make a difference" doesn't always work in practice. Once people hit like 700 total level and still haven't died then not dying becomes an active priority for them and they skip out on content they would do with a regular ironman due to risk.
---
That's why I don't see myself personally ever starting a HCIM account.
---
My urge to play runescape only pops up at important times, like when I'm supposed to be studying for a test lol
---
&gt;  i rather it be more convenient  
---
You know what would be even more convenient? If the monsters just dropped the clue casket themselves. Why bother even hunting for clues? Just streamline the whole thing for sake of convenience.
---
Holy shit. Never had members before. Played rs when I was around 10/12 back in the day. just got members and just entered Zanaris and I am ecstatic. wow. I feel like a little 12 year old adventure again exploring new worlds. Just needed to share this excitement. Feel free to give me tips for a total new members player though!!
---
uhh stackable clues are a big deal
---
if you wanted to get as many clues out the way as possible, you'd have to complete them as soon as you found them. They take no time to do but they are neglected because it's inconvenient to stop what you're doing to do them.
---
If they stacked, you could just have "sessions" where you complete them all in one go much more easily.
---
Your recent updates including this are slowly ruining the game
---
I go there from nyc üòÇ 30-45 mins shorter than Atlantic City
---
It will greatly increase the number of clues in the game. I'd say 10% of players actively do clues.  Right now there is a cost to stop what your doing and do the clue, for the potential of a reward. (that's the point). If clues are stackable it will only be profitable to do 10+ clues when you have a complete inventory setup and can rush them.  Right now if you want to farm clues, there is a cost to 'buy' each clue. Resulting in the effective reward between 2-3m/h when you have to buy medium clues. If you can get the clues for free and do 10+ in a row, you're looking at massive profits, which of course is only temporary until the price of clue rewards crash. Ranger items, god pages etc will all likely be halved.  Implings will be dead content (which is probably the secret goal of all this to get rid of bots) as clues will be worth drastically less.  
---
Once again the whole point of clues are to distract you from your current task, for the potential of a great reward, and also to incentives you to train certain skills or complete certain quests.  Since you will be able to skip clues you can't complete there goes that, and since you can stack them, there goes the distraction, and at the same time making them farmable. 
---
In the end new players will have 0 incentive to complete clues, as it will only be mediocre money when they have nearly all the requriments and fast teleports to do their whole bank of clues at a time.
---
It is with sound 
---
Farm Guild Ideas
---
Can White Lily seeds also be obtained via Hard Contracts?
---
Can Anima seeds be obtained by Hard Contracts?
---
Can we make Hespori fight-able via Farming, using plant cures, anti poison, secateurs, same rewards just able to fight it slower without combat xp for the skillers out there?
---
It seems odd that Farming a purely non PVM skill is now requiring PVM to obtain some items.
---
I like this, it makes far more sense for Runescape to follow this than to randomly pick up the WGBPO color rarity scheme that literally every other video game has picked up.
---
I'd like small stacks. Maybe like 3 clue limit. I want to be able to do a task and then have a clue session. 
---
Caskets are too much rng. Just have them drop rangers or all third age items based on clue drop type.
---
This is why people block hell hounds until they get to Cerberus. If you don‚Äôt want to take the time to make the money from the task just do a better task.
---

Because you can *lazily* carry on with your slayer task without worrying about wasted clue drops cos there‚Äôs already one in your bank.
---
Get off your ass, bank yur armour and go do the clue!
---
I did it so that every time I tagged a pillar, I would run back to the middle, or close to the middle. That way I would never be late from the next one.

---

---
How is it lazy you still do the exact same thing, you just get to decide to do it a later time because at the moment you're zooned out killing Vorkath and watching a movie and would rather not change pace entirely
---
Bit much tbh maybe once 2k totals and only the 1 extra every 500 bit much
---
I don't understand why casual or semi-casual players wouldn't just say "oh cool a clue scroll" and either do it then or wait to do it... lol what's so bad about that?
---
just like real life
---
Rs3 bad!
---
He realized he was retarded, and decided to double down instead
---
Gotta love when they make a gamemode meant to be difficult easier.
---
Runescape has alot of connection problems and people dying dye to DC's though.
---
So, your only point is it will devalue rewards. What you don't realize is that rewards like ranger boots will become cheaper proportional to the decrease of time you need to get them. So as a clue scroll solver you don't gain or lose any profit because with decreased rewards price and increased clues/hour you will have the same profit/hour. The only difference is convenience.
---
Nothing lol a level 3 showed me a seed pod and 60m so I declined and they started saying their bs
---
Okay that part I didn't know. I think I understand why it wouldn't be a great idea to make em stackable.

---
Are you OK with short trips? Then easier. There aren't really any mechanics that can one shot you, so if you play it safe and just camp one prayer then it's all pretty straight forward.  
---
Are you looking to get long trips? Then much, much harder. Really efficient solo GWD involves a lot of precise movement and/or prayer flicking, which if you found Vorkath to be a pain in the ass for having to move from his fireball + acid special attacks then efficient GWD would probably be impossible for you without a shitton of practice.
---
Reqs for clues immediately become priority #1. It‚Äôs 90% of the reason I do some quests and raise certain skills. 
---
Yeah I know QA ands devs are different groups, I just think we have as many devs as we need based on the content we've gotten. Plus its not like devs can't do QA on the side I think some of them actually were originally on QA.
---
You really think pures would risk these 500k-1m + boots? 
---
They usually +1 a gmaul. This would benefit pures that fo raids and pvm.

You don't have to imagine, go look at Path of Exile. Log out macro's are a thing in HC because of the way they chose to balance it. It's not the most popular thing and it gets softcore players complaining about hc = logoutlul, but they do have a log out system so for those interested in the effects of logging out can peruse the PoE community.
---
I don't think instant logging will ever work in OSRS, but doesn't stop me from wondering what it would be like.
---
Yeah that's not lazy it's called not wanting to completely disrupt what you're doing

I'm just gonna vote for whatever has the majority of votes. I don't even read the questions because polls are shown and people already read it for me.
---
You ok bro
---
wow spoilers
---
It's not and it shouldn't have been added to the game.
---
They stated in the original blog that you would only be able to complete 1 clue of a given tier at a time. You can't just be part way through 5 different hard clues. You would not be able to begin another clue until you have finished or dropped the previous clue. It makes 0 difference when doing things like eclectic implings because if doing meds that way you likely have a bank tab that has all clue items you need. You open jars until 1 clue, deposit inv and grab all clue items, do it. It's not like you are going to have 2-3 clues that have steps right next to each other that will cut off minutes of getting to that location again. You will still more than likely have to run to said location again
---
This had happened to me a few months ago I lost my bank of 300m and had zero motivation to keep playing. My advice to you is think of it like a fresh start, do some afk money makers or explore some alt skilling methods to make money until you can do some slayer with decent gear, and slowly rebuild. As of last week I just got back to my 300m bank. And now I‚Äôm more motivated than ever.
---
This. It feels like there is no magic progression in terms of combat past the 59 level. Magic can only out-DPS ranged and melee against armored opponents, and even then it's too slow for successful combos. I wouldn't mind seeing waves on F2P or some item that makes the spell up to blast 1 tick faster on successful hit (to prevent from faster splashing).
---
There's a chunk of people in this game that will hate you for not being them. I've been splashing on a pure with mobile while at work, check it every 10-15 minutes. I check it earlier and see two people standing there with cats. I've ran in to purple killing the rats to stop bots. I'd ask them to please not, and they'd laugh a and move on after a small chat. These guys berated me for being a pure and repeatedly said "hope you ruin your account retard." like ok, like I can't just make it into a different build if that happens lol. But the fact that they were greifing just because I was a pure is sad. 
---
not a fair comparison to compare crystal armor to justiciar because most people that actively use justiciar use it for the set bonus. it also has rare use cases (rune dragons are really the only example i can think of)
---
Public discussion of proposed changes = telling us all to vote no? 
---
Yeah pretty much never
---
c
---
Dude all you have to do is say something and odds are you will get a response. I talk to people when I'm farming all the time. I chat when I'm gearing at a bank. I chat when I'm doing a bank standing skill.
---
You are completely wrong. Have you ever just walked by someone in game and say something lol? Feels like people don't even attempt to type in chat.
---
Also you aren't going to have a conversation with someone 3ticking obviously unless they want to. (I'll chat with people if I'm 3ticking most of the time) But afking at teaks/barb fishing there can be plenty of talking. 
---
Clues are perfect the way they are imo. Clues are one of the parts of the game that don't actually feel like a grind, and its refreshing. I would prefer if they kept clues the way they were, and implemented something else alongside clues that could compliment them. I don't really have any ideas, but that refreshing feeling of getting a clue and breaking away from the repetition of whatever it is you were doing is one of my favorite things currently. I really hope the changes don't pass.
---
We must test this

Maybe revamp the treasure chest in the costume room for poh? Also I really like that UI
---
I have not played rs3 free to play, but I know that there are a handful of good f2p moneymakers with the new mining and smithing rework. Also, once you get members, there are a lot of daily moneymakers you can do that will pretty easily cover the cost of a bond.
---
Same game. 
---
Yeah most pures don‚Äôt pk deep
---
What?
---
I doubt 1% of 1% of the people who play this game actively tick manipulate.
---
Same game
---
I think it should be possible to hold multiple clues, but not in the same slot, or possibly store more than one clue in the bank for each type, but only be able to hold one of each type
---
At least op has his sis for that
---
So part of this question should be "are you ironman or trade?". Saradomin brews aren't really that easy of an unlock for ironmen hence the urgency to do wintertodt at 10hp.
---
On a trade account saradomin brews are cheaper then the fucking birds nests it takes to make them and I bought 100 yesterday for like 2.7k each. That's basically monkfish prices but I get 4 monkfish per inventory space.
---
So for trade accounts your HP is a non issue.

I admitted in my edit that the title was forceful. I fired this post off in 15 seconds on my way to class. All I've done is present arguments. I'm not forcing anything. People are free to comment and call me a retard. Believe me they have.

This is some reverse Chris Traeger shit. Everything is *literally* the worst.
---
How are you even gonna pretend to think that tick manipulation is worse than EoC.
---
But stackable clues didn't crash the prices in rs3. In fact, standard clue items are worth more in rs3 than osrs because of invention. Also, the most expensive clue rewards are consumable in the form of dyes, so their value is conserved. 
---
So stackable clues didn't have any negative effects on rs3's clue rewards, then what was his point? 
---
I don't either
---
&gt;vote no to stackable clues. 
---
&gt;I believe I'm right
---
&gt;can't force you to vote, but...
---
&gt;#VOTE NO TO STACKABLE CLUES

Sand crabs are a good option. If you‚Äôre gonna be doing slayer make sure to use a black mask/slayer helm.

And always use super combat potions to speed up the process

Is this where all the pkers come in to vote yes to stackable clues?
---
Quests
---
From +2 to +4 that is only a max hit 50 percent of the time. Its not like pures pk much anymore, its all clanman mode.
---
No pure in their right mind would risk these in the wild for how expensive they will be. 
---
Personally i want to use them on my pure for raids and slayer.
---
‚ÄúWell then‚Äù
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôll just have to post this to reddit‚Äù
---
Same. It would be very reminiscent of the old days when most random events were aggressive, and you‚Äôd occasionally get a good show when somebody is afk and they almost die to an evil chicken or river troll. I‚Äôd love to see the panic that comes from somebody thinking their clue is over and getting bounced by a sudden boss fight. 
---
This is not QoL, it's straight up laziness. 
---
Still not seeing where I've manipulated anyone. 
---
"with how lacking the range attack style is in osrs"... I don't think you're playing the right game mate, everyone fucking ranges bosses with either a cbow, tbow or blowpipe
---
thank you
---
= lazy
---
ok cheers man
---
Thats why they would create a limit. And I think nothing should be allowed more than 5 of any tier but maybe make Elite only 3. Master Clues shouldn't be stackables beyond the first seeing as they are not a direct monster drop. Furthermore, they proposed making the chance of another clue decrease the same way ecumenical keys do, which is what I think stackable clues should be like. They should have a trade off in a way but outright saying "No fuck you, you get one clue this 150 dks task and thats final." is pretty dumb. Whats the point of monsters having high drop rates when they're such an annoyance to interrupt to do a clue which you'll get on average like 130k from (elite clues, no uniques) and then have to regear, make the trek back to dks etc. I think 3 Elite clues with decreasing rates would be fine and that people are panicking unnecessarily about how having a few extra clues that you could *potentially* do would crash the prices of uniques.
---
What will you vote and why?
---
420 bro(?)
---
Lacking? Ranged? Are we playing the same game? Lmao
---
These last two comments were beautiful, thanks so much for your numbers. I was just doing some rough calculations in the tub but these are amazing. Where did you get the death rates for herbs? I remember when I was planning out 99 farming, looking everywhere for the rates and all I found was a YouTube video being like it‚Äôs about 1/8 with ultra compost. 
---
Voting yes to spite you and your bad argument.
---
Meme? My boy woox out there being a god isnt a meme sir
---
Not that pointless, when it makes the clues rewards valueable. You DON'T have to do the clues to progress in the game, nobody is forcing you.
---
&gt;No one is forcing you to leave the task.
---
You're the tenth person to use this argument. You're right. Nobody is forcing you to leave the task, you can just loot bones from hellhounds for the next hour and a half. Sounds exciting. 
---
On the contrary, nobody is forcing me to vote "no", so I'll be voting yes on all accounts. 
---
It's funny that the person who decries somebody as "entitled to ezscape" is the same person who feels entitled have me to vote against my own interests.  
---
So for the .1% of the RS population that are clue-fanboys: **I really don't give a shit. The update is good for me, and I'll be voting "yes" on it.**
---
Motherfucker what? So you're saying jamflex is considering making it a safe death? OH HELL NO, those HC's dying is a privilege, NAY A RIGHT in the Wintertodt. 
---
They better fucking poll that shit because the Toad will stay lethal as long as I'm around to vote.
---
Baby ass HCIM who can't manage to eat a slice of cake, smh. And you, /u/vanexii, you should be ashamed for even thinking about wanting it to be a safe death. Fucking pansy. I bet you bitch about the Wildy and think clue pkers should be banned as well.
---
I don't think this is true unless it was stated on stream - it's not in the dev blog. 
---
This made me think of Helga's closet shrine in Hey Arnold
---
Get your western provinces hard diary done and hunt red chins 
---
Dude yes!!!! Easily one of the best tracks. My favorite for sure 
---
I find it amazing that I agree with all of your posts.
---
If you did the math you'd see that for every few thousand of extra clues completed, there would be very few actual new uniques brought into the game. 
---
My only desire for re-rolls is the hard steps that require hard clue rewards that make clues insta fails for ironmen.
---
Number of clues completed does not equal number of clues dropped by monsters. 
---
I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve never solo‚Äôd, by Olm has become so mechanical for me now, the fights like the back of my hand, I never die.
---
Then every now and then I fuck up literally everything and get absolutely mullered

The last thing the green drag miller  sees

I guess he never really explained how he was going to approach it

---
Venatis would actually be arachnid abuse, as would scoripia. crazy archaeologist? elder abuse. chaos fanatic? religious hatecrime.
---
&gt;  If someone runs at you and screams they are going to kill you but doesn't actually put their hands on you, it's assault. 
---
A threat of physical violence is also counts as assault. But A Friend never made such a threat anytime and he has the stream to prove it. I'm not sure what's the legal definition for assault is in Netherlands though. 
---
&gt; But more important is that his ex lied to the police he attacked her, not that she feared of being attacked by him.
---
This point still holds however. Why would his ex not get into legal trouble for this? A Friend should press criminal charges against her instead of the other way around and he actually has evidence to back it up.
---
Fill in the form to find out!
---
Yes.  So you agree that it would be significant. 
---
If he never got the kill what's the problem?
---
That's awesome thank you 
---
Uh, he's describing an incel, a well known stereotype. Struck a nerve much?
---
FML
---
If the rarity of obtaining each clue decreases as Jagex has proposed, I don't see how it will affect rates of clues since it will take longer to get the 2nd and even longer for the 3rd, 4th and 5th. Mediums are effectively stackable right now with eclectic implings anyway. 
---
Please don't use the old Wiki :(
---
I guess, people already do that with mediums using impling jars though, and with masters since you can stack 3 of them. Doing them one at a time carries no charm to me but then again I never liked doing clues either, I just want this for masters/elites really so I can knock out bloodhound in one go.
---
$11
---
That baby is watching.
---
Yes, scamming is only bad if you fall for it right? So it literally doesnt affect me or my gameplay because I'm not an idiot who gets scammed. Stuff like this DOES affect my gameplay which is why I'm saying its scummy. What's wrong with thinking that?  
---
There needs to be a balance, as with all things. Pures dont deserve to be voted against while mains keep getting more and more max hits
---
We pay we gay 
---
Imagine if every game studio had a God Ash on their team.
---
Considering mobile users can't do it as easy as well as a good percentage of people using pc's have wrist problems as is, tick manipulation as the best xp by a far margin comparing it to normal skilling it is a bad precedent to set. This is why minnow fishing, redwoods, mlm, herbiboar and much more methods that scale to higher levels without needing to stick to a mid level skill that requires tick manipulation to achieve decent xp rates.  Sure some people do tick manipulate mid level stuff to get best EHP but that is purely by their own doing and shouldn't be forced onto players just to get that 99.
---
I mean, in terms of time spent stockpiling food, trout cost way less than lobsters.

Literally nothing I'm just frustrated seeing others losing their accounts due to no customer service and I don't wanna fuck with that.

In RS3 he has full lore. He‚Äôs a spiritual beast who was tearing the fabric of the reality apart to tunnel between universes. This was a part of his search for more souls to consume. 
---
During Summer‚Äôs End you lure the spirit beast into a cave and use negative energy to defeat it, which locks it back to its corporeal form (hence the name). It is trapped in the cave because of the energy from the gravestones and other objects in the rooms preceding its entrance that Jagex just Cntl-alt-deleted.
---
If what you have to say is important enough you can wait 30 seconds to tp to the next herb patch. Don't participate in efficiency scape then get mad when that means you don't have time to talk. Mad xp gains don't earn themselves, you want EHP you gotta understand that means giving up random conversations with strangers.
---
You scrolled past the real offense clearly
---
Very well said
---
I love how you refer to quitter 3 times and centralize around it in every insult. Buddy it‚Äôs ok you don‚Äôt need to project that hard against me, I get it you quit some things sometimes. 
---
This has nothing to do with ones resolve to finish something, and everything to do with the anonymous nature of this crime taking place in a video game based in a country across the ocean. You can‚Äôt just bark at your attorneys to bring you justice to everything sweet child. 
---
skirts
---
I might ***might*** support stacking clues if I knew people were doing them ‚Äúlegitimately‚Äù- solving the riddles themselves and figuring out the puzzles, hell, at least consulting the wiki for the answers and doing the puzzleboxes themselves. But the fact that runelite will literally spoonfeed people the exact next moves to make in a puzzle box or instantly tell you where to go the moment you look at your current clue makes this suggestion redicilous imo. It‚Äôs not longer really about clues and puzzles, it‚Äôs just an exercise in how quickly you can teleport to 6 or so places, sometimes with a funny hat on. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to do that rapid fire 30 times in a row.
---
You can note your produce at the tool leprechauns? This is going to change my farming game something fierce.
---
And you're still not providing any real arguments on why easy or medium even need to be stackable in the first place.  Yes, we're both assuming rates because neither of us have statistics available, but yours is an extremely minor QoL that is almost negligible, that will 100% increase the rate of clues and by extension clue completion.
---
You aint no ironman so no1 gives a fuck, either pay private or do more damage than him... Its unlucky but.. If you were ironman &gt; instant ban LOL.
---
In RS3 sure. In OSRS he has zero motivation.
---
Wiggle away 
---
Sometimes you roll shit steps, sometimes you don't it's 50/50
---
Probably I've got 200m sitting on my account 
---
Lol, getting 5 clues in a task. Stackable clues don't mean you get to do all 5 at the same time. 
---
skrrts
---
They also released an outfit that collectors wanted that required you to do dozens of clues. Obviously when a new update comes out people are going to play it. 
---
Reward prices are low right now because most players have already gotten the fortunate components to make the items they need.
---
Or drop trade for free
---
So, you're going to form an ACTUAL myreque chapter to take on the theatre of blood?

...Myreque prevail!

I made a basic script to follow and log Swampletics highscores and output them to a table for a brief overview.
---
It's a bit like crystalmathlabs but all in one place and only tracks XP changes. I'm treating it as an introductory project to learn PHP and MySQL and I'dlike to keep the ball rolling, so if theres any changes anyone would like to see please let me know
---
Here's a screenshot (hosted on my website): https://i.imgur.com/d6pLWtg.jpg
---
Are you dense? If I get a clue on my first kc and stay there for the rest of the task then I miss out on every clue I would have gotten from the rest of the task.
---
I don't even understand why you would say that because I know you know this. You just want to argue against me for the sake of it, I guess?
---
If you're doing the ironman method as a main you deserve to be crashed
---
RIP your free time
---
I would have highly considered jumping in and catching it barehanded. Was that in Florida?
---
Ironmen can't but from overstocked shops. 
---
Yes I know. But the price change still isn't noticable at all
---
You don't really need to do any of that autistic 8 hours a day 7 days a week repetitive tick manipulation shit unless you're going for max stats and beyond which... is literally not required for any real content in the game.
---
Agreed. I love just taking an hour or two to do a few clues at a time. 
---
this guy fucks
---
I‚Äôll be voting no. Because +4 Strength with no requirements in an armour slot shouldn‚Äôt happen.
---
You sound like the pos probably crashing him. Gtfo
---
That rollback though
---
This but unironically.
---
Sounds awesome i wish i had friends.
---
Maybe in a different subreddit... you know how Reddit works don't you?..
---
It would be nice for times when you get back to back clue drops in one slayer task or something
---
I don't think we as a community of gamers could handle it. 
---
Agreed. I got an elite scroll where I need to get on the level 100 pest control boat, so it has goven me motivation to go level my combat for a while. It's why I like doing elites and masters because they are usually out of my level range and give me a goal to work towards 
---
But that requires a decent amount of startup money, especially for hard an up clues and can lose you money in the short term. 
---
Pretty sure tourettes doesn't translate through to the chat box. I don't think finger tourettes exists.

How many hours a week do you play?

I think we might be able to come to a compromise. Throw on 2 prayer and its a deal
---
Quote the opposite, I refuse to give up. But I‚Äôm the case scenario if a random stranger is trying to doxx me then I would absolutely make sure my ass is not only covered, but if the offender can pay repercussions then I will 100% press charges. Doxxing is a serious issue and your lack of understanding on it shows. 
---
I proved to solutions, one with and one without an attorney. I centralize giving up because that‚Äôs the core of what you‚Äôre doing, saying ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù before even attempting; you‚Äôre entire argument is centered around ‚Äúwhy bother‚Äù, hence me constantly bringing up your weak attitude. 
---
Just remember the low guys are the average RS players and theres more of them than there are experienced players who care about keeping the integrity of the game.
---
&gt;Tradegy of the commons I guess
---
r/iamverysmart
---
That's not even close to what we're talking about. Good try though. 
---
He's not going to vote against his own interest, dumbass. 
---
And I think it's annoying that I can't zone out and do slayer without having to stop to do a clue in the middle of my task. I enjoy clues and IMO it's more tedious to stop half way through the task.
---
that's absolutely not true lol
---
see: path of exile and diablo 3, probably the most popular games with hardcore modes
---
You cannot get banned for crashing ironmen anywhere in the game. Second, ironmen have a separate corp lair from mains so this guy would only be able to crash mains. 
---
They are easier to get/do, but only very slightly. Two scenarios:
---
A) Farming clues from imp jars - Currently, to complete clues fast, your inventory needs to be filled with like 4-8+ tele items. This limits the amount of imp jars you can withdraw from the bank at once to spam open. If you were instead able to open a bunch of jars and stockpile clues *before* you ever started your "clue session" with all your teles in inventory, you would be able to withdraw more jars at once, thus decreasing banking time. 
---
B) Getting clue drops from monsters - Suppose you're on a slayer task of 100 mobs. After 20, you get a clue. Currently, if you want to maximize your clues/hr, you have to immediately leave and go do your clue, then walk back to the mob. All this leaving/going back wastes time. With stacking clues, though, you could simply stay at the mob until your task is finished and leave with multiple clues if you happened to get multiple drops.
---
..do i really need to explain how these scenarios are different?
---
delaying clue scrolls doesn't have an abject effect, it can be done at any time without repercussions for its delay. not sure if your dishonesty is intentional but your situation is not a valid analogy.
---
yes pls I love ezscape
---
I had last week's episode spoiled in Faux's chat. Still feels bad
---
no one in their right mind would buy a supporter pack if theyre looking to get their moneys worth.
---
&gt;It's designed to make you pay more than the traditional AAA game sticker price.
---
sure, but the sum of money you mentioned is more than enough if we are only regarding some tabs and very few cosmetics(unless we are regarding really hardcore grinders). i do agree that some items are overpriced, but i dont see that as a big problem because of cheaper/free(league) cosmetics and sales... and the fact that theyre cosmetics.
---
&gt;Generous league mechanics going off left and right shitting out rewards for you.
---
yes, just like these league events many times(at league start) oneshot you.
---
to be honest, your posts just read like a rant from someone whos fed up with the game and is flinging mud at everything. im not saying the game doesnt have flaws, but your criticism is generally vague and dishonest. i really dont see how having the option to choose one out of three ascendancies "kills of the originality and fun" in creating a certain build, id say the opposite; the different playstyles that the different archetypes bring makes it more varied as you can opt for archetypes that fit different playstyles(e.g. a defensive occultist as opposed to an offensive elementalist etc). 
---
as for your friends choosing an optimised build that they get to level 100 with as a result of having a knowledgeable player do most of the work for them, and them playing the game; i dont see how this is an issue. do you want to lock them out of good drops or xp? what solution are you looking for here? when did you ever need "deep understanding" of game mechanics to reach level 100 if you avoided challenging content?
---
Youtuber
---
prob the smartest thing to do and best way to make money via playing 
---
Even if it's your own item? TIL.
---
The point would be the same irregardless of if I was talking about RS3 or any other game at all. The point is that making a method more efficient in any game leads to more resources coming into the game. Some games balance this with methods of removing worthless items while some make buffs simply because they were needed. If the method produces rare items the cost of those rare items go down in response to the increased supply and unchanging demand.
---
The fact that RS3, in particular, has invention that removes these worthless items from the game doesn't matter when we're talking about OSRS because it doesn't have that skill. The new items that are introduced into the game are going to crash the prices on expensive items and extremely cheap items at the same time because there's no way of removing these small cosmetic items.
---
If you try to change the email it should give you a hint to what the email is. Like n\*\*\*\*\*\*6@gmail.com
---
There is no need for easy or mediums to be stackable.  Hard elite and master are fine, but easy/medium do not have any good reasons on why they should be stackable.
---
Start with quests in Lumbridge, "cooks assistant" was one of the very first quests in the game and is a good place to start. I would recommend googling f2p money making guide or something similar if money is your goal. 
---
Enlighten my ignorance then. How will someone in America or even the eu take action against someone in a video game with no other information than a user and use that to convince a Uk based company to give up a customers personal information? Who calls who to get the ball rolling there? Can you not see in a professionals eyes this is a wild goose chase? 
---
?

Excessive gloss finish makes everything look so goofy

No makeover mage in morytania ur gay homie
---
So the guy fights Corp in a public instances and sooks when he gets crashed? Absolute brainlet.
---
I don't have the stats to crash
---
What‚Äôs with these kids saying nigger all the time? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen one post about these brainlets where they don‚Äôt say it.
---
I do like this idea a lot. However, it kinda devalues the HC spirit cuz essentially you'd just be a 2 live Ironman. 
---
The only people this would really benefit are people who want to PvM until they die once, then continue to just do leaderboard stuff, otherwise they'll just DC or whatever all over again AFTER a rebuild. 
---
In any case, it would have to be the "extreme" version you described. Dying on a HC should pay a harsh price, esp if you want status back. 
---
I dont even know how that ties into this conversations but thanks?
---
&gt;Clues already have virtually no value outside of the extremely lucky drops
---
This is like saying God Wars isn't good money unless you get a rare.
---
Especially for medium clues, where ranger boots drop as commonly as 1/200, and you can do 20-25 med clues per hour. Currently med clues are 3-4m/hr and are *definitely* worth camping.
---
&gt;I also don't see a big problem with allowing rerolls. Since you need to complete a certain amount of that clue tier in order to have the ability to do a reroll on a step, I don't see how it is making them easier. 
---
This allows restricted accounts to complete clues they could normally not. Just makes it easier for HCIM to avoid the wildy, pures to bypass areas with quest reqs, etc. 
---
&gt;Also, let's be real, 3rd party clients practically complete clues for you anymore. Let's not act like clue scrolls are really a test of skill and knowledge. 
---
3rd party clue solving is a separate issue that shouldn't dictate the outcome of this update (but I agree their application should be reduced). Still, I don't think people are arguing clues are a test of skill and knowledge, but rather that they are an optional activity that you definitely don't have to do, but if you choose to they come with certain requirements. I'm not a purist or anything but this really does seem like easyscape, except the outcome of this "buff" would be clues are less profitable overall. They're fine how they are.
---
Interesting for sure, unique concept in terms of magic arrows :)
---
You need like 42 raids on average to get any drop with your points. It's roughly 870k pts for a drop now I think.
---
dude lmao
---
Hmm good advice. It's just daunting because my entire bank is 10mil. I've never had that much gp. I need to do blast furnace for 70 smithing though so I will probably make a ton from that.
---
Good play cuz red hair
---
Me and my friends play HCIM just cause it‚Äôs fun but I mostly skill because that‚Äôs what I enjoy in the game! Everyone enjoys playing in unique ways as long as they have fun!
---
RSN: LANFiesta
---
What if they would add instanced area for cannon area , with something like vorkath item keepsake mechanics and 100k rebuy price. Not suggesting that its a fix by any means, but maybe someone with deeper knowledge how game works could tell me why this havent been done already.
---
agi pyramid is very good income for early ironman, and it's decent agi exp too
---
like no shit you'll have a nice cash stack if you just do 99 thieving while playing 16 hours a day in a diaper
---
Who hurt you?
---
Hold off on Runecrafting as long as you possibly can. I got to level 65 by the time I got my quest cape only off XP lamps and rewards. 
---
I think achievement diaries are honestly the best way to work around getting base stats. At 70 base stats, 100 combat and boosts you can finish every hard diary. 
---
You know that 98% of the items in clues are at alch value? That's the worst argument you can use. Mediums are not affected since you can spam them non stop with eclectics anyway and by far most of hard clues rewards is rune items.
---

Been a member playing for about a month and a half (first time runescape) and have base 40 all stats and 60 in atk/Def/strength/ranged/magic.

I thought I was slacking on my skills but seeing your skill list makes me feel alot better. Trying to decide what my first 99 should be considering I've already made such good progress so quickly.
---
Do any skill capes have a very desirable ability?

It requires maintenance yes, through shards which are obtained doing activities around the city. That doesn‚Äôt justify it to be game breaking.

I was in a similar boat. I started after mobile release, and am very satisfied with my account progress (~1500 total level, pet, untradeables Fcape/Bgloves/Ddef, 35m bank).
---
- My advice to you is to complete the hard mort diaries as soon as possible. Doing post hard mort diary barrows was the most consistent GP and growth in my account. I focused on the skills, then the quests, and then the combat skills to do barrows. Then did barrows and upgraded my gear through the money i got during barrows.  Now that I got my account to a more stable point and have everything I need as far as BIS medium-leveled account I am training at nightmare zone to get my combat stats to base 90s so I can do the next higher tier of bosses. Solo Sara, Arma, Zulrah, Vorkath. Once i get to those bosses I will build money and buy the higher BIS gear (prims, torture,etc) then back to NMZ to 99s and then raids. 
---
Thats my track right now for my account and I feel like its been a great path. I did picking fungus/killing lava dragons/catching minnows for my initial money making on the account. Wish you the best of luck!
---
Yea, I stand by my statement.
---
On one hand yes but on the other most irons probably already had mains with a name they‚Äôre used to going by. Makes it easier for clan/friends to remember who they are if they just do iron ‚Äúmain‚Äù.
---
6 yads
---
well you're not wrong
---
I feel like that's supposed to be a joke but I'm too tired to be sure
---
As much as I agree with what you're saying, the clues aren't actually currently being proposed to be stackable. It seems to be a trend that people don't read up carefully when controversial ideas get adjusted.
---
They are a fun break, but most fun in between tasks when you would potentially re-gear anyways.  It‚Äôs annoying to stop what you‚Äôre doing 10 min in then come back.
---
Basically we need Soul Wars, Stealing Creations and Fist of Guthix? I been saying this ;[
---
Then why are you acting like the drop table is being inflated?
---
'You don't say.'
---
Capes have abilities such as teleporting you to the guild in which you got it and stuff,go with what you want man :) also just so you know 1-92 is the same experience as 92-99. It‚Äôs a fucking grind

If you do a chargeback your account will probably immediately get banned, whether they can contact you or not.

That is not a Runescape challenge, my friend.

Surely the school random is outside morytania?
---
Dead game mode tbh
---
No this is a swampletics post that I can jerk off too.
---
Top tier art as always.
---
I had quit runescape back in the day before these were out :/ so I never experienced these.
---
I'll have to look at some videos and see what I missed out on!
---
Jesus Christ. Jenkem.
---
fucking cringe
---
This is acceptable 
---
Get Members ASAP, and go on that quest grind.
---
Then once you get the QPC, you can easily grind all your other skills.
---
Yessssss
---
yeah it's not like there's POH training, TOB, COX, minigames, duo slayer, spec restore/heal services, ess running services, they did hunt the clue which got the entire community looking for stuff for weeks
---
Karils coif - Arguably the worst drop for him to get.
---
This actually makes sense. 
---
Nah I looked through it all and that‚Äôs the only one. Thanks though.

Shut up Mole

Another awesome episode 
---
Its literally the tier system of every other game that has tiered items
---
big agree.
---
revs, raids1/2 are great, the osrs team can clearly make good content for teams. they should focus on that.
---
Come play I just picked it up too.
---
You find shops that other ironmen overstock with junk. Non ironmen see different stocks. 
---
Biggest reason is it requires little to no skill. Not to mention the fact there are so many other similar games with high skill PvP. If you want an enjoyable PvP experience, you probably aren't playing RuneScape. If you want an ez PvP experience where you can just shit on kids because your gear is better and your level is higher, OSRS is your place. But most people don't want that.

There's something oddly satisfying about seeing you whack these dudes with that axe lol. Good job!

Pfft, this is nonsense! In Java if statements don't start with capitals and you shouldn't compare strings with == but .equals().

they just said no ge, they were taking suggestions but the version they suggested looked very simple really.

here's my suggestion but it never really got traction so they wont use this for sure

I think an interface like this would be amazing for clue scrolls. Idk the room limit on building but they could just add a different storage container, in a different hotspot or not. This new storage container can store individual items that aren‚Äôt full sets. 
---
Jagex is afraid of updating that box because people with items stored can potentially get their items deleted. There was an issue with graceful and people getting the wrong color when they added multiple colors being able to be stored. 
---
Forcing people to remove items to build the upgrade is the only way i see them ever adding anything to that hotspot 
---
And? He asked what they were and I answered

Love the series! Going to watch this later.

show the rest of the email, where they tell you to log into a specific account and send a message containing enough info for them to recover the account, perhaps maybe a past (and likely current- nobody changes their pin) pin.
---
Why in the world would they direct you to connectivity help? you panic'd and didn't think. sucks but yeah.
---
Oh I forgot everything in RuneScape has to be done at 100 percent maximum xp per hour. But seriously, what if I want Slayer point and don't want to wait till lvl 120 combat? What if I want a chance at monsters with better drops? At some point you have to train it right? 
---
No, no, Jagex took down the servers to give everyone time to watch episode #14.

what a nice fluffer
---
Precisely that. Pures are just a manipulation of the combat formula through a method of play that never would have arisen had the mistake been caught sooner. But, can't change it now.
---
How do you screenshot that? I don't get it.  Even if its on the second trade screen and one player pressed accept, it doesn't mean both did.  The only fullproof method would be to vid it lol

Thanks man, I graduate next year. Though hopefully im going right into grad/med school. Just gotta get 1 more letter of recommendation :(

What about them? Run away. Get them aggro on a bot.

The people who bot puro aren‚Äôt mains who want clues, it‚Äôs gold farmers who do it for the gold. These people don‚Äôt do the clues, let alone loot them, they sell the unlooted jars on the ge.

I disagree..  I've never joined a group on discord and assumed they'd split with me and that I should split with them.  If someone asks me I'll usually say I'm not splitting, unless someone I know well vouches for the person or I've known the person for years there's 0 chance of me splitting lol.

In another post on this topic, it seemed like the math worked out that it was in fact faster to just kill Karil if you only care about Karil drops. Check out the numbers over [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ax15ef/lucky_barrows_chest_242_coming_in_hot/ehra95p/).

I disagree, I love clues, am a btw, sucks leaving task after just potting, 3 kills in get  clue, would be nice to do a couple after a task for a bit of a break from slayer, currently this is not an option.

I am just of the opinion that players who have a pure and a main should live with the choices they've made. One account gets the full game. One account gets restricted P2P.

Yes the difference is the max hit of 126s keeps getting higher while there is no increase given to pures. Its a matter of ratio and new content.

---
Fascinating. You literally have opinions on things you didn't read.
---
If you already have a clue, droprate for clues decreases for every clue you have of that tier. This includes implings. As such, you have to open more implings on average (thus purchasing more, thus investing more money) if you're stacking clues rather than just doing them as you open them.

And so are oblivion pvm streamers who stream to 20 people playing 14 hour days.
---
Your point? 
---
3D render, and added effects?
---
Oh yeah ok fuck that hahahaha
---
Btw comment follows:
---
I see this as a way to get out of getting item locked out of hard clues. 4 out of the 16 emotes clues in the hard tier require rewards from the hard tier. Since BTWs can't trade we have to drop these clues. We'd rather re-roll for a deep wildy clue than drop a hard clue. 
---
Its an elegant solution to the recent wave of "why doesn't construction heraldic items count for my clue" posts without devaluing items. 
---
Yes
---
Someone posted this same photo not even 8 hrs ago lol
---
Much rather see stuff like this than the usual zuhaar spam.
---
Being able to skip one clue step for every 5 clues you complete literally won't matter at all. Maybe it increases the total number of clues being completed across all of runescape by 1 per day in aggregate of time saved from people skipping a long step occasionally.
---
Most clues are being done by efficiencyscapers who have the method of obtaining and completing clues down to a science. The fact that having multiple clues will slow down acquisition of future clues means that efficiencyscapers are not going to stack clues anyway. The only new clues that will be coming into the game as a result of this are from people doing slayer tasks etc. who don't want to immediately drop their task and jump to the clue. Again, unlikely to increase clues coming into the game by very much because this accounts for a small volume of total clues being completed. It's akin to being worried giving hellhounds a very rare magic log drop will destroy magic log prices or something.
---
The only thing this really changes is making it so doing slayer tasks etc. that commonly drop clues but little else isn't annoying. Getting a drop should never be an annoyance. Your autism level is off the charts if you think that's a good design choice.
---
I would love to know how many of the people saying this change will damage the integrity of the game are actually using the official old school client and not a 3rd party one that solves clues for you.
---
Why is it a bad idea?
---
You see raiskeys video from a month ago where he got all the uniques in 210 kills (one trip)? That's gotta sting lmao
---
Mains should have an X percent max hit over pures. That gap should not keep getting larger and larger or pures become useless.
---
How so? I wanted rangers and I didn't want to pay 35m. I bought 2000 jars and stood at edgeville bank opening them until I got a clue. Do the clue. Repeat till rangers.
---
For max has opening I would need 14 free inventory spaces and 14 jars. So Every time I needed to go on a clue I had to withdraw certain items. Teleports etc..
---
If given the ability of stackable clues. I would be able to open all 2000, stock up the 100 or so clues then fill up on teleport and smash them out.
---
I don't understand why you think that is the same?
---

So, I never really got into Runescape back in the day. How long did this episode alone take to make? I have a feeling we're talking weeks?
---
Literally how? They will just open implings still and go do them one at a time.
---
That's impossible
---
drew pp too smal.

Get your dick out and embrace it

Actually a good idea

make the xp/hour less because the poision does part of the damage and does not give youstr xp for it 
---
Legend_Arts you always bring it home. You don‚Äôt post frequently which sucks and is awesome because you have such good art I never want to wait but the wait just makes the next one so much more exciting. Really nice looking piece bro.

Cherish it brother.

Runescape is well known for being realistic and logical.

Next time block out top left.

It will be a part of warding

Back a couple years ago when my brother accidentally paid for the premier club membership twice he did a chargeback on one of them and then they locked his account and told him that to play again he had to either undo the chargeback or pay for ¬£52 worth of those cruddy jcoins and he paid for it then contacted a mod and they gave him the money back in runecoins. That was back when they actually read email though and I don't know how you would go about doing that now but I am sure that if you did a chargeback they would just email the registered address and not let whoever is on it gain access anymore. I don't know what to suggest you do with the jagex support though since their presence only seems to be on Twitter now and also I think there is a @jagexsupport account on Reddit too but it might be worth A try contacting one of those either before or after withdrawing the most recent payment
---
Why would pures be fighting mains? Pures destroy any normal accounts at their combat level so you must be talking about maxed mains... Which you would only be fighting deep wildy, and since they trained defense they should have better gear to win....
---
I went 64 dry this week. I got 2 Kharil coifs and a flail at 100 chests. This video made me sad

Oui
---
Scythe is still decent when uncharged, compared to the other weapons he could get.
---
Why are oh so holy pures who "kept rs running" entitled to updates specifically aimed at them when they don't even play the game the way it was developed to be played? 
---
Questing I think. 
---
Dragon Scimitar from Monkey Madness, Helm of Neitiznot from Fremenik Isles, and eventually Barrows Gloves from Recipe for Disaster. Prostelyte gear from Wanted! is also quite good as best-in-slot prayer bonuses. 
---
Maybe some of the Diary gear would be good for you too. I use my Ardougne cloak and Explorer's Ring pretty often, and the Falador shield is a 1/day prayer potion for no cost and a decent prayer bonus in the shield slot. 
---
They will still be expensive af. No one is getting med clues from slayer often, and if you are, you won't be for long.
---
Neat well that's what the democracy is for my dude. 
---
Get a life dude 
---
You don‚Äôt. You just start back spacing it...

That's not how prices work. This will hardly change prices whatsoever.

And now they're getting free advertising on our Reddit. Good one, Chief.

O

&gt; Aren't there like a ton of poro poro bots already? They have to stop at 1 clue currently.
---
&gt; Level 1 reading comprehension pure right here.

Quite accurate here don't ya think

So fking good dude.. respect!

Agreed. Also they have to keep to the standard spellbook and use food and potions able to be made in the area.

If you don‚Äôt know the history of pures in rs I don‚Äôt have the patience to explain it to you, I apologize. 
---
I‚Äôve never actually caught one of these episodes. I loved it!
---
Good luck, Swampletics!
---
Ok i'm shit posting and if you want to be pedantic about the specifics of what I say go for it, but I think you're not understanding the underlying concept. Those unique clue scroll rewards not at alch price will dramatically drop in price, as more clues are completed in the game.  The whole outcome from this update is to increase the amount of clues completed, period.
---
Medium clues are sometimes even more than hard clues, and it is entirely dependent on the price of rangers.
---
If you buy eclectic imp lings from the GE for the purpose of farming clues you lose a significant amount of money without the rare rewards from clues. Including god pages its roughly breakeven and all profits come from ranger boots.
---
Comparatively the average hard clue is almost all alchables and the rare's are essentially non existant. There are only a few pures that need robin hood hats temporarily for training rather than a best in slot item usually kept permanently by high level players.
---
Farming medium clues are consistently one of the most profitable actives in the game. 
---
Most implings are not profitable and are only for people trying to gain ranks or collection log. They are also more more rarely traded compared to eclectic implings, and other medium clue implings.  The price of eclectic implings is directly tied to the price of ranger boots.
---
We all have to work somehow
---
&gt;but this game can really be on the extreme end of it
---
It's Oldschool Runescape. Go play RS3 or a private server if you don't like it. Kids like you are going to ruin the game a second time around because of your easyscape entitlement.
---
omg i see myself am i famous??????
---
This is dope 
---
I suggest to check my youtube channel :)
---
Only Trails
---
Actually it does, because it's about the number of kills you get
---
There's a little too much hyperbole &amp; shit going on with this debate.  People make it sound like ranger boots will halve over night
---
News flash: I can literally go buy medium clue scrolls from the GE via imps infinitely based on GP.  That absolutely nullifies A N Y argument aboyr "Clue balance"
---
"You should only be able to hold 2 mediums"
---
Lol ok, and that stops me from spam purchasing medium clues on the GE how? That affects my efficiency at completing mediums how?????
---
This is a QOL so you can finish your slayer task without feeling the need to bank immediately or miss another drop.  Wow yeah guys that's gonna fundamentally alter the treasure trail economy for life!
---
Nunchuks might go down to *5k* from *8k* smh
---
That's what a lot people are doing. I have personally found her tasks longer than duradel's tasks. But honestly it's up to you. If you like her tasks more than other masters, than do her. There's no right answer.

Holy shit this is beautiful. Seriously talented
---
He has a whole series you can see a timeline of. It's been probably 3 weeks for this one episode.
---
OSRS is amazing and you should try it. Just make sure you get RuneLite.
---
"13k solos with 3 cakes" meaning solos where you get the maximum of 13k points and only need 3 cakea for food per run, genius.
---
Should be pretty obvious I'm not suggesting anybody does 13000 total wt solo runs with such a small amount of food. Well, should be obvious to everyone except you apparently

if there's one thing that the games is not lacking it's this shite

wait what is intensive about werewolf agility
---
I mean it's not an achievement to open 40 chest at once when they are stackable. His videos are impressive because he had to work so hard to make that number possible. If you want to see 1000 chests opened, just watch a mod video opening chests, it's not interesting.
---
Because if I bank it, I won't receive any other scrolls for that type, simple as that. The game basically forces you to either do them instantly when they drop or completely ignore them. It's stupid design that you can't save them up for later use. 
---
You can finish task then do clue if you dont look on 100% efficiency ... if you do then with stackable clues most efficient will be to do all clues after you got atleast 10 to not waste time getting all items and tps for clues  and doing 10clues in row sounds boring, but most of people gonna do it to be efficient
---
She's more for mid level money making. Once you're high, duradel is the way to go and then use konar for hydra and task milestones for the extra poins.
---
Well, I'd say I was getting about 200k points an hour, maybe slightly more. So no longer than 6 hours which is pretty small for a grind in this game. I had an essay to write whilst I did mine so it was easy. 
---
Plot twist: jagex is secretly sponsoring the series to breathe life back into dead content 
---
OSRS is fun, try it.
---
The elven lands would make a great fit for a temple trekesque thing through the area. It looks amazing and encounters are endless.
---
You can have rewards like a crystal tree patch somewhere  you can plant it in the elven lands, it can be unlocked by taking a person X amount of times and he'll tell you of a secret spot in the forest he found 
---
Wow, some people are really talented, you are a really good artist man

I think they've released stuff like this before. Don't quote me on that. Its sorta just vague in my memory.

I have no direct link, and like I said "if I'm not mistaken". It very well may not be the case and just be hearsay since I can't give you anything concrete.

&gt;my favorite thing about the concept here is that you can get stuck on a clue you may be able to do soon, but are still able to do another hard you have stacked in the meantime.

This actually makes clues a joke since you could just keep ignoring a clue scroll you don't have the requirements to do without sacrificing it. That's the entire point. You either go get the requirements, or you drop it. Why do people play ironman or other restrictive modes, then try to make everything as convenient as possible?

Legit like it better that way. You already explained you would be alching them.

Would love to love to catch this animal for food, waste it by recklessly cooking it for too long and then take a little photo/drawing so i can add it to my collection of images of fish I've cooked awfully
