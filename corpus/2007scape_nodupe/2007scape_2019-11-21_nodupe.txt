Ah yes DDOS protection, theres no viable way to defend yourself against DDOS attacks without spending an insane amount of money

What’s up with Scorpio dropping tons of ward 2?
---
I had to kill 3 Scorpio for slayer task and got 2 ward drops lol

Trouble brewing is fake news

all he has to do is show us his RL loot tracker if hes on it. people always exaggerate shit like this.

Yope.

I'm confused, what is going on?
---
Well that's one way to send a message for sure LMFAO
---
I kind of like it cause it rewards diversification in a limited game mode.
---
lmao calm down incel
---
holy shiiiiiiiiit what the fuck!!!!
---
idk what you're implying but they hop world to world looking for people with large stacks of bones and using dihns/arma/etc. You need 10 people to kill them (arma/dihns).
---
There's a lot of hate towards you right now so I just want to say: I like your content and I think others are ganging up against you unnecessarily. Being put in the spot light sucks sometimes - hope you don't take it personally. Best to just give nothing to the trolls: be genuine and polite and eventually they'll have nothing to feed on and they'll find someone new to bother.
---
I don't understand why people always use this argument. So many aspects of runelite are qol and should already exist in the main client.

They are super nice quality. I will definitely get more in the future, and I will always keep an eye out for the

limited edition ones that come out.
---
I've asked since the release of **Hydra**
---
The current mechanic for **Hydra** to be damaged by the chemicals is it has to be on the vent before hand to get hit. 
---
What are the Mod's thoughts on also allowing it to be damaged by walking into the chemicals as well?
---
Underrated achievement
---
Someone was DDosing Oda on every world he hopped into, so Oda went to wintertodt world to test this on hardcore ironmen.
---
Is putting my laptop in sleep mode good enough?
---
To be blunt, get over it. We all started OSRS from scratch. The game mode has been out for what, almost 7 years? You’re a bit late to the party.

Please don't give this guy attention
---
How much slower does RS3 drain run energy at 1 agility compared to OSRS? 
---
Silverhawks cost a lot of money to train with while agility courses are completely free to use.
---
Nah I don't need to be educated lol I'm pretty easily in the top 1% right now. I've thought it through a lot and unless you're rushing pvm I don't think picking your task helps much at all.
---
There are very few bad tasks in zeah and you'll get a ton of points doing it so skips are easy to afford. The farming contracts is the bigger one but you benefit more just going harvester getting triple seeds and maxing herb.  Fishing is unaffected by 3x gatherer since you'll be 3 ticking anyway.
---
Courier is mainly just for afkers. The boost isn't all that significant to xp.
---
Still irrelevant; minimal code you could achieve this with two excel functions.
---
Exactly this. I’m curious to where people think this is so easily done. Cheap ddos mitigation techniques usually end up making a poorer experience for everyone, while only mitigating some of an attack. With the speed of things now a days, the hardware required to protect against large DDOS attacks is SUPER expensive.
---
you only need to pray one bone then it does it automatically right? then you hover the log out. 
---
Haven’t done it in a while.
---
I'm in Not Alone and it's for Iron men and I like it
---
Runes and to an extent broad arrows. Also food
---
Ideally you want to just end the waves faster for faster games. With a good team you should only need heals at all at Queen, if even then.
---
hi i am new were is lumberger .?

Surprised you don’t seem to like him. He seems like the perfect match to you, toxic.

You blocked out your name in the chat but not below? Or is this not you typing?

thanks bot, these are trying times

Huh. Ill try that
---
Try using verac skirt, get a jad task and use slayer helm
---
You just have to keep going. Most people take multiple attempts on their first ever cape
---
Ayy that was easy
---
The only difference is that one is an Acronym and one is an Initialism. Both are right and both are used. Americans pronouncing herb as "'Erb" on the other hand is wrong on MANY levels :P.
---
Joe
---
Sure, I’m the toxic one 😂
---
Don’t forget that you can tag them then safe spot jad while killing healers. Tag the pray flick tag the flick. You can also use chins to tag or a crossbow

Super dumb question.
---
How did you guys get mentally prepared to do inferno? 
---
I have finally gotten my stats, gear and consumables 2 weeks ago since I started getting my account ready in April earlier this year. During that time I was super excited to do it, but now it's been 2 weeks and I feel like I am procrastinating it. I am not even worried about dying or wasting time/consumables. I fully expect to die at least 15 times and probably more and I am cool with that.
---
I know that I need to just stop being anxious about it and once I start I will feel more comfortable about. I just wanted to hear other people's thoughts/perspectives.
---
Thanks!
---
Use a verac's helm and skirt, you'll easily be able to tank healers for a while.
---
Why tho
---
Still took him 1 try to not only beat the record but also did it in like a tenth of the time. Xzact is just magnitudes better than anyone else
---
Ironman cc
---
Yup!
---
Thanks. I can pick up a bgs, I'll give it a shot!

Don't they respawn if i kill them?

Is there a CC for arceuus library, finding books?
---

---
I bet you laugh at stuff on r/funny and make jokes from Monty Python.
---
Do a dry run or two with mediocre gear and just enough consumables to get through half or so of it. When you have a feel for the task, it's a lot easier to start the real run.
---
Only if you let jad get to full health that’s why you need to tag all the healers so they can heal him while you kill them

IDK imo a group ironman league would ruin group ironman mode after. People will be used to progressing fast and will not want to play the new mode. my guess is group mode will not have a league going on during the launch.

In Runelite, there's a plugin called 'Item Identification' that marks herbs.

I want to know if you still get damaged when the fire thing breaks
---
It's a reddit subreddit, realistically not many comments end up being useful.
---
Just bring spottier cape, dds for the mage bank webs, a couple stamina pots and some summer pies. Basically will never die because who tf pks at the wildy course because no one has anything. Honestly I pk’d someone there once(while doing agility myself) because I saw they went afk and knew the had food. I was low health and close to an agility level so I did end up dds speccing them out cos banking for food is xp waste lol

Oh my sweet innocent child, when you're on this sub long enough you'll understand

No idea what you're talking about? Must be /r/2007scape

I didn't take it but from what I've seen it's not worth it. The perks with the other two options are superior to it.
---
Seeing as they are only cosmetics and there are no requirements for twisted league I would estimate ~50m for the horns but I wouldn't be surprised if they went for much less. Horns will probably be the most in demand because they can actually be used while training.
---
This is why I go to new x)

i both dread and look forward to that day

Yet another polling fail by Jagex. This is why we can't have nice things.

That's how they got lvl 3 to get firecape in Rs2 many years ago. They killed Jad to couple jo left and lvl 3 finished it

This isnt just for Oda. W302 has been getting ddosed for a few days now and ruining the game for multiple streamers / content  creators
---
Ratcatchers is worse than UP and MEP2 combined
---
Because people like you exist that cant crop.
---
Rendi could go lower.
---
?
---
That’s literally what he said. How does that counter the potential problem?
---
&gt;IMO leagues will work as long as they impose some sort of major restriction that changes the meta.
---
Definitely agree. The only reason my mind instantly goes to region locked as it's the simplest and most cohesive way to restrict the meta. There are plenty of potential snowflake ironman modes (e.g. /r/UniqueIronmen), so perhaps I'm not being creative enough.
---
Rat in a cage
---
Terrible to be honest. But I assume that's because he had a low total level?
---
I usually tune in for a few mins just to watch the trains deck when it’s happening
---
It's best practice to keep half-finished features  live servers until they're complete, but I can easily see Jagex not doing that. Half implemented code may have been on the live servers.
---
It's also portable that the backup included the test environment. Although since Jagex had to make their own level editor from scratch after Oldschool launched, I doubt it was a complete one.
---
I prefer vanilla client, myself. It's not a bad client at all, it just doesn't have any extra features.
---
Sure, that's why the very first thing I said was
---
&gt;if the choice is to lock the player to other locations.
---
For real wtf lol
---
Oda's worlds gets ddosed = No one cares. 
---
HCIM's die = People will start raging and trying to contact jagex to get their status back.

I dont know this guy but im glad bad things happen to him based off this cursory exposure.

I’m pretty sure woox could figure it out if he wanted to. Has amazing game knowledge so if he put his mind to it I’m sure he could

In my time on RuneScape I believe its been 3 or 4 times that the membership price has increased. 
---
Sure the changes are grandfathered in, but i believe people slip up or temporarily and end up paying the nee price eventually.

I think complaining about membership  costs is completely valid. Its shitty looking back how many times it's been done to us, even before things got greedier and brought MTX, and even then alongside it.

Hey! I have been planning to take this relic, when I get the points. Thanks for being the one to push it above 0% pick rate. I would have felt bad about my decision and probably been talked into wisdom.
---
I used a calculator online and with a prayer bonus of 12 you should be able to maintain health regen and a protection prayer at a loss rate of 1 point every 3.6 seconds.
---
Unfortunately rigor and other high level prayers drains too much to be maintained indefinitely with just the regen, without a crazy pray bonus that I don't think we can get in leagues. But you get very forgiving flicking!
---
Let me know how the half damage feels, I was really just counting that as an added bonus to the deal. Was hoping pvm would be much more forgiving with 8x regen and half damage. Maybe 16x later if I can learn skotizo and get lucky! Here hoping!
---
Grats
---
Which adds up to 438 dollars in a year, yeah no thanks.
---
Surely, the millions spent developing computer parts over the last 30+ years would have let them account for turning the damn thing off and on again. I just don't think turning on a computer vs keeping it on is more damaging.
---
Wasn't he using the death-touch darts, and there was a bug where the darts were giving him exp in the caves when it shouldn't? So he would've got it at level 3, but a bug prevented him from getting it at 3. The rollback was to correct the bug in the caves.
---
At least that's my understanding, correct me  if I'm wrong.
---
Yeah I was gonna use this bond and than get started than get a bond
---
Only plays when you get 5000 upvotes on reddit
---
It would effectively make clue rewards much more common by increasing the number of clues completed in game. Right now, many players don't stop PvMing when they receive a clue, or even further just let it sit in their bank because they don't care to do it. If clues were stackable, everyone would just gather clues like candy and knock them out when they have 10/20+. It would crash the price of many clue rewards (which are already in the toilet).
---
where everyone knows your name
---
If you ban DA, then aren’t you just forcing players to get their gambling fix via other unsanctioned methods? Players in the past, have found ways to gamble in the game before, via flower poker, dicing and toy horses. All methods flourished with plenty of scammers and rampant RWTing - with no tax.
---
Essentially the removal of the DA would be like the USA war on drugs. A failed campaign that will only push players to get their gambling fix via sketchy dice and flower poker sites.
---
If you are bad at pvm (or new to it like me) it could very well be the difference between learning a boss and knocking out a lot of kills on a trip, or getting clocked super hard and getting discouraged.
---
Honestly thinking about the ability to permanently protect pray and 8x regen while farming a boss has me so hyped up.
---
He was over level 3 combat already prior to the dart bug. There was a bug with him using the dart, yes. However, it gave him only Defence experience (and Hitpoints, but he was already level 79 HP I believe) but Jagex acknowledged the glitch and reset his Defence level for free. He was still able to later use Nastroth to reset his Prayer and HP.
---
Notes on the 99 defense build:
---
the difference between 70 defense with standard pk gear and 99 defense is about 35% less chance to get hit. Bastion potions have made the 99 defense build a lot stronger.
---
If you are a deep wildy pker, the 107 combat 'tank' build is the best option imo if you're in for this kind of play style. Mostly, because outlasting your opponent matters more here, but even now with multi-logging and clans it feels like deep pking is kind of dead.
---
Also if you choose the mini-main for PvM options too, staying at 60 str is a good idea as eventually T80 staves will be put into the game (and likely) be sweet for deep wildy pking.
---
was just meaning he didnt go for dwh till 800m total xp usually thats knocked out the way under 250m
---
They look like the old leprechaun interface. It’s pretty shite
---
21.nov.2012, the day all my efforts in RS2 that went towards maxing, went to shit.
---
Have you ever tried doing the lowest level dragon slayer? My friend (he goes to another school) did it on a level 2 with 8 hp, 0 strength and -4 defense.
---
Nice! I'm so excited to get there! I hope this weekend.
---
Wholesome :)
---
Sounds like you are P2P. There are guides online, and on the OSRS wiki. 
---
I think a lot of people keep their HP low so they can get high or even 99 firemaking early on at Wintertodt (for supplies, including magic logs for desert treasure). I think pyramid plunder is also popular early on for GP.
---
Someone is mad odas stream is more fun to watch than yours XD

Oof sorry for the late reply lol I thought nobody replied I am new to reddit and apologize but yeah add me in game and pm!

nice #ad

Thanks for the response. I figured range would probably need to be raised. I have some basic flicking down okay but not great. Just more or less testing the waters to know what is truly important to completing it, and what to expect overall.

I will purchase an insane amount of food and throw myself a grand feast.

The part I don’t like about that altar is that it’s purely money grubbing pkers. No challenge seekers

Will you consider removing the dual arena? nothing positive comes from it, scamming and gambling addictions.
---
/u/Rendi is a scrub tbh ;p
---
im sure this was piece of cake compared to his ironman inferno
---
the only reason why people stake is because of ease of access. Not everyone is going to go to those dicing bots or whatever because its a way bigger risk of getting scammed..
---
This is the most quality shit I’ve ever seent
---
60 hours of f2p grinding or a half hour of working at a fast food joint. That sounds like torture
---
Have you ever thought, they'd be mad that it got removed and DDOS the servers out of spite? 
---
I don't think you're thinking logically here. 
---
What you may think the outcome will be, it certainly won't.
---
For instance: Everyone was like "Oh yea ban the 7 day free trial, it will get rid of bots". It didn't really do much, the bots just switched to bonds. It only got rid of the small trash botters who were bad at it.
---
I enjoy twisted league actually, I’m just saying that it sucks to get items that will be gone in two months 🤷‍♂️
---
Since ironman mode was released over 5 years ago, less than 1000 ironmen have completed that many clues.
---
And I would bet most of them dropped their firelighters for precious bank space.
---
No unregistered hypercam watermark. This footage is fake.

This for leagues or main game?
---
Because ddosing with complete anonimity is so hard
---
Please I beg of you man you gotta find a less condescending way to convey information
---
Because ddosing with complete anonymity is so hard...
---
Oh sorry i should have specified. Just for main game
---
Train your mage on them if you must. There's really no reason to ever kill them.
---
For slayer? It's a terrible task if so, it should be blocked and I wouldn't do it for gp either.
---
LOL
---
Steel dragons are pretty awful to kill with any stats. They take a while and have poor drops. 
---
The only reason you should kill them is if you have no slayer points and can't skip the task. At which point you should use dragon hunter weapons, then trident, then zamorakian hasta, then probably a dragon short sword. But again, highly not recommended
---
Is there any option for someone who is mobile only?
---
Black chin hunters w/ PTSD rise up
---
Yeah i do need my mage up, It's 56. Don't use magic much for combat. What would be a good set up for that?
---
According to the wiki you should expect 7-10 hits per round, which is definitely bs
---
Oh yeah? I'm sure people with an addiction to staking would just completely stop being addicted and not find another way, or even another outlet to do staking on. Look at the 2010-2011 I believe, when flower games were growing rampant with dicing as well, it was legal and popular. There are still big underground gambling communities that would get way bigger if DA got killed.
---
Im not reading all of that.
---
When you started mentioning tegrity all I can hear is Randy Marsh....
---
idk how curtis is, didnt chose accumulator, and ur flair means ur a shitter in real rs too
---
I wouldn't. Things like hiscores aren't able to be parsed and retrieved by the game. Husky said this was the reason why they couldn't tell you your point percentile on the twisted league
---
The slayer staff effect stacks with slayer helm and occult necklace so it’s a decent budget option
---
Get chaos gauntlets from Family Crest quest and use fire bolt at your level.
---
Not at all, there are more clues being made, maybe thats why
---
Please tell me how you break your hyoid in 2 places strangling yourself... ill wait.
---
&gt; i wouldnt say certain cosmetics, i'd say cosmetics make up a large majority of content rewards. 
---
Honestly you're gonna have to rephrase this one, I don't even know what you are saying here. But let me reiterate, just because there are, for example, pets that you need to spend time to get, that does not logically necessitate that you could not also have, for example, particle effects that you spend money for. I'm not proposing you should be able to purchase what other people had to earn, that would be P2W and at no point in my post have I supported such a system.
---
&gt; no, i'd say thats more due to them paying 30-40k a year for software  devs working on a game that likely won't do anything to further their  career. 
---
this is some r/SelfAwarewolves material, you just made my point EXACTLY. Devs are leaving because they do not make much money, because the membership model is not what is most successful in the modern gaming market. If you need me to spell it out for you once again, a f2p model with microtransactions would have a very high chance of making them more money, thus being able to hold onto their team members by being able to pay higher salaries.
---
&gt; short term profit wise, not long term sustainability wise. 
---
We literally do not have the longitudinal data to make this assertion, I can literally think of 3 games that the membership model has worked for "long term" and that is RS, WoW, and EVE Online (honestly idk how hot eve is doing right now). And frankly, the model of cosmetic microtransactions simply has not been around long enough for us to know if it can be sustained. I would probably say one of the first large titles to take on the model was TF2 when it went f2p back in 2011, and in it's 8 years it's still standing (admittedly not doing great though). and valve also used this model in CS:GO and Dota 2 to make some of the top grossing games of all time, both of which are still doing fine in the market. And I suppose there is no point of bringing up all the wildly successful f2p games of currently because you seem to live in a reality where fortnite is going to die in the next year but frankly, I do not think it is. I think f2p models (or at least mtx based models) in recent years have proven to be the dominant force in the gaming market, and we have no reason to believe it's going to die off anytime soon.

Either drop or cut 1 as bird is flying back. Or you can continously drop. Continously dropping is more xp but a hand pain.

Just accidentally changed my name on the wrond account. Is there anyway to get that nane back?

I got 2 of each today. Still on that grind

It'd just be camped by pkers or merchers turned pkers trying to monopolize the market.

Herpy derpy. No reason to blame oda

If you have a 50% ammo saving rate, for each arrow you have you can use it 1/(1 - 0.5) = 2 times: naively^^?, the top number is the amount of arrows you fire and the bottom is the amount you use: 1 - 0.5. 
---
Compare that to 80% ammo saving rate: 1/(1-0.8) = 5.  
---
2.5x ammo usage from a 60% increase in the save rate.
---
Remember that every arrow you save can be fired, and **has a chance of proccing the save again**. This effect gets more and more pronounced the higher the save rate is.
---
I support. Can we also have a fishing spot where I click it once at level one and I don’t have to click again until 99??
---
Maybe if you like right clicked it or something..

This. It will end up replaced by something else (like super high risk pking in some form) that's just strictly worse, and not under and rules.
---
Even if you know the exact spawn point, outside of puro puro, it wouldn't be a huge help. Implings spawn and wonder around while invisible for a period of time before appearing. UIM Verf has a good video explaining it

Anyone who ever talks about oda negatively doesn't watch his streams. The reason he is so out there and in your face is because of his ego is there to back it up. I can guarantee nobody in this thread could beat oda in a risk fight. Hell he would wear no armor and throw an ely in his inventory and still beat you. His content is risk fighting (100m-1b+) and absolutely destroying people while giving them great armor advantages. So all the hype is building and he gets 1 kill. He gets 2 kills. 3 kills. He makes risk fighters look like straight clowns. So that is what the energy comes from. But he is also a very humble guy, takes jokes well, and in my opinion hilarious. I cant tell you how many times I've had to wipe my desk down because I laughed taking a casual sip of water. Definitely not for everyone, but the performance not only in game but in person is what keeps me watching. And all the bald midget al kharid guard jokes.
---
Yep bro he ddosed those worlds
---
My comment isn't misleading because I say it's for hard clues, while the OP doesn't say. Obviously the OP knows because they had to actually calculate it, they just conveniently left it out. 
---
And the main reason it's misleading is because they say 1300, but don't mention that it's 1300 FOR ALL FIVE recolors.
---
Yeah I was really averse to switching from legacy to eoc when I returned. Played in legacy for almost a year but got frustrated cause newer quest bosses weren't designed with legacy in mind.
---
Made the switch and I was enjoying Slayer much more. OSRS combat is great for AFK and its simplicity but RS3 quick genocide with Overloads, Summoning and multi hitting attacks felt  amazing.
---

Listen bro if you cant afford a few dollars a month to play then the answer to everything you just wrote, is dont play then.
---
And you think there are loads of players in your boat? Doubtful. Majority of the player base is in their 20s and have a job so can quite easily pay a few dollars a month. 
---
If you cant afford it, you should be grateful there is in game ways to pay for membership to begin with.
---
Holy shit this oda guy must be on the spectrum
---
I mean, you can basically just turn on Revolution+ mode and not have to worry about combat abilities outside of endgame group bosses.
---
Looool
---
Good, let them go to illicit gambling operations. Then when they get found, their account and dirty money is removed from the game making all of our money worth more. Fuck em.
---
Someone is DDOSing Oda because he probably owes them money or something not because he's not an Ironman.
---
That's assuming he's not doing it himself for views but there's no proof of that so I won't be making false accusations.
---
Wasnt me but you welcome
---
I thought the original post was satire. I asked if it was. U called me a pvmer *pukes* so i responded.. was it not satire?
---
Not a problem, it does create a lot of confusion sometimes having such vastly different varients of the same game
---
Thatll make it die faster, underground gambling isnt sustainable and at least it will get it away from runescape eventually.
---
mage pray doesnt work against metals iirc, it was shield+pot

I wonder how things would have gone down if they continued with all of the RS3 graphical updates but didn’t implement EOC to the extent that they did.

Unsure why people don't leave protect from mage on. It's not like you're right next to an altar

Please oh IT god, tell me what anyone can do to prevent a DDOS attack? You seem to know everything about how easy it is to just stop them.
---
    if(servers.isDDOS()){dont()}
---
If only it was that simple? Jagex has no power over stopping a DDOS attack. Larger servers won't fix it btw. Odds are the hardware that nodes use to transfer data are being ddosed and not jagex themselves.
---
&gt; If they knew or felt like the servers were unstable
---
They really don't have much response time to change servers. 10 seconds is not much time.

Whoever made this must have lost bank at the GE and be in a world of butthurt. I don't use the GE nor has it ever effected me in any way, just don't go there. If it affects your friendships you ought to learn to only lend what money your willing to let slide. The duel arena is as crucial to the game as the wildy. All the wealth goes there and much if it gets locked when bans happen, it's the biggest gold sink in the economy rn.

What would happen if you stuck your hand in there

Sand crabs, just around the furnace is by far the best hotspot I found, even taking into account the number of people there.  
---
The respawn timer seems to be between 1 to 5 minutes (I spent a few hours on a single world, and noticed \~3min average respawn). There's some bad information on reddit (e.g. someone commented on another post that implings spawn on a global timer 2x/hr, this is definitely not true in TL).  
---
Make sure to keep the RL plugin on (so you don't miss the impling when it does spawn), and change the color for the young impling to something more recognizable. 
---
Catch all implings you see, or you'll be stuck waiting longer for the respawn. 
---
Extremely important - don't be one of the morons hopping in place next to the yew trees. On EVERY world, you need to run north-south between the top of the cliff and the bridge (super important - you will miss a ton of imps if you don't do this), and east-west between the monk camp (make sure you can see the eastern edge of it) and northwestern tip of the sandcrab area (you might see implings over/across the river). The sandcrab area takes a little too long to check unless you're doing this off-peak, so stick to the monk camp, and the full north-south length between the top of the cliff and the bridge.  
---
And of course, fuck jagex for this bullshit. Nobody wants to play this stupid lottery - make impling spawns slower but per character not per world (at least for the ones below 60 hunter). This isn't even the kind of shit any area-locked ironman had to deal with; it's not like Settled had 12 worlds to hop between and had to compete with 20 new people each hour for his lucky imps.

Realistically though, he owes someone $50-$60,000+? That's nuts.

Cool how are you planning to build the jewellery box
---
Let’s just use the rough estimate of 40 hours of playtime needed to do this.
---
I’m in college, have a girlfriend, and do some programming work on the side. Since the start of Twisted Leagues, I’ve 100% put at least 45 hours into it.
---
Free time exists. When you live in a town of fuck-all and you can’t get a job since your class times would conflict with that, what else are you meant to do with your free time? Even while I’m doing productive stuff like writing a paper or studying, I’m still fishing or woodcutting on one of my spare monitors.
---
Todt with the relic is also pretty damn AFK. He didn’t put all 40 hours into the game, and even if he did, it’s absolutely not unreasonable if he’s in a situation like mine. I’m not some no-life sweatster and the activities I’ve been working on are a lot less AFK.

ToB is movement, prayer switching, gear switching, timing and a bit of supply management. It's not very hard to do in teams once you know what you're doing but it's not in any way comparable to just clicking between two prayers

&gt;If you are bad at pvm (or new to it like me) it could very well be the difference between learning a boss and knocking out a lot of kills on a trip, or getting clocked super hard and getting discouraged.
---
That's true, but I have a feeling the few bosses are going to be crowded as hell in the last few weeks. If everyone is fighting for kills, you'll need more dps instead of defence. If you get a world to your own and you don't get crashed, it does seem nice though.

Wow I can’t believe I missed that somehow, thank you.

Streamers (supposedly...) have some degree of credbility; if 5k people saw you trade them, they're less likely to scam you. That said, 99.99% of wealth moving in the duel arena isn't streamers, so they're effectively irrelevant.
---
Also, note that I didn't say *no one.* I said that the amount of people doing it would drastically decrease, and it would. How often do you think noobs trade a dicing bot that logs out on them, then go trade another one? Once you get fucked once you'll likely not go back to it, and plenty of people are smart enough to not get fucked at all. Though the proportion of smart people at the duel arena is most certainly lower than average...

Lost bank at the GE

The twisted league character will be completely removed, and if we get another "league" next year it will almost definitely be reset.

You do however get to keep pets you receive between leagues, which is nice.

This is me. I would screw around with a few mill at the duel arena once in a while for fun but I know everyone there is just trying to get whatever little (or big) edge they can 24/7. Just not interested in the mindgames.

This guy needs to go outside and get some fresh air

I believe it’s at the end of the league so mid January.

These are the type of comments i was scrolling for.

To be fair they’ll probably never ban 3rd party clients bc they know a vast majority of players use em and  jagged knows this will cause a noticeable decline in players

He'd RWT his nan if he could. Nothing to respect here.

that's just absolutely completely false lmfao
---
Yeah they added it fairly recently. It's reasonably small but it proved to be one of the largest gold sinks the game has ever had.
---
Also helps to prove that the people at the arena are definitely gambling addicts because your EV return is like 0.98 of what you put in lol.
---
He's saying the streamer doesn't pay the lender the winnings, just what was owed.  The same thing you're describing.  he just typed and didnt proofread at all.
---
As is, lend staking is net loss for the streamer and break-even for the lender (streamer is slowly taxed and the lender eventually gets his money back).  The streamer gets content out of the arrangement.   Assuming no scam.
---
Are you asking twisted league question?  
---
It is in the main game.
---
Also if he took the wintertodt t4 that also makes it very afk,
---
Competitive pvp arena with ratings &amp; ladders will never be a thing because it would actually be esports content they really dont want that for some reason
---
Nah. For every bet that happens, players put in 100% of the money. The house (jagex) take a 2 percent cut and the winning player gets 98%. Average it out over every player and every gamble, your average winnings will be 98% of what you put in, or 0.98. An individual player can beat the average by winning a single duel then walking away, but the duel arena as a whole does not create money for players.

I inatantly hate any MMO that has mtx cosmetic. After several thousand hours on any mmo i play, fashion is my and many others endgame. The best looking MMO i played Black desert, charged like 30usd per costume :(.

While games like fps and mobas work well with cosmetic mtx, MMOs do not.

The percentage tax is 1% and that is only if stake is more than 100m I believe.

Oh that’s nothing for a new league that just came out, I know people who play 10 hours a day on the main game for months

I watch him because he has an entertaining personality whether he is doing Zuk, staking, risking or whatever.
---
It seems like the other fremmy stuff is actually more common than 1/128
---
With 4 different "teleport" options (book, talisman, minecarts, rada's blessing) it makes me wonder why people need so much run energy. Yes, it's amazing early on when your agility is low, but once you're done with the barb fishing grind, it doesn't seem to matter at all.
---
Annnnd the mtx in rs3 is insanely addictive and an rng lootbox system, with sets and big promos. Exp, items and money etc all coming from it.

If you truly think that Bill Gates is only rich because

Bill Gates took a calculated risk and it worked out. He employees hundreds of thousands and has continued to bring better technological innovations to the fore front.

And yes, I advocate for people above me, below me, or even at my same economic level. I don't have to be a victim, unlike you. I choose to believe in free will and free government.

I'm sorry that you're in this mentality that you think a man who is actively donating more money than you'll ever see in your life to charity and efforts to eradicate life threatening/deathly diseases and conditions is a 'megalomaniac'.

I understand that to you, you're the victim here, you can't pull yourself out of anything and you will always need help from others and that's why you resent people who are better off than you, people who actually work hard.

just keep duel arena but make a staking cap of like 1-2m or something lol

And what about p2p?

They might all be 1/128... but theres like 15 items that are 1/128. Reducing them down to what, 1/8?

I’ve seen this fucking clown pop up on twitch / reddit/ YouTube more than I’d ever like to have ever seen. Every clip is of him having this blood curdling “slurp” noises whilst he rages and does over the top gesticulations.  Entertaining? If you like 13yr olds, sure. Holds longevity? Not fucking likely.  Dude gets “targeted” quite often. Not sure if it’s a publicity thing or what. But if the person behind it does it just to ruin this dbags time? I’m kinda for it. Seeing as he’s a massive douche in EVERY (and I do mean every) single clip I’ve seen him in.
---
When a game encourages pvp, it means ppl fight, compete for their benefits, extreme ones with gambling problems will resort to all measures. If you want no scums in this game, everyone is peaceful and.happy, get rid of wilderness pvp or enforced pvp, only friendly pvp on the consent of both sides like BH
---
I mean it does have its ups too, if you picked #PRAYERGANG, you can now afk for as long as you want to. Free overheads. i think the guys picking it are going for 200m combats

It’s literally just for clues. Seems more annoying than just a downside. Plus, you can just fill your bank with placeholders so it doesn’t matter anyway.
---
We haven't seen any Ironmen boosting emblems because they don't have access to them. 
---
The resources Ironmen can access from these crates are limited to what they're able to obtain through skilling.
---
Kind of agree here, it's possible people didn't choose this relic because of the issue with it.

Haha depends on how much you want something in game, dont have to go that far. Np man, happy to help.

The stat I want to see is how many Twisted League players want a unique chat helmet.  I'm expecting it being very close to 100%
---
He's putting on a show lol
---
All minigames are dead. Group activities such as penguin hunt. bosses like I mentioned, clan/friends chat is not an activity it's an IM service. Please don't act like e-dating is endgame.
---
Seems a bit weird that Ironmen can buy resources in the form of bounty crates - something that requires direct interaction with other players and therefore can easily be boosted - but are locked out from buying any resources from solo content like the Nightmare Zone. What are the rules for this sort of thing?
---
enjoy ban

you forgot

Agreed. The 5th tier in particular was be a big learning point for balancing future leagues.

How many kills?
---
This exactly. It's a 1/8 to get one of the 1/128 drops, and then it's 1/15 to get a ring. I just looked at Rex's drop table and basically everything is 1/128...
---
I think it might have interfered with Treasure Seeker? I'm not 100% certain but I think you have to open the bottles etc for the clues to stack which you can't when they got sent to the bank.
---
How limited are the resources themselves, though? How many ranging potions can a crate contain, and how many crates/hr can an ironman get, for example?
---
Unpopular opinion but if you don’t go to the duel or stay away from the duel arena these people never come into your life? Don’t like ODA? Then don’t watch him stream it’s that simple. You can play this game however you want to the duel arena isn’t going away. Be like the guy who post on here awhile back that only trains the base skills from when the game came out? Because it’s in the game doesn’t mean you HAVE to do it.
---
U ruined my no nut november
---
zero commission staking without taking tips is not against the rules, they specifically said (at the time of banning commission staking) that community chucks were not bannable because it's basically unenforcable.  The jagex team and policy of today are very different than the original mods.
---
&gt; Duel Arena is not your problem if you don't go there.
---
This is true - couldn't care less about the existence of duel arena.
---
If resource acquisition can be increased beyond standard levels by paying for kills/using alts, it is first a direct involvement of other player activity to benefit the IM account and secondly, against the spirit of the game mode - which has previously seen integrity changes to combat such behavior.
---
I'm sorry that you decided to say a classist ideology that commonly plagues those in the far right.
---
What was your original question? I've gotten lost from our back and forth comments. :)
---
Good idea, except Jagex is 100% involved in the Duel Arena money making.
---
I was about to do that until I saw 70m buys you only two bonds. Oof!
---
I’m trying not to use the 12m to avoid the grind. I’d just feel better with it being there, you know? I’m honestly not sure where to start it’s been that long. I guess quests are a good place. 
---
Use Stremio if you want to watch it for free.
---
God ash blessed him with a firecap to keep him warm during these cold months.
---
No, keep your money, a lot of lower leveled stalkers are scamming.
---
Damn, I think I'll come and try it. I love this mode, however, if the activity is down and nothings happening, maybe not worth it? But if there are people who play this daily then why not.
---
FWIW ironmen currently can boost emblems using alts and are doing so. As the amount of supplies is based on GE value this breaks some things for ironmen. Farming bh crates will become a new meta for ranging potions/angles as you can farm more from crates than telegrabbing zammy wine or actually fishing the anglers. This is BAD for the integrity of the gamemode. As I said before, there is no reason for ironmen to use BH so please consider just blocking ironmen from the store until it can be reasonable balanced.
---
Barb assault is a good comparison i think? No input cost, but can get rewards and requires interaction with multiple other players
---
We've had a look at this idea and it'd require (you guessed it) engine work. It may come in the future, but is not happening any time soon.
---
Jmod 1: "Do we let Ironmen interact with this content?"
---
Jmod 2: "Hmm, idk what are the big picture implications of this update?"

Jmod 1: "Dude wtf it's almost 4pm i can't think about that now, just flip a coin..."
---
The 250 firelighters would be consumed each time. They change the colour of the pet rather than unlock an alternate form.
---
i have just about 0 cash and sorta low combat so how should i fight the hellhounds, if you recommend training up first, which stat to train? i actually have high magic, but runes are far too expensive
---
RNG or its in your head. Fury's only advantage is defense and prayer bonus. Will definitely not affect kill time.
---
Can confirm. Used to trade a lot in rocket league and no way was it worth scamming. Made so much easy money and trades simply for being known as reputable and trusted. 
---
Made trading easier as well since people were willing to trade me first with their items or money and I'd give it after, saving time on not needing a middleman.
---

---
He left shortly after but he also offered to make a Dog, Kinda wish I saw that but I wasn't really paying attention after I got the heart- Gave him a good tip though because this was actual quality content
---
why would I need to play without lag, brings out the nostalgia playing with 20fps and freezes every few seconds
---
He always pays back, over a long ass time he is currently at around 75b so he already paid back 25+ bill.
---
you prob lost you bank at the duel arena and now come losing some steam on reddit lmfao dumbfck
---
Maybe ask for password just like any casual switching then? This is just convenienve
---
Implying anyone still makes rsmv's

I had his service aswell, nice guy

If you're just gonna spam this incredibly vague message, nothing will happen. You won't get anyone to help you if you don't tell them literally anything about what you need help with

It was be like that sometimes
---
Mfw more people choose Dark Altar than Abyssal Accumulator lol
---
Even if you have multiple accounts, I want to show off my trophy on my main - not on any alt I might have.
---
You should state you still have to bond each one. Thats the only way jagex could consider this.
---
Replace dark altar devotion with it
---
Not on Linux you can't!
---
idk, I watch actual pvpers with a good voice like framed that don't scream all the time
---
some of the rewards are tradeable and worth a decent amount, like the swift blade, trouver parchments and telecrablets
---
Jagex doesn't have to do exacly 100% of the suggestion, they could take this wherever they want.
---
Did you speak to oziac
---
Because they’re the highest quality consumer USB microphones. Anything nicer and you’ll also have to get an audio interface, XLR cables, and hope for good grounding.
---
Because we live in alt scape. Jagex needs my $44/month
---
Same and it’s one of my proudest accomplishments lol
---
Would there be any considerations to giving people the ability to toggle relics? i.e. Harvester?
---
Ive seen a lot of people echo this setiment, however from the way they answer the question on the q&amp;a it quite obviously does not apply to streamers whi take loans or gifts from veiwers to stake. They specifically mention community chuck stakers whi have people give them money to stake and then return, plus the money they won. The streamer makes no money off of doing this except if they are given a "gift" from the person who gave them the money making this thinly veiled commisson ataking, which is why it was compared thusly on the qa. However it is very obvious that debt streamers do not fall into thia category becuse the beiwer who loans them has nothing to gain from loaning money. If they win the stake the streamer keeps the winnings and all the loaner gets back is their original money which is not at all close to commisson staking. I dont see how jagex could ban loaning people money, as it seems unenforcable and ridiculous to tell people how they can choose to use their money. In addition would giving streamers money for free to stake be bannable etc. The list of reasons that their statement wouldnt apply to debt streamers goes on and on and i cant see it applying to them.
---
clueless
---
True. I am liking more and more posts and discussion being had for this. We all alt-a-holics lol.
---
No idea lol. Don‘t follow him, just heard this stuff from this sub. And guessing he won‘t be paying back since just like 2 weeks ago it was 80b debt lol
---
He mentioned kills per trip not kill times, which would have decreased due to losing defence and prayer bonus.
---
To Op: You'll get slightly faster kills but also will take slightly more damage and prayer will drain slightly faster. It's up to you if that tradeoff is what you want, and whether you value longer or faster trips
---
That's really cool. I don't edge pk, and I spend most of my time deeper in the wildy. So instead of 60/85/70 and being 99 combat, it seems like it would be worth it to go all in on defense and get 99 and only be 107 combat? I'm a mobile only player and the main reason is that I've tried 1 defense pures and it's too much APM to compete, I'm largely disadvantaged on mobile. I used to PK back in the day so I know what I'm doing. I'm tempted to just go 99 def.
---
Not all minigames are dead, again your own opinions and just being ignorant salty fool. Great talk, good bye.
---
It has to do with what you consider "rare". Since there are so many 1/128 drops on the DKs table, getting any of them isn't that rare. But getting a specific one would be. So getting exactly the drops you got is extremely rare, but getting comparable drops isn't.
---
Berserker ring may be a 1/128 but Rex has 20 items it can drop as a 1/128, making the chance of getting any item of the same rarety as the berserker ring 20/128 or about 15%.
---
If you're outside in the rain, getting hit by a specific raindrop is extremely unlikely. But you're still going to get wet.
---
Yeah I wish it was never added
---
But 85 slayer only costs like $25 in RS3?
---
Seeing as it requires fiddling with the engine, you might want to consider in the future allowing recolored ironman helmets in the real game for those who made it to a certain threshold in a certain league.  That'd be way cooler than some handheld trophy.
---
Well report those people with those names and it will be fixed.
---
I use torture and ferocious gloves, I still average 7-10 kills a trip which was the same with fury and bgloves.
---
Rip. Well, runelite it is.
---
Theres https://old.reddit.com/r/runescapecollect/
---
and theres a collectors forum thread on the rs forum (as well as a discord).
---
Where did you get the idea that crack is good from? Of course its bad, but my point is that trying to stop people from doing bad things can often lead to a worse outcome.
---
Idk why anyone would want the shakers anyway. The only thing they do is outright buff boosting to things like RC altars and such. Because you can just bring a bunch of stews and that. It doesn't solve bank issues, it replicates the amount of bank space currently taken up. You can "decant" them all up into the fully filled one already.
---
So really that question is a "do you want it to be easier to bring more boost options to a far away location from a bank, or do you wanna save up to 4 bank spaces?"
---
Yeah fair enough... I guess there just aren't people doing it any one time.
---
The world part is irrelevant tho, obvi everyone would go to the same world.
---
I think Bounty Hunter might just be a problem in general. It's been scrapped and revamped so many times between RS3 and OSRS. At this point, Bounty Hunter is the name of at least 4 distinct minigames.  
---
Every incarnation is either plagued with problems like this or just player disinterest, and every few years a team at Jagex arrogantly thinks that they'll be the ones to save the game when it's clear that it's just unworkable.  
---
Jagex should reconsider their stance on PVP as a whole. I could handle it when the main concern was having to deal with people killing me for my resources and spades, but now it's gotten to the point where Jagex are damaging the rest of the game in an attempt to make the wilderness so appealing that people won't be able to resist.
---
I could help buy if you want.
---
Yeah that's fair dude. Cheers.
---
You just mean with the other people doing it?
---
Have you tried waiting a few minutes before logging in?
---
I call it rare because 1/128 is called a rare drop. I don't think it's rare to get those drops, I think that it's uncommon that I would get 17 of those "rare" drops and only one of them is somewhat desirable.
---
Wait a few minutes before trying to log in
---
Yes and after that i waited an hour
---
How’d you get all the scrolls? Over time or eclectic imps?
---
If it's common sense to you, wouldn't it be easy to explain then?
---
I'm obviously already thinking about it because I made the post.
---
3 leagues a year sounds nice from the players point of view, has this league been successful enough so far to consider a dedicated ‘leagues’ team?
---
this kills the cmos battery
---
Nothing wrong with gambling. It's a form of entertainment and should be encouraged in some situations. 50M off a Tbow and want it now? Head to the sand casino and chuck it a few times.
---
Planks, rooms in house, soul runes for teles.
---
yes, mod weath, another
---
Anything that fucks up/ruins ironman is ay okay by my books
---
I think it's pretty rare to get 17 "rare" drops (1/128) when only 1 of them is somewhat desirable
---
I come here for the memes and the updates OP, not to be personally attacked
---
This might be a bit hard for you but imagine, just imagine that some players enjoy doing other stuff first. Just think about it, people that dont want to rush 60 agil on day 1 can still play this mode and not be bad at it.
---
I cried
---
If you don't want to gamble then don't use it.
---
 If you delete duel arena it will be much worse cuz that gonna support third party websites. Everyone who want to gamble gonna use them and this gonna make even bigger problem then fair duel with fee.
---
 Do you really think DDOSers gonna give up and dissapear? They gonna move to pvp worlds and ruin pvp. 
---
If you get scammed in duel arena it's only your own stupidity as stupid as getting scammed in GE with "selling 25m worth items for 15m"
---
Just let people who want to gamble to do that SAFELY and with fees that support game economy.
---
Same way clue nests aren't tripled with harvester yeah?
---
I only know of Sarachnis and Alchemical Hydra and only Hydra is instanced afaik.
---
well i think there's a new minigame focused content dev on the osrs team, but putting agility and runecrafting essentially as combat skills sounds like a silly idea to me.
---
Damn, that's pretty unlucky too
---
Base skills 60. 100m firemake. 80 thieve. 82 farm or more. 99 cook or more. 99 fletch. 
---
Rest just do shit you enjoy like combat. Pick courier for more afk otherwise unnatural selection. Pick the clue perk. Do clues for those tasks.
---
Don't ignore doing mess hall, tithe farm, farm contracts etc. You'll easily get 6k points
---
I would be completley fine with assholes like this getting banned. 
---
If you purposefully try to (let people) take down servers knowing fully well you're ruining the experience for a lot of players, then there's no place for you in the community.
---
I meant afking at work with my screen off. Guess it was too good of a benefit lol
---
I'll be honest it's not even efficient to get 99 starting out. Do it for starter cash and a few resources, but coming back later when you've got decent stats is much better imo
---
Clowning
---
Back in the days when u actually got scared if someone said they were gonna report you
---
The 5th tier shows how many more exp tasks there are also.
---
Show me a username that has the word shit in it and I’ll agree it’s unfair.
---
These items are limited to the iron man's level.  Cant recieved potions above your herb level or fish above your fishing level
---
Start training farming ASAP because that will be a good consistent money maker for you to have fun and retain membership with. Do quests and slayer while your crops are growing.
---
Flexing what nothing looks new or stands out. Only memers
---
You should play Escape from Tarkov, that game will make you shit bricks.
---
Gz, but the bgs spec weapon is questionable
---
Fixing the clue bottles is a bug fix to begin with.  People who picked Arcane courier could always make a work around from the beginning by using bank fillers.  
---
While i personally think one should put a lot of thought into picking *any* relic, I do agree that making it toggle-able would be for the best. Of all the relics, harvester is the one with the most potential to kill accounts
---
That’s true, but if you have 90+ fishing and herblore, you can get way more potions and anglers from BH than you could possibly fish/make yourself which isn’t a good thing imo.
---
I see you’re a man of culture as well
---
Not directly related to the game or the subreddit but.
---
My cousin heard Tenacious D's song Tribute for the first time and said that this part [https://youtu.be/\_lK4cX5xGiQ?t=207](https://youtu.be/_lK4cX5xGiQ?t=207) sounds a bit like Sea Shanty 2.
---
  
---
 So. Could someone make a remix thingy of where it's that part from Tribute and it melts and transforms into Sea Shanty 2? I don't have the technical know-how or the time, thanks!
---
Bring dhide to increase the chance of splashing. Take mage or range gear to fight back with even if you're frozen.
---
trained 60-64 thieving on guards in the castle courtyard and actually got my first five or so prayer levels on my own bones there
---
It would be like hiring someone to sift through and open your mail before you bring it inside. The biggest concern is privacy.
---
Just hope it's a troll.
---
I’m kind of cheating because I can sometimes get away with afking for a couple hours while at work. That’s how I got 99 fm at wt which was an assload of points
---
*10 Haunting Photos Taken Moments Before Disaster*
---
I might get banned for using a VPN (rumors told me)
---
Drop rates of items shouldn't change based on xp
---
Or do WT for gold ore, coins, rubies and more while also getting free con xp
---
Should ironmen also be able to trade other players for items that they have the levels to craft?
---
My IQ might be too low to understand how other people essentially giving you items is congruent with a mode where you're self-sufficient, in any circumstance.
---
I was very relieved as well when I first experienced this grind. I’m typically a player who tries all of the new content when it is released, but this was one piece I had never done before on my main. It is really great how Twisted Leagues encourages others to learn about new content they wouldn’t have otherwise experienced.
---

Those middle men usually aren't gambling oriented with a ban risk by the game dev
---
once it despawns u  can dig for next step?
---
Seriously it’s not even worth the time! I’ve never been able to catch more than 10-15 at a time before having to log or getting pked
---
keep the teleport though
---
Dude you're still directly supporting their business model by using bonds to get membership.
---
Nop.. That was removed a few months ago
---
Curved. Swords.
---
RWT?
---
Am I missing something? The blog post says ironmen can only get food if they have the cooking and fishing levels to already obtain them, likewise with potions and herblore level. Also they cannot get emblems so they wont generate a bunch of money.
---
Only for masters and only if it despawns due to you waiting. If you run away, it will spawn again.
---
I don’t think unnatural selection being the most popular is that crazy. Arcane courier is a noob trap and hardcore harvester has some really devastating downsides to it. Triple resources also aren’t super important when late game skilling will be done at 10x or 20x rates.
---
To be fair, bis melee is really easy once you have 85 slayer
---
Nice one, I thought that was the case but could find anything written on it. Cheers bru
---
That makes it even safer. You can see people coming and get a free teleport out.
---
This sounds like an interesting idea!
---
try it out for us!
---
if i ever get high enough level i've decided i'm going to turn my character into the guardian of the chaos temple and i'll just stand there protecting noobs from pkers
---
Is a Jester (2) even considered a clown? I guess they do kind of serve the same purpose, just a matter of target audience and modern day/middle ages...
---
didn't they want to rework it so that everyone had same stats while going into duel arena. Just make the duel arena where u actually sign up and enter an arena. Your in que until you 1v1 someone in the same style you want. So if its whip 1v1 then thats what you go for. IF its dds then you que up for a dds 1v1. the more obscure your style the less players will que up for it. This will defeat scammers as their style of combat is differenet.
---
to each their own, good luck
---
Having PKed quite a lot recently, I find it very difficult to achieve 500 points an hour, even when boosting.
---
I prefer overnight but that works albeit alil slow

**How can I sell scouts?**

Joining the discord is by far the easiest way - all instructions will be found there. You can also use twitter though.

We are definitely going to buy 10 scouts. We may buy more than that if the rest of the team is up for it.

Process to get a snafu serum
---
before: doing mulyiple runs of temple trekking for nail beast nails, going to karamja for an untradeable herb, making a super restore, and then mixing it all together.
---
Now: get fed at BH.
---
Now which is more in the spirit of ironmanmode, and keeping nearly dead content like temple trekking alive?
---
Aren't they banned from using the NMZ shop for the exact reason that they should get those items through skilling?
---
Don't forget email authentication.
---
If irl gambling wasn't regulated and everyone could put up casinos everywhere and every single store had a slot machines. Do you think gambling would increase, decrease or stay the same?

The only good argument against staking is rwt and gambling.

Don't mention ddosing. There are far worse examples of ddosing. Just look at pking, dmm, and bossing w old death mechanics.
---
What the fuck

---
I think I’m 14 days you should be able to obtain a coal bag from mlm, grab some ice gloves and start blast furnace for some good xp and gp.

Even steel bars are really good!
---
You can train prayer from lvl 1 to 43 pretty cheaply using the wildy alter and it will take like an hour to do so.
---
&gt;  Are there any imps that wander to the GE 
---
Depends on how wide you define the GE area. They wander within the walls every now and then but I haven't seen them on the grey tiles.
---
You can still have defensive perks work, you may just need to mix in some offensive capability without losing the theme - If for example instead of reducing damage taken by 50% it reflected 50% of damage taken, it might be more balanced
---
Where did you get these?
---
The other question here is how can defence be balanced around dps in future pvm content.
---
You say "they didn't know what else to do" - they absolutely had ideas, and they used their game design skills to create a game mode that people are clearly enjoying.
---
About 2 minutes into the video where you "they're killing PvP" - this is a PvE gamemode? It's not aimed at PvP players. Like I'm sure a few people who play PvP will play this but personally I've never done and will never do PvP and I'm having loads fun. I can't comment on what they're doing for PvP players, but there are many different people in this playerbase and some of us really did want this.
---
When it launched it had less worlds and as it's been popular more worlds were added. So this is in direct response to people *playing the gamemode*.
---
Later in the video you say "it's ironman, but all they've done is make a world for it" - which is a complete misunderstanding of how this gamemode works.
---
So in the interest of explaining it to you, here's why it's different to other OSRS content:
---
* It's a fresh start, everyone starts at level 1 
---
* It allows jagex to try things out that they couldn't do in the main game because it would ruin the economy.
---
* It has accelerated XP rates - this couldn't go in the main game but is incredibly fun here for a shorter experience.
---
* It's explicitly region locked - all other region locked challenges are player-made challenges, just like how ironman was originally a player-made thing that Jagex built support for in the game.
---
**tl;dr: I am legitimately having a lot of fun in this gamemode - as are other players (see the population of the worlds, people are playing it). Sorry that you're not. Just like you legitimately have fun in PvP and I don't, these aren't 2 conflicting things and there should be space in the game for both to exist.**
---
Top 5 of the year, fucking burst out laughing.
---
Gratz man! Can you share invent and gear? And what are your stats?
---
!remindme 24 hours
---
Does that gold ever go into the economy though? I figured it would just go around being passed from staker to staker.
---
damn that will look so cool with the set even more than it does now.
---
Imagine not being able to teleport to Kourend Castle
---
Why is gambling regulated irl if it doesn't do anything? If irl gambling wasn't regulated and everyone could put up casinos everywhere and every single store had a slot machines. Do you think gambling would increase, decrease or stay the same?
---
Will never forget clan wars. It was the biggest motivation for me to train my combat skills and keep playing rs. How much I want the good old days of cw back.
---
Somebody got cleaned
---
that would be great, have a single log in, and be able to select each character from a menu like any loot-shooter (destiny, borderlands2/3, etc). 
---
solve membership by buying a "pool" of membership that you can redeem on each character like bonds. on your end.
---
For character names, handle it similar to how it is now, you log into the hub with one username and password, and each character has their own name. (maybe use bank pin for certain character? - joking)
---
Vs the THAD afk fishing for lobsters in Catherby

Thats sick!
---
This is not about "sugar coating the truth in todays world" or something. It's just that there are good ways and bad ways to say something. The way how you express things will change the meaning and how others understand your message. It is a useful skill to communicate well. For example, Im not 100% opposed to your views (but I also don't share them), but as soon as you talk about being able to kill any women with ease, I probably won't take you as seriously anymore despite telling the truth.
---
100% agree the Duel Arena is nothing but Toxic and should absolutely have been removed from the game ages ago. Its undeniably from personal experience a full on gateway to real world gambling and addiction.
---
normal gauntlet is not good.  
---
corrupted gauntlet is ~3m/hr long term, with blade every 30 hours or so. for a 0 supply boss thats pretty fair honestly.
---
Lol, Jagex sneaks in the announcement of an unpolled update which effectively makes it so that ironmen can benefit from other players and thinks that nobody will notice.  Can any JMod possibly give a real answer as to how it makes sense that ironmen can do this, but not use the NMZ shop?
---
Probably their best update all year
---
69
---
corrupted gauntlet is ~3m/hr long term, with blade every 65 hours or so. for a 0 supply boss thats pretty fair honestly.
---
Exactly what I was thinking lmao
---
Ever heard of scuba diving? Scuba is also an acronym but it's never pronounced S-C-U-B-A, or MS DOS is another common one I can think of off the top of my head. Just because it's an acronym doesn't mean it's meant to be spelt. I've never heard anyone call it a D d o s is always dee dos. Coming from a computer science major with a focus on security.
---
So freeze them back...
---
BH Is a minigame, cheating in minigames despite not regularly being enforced should be in this case, even if its purely player report based. Manual reports for two worlds wilderness only is reasonable. Thisd clear all the gold farmers, etc.
---
Also on topic, its not really crates or gp thats OP for irons, its crystal seeds. Can spam vorkath for very insane effective gp/buy revs protection etc. gp is braindead easy on irons nowadays

Lol
---
I just don’t go there... that’s the easiest way to avoid all the issues you’re talking about. Nobody is forcing you to go to the duel arena.

The pot wasnt stationary when a racial stereotype was asserted.

I mean it's true tho lmao
---
Bunch of commies in this thread
---
That number is based on efficient points/h and doesn't mean you should expect to literally get 500 points in 1 hour of continual gameplay. It's based on being on the max streak and killing targets in the hotspot with the task boost. That cannot be done continually so other activities need to be done in the down time between tasks/targets but the overall result gives you  a rate of 500points/h+ for only the time you're doing bh.
---
can't if you're frozen..?
---
*Sad winnies*
---
They're technically the rates, just like how birdhouse runs are technically 150k+hr xp. Just it takes 2 minutes to do a run that gets you 4k+ xp.
---
You quit ironman bc mains were making gp faster than you? Guess you weren’t cut out for the ironman life
---
My UIM is nearing 1750 total and I've never ever been to Windertodt. How hard does it punish high hitpoints? I have 83.

why do you think arcane courier is weaker than the gatherer relic? What am I missing?

Please let Arcane Courier not send Molch Pearls to the bank!
---
I agree but be prepared for just as much toxicity to enter the low wildy with risk boxing and such.
---
Yeah thanks for the laugh. Your post is dumb dumb
---
Do quests. They speed up the early game a lot. Personally if you want some early game gp Wintertodt is easy and pretty solid to start you off. 
---
Slayer is a great money make past 70. A lot of slayer monsters are locked behind quests so questing is important. 
---
You best in slot gloves should be barrows till you can afford ferocious (and wield them).
---
I would advise you to start farming as well and collecting herbs because that’s passive money. Bird houses are a great way to train hunter and get passive money from the nests themselves and the seeds.
---
I'm getting flashbacks to when we had trade limits. Back when every change was an "integrity" change until it eventually ruined the game. I've never used the duel arena, but I'm just saying be careful what you wish for.
---
because no one told them how to join a TL world lol
---
There already seems to be one in the ge of every world with a decent pop.
---
That's what I meant lol. Thanks for the correction. I'm still trying to wake up 😅
---
It requires the Appreciation for that food item to be at 30% or greater, not favour.
---
Try hopping worlds to find one where stew is above 30% and serving them there.
---
It’s $6.99
---
RS3 bad
---
I misread it. Thank you
---
As someone who has won and lost bills, I wish they'd remove it. It ruined the game for me.
---
I thought rendi did try using the poison dagger method. Is there something he missed? Does it just come down to kiting and prayer flicking?
---
I needed the construction lvls, but love to see game knowledge like this. I don't think I've even seen a barbarian yet
---
is that not a thing in old school runescape? what am I playing then?
---
can't image doing all that tedious shit just for a single potion. lmao at ironman mode.
---
/ssssss :) :) sarcasm. Guys this is sarcastic please do not downvote. You must be able to understand this reference
---
While you're right about Zalcano, my point still stands. Bandos is probably the easiest boss in the game outside of demi-bosses/mole, and yet its the best of the 4 bosses to do in GWD. Should the other 3 get better drops just because bandos is easier? Or, how about we buff zulrah since vorkath is much easier to learn?
---
Endless Endurance gang has been officially recognized
---
I think the mentality of it is "Jagex is spending resources on content irrelevant to me when those resources could be going towards content i want" and they get salty about it
---
It's too early to say, sorry.
---
There are literally still people going for 200m xp all there. On a dead game. Figure that. Holy shit the ignorance.
---
Represent.
---
Hows is RS3 still alive
---
even things that don't sound like insults can be racist. It's just kind of ridiculous to say stuff like this.
---
It's fine for new players but it just isn't fun when there isn't any player interaction anymore and every update has to either be instanced or solo.
---
The game has just lost the mmo in mmorpg
---
“This is some good shit.”
---
Dude go back to school. If you got 17 d axes that would be pretty rare. But since they all have alot of drops thats is 1/128 there is nothing special with your loot. 
---
Go back to snowflake land dude
---
Ok great. I have classes for a few hours and then will compile a response. It's actually a rather tricky question :)
---
Disease cannot occur on the first growth cycle so water immediately after planting doesn't do anything. Watering after the first growth does have an effect. That is why no one waters their plants.
---
While having a higher mage lvl would be helpful and technically I do have 86 slayer so I could burst nechs for almost no cost, I want to give it a go now I mean I can always boost my mage lvl later to make the kills easier I just want to get the rotations down. To combat the lower mage level I actually switched up my style to fire wave plus smoke battlestaff and tome of fire. With the occult necklace on top of that it raises my max hit of 27 with the trident of the swamp to 36 with fire wave and the smoke battlestaff gets a 10% bonus to accuracy as well.
---
I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted, you’re just right.
---
What the fuck?! And here I am near max and still can’t do it on that acc...
---
You’re amazing
---
F
---
Oof. This happened to me after they incorrectly banned me for macro. They repealed it then sent me a link to get back in. And it wouldn't work with the pass I put in. I just gave up.
---
Fair enough. :)
---
Probably regular RuneScape. Does it look HD?
---
I lost. Jk, well done!
---
2 weeks of casual playing i'd say.
---
Like, I'm in Germany with my laptop. The reason you're detecting this evil IP address is because I'm  in a different location
---
I played a few weeks of a generatetask rs3 account and it was kinda fun. You don't have to put as much effort in to do stuff so its fun to mess around and get 60 rc in a few hours if you're burnt out on osrs
---
Oh I agree with that, dominion tower in old RS2 was one of my favorite things to do. But instead of a minigame it became the go-to place to train combat stats and spit out resources.
---
yeah but that's like clues for instance, people are just gonna google it anyway lol so why not just have it in the client and make it easy. waste of time.
---
&gt; An Ironman with 99 fishing and herblore could boost their bh points using an alt or buying kills and then open crates for anglers/brews/restores at a much faster rate than fishing/making them.
---
This is a much bigger claim, and I don't believe it until I see someone prove farming in BH as a high level iron is faster resources obtained than other methods.
---
You make some good points I can agree with,
---
May be the people who are new and introduced to Leagues stay around and google some guides that some content creators can benefit from the traffic,
---
May be the advertisement campaign may have been to also grab the people who have quit and canceled their memberships to come back and buy a couple months to try it out as well. I don't think it's an inheretly bad thing either way.
---
Excuse me WHAT!?
---
Wow your rng for these masters was nutty.
---
Rendi 1 up him and beat his inferno record.
---
&gt; The biggest "Integrity " update you can do for this game, is get rid of the fucking duel arena, Build A REAL arena, for fuck sakes just copy wow, That would be sickening, 2v2 3v3 5v5s with titles and shit like that ?
---
I think the Coliseum in future Varlamore is planned for shit like this, and I think it would be cool as hell.

​

It's the same thing.

Op is a piece of shit who gave death threats to the guy who ended up found to have faked the world record solo time.
---
Minding your own business till you’re bossing and the world you’re on gets ddosed lol
---
That’s such a great suggestion.
---
Speak for yourself bud. Temple trekking is kinda fun - the red tomes are good xp, lumberjack outfit can be received, and the nails are 7k each.
---
Thanks
---
Please remove D/A so I stop staking my extra gp!
---
Yeah try it today
---
Carple
---
Because marketing think they have good ideas.
---
this is the only good reply to this anti gambling circlejerk thread lmao
---
its cause they're cowards
---
Okay so try to eliminate corners of the map. For example, tele to Al Kharid, check the temp, and then tele to varrock. If the temp in varrock is warmer than last time, it probs isnt in the desert.
---
You seem really personally offended by the duel arena lol
---
[Now with Autotune](https://youtu.be/bSiEB64FyF8)
---
No, *you* don't seem to understand the point of what you're saying. Before we go further into this discussion I do wonder- have you ever done a solo raid? Do you know what mage run/4:1 are and why not knowing them means taking half damage is completley irrelevant?
---
Quit crying nerd
---
You know what needs to be done.
---
You sound like the kind of person that bashes people who play fortnite
---
My armour is too strong for you traveler. You cannot handle my armour.
---
kempq is seething
---
Its how I got used to EOC when I came back from my break so I have a lot of found memories.
---
It was a really nice edition and the buffs and debuffs you get while playing make the challenges super fun.
---
I still have nightmares over *No more Nomad no more*
---
Does arcane courier still automatically pick up the clue nests like it did before, or will you find them on the ground?
---
nah the toxic people are the pvm shitters that think they know better than everyone else
---
No idea. I never kept track of exp rates. I'd guess I averaged 45k an hour in the endgame, depending on how much I paid attention. Also, no prospector outfit.
---
Depending on the part of the world he lives in, that's more than the avg wage.
---
Unpopular opinion, but what is even the point of playing IM when you rely on methods like this? Might as well play a norm acc then
---
Now it just so happens...
---
Hence the whole unlinked scam accounts
---
Have you tried recovering? It should go through if you remember the most important details like passwords, credit card used, etc.
---
Sad tegridy farms arc is over
---
Oof the ironman smackdown.
---
Sit botter.
---
I'd love to see some kinda weird mechanic that just flips the way things are done upside down. Definitely make the perks more diverse so you don't have over half the people on the same ones.
---
Doesn’t make any sense. Especially when the streamers put the sponsored tag on their title. Why the fuck should some rando who has literally no idea what they’re doing get more attention than the streamers with 5th relic and raid kill counts within the first week? Unreal
---
Hnngh, keep going. What weapon and shield?
---
You're getting warmer.
---
Lmao this is me out there trying to get a bear cub
---
Yes.
---
 You're being so incredibly naive here. Why would extra prayer + half damage not help someone?
---
An entirely new area would be amazing. However, dev time would be insane.
---
Is he even good enough to do it himself or does he still have to borrow accounts for 2,200 trolling/pking?
---
To be fair there was the option to have a stack of the thing to be gathered (be it logs or raw fish or what have you) and fill your bank with bank fillers achieving the same goal of bottles/geodes to your inventory instead of the bank. You really just removed this set up step and added qol for those that didn't know this worked. 
---
Honestly leveling the playing field a little is the real effect of the change. Solid imo.
---
Leagues: is going through Eodan the only way to get tanned leather? Need the vambraces for splashing.
---
&gt;I’m tired of seeing people lose their banks, and sometimes even their minds with it.
---
Bro it's a video game. Maybe these people should be admitted into a psych ward. Like damn we can't even have shit in video games anymore cause kids gotta be retards. I haven't staked in years but if I felt like it why do you want to take that freedom away from me? If people took personal resposibility for their actuons and this world would be a much better place.
---
🦀🦀🦀 CSM Grinston won’t respond to this 🦀🦀🦀

How long does something like this take?
---
Yea and op (who currently holds the actual solo wr atm) subsequently sent death threats to the guy who faked it
---
eXHcIm bTW
---
I agree but if we don't have the Duel Arena then they go somewhere else. It's a gold sink. It's kept within Jagex's hands, monitored, etc. This is the best bandaid fix for now.
---
They're not going to make a change like that this season. But they did discuss some potential ideas for next season, and I believe this was one they said could be a fun idea.
---
Because they aren't resources.
---
Wow. So out of touch it’s not even funny. One hour? Really?
---
This is a good suggestion. Those mystic robes are super goofy, no matter the color...
---
Resizable, 60 fps "cap", which is really 50 fps due to client limitations.
---
God tier post
---
Ok the swag is definitely worth it, but what hunter xp were you getting?
---
Range will be the best dps in league until you get endgame gear. The lack of strength bonus gear really hurts melee.
---
Was thinking the same. Legend
---
ObViOuS sKiLliNg OnEs
---
In fantasy lore it is a general rule that magical armour fits it's bearer. Since Bandos is a literal god and Graardor is his highest ranking general, one can assume his armour is magical, and thus, resizing. 
---
Meanwhile goblin mail is normal tin. No magic properties.
---
They don't care. After wildy slayer came out I said in ironmancc that paying for kills is now cheating, and everyone would start arguing with me that it was ok. They will abuse anything because they don't see how it devalues their own achievements.
---
I always gotta call it out but I’ll at least help afterwards lol
---
How do you ‘see’ how many arrows they have though? Was it a reddit post?
---
They're what are called suici*** bots. Jagex bans in batches. This lowers the rate of false bans, "I know, haha." They essentially make as much as they can before getting banned. Low requirements and easy to do are the basics of it. Look at f2p pk lumbridge for a perfect example of vial fillers.
---
to be fair that's where most of the money is in the industry
---
Some people just wanna argue
---
!remindme 2days
---
Aaa I’m too new to the game to get it but I’ll save it so one day I can achieve audible nose exhale to this
---
i think its multiple people
---
Missing the swamp tar and crushed gem
---
Meh, I can still show that I have 0 kills on my account proving that I never abused it.
---
Wow you dont give up. You got 1 ring. You killed 100 of each and didnt get a archer/zerk. Its nothing worth crying over. Everyone is arguing against you. Dont do drugs kid, you need your few brauncells
---
RS3 is phenomenal. Give it a shot.
---
Wouldn't be the first time irons have had access to something for a short period of time then it was yoinked away. Don't see why they can't yoink this away too, preferably sooner than later.
---
It’s an incredibly broken in my opinion. One of my friends that I started playing OSRS basically just afk’d NMZ for 3 months until he was pretty much max melee stats and made money off the herb boxes. Here are my complaints:
---
1. Most AFK training methods are worse xp/hr than the more click intensive methods. In NMZ the difference isn’t really that big.
---
2. It’s profitable.
---
It definitely needs a rework but I’m afraid that everyone loves the easy afk training so nothing would pass polls.
---
Are you sure your stats haven’t been reduced by the cold on the way into the GWD?
---
Do you take commissions? Like this art style.
---
Really doesn't matter honestly. The Ranging potions, super combats and sanfews are definitely inflated but this doesn't impact ironman mode whatsoever, that's the beauty of it other peoples' accounts don't really impact yours.
---
Method?
---
&gt;I’m losing out by playing twisted league.
---
You're not losing out on anything, just because you want it now and not later. It's delaying your goal, not preventing you from achieving it.
---
&gt;And you can say what you want about it being delayed but when this is over, another season of twisted league will come, and the delay will be indefinite.
---
They're not running leagues back to back.
---
Quetzalcoatl would be a pretty nice boss
---
Good enough to...? Level an account to 2200 total? Not sure what you're insinuating, he's obviously the one doing the pking, he just borrows accounts for different pk builds.
---
are all leagues going to be ironman style?
---
Doesn’t have the Western Banner equipped either. Bet he uses some lame excuse like “I only have 1 weapon slot”
---
With their blowpipes and dragon darts
---
nicely done
---
I probably won't get the details exactly right, but I think a red x action will stall an NPCs attack for 1 tick, and you can spam it repeatedly so they don't attack. You might also need to standing on top of the npc?
---
What guards?
---
Chad's are meant to not give a fuck about efficiency and only play for fun.
---
I’m just saying, prepping a fresh iron account for WT runs was awesome. Mining and smithing on a volcano for a steel axe, getting the thieving up to get cakes for food during the run, getting some warm gear that isn’t conventional full clue gear. Suddenly prepping for WT took a full day!
---
I saw the dog.  It's very long, like a weiner dog, in order to have room between the feet.  It very much resembled a dog.  I was very impressed.
---
Sounds ez enough amirite? 
---
Lemme just pull some 99s out of my ass while we're at it. :P
---
Mystic with low def slight prayer bonus would be awesome. Arceuus spellbook is all about raising the dead for pray exp so I think it fits.
---
Damn, I really did get hit hard with the downvotes. What do I do now?
---
Seriously though. You would be limited to bone weapons with no armor (since it doesn't fit) and have to fight waves of mid level monsters. I'm all in for that
---
pretty sure you could see somewhere that she had like 15 jobs in 9 years so that tells something...
---
Fully agree.
---
you have to do cranes to at least 15%. after that, you can gather fish, which i think is slower than cranes but definitely cheaper. 
---
to do cranes, you need 60 wc and 75% hosidius favour for the sawmill, 30 crafting to actually do the repairs, 90-120 planks depending on if you're getting 15% or 20% from cranes, 9-12k to make the planks, and like 400-500 iron nails. you should just make the nails rather than buy them from shops, since they respawn rather slowly for the amount you need, and they're usually sold out.
---
i, too, used the client reward on something other than pisc ;(
---
You know a ton of people play a gamemode EXACTLY like you describe. They unlock an item and then they can buy it or sell it whenever they want. It's actually a pretty popular idea. In fact, I bet that if a game mode like that came out in osrs officially, it would be just as, if not more popular than regular ironman mode.
---
While there may be \*boosters\* there are definitely ironmen that like to pk and do so in a 100% honest way. Grouping all of them into one category is a dangerous sentiment.
---
I believe you're speaking about meta-efficiency, not practical efficiency, in which case you could extend your argument ad infinitum and would have to conclude that maxing is 0 time because you are going to max eventually anyway. The fact of the matter remains that you can not do 30 birdhouse in 1 hour.
---
😏 who said it was different?
---
I'd welcome a GE tax, but good luck getting it approved. Players are fine with the duel arena tax because one can argue "lesser of two evils" and gamblers are a popular demographic to tax.
---
Do you want them to turn dusk mystic in to this or have dusk come from somewhere else
---
Next up: combat 16 inferno max cape
---
The new area should be tutorial island for next league
---
Rs gold is worth irl cash, rwt exists
---
Screams macroing to me
---
The answer to your question is found very easily in the news post. Literally a section called "arcane courier".
---
I can complete that in about a day of time
---
What about lava drags?
---
Wow seems like a weird decision by jagex
---
To be fair, you can make something smaller from if you have excess, you can't make something bigger if it's too small.
---
Your one of the rare people that play for thr pvm
---
It has nothing to do with being special, it's to make it easier to differentiate who is playing Leagues amongst friends
---
Also the fact that it looks like incoherent environment assets barfed onto a random part of the map.
---
3x as long? I don’t understand what you mean. I was getting on average 7 pearls an hour. 
---
I needed 1,150 pearls for the fish sack and fishing rod. (technically 850 because i sold 3 tenches for 300 pearls.)
---
Pam: they’re the same pictures
---
It's funny because the duel arena doesn't bother me at all.
---
Why? I never go there. Neither should you. Leave it for the people who want to do it.
---
Looks to be moth
---
11$
---
I thought that was a lego
---
somebody just got cleaned...
---
When you have fun playing the game
---
I used close to 1000 steel nails and steel is so much better than iron nails. Try to get steel/mithril nails when repairing cranes.
---
Imo, the journey collecting resources was more aids than the repair itself. Having to get 75% hosidius favor to enter woodcutting guild and then making 120 planks and then mining coal and iron to make steel bars and then nails and then repair
---
I measure things in terms of wise old man minifigures
---
This would he amazing! Honestly I think there should be a set bonus where it would allow the floating idle animation. Instead of replacing dusk mystic though what about making this rewards with Arceus favor or Arceus tasks? Like random reward from turning in books, subduing wintertodt, random drop from ensouled enemies, maybe even randomly found when crafting blood or soul runes? 
---
Just a suggestion since would be weird to just replace an existing item
---
Yeah, wish I could turn a relic "off".
---
“It’s just there to RWT” his words, and they’re bullshit
---
Not to sound cheesy, but I think game knowledge is what makes someone the richest. It’s one thing to use moms credit card to buy max gear, but if you don’t know how to sustain your cash stack then all the weapons and gp in Gilenor won’t mean a thing if you lose them.
---
I’m dreading going from 70-72... I hate mlm.
---
I can't tell if your comments here are satire or if this is truly what you believe
---
Make something that randonly generates a map for every league.
---
I thought everyone went for full gracefull before wintertodt. I see so many gracefull low levels when soloing
---
Nice
---
Since everyone would be getting a fresh start in new leagues, playing in a new economy would actually be pretty interesting.
---
Even in this league, players being able to specialize in getting certain resources would make for a very interesting economic situation
---
That's my notification sound when my mother texts me
---
So naive
---
I hate to break it to you, but you will not be able to sustain yourself with bonds.... You either will farm money and not progress in the game or you can progress in the game and gain little to no money. Either way, i find that those who go for the gp, often burn themselves out quickly. Also, in PVM this is the perfect way to burn yourself out, as in order to make good money from pvm you have to progress far into the game. The best way by far is to level whilst buying membs then sustaining later with vorkath/xulrah/raids/high level slayer.
---
Ha! I’m flattered that it looks good enough to be mistaken for a lego!
---
He abandon us
---
Thanks for fixing the arcane courier treasure seeker interaction
---
I’d like to see a full colour wizard set. Like the elemental wizards off falador/port sarim. 
---
With bonus adjustments to their respective elemental spell. Be it rune cost, max hit, accuracy or something else.
---
Totally agree. The least they could do is poll it
---
Thats what my stepdad called me
---
The issue is there is room. You don't need to hit the same thing as people. it's toxic and clear you don't get ironman drops
---
Elaborate
---
Yep happened to me :/
---
No
---
You cant do that in rs3 you dumb fuck
---
Now cook it!
---
Thanks, I'll trust you on this one :D
---
What level do you start getting a chance at a dragon stone? Do you have to be wearing a charged glory?
---
Or they finish their degree and then pay off their debt? Not that hard of a concept. If I take a loan for a 2020 tesla, I sure as hell will pay it off, not leech off my neighbors to pay for my own expense.
---
Fletch those mf bows
---
Craws bow is lvl 60 range  req, 4 tick , +75 atk + +60 range str, WITH AN ADDITIONAL + 50% ranged accuracy and damage boost is applied when attacking any npc in the wilderness.
---
this wont that have additional benefit and it will be a lvl 70 or lvl 75 range req. so i dont believe it is
---
Who bosses on w302? That world is only for staking and he standing
---
Yeah i thought of doing barrows but i dont know if its worth for me to get my combat skills up since its just rng
---
Perhaps permanently linked accounts? 
---
As in, I can link two of my accounts to trade rewards and they can never be unlinked or linked with a new person. Then it's as easy as having a main account and a season's account.
---
At least then, a player could only buy into in this black market once.
---
Do we have any statistics on new players joining OSRS that have never played RuneScape in their entire life? It’s probably like 5% or less of the player base lol no new gamers want to play this game especially after seeing some random person on twitch not enjoy it at all. This game runs on nostalgia and none of these people have any ounce of care for RuneScape, just giving them money for no reason lol
---
someone created a runelite plugin that puts a custom icon next to your name for evscapes unofficial group ironman series, which is entirely client side
---
Clearly pvp is dying and I am spesking on behalf of real runescape pvpers, we want more pvp updates they removed dmm and now have put in a skilling gamemode instead. Twisted leagues is truthly nothing new ironman have been here for ages just becauze you chanhe exp rates doesnt make it anything new.
---
commander package by ttesports. not really sure on specifics
---
I was planning to, but haven't yet.
---
Combined with Dark Altar Devotion it gives infinite overheads. AFK slayer all day.
---
FWIW at max combat using t4 emblems to pair with your alt you only need 1 alt 2 slightly speeds it up. I'm not theorizing the rates here this is what people have actually been getting for the past few week.
---
I wish I was making these numbers up and it was actually a lot worse, or even ideally ironmen would just be disallowed to use the store but this is what we've got.
---
How much does it make
---
You don't. Those came straight from the gem bags I bought with gold nuggets.
---
There’s set spawns. So you can always stand in front of the enemy spawns to save time.
---
They're literally doing both. 
---
He's not in charge of whatever you are crying about his job is marketing and bringing in new players. Stop trying to talk down to someone who can't do anything that you want.
---
They've been busting their ass to add more security, be more transparent (look at the blogs about PvP / Bounty Hunter / Twisted League), they said they're working on customer support (which is not a 1 day / 1 month / 1 year task), they are already trying.
---
&gt; Throwing a person into a game ... In hopes to get new players is insane
---
He literally just told you that the people who are trying it are actually _playing passed the hour_ which means they understand and enjoy it to an extent.
---
So I should transfer all my GP while I can?
---
&gt; Why don't our skills / levels transfer from our original account to our OSRS account?
---
Because there were methods for training that existed in RS2 that didn't exist in OSRS like Runespan that would've given a huge advantage to anyone who just made an RS2 account and transferred to OSRS. It's more fair to everyone if you have to start from scratch.
---
You wrote a whole paragraph without conveying any useful information. I would hate to be the Jmod that has to read your fucking thesis paper on why you shouldn't have been banned for botting.
---
you don't need staminas as they never jump when you're next to a wall, just have to pay attention to the purple guys exploding. with bones to peaches you shoudln't need extra food when camping these if you actually pay attention. sure you can't just pray and afk like most bosses in the game but they drop a 40mill item so can't really expect that.
---
That is runescape as a whole. People played at the start, argued against updates of any kind because, at its core, that is the beauty of RuneScape. The grindy tedious aspect. When people started voting to get rid of that and make it easier, people began playing unofficial Ironman accounts to restrict themselves and have more fun with the long grinds. Well here we are again, continually making things easier and thus the cycle will continue. It’s just the progression of RuneScape unfortunately. Time for OSOSRS!
---
Yea I know economy would be fresh and you could even just farm resources/items and sell for GP on the main game.
---
But I personally love the whole self-found aspect, I don't play ironman on the main game because it is too time consuming, but on this game mode it is perfect because of increased exp and powerful relics.
---
But Craw's bow doesn't take arrows, which add their own ranged strength. Assuming this bow could fire dragon arrows, which have 60 ranged strength, its ranged strength would be 130. Also, you need ether to fire a Craw's which makes it very costly to use, as opposed to arrows which are relatively cheap and also mostly saved with Ava's devices.
---
Again though - you are deciding arbitrarily when you start and stop the clock on BH. The logic works the same way if you apply it to anglers - because you have a chance of catching 1 angler per 5 ticks, you can technically claim that in those 4 ticks you aren't ~actually~ fishing for anglers, so you can exclude that and come up with 1200 anglers/hr. That doesn't mean that you can fish 1.2k anglers/hr.
---
As soon as you take an EHP approach, it means creating artificial, and necessarily arbitrary, time distinctions that have no actual bearing on how long resource gathering takes.
---
I already conceded that BH is meta-efficient, and your example is just a reiteration that BH is meta-efficient. I don't take issue with your example at all, but you just proved my point when you said that over the course of 1 hour you can get more anglers from fishing anglers than from BH. That is because over the course of 1 actual hour, you cannot obtain 500 bounty hunter points.
---
I feel we are going in circles
---
100 gp split? what fucking golden spades r u pking? XXXDDd
---
What do I need to say to make it useful? I'm curious. I would play on mobile and click my weapon to stay on the pump while at work or simply afk pump on my 2nd monitor while playing another game. I have no idea why I was banned for using a 3rd party client, and am open to all suggestions as to what "useful information" is
---
well its called a "dark crystal bow" that means like crystal bows it only fires it owns arrows.
---
So what should you do if you want an official mode that is competitive and restrictive and grindy/tedious that proves you can accomplish something that takes a huge amount of time and commitment? Just play a different game? Cause that’s what RuneScape used to be but isn’t anymore.
---
How much gp
---
I’m so glad they censored that f word so little kids can’t see what it says
---
Bounty crates aren't the only thing which is OP. You can buy Dragon battleaxes for 6 points each, and they alch for 120k. That's 20k gp profit per point, which means you can effectively gain 10m gp/hr on an ironman.  
---
Also want to say something about Crystal weapon seeds. There are currently 5 ways of obtaining it other than trading other players:  
---
- Complete Roving Elves quest (one-time reward of 1)  
---
- Buy a new crystal weapon for 900k gp and uncharge it  
---
- 1/50 droprate from The Corrupted Gauntlet  
---
- 1/120 droprate from The Gauntlet  
---
- Buy at bounty hunter shop for 4 points  
---
These seeds are used to get Crystal acorns, which are used to grow Crystal trees which give 13240 farming xp and ~15 crystal shards. It's the best way by far to obtain crystal shards. As can be seen from the sources of Crystal weapon seeds, the only viable way to get them is from Bounty Hunter shop. You can get 125 Crystal weapon seeds/hour effectively there. And they don't even fit well in that shop: you'd expect crystal things to be obtainable in the elven lands, or at least have the best method there. Instead, jagex decided to remove it from zulrah's drop table (boss located in elven region), even though it barely gave any. And then they made the new Bounty Hunter shop in which the seeds barely cost any points.
---
Twisted Leagues btw
---
Well obviously. That's not the main game though, and that is an artificial restriction placed on the account. Totally different.
---
Oh, probably should have noted that in the image then.
---
He's not saying it's impossible, just explaining how the other icons work. It's likely they wouldn't want to add a new icon using an entirely different system. That just leads to code that's harder to support in the future (and from what i understand, their code is already pretty messy)
---
/s not needed
---
max combats it would be faster yes, but it would also be a much larger risk if you got caught boosting
---
Is anyone else not having the hiscores page update? This is just on my normal account and has several hundred thousand less xp overall. At first I thought it was crystal math labs being weird until I saw my hiscores page hadn't actually updated since yesterday even though I logged out and world hopped a few times this morning
---
Well Jagex has stated that account sharing is not a bannable offense, merely something to do at your own risk, so I don't know what you're trying to accomplish
---
Wait is it you again? I saw this comment last time this topic was posted.
---
Why don't you go for world record of CoX challenge mode. It doesn't have to be scouted.
---
at least it's better than it was, but yeah
---
Most of those people would get auto banned for RWT due to large amounts of money being randomly traded between accounts lol.
---
That’s what I said all irons should be instanced at WT And be forced to play alone all the way to 99 or 200m xo whatever they want to do
---
You can legally start working at a job at 14
---
You can buy it from the shayzien armour shop but you need 20% favour.
---
Ive been to everywhere legal in the world and i gotta say Amsterdam is the best by far
---
its funny because that gold is only being sinked by the addicts that rwt to stake.
---
Remove staking, remove chinas biggest fund remove the need for a gold sink
---
all together its the greatest possible move we can make as a community for "integrity"
---
It’s continually lowering the grind. Need brews or anglers for a quest you’re struggling with? Bypass the fishing and herblore and boost for them? It’s pointless for ironmen to have access to them when they can’t even loot kills in Bh.
---
Btw
---
3t barb fish with only 1 open inv space. You only catch 1 fish and 2 drop to the ground. Drop, fletch, and fish again.
---
He needs to take it to the sand casino and double it
---
while we're add it, let's implement a trade limit to reduce RWT
---
I put random **words** in bold text **to** emphasize how annoyed I **am** with nonexistent issues.
---
It's easier because you don't need to spend any money or train any skills to be able to run longer distances in RS3 than OSRS.
---
The reason staminas are "stronger" is solely because they restore 20 points of run energy, allowing you to run nearly infinitely provided you keep drinking them. The same thing can be accomplished on RS3 with their own items. 
---
In RS3, because of how much slower run energy depletes, you can accomplish a stamina effect by drinking normal energy potions which replenish 20% energy each dose. In RS3, they even have items which replenish 100% of your run energy instantly.
---
There is absolutely no way OSRS's run system is easier because of graceful and staminas. Staminas literally put us on the same place as a level 1 agility character in RS3 and only last a minute per dose.
---
Given that Zolcano is a non combat boss, all you’re really saying is “I got lucky at 54 combat”. Congrats however, I want that pet!

I once met a guy on this subreddit who just *could not* comprehend that birdhouses were more than 4k exp/hr. He was convinced that since you get 4k experience in 1 hour, that's all there is to it. People tried explaining that it's 4k/5 minutes, which converts to ~50k/hr, but nope. Absolutely would not budge. 
---
Seeing the reception of your explanation, I think there many more of these people on this subreddit than I would've hoped. You even prefaced the entire thing with *if you have some downtime between activities*. The reading comprehension of this sub makes me sad.
---
Hey, shut up.  I've got a firelighter collection that is going to make me rich and I will not let you ruin it
---
What do you think will happen if they do? Ddos will increase 50 fold. I was going somewhere with this post but my dog distracted me, they simply won’t do it though and servers will be attacked permanently
---
I’ve just bought maxed ranged gear, justiciar, a spectral spirit shield, dragon hunter cross bow and the lance as well :)
---
Honestly I think Hanlon's Razor is applicable here. 
---
Of course there is a chance that there could be rogue JMods, but one or two of them wouldn't have the kind of pull to do most of the things you mention.
---
Most likely the team is just underpaid and overworked.

There’s nothing I really need or want that badly with runelite. I used osbuddy since it was the most popular years ago and never switched

I’m fine with adding these in addition to the dusk mystic. I like the dusk mystic lol

---
personally i think it's hilarious the same people that voted no to all the rewards are now getting the tegridy of their game mode ruined by the crates

Then you could use ahk to remap the buttons

Talk to konar and ask her to ignore your combat level when getting a task

The dream!
---
Thank you homie hahaha!
---
To be fair, Kree'arra drops armadyl armour and he doesn't even wear the armour. Same Can be said about the minions for both Armadyl and bandos, maybe both bosses and the trusted minions have a shit ton of armour for their followers of all sizes that they just don't give out easily
---
to be fair they also discuss weed
---
The dream indeed bro.
---
Love how every gaming company regardless of their type of game HAS TO TURN IT INTO AN ESPORT.
---
It's fucking stupid. RS can never be an esport. The only factor that differentiates players is time. 
---
There is less skill involved in this game than hearthstone. 
---
Stop fucking greeding Jagex and look after the people you DO have instead of trying to go after more people at the risk of losing the actual paying customers.
---
It was all a dream!
---
people should do things that benefit them. brilliant.
---
critical thinking doesn't mix well with this sub
---
basically anything that isn't a high quality joke and simple call to action is going to be ignored
---
P.S. this is my first pet in the game
---
You can boost to make a potion or fish anglers as well though. And at least you know you’ll get those items on the first try, vs having to play with rng and possibly going 100+ points dry.
---
Smashing!
---
Tell me again how pking is easier than fishing? Especially on an ironman.
---
Just don’t go. If you don’t go to the duel arena it literally has 0 affect on you

"It just works." - Todd Howard
---
Yeah fighting over making the journey alone when wt is full of irons stocking up for later. Iron should be all you is what most say so they should have to play the game completely alone
---
Sell me a kill I’ll pay u 100k right now or I’ll hug lvl 1 and never skip because I’m an Ironman and fuck you
---
All these posts make me laugh because all the normies are complaining about game integrity when they play RWT only mode and gold is like usd$0.30/m
---
Op sounds like staking addict

Would be cool to see people do a new raid with limited access to equipment and strategies for 2 months before they were in the main game.

That’s what I’m saying it should be an instance for any iron men no help at all. 20min+ each kill

Congrats, King

Alphas dgaf about EHP, they brute force their 99s with whatever method they feel like.
---
Yep it looked like something ripped right out of a private server, pretty much every slayer monster bar a few crammed under the gnome stronghold. At least the catacombs keep some semblance of a theme (demonic/spirits) with dragons and whatever else thrown in.
---
I think it would be fun if every account could only be logged in for 24 hours throughout a 1 month period which is the duration of the league.  Who can be the most efficient in that time?
---
Im looking more of "stab"
---
if its on base runelite its allowed...
---
Not sure how content like this is still available considering the caustic conditions of the mini-game. It feels as if Jagex is the abuser of the sand casino. And as if they control the dicers and botters which never seem to disappear. Oh lawrd
---
2t Fishing isn't EHP, 3t Fishing is, 2t Fishing is quite chill aswell
---
Better luck just posting it here, the RS forums are dead in the water.

Lol? The Wilderness is literally the only place in the game with any risk..
---
*takes off d med slowly*

ignoring it isn't a good option

the idea of Common burnts are cheap because people low ball the fuck out of people cuz they don't know the worth of burnts and usually people don't have alot of them or just need quick cash. there are alot of variables to play with :)
---
i wouldn't call having every BiS gear "excessive" but that's certainly a good indicator of being a 1%er. once you get to sparc mac (10b+) levels of rich is excessive, at that point you're making money just to have a bigger number instead of bolstering your account's effectiveness
---
No. Who cares who Is first in a mmorpg?
---
I wouldn't hate a belt slot tbqh, but not an OP one like RS3.
---
As soon as you get into the league you need a wealth of knowledge to make decisions. Jump into the League blind not knowing anything about it, picked Prayer relic because who doesn't like those high level prayers. Find out that the Great Kourend is huge and there is no access to arrows/bolts outside of Konar.
---
I probably had 50 tabs open on the OSRS wiki working out where to go, what to do. Locking the League to a specific zone was a very odd choice imo, and being Ironman means your friends can't even help you. Would have been a great way to introduce group ironman.
---
Having other players intentionally die and the result of that is you get alchables and supplies is functionally identical to them donating you items with a physical or drop trade.
---
Most of those other gamemodes strictly enforce a participation system - verzik isn’t going to intentionally suicide to you.

The reason people complain about long death timers is that it makes everything safe and people can just bring their best gear to any boss without worrying about dying and risk losing it. If death timers were shorter, then we’d effectively have a gold sink, not to mention people wouldn’t be bringing their best gear all the time to PvM, which reduces profit/hour and also subsequently raises prices on BiS items (along with the items being lost on death). Obviously we can’t just reduce the death timers now because the servers still don’t have adequate DDoS protection so people could easily grief other players and make them lose items. Unsafe instance deaths are a step in the right direction as well as making players pay money to retrieve items on death. It still should feel more punishing though, but I don’t personally know of a good answer to it.
---
You actually aren't understanding what he's saying and that's why this is going in circles. 
---
All it is in-game time versus real life time. I don't know how that's particularly hard to understand? 
---
It isn't arbitrary at all, either. It's quantifying what you get in 1 hour of BH. Including time not spent doing BH is counterproductive, because now you're not counting strictly time spent doing BH. You're counting time spent doing not-bh, which has 0 relevancy on what BH itself can give you.
---
Birdhouses are a good example of this. You can't spend 1hr doing birdhouses in one go. However, in 1hr of doing birdhouses overall, you get X amount of xp per hr you spend on it. You tell me which one you'd rather see when you want to find out of birdhouses are worth it.
---
"I could make a bomb and blow up your house", even if it is true, would be a dumbfuck thing to say.

Combine that with your... Super fucking creepy fixation with women, and maybe consider being anything other than awful.

How is it incorrect? Weight reduction always existed and always offered a benefit in any task involving moving. Same as graceful.
---
I literally have memories of 2007 and 2008 where most people running around naked in just Boots of Lightness and Spottier cape. Why do you think people would stop using the best option if the current best was simply changed?

...I’m poor but have that
---
Yeah, it's a bit of a downgrade. You could easily miss your nests. As bad as it was beforehand when it went into your bank, I'd prefer that over this.
---
Runescape players hate risk. Not just the PvP community. There would be riots if Jagex implemented the old death mechanics.
---
Ah ur right, i didnt know they spoke spanish! Ty brotha
---
I’m just laughing at the inaccuracy of your depiction of me given a bit of text. It’s not a video or audio like this streamer is depicted in. I highly doubt I could appear as a 14 year old, but I’d take that age over my own, simpler times for sure. My point still stands, that method of steaming aka over reacting and vocalising is a huge hit with teenagers which often are the most common viewership given lack of commitments. Don’t sit there and pretend that they don’t play up to that audience which often makes it pretty unpalatable to people who don’t enjoy such childish behaviour and just want to watch and learn about the game. He also did while knowingly being targeted by denial attacks, call out worlds to be targeted. This is actually pretty shady knowing what was happening and choosing to let more of Jagex’s servers be downed. He should get banned for that IMO. People who have taken game worlds offline in other games have had punishment for it and he did knowingly get worlds knocked offline even if he wasn’t the one doing it. 
---
Maybe I’m wrong... but it seems like a majority on this subreddit don’t like his clearly overacted persona either.

 I am only bringing up this topi because with the Treasure Seeker perk, it's kind of low quality how you can't stack skilling clues unless you open them... Very low quality. And if bottles an geodes go to my inventory, why can't nests:P

I think the stuff we have in Canada is stronger. I met a guy that was from Amsterdam and he tried some of my weed and he said it was the strongest he ever smoked. It's just an anecdote, but I never met someone who tried both that said Amsterdam weed was stronger. I might be wrong though, this is just my personal experience

I don’t even play twisted league, I just get confused when my buddies have an iron tag next to their name all of a sudden

Lol like anyone thinks it’s “fun” to gather +50k of a single resource. It’s about the reward of doing the challenge and getting your account as far as you can go. The person you replied to said they do go and collect all the materials and resources themselves, why are you bitching so much? I don’t think the person you replied to was crying, but even if he was, you are crying more than he is.

It's just that rs3 has QOL changes, and then a million billion augmentation added on it. Jujus, outfits, elite outfits etc etc. Osrs is really good at making you work to obtain your levels.

How is it not forced lol it's literally already an item in game that you're trying to force in as a tradeable lol

There's no need if there's not any leak of his information, it's cropped to be just a wall of text

That's just not true

Any time I go to the he i have a nice conversation, usually about new updates.

Especially if you have a "home world" you start to recognize people and they recognize you.

Yeah it’s on the vanilla client, and idk, just wanted to ask the question because of hearing people get banned for one clicking NPCs and shit! Ty tho man

I just ment add an NPC that will convert an item into a cosmetic over-ride, so you actually have to destroy the item. And maybe pay a fee tovapply it to any items.
---
What you just said is basically “I want the end result but I don’t like the journey at all”
---
Just to clarify Im not trying to flame anyone but why play iron for accomplishment if people find any way to make it easier, having said that what I just said applies to a normal account, grinding is a pain in the ass but when you get where/what you’re working toward it’s worth it, but I just can’t grasp someone wanting to play a restricted game mode but use any exploit they can
---
Woosh
---
Its not forcing some random item in to the game with no purpose. It exists and theres no reason for it not to be tradable anymore expect to not make it discontinued. Just an idea
---
Go in and do 30 minutes of each and test it lol
---
I got 1 clue ranger boots and power ammy. Never thought I'd be sad to see rangers

Youd have very boring endgame bosses.

Your ironman could have just been a second normal account that followed those rules, since you want those rules to apply to your ironman.

It’s cool, the only place I’m doing inferno is in my dreams too
---
Get the task naturally without picking one.

Considering it's possible for UIM and HCIM to switch to regular ironman...

Couldn't you make a new ironman mode with a different icon and then just switch all the Twisted accounts.

If you're doing raids and dying so often you end with 207 points, I believe your life has indeed reached the lowest point possible.

Yoooo
---
Stop the fucking presses, wont somebody think of the god damn integrity of this game?
---
within a certain range of each other.
---
Id like a kandarin league
---
Think about it, it ends around castle wars and yanile, goes ovee to prif and zul-andra. The north edge would be the bridge to fremmy and the rocks to the light house. And the white wolf mountain and pisc fishing would be the edges
---
Youd have demonics, zulrah, smoke devil, nieve, barb agility course, seers agility, ardy agility, tower of life, kraken
---
There could be reqs to get into priff too so you could have gauntlet and zulcano
---
Either way I don't think Jagex will change anything about this update anytime soon so I might as well abuse it while it's still here
---
Man she is so sad about having to keep playing haha
---
Continuing that logic, we might as well just remove the no-trading limitation on Ironmen accounts, and just let the people who want to play without trading, do so to their own free will. *bEcAuSe tHaT mAkEs pErFeCt sEnSe*
---
Holy shit this is great lol

tldr making talismans at rc altars for afk training, worse xp than rune making itself. Ability to craft magical robes using silk, imbued for runecraft xp and tailored for crafting (baby and bathwater re: warding)
---
Also some new gear.
---
Lolzz
---
IDK if this is particularly aimed at me, but I also complained about this in general before the ironman update...
---
Lol, it's a little late for integrity updates IMO there's plenty of exploits, like BH 2, Zulrah, Vorkath and others that will never receive reasonable integrity changes because the devs only listen to Reddit.
---
Reddit wants to change everything that makes OSRS, an Oldschool mmo.
---
RWT is always going to exist so long as trading exists.
---
Hato is guy who faked old solo chambers world record. Hai yo = op of this post, phoneman is his friend. Basically hai yo mad cuz hato faked the record (also worth noting Hai holds current actual solo wr atm) and physically threatened him. Lots of drama followed and led to an admin of wdr stepping down and a mod leaving because Hai wasnt banned because of his behavior (because hes friends with most of the other staff).
---
But I wanna float when I equip the robes

Right. So then you would know people would still utilise weight reduction. Good job ignoring the rest of my point just to act offended.

2.3M/hr at 90 range is awful though, which is my point. With things like zulrah, hydra and vorkath shitting out money for very little effort, you'd be insane to waste upwards of 13 hours at basilisks for a jaw that is worth a fraction of what you make elsewhere. 
---
All I'm saying is demand will far far far outnumber the supply because almost nobody wants to kill them.
---
Do you have any proof ironmen voted no? 
---
Also if you’re happy game integrity is damaged it sounds like voting against everything you want is in the community’s interest.
---
Please tell me this is OC

yall forget it's possible to die, get skipped, get a shit bh task, take multiple fights to kill your target, run out of time killing your target, so on.

point is, kills aren't guaranteed and not just a matter of showing up every 20 minutes. you might take longer than 20 mins to complete your task and thus completely waste one round. and thus this makes using estimated/calculated figures like this artificially bloated and just not a genuine representation of the real experience. not to even mention kill difficulty wildly differs at every combat bracket.
