Can onyx and chaos runes be removed from the zalcano drop table as they're drastically being reduced in price
---
---
---
It said "database dump", no real clue what that was. But, I still have no idea how I got railed like that.
---
Erect if correct
---
By trying to flex with achievement diaries, you flexed so hard that this is beyond science.
---
It's not quite the same type of bottleneck though.  Lockpicks were only available from implings, which aren't considered "area content" imo, and Jagex has stated specifically implings should not be the only source of a content locking item.  A lockpick is required for several tasks, pisc favour, and the K&amp;K diary, so quite a lot of content.
---

---
WT being a softlock for limestone sucks, but I don't think it's reasonable to add more limestone just because of that.  It's not locking content.  Jagex has even noted that dark alter devotion is a soft lock for the miniquest to gather 100 dbones (grubby chests being the only alternative to dimps), and that's more content than a limestone alter.
---
What is the bounty for finding a lucky impling regardless.
---
lol this ref to greentext always cracks me up
---
the answer to your question is in the screenshot
---
what was ur setup? i wanna do this on my iron and i’m similar stats.
---
Make it consume the sigil similar to the avernic defender. That way the 5% damage boost is actually reasonable
---
I don't ever want game modes, especially time limited ones, to offer rewards to a main game character. DMM didn't and never should have. Same goes with KotS and Leagues. It's just not good design to suggest you play another game to earn cosmetics in this game. It's a bad path to follow.
---
Now earning rewards in those modes that carry across.. that is cool and good design.
---
It's like saying you should get ironman armour for your main by playing an ironman. Why? Just get stuff to earn on the ironman to show off.
---
Weapon still the most viable choice 10 years later.  PvP is the most stagnant part of the game.
---
This man has the right idea
---
How do we know for sure its not a super midget
---
This one is more creative in my eyes. I like this one
---
What about a grind in the main game that took 50-100 hours and offered 0 other progression than a cosmetic? Is it purely the fact that it’s not in the “main game” that you find so offensive?
---
Imagine
---
Molesto is infinitely better
---
That’s what I mean, that’s why I get super confused haha :) realises I worded it poorly and probably sounded like a knob

There is 3+ venezuelans in every world doing zalcano if you want to see what an actual goldfarmer look like ingame. Same with black chins &amp; rev caves..

These ''eel farmers'' are not goldfarmers.

RoT does 2k worlds, only protection worth using. You need a vouch to get in though.

I got a free rune pickax head so I liked the mechanic

There's no reason it wouldn't roll since other tertiary things roll, like clues and brimstone keys. It might not be following you when you tele into your house, but if you call it then it'll show up.

Anyone else dcing constantly?

This is the kind of activism we need

Just binged all 4 episodes in a day. Was worth it.

No one is saying this.
---
This is the second master he has done. It has identical rates as the main game. He could have easily earned 2 masters in main game in the time he's played TL. And he has exactly the same lucky chance to roll a 500m drop. That's what the F is.
---
You're taking it too literal and thinking people are saying the modes are identical and this would have been a main game 3rd age roll in 2 clues. No.. but it could have. And unfortunately he got that luck here. Where in a month and a bit it will mean nothing

It's not quite equivalent to 5% extra herbs actually. In practice the increase turns out to be less than half of that.

---
If it really doesn't matter that much, them why are you so against people getting it at a certain high kill count?  It makes the game more enjoyable for some, how does it negatively affect you?
---
Clearly a Tim Allen biker boy shat
---
100% my favorite part of Runescape back then that doesn't exist anymore was whenever someone died, and everybody in the vicinity dogpiled on that tile spamclicking for drops
---
zmi. if u trade someone thats far away you will have small afk periods as you won’t get stuck on anything like when you follow. it’s pretty chill

Kind of surprised he would leave his private chat on. No one wants bots and randoms spamming them

Think I just saw you at the GE haha. Gz

These arnt bots, those are all my lev 2 runecrafting accounts.

That's a bit of bummer.

“Login into RuneScape through emails” that’s a possible easy way to get phished. Check your emails, hover over the hyperlinks to reveal the real adresss it’ll look like runescape.com. But it’s e.g really runescape.com.jdubdu.com/loginservices.

I claim my staves everyday, so I get a pretty good idea at my daily. I go till I can’t handle it anymore haha.

To anyone asking about servers, blame Odablock

This isn't meant to put OP down, or to shit on his achievement, but is it really still 1%?
---
It would be cool to know how many capes there are in the game, and of course it would be skewed by alts and people going for the pet/speedruns, but a total number of capes would be great.
---
We're coming up to the end of the year, maybe Jagex will do another data streamer.
---
Yea but it's quite a lot of money you could spend better upgrades, torso and bcp are the same, torso is just free
---
Complains about downvotes (lol), then downvotes proof that the person in question isn’t actually downvoting at all (lol).

Damn you get alot of pussy
---
i actually believe its the truth, but in their eyes they created the acc 15 years ago and just decided to play when mobile came out therefore having 14 years of nothing, it is indeed a karma farm.

Took a break for a while but going to get members again tomorrow. [These are my current stats ](https://m.imgur.com/a/c6v9aRm), also have RFD done and a good amount of quests/diaries complete. 
---
Played exclusively on mobile so far but have a laptop now so I'll be getting Torso and Fire Cape soon but wanted to know what you guys think some good medium and long term goals should be? Quest Cape is one I was working towards. I mostly enjoy making money, like really AFK stuff I can just chill and do while watching TV and also Slayer. Any ideas?
---
I actively played RS from 2003 (starting a month or two before rs2) to 2008 and only ever got base 60s, with 75 being my highest skills (HP and Hunter). My current OSRS account was started in 2014 or 2015 and I'm coming up on base 80s with my highest being 90HP. It's not really that weird if you play games other than rs.
---
They just play their original account from 15 years ago, little 5 year old timmy sucks ass and cant get a 99, but 20 year old timmy can get himself a cooking cape. Thus 15 years and first 99. Its nothing but a karma farm when they put that in the title, but then again, this is reddit, the entire point of the website.
---
That really only happens if you go to the ge
---
They are far from beautiful and don't ask me to stop trying to have something changed when that something is the sole reason I don't play anymore. I'll continue suggesting a revamp of the graphics until the game dies or I simply forget it exists.
---
No that is not what would kill OSRS. Read my entire suggestion first of all. I suggested a toggleable graphic update, which would mean you snowflakes can continue sitting on your old outdated graphics so your shitty toasters can continue to run the game. Plus the reason of a poll is to see what the majority would want, hence the poll.
---
With obby settup u can afk for 20 minutes
---
i honestly dont understand why jagex doesnt patch pvp weapons weakly like every other game does etc league of legends. like nerf ags 25%  buff dragon mace by 30%.  
---
next week, nerf gmaul by 30% buff ags by 25% buff d long by 10% nerf d mace by 10% or w/e
---
No, they're not supposed to be "hard as fuck" to get.  If they were meant to be hard as fuck to get, they'd be locked behind some kind of challenge that takes serious skill to obtain.  Maybe something like the inferno.  The inferno cape is hard as fuck to get.  Pets are not.
---
Pets are just time consuming to get.  That's it.  Slap trees like you're minecraft Steve for long enough and you'll get one, is that "hard as fuck" to you?  Kill Vorkath enough times and the game will randomly decide to hand you a pet.  Is that "hard as fuck" compared to killing Vorkath once?  No, it's the same difficulty, it's just more time spent at that same difficulty.
---
And again, for the MILLIONTH FUCKING TIME BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT THROUGH YOUR MIND, I'm not saying that you should get a pet after 1kc or 5kc or 100kc.  I'm saying that there should be a limit.  You can literally keep your current drop rates.  If the drop rate is 1/5k kills (which is fucking ridiculous but whatever, I'm not advocating against that), that's fine, it can stay that way.  But what I am saying is that if you double that number, or triple, or even quadrouple, that effort should be rewarded.  Players shouldn't feel like they wasted entire days worth of effort trying to obtain something that randomness has decided isn't going to be theirs.  They should at the very least have some amount of measurable progression towards their goal.  Getting to 5k kc has no increase in drop rate compared to your first kill.  Getting to 10k has no increase in drop rate.  You could grind away your entire life and never get it.  Why?  What is the downside to giving a sense of progression?  What is possibly bad about letting players who are dedicated to collecting pets have some amount of confidence that their goal is not only possible, but guaranteed as long as they put in the massive amount of effort that I know for a fact that you wouldn't be bothered to do yourself.  What is the downside?  Do you think that it's just not deserved at 10k kc?  It's not deserved at 20k?  Do you believe that only randomness gets to decide who is worthy and who isn't?  Is the lucky 1kc pet guy more deserving than the 10k kc guy without it?  What do you possibly gain by being against a system that gives players more incentive to go for ultra rare cosmetics?  It still will take an insane amount of grind, it just becomes more of a potential reality to players instead of potentially not worth their time.
---
But apparently you're just dead set on saying "fuck you" to the people who actually DO make the effort in vain.  This kind of change would affect you in absolutely no negative possible way unless you somehow feel physical pain whenever other people are rewarded for their efforts.  We're not handing out participation trophies here, nobody is getting a trophy (pet) after 10kc unless the game randomly decides that they're the lucky 1/5k drop receiver... you know, kinda like how it is right now.  I'm just saying that the people who really dedicated themselves towards an incredibly time consuming goal should be rewarded instead of eventually giving up out of despair knowing that luck doesn't change from drop to drop.  It's something like that that eventually erodes a player's enjoyment of the game.  Why the fuck would any of us want that, whether it's for ourselves or for others who play the game?

Tbh I'm pretty sick of them by now though, given how utterly useless they are I'm kind of surprised there's no player-controlled option to turn them off for your account.  I understand them still being in the game because nostalgia and all, not a big deal either way, but I could do without the annoyance if given the choice.

How?  Since when do pets increase your DPS?  Show me the people with 10k kc on a boss who you feel have it too easy?  Explain to me how that massive milestone of kills is "too easy" and that it's pandering to the mobile crowd.
---
In fact, show me your 10k kc for any boss.  Prove it to me that YOU don't have it too easy.  Show me that you hold yourself to your own standards.

Technically thermy drops occult more frequently by kill count (1/350 compared to small ones which drop at 1/512), but you'll get an occult necklace a lot more quickly by killing regular smoke devils since you can barrage them and since they're weaker.

TO ALL RUNELITE PLAYERS
---
If you use RuneLite please read this post or the TL;DR at the bottom. We, as an OSRS community, need to shine light upon this. 
---
Timeline:
---
4 weeks ago:
---
Jagex and RuneLite came out with statements stating that RuneLite complied with ALL Jagex rules. This was nearing the end of the drama surrounding 3rd Party Clients. 
---
2 weeks ago:
---
I factory reset my computer. For those of you who don’t know what that is it’s basically like making your computer fresh out of the box again. Upon starting it up again I immediately downloaded RuneLite and started playing just like I have been.
---
1 Week Ago:
---
Got some motivation to do Wintertodt. I went there for about an hour and logged off. The next day I logged in and my account was banned. Jagex sent me a message stating this was due to “Macroing with Third-Party Software.” Thankfully it was only a temporary ban. I did not use any plug-ins or other types of software while I played on November 29th (the day of my ban). I did not use them that day or at any points in getting 2105 total level, 11 99’s, 126 CB, and even completing all the quests over the past 6 years. Yes, I like many of you have primarily used a third-party client to play Runescape over the past 6 years. Never had even an inkling of an issue regarding the rules for over half a decade. 
---
Today:
---
If I was to log in on RuneLite again my account would be permanently banned. This is a major issue because the Vanilla client is so beyond outdated it makes the game unplayable. Not is the Vanilla client dreadful compared RuneLite and even old OSbuddy but it’s taking away how I’ve come to know how to play Runescape. No longer can I check the stats of the players around me without navigating an external website and typing in exactly what someone’s name is. No more seeing my xp/hr to know if I’m playing efficiently or not. There are so many little things that the Vanilla client doesn’t offer it’s just incomprehensible how much important data is just lost. Worst of all this happened AFTER JAGEX AND RUNELITE MADE PUBLIC STATEMENTS CONFIRMING COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES. 
---
Please give this post visibility because we need to have an answer for what is allowed and what is not. So many people have been left in the dark because of Jagex’s lack of acknowledging real-time Customer Service as a MAJOR flaw in their business development. The only way problems are even acknowledged by Jagex is when people in the community upvote reddit threads like this. Please give an opportunity for light upon this subject. 
---
To Jagex and RuneLite:
---
First question:
---
What the actual fuck? Why are your public statements falsehoods? This an irrefutable fact proven by my temporary ban and countless others in this community.
---
Second Question to Jagex: 
---
Why are players being banned for utilizing Third party software when a user is using the software in a way that complies with your rules? 
---
Third Question to Jagex:
---
Why do you have to be so opaque with your operations? We are the people giving the opportunity for you to have a job and make content. We don’t deserve to be in the shadows regarding aspects of the game which effect over 80% of us. 80% is from a recent Jagex post stating this is ball parked percentage of players who use 3rd party software instead of the outdated Vanilla client. 
---
Fourth Question to Jagex:
---
When are you going to figure out that the vanilla client is not your money maker? There is no benefit you have by housing this client as the primary way to play OldSchool Runescape. You will lose your player base for banning third-party software, we know this is why you publicly stated RuneLite complies with the rules. 
---
TL;DR
---
Jagex and RuneLite statements regarding the compliance of RuneLite’s software to the Jagex rules is a lie. This is proven by bans of players after the statements were released. We need light upon this subject and the only way to do it is to read this post and upvote for visibility. Four questions at the bottom of the post.
---
But adding new even stronger weapons makes it even worse
---
you guys cant be pleased, im not surprised.  jagex creates new weapons/gear = power creep.  jagex doesnt create new gear "meh stale meta".  make up your fucking minds.
---
But lack of rewards isn't the cause, pking was popular when it had no rewards. It might be an actual fix to grant rewards, I only meant band aid as in a different fix from fixing the cause.
---
I'm just confused why that is the focus now if the problem is that pking is less fun. How do you make it more fun?
---
&gt;  You said that people earning their pets at obscenely high kc affects you as much as the blowpipe and twisted bow does. What's the correlation here?
---
You haven't earned anything for getting a RNG drop, giving them a guaranteed pet drop is EZScape.
---
&gt;You're the one saying that getting good RNG for one kill is what deserves the drop, not a bunch of kills. Because that's what the system is now. It doesn't matter if it's your first kill or your one millionth kill. The drop rate is exactly the same, and you have the same exact chance at the drop. You still have to get good RNG for one single kill, that one single kill with good RNG is just chosen at random.
---
Nope.
---
Don’t bot
---
Screenshot wanker
---
well if people were not constantly trying to find ways to break the game maybe we could enjoy it?  instead you had oda's worlds being ddos'd earlier, and it would be surprising if people were not still trying to dupe gold since the glitch/bug/etc still exists in the game.
---
Looks like there all over grown cats too, i just finished raising a cat of each color. So 6 plus a hell cat. 3 of them are over grown and the other 3 and the hell cat and are just regular cats making them overgrown now
---
Because in PvM, they also release new more difficult to kill enemies, but player survivability in PvP has been almost entirely unchanged. Meanwhile power creep in PvM can contribute power creep to PvP, but since survivability doesn't scale, PvP ends up getting compensatory nerfs to maintain balance
---
You can get assigned wilderness bosses so long as u have the slayer level to kill them/have the boss unlocked. 
---
Also- ergo means therefore, in the sentence u could use e.g. instead, which basically means for example.
---
You can't use the 0.1% as your argument here. They're by far the most high profile pvm clan in the game.
---
No, that's not what I said.  Nowhere did I ever say that I want the percent chance of getting a pet on kill changed.  You're interpreting it that way for some unknown reason because you're incapable of reading.  Point out where I said that and I'll give you gold.
---
I said that there should be bad luck protection.  Meaning that you'd have to get something like 10k+ kills to be guaranteed a pet, but at least you could grind away knowing that you'll be guaranteed the pet eventually.  I never said that a pet should be guaranteed at the kc equal to average drop rate, that's not what bad luck protection is about.  I never said that I want a higher drop rate.  I never said that pets should be easier to get.  Getting 10k kills on a boss is a huge time investment.  I only say that the time investment should at least have a guaranteed reward at a certain point when it's clear that you've done more than enough grinding for it.
---
&gt; &gt; Settled is the only channel I have my bell ticked on for
---
damn so not only do you lack the ability to take a normal fucking screenshot, you cant even make sure the fucking picture is posted in the right direction?  god damn people are getting lazy.
---
Gmaul being made less viable = fewer kills in fights = more cost in supplies. Also you need to risk 500k to have the same viability vs 40k. It directly benefits sweats while putting new pkers at a further disadvantage
---
since you cant comprehend what i was saying, im talking about gear progression in general.  just the other day pkers where on here bitching how "op" new staff spec was and it would destroy the wilderness.  MAKE UP YOUR MINDS.  I know what kind of gear is interesting in the wild, i did it a majority of rs3 and early osrs, cheap gear that does the job with minimal risk, most cases helm of netz, glory, blk dhide, maybe torag legs but in most cases rune, and a heraldic shield/crystal shield.  i mean shit you act like people would change the gear they use even if they had a huge selection, they wouldn't because people dont want to risk, they want to lose as little as possible.
---
Why does EVERY Skilling method need to be super lucraitve? Just like how the giant mole and Sarachnis aren't super high profit, neither either the things you mentioned. Similarly, just like how Vorkath and Zulrah are great profit, blast mine and high level runecrafting are too.
---
New staff spec isnt even released content fool. Quit ranting.
---
jagex has never provided evidence for macro bans.
---
yessss
---
no because jagex have specifically allowed iron men to do team raids
---
this is more like an iron man using an alt to scout the wilderness etc to stay safe - imo unacceptable behavior as far as the spirit of iron man is concerned.
---
_Servers bad_
---
yes
---
Did you just call Yoda an animal
---
Not sure if this is a good place to ask about League stuff, but hopefully someone can clarify the way the T5 relics work for me? Specifically Xeric's Wisdom - it says it's 2x exp, and that it stacks. So can anyone confirm - Is that 5x base exp + 2x = 7x exp on everything? Or is it base 5x exp TIMES TWO, so 10x exp? 
---
It SOUNDS like when they say "stacks" they mean "additive to existing", rather than "doubles the existing amount" but I want to be sure I understand correctly.
---
well, i am informing you that you were not banned for using runelite.  factory reset also doesnt remove any harmful shit that has made its way onto your pc, maybe it tripped jagex anti bot system.  There was a case where some worms were tripping blizzards system and people were getting banned from wow and or banned from steamed games as well from it.  you need to do more then just a factory reset, that is just a band aid fix to lazily remove bloatware and malware.
---
Correct.
---
Tldr. Nerd
---
Yeah I would enjoy that. It would be content ironmen can't access.
---
10x
---
This guy‘s car has been posted at least 3 times on now his sub lol
---
no shit its not released, they added the tournament worlds so people could try it out and people bitch and moaned about it.  the incentive to risk higher is to out survive your opponent and walk away with loot, until a change is made where teams can tag off solo people this is what you get.  dont bother responding back you are to dense to hold a argument.
---
It’s multiplicative, so 10x for most skills, up to 20x depending on your Tier 3 relic.
---
Burn it with fire!
---
Your the man bro!!!
---
Each multiplier is individual so it is multiplicative. The base x5, then a x2 for the Tier 3 relic, then x2 for the Tier 5. That gives you a Max possible multiplier of x20 for a set of skills.
---
I did not know that. Following up though, even if they don’t provide the exact “evidence” why would their reasoning be a generalist Macroing/Third-Party client?  If I was botting/using an auto clicker wouldn’t that be explicitly stated?
---
I’m not lying about any of this. I’ve literally never been banned before. At some point between 2010-2012 I remember being muted and seeing the exact chat log, so why wouldn’t this be the same?
---
$100 you don‘t even play ironman mode
---
This wasn’t it chief
---
After reading that was hoping you killed yourself tbh
---
&gt; why would their reasoning be a generalist Macroing/Third-Party client? 
---
it doesnt mention clients at all anywhere in that message, thats the copy paste message for macroing bans.
---
Thanks for the quick and thorough response!
---
Thanks!
---
Well it was a complete reset where I even had to reinstall Windows, does that change your perspective?

Amazing, thanks!

Nice friend

Tournament worlds are no reflection of pvp. Scrubs pal in tourney worlds. Majority of pvp happens in edge, where outlasting isn't an issue.

Bro, one time when gnome school was out for the summer me and my buddy were playing catch and I told him to go long. Threw that bastard all the way across stam'pot sink bridge I did. You should'a seen my buddy hotfoot it across the bridge like I've never seen in our combined professional gnomeball careers. 
---
Now we're both comfortably retired, gettin' high on ranarr and ordering out to Gianne's every night.

Is it a real tweet?

I was banned from OSRS because of malware. Feelsbadman

Yeah, that’s why i was confused with them

What tree are you shaking?

This one I like

If you're talking about the part I think you are, then yes. Once you get to the bit where the agility and tanking routes join, go west and south.
---
Personally I’d recommend looking at the guide on the wiki, or watching slayermusiq’s mm2 walkthrough. I used both resources when I did it and they helped a bunch. That quest is a bit of a pain if you’re doing it for the first time so visually seeing someone do it in a video may help you a bit
---
keep going down a certain path. if you fail, check if your chatbox has a message along the lines of "i have a feeling this isn't the right way...". If that's present, then the path was correct up until the point of failure. If not present, then it was just a RNG agility fail, so you try it again.
---
can i say it if i change my characters color to a darker one?
---
Thanks guys! I think I just need to continue down the path (which makes sense). Was just a bit confused as whether there is a defined end, as it seemed like there wasn’t - but I think that was just me! Also, I have 68 agility, so I was boosting with a summer pie, what’s everyone’s thoughts on tanking v agility? I’m 75 defence / 94HP / 70 prayer if that makes any difference for the tanking route?

It is the only thing relevant to my situation from this ban is use a third-party client. I have never botted.

There's an argument to be made for non-flicking bandos and metal dragons since he's an ironman and has to sacrifice prayer exp to make super antifires... yeah I'm reaching pretty far aren't I?  
---
Still a sick looking item tho.
---
I highly recommend you add an account auth to your email as well. Imo it’s your best defense at catching an “hacking” attempt early
---
the fuck is the point of all these ultimate locked region ironmen when the final gear is all the same when acquired through lucky imps?

Wtf is Zalcano

wouldn't it be == for the if statement, not =?

runelite is safe.

Credit card, why waste countless hours trying to maintain membership when you can work a fraction of an hour irl.

&gt; position your camera so you can click the altar right after you've teled to the island)
---
One click will only take you to the tree before the bridge though. It does take more than one to actually get to the altar. Still a bloody good method though (my preferred, got me to 65 rc so far, "only" 113k more astrals to go)

Hook, line, and sinker.

Do YOU have 10k kraken kills?

This! As soon as I seen these memes this is what I thought of!

He has a red skull from the karamja fight pits and is fighting a reanimated imp. It's not a revenant and it also isn't a skotos pet.

Why didn't they use shorts, fucking noobs
---
What place or state is he from?
---
Dang. And I thought 4 chains in 5k Thermy kc was a lot lol
---
&gt;For reference, I feel like my average kill melee is around 2 minutes.
---
ye so if this is actually the case, and you're getting 4 kill trips, that means each trip is 8:28 worth of kills (4x 2:07) and a minute of banking makes 9:28. that means if you just do that exactly the same every time you're getting like 6.33 trips/h and around 25 kills per hour. this should put you at exactly 3.5m/h revenue, you can subtract 6x the cost of your inventory and that's your profit per hour. 
---
i figure one of these is your issue:
---
1. your average is not actually 2 minutes, take some data. like actually write it down to figure this out. it's probs higher tbh, that's my guess with melee. or,
---
2. you're making way more money than you think you are, or
---
3. there's just a lot of downtime, which is very possible tbh. if you bank and get a drink, go pee, check reddit, and do this every trip....suddenly banking goes from 1 to 4 minutes and you're wasting half of every hour banking.
---
I never said you claimed to be him. I'm literally just saying to at least give credit where credit is due and comment that Rendi did not want to post the video himself. It's like citing your sources when you write an academic paper. If nothing else, it's just proper etiquette when posting someone else's work.
---
Doesnt jaggex have an email address you can report issues to?
---
No it doesn’t crash. I usually just keep all my pets in my bank now. I could put as many as possible into my POH and it loads just fine :P
---
Im pretty sure your math is quite a bit off here.
---
I met a girl off bumble who played. Our tism collided tho
---
great minds think alike
---
It's based off whatever your current tier is at the end of season, so technically whatever points you're at right now doesn't really matter, although I think it's a good way to keep track your progress and compare to other players.
---
When did it happen last?

Glassblowing is pretty cheap. Make unpowered orbs and sell them back

has science gone too far?

Wtf even is that lmao
---
What lvl are you on the uim?
---
2010scape when?
---
It wasn’t because they didn’t notice it’s because, crazy enough, issues often take time to deal with, especially unexpected ones.
---
nah Jagex doesn't do discontinued items anymore, it will be seasonal at best or available from some other content if they stop doing leagues. 
---
Even so, the time you spent to get those rewards wont be that great of value. All im saying is that you have to enjoy it aswell because if not then you might as well just do any medium-to-high moneymaker saving you time for more money.
---
I’ve been noticing lag across several servers the passed few days. Is it possibly related? Mostly 400 worlds
---
Yes got mine a couple of months ago at around 5k kc
---
It's not inefficient, it's not like you're only doing the grind for that single clue scroll...

looooooooooooooooooooooooooool

If you cant tick manipulate while watching anime you're not a real rs player

even when installing windows again viruses can remain on your mobo, hard drive...

that's what happens when literally 99% of games that come out today are cash grabbing, bug filled, MTX loaded shit
---
What happens in December? Don't get it
---
That's normal now with the "Players Online" back to pre-mobile numbers, and Twisted League
---
Sounds like a job for the anti cheating team instead of making content less enjoyable to the players imo.
---
There’s too much risk involved in doing something new unfortunately
---
could be. if you share a vpn with someone running a bot farm on that vpn yeah.
---
Then that's exactly what Jagex could communicate. Let people know its not an easy fix but that they are working on it for example.
---
Hmm... i mean i have harvester and 2x for 5th relic and ive been usually skilling trying to get to dragon but im always stuck between 1800-2000 for leauge points its really annoying lol
---
A nice shirt or a nice chair.

so many death runes

Crumbs osrs figurines.

Rendis "Blessed by the Chest" shirt.
---
It's also worth mentioning my post-99 stats which give a lot of points but don't increase my total level
---
Just because you got one early doesn’t mean you’re gonna go dry for 5k, your chance of getting another is still the exact same.
---
oh lmao thanks!
---
I agree. First, I just cannot 1t pray flick anymore, i gave up on it, my rhythm is going perfectly and then somehow the tick just isn't a tick anymore, becomes a second.
---
Lots of constant near DC experiences.
---
Woox walking is very risky too.
---
not worth it anymore.
---
That’s literally just a lie.
---
Well for me the reason was that old school released mobile first
---
I'm not talking about quantity limits dude, I'm talking about how GE prices will never change more than a certain % per day.
---
Do you have to have an Xbox Live subscription to play the multiplayer?
---
OSRS isn't really the type of game you sell to people, either they like it or they don't.
---
stop using dodo as your isp. 22ms here with a good isp
---
You're almost in your thirties and you're still like this?

Ok

A while back when eoc came out I did that lol, was interesting doing stuff in my own offline

Where's the petition?
---
I'm by no means no math guy but with my calculations i got 0.000003125% or 1 in 320000000, but as I said I can't do math.
---
Im pretty sure its not their servers. FFXIV has also been lagging all day and the spikes happen at the same time.
---
You have 25m rc right?  My rsn is enraged hoss if you have any pointers id appreciate it.  I screwed myseld with harvester before fishing so thats gonna suck to grind out agilty and fish....
---
"Dicerz" is a pretty chill cc. It is for a youtuber though, but no actual convo about the youtuber actually takes place. Some nice people in there.
---
(Its not a Dicing CC, its the guys last name and ign)
---
Yikes
---
Well none of those comparisons work because not everyone can afford a ps4,Xbox one and a 4K
---
DPS of the dwh doesn’t matter, only that it hits.
---
I'm 50m RC now, I don't think Harvester before fishing is a mistake (before Barb fishing maybe but it doesn't take that long to finish Barb Fishing). If you get Tench during Aerial it's a ton of points since you get 3 and can sell the tench for pearls to get the other tasks.
---
People be printin them yellow stacks, a tenner and a hundo in the billion region.
---
Oh your right i totally forgot about that.  Thats two birds one stone... i need to get back on that grind
---
He absolutely did. Jagex *had* a reason for censoring those posts and it was to not encourage others to try more. Once Rendi publicized it and revealed their methods (even if those methods specifically had been patched), it encouraged other players to try more.
---
No buyable xp/microtransactions. Rs3 completely changed the game to where its a shadow of its former self. Ive played consistently since 2005 and i can say, the way the eco, community, pvm,  and skills work in osrs is something that isnt found in any game to date. Most mmorpgs now a days are copy paste gameplay https://youtu.be/seMTO4g1USM 
---
Watch that video by lazy peon it explains it pretty well
---
cause it's literally Rendi's JOB to keep the game running right?
---
No it wouldn’t, the wiki states otherwise (or at least used to)
---
[ I can barley read that](https://i.imgur.com/Z6NP8zV.png)

He did fuck us, and it wasn't inadvertently. He knew what the consequences of releasing the details of the dupe were, but it was too juicy of a video for him to pass.
---
It is the rise of the Moletariat. They have started a Glorious Revolution to seize the moles of production!
---
Same happened to me at ice demon, I couldn’t dodge and just kept standing there blowpiping it while it threw snowballs at me. Tanked several hits, tried brewing and couldn’t do that either. Then I died to a shaman next room, said fuck it and logged off. Also lost 600k dying to Vork earlier, what a day.
---
Gl man. Hope you get it.
---
How many adult males migrating to a foreign country does it take to be labelled "invading?"
---
I don't get it.
---
Along with tanks, jets, infantries armed to the teeth, weaponized drones and other expensive military equipment? Hmmm, good question.
---
Last night I attempted the fire cape for the first time and mad it all the way to Jad and died instantly. I had plenty of supplies left. I've never had to switch prayers and I got very flustered and consequently died. I was wondering if there was any way to practice it as I don't want to spend an hour and a lot of supplies to keep dieing to Jad.
---
Any tips?
---
H
---
they have a support team too lol.
---
I saw that your post didn't get any upvotes.
---
Just so you know, I appreciate the time you put into the editing and I like the meme.

You have my upvote.

neither do i, but the point was more that murda beatz is successful while that guy is just a hatin ass goon

Osrs looks and feels better than RS3.

nah servers are fine for me, its your potato isp that needs fixing.

After having issues with RL earlier I started using mobile on my iPad, I can get on, but the lag spikes make it kinda pointless for me to be on.

Who decides if you deserve the pet or not?  If it were real life we're talking about, I'd agree, nobody is entitled to anything.  But this is a *video game*.  It's not real life.  We can change the way things work.  Why *shouldn't* someone like OP have the pet yet?  You've only said that he shouldn't because currently the game isn't programmed like that.  What if it was though?
---
You've essentially only said that a system like this shouldn't be implemented because it hasn't been implemented yet (in osrs, specifically.  It's been implemented in plenty of games already though).  That's not a reason.  That's just resisting change for the sake of resisting change.
---
Take a step back and ask yourself what would the game be like if people got a guaranteed pet at let's say 3x the average drop rate of the pet.  What would be different compared to what you experience now?  Think about that.  Do you really think that someone with this many kills having a guaranteed pet actually makes any difference in the game as a whole at all?  Do you think it would make them happier to have the pet?  Who benefits?  Is anyone negatively impacted?  What are the pros and cons?  You didn't think about anything like this, did you?  That's why you're not a designer.
---
Think about it.  Ask yourself those questions and think it over objectively.
---
Definitely bought.

bro i dc'd at hydra 5x and just needed 1 more kill to finish the trip...was worried i was going to run out of stone boots
---
So which part of that isn't a stylistic choice?
---
you mean censored the problem while it's still a thing people can do? They stopped the servers from being crashed that way, that doesn't mean the problem isn't still there.
---
Posting on reddit = inviting anyone and everyone to share their opinion with you. 
---
If you think what I said is too harsh you need some serious perspective. Get a grip dude.
---
Some people get midnight cravings and you get the craving to molest. No judgement here
---
Jagex has systems monitoring the services and the different services running on them. They know when there is an issue and they know about the issue before you do.
---
Imagine telling a depressed person to get a grip
---
You cannot just push "make server good again" button??? I thought that they fix servers that way?????
---
Why use obby over whip/bandos/tort?
---
Lmao my ass off
---
So you have proof the lag was caused by people trying to crash servers to recreate the patched bug? I’d love to see it.
---
They can still buy from NPCs
---
People with low RC levels?
---
Imagine thinking you're entitled to special treatment because you have depression (coming from someone with clinically diagnosed depression btw)
---
Reading the Q&amp;A post is very different then reading the sub to monitor the health of their servers. Reread the guys post again.
---
Kind of annoying to set up but it usually works better if you just get the drop
---
Upvotes don't fix the servers anyways lmao. You're assuming that the reason Jagex didn't notice the situation last time was because a reddit post was not upvoted. wat.
---
Get a grip
---
Reread his post. Jagex doesn’t use the sub to monitor the health of their servers. That doesn’t mean they don’t read the sub and might come across a bug that they haven’t come across in testing.
---
Can this be a actual boss please? Forget the nightmare
---
Thanks for the advice! Which stats do you recommend getting up by 8 to 10? Assuming you mean combats?
---
Make free twitch p20 accs to boost bonze tier list so drafon reqs are lowered :)
---
I miss him. He was our savior. ):
---
Is it really hard to believe that Jagex could let something like this go unnoticed? I mean, look at all of the other shit they ignore/don't know about/etc because of ONE person not doing their job. People don't get their contest prizes for YEARS because one person doesn't do their job. They have literally no customer support. I don't think it's a far fetched idea that they'd just not realize something was wrong, or maybe a mod would just say, "Eh, someone else will fix it" even if they do notice something. I've never come across a company that slacks off more than Jagex.
---
Kind of, but i'd like a more distinct proselyte armour variant. White armour is just more bs, there's already WAY too many cosmetic clue rewards, proselyte is actually useful.
---
I'm going to alch my 3a for archies birthday
---
And I mean specifically Bronze trimmed, iron trimmed , steel and mithril trim. They r already unnecessary imo
---
You jest, but isn't that what they do on a daily basis? No contest prizes sent out, zero customer support, the occasional false ban, etc.
---
How much gold did you make

At least you didn't get moles by a mole
---
I had the same problem, i logged out and switched to another world and after that i got all the defenders pretty fast.

Being honest though, the people working on it may be fearful of not vocalizing the situation correctly and having to face down the sheer brute force of our collective weaponized autism. I'd probably wait for an adult too, tbf.

You could buy a pound of methamphetamine, heard they're similar in addiction levels.

This must be the one we went on a field trip to in 6th grade since I live in NC
---
Thats damn solid tbh...
---
Somebody must have baked the potatoe running the server.
---
Other people are real. They are trying to do what they think is best. Stop making yourself feel bad about their actions. If you no longer want to be a part of something, offer constructive criticism and leave the situation. Stop tearing people down to supplant your own thoughts or feelings about other people.
---
They’ve said it but they also say the community decides. It can’t be both ways.

Idk who this is?

---
Yes, there are going to be a ton of ways to crash any server. Maybe some will be from influencing the server from in game, maybe some will be from out of the game. But yes, there are tons and tons of ways to crash any kind of software. It's only a matter of time until another method is devised

Same for you :)
---
The narrative last time  was that because 2.5 of the days were on the weekend that jagex either hadn't seen it yet or was unable to work on it due to not being at the office.
---
&gt;But lack of rewards isn't the cause, pking was popular when it had no rewards.
---
Back in classic we pked because we just wanted to kill people in game and loot their gear on them, adding in rewards for doing so is exactly as you state it, a band aid fix. There was no issue in over 15 ish years with pvp until people started having this greed-centric ideology that they should make bills from pking.

This is very sad news, but thank you!

It sounds like you're defining a "PVMer" as somebody who's in one of these clans or accounts main focus is PVM. In that case, these clans make up a tiny majority of OSRS so next to nobody is a "PVMer"
---
Probably more it’s already dropped 1m
---
Congrats, dude!
---
No they would find out literally the instant servers were reaching capacity and their load balancer can't spin up any more instances.

Because they took 4 days to fix it doesn't mean they weren't doing anything lol.

The engine is the game

But nobody will really be able to tell you how much or if it will go back up if the new mace is 500m and nobody can get it.

I was told that we will no longer be able to get beginner clue scrolls in f2p while by skilling but i cant find any information about that. Can anyone confirm?

Hard to say as we don't know the drop rate or the difficulty of the new boss. Safe to say though it will become a fair bit cheaper, so you might want to hold off on purchasing one.

probably shadowbanned from buying gold. It has been revealed by mod mattk that mod wealth once planned to add a similar system. it was turned down at the time, but he suspected, or atleast said it was very likely it could have been added at a later time.
---
omg \*facepalm
---
Some storage interfaces like in Chambers of Xeric and the Seed Vault feel differently to the bank when withdrawing items. It seems like taking multiple items out on the same tick isn't possible the same way it is in the bank. Can these storage systems be changed to feel more like banking when depositing and withdrawing items?
---
Yes
---
I know what I'm doing this week.
---
Oh awesome is there a guide for ranged somewhere please?
---
This mean has peaked
---
*Rendi should.  He basically put a infinite gp bounty on crashing any server.
---
What?
---
Nice. keep up the nice chill gaming!
---
This is the best ive seen so far lol
---
alchemolecal hydra
---
Agree that Duradaddy probably is best (ive gotten the task 3 times from him so far, and I don't slay nearly as much as most). I personally don't think its worth extending, as the kills take so long as is. A standard 130ish basilisk task can easily take a couple hours. I usually will do the knights until I run outta supplies, then do regular basilisks for a bit before banking to make it go faster
---
It's so cute!!!!
---
What if it crashed because someone was trying another dupe glitch?
---
did I fuck up? I made an ironman last night and figured I'd mess around a little around lumby which led me to getting like 10 combat and increasing my hp. does this affect me when I go to winterhold camp? would it be better to leave it at 10hp?
---
Afaik you get about 60 kills/hours when maxed. You will be spending more on supplies than you get in loot -- if you don't get the jaw that is -- but let's just assume you are going break even. With a droprate of 1/1k on task, that means you will see a jaw on average once every 16.66 hours. At the current price of about 32m, that puts you at slightly under 2m/hour. That means that if you do hit the drop rate, they are a decent task, but not amazing. There's better money and xp to be made in slayer, so I would recommend not unlocking them.
---
I will upvote this despite not having any issues of my own.

How do you obtain 40 cats?

holy moley so many mole post. i dont know whats going on

Agreed. They're low effort posts for karma. It's not funny in the slightest.

Haha what. How do you work in IT and not know issues can be getting worked on without a community response...?
---
Ok Boomer

Against most dragons you need 2 levels of dragonfire protection. You can get 1 level of protection from a dfs or anti dragon shield, protect from magic or an antifire potion. Super-antifire potion give 2 levels of protection.
---
For vorkath you need 3 levels of dragonfire protection. You could use a dfs, antifire potion and protect from magic, but using super-antifire antifire and protect from magic allows you to use a defender, which will increase your damage (and therefore your profit per hour) by a good amount.

Shrek should have obby cape and donkey should have pure gear or something.

Arnt rune items sitting at high alch price? So this would increase rune ore value.

It’s pretty difficult to earn enough for a bond over 14 days as a newish account. I would recommend that you just buy an actual membership for a short time, until you have the skills to more easily afford a bond

Personally I think Jagex has a great game and a great team. Everybody on here loves the game so show them some love too!
---
Is there lmao, is it because the impling has RNG with the reward?  Or a hunter level requirement to effectively trade makes it okay?
---
Yeah that's about right. I did bloods the entire way from 77-99.
---
What’s wrong with everyone having access to loot in a group boss? DPS roles shouldn’t be the only players getting drops lol.
---
That’s the problem, I simply just can’t afford it. That’s why I was thinking of just skilling on a f2p account to make some money on the side, but I’m not sure how effective it would be
---
I believe that Dharok's is faster at 70-80+, but because of the attention it requires to keep hp at 1 it's not worth the 5-10k xp per hour bonus over max afk'age. From 90+ attack &amp; str I was gaining around 110k xp an hour, at which point I found it to be worth it.
---
Your usernames like you trying to roast ya self
---
Yeah it's really difficult to do on a newish account, and probably even more difficult to do f2p

Wouldn’t changing loot design for this boss as described not be balancing around Ironmen by intentionally barring them from getting loot?
---
Especially when raid loot works as it currently does? Kinda makes no sense to change that now and it’s hypocritical to think Ironmen shouldn’t get loot from a boss due to its design — yet say the game shouldn’t be designed with Ironmen in mind lol.

He takes “donations”.

I can’t speak for Mercedes but according to a car-guy coworker of mine, fancy companies like Porsche basically do mortgages for their cars.

They need basically the same info from you such as tax returns, past two+ years of income , etc.

Good fucking christ, what do you use? Dh or DHCB???

Sounds about right. I went with my dad when he was buying his car and it was basically the same process for a mortgage. Since the value of those cars are so high, they want to guarantee they'll be getting their interest payments.
---
Could herbiboar be added to Deranged archaeologist drop table with odds of receiving it increased to 1/7500 ? Currently deranged archaeologist is the only demi-boss without a unique drop. I think this would be a nice alternative to receiving pet without devaluating it and a nice way to break up the grind for it.

Get a bond and go kill something, you can literally make enough for another bond in a day. If you have the gp there is 0 reason to train on f2p with trash gear and xp rates.

Damage bonus with full obby plus beserker. And you just go with max absorption pots. Then u can use google chrome remote desktop and re pot up every 15 mins while still being able to use your phone and not draining its battery

HAHA!

Except all the good ones are high effort and I know it’s subjective but I think they’re funny.

It’s all fun and games until the Sandwich lady suddenly combos into her AGS and stacks you out while standing over your dead body saying “You think I clapped you just for fun??”
---
Moley yeloM
---
&gt; And yet that was the reason you don't want people with high kill counts to not have gotten the pet yet, even if they triple the average drop rate, even with tens of thousands of kills on a boss.
---
&gt; 
---
No, I do not want guaranteed drops "RNG" drops in the game.
---
If you want something as useless as a pet you should have to grind it out rather than the game giving it to you.

We should not cater to people with weak mentalities.

Yeah seems so. Cabt change the subreddit so I'm just gonna roll with it for now and if theres enough members, I'll post the end of the league a community for all leagues. Perhaps somebody else will have one created before then and we can all go there.

---
I’ll tell you what changed... just look up the most popular poking videos from the 07 era and before. 
---
Before 07, pkers like purple, elvemage, bonesaw, etc., we’re big on deep wildly pking, DMing, and pking by picking on mostly noobs who had no business being in the wilderness anyway.
---
Kills took a minute or two, which usually was due to the victim being unable to eat sharks fast enough to counter rapid magic short bow 20s, Ice Spells for 20s-30, and maybe a gmaul or DDS spec for good measure. Rune knives and other “unconventional” weapons were a rarity — but they were deadly on the right accounts.
---
It wasn’t like today, where people can stack you for max health immediately all the time. If you ever got stack for max health, it’s because somebody got an insanely lucky double gmaul spec following a big hit. It was just super rare, but there’s still a reason the g maul was the single best spec weapon for over a decade. 
---
PKing was NUTS the moment the AGS, Dark Bow, etc., were released. It took like a year after, but accounts like 99 range tanks with barrows or void were going at it against 99 str zerkers, and they were whipping out dark bows for 80+ damage specs, and it was the most incredible thing you’d ever seen. 126 mains were whipping out an AGS for 70+ specs, and I’ll be damned, all you wanted was to either make a range tank, or get enough money to afford the most expensive weapon in the game at the time — the AGS. You’d mostly find it on endgame players only — the way you only see TOB weapons on the wealthiest or most experienced of players. 
---
The truth is: Pking has changed so much, that most new players simply can’t catch up on the skill curve that allows the veteran players to... basically instakill them, where in the past, at least they had a chance. It was rare they’d die before they could react. Now, with combo eating, and faster overall reaction times, it’s the only way to kill most players.
---
Apparently cant use protect prayers because the beast drains your prayer instantly and disables the alter until you defeat him and offer 100 dragon bones for free (no xp)

Oh, thats all focus does.  I just realized I really hate WT so this is a slayer account from now on.

As much as I want to believe they do, I would not be surprised if they do not. I've seen larger, and arguably better, companies fail to setup alerts for this kind of outtage.

What would really help is if people stopped buying gold

I strongly agree with that sentiment; however I fucking love the mole so fucking much.

Can we store this in our Moal bags?

Just don't be using toxic trident as that actually eats into gp/h. I've done a lot of research and though salamander is basically free it still makes less profit than trident because it's so much slower.

Yeah you right I mean someone with good financials and credit can get a great rate. It’s just my anecdotal experience that many wealthy or ultra wealthy people I know buy with cash, I wonder if that skews the data. Also they tend to buy the g wagon lol

Obviously you will need protection prayer (mage IIRC) to make it easier, go kill some hill giants and colelct the ensouled heads. 37 prayer should take no time.

You could do cox. Its not that hard and a decent money maker. Also a lot of fun.

Then hopefully they'll communicate that to us.

Like I said no boss pets also yeah bloodhound is to op RC pet is still rare af

Venezuelan gold farmers aren’t the problem at Rev Caves. The problems are the PVP Clans holding down worlds and injecting the economy with a massive amount of gold. Don’t doubt that they’re selling gold too. Pablo with his dhide and msb (i) killing rev pyrefiends for 500k/hr and dying every other trip isn’t the problem.

Do I need to buy the whole master chief collection or can I just buy halo reach?

damn, i had a similar idea but i suck with photoshop. do a monk with a molehead lol
---
I think it has to do with the realm of possibility. Settled couldn’t do ToB with full karils, so he’s going to RCB because it’s making it possible. I don’t think he originally planned on going 99 hunter for the RCB. 
---
Verf might need/want more for the inferno, so he’s looking for more clue stuff
---
Jagex removed the wilderness to protect their cash flow as banks were threatening to not allow transactions towards their company. It was not to stop rwt or bots, it was to stop credit card fraud. Lets get that straight. 
---
Rs is too big, they cant track all the RWT. I bet theres at least 1 lopsided trade done per second. By the time they review it, 1000 more trades have been done.

---
For defense bonuses Torag's or Dharok's is the best. But I recommend looking into the Fremennik series and finishing Fremennikk isles. You get one of the best helmets in the game (Helm of Neitiznot).
---
It provides slightly worse defence stats but a good strength and prayer bonus which is very useful.
---
This is becoming more and more relevant.
---
Have you heard of the mining and smithign rework? Well, here it is.
---
It’s worth it and rewarding. Brings back a lot of motivation and nostalgia I once had when playing this back in 2008 era.

The reason to do it is an alternative to ardy knights and low level pyramid plunder.
---
It also has an achievement diary step. I did squ'irks from like 71-81 thieving because it was more fun to learn and master the 1-click summer than it was to just spam click ardy knights.
---
So, if you're looking for a reason to do it, do it because you want to get some thieving xp and it offers a different play style over ardy knights. If that's not enough incentive for you, maybe the minigame just isn't for you?

Just recently got 99 str farming Gargoyles. I planned on staying there to train my att and def to 99 as well. Unfortunately it feels like it takes me longer to get kills when using a whip and dragon defender. I was using a Bludgeon before so I am guessing that is why it feels worse now to get kills. 
---
Current Gear: Nezzy Helm, Fire Cape, Amulet of Torture, War Blessing, Bandos top/bottom, Ferocious Gloves, Prim Boots, Berserker Ring imbued, abyssal whip and dragon defender. 
---
Stats: 96 Att, 99 Str, 91 Def
---
Is there a better weapon/gear I could be using to train my attack and then defense at Gargoyles?
---
No reason to assume itd be a thing in my opinion

I was here on this blessed day

If you're looking for quest guides, Slayermusiq1 is the best in the business. [This is his MM2 guide for lower levels, ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykE5LbjABaI)and [this is his guide for higher levels.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDf5JtEho1c&amp;ab_channel=slayermusiq1) The great thing about Slayermusiq1 is that he doesn't edit out the slow or boring parts of the quest. Need to run halfway across the desert? Slayermusiq's right there with you. He's also generally very calm and friendly and willing to help people out in the comments section (if their question hasn't already been answered).
---
Good luck! Even with Slayermusiq's help, I'm incompetent enough that it took me ~20 tries to get through the maze. I hate that quest.
---
Riding trails on my bike
---
Terrible. Killing them at melee range means you stand the risk of getting hit by 30s from their melee attacks which are quite accurate even in defensive gear.
---
If you want to train melees while collecting bones for 99 prayer, then if you have 84 Slayer you should use a dragon hunter lance against drakes. They're better on task but very afkable off-task with a dfs and extended antifire potion.

Hey 🅱️eter here to explain the joke. Basically the title is a play on the word “small” but contains “mole” and is accompanied by a very small picture of the giant mole, and made funnier by the recent influx of mole related posts.

Tip: If you say "don't check my combat level, you get a bigger list to choose from".
---
If you play on weekends and peak times it's a good idea scout a task to see how crowded they are (Bloodvelds and Dust Devils), if you are worried about fighting over mobs. If you have treasure seeker look at what kind of clues they drop. 
---
IMO the best all around task is Lizardman Shaman because they have the best all around drop table and there are always places to do them because there is the task-only area and also the Lizardman Temple. They give both hard and elite clues, fangs and talismans for xerics teleport charges (better drop rate with diary), alchables, smithing supplies, they give task points for killing them, and can drop DWH which is decent even if you don't do raids.
---
If you play off-peak sulfur lizards are great. Fast task for getting slayer points for bigger unlocks, smithing supplies, medium clues.
---
Wyrms give decent drops as well and you have a chance of a dragon sword, which is a good upgrade to the rune scim before you get whip.
---
Also you can pick Red dragons which are good prayer xp if you unlock the Altar.
---

Fair enough lol. I don't even have time to play TL, so I can't even say much. Hell, I have a hard time finding motivation to play my hcim, or even my main.

I suppose if I started TL, I'd have to go:
---
- Dark Alter Devotion
---
- Arcane Courier
---
- Way of the Warrior
---
- Treasure Seeker
---
- Xeric's Wisdom

That just seems like a good balance of efficiency and relaxed fun to me.

Thats cause you play shitty "triple a" title games. Plenty of isometric rpgs that have entire worlds of lore. Just to name a few. Pillars of eternity 1 and 2. Pathfinder kingmaker (Youre looking at upwards of possibly 100 hours here). Divinity original sin 2. Wasteland 2.

So I've been Skilling thieving non stop and I'm starting to get really frustrated. I am pickpocketing master farmers. I am currently 67 thieving and getting roughly 48k xp / hour. The frustrating bit is it's down from roughly 54k xp / hour when I was level 63. It seems like every time I level my % chance of success plummets and slowly picks up as I progress through that level. I am going through food and dodgy necklaces more than before.
---
This happen to anyone else? Any insight? 
---
TLDR; My success rate is going down with each level
---
... what?
---
That is still no reason to leave your team. It's common decency; if you join a team, unless you clearly state otherwise beforehand, it is implied you will stay until the end.
---
In runelite, click Configuration (little tool icon) then search for Item in the search bar. Look for a plugin called Item Stats. Click on the switch next to this plugin to enable or disable the feature.
---
Yes, but what is the mole meme?

Completely understandable. You do you, dude. Just enjoy the game for what it is and let all of the efficiency Nazi's treat it like the job it isn't. 
---
I hope you don't feel like I was knocking you for your choice. I just get curious about things, especially people's choices, that I don't understand.
---
No explain molememe mole meme just happen
---
people think it’s funny idk
---
seems like a modern day “so random xD” joke
---
Mjöle
---
Remember the dharok meme? Or the dorito lava rune? Well... here we go again.
---
Alter the game rules behind the scenes (do not disclose to the community) to ban lopsided trades between accounts of non-English speakers. Or at the very least heavily monitor trades from these kinds of accounts. I don't mean non-native English speakers but people who are English illiterate.
---
Very few people in this demographic have any incentive to play OSRS for fun. On top of that it would be an understatement to say that server connection quality from their locations make the game even worse.
---
There is no rule against indiscriminate account interaction anymore, so trading wealth between accounts shouldn't raise many alarms. A nearly maxed main lending a Twisted bow to another nearly maxed main to boss with is not even remotely suspicious even though it's a 1bil wealth transfer. A Venezuelan who farms Zalcano for 20 hours and yeets all the profits onto another random account is suspect as fuck and should be easily tracked.
---
A shitty low stat account used by a Venezuelan has next to no legitimate reason to transfer all of their wealth to another Venezuelan using a shitty low stat account. Easy and guilt-free instant permanent IP ban.

This one was personally my favorite. I tried following guides with the maps of rotations on the side, or just trying one rotation (annoying af to restart). But this guide was the most helpful giving me the thematic background necessary to be like "huh feels like im on the wrong side right now, better move". Or "many I haven't seen mage zulrah in a while, better switch".
---
Best advice in the video:  "Whenever theres an open spot jagex is telling you to move to the other side"
---
Why is it that blessed d'hide all cost such different amounts?
---
Zamorak d'hide top goes for 730k at the minute, and ancient d'hide top  costs 250k, despite them giving the same bonuses (ignoring god wars)
---
Is it purely in the rarity? or is it just for the f a s h i o n s c a p e
---
Logical conclusion of this meme
---
I like to play kendama when I need a break from osrs, stretches the legs nicely
---
What's the droprate for 3rd age? How many sub 10 kc 3rd age post have you seen? How many people have done a about 10 kc on twisted league?

They aren't playing by the rules even slightly, otherwise grey market gold would be a lot more expensive right now.

You spelt gielinor wrong

It’s beautiful. Thank you for this lol

Chaos Elementmole, surely?
---
i try to avoid spots that can be cannoned, because someone plopping one down when there are already several people there is just a big "fuck you, this is mine now." it's like cutting in line, or someone grabbing your coffee after you ordered, just a disregard of other people. same with people who come to a "full" spot, where there's one person for every spawn. just take the time to hop to a world with free space! it's not that hard, lol. 
---
i personally wish the cannon didn't exist, but as more non-cannon spots come out, i guess it's fine.
---
First you complain about bots, then you want this to exist? Hahaha!
---
Just re-wipe the LMS high scores so all of you guys can re-do it all again without bots.  That'll revive LMS for sure!
---
You guys are pretty scum. Wanted bots gone to keep your rankings high. With it being dead content, you'll always be on top in the high scores. You had to take out the competition that was earning points at a rapid rate.
---
gold sinks haven't been necessary since the release of duel arena tax, however every day hundreds of pvm drops enter the game so it goes down in price
---
bursted out laughing. good job
---
Can I smell ur chair
---
Seems you haven't been there since last week? They've been gone  for a week now lmao
---
Sigh. Runelite is compliant. Full stop.
---
this exactly. ToB is still the number1 money maker in pvm even with low scyhte price. And soooo many people do CoX so every day hundreds of scrolls get added
---
Ohh I’m that in real life. I play and don’t even know.
---
get 55 magic and high alch for profit
---
that's what i did
---
Fml please reread post
---
What they should do is take suggestions from the community and the most popular one gets added instead of Jagex coming up with it.
---
That's not "the issue". Crystal math labs plugin only does things after logging out, and it won't cause you to log out
---
There was a overal different mentality on keeping a healthy economy. High end gear also gets devalued by sheer volume of them coming in too.

Why did my mole post not free hong Kong and get me Reddit platinum 😡😡

first I want to ask you if you used same login you used to get to the acc managment site you're showing in the pic? or did you assume that the registered email in the pic is now your new username?

It seems like the worlds are getting DDOSed, im still logged in but cant do anything

Cross country or backcountry? I do both. 😊

Lmao just rework RC that'd be enough of a new skill.

Yeah they have it for run. If you are walking and shift click i think it runs for you. Would be nice to have it work the opposite as well.
---
Downhill and back country, some water skiing too
---
This deserves more love! 😂
---
Got an insane delay on all my actions but still logged in.

---
I mean, unless you aren't equipping them, there isn't any real reason to drop by that much.  Neglecting to equip or not noticing them breaking would be the only thing that comes to mind aside from RNG and if you have the farmer trapped or not.
---
Though I would highly suggest blackjacking until mid-eighties, fail rate on master farmers/ardy knights is too high before them.
---
Tele-grab zammy wines and high alch at the same time for max pph
---
When you talk to it, it should give a witty dialogue referring to the seizure warnings.
---
The fact that they're being upvoted means people like them. Reddit isn't curated to your tastes, don't take it so seriously. Not everything is about karma, people are just having fun.
---
Is heart surgery guy ok???

\*cough\*  \*cough\*  Rendi

Shocker that someone on osrs would be mean and racist, very unlike players on this game to be like that
---
They make money while its going and the time to get more accounts available is relatively negligible.

This was years ago but I was muted for a couple years before I could appeal and get unmuted. Good luck lol
---
Taking a look at them now. At first glance they just look like regular skilling bots
---
I never noticed that happening doing 77-99 thieving on farmers. There is no mechanic that would cause you to fail more just after leveling you're just getting unlucky. I wouldn't thieve master farmer at your level it's terrible compared to other training options.

Because people in this community are stuck on the idea of forcing artificial competition between players because "IT'S A MUtLIPLayer GaMe bRo"
---
This game is not for you
---
regardless of being ironman or not, nobody likes being crashed but the people crashing.
---
Getting intermittent bouts of lags and delay (had one for 10 min, then 10 min without, then lagged again) so something is definitely going on.
---
No different than buying a 99.
---
Okay that's totally fair, there is 90%mole meme attempts. But the other 10% is all identical posts to this
---
Farming to 85 is a lot of easy points. FM to 50m is also another easy one.
---
Literally by playing Ironman mode you don't have to ever worry about the economy anymore. So go out there and make an iron and stop being concerned about gp. You get to play and enjoy the game without having to freak out anytime a big ticket item is tanking in price.
---
Yeah but its not a good idea to promote racism as a clan leader.
---
I want the constitution one lol. Please do link.
---
they're all using the spinning wheel to get 39 crafting(total level for ge) then going to the ge

You must be new to online gaming.

I would wear them if they dropped the logos or moved them to a shoulder stitch on one arm.

Personally, I love the colors and would wear something like this mountain biking or skating.

I haven’t played rs since 2014 but that Bluemoon Inn shirt they did last year was great because it looks like a normal crew neck and only my nerdy buds know what’s up.

No mole? Shoooo

nice attempt at merching

Have a similar item that keeps my bonds coming. Probably 5m/hr method

You don't run out of run energy with normal Bloods anyway.

---
The way you spelled confession tells me you had it coming
---
I see someone took a suggestion.
---
I'm 100% sure that you won't be able to do that. Group ironman is kinda like a regular account but there's only 1-3 other people in the game. You still can't trade untradeables
---
You can lease a c300 for around 300-400 usd a month... in America that’s totally affordable. My wife works for Mercedes, about 80% of new cars sold are leases
---
Hehe I know, I'm just here for the memes 😎

That examine text is the same for all the normal ores other than coal too, btw

What if there was a poll and everyone voted to reset the economy? Other than quest items and unreadables every item got deleted from everyone’s account? BOOM economy reset, problem solved

Still down peeps?
---
great guide, thank you quantm!
---
Good luck to you in recruiting people!
---
Just so you can kill them 12 hours and 1 minute in.
---
Ores, onyx, runes. Basically everything
---
Its really not.
---
I have noticed this issue on mobile as well. Not game breaking, just annoying.
---
Fair enough, was listening to it as you posted it so I was more excited at the weird coincidence haha.
---
Ok, can someone explain me this mole meme?
---
time still spent making them
---
Personally I picked the clue relic for two reasons, one so I could actually do clues (which has been a blast, slowly getting the gear I need for them. ) And two, so I could get gear appropriate to my level, so I can do the tasks assigned to me. Temple spiders in steel gear was a bit much.
---
This exactly happened to me, but I was on the selling side
---
jaja
---
Or even make them private instances. Who is going to have time to type while doing that, anyway? Why even have a partial attempt to make it a weird social thing?
---
no they dont
---
Ores are locked to high alch runes haven't dropped and onyx isn't even what I used to calculate my hour.
---
Thanks for the work you do to preserve the integrity of our game! Doesn’t get said enough.
---
I think if you were in the loop you would understand more. I’m not sure how I’m the bully in this case either. On his video, he openly denounced Jagex for issues that he causes (NDAs). I’m frustrated that so many hardcore have lost their status because of these people.
---
Lol. The goal is to help new players train thru/after the 12 hrs, until they're high leveled enough to defend themselves. We're really trying to bring new people in &amp; show them how much fun DMM can be. It's already fun even though so few people play. It would be even more fun if we could get a few hundred online
---
Also, is it spelt, not spelled? What’s the difference?
---
I thought he closed the MITB forums right before/after selling?
---
Aww poor baby
---
Looks like the head armor from the spooky outfit (Halloween 2019 event reward)

Ensouled Giants are 3.2k exp, I went from 39 to 43 in somewhere around ten or so heads. Way better than I ever would have guessed

And right as they see the fun, they die, gear taken and need to level again..
---
Again, good luck to you sir, but there is a reason very little people still play it.

You are denying my opinion towards you.  Not being accountable/honest for what i have to say. That is an abusive trait aswell. Im sure that you are glad, if you could control it yourself.. you would. Seeking therapy may help. You are entitled to your opinion. I wish you the best of choices. (:
---
Obviously they couldn't take the heat, that's why they're gone :)
---
Whats with all the mole memes.
---
Same

You really must be new here.

I'm confused as to why there are so many memes.

I only upvote ironmoles

On rs3 you can pay for lamps from keys and get every skill 99 without ever training a skill.

Wait, halo reach is chronologically the first game in the series? I've been waiting for halo 1 to come out to start the campaigns.
---
I've never played halo before lol
---
Honestly, bots don't affect my individual gameplay. I'm all for gold getting cheaper, although I don't purchase gold frequently enough that i would benefit from the economy's fall
---
Thanks! I missed the Halloween event this year so I didn’t recognize it.
---
Yeh this
---
Yes! If we’re getting technical then the order is as follows: Halo Wars, Halo Reach, Halo Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3 ODST, Halo 3, Halo 4, Halo 5 and Halo Wars 2. But of course the Wars nor Halo 5 is in the Master Chief Collection.
---
So true
---
No idea lol. They've been all over the show for the past 2 days
---
Man I miss lazypeon, shame he 'took the red pill'
---
This shit is getting out of hand

this happened to me about 5 days ago, literally had to sit and watch as a lizardman poisoned me to death lol
---
Disc golf.
---
Hey, you've missed the point! I'm not skipping anything other than the laborious grind to attain gp through methods of absolutely time wasting torture. 
---
I still skill and grind, just like you, however it's much more assessable to me because i already have the means to grind levels without grinding gold first.
---
For the record. 99 slayer still took me 6 months, on a 20 def pure, so i know how to grind.
---
Silly comment
---
i just figured it to be a problem with my phone though
---
Also want to know this
---
Ardy cloak, also look into getting the fire cape in a few levels (70 range). Personally I’d even wear cape of legends over obby cape, it’s like -2 defensive stats in comparison but is very cheap and looks less nooby imo.

---
Did mine when the rework for bounty hunter came out :3 gz btw!
---
You must have 99 agility cuz you just jumped to a massive conclusion
---
Thats gotta be one of the dumbest solutions I've ever seen being suggested here on reddit... just cause someone can't speak english they should be treated differently and have a target on their back? I get that venezuelans are big in the gold farming scene, but generalize that to anyone who can't speak english?
---
English isn't my first language, and I live in south america, does that mean that I should be treated as a goldfarmer? And have someone checking and monitoring every trade I make? That's fucking stupid
---
Probably would have been the one that spawned the superior that was going to give you imbued heart rip
---
That's what I've been thinking. We've seen memes like this get semi big but not to this extent.
---
You see the rune in my inventory don't you?
---
Oh no.... here comes the bloodveld dick pic nudes.
---
I know this is obvious, but just try to stay calm.  There is plenty of time for the flicks.  Just wait until you're positive which he is doing, and then use that prayer.  And make sure you have a plan worked out for the healers ahead of time.  I didn't realize they couldn't heal him to full health or they respawned, so that caused me to lose on my third attempt.  Next time I did it I used the 3rd wave to know where Jad would spawn and picked a spot where I could safespot him, and I pulled the healers quickly, ran around the side to safespot Jad, prayed melee, killed healers, and it was smooth sailing from there.  Once you've dealt with the healers, the prayer flicking isn't bad.   
---
You got this!
---
I had a F2P ironman too! Was pretty cool, discovered lots of things. But in the end it was such a grind haha. Why not make it member? With gp from main?
---
This'll fit perfectly in Moleallet.
---
Best one
---
When it happened to me I got a connection lost on my character then it said I have been disconnected.
---
Make it the same as a mage 2 cape... but you gotta kill 50 of the zam/guth/sara guys to get the *cosmic* book to attach it to the imbued cape
---
Nah. In like 4-5 days, a super high quality gif will be made of a mole meme that gets like 12 reddit golds  and you will upvote that one
---
Oh sir.... I’m so sorry
---
Is it possible to follow the flax and find the accounts that are buying the flax and (presumably) selling the bow string or getting traded the gold?  
---
Probably wouldn’t happen because you wouldn’t want to give away how you find them, but it would be really entertaining to watch a stream where a bot farm gets investigated and taken down.
---
I’d be down for whatever. And the Zamorak one could have red tear animations and the Guthrix ones could be green. Would be badass
---
Religious discrimination considering this man is a god. Won’t stand for this blasphemy.
---
I guess people will do anything to get some karma
---
Are you wearing rogues outfit in one and not in the other?

I’d quit.  Trying to solve boredom with a game that makes you feel bored (because it is a time waste) is a good indication that you are avoiding things that are important in life.
---
Holy moley, never expected to see anyone in a 20 mile radius randomly posting in here. I'm just outside of Lexington myself. Feel free to add me in-game: Rockingoth
---
Arcane is a terrible purchase unless you have literally everything else in the game. The difference it provides over mage's book is negligible pretty much 100% of the time.
---
Yeh so use it and stop complaining about your crystal pickaxe depleting if youve got an alternative right there
---
My experience with W6 Barb Assault is that everyone DID leave halfway through, which is why I never get torsos myself on accounts anymore. It sucks, but that's what happens when you play with randoms. Play with friends if you want people who will stick it out for you. Otherwise... No, randoms don't owe each other anything.
---
Yeah and then every player who keeps to themselves in game and don’t type much will be wrongfully banned
---
But this is indirectly about “moles” adding further mole post
---
Using Narwhal, preferences, advanced, content filters.

"holy shit I can't believe that actually worked" -scammer

Was you wearing a dragon full helm and third age aswell? :^)
---
Attack, Mining, Herbelore, THeiving, Prayer, Crafting, WC, RC, slayer, hunter, and quest point.   
---
All the ones I personally would wear. Now having none of those 99, I feel a bit cheating that if I were to buy them i'd be a "poser" but ehh lol
---
They don’t hate money - these probably just don’t have as wide of profit margins as MTX does!
---
I really don’t mole what’s going on right now, mole’d on a minute, I’ll try to get a’mole’d of someone who can help
---
Thanks dad

How?
---
3:1 is so much better than 1:0, and it will help you learn the timing for 4:1
---
Yes, and I’m glad to see the subreddit has diverse content to satisfy each person’s humour. And I love seeing positive reactions in the comments as the creator!
---
That molepamine rush
---
OP made two memes on the same subject.
---
Who dropped you on the wild to tilt you that much?
---
Funny, but this was literally the solution that worked for me.
---
nasty
---
did 70k dark mages infront of varrock
---
I learned solo cox with 1:0 maul into 3:1 tent whip into 4:1 tent whip into 4:1 lance (once I got lucky at hydra). It's perfectly reasonable dps and I recommend you do it. That being said, I recommend looking at using a non void setup because it will usually give 1-2 max hits over void setup on the melee hand. Also, it's worth noting that 3:1 is going to be a shitshow just because of the nature of the method, but don't let that discourage you. It's important to learn, and when you transition to 4:1 you'll be amazed how much better it is.

Hunter and quest ones looking dope

I do have the current password, but I don’t have the email or any info on my account.
---
I always used my username and password to log in. Never used my email, and now that email was deleted a few years back on gmail for not using it
---
Lmfao, jagex shouldn’t be censoring ANY posts on this subreddit, And it’s weird that you’re in full support of it
---
?
---
How did it to?
---
Your making such a statement by not playing. Good for you 😂
---
Just go to the runescape wiki
---
They are doing she shearer also
---
This is common, it's easy to spoof email headers
---
Agreed his “public service announcement” probably did more harm than good and just tried to create drama.
---
Glad you got perm muted, people like you are the cancer of the ge.
---
They are doing sheep cheater also
---
i'd say molehill

There are rs3 lore pages on their wiki, but a lot of it isn't applicable to osrs.

I found this youtube audiobook playlist in an older reddit thread tho, for osrs lore.

im diggin it

Getting back into things after 9 years of not playing, and man is it unfortunate that all of the stats carried over to RS3 but not OSRS.
---
You can recover your account to reset the authenticator. You may also want to switch to an app with a backup option.

Somewhere around 60 to 70 hours depending on rng, how crowded locations are, and willingness to do methods like 3ting. Getting a pet would shave around 5 to 10 hours off.
---
Hey man, I'm just trying to play the guy i made the last time i played. If other people enjoy it good on them.
---
How do I recover my account with no information on, when it was made, early passwords, or any of the other bullshit they want at account recovery
---
Thats why they are blocked. High weighted tasks i dont want to do or have to skip every 3rd task.  Maybe im just misunderstanding your reasoning.
---
Im sorry you feel that way, have a wonderful day.
---
It’s just today’s trend. It’ll probably die out soon, but some still stick around or get mentioned from time to time. Kinda like the stamina potion bridge
---
Not a mole meme sorry can’t upvote.

Houses technically are depreciating assets, yes sometimes houses go up in value depending on the market but we all know volatile real estate can be. When it comes to the car loan, the easy answer is stocks, bonds, invest into a company or small business, maybe high yield savings accounts if the rates are right,  etc. I sold and financed cars for years , and through working behind the scenes and dealing with a lot of wealthy customers that's basically where I got this info from
---
You're probably the only mentally ill person here, friend. Get help.
---
Idk but we pked a sotd cuz of it L00000l
---
Has this sub just turned into a load of ‘edgy’ teens who think moles memes are funny?
---
I thought yesterday was groundhog day.
---
And a spade I suppose :D gzä
---
But it’s a wildy step so I gotta
---
I got an email about their store being updated and hoped to see these but saw some hot garbage instead. Oh well my moneys safe for now
---
Yes it's not like several thousand people pay them 20$ a month for this sort of thing.
---
I've been looking for someone to play with too but most content in osrs is solo isn't it?
---
I honestly forgot that I used to do all my skilling with friends. I do everything solo now too, friendslist is full but never talk to anyone. How sad.
---
I’ll take a jar. Still need one from the collection log lol
---
i'm beaming. just smashed baby yoda into a green paste with a gmaul spec. you?

This subreddit is one of the largest RS communities out there. Things that are discussed here have a direct impact on what happens in this game (for better or for worse). It has enough influence that Jagex posts here as an official line of communication, and it has enough influence that if the top post says "the economy is crashing!!! gp means nothing!!!" people here are dumb enough to believe that without looking any further. Just look at how Rendi's video was received right at the start: people were praising him for "saving" the economy, calling him RuneScape's savior, and it took longer for people to realize "shit maybe we shouldn't have instructions on how to abuse a potentially game ruining bug, *a bug that hasn't been fully fixed*, right here on this sub". I'm all for freedom of speech, but the caveat to that is sometimes censoring free speech to prevent public panic.
