No wonder half of them leave

---
Weird flex but ok
---
nice repost smh
---
Yes big boi my apologies 
---
Keep the flowers, you'll be saying something very similar to Konar soon enough.
---
As a skiller you chose to limit your gameplay to just fucking skilling. That is your choice. No update should be hindered because of the way one set of players feels about its devaluing their choice to already limit themselves... *cough ironmen cough*
---
Feels bad that all everyone‚Äôs talking about is some semi overtuned drop table instead of appreciation for an honestly great update
---
Wholeheartedly agree, changing to an iron man revitalised the magic of this game for me.
---
I now have no option but to do everything myself, and acquiring items, killing monsters, preparing for almost any aspect of the game is a completely different activity than it ever was before on a normal account.
---
It‚Äôs tough, but for me, worth it.
---
What in that table wasn't Generic loot -brews which were removed quickly?
---
[removed]
---
Retard trap. It's like fishing lobsters from 40 to 99 fishing or something.

You have my downvote

5 months of dev work and 5 dollars is enough to buy a cup of coffee

Or don't skip half the drops and really do the maths. 
---
Cmd + shift + 4 gives you the built in Mac snipping tool. Saves to desktop 
---
Please see the drama about Cuphead's tutorial 
---

---
And I feel you should see many aspects of something before critiquing it as broken. I am referring to Faux saying the whole table is busted and the slayer master broken while only farming Hydra. 
---
Or don't focus on one drop and work it out?
---
never liked the guy until now, but i'll throw my twitch prime at him for standing up for the game's integrity when no-one else seems to give a shit
---
Don't really think having a 230m bank means I've got the coin for it but I just might do it..

My browsing history is only filled with the bigger youtubers for OSRS, and woodworking videos. This is a separate account I have for youtube so it doesn't even get used for google. I've been watching a bunch of videos recently and this is the first add I've ever seen in regards to runescape.
---
And after several hours only 1 person got it implying an incredibly low drop chance. like one in a million low.
---
For medium level players it makes 1million times more sense just to go back to Nieve now, as Konar's tasks have a decent chance of forcing you into dangerous areas just to slowly grind out the task with very little incentive, versus Nieve where you can just do the tasks wherever you want and overall make more profit and xp per hour.
---
did we ever leave?
---
I agree they over nerfed. But a nerf was needed and getting a circlejerk over a streamer because Jagex over compensated on nerf is the problem with this community where we decide to hate over making good ideas.
---
yeah i am with you with a little boost. 10 ranars is still nearing 100k but having it be 100-200 just takes them money away from farming and puts it on slayer. either way a large portion of the player base will be upset. same reason they removed limpwurt root drops from kurask. in the end they have to make the drop tables healthy for the long term. this also has really big longterm ramifications outside of just money per hour, if pray pots drop really low they will be way more frequently used which makes slayer itself faster and so on. this is all without knowing the actual rates of the drops though, but even with just one day of these drops in the game ranarrs are down like 1k. it may stablize itself in the end but i dont think jagex can take that chance. in the end the smartest thing to do is put a pause on it and then tweak the drops to a more healthy state and put them back.
---
&gt;But now everything will remain as it was but additional to that Konra joined the dead content team. Maybe a second though Jagex?
---
What?
---
just who gives a fuck? its a game. its all entertainment at the end of the day whether youre efficient or not. that's how i broke it.
---
The game needs something other then skilling items for monsters to drop. Makimg other parts of the game dead content so new content can exist is something the community always wanted to avoid and is a contributing rs3 dying 
---
exactly my point, brother
---
You are more than welcome to find your way to the skilling methods discord and see for yourself. Anyone who can do bossing slayer, vorkath, raids, tob etc is not doing herb runs because its a waste of time and money for them. Are they not playing the game? Herb runs are only good money for mid level players who can't do any of that.
---
Nah, diary, slayer points and a rare drop is a lil bit too much imo. Besides theres too much in the slayer points list as it is (i dont liek herb sack being on there).
---
Oh god can you imagine, that would be pretty stupid.
---
Asides from my best friend who I've known my whole life, I don't think I'd give $1000 to anyone. Especially if I only knew them from the internet.
---
I think Faux did this with the Negative XP Lamps back when they were being polled. Told his viewership to vote no because he had a pure he ruined and didn't get the chance to fix his when he made the mistake. Don't really care about Faux spreading his opinion to his viewers a lot of people do. Kinda sucks one person can be given that kind of power just through popularity.
---
I had a question on a history test requiring the written defiention of a ‚ÄòNomad‚Äô. Therefore, brought me back to the old soul wars Nomad, meaning ‚Äòwandering traveler‚Äô. Oh man runescape teaches more than any parents would ever know üòä
---
A level 93 shouldn't be able to make as much off slayer as a level 126 just because they hit a broken drop table. Get out of here with the notion that you shouldn't have to work hard to get rich. Either get smart and learn how to make passive income or work your ass off and get some levels to get the consistant income you want.
---
It does devalue Skilling. Maybe not heavily but theres definitely an impact. The subreddit has been complaining about Skilling being replaced by pvm for years.
---
The fact that the drops were rare doesnt have any relevance here. I just think alchables always make more sense than mass resource drops 
---
The fact that it was even on there shows how little planning went into this drop table. You shut up.
---
Yeah probably took me 45 or so without guides and with reading all the quest dialogue. They were short and solid like my dinger
---
ya god forbid i get a lot of dlegs, that would rly fuck the economy over and devalue my dleg farming alt at wyverns. revs was super broken.
---
I actually did unfollow faux after all this. The guy acted all smug and high horse during his whole stream, while at the same time turning it into an even bigger echo chamber. 
---
go back to rotmg bro
---
4M per person
---
Lol stop buying gold and they will stop appearing 
---
Overreacting
---
Reddit: WTF this droptable is WAY too bad, DEAD CONTENT!
---
Also reddit: Yes, skillers should be a major resource income, not slayers.
---
Does the term ‚Äúextremely rare‚Äù mean anything to you? 
---
Is this a meme?
---
To be fair, this meme was about his very open opinion about the RDT, not him causing it.
---
You're a legit retard.
---
the points and hydra task mainly. The drops are also still there and decently valuable
---
Yes, it does have an impact, but if the chance is low enough it should be like a drop of water in an ocean.
---
Sparc mac is my last hope (Please don't tell me he has iron men too)
---
Did you blur out the leprechaun. Also Gz
---
Explain
---
he dm'd one jmod (gambit) about confirming the brew drop (which was later confirmed by ash to not even be in the game anymore), and that was about it.
---
Thanks, would have been useful 3 days ago
---
But Jagex came up with that first drop table on their own. Despite that, you think they should stop polling players. I seriously doubt the contents of that first table would have passed a poll.
---
He does lol
---
1,300,000,000 in Bonds at 3,000,000 a piece is about 433 bonds needed, so at $7 a bond it translates to about $3,031 so if you wanted that much in bonds it would cost you around $3,000...holy fuck dude, sry man. I lost 14m to skull trickers in wild and was pacing my living room muttering so i cant quiet imagine how you feel lol
---
I‚Äôm confused... what happened?
---
The camera doesn‚Äôt focus on the fakes. Thank you :) 
---
Which one?
---
I was waiting for this comment
---
Y tho
---
I meant archeology as the next skill. 
---
I didn‚Äôt really read past the first few sentences but are you complaining about the fact the games growing?
---
Exactly this, they gave it a single day and only went by the couple of posts of people getting the rare drops on the front page. If 20,000 people start doing the new slayer master assignments we‚Äôre obviously going to see a bunch of rare drops during that time. Look at the Hydra for example, not that many people can do it with its 95 slayer requirement and still there were a bunch of posts yesterday of people already getting the pet. If it were more accessible to people and we saw that many posts of pet drops, everyone would think it‚Äôs so easy to get the pet. 
---
Also fuck Faux.
---
Q 
---
Celastrus seeds are now 400k each
---
Yeah as long as jagex are willing to tweak it, I don't think herbs are a good idea either personally I much rather would have had some unique items on the drop table and then there's not even a problem of it devaluing farming and prayer pots and shit like that. But either way, now I don't really have an incentive to use her so back to duradel
---
I can see your stand point from a normal account, but I look at it from an iron man view. So that 1m profit an hour means actually nothing to me. 200 herbs from a random slayer kill on the other hand is extremely op.
---
Same here! I had that task as well, it was cool to know about.
---
I have not noticed a massive change in gp/h before and after the coldfix. Y'all need to calm the fuck down 
---
Was waiting for that. The one without barrows gloves üòÇ
---
Maxed players who are disgusted at the thought of mid level content
---
Telling people to shut up on the internet like you're so much smarter. 
---
The issue is that it was on the table in the first place. Someone consciously put an absurd drop, agreed that it was a bit much when called out, and took the whole table into reconsideration. That is smarter than leaving something potentially broken in.
---
Just go in to enjoy playing the game.
---
If you're waking up going 'Oh man I gotta grind out those last 72 black demons for slayer' before you even touch your PC, you've already fucked up. 
---
Ah yes, let us replace 1 straw man, with another...
---
The argument was never "300k from hounds is too much!!!!" it was ALWAYS the brews/herbs drop being waayyyyyy too much RSS....
---
TIL farming runs are op and have to be nerfed /s
---
They are supposed to have progressive servers that will continue to add content and expansions. The reason WoW died is because it became so casual. I think it‚Äôs going to be like RS and you‚Äôll see more people on classic. 
---
The points just mean she will be used for 10th task farming. Also unless you have thousands of points saved for skips you aren't going to cycle through her trash tasks for hydras. 
---
Mine have increased.
---
He shouldnt be getting swords at 81 fishing since it scales
---
Not so sure about that one my bro
---
I suggest only max accounts can vote in polls. 
---
The mid level argument is something I hadn't seen and honestly as a 84 cmb person she's such a blessing over that fairy bitch in fariyland. 
---
Explain why it‚Äôs dead content
---
But .. if jagex listens to us now screaming revert the changes, they listened to reddit AGAIN. They‚Äôre in a lose lose situation atm, change the drops they seem indecisive, don‚Äôt change the drops and they seem bad at balancing
---
So far I'm on 46 KC but not been lucky yet, keeping at it and rocking in Karils. 
---
exactly
---
Didn't read past the past few words, but we both know that you did.

You only need 950 saltpetre for 5-100% favor btw

Alright man thank you so much appreciate the help

The 400 IQ tactic to bait into an "ironman btw"
---
Been playing old-school since last year, had the same account since late 2006
---
Because skilling is shit and making skilling even more shit by dropping hundreds of herbs and thousands of potions is moving in the wrong direction. And it wasn't her profits that were the problem, it's what she was dropping in the quantity she was.
---
  
---
They'll probably have uniques and shit ready by next week to bring her profit back up 
---
lols ironically
---
Its just as well I can't play considering the only people who get their way in this game are nolifer exp efficient maxed idiots who have every item and tons of cash.
---
Sucks to be a normal player right
---
God damn Piper Perri is ugly as fuck
---
Honestly I thought it was specifically there to get rid of level 3 skillers.
---
There was a quick and (depending on who you talk to) steep nerf applied today. The idea is that there was enough outreach via social media, streamers, and in-game conversation (I‚Äôm sure they can tag and look at people talking about it in-game) to warrant a temporary hold. Most likely a week will go by, then a poll put into place for a week vote. 
---
The thing that most people that were opposed to the drop table was that it would de-value amazing items/potions in OSRS. People have floated the idea of more alchables but that seems meh and just further floods the economy with gold, something that was a big issue in RS3. 
---
The addition of uniques (the mystic set) and other things are cool but still miss the mark. It would interesting for a key system to come about that let you pick from different parts of the loot table depending on what the current population is picking lately. So if every is holding herbs, the amount of herbs from the key is lessened until the keys are spent more spread out on other items. Think of it as a more interactive version of the Kingdom we get to run. 
---
No but why would a level 70 have loads of stuff good on them? Use their brain 
---
Reminds me of Nex in rs2 after everyone had 3 death touch darts
---
We would have had to vote yes to 2500 sara brew drop aswell. Since it was originally on the table.
---
People will never be happy or satisfied and will want to complain about everything.
---
The fact that it is new content and everyone is doing it and posting it on reddit or typing it in a twitch chat. Makes it seem like the drop table is super overpowered but its rare. Sometimes you get the drop, sometimes you get 2 or maybe 3. Sometimes you go 3-4 tasks without ever hitting it. Jagex should know all about the items and everything by now, so if they put it in the game it should stay.
---
Nah fuck this
---
Reddit absolutely has a tendency to hivemind.
---
game integrity changes are never polled due to players being biased and voting for their own interest.
---
It‚Äôs hard to find, but a lot of people have posted really wonky looking animations caused by animation smoothing.  But I guess to be fair, i don‚Äôt know what the normal attack is supposed to look like w/o the smoothing. Wish OP posted that instead
---
And humanity 
---
Says Charlie sheen
---
Who the hell lends $1000 worth of shit to friends? I've lent a game or two out before worth $50 max. 
---
oh my bad, I misunderstood what you were saying 
---
I agree it will definitely slow down. But that initial flood of the market could fuck things up hard for skillers for months.
---
bloody sook it up its easy to tell
---
I love armchair psychologists.
---
I sniped a torva helm for 400m+ after release.. and I forgot the fucking arrows, still sniped the loot share.
---
Didn't expect to have luck in osrs cuz that
---
Oh, i was under the assumtion that they couldnt be barraged because they could teleport around. TIL
---
I hope they can get some cool and interesting uniques to replace the very rare drops. But keep some supplies as small drops. So doing Konar feels exciting as you could get some rare and valuable items.
---
not sure why the jagex team listens to retards on reddit. they should just do their own thing 
---
I prefer the side that someone would think any nerfs would stand a chance at passing period, lol
---
If it wasn't a balance change and fixed without a poll we'd still be stuck with 100 noted dragon plateskirts drops, OP af ranged void and zulrah literally being the meta for ironman cooking, smithing, crafting, farming, herblore... Apart from shitting out money like it's nobody's business, of course
---
That's the loot it always has been and always should be. 
---
He literally gets downvoted to Oblivion on every post. If this is seeking karma, posting dog pics must be the worst method. DAM
---
Rofl there's heaps of easier money making. What's your point?
---
Heres what we shouldn't balance around:  
---
1) Ironmen: They are a minority. They play the game by special rules most do not want to be bound by. Changes to the game aren't made to cater to them, they are just a side effect of their self limitation.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
2) Streamers: They are a minority. A minority with the loudest voice. They literally get paid to yell at their screens and create drama. More drama, more viewers. So when something is good for the community you can bet the streamers will always be shooting it down. Also they do not participate in the content they call to be nerfed. They've made their accounts already and are close to done with progression. They only care that fewer people can reach their level and become competition to them.
---
3) Reddit: They are a minority. A minority where creating drama gets you karma. It's to their advantage to see things nerfed in the wrong areas. They do not care about the game.  
---
Let's not kill off new, well developed content that brings back the true runescape feel. So /explitive/ing  what if a streamer is mad that theres an alternative to the best meta way to do something.
---
Those are my stats right now. I'm pretty happy with it. I can't do any of the end game content, but theres plenty of mid level stuff to enjoy before grinding up to 80's and 90s just to do bosses
---
Even just packing a dds is all you need. I‚Äôve killed so many trash pkers by carrying 15 d bolts and a dds. A lot of time you can spec them and kill them or when they go to eat just run. I‚Äôll go stand at chaos alter naked with full pk inva just waiting for kids to skull. 
---
I‚Äôve only recently got back into RS since my original account way back in the day(I never got a 99 and reached about 93cb or so). I‚Äôm 71cb now and have been focusing on questing towards a quest cape, but I‚Äôm starting to want to try an Ironman. Would you suggest getting into it without a grasp of the entire game?? (Haven‚Äôt really gotten into farming or hunter yet). Or would you suggest I get as far as I can on a regular account first?  I‚Äôve been itching to try a hardcore Ironman, but worried about throwing away the time I‚Äôve put into my current account
---
And why is that? Someone makes a big mistake &gt; Only affects one person &gt; That means its not a big deal, right? &gt; No.
---
The primary issue is not that one person got 2500 sara brews, its why the fuck someone could be so braindead to put 2500 sara brews in the game in the first place.
---
3m in what, 10 hours?
---
Yeah I probably get 2 specs for every 3 kills, besides the starting 100%. Idk, it seems to works out well enough, I get long trips
---
Agreed. 
---
Oh and just some food for thought. Isn't it interesting how Contruction supplies are nowhere to be found essentially in any drop table worthy of doing regularly (outside of Gang Boss npc, and other such one time dead-content).
---
I'd really love to see if this drop table removed herbs and included planks. And see what that would have done. Or a similar application to other troublesome instances where "skillers" are complaining about gathering skills being devalued. Safe to say there is no gathering skill that creates planks, so it would be an experiment I'd love to see put into practice.
---
Based lad
---
I did 8 tasks and didnt get anything, you have no right to cry about it
---
Smh. At least you have Nieve. I got Steve
---
Tbf I prefer preemptive nerfing and buffing later than waiting for shit to potentially fuck the economy and THEN nerf it
---
The new slayer master Konar offered a extra loot table while doing her tasks. People complained about some of the drops being worth too much. Jagex nerfed the Konar drop table. People are complaining about the nerf. 
---
I don‚Äôt know in what world you think streamers reside but for a game of osrs‚Äô size I reckon they barely make over 60k a year. 
---
The community managed to change something without a poll
---
I'm flabbergasted
---
They're not easily acquired are you draft? The drop rate is insanely low. 
---
Having hydras being exclusive to Konar makes their drops more valuable. I hope they don't make it so every slayer master assigns them, it would make the items crash.
---
Your system doesn't support it most likely. Same happens with my laptop, works fine on my desktop though, since it's a bit beefier.
---
ur clueless
---
Literally fuck off serene 
---
They should not be polled, what the fuck do we players know about balancing games? Jagex should have the data to make informed decisions and should stick to their guns if they think something is healthy for the game. Sure they get it wrong sometimes but so do Reddit detectives.
---
When it was polled, it was pitched as being more points rather than more profit and the loot table was a smaller factor. For most players it would be better to stick to Duradel, but that was kinda the point; Konar isn't meant to be the new best Slayer Master but another option for those who are interested similar to Krystillia.
---
That is not to say the drop table can't be more profitable than it is now, but as the Dev Blog says it was only meant to be a slight increase, which I'd say it still does fine. That said, it isn't doing the "including food to sustain you on your task" very well. It would be nice if it dropped a few lobsters or such alongside the noted drops.
---
I meant to say might as well, I usually say it not type it lol
---
man, I'm just really disappointed. I'm not a xp reigns supreme kind of player, I'm a casual and I was really enjoying Konar, yeah I got one decent ranarr drop but the rest of the time not getting anything substantial kind of evened out.
---
Jagex just kneejerking decisions like this just devalues the integrity of he developers imo, I wasn't the most hard-core player but I do play every day. I think I'm going to take a break.
---
I can't do god wars or vorkath and all those other bosses cos I suck at the item switching stuff, just disappointed something that made me want to perk up and enjoy something again can get nerfed so quickly because others who probably didn't use this content anyway got mad
---
weirder things have happened, if your so over it go and do dragon slayer 2 and kill green drags in peace
---
whys everyone being so toxic it‚Äôs not that big of a deal
---
I laughed.
---
I agree. Maybe the next monster will drop 1m xp lamps for warding. Wouldn‚Äôt want to have to actually train the skill normally 
---
I agree with this but it‚Äôs also jagex fault for not realizing their own blunder. All they had to do was release a vague idea of how the drops would work and people wouldn‚Äôt have been as pissed off. Would they have complained? Yup. But would their be some evidence for the whiners to shadddddap. Yup.
---
But instead they wanted it to be a fun surprise and it blew up in their face. One day.. They will learn.
---
Personally, I think OP pointed out the time investment as a way to suggest that this was way too small of a timeframe to make a huge change like that; working on something for months, then gutting it into (potentially) oblivion in 24 hours.  
---
Of course that being said, that isn't the responsibility of the "complainers".  They are just making their opinion known.  It's up to Jagex to take that opinion, research the facts, and decide what to do.  The knee jerk reaction is on them.
---
People who like skilling aren't "skillers". I like skilling over combat, I still have a high slayer and cb level because I aim for max. 
---
I prefer skilling because no other mmo really does it. I can't think of any others where you can hunt or fish or chop wood for hours. I find it enjoyable.
---
I don't like Slayer because it's go kill 10 boars in RuneScape form. And combat in OSRS isn't exactly interesting. 
---
The notorious hacker?
---
Game. Set. Match. Come play again when ever. Probably looking for an easier reddit post to comment on.
---
It should already scale by level because higher levels have access to better slayer monsters, and higher combat levels and better gear means they kill things faster and thus make more money. So I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessary 
---
why is this toxic nonsense being upvoted.
---
It‚Äôs not an unpopular opinion when the whole front page is people saying your opinion 
---
I loved the dialogue
---
But did she fall for a twitch phishing stream? Nope üòÇüòÇ Retard.
---
Can the eternal Slayer ring be made attachable to the Slayer Helm for a right click teleport and contact on the slayer helm?
---
Look at his comment Karma.
---
Nah but at the same time not all 300k are coming here daily. It's more than likely a small percentage of daily repeat users. Those users are more likely to post and interact too. 
---
Coldfix was done earlier today. It's been nerfed by ~40%
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt you just tell him
---
4 blocks is a BIG issue for slaying efficiently, as even if you block the top weighted tasks there's 2 monsters that you will frequently be assigned and have to skip.
---
The BBC and HBO both charge people to use their service? That‚Äôs a completely ridiculous comparison.
---
Yes just like Faux made it so everyone began witchhunting him.
---
Stop taking influencers‚Äô opinions so seriously. When you think about it, they‚Äôre just one player like you are. Just because the content doesn‚Äôt suit them doesn‚Äôt mean everyone has to call for a nerf. I know we love their YouTube or Twitch content, but it does seem that their voice overpowers the community‚Äôs feeling towards an update that Jagex eventually sees...
---
Sometimes, they kinda do. Perhaps the system could work more like that in the future, but the problem I see with it how much is enough support. Like if they add an update that was 72% in favor, I don't think most would mind. But then what if they add one that was 66% support but doesn't add another with 68%? That would certainly lead to some uproar since they did one but not the other...
---
Really would like to see osrs get an item lending system akin to pre eoc
---
In other news, the people who speak are the people that are heard. 
---
I haven't played in years, and when I returned, I went straight to ironman
---
Occasionally I need to look up things on the wiki here and there; but to me, its about learning the game again and not taking any shortcuts to avoid parts of it
---
I don't have membership, and I will say that ironman is a lot harder without membership
---
It just kinda sucks when you get an hour a day to play and you spend that entire hour doing stuff like fishing to be able to do a fun thing. 
---
Buy the dip for easy profit
---
OP is projecting like I've never seen before...
---
Dead content
---
My bad for not being interested in checking out streaming the lamest game to watch ever? Shits fun to play but watching it is whack. 
---
It's not free.
---
a fire giant shouldn't have a better drop then 95% of bosses in game.
---
To be fair, at the rate herb prices were dropping, the drop value would've been the same by sunday.
---
Great, now we have 5000 sara brew drop.
---
I don't even get your argument here... I already said I don't give a shit about the item values that were dropped. Yet you're upset because your 2m drop at "twice the rate of dwh" is now 700k?
---
The low end drops were nerfed 30% but the rare ones are nerfed closer to 90%
---
How did you come to that conclusion?
---
yeah my runescape nostalgia is just standing outside varrock castle talking to the regulars there
---
The lowlanda themselves are far from dead content. The new slayer master however is pretty dead without the drops. 
---
But getting them requires quests, access to teleports, certain items, etc. It takes a lot to do them efficiently. Im not disagreeing with you though I agree they're not too hard to get.
---
This template is sexy af
---
I have played this game (RS in general) for so long that I honestly couldn't give a rats ass what another guy thinks about how I'm playing in this particular account. I've had accounts with shit stats with a lot of money, great stats with no money and one account with great stats as well as a lot of money, so I know what it's like to be in all of those situations. And they all bring a different kind of enjoyment to the game. Shit stats and loads of money? Buy the BIS as you level up combat or skills that money can't buy. No money and good stats? Work towards getting a piece of equipment and when you get it, that feeling is oh so sweet. Both? Buy the most ridiculous shit and just flex. 
---
On my current account I've got stats in the mid 70s and about 40m bank. And all I wanna do is take it slow, try new mini bosses I never cared about, different skilling methods, etc. It's a different kind of fun. 
---
I honestly just wanted the herbs and Sara brews to be switched out for something else. I didn‚Äôt like the fact they took out nests from boss tables cause ‚Äúwe want more resources brought in through skilling than pvm‚Äù. I just think it‚Äôs extremely hypocritical that they added herbs and brews (at least in the quantities they added them) to something available to everyone combat 75+. Exchanging the herbs out of the table for the equivalent in seeds is something I could get behind. 
---
Yep that's the one! 
---
This sub is a cesspool of autism since the update. 
---
&gt;Just because you can't afk some chickens on a Slayer task for a few hours to get a Twisted Bow
---
Jesus christ you over exaggerated horribly. 
---
People doing slayer at suboptimal xp rates hitting a 1/80k drop for some ranarrs isnt a bad thing. Hell, this is what the community wants. Community likes rare big drops. Rare ass drop for barely 2m is a problem? 
---
&gt;That's literally absurd for someone with sub 70 skills to make this kind of money without working for it
---
How much an hour was the old drop table per kill for a mid level player? Do you know? 
---
What easter eggs?
---
If it's worth slightly more than any other mystic color most pkers won't use it
---
You don't understand how the reddit hivemind works.
---
My tbow rose 60m üòé
---
Ty man :) 2nd one nice ! I hope mine comes soon
---
But even if im still in combat with the monk who i wont end up killing because he heals and i only hit 1s?
---
&gt; At zeah elite, you get 25% more points, so you can skip 25% more tasks.
---
Its 2 more points, up from 18, so 11%
---
&gt;Sure, but the tasks are substantially better than they would be if you were on another master because of the existence of the RDT
---
The RDT was never that good, it could never hope to make up the difference in GP or XP between shit like Hellhounds in Witchhaven vs. Cerberus, Nechrayaels in Tower vs. Catacombs, Dagannoths in Catacombs vs. Lighthouse or DKS, etc.
---
I assume when your are saying "it's entirely on Jagex" you're referring to the blame. If not that, then what else are you taking about being 'on' them? Because if it's anything but that, your post is not clear and definitely being misunderstood. People on the Nerf-it side are *not* getting upvotes right now.
---
They should have just polled the drop table
---
I‚Äôve done about 10 task from her now and she adds to an avg of 150k plus pre task so far 
---
Which is why I asked if anyone knew. I'm not sure what it is you're not understanding here, friend. 
---
Yeah and getting tasks requires 75 combat, which is much harder than finishing the quests needed to do a majority of med. steps.
---
I think it's like $1500?
---
I guarantee it is closer to 100-300k gp/h
---
And now it's 160k gp/h big fucking deal?
---
You‚Äôre an idiot 
---
Good thing the boss doesn't damage you if you do it right
---
Fuck you Jagex. your team is full of testosterone lacking people.
---
Explain. 
---
It isnt dead content, reddit is just crying right now
---
So you think they should've kept the drop table? Why should they listen to you?
---
Most likely haha, that's usually my first stop. 
---
this isn't a post about not being able to complain. it's about people being dumb enough to complain before they can understand what they're actually complaining about lol
---
Yes its a bigger problem, its called exaggeration. The problem is not the 2500 sara brews being in the game for a few hours, the problem is how the fuck someone is autistic enough to add them to the drop table, shortly after nerfing bird houses because of the crash of sara brew prices. 
---
Who said it was temporary 
---
Kebos slayer before and after nerf was not worth doing if you were an efficient player. Doing other slayer methods is way quicker and leaves you more time to make more GP.
---
So that was not the issue, don't pretend it was. The issue was the resources it generated unnecessarily. That's what they changed. They can make the table stronger in value, but the nerf theg made was not because the gp/he was making the method the best in the game. It never came close to that. Like you said, it's mid level content 
---
Because the items are ridiculous. Nobody would care if it was the equivilent in value but with alcheables. It's because it dropped brews and herbs that devalued a bunch of other aspects of the game. Those kind of drops aren't healthy to the game, and don't belong in it.

Yeah I cant wait to hit 1243589352348234 on my action bar to obtain 10000 brews. Thanks, but no thanks.

Straya cunt
---
On the floor m8 good job 
---
Med level slayer does not have to be rewarding. The reward is being able to make about 300m-500m on the last stretch to 99.
---
r/iamverybadass ?
---
I don't think they read the whole thing
---
Wtf it's broken how can anyone say it's not
---
This opinion isn‚Äôt unpopular, it‚Äôs all over the front page.
---
It‚Äôs also incorrect. People weren‚Äôt asking for the drop table as a whole to be nerfed, they were asking for stupid inclusions like ‚Äò2500 Sara brews‚Äô to be removed. 
---
Jagex shat the bed and decided to nerf it heavily.
---
She gives 20 points where duradel only gives 15. That alone will make her a viable choice for anyone who wants to get points, which is MOST mid game slayer players who need to unlock stuff.
---
In fact, many of her flaws are nonfactors if you look at it from a medium level account's perspective. They can'd do bosses for task anyway, they don't want to cannon that many tasks since they don't have the bank to afford efficient slayer. They don't have access to alternatives like Demonic gorillas or doing DK's, KQ, or Kril.
---
In fact, places like the catacombs are pretty good for medium level players because they save on pray pots, get a chance at totems for marginal profit increase.
---
So, honestly I don't see the issue at all. She's a GREAT mid level slayer boss, she's good end game if you want points for any reason.
---
Her profit increase is at such a low % that it's not even really part of the calculation for her viability. It also makes it extremely gimmicky to just give people a 1m drop randomly for using this slayer boss.
---
Her RDT should be a marginal GP increase and it is. It's very much like the catacombs of kourend in that it's restricting for a slight profit increase. The catacombs have their purpose and so does Konar, she doesn't have to give players a 300-500k gp/hr increase to be viable. She doesn't have to be the new best slayer master.
---
She's perfectly balanced even without the RDT.
---
Did almost every patch in the game 4 times including trees with no luck, how god Damn rare is it? And does it drop on each individual harvest or check health/finishing a plant?
---
damn normies, go back to camping clue spots in wildy
---
Counter argument to what? I haven't made any argument. I ask if you would like me to make valid arguments where someone could say it's both good and bad based on perspective?
---
Also, everything is based on perspective. 
---
For instance, a CEO like the fellow Martin Shkreli that wanted to raise the price of Thiola for managing the disease cystinuria.. the benefit was shareholders and the company would make a bunch of money. So there is the positive impact. Even if the rest of the world suffers from that drug going up in price from a dollar and fifty cents, to thirty dollars per pill.. from a certain perspective, most things can be seen in a positive and negative light.
---
So, in fact you need to realize everything depends on the perspective of the person making the analysis.
---
And in that same way the CEO of that drug company could have benefited, PvM'ers could also see this as a positive and simply be happy they don't have to waste their time skilling for supplies.
---
Do you understand now, why indeed perspective is paramount?
---
better safe than sorry retards 
---
Needs more black mask unimbued
---
The influx in prices was because of merchers. Not because of the boss
---
MTX was ignorable to an extent, EOC was not.
---
The same could be said about the previous gp/h, yet 300k gp/h money making methods are clearly too OP. Right?
---
The fact that they didn't poll it should tell you how bad they fucked up... They don't have to poll potentially game ruining things
---
They nerfed it now because it's the last chance they get be the weekend. And if it went the weekend it could have ruined the game.
---
After the weekend they'll revisit and it make it better, people gotta chill tf out.
---
Too bad the rest of Zeah is just a grindy, boring mess.
---
Thank you
---
He knew him for 2 years. At a certain point you should be able to trust people. Saying that you've never met him in person is a ridiculous argument 
---
Anyone driven an UP? Is it decent? Gonna have to rent one for vacation.
---
What's the corner method? I always get destroyed during the lightning phase :(
---
better safe than sorry - jagex
---
Retards..
---
Looks like we got a badass over here.
---
Hes asking so he knows if hes supposed to be getting sharks or if the lower tier fish are still droppable even with higher levels. holy fuck mate learn to read
---
This is way to OP bro
---
But we're having a discussion about sara brews, and my analogy's relation to said sara brews. Maybe you should fuck off then?
---
can someone please make a poll 
---
I'm 99 slay, I came back to slayer because of the chance of something good from shit monsters. They ruined it for me. Time to go back to grinding hydra
---
Still don‚Äôt get how it‚Äôs a claw? It looks like a plate with a claw on it maybe
---
Saying this is what makes you such a pathetic person, it's unbelievable. The fact you'd get so offended by this is beyond me. You need a slap and you need to grow up.
---
Unique suggestion for the Konar loot table:
---
Holy water - an untradeable, stackable thrown Ranged weapon especially powerful against demons that already exists in-game, unlocked during the Legends Quest, that would become more readily available and used if dropped by Slayer monsters. Its bonuses/effect could be altered if necessary, and this drop would only be available to players who have completed Legends Quest.
---
It's not the value of the drops. It the fact that it was a fuck load of brews and herbs.
---
&gt; If 20,000 people start doing the new slayer master assignments we‚Äôre obviously going to see a bunch of rare drops during that time.
---
An example would be new shiny releases in Pokemon Go. I know, quite a different game.
---
But you'll have 0.4% chance of a shiny, and literally within 3 mins of the update, someone will post the new shiny on reddit, despite 95% of all players are never gonna get the shiny.
---
Which is why he is asking, you know asking the people here who might have had more experience. 
---
Yes it was.
---
We did it Reddit
---
and ur analogy is so bad that it doesn‚Äôt contribute to the discussion of sara brews :)
---
well not really they're just less common , now it actually resemble a bit more the rare drop table
---
The point is the change of pace and actually going to different places is actually fun.
---
Everyone take your guesses which J Mod was the model for the redwood tree?
---
That tells you nothing about supply you mongoloid. The price crash is literally the product of overreactions just like yours.
---
Maybe add addy bolts unf 250 to 400 with a similar weight to rune bolts.
---
This still requires a flecthing level to make useable.
---
Perhaps its just me but is anyone else worried how much seeds are crashing? I dont think contracts are too op but there's so just too many seeds in game now and fruits and allotments are meaningless. I wish they'd have implemented a use for them since now it seems all seeds are going to be worthless unless they are top tier in their perspective patch.. Not to mention the nerf to the drop table also adds more seeds. I think this was a big oversight but hopefully I'm wrong.
---
For real. Almost all monsters had a 1/100 potential for a change to roll an extremely rare drop, which are usually 1/5,000 or 1/10,000 of much higher. Already that was 1/500,000 - 1/1,000,000 for 2m.....
---
Where in qld was this? 
---
Birdhouses were OP for a long time and almost nobody on Reddit complained and begged for a nerf.
---
ONE drop of 2500 brews that is probably as rare as damn third age and suddenly the entire thing is OP and is taken away within hours of release.
---
I‚Äôm so pissed about this since I‚Äôm a med-high ish lvl on my main and i was building a pure for the last week, and I figured that I could wait because there wasn‚Äôt going to be anything that would change except for the boss maybe, which I already can‚Äôt do, but now all this is is just inconvenient slayer. SMH I wanted to be able to have some interesting and fun content to make some money but if it‚Äôs back to the same ducking boring old grinds. Fuck everyone 
---
Hmm, ive also been hearing this is a temporary nerf, but idk how true that is. Itt will get worked out
---
PLEASE NOTE I HAVE TRIED MY BEST TO REMOVE JUDGEMENT. I DO NOT IMPLY MY THOUGHTS SUPPORTING OR NOT SUPPORTING THE CHANGES. THIS IS JUST ME SUMMARIZING THE EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED
---
* New slayer master named Konar, requires 75 combat. Worse xp rates but has access to an additional drop table for any task assigned by her
---
* Initially one person got a 2.5k sara brew drop but Jagex [quickly got rid of it](https://twitter.com/OldSchoolRS/status/1083669988790226944)
---
* Original old drop table: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar_quo_Maten?oldid=8371644#Konar's_drop_table
---
* [People complaining the drop table](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aej2l2/konars_additional_drop_table_is_comical_and_goes/) (which remember is in addition to whatever normal drops you're getting from any task) was too op, and ruining skilling/whatever as it dropped too many resources and made it too easy for 'lower levels' to get massive drops
---
* Jagex issues [a nerf](http://services.runescape.com/m=news/konar-loot-table-balancing?oldschool=1). Here's a [link to a better picture of the drop table now](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar_quo_Maten#Konar's_drop_table). The nerf is roughly 30% on average, flattens out the potential drop rewards (max drop used to be ~2.5M, is now ~500k), and has a lot of items changed so that not as many resources are dropped
---
* Now people are upset about the nerf saying that it is ['dead content'](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aexyj1/congratulations_to_everyone_who_complained_you/)
---
There's polls for every update there's no way we poll the loot gp/hour, but there should definitely be discussion about what type of items we expect I guess
---
At least that's a rare boss variant unlocked through slayer points. Getting 2500 brews off a regular jelly you have to admit is retarded. Think of getting that on an iron. 
---
He is responding to the persons comment not Faux.
---
H
---
I can't complain. Even post nerf I managed to make 250K on a greater demons task. Beats the hell out of the usual drops! 
---
You‚Äôre right, and it‚Äôs probably an acceptable form of entry for pre 2007, but they could have made a barrier or door that everyone can pass at the same time, if you don‚Äôt have the requirements you can‚Äôt enter. Instead they reused old and outdated methods of ‚Äú1 at a timely entry. There are literally 100 people in the guild in w61.
---
Do MM2 and that's another 2 tasks I'll be skipping since it opens up Addy and rune dragons right?
---
Thanks! Just got all the base images from the OSRS website with screencaps or inspect element and then put it  together with minor edits where needed. 
---
Glad others appreciate it to, but can't really reply to everyone without just spamming the thread, so thanks guys!
---
Why don't they just make even more use of the poll system, let's get like 3 polls a week
---
... by removing GP?
---
Everyone is a vocal minority right now. This is fucking reddit, the actual definition of a hive mind. We wouldn't know unless it was polled off reddit.
---
yes of course I realize that, not sure where you got the idea I didn't
---
I like it. Gives us something to ree about. If it was perfect we couldn‚Äôt complain. 
---
&gt;fuck you for answering the question
---
-reddit
---
Imagine me naked...
---
Yikes
---
Well I was being sarcastic
---
We don‚Äôt deserve you Nieve. u/Zuhaar cancel the Konar art, we need more Nieve nsfw.
---
I don‚Äôt see a problem with Jagex trying to keep skilling valid instead of making OSRS more and more pvm heavy. Give them some time to tweak things and I‚Äôm sure they can make it reasonable. 
---
No need to be facetious lmao. That‚Äôs a shit analogy 
---
If you want to compare it to anything compare it to the current RDT. Its a good incentive for the slayer master and herb drops are extremly rare (there is literally an entire drop table to roll, not just guaranteed a ‚Äútbow‚Äù)
---
I do everything just to get clue scrolls. I think that they are the most fun in the game.
---
;)
---
I think it makes more sense for the Hydra to be attached to this boss (only in her dungeon) than it does for the master specific RDT to be attached to the boss. Not really sure why it's attached to her or how her theme of balance makes the extra drops make sense.
---
I agree i did like 6 tasks yesterday and got 1 drop from her table. Definitely not op. Please dont nerf
---
oh no
---
Skotizo didn't count for my demons in kourend :/
---
What's the eastern lands?? 
---
How much did it sell for
---
exactly.
---
I was going to say I remember gold going for $0.60 per mil, but I just checked out some sites and it seems it's gone up to $1.00-$1.10 per mil. So a tbow would be around $1200.
---
Also if you can legit sell gold for a dollar per mil, ToB at max efficiency is better than a minimum wage job in the US lol.
---
You do understand both inflation and deflation are equally bad to economies, right?
---
Removing too much gp is just as harmful as having too much gp.
---
+ You're not going to tax half of the economy, you're just gonna force big ticket sales to be done in trade screens.
---
Its the infomation age grandpa
---
Absolutely not.
---
The fundamentally core change to the gameplay is insurmountably worse than MTX.
---
Upcummies win the day again.
---
I believe that's DS2 that you're thinking of
---
Then you should be banned for posting off topic stuff
---
Retard here can someone explain?
---
Good way to control total kills/h too.
---
nobody plays rs3 because it sucks
---
I‚Äôd rather have the items be untradeable personally. If anything maybe make the shards tradeable but the items not?
---
no thats DS2, MM2 is demonic gorillas
---
Not everyone posts their drops on reddit
---
.
---
Herbs were basically a 1/80k drop. Assuming you hit that table once every 80k killa, how many herbs/hr is that. 
---
No support without 50 dragon impling jars
---
Oh! I stand corrected then. I just assumed they wouldn't release details of a mistake like that.
---
I know this is comedy, but as a casual player, who comes back every now and then, what is going on? 
---
same :D
---
Q
---
HcIm CoMeS tO aN eNd
---
insert brainlet
---
Or maybe sending players qol surveys every few months based on play time and stuff where a few hundred people would be able to write about their grievances. After a big update survey people doing the content at random to see what the average players think. If multiple people say something is really bad, they could potentially look more into it
---
Haha just a prank bro!
---
Only friendless retards irl believe this.
---
thats pretty interesting that your post came an hour after an extremely similar post hit front of the subreddit. Small world i guess.
---
As we all know, slayer, the skill that literally everyone hates and is the least profitable skill in the game, needed a buff. /s
---
its been getting increasingly worse lately
---
OH NO MY RUNESCAPE ITEM
---
‚Äúnot every single‚Äù
---
well i can use the same logic. I‚Äôve done 30 tasks pre nerf and my best drop was 100k worth of arrowtips. Not everyone gets lucky, most don‚Äôt actually. So not only am I losing out on xp, i actually Lost money since i could‚Äôve been doing vorkath. you see, if only a selected few get a good drop, its not significant to cause damage to the game. Its just like everyday, someone gets a tbow, someone gets a scythe, someone gets bandos tassets in 1 kc. In the grand scheme of things its not that big of a deal.
---
Typed this on phone, excuse my dogshit grammat
---
I wish we had some ew3 level puzzles in osrs as well.
---
Seems like that could just be it.  I haven‚Äôt tried blast furnace on mobile, but I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs a bit more efficient on PC.
---
Why do people buy gold bracelets? Also, why do people buy magic longbows? I‚Äôm just confused as to why I can sell ten thousand of an item instantly when said item doesn‚Äôt have any actual use.
---
With how OSRS operates, we're under constant inflation. A system to help equalize it is needed.
---
&gt;you're just gonna force...
---
Good! The GE heavily discourages player interaction. 
---
So if it's 1/100 then it's 1.3k per kill? 
---
I like the idea of the shield. The cape seems super strong and shouldn‚Äôt have the same defensive stats as some of the strongest capes in the game. I think the Obby sword special is kinda strong too, especially considering how strong Obby is with the entire set + B necklace. The staff concept seems kinda cool. Why not the obby maul though? Would actually give value to the shards since Obby mauls are constantly used for pking.
---
Hahaha I fr just met you yesterday and talked to you for like 10 minutes at the GE. Name was Sly Apollyon
---
Brews were removed almost immediately after that one guy posted to reddit. Also supposedly ‚Äúextremely‚Äù rare according to ash. 
---
This will travel.
---
h
---
It's faster on the PC, at least with my phone there was a slight delay with presses that doesn't exist on the PC. The mouse also better for precision than just tapping an area and hoping for the best.
---
Obviously you weren‚Äôt that interested in the new content or coming back, sounds like you let the people of reddit you talk lowly about also form an opinion for you. 
---
Have a great night üêë. 
---
For once in a blue moon Serene, I agree with you
---
How am I supposed to post negative comments toward you without a reddit account...?
---
Thoughts on adding a new item called a Twisted Log that can be fletched into a TBow? It has a 1/80k chance of showing up for every log you chop. Let's do something similar for every PvM unique too. If PvMers wanna feel entitled to skilling resources, then skillers should feel entitled to PvM loot.
---
What did the max stack increase from and to? 
---
Wow that made me laugh. That would be hilarious. 
---
‚Äúgreat support‚Äù
---
Yeah...don‚Äôt know bout that one
---
The original drop table was never polled, how about we poll that...
---
I just did that tonight after all the konar drama broke loose so had a good chuckle.
---
I think a good solution would be to make it a barrier you pass through rather than a door so more than 1 person can go at a a time
---
Addy and Rune Drags is DS2 (which you have a point there fuck that task, even if it's only 4 Runes) but MM2 is Demonics, which is a long task but worth for the money
---
&gt; Good! The GE heavily discourages player interaction.
---
How is "Selling T Bow 1.2B" for an hour gonna be valuable player interaction lol
---
Agreed the drops aren't worth Jamflex pls fix
---
This is how revolutions are started, comrade
---
Wait did they roll back nerfs?
---
&gt;A level 93 shouldn't be able to make as much off slayer as a level 126
---
How much money is only doing maxed boss slayer compared to doing konar? 
---
They could do doors like the stronghold of security that allow multiple people through at once.
---
What's that got to do with the price of fish in Catherby?
---
We need a sequel to this quest.
---
Legacy worlds where released a month or so after iirc
---
The game is not "luck based", it's based on grinding and statistics.
---
Ur nan
---
This is fucking perfect. Its so funny I cant even be mad and disagree its so true and hilarious.
---
Lance. Lance has no operating cost, so even though its like ~80mil you'll eventually save money with the 600k/hr cost of the BP. The speed is around the same except the lance is really easy to do the walk with. If you have the money, get the lance.
---
Can we add a 1/15000 chance of dwh drop from chopping trees ? You know it's 3x rare than from a lizard shaman, and it's such a small chance, it will hardly make a dent. :)
---
One person out of the 50k slaying got it, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal. 
---
If you can get up to the next threshold of loot yeah. Isn't it like every 250 points after 500?
---
They shouldn‚Äôt make a non afk method have lower xp rates
---
Imagine not doing herb runs on mobile when you have a spare 5 minutes at work
---
\&gt; However you can look at most if not all of the items on her RDT on GE Tracker and you'll see significant drops in price. 
---
Correlation does not imply causation. Dragon bones dropped in price significantly but where was it on the drop table? Dragon warhammer went from 65m to 50m, so did Konar drop table have 100x Dwarhammers? People were dumping/panic selling which ALWAYS happens in major updates. Take a good look at prices of items, almost anything that was not BIS or related to the hydra dropped in price.
---
Here's also a quick economics lesson for you. If the influx of herbs was actually significant enough to cause a reduction in prices then it will be a gradual decline, not a dip that occurs in 15 minutes.
---
The drop rate of the herbs was 1/100 and then another 1/50 to roll, so you would have to kill 5000 slayer monsters or roughly 50x tasks assuming 100/task. So in the many many hours of slaying, you get a chance of a 2m increase in profits. Now I know I'm not including the other drops but the point is it is not significant enough to cause "damage to the economy".
---
Exactly, in fact people would be praising the update as a nice alternative for med level accounts to get bonus gp from tasks where they would normally get nothing or very little.
---
If you give someone something thats a little bit op, they are going to cry and scream when you try to take it away from them. Look at how long NMZ has lasted in its current state, even though the mods have expressly stated they have a serious interest in nerfing it. Same with any other busted drop table like Zulrah or Revs.
---
I just want shit to make Skilling cheaper, x2500 noted mahogany planks when jagex?
---
You missed the point.
---
this. literally no reason to use konar if you have nieve (which is mid level and these fuckers cant get that in their head)
---
No1's been complaining about the value of the drops, people are complaining about the ridiculous amount of herbs. Replace the herb drops to something similar in value and no1 would've complained.
---
actually the shittest take I have ever witnessed
---
Pp--
---
i think it will be more expensive, hespori takes 32 hours to grow and only 1 kill every 32 hours and the seeds are rare af
---

Naa but it sits on top your plate because you‚Äôre a dipshit that doesn‚Äôt teach your pets boundaries. Probably the same type of person to let their dogs bark loud af all hours of the day and say ‚Äúlol dogs bark bro‚Äù
---
Its fucking ridiculous. Feels like a hoard of new players got this awakening inside them to MUST HAVE private server drops or ree the slayer master 90% of the people are using right now that gives an extra few hundred k per task on top of mob loot is DEAD CONTENT.

hell yeah brother.

I enjoyed the underground pass weirdly enough
---
It shouldn't have been torstols as the "big o boy" look what I got drop from the table. Having a 2mil+ drop on the table is fine but don't make it any raw resource that is suppose to be farmed by a skill, make it a unique. 
---
Nic is new drop table and panic selling
---
I just got the hat. I CANT FIND A PRICE.
---
I'm going based off the ideas that jagex actually proposed and polled for artisan.
---
I'm 100% sure that firemaking redwood logs is faster xp than Wintertodt. I'm not sure but it might be the case for lower leveled logs, assuming youre using the highest leveled log you can burn. It's more effort to burn logs, but the time you save can be used in other activities, which probably outweighs the wintertodt rewards.
---
What‚Äôs the drop rate of it?

If you consider people you've talked to for years as "randoms" you deserve to be lonely

Load rework.css
---
Because if it wasn't fixed those herb drops were gonna fuck this game up. I know you new players don't care about skilling supplies being shit out in to your hands but 200 torstols for a low level content drop is fucking emergency problem.
---
You can, I did a 150ish task there and I only received one GDT drop there, 100ish yew longs. Figured I would hit the table way more often. But whenever I get a Wyrm or Drake task I hit the GDT 3-4 per task @ a lower combat level...
---
Edit: Same thing happened at Kraken, hit the table only once, did cave krakens next and hit table 3 times. In my experience I‚Äôve received better drops and received them more often from the GDT than when fighting a 300+ level mob. 
---
Could be my rng, could be whacky code, dim. 
---
wait is that actually real??
---
I didn't say the game needs to change for me, I argued the point that even people with work and family have hours a day for gaming.
---
It's definitely not just useless one's.
---
Because that‚Äôs not the abyssal area. Use code ALR
---
Damned if they do, damned if they don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just happy there‚Äôs a new slayer master with a new style to switch up my wilderness tasks with. I got bored of the other masters in rs2. 
---
Therefore the only people doing her before and after the nerf were non efficient med level players not cannoning or barraging tasks.
---
Which means those same people will still probably use konar since shes still probably the best gp for non max players.

1. Ask for new content

6. Hate the nerf idea

I was even upset about them taking it away because thats freakiny exciting to have a chance at. But after a few MINUTES of thinking about it I was like shit.. I got a 20k drop at jellies AND 18 slayer points for the task. Only used 2 prayer pots. And I got the average jelly drop. I understand want the fuss is about because I felt it too. But thinking logically its not that bad. Plus they might buff it anyways. 
---
Depends on how efficiently you like to slay. If you are fine with just causal slaying I think it‚Äôs great. Just did a turoth task and had two 100k+ gp drops and a dragon arrowhead drop for another 100k
---
He must also be a Star Wars fan because two of the forsaken tower puzzles were from Kotor 1.  Did a pretty sick job implementing them into the quest and game.  
---
I'm actually really happy about the goblin drop tables, I think that for the most part they are enjoyable and accurate, but 2500x sarodomin brews would be a nice drop from goblins!
---
The scale system from Zulrah keeps a regular profit without screwing skillers or using alchables. Unfortunately the boss also does that but it doesn't need to. 
---
to add onto this, it was because the new farming guild has a teleport and it moved several of the others downward.
---

Don't cry and expect handouts Osrs is the most grindy mmo in existence.  Vorkath has barely any requirements along with Demon monkeys.  Unless of course your on an ironman.  You can get a max combat account within a month of nmz afk on mobile.  If they start devaluing higher level stuff now will end up like wow.
---
No...
---
I think I'm going to enjoy playing the new content because it's a game and I can do whatever I want. 
---
And What about a garg or wyverns task. You get that money per hour PLUS a possible 2m. Jesus christ. 
---
Get a red slayer helm then. 
---
It had to be nerfed for the time being. The way they implemented it was stupid. Having a 2.5m drop wasn‚Äôt the problem, the problem was that the big drops came in the form of supplies and materials. If they had bigger drops in the form of alchables or something that would have such a large effect on other facets of the game.
---
The Slayer master is still worth doing, it‚Äôs fun and the drops are still pretty good. They‚Äôll fine tune it work better in the future.

Smh traps are male, you're thinking of tgirls. Either way hot. 
---
Depends on how you play it, playing it at a theoretically maximal efficiency sure is challenging. Planning ahead and thinking outside the box as ironman/ultimate ironman is also challenging, especially early on. Solo Chambers of Xeric and Theatre of Blood is quite challenging. I find 3-ticking hunter to be challenging as well.

The update doesn't benefit the players who spend less time on the game. At the end of the day, players who spend more time on the game would reap the benefits before this type of droptable completely floods the market, making buyable skills basically free. The items on the table would drop significantly, and then you'd realise that a lot other content that is medium-level friendly would also be fucked because of this.
---
I suspect the more xp you get for a particular action, the higher the chance
---
One word: heavy ballista
---
Faux did complain about seeds being on that drop table..
---
You're right, but I think they still jumped the gun a bit on nerfing Konar. I think they should have waited at least a couple more days to let everyone get used to Konar and see for themselves the actual rarity of the big drops and the larger ramifications it would have on the game. Then they could adjust as necessary based on the feedback of players who had more informed opinions and weren't just basing their arguments off of knee-jerk reactions to change. 
---
Did you get the set? With the rates, I'm a bit surprised. But yah, it does look pretty neat.

Someone said they got hydras from steve so?

i took your first reply to me as your exit tactic. you enjoy yours, too.

Go back to Venezuela liberal! 
---
If they feel they need to change something due to balancing/integrity they aren't going to poll it.
---
Agree 100%
---
&gt; Jagex explicitly stated they aren‚Äôt going to balance content around Ironmen because they choose to play the game a certain way.
---
Thats just wrong. Many updates are specifically made ONLY to be used by ironmen, when that in reality shouldnt be the case because ironmen themselves chose to play as limited accounts, but updates play right into the hands of ironmen. Take empty buckets for sand as an example. Its almost weekly that you have ironman specific updates that will never be utilized by main accounts. Should JageX cater specifically to ironmen? No, you can argue they shouldnt. Are JageX catering specifically to ironmen? Yeah, all the time. 
---
&gt; can‚Äôt make super restores
---
Eh, what? Super restores are level 63, lol. And you totally overlook supplies as well which is one of the biggest factors of herblore for ironmen, rofl.
---
Perhaps because Reddit is among the worst platforms for discussion. Leaving the future of content at the mercy of up-votes doesn't help content that requires thorough discussion, this is why I prefer official forums to Reddit, but then again, RSOF is full of retarded teen girl mods that lock threads out of spite.

---
Players may have been basing their reactions off quicker reactions, but the J Mods weren't. If they weren't in favor of nerfing it, they wouldn't have done it so quickly. Also, a lot of the arguments were about what was being dropped rather than the rates, so if you don't like 200 herb drops regardless of the rarity it is not like waiting a few days will make you change your mind. And in general, it is better not to leave OP things in the game. Not saying the table was too OP, but it is safer to nerf while they were in the office and rebuff next week if needed than to leave it as is all weekend.
---
Start just north of the middle after it has done its 3 attacks and starts to spawn the lightning, then run north to the wall then west to the wall and you won't get hit by any.

I saw 6 t bow drops in 100 raids, so t bow is 3/50 drop rate because everyone not everyone was lucky, that‚Äôs just how statistics work, right? üôÑüôÑüôÑ
---
You can buy bonds with real money without breaking any rules, I think the rate is something like $2 per mil. Converting cash to gold in any other manner is a bannable offense. And converting gold to cash is always bannable. 
---
My previous post wasn‚Äôt advocating for buying/selling gold, just pointing out what you could get for a tbow if you decided to quit the game.
---
To be fair, taking a 100-200 torstol drop and making it a 1-4 torstol seed drop is much more than a 30% nerf. Hate it or love it the 30% figure is off
---
Cat?

What he said actually makes complete sense though.

he heard about the 2,500 noted saradomin pot drop

thought it was absurd

voiced his opinion

then jagex later on changed the drop table

You're assuming that the majority of players actually get 99 slayer

Hello friends, I am completing 'The Feud' quest on a new account. I have reached the part where Ali the Operator has asked me to rob the mayor's mansion. He was supposed to give me a key but I never got it, which is preventing me from progressing through this quest. When I speak to him again he says I already have the key... 
---
Is there any work around for this? I submitted a bug report but I am unsure what do to.
---
They do balancing and integrity updates without poll. That said, adding a new Mystic recolor probably should have been saved for a poll...
---
That drop was way too overkill, you'd be set on brews for a long time with that drop lol. Even the other drops were too good, mostly not because of GP value, but because of what items the GP value consisted of. 
---
I can see one guy chilling over there but 10 dudes totally decked out is hilarious af to me
---
Mm yes 2500 Sara brews is such fair, balanced content. Stop crying that you can't get rich in one low level slayer task now 
---
Either she‚Äôll like it or she wont. Don‚Äôt try to alter her experience of the game. Obviously keep her away from the stupid shit like gathering skills and runecrafting. 
---
The only good thing about prims is that they look good. Literally the last upgrade you should do on your account
---
nobody knows...
---
Good luck selling that for 3m lol

Hi yes jagex this one right here. Ban plz

Here is another clip of RoT Zulu trading b0aty ashes and immediately saying Bryson after.

I say have her chip away at the f2p quest, building skills when needed and maybe even gathering the items required instead of just buying them in the beginning, that way she can get a feel for the world.
---
"and was not polled"
---
Bitch it was added without a poll lmao
---
More like pro felching
---
I honestly like the old one with the sara brews. I personally enjoy Ironman mode and I do not enjoy playing the original. But I am in the boat where I enjoy the slow grind and achievement of ironman mode but I hate doing some of the dull grinds. Grinding herblore is one thing, and regardless of which, even getting the 2.5k brews drops isnt gonna make me drop herb, because hey I still need stamina potions, super combats, etc. I think it is a very rare boost if you do get as a ironman motivation to do some slower xp grind for chance of getting materials. The last thing i want to do when i get the levels to make brews is grind out mats. I want to enjoy the content that is brought out but I also dont want every Zeah update or content to be DOA. The original items were fine and thats the tradeoff. You get slow tasks that you cannot choose where to train slayer with the CHANCE of getting a surprise boost to loot. That boost to loot isnt common at all seeing as I grinded it for quite a few tasks, but it helps incentivize  playing the ACTUAL GAME and not just AFKING some boring task like Hellhounds when under 93 slayer. Especially getting such things as the brew drops allow us lower levels to have a little room to catch up for content on ironman mode. I dont like that there is a 30ish lvl gap between having the ability to make super restores and making the super restores useful. That allows us lower levels and non hardcore players to catch up. This with the reverted brew change would please us group ironman mode waitlist. Some reasons we want group ironman mode is because we all hate the mats grinding and we'd want to split up the roles and progress and experience new content instead of grinding out end game slayer to do mid-level content such as zulrah. Thats my two cents as a rs player since 2004 who got bored, quit, switched to WoW for pacing, and came back for ironman mode and kinda got bored at the lvl 70 mark in terms of stats.
---
If by reverting you mean realizing 2500 noted Sara brews in a drop table is retarded then maybe you have a point 
---
I'd rather keep it unique to Fossil Island as intended. Also, Karuulm is a sulphur volcano so the ash there may not be suitable for farming...
---
Kdt?
---
It wasn't a bugged drop though.
---
Konar drop table 
---
The difference being that nobody complained about bird houses for months and very rarely did people ask for it to be nerfed until brews became insanely cheap which was a while after the houses were already out. Konar was out for 6 hours and people thought her drop table was OP based off of literally a half dozen screen shots of super rare items.
---
have her watch you mine and smith her a set of armor, then drop her off at lumbridge
---
I suggest you go to his streams and see what he really said rather than joining the reddit circle jerk against him.
---
He was fine with the gp/ph. He was against the herb and ore drops. He is fine with seed drops. He thought the nerf was overkill. 
---
Shut the fuck up you little cunt and get your facts straight before I hurt you in the wilderness.
---
Konar has similar monsters, but very, VERY different tasks to duradel in terms of efficiency. Also, wildy slayer is substantially better points than konar. What I like about her is that she's a breath of fresh air, but without the kdt she wouldn't be solid, she would be dead content, used every 10th task at best.
---
The Return of Xeric. Calling it now. 
---
I'd say it is rewarding a good bit before 70 even; it is just around then when you start to get in the endgame kind of profits. But lower level tasks like Spiritual Warriors, Cave Horrors, and Spectres are pretty good money for their level and for a mid-level player.
---
But the comments that seem to suggest that Mid-Levels deserve easy 2M drops in some attempts to put them on par or closer to higher levels is kinda silly. It is kinda part of the progression that things scale upwards as you level, including earning potential.
---
I mean this is no different than most other stuff you build in your house. You don't get the gold leafs back if you remember a g alter. 
---
And I will be voting no if it is.
---
You don't have to obey orders from someone on the internet.
---
Dude we literally have people on other games subs discussing how extraordinarily lucky OSRS players are and how jealous it makes them that they actually get to have dev feedback and democratic choices in game progression and people are crawling up Jagex's ass because they're trying to balance a fucking loot table.
---
It's like ffs guys feel free to complain, but before you start being a total fucking douchebag while you're complaining maybe remember that the people who make this game treat this community better than any other game in the entire fucking world with just the ability of consistently consulting and working with players to make the best content possible before you start calling them retards for fucking up your loot tables. 
---
So what is your complaint exactly? You play less than other people and don't get to make the same progress as them?
---
Thanks :) it really does make it waaay more viable to slay at lower levels. I actually have been profiting quite a bit off these tasks. Its not the best obviously but hey 1m+ off a spectre task isnt bad. The coins drop im getting at least 1 on average usually per trip, and i usually hit the rare table several times throughout a trip so it can still net really decent loot. 
---
Honestly i still think konar is totally viable for lower level slayers like myself. Im 70 slayer and 96 combat so its better than nieve! Plus its so great seeing valuable drops on the floor. Doing fire giants and hellhounds aren't as bad now. 
---
someone should edit all those distracted driving PSAs into wilderness awareness 
---
For what it's worth, the nerf killed my enjoyment of the new content. I just dipped out on my current task to go back to what I was doing so that this stuff could get sorted out before I go back to Slayer.
---
This is easy to avoid. Just stay out of the wilderness if you don‚Äôt want to be pked. 
---
sadly many people will vote yes, because thats how this community is now. They like easyscape, they like the best weapon for everything for a low price (Since hydra is easy to farm with zulrah-like droptable excluding rares, the lance will never be very high priced)
---
People with high karma typically post things worth seeing.... that‚Äôs how reddit works. Kind of annoying when people bash karma when even if they don‚Äôt use it and see it as a popularity contest, I still use it as a tool frequently
---
Dhcb is better at vorkath but that doesn't mean the lance needs a buff. The lance is still great from raids 1 and all other dragons besides vorkath. 
---
Dude do you want a donation??
---
Yet you can't grasp the concept of what it means for something to be random.
---
Can I please get a video recording of all your tears please? It's getting priceless dude!! :D
---
Fastest safest, yes. Very quick too at the lower levels, I think I spent about 200k (maybe less, I can‚Äôt remember) from level 37 to 52, using big bones.
---
I disagree, I think it was good for lower lvl players and the only people complaining about it are the people that have advanced far enough in the game that they don't get any advantage from it. 
---
Who cares? It's supposed to be pointlessly rare fashionscape. 
---
Weirdly you can't use bones to peaches on Wyrm bones. I was trying out a task without pray and with bones to peaches to see if I could stay there indefinitely but apparently not. It seems intentional too, they have a line of text saying that the bones are not appropriate. 
---
Shit i'm in exactly the same boat, would love to know this as well. 
---
yeh ikr its sad they are going to poll a 30% buff, it will certainly pass. Rendering the DHCB fucking useless probably, and even scythe useless at raids 1. If the DHlance becomes 30% ima quit this game, fuck it. Every single update we are heading more and more to fucking rs3.
---
BuT CosMeTiCs
---
Of course I should be a more reasonable like you or OP and join in on a witch hunt against a single streamer as if there weren't thousands of comments on the front page saying the exact same thing.
---
Thats definetly not a toxic thing to do? Witch hunts over a 30% nerf on content that wasn't even out for a day is something well adjusted people do. 
---
Lmao.
---
Unplayable. Someone made 200k in probably a couple hours of doing slayer. Not nerfed enough. 
---
BTW Fish scaled to lvl is BS, i can fish shark and i get lobsters as drop wtf is that hm??? thats not scaled to my fishing lvl is it.....
---
Without animation smoothening, its actually the same crush animation as any staff
---
the point is the table is worthless. the most common drop is at best 1/1,1150 and typical will just be worth 60k. that works out to like 2-5k gp bonus per task. 
---
I mean I'm just a casual player and until the nerf it was a great excuse for me to try places I hadn't been, using methods I hadn't used, and I found I actually needed to use the Wiki in some instances.
---
Not everyone is a max, not everyone is an iron meme, some people are still making it through this shit for their first time on a lvl 100 with not maxed everything. This was explained fairly well somewhere else, but it's the ability to have the rush of a nice drop from like a boss at either a not-so-boss level or for a not-so-smart (see;me) player). 
---
Did they discuss doing this? Where, might I ask
---
Completely over-nerfed. Entire drop table reworked when there was maybe one or two problematic things that should've been changed (herbs --&gt; seeds, remove brews). I was hyped for this update and finally was enjoying slayer, but after 2 days Konar will already be dead content. Shame.
---
So many toxic people coming out of the woodwork. It's just a game, people...
---
Many people suggest Ironman mode as a way to fix whatever obsessive ways people have about tracking xp and such. 
---
Some people have to do Ironman to accomplish this, and that‚Äôs great. But it comes across as preachy sometimes since not everyone has to use this 
---
False they don‚Äôt vote yes to every poll a decent amount of mains and people that don‚Äôt pk instantly vote no to any pvp updates and it‚Äôs bs
---
We both know you can't simply quit runescape. You're really overreacting to one weapon used for &lt; 10% of npcs. No one said they are going to poll the change. Ash confirmed it COULD be polled. He always does that when asked if something can be changed. If its possible he says it CAN be changed/polled. He rarily stats if it actually will be polled or changed. Just calm down and hope for the best

yeah honestly i wish when they released 2007scape that they just left it as it was and never updated it but thats just my opinion. all the new stuff just takes away from the nostalgia which is why i started playing in the first place
---
because the people that already have it are crying
---
I think you might be up to something 
---
I have no idea who these people are and what they did but it sounds bad
---
the recent outrage from the high level community wasn't the 1/x rates or even the gp it was what was being dropped. Being herbs instead of seeds, magic seeds in general, and the brew drop

Farm run = 7 seeds, assuming a yield of 10 per seed which is average, 30 farm runs will give you 2100 herbs. Dunno where you‚Äôre getting ‚Äú2100 seeds‚Äù from lol. Also you forego a lot of seed tasks by doing Konar when herbs were in so you replace the seeds you would have got and farmed with herbs lol.

I say make the cape (aka the shard) untradeable. People shouldn't be denied a cape better defensively then a skillcape because they wont grind a 99 out.  
---
I'd also keep the cape at +12. This would make it so we can have maximum defense possible without needing an inferno cape.  
---
Lastly I think an untradeable cape will be picked up by almost everyone. A small grind for a +12 defence is comparable to fighter torso.  
---
TLDR: Make shard untradeable, it becomes the equivalent fighter torso for cape slot
---
Not a bug, you need to pay the foreman 2500 gp per 10 min. After 60 you wont need to pay him
---
;);) and cute
---
Being that the meta for Ironman is to do birdhouses for pretty much all of 99 hunter and farming and herblore it really wouldn't impact anyone's account that much, I'm sitting on about 10K brews that'll never go through just because of bird houses
---

hydras can only be assigned by konar and besides that benefit, duradel is better in every way possible. I really don't think anyone will be actively using konar except ironmen.
---
You need to be on this sub or twitter to actually have knowledge of the game because jmods don‚Äôt use their own website to tell us anything it‚Äôs always twitter or something here 
---
Reach out to the actual community that only play and dont spam reddit with low effort memes. The people that dont use twitter or anything else. This can be achieved by adding some sort of community thing here rather than just this black screen with a MotW and red button. You have the ability to actually talk with the real community get feedback and suggestions without having to shift through the cesspool of immature memes. I really care about this game, but if nothing changes, its doomed. 
---
This is my new go-to comeback
---
High levels are complaining its not worth it. Well what do you expect? The master has no requirements basically, its not meant to be an end game master. Its absolutely a bridge to end game masters and a great alternative. Honestly im enjoying it so far and the loot really isnt that bad. Im actually making money doing slayer now and to me, thats a great thing. 
---
For a second I thought that said 2kc
---
Thanks
---
Oh, I got keylogged through a dodgy twitch link.
---
Yes I have, have you?
---
The 20% only applies to dragon-type monsters, as would the 30%, so how is that op? It's niche is to be powerful for dragons only.
---
We pay we say we gay
---
Who‚Äôs the dude that drew this and originally posted this? I want to see their other work. I really love this drawing 
---
Lol I wish
---
Don't be silly, it's one big hive mind.
---
Yeah, but if you are being given the money needed to sink out of the game it doesn't make a difference. 
---
Read the entire comment instead.
---
What‚Äôs the point of the coffer then?
---
 
---
Or does the coffer come into play at level 60?
---
Personally had no issues with the value of the drops. Moreso my issue was with what they were dropping in general. The sheer number of raw herbs could have been 3-10 seeds instead of making the farming guild seem like dead content with the number of herbs being dropped. The existence of magic seeds on the table for previous nerf having to do with bosses having it on the table. The brew drop with the recent boss/bird house nerf. Otherwise imo the value was fine for the time being. As overall i don't think the 2m drops were as common as people think since it was day 1 saturation 
---
He got pucked. Half punched half fucked. Hospital won‚Äôt be a bad idea tbh
---
Yes it is I can pick where I slay, konar just sends me to non cannonable non efficient spots.
---
This account is trash, get 99 rc and ppl will go nuts
---
Nope, thats payment for the dwarves to run the machine(72k an hour btw) and you pay the foreman  for access
---
The same, just less reeee
---
Pvmupdate, people get rid of pvp stuff 
---
People were making a shit tonn of money at a low/med level off of konar alot of which was in the form of skilling items like herbs and 2500 THOUSAND BREWS which was hotfixed

---
and i'm 7k dry of one on my ironman :)
---
Some of y'all need to calm the fuck down. The table was OP. It needed a nerf. I don't agree with how heavily it was nerfed, and the mods aren't going to let the most anticipated update of the year become dead content. If you think otherwise, you're retarded.
---
Yes because developing and releasing training methods that are subpar to multiple other methods already in game is winning. 
---
Claw at 33kc too 
---
I have no idea why OP is even complaining. I have 99 farming and couldn't give a shit about more patches being added exp wise. Tithe farm is better exp hourly than the non-tree patches, and the extra exp from the tree patches saves a few days. 
---
Some people have a life, so I think it's good.
---
Changing keys is allowed. 
---
So.. How much should they make and what are your reasons for them making that much
---
It only sold for 2m
---
Changing keybinds is allowed yes
---
Get mining to 60 and we got a deal
---
The dude spent hours on his stream trying to prove someone wrong and call them a liar for getting the brews drop. Fuck that crybaby
---
Integrity changes need no poll.....
---
She's ok if you're a casual player who just AFKs the game on the side while you do something else because if you're just AFK slaying, it doesn't really matter where you do it.
---
If you going for max points, it doesn't outcompete Wildy Slayer, if you're going for profit, it doesn't outcompete being able to just spam profitable tasks, even moreso if it's the boss versions like Demonics, DKs, Cerb, etc., and it definitely doesn't outcompete XP rates at the best areas.
---
Sure it can be...they just have to find a proper balance depending on how much effort the method takes and how afk it is. For example sulliscep woodcutting that was released with fossil island. Ticm woodcutting is like 140k exp/ hr or something...and afk red wood is like 60-70k. Sullicep gave us a medium that was somewhat afk and required some effort at 90-100k exp/hr
---
Konars loot table seriously needed fixed and for those who don't speak up then how is anyone to know.  Can you read minds?
---
As a software developer at a company that is 10 time smaller I make 70 a year. You would think with the money jagex brings in, average wage or not, they would give their employees at least 50 a year. 38 isn‚Äôt even something you‚Äôd consider an option in the US. 
---
Yes the economy‚Äôs are different but any program developer job should pay better then that. Most people have a college degree. 
---
If you're power training, use full obsidian with bneck. If you're doing content, use fighter torso, helm of neitiznot/slayer helm, glory/fury/torture/salve(i), granite gloves/recipe for disaster gloves, prayer scroll, warrior/berserker ring, obsidian cape, dragon boots, some legs, don't worry about a best shield, get 65/65 and get a dragon defender.
---
Yes.

Ah okay, so basically just people looking for things to be upset about, as usual. Thanks for the explanation! Can't wait to have time to log on and try it out soon 
---
No not at all. A streamer just voiced an opinion that many agreed with. 
---
Thank you!
---
Commenting because I had the same question.
---
Man yo downright disrespectful. I log maybe 1-2 hours a day on this game for the 3 days a week I play. Just because I care about the game doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt have a life.
---
How much is redwood seed worth in GE?
---
People are calling her dead content since she isn't best gp/hr anymore when she was never meant to be. She is a mid tier slayer master who should be compared to chaelder. Not Duradaddy or Nieve/steve
---
It's for realism.
---
Ironic considering the drops for Konars RDT weren‚Äôt polled either.
---
Soon you'll realize that pet drop is best drop :) gz!
---
That isn't the settlement. The settlement is the one south in Molch
---
Yes, just make sure not to check the health before you get the contract. 
---
I got a hydra leather drop 12 hrs after the update, sold for 14m and then noticed a bit later it was at 22m. I don't know what the deal is with the big price fluctuations both up and downwards. Maybe some of the initial hydra hype where everyone was killing it died down a bit and the supply decreased? I imagine a lot of people will wait for the price to go down and stabilize before buying the ferocious gloves/lance and they're BIS gear so the demand is for sure still there
---
And rs3 have rendered 98% of it items useless and lead to being be left on the ground 
---
Yes
---
Hmmmmm, for sure the one I‚Äôve seen the most is replace herbs with seeds and get rid of noted skilling resources.
---
No it's called you're skulled. You probably got skull tricked by attacking another player dressed as the saradomin mage. You don't just lose all of your items unless you are skulled. That's the mechanic you're talking about. When you are skulled you lose all of your items. 
---
50/50
---
https://services.runescape.com/m=news/konar-loot-table-balancing?oldschool=1
---
Level 100 monsters give 1/100 chance of accessing RDT on old table. The table was out of 104 total weighting. Each of the herbs had a weighting of 1. 
---
This means that on average every 1/10,400 level 100 monsters killed would give the 100x herb drops, and 1/3466 to give you one specific 100x herb drop. In other words you'd on average need to kill 10,400 monsters to get the torstol [thing being moaned about here,] snapdragon and ranarr drops. 
---
I don't know what sort of tasks you get assigned, but "every couple" tasks isn't either 1/10,400 [all herbs on avg] or 1/3,466 [one specific.] At a minimum you'd expect a mid-level player to take 35 hours to kill almost 3,500 level 100 monsters. A high level player might be able to do it in ~20-25 hours. 
---
And its not like those hours are even being efficiently spent, either. Mid-level slayer isn't especially profitable or fast. And Konar assigns strange, not always profitable or good tasks. 
---
TL;DR no, you didn't get a herb drop "every couple of tasks" under the old drop table. Even assuming you got assigned 250 level 100 monsters every single time it would still be 14 tasks. Much more likely to be ~20 per drop on average. 
---
fletching makes 99 firemaking take longer for very minimal cash gains and xp in a skill thats literally zero time during agility.
---
lulw remember when ags was 50 mil
---
I just got medium mid level and have no clue how to make money, I just did the quest for Ibans staff, I wanna explore the new update , I wanna try the content too  take my opinion !!!!!
---
because todt is slower than just burning redwoods.
---
I only skimmed this, but these ideas look very promising. This is a rare suggestion post with actual good ideas. I cant believe that people don't understand that the problem with Konar's drop table isn't the value of the items, but the type of the items. All these fucking brainlets crying about "dead content" just want skilling handouts =/
---
Jesus Christ that‚Äôs more than I make on an Abyssal Demons task
---
Its helpful for slayer streaks at least
---
I‚Äôm unsure how easy it is now to obtain the dragon sword but that‚Äôs still a better weapon for stab over hasta. A bit silly really.
---
I've seen him before, his name is JJJJJJJJJ right?
---
I found hellhounds really didn‚Äôt roll the kdt as much as other creatures
---
!remindme 12 hours
---
wtf so op. jagex plz nerf shaman drop table
---
This is so true.
---
can clicking links get you trojan like this without entering info?
---
The main thing is that you can't cannon most Konar tasks.  
---
You're also unable to do alternate boss tasks for certain tasks on the list, like you could with a normal master.  
---
The alternate rewards need to be pretty good to justify a 1/3\~ loss of slayer/combat xp.
---
He asked for a change of the droptable, used his stream to gain attention from jmods etc.
---
It's not about what he did, it's how he handled himself afterwards. When people were outraged (because the change was a nerf, making konar dead content after just a single day) Faux didn't explain he didn't want a nerf, just a change. What Faux did was he hid behind his paying viewers, all sucking his dick obv. while at the same time only focussing on those who were over the top hating.
---
The best example is in his twitter post, the guy literally guys "okay im sorry BUT this guy told me to kill myself so SORRY NOT SORRY LOL". Lost alot of respect in my eyes.
---
See the trick here is to not get ratted 
---
Problem with polling is that players don't always know whats best for the game, and often they just vote for whats good for themselves rather than whats good for everyone's gameplay. I think the best system is to have a group of highly experienced and elite players which jmods can consult. 
---
15m torstols in 24 farm runs. Teach me your secrets
---
The game has been fucked for a long time, this is just icing on the cake at this point.
---
It would've still dropped. 
---
You're still massively dumb. 
---
This is hilarious, because no MMO in the world can have low/mid lvl content that's meta. Because if it's 2m per hour for low/mid lvl, think of how much GP/hr it will be for someone with tbow granite cballs and max cape/gear.
---
This is why, if the drop table remained, ALL that loot would hyper crash. It's an MMO for gods sake. If you want to make mils per hour, you have to improve your stats.
---
when it first came out i hit the drop table 4 times in one task.
---
Seeds are expensive.
---
Do not like the obsidian sword buff, as obby set is already borderline best-in-slot for training.
---
Weird flex but okay 
---
Remapping isn‚Äôt macroing, you‚Äôll be sweet
---
Can confirm I'm only rank 48,461 slayer at level 95
---
I. Am. Groot. 
---
get 85 farming
---
If you want high level rewards, do high level content.
---
Why the fuck do you think you should get 1-2m drops from doing shit like fire giants?
---
And I'm saying this as a guy who got 165 torstols from Nechs on my HCIM.
---
Dont people use reddit? Or look before posting? Theres literally 4 other posts that are almost identical
---
Yes that was me trying to pump the price.
---
Youll be sweet, famous last words b4 ban
---
The nerf barely impacted the gp/h and fixed some of the problems with slayer fucking replacing farming.
---
People saying its a bad thing have no fucking idea what they're talking about.
---
I have 97 farming. I'm just pointing out that it shouldn't be like that.
---
Well I didn't mean net lol, but you can assume 52 herbs a run with 7 patches unlocked, 52*24*10894 = 13595712
---
Bit off topic but I recently found out mage actually works really well against rune dragons if you only have a couple on task, might be worth checking out if you don't have rapier/lance and you're low on points.
---
I dont see how im missing the point. Guess what. OSRS is designed to be a grindy game and everything you owe is because you earned it. Not choosing to boss is your own choice and you should understand the opportunity cost of not doing bossing. Kdt does not need to be dropping 2.2m of herbs. A drop in herb prices will lead to a drop in potions. I have faith Jagex will find a happy median. And I fully understand how rng works I know you dont hit the kdt every kill but i did 3 task with konar and hit it 7 times. I made almost 1.5m off those drops. That gave me about 50k xp lets says. Now it takes about around 1m to get to 75 slayer and lets say you hit the table based off what ive experienced (bad sample ik). Thats 30m off low level slayer (granted this is probably a bad example but kinda gets my point across). Thats kinda ridiculous if you ask me. I hit the actual rdt way less that than. Also not everything has to be best gp/hr or xph. Konar simply could be for people trying to be less efficient and want to make a little more money (400-500k max per kdt hit) and enjoy the game more or the ones that want to do hydra. 
---
Practice your yours and you‚Äôres please.
---
Konar is not dead content.
---
It's still meta for Ironmen.
---
Just because you cant get 1.8m drops with your full rune and dscim at fire giants anymore, doesn't qualify it as dead content.
---
Pretty sure he counts as both but maybe the game doesn‚Äôt count his lair as catacombs of Kourend as you have to teleport from catacombs to get there
---
But what about the level 70 guys that are getting 80 hellhound kills per hour and have a 1/100 chance of hitting the drop table and then a 1/100 chance of getting 100-200 ranarrs? Its unfair that they can get the drop once every 120 hours man!  
---
/s (In-case it wasn't obvious) 
---
my kills w/ bp+addy are a constant 2 minutes.
---
bows slightly faster but not by much.
---
Someone doesn't want to go to the gem mine or make his jewelry I think.
---
Marble blocks would be a hilarious drop, idk if it would make sense but it could work.
---
But don't you keep 3 items?
---
Yes I agree I really don't know what I was thinking
---
Pretty sure he counts as both but maybe the game doesn‚Äôt count his lair as catacombs of Kourend as you have to teleport from catacombs to get there. That message says kill them in Kourend not that he‚Äôs killing the wrong monster. If it‚Äôs was the wrong monster he wouldn‚Äôt get a message at all
---
2. Shift
---
You'd keep 3 coins. Not the entire stack. 
---
Reddit? 
---
Reddit didn't vote for Artisan btw. It was an ingame poll IIRC.
---
Did you think that maybe contracts only give Fruit Tree's when you are 85 farming?
---
I play to have fun and do things I enjoy in game. If I'm not having fun I don't play and do something else with my time. 
---
Non-iron with 780......
---
Nah lol, I‚Äôve quit  osrs. I‚Äôm glad people are happy to play it still, and that it‚Äôs been giving new life over the years. I myself just look at the subreddit outta curiosity now.
---
Ahhh good to know
---
Insight... you sure about that?
---
Drop table is still perfectly fine for ironmen.
---
Isn't dead content.
---
Then:you haven't played at that account for long time &gt;jagex noticed &gt;released the name &gt;somebody took the name and you are logging to dmm in world. 
---
Why don't they boost it? I am still fairly early on in the game and running out
---
Hahah cats need constant attention one minute, then don‚Äôt want shit to do with you the next. 
---
Nah I had to plant a lantadyme herb for a hard contract.
---
ive put too much time in to quit
---
To be fair if it's good then it has to be like this ,perfectly balanced , as all things should be .
---
Why should a mid-level slayer boss have the chance to drop like 1.6m in loot? That‚Äôs high level/end game territory. Should be a chance at like 160k imo
---
Fwiw I also think Hydra should have been given to duradel but I understand the lore reasoning for giving it to konar 
---
Everybody clap your hands cha cha cha cha cha....
---
I'd say partner Slayer but it's a joke (in terms of functionality) you'll be able to slay the same tasks though. You guys are too low combat to duo most bosses, which is what majority of this game duo combat is.
---
They don't mean exclusively fruit trees, just that they become valid contracts once you have access to the plot.
---
I just wanted a grind other mmos were having a hard time offering. Im from the really early days before paying for members was even a thing and only recently came back after the rest of the mmo genre has gone to hell and the ability to play on my phone when not at home or in a long wait time game like Total War is a huge plus. It sounds like you've just reached a bit of burnout and need something else for a little while. 
---
That's not how any of this works, retard.
---
Nice.
---
Volume changes like that are due to merchers
---
/u/rot_nico
---
you're proud of this?
---
As somebody who loves farming, I agree its a godsend. I felt crippled as an ironman before because I just couldn't get good seeds without doing consistent Zulrah or Mole kills. Now I can perpetually farm and its everything I could ask for. 
---
REEEEEE
---
And the drop rate on the lance?
---
So basically you just dont have it in you? All your saying is "I could but i dont want to". You either can, or you cant. Theres no inbetween, you can just stop playing as a failure, or finish an account. 
---
Cus it's not worth the hassle, xp/h is bad and profit is low 
---
Yeah agree, i don't care at exp/hr. I just want money. Im still gonna skip the witchaven hellhound spot. 
---
It's a shame their drops suck, since these things look so cool. It gets a 10/10 rating for animation from me
---
I care
---
Use the website, not the app
---
dat future Ironman loot down the drain tho
---
Nieve is dead to me
---
If you know what I mean
---
Or maybe it‚Äôs the old English definition of gay and it makes him very happy.
---
The consensus seems to be that blowpipe is faster but more expensive. I haven't used dhcb there but I think the meta (excluding tbow) would be to bring both and only use the dhcb when you do the last hit of a phase.
---
Had 33 bronze drags as a task with a dhcb and 98 range I got the task done on 1 sip of extended anti fire
---
Funny thing is I‚Äôm pretty sure the main reason people worshiped ash, at least initially is literally because he looks funny. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs not a great dev but still what got Reddit on his dick at first was his awkward appearance 
---
made himself look mad stupid then deleted the post LMAO. Lesson learned.
---
Go to Steve then?
---
on that note, an imbued heart and 2.5k brews are not exactly comparable - regardless of average drop rate
---
U wot m8?
---
Dhcb is better overall if you can only use one, but starting with dhcb and switching to bp once ruby starts falling off might be even better than switching to diamonds.
---
You're telling me you don't like spirals on your parasol?
---
You wouldn't have cared if it was a 1/100 chance to get 2 herbs, but a 1/10000 to get 200? REEEEEE
---
There's no reason for the slayer drop table to be so top heavy though.
---
Things like GWD and Imbued Heart from Superiors are fine to be top heavy because that's **supposed** to be what it drops.
---
There's no reason for the best drop from a random hellhound on a slayer task to be 7mil of brews.
---
I think they either need to introduce unique drops for the top end or spread out the wealth a bit.
---
the location thing is kinda cool.
---
It'd be enough to have quest requirements longer to complete than the weekend. But I don't oppose. :) 
---
Well I'm not sure how many people say it like that to you but I imagine a fair amount of people would say "you can pay to cut down the tree u know?" wouldnt they? 
---
Eh 15% to halve damage is a 7.5% damage decrease which is proportional to giving 2 extra food (not brews) instead of the dps bonus.
---
The 15% accuracy is also under a 7.5% damage increase which is honestly not that good. Assuming 50% accuracy it is a 7.5% increase on average, but most slayer it is not the case- if it was better than a defender it would be slight. 
---
Reminder that it doesn't need a buff. It just needs new content to give it targets. 
---
hi :)
---
who cares about how they look if loot isn't worth the time to do the task to enjoy how they look
---
Nice stuff!
---
Great game 
---
Yeah I like the location thing too, but let's whenever you get blue dragons, you'd like to do Vorkath.
---
20 slayer points would solve the problem.
---
I was looking for exactly this tyty
---
seriously though youre just wrong.
---
skilling drops ruin the economy 
---
Weird flax but okay.

* Bloodhound pet
---
* 200M in Agility and Hunter
---
* Max cape if I can be bothered
---
Rs3 mods reworked 2 skills without game breaking bugs. The only thing that went wrong was that ge was down for couple of minutes(although that was because everyone received extra service for Month for free) and hard clue spot in yanille can't be dug from the house. Other than those 2 minor things the rework has been good (oh yeah and diaries). 
---
No new changes - I'm confused as well.
---
Initially crash was due to bot dumps from winter break while jagex was gone.  
---
At this point I'd guess everyone is training slayer or other new content and nobody is chinning for range xp currently.
---
Add unique flatpack tables so its a table table.
---
Now don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm extremely greatful to those that are genuinely trying to help, and I know that not everything I do is ‚Äúxp efficient‚Äù, but honestly I just enjoy playing. At this point at least, maxing just isn‚Äôt a goal. 
---
goodbye
---
such a normie post
---
No worries!
---
Nieve's cave was equivalent of a private server slay dungeon and was fixed due to player complaints. Currently the monsters are in more reasonable areas that make sense more lore wise.  
---
The title is √ºber cute tho.
---
rendering issues while bank interface is open iirc
---
Everyone's freaking about the nerf. Yeah it sucks. But I just finished a 225 nech task in the slayer tower from Konar. I hit the table 6 times. I ended up getting an extra 450k. The last wyvern task I had I still hit the table 5 times and walked away with an extra 400k. Kieran even said they're not done balancing it out and they will analyze more data over the next few days. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I like the location slaying thing, maybe adding boss-task-locations for X-amount of slayer points from Konar could do the trick.
---
What. The bot isn't wiki bot, its automoderator, bot that is available for every subreddit mods to automate some work. They have most likely made the bot trigger at word wiki to say the pinned comment. 
---
Sorry they nerfed the drop table this morning, few things were removed most notably the karma you're trying to farm.
---
Focusing on other hobbies and lifestyles isn't an excuse for easier progression in game. That'd ruin the entire spirit and point of RS. 
---
If you need GP, play efficiently and prioritize the high ROI money making methods. Alts are preferred.
---
I am a member and am playing osrs for about a month now...
---
He should be the best for exp. The new slayer master is less convenient and slower xp so it should have some incentive otherwise it becomes dead content. Now that the the drops are shit most people will just go back to their original slayer master. Great job reddit! 
---
Jagex could have made a better drop table that wouldn't crash the market but crying for it to be nerfed was autistic af. 
---
Im the same tho unfortunately not everyone cant be woox. You just got to keep practicing. Its been getting better but i still struggle with some bosses. I just keep going back and watching multiple guides until i get it. Or sometimes i grind out better gear ie i recently upgrade acb for dhcb to help me go for my tbow. Thats the fun in the game tho.
---
Exactly. you know what me and my friend did in pvp today? we battled in bronze armor to bronze 2h as a finishing weapon and were using vengeancr. Then we were bridding in Ahrims but only using air strike. Then after two hours of that we went to the chaos alter and specced out pkers (actually killed them) with it nothing but a dds. We skilled we killed mole. Runescapen is an open game. It's what makes this game amazing as hell. People need to relax.
---
Sure thing mate, youve done plenty of research by making an estimate by comparing osrs streamers to fortnite streamers
---
Then you need to farm more
---
There are lots of NPCs helping you during that fight, its possible to wait until theyve nearly killed it and then finish it off
---

---
Are you okay, friend?
---
Yea lmao fuck that guy

We live in a society.

**BOTTOM TEXT**
---
I bring 10 restores 4 range pots and rest brews and get 10+ kills a trip without t bow. I think this would be a great update and similar to the Fremmy one
---
You're missing my point. The issue isn't so much what they drop (although I'm not a massive fan of noted drops from any non-humanoid monster tbh), it's the fact that monsters suddenly drop something completely different simply because you've been told to kill them by a different person to normal. Gp/hr has nothing to do with the issue at hand either, the problem is simply how artificial the integration of the new drop tables feels.
---
[deleted]
---
Nah I mean i'm just too low leveled and i can only play maybe an hour or 2 per day. maybe 2-3 times a week. It's going to be a really long time till I can get there. This update is helping me get the gear to hopefully start bossing. I just wish they would buff it a little. They nerfed it hard

&gt;No need to poll it

raids drop a twisted bow so is it really bad that a fire giant drops 5000 rune platebodies?
---
Isn't like 80% of those tasks garbage gp to begin with?
---
Not everybody cannons every task you pinhead.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more about the drops for an ironman . Getting 140 prayer  pots instantly for killing a slayer mob? Might aswell call is ezman mode. Can‚Äôt speak
---
For normal accounts tho 
---
"Here, I tell you a pointless overexaggeration to prove my point"
---
The classic.
---
yea you can get corp into your van and bust your nut over it.
---
Lol it was only a 30% nerf for the weekend like they said in their post. Tbh if they would of released the current kdt from the get go no one would be upset. I was basically the same time schedule for my first ~2 years of playing because of school and work. Also try doing farm runs for some money it would take like 15 mins once you have the teles and you can make decent money per run.
---
But there is, for one, the person has to go do the birdhouse run, not to mention you're getting 1 seed per nest and more times than not you're finishing a birdhouse run with oak and willow seeds, super low tier. Not to mention even if you get a good seed you still need to go grow it.
---
it was not 1/3k and its not about the money its the items that should not be dropped by npc's
---
How? You set yourself up as a target, and an incredibly easy one. 
---
Why? Well, your bank is missing, no?
---
Im nearly 300 dry on B ring, it hurts, ive had d axe, 2 warrior rings, a ton of rockshell armour
---
Blast mine is way better gp/hour since the mines give you a +10 mining boost (you can get rune ore from level 75 and onwards). It's not that much better xp/hour (about 45k) than mlm (about 42k or less), in my experience.
---
If they added a tbow drop to chickens at 1/2,147,483,647 drop rate I honestly would not care.

&gt;OSRS already uses grand exchange price in their current death mechanic.
---
Then it should be reverted to using high alch prices.
---
- makes 6m
---
- ‚ÄúNot worth the fucking time‚Äù
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
Yeah i agree no should be aloud to talk shit about Hitler.
---
Because they can't accomplish anything else in life. That, and greedy companies that buy accounts with high karma count to shill their awful product easier. 
---
I prefer using dhcb simply because it just feels more relaxed. not as punishing for movement etc. Theyre about equal, I wouldn't stress over which to use. dhcb i believe nets more gp/hr than blowpipe, and the kills on average are only slightly slower.
---
Probably because they breathe through their mouths and haven't felt the touch of their gender preference in millennia. Another possibility is that they have accepted the only way they can orgasm is by pking defenseless crafters, because they have accepted the fate they'll never get laid so long as they walk this earth or ride around on their motorized cart because they are too fat to walk. 
---
Cringe
---
&gt; objecting to yout statement bucko
---
Are you stuck in a middle school? Throwing insults towards someone isn't a valid objection, nor an argument to one's initial statement. If you defend his foolishness, you're literally delusional.
---
Noone is starving, just going back to Duradel/Nieve away from Konar being that Konar is dead content.
---
Wouldn't be "cringe" if you weren't so biased and delusional. I'm posting a humorous joke, dunce.
---
Faux said he didnt want to change the gp/h from konar, he only wanted the mobs to not drop supplies wich is absoloutly legitament...pvm isnt supposed to give supplies like that
---
I'm not sure I understand what you mean with that, I believe they also should have waited until Monday for the "hype" to die down before they nerfed, it just became a hype train and they reacted too quickly. The drops were no where near too much imo. I do like others ideas of having it drop more hands on items, such as seeds instead of herbs but overall value of the items was good.
---

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have the same opinion as me then fuck off.‚Äù

He said a girls, gosh, gotta learn some anatomy. Go suck a non-feminine dick
---
Well it's targeted harassment and nothing funny about it. I don't endorse it. Should be obvious by anyone who's slightly sympathetic and normal.
---
No, but Konar is still around 5 months of dev work for some of the people who worked on it.
---
Don't expect the average person to watch wrestling lmao, terrible "sport". 
---
Bug report it.
---
To be fair,  I wouldn't mind an idle version of runescape, as long as it was a completely separate server to the main game. I don't know,  I like idle games. 
---
you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, right? wilderness and free trade was removed back then, because of the overwhelming amount of bots. removing free trade effectively saved Jagex from bankruptcy. 
---
They are incapable of making good decisions without us? seriously? multi-multi-million dollar company can't make a decisions without redditors, okay, sure. 
---
you can not have a product and develop it without feedback, then you will 100% get sh√¨t. they ask for alot of feedback and they make a great product. They know what they're doing, and you don't. stop shitposting.
---
Could you share the blank template with us?
---
It is because the new drop table wasn't ezscape or even OP. The chance to get a 2m drop from hellhounds was like 1/10000. People like you just saw some screenshots on reddit and panicked over nothing. Nobody is complaining about being able to get a smouldering stone right? 
---
They could have tweaked it a bit, but now they have killed most of the incentive for lower level players to go to Konar.
---
Thanks lmao
---
The nerf hardly changed anything, the tables still fucked and op for what it is.
---
Just used lance at OLM, seemed incredibly underwhelming, slight edge over tent whip... Definitely not worth the extra coin IMO
---
Dear Lord Hunt4x, where is your brain?
---
It‚Äôs $12 now...
---
Wow Serene, get with the times.
---
Okay, that was clever
---
I've posted this elsewhere but:
---
* move the dragon items from wyrms/drakes/hydras to konar table, they have other uniques anyway
---
* boost the chance of wyrms/drakes/hydras hitting the konar table to compensate.
---
2 rune full helms 
---
It used to be on the old rdt in rs2
---
Oh man you are so right! having 100-200 torstols/ranarrs/snaps on a drop table really was a good idea and ABSOLUTELY needs to be brought back! it was in no way broken or retarded idea in the first place.
---
If I was posting for karma, I wouldn't be posting on this subreddit. You absolute dunce. 
---
I recently had an account compromised also. 
---
I had everything covered, but two-step on the email. 
---
I would suggest making a new email with another email provider and linking that email solely to that RuneScape account. Most email providers have two-step available so I would suggest enabling that.
---
Stay away from gmail if possible, I can only assume that‚Äôs how I was breached. 
---
Be careful when continuing progress on this account, once someone has gotten into the account it is very for them to continue to do so.
---
Best of luck, hope it all goes well.
---
i just dc for a second. nothing interesting happens
---
Im happy with the nerf
---
and people think this isn't broken
---
My first Konar task was 50 Steel Dragons. Was taking an age to complete, so spent a day gearing up and levelling prayer, and earning some cash for an appropriate weapon, only for them to nerf the table. I'd killed like maybe 8 steels. Pretty pissed. 
---
Because it's a stereotype for priests to sexually abuse younger indivdiduals. And it's common for certain religious preachers to cut the foreskin of newborn babies, which is totally irrational and leads to medical issues/pain/general problems for the genitals. 
---
Therefore, a logical atheistic/secular state is the future since information is available out there. People can develop proper stances.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt have done Watchtower I guess?üòÖ
---
Podcast + hearthstone is good for agil
---
&gt;PRECISELY! Faux and streamers don‚Äôt know a thing. All these top tier pvm-ers have been farming hydras all day skipping the random tasks....that they don't even experience FIRST HAND what doing regular Konar tasks, on the ground level, for players like us who aren‚Äôt maxed with fat banks, feel like. All it takes is ONE angry, whiny viewer to post a screenshot to a malleable P-mod streamer and it'll get him talking and pushing for a nerf.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;As a /voratiu said on another thread, "Jagex is like God giving every Jamaican birth deficiencies because he saw Usain Bolt at the Olympics."...this is so fucking true
---
Maxed combat with a fat bank here, used 2k points and I've not had a single hydra task so I've been doing Konar instead, I've made a whopping bonus 400k from 10 ish konar tasks....
---
This would definitely work, but it is a kinda half assed solution. They just need engine work done to change the way the client handles the bank. Ash was tweeting about it again yesterday.
---
What a flip, compliments yesterday are today's shut up serene
---
Dead link of just me?
---
Lol get your shameless plug out of here 
---
Could someone explain? 
---
If you‚Äôre safe spotting him or not taking damage consistently then you can be PJed off of the archeologists or any enemy at range. You probably just spend enough time avoiding damage until the PJ timer runs out opening you up for another attacker. If you get hit and retaliate then they can‚Äôt hit you while you‚Äôre still in combat. Idk how long the pj timer it is but I think it‚Äôs based on whether you take damage from whatever or whoever you‚Äôre fighting. For you to count as being in combat, attacks have to be dealt consistently back and forth. Avoid damage after too long and you‚Äôll be open to getting attacked by another player/monster aka get pjed.
---
Found the irrational religious nut.
---
From a developer‚Äôs perspective, I‚Äôm gonna Occam‚Äôs Razor this. If the update was to bird nests, why would they update mole skins? They‚Äôre not the intended update. It‚Äôs way more likely that they missed a source of nests. 
---

I‚Äôve seen too many incel posts on 2007 reddit with the lowlands update.

Buy an android phone? Better specs, features, cost... Idiot
---
What boots are those?
---
just imo seems like the best solution is shut down twitch
---
It really is amazing the flood of low lvls here demanding they're entitled to bossing profit afking a jelly and pretend getting a free extra 300k a task on top of mob loot is somehow way beneath them. They sure don't care if herb runs became dead content though as long as they can get they're 200 torstols at lvl 75
---
Meme doesn‚Äôt make sense, every video is her getting ass pounded. Why would she need protection? Downvoted for inaccuracies.
---
You get those tasks so rarely with konar that I think it's fair 
---
!remindme 5 minutes

This shouldn't get in the way of important updates... like fixing magic.

I did the same back in 2008, it was hella worth it mate.

PID cycles though, it can change every 60-90 seconds, so it's not just the number you get when you login, it also changes throughout the session.
---
You should go work for jagex, be community manager, reply to all the sexualized female characters to build your sweaty fanbase then quit and take your fans to start a stream. Everyone loves sucking up to a Jmod and you'll have people just give you shit. 
---
RWT is legal, it's called buying bonds
---
Its not about the gp/h..thats fine noone cares...its about the supplies that get dropped
---
Throwing a nullpointer.
---
I honestly think we're just hitting on a boiling point on how completely anti-low/medium player this game is becoming. As it stands it takes 100s of hours to do anything remotely worth whie.
---
I don't think this was the way to solve it but I see why people latched onto it. 
---
Don‚Äôt be angry, be better.
---
Pretty sure it's the first time in his life he heard this word and thinks its a cool word now so he uses it.
---
For all those asking, this is konar before the transformation 
---
You are forgetting which Jagex we are talking about, we are talking about Jagex that added 2,5k brews, it's also same Jagex that doesn't know a lot about balancing, Vorkath, Zulrah pre nerf and Revs come to mind when talking about that
---
Reminds me of the dragon setup in darksouls 3.
---
Ranged is already too good
---
While I dont like the name and not even sure I agree with the idea, I like that people are coming up with creative alternatives to the Konar loot table. Everyone out there is whining about the nerf while not understanding that the problem isnt so much the gp value as it is the type of drops being offered. I don't think this idea is amazing, but it's a hell of a lot better than what we currently have and would much prefer something like this than ridiculous quantities of skilling materials
---
Except those are pretty much all shitty tasks. The fact that you think iron dragons have no cons shows that you must not know anything about the game. 
---
That‚Äôs what they call a scam in the black market community.
---
No way, Tbow is already the meta ... don‚Äôt add more juice to the bottle.

No, because those people that upvoted one either should not be upvoting the other or should be actively downvoting the other

Someone bought that bond, so someone paid the money. And bonds cost more than regular members.

No. Nice try though.

ECONOMY RUINED. TOO MANY IMBUED HEARTS IN THE GAME NOW.

For anyone who isn't deranged. Nobody would call out humorous remarks if they're rational.

Upvted m8.
---
I hate 75% of this game. 
---
Must mean no complaints lol
---
Except yours never are.
---
Yeah if you're really lucky. You can't bank on that drop.
---
Depends on the plant.
---
Right, really banking on being able to weave ancestral robes when warding is released. Wonder what smithing level we will need to forge a pair of bandos tassets, or fletching level to make a tbow. 
---
Learn what the definition of a "fact" is before posting lies and misinformation to a public platform, deranged "person".

Yeah once im home (not gonna be until late) and ive tracked her down, ill take a picture and post another reply to you! :D
---
Ill even include my reddit name so dipshit up there realises im not taking a stock pic haha
---
All I see is mouse icons
---
as a crappy casual player, Konar tasks have been an absolute blast for me. I love getting assigned all these different areas, sometimes sending me to places I've never been before. and even though she's not as efficient as other masters, it doesn't bother me too much because frankly I can't always afford to cannon or burst anyways
---
ur pretty cringe bro sirene got you there
---
I can read.
---
My problem is that I think you are so negative about a lot of things. While it's important to stick to what you believe in and stand your ground, a positive outlook would make you a more likeable, and it would lower the amount of hateful comments that you get.
---
I don't think you are a dumb guy, and I don't think your opinions are wrong per se, I just think that if you saw things from a different perspective people wouldn't react so harshly to you.
---
I actually admire you for keep doing what you do despite the hate that you get. A lot of people would just delete their account and start anew.
---
I was answering your stupid question - not making a statement. Come on.
---
Childish and idiotic..expected!
---
&gt; The seed drops are stupid wanna stop devaluing resources give coins
---
You don't understand drop tables if you think "give coins" is a good solution. Seeds produce herbs. Thats a resource used for skilling to produce more resources.
---
&gt; getting decent drops and making more money to continuously 
---
Slayer provides this. If you think it doesn't, go look into some progress videos from 2 years back when slayer was pretty much a consistent loss of gp. I did 99 slayer in that time. Slayer is ridiculous in comparison these days. Its twice as fast and you profit a solid amount even while training efficiently. 
---
&gt;  I dont intend to farm any seeds myself anytime soon 
---
Then don't complain you aren't making more money. Thats a good money maker right there, and you're avoiding it. Your loss. Sell the seeds, make a quick buck. Continue slaying. Do what you enjoy. But god do not balance a game because seemingly you haven't really put much thought into it outside of "i want more stuff to make my life easier, i dont care about any other logic"
---
Niceeeee. Did you slayermusiq that quest cape?
---
It could be tampered, regardless of when they reveal the results.
---
Oh I know, but you answered it like an idiot and I knew you'd keep raging lol
---
I think Mlm(for Prospector Kit) to 75 then switch to blast mine is what is done now? It might just be straight blast mine though.
---
this fucking title
---
Dawg the buy limit on sharks is 10k, it took 60 hours to even buy those shits lmao
---
Nope, I'm not. Posting genuine stances on every topic at hand, but people are too bloodthirsty and deranged to handle it (hence the flawed score). It's also a reason why the point system shouldn't be an indicator for how true or valid a remark is. Just check the political subs.
---
That would be amazing.
---
If you enjoy if then there's no problem. It puts you at a slight disadvantage but a lot of what happens combat wise in OSRS is luck imo. I've had equal or higher stats and gear to people I've fought and hit nothing but 0 for like 10 swings in a row sometimes. It's all RNG. 
---
Con, herb, wc, hunter are some easy levels for you. You could get 10 con levels in few hours.
---
But to change spellbook you need to do Lunar Diplomacy, which needs Rune Mysteries, which unlocks runecrafting! GAY!
---
Cheers mate
---
I hate to say it but I imagine they won‚Äôt notice your post or will just say it‚Äôs in the post we can‚Äôt just give you some more because you haven‚Äôt received it yet.
---
F.
---
Imbued heart is good because we don't have super magic potions, so a ranged or melee version would only save inventory space and I guess I can support that. They might even be less efficient in cases where inventory space isn't important because of the cooldown.
---
You're a disgrace. Should be quarantined
---
Nice job man! I recently got my first whip fulfilling a childhood dream and later that day I showed my wife and she responds with ‚Äúit looks like a string of sausages‚Äù and now that‚Äôs all i see haha. So be proud of your achievements and enjoy your cool capes!

Read any of the upvoted post against the nerf. Check out the announcement thread as well.

Don‚Äôt let Faux see 
---
Depends on what buddy.
---
Yes it's more accurate and hits a bit higher against dragons then hasta, it's worse then dhcb at vorkath I don't know about raids.
---
Konar would be literally 5 minutes of dev time. Its a model that randomly selects a monster for you to slay, how is that much dev time?
---
thats the plan :)
---
need to make money for pet insurance first though
---
Use melee mate
---
I got 130 hellhounds in Witchhaven dungeon. Instant skip

u sure?

$75k inventory 
---
alright man thx
---
I'd assume it still gets the job done just as well as a new shiny tray.
---
I killed drakes, if you make the bonecrusher necklace and wear it, you can definitely reduce the cost you incur while slaying them, also, you get a decent amount of prayer exp as well.
---
It‚Äôs a joke, for some reason everyone just waits at the entrance and banters.

Id recommend snagging an occult if I were you, its cheap, and a massive upgrade! Keep up the grind brother
---
vorkath up to 5m per hour, but rare drop around 2m every 15-30th task is wayy too much right?
---
I heard that place smells like trash.  Maybe decline the tour if offered.  
---
Don't start this again.
---
Look at my post. The /s was literally there from the start and never edited....
---
Why did they ner this in the first place? I have been avoiding slayer due to high investments until it actually becomes profitable and for that youbhad to invest huge amounts for supplies and gear...
---
Konar made it more appealing plus this drop table was decently rare as such basically a drop per task and it made low level slayer profitable.
---
Everyone who complained about skilling content not being as profitable don't understand that the drops were rare and not as fast made as skilling, plus what do you expect a pvmer without herblore would do with 100 ranarr? Nothing... Selling it mby... Plus they coukd of made changes to prioritize skilling over pvm, but they didn't and flaming about it doesn't any of us good like if you don't get what you want, you make sure those that did don't get their wanted content as well...
---
So we should all suffer instead of some of us actually enjoying the game... Grow up, you can't please everyone and never will be able to, so why complain? 
---
It rinses through dragon tasks, and I've heard that theoretically it should be pretty good for olm, but I don't think it's worth the current price tag.
---
Yeah, which is the main reason I havent really thought about it, but since I was here, thought might as well.
---
Very constructive. Why not? What would you want to see?
---
why do jagex employees reply to threads like this but won‚Äôt reply to the threads that are about people not getting their KOTS rewards for over a year.. 
---
Some dumb circlejerker
---
Why? It‚Äôs something to work towards that affects nobody who aren‚Äôt into them.
---
Yep it was there, thanks mate.
---
Idk why they didn‚Äôt just replace the herb drops with stuff of equal value 
---
'A Twisted Bow falls out the tree'
---
This post is retarded on so many levels. Youre not only missing the point, but also feeling entitled as a low level for whatever reason. Why?
---
Buy a new tray for christ sake
---
????
---
You‚Äôre being redicukous assuming everybody was making mils off the drop table. They weren‚Äôt ..... every time a patch drops there HAS to be something to complain about. And this was it. It wasn‚Äôt OP. Everybody and their mother was doing konar and posting about it so rare drops didn‚Äôt seem as rare. They said a drop for 6 mil was 1/50k and people still lost their mind. Childish hive minds as usual. 
---
Hot take: Mid level account players complaining are the RS3 refugees/mobile only players and we shouldn't value their opinion.
---
It might not help but I‚Äôve send a tweet out for you to the most active Jmod‚Äôs on twitter included a screenshot of this post. Gl!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhYT1L8yeJU
---
Love the colours. This is great.
---
Real talk tho, the game isn't centered around ironmen. Jagex already stated that
---
Has anyone ever took a browse through rots twitter? The most pathetic, vile, delusional basement dwellers I've ever seen.
---
All they did was make the herbs seeds. How is this dead content now?
---
I just chill in shilo village
---
Good luck ever getting them, JMods have straight up lied about this many times in the past.
---
Especially /u/ModStone
---
No
---
Its not unique to Konar, but I just did my first wyrms task and it seems amazing for low/mid level players. I made about 400k on one task that took about an hour. Including a few lucky Konar drops it was about 700k, which puts it slightly below kurasks and gargs imo just because of the rng factor.
---
Even with the nerfed table Konar could still be really good for mid level slayer.
---
Marley brinx apparently 
---
Gz!
---
Keep trying pal, eventually someone will care and upvote one.
---
Lol do you think I do?
---
I work 21 hours a day 7 days a week, if I don't get a scythe drop every task the game needs to die. 
---
Shilo village boys!
---
Right dude? I had a ton of fun that first day with her, I was able to use my cannon in all these places for extra range xp and I was at least breaking even with the new drop table. Such a shame it got nerfed but hopefully they listen and raise the values back up while changing the items to seeds or something
---
Drop rate of irl rewards 1/5k sorry m8
---
South of it, but yes.

Go jerk off to Faux you fuckin nerd

Hey buddy, are you retarded?

I stand in solidarity with your tray, any bad shit won‚Äôt survive the oven anyways

Along with being tribrid which is a good enough benefit, why does it need loads of % bonuses?

I've found that I really only have to blood barrage the little fuckers maybe one in every 9 or 10 kills, but that's just all rng. I kinda hate sire so it's been a minute since i was there.
---
Heard he's off the team, cant blame them all.
---
Who jumps on RuneScape to talk about deaths in the family? 
---
I would, if it was at extremely rare odds and at sub-par exp rates like it was...
---
*Insert Will Smith* Ahh that‚Äôs hot 
---
Oh that's a pretty elegant idea, I like it 
---
No, never. 
---
Even if its a 1/1,000,000 drop (Brews) it is still stupid game design. 
---
If you're lower levelled probably worth due to the still better drops and you're probably not slaying with bp/cannon either so the shit locations don't matter. 
---
Hellhounds drop loot now? When was the update? Did 2 hellhound tasks yesterday and nada.
---
Ah thanks m8
---
The fire breath shout is Yol-Tor-Shul.
---
Why should low levels now get it easier, this whole drama leads me to believe that every low level thinks high level players just got accs for free. No we all started as level 3s with no money. Play the game and don't complain.
---
So in other words kq, kbd, abby demon and vorkath slayer helms but from a different boss?
---
Holy shit you couldn't be any more of an idiot even if you tried.
---
Thanks dude, I appreciate it, let me know how it goes or could you link the tweet? Not sure how Twitter works. 
---
To make Konar doing worthwhile, even after the set is obtained as a niche in slayer with additional damage. Also more incentive and reward for doing konar. I personally don't feel just being tribrid is good enough as you can only have 1 of the styles active at any one time, but this could be balanced of course.
---
Why do you care what these mouth breathers think?

I actually haven't tried it there yet. I was using it on AH and getting kills about as fast as my blowpipe kills, just way lower supply costs because no darts or scales. I just woke up a little bit ago but I'm planning to test it on Vorkath and on Rune Drags throughout the day, I'll let ya know. I do expect it to absolutely wreck though.

Guess that they don't have to give that anymore since most of the bonuses are useless now.

I'm sure you're aware that Jagex has a very bad reputation when it comes to delivering competition prizes (how long did the clan cup guys have to wait again?).
---
Good luck!

sell items lmaoooo

Shut up Serene
---
Updated post thanks for your comment :)
---
is supposed to unlock runecrafting! GAY!*
---
How big of a difference is there between using a phone and an iPad?
---
Appreciate it, and yeah there was a Jmod who was tasked, but he sucked at it and no longer works there, my guess is that no one wanted to pick up the mess of a workload he left behind.
---
Alch yourself
---
Can't you already ask for an easier task?
---
You darn youngsters. GoingCrazy201 is the OG quest guide.
---
It‚Äôs the only slayer master that assigns Hydras, aka the highest slayer requirement in game at this time. High level players are forced to use it if they want to do Hydra. 
---
Not that people don't bot PvM (because they do) but the trouble with having gathering skills make good money is that they will be run right into the ground by bots.
---
Personally I really like the idea of making fish drops a function of fishing level and I think it should be more widespread (logs based on wc level, ores based on mining, etc). It at least gives an incentive to train those skills.
---
Hey man I know a lot of people already commented this, but I just wanted to take a second out of my day too to let you know you‚Äôre a fucking dumbass. 
---
We already have a seed vault named Nieve
---
I get less lag and the screen is a lot larger so it‚Äôs easier to me. More space.
---
I mean, they posted it online.

Thanks! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

You can't obtain them as a lvl 3, join zSkillers CC for any further questions.

Yep. Both are problems. 
---
Got the gold package all good, aswell as the lifetime sub, just havent had anything physical turn up at my doorstep after a year.
---
Everyone complaining about the tray, it‚Äôs old not dirty ya dumb fucks. Metal pans change colour over time with high temperatures. Food grease can also cause stains that don‚Äôt simply ‚Äúwash off‚Äù unless you‚Äôre using steel wool or something. Then you‚Äôre destroying the pan. After hot water and soap that stuff isn‚Äôt coming off, it isn‚Äôt dirt or old food lmao.
---
Funny I wasn‚Äôt a winner or anything but I was told by a mod one time through saved messages on runescape that they would send me a poster for some inconvenience.  Gave him address and it never arrived.
---
How could they do that? Streamers would need to own their own streaming platform to charge for using it, but how would anyone afford that? You have literally no idea how streaming works.
---
Yeah i went from a redwood to a curry and I have to waste a farm spot for a curry now.
---
Oh I absolutely agree. It's fine to cook with as long as everything is cleaned off it and there isn't grease or burnt pieces of food sticking to your chicken. 
---
The thing that bothers me is it looked like he didn't cut the chicken in half so its going to cook really unevenly. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôd love to hear the reasons why you feel you can say with 100% certainty that it absolutely won‚Äôt happen.

PSA: The drop table could have value while not adding more resources to the game. (Not many people are complaining about the value. Just the specific items that are dropped.) Also, using items that can easily fluctuate in price (even artificially through fear with this update) is a bad idea.
---
This.
---
Bpipe/whip, ring and slay helm is all i need
---
I'd like for this to be a rare drop, something a little more exclusive. Something like 1/500, and guaranteed on the 500th drop. 
---
Yea, they will be making graves that require you to pay money to get your items back. But it won't be 100% value, it would be way too harsh.
---
It seems like a massive design flaw if people are afraid to use max gear in an mmo where progression is the reason why people play the game.
---
As soon as they would reply to me they will reach out to you I guess, mainly because I‚Äôve screen shotted the whole conversation including ur u/hoophumper 
---
No reply from any of them on this topic yet tho. Gl!
---
I know mate she was indeed, I used her back then. You cant deny the king tho slayermusiq

Teleport to clan wars, and then finish the morytania hard diary and use the legs to teleport to Morton.

---
The problem is the dev team has no fucking back bone. If they are just going to revert everything a few nerds complain about that's not an issue with the nerds. What's the point of having polls if they are just going to change shit right after release? 
---
You say that a 2m drop doubles their bank, firstly 2m bank for a level 75 is a gross underestimate but let‚Äôs work with it. Low levels can make 1.3m an hour from Culinaromancer's Chest, or 2.8m from medium clues, so it‚Äôs not 7 to 10 hours of money making, more like 1-0.5. So what if they get a 2m drop every 15 tasks, it‚Äôs not hard to make 2m even on a new account. If you have doubts YouTube it, loads of people have done bonds from scratch in under 4 hours on fresh accounts, and yet you claim it takes 10 hours to make 2m
---
I was most hyped for the new fishing method as well. Feels like a good concept with piss poor rewards and xp though I have a low fishing level.
---
Hey friend I recently came back after a 10 year break. Sign in with your old credentials and you'll find yourself on tutorial island. Happy adventures! 
---
same brother, just acquired 68 mining last night!
---
Then lets make craw's bow garbage to balance it out.
---
People like you call the police on Jagex for having 1/50k loot.
---
Chance is based on monster level so if you‚Äôre fighting 76 trolls you won‚Äôt have many table hits. 
---
Pearl barbarian fishing rod
---
Killed 160 hellhounds and got jack shit, FeelsBadMan
---
Agreed. I don't think every boss needs one, but it makes sense for the one with the highest level requirement to have something special like this
---
I got a seed my first fruit tree run. GG mate
---
I didn‚Äôt get any from giant see weeds but I got from checking tree health like 3 hespori seed .. 
---
Why would you ever not protect a tree tho?
---
They should just remove the doors and just have a chatbox message or NPC tell you you don't meet the requirements to use the patch if you're below 85/65 or whatever the requirements are. Add a sign near each area so it's obvious. Shouldn't be difficult for them considering there are already restricted patches in game (troll and harmony island patches)
---
The bank in the 85 area shouldn't be a big deal either considering the chest nearby, though the chest may become a bit pointless with this solution.
---
\&gt; Implying that you're in any way a respectable user, and not just an elitist troll who thrives off of the negativity sent your way
---
Hmmm :/
---
oh yes.
---
Omegalul they never said that aerial fishing would be profitable.
---
Damn I really suck at reading.
---
FWIW 3 years ago I also won some physical rewards from mod pi over at rs3. Also had to chase it up since their community team had forgotten/missed it.
---
What nerf? haven't played for a bit
---
I did 12 tasks so far and hit the most I hit the drop table on 1 task was 4 times at smoke devils.
---
This is very lucky.
---
We're not complaining about the nerf, we're complaining about the drastic nerf. It needed fine tuning, adjustments. But they completely annihilated  it because they used the data from big streamers to make a decision, not the overall community they claim to listen to so much. 
---
I'm already blind ü§∑
---
I don't think slayer was ever a moneysink..you're supposed to make money.
---
A jmod wouldnt ask for your address in the game to send you free shit.
---
Pkers lose everything if there‚Äôs a power outage or dc, that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt take more than 3-4 bis items, 
---
The games supposed to be risk vs reward but what do pvmers risk
---
Real Chad's get to kalphites through the dorgeshuun tunnels. Get good scrub.
---
For not being able to pick where you slay so less xp, But for no reason HURRRR.
---
I think I got 3 when I did mine. maybe 4?
---
Yeh it just seems such a waste- I would argue dks noted bones is more OP tbh considering it can be done off task too.
---
We can live and hope anyway haha.
---
Farming is gathering and will always be profitable, while crafting is money sink. If farming were closer it wouldn't be any good for the game
---
? People used to pay 300m for a fucking rapier for 1 extra max hit. Now you have like 5 extra max hits + more accuracy for 1/3rd of the price of a rapier. Obviously it's worth the ''coin'' u braindead retard.
---
pretty sure they just implemented this in the main game for mining. the only way to obtain ores now is through mining, and monster drops were replaced with things that give like double ore while mining for x amount of time. I think its a really good idea honestly and I wish osrs had more content like that. Skilling feels so devalued in osrs and its a shame because it was the main draw of runescape for me as a kid. Slayer is fun and all, but its also pretty generic MMO content 
---
Polls are useless, They poll things like 3 times anyways until they get the result they want. (Spell book size)
---
I used ultracompost on mine as I hadn't a clue if it made a difference. Maybe it does?
---
Exactly. I dont ubderstund whats the problem nerfing op drop table little bit.
---
New slayer master gives you access to a rare drop table on any task of hers that you do 
---
Did you delete or le mods removed your post?
---
The other forms are ugly compared to this! This color I will support!
---
Still need to use tin foil on an old tray. 
---
Took me 335kc for mine. Now I'm 450kc rex 200kc both of the other and have 1 bring 12 axes and 4 warrior rings.....
---
Look up Chymistry on twitch. He's a really nice streamer and started helping people with the elite diary raids requirement. If you want a clan to raid with try WeDoRaids. You can look them up online for a discord link. Gl with the raid :D
---
Sucks as that was my contract, maybe I should have skipped it by doing a medium level instead
---
Holy shit, yes please! BIS helm for slayer AND fashion? Sign me up.
---
yikes you know those two hate their lives.
---
Pro tip, get an air fryer. Like 50 bucks, and the chicken is so much better.
---
lol yeah, very true!
---
Additionally to OPs suggestions, I would suggest to add some herblore secondaries such as red spider eggs, wines, dragon dust, limpwurt roots etc (most of them are really tedious to get for ironmen and dont offer any direct experience). Because those don't devalue any skill and are quite valuable assets for every player in the game. Furthermore, I think it's a good idea to swap out logs for planks and herbs for seeds as already planned by you guys. Thus, you can add skill related stuff, such as the above, but don't make it drop primary resources gathered from certain skills. 
---
I like the suggestions of OP, these offer some good mid-level focused loot and items.
---
Lastly, I wanted to say the update was really well done and I hope you guys can nail this drop table to similar standards. Good luck.
---
I understand that. It does get kinda annoying sometimes but in order to do high level content well you'll need 90 herb and it's worth doing birdhouses at least up until that point. They only take about 65 seconds to do a full run but you can also skip the fourth birdhouse and just do the 3 at the start, that shouldn't take much time at all.
---
I rolled dusk mystic robe bottoms at Kraken last night which is apparently 1/61800 according to the Wiki. 
---
And the piece of shit sold for 1M. Something that rare, 20x rarer than pet. Drop table confirmed not OP. 
---
It would take you 68 years killing 1 chicken per second to hit the drop rate. 
---
With slayermusiq, I can put his video on a second screen and legit do the quest in real time without constantly pausing it; that‚Äôs what makes his guides the best to me. It‚Äôs so comprehensive, and yet he explains everything so well. 
---
If you like non-afking fishing then look into 3t barbarian fishing. Tjis new method is good for mobile though
---
I‚Äôm trying for all 90s combat before I even think about raids, currently 85s melee and 80s mage and range. Soon^TM
---
Medium clue does not equal masters. But continue 
---
It most likely does. Did you have the new seed planted in the anima patch that boosts the yield of patches in the guild? I had neither that nor ultracompost.
---
Thanks! 
---
As far as cosmetics go I don't mind having lots of recolors, especially if you have to earn them. As long as I can recognize what the player is wearing I think it's fine.
---
This is VERY VERY lucky and I actually wish shit like this wasn't posted because this exact content is what gives people the false idea that it's OP and mega common for drops. I spent an hour and a half last night on 157 wyrms with only one drop of runes. Only got 550k from the task for all of that time.
---
Amazing
---
 I got a seed from one of my farming runs earlier, but I‚Äôm only 43 farming, can I do hespori? 
---
Yeah man I do, I can‚Äôt complete a clue scroll every 30 seconds like I can kill a monster. I even average 1:30 at zulrah and I still can‚Äôt complete any clue, even a easy clue in that amount of time. So yes you can‚Äôt grind clues like you can monsters 
---
Hi and welcome to my guide
---
Good thing I sold one for 4.99m
---
Yea, I‚Äôd prefer to watch or listen to something else while I‚Äôm doing the quest so I like the shorter videos that just tell me what to do and then skip to when they are done doing it 
---
This is all luck. Please do not post this like it's a common occurrence. This will not happen again.
---
They also changed metal drops to pure alchables, so that's a plus.
---
The spirits thing need to be rebalanced but they aren't going to touch them until they get that dater.
---
I want to be active, not hate myself after 5 minutes lol. 
---
Of course it's going to go down the first few days, due to EVERYONE that could, would go slay the new monsters and use the new master creating an influx in e.g. Death runes. Since Death runes are consumables when used, they would be used and once people stopped rushing the new content and get back to what they used to the market would stabilize again.
---
Uh oh if jagex sees this post they will nerf within 24hours
---
Not yet. I plan to get my hands on it soon. Needed the Celastrus for diary and got them all completed now :)
---
Make it drop 110k brews. Or better yet 10k brews, 10k sharks, 10k prayer pots, 10k super combats, 10k restores, just anything supply you could ever need should come from 1 master clue drop so that you never have to do anything ever again.
---
It triggers me so hard that he drew the ranger attacking the melee and melee attacking the mager. What happened to the combat triangle?
---
Is this something that they can add? Not on apples end? If so, yes please, I hate having to switch back to the app every 30 seconds to refresh it and make it not log me out 
---
Yeah, no problem. Noobs shouldn't be making above 200k/hr. :) I'll be enjoying making 15m/hr at ToB now. Streamers are the only ones who really matter anyways.
---
Ya I‚Äôve read into it. Looks pretty sweet.
---
Also at the end of this event you can suddenly pick whatever door you want to leave :(
---
There's no way anybody would take OP seriously, as he's still using OSBuddy in 2019 lmao
---
stop with the recolours pls
---
Yes. 
---
B
---
I was right, you can't even do a hydra task. Alch hydra is absolutely profitable, about 100k minimum per kill without uniques. It's not a vorkath, but if doesn't need to be. It's a mechanically fun and engaging fight, and it's rewarding. You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
A high level player that isn't completely focused on Slayer ehp would absolutely do konar with the old or slightly modified drop table. Not with a nerf, but with the old table sure. It's way more fun to do Slayer without having to hop for the meta spot every task. 
---
Also, your detective skills are absolutely retarded. My first thread created on this Reddit was Jan 2017 about my multiple boss pets. Its safe to say just based on that that I've been playing longer.
---
I'm not even sure what you were referencing, but that was my ironman, and even that was 110 combat or so 8+ months ago. I've been playing off and on since 2014, my main is 126 with 99 Slayer and my iron has 95 Slayer. You're just an idiot.
---
I‚Äôm printing this and putting it in a frame on my desk. Love the art style!
---

 oof
---
Ha good luck unlocking that FPS many have tried
---
Do you really have the nerve to respond after to me, after that utter car-crash of a comment you made yesterday (which is now at -103 points btw)? You're hardly respectable - I think of you as the complete opposite actually. Perhaps you should look at yourself and how you act on here, before trying to bash on others.
---
This drop doesn't affect the important markets in the game. The skilling/PvM markets (herbs,/brews). Can't be compared whatsoever, so the meme doesn't even work.
---
What, couldn't get daddy Serene to notice you so you're trying to get my attention instead?
---
If you're using Runelite and tracking your loot post a pic to my thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/af95wn/alchemical_hydra_drop_rate/
---
I'm trying to work out ballpark figures for the drop rate of the uniques.
---
Oh my god who even coded this? Why haven't they removed third age from the drop table already?! Too OP
---
mom taught me not to play with food, except when I post it on the internet for sweet points then its encouraged
---
Screenshots 
---
I did this and learned the rotations very quickly. This is the best bet for people new to zulrah.
---
No, you need 65 farming to access the part of the guild the cave is in.

Jeez, bs

Would you say daggs is better than cannoning the caged ogres?

but i heard it makes hair grow on your hand and i wanna be that monkey kungfu guy from kim possible
---
She's allegedly 24. Looks 35-40 here 
---
Agreed. I absolutely love it. Gonna keep me engaged for an extremely long time. Already done 20 contracts.
---
Thanks for the reply. I didnt even realize those abilities were landmarked like that, so just knowing that is really helpful. I just found him to be rather unpredictable, where the Hydra honestly feels like im doing the exact same thing every single kill
---
This naming convention appeared even before the official ironman mode came out when it was just the unofficial ironmen
---
IM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING GAME THESE DROPS ARE RIDICULOUS EVERYONE GO TO JAGEX TWITTER AND SPAM THEM!!! THIS SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE GAME AND REDUCED THE VALUE OF ALL ITEMS BY 30% BTW I DON'T DO CLUES IM BUSY KILLING A SLAYER BOSS
---
Hehe, pornographic companies are really tough when it comes to that department. Monthly check ups, no aids tolerated!
---
Ah they used to be hero pvm then, been a while since I‚Äôve been in oldschool!
---
They made the game mode. If I was playing "Ironman" and limiting myself then that's great. They built a game mode and a setting for it, which means they intend to support it. Bank space will benefit everyone as well, there's plenty of maxed mains with no room, or collectors.
---
It might be enabled by default. but if you have a GPU i suggest enabling the GPU plug in and increasing the draw distance to like 70...it shows you a lot more area. Also they recently added a skybox feature which removes the black from the sky. Enable the skybox if you want then go to the GPU setting again and raise the fog to like 3 or something. 
---
Everyone would just pick the meta areas... Lol wut completely defeats the purpose.
---
Send your friends a PM then?  Why would you talk in a video game public chat about the loss of a family member or friend... Then get upset at the reactions from TOTAL RANDOM STRANGERS.  
---
Some number of them are likely alts. Making cannonballs is incredibly afk.
---
That'd be a nice use for 1 of my 80 Vorkath Heads.
---
Shut up Serene 
---
remove yourself from my game
---
Vorkath is around 3m/h btw. Unless they changed something recently. 
---
how is it false?
---
My entire family died in a car crash.  Can I have 20m? 
---
Thanks Serene! Helpful as always!
---
Or maybe I still make at least 750k on rare drops on almost every slayer task I've done with her even post nerf?
---
Id use 2k worlds if they werent laggy pieces of ass
---
Did you just call rs3 the main game?
---
I‚Äôm already 99 slayer I haven‚Äôt been to bonar once but yeah you‚Äôre mad as shit
---
Support
---
Runs the risk of devaluing with one of the best F2P money makers
---
You're not wrong. It's undeniable that superiors and the catacombs changed Slayer meta way more than konar ever could though.
---
Nice
---
IDK why exceptions would be made for just shayzien tier 5 lol
---
Because they can't respond spontaneously to such topics. Statements has to be prepared.
---
It's not the respawn time that's the problem for me, it's the other abyssal monsters around that are all aggressive. So you have to kill a bunch of monsters you don't need to which makes the task take much longer
---
Lol
---
Just like how a massive majority of the playerbase supporting to allow 6 hour afk which is pretty much botting at that point. Doesn't mean it's good for game integrity. The streamers seem to be the only decent ironmen.
---

---
Like I said: jagex (and other game companies) can provide this.
---
You should also know that cerberus always starts the kill with a special attack where he uses all three attacks mage-&gt;range-&gt;meele. You can pray against them and avoid this damage. He repeats this attack every 50 seconds i think. Other than that gl on your kills!
---
Sure, but you can‚Äôt blame players for wanting to bypass those training methods either if they don‚Äôt think their worth the time compared to other tasks

I bake my chicken almost all the way done before grilling. He could be doing the same. It comes out hella moist that way.

Gratz! 400k away myself. Will be my first time getting 99 slayer, a goal I set waaaay back when. Enjoy it!

Okay well maybe Jagex can update it so it only shows you the results then.

You didn't hide your run energy, GF account.

Lol sorry op but they are right about the tray, at least use some tinfoil

Honestly this is one of the few times I'd argue that banning every single one of their account, each alt they have, should be permanently banned.
---
or **at least** a permanent mute on all their accounts..

But alas we'll probably see these kids continuo harassing people..

He gets lucky osrs

Look at debbie downer over here
---
I generally meant like any shayzien armour... just wanted to know if I should farm more of them before dropping tier 4 :)
---
Yup, just did this too, now have another fruit tree i can easily tp to at level 82 farming
---
He said he knew it was a bait he just didnt know what bait so he wanted to find out. He thought some1 was going to log in under the guy with claws to try and spec him out thats why he camped 110+ hp

When did I say was normal? And you really went from 0 to 100 calling me fucking pathetic.  Talk about your dead dad at home, not in Varrock.

Ok thanks! :)

What combat stats should I have before I'm able to start bossing?

what the fuck

Actually just stop yourself. You clearly don't understand the game, so stop leaving low iq statements like those here.

Desmaster, Add me on discord @JellyBob#9651 , and ill invite u to the server where he updates us with his progress everyday!!

Are you using mobile data? If your device changes which tower it's getting a signal from, it requests a re-authentication to make sure it really is the same device. Or if you're swapping between different wifi networks (Home, work, public) the same thing happens.
---
Have u got lifetime membership tho?
---
I swear if Jagex doesn't honor this within 24 hours I'm canceling my membership forever.
---
Okay great, thanks all for your help
---
Just @JagexAsh on Twitter, fastest way to reach them I swear.
---
Thanks bro! What level are you now?
---
I dont like the idea of increased superiors because that significantly affects xp rates

Id assume your ip is changing so you look like a new device

Thank you my man! This is my first time too, and you are very close yourself!
---
daily reminder to ignore helmie opinions
---
Yielded me 17 bstaffs on my main and only 2 on my alt, both with 99 farm so it definitely is variable. Regardless I'm leaning more towards the 120/130k gp/seed price range
---
They should be similar to the way it was in rs2, some magic damage bonus. Like 2% per level boost would seem fair. Maybe less in Raids.
---
Oh right well enjoy üëåüëç
---
Thankss! A childhood dream for sure, grind that 400k out! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Nice FPS, gf account
---
I'm not even trying to get your attention, you're simply giving it to me everytime you reply lol?
---
Thank youu!
---
You don‚Äôt know how Twitter works huh 
---
Same here. Started doing Slayer again because of Konar. Been a boring profit-less grind so far, but the chance to make decent money before the 80s is enticing.
---
That is a very good point that I totally forgot about lol. I'm at 18.5m Slayer now so I have been ignoring Slayer reqs for quite some time now lol
---
How is that low iq? If I‚Äôm standing in single and expecting to 1v1 someone then I should at the very least have some indicator to let me know my opponent is in multi. It‚Äôs ok though, someone will make a plug-in for runelite that will mark multi combat spots at some point in time.

Holy shit imagine using quest guided. You guys are so toxic, true players use their intelligence to complete quests by themselves. 
---
Yes, just physical rewards I'm missing.
---
I hate doing tick manipulation period. It's just not fun for me. 
---
At least he still has pizza. 
---
stfu serene. End yourself. 
---
???
---
20 clues per hour consistently is definitely unrealistic
---
Yup
---
if you can get that far then its not luck, youll get it on the next few tries 
---
Average seems to be 6 staffs per seed, figure the price will stabilise at 3-4gp/xp
---
The point being that 3 players seemingly have a say on how the game operates. I think it should have been polled
---
I'm getting the best rewards from medium farming contracts
---
Nice photo. 
---
Uhh, none of them can attack you except 1 guy.
---
It's not a bug.
---
You are in singles, and only 1 guy can fight you, they are in multi so you can fight them all.
---
77. My rsn is SGT CARVER. Started this account at the begging of November. Used to have a bad ass account back in the day. Let my buddy play on it while I was in Afghanistan and he got it banned by botting wood cutting. RIP.
---
You get anything good from Hydra?
---
You can be productive and still game way too much. I‚Äôve yet to meet someone who‚Äôs actively battling a heroin addiction that was high-functioning and not in denial about the increasing severity of their addiction. Additionally, I don‚Äôt have to worry about my computer being doped with fentanyl and dying, only silicon doped with some trivalent. 
---
So because a small portion of the playerbase gets influenced (or are stupid enough not to make their own decision when it comes to voting) Jagex needs to hide the polls? It's only Reddit that's crying about it, never saw this being discussed somewhere else.
---
Even better, Jagex caters these fools and gave them a poll to hide the poll results which failed. Also Jagex doesn't think it is an integrerity issue and I stand with them on this subject. If it really was they would've changed it already. 
---
Have you ever gone to www.runescape.com?
---
what do you mean?
---
"pet rate is unchanged" can mean either thing so its a fine answer either  way
---
Windows key + print scrn 
---
Hahahahahahahaha How The Fuck Is Cyber Bullying Real Hahahaha Nigga Just Walk Away From The Screen Like Nigga Close Your Eyes Haha
---
Turn off public chat, put them on the ignore list. Nobody just bullies someone for no reason. He must have done something to them.
---
So their vengeance attack should not have hit him by your logic. 
---
Support lol also wish they'd stop adding teles to the right click option on the max cape, one of these days I'll accidentally tele to wildy lol
---
Haha, didn't deserve the cape yet it seems
---
10k kc, not talking about the white helm, although that does make him a downie. 
---
sorry
---
Just go inside lol
---
STAB THE THING, I FEEL LIKE ITS STILL MOVING IN MY PLATE
---
Yes it should because vengeance hits back whoever hits you, and since you hit all of them it should hit back, wtf are you even talking about
---
...
---
Devalues my original sized chicken barrage 
---
I'm not gonna argue there, but many of us don't have 86 agility and desert elite completed so just getting to the boss can be a bit of a turnoff and I haven't needed Slayer xp for over a year so I personally don't care about Slayer xp rates
---
Serene isn't on the spectrum lol
---
Single into multi and multi into single has always worked like that. If it was a bug I think it would have been fixed already.
---
If you are in multi combat, you can be attacked by multiple enemies, if you are in single combat, you can only be attacked by one enemy. The multi-combat status of your attackers is irrelevant.
---
I agree it's pretty shitty and can kind of trick people if they're not totally aware of exactly how multi works and exactly where is multi / single. I doubt it'll be changed though.
---
&gt; Doesn't matter to us if we get 2m from noted ranarrs or 2m from alchables right? 2m is 2m?
---
you realize they TEMPORARILY NERFED VALUE 30%. not only is 30% not enough of a nerf to make it immediately trash, it‚Äôs also a TEMPORARY fix for one week, until they get more data and make another decision. my god the reddit circle jerk is cancer. 
---
i understand it‚Äôs less xp than duradel but it‚Äôs still more money, along with being new and exciting. 
---
Never mind you don‚Äôt understand. 
---
I am standing at G.E.   
---
I will need 3-4 runners who can run from Edgeville Bank to Body Altar (south/west of Edgeville).
---
3k Essence left and I will be offline in 1 hour tops. So if you are fast, you can make a nice amount (+ extra 100K if you refer a friend).  
---
I like it
---
Death is hardcoded bitch. 
---
Is it? Seemed like dogshit xp when I did it.
---
Runelite seems to be the most popular.
---
It isn't a big, it's a 500iq play honestly. This is probably the only time it would work out
---
all the devs needed to do was reduce the quantity of the valuable drops and increase the rarity. that's it.
---
It‚Äôs so easy tho 
---
This is what people don't understand. The KDT was no worse than wilderness Slayer totem drops, and the risk of getting PKed was the equivalent of being area restricted (which in a way Wilderness Slayer is already restricted, for example Fire Giants in Wilderness Slayer dungeon. 
---
is there a plugin that shows the amount of pure essence in pouches? i've seen some youtubers have it, but i can't find it in runelite. thanks!
---
Go get a black mask and a chest upgrade and you should be fine.
---
Official client is pretty popular too
---
Must be nice being so delusional
---
"Everyone else is in the wrong not me, downvotes mean nothing!"
---
In what way is it good hunter xp? 40k/hr is absolutely horrible hunter xp. I can go 2t swordfish for an hour and do black salamanders for an hour and accomplish at least 4 hours of aerial fishing.
---
And it's not even fun either. Cutting fish chunks is fucking awful.
---
i wish every piece of equipment didnt have a monster head on it
---
i look like a damn totem pole
---
Ah I see you're also lvl 80.
---
&gt;Player 1 is fighting Monni alone. After a while of just Player 1 being on that tile, he calls for his Venge accounts to log in, and then all of a sudden there are like 5-10 accounts with venge on that tile./
---
You've gone too far this time Serene. You will pay for your crimes.
---
I have gotten 1 from farming contract and 2 from papaya fruit tree runs so far. Maybe i got lucky or maybe you got unlucky...cant really say without proper numbers.
---
Well, i just made 844k doing one greater demon task for Konar, it took 45 mins of cannon and whip.  Worked a treat.
---
Konar isn't hard to get to either.
---
screw karma i could careless about reddit this shit is ridiculous 
---
A perm mute with a apology letter to the guy affected  , give the guy a option to unmute them. But perma ban is 2 far .
---
Your first language better be anything except english.
---
Well, never bring anything to the wildy you are not willing to lose
---
So true! But those chad gonna get mad about this... might nerf wintertodt
---
HYPERDANSGAME
---
&gt;for players who don't tick manipulate
---
You might as well do that because aerial fishing is just as intensive. 
---
&gt;But we knew the exp rates and that it was like Falconry when we voted so I don't see why you're surprised
---
You clearly haven't done it if you think it's like falconry. 
---
&gt;Also, the rewards aren't all cosmetic
---
One definitely is. The others pretty much are. What's one extra fish space? 
---
What if it was -10%? They just bank up all your duradel tasks and auto pass every hydra task when you swap back?
---
SLIIIIIIDE TO THE LEFT
---
*doot*
---
SLIIIIIIDE TO THE RIGHT
---
Youre not going to get a reply on a saturday mate
---
Hi celicarunner!
---
10/10 Jagex, excellent nerf
---
Yeah I saw that too wasnt it in the last update?
---
Seems like they're super rare from crops. 
---
I've probably harvested 300-400 crops of all different varieties since the update, and not a single seed. 
---
I've gotten 3 from about 15 farming contracts though. 
---
[Sure.](https://youtu.be/1xbLO5bB0Tk) 
---
No go bandos, arma, ahrims , bring, prims, and bring necklace/weapon switches 
---
0/10, shitty trolling
---
astounding, reminds me of myself when i was what? 12?
---
Damn, i know we have a broad age group of players - this shit is unacceptable.  Insta account ban.
---
He attacked multiple people in mutli, and all of them had vengeance. That‚Äôs exactly how the spell works, not one of them attacked him. It is a genius play on fools part.
---
so glad youre getting 500k for free for training combat 
---
And who are you hinting at exactly?
---
That was pretty nice tbh lol
---
rune dragons, brutal black dragons
---
You could splash.
---
Yes, it's accurate. It's getting the information straight from the news post: http://services.runescape.com/m=news/konar-loot-table-balancing?oldschool=1
---
Its fine as is, It makes it strong against dragons and nothing else. BIS should be shared not dominated by a single weapon.
---
can also apply to those who asked for a nerf lol
---
Yeah this sounds jed-y. Hope you get refunded. 
---
Wish they would buff zogres. Love the area
---
Nice holocaust era tray brah
---
What a waste of foil
---
Fuck slayermusiq he randomly walked up to me and started talking shit lol, claiming to make more in a day than I do in a lifetime with his shitty little YouTube channel.
---
Blank Template for everyone who wants to use it!
---
[https://i.imgur.com/mGSFEsv.png](https://i.imgur.com/mGSFEsv.png)
---
Just now realising I'd only need the template if i wanted to change this month's drama
---
The Virgin BIS vs the Chad cute noob
---
They basically all logged in at the same game tick, loaded vengueance spell instantly+recoils between two of his spell casts (so in less than 3 seconds).
---
Really broken
---
Sorry, but this new reworked table does not keep players motivated enough to get tasks from her.. 
---
I hate to say it, but it's already dead content!
---
Is there a way to know for sure?
---
Instead of being critical with no contribution why don't you explain why you think multiple color options are bad?
---
Kraken OP plz nerf
---
Ah ok thanks. Skipped through the dialogue and couldn‚Äôt speak to him again about it 
---
Yea, it seems accurate. If you're in doubt, you can find the actual Konar drop table here [http://services.runescape.com/m=news/konar-loot-table-balancing?oldschool=1#_ga=2.237401152.1736010248.1546897883-835055630.1511053612](http://services.runescape.com/m=news/konar-loot-table-balancing?oldschool=1#_ga=2.237401152.1736010248.1546897883-835055630.1511053612)

Yeah because youre using freakin ameth bolts lol
---
As a lvl 85 cmd this is to real
---
What level was the monster you killed. Maybe the level it scales to is whatever you killed.
---
There‚Äôs at least 1 mod who will see this who could just get up and go and bother a manager and say hey why don‚Äôt we just get someone to send out the things we promised over a year ago.
---
No idea.
---
The hill giant and moss giant boss are suitable for lower levels 
---
Veng bombs work in single combat? Or is he standing right on the edge of single and multi 
---
Well.. there's diferent levels of "expecting to lose it", it depends on what you do. If you visit popular multi areas then yes. 
---
For something else the risk is not that huge (without ddos or abuse of new weird shit like that)
---
I've done almost nonstop farming and I've gotten none. About to give up and just let them come passively 
---
Let me preface my only interaction with Monni by saying I think he is an entertaining and skilled player. Nevertheless, the one time I met him in game made him come across like a bit of a dick.
---
I was at BA years ago about to go into the final wave and he rocks up offering 1m to the leader of our party to let him join for the queen kill. The leader of the party accepted the pittance and kicked the noobiest player :(
---
This is for you nooby BA player, some karma for not getting that well earned queen kill.
---
‚ÄúIn the future‚Äù
---
Future ain‚Äôt here yet bruh 
---
Probably over 200k
---
True, though they probably would if they bothered to step off they're corner square and actually pick up some drops.
---
You look like you‚Äôre covered in fruit punch
---
Idk.. have to ask faux he will know what‚Äôs best for the game.
---
To be clear, I never said any of them are hard to avoid, they should be removed because they just add annoyance and the only people who wants it are RS3ers who believes for arbitrary reasons combat shouldn't be afkable.
---
Look at vork, the acid-spam attack literally serve no purpose other than waste my time by making kills longer. 
---
The scenario here is that the shield died and zuk was able to hit him, not that he miss clicked or had leftover food or anything. If he would have tagged the ranger before he destroyed the shield, he would have won, but went for the zuk kill instead, and whiffed.  Based on the 5 in the picture, he must have whiffed a few in a row lmao.
---
Doesn't bother me, but other people's reactions about dead daddy seem to bother you.  The world will not bend to your will and caress your feelings, little boy.  
---
how is your UI skinned like that in old school?
---
Damn... ok now I'm jealous! I just have 3 totems at the moment. 
---
Team was in multi. He wasn‚Äôt getting attacked, he ice barraged them all, they all just were venged so it stacked him out. Since they were in multi and he used a multi targeting spell he didn‚Äôt have to be in multi
---
Reckon I can kill this thing with 71 range and rune crossbow on my iron 
---
Lucky gmaul can always KO.  If you take something into wilderness, you accept that you can lose it.
---
Bad troll is bad. 
---
Prayer bonus from being Zamorakian and defensive bonuses from being a hasta. The Lance is neither.
---
Stating you don't pay anything is a gross misunderstanding of how marketing works. You pay because your view data is valuable to marketing organizations.
---
The Cerberus lava pool is just there to be annoyance, it's not that their hard to avoid or anything, but i see no purpose for it.  Just about every one of the move that requires you to avoid are arbitrary and unnecessary, the only exceptions i can think of is the Hydra boss and maybe Raids.
---
"With the release of Kebos, Aerial fishing is a more interactive method of skilling where we CAN reward players."  
---
you done got got
---
Kurasks are a bit higher GP/hr but less AFK, especially when comparing Melee Kurasks to Range Safespot Wyverns. But Kurasks also have less competition for spots. Dragon Hasta isn't good vs. Wyverns, just use whip.
---
i don't deal in hypotheticals. 
---
She seems like she‚Äôs just there to collect a check, but she does fuck all for the game.
---
Whoa hold on let me try this
---
The whole idea of buffing or nerfing something so soon is idiotic. What kind of sample size is 48 hours? Can't even get a week of something before the people start crying about it not being perfect.
---
About 4% actually and giving it no time to stabilize. We don't know where it would have ended up after a week. It would probably go back up a bit.
---
That's exactly what happened, nice
---
That looks good. 
---
:0
---
Nope. 
---
Or it could just drop mutagens cuz fuck immersion in 2019  
---
twitch.tv/chymistry has been letting people get their 1 kc, not on rn though
---
Uhh huh, still all under 200k, think I had one worth like 500k?. I'll post my clue screenshots when I get home.
---
I love how you know my account better than me.
---
The 3a drops more than "skew" the average.
---
I dunno, I feel like we should head on over to /r/traps to do some *proper* research into this topic.
---
Until you get a blue dragon task at ogres. Still having flashbacks. 
---
None of them are difficult, they artificial nuisance. There is a difference.
---
twitch.tv/chymistry has been letting people get their 1 kc, doesn't seem to be on rn though
---
just take a necklace and bury the bones for like 8 free prayer points per kill
---
Is he playing it in a pub?
---
I'm not here to argue with you.  Nor have I been a dick to anyone in runescape.  Only you princess, who is desperately seeking and needing attention from a stranger on reddit.  I can be your dad if you'd like? 
---
They killed it for the weekend so it didnt do irreversible damage to the games economy. Im sure when work hours resume monday they will get straight to work on a solution.
---
I agree with your comment. But since since you're ready for downvotes you can have mine
---
There really isn't if it reduces the difficulty of the fight, dumb dumb.
---
It is. [Here's my loot from 2 hellhounds tasks](https://i.imgur.com/tVLVrEk.png)
---
Downvoted for idiocy. I hate the nerf as well but your talking points are preposterous. 
---
Nah man, this guy looked up stats, he knows better than us. 
---
Dumb cunt.
---
/u/JagexGambit 
---
Ok thanks.
---
holyshit your such an entitled retard its incredible.
---
You have to fucking run for 10 seconds crawl up a cave and run north and your at a bank, shit drops they are there for their uniques guess who has also shit drops indeed, bandos, armadyl, saradomin and zammy but hey people camp them for their uniques if you want ez scape and afk scape get your entitled ass out of here and go to rs3
---
I was against the eternal glory too
---
Thank you! &amp; that is true, I mainly made the others just for fun, I would love to see the last form in-game tho =D
---
The other benefit of WT is not having to click a tinderbox and a log thousands of times lol
---
Yea I saw that on the wiki as well. Kinda sucks
---
I agree Zulrah blue phase is artificial, but so are many of the moves that require you to dodge - which they not difficult - they ARE a artificial nuisance.
---
konar drops whats this my accounts top 30k range and i quit like 5 years ago. whats konar.
---
They give less because the karamja diary was the first diary added to RS2. Idk why they never changed them to match the others, but they give the old rewards like they did 10 years ago
---
There aren't super ranging potions either outside of the NMZ.
---
I understand that I can get extra loot, but it's not as worth as it was.
---
Well I don't agree that it was giving out free money, since it herb drops were rare enough, hell you could even make it raree...
---
Well this table balances out drops from monsters that haven't got decent loot, greater demons task was basically huge money waste on resources, didn't even cover the basic pot or food price or even bolt price for players undsr 55 slayer...
---
They still drop resources but noone is complaining about that...
---
So herbs are a no no, but ores or unfinished bolts are cool as long as it doesn't impact farming or herblore its cool... Why can we ruin mining and fletching but not herblore and farming huh?  Doesn't sound that balanced now does it? 
---
Seriously I don‚Äôt even understand what the hell I‚Äôm meant to do in this random.
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
......what?
---
Jed Imbued 
---
taking damage from multiple people in single wilderness isn't a bug. got it.
---
Yeah I tried that but by the time I got there I'd be in like a 7 hour queue. 
---
It‚Äôs someone coming into work telling you about a different department‚Äôs fuckup, and then saying you can‚Äôt have any fun at work until the other department does their job right. 
---
Devalues my swordfish only merch account.
---
You use blowpipe on Zuk healers lol... 
---
If you're a new player, you wouldn't be in that situation in the first place.
---
"This is the most fun thing to do in RuneScape?" LMFAO
---
Teamspeak is dead, guaranteed they're using disc
---
Who's ignorance? Do you even know what flooded means? 200 herbs every 100 tasks is not going to flood shit, supplies like these have always come from PvM to some extent, and 2 more herbs per task is not going to change anything.
---
I would argue that 99 in any skill is an unreasonable expectation. For anything but super elite content. I would consider most PVMing in the game elite content.
---
Ahh thanks for the clarification, I wasn't aware of this! I still think they should update it though, while that explains why they give less xp, it isn't a good reason to keep it inconsistent with other diary rewards.
---
now he advanced from posting merch suggestions to posting troll suggestions
---
Now we just need this dude on a slayer helm to complete the hydra slayer helm trifecta.
---
*Chris Hansen voice* Have a seat over there, please.
---
Those boots will end up costing like 2k slayer points or more, because jagex is silly with slayer point numbers at times. 
---
Reward isn‚Äôt listed in the actual update [new post ](http://services.runescape.com/m=news/the-kebos-lowlands?oldschool=1#_ga=2.155922299.1569175925.1547232354-1986230680.1503570232) is what I should have said. The official wiki yesterday said that it was removed which made me check and see it was not in the update post and still isn‚Äôt, which prompted me to post this once I finished the diary 
---
That blue Phoenix is slick, love it!
---
Finally some innocent memes during these dark times
---
Which is changing the combat system, was never polled to see if players agree with it or not, and should be removed.
---
Imo, I like the red rider wagon better
---
Obtuse boast, but alas. 
---
Why is it poorly planned? I've only ever done it once for the new diary. When i arrived i didnt realise other players would have the same time and place to meet. I didnt have anything with me at all so it suprised me that there were about 8 cannons. I didnt know i was supposed to kill anyone either. I killed one dude and picked up the intelligence off the floor within a few seconds. 
---
I managed to get mine pretty early, but I really admire the foresight some had to get it pre-update after the tasks were revealed. On the bright side, at least it won't be as bad as the gouttuber task long term since intel is pretty easy to get when there aren't 10 players there.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6DNdop6pD8
---
3m in 15 minutes? Nerf incoming :/
---
It's this new scam, at least for me it is. Some guy at pvp world shows you his bank. He says you're poor then once you trade him he runs into pvp and you get rushed. 
---
Someone smarter than us did the maths and deemed it good for the economy, or they wouldn't have brought it into the game at all... funnily enough they do want their own game to do well
---
Bots already do that. 
---
I also take a crystal bow for the distance issues... but usually I'll just camp around a wall wait for everything to line up and hit the first thing in line. I've never had that much of an issue with Mages.   
---
I do Verac's Helm, and Skirt (Slayer helm if it's a task: which is the best thing to have on a Jad run next to a Blowpipe)   
---
Karil's top helps a lot with those range hits, but I still get some ranged hits.   
---
Everything else is just Blowpipe and a safe spot. 
---
The amount of people competing for it; when i was doing mine yesterday, had around 6 people on 1 one world trying to get it
---
Got it, figured as much. Yesterday i saw the official wiki page say it was removed but didn‚Äôt finish the diary till 20 minutes ago 
---
Also requires diary cape and 200M rc exp
---
not the most recent q and a, the one prior. mb
---
sickkk
---
company review website from unverified anonymous sources.
---
Permission to use this as my desktop background
---
It‚Äôll be worth much more than cerb drops since hellhounds are assigned by various masters whereas hydra is currently locked behind 1 master. Once people‚Äôs points dry up and the overall kills slow down dramatically I think we will see these up in price. 
---
Ah, that is strange. Perhaps Gambit copied from the Reveals Dev Blog rather than the Poll Dev Blog or otherwise used an earlier version before it was added in. But it was in the poll and it is in the dialog, so I'd assume it is in the game. Wiki lists it too.
---
Wish more fuckers would get this simple reality
---
Serene is a comedic genius and everything he every says is carefully calculated 
---
Worse: reddit. 
---
There is an entire new drop table as incentive for people to do these tasks...
---
Cancel it again
---
Yeah looks like wiki has since been updated but I wouldn‚Äôt have even known it wasn‚Äôt in the news post without the wiki telling me
---
Efficient or don't even bother logging in fella sorry I don't make the rules x
---
Lul comparing mining to bossing
---
Lmao
---
Herb sack and rings are a must 
---
Nerf the amount of konar nerf memes
---
My account that I mainly play on is 10 years old! I haven't played that whole time, mostly on and off until about 1.5 years ago when I got back in. 
---
There is a lot to do. I still get overwhelmed! Can't decide if I want to skill or quest or do diaries or slayer or clues. I use RuneLite's notes to keep track of my goals so I don't forget :) 
---
New bones prolly?
---
I think I did ask about the weights once they revealed Konar's table, but I don't think they gave them out yet. But the 3 new Slayer Monsters, excluding Hydra, is assigned by other Slayer Masters; though I forget who gets what.
---
Too bad, I think it looks cool. Kind of looks like the skyrim mage robes.
---
the merching cc im in are dumping d bones right now would sell if i was u 
---
Touch√©
---
Better luck next time just fyi if something seems good to be true it 99.99% of the time is that, not true. Don't trust ppl that easy :/
---
More like trying to get inside the farming guild on a busy world.
---
Define *good*
---
I don't recall the Hydra being nerfed...
---
just go bank you lazy cunt 
---
I maxed my casual account at 85 combat and made an HCIM working towards my goals, does this make me chad of virgin accounts?
---
? Its not Rs3. she talking about the mini cooper. or am I missing something
---
Aight thanks for letting me know. I guess i can update this a little when more info comes out but I doubt it would change much
---
That's why I had a good self depricating laugh. I knew better but I guess I didn't.

Weird I've been getting 186 Raw Seaturtles
---
Aight thanks for letting me know. I suppose I can update this when more info comes out, but I doubt that will change much
---
281m by my calculations.
---
So where does the scam occur? From what you said he didnt say he was going to give u anything
---
Thats why I alllllmost swiped her left
---
It is kinda silly how many complaints there are that Konar is a bit less profit per task on average while it is still like double the profit you'd make with any other skill in a mid level. That said, the low skilling profit does come up a decent bit. It is usually players acting like all of skilling is completely worthless with nothing redeeming, but still...
---
Apparently someone did the math and the nerf was actually around 50%
---
Ram Ranch ?
---
People wouldn't have been mad about the original drop table if skilling wasn't still so bad in 2019. It was a slap in the face that sparked the outroar
---
I got my first whip here thanks to this task, and proceeded to get 2 more within 100 kc. I use the far north east corner and dont get aggro from the other things
---
No. 
---
Being untradeable, you will keep your assembler on non-PvP deaths.
---
Monni was not baited this is him doing RWT.
---
Look, dumbass, I'm not going to humor you anymore. Go make a pie chart or something, stop sending me notifications. 
---
\&gt;needs gold. 
---
\&gt;has job. 
---
We made bonds for these types of players.
---
Oops, but it uses those components and they didn't just magically disappear when upgraded.
---
I'd much rather have the assemblers. Ensouled heads are dead content for non ironmen.
---
Its literally just good on Olm... Rapier is much better for every other part of both raids that a stab weapon is preferable. And its actually not even that much better than Rapier on Olm for that matter, you literally do NOT need it if you have a rapier (or Scythe for that matter) unless you want a slight DPS increase on Olm but have it be worse everywhere else (if you dont want to bring Rapier as well because of inventory spot). I dont think it should be buffed to 30% on Olm though, they should buff it to 30% but keep it at 20% in raids on Olm. 
---
It really blows my mind people are trying to say its OP right now or would be OP if its buffed to what the DHCB is, because right now its underwhelming in many places compared to the top 1 or 2 options and DHCB is much better on most everything. Im guessing these people have not used it and are parroting what others say or theyre referring to it becoming OP on just Olm but it shouldnt be prevented from being rightfully buffed elsewhere because of a single boss in Raids.
---
Please do another one for Earth Warriors, thanks.
---
Alright cool. Thanks
---
Such a stupid name 
---
Fuck that shit, those people are utter degenerates. They don‚Äôt get a free pass for being depraved individuals. 
---
Condemning the act of dressing up as animals isn't correlated with pedophilia, quite the contrary. Reading comprehension, look it up.
---
That makes sense. 
---
Wonder if there is a way to work in superior hunter monsters
---
If your slayer level is sub like 75 you are not making much money 
---
Or at LEAST make the bones give more xp than dragon bones... Or drop them noted, or something...
---
They look awesome, and their death mechanic is super cool. But it's a cancel task already
---
Good. I hope it happens again. 
---
This at Castle wars have me PTSD
---
Wow even with environmental sounds? How sad :(
---
There is more places than just wilderness were to use it, raids is a good example, there is places where you just cant wear graceful set.
---
No but it is altered enough you could say they don't resemble those components. 
---
&gt;Doesn't want to play at max efficiency
---
Says the ones mad with the nerf and claiming it dead content. Because screw fun, what matters is efficiency.
---
Next one will be crocadiles, Stay tuned!
---
Normalizing the act of being overly attracted and interested in innocent animals can't be labeled as "minding one's own business". Let's be clear what we're dealing with here.
---
They need to be reminded they are a stain on our society and their fathers should have done a better job. 
---
&gt;flared creative 
---
Actually, this is better. This spawn is like 5 tiles from a bank, and you can take another if there‚Äôs already one in your inventory. Unlike your POH that‚Äôs one at a time and not close to a bank. 
---
some goldengnome level stuff right there
---
Hunter now too :)
---
RSN - SayAnything
---
30 raw monks? Goes completely against what was in the dev blog. Though I expected a shit comment anyways
---
Being highly invested in the game and progressing rapidly doesn't imply or correlate with rl success. Unless you're alluding to subjective emotions.
---
You know this is how people destroy their f5 keys, right?
---
Higher range and defense is an advantage. I‚Äôd say the quest bosses become doable without excessive frustration around 75 range/70 defense and obviously they get easier from there. Higher prayer makes things a little easier too I guess. Less pots/access to that higher level eagle eye (forget the name). 
---
Honestly I click this shit on my mobile phone and it's so funny when the dude logs onto a level 3 and I message him. "Got ya, hahahaha" I've had a few respond saying I'm pretty smart
---
i've gotten 2 so far both from tree runs
---
When they introduce a new monster they don‚Äôt have to pool every aspect of it, but they do have to poll it if they want to make it weaker. If they did decide to poll all of your suggestions, I‚Äôm sorry but they‚Äôd have to be connected to a drop table nerf for each one and as a result would likely be vetoed.
---
Every clip of him I see is always him going down for big amounts of money. Just like Skill Specs.
---
I always wonder how their banks survive the constant losses like that.
---
Thats Royal seed pod
---
The issue here is I'm pre 75 slayer. 
---
Not how the entire community feels. I think it is easy to do, but the reward is probably the worst in the game.
---
Cuz if you acidently smash thay B2P button on a inv full of dag bones, reddit will upboat how dumb you are.
---
They can be, but why would they waste the time when they can do more consistent skill methods for money without risking loss if the bot fails.
---
It's more relatable for the casual consumer = Increased ROI in terms of recognition, score, and post success. Has to be done, apparently!
---
Show us the "starting out" section
---
Yep 
---
What movie is this? 
---
this cc gets raided like every other week 
---
Tassets are 34m now?! What happened?

I think you can get there without the quest.

Nice blowpipes you guys have there

The ballad of buster Scruggs. It's like 6 short on Netflix. 4 of the 6 are worth the watch

Did you get them on checking health? Clearing? Did you pay a farmer to clear for you?

Ironman cc
---
That's what happens when you undermine and essentially brush over certain fanatic groups in society!
---
the good ones arent
---
I can understand that. Personally I block ice warriors during wildies slayer lol. I was a Lower lvl so they took way to long and didn‚Äôt drop loot
---
Even after the nerf Konar is far from dead content.
---
Getting magic seeds is still amazing for the "virgin" players.
---
Feel bad for the devs sometimes, sometimes they shoot themselves in the foot but other times...
---
it was really good on release day, dropping nests, blue dragon scales etc.
---
I've considered that, but for the trouble of switching it on at the end of every kill and waiting 9 seconds to get the effect and trying to get everything done before hydra respawns, all to save 1-2 super restores when the item itself uses up 1 inventory slot that coulda been a super restore it just doesn't feel worth it.
---
Bones to peaches would actually be insanely useful at hydra though it's like getting a monkfish after every kill.
---
It's all about demand, fangs are cheap because nobody is using that many teleport charges for them to leave the game in large quantities, making them worthless drop from shamans and raids in general, agility potion as a part of other potion would see demand, stamina potions would have more than one use and that is increased demand and price, making the stamina pot price increase.
---
buster Scruggs.
---
That's osrs. If you don't like it then stop playing instead of trying to change it into rs3 minus eoc
---
I got at check health

cool, good to know.

idk man i have never seen a good furry
---
Can the winners sue Jagex for this?
---
Imagine enjoying a game when you could be extremely angry and shitpost on reddit, thats what im down for. 
---
thanks! 
---
Substitute the Armadyl skirt and helmet for a Verac helm and skirt. You‚Äôll sacrifice some range bonus but you‚Äôll get better defense bonus and some prayer bonus. Besides that, I‚Äôm not sure how you could possibly be having such a hard time. Look up the OSRS wiki‚Äôs Fight Caves strategy guide they tell you where to pray what protection prayer etc and the order in which to kill monsters in each wave.
---
Fallout?
---
Fair enough yeah. It is possible that either of these issues could be very technically difficult to fix because of how the game handles multizones / PvP loot assignment based on damage dealt.
---
How does this not have atleast 4k upvotes? Its incredible

Furry because I think attacking people randomly is weird? Sweet logic. If you didn't know, you can't post in reddit without an account so that's why this one was made :) I suggest you stop breathing because as of now, you are literally wasting the oxygen actual people could use.

damn son you saved a whole 10 minutes of fishing with that
---
You can downgrade to a med and an easy but you can't cancel an easy.
---
Yeah its more about the general consensus ive seen on this sub with people for some reason clamoring AGAINST it being buffed. WDR also doesnt mention that Rapier is still perfectly viable and actually not far behind the current lance at all on Olm. 
---
Like DHCB was originally 20% and it wasnt that great so they rightfully buffed it so that people would actually use it. And Lance w/20% isnt even as good as when DHCB was 20%, yet people were crying for DHCB to be buffed and that lance shouldnt be buffed??? It literally makes no sense, and thats not even considering the fact DHCB gets enchanted bolts and the fact your much more mobile(which leads to higher DPS when you arent DPSing in a vacuum) with it and can safe spot things with it. It would be silly not to buff it and try and make it at least close to on par with DHCB, since DHCB still has the benefits I just said above and would probably still be favored. Like I said, it should be kept at 20% for Olm but that shouldnt prevent it from being buffed everywhere else. 
---
Im just tired of RangeScape man uk, like even if Lance became slightly better than DHCB somehow then id actually be completely fine with that since DHCB and range has been completely dominating the top for so long now that id welcome ONE melee weapon actually being able to compete. 
---
I understand that, I called it the Wiki bot because I know the word wiki triggers it to pin itself at the top of the comments, I just think that's a bit ham handed. It would be better to have the thing trigger when a link to the old wiki is posted
---

---
When I got my first one, I thought they'd like you have one for each tier. Instead, I just got stuck with a low tier one. Now I got Grow a Redwood as my first high tier and while I do want to finish it, it would be nice if I could still take a med or low contract alongside.
---
So you legit created an account just to respond to me. Thought you didn‚Äôt care about Reddit

I hate the hood but I like the color

No, not soul rune. We already have a crazy number of rc reqs in the elite diaries. But another high req could be good.

This is funny but usually, 2k world is nothing like this. I mean people there barely speak and even when they do it is often about bossing and economy.

That's just how it is bro. And for good reason, touch your thumbs together in the middle of your screen holding your device on both sides like you would playing the game. Now bring your thumbs to a comfortable rest position on the sides of the phone without straining your thumbs to get closer to your hand. Bet you land right on the ui

I have no idea why you are being downvoted. Maybe new casual mobile players or something? The community was at a point in time up in arms against XP rate changes in almost any form. Personally I feel like the drop table was broken, as most new slayer content is. Nothing should ever be dropping tons of skilling resources period, since it's a massive devaluation of the majority of skilling content (See: RS3).
---
How you got downvoted so hard is beyond me, OSRS doesn't need higher XP rates. We don't need to cater to casuals. It's great that people want to play Runescape, but you can't expect to do the same things nearly as efficiently as a high level years-invested player does if you aren't willing to do the same.

He‚Äôs definitely not super buff

I hate him. Why is he back?

Why did he want to find out what's going on while risking so much?

you lose defensives, prayer, and 5 str bonus for 20% dmg to dragon types. what do u not get homie?
---
I'm not getting baited by answering this 
---
He is doing 3 tick pickup
---
&gt; No they shouldnt the constantly moving is what makes it hard your literally asking them to make it so you can sit still and just have to prayer switch. 
---
Again, if you prefer EoC's complexity, there is Rs3.
---
I never said i cannot do them, i said i do not approve of them, these heretical ideas needs to be purged out.
---
Make sure to look at the high volume items, that's a big portion of my profits. As well as seeds. Love those.
---
My cash stack is about 40m. I don't try to go over 50m because then there is too much cash that isn't moving in my opinion. I would really recommend selling and getting a bigger cash stack. I would find the margins of the items you are going to sell and try to sell them high. For instance: if you have a guthans set buy one set high and sell it low then buy a couple extra and just test how long they sell. So you don't lose out on a bit of money. 
---
Most of my items take 1 minute - 20 minutes to buy and sell. Like tanzanite fangs, they have goos margins usually but take too long sell for me to like to sell them often. 
---
do yourself a favour and download runelite 
---
If there was room for something like you've suggested itd probably fit better in pyrifddinas update later in the year.
---
This is actually real. Anyone had this happen before? 
---
idk maybe it was supposed to be a harder boss until it became moneydragon, iirc they nerfed it right after release too
---
It shouldn't matter. If your shield is taking enough damage to die you're doing it wrong 100%.
---
Good point
---
She‚Äôs pretty sexy for being a dude you can‚Äôt deny that 
---
Please give us a median instead of average too, the high gp/hour is because of a rare 35m drop that takes you 10 hours to get.

Congrats, this is a big achievement. Don't be so humble.

why don‚Äôt you do those things?

Why?

Ohhh yeah i totally feel you there. It‚Äôs getting really old that anything besides range is a waste of your time and energy. 
---
I have the new lance and gloves + bis melee gear and max combat and did a Wyvern slayer task and the lance noodled so hard, multiple 0‚Äôs in a row and some ranger with blessed dhide, dhide boots, dhcb and anguish walks up and out dpsed me on the majority of kills. Like why Jagex. 
---
I have made it to Jad every attempt I made. No advice anyone can give me will help in the slightest. I simply need to learn the pray switches on Jad.
---
Nice try Serene.
---
38 RC but 1 farming. Yikes
---
This hurt to read 
---
Btw there isn‚Äôt a world for these anymore right? So how does one find out when they are going on
---
&gt;Personally I think the drop table were a bit too generous on certain items
---
No it wasnt. My combats were in the 70s when I hit 70 slayer. I could've camped wyverns with a 1 10k drop of 8 mil. 
---
Or a 1/80k drop of 2 mil worth of herbs.

It‚Äôs why many companies pay a third party to handle these things, why those type of services even exist.

I won a studio tour several years ago. Couldn't make it due to health reasons, rescheduled it with Ayiza and the other community manager (can't remember his name currently). Ended up being ignored on Twitter and reddit after I confirmed the dates i would be able to make. 
---
Sad really because I've wanted to see the studio for around 15 years. 
---
garbage. I skipped the task like 20 kills in.

That's good for you mate, better than average.

that colour scheme is so nice.

No one on this sub has ever had a cast iron/wok before apparently

You kinda answered your own question. Because after mid level you have access to the bosses, so regular tasks arent your main source of income amymore

But think of all the riveting conversation you'll miss out on. 
---
I'm 84 Combat no helm of neitiznot but i have nikes
---
But each of them has their own corner to stand in when it comes to combat. Magic provides utility. Freezes, sustain, tele block, venge etc. Range is consistent dps while moving (almost always going to be the highest damage over time unless they give the boss absurd ranged defense and low magic level to combat the tbow). Melee provides sustained afk dps, stackable burst, and no usage cost.
---
Should just make rune dragon alts like my and not waste your time going after spades and glories.
---
Not if your trying to get somewhere, like DKS dungeon or something. 
---
Do maxed OSRS players really like to stake? Why?
---
How about an 'Token of balance' that you can bring to Konar in exchange for extra slayer point?
---
As long as they have drops that are unique to them they are fine. Not everything needs to be insanely profitable every time. 
---
Can't believe I fell for it tbh.

He's refererring to the outcome of[ this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/adprwh/my_3rd_max_party_10bill_giveaway_fally_party_room/?sort=new) (ended up being a lie).

personally I got pet at 22kc head at 50 and I didn‚Äôt intend on doing any more vorkath, lost my ava‚Äôs doing kbd though and had to go back. It averages an hour or so to get a head, it‚Äôd be really annoying if it was any more

---
Right clicking wouldn‚Äôt have done anything 
---
But somehow many people are fine with it rn and fine with DHCB which is far better andhas the benefit of taking less damage, more mobility on top of doing much better dps lmfao. I really don‚Äôt get these people‚Äôs arguments outside of Olm which I completely agree it should stay at 20% on but you can‚Äôt not change it everywhere else because if that single fight.
---
Found the guy in the uni flat that just leaves his shit lying in the sink
---
That does not seem to line up with what is polled. A "25% chance to ignore 10% of the target's total magic defence" should work more like a Verac's or Diamond Bolt effect where it reduces for that attack, not stat reduction like DWH.
---
Well fuck me I guess

It sucks cause im not rich at all and i was looking forward to making some decent money while slaying. Oh well.

I think it was supposed to be a cross between Second Life and Clash of Clans.

When 07 first launched there was a site everyone posted what they were selling and their world, price, etc. Then they added the trading post which was some weird hybrid between that site and the GE. Then everyone realized how we were just using a version of the GE, but with more steps.

No, anime in general is not weird as shit. Some of it is, but not in general. There are some fantastic series out there. Like Monster, Mushishi, and Cowboy Bebop. Hopefully, Guillermo del Toro will manage to sell his idea for a live-action, TV series adaptation of Monster.

 So this could be used to theoretically lower zuk magic accuracy and def to 0 so you could just face tank it if your shield get broken ü§î

For a high level player I think it is. You can get much better xp with Duradel and make much more money elsewhere.

The gp/xp trade off isn‚Äôt worth it in its current state for high levels imo.

Having a lower magic attack bonus will always reduce your chance of rolling a an accurate hit. However, if your opponent is a monster with level 1 magic, as long as your magic attack bonus is above -20 or so, your accuracy is still high, and adding more magic gear will only affect your accuracy very minorly, therefore it is better (will save more time) to wear e.g. prayer gear (slayer bursting) or tank gear (barrows). Hope that makes sense. 
---
Sure add me buschildlove
---
theres a med clue step that requires addy boots. there are a ton of hard clues that require med/hard clue items, or require neches unlocked etc.
---
People are also upset because he hadn‚Äôt even tried it out yet before requesting it to be nerfed, just saw a couple people get lucky drops. 
---
Banking is not worth it for mains, and it's less gp/hr than Vorkath and Zulrah (will even get worse as prices of uniques crash) so it's not as good as you claim.

Are you sure you were on the real site?

Never really thought about that.

If you can pull 5m/hr you're not too far off of a minimum wage job. For those that don't know, OSRS GP goes for about 1m/$1 right now.

Wild.

Sorry to hear that, I‚Äôm not sure what to do besides wait for Jagex to get back to you but I think your account security is the problem. While you wait, I would change your email password, your rs password, make sure you have an Authenticator set up, bank pin. Good luck, upvoted for visibility.

Underrated meme

I need a picture of this

At 91 fishing and 89 hunter I'm getting half the xp rates of 99 and 1 pearl per 30 minutes. All I'd want to see buffed is the pearls. 
---
Have you tried going to the canyon to see if the kills will count in there as well?
---
Lol nice name.
---
What's the background sound track from
---
Lol does anyone remember the time faux was streaming Corp and someone said it‚Äôs boring content and faux got super super confrontational and started berating the guy talking about how Corp is some of the highest risk content for hcim? Like anyone wants to watch that shit
---
100% of people below level 75 can not do konar slayer
---
Pretty sure it's 73
---
Much better than say, tassets, for less than half the price.
---
52 is a medium req for sure. 
---
But is it possible to get 200 quest points without RFD?
---
Shut up serene‚Äôs alt
---
I have not. I figured there's no point since the canyon is a completely different area altogether :/
---
dunno why you kids are worried about this nobody is veng bombing you for your hide set mate
---
nah, a post made it to the front page and had gold stating he was hosting a 10bil drop party. i assumed it was real because i thought posts like that had to be approved but i guess not.

ironman idc about gp/hr
---
gl tho
---
ironman btw
---
What the fuck did you just say about Mr. Pocket?
---
probably yeah but rfd isn‚Äôt the hard part of B gloves at all it‚Äôs getting the 176 QP. and it‚Äôs not going to mess up pure builds because they require 80 defense to wear 
---
I got the exact same drop on my first kill this morning, it sold for 8.5m. They need to nerf this now, this is getting out of hand /s
---
That makes no sense. Brutal blacks are an entirely different slayer monster that require 77 slayer. Drakes aren't even dragons, they're drakes
---
What the fuck did you just say to me you little noob? I'll have you know I have an untrimmed cooking cape... 
---
Watching Monni get dropped for max again
---
Priceless.
---
Oh snap! 
---
i would wait till 82 con tbh. Or at least 65 for spec pool, and get 2 bgs specs off each kill. 
---
Also a blowpipe is a good deal more dps than the arclight, at the expense of some defence
