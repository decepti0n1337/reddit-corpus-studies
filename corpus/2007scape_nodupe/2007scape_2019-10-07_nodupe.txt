Haha, true. Crazy you have 99 slayer but don't have that quest complete!
---
---
---
True. Last thing I remember reading up on, I thought bird house runs and farming could be a way for that? Would that work if that’s the only two I did for gp?
---
Imagine being this angry over a video game. Go get yourself a therapist.
---
Thanks. Didn’t hear about this. I’ll take a look.
---
Inb4 they make that runescape 3 runecraft update again
---
F for cerb if that happens lmao

Mate, shit like what you're saying is why they need to delete the 07 subreddit. Framed is a pvp youtuber whose videos are 99.5% pvp
---
[removed]
---
Yes
---
Thats genius
---
I'm sure there's a good idea in there man, not knocking at all, I can at least respect someone trying to come up with ideas that stops this game being all about sweaty virgins with public off and entity hider on. 
---
The only issues I'd have with this are, the majority of people are going to be internet strangers, maybe one or two irl friends if they still play, and in my experience you can never trust an internet stranger, on RuneScape. Say if they're leader of the ironclan, there's nothing stopping them from kicking you once you've brought the clan a shit ton of goods, because in the end you "got on their nerves" or something. And then you'll get the twats that only log in every few days, don't give anything into the cc but take supplies and equipment willy-nilly, or of course die with everything you worked for in an instanced area. 
---
There's probably work arounds for literally everything I've just said though. 
---
But I see your point, and I bet it would be a very fun way of playing. There's be something very nice about having a clan bank tab, a clan POH with bossing &amp; late game ornaments and collections, just new content in general exclusive to the play style.
---
Edit: I guess a solution could be clan rep. You could build reputation by providing supplies and equipment to the clan. You can then withdraw items based on your rep, to stop a level 3 chad that just joined withdrawing every single god tier item for example. Then if you get minus clan rep for being a massive chad, losing the clans items or being reported within the clan for behavioural issues, which means once you leave the clan you could have trouble building your own or joining another clan in the future.
---
You could definitely do it with those stats but more mage would help a lot
---
They wont do this because there is no way for jagex to track peoples first 99.
---
Serious question, I know it’s against the rules to use software to auto click but could someone make a literal robot that would just press the mouse button over and over again to alch stuff?
---
I do this, but it would be slower than just cancelling with Duradel assuming you had Karamja Elite gloves.
---
Oh no..
---
So I’m not alone. I’m at 930k xp dry of getting it. Getting close to 1m xp lol
---
nice shootin
---
who wins in energy tonage output on this lethalboi vs a salt gun? cap? wasp
---
reload times? rpm?
---
Well you didnt need to pray mage or worry about auto retaliate before the update, so id say he didnt miss something
---
Careful, that much salt is unhealthy, especially with your already unhealthy normie account
---
White. 100% zeah
---
I feel like most people are pvm noobs when they learn zulrah.  But yeah absolutely your stats are plenty good enough to give it a go
---
Chocobo goes hard af
---
Alright then...
---
So if I understand this correctly and I used myemail+1@gmail.com for an account signup I would use the +1 to login right? It would just funnel the emails to the main one without the numbers right?
---
I’ve been power dropping all my fish. Kinda wish I had banked everything so I could see my collection lol
---
I’d give you a gold if I wasn’t broke irl
---
I'm genuinely so fucking upset this whole thing could have been avoided . I thought I had the ring on a pure in the past. That's why I thought the quest didn't get def xp .. I could have still checked though.. like why the fuck didn't I even check I'm actually mind blown I'm so sad
---
Yes, please do but if you could also explain why people enjoy these vids - that'd also be great
---
yeah i get what u mean. my idea isnt really solid but i just kinda heard about group ironman and my friends would love to do that, but i was thinking about what happens when one leaves to go military, it would be locked to duo ironman and it would be cool to have more than just small groups and open it up to larger squads of like 6-10 in a clan
---
It’s a good start, you’ll just have to get your stats up and unlock better content
---
This relates to that situation where a friend was banned for advertising a gambling website in a YouTube video. 
---
Jagex claimed they would make a rule about that situation AND what you're talking about. Where streamers do 'sub only giveaways' which is blatant rwt.
---
But also, I heard Jagex wants to ALLOW that stuff as long as it's not a raffle/gambling thing. Like donate for more tickets, etc? Idk.
---
Jagex won't ever do the 'gambling via RuneScape' rule that was regarding the a friend situation because it would contradict sand casino.
---
Pretty sure he’s mush trolling, guys lol
---
MM2 took me six
---
Oh I can’t fucking wait
---
KC 561 was my first Armadyl drop... from Kree. By KC 200, had 2 ACP and 1 Skirt off minions.
---
Lmao I was helping friends earlier with it, did I see you.
---
The game doesn't track your first 99, so anyone who already has multiple 99s still wouldn't be able to buy an untrimmed cape.
---
Though, I don't know why they don't just remove the automatic trimming when you get another.  Just let it stay untrimmed without having to jump through hoops.
---
Hydra is already insane money an update like this is completey unnecessary.
---
You might have 
---
I only seen like 2 people the whole time though
---
If skill was involved then the entire wilderness would be singles zone, with pj timers of 15+ seconds. The fact that people need to fall in on 1 person to secure a kill means it takes no skill to get a kill. NH pure bridding takes skill/out predicting your opponent, can't argue against that.
---
Noted drops are just the future. This is the direction Jagex has taken the game for close to 5 years now.
---
You don't want people looking over your shoulder. Have you seen how short the privacy walls are on those booths?
---
My other concern is why they choose to make everyone an ironman. That just makes it more grindy and RNG based for stuff like DWH.
---
Should be lower stats than bronze, weejng how it js made of mud.

Normal ironmen can work with anyone for SoA and hero's, they'll probably just leave it like that.

Straight facts out here with my boy
---
If you are dumb enough to get skull tricked your IQ is literally zero. Also it's not dumb to put them there or those items would be worth 3m. Btw you don't have to get any of the wilderness rings because they are only bis in like 2 situations.

---
And a fucking stupid gatekeep at that. Any drive over 4 hours is a mission.
---
yeah let me just go call my maxed friends to carry me through end-game bossing, thanks
---
Playing the way they want by influencing more efficient methods being added to the game disgusts me. They're shutting down content for thousands of other players because they think their xp has value. And adding faster more efficient methods has NOTHING to do with hiscores. It they're going for 200m xp, they'll have just as much access to the method as anyone else.
---
MM2 isn't that bad, SOTE and DS2 are more difficult.  Both of the boss fights in MM2 can be safespotted or flinched and nieve will fight the demonic gorillas for you.

**I'm writing this in bold so you remember: before you go in to fight Kruk, there is a passageway you should open that let's you bypass the agility course so you can go straight back to him**

You're thinking way too logically and realistically for many RS players, my friend.
---
A jmod (I think Ayiza) said it was okay a few years ago. Someone still got banned for it though.
---
How is it quality of life?
---
Honestly this whole thing is just brilliant. 
---
It could be total coincidence, but if not, this guy is doing a 200IQ power move on us.

*UIM Verf has joined the chat I think most people have never even used thrown weapons lol*

That is just straight up not true.

Do you think England is the land of no hunters and they blend everything because they can't cut food without any knives?
---
Yeah when I had my iron I didn't have issues with that, I just wasnt sure how much they were going to lock Group Ironman for these things.
---
So no barrows pet?
---
1) I've decided to hold off on starting Dragon Slayer until I can comfortably kill iron and steel dragons. What stats should I shoot for? I don't mind if they're slow, I just don't want to spend a few minutes per dragon.
---
Edit: To clarify, the quest is easy. The issue is iron and steel dragons are a pain to kill. If I don't start Dragon Slayer, they won't be assigned as a slayer task. What stats would I need to kill them comfortably?
---
2) I just unlocked Fossil Island, and have been growing hardwoods and doing bird house run. Are there any other features I should be taking advantage of as a low level account? (40 combat, most skills 30-50, 60 farming)
---
3) Does the bottomless compost bucket add a significant amount of profit to herb runs, or is it mostly a quality of life thing?
---
4) How much investment does the brewing minigame require? I may want to add it to my dailies for a bit of profit.
---
Devalues my untrimmed 99 Cooking Iron Chef account. No support.
---
They do not.
---
How many brews / restores are you bringing?
---
because if you don't have herb sack you have to keep banking. If you have herb sack it saves you invent space so it's still useful. 
---
It's QoL because you don't have to bank as much.
---
It’s really popular for pking since you get access to better bolts aka more dps. Also seems like the majority of the noobs/gold farmers at Wyverns/Kurasks use it.
---
You can't say for certain it was just for fun. He didn't know Rendi was drunk and from the context of it all, Rendi sounded like he thought he put in more effort into his Jad video and thus Lil Smokey did not deserve the win.
---
If I called your best friend a fat piece of shit in front of your face, you'd probably beat the shit out of me because what I did is a fucking dick move. You wouldn't think, "Oh hey this guy is drunk let's leave him alone."
---
Minigame shop passed with 0 rewards. They've always said it can enter the game but has to have something with it.
---
I believe by "personalised" hitsplats you mean the one that lets you know which hit is yours and which is everyone else's? That is still being worked on in the engine side.
---
Zezima cc always "raids" our cc by hopping in and spamming n***er
---
I'm convinced they are all angry 12 year olds.
---
If maxing perhaps, majority won't do that and RC is kinda pointless on iron. It's not even slightly needed.
---
I’ll be checking out your series! I definitely want to go hard on the league while I chill afk stuff on my main

Undercutting you by 1gp
---
[deleted]
---
What happens when they come back?
---
i assume the majority play a single account at a time, a temp league means they can't progress the main game.
---
i have a feeling that this and GIMP will be long term failures that jagex will cling to like DMM and keep trying to reiterate with ideas until they finally get the chop.
---
Tbh I thought that was the agility guild
---
OSRS has been out for 6 and a half years. Not anything crazy to have a high level alt and a main at this point. Especially if you played at pivotal points in the games life cycle. At one point you could literally afk 6 hours at NMZ with Guthans while you slept or went to work, or use free runes from NMZ to barrage in a group dream which was also afk.
---
They talked about this in a stream and said they wouldn't be against doing it as it's similar to other Poh teleports
---
So it might happen
---
2.5m-3m an hour is worth the exp loss.
---
Sorry I wasn’t trying to be arrogant. Just was happy I got the drop...
---
They could implement a way now anyway for accounts that don't have a 99 yet
---
calling someone a weapon is an insult lol
---
Well I'm assuming you'd have to make a choice to either keep them in your group and just play without them or kick them/replace
---
They haven't released really any information about it and it seems like a fair way away
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/noisygifs/comments/98bqla/mini_cannon
---
gratz anyway
---
I beat it with 84 mage and 85 range with 45 defense. Its definitely possible! The hardest thing is just learning the rotations, but once you do it right a couple of times it gets pretty easy
---
Jagex: \*sees threats of rioting if they add mtx\* what if we just give them a reason to pay more willingly? Ya know, like they've been begging for.
---
"Holy Shit."
---
  ~25_Buttholes
---
Yeah I mean that’s a part of how this whole “Old School Runescape” thing started in the first place. The point of not powercreeping xp rates isn’t just beneficial for those who have already trained the skill, it also keeps the grind rewarding for people to know that it’s not ever a wasted effort to start training a skill because there’s no inevitable update coming down the line that’s going to buff xp rates that they should of just waited for. The community perception of powercreep has changed over time as more new players and casual players have started playing, if we didn’t have a culture dedicated to maintaining game integrity and slowing powercreep we would be at RS3 rates already, as the game has already been out for 6 years. There’s nothing wrong with updating skills and adding more varied ways to train but if we just started buffing xp rates there would be no point.
---
Sucks to be them? 
---
Have a talk with your friends, determine if they plan on coming back or not when they quit.
---
Just run that one through box traps for free chin hunting anywhere now
---
Yea but you can only pull that trick so many times before people stop trusting you and move on. There's quite a few top twenty RuneScape streamers that legitimately take loans from their viewers for content (and for staking). (Alfie/Hyphonix/Odablock/Abyss)
---
I finished MM2 last night. Started 9 PM, ended at 2:30 AM
---
fat weeb mmo player is racist, shocker
---
I disagree, if the point is work together as much as possible you should be able to share items as easily as possible
---
It's all preference, do what you're most comfortable with. Most high level pvmers I know don't play resizable but I speedrun tob on resizable just fine.
---
One thing you can do to make resizable better is to turn on stretch mode in runelite. It will make the ui bigger with your screen and you can choose how big/small it goes.
---
If I get 3a melee I'm alching it, already decided lol
---
It's bad on Facebook :(  
---
Literally see it 3-5 times a week lol
---
Ancient Zygomites too. Pretty sure a few of the Fossil Wyvern herb drops are noted too.
---
They want the shards to be brought in game via thieving, there will barely be any cost in obtaining them. As a one time permanent upgrade, it is unlikely to pass a poll. Also the new vampire thieving method ends up being dead content as soon as a player gains the shard if only 1 is needed.
---
That's a little too ambitious.... I'd settle for 100M
---
The thing is, if they're getting carried then they'll have less points, which means less loot and lower chance of a purple. So they already have diminished rewards if they try to leech. If they're pulling their fair weight, then they'll have similar points to other players, in which case there isnt really a reason to penalize them anyways.
---
The idea sounds good at first, but it causes a bunch of issues while solving something that isn't really a problem in the first place.
---
ToB on the other hand doesnt penalize players as harshly if they can deal decent enough damage, so I could understand limiting ToB for group iron. Plus tob is 5 players max and is pretty efficient at any team size.
---
Let’s call it muddy armor
---
give this guy a golden gnome already
---
My alching strategy is to pick up my wireless mouse and walk around the house for a bit. With no mouse movements, that must look very bot like.
---
Jagex afraid to give 25_buttholes a golden gnome because they're afraid of saying buttholes on stage.
---
Yeah I imagine they'll try creating as many storage places as possible to lighten the load on your bank like seed vault and clue stashes.
---
I think a second bank would have a lot of advantages especially for people that want to say keep a slayer or bossing tab or try a from nothing or scratch but doesn't want to ruin their current bank.
---
But I don't see them doing it, hopefully I'm wrong haha
---
You cant really boss yet with those stats, train your slayer to 80s and by then you will have better money for gear and stats for bossing
---
You can change your username, but you have to hope someone else doesn't snatch it before you.
---
Im just unsure what bosses are viable for me. I know im definitely nowhere near top tier. As far as melee combat goes I have full dragon gear, dragon defender, abyssal whip, and fury amulet. Ranged is blue dragonhide and rune crossbow, and magic tbh im totally lost on. I have no idea what a good setup would be at my level for that.
---
Yeah, I feel the same way. I think the lack of hype is a combination of awkward timing, and a lot of the osrs community not being super familiar with leagues. A lot seemed to think that only high scores mattered at first, then got even more confused when some of the challenges were really challenging. I can't even bring myself to play normal oldschool now that I know league's are coming personally. Like you said, it's a fun new way to experience the game with some new twists while having to come up with your own ideas/plans/theory of how to get things done.
---
They've discussed this in the past and deemed it unfair for people who have already achieved 99s prior to this update. So basically you're rewarding newer players whilst, essentially, punishing older, loyal players.
---
You think calling someone a child and kicking them when they're down is "not a jerk in any capacity"? Do you have an emotional need that wasn't met that one of us on the internet can help with?
---
Its a shame so many people don't even know Great Orb Project existed. It was a minigame that needed as much reactions, strategy and depth as pking.
---
&gt; and I usually just pick up a few coin drops before the task is over and its more than enough to get me to the next task. and the tree is noticeably closer than the poh portal. 
---
Sorry, we were talking about planting spirit trees so i assumed we were talking about training farming, not slayer. It doesn't matter where in brimhaven (portal or spirit tree), cos i will need to run to calquat patch anyway and if you're not already doing your daily calquat runs, you are losing out on a lot of cheap xp.
---
1. Do you get more birds nest from higher tier birdhouses? I'm onto mahogony ones and they don't seem much more effective than when i started doing runs with oak
---
2. Does farming level affect herb yield?
---
3. Is it worth investing in construction at all until you have enough money to get it to 60 or so? Doesn't seem like any of the low/mid tier unlocks do anything useful
---
Activity usually spikes on weekends. It looks like this is the US (West) world, not an activity world, so that's not why.
---
Lol not all of it is a switch, I just grabbed the Guthan's and slapped it on
---
Quality
---
Would be fun playing on 2 accounts and having your iron camp melee while your main mage skips.
---
Any tips for a f2p low level noob to get back into osrs?
---
People are so serious with the waste of developement time and I couldnt agree more this this post.
---
Noted drops are fine but sometimes it makes no sense.
---
For example, Shamans should (and do) drop noted herbs because they're at a pretty common rate and they drop several at a time so it'd be tedious to make people pick up several unnoted herbs at a time.    
---
On the flipside, rune dragons, basilisk knights, drakes etc. drop individual noted herbs and it's pretty rare to get more of the same one in a single trip which makes very little sense, especially when the herb sack is supposed to be for cleaning up the random herb drops that most monsters have.
---
Put the ring on Entrana so you need Lumby elite.
---
got it. thanks! thats good to hear
---
Just join a clan
---
oh yeah, I was just giving my reasoning as to why I would plant it in brimhaven over any other spot, as I like to train slayer the most, and since I don't have Karamja gloves 4, the next fastest way to get to duradel I believe would be the spirit tree to cart, hence where I put my first spirit tree.
---
So cute
---
What if a player stops playing isn't a concern? Hmmmmn 
---
I'm asking about the implementation, I'm not begging for changes, don't be daft
---
Then it's something like pyramid plunder after 91, right? Let me just turn that 6 upside down real quick.
---
I agree that everything is too safe which is why I'd like to see them do something about it. However, 10 minutes is still more than enough time to get just about anywhere even GWD boss rooms because ecumenical keys exist all you're doing is cutting out the shopping trip.
---
Americans learn everything from Facebook memes.
---
I am not.
---
Any clan suggestions?
---
See I support this post cause its that reason alone why i always never bring and utilize the herb sack anywhere but herbivore
---
Pm me: 40 o z
---
Go to the runescape forums and head to the osrs clan section. Hundreds of clans there, good luck!
---
Vorkath
---
Demonic Gorillas
---
Alchemical Hydra
---
Zulrah
---
Yeah, remember to switch to menaphite at 65
---
Same thing happened to me. I can't get a single soul at Jagex to look into it for me. I need to move on from this game if this is how they repay 13 years of loyalty.
---
Yeah you don't know me, I was asking out of curiosity, not because I want to screw people over. I'm only going to be playing it with one friend either way.
---
Wanna pass 8 if those kraken tentacles this way? Plz and ty.
---
I only mention it because the community isn't fan of cosmetics in any other form. Holiday events are okay, because as is tradition. Clue scrolls are fine because the community likes clue scrolls, and they know some of it needs to be alch value garbage, and worthless cosmetics. There's a weird in-between spot for cosmetics in this game where is has to be more a reward for something you do in game.
---
Like the community doesn't like the twitch promotional cosemetics or things of that nature.
---
A quest where you find a troll child in the farming guild. Turns out to be My arms son. Then after the quest he gets the name green cloth
---
1. Yes, but it's slight. 
---
2. Yes, also slight.
---
3. First useful unlock is at 47 iirc: mounted glory is tremendously useful. Also an altar and eventually restoration pool is real good.
---
They mentioned "other loot items" but didn't elaborate. Probably some assorted low level gear, alchables, skilling items and the like.
---
We'll know more with future dev blogs.
---
some over*loads*
---
Apart from raids, I’d recommend trying out vorkath and/or zalcano. Each require you to complete a quest prior (dragon slayer 2/song of the elves). Slayer is always good money especially with the release of Alchemical Hydra.
---
Just turn all barrows tabs into burnt fish and be done with it
---
10 minutes will just be to see if crashers come back. I doubt they will and then they can move it back down to 3
---
How do you farm beginner clues?
---
Well I was asking how it worked before people gave dumb responses, we don't really know. Is it a shared bank? At that point it's not REALLY giving anything away, my biggest concern is if someone stops playing, are those items just lost forever?
---
This is blatantly wrong. Shield + super pot fully protects but somehow mage protect + super pot does not. Yes its very minimal and very ovcasional but it does somehow still damages you unlike with shield.
---
1.2k dry of a unique, but before that I had 7-8 in 200 kills, so just stick with it :)

You should do a multiplicative per tile episode! Episode 1: 1 tile, Episode 2: 2 tiles, Episode 3: 4 tiles, etc.

---
Sometimes I hop to f2p worlds to get fewer available GE slots, this would be an alternative
---
you sound like the type of dude to fart in a toilet and flush
---
You are speaking about precedent for something we literally have no precedent for, are you trying to annoy me on purpose or are you just like this?
---
Why is shared bank not an assumption when we literally have precedent with that with raids? What do you think group ironman will be? If you don't share how is it group ironman? What's the point of the update otherwise?
---
I can not help you understand the point of what I'm asking any further, if you don't understand that's okay. Maybe group just means "solo progression" to you. 
---
I think you've lost the right to the word daft after your incredibly intellectual comment just now, it's the smartest thing I've ever read for sure. /s (clearly marked sarcasm in case you couldn't understand).
---
Fund a bond on an ironman within a month? Is that doable playing 2-3 hrs a day?
---
Yeah I wish there were things we could get from pvm that weren't Skilling materials. But search me if I got any idea what that could be that would pass a poll.

Gotta tell me how to do this. I was a dumbass when I was young and botted and lost my account I use for my main email. I would love to have that email back even if I have to start from scratch.
---
Crafting, range, Magic, fishing/wc, smithing if you got some GP
---
yea you're ready. just be ready to lose about 1m or more in resources just learning how to kill him too
---
Crafting.
---
That’s not a pvmer, that’s what we call a skiller. Black chins only take up 1 inv spot and uses up no resources but doing wildly bosses will use up food over time, giving the pvmer a disadvantage. It’s not a hard concept to understand
---
This makes me so happy.
---
Reminds me of the day I had enough gp to buy a mith scimmy.
---
pay for protection at a revs cc, camp that.
---
Colorado here, had horrible lag all morning
---
Do you have cash to burn?
---
Then go crafting, firemaking, cooking.
---
Otherwise combat skills at those levels should still be pretty easy to get up fast.
---
[Skilling Catalysts](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/6hb4gb/skilling_catalysts_an_idea_that_might_permanently/) are by far the best idea I've found. Instead of dropping 200 noted raw sharks, it would drop a special item that gives you double sharks the next 200 times you catch them.
---
The post I linked is more fleshed out, but that's the gist. More skilling items would still enter the economy, but you have to actually skill to process them into a useful product.
---
Yes.
---
2-3 hours a day is 14-21 hours a week. You can make a bond AND MORE in that much time every two weeks.
---
No I really don't have much gp

Nice detail in the top of the cape being strung
---
Can you read? I'm totally mentally prepared to die. I wasn't mad, no tears, I thought it was funny they spent more on spells and bolts to kill me than I had in my inventory. 
---
But if someone wants to kill me, for 3 lobsters and waste both our time then fine they can. Spite vote incoming though.
---
Exactly
---
If someone is going to be a sore loser, pull excuses and publicly use the pity card it's fair game to ridicule them... Being upset is fine, disrespecting competitors work and the integrity of the competition is not.

Rendi is a child that never learnt how to accept defeat
---
Fishing + cooking
---
omg... what is this clipped from?
---
I think if it's in reponse to rather shitty behavior it can be considered justified in some scenarios, namely this one, and I think that if the person the comment was directed at agrees then maybe you shouldn't be so offended on their behalf.
---
The meme potential from this clip may just be the best thing to come from this runefest
---
woah you're making it sound as if... the Runescape community is toxic
---
I don’t really have much to say but I’m looking forward to it, I probably won’t grind it too hard but I’m definitely going to at least try it out. In my opinion the old school team has been knocking it out of the park with their updates this past year so I’m confident that they’ll make this (as well as the other announced content) worth playing
---
I use stretched fixed mode since it's an easier way of getting used to the long drags. not a high level pvmer but a long time used of the old fixed client, and I hate resizeable.
---
Ah, I see, thought you were referring to skillcapes of other skills besides the untrimmed one.
---
uh i got em from 30 grostesque guardian kills i think, what else drops em lol
---
Have you been living under a fucking rock lol
---
Thank you! Where do you think I should power mine and do you think I should stick To iron???
---
But they also introduced raids chest that lets you keep untrims effortlessly
---
when cannoning something in a safe spot
---
and people with that mentality are a cancer to the game and should be ignored
---
check out my previous posts, my pet luck has been pretty crazy so far
---
Only runecrafting isn't allowed to be buffed. They can up xp rates on other skills
---
This isn't about if the guy was drunk or not, this is about you defending your friend when some asshole insults them without thinking about whether or not they are drunk.
---
And you're right. This is even more appropriate because Settled didn't punch Rendi, he just called the guy out for being a dick.
---
And yes, he did have a reason to jab back at Rendi. Settled is friends with Smokey and even with the context of Rendi being drunk, Rendi was entirely in the wrong because he was still being a bad sport. Settled does not need to apologize to Rendi because at no point did Settled actually passive aggressively insult Rendi's work or otherwise. He insulted Rendi's behavior, which is the key piece a lot of people seem to keep missing because they just want Rendi to be the hero in this.
---
Just because Rendi apologized for his behavior does not mean Settled is immature for not apologizing as well. In fact, there is the other possibility that Rendi may even just be apologizing solely because Settled called him out on his behavior because celebrities do that when they fuck up.
---
Not that I've ever seen
---
I have no idea what twisted leagues is
---
Odablock should have won that shit.
---
Winter 2019 release date
---
I'm gonna have to go with **X** doubt.
---
So how did you level up to nieve?
---
Yes. When you run someone off while your PKing Venenatis and the spider has 25% health left. 
---
But no, it’s just too slow.
---
Ds2 unlocks a shitty back pack, smelly gloves and some undead lizards.
---
I certainly won't freak. I loved Runespan. Turned a dogshit unbearable skill into an enjoyable time.
---
can't be nieve only if she's dead! (excuse i've been using to lay off mm2 lol)
---
ps: fuck steve
---
Ive noticed they have a 20gp gap a lot of times and seem to be in shorter supply than most runes
---
But why is it weird gatekeeping? It’s kind of ruins the point of the mode if you just never do anything that will get you killed. I get people enjoy different play styles in general but why even have a hcim if you’re not going to do anything?
---
That blowpipe won't pass the polls. I don't see pvmers having a use for it, pkers are the only ones that can really use it so it will have the same fate as pvp weapons. The other stuff seems pretty cool, but some people will complaing that they are too op, or that they are gonna be dead content.(This is why we can't have anything nice).
---
Wouldn't the government question how that guy got all that money to spend on gambling?
---
But dudes post assumed he only gets 1 per run
---
Or given security concerns just make up a brand new email dedicated to your Runescape account, use a password generator to make it long and indecipherable like csbr6ytiM4zuv72fFcYQO9bZF0KkVg @gmail.com, never share or display that email anywhere, and store it in a password manager with different but similarly long and indecipherable passwords for both the email and the Runescape account.
---
Then never worry about having to remembering usernames because they're all a copy-paste away.
---
Even then, what shows is still another name that i assume wouldn't be allowed right? Weird
---
I always thought an Agility Guild would be neat. Like a thieves playing ground
---
indeed but if we can get mos'le harmless to be like it was pre eoc for implings it will give us impling hunters an area to hunt without any bots only legit players allowed doubt any bot makers would be willing to do all those quests
---
55 Runecrafting doesn't even take long
---
They don't damage with dfs/elemental/other icy-resist shield, but they still freeze you for about 3 seconds, making you unable to attack or move. Not sure if the -60 or so ranged defense and -9 strength bonus is worth the freeze immunity
---
I will test this at Sara. The 125 weapon accuracy is the highest you can get, off the top of my head (ACB+TBuck is 118) and the method is hit and run, so consistent attacks are not critical.
---
I assume I'm too late but as nobody else responded, thank you for posting it here for others to retrieve
---
It's still an unexplained amount of wealth regardless of how small it is.
---
This is like my third ever abbies task, less than 600 kills I think, though I got my first whip at 100 kills~.
---
The RS2 Blood Fury wasn't very powerful at all. Definitely not a replacement for soul split. All I used it for was bringing a little less food on Slayer tasks. Personally, I'd like to see it brought in and am gonna vote yes. Just vote no if you don't want it to be added, i bet it will fail anyways. Imo jagex should poll to put the blood shard on the fury instead of torture though
---
the stinger for me is that my skiller pure has 2 pets and my main has 0.
---
i like how you put 0 effort into censoring his name but actually censored yours
---
i want a desert expansion but the one thing id want is something like an eternal waterskin, i know its not a huge deal but the waterskin thing makes me avoid the desert like the plague. idk just my 2 cents
---
You art style is sooo strangely attractive.
---
Quit
---
I wonder if the Relics might impact this at all. For example, they could do something crazy like changing speeds of weapons to make something unviable suddenly BiS. Or perhaps they could allow access to new drops to add in gear from elsewhere.
---
Anyway, the list looks like it covers pretty much all the gear. Though since you list 3rd Age elsewhere, may want to include it for Magic Amulet since 3rd Age Amulet is BiS.
---
Theyre not even close actually. It's not a task worth doing for exp. therefore if you can do vork, they simply arent worth doing. I'm not saying they're shit, they're decent money. There are just better alternatives.
---
Shit looks dope not gonna lie
---
And pvp players when seeing a pvm player post anything in a PvP post
---
Grats dood
---
Bruh the healing effects were voted to not be in the game, you’re presenting it as if it was scrapped for no reason.
---
## bruh 🤙🙌😂😂🤙
---
&gt;spite votimg makes complete sense
---
So you go to Mexico a few times, for some fraction of those times you get robbed by 1-2 Mexicans, it's now reasonable for you to try to harm all 130 million Mexicans.
---
You know you're all bullies and that you're doing something that causes more harm than good. All that it takes to satisfy your consciences is a bit of illogical bullshit and circlejerking.
---
Source on those?
---
Gratz dude
---
what the fuck you stole my rng cunt
---
im legit so hyped, i got bored on my hcim but now me and my buddy who quit a while ago are gonna make a sick group ironman team, we've been waiting for this for like 2 years, if you can make it a priority itd be amazing im literally more hyped for this than anything else in my life
---
As long as it increases the people in our community I’m all for it .... “laughs in Alts”
---
Agreed, I've tried to watch three of their videos now and the "skits" they act out just aren't funny to me. I could understand thinking it's the best thing in the world if that's your humor though. Link and rargh just come off as two best friends shooting the shit and that's way more enjoyable for me
---
It's good for optimal zulrah on an ironman pre-dark bow. You can get in a powerful hit right before it ducks under on the blue phases.
---
I think the main issue is that Jagex has shown they will go nuts with increasing exp rates if people just let them do whatever they want. Look at RS3 rates (not including MTX shit or extra xp rewards) half the skills in the game can reach or exceed 900k per hour.
---
Hiding behind a tree 🌼🌲
---
Please no.
---
And he shouldve been attacking a Jynx, since all the people who die in wildy complains like divas
---
settled can make exceptions if he wants. i would expect him to post-tob tbh.
---
You need to take an "efficiency" break imo. The dopamine you get from zulrah heavily outweighs anything else and you will experience it again when you step from zulrah -&gt; raids. 
---
Take a look at your life, are you doing everything you can as efficient as possible? (Minimising time done for everyday tasks, fastest showers possible, fastest time to eat a meal, fastest times to do chores etc) chances are you do things purely just to enjoy them (having long hot showers, eating food based on flavour and not how many nutrients are in it etc) and you need to treat OSRS the same. 
---
What do you actually enjoy doing in game? Is it PvM? Do you have some minigame you find fun? 
---
Whatever it is, take a break from the game and come back to the activities that you like and place restrictions upon yourself to help stay away from efficiency maximization, things like pretending to be iron man, liquidating your gear and rebuilding to be able to boss etc.
---
I used to be pretty efficiency based until I realised it sucked all enjoyment out of paying the actual game, efficiency makes you play against yourself and that's not fun at all.
---
Doesnt the herb sack only hold like 30 of one kind of herb?
---
What is it that prevents them from adding more bank space?
---
Okay you go ahead and get hustled by account sellers like OP lmao
---
The worst thing Jagex has done for skilling is to give people who fundamentally don't like to skill a strong incentive to do it. These people don't like training the skill and want it to be as fast and AFK as possible so they can get back to doing whatever the skill was gating. The best thing to do here is to remove arbitrary skill requirements from Diaries and to make the Max Cape cosmetic only. You wouldn't have any incentive to Runecraft unless you enjoyed the skill or were going for hiscores. 
---
Unless you pay for runners, which are extremely expensive and may not even be in supply when more like 2-3 people start going for 200m RC, you're getting 75k/h solo. If someone got 200m RC from those rates, it'd take them about 2600 hours. Increasing that rate to be in line with slow-but-faster-than-RC skills like Mining or Fishing would cost that person 1000 hours. Devastating blow to somebody competing for 200m all. It's equivalent to making it very achievable to max your account in a few months for new players when it takes most people who have already done it over a year. 
---
Skilling xp rates, by definition, have a much greater effect on people competing for hiscores as they do the skill for ~15x as much xp as the average player. Why should we gut a skill for the players who actually enjoy it and do it the most to make it faster and more painless for the casual player who feels "forced" to train it, when you can just not force you to train it? 
---
We should gate these diary rewards behind the pvm diaries that Ash was talking about, as most of the rewards are pvm anyway, and the max cape is overpowered as it is.
---
&gt;because if you don't have herb sack you have to keep banking.
---
That's the point. It's meant to be a reward for spending slayer points
---
They were dead before the updates. Yew and magic logs are the same price as release.
---
There are definitely many gems. Check out Jillyfish to start, does guideless questing and gameplay, no hints or spoilers allowed in the chat. She is def big brain and it's fun watching her figure this stuff out on her own. You can either google the answer and watch as she struggles or try to beat her to the answer yourself without any guide. 
---
That's just one to start.
---
Honestly, what kind of spaghetti code do they have, where 1000 is TOO BIG of a number? I understand that each bank slot probably has more than 1 thing associated with it, but I still fail to see how it breaks some kind of a limit, especially knowing that the usual limit is 2.147 bil for this engine.
---
Are they running out of storage space to save all of the items that people have banked? That doesn't seam plausible.
---
You are thinking of slayermusiq1, but he never completes series like that, his main focus is quest guides
---
it's a mentality state.
---
there is no longer a mystery to the game, everything more is less is known and quantified in relative real time (exp counters/ability to liquidate via GE) which has spurred development to be better than previous options in a way that is unquestionable so that newer content is interacted with. instead of being "an alternative" option. as if we simply just have variations on alternatives instead of direct betters you narrow the prospective userbase to those that are comfortable at that point, instead of those chasing spectacle and new and shiny things. 
---
see Rargh's latest lost in 2005 video, he goes over various methods of mining gold and all come out mostly equivalent which is great though compared with the game today there are just straight out superior ways to get gold.
---
this has an effect on the user as it is clearly laid out, in most cases judging by GP/XP gained, that what they're doing comes at the perceived greatest cost (time) when the task they're doing in and of itself is not enjoyable (progressing in a game). this is where discipline and self-limitations come into play so long as they're enjoyable to the user, see Rargh lost in 2005 for example or anyone else playing with specific limitations.
---
in the end, if your goal is progress to specific end (max), do what is most efficient given the time. if there is a way to progress the game while being bound to certain limitations that you think you might enjoy for your own reasons, try them out - discover for yourself.
---
Skilling shouldn't make as much money as bossing or doing something click intensive like the blast furnace. Catching sharks is only 70k per hour, though. Back in the day that was much more profitable, and I'd like to see that again.
---
This just gives account sellers more means to do shady shit. Come on man use your head.
---
I thought MEP 2 was much more frustrating.  The platform puzzle in MM2 isn't that bad once you realize where the safespots are.  Trying to make the jump in the light puzzle tho... o.o fucking hell
---
DS2 was much more difficult than SOTE i believe.  The only difficult part in SOTE is managing supplies and maximizing damage during Seren.  The rest is fairly easy though
---
Interesting. I seem to recall magic logs being worth 2-3k back in 2007, but we didn't have quite as many high level players either.
---
oh god please no this was the worst questline I've done in rs3
---
I like turtles.
---
I vote Manchester tbh
---
He is free to make exceptions. Especially since the content being locked is huge
---
I think about this daily
---
This honestly, I have far more KC at GG than any other boss solely because I want Noon.
---
Wah
---
I'm sure they could add a feature where if the group/clan leader doesn't log in for X days then the clan can start a vote to promote someone else to take over.
---
Lv 1
---
No it wasn't slayermusic the guy was British maybe younger
---
He will do it after ToB as a season finale to keep the account pure for his ToB run.  It'll probably be a breeze because he expects to be maxed by then
---
No unfortunately not slayer musiq
---
Tried yesterday when I was pking pvmers. Ballista doesn’t hit often and it’s hella slow
---
That’s a hacked account that was turned into a bot lol.
---
Agility pet at 36 in Varrock. 
---
Never had such good rng after
---
It’s a meme bruh
---
I’m sick of them, 1 prim would mean I can buy rigour. Pls don’t let me go as dry as mammal.
---
And got my prim next trip yes boys
---
Nice circle jerk ;)
---
Looks like the agility guild to me
---
Rocket League
---
They explained it in that post, open spoiler posts
---
Every time I see Kraken pet mentioned, it reminds me of my insane luck with Kraken.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I got pet at 431 KC. In the prior 430 KC, I got I believe it was 4 tentacles and 2 full tridents. Pet is 1/3k, tents are 1/400 and tridents at 1/512.
---
Aside from it just being boring, I refuse to do Kraken because of the low KC with such insane luck.
---
good
---
Yeah all of my friends Stick to playing Sims theme park
---
They don't.
---
Apps actually do this all the time. Unfortunately so many do it and take it down that it's hard to enforce and catch them in the act.
---
50k ? 250k?? 1'5m hahahag
---
lyre teleporting you to neitiznot/jatizso is pretty useful for clues/troll tasks, and neitiznot teleport is one of the closest to a bank
---
The rules are the way they are to allow flexibility in case by case scenarios. If they've decided what you did was bannable, that is all.
---
Dont bot
---
Everyone's looking to buy and very few are looking to sell.
---
Stay strong brother you’re not alone. I have 1 crystal which I just got at 1077 kc a pegasian.
---
It’s not out YET they just announce it though.
---
Its funny seeing paid video ads for private servers on Youtube.
---
Not bad. I want that head.
---
I got 5 sires in 198kc and got
---
- full bludgie
---
- jar
---
- dagger
---
What's real excruciating is the boss
---
PTSD from the 3rd one they released in Runescape.
---
Wont happen.
---
Regardless would be kinda cool.
---
Exactly if he didn’t squeal like a little girl over ANSOLUTELY everything it would be more popular I feel.
---
I'd like to hear why...care to explain?
---
I bet you feel like a fool now
---
X
---
It looks like you got a free trip back to lumbridge goblin boy
---
???
---
elaborate please for my 1 iq
---
No you dumb bitch. He's acting grateful now to get more gp from you later. You fell for it goblin boy. He already has your entire bank.
---
In a world where bronze armor exists (bronze t helm to get rid of the purple plume), why would you try using this? Lol
---
Low HP rushing accounts arent that great. With the new spec tele cooldown you just simply spec them back and they die
---
You might be joking but they're expensive bc of slaughter brace
---
Yeah it's certainly understandable, the dry streaks can be rough. Meanwhile at Vork you can go thousands of kills without a rare and it doesn't matter since they're not responsible for the gp/hr.
---
Definitely is way overstated that they "keep the economy standing", but they do keep niche things being decently priced.  Like look at the new granite handle which essentially bumped a gmaul up to 500k and added a drop as opposed to not having a good drop from GG.
---
If you want a safe wilderness then go to rs3. Otherwise enjoy a free trip to lumbridge you cabbage pvm wannabes
---
I only ever got 1 unsired which ended up being a bludgeon piece in 260KC...  
---
You getting 5 unsired in 580KC is very impressive. I am envious of you.
---
I failed to see what's so impressive about sliding.
---
its faked when the account they are staking against is just an alt, they end up with the money irregardless of if they win or not. if the lose and it goes to the other account, they RWT if they win great! they give back the loan money keep the winnings and go do it again
---
this happened with comisson stakes as modmatk pointed out in the comments above you
---
Death mechanics turned people soft cant handle dieing in a dangerous zone anymore. Makes you wonder the people who complain if they are from mobile and never played the game as it was before.
---
Adam talks about pride whenever I claim my btw armor from him in Lumbridge though 🤔
---
WHAT??????????
---
Quest Guide on wiki recommends 60 lol. Honestly not the same experience if you're overleveled for it. I did it last week and had 50 + 53 thieving and honestly wasn't as epic as when I did it back into he day... Finished the whole thing only eating like 2 food
---
I remember me and my friends doing it when it not long after it first came out. We were so like 60combat and 40 ago or so.. but attaining 50 ago seemed like a feat that would take forever. It took me maybe 4-5 trips to get through and in the main cavern I spent ages world hopping to pick up a food respawn lmao
---
Can we reset regular ironmen to get hardcore status back?
---
I got heron pet on 2 alts fishing minnows which is around 1/900k and i did it twice lol
---
Esports is pvp, if you want the game to grow you should want solid pvp to market and grow the game.
---
This type of content is why i sub to  r/2007scape
---
Who said anything about addiction?
---
When wolf disappeared, I thought they were gonna go through all the recent exits, give em a line or two, and have them vanish. Would have been hilarious.
---
not even bis-kitchens smh
---
No one's to blame except for the game mechanics. They're not conducive to a healthy PvP scene.
---
The only sub-genre of competitive gaming that exists with heavy RNG systems are card games.
---
PvP'ers don't recognize this fact as to why their emergent-community-scene that is inherently reliant on *other* people continually being active, despite the low skill ceiling and heavy RNG elements, is the reason why PvP is dying - and are simply lashing out and looking for "the great other" to blame.
---
Additions specifically catered towards the PvP scene is treating the symptoms of the limitations of the game, and they add variety for sure, but they will never treat the problem.
---
Someone done wine's to 99 in 1 Xp drop, I'll find the video/picture.
---
&gt; With a High Alch value of 6k I'm tempted to just high alch them all.
---
You can't high alch them.
---
A fellow windows 8.1 user i see.
---
Shouldn't it be GIM? Why the extra P?
---
Bro, you collect the dramen branch on entrana and knives are alllowed there
---
indeed, see the third paragraph. The issue is when people don't understand that content in the wilderness is designed with the fact that you can be attacked and killed by other players at any time, while doing anything. It's disheartening to see such a toxicity-infused divide between the two communities over a simple disconnect in perception of what the Wilderness fundamentally is.
---
bro 😎💪
---
You can just Google osrs crystal shards, it'll show you all of its uses.
---
Looks like Dark Souls had a baby with RuneScape, love it
---
Gz m8
---
Do you think you are cool or something?
---
before 92 ranged its not worth it
---
melee/mage styles are only really used because they take up less space if you already use the range, they not that amazing. 
---
also its less worth it if you cant get elite void too
---
How about actually keeping it old school?
---
Imagine paying for something you can get for free playing passively
---
85kc and 90 slayer.
---
Get out!
---
Gz bro &lt;3
---
Why? I've got all the time in the world to max this account I'm not in a rush I'm enjoying the grind
---
There's always a bigger fish
---
Where is the majority of that 406m total coming from?
---
You get water runes instead
---
nae nae time
---
i dont even understand why this is all an issue. ive been pk'd doing shit in the wild, literally doesnt matter unless youre some brainlet bringing your mortgage and life savings with you for some obtuse reason.
---
Kraken at 57 kc and vissy after like 10kc skeletal wyvern!
---
Sneaky jagex :(
---
Wont work. Anything involving catching more sharks would just crash their price to make up for it.
---
We need to increase demand for them.
---
Alright so, to effectively kill Zulrah for the first few dozen times do this:
---
\- bring as few switches as possible (I suggest a dhide top, bottom and blowpipe switch) - definitely buy Ahrims, if you have money, buy a ring of suffering aswell, makes it much easier
---
\- definitely buy a toxic trident and blowpipe, without them it'll be hell
---
\- remember the colors of different Zulrah spawns and pray accordingly. Eventually you'll learn there's times when you need to move around. The Jad phase will probably be the trickiest. Switch prayers when the current attack is halfway from Zulrah to you. Be prepared to lose some money learning Zulrah. Took me around 15 attempts for my first kill and I was frequently dying until about 50 KC in. 
---
\- you are definitely ready to try out Zulrah. I did it with 80 magic and 75 ranged + 60 def
---
Good luck on your endeavour.
---
Lol that second item is OP as hell
---
on the other hand, the current status quo means there is greater reward for the people willing to risk doing them (see 3rd paragraph of update post)
---
Nice
---
Im not very good with balancing :p but u get the idea
---
Ah, good old Saliva
---
Gonna be a while till I got the herblore lvl, but good shout just saving them up. Cheers!
---
What doenst make sense about noted drops they can use banks to. You humans think your so high and mighty denying the beasts from using your banks.
---
I was about to say “how do you know it’s Peterborough” but then I saw the phone number. P town represent!
---
This was Mod West's first iteration of ToB armour before they knew what it would be like. They later updated Mage Arena 2 and changed Justiciar to what the Saradomin general wears to make it part of the God Wars lore.
---
Plank Make (Lunar's) with Mahogany logs. 
---
One click to do a full inv and easily afk'able whilst making a profit. Nice alternative for mage xp.
---
The Ely is powerful too. Thats a rare drop from a group boss. Know what i mean?
---
"Wasn't mad"

"Spite vote"

Sailor looks like Mike Nolan. Fuckn' ripper cunt
---
Na not really, go read the other threads.
---
I built a rig less than 2 years ago. Soon after that i got back into osrs as my main game. My screen is 3440x1440 so i can fit like 15 alts and a video at the same time lol. Having static 50 fps in a war with like 300 people on screen with overheads and attack animations etc. is actually fucking amazing. 
---
That being said if i didnt use the rig for other things, it would be overkill for osrs.. unless i spun up some VMs and started a bot farm Cx. Cba with today's ban rates though haha.
---
Spending a full 6 hour log in nmz and got 0 xo lol
---
Forgot I had auto retaliate off from doing fight caves on my alt and minimised it in corner of screen so could only see inventory and health to overload and absorption after it 6 hr logged out I went to reset it and checked the xp gained and it was 0.
---
I'm a bit of a dumbass haha
---
I think it's time for the rs3 players to join the osrs players
---
Vampyric blessing is dumb op too. Why would you buff damage by another 10% in ToB
---
Skipped the middle man and went straight into slots!! Mtx are a thing of the past.
---
all the beams are level. Meaning a good foundation for whatever they are building.
---
13k for elementals 10k for other runes I believe?
---
Staking
---
Whilst this weapon is pretty neat, the Ivandis Flail is one of the most unique weapons in the game. 
---
RS3 replacing it with generic wooden weapons was a big mistake. Keep to the same weapon, just alter it slightly if you must.
---
He might have had some "get your shit together" time
---
Him leaving was also very public, so maybe some other companies caught wind of it &amp; contacted him.
---
Maybe he expected to get fired &amp; started searching beforehand
---
Do you really think all these jmods would leave right before runefest? what's the point of that
---
I miss the hunt for red raktuber
---
Came here to say this. I still play games nonstop but Runescape just wasn't worth it. I wasted hours and hours and hours and hours doing what people let bots do.
---
I have never heard of anyone being forced to change their name, despite some clear provocations.
---
As for it being offensive, I rather think that depends on what other words are in there. Names like "God hates the gays" I would find offensive, while "Gay Dude 69" is fine. Given that you're open about your sexuality, you probably fall into the latter category, which I see no problem with.
---
It’s not the sliding, it’s how perfectly level all the joists are.  Very difficult to do sometimes.
---
There has to be a separation between eSports and spectacle in this conversation, as to put OSRS's PvP system objectively against popular examples (Excluding card games as mentioned), OSRS fails for fair and balanced game-play.
---
Sure, OSRS can be made into a spectacle for the purpose of vicarious viewing through things like DMM (Which include the game as a whole, not just PvP) but i cannot ever see competitive PvP taking off as a eSport. It is objectively flawed in that instance.
---
This leads to possible iterations on spectacle for viewership (That is, DMM seasons) and as we've seen they're limited in scope while being based on the main game and have effectively been canceled, pending review. If the iterations of the most basic aspects of the base game (Open world PvP, with the goal to level stats and gather resources) has run its course, i don't see a more complex system taking it's place.
---
why the fuck would anyone host anything big in farnborough

Good bot
---
They do not ban over mousejumps anymore. They changed that rule when mobile came out...
---
Else u would get banned from playing on tablets/phones.
---
Usually there is more to it, just stream and smack the video evidence on their Twitter.
---
I'm not even most impressed by the full guthans, I'm mostly impressed by the sheer number of items you got that fast.
---
i think the problem is people don't realize this happens, they don't see the reason why the they are getting killed when they aren't wearing anything and say they don't have any loot is that the pker is hoping for the extremely slim but extremely real chance that they accidentally brought their cash stack with them, and since they aren't geared it costs nothing to kill them
---
Gonna need about 1000 shards for 85-99 mining at mlm.

Lol what a nolifer

Its time to stock up on briefcases.

With these OP builds, you'll die before you can retaliate.

It's not dumb. Its a suggestion. Why do you have to be horrible?
---
Have you tried playing the minigame on total worlds? 1250/1500 total is not a huge project, even on a btw.
---
Thinking that a game who is owned and passed around to investment companies can hold true to the core aspects that it was built on.
---
its BIS at vorkath offtask. (I think ontask melee is better since lance)
---
Its really usefull for raids 2. Its not best but in the beginning you need food to get it done.
---
This is incredible chocobo, the animation in your series hits that sweet nostalgic G spot, keep up the great work
---
Why aren't they banned then.
---
when a bull poops, what is its byproduct?

1000 wouldn't get you very far.

Just did that yesterday, Is that a boss you can kill again or just for the quest?
---
Ahh yes but content creators do!! You think jagex thinks about the average player..
---
I farmed a couple thousand Zulrah on release, and back then tele scrolls dropped in stacks of 20 (or 25? Don't recall). Well I ended up taking a break from osrs, and when I returned after a few months, the scrolls went from 200gp -&gt; 5-6k a pop. I took the opportunity and sold them all, just to find a couple months later they're 20k ea. I missed out on ~100m. Sad time.
---
Brings me back to my 2006 days when I used to buy bones from players there for 2gp each

You are in the wilderness bud. You aren't owed free fucking agility xp lmao I don't understand people like you. Go run gnome stronghold course instead

I just wanted a dragon pickaxe tbh. That was my goal at the time. Chaos elemental seemed to be the way to go about it at the time.

Just buy every mithril thing and it will be worth more

Awesome man! I'm thinking of buying one of those soon! How is it?

I’m pretty sure it’s so you CANT use herb sack. Herb sack takes up 1 inventory space for all your herb. The reason they drop noted is to lessen your inventory space and force a choice - you want that herb or you want 1 additional food slot and extending your trip?

Wait... I need to look at the wiki now. I know how to train my RC!!!!
---
its good on void pure that means prayer defence and either one of atk or str stay at bracket range (my suggestion is str to tech on atk tier up to 99 so u can keep scaling that stack), after that its free slot pieces kept on daeth
---
rushing a prayer stack kit if u can be fucked getting elite is a real nice startup too and scales(techs) fucking hard for the stat tier break...
---
Nope, thats just a zero level episode followed by a 2 level episode. /u/killoah if you ever do herblore I'm unsubscribing. 1 level per episode means 1 level per episode.
---
Do baby blacks it’s a really short task.
---
Gotta play those lines baby.
---
You do realized you could easily bypass it by making random.dat readonly, right? 
---
No matter what they do, it will be bypassed easily. It will really only hurt the real players.
---
Well I am an advocate for letting people play how they want and that’s fine. Chaos Ele has bass 70 defensive stats across the board. Since you’re flinching and you’ll want a weapon that has high stats without regards to attack speed. Something like a dragon battleaxe comes to mind considering how far you are in your account. Another option would be a barrows weapon if you wanted to grind that out.

Hive! Bring a sword.

Well i kinda think thats part of being an ironman account *shrug*. If you don't earn it on that account you cant give it to that account. Other cosmetics exist in game that don't allow you to transfer em.
---
Wouldn't that just be an adjustment rather than a buff since it doesn't gain more storage?
---
Welcome to the main game.
---
It's not nearly as bad for Jagex as it is for them. Worst-case scenario, RS3 becomes unsustainable due to the forced MTX and and lack of subscriptions, so they get a barebones team after the inevitable sale of the company. 
---
The only way it could truly damage OSRS is if the buyer expects the inflated profits to continue, forcing Jagex to add surprise mechanics to this version of the game through increasingly-sneaky methods.
---
They'd never pass a poll, of couse... that's what "integrity changes" are for, after all.
---
Hope you get it sorted mate!

Keep in mind that HaveIBeenPwned only tells you about **known** breaches. Have you used this password in other places?
---
As much as I agree that this looks sweet, i'm pretty sure i've heard Ash say that the engine doesn't deal well with 'flail' style weapons as it can't render the animation well across more than one tile, that thing is monstrous and I'd expect it to need a second tile to do its animation justice. Would love to see it implemented if it didn't look bugged
---
The armor is dark justicar?
---
Nothing. Herb sack is useless if you only pick ranarrs,torstol,snapdragons. The last 2 herbs are especially rarer
---
Here's a more afk way to train construction. Train construction normally, but for every minute you spend training, afk for the next 3 or 4 mins.
---
Now you're getting the 100k Xp/hr you dreamed of and afking for up to 3 of 4 mins at a time
---
Pheonix on 18kc. Currently at 327 kc and haven't had a single piece of pyromancer gear drop though hehe xd
---
It sounds really dumb because it is. Basically some people stream nothing except 50/50 stakes at the duel arena and guilt their viewers into giving them money for fuelling their gambling addictions.
---
Like in real life, stakers somehow expect to earn back the money to pay their debts by continuing to gamble, which naturally leads to ever higher debts which viewers inexplicably continue to fund.
---
Summary: Lenders are viewers who enjoy watching people stake for some reason. It's as strange to me as staking itself.
---
Staking debts are what stakers owe to lenders. Most debts are unlikely to be paid off since staking is a net loss in the long run (or even short run, much of the time).
---
Staking is dumb, lending to a staker is even dumber.
---
I'm so pissed they don't sell them for the s7 edge
---
You hoard it for a week and then sell everything aswell?
---
Sure u did bro
---
WHAT
---
I'm with you. I'll play it if I can play my ironman at same time and get cosmetics on that account.
---
While you absolutely can kill Zulrah with those stats, it would be far more efficient to train mage a few levels before camping Zulrah.  
---
  
---
For fast kills &amp; multiple kills per trip, you'll want an imbued heart asap. If you can get your mage in range of Vengeance, this will help reflect some damage back and hit much harder with mage. 86 is the minimum for this, but preserve would keep it there for only 90 secs every 7 mins. At 90 mage, the heart boosts by an extra level (10), so that might be a good goal. Imbued heart (ignoring veng) boosts dmg by about the same as an occult necklace.  
---
Suffering is an awesome item for learning, but is a luxury item: it provides no additional dps, just saves you having to reequip ring of recoils. Similarly, serpentine helm is good for learners as you don't need to use anti-venom+s with it, but actually lowers dps.  
---
I would say to not bother attempting Zulrah for good gp/hr without at least the blowpipe, trident of the swamp, and ahrims.  
---
Upgrading mage matters more than range at Zulrah. You'll want to buy Augury / Arcane Prayer Scroll (4.5m) if you have / can get 77 prayer. Then an imbued heart, followed by tormented bracelet. After these, an anguish would be good. Finally, mage arena 2 cape coupled with an ancestral hat should provide an extra max hit. The cape is great to get sooner for the +5 mage and sometimes an extra max hit, if you can. Then you might upgrade from a tome of fire (+8 mage) for say a mage's book (+15), as well as upgrading brimstone boots (+3 mage/+5 range) into eternal boots (+8 mage). 
---
If you make all of those upgrades, then you can consider rigour, Sanguinesti staff, ancestral top/bottom, arcane spirit shield, armadyl, pegasians, etc.  
---
   
---
Sang staff isn't always more profit per hour at Zulrah due to it costing about an extra 300k/hr.   
---
Dark bow with dragon arrows are also good for last hits of mage phases, where you get an extra blowpipe hit of damage by swapping to dark bow for the last hit.  
---
Good luck! If I were you, I'd burst Dust Devils, Nechs, or monkey madness burst locations to get about 90 mage before camping zulrah. It should be more of an upgrade to dps than owning most BiS at your levels, and will be far cheaper. Of course, you can get a few kills to try out the boss for now.
---
A monster will kill an adventurer and pick up their noted drops, there, makes sense
---
Not really, you've just assumed access to infinite resources. But if you literally just started an account with the intention of maxing, you obviously don't have 2B GP. The relative value of GP is way higher earlier in a fresh accounts life, so actually using either smithing, RC, or hunter for GP (instead of goldsmithing, paying lava runners, or bird box runs respectively) is a very efficient use of your time. You can then use the gold you earned to feed other skills at their most efficient exp rates.

You're right in that multiple series' of games played out over time mitigate RNG, example Poker. But where OSRS shows it's hand in lacking the fundamental basics for fair play, is that each "hit" in a 1v1 PvP fight is a random variable and the deciding hit is also random.
---
In RTS there's variance in map pool with fixed maps for competitive play, but the deciding play is down to skill and strategy and almost never RNG.
---
In FPS there isn't variance in map layout, and once again the deciding play comes down to skill and strategy.
---
Is OSRS, there could be a statistically better PvP'er who loses the deciding round (Assuming a series is played) to an opening fullstack thanks to RNG. Or the entire fight could lean heavily towards one player in the deciding fight within a series (To the point that anyone with common sense can say it was luck). This is down almost entirely to how each "hit", again, is an RNG variable. 
---
Sure, in a competitive scene you're most likely to have relatively equaled players - but as the scene, or esport, continues the viewing audience will be subject to more and more instances of fights that are decided by RNG. And seeing as esports is more-so about viewership than what is being played, especially in the context of this thread, perception is everything. Continually being subject to RNG wins, i think personally - will deter viewers. It's a big reason (Not the only) why i think DMM failed/steadily declined/was canceled. It's also why i think the spectacle approach is better, albeit limited, for OSRS when it comes to pulling an audience for the purpose of marketing the game.
---
You’re not forced to do any task when you have points to skip. That was my entire point. If you can afford to skip for good tasks, konar is better for gp.
---
Someone copy paste the old sote Elena face on to this
---
Oh OSRS community, please never change.

Whoa I have the same birthday as settled!

oof i know this mew xx
---
Damn you're so lucky, judging by how non-existent jamrex support is i expected them to deny existence of your account at all lol
---
My entire point was if you have the points to skip the shit tasks konar is perfectly fine. And it’s not an incorrect point to make. Efficient slayer is always better. But a small handful of people actually do efficient slayer. Therefore gain more points than they can spend. You might as well use the extra points for konar unless you want them for targeting task only bosses which is also very good to have points for.
---
How did I not know of this masterpiece.

I got some serious FOMO when WoW Classic launched but I stayed away from it and now I'm just happy that it is such a big success and people are enjoying it. I don't miss it at all.

Current relics alone yeah. But they only showed the 3 of the first tier out of the progressively increasing like 8 tiers
---
I had one on my iron until song of the elves. But I just cant manage enough dps to take out that last boss before I run out of brews. I'm like 4 slayer levels off of getting trident so maybe I'll try again after that.

You’re toxic and bad at the game, clearly. On average yes duradel is better it’s not even close. Assume infinite points and it’s instantly not the case. You’re brain dead and not worth talking if you don’t understand that.

What if it's just a quicker way to the abyss for people who are over 70 or 80 rc what would be inside it?

They're both free to try, so try both.
---
As an Ironmanner and will be Group Ironmanner I like this idea personally. I think it'd be a little hard to start implementing restrictions like group with only 4 members can only add an additional 1 person when doing raids, and a 3 man group can only add 2 for all the different "group" activities in the game. but i like the idea if your a full group of 5 you're locked from doing anything in groups to just your group.

"You show Jethick the picture of your favourite anime character"

Osrs is better in my opinion (I've always liked rs over wow though) but classic wow is less of a time commitment and can be played alittle more casually compared to osrs

I believe Salve + Faceguard is actually better than Slay helm + torture for vork

True, might be they do nothing about it. I would just like to know the official stand on the subject. Even if they cant detect it, I wouldnt like using it if its against the rules. Imo its not much better excuse than botting being ok because this bot cant be detected. But I guess we will see what happens! If anything.
---
Hey yo Mr white
---
Basically the game has been continually updated since 1999 or whatever. Current rs is just the game, as it has been updated for 2 decades. We call it rs3. One of those updates in 2012 was really big (and bad, many would argue) so in 2013 they released a separate set of servers with old school runescape, based on a backup from 2007. So basically exact same situation as wow/classic except that instead of going back to vanilla (whatever that would even mean for us) we went back to 2007.

If you're planning on unlocking everything in MLM in one go:

1. Sell your prospector outfit

2. Unlock the upper floor

3. Unlock bigger sack

4. Buy coal bag

5. Buy prospector outfit back

I feel like this is the most efficient way to do it, if you want the most xp for doing MLM. I haven't done any calculations, though, so feel free to correct me IF you have proof.

Lost city already requires killing a 100ish cmb leveled tree spirit. Are you concerned about the 2k att xp and 1k mage xp reward? If they want to stay lvl 3 cmb, then it's their choice to restrict themselves from fairy rings (and would be puro puro too, now). It'd probably only get you like 10 cmb or something.  
---
2k def xp from nature spirit would prevent some players from doing puro puro, you're right. Yes they choose to restruct themselves, but I'd prefer to have the 2k xp removed as a quest reward. Then 1 def pures would be allowed to use fairy rings (though they'd still need higher than 1 pray).
---
Then why are you here complaining lol. You can still be mad about something and not have a freak attack. It’s called getting irked and triggered
---
You can’t boost for a cerb task but you can boost on a hellhound task to kill him
---
Short version:  osrs started off in March 2013as a back up of rs in ~August 2007.  Ever since, players have voted (majority of updates are polled) mostly new content and a decent amount of recycled content (from the main game).
---
The newspost explains that is not how it works. People start earning tiered rewards at a certain early point mark, and then the top EIGHTY percent start earning further stuff. Then top sixty, then fourty, etc.
---
Not everyone will squeeze into the "dragon" 1% tier, but we won't need to :)

'Shared bank' and 'being able to leave to join another group/being kicked and having to join another group' are fairly mutually exclusive so it's basically out of the question.

I can either play the game for roughly ~£1.5/h on an account I wouldn't otherwise play on or I can work for 4 hours and get a years membership. I much prefer progressing my account than saving £1.15 a week.

False. The IRS generally doesnt pay attention to sums under 10k. People losing $500-5,000 here and there is not out of the ordinary for a tourist on vacation or amateur gambler to lose, absolutely nobody would bat an eye.

just do one run with prayer potions and super combats, one full run should get you enough points for the overloads and absorptions for next runs

Mod Weath pretty definitively said it was again the rules... in a reply on Twitter. https://twitter.com/JagexWeath/status/1179467838765109248?s=09

I'm expecting them to publicly clarify which plugins are against the rules before they start issuing bans (if this stuff is even detectable), but in the meantime I've disabled my menu entry swapper plugin.
---
I don't mean to BSG too much, but why not use a gilded altar instead? You'd get 3.5x the xp for the same amount of bones you have(had)
---
No, osrs doesnt need an amulet of souls
---
I had a quest cape, I just haven't done the new quest yet. Kinda taken a break from runescape.
---
If it was for the fury maybe depending on the stats. Since its for the torture, most likely no.
---
I played way more rs when I was in high school. Like unhealthy gameplay time
---
not if you're close to 98 anyway.
---
I would highly suggest saving them. I just made 36m off 1.8k shards turning them into Divine super combats last week. The crystal key is a waste, along with saeldor and pretty much any other use besides potions.
---
isn it an attatchment for torture?
---
Ss +blood fury = never needing food
---
They can't ever do this
---
It would lead to widespread account sharing with relative strangers, both creating a fiasco for Jagex' already bad account recovery system and a loss of their income. RS isn't the kind of game where you have classes and want to make a character for each anyway.

Serp helm was great on my iron but u have access to antivenoms :p serp has -mage/range but good range defence so tanking mage phase might be easier, you decide cuz its viable, but so are other alternatives such as void ancestral coifs etc
---
Actually yes. While i see the problem of "devaluing sgs and guthans for slay" the shard may help newbies learning to pvm. i could see myself get a kill more at bandos or zamy gwd because of that effect. and i am one who manages 1-2kills/trip solo since my connection isnt stable enough for flicking.
---
And since this shard will only work on melee it wont break the "best moneymakers" like vorkath, zulrah or hydra.
---
all in all i hope they add it to fury and not the tort since fury could need some love. tort is already bis for melee...
---
It's the closest thing you have to an item drop overlay if you play on mobile with the chat open. If you don't set it low(1gp) you can sometimes miss untradeables such as totem pieces and shards etc.
---
It's kind of mind-blowing that the fact Britain is dramatically safer than America is seen as a joke by Americans
---
Can't Click here to read about the different ones. Looking forward to the Clan System &amp; Group Ironman

If you wanted the pet you shouldn't have fly fished ;x

3 zenytes in under 200 kc

I think there is a lot of logic behind it. It keeps parts of the game more accessible to players who are trying to move from being high level to true endgame content. If the pre-reqs to participate in endgame content are all locked behind ridiculous prices because of how hard they are to get, this will discourage a lot of players. Especially when you really need to play that endgame content in order to come up with the cash to participate in endgame content.
---
Wasnt runespan basically the "guild"?
---
If the effect mirrors RS3's version, the attachment will allow the Torture to deal 2-5 damage every 15 seconds and heal the wearer by the same amount of HP.
---
Cant get dhl as you have no access to zammy spear
---
took one look at ur bank and im seeing kids beg in the title all i need to know and checks out
---
Check his profile for more pictures
---
Happy birthday you dirty swamp lizard 🦎
---
Q4 2020 or early 2021
---
I dunno why it comes from tob but Justiciar Zachariah is a Mage Arena 2 boss and was one of Saradomin's generals and he wears the same armour. So it could be like some Saradominist's challenged the Theatre and died there or just died when in Morytania in general so they have a stockpile.
---
Make sure to do your crystal trees, if you aren't already! Easy shards
---
I used to do this too, there's always mods in that cc so it's basically asking for a mute. I really hated Mod Mark as I considered him in large part responsible for eoc. I don't feel that way anymore though, I realize now he's actually one of the more passionate runescape mods and always brings a lot of energy to runefest. He's a good dude and loves the game and even if eoc may have been his fault in part, I don't think he ever had any ill intentions.
---
Free 2 play.
---
Just watching that dude made me tense up, he really nailed his role
---
Its just a misdemoner.
---
Nothing for willow?
---
I've been opening the crystal chest, but it isn't as good of profit as divine super combats
---
I need everybody at home to follow these precise instructions
---
I personally like the farm guild one, but if not that one then probably brimhaven.
---
When you say mega firecape, don’t you just mean the infernal? 
---
But yeah 1 death league would be interesting
---
Agreed. There’s no point in even releasing the game mode if there is no shared bank system.
---
I just did it yesterday with 58 and constantly summer pie boosting and fell 4 times just trying to get to the 3rd demon for the amulet, quest is a frustrating rng fest for no reason. Not looking forward to regicide
---
Hoping she can sock it to me one more time
---
In defense of the original flail, I loved the lore and design behind it. It looks like a weapon borne of desperation created by sticking random bits of shit together. It was created out of a need- the need to create a weapon so unwieldy and unpredictable that it would trick the mind-reading capabilities of the vampires. Something like that is badass.
---
It should be able to handle 2 people using it at once in the same way the two people trying to pick up the same item on the floor is handled. Whoever has the better ping wins out.
---
I thought that was the bludgeon.
---
Love this
---
I know there's a lot of content that it would suck if pures had to miss out on it, but who tf cares if a non-ironman pure can't do puro-puro? Is there some kind of weird meta that this would actually mess with?
---
No.
---
i think that this could have potential but i dont think it should be a full set of armor. just the helmets and weapons. 
---
putting out a full set of armor that's just better than everything creates market shock, and there'd be a lot of issues finding a place for it. does it replace bandos if it includes legs and torso? does it replace the new jaw helm? 
---
the only way to put in even the helms would be to make them worse str than the current helms but with the HP bonus
---
Nah nah I didn’t know they changed the way it worked. I got 99 this way. Googled it and saw they made it go from 6 to 20 mins. I suppose he could still do this while afk when doing random shit and he’s not actually playing, also while at work / school so it’s still a free 99 afk, just more work.
---
That's pretty slick, nice
---
When it gets released, just wait for jagex to announce its release. It was literally just announced into existence so you cant really expect it to be there the next week or day after being announced in general. Takes alot of time to do what they do
---
Fine, fewer demons
---
Got the clue on first box. Dropped it temporarily in case I got another, but did not.
---
No
---
Yeah I remember waking up super early for grinding. Grinding in any computer class. Skipping class to grind. 
---
Good times
---
That is a crazy amount of healing. I would definitely vote no if it's that strong
---
😎🖕
---
I think only the shards are stackable, not the essence. Can't be certain though
---
Yes, I feel like the Fury is a perfect choice for this, since it is more of a piece of tank gear these days. What better to take advantage of a passive healing effect, but a piece of tank gear?
---
What the other guy said. Instead of improving the BIS you add some variety. Pick better stats or some healing? We need more options rather than pure BIS items
---
Only if the combat exp was shared as well. Otherwise this is just an easy way for skillers to afk to 99 slayer with no risk.
---
Why isn't he allowed to join that user's clan channel?
---
by that logic note every herb drop in the game and delete the herb sack
---
My birthday was yesterday, almost shared birthday with swampman :(
---
I mean if you run without prims and avernic in melee then you should compare no ward and no pegs on ranged. It just makes sense in comparison.
---
With blessed d'hide boots and anti-drag shield the cost of Vorkath goes down to only the price of the DHCB.
---
Didn't ask
---
You have "insomnia" because you're looking at screens too late before going to sleep, so then your brain needs hours to chill out before going to sleep. Don't trade sleep for RSV dude. As great as RS is, sleep is critical.
---
Morytania was ripe for an update anyway. Desert and Zeah are the other 2 likely regions. I think we were all hoping for Desert, but maybe they need more time to prepare that content. Zeah has gotten plenty of updates lately
---
Just make another acct. Before you do, change your main profiles name twice, unlocking your original name you want for your new group ironman acct. (if you do it once, your original name will still be locked to your account)
---
if you want point the best way is the dream mentor a and rfd bosses. Inadequacy is one phat boi
---
Lost mine yesterday
---
Nice dude should be able to get your buyable equipment now
---
Definitely! Can't wait :D
---
You can't let it get crumpled or the bank gets upset with you and your player has OCD so they can't let them get mixed up and need to be in separate stacks in the bag is my head canon
---
Actually I get to sleep fine. When I wake up I'm always wide awake and can never get back to sleep.
---
Are you using blood spells?  It makes the fight significantly easier imo.
---
Looks like someone didnt play in 2005
---
Noooooo. They did this in RS3 with Prif. It ends up completely splitting the world. No bueno. All of RS3 agrees that the Prif GE was a bad idea
---
You ain’t Settled so I could care less ya troglodyte.
---
Not really I noticed having done a lot of raids that if you kick people you dont see nearly as many items I think the game checks hm total points there is and decides whether or not theres gonna be an item then rolls who it's going to, would make sense cuz at least in my experience theres almost never a drop when someone gets kicked, or maybe my rng is different and I'm being superstitious
---
Context pls?
---
It’s only faster if you don’t afk. So 45k xp/hr at minnows if you click every 14 seconds, or 37k-45k I averaged fully afking fly fishing while rcing on my main. I’ll take my method because the main fuels the fires here, no need to get hit in the time to 99 for some gp.
---
This so much!
---
Dont paint it like that. Pkers habitually are killing naked people in the wilderness because "You dont know what they have." News flash, 99.9% of them have a spade, and the 0.1% who actually forget and bring their cash stack liking will end up wanting to quit the game, meaning %100 of people killing naked doing agility are less likely to vote for you. Stop acting like Pkers are the victims when they bring this on themselves for acting toxic
---
BOW SWORD
---
Yes. It forces a tradeoff. You can get the effect of healing or you can get 5 ranged str/10% magic damage/10 str and 15 att bonuses.
---
Do you mean a new game mode not league? Like a hcim with 1 life, but when you die it's literally gg and your account gets wiped?
---
This is begging for RWT abuse. I think Hagen will avoid any possible outlet for RWT nowadays
---
Idd... This ;)
---
hey you can still come back, he hasn't been reworked yet. Just as cancerous as always!
---
What happened? I don’t pay attention to this nerd shit
---
I think your thinking backwards pal
---
Now this post makes sense to me
---
You’re forgetting 
---
Virgin: In bed with scamming groups and account is passed around like a hot wife
---
Chad: smacks back scamming groups on Twitter with his irl face
---
Thank you!
---
I don't know, I was wondering that too. Maybe he made account with Google play, which read his age and now it doesn't allow to join friends chats. There used to be that kind of a system I think.
---
BTW, it was shield of arrav minigame chat.
---
Yeah im not suggesting the only bank they have is the shared bank. There would be a private bank and a shared bank.
---
Always wondered the same. Fashionscape is endgame
---
Nex was and always will be my favorite RS boss it was just perfect. It required a team, the fight was engaging with many cool special attacks she had (like her using Curses + Ancients looked cool) &amp; lore behind her was amazing. I'd love to see Nex back here on OSRS, we don't have to follow the same rewards or the mechanics, some things could be changed so she fits OSRS.
---
Zulrah is just harder to get into than most bosses because of the memorization, so people think it's end game. Once you get that down it's a worst a mid game boss.
---
Agreed
---
I just want my 10 year vet cape.
---
Don’t be so sure, his inventory is full och shrimps
---
Ur logic is bad
---
Content creation gets peopled playing the game. The majority of people didnt play dmm and it helped rqise the population by so much. Same for ironman and hardcore ironman. 
---
So it doesnt matter if .00001% of people play it because the update is going to make more people play than a raids3 or new quest.
---
lord draynor rekt me the first time i fought him so i trained combat for hours untill i got to his level just to kill him in a few hits
---
R/stims
---
It costs 250k to recharge it that way though so might just want to do the well anyway.
---
Your stats are too low for end game content, but they're fine for zulrah.
---
Because the player who lost their hardcore there is named latias
---
You ever gonna use your real voice or is it too risky? 
---
Keep up the great work btw
---
Using protection prayers isn't safe spotting because you aren't safe. Hence using pray to mitigate damage. Safe spotting is when monsters cant attack you because they are out of range.
---
Crystal Methling
---
Did he call you a doofus?
---
What the fuck is runecrafting?
---
Rendi was super drunk and said “I put 200 hours into my video and almost passed out fighting Jad because of a double ear infection” 
---
Settled egged him on saying “Smokey had 5 ear infections and other videos and still won” 
---
Rendi was pissed because settled replied with that and they both bickered, then Rendi apologized and Settled deleted his tweets because people started saying “yo you’re an asshole for that” rather than growing a pair and apologizing.
---
Real chads just BOT
---
No, no matter what, even if they change it to a fury attachment.
---
Some may say well it’s inky a small amount of heal. But those people aren’t the ones flicking high end pvp content into extremely long trips.
---
This would allow highly skilled players to extend trips to various bosses by 1-2 kills easily-without red click abuse.
---
I don’t usually shout power creep because games should always move forward and players should always become stronger as time goes by, but life leech in a game where 99 is max unboosted hp is asking for trouble.
---
I ask because if you died again and somehow were unable to get back to your stuff safely then it would be a bigger loss to lose the go and all the runes rather than no gp and just enough runes for a single tele
---
Okay then provide me evidence that most people within our country think what you're saying. I can provide evidence of polls where people approve of our countries direction and like our president and more. Good luck finding a poll that says how much Americans laugh at their own country's current state.
---
How the rich get richer! Gielnor is a plutocracy!
---
lel imagine replying to my comment to get attention
---
All is possible with ring of suffering and dds
---
As long as there is some kind of balance (Like lowering the stats on the amulet used) then yes.
---
Didn’t black out your run, special attack, or the compass. Gf acc
---
Idk u got high hp bro
---
everyone needs to knwo this, pplease make aPSA post about it! I literally have over 15 gmails at this point thanks to all the game modes and hcim...
---
Getting carpal tunnel is not a worthy achievement.
---
I will play the game my way with the advancements made to not give me a disability.
---
Was bout to say, BCP is 16m, tassets and prims are twice as expensive, nothing wrong with his setup especially if he has torture and ferocious gloves.
---
Though to also be fair if he has that he has DS2 done and could easily afford to grind Vorkath for enough to afford both.
---
Still salty they didn’t add Skeletal Horror with that questline
---
Are crystral impling viable for btw's now? They drop unenchanted glories.
---
Never punished
---
Unholy
---
Fair enough. But don't cry when you  do inevitavly get banned.
---
dont forget the natural regen rate with ur calc, there should be, and theres down time between rounds. u wont need regen bracelet. if u do need a food slot replace those last 3. but permenent double hitpoints heal will cover it im sure 0.666666666666666666666666666666666666666666...
---
Yeah they're great except they only spawn in priff after SOTE.
---
I had to slow down last night after diving deep for 2 months again. The grind becomes so self absorbing.
---
Lol I always assumed he was like 27
---
As far as i know there is only one person who got it at 10hp and at 90 slay using a boost
---
Weren't there journal entries you could find around Slepe from a Justiciar knight as he's losing his faith in Saradomin?
---
You think that wasting time on a video game in order to fund your membership is worth it? 
---
Re think it, TIME is the most valuable asset that you have. If you put 1 more hour at work instead of playing osrs for 2-3 hours (time it takes for an amateur to afford a bond I guess), you'll be able to fund many bonds and have more money in your bank account (IRL) that you already did. For example, If I work 1 more hour this week at my work place, I can fund 3 months of membership and play the game how I want instead of having the burden to farm for a bond every week. You would spend 3-6 hours every month to afford a bond for 1 account, add more accounts and you basically play exclusively to fund your bonds.
---
Also, you could invest in the real life stock market and buy bonds with your dividends, now thats next level.
---
Also, investing in the stock market is much more fun and relevant than "flipping" on the GE.
---
Bruh weed lmao
---
This is how you end up with a master clue step to wear an entire set that makes ironmemes angery online. Support.

Nice code, egghead
---
Questing is one of the most fun things I’ve done in this game. Both as a kid for the adventures and as an adult for the nostalgia.
---
Rocking that pimp stick, an imp of culture I see.
---
Nice nice nice
---
I’m 2150 something. At work so not sure. I made a wyvern alt and kill wyverns while grinding skills. Made like 50m in my last 10-20 levels. It’s easier training skills knowing I’m making an extra 5-600k/ hr. Alt has already gone 79-89 range
---
I don't even understand why you'd want to donate to these no name streamers anyways. I could see a few of the big names because they're popular enough that kissing viewers by taking money would hurt them more in the long run. But getting scanned by someone like Return of Wildy? Ya no shit, why would you trust them.

Woah! This is so cool. GBA / SNES vibes suit osrs.
---
This is for maximizing points per hour. What I posted is the current meta for med level accounts point boosting. XP per hour is a different layout.
---
Your account age is now exposed and prone to be recovered by social engineers. Suggestion: take down the post
---
This but for the original chambers of xeric. They stuffed so much BIS shit into that one activity
---
Would you consider metal dragons safespotting?
---
The big rats are the biggest noob traps ever.. so much faster just catching the regular ones
---
Is this still happening? It was bad for me 24 hrs ago but only lasted a few hours
---
This is fake.  If you look extremely carefully, you can see in the first inventory, there were 16 boxes.  However, in the second inventory only 15 slots are filled.  Nice try, but you can't fool me.
---
I’m so triggered
---
ok buddy
---
They would have to actually address the death mechanic topic, and they certainly don't want to do that.......
---
I also have it in collection log
---
Because you have to look at it relative to the current requirements to train runecrafting, which most of the time, is nothing. So yeah, I'd say completing this whole quest line and having 50's in multiple other skills justifies a method to boost XP rates a bit.
---
cheers for seeing it from my perspective m8

Well I wouldn’t doubt that everyone has the same car Honda’s are only $11 after all. 🦀

I remember getting like 2 rocs and a glod once. Permastunned for the rest of the nmz session, can't even get close to hitting anything.

Lol make sure to be careful and watch what you're toggling. I never turn on mobs with stuns like that except for that one desert treasure ice asshole.
---
When I went there, I used Red Chins with eagle eye and void range with archers ring i and anguish.   I couldn’t tell you my exact exp/hour because it was awhile back but I do remember around range 85-90 I was averaging 315xp/chin thrown.   I used stamina’s, range pots and I brought maybe 4 prayer pots (you will gain prayer pots doing this).   
---
I would highly recommend doing red chins if you are wanting a stupid fast range / hp experience gain in a quick amount of time!   
---
Another piece of advice, don’t bring the whole stack of chins just Incase you DC/don’t realize your prayer dropping and die, you will lose the whole stack of chins rather than bringing ~1k per trip.
---
This, heal other only would be worthwhile in scenarios where the option to trade over food is nowhere in site

Welcome to eastern Europe

Lmfao dwarf cannon..?
---
thanks for the input. i don't believe it was deserving of a perm ban but it's not a popular opinion.
---
To each their own, friend. I think it's pretty awesome!
---
Is it really? I was going to ask if there is software that can text to speech that well.. it would really help me with reading.
---
Never had ads
---
How does that even matter though? My account age?
---
Bring back these types of vids plz!!
---
Thank you
---
Yeah, I will continue to defend my opinion that there are only a handful of active pmods, and literally the rest are cancer that need to be purged from the pmod program.
---
Gonna guess that you suck at raids.
---
It's not porn if you can't see the goods between her thighs, right?

Nice drawing. Reminds me of some art by HitmanN from deviantart that has um.. risque attire.

damn i want cold war one to end, fucking love penguins
---
That’s perfect! Exactly what i was looking for. Thanks 😁
---
woah
---
thats pretty sick
---
Nice.
---
I think I found my new go to copy pasta.
---
It's a top tier strength question during account recovery, who knows the exact day an account was created other than the owner?
---
Settled? He's definitely shown some immature sides, most recently in his interaction with Rendi on Twitter. He won an award and then Rendi got beat by someone who rode on Settled's coattails to victory and Settled's reply to Rendi was to lmao and tell him to accept a loss.
---
As currently proposed the unique is a utility upgrade to the current BIS melee neck
---
New hardest mission ever=get a gf
---
Copypasta material

Drop down boxes

He was compensated for getting this accounts Runecrafting to 60.
---
I have been waiting for a new game mode for a while. I absolutely loved KOTS because knowledge and efficiency were greatly rewarded, and I have been asking for a KOTS2. When leagues were announced, I was excited, but the more I think about it, the more I’m upset. KOTS was great because you had limited in-game time (24h). Therefore, you had to plan every action perfectly to be able to win. With leagues, it’s going to come down to who can play the most, which sucks considering they are trying to make this somewhat competitive with tiers and rewards for placements.
---
U misunderstood. I drop them before the pker shows up. So at most hes getting 26 dark crabs if he catches me right before i drop.
---
Even a negligible amount of combat XP share would make it unviable for skillers. Although, I could see it raising game abusing CCs offering Slayer addicts to sell Slayer XP to AFKers, somewhat similarly to BA Services CC and others offering leeching.
---
Yes... But where is my cannon? It disappear.
---
Are you using a wily hell cat? Takes me no time at all

Reminds me of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon!
---
My reply is a literal example
---
Yeah its true you can get shit bad rng for the bosses. Had one time elvarg, 2 kamis and 1 random. Both kamis kept freezing me and elvarg fucks your stats if you dont have antifire shield so had to get rid of elvarg first so that i can fovus on freezing buddies. But overall with decent rng you should be fine killing most of the bosses pretty easily without sweating too much..
---
If your ok xp wasting on your main time you only need 1 sub for all that
---
Pvm prod who doesn’t have 99 slayer
---
Proud of u
---
I M Meen lookin ass
---
RuneScape default settings has most areas pretty dark. You don't have to of course, but turning the brightness all the way up is a game changer and makes ya avoid squinting at the screen a lot less in areas where it matters like the wilderness :)
---
I can't think of a way to implement this that wouldn't be abused by PVM clan chats offering to sell Slayer XP to AFKers.
---
Is my work making an optional day where I don't get paid but giving me stuff for going that day? Are you not sure how analogies work? Because that's a bad one. Why do I have to pony up for rewards in a game mode I have no interest in.
---
So people who are near maxed and have nothing else to accomplish on their main get to play this mode and make money off of me who wants to keep leveling my main. You think this is alright?
---
Someone tell him before I hurt his feelings.
---
He was avoiding temple trekking before getting RCB, Im guessing he will never do that now that he has it
---
I misstyped mining because I was sitting in game mining.. I meant 99 crafting and construction, neither of which are profitable but both have the most useful capes that will make your experience much better. Making the money to get there is kind of at your discretion, slayer bossing is the best money in my opinion.
---
You can do blast furnace, just do knights sword and you are almost 30 lvl smithing if i remember correctly.
---
With blast furnace you can get 500k per hour at least when I was playing last winter. I got my first bond as a gift and earned all bonds after that with in-game money. There are of course faster ways too but I would never play f2p until barrows stats just because of that. But everyone has their preferences of course.
---
It's seriously worth just paying that 5 dollars/euros, just get it from anywhere, where I live you could collect bottles from the streets and earn that pretty quickly on a weekend evening.
---
nice, lets see that gear tab, seeing organized tabs satisfies me greatly.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEE nice
---
I somehow managed to get a runite bar from one last night. I didn't even know that was possible. Does it roll the rare drop table?
---
Rip gf
---
yes I hit 118 combat and finally finished the quest of buying a regen bracelet for 1gp by using the "Sell" feature
---
im mentally in 3019 already
---
I was hoping the item that would leech life from enemies without Guthans or SGS spec would come from a Warding rune enhancement, not really feeling it tied to an equip. I want to vote no but no idea if Jagex will try to introduce lifesteal another way and I do want the mechanic. Vampiric potion or something?
---
Hmmmmk relax there
---
Le gem???
---
No sorry, you can’t hop worlds WHILE in NMZ. I mean that I’ll have an afk sesh that almost lasts 6 hours, and then I’ll go and restart another one before logging or hopping, so I’m still in the same almost 6-hour long session, so I get auto logged very soon after getting into NMZ.
---
Unfortunately I think this is more about the avg. age of the playerbase.  I think the playerbase is still growing, and as time goes on hopefully the game will become a bit more lighthearted again..
---
Use RL for a month then try going back to the default client. You'll switch back to RL within 24 hours.
---
2261 total, I personally just afk the hell out of every single skilling related activity on my road to max. Honestly I can't dedicate myself to be focused on OSRS when it comes to anything that's not PVM/PVP related. I find most of these activities much more bearable when I'm instead focused on doing course work, cleaning around my house, playing with my dog, or just watching a movie or a show. 
---
Mining - Averaged 20-25k xp/hr most days at MLM gaining 100-150k xp/day
---
RC - Averaged around 30k xp/hr doing soul runes afk
---
Fishing - Averaged 40k xp/hr doing afk dark crabs
---
Crafting - Made over 100k Molten Glass and took 2 weeks to blow it all for 99 crafting. 
---
Woodcutting - The King of AFK skills 'nuff said.
---
Hunter - I've only done birdhouses and I'm at 9.9m xp right now so .... most afk way to train hunter I guess.
---
I only upvote this cause of Wolf (and ofc Ash)

It will kick you out of the dream

\-Jagex is no longer owned by the Chinese 
---
\-Devs made a statement during last weeks Q@A that there is no shady business happening at Jagex, this is just business. 
---
\-OSRS on release had 3 devs. The current OSRS team is at the largest its ever been and they claim they are making new hires.

\-You talk like you're sitting in on the Jagex share holders board, but can you back up your claims that they are downsizing to artificially show high profit margins for their investors during the liquidation process?   
---
Sounds to me like you're trying to seem smart and like you know what you're saying but your comment is based on hearsay and shit you pulled straight out your ass.
---
What did you do for the other 2 months?
---
To be fair, I was f2p from about 78-89 because of the reason I’m assuming you’re thinking, why waste membership on this method. But I put membership back on because I thought I could get the pet and at one point had 6 genie lamps in my INV to put towards slayer.
---
This is satire right
---
Ahh, fitting for Maryland. Nice
---
Do you not see the air guitar lmao
---
youre literally asking for it to be faster. obviously left click con is speeding up the xp rate because youre clicking less. if not, how tf is using the same finger to click more often better than using index for lmb and middle for rmb as a mix? I know this is a fucken crazy suggestion, but maybe play less or switch up what youre training more often so you don't have a sore wrist
---
edit:spelling
---
I'm a 75 99 75 main and I love it. 
---
109 cmb, 2k+ total and probably 90% PVM focused. Obviously it's not efficient doing solo stuff as if you were max level but it's really satisfying.
---
I'm at like 120kc solo CoX, done plenty of each slayer boss, a bit Arma and Sara, vork, zulrah etc.
---
Only things you can't really do are Corp because you can't use spears and haven't tried any ToB because I mostly play solo but I'm sure you could with a team
---
There's a few items you can't use like whip, DH Lance, ferocious gloces. But overall, there are enough alternative items to use that it's not an issue
---
I went 75 99 75 because I loved med level pking back pre-eoc but didn't want to make a main + med acc in OSRS. Ironically, I never really ended up getting back in to pking and now I'm just addicted to PVM and love the account.
---
Lol I played since day 1 of OSRS release and your Skilling stats are the pretty much same as mine. My PvM stats are maxed though. I really do not enjoy Skilling haha
---
Blood magic just provides passive healing through out the fight I used blood barrage and would brew once or twice after the big attack, passively heal up over the cycle them brew once or twice to get back over full health before the next one.  It helped a lot and damage was good.
---
They spend time playing the league and getting the ability to sell the cosmetics, at probably a really low gp/hr in comparison to pvming in the maingame, and you get to make more money than them and buy the cosmetics, setting you at a net gain. I don't see how this is a punishment. A punishment would be if you couldnt get the cosmetics at all.

Saving up for that saradomin shield

reads like a rant from terry davis
---
Ah yes, the guy that comments ah yes the feet guy in every post.
---
Never would of thought of this, I'll for sure bring my msb(I) with me from now on
---
Why would it be satire?  I genuinely do not understand what is so hard about right clicking to train 3 of the skills with some of the fastest xp rates in game (thiev, con, pray).  I did 99 thiev and blackjacked a good portion of that right clicking.  I don't see the problem here?
---
That too, I've got something like 25k dust on top of the 5k cannonballs and whatever I've used so far. It adds up quick.
---
Ahhh okay.  Yeah I can usually last 6 hours and reset at lunch then last another 6 before calling it quits for the day lol.  At 72k exp per hour for doing nothing, I’ll be maxed combat in no time.  Full Dharoks, fire cape, fury, d boots.   Is full obsidian any better?
---
Think i got alot before coll came but sure.. Im at work atm but i  Will pic it later
---
Zmi, which is the most common method to use until 77, requires lunar diplomacy and 71 magic to be done efficiently. Lunar diplomacy has fewer requirements than this quest, but the levels required are similar. I'd be fine making this a little better than zmi but I still don't see why it should be the best method.

Ahh yeah the pet chance is a very good reason, forgot about that for sure. Also the anglers outfit benefit as well. Makes sense, was just curious. Congrats though!
---
Cox you can get 10k pure ess as a drop pretty commonly, wyrms drop 150? Ish gargoyles drop 150 zulrah drops 1.5k each time, larrans keys drop 5k I've got like 65k atm on mine and I've used up like 15k of it. Early game getting ess sucks but endgame it's just another collection you do nothing with like mind runes, should get 77 off that + a slight bit more
---
Wtf. This is actually so good it should be a meme. Or wait, is it already? Or not?

Same dude. I maxed melee on my acc using NMZ while at work. 
---
I forget what kind of xp rates I was getting, but yeah I used full Obsidian to do it. The cost might be lower because you don’t have to repair the DH? But I also used Super combat pots instead of overloads. You use ~1 an hour, so usually around 10 per day. They were around 10 each when I did it, not sure what they’re at now. So I was spending 100k/ day on melee training. 
---
[Check out Spellsey’s guide](https://youtu.be/Q0huAx4pGSk) if you haven’t already! This is what I based my melee training off of. He also has one for ranged and mage, although I disagree with his magic setup a lot.
---
you should just enable the center mouse button (scroll wheel) to control your camera. you just press and drag.
---
Using the menu entry swapper is cheating, and Jagex has come out and said this.  I fully agree with them.  Furthermore, before altars came out the "most used option" was to bury the bone.  It makes intuitive sense that this should be the case.
---
Either live with it or get banned like the cheater that you are.  It's so fucking easy to train pray or con with right click...  They are two of the fastest skills to train in game.  take your entitled bullshit back to fortnite or whatever other shit game you play

That makes sense. If *every* pker just skipped over every skiller in the wilderness just wearing a glory or whatever, then it would make sense to always go to the wilderness pretending like you’re not carrying anything.

Hey, at least we dont have bots fucking up the economy
---
IT'S BIG BRAIN TIME

Yeah I used him as well.   The range just gets so expensive for such low xp rates imo.    I haven’t tried his mage afk.   Any suggestions on the two ?

Honestly all they need to do is allow 3+ players to do the same task and for it to persist past logins.
---
&gt; Make this game like other games
---
no, its fine, level requeriments doesn't really matter, what the new items do is what matter, unlike in other games we have here a complex economy
---
I went in once and was also playing my ironman in the wintertodt and took me about 45 minutes to realize auto retaliate was off. I have no words
---
What about the average player who has time to do neither? Doesn't seem very fair to them. Literally locking rewards away. What happens when these items reach peak rarity and are out of almost everyone's gold range?
---
Have you looked at the drop tables they are on? The answer is fuck all, apart from these dumb chests that jagex keep adding.
---
&gt; The only way to make demands high than supply is make every trip to a boss require more food than drops from the boss. That is prohibitive from a balance stand point because the less you dodge and the lower your stats the more food you need.

Literally everything you said there is wrong.

Do you people not understand that sub counts hardly matter at all anymore? Potential exposure for a dead youtube channel is idiotic. It's like pointing at the userbase of myspace, yea it used to be popular and frequented by millions. Those millions of accounts are still on there, but no one gives a fuck about looking at it. 
---
It's all about the number of views your ad gets now, not the "potential" to get views by running the risk of putting an ad on a dead channel.

Blood spells/Sang + passive healing tormented bracelet = super OP.

In the dev blog, I can’t remember which mod said it, but they said it isn’t possible to link accounts at this time. And it could easily be used for RWT as well.
---
tfw you can’t afford iron
---
Mind runes almost definitely.
---
Souls/bloods are nice if you wanna AFK, but will take significantly longer to get the pet.
---
If you're super rich you could consider hiring some runners, just keep in mind that to get the pet will likely end up costing you billions (So wouldn't really recommend unless you do ToB on an alt while maxing or have multiple rune dragon alts, it'd definitely be more efficient to do mind runes alone than grind the money then pay runners to help you)

I got the cape! i did what you said and took a little break and got it ! thanks so much!!

If you’re super low level, black chins are relatively easy.

My cable snapped when I tried to put it together :(
---
Well considering there are only 2 players in the entire game with 200m in every skill, I don’t really get your point. For the average player, there is no guarantee that you will get a pet at any point in your RuneScape career. You can get 2277 total and not get a pet. You can kill bosses thousands of times and not get a pet. You can get 200m farming xp and not get the pet. Just read the rest of the comments in this thread.
---
Will add next time I’m on
---
No, only him.
---
Right? They’ve really expanded on a lot of areas and gave me more things I can waste my time on! Lol
---
Runecrafting is fucking hot
---
Cox is both easier to do and easier to learn. I say those separately because for cox, you just kinda get the we do raids minimum stats and gear and show up, and some mentors will take your clueless ass on a raid that is 100% guaranteed to end with olm dying. This is very different than tob because if you wipe you just lose, and the raid ends. As such, mentor raids with 0kc players only happen with 0kcers who have already been to verzik (meaning they have beaten all the rest of the rooms with other players one way or another). So it requires real motivation and effort to even be eligible to be taught tob whereas with cox you kinda just put on the gear and show up lol.
---
Yea but the mods this time around seem to be more conscious of power creep so I don’t think they would put both in the game but who knows really.
---
yeah.. and your dialog with Princess Astrid, who is supposed to be your SO is just something like "hey you worked things out with them" "yep" and there's no more chat options! like cmon
---
Complex economy my ass. The upper 1% of OSRS dont really care for new content. They just want their banks to look good. Any time their is a new BIS people complain and bitch. This game needs to change or it will die. T-Bow cant be best in slot everywhere. so new content needs to come into place make make certain things niche. I love that god wars content is strong and in a lot of cases best in slot but they needs other things to spice things up.
---
Doesn’t have to be illegal to be pointless.

Capes go on your back, not your arm.

Mind runes are 259 hours for pet and are 30k loss per hour, meaning 7.5m loss on average for pet.
---
Soul runes are 515 hours for pet and are 216k profit per hour, making them 111.5m profit. 
---
Thus, in order to make mind runes more worth ot than soul runes, you need to make 119m in 256 hours, or 460k/hr or more.
---
In other words, mind runes are far more effective. 
---
(Note that blood runes are better profit and pet rate than souls, but the same conclusion is still reached.)
---
Of course, this is assuming that you are spending your time actively playing. Do mind runes when you can and blood runes when you want to put in less focus.
---
Never had ads on osrs mob your phone just must be infected with somthing

Me too. Not sure what that was about.

I'll just throw my hat in the ring: no. I have multiple accounts and none of them got hacked. Auth on rs and email, pin, voila.
---
The same way you made your primary account, then talk to the ironman guy on tutorial island.
---
Dpick is only 6% faster than rune pick meaning over his 270 hour grind he would've only saved 16 hours. If it takes 10 hours to get grinding a boss in the wildy it barely seems worth it to get.

Meet Pikkupstix, my non-area locked friendless-account. After playing the game with friends in 2006 I decided to up the ante, to forge my own jounrey from scratch.

The Duel Arena Clue Scroll Step.

I don't really ever use overloads at nmz cuz they don't make it any more afk for me. I'll equip best melee gear for str or dharoks if I feel like spending on repairs eventually. I'll bring only absorptions and rock cake. I'll load up on absorptions for about 200-300 pts so I don't lose much if I get disconnected. Eat rock cake to 1 up then go to town on monsters.  I can afk at that point or if I'm looking to extend my nmz trip for as long as possible I'll prayer flick rapid heal every minute or so to keep hp at 1
---
5 minutes is with maximum efficiency spawn layout. Not every run will give you the chance to get 5 minutes.

13,036,000. Just standard 99
---
Even with raw stats you are wrong. All blessed d'hide boots have the following stats: 0 stab/crush/slash, -10 magic, +7 range attack bonus and +4 to all defensive stats with +1 prayer bonus. Whereas pegasians have: 0 stab/crush/slash, -12 magic,  and +12 range attack bonus and +5 to all defensive bonus. They are nowhere near "3x stronger than blessed d hide boots", they are barely 2x as strong in range attack bonus.
---
Too bad? If you want the high exp rates you need to deal with the inherent risk of pkers. That’s how they balance it. I’m sorry that upsets you but it’s the reality, and it’s good game design.

Why exactly are we talking down about RS3 players again? Just playing RS3 doesn't mean they are clowns, nor does it mean they approve of MTX
---
You should also ask on the RS3 reddit because you will get a lot of biased views on both sides so you will need both sides to get accurate truths.
---
The big fundamental differences...
---
RS3 has an “evolution of combat” system which turned a lot of people off on its initial forms because it’s initial forms were pretty bad. Current EoC is literally just classic point and click combat but with extra variety in the attacks you can perform. The auto click combat works using a system called revolution where it just runs through and auto activates your abilities for when it’s the correct time between regular auto attacks. But you can still activate abilities out of order manually if you want, and for really intense pro players there is a full manual option where you control and do everything. It really is just standard RS combat but with more variety. You can still play the game you always did but the point of this evolution was to allow for more interesting and varied monster combat, high level bossing in RS3 is nuts in a really good way because of it and even regular combat just feels less dull during long grinds. But on the other hand it basically all but killed PvP because the system just does not work well when it’s player abilities verse player abilities. But beyond all this there is also a legacy combat mode that is just the regular OS point and click combat in it to. 
---
RS3 is actually just “runescape” it’s the same game that has been running for well over a decade now. As a result the focus of the content shifted because now people have been playing so long a lot more players are closer to max. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t stuff to do on the contrary while all the old low and mid stuff still exists the game now has a lot of content geared toward the higher end. In RS it used to be maxing means you are done but in RS3 maxing means you open basically an entire second chapter to the game. But since content is geared to higher players now that means methods to speed past the earlier initial grind was introduced so there is pretty fundamental change in where people are found, how people train, etc...
---
OSRS was created because of how bad EoC was initially. It’s designed to be a brand new start for players with a runescape designed for better or worse as a mirror of 2007 Runescape. This means a lot of quality of life was gone but at the same time it meant this new version was free from the baggage, power creep, etc.. of RS. It also meant over time this game was able to evolve in a different way and become something very uniquely its own, this isn’t 07 RS anymore it’s something else.
---
Then there is the polling system which is the primary difference in how they handle content. In RS3 content is designed by jagex and put into the game, sometimes they run beta servers to get player feedback and testing but the game is ultimately very much just the game Jagex wants to make. In OSRS they poll content before adding it, if content doesn’t pass certain thresholds it’s scrapped entirely or reworked to try again later. Meaning most things added to the game are controlled by what the players want. Sounds like OSRS’s method is superior right? Well no not really, because with the nature of the polling it actually means it only takes a minority to control the content. This is a huge sticking point especially when it comes to skills, OSRS hasn’t had a new skill or even a unique skill of its own in ages because they keep not reaching the necessary threshold even when the majority is still largely for it. Likewise it means content that is less popular or forgotten struggles to get new things and ideas that might not sound as interesting or good on paper but ended up cool execution or were able to evolve into something cool is content that doesn’t get to see the light of day. So RS3 gets bad updates but it also gets a constant growth as a game even if at times it grows in directions people don’t like. While OSRS can have stagnation issues growing much slower but generally bypasses updates people dislike.
---
Then we have two more big differences, community and montization. Because OSRS had a mobile version to drastically spike its numbers and doesn’t deal with the mix of bad and good that RS3 does it has a larger community...it also has a significant bot problem that 07 RS struggled with that is largely absent in RS3 driving its numbers further. That means the world is packed in OSRS while RS3 it’s more empty feeling or the packed players have consolidated in higher areas you can’t get to without harder quests. Clans have also been a thing in RS3 for a very long time to the point that clans are almost necessary for constant community, because of the mentality why talk to a bunch of fandoms and deal with toxic public chat when you can just mute them and talk with an active group of your actual RS friends.
---
As for monetization there is a pretty fundamental difference. OSRS only had bonds an item you buy for real money but then can trade for a week of membership and sell to other players for tons of gold. RS3 has a big non-mandatory MTX element where players can spend money to buy tons of various cosmetic overides, pets, and unique animations. However it also has a loot box mechanic called treasure hunter where you spend keys you get while playing the game and logging in, but you can also just buy them for real money. TH key essentially give you a random loot box for each one. However where the big controversy comes in is most TH promos are exp lamp based, essentially allowing players to buy exp which brings with it all kinds of debates on the pros and cons. Like on one hand it means players like busy adults who can’t sink in the same amount of time they used to be able to as kids can still keep up and actually enjoy the content they want to enjoy without the grind. On the other hand people argue that it devalues the work of people who did put in that grind. Treasure hunter prizes are also random hence the loot box element so that brings in the whole argument of predatory gambling practices preying on people who suffer addiction issues. It’s hugely controversial and a lot of people fake to OSRS or quit RS entirely just because of it.
---
As a whole both games are really good, they have their up’s and downs, and I would recommend trying both and seeing how you feel.

I don't know if you guys know any pmods offline, but the look itself is hilariously accurate. Unlike maxed sweatys, pmods are usually rail thin hyper-nerds/complete social outcasts with glasses and no dress sense.

Saying kcers constantly haHAA

Depends on if we're talking ironman mode or not as that's a different topic. 
---
Obviously MLM is a shitty comparison and Zalcano is far better. I'll even do the math. 45k xp/hr and 300k gp/hr. That means it takes 2.65 hours to reach the same xp but you make 6.63m-7.95m so we have 1.65 hours to make up that money. 3.84m-4.64m which isn't really realistic unless you're doing Raids. Even with Max gear at Zulrah you're not going to make over 4.5m/hr. 
---
For an actual comparison, doing gem rocks is roughly \~58k xp/hr and 770k gp/hr. It would take 3.4 hours to reach that amount of xp and it would make 8.5-10.2m gp or 7.73m -9.43m but we have 2.4 hours to make up that money to make it better. Meaning if we can make 3.22-3.9m an hour we're better off doing gem mining. Which is duo-able with Zulrah and Vorkath. 
---
Now lets say we do 3t Granite for 120k xp/hr (max rates are \~135k so I think 120k is a fair comparison) it would take 7.05 hours to reach the same amount of xp but we would make 17.65-21.15m meaning if we can make 2.92-3.5m an hour doing either Vorkath or Zulrah we're better off doing 3t granite. 
---
Yes it's better than MLM, debatable on Gem rocks, and worse than 3t granite.

This gets requested every other day. It is called an MMORPG for a reason 😂.

I’m assuming you haven’t done that many cox.
---
A 75% drop chance would mean that you have roughly 600K points.
---
600K points is a scale of about 20 people. 
---
Assuming everyone contributed equally, 30K / person, with a 1/20 (5% chance of your name).
---
If you decided to kick out 10 people, right as olm dies, you lose 300k points, but still have 30K.

So that’s, a 37.5% chance of a drop, 1/10 for your name, meaning the drop rate is the exact same. 
---
Now if you had 50k, and kick out 10 other people with 50k -&gt; 100k is  12.5% chance, with 6.25% being yours vs 600k points/75%/50k = 6.25% chance it’s yours.
---
The numbers always work out to being even. Kick or don’t kick, it’s *always* the same %.

i know how to force spawn lol been doing since release the timer i was talking about is how the bots just happen to know when an imp spawns on a specific world and they magically all start mass logging in lol

50m setup, with most of it being on dragon warhammer?

still crazy good nonetheless. i remember watching streams all day the first two days they came out, people were having such a hard time passing some of the bosses.

I hope when you color graceful black it disintegrates and if you try to buy new graceful from Grace she says sorry no virgins allowed
---
Said feasible not achievable, you can do it but for multiple runs, not likely, on top of that you'd need to have already done it many times on a main for practice

If it crumbles the Torture then sure. That'll keep the money moving as people will farm both and sell to the sweaty crowd with bill banks.

If this happened you could kill a shit load of hydra for example, leave all bones on floor, die, get all your loot plus the bones you didn’t pickup.  Even paying the 100k death fee you would still profit.
---
Sounds broken to me, I don’t think this should happen.
---
Yeah hopefully this gets talked about more and Jagex listen to feedback, I'm still thinking about how I'd change my suggestion because that's not flawless either.
---
They mean at the same exact time.
---
y not a full helm
---
I’ll be interested to see what info they release prior to the release. I bet a good deal will change how I have things planned out. 
---
Also, Arceuus (or hosideus) should have a herblore shop, IMO. 
---
And completely unrelated: I also think that if they want to try and re-poll the ‘warding’ combat potions (can’t remember what they were called), Arceuus would be a good place to be the HQ for them. Maybe through a mini quest/activity that teaches you how to make them.
---
Really annoying because you have to just type in chat over and over and hope someone will help you
---
For why MES should be allowed? Because it’s some very basic modifications that modern games allow
---
Poe has plenty of overlays and addons
---
Wow allows you to mod you UI to kingdom come and back
---
You shouldn’t be ever fighting the interface to play the goddamn game. If every time you go to a banker you bank with them, then changing where the option is in the list makes sense.

Why are you so hardstuck on this concept?

Avrage to get this pet from red wood is lile 18-20m xp if I remeber correcltly. I am soon at 40m xp myself without it. Aslo ~31m farming, ~25m thieving and 99+ rest with only rc pet as skilling pet..
---
Insuffulated, its tooweak

Yo you might actually just have poor verbal memory, which can be a sign of ADHD. I thought that was the case too until I found out that my verbal memory is borderline retarded (5 percentile). Another good sign would be if you can't help yourself from playing Runescape when you go to class.
---
I guess it does kinda suck to replace a normal neck with the bone crusher neck. Still I feel like there’s gotta be some situations where it’s nice to have an automatic catacombs of kourend effect.
---
Sike😭😭😂😂😭😭😂😂 Gotcha bitch💀💀💀💀
---
Not unless they are planning on changing something about tort. As it is, there's no reason to make the BIS melee neck even BISer.
---
where draw the line though, should we be able to just spam left click everything to perform any action in the game?
---
Suggestion: Make a friend.  It's a multiplayer game.  It's time.
---

Thanks for your patience. The ICU team has almost finished their investigation and have so far concluded that the activity is suspicious and tripped our anti-cheating systems on a number of levels. Naturally, to have 11 accounts logged in at the same, training all of them for a very long period of time raises concerns, especially with some suspicious activity, is unusual. However, simply unusual behaviour isn't sufficient to permanently ban an account, and on this occasion, provided the final few checks come back as clear, the bans will be removed, any membership credit restored, and an investigation into how the original bans were issued launched.
---
Hmmm
---
I'd rather 95 runecrafting
---
Think OP definitely cares about highscores seeing from their sig but me? Fuck no
---
What did he say :o
---
Parental controls limited the amount of time i could be logged in to the computer an hour a weekday and 3 hours/day on weekends. 
---
Also during highschool i also played sports year round and was a slow homework doer so i couldnt play during the school year. Also i felt like there was a stigma for playing runescape in highschool. Its a pretty geeky thing to do
---
Finally in college theres less class time, no sports, you can play during class and since im at a tech school a lot of people play rs so its cool now.
---
You get hp xp anytime you damage something directly. 1 damage = 1 hp xp usually. If you're training with strength style you get 4 strength xp for every 1 damage done. 
---
There are exceptions like barbarian fishing where you can gain strength xp without any health xp if this is something you wanted for some reason.
---
Proof
---
Ur just bad at the game

"We know there are multi-player activities. This does not need to be one of them "

It makes sense,  I honestly just didn't see it as this big of a deal.  I just see it as part of the charm of the game..

Jagex's laziness is gonna be the death of this game. They need to partner with runelite and ban all other forms of plugins, and revise the current RL plugs.

No. He was afking at sand crabs. I just attacked him with my magic shortbow.
---
I did. I even studied for a couple of AP classes on my own. Did you still get good grades? If so, that's probably because of all of the handout sheets they give you until you get to college.
---
Also bathroom passes don't really got anything to do with teaching quality in regards to the academic part. Is it a shitty way to encourage the development of executive functions? Yeah but the efficacy of schools in teaching life skills is a whole nother topic.

Whatever base 80-90/95 in terms of combat stats is. I’m thinking like 105 to 118/120?
---
don't get your hopes up ive seen at least 10 other posts on here asking for this
---
Well at least you'll be first-page prayer
---
Unless Jagex outright bans 3pc and fixes their own, it will just be a cycle that continues forever assuming they do remake 07 again. People will always justify cheating if it helps them.
---
*"Haha just get someone to help you, we're on an MMORPG! You're antisocial and have no friends lmao"*
---
You hear this shit from keyboard warriors brainlets on here every time, but they're ignoring the bigger issue; Hard clues, on average, take around 5 minutes to complete. This step alone can take well over 5 minutes (often over 10 waiting for a clanmate or 15-20 spamming the duel arena), and depends completely on the availability of other players and their **willingness to help you for completely fucking nothing in return**. The meta for the clue step is currently just to drop it whenever you get it.
---
This isn't like Raids, or group bossing, where people group together for mutual benefit. This is a *favor*, and one you have to request people drop what they're doing to come help you with. Remove this garbage.
---
Id say you could kill agressive mobs.

Sure. But we can still hate them for MTX. Plus that game is much less fun in the context of having your account that you played for years essentially being transfered over to a completely new game. I'm still salty about EOC :/
---
We live in an automated world with a ever expanding population still. The need for unskilled labor continues to drop. Being "productive towards society" isn't even something a lot of jobs attempt to be anymore.
---
Throw a disability or some unfortunate circumstances in and unemployment benefits make sense to an extent.
---
Finland has my favorite model for sure, full universal basic income. For 18 months, no strings attached you get $700 a month from the govt. At the end of 18 months, if you are employed, you will continue to receive $700. If you are unemployed after 18 months, you are barred from reapplying to the program and recommended a higher level of care (mental health).

No system is perfect, but letting people starve creates desperate people who would probably become violent criminals if it meant feeding their children and themselves.

Love this style, the swampletic one had me creasing too. Hoping to see some barrows brothers rear their heads sometime soon.

For that you can use revolution which is basically a cross between the 2 combat systems. It still has an ability bar, but automatically uses the abilities for you.

Oh i didnt know it was supposed to be funny.

If you don't have any luck here go to the mini games tab in game, find shield of arrav group then right click it and join clan chat. Often you'll find someone in there.

---
Probably an unpopular opinion, but personally I have no issue with Imbues coming from NMZ. I do think it is easier than it should be to earn NMZ Points (you shouldn't profit while getting high AFK exp), but it isn't out of place for a minigame to offer something like that and it is way better than what RS2 did for the imbues. The idea of bossing dropping a scroll or such to imbue always seemed silly; it just seems better to have a mage npc imbue it, which is what NMZ does.
---
But Why though? Do simply not so many people know Wyvern Bones give the same exp or is there another use for dragon bones which wyvern ones don't offer
---
rsn checks out though, right?
---
Maybe take some time and read the comments before blurting out a nonsensical argument that was already squashed 10+ comments up.

&gt; I think a Blood Fury

Blood fury exists in RS3 ergo this is not allowed. https://runescape.wiki/w/Blood_amulet_of_fury

he's using the bird to tick manipulate lol
---
This video made me actually cackle lmao
---
those are MY stats.
---
He said himself that creating the Swampletics series had got him into video making and editing. I'm sure he's smart enough to take what he's learned to some kind of professional context.
---
There probably are some ways to update it to be less bad without that sort of abuse, but it is not easy.
---
I think it currently works by giving both players the same amount of a creature. Perhaps instead they could give you both the same task count so if we got a task of 100 Abby Demons and you killed one, my task decreases to 99 Abby Demons. You wouldn't get Exp unless you participated in kills, same as it is now. And since you'd need to be a group before the task is assigned, that could reduce some abuse...
---
But I am not sure how you'd go about points (e.g. if I didn't kill any of the 100 Abby Demons, do I still get points? How many would I need to kill to earn points? Half? Does that reduce freedom too much to the point the current system is better?). And I could see players doing something like always doing Coop Slayer with an Alt, soloing the good tasks, then having the Alt help them speed up the bad tasks for faster exp... Perhaps it would be best if Coop Slayer was kinda separate to normal Slayer and awarding something different than Slayer points or such.
---
If you have 80~ crafting then you're not really risking anything besides supplies. You will protect your rune crossbow, and diamonds can be bought from Tzhaar.
---
I would try Chaos Ele first. Venenatis is much more active and harder to setup.

They didn't do it on purpose

It had to do with changing something else made the pixel dissapear.

They actually said they don't know how the pixel got there  because it technically doesn't exist. They had to go back and add it manually.
---
They can't even tell if you are using one a lot of the time.
---
This isn't proof of botting it looks like he's just tick manipulating. Also posting his rsn and accusing him of botting is against this subreddits rules

Huh, very interesting, thank you for the explanation!

Haha, how interesting. Thank you.

My ca!

You losers should've quit rs3 the day eoc came into the game. No sympathy for people still playing that trash game.

Thats for the future i assume, keep playing and youll see them come (:
---
BIG yikes , gl on the grind mate
---
Hate to say it but this is a big quest for your first time. You really wanna struggle and do this right on your own. Train. Get better healing food. Make sure to use the best armor and anti-dragonfire shield you can get, this is a stepping stone for you to begin spreading your runescape wings.
---
If youre really concerned, get magic to 25, and carry runes to teleport away to varrock if things get hairy.
---
You're using that wrong
---
It's current year. Why would anyone not have karambwanji for your cat

Only mass quitting will work, otherwise nothing will happen
---
Yes. Clue juggling is a real thing.
---
The OSRS map of Darkmeyer still has the Blisterwood tree building in it.
---
In earlier posts, I did mention how I'd rather it upgrade the Occult Necklace than the Torture. Back with ToB, I did suggest a new Magic Amulet that boosted healing of Blood Spells; we got the Sang Staff instead but I could still see something like that fitting nicely.
---
I think my original idea was to give it +15 Magic Attack, tied BiS with 3rd Age, but only 5% Damage (half the Occult) and then give it a chance for Blood Spells to heal more. It would likely be very strong in places you use blood spells but overall it would be niche; also the accuracy would make it good for TBing.

Bruh we should have a 99 farming party for my arm

Put 3700 hours into OSRS, then switched to RS3. Hadn't played RS3 since a few years before EOC and hadn't achieved any considerable levels or milestones on RS3 pre-EOC.
---
I find RS3 to be a far more fun and involved experience compared to OSRS, especially when it comes to combat. There is a metric shit-tonne of content to get through, and all aspects of thsoe content can be enjoyed without any MTX (though its still a bit heavy)
---
Maybe... people just prefer RS3
---
4taa is kinda silly imo, but I guess we have tick flicking
---
Dunno the scene in OS, but competitive CW in RS3 brought out some of the shadiest folks in the game, I'd absolutely not be surprised if people used some sort of bot to improve their edge during the game.

Realistically, people don't know about wyvern bones.

Already brought that up a few times. But taking a Blood Fury and adding to a Torture is even worse of a ripoff than just giving us the Blood Fury.

I got the occult necklace luckily at 8kc, I enjoy these bosses more since the big drops feel awesome! Even KBD feels more rewarding than vorkath due to living or dying getting to the boss haha. I agree with you my man, love the big ticket items more than consistent streams of gp.

I feel you man. I recently got a 2 day out of nowhere for, "Macroing". Even though I've never been banned for botting or macroing nor have I ever felt the need to macro or bot. I tried to reach out to a Jmod on twitter but he just ignored me. Lmao.

But what the other person is suggesting is that people are breaking the rules and because the system doesn't check for situations like that, they get away with it.
---
Your mom purposefully working 19 hours a week indicates that she was following the rules, not cheating the system. If it allowed her to still work a part-time (or less since part-time is usually 20 hours) and claim unemployment then those are the rules and she's following them.

Coochie

So the only time to make a group is lvl 3 at the start, or if you are increasing the group size by inviting a group ironman who is solo. So like a group of 4 high levels can recruit 1 high level who was alone? How does that work.

What happens if you are kicked out can you rejoin other groups? Or are you stuck alone. Or can you recruit with lvl 3s so 4 level 3s and 1 high level.

I'm confused on how the system works

I can vouch for deliveritems, they brought me a rope to sara gwd my first time going

Damn, rude often enough you can't even remember which person it would be?
---
I wonder why you have nobody to share this with. OOF

And in my mind, that’s the best part, that there is now a hard-coded green pixel in the icon to appease the masses on reddit

Gotta find something to bring other people's achievements down to they have an excuse to ignore their own mediocrity.
---
Yeah i felt it was really ambiguous and I don't know how the system is supposed to work at the moment. Besides the highscores factor in the largest group you've been in and you can't go down in size atleast for highschores.
---
Mind if I join too? I’m only 67/71/62 melee. I’m currently working on training up to 75 for all through nmz but eventually I’d like to get into raiding and learn some things.

At 15 i ate sand..

Nice vid man. That's definitely a good alt option
---
Yeah, so if we take your logic in the other direction, there should be no left click options at all because it's easier to left click once than right click into a menu to left click, and something being easier is bad.

what were you at revs for?

Ya we've been taught it all wrong from the beginning. You are responsible for your own prosperity, the government should not be your parent.
---
If you received unemployment checks for 2 months and then nothing people would have fires lit up under their asses.
---
It doesn't have to be the most glorious job ever, but if you can't get a job in 2 months you're really shit and need to sort yourself out.
