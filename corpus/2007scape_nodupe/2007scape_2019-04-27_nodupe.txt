Who cares, it requires a shit ton of money and you need more than just one runner to achieve 200k rc xp/hr.

It's about sending a message to the illegal bone smugglers using the wilderness.

You‚Äôre just proving my point now by saying it‚Äôs the ‚Äúgold standard of absolute dumpster fire‚Äù if you can get past your own bias you will realize you‚Äôre just contributing in your own circle jerk. I know this is going to get downvoted but you all can go fuck your self righteous selves.

---
Can you do most high level content on mobile? My pc recently broke
---
It wouldn't be very viable for anywhere outside of PoH. Close proximity to spec pool is what makes this method. You could still do it in wildy or clan wars, but those spec restore trips + resetting alts would be a pretty big pain and reduce xp/hr significantly.
---
I got banned for TD for explaining that the holocaust happened because of beliefs that one race was inferior than the other. 
---

---
The post I commented on claimed that the holocaust happened of gun regulations. 
---
TD and politics are both pointless echo chambers that everyone should avoid.
---
So right now the bis for pures are regen/combat/mith gloves. If you could not get exp from quests, you could then get barrows gloves, which would be a pretty big step I think. 
---
Right now if you are 1Pray, you can't get Ava's. If you want Ava's you need a min of 15 pray, so that is also a new BIS for pures.
---
I'm sure there are some other ones too.
---
+1 for this

I flipped so many of them when they released. That was fun

Hello sir. I greatly disagree. Have a nice day.

Man I hope this is a joke.

I see

Someone in my Rs3 clan actively does speedruns as described above, and I was even apart of one of those runs. He was disappointed when someone crafted runes because he that didn't get the guy a "leech" status, voiding his run. So,
---
"Ahahahahahahha"?
---
This is a honest argument to someone who said that dung is was not a skill and just a mini game. Who cares, it was fun as fuck.
---
Specing his alts with chally which does area damage and then getting spec. Basically gives insane xp/hr for melee. Think of it has chinning or barraging but for melee and much easier with zero costs except your time.
---
Instead of typing "how do I deiron" into the title, try typing it into Google.

---
I always hop if I get crashed, arguing is entirely pointless and I'm not going to waste my time engaging in petty acts of disruption.
---
I don't, however, understand why people crash. I can almost always find an empty world in seconds. Surely it's more efficient to hop a few worlds to find an empty world than risk an argument and potential disruption?
---
If people enjoy getting a reaction out of others that's fair enough but in most cases crashing doesn't seem all that worth it.
---
Generally speaking, they like to avoid designing content that's in RS3 because you can play it in RS3.
---
It‚Äôs not about heating power...it‚Äôs about ventilation.
---
I don't really mind the concept of ess runners in general, it's only a problem with zmi because zmi gives 2x exp per ess compared to other altars. Zmi running never existed in pre eoc due to there being no free trade. Essence runners at the nature altar for example were never a problem, since the max xp rates cap out similarly to lava runecrafting. Zmi runners are uniquely bad because they've only been viable now, unlike nature/law runners which have been around forever.
---
the weak should fear the strong
---
No one is stopping you from stepping up your game and matching my 6 man alt army. Step up or shut up. I do the work required to maintain them, you aren't willing too and instead bitch to Mommy and Daddy about how it's unfair that I'm willing to be a sweatier nerd than _you_. How narcicistic can you get to tell me It's MY problem?
---
The only way I see myself playing again is starting over 100%. I just can‚Äôt see myself grinding for all that stuff all over again. I am probably just gonna take a break for a while and see what‚Äôs up. Idk man. That is why I kind of want to get rid of everything, a total loss can be better than a partial one.
---
No and tbh the only ones you do get loot off of have become scarce. 
---
Noted bones used to be an actual method but then some big brain figured out you can just single inventory and suicide with black dhide and bank in PvP worlds at spawn. 
---
You can usually do an entire inventory of bones on the altar while getting PK‚Äôd if anyone ever even touches you. 
---
It‚Äôs just not a good spot anymore. If someone gets PK‚Äôd then next round of bones on the altar breaks them even. So they don‚Äôt really feel risk doing single inventory and world hopping. 
---
It‚Äôs a really big waste of time. You can potentially get 20k off someone on their way to the altar but it‚Äôs like.... idk why bother.
---
afaik at 85 range youll never be better off using void with a bp. at like 88 or 89 onwards, void has 2  max hits over dhide in which case you'd use it.
---
this is just off the top of my head though. on mobile or id calc myself.
---
What do you not like about T\_D? Other than the fact that everyone says its bad, or that you disagree with Trump
---
Aight thanks
---
It's a minigame Jamflex didn't want to die.
---
Dunepneering is still the same game, slightly different as I remember the combat triangle being a major part of fast runs. You would need to craft runes to even have a chance to hit those warriors. Not you just need a 2 hander
---
Hackers: writes bday down.   
---
;)
---
I did it with 70 range and a rune c‚Äôbow and void (because I‚Äôm broke) and beat him my first try. I feel like the rune dragon was harder.
---
Any news on what skills will be used for it?
---
That's highest I've seen tbh
---
That time was so much fun
---
It was the most realistic, nobody really knew the best way to get the best items in the world
---
‚ôªÔ∏è
---
Pretty much, trade me in a safe zone.  Then my character started running backwards and get killed at the doorway. I didn‚Äôt know something like that could happen. I thought I was safe.
---
Dungeoneering is the only thing I ever decide to play rs3 for. If it was in old school I could finally ditch that shitshow for good.
---
Who's blaming the current 2007 game?
---
&gt; The power is in the hands of the people that want to leech
---
Definitely not. I'd suggest you just go into "free leech" fc and check it out yourself. It's almost always near full, but doesn't always have even 1 person actually carrying.
---
This really isn't something up for debate, you can just go look for yourself :p
---
No support. 
---
I don‚Äôt want baby gmaulers to have access to Anchor, or worse, barrows gloves+.
---
Also don‚Äôt want 1 prayer Ancients.

So if you scribble over Warding and put Smithing...

You already have Dungeoneering in the game, it's called CoX.

Pelvic. Thrust.

Something about it just. Even the words.

Thrust.

Things gonna have a big ol' gash then.
---
missing anything?
---
It was pre eoc so like the rsHD era
---
to be frank idk what really funny means

XP rate is way too high for the skill. The cash is a deterrent to the vast majority, of which hate RCing anyway, but alts are just as meta.

Yeah.. I mean I thought that the reason they gave exp is because this was intentionally a viable training method.. apparently they overlooked what we've all known forever..
---
&gt; Just is just uninformed
---
Ah yes, the cunning strategy of calling them an idiot by proxy. Never sully your hand with a simple dismissal, oh no. Do it by proxy. It's only good politics afterall.
---
some day youre gonna look back at this 10m and realize how little it was. dw about it rebuilding is half the fun

Not true if you're pking at Revs, which is currently the most action packed/valuable place to pk.

It's osrs you can make anything sound like that

Anyway, how does one even propose fixing that? Making essence untradeable?
---
I prefer undermining my own exp rates to keep theirs trash too. If I can't have mine we will burn together in the garbage bin.
---
Alright, thank you so much! I got void yesterday and kinda wanna use it so I guess it‚Äôs time to get my range up before I start farming vork
---
Thank you for not being an idiot, I mean this sincerely. Far too often do we see reddit flooded with people bashing the other side. Be it the pvp community complaining about pvp polls and taking it out on the pvmers, or pvmers crying toxicity in an area where they knew the risk they took. 
---
I do however believe that the wilderness needs to be improved upon. Something to get people out and engaging with each other. fighting other players is fun and all, but I feel there should be some bigger picture put in place aside from simply doing it to get other people‚Äôs items. If there was some sort of pvp grind involved that would open up new pieces of content, I feel that you‚Äôd see a lot more pvmers learning how to fight other players. 
---
Player versus player skill rating, with certain resource areas locked behind rating would be neat. Though you‚Äôd likely just see clans running the show and turning it into some kind of extortion of average players.
---
Thanks for the silver!

Now you are the noob lol

1. Is there an unofficial black jacking world? When I was thieving on my main, I found it was 10 times easier with another person. I know there's an unofficial world of ardy knights.

2. Are there any other super early game teleports I should go for? I'm working on getting an Ardy cape, games necklace, dueling ring, spirit trees, completing the Zeah quests, getting ~40 magic, unlocking a bunch of minigame teleports and possibly fairy rings very early on. Running sucks.

3. Does a tome of fire work as a fire staff if it's not charged with burnt pages? I got one from Wintertodt, but I only have 100 pages and I don't plan to farm more.

Can y'all just shut up and let a skill pass. They basically said if this doesn't pass they are gonna give up because you autistic fucks don't like change.  If you don't use the skill that's fine but someone else would have a new experience that could turn the game around for em. And yes they litteraly said something along the lines of they will try alot less on new skill ideas since it seems to be a waste of time and money

Yes

Wish pvpers got updates, pkers should get bent
---
I quit around the time dungeoneering released but from what i remember it was fairly enjoyable, i'd like to see the concept return in some form, it doesn't have to be a skill but it needs some form of progression
---
I feel like most people play runescape for the addicting feeling of progression that the game provides so if you're playing a minigame that's not helping you progress in terms of gear or skills then its not as enjoyable and most people won't bother with it
---
I can't really remember what the skill actually gave you but i'd be open to having it as a skill but i think rather jagex should look at overhauling minigames with some kind of ranking or progression system that feels meaningful because that would reinvigorate alot of content

From the angle of the spade under the clue scroll I can deduce with 100% certainty that your account is somewhere in Runescape. Runescape. Run Escape. You have to run to escape from a pker in the wilderness. Bear Grylls survives in the wilderness. Bear Grylls is named after bears. Bears are near the picnic tables outside of Ardougne. You eat sandwiches at picnics. The sandwich lady gives away sandwiches. The sandwich lady is a lady. You know who else is a lady? The Lady of the Lake. The Lady of the Lake gives you Excalibur if you give her a piece of bread. Bread is made from a bucket of water and a pot of flour. To make flour you need a pot. Pots are 1 gp at general stores. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! Pots also require level 1 crafting to make.

You are on clue step 1.

HACKING TIME BOIZ!

Fanfare is fuckin dope/10, i'd boogie so hard to that banger after a couple of points of MD

Your argument kinda sucks though unless you want to call most of the skills in runescape boring. Mining is clicking on different rocks, fishing is clicking on water, woodcutting is clicking on trees, prayer is clicking on bones, etc.
---
*Shit!*
---
Cheers for the advice guys, I'll see if I can find more info to help me get it back. Hopefully I can!

pvm is easy, just basic patterns. In pvp if your not running a pure, your gonna have a bad time

The account you're replying to is one of them

Bruh u aint got no sense without not never say shit about not nothing bruh

btw

I was bursting nechs one time when I started hearing a weird extra noise every cast. It took me a couple seconds to realize that someone else had showed up, and was casting ice burst on the stack I had gathered in my corner. I was manually casting with a staff of the dead (I'm too poor for a kodai wand), so I couldn't type out to ask what he was doing, and he ended up hopping as the last of the stack died. I wish I had stopped casting for a second so I could have asked him what he thought he was accomplishing.
---
&gt; I'm not even going to bother argue when you said that new bis weapons have replaced dscim/whip.

clearly you haven't been reading as i never said they replaced them.

lmao someones mad that their white knighting didnt get them no jmod pussy üòÇ
---
That's fair enough but I wasn't necessarily defining these kinds of movies as the epitome of good writing either. In my opinion a fair few of the movies in the MCU, despite being a means of making profit at it's very core, are actually fairly well written, at least in terms of humour and character development. The Winter Soldier still remains as one of the best superhero movies in my eyes. But I think I understand the original point you were getting at
---
My brain melted halfway through, thanks Jagex
---
What was stopping them before? If you for example saw 1000 votes for something in what way could you confirm 1000 players voted?
---
you can probably afk everywhere but there are only certain locations for cannon. I'm not saying people should be dicks with cannons but sometimes the people afking that refuse to go over 1 room so someone can cannon are more of a dick.

Will Spanish RS ever come back?

I need to practice my spanish learning the only way I know how

I wouldn‚Äôt mind a mid level raids with decent uniques

OK I'm sorry :(
---
I don't flick. Afking is worth 500k gp/hr lol.
---
That is the worst argument ive ever heard you just trivialized rc to make mining sound better. The exact reverse could be said.
---
Rc does have varied training. Between dark essence crafting, arceuus library,  zmi which is kinda like mlm for rc tbh) and lavas.
---
Minings only options for training are breaking rocks with a pickaxe. 
---
Gtfo with this shit
---
Your comparing Coors light to a Belgian ale.
---
For me, it was starting fresh on a very chill area where you could spend a little time making your character using the skills you have, leading up to a very chill boss fight. It was always random *enough* and had a very relaxed feel to it. I could do it at low-mid level solo.
---
Raids is fairly end game content that you need very high skills to do successfully with a team, and even then, you need to pretty thoroughly learn it. It's mostly a boss battle that has no chill whatsoever.
---
i don't really think you're beneath me, i don't really care about you either way so try not to take it personally, we're just different, no better or worse.
---
feel free to split them up into as many sub factions as you want. at the end of the day, the president picked a side that also included nazis and white nationalists. if he felt it was worth it to attack ANTIFA, thats his decision. Personally (and again this is only my opinion) i don't think the ANTIFA guys are nearly as dangerous as the right wing extremists. After all they did, you know, murdered someone at this event.
---
using the entire obby armour set + weapon and necklace is better dps vs low def targets than max str gear

Pretty sure /r/politics is a bubble for streamlined propaganda

There's also Brimhaven agility tickets and PC points, they're just not popular cause efficiency.

Looks like you still haven‚Äôt quite got it.

I'm just surprised these things weren't capped to 9 targets total.

I like when people are just sitting there reeeeeee-ing or running over to the other side, and I just have a potion in my inventory that I'm waiting to use until I'm ready to head back over to the brazier. Get your own potions and stop complaining, people.

Okay so I'm a huge noob so I've been camping blue dragons for some afk range XP and a little GP, but what are some other good things to kill for a profit? My range level is 61. I'd like to be able to safespot as I don't want to stop paying attention and die.
---
The minecraft sub might need some of these: ü¶Ä
---
Opposite for me with those two games hahaha
---
No need to grind a low level boss, I‚Äôd suggest aiming for your BIS melee first and grinding out some slayer levels to make the money for your other combat stats. Maybe put some money into a cannon and cannonballs for better slayer exp.  Once you hit 75 slayer the gp/hr really starts to pick up
---
I second this but nmz on mobile instead

Someone dies in endgame.

You just convinced me to leave west side and go east side instead.

Also the snowfall can still hit you in the corner, it's just 3 times less likely because there is only one possible spot where the snowfall can hit you, while every other spot has two or three different possible ways that the snow can hit you.

There was never going to be backlash for HD itself as a toggle, what people don't want is for Jagex to have to double the art time to make regular and HD models for everything. But if a third-party handles the OSHD part while Jagex only has to work on the standard stuff, then there are literally no downsides.
---
Yeah, just imagine all the spades you could get in the same amount of time.
---
So just a reskin of divination
---
&gt;If you want to play dungeoneering you can still play it in RS3
---
That's the biggest joke I've heard. 2019 DG is absolute dog shit when compared to 2010/2011 DG. It's ridiculously and requires so much less skill now.
---
Agility is just RuneCrafting without profit
---
Lets just agree that he's an idiot who thinks jamflex created "pestle and mortar"
---
Then put some more time in and make a mechanic that ISNT based around repeating the same floor or repeating your past floors. Hell add 3 randomly picked key floors that you need to run for keys in order to keep running the highest floor. Add a reward for obtaining the keys in addition to being able to run the highest floor. Boom solved and I spent a half assed 30 seconds thinking that out, imagine what a paid dev team could come up with.

---
I want the good old days of waiting 30 seconds to world hop back
---
Every rock has a different feel to it, though. By the standards of non-combat skills it's relatively diverse. If not for its ridiculously low experience rates, Runecraft would honestly be one of the better skills simply because of how many options you have depending on what you want between profit, safety, AFK-ability, repetition, or if you're just going for the pet. 
---
Most other non-combat skills are lucky to have one good AFK option, one good turbonerd tick-manipulation option, and one option that makes money, and at like half of them no matter what you're just standing at a bank processing crap or clicking the same options every few seconds. 
---
Funny enough Mining and Agility also have a number of options but feel like shit anyway due to generally low rates.
---
The openable doors are lighter in color than the non-openable doors.
---
Yeah but agility is really afk and I don‚Äôt have to use AHK when banking to feel efficient
---
Cmon please help me Dr. Dikk
---
Support.  People who use 3rd party tools to DDoS have an unfair advantage, so it should be a feature in the main game.
---
I think it should use Wrath and Death runes, cuz it makes people angery and also dead.  This would also make Runecraft more profitable.
---
Dude same. 90+ all combat stats 85slayer literally never pray flicked a task in my life. Never will . Lmao
---
Yeah I‚Äôd like to see the bosses require better gear and offset that risk by really buffing up the gp/hr on the wildy bosses and location.
---
Probably still pretty close. You still have eagle eye. Zulrahs a lot more annoying than vork too. With vork you can atleast zone out.
---
What's the weapon and how over priced is it at the ge?
---
LMAOOOO
---
Keep talking about shit you know nothing about, clearly you‚Äôre deeply attached to that activity
---
Smithing, runecrafting, crafting in some cases. Slayer is that but with killing things in the middle. The skill doesn't have to be fun for it to be a good part of the game.
---
Do you even EoC pvm? How does EoC not make the game fun? OSRS pvming is entirely dependant on boss mechanics to make its combat experience fun while RS3 relies on both boss mechanics as well as abilities to make it fun. Why don't you git gud at EoC before bashing it.

Yes, although Jagex didn‚Äôt really ‚Äòsell‚Äô it to us like that.

If you win, can I have 10m

If DG was a skill people would have done it for the rewards for 10-20 hours and never went back. Thank fuck the best skill in the game wasn't turned into some shit minigame.
---
Doesn't work in dungeons seems like. Picking a less crowded world only means it's crowded less on the surface. The dungeons are still crowded and I often spend 20 minutes trying to find a world with less players. Also, if you are switching often be prepared to get logged out and also wait some time.before the game allows you to switch. After 5 switches the game won't allow you to switch instantly.
---
Gl my dude!
---
Vorkath is the easiest because there‚Äôs no switching involved. Zulrah I can only manage using void because less switches but I‚Äôd imagine it being easier if I had a twisted bow

Gay.

20 times isn‚Äôt so bad.

I‚Äôve don‚Äôt around 1k chests, with mory hard got a free around high 800‚Äôs
---
They‚Äôd have to make the gp/hr worth it on the bosses you‚Äôre killing. If you‚Äôre able to farm the boss for 45 minutes but die once an hour and still turn a profit. It‚Äôs a win-win.
---
Better yet, if using ranged the hill giants always throw the text ‚ÄúOw! My nether regions!‚Äù With each missile.
---
Konar is only efficient for hydra, but I guess it forces noobs into locations that aren‚Äôt ideal
---
I'd probably do the latter and use the money you make from it to gear up for more efficient Vork runs
---
Lol what? Lose your logs or what?
---
This is all a load of shit. Melee is find. Rapier will destroy them. You can wear the gear. These people are drongos.
---
T_D bans anyone who is the least bit critical of the current administration. How is that my own bias? Is that not a problem to you?
---
Why where you skilling on a PvP world?
---
@wyattR115 be petty.
---
When people crash one of my alts afk9ng ogresses.
---
 
---
Step 1 :I drop everything I'm doing on my main, hcim, and go to my crashed alts spot and hold down every spawn.
---
It's about sending a message to these dudes who think they are alpha as shit.
---
But in all actuality cave dwelling neckbeards.
---
Step 2 For bonus points if they really pissed you off, hope with them and proceed to do step 1 again
---
Lmao your the epitome of petty.
---
Twitter.
---
For me that‚Äôs bossing. I know the bosses are repetitive but getting unique drops is not. I play simply to get gear upgrades via bossing (btw)
---
I read it, and I think that's how RS3 does it. My reply was to reiterate that it is an important area for concern as the current solution is awful.
---
Amateur.. Doesn't even have a toilet built into his chair for shitting without losing game ticks. 6/10
---
sit kid
---
Imagine logging into rs3
---
Id stay out of spite. Wasting 5 peoples time just for me is a big worth for my spiteful ass
---
I did it with similar stats to you (higher range I think) and after failing a bunch of times on the last boss I realized I was using ruby bolts. Not ruby bolts (e)... felt bad
---
The TV is cheap but how can you tell about the monitor, PC, desk and chair? Still, no way it's worth $5000 lol.
---
He's got a gaping whip wound in his chest obviously
---
What‚Äôs your resolution you‚Äôre playing in, monitors resolution and in the display settings what‚Äôs your scaling percentage?
---
oh that must get exhausting spam clicking things in your inventory...
---
i went all in on woodcutting. had to flex on the bots and fellow woodcutters
---
"losing 7 logs is interesting, so people should totally lose their 500m gear if they DC lol"
---
-this guy
---
Pls paint me!
---
I don't think it's really something the community in general wants. Any significant changes they might try to make to get pvm to have more risk involved in it probably wouldn't pass a poll
---
*gets cape then runs to bank and gets random items* haha yup that‚Äôll do now reddit will be confused haha XD!
---
If this means I don't have to do barbarian assault and shit ever again it may be worth it.
---
cannons are fucking stupid and shouldnt be in the game
---
Think of all the xp lost due to people arguing about politics in a osrs thread.
---
&gt; get melee based which would take
---
Where's the link to the video if you have one?
---
Weird that I see ironmen say this all the time, only to get super excited about someone telling them where a d imp is. Or getting a good raids 2 team.
---
What's your proof that i am attempting to "hide behind something"? I simply thought it was an unpopular opinion, you made a baseless assumption.
---
Oh and that was why I never got dark beasts in like 100 tasks
---
Where did Biden massage their grandaughter's chest?
---
It has to do with the way the peg boards are designed. Did what I could with what I had.
---
Yeah.....Kinda Is. but you can jump to the inventory by pressing down and if you hold it the mouse speed reduces greatly. It's not perfect but its I little more accurate.
---
Faster slayer task if u cba bursting them.
---
Not to mention catacombs will give you totem piece. And skotizo is basically free money.
---
Deviant Spectres in the Catacombs of Kourend, he also died probably because he ran out of prayer.
---
You're right because if someone says "Unpopular opinion: Black people are terrible" that's gonna shield anyone from downvotes, fantastic logic.
---
take precaution if you think you will DC... its not that common. 99% of your deaths are probably your fault
---
Even more fun if they're an Ironman since they won't be able to pick up any drops
---
"Relatively low"
---
Needs high level slayer.
---
Dungeoneering is a skill which actually requires, y‚Äôknow, skill.
---
It‚Äôs also as much a skill as slayer is.
---
They've mentioned in Q&amp;As that they're working on something, but we have pretty much no details on how it works or when it's happening.  
---
The current reclaims at Vorkath, etc don't seem like much, but it's a pretty effective gold sink if you see the data on how much money it removes from the game.
---
You also don't want the prices to be too high, because removing too much gold can also have a bad impact on the economy, so it's a fine line between creating risk and making too much of a gold sink.
---
My name's CowCrasher69 &amp; I'M HERE TO FUCK YO WIFE
---
Wow thanks for making me feel fucking old...
---
Meanwhile in rs3 dungeoneering broke the whole with its weapons and rapidly became a dead skill that players paid millions for people to afk in the dungeons to get levels...
---
also the game is made for all the players, not just the guys dying and losing while wearing 500m worth of gear. I think it would make bossing and slayer more fun if dying meant something
---
I'm playing on a 4k native monitor. The scaling is at 100%
---
Yeah; I can't deny that the last time I got crashed at ammonite crabs I put on my best gear and made sure to only attack the mobs the crasher was attacking.
---
It‚Äôs an equal trade.
---
I'm just thinking would I use it for fetching darts? Or doing any other such motions in the inventory that require me to click 2 slots really quickly for like an hour.
---
Probably a program.
---
Literally the only times I die are DCs.  If death were as punishing as 2007 my precaution would just be not spending 100m to have 5 more strength bonus than 5m budget gear.
---
tbh I dunno why that cannon even in the game. I know people love it, but it doesn't fit at all
---
Try setting the scaling to 150% in the windows display settings and then restarting runelite
---
Already answered the same claim, no i do not respond to everyone with toxicity, i only respond in toxicity to those who instigate it to begin with, if someone's willing to be respectful i do the same, check my entire comment history if you want, stop trying to construct another strawman to encourage blind dogpiling, i know you may not be doing it intentionally but it's seriously inconsiderate to do to people.
---
Free range xp lol
---
Just to enjoy a quiet bank. (150 player in the whole server)
---
I'd love to sell them!
---
now messaging me on multiple accounts, projecting his insecurities about being a fat virgin nerdüòÇ the kid who ddosed me is calling ME a fat virgin nerd. what a joke of a life this kid must be living
---
You're not wrong, but man, I just want a quality skill in OSRS that isn't attempting to take on the whole world of game fixes by itself. Warding is just way too bloated. Spread some of its content onto other skills, and make Warding feel like it's own thing. Not dungeoneering, and certainly not summoning 2.0 (which is what it is now.)
---
In multicombat, the loot should be shown to the whole clanchat or something
---
379 people disagree.
---
Yo dawg, I chucked all my bank a few nights ago. Wanna bank roll me 1m so I can box it and double it, than triple it, than quad it? Lets do this thing PM me
---
Fair
---
That is pretty easy to do on low pop worlds but on high pop worlds when you're trying to actually talk to someone legitimate most of the time it is pretty annoying to have to scroll up.
---
If you‚Äôre struggling ruby bolts are necessary.  You‚Äôll be hitting him for 100s with the spec, a bit of your health is worth it
---
389 people disagree.

This guy ~~fucks~~ wins all the arguments at recess.

That‚Äôs the point . Get you on edge and leave you wondering. Mans doing gods work. Probably made you search this up , presumably a video from a nature channel. Wasting your time just to find out the Beetle in fact did ___?___  get it  out.
---
Found a beggar
---
2mil in 7days? No problem at your hunter level. Ecclectic implings at puro puro, use snare, and make sure you're using runelite so you can see the spawn points. You'll get 500k+ an hour easy
---
So much more satisfying to totally defeat their initiative. I turn public off and have a damn cheery time. I turn it back on after they hop and enjoy the salt, it's incredible.
---
Equating level of success to what people choose to waste their time on in a game while you're wasting your time doing something else "efficiently" in said game. You're gonna go far.
---
Dont think so
---
Imagine being a cunt for liking a game you dont like. Close minded imbecile.
---
If they got past the authenticator in the first place to turn it off, it was defeated. What kind of logic is that, there should not be a delay.
---
Your right, but you're still an asshole.

---
Why do I get angry?
---
Feelings of anger arise due to how we interpret and react to certain situations. Everyone has their own triggers for what makes them angry, but some common ones include situations in which we feel:
---
threatened or attacked    
---
frustrated or powerless    
---
like we're being invalidated or treated unfairly    
---
like people are not respecting our feelings or possessions  
---
  
---
People can interpret situations differently, so a situation that makes you feel very angry may not make someone else feel angry at all (for example, other reactions could include annoyance, hurt or amusement). But just because we can interpret things differently, it doesn't mean that you're interpreting things 'wrong' if you get angry.
---
How you interpret and react to a situation can depend on lots of factors in your life, including:
---
your childhood and upbringing   
---
past experiences
---
current circumstances
---
Whether your anger is about something that happened in the past or something that's going on right now, thinking about how and why we interpret and react to situations can help us learn how to cope with our emotions better. It can also help us find productive strategies to handle our anger.
---
Who cares, you're going to die eventually anyway lol, especially in the endgame.
---
13 prayer tbh, most viable currently, i'll make a showcase video of all the obby builds though, and what they can do
---
for why? all it would really do is let you pick one more crop, and possibly get some pussys wet when in combat.
---
Yeah that's the difference.  If someone crashes me and says the cannon spots are all full, I don't mind.  If he comes running up and plops the cannon right down that's being a dick.  At least try to find another world.
---
Something like kalphite workers, I do them for the easy points.  Half the world's are empty and theres multiple rooms.  Still get crashed there occasionally by assholes.
---
Imagine a real OSRS player voting for some shit like warding.
---
Can you Eli5 what this means please?
---
At 2.2b
---
imagine being beta enough to think that anything you do in runescape is alpha
---
I legit had that happen while I was doing cave horrors, I was like fuck off!
---
Dam some black dude definitely fucked ur moms inside out or ur sister.
---
Love this idea, wouldn‚Äôt stop farmers like ya said, but will definitely help
---
Honestly you‚Äôre right on track with it. I suggest getting a higher prayer level to minimize the prayer pot usage. I‚Äôm 71 prayer and only have to use a prayer pot if Karils or ahrims end up in my tunnel.
---
What's my name? Dunkachino! You know me, I'm your friend, say hello to my chocolate blend?!
---
Baby maulers should be the absolute min level to get emblems
---
I think you've *become* the cave horror
---
Damn nice though.
---
If you can get your fossil island trees going do that too. They're a nice exp drop every few days. There's three spots right near the boats and every I think 4 days you'll get 47k exp from the three. On top of your normal runs it's a nice and pretty cheap exp boost.
---
Some people do
---
Those aren‚Äôt real sharks, just a piece of paper with a picture of a shark on it so you‚Äôll be good

*why*

You're unaware it seems.

I've seen 3 tbows this month! Two in my name first was at 280kc and second at 302kc. Just saw the third at 416 kc in my friends name. Sometimes crazy luck

Imagine actually watering your crops

Good thing account sharing isn't banable.

When your account gets recovered.....we'll know who did it....

F2P just got a fairly large expansion in the form of beginner clues. One spell is pretty tiny compared to that.
---
It's not the first F2P expansion either. Last Man Standing and Ironman mode are both F2P. The Corsair Cove is a free to play skilling area released in 2017. They were even planning to make some of Zeah F2P, although that never happened.
---
Everything I just mentioned was added to OSRS and didn't exist when it first launched. It's all new content.
---
I leveled dung to 80, got my rapier, and got the fuck out.
---
It's a she mate.
---
That xp/hr is incorrect, sometimes if I wait too long to check my phone, or if I lose aggro and my char is just standing around, the xp/hr rate on runelite drops off hard.
---
You‚Äôre such a virgin lmfao.
---
Btw for future use god dhide over karil
---
Sorry.
---
Fight is cancer, rote memorization of places to stand per phase, it's a bullshit boss fight.
---
And has since added plenty of new free to play content. Corsair Cove, beginner clues, last man standing, ironman mode...
---
Wonder if high horse is his rsn
---
That's called rape
---
This is glorious
---
Send one to woox, see if he can do infernal with it.
---
Usually sellers are punished a lot harder than buyers
---
It's kinda lame d hatchets crashed so hard
---
I thought puggin had the most kc. Gz fella!
---
Granted, but you have to pay to use F2P content. You can use dragon equipment, but you have to pay to use air runes or visit Lumbridge.
---
You say you should lose all your items because it's an MMORPG, yet no other MMORPG follows this idea. Do you know why that's the case? Because it's a shit idea.
---
That looks worse than their individual variants. Literally looks like someone spilled mustard on it by accident
---
I don't know who's arguing against that
---
&gt; You mean like every enemy in this game? Wowie.
---
t. lvl 45 slayer
---
Yeah honestly diaries are so retarded.
---
They are a negative for literally everyone. Casual players are locked out of potentially fun content behind huge skill barriers, non-skillers are locked out of efficient content without huge grinds, and skillers get their skills changed because the previous 2 groups don't like training the skill.
---
Rote memorization does not equal skill
---
Any others off the top of your head? Invention is the obvious one but stacking 479k of BXP would take me forever with my 2 daily keys even with 99 inv lol and I just want to see a mil drop.
---
I'm maxed combat at this point. I think i got like 100cb-115 or something like that.
---
Oh I bet you already do ~.~
---
No Russian
---
I have a 6S+ and mobile doesn‚Äôt destroy my battery.
---
Exactly! Legit the definition of a neck beard
---
I came across someone else who didn't know earlier today, so in case you don't as well, you have a whole hour to go back to get your items on the same world after you die. It's not a minute anymore. Dying every once in a while isn't that bad if it means a substantially better training area
---
Higher requirements, so it takes longer to make and has higher chances of being banned before it's done. 
---
And when the account gets banned you lose so much more.
---
How do you not log out?
---
I use a pen stylus I can clip in the same pocket as my phone. Doesn't really help tbh. I just grind when I'm out and bored.

Give chaps a defense requirement and make void convert to gold or at least break in pvp.

honestly, look for yourself... if you really think the little bit of accuracy and the +4 damage if game breaking well, the game is already broken for you then.
---
Wahhh I can't be homophobic.
---
Also get good, scrub. The people crashing you are better than you, so deal with it and hop.
---
\&gt;  The difference is one is a fringe sub for Trump supporters and the other is the general politics sub lol 
---
I'm not sure what point you are making. T\_D is by far the most active conservative subreddit. 800k followed / subscribed to the subreddit compared to 80k\~ in /r/republicans It is The defacto conservative subreddit.
---
I'm not going to compare politics subscribers vs T\_D because Politics was a default for awhile until they removed the auto subscribing/following for new reddit accounts. The numbers are heavily inflated.
---
Only one I‚Äôve played, might have been the reason.  But I guess it‚Äôs just a best in slot game now
---
As this is definitely not a benefit to Ironmen, Accept Aid being off will not prevent the disconnect.
---
Big support.
---
Got a master clue yesterday.  2nd step, talk to Sherlock.  Ohfuck.png.  Sherlock wants me to rock full graceful and do Relleka Agility course.  I don't even have full graceful!
---
Go play a classic private server instead. 
---
If you're truly against easyscape, that is.
---
Fuck people who kill monsters in popular cannon spots when alternatives exist. It's hard enough to compete with other cannoners. And to be totally fair, just buy a cannon. They aren't expensive and they save a ton of time.
---
The guy above me, his name is megafaggotron, said b&amp;r and idk what it means
---
Should move them out of the wildy instead :)
---
tbh the main reason i recognize it is because its similar enough to likejaxirl (username of one of my friends) that it caught my eye a few times on the subreddit
---
yes
---
Not my proudest fap.
---
Today I learned
---
Whats homophobic about quoting?
---
Is it racist if I read Tom Sawyer aloud?
---
Context buddy.
---
Ok ty
---
Yeah, but Jagex can thank themselves for that.
---
Or grab full DH and a rock cake incase someone decides to crash crabs.
---
After I receive all three pieces, do I assemble the totem? After this will i receive more drops?
---
The sacrifice is that it can be impractical in certain scenarios and super difficult to master, not to mention click intensive. Anyone can set up this training method provided they've got enough resources. 
---
One exploit is play to win, the other is pay to win.
---
But was it worth 600mil
---
The only reason I recognize the player name Cave Horror is because I watched him act like a tool in game to try and impress a girl player I knew and was a dick to other players
---
why are we treating t7 gear like its the best the game is ever going to have and it cant be devalued?  Also niche uses value is only tied to the outcome of gold you can get from said item (if we didnt have vorkath and rune dragons shitting out gold, the dragon hunter lance and crossbow would not be worth 100m+).
---
Ngl I want this really bad. Maybe even a runelite plug-in. Whether it‚Äôs meeting new people or being toxic as fuck, I will enjoy it. Don‚Äôt like it? You can just turn it off
---
Yep, i had a quest cape before D slayer 2 come out, i also just noticed i've unlocked the thing to make gargoyles a bigger task. I wonder if getting that before I ever got them assigned has bugged it
---
I‚Äôve been using a steam controller for a while now and it works great
---
Scim :)
---
Can you elaborate
---
That's not gatekeeping?
---
I cannot post a direct link, since those comments are getting shadowbanned. You can find the full application on Github (/bartvdbraak/slayweightcalc/)
---
That's what I thought too
---
Dude me fucking too I'm all like "ok cool guess we can share xp then :))) sharing is caring!!" i try to be such an obnoxious twat they leave
---
I'm very interested to look at it, please post it!! :)
---
Why not?
---
The problem is how much xp the zmi altar gives per ess and how fast you can craft. Any other altar in the game with theoretically infinite runners wouldn't even give half of what zmi gives. The cost doesn't really matter, maxing with spins is expensive but people still do it, it's literally the same argument. It's also important to remember that zmi running was never a thing, it was impossible to do pre eoc. Runners for all of the other altars in the game are balanced, zmi is uniquely broken and it's insane that Jagex is okay with an altar that gives near quadruple polled rates just because it's expensive..
---
I feel so bad for you guys that have never gotten to do barb assault with a group using voice chat
---
If you fund and source it I'm down to be a lab rat that would be some good gains
---
Shit
---
Ok
---
You're right, at least you get to taxi to the rock
---
Lmfao shhhhhlurp
---
I doubt that. It sounds like you‚Äôre just incredibly unlucky. Sorry!
---
tbh man things that motivates me to do vorkath is elite clues cuz it's quite random and u might get rng jesus drop lel last time i got frem kilt tho
---
Pros: looks cool
---
I haven't. I still don't remember having a good time with dung
---
I think it was the last thing I did post-wildy/free trade removal before quitting rs2/3 forever, for better or worse
---
wait wait you killed zulrah that many times and cant afford an anguish
---
Can put 3 runes in ammo slot on Rs3. Sorry I mean easy scape
---
dung wasn't fun until you got high level, low level was so tedious and horrible
---
I'm 81 slayer and have never had gargoyle task. I suspected this but thought it was unlikely, but just checked my log and I have 0 garg kills. What are the odds of never getting assigned them? I also noticed i've unlocked the thing to make the task bigger when I am assigned them, any chance that could have bugged it?
---
:(
---
There's a single player version of Runescape where you can play by yourself
---
It's called Runescape 3
---
Yeah, take it off
---
They know exactly what they want. They wanna complain

Couldn't the basic navigation be done just using a Steam Controller?
---
"KEEP MY 99 IN THIS DEAD, HATED SKILL SACRED!"
---
It sucks because I use the party world to hop around someone else's portals but slayer is apperently big on world 330.
---
Cuz it was kinda shite as a skill tbh 
---
I don't remember the vast majority enjoying it at all, this thread is just niche nostalgia
---
At the VERY LEAST, a portal leading to this fight in the next tournament world. It would be pretty similar to 6 jads.
---
How is a skill that normally costs a few mil to train to 99 costing 200-300mil not a gold sink? Do you not understand math?
---
They should just add voice chat, delete the GE, and disable trading anywhere besides w2 Varrock west bank.
---
I hope you got at least a blowie aswell
---
I have been farming vork in max gear for a while now and its getting very boring, would it be worth to switch to zulrah without a tbow but everything else BiS? Or should I just grind through this till I can get one? Never done zulrah past the hard diary
---
Hey avoid that highlighted 322 world bud... don't give out the secrets!

Don‚Äôt buy your account easy

do you watch twitch.tv by chance? if you load up twitch.tv and the oldschool section for example, just right now there are two phishing streams, one of them is a "tbow giveaway" from "flutton" the other is "boaty quitting"
---
Sounds awful
---
People wouldn‚Äôt need others for d imps because puro puro would be viable without bots.
---
I returned to the game when mobile came out and got quest cape and fire cape on my 100% mobile acc so yes
---
&gt; you probably got phished, lots of newish players do. phishing links are everywhere on twitch youtube facebook etc. if you reuse info for your email thatd be why you didnt get email notifications, whoever accessed your acc intercepted them.
---
I haven't affiliated my account information with any social media website, which is why I had suspicion with RuneLite. 
---
&gt;even if runelite was stealing your info they wouldnt be able to get thru your 2fa code without accessing your email or recovering your acc.
---
I'm willing to be called stupid or ignorant for not using a 2-factor authentication system. Never expected such a thing to happen. As I said, been playing since 2006 and I have never been account compromised throughout the years, ever.
---
Jagex can't win. If they release content that actually progresses the game and gives people more options, it *BrEakS thE MeTa*.
---
If they nerf it afterwards or play it safe on release, then it's just *dead content*.

True 2007-Scape would like to know your location.

Oy vey! Shut it down!
---
This is why people vote no to PvP polls.
---
What you said isn‚Äôt wrong but almost entirely unlikely and therefore completely irrelevant. When your sample size is that big, the only explanation for your average to be that much different than the statistical average is that the sample wasn‚Äôt taken properly. More likely in this case however, the collection log came out after he had lots of kills and black masks already.

I created my account and have been the sole owner of this account since its existence. It is registered to my personal email address.

Weed is degenerate and decreases productivity.

I don‚Äôt know what I did, but I‚Äôve done no moneymakers or intentional moneymakers but my bank is 17m.
---
Playing only 2 months also.
---
I‚Äôve done like 110 easy clue scrolls, about to get barrows gloves (175 qp)... got decent stats and went to wintertod as it can be very decent loot, done slayer aswell.
---
Farming aswell can be decent profit.
---
I watched a lot of YouTube videos and a lot of time on reddit and wiki.

So much more fun stuff to do.

I had a guy show up while me and another guy were killing kalphites and he plops down his fucking cannon in the middle of us and says "Stop being poor, just buy a cannon" like the reason we're fucking melee'ing the kalphites is because we can't afford the 1m for a cannon lol.
---
What is this superiority complex in the face of people asking for help? Clearly something happened, and clearly the people posting didn't have the proper security in place, but does that make you feel like a hero? I use my account name and password in Runelite only, my email wasn't accessed anywhere else. Thanks for the reply my guy!

I can't find the report anymore but rs3 seems to be still making more money than osrs. Though that might have changed with the release of mobile
---
Wait did you actually white out your quest cape in the equipment tab
---
U could. Its like 400k/h at mm2 tunnels. Good for range tanks. But theres no rush for 99 to not much point on spending the cash
---
Disable hardware acceleration on runelite.
---

---
Idk how much money you have but you could cannon at ogres to 75 pretty fast and just telegrab the seeds to make some money back. Could also do it at ice trolls if you have access to Neitiznot and pick up the drops to recoup a lot of the money. Wouldn't take long at all.

No, the comma is supposed to be a brief pause. When you say it like that it wouldn't make sense, it would read the same as if you put a comma after "your" in your own sentence.

Slight oversight maybe, but on the Konar tab, bosses are still included even if "Like a boss" is toggled off, or bosses are on the block list.
---
Is that like British afk
---
Good setup for semi afk nmz points?  
---
I want to be able to buy herb boxes everyday to pay for my training, and so it would be good if I could do a few hours of semi-afk nmz to support it. I'm at 77 atk, 70 str and 61 def currently, armed with obsidian armour and sword, d def and boots, zerker necklace and ring, barrows gloves, no fire cape yet. I'm just about to grind out lunar diplomacy and dream mentor so I'll have all bosses unlocked  
---
Which bosses should I be using? I'll be playing Rome Total War in another window and tabbing back in every 5 minutes to chug an overload and munch a rock cake, and top up my absorps at that time. I'll be keeping half an eye out for recurrent damage and zappers as well. Should I bother activating any of the range/mage bosses or will their constantly dragging me out of the middle harm my points?
---
I don't see that being the issue, I don't use this password anywhere/don't sign into shit like that. Oh well.

Favorite south park episode
---
This isn't even a bad idea, given that its off as default.
---
The game is completely different. Basically all old content is dead content for gp making outside of GWD. PVP is unbalanced as hell. Slayer is 3x as fast. GP/h for endgame content is regularly 3.5m+ gp/h, compared to 300k in 2007 and around 800k gp/h on OSRS release once the economy was stable. The inflation is ridiculous, we've gone from items capping at 20m gp to items capping at over a max stack. Most skills have had their meta's fundamentally changed. Over a third of the game area you can explore now didn't exist 10 years ago. 
---
OSRS isn't old school anymore. I took a 6 month break and came back to a game that's taken me another 2 weeks to relearn just from those changes.
---
This is inaccurate. Wheres the slayermusiq guide in the background

I was killing Giant Mole for already like 2 hours non-stop, and there hops a guy to my world with runite crossbow and tells me "Hop kid, I just banked." Can't out dps Dharok's.

How can you abuse a mechanic where on death your items are either picked up by yourself after a short timer or they disappear without anyone else having a chance of grabbing them?  If you didn't even read my suggestion then please don't respond.  I get that the OSRS community has aged but somehow become less mature, but come on man.

Maybe they mean more sentimental value

I was doing a bit of MLM the other day, I had been in the spot to the left of the entrance for about 4 hours. It's nice, since as a single person you *just* about clear it out, so you aren't wasting much and never have to wait.
---
The amount of people who turn up to that spot and start mining on top of you is insane. Within about 30 seconds it's empty. Then both of you are standing around waiting for the nodes to respawn. Those people don't leave either, oh no, they stand on top of you forever. Who wants to hop and be able to constantly mine when you can stand there and wait with someone else?
---
I always ask nicely, and out of about 15 crashers 4 responded. Two left, and two started complaining at me lol.
---
It's so dumb.

At low level grinds, you can try crafting Gold rings, Gold necklaces, Gold amulet (u), using the Edgeville furnace. Smelting Silver Ores into Silver bars is also ok. It's not amazing money or xp, but it is profitable and you can buy through GE.

I would honestly love this is they released a modding kit. Can you imagine the OSRS modding scene? That'd be awesome
---
Thicc support
---
The problem is that where one can pick a suitable level of a pvm challenge for themselves, this is not possible in pvp. One can either choose to kill kraken or do inferno, both contribute as ''pvm'', but pvp doesn't offer this sort of a possibility to better yourself, it's typically getting rammed up in the ass with all fingers by someone who has done that shit for years.

Well theres 2 whips so 2 x 50 = 100.

On a main I wouldn't block them, you can buy cannonballs and finish the task in 10-15 minutes for easy slayer points. The xp isn't bad either. Due to the low weighting there are far better tasks to block.
---
There are literally over 100 more viable alternate accounts you can make that don't take even half the time or resources 85 slayer does. If you don't hit the whip you're literally looking at 100k an hour before supplies used. It is a terrible alternate account and the people with that idea are the ones with their d boots(g) and d chain(g) taking all the damn spots so they can make 2.5m every 3 days. Ridiculous.

Exposure and ritual prevention. It's a highly efficacious psychotherapy for OCD. I'd recommend anyone with debilitating OCD try it out. It's generally considered the best treatment but it can be tricky to find a provider at times being that it's a "difficult" therapy for both the therapist and client.

You go into the Wild you should expect to die. You vote no to pvp updates because you go into the wilds not prepared to defend yourself or 3 item a clue. You go into the Wild expecting easy xp when the Wild was created for the sole purpose of a player killing another player. I have never pk‚Äôed in my entire runescape life which started in 2001 and I don‚Äôt think I ever will. If I learned how to by not being lazy I might go pking. All that being said quit complaining about a part of the game that in its creation helped bring a massive influx of players and is a key part of the osrs game life. It‚Äôs not something that caters to everyone just like pvm doesn‚Äôt cater to everyone and therefore you have folks left and right posting pics of liking jad after like 10 years, not knocking on them but using them as an example of how parts of this game isn‚Äôt to everyone‚Äôs desires of how this game should be.

---
Bp and dhcb are very close at hydra in terms of dps with bp being slightly better. I personally preferred dhcb because it‚Äôs simply easier to consistently never miss hits with all the running around, and using a bp only during the jad phase when you‚Äôre not moving + for the heal. Dhcb also gives the added bonus of a book offhand for a bit more prayer.

Yeah I get the occasional too. I suppose if you wanted you could. The mage cape would be way better to have for sure though. Your call, just a suggestion.

It just feels like with bossing there should be a little more punishment for death. I agree dks and GWD do it right with you‚Äôve gotta get kc. The long trip to get back so it‚Äôs not just a pointless death. 
---
If I die at vork I go oh man there‚Äôs goes 100k. A good gold sink but the boss is such a gold factory that‚Äôs only one or two kills. Or zulrah where they literally hand you your gear.

No way the best money makers should have nearly 0 death punishment. Those are where you should have the highest death punishments imo.

that world is weird as hell haha some dude started talking about how big my johnson was so i logged off lmfao
---
Prayer potions are 8500 gp
---
If I can only get 2, sometimes 3 kills per trip is it viable to use the teleports?
---
The reason for zulrah is because you lose hits not using a trident due to the attack speed I believe. But places like Kraken, it‚Äôs actually great.
---
You should be fine, it's fairly easy to escape at kdb, they have teleblock and then freeze lock you.    Turn player attack options off and never click on someone to box them.  Take a brew so you can box the spiders.
---
You can also turn protect item on before you teleport and turn it off once you pull the lever.  You are already wearing good armor and have food and ppots, you should be fine.

Yeah, completing all floors was laborious. Random required floors would also work, but it might feel unnecessarily random. A couple random floors of your top 3 themes sounds better. I like the 50% of floors thing even more as it provides a healthy amount of variance compared to camping your top theme. It'd be less fun to stick to only your top theme, too. C1s became the standard, but I think for xp per hr it was actually better to rush smalls for most of the lower floors. 100% completion to reset was way too much.

While there definitely have been some questionable updates and a fair amount of powercreep, it is nice to see how well OSRS has grown from its original state. It isn't perfect, but they've done a much better job at continuing from 2007 with the same style of updates than RS2. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/atnctn/osrs_vs_runescape_6_year_timeline_comparisons/) from the 6th Birthday does a good job comparing the two. Also, it looks like we are getting Prif a few months before RS2 (now RS3 by this point in the comparison) did. Chances are we'll also get Menaphos way sooner too.
---
&gt; people who use cannons are handsome, efficient chadscapers.
---
I agree.
---
I mean difficulty more in actually pulling off a kill, such as movement, switching and the likes. KQ requires minimal knowledge and is essentially just a tank and spank.
---
You can check in your Webbrowser at the ‚ÄòNetwork‚Äô section any outgoing server requests. It should all be handled locally on github. Feel free to dive into the code or ask any others :) You also don‚Äôt have to fill in any account specific information and they aren‚Äôt saved anywhere.
---
money/hour only matters over a larger sample size though, if you are just hitting a few kills then you don't spend enough time traveling for it to be a significant difference. if you are going back to back to back kills all afternoon, then yeah, you need to be teleporting
---
Oof
---
Most high level people can kill KBD easily, while Jad really isn't really that difficult, there's still a ton of people who completely struggle
---
Sure, but KQ is q very boring, 'simple' boss to kill in regards to mechanics. We may get less skills a trip, but its essentially a boss fight you almost AFK compared to any modern fight.
---
very sexy
---
Exactly ^_^
---
Thanks
---
Earth warriors is a very annoying champion scroll to go dry on lol. Hopefully you get it soon!
---
Some boring ones would be stuff like picking Mort Myre Fungi, making Tablets (host's house if needed), and the like. Some less boring ones would probably be Konar Slayer until you can get to stuff like Cave Horrors or such to farm for drops.
---
No, but going to Falador and trying to sell your barrows item in the park still took time because everyone there was merching you.
---
Lol go fuck yourself
---
Then this game is basically a flat screen version of Orbus.
---
can confirm i lost my cash stack in that fight
---
Because the game back then, all Skilling content and PvM was incredibly mechanically basic.
---
New to rs. Just wondering why this makes you a noob
---
So we're moving along with the natural motions of the sun again.
---
Same mate. Thank you &lt;3
---
PKing was a lot more fun before it was spec stacking someone who isn't paying attention or having to have like 5k APM to trib/tick eat/pot/spec stack all at once. Back when a team of someone barraging, someone msb speccing and someone dds speccing to whip was like the god tier of fucking people up.
---
My desk can rock 3 monitors and my PC and there is still room of to the side to bend your mum's ass over and ride it like I stole it, so I would say that it's highly likely your desk is lame.
---
10 hp oby mauler isnt a legit acc and the game should never cater to irons.
---
Legit I was so confused because I read it as construction.
---
Yes, it is fun killing people wo don't fight back. It's not really worth anymore to PK there for money, rarely anybody uses noted bones anymore.
---
no you're both wrong. 
---
r/woooosh
---
NANI?!?!?
---
Apparently you have no idea what that means either
---
Lol wont last long. But crashing black demons in 2019? Wtf?
---
I'm still at 1k KC with no uniques :p stay strong friend
---
Not sure what you're wooshing about my dude.
---
Your a low level player lol. High level is max total, med level is 126 combats. Low level is you.
---
What are you talking about? I created this code entirely by myself (you can check on Github every change I made) with the help of information found on the runescape wiki. Also, this calculator had literally nothing to do with ‚Äòskill calculators‚Äô if you have a look for yourself.
---
Bumsca
---
That was the most god awful censor attempt I ever saw.
---
That‚Äôs really sad honestly
---
There's nothing wrong with the product itself. Perfumes and bath oils are a thing. Just don't market them as some miracle cure that will deal with cancer and everything else.
---
Decent money maker
---
CAN I BORROW GP PLZ
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see the 99 def video in literally 2 days lol
---
I wouldn't expect someone like yourself who wasn't even born when runescape was first released to know.
---
Nonsense; letting players directly take real-money and turn it to gold is nothing remotely related to MTX!
---
Now those cosmetic non-benefiting overrides on RS3 however... **that** is MTX to be angry with.
---
I still have to find 30 hours of free time to run in a circle
---
Osrs hasn't felt like true 07 since ge was released, aka the very fucking beginning. You're fucking blinded by nostalgia. If anything, osrs right now is way closer to 2011 period than 2007.
---
Slay bodies
---
What's that about crabs being cancerous?
---
Probably farming
---
Instantly kills half the people in the wilderness
---
We're talking about clue completions though, the guy who killed 75k harpie bug swarms got hundreds of clues but only completed 4. This dude killed 88k cave horrors and completed 0.
---
An UIM in the top 25 of the high scores for prayer level (under the UIM section) is 10 hp.
---
99 magic by picking up rune spawns. 99 fletch, con, fm by picking up logs and planks. You could never kill anything. 99 prayer with bone spawns. You couldn't train other combat stats as you'd never hit. Barb fishing wouldn't be an option cuz you'd never catch anything. No gathering skill could be trained about 3 (tutorial island limit) cooking wouldn't work since you'd burn everything. Runecrafting would be trainable if you got ess (mining wouldn't work) also maybe Zeah library (I'm not very familiar how this works) thieving wouldn't work unless you could complete a quest that gave xp then did stalls to 99
---
A lot of people didn't get the memo apparently.
---
I dont  get it
---
The sun makes my screen way too hard to see. Fuck outside.
---
You think a guy who knows he‚Äôs being recorded in front of millions is gonna go for a titty grab on a child? C‚Äômon, a person that ballsy wouldn‚Äôt be in a political position. If it were true that he gets feelsy, it most certainly be of camera or unbeknownst to him that he‚Äôs being recorded.
---
Yes, new clue steps were added for all tiers of clue scrolls (not just med). This was a recent update, only like two weeks ago
---
That‚Äôs exactly my point. Prayer is supposed be shown as draining via the prayer orb and the skill tab, and the prayer tab.
---
Absolutely not. 
---
To put it in perspective for you, Vorkath/Zulrah can cap out around 4m (Zulrah maybe around 5 in BiS gear + absolute max efficiency). Chambers of Xeric caps out around 9m/h (Extremely efficient 2+2's with DPS alts). Theater of Blood caps out around 20m+/h (Extremely efficient duo's / 2+1's). Compared to that, 2.5m/h is a waste of time.
---
You could also argue that since you're getting RC XP it's more than 2.5m/h, but even if you can do casual ToB (\~ 10m/h) it's not worth it. Paying for ZMI runners + farming gold in ToB would get you 99 rc faster and/or a bigger bank faster than doing double astrals/nats to 99 RC.
---
I‚Äôm only 113 cb 1805 total and just getting into bossing. 
---
Firecape is a good thing to start with, although most bosses you‚Äôll be using range/mage anyways, so you could aim for FCfirst or skip and start with what I‚Äôm about to say. I would highly suggest getting it out of the way though. Should be a cakewalk with 99 range and Blowpipe after a few trial-runs.
---
I would start with easy bosses like KBD, Chaos elemental, Chaos fanatic (all on task preferably). These bosses are all extremely simple with few mechanics and no prayer switches.
---
Then consider doing Zulrah for your hard Western Diaries for Elite Void if you haven‚Äôt already.
---
From there you should take an hour out of your day to watch some Vorkath guides and start doing Vork. I‚Äôm only 260 kc and it‚Äôs easily one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made on the game.
---
I‚Äôm only 82/99/81 with 97 range/80prayer/94 mage and am having a blast at Vork farming for my Pet.
---
Next up I would say is either Dag Kings or GWD. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest doing GWD though unless maxed or with a group (or both) because chances are you‚Äôll get crashed. 
---
You definitely have the stats to go solo DK‚Äôs, however.
---
I‚Äôm afraid my experience doesn‚Äôt stretch far beyond that so I won‚Äôt try and give tips. Hopefully that gives a bit of an idea on where to start though.
---
You're not allowed to use coords. It must mimic wmk and use a distance.
---
Msb (I) is great for afk nmz. Not for rushing the levels however.
---
Yea, I just get really annoyed because I have to mindlessly go through the early waves which are really easy at my level but take a while at the same time, only to lose.
---
If I can go straight to fighting Jad, I do not think I would have the same issues.
---
500k is an example of what could be next. Lavas weren't viable until 2016, which tripled the ehp of the time and now we've tripled the rate again because of negligence. Nobody's asking for 500k today, but we have 220k right now, which is absurd it doesn't matter how difficult the method is nothing should ever be that broken.
---
Oh. Good to know.
---
Ahh okay. I wonder if price locking would become really bad or if the market would eventually take care of itself. Like if someone try's to pricelock a commonly needed item, the price would rise and more people would try to get the item to sell, therefore lowering the price back to normal ignoring the pricelocker
---
Having graceful wouldn‚Äôt be the unique part as a lvl 3, as any lvl account can get it with ease. But the HP pure part would be cool =)
---
I agree with your sarcasm. Bonds are way worse economically than anything else. But to that point, the issue with cosmetic mtx is that it's an issue when the mtx appearances look better than actual gear you have to work for.
---
That's the valance.
---
thf are those 3min kills lmao
---
I don't know if you played back in classic but it was just about not getting magic/prayer since they both affected your combat level. 
---
If you got prayer and not magic you'd be a prayer beast.
---
yeah just wasnt sure what you meant by the "in theory jagex....." comment. Since in theory they make loads of money from it. It's a common MTX in subscription based games because of its profitability.
---
If you imbue it it‚Äôs BiS all the way to 40cb
---
Should say 93/99 in skill tab then
---
Not very.
---
Shit meme. Why are you mad?
---
Definitely a bad idea focusing on a single style per person as you want to be able to only have one king alive at a time, and a single persons fps at your level will not achieve this.
---
Look at the guides you were watching and for each gear slot equip the best that you can money and stats wise. With three of you even in budget gear you'll be able to do dks.
---
It would definitely be a brutal grind even if you could work out these things. If you can get xp from pest control by repairing barriers that could give you a range of options
---
Nty im sticking to my ava accumulator
---
Two strength before 99 hitpooints
---
I was born over a decade before, idiot. Not my fault you are so ignorant.
---
I personally went dhcb, rigour, df-ward, pegs. 100% dhcb before rigour though. It‚Äôll allow you to get 6~ kill trips with average 2 min kill times, plus you can also sell it back if you want to do something else.
---
God forbid agility shortcuts actually use agility. Why not lock redwoods, herb patches, and rune ores behind diaries? It's stupid that every time an agility shortcut is suggested people say to lock it behind a diary for no reason whatsoever.
---
That's what I'm planning on doing, lava runes until 77 then doing seers roofs with teleporting until 73 agil. It's gonna be "fun"
---
Oh right, I'm exposed
---
https://runescapeclassic.fandom.com/wiki/Pure
---
Sounds like you're a pussy
---
I think he screenshotted 99 attack when he was in a different tab. Once the animated armor hit him the message went away. So he photoshopped his stat tab open just for the reddit post.
---
If I'm already at a slayer spot don't show up after me and tell me to hop.
---
Didn't think i would have to explain this as its v obvious, when people say hard in runescape they don't mean hard unless they're talking about inferno
---
You should know that but ur probably just being a pedant
---
That was a bigger goal for me in RS2 so I tried a different goal instead. Still very very tempting
---
Thought i was the only one
---
An option for them to be automatically sent to the bank /s
---
Are you solo?
---
It's a free game, accounts get recreated infinity. Kinda hard to ban something that will just keep coming back.
---
I'm not sure how repairing barriers works. Does it always take the same number of ticks? If not its likely rng based. Also is the number of each type of enemy rng based? If it is, the barriers would never be destroyed
---
Yeah I understand that, why did you feel the need to type that?
---
I'm doing literally the same thing. Cannon ice trolls on fremmy isles. There is a safespot posted on the wiki. If you are 70+ already, you're looking at 80Kxp/hr and you will make your cball money back + profit. I got some decent RNG yesterday and profited 400K from a 1500 cball run. Took like 45min.
---
Just bring alch and telegrab runes, super easy and great xp/gp.
---
it's relevant when you see the same phrase for the hundredth time in the subreddit. chill mad dude
---
why can't we just have 1 single world that's vanilla osrs release
---
PLEASE.
---
Required Thomas the tank engine work
---
Retard
---
I was part of Mystic Knights back in 05. Very active in the war scene. We wore red capes. I always go back and look for myself in these videos. I still play the same account with the same username.
---
The downvote button is there to help hide posts that don't contribute to the discussion. His comment was false and therefore isn't only useless, it can also misinform people. The downvote was used properly here. Not our fault he's spewing bullshit, nor is it our fault you don't understand what a downvote is for.
---
From what I've experienced it is a straight forward one for one in being destroyed and being repaired but I could be wrong
---
It took much longer between levels but each level became significant toward the end. It was quite rewarding :)
---
Skill? Lol.
---
Sorry dude but looking at a screen every 15 seconds instead of every 30 or 60 on the off chance something a little bad might happen isn't skill. It's an annoyance. Skill is doing Inferno or jad or something else challenging. Skill isn't turning your head more often from a TV show.
---
Opening them is so fast tho
---
would you want to spend all day hopping around banning bots? not to mention it takes 5 minutes to make a new account and go to the ge and spam, and that's assuming they dont already have the accounts made
---
I almost have a QC and it only dawned on me recently that skipping quest lore was a mistake. I blame slayemusiq because he always says "Skip through the dialogue" and I end up instinctively holding the space bar
---
Nop
---
Since when? I only had to bring a DDS when I bought my t6 off someone
---
No unregisted Hypercam, 6/10
---
"well unless you're working 2 jobs to rwt for money to train skills at max efficiency you're not doing it right and shouldn't be playing the game" - everyone that talk about efficiency on this sub
---
Which would be the better spot?
---
No you dont need to. Go to a non bh world and use edge lever. Kill the one holding t7 and you get t6. 
---
I own a bh cc and sell emblems daily.
---
If you dont have the patience and mental capacity to learn 3 rotations for access to some of the best gp rates in game then simply dont do it.
---
Raking weeds might be more suited to your intelligence level.
---
Right on. Lmao.
---
Once in rs2 they had no buy limits and there was merching clans
---
Pretty sure I heard someone say that they would require a whole engine rework for this to work. Not even kidding.
---
FYI the strikethrough on the +4 is hard to notice
---
Don't know about loot but I know it works for exp
---
I play one or two hours a day, and I reached 2k total after 5 years of playing. It‚Äôs possible! It‚Äôs about the journey, not the destination :)
---
There is a possibility for a false flag, but it‚Äôs probably more likely you‚Äôre guilty of what they say. They generally investigate those sorts of claims and gather enough proof to levy a ban.
---
There are a ton of people who have traded alts a lot of money, myself included. That isn‚Äôt enough for you to get banned.
---
There‚Äôs something you aren‚Äôt telling us, like you buying gold lol
---
Thats what a 10 year old copy and paste nice one
---
Rule #1 of skilling spots: If you‚Äôre not at the spot, it‚Äôs not your spot.
---
Some people code third own. It's not super complicated to try and code it. Not to mention I see more on f2p than members. They barely lose any gold considering most of what they are holding is just pure profit anyways.
---
That'll be the automatic system kicking in. It's a suspicious trade due to the account being new. Appeal it.
---
Is their a way to reset or delete my account I want to start playing the game but want to go back through the tutorial again because I forgot how to play
---
Exactly man, bonds are a necessary evil, and I‚Äôd much rather jagex get richer than some peice of shit gold farming company anyways
---
Probably obby maul. Doing 99 attack first would be horrible, you‚Äôd be hitting like 5s at best.
---
I haven't done Brimhaven Agility Arena since pre eoc but I saw it has a lower pet rate than rooftop courses so I went on my journey. Total 17 tickets before getting it.
---
I'm glad that's over!
---
I was even saying that 15 second is not really possible and you are most likely looking at more like 25 seconds, but even at 15 seconds it is worth using the teleport.
---
Slayer good
---
If they got around your bank pin and authenticator you probably got phished. Or your email is compromised and they were able to disable authenticator and social engineer your 4 digit pin
---
How someone's does that? LMAO cant really afk my mind is all in the game
---
I will quit IF real MTX comes, but I don‚Äôt see that happening, so your point is invalid. And Denial about what?
---
There is a method the top two hp pures are using to get only hp XP and I can't figure it out
---
With a cut ruby you have the option to cut it. Smelt it or craft it. So yes more valuable than an uncut that can be used for nothing else but cutting
---
Huh ok, you're right. Just checked it with an alt. Coulda sworn they changed that way back with that BH update.
---
Yo wtf a blessed spirit shield is that much now?
---
Graceful wouldn't be impressive but if you manage to get 75 hp and still stay 3 combat I'll be very impressed
---
yo for real i trained with that guy on chickens like 1 yr ago
---
I'm working on my new ironman doing some quests on my phone! Excited for the new account.
---
did you find this lol
---
Somebody doesn‚Äôt do wilderness content.
---
on my hc btw
---
ehh, idk, I think I would probably be the only one of my friends to afford to pay for skilling increases, so i would outstrip them, they would demean my accomplishments, and overall it would ruin the fun of it for us in some ways.  
---
Imagine buying a XP boost for somet ime though, or making it an in game buyable/tradeable item like a bond? I think that would be an effective gold sink.
---
Damn, as a normal player I couldn't imagine getting 99 strength with 1 attack.
---
You‚Äôre right, that‚Äôs pretty rare.
---
Has a nice dbZ feel to it
---
What is going to be the last skill? rc or slayer?
---
You are arguing your point in bad faith considering how many people told you already how it isn‚Äôt feasible, yet you continue posting the same reply.
---
He accidentally got level 2 Strength earlier on, while finishing HP I believe (maybe even earlier). To correct that error, as soon as he finished HP he grinded 99 Strength with Obby Maul at abysmal XP rates
---
should have trained on him instead
---
I'm a bit out of the loop, what is the PvP promise he's mentioning?
---
Black cape btw.
---
Complete waste of time lol. You argue to make yourself correct instead of using your brain. 
---
If you actually believe anything you‚Äôve written down is exactly correct, free of exaggeration the you‚Äôre delusional. :)~
---
Yeah I didn't realise obby maul was 1 attack. It's pretty insane considering how accurate it is. Figured it have an attack and str req like the gmaul
---
265 kc
---
Agreed. They're bitching about an extremely minimal BH update, right? It doesn't even effect all pvp lmao.
---
Some bug. Just watch his YouTube video as proof
---
Depends on how efficiently you play. A lot of skills are just super quick buyables, you can slip in pretty much all combat training while doing other things thanks to nightmare zone only requiring interacting with the game once per 20 mins, magic is essentially free time-wise because you can train it while doing other things (alching on agility courses, bursting slayer), farming has trees and hunter has bird houses to passively train, etc.
---
If you make it your goal to hit 2000 total or even to max, it's very achievable as long as your one to two hours a day is planned out right. But then you might not be having any fun, so what's the point? If you'd rather spend your 1 to 2 hours catching lobsters go for it IMO.
---
Yep
---
WOW, good strawman dude. I'm not going to let you jump ship and steer this conversation away from the fact that 79 MILLION exp in 1 week is FUCKING ABSURD. 
---
I don't care how much effort that man put in. I don't care if he was clicking so much it caused carpel tunnel. 79 MILLION EXP in 1 week is FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE. If you disagree with that, you are playing the wrong game.
---
I don‚Äôt like this
---
Pfft verzik's not even bad, it's the 3 Crabs she spawns surrounding you with a heat sink locked in
---
Some of this debate or simple talk of the markets relates to taxing the ge. Smaller then 1% imo but maybe have some sort of bracket system higher the value more tax. You pay. But would lead to ge maybe not having accurate prices because of people using the standard forums/ trade system.
---
you are wrong, the whole idea behind osrs was pre EoC, but people on here dont understand of grasp that apparently.  On another note, if you think dungeoneering is bad for the game where the hell were you when GE got voted in, which is 10x worst for the longevity of the game then a skill that introduces weapons that at best give +3 damage on what we currently have.
---
I remember when I first started trying to learn black jacking, I ruined it for so many people, I then hated how click intensive it was
---
Good bot.
---
Yep and their mobile app is really good. Can play while commuting.
---
Its a cool as fuck item for your house, being buyable just kills the concept.
---
if you haven't completed mm2 yet, feel free to block black demons
---
Ya
---
WRONG. The idea of OSRS was runescape in 2007. The game didn't have a backup of the 2007 version so they started the server using a 2006 backup and quickly added 2007 content like GWD.
---
Do not noobsplain how you think OSRS works to me. I was there when it happened.
---
Yea quite a few people from the old clans still play.
---
Well they can't do dungeoneering because that's in RS3, and RS3 bad. Now don't be bringing logic in here again young man.
---
surprise they let her keep streaming after all the nsfw material she leaked and others leaked of her.
---
Don't think I've seen an intelligent insight from him ever which is a bit disconcerting considering his age and how long he has been playing the game. He's obviously fearmongering with this tweet, either that or he's retarded.
---
Jagex haven't given him the PVP update that he wanted specifically, ignoring the fact that whatever they poll fails a poll and all the complexities involving PvP... therefore MTX WILL PROBABLY BE ADDED TO THE GAME. Like come on even he knew that he was being retarded.
---
Making potion is always a loss. Cleaning herbs is profit but not recommended for high level herblore training
---
How high are you?
---
You‚Äôre right but he‚Äôs entitled to his decision. Though a bad one.
---
I didnt click this post since I was 100% sure its gonna be endgame spoiler, I waited all this time just to see this, and its about swampletics lol
---
Everybody gangsta till the cannon starts building
---
Excuse my noobyness but this is useful because its shows me what tasks I'll get more often right?
---
Because last new game was like 7 years ago
---
Its concerning if you don't understand the context that he said it in
---
They better not make it more time consuming than Runecraft. I already dumped so many lamps into Runecraft lmao
---
The 1/275 is a roll on a 275 sided dice every time you open a casket.. Not that you're guaranteed to get one every 275 opens..
---
I‚Äôm maxed. Got bored and started a hcim
---
The biggest tip I have, especially with vorkath, just stay calm. I‚Äôm only at 38 KC and have died several times from just losing my cool and making split second bad decisions. His mechanics and easy and the quest variant is a lot more forgiving. And the last tip, if you don‚Äôt have the salve ei, I highly suggest it
---
Oh damn tick manipulation can give you a 200m xp boost weekly? Didn't realize that either.
---
You can give it a try, I think by the time it depletes  the other one would be ready. Also if you‚Äôre afking theres times where it wouldn‚Äôt matter how fast it was depleted because by the time youre back itll most likely be there. Sorry for the poor wording a tad stoned but hope it helped.
---
Very clean suggesstion
---
Yo I generally feel the same way but have you ever lived in the hood or run into any crackheads? They say some funny ass shit. It's hard not to laugh sometimes and other times it's just fucking sad.
---
Galvek is a lot harder than Jad!
---
What‚Äôs your play style going to be? Are you going to be a pure or just go all out as a main? Use the skimmy all day. 2h is not great for training as it is slower. As for money go kill cows for a while and bank the hides. That‚Äôs an easy money maker off the bat.
---
Exam periods. Most of playerbase now are old players that are in uni/late high school years. Exams before summer are one of the most important usually
---
i was as well, and a majority of the people that voted wanted the old combat system back but the only back up after EoC was that one... Either way we are pass all that, we now have cox, tob,mm2, ds2, zeah, skill guilds, etc etc **THE GAME IS NOT 2007 ANYMORE LET IT GO.**
---
Scimitar is better then 2h. 
---
You should train Attack to the next tier of weapon (ex: 10 for steel) then train the strength behind it to that tier as well. (10)
---
Then you can go for mith (20 attack, then 20 str), etc. Train def when you're taking too much damage. Bronze is an okay way of money, but maybe your goal could be Hill Giants? They're more profitable for f2p.
---
They do it because it releases the same endorphins that are released when they kill an actual PKer, except no skill is required.
---
This happened on my alt two days ago. I was afk training melee while I did fishing on my main. This guy about 20 lvls higher than me comes to my spot and is super toxic. So I just reply ‚Äú :) ‚Äú so I brought about 10 clan members and my main to just take it over.
---
Now what I said. So  imagine you dont have an argument
---
I say this as actual advice and not to be a dick. Look up f2p money makers on YouTube. Most don‚Äôt require a high or even medium combat level and you can make a decent amount of money to buy a bond with some time. Otherwise, for training your stats, a scim is by far the best.
---
We need hard mode Zulrah with one extra roll on the loot table
---
prayer switching is what always gets me. I miss one, panic, then miss the next one or two and die.
---
possibly one for zulrah that knows the rotations. Could help a lot for those people going for the hard diary. It personally took me 30 ish tries to get 1 kill and i never learned it myself. I stuck with vorkath afterwards.
---
The difficulty of negating his attacks have nothing to do with his strength.
---
agree, the inferno should give those restoration crystals like the fight kiln did.
---
This wouldn‚Äôt be useful to many people, but would it be possible to add a !gamble command to track how many high gambles you‚Äôve done? Similar to ‚Äú!kc zulrah‚Äù
---
I have done so for years
---
I see. Just takes a bit of practice, once you do it the first time the pressure is off because you know you can do it.
---
Wait what do you humidify on olm? I'm assuming you're not talking about waters for freeing people
---
I use a cannon and don't attack the monsters because that gives me the least experience while still being productive
---
That is still a fairly large portion and I‚Äôd reckon it‚Äôs higher than that lol
---
In my experience people who complain about cannons are too poor to afford using them.
---
I agree with vengeance. Also magic levels play a role in your magic defense as well.
---
I work everyday, my first 99 was rc and i did over nov through feb. Just play the game and you will make gains
---
without mage you'll get wrecked in pvp. You'll need Vengeance / Barrage.
---

she used twitter to leak it, her twitter is advertised on twitch, amazon is usually really liberal about that kind of stuff.
---
he said in a stream that working at jagex was awful though at many points, he did however really like the team he was working with.
---
&gt;The post-max xp records shouldn't be passable in 4 weeks and Jagex's nerf reflects that.
---
except this doesnt change anything. you can bank 200m and do 200m xp in a week using void sets

I thought I remembered something about !kc displaying your pb time, but i've never seen it and I want it

&gt; You should be banned if you abused this bug.

bug? what bug
---
Bruh.
---
For those unaware, the account name "RNG XXXX" is used by a prominent gambling bot farm, and in this picture you can see one of those gambling bots being used to spread phishing links to steal accounts.
---
Successfully stolen accounts are then used for the gambling bot farm, and unsurprisingly also used to steal more accounts.
---
Something desperately needs to be done about this. Don't support these bot farms.
---
holy shit man, who pissed in your cereal? there's so many things that's not even old school, and the game needs to evolve. people always joke about wanting slayer 2... but the thing is, this skill was kinda like slayer 2.
---
jagex actually supports ironman officially though, more like a pure or area restricted account
---
Its doable but not as afk as he makes it seem. You have to constantly click in new places which requires your focus on and off

If you see a pile of bananas/oranges, it was an uim sorting his stuff.

So for me I used to suck at pvm but then I just.... Did it over and over and succeeded.  I failed alot of times before I was successful at any boss.  Personally jad was not my first bossing experience (I know it's everyone's but I was bad). I did alot of the Slayer bosses first before I even attempted jad.  It is important not to panic or see it as anything too crazy and I feel that's what the experience of the Slayer bosses tough me.
---
Good luck!
---
Wow i never knew that,
---
But like, it‚Äôs not on Twitch so it‚Äôs pretty irrelevant. Otherwise you end up in some weird morally slippery slope. I mean, as mentioned in the thread, pornstars stream without punishment so I see no difference.
---
We already have indirect microtransactions anyway. They keep adding in more and more methods that require alts to train for many skills, so if you want to play efficiently you now need 4 accounts.
---
what's with all the modded comments? what was said?
---
I wasn't as keen on crafting meta when I came back to osrs. Looking back on it, I should've gotten 99 crafting so I might prioritize it a bit higher now.
---
For me it's using Runelite to set up screen markers so you can move your mouse right after clicking an obstacle to be in position for the next. Works alright.
---
How do you train your thieving? Didn‚Äôt realise there was afk thieving üòÇ
---
I second the idea of getting a mage arena cape. Imbued would be great, but not necessary. If you‚Äôre really enjoying barrows invest in an occult necklace; you‚Äôll need it for the rest of the game and it‚Äôll make a big difference. Also getting your prayer higher will be big QOL change.
---
This isn‚Äôt an American only thing.  I did not realize this was something that is normal elsewhere.
---
Yeah "rares" FeelsBadMan
---
I did air battle staves, from unlocking it, it‚Äôs roughly 50m to 99 compared to the 120m from doing d‚Äôbodies. And you still get ~320k/h.
---
which door in plunder is the one. i want it but it wouldnt be good for the game
---
Seriously I can't understand mlm.
---
Shit, it's 1/3 of the xp from granite or iron and it's not even that afk, why would you do that?
---
better watch your steps next time!
---
What about dog-dogs?
---
This
---
Im in the same boat, honestly doesn fell like that much gp per hour. 800k at best
---
Volcanic mine is even good, you can get 90k/h and it actually keeps my brain occupied - I‚Äôm not a fan of afking skills.
---
If you think dungeoneering is the answer to people's request for Slayer 2, you're an idiot too.
---
he got 2 strength on accident while training ranged but never gave up. After he got 99 ranged he did strength next so it pretty much negated the mistake.
---
oh please jump off your high horse, the only thing that would effect slayer is whip prices, which are already low as fuck and only being sustained because of tent and duel arena.  As for pvp, how the hell is dungioneering going to keep people out?  People are still going to farm revs, and the same idiots that try and spec each other out will still sit in the wild all day just to break even.  Your arguments and points make no reason why the skill would hurt the game, the only argument you have is that **YOU**dont like the skill so **you** dont want it into the game.  Thats fine you are entitled to your opinion but shit like GE and REVS hurt the game more then a instance dungeon that offers weapons that degrade and only offer an extra 2-3 damage on the max hit.
---
I doubt it'll ever not be like this tbh

---
Dunno why you're talking if you didn't even play classic...
---
I really really want a plugin that tracks the time things on the ground have before they de spawn.  Like loot and whatnot.  I honestly don't think it would be that hard as it's just a 2 min timer.  It would have to be on the specific item and not just a pile because of things dropping on top of things.
---
I feel like a few obscure limits *might* be too low, but if the limits are too low for you, you're not actually buying to use. You're buying to resell. 
---
There are 14,400 seconds in 4 hours. It's not even possible to use 10,000 of most high-volume-type items in that timeframe...
---
It just ruins the feel of the game completely for me
---
Even bright clue skin is pushing it, though would be nice if it was a reward from a master quest or something.
---
The drop rate isn‚Äôt wrong. I got 58 slayer this week and managed to get a black mask in 150 kills, yet back in pre-eoc I went 5k without a black mask. It‚Äôs just bad luck. 
---
It‚Äôs also entirely possible he missed some of the masks that dropped accidentally. That‚Äôs a picture of the masks in his bank, not the collection log. I got my mask this week on mobile and almost missed it because there was no huge glowing item overlay telling me it was there. 
---
Regardless, if you truly think I‚Äôm wrong, go tweet Ash and see what the real answer is.
---
If you watch the latest karamja only ultimate Ironman video, it looks like he has a plug-in that does that.  Unless he's using OSbuddy

Wot?

the main reason i think theyre too low is indeed flipping, but theres a couple things that should be higher. for example a toxic trident (e) it takes 20k death, chaos and 100k fire runes and 20k zulrah scales to fully charge it. another example are arrow shafts, which is 7k per 4 hours, it takes like 8min to make 7k arrows, arrow tips, dart tips, always have ppl ask if u could buy these for them at the ge. but ye, main reason is flipping for me

The only monetization product I've refused to indulge companies with are loot boxes. Mainly because you can claim there's a 25% chance at rolling something; but there's no way to verify if there's actually a 25% chance. Especially since you can go in and proactively change percentages through hotfixes.
---
I refuse to create gambling software unless it's specifically being marketed as gambling.

I do know with the product we built; better offers would be given to players who paid more, and if you haven't paid in awhile you'd get even better offers than frequent payers.

I actually suggested this in a Q&amp;A before! I agree. I like the music but hate having to scroll to find my favorite tracks! Also a neat idea I pitched, add a favorites list for the music tab, maybe something like you have to have the music cape to use it, or maybe the music cape expands the favorite list to 10 as opposed to 5. Just a thought

Nope. Flicking only one pray while others are constantly active does not slow prayer drain.

Dumbest take ever. I jumped in and out of OSRS several times. If I take a few months or a year off I can return to the game and finish what im training or doing. If you missed a few months or even a year back between 09-2012, the game was ruined.

Explains a lot why Ronan left. People were ragging on him calling him ungrateful, when they don't understand he had basically zero chance of a promotion working with Jagex. If the company isn't going to reward your hard work and loyalty with the opportunity of a promotion, why are you even working there? Sure you love the game and love working with your coworkers, but are you really going to let the company take advantage of you just because of those reasons?

Based on my comment, I feel like they'd be able to decipher false entries pretty easily. How did you generate the names? Random int + symbol + name, etc? Were they dynamic or did they all have the same format?

---
19 less, to be precise.

Which is not minimum wage.

These are both very valid points. Although I now wonder if putting info about bots and scammers in front of new players would actually increase the amount of them as people learn about them quicker

What you're doing and what others are doing with fletching are two different things and you most likely will get banned for it. People who train fletching uses mouse keys rebounded to other keys, 5 being left click, and 2,4,6,8 being their respective arrow keys. There are ways to make the keys jump in distance, but you still need to set up the mouse spot.
---
It just sucks that you have to get all those 99 combat skills....then grind 99 slayer. Though I guess slayer will level a lot fast maxed cb.
---
Congratulations! Can't wait to see 99 def in 2 days! Can't wait to see 99 slayer in 6 months!
---
I've seen a different version of this suggested where the progress bar turns blue when you've hit the limit, I like that idea more as it's more obvious.
---
Questing the early levels is definitely the way to go, although not mandatory if you want to make a complete range tank I would suggest going for barrows gloves. This way you can get the early levels quested (saves a lot of time) and get some of the main quests done for a range tank (Lunar, Ancients, etc.)
---
I'm also coming back from a long hiatus from the game and just made a range tank too. If you need someone to talk with my RSN is "From Online"
---
I really don‚Äôt think the new player population is driving these bots, and most people don‚Äôt read half the shit or retain the things the stronghold tells you. Hence why so many players get phished, at the end of the day it comes down to the persons common sense and knowledge.
---
No matter how many times you tell people something it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll believe it. New players should also see the rules that you can report ppl and one clearly stating player run games of chance, so it‚Äôs in stone you shouldn‚Äôt do that lol

1 Slayer? How did you train your combat skills?

Cos leveling any one of them up doesn't change anything about the way you fight except the damage. It's the same engine and mechanics no matter what choice you make, no?

Doesn't this also apply to pvmign with the tbow or blowpipe?

After hearing that for years, then finding the Glassdoor reviews, I've believed it for a while now. Ayzia seemed so pumped up to be working for OSRS, whether or not we ragged on him at first. Then to see him quit after a short while and to hear how he feels about the job....
---
Yeah it really is not afk at all, that's why I do blast mining instead because even though it requires constant attention, you can get into the groove and it's kind of fun, and both more money and xp.
---
Well first, you gotta mage them while praying mage and wearing your antifire stuff, but TBH man skip the task not worth it at all.
---
&gt; Some people say shortcuts rectify this, but I disagree because I don't  like how they are implemented. There does not seem to be any rhyme or  reason to which shortcuts need to be high level. There is no systematic  way in which a bridge is easier or harder than a tunnel or a tube to get  through. It's just a random grab bag of "This one will be hard and this  one will be easy." 
---
This is even worse when you have shortcuts that are also gated behind a diary requirement

I can't speak for everyone here, but i will 100% quit and so will the multiple irl and in game friends i play with if anything like SoF is released in OSRS.  I have a feeling that at least 50% of the player base feels the same though. Although i don't prefer RS3 combat system, I would probably actually play the game if it weren't for all the MTX.

Making them ultra rare from an in-game source already makes people spend more irl money for them so it doesn't seem like there would be a point
---
Zuk-ka-no
---
Drop trade to alt for 7 days membership!
---
Would be handy if you could turn them into a stack of ultracompost
---
Right my bad im guessing im lucky then, Gl im sure you will get something soon!
---
D
---
That's exactly why, making it fair for everyone involved. People like you are the worst cause you're pissed that you spent money on a free game and it's not immensely better. unless you do want them to seem even more money hungry than people already perceive them. It will just make it so it looks like they want to force people into buying membership because f2p is unbearable. But hey $11 ü¶Ä

*crab* WILDY UPDATES BAD *crab*
---
Each mark of grace is worth ~10k each. You do profit off agility
---
Lots of dialogue. Also some other things happen with other characters
---
Thank you.
---
I am smarter then you. You can go fuck yourself, cunt üñï.
---
I've literally been asking for this for years. Jamflex please, I'd love listening to this game's music rather than my own playlists
---
That's a good point but cosmetic overrides could become a thing to try encourage more people to buy the mainly useless clue rewards
---
Then I wouldn't be level 3 combat :P
---
Legend has it im stick sucking to this day...
---
skilling bos wouldn't be so fat
---
Little bit under what you‚Äôd expect at that KC but don‚Äôt stop now! You‚Äôve stored all than RNG up
---
Ez 100m
---
Legend has it im still sucking to this day...

Thanks mate :)
---
Saving Slayer for last.... so 30 months I'll get there
---
Has anyone tried putting together a 2nd edition for OSRS?
---
Eh, if OP can't check to make sure they're using the right fuckin' WORDS, I can't blame someone for not doing the research.
---

Right at the start of the video. It takes him 20 seconds to run from BJS straight to the dock. This is an hour long video and this run is repeated so it seems consistently that length. 
---
 This isn't even including whatever method you are using to get to the fairy ring in the first place. Likely a house fairy ring will still add upwards of 10 seconds making it about a 30 second trip. Most people are 1/3 or more of the way through their kill at this point. 
---
 if you are getting only 2 kills in "above average gear", then you are doing something wrong. Period.
---
You can argue that there shouldn‚Äôt exist a 1m an hour melle xp training method without saying it‚Äôs bug abuse.
---
Also I‚Äôm probably not smarter than you.
---
ok but it all comes down to them being separate stats on the highscore page
---
Yeah hoping early Slayer goes by really quick..
---
Holy crap mind runes? Those things let you do actual magic. Like you can throw fireballs at people.
---
He definitely puts in the work :) 
---
Thanks mate, appreciate it
---
2nd last
---
Idk my company send to handle it just fine
---
Thanks bro!
---
i feel like it'd be hard to regulate only letting PKers vote in a poll, if its a KC threshold people would just boost
---
Agility &gt;.&lt;
---
I got one from here while going for brim blue graceful
---
Idiocy is correlated to verbal diarrhea
---
Focus on buying bonds
---
yeah I'll chill at Tithe Farm for awhile! While trying to plant atleast 2 lots of trees every day and a few herb runs to make some money back
---
Yes. If there is a 10,000 buy limit every 4 hours, for example, and you buy 1 at 12 pm, you can buy 9,999 at 3:59 pm and 10,000 at 4 pm.
---
Konar is currently rather underwhelming. Clue scrolls are always in addition
---
991atatime rolls off the tongue easier. Also I think both those names are taken now.
---
For some reason the 2nd ones "Ill put down my weapon" reminds me of Tommy Wiseau.
---
Thank you
---
correct, 600k cannonballs
---
They are separate stats, but they dont change the combat system except for what you can use and your DPS output. Your choice of weapons and armour change the combat system more than stats do.
---
Your chair must smell awful
---
Wrote dude you seen really secure about how big your dick is
---
That'd lose the value of saying sit kid to your opponents.
---
Cheers :)
---
Ahhh ok. Thanks
---
Havent seen it used b4
---
by making money on the slower skills
---
That‚Äôs a good point
---
Negative.
---
This nigga deleted his fucking post LMAO
---
git gud
---
do the real OGs too!
---
Turn on vpn. Make new account, transfer everything to it
---
The only thing more annoying than those bots are the multiple post like this who think there is some quick solution and the players who get a rare drop and say "there goes my rng".
---
Not true at all. Jagex has a link to remove it. I've done it after my iron was hacked. A simple google search would help
---
TBH someone probably has got a pull request for such a plug-in on github in a few days :D
---
YES YES YES
---
Dude, the fact that there is a non zero chance of it happening means that it is quite *literally* possible. Extremely rare, but *possible*.
---
Anyway, you seem to have glossed over most of my post because I‚Äôm not arguing that this tiny percent chance happened, I‚Äôm saying OP probably didn‚Äôt pick up every single mask because he was playing on mobile without item overlays so it‚Äôs possible he missed a lot. Especially if he was doing it at work or somewhere else with a lot of distractions.
---
The fact that the pic is of his *bank*, not the collection log, there is no guarantee that that‚Äôs the total amount of black masks he received anyway. Ergo, all of your calculations are moot because the dataset is potentially incomplete.
---
Didnt you get 2 str o before 99 range so isnt this tittle a flat out lie
---
Nothing to say he can‚Äôt do other things while things are growing. If he does farming after slayer, he could just slayer or other skills until 99 farming is done passively
---
Thanks mate!
---
Would have to be the worst one for sure...
---
slayer xD
---
Ah, the anti-vax scale.
---
cause im using prayer at the time
---
As good as raids are, i always enjoyed the fuck outta dung
---
what is hitpooints
---
Would you mind posting a pic of your collection log? Just to see the total number of black mask drops. I‚Äôm curious if the drop rate is wrong after all.
---
No but he'd love to call you a bitch
---
Obby Maul lol it was torture
---
slayer :)
---
me to as a skill
---
A trick for instanced boss fights is to bring all untradable gear so if you die you will still have it instead of losing it. Just don't make the mistake did monkey madness 2. I brought all untradable except a whip, thinking since it's the only tradable item I brought, I would keep it on death. But I had at least 3 items worth more than it that were untradable. So I lost the whip lol
---
fuck you fe :)
---
Think you'll ever make pins of bosses?  I'd buy a Corp or olm pin
---
Makes me wonder how that 200m 1 at a time guy is doing.
---
It means that you gained construction xp if it tracks there. get some xp in other skills and you'll see.
---
I *could* make that argument but it's boring, because Jagex clearly never intended for this method to be used for training. I think it IS bug abuse and it shouldn't exist.
---
tight as fuck
---
Turbo support
