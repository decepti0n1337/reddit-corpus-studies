Warding could potentially work a few others, perhaps less than a quarter of my examples. However, when you're pushing for a new skill, it makes no sense to insert one that overlaps in various established places, threatens to takes content from existing skills and slaps a new level lock on them, and denies the opportunity to flesh out those already existing skills.

I honestly don't know how anyone would think the current color scheme is better than the cape in this post. The stupid ass purple looks like something a 12 year old would put in their private server.

Just got it last night

If I don't get 6 hour logged I'll be disappointed.

I would get 90 in both and maybe go for elite void.

Here, have my uvote for your honesty. No idea why people downvote you. It's not like you are avoiding responsibility or complaining.
---
no one asked normie
---
gz you overthank it and maid it uglier
---
Is this is last update in the game I would be happy
---
I play wow often, and from Blizzard‚Äôs perspective, perm bans make people just create a new account to do the same offense, whereas a temp ban gives the person enough incentive to wait it out, thus decreasing the amount of botters at any given time.  Im sure this applies to osrs as well to some extent.
---
That's hot
---
Or if you‚Äôve a gaming mouse, also map to buttons on the mouse.
---
Shoulda used dhides cause this skill is pretty much crafting 2.0
---
What's the value on that KC?
---
Thanks to this post I now know why Warding seems so off to me... It's the freaking skill icon! The icon doesn't even feel Old School.
---
With other skill icons, they either give a decent idea of what the skill is about (e.g.  Ranged, Magic, Construction, Slayer, Firemaking etc) or they look pretty jank but you *could barely* guess what the skill is about (e.g. Runecrafting, Fletching, Strength). 
---
The Warding icon doesn't fit in with the rest of the skill icons. If I show the icon to my non-existent gf and ask "What do you think this skill is called?" I would probably get a reply of "?????". 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I honestly think the icon should be reworked and probably play off the channelling lamps within the skill. I honestly the wards themselves are a too abstract of a concept to use as the icon for the skill. My reasoning is that Smithing has the anvil, Crafting has the chisel and hammer and thus Warding should incorporate the channelling lamp (and possibly vis).
---
Super helpful as with all these comments, i definitely feel a little better now and am going to be trying again very soon.
---
The 1:1 reasoning does make sense, good points but I‚Äôll probably still to f1-f4 for now

Meant 8 percent, fixed.
---
At any point it could be consider automated, irl or in game, you‚Äôre probably going to get a macro ban.
---
I look at the Runecraft icon, I see a plate of bacon. And in RS3, summoning is a wolf. I think it's fine the more esoteric and less real-world skills have stranger looking icons. What could you put? A lantern maybe? But that still wouldn't necessarily communicate "creates magical armors."

I like the cyan cape you suggested better than the purple cape! Although I would still prefer that the warding cape be pink or rainbow, as there are other capes that have shades of blue and green in the game already.

can't you get a friend to carry 28 essence and just bring the stew yourself? Then drop the bowl and spice and get the 28 essence from your friend

idk if +5 magic accuracy is worth the defense you lose from ahrims, it will replace the rags xerican robes in the wild at least i guess since the new shit will prob sit around 40k.

Wow player here this man speaks the truth the membership fee tho keeps minor pests/trolls away but serious abusers have multiple accounts sometimes even multiscreen.

Agreed even though I just got mine a week ago.  I still blazed through every quest with the wiki, so I'm interested in actually just trying to do a new one all on my own.   But honestly I'll probably get a third of the way through the light puzzle before I say fuck this and just wait for a guide lol.

Thats a bad reason to vote. You should formulate your own opinion and then vote.
---
Yeah overpowered rewards that arent needed
---
because you dont unlock anything in game after 99. its pretty much reaching "intended" end of training a skill
---
because that's a lot of shit to manage, and if you try and do everything the competition will no doubt provide a better specific service
---
I'm saying it happened. They do now.
---
If it wasn't made into a skill, the item sink effect would not be as strong. You'd only need to augment each of your BiS weapons  and armour once minus the degrade to dust ones.

Why? Don't you get bored?

Why does existing things being bad mean you must have more of it? Current skills being shit doesn't mean that everyone has to automatically want another shit skill...

Asked this in yesterday's post at the cut off. Asking once more for more opinions...
---
I'm not even close to the requirements for doing Money Madness so I can't use the dragon scimmy. What's the next best weapon to use for 60-70 attack? I'm just going to afk train at sand crabs the whole way with 60 strength so I can get the whip.
---
I've got like 4 million coins to spend, can make more if needed.
---
Reply I got in last post said granite hammer. That the general consensus? Also since whip doesn't train strength, what should I use to train that once at 70 attack?
---
What the fuck is that
---
Do you make money as you train fetching? Even if you buy all the materials off the GE?

The inventory icon is too large.  Remove the circle

What if warding doesn't fail?

I would think a dragon sword could be an alternative at 60 attack

That's true, I was mining for a while before the first showed up, so there was definitely a higher chance of that happening. But I did get the hard clue geode in the very next rock

It's great being able to go into the higher skill total worlds. 2k worlds in particular are nice and quiet. Not that there's no cancer in 2k worlds, just a lot less. Idk yet what 2.2k worlds are like, but I heard it's totally silent and you get bitched at for talking lol

Id vote for it, bring on rshd too
---
The issue is that at some point more of the same isn't actually adding anything. That point is definitely already past for 99.9% of players when it comes to bankstanding skills. 
---
Warding isnt actually creating content for anyone who won't max all of the other buyables. Any time spent standing at the bank leveling warding could be spent leveling any other buyable in the same manner and it would be exactly the same.
---
It's not about hating bankstanding. It's about creating more bankstanding being redundant.
---
This was a super wild fucking story. Take my upvote. And im not worried for you, im sure youll find somebody. i mean you play osrs so i think for most guys thats all the standard youll ever need to meet.

I was just at the ge and some guy said he was paying 10k a month for a rsgf. He didnt specify the currency but i think for 10k USD thats a good deal. And you have an edge over all the other girls who were willing to do it cause youre a real girl.

All jokes aside though, ive never met either of you but from that story i can tell you werent the issue in thst relationship and youre better off without him

Because I think quest cape is a big achievement with hundreds of hours of gameplay that goes into it. That‚Äôs like jagex adding another elite diary step every 9 months and keeping the reward the same. But yeah it‚Äôs just a suggestion.
---
Good to know!
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie. I‚Äôm a very aesthetically focused person, and that plays a partial role in why skills I choose to favor, as stupid as that may be. That being said, if the color scheme of Warding is one of those skill capes, it‚Äôll stay at level 1 for a very long time.
---
Joking/non-joking aside, props to you for starting a discussion and putting in the work, but I honestly don‚Äôt care for the suggested designs. I quite like the dark theme currently associated with it.
---
Check out afterglow cc
---
It cam hurt the game. You now have an incentive to go for 200m which can easily burn out anyone and quit the game.
---
Your reasoning is flawed because you're attributing the hive decision engine with the concern of complex query.  
---
Handle the complexity upfront (for ex, structure queries to be answerable by yes/no), and you will still get all the benefits of collective knowledge.
---
You would of cast that many spells easy. Depending how long you have played you would of clicked on food that many times even banks. You would be surprised

I edited it thankyou
---
Warding has multiple skills involved to achieve the same thing as welll... skills working together is a common thing in RS and is not unique to the idea i just suggested. 
---
Also crafting being "clusterfucked" or bloated is another term people throw around to excuse any legitimate place it may have other than warding, despite never truly thoroughly explaining this stance.
---
Smithing is metal working, crafting is natural material working. (Sand into glass, gold into jewellery, fabric (hides and cloth) into armours, and other things like wood into staves).
---
Its not "bloated" by having a wealth of options within the skill, otherwise a lot of skills are "bloated". It doesn't make runes, and arrows, and weapons and oh also potions! Which funnily enough is also what you suggest should just happen when a simple idea of "warding could fit into existing skills", yet the moment we show how it  could fit its now a "no no crafting is too bloated we can't combine new stuff into it!".
---
Pick a side, you're hopping between "if it can be combined, all skills should be" and "even though it makes sense to combine.. the skill it fits into is bloated with its own skilling methods so we should segregate it into a new skill".
---
Show we have bow making as well as fletching? Weapon smithing as well as armour smithing? Segregation only needs to go so far before you're doing the polar opposite of what you think adding 5-8 sets of robes to crafting would do.
---
too bad you didnt get an acb or something but thats still awesome.
---
Ironman checking in to say 88 smithing feels more like hell.

An offense expiring means the punishment is not in effect. Doesn't mean that it's forgotten.
---
Think of it like milk in your fridge. When the milk expires, it doesn't just disappear you still have to deal with it.
---
If you get banned for 2 weeks from buying an infernal cape, your offense expires after the 2 weeks. If you do it again, they look at the fact you got banned for it previously and at least from what I've heard will disable your access to the inferno and give you a longer ban.

They should update the examine info on quest items to detail what it does and whether it‚Äôs needed in the future
---
he changed his name to "Therabzone" btw
---
Youre right its not a reason for a whole new skill but its a valid reward from the skill just as we were talking about. And the reason for making into its own skill is so those skills dont get bloated as a clusterfuck of different content and its why we dont just have a bunch of our current skills just compiled into other ones. On the flip side you also complicate things by spreading the making of this stuff over multiple skills and that once again makes everything messy. Its about having everything packed in separate distinct containers.
---
Well is a monumental waste of time given that warding isn‚Äôt passing the poll
---
Advise just doing all the quests as fast as possible rfd (:
---
What you're looking for is a Lunar Spell named "Stat Spy"

&gt; And actually we already pretty much loss the 2007 feeling and keeping 23 skills is probably the only thing left for us so...

Then we talk about Kourend, an entire continent, that introduced BiS or Best Exp rates for a ton of slots and skills. Kourend was the death of the "oldschool" mindset imo.

Yes and that means it hurts the game because lower player count. You contradict yourself without realising it.

I know when they implemented username changes they unbanned a load of accounts that were banned for offensive names, this could be something similar

---
At 99 you can make one that gives you 1mil and a reach around every time you use it.

If you're going member at some point, getting base 40s should take less than a week on a new account via questing, so just make a new account and grind b gloves

---
Oof.
---
Yeah I assume so, the p ess kinda surprised me lmao
---
I mean they could spend time reworking outdated skills instead of...what's currently being done.
---
As someone mostly unfamiliar with construction, what unlocks at 83 that is so helpful for slayer? Is it the rejuvenation pool I hear about?
---
Very well written and thought out. This is the kind of content we want the devs to see.
---
Runelite has valuable drop notification makes the pc play a sound
---
You think the community wasn‚Äôt split before warding? There will always be casual players who want to enjoy the game , pkers who only care about taking spades, and hardcore players who want to maintain that status.
---
Most Achievement diaries have rewards you can collect daily. 
---
I also recommend doing some of your undesirable skills in short bursts to make the grind less painful. For example, I'm not fond of Thieving cause it's really click intensive so I'll train it until I get around 50k xp (or in your case, a level). I'll do it usually every play session. It really adds up over time.
---

Im curious about why 83 con is so important too?
---
I'm trash at this game and it's easy. You're good just lookup a guide
---
I like the purple because even though this isn‚Äôt the case, I see warring as almost an Arceuss-esque skill. So I like that the colour scheme jives with that. I also think that purple is a really nice colour.
---
By "entire society" you mean runescape, as in when Jagex went public and got shareholders? Or actually the entire society as in when the world created the concept of shareholders in the sixteenth century?
---
Dude tldr its late ive been hand typing responses to a lot of similar points for a long time now and im getting tired man. its been good talking to you. Weve been going at this for a long time add me on osrs if you want you seem cool @champ s cape
---
i had one guy i actually conceded to. He mentioned how you could like something at first and over time get tired of it and how warding in a practical sense is a reskin of other bankstanding skills so if you still like bankstanding skills you cant really talk about needing more till youve trained the ones you have to max level and once you do youll find youve had more than your fill and are now sick of them. I conceded and said yeah thats a good point but in defending my decision i really liked it thematically and lore wise and how it finally gave hunter and mage an artisan skill when the other gathering skills and combat styles have one. So ill have to still stick to warding even if i cant complain about not having enough skilling content
---
It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a women
---
eh, rune armour isn't the money grind you think it is... it's slow, profits aren't the best, the cape acts like goldsmith gauntlets, but I'm making great xp and money making Battlestaffs instead of jewelry, until I start making Zenyte, and Onyx stuff. Smithing Cape could be better.
---
I feel ive  had a cloud 5, in my friendlist back in the day.

---
This comment honestly comes off overly defensive and a little bit unstable.  If anything you sort of proved a lot of people in this thread right by posting this...  
---
I dont see a lot of people posting about finances I see them posting about mental health, you've devoted far more than the majority of your life to a game and there's no arguing that this type of addiction, whether it be 18 hours a day or not, is not healthy for any one human to do.
---
People are impressed with what you've done but I can't say that anyone should be proud/inspired as what you've done can only be described as destructive, dangerous, and honestly a little weird.

Fuck no

God damn that sounds good.

I already said that -10 upvotes doesn't make my opinion bad and for you to downvote and move on if you dont like it. Clearly I dont care about the votes. Some facts for ya a-g-a-I-n. If you're a troll on the internet then some am I. Except you were serious at first then pull the troll card after getting shown you're wrong. Just own it and go away. I agree it was a well thought out response of mine but it took very minimal effort or time to think of that. More of a natural understanding for me. You're not a troll on the internet when that attitude of yours and more importantly  a common attitude of a lot of people everywhere contribute to all the hatred in the world
---
I voted no just because I didn‚Äôt like the skill, and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm a med level player who plays the game for fun. 
---
I don‚Äôt like the skill I vote no 
---
I like the skill I vote yes. 
---
As simple as that.
---
Except not really. Because you already can trade your items away to another account to be sold and turned into a bond.
---
Looks like Warding is going to pass.
---
WHY LISA?
---
Go for base 80s and train combat with slayer
---
A lot of people don't train a lot of skills - they stick to the 50% they like. This isn't uncommon for a lot of games.

You‚Äôve missed out on so much

Why you think that giving someone an honest critique of their art so that they can improve is bad is beyond me. They have a good start here. They also have a long way to go.

They could move it over, crafting is already an oversaturated skill. I mean I dont care either way, I could make all of the new mage armours if it were added to crafting.
---
Yooo that made me wtf more not less
---
I would rather have SAILING! NO Warding!
---
Looks pretty cool, I think the smuggling/bounty hunting idea makes a decent amount of sense, definitely better than a construction copycat that makes no sense.
---
The whole encounters at sea section looks like a catchall that would be better served being split apart. I would throw things like shipwrecks, underwater caverns and uncharted islands into an exploration or treasure hunting category. Not sure where to throw the rest of it, some of them seem like random events and others are just hard to get a feel for in general. Maybe add a separate section for trading voyages? Idk I'm just not so much a fan of the random eventy stuff.
---
What I'm most curious about is how you see open world sailing working? I've always thought of sailing along the lines of fishing trawler, the pirate attack in the mos le harmless quest or the ship bit from ds2. Basically doing things around the ship either to fill a progress bar or to keep the ship from sinking. And of course, to fight off those pesky pirates and sea monsters.
---
They could easily fix the poll regardless.
---
Authenticator is a joke.  Thieves can just turn it off with no delay and it's like you don't even have one
---
&gt; They‚Äôve already spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours maxing an account. What‚Äôs a few hundred more to them??
---
It's enough to vote "No". Skills are worth training to the proportion that they're fun to train. If you're only doing it because otherwise you'd need to totally scrap your OSRS account, then you should really be voting "No" in the poll.
---
&gt; Edit: Your tone and profanity is only helping my ‚ÄúNo-Warding Asshole‚Äù theory.
---
Yeah, well your "Everyone who disagrees with me is just a mean person" doesn't help the implicit message of your post that the pro-warders are the nicer people. This sub has been strawmanning and insulting No voters for a week now.

I'm squidward

Torso would be the next upgrade. After that is your weapon: whip - abyssal dagger - bludgeon. Then it‚Äôs Bando torso and tassets
---
10/10 would do.
---
You're probably getting downvoted for being contradictory, tbh.  "Some changes could make me change my mind!" Followed up by "Revamp the entire idea".
---
Good point, I just wasn't clear on the explanation that Mr Poopy gave.
---
Definitely not a goblin boy

Low creativity, strong idea.

grats on double tassets and all the kc on boss! love your videos :D :D :D

Yeah on your end it's just one joke, but imagine a few dozen of you? Getting the same bad 'joke' every ten minutes gets tiring fast. I really don't blame them for switching to a zero tolerance on it.
---
Actually wouldn't be able to tell ya
---
Google and read about the crip walk
---
That‚Äôs why you drive AND play. Mobile bless up
---
Yes but the problem is you said you would do it, so if the situation ever arose you would be doing the thing you complain about. How can you agree with something and complain about it at the same time. But obviously we just agree to disagree.
---
Is that Sir Pugger?
---
Do you use range or melee setup? Which do you think is more efficient/less effort?
---
yeah and the interface is shit besides. Terrible UI/UX.
---
Looking at your post history I'm 100% certain that you were high on something and tripping balls while creating this post
---
It would also show their level
---
I think so, there's a free trial that goes to level 35.. which is alot of content. You can level every job (class) on one character.
---
Never trust shit you read on Facebook

Quite a few people were using it for swapping and trading when osrs first came out but it's kind of a ghost town in comparison now. Some people still use it for trading items you can't get on the G.E. (burnt fish etc)

Aspergers posting when it hasn‚Äôt even passed lol

Is there any ass busting grind like rs in the game?
---
61 slayer you‚Äôll make another 20k
---
Do wilderness slayer or konar, or do boss tasks when offered
---
Normal slayer outside of wilderness and probably konar makes you fuck all
---
It is. Dont use mage unless your going after metals. And even then Zamorak Hasta is BiS against them.
---
didn‚Äôt ask but yeah thanks mate
---
Well if I were doing it wouldn't be complaining about it anymore, I'd be on the other side of the scenario. But I'm not a PKer and never will be so although I can understand why it's done I can still appreciate how annoying it is
---
You‚Äôll make money when you unlock gargoyles, kurasks, and skeletal wyverns. Just keep grinding
---
Not sure but it probably wouldn‚Äôt hurt.

&gt;I have someone stuck in a tele-other right now and they've stayed logged in for 30+ minutes. When I attempt to trade them, I received the message "Other player is busy at the moment." Could this justify reporting them?

me after getting 99 prayer not too long ago. sold my full bandos and all my zenyte accessories(3 of them).

Wildy slayer is good gp and so is Konar for mid levels. You don't have to be high Slayer to make a good amount of gp from it, but it obviously helps.

Hm, I guess I'm wrong, I'm going to go try and figure this out.

I personally disagree with purple being my favourite colour (seriously, there's never enough purple for me.) But I'd love to see those colors used for something else and appreciate all the thought put into getting to them~

Made me chuckle take an upvote

Make the clamp a breakable and drop coins for winner

Definitely agree the icon should be the lantern, fits thematically with the other production skills

Ok. The way you worded it makes it sound like you're disagreeing with mango, but no harm done.

99 Runecrafting

I didn't know this is a thing. The bots are evolving.

I pretty sure that‚Äôs the idea.  It‚Äôs just 10M BH to replace instead of paying to fix it.
---
Lol I wonder how much an ad on this sub costs
---
Dharoks is inefficient at NMZ below ~92 HP. Obsidian armor and sword with berserker necklace is better. Even max str gear with abby dagger/bludgeon is better before high HP levels.
---
$11
---
Really?? I thought it was always lost of death. Well that would be good
---
Teleport to house is closer and a million times more convenient than bringing Cape tho
---
Fresh content doesn't imply good content.
---
I feel ya. Good night!
---
The attachment is lost on death.  You have to buy a replacement for ~5M
---
Grats, best skill in the game.
---
Pretty sure dharoks is only viable when you have like 95 hp, and I think a dscim will give more exp/hr than dharoks at low hp
---
Ahh gotcha, I've never really messed with the icons just left them as is, are there different setups that are better? Also thanks :) so glad im done with the oak doors

The playstore doesn't work unforunatly. I can login but the moment I press the red button to play it crashes.

Yea, the ARR main story takes like 80 hours, 1st expansion is like 20, 2nd is about the same and the new one took me 30 to complete. so its plenty of story content along with raids and other fun group stuff.
---
I hear discord notifications all the time in youtube videos and I check every time

Why? Osrs is OLD SCHOOL
---
Please do watermelons with nasturtium in the flower patch. The xp is huge and the money you make making ultracompost is significant. Im 99 farming and I never spent a cent on any seeds except watermelons, kwarms and cantadines. I made 10s of millions in a relatively short time. Also, kill the hespori every 30 hours. Killing and harvesting it 100 times is about 10% of the xp to 99.

u/moxieinside lmao

I am more intrigued by why you have taken birdhouses to dorg

Nigga, what?

I think they added a wise old man clear quest junk thing but it‚Äôs still so shit I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs what and I‚Äôm still not convinced myself lmao main and iron
---
Personally I could support a cyan type color (turquoise maybe?) For the cape,  but with the current logo a purple ish would work best imo (or just use a different icon all together) .
---
A cape with cyan and purple would really make it stand out from the rest, while still being pretty flashy.
---
But in the end I really don't have any absolute opinions on the color scheme, not my expertise and I'll never have the skill cape, so nothing to get worked up about.
---
It would be a good way for Jagex to gather data on confirmed botters.
---
Farming. Making and selling ultracompost, various herbs, coconuts, potato cacti and poison ivy seeds are very profitable with minimal effort. Do farming contracts for the seeds.
---
I find your heavy focus on aesthetic interesting, as that's the *complete* opposite to myself. I'm 100% functionality driven: doesn't matter what it looks like, so long as it *works* and *works well*. I'd love to hear your opinion on some of the other proposed aesthetic changes for Warding. Specifically [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cfvbi8/alternate_warding_icon/) Do you think the lantern would be a better fit for the icon, or are you attached to the current purple scheme?
---
If you're gonna be this condescending then go make political statements on Twitter or something
---
I just wanna see an OSRS spin on Bosch (the artist not the show)
---
Yes, but no. Green + black trimmed. Omni color has to be white.

D scim as others have said, but dlong if you don't want to quest. Would advise you to go for d scim though.

And Delete system32 to get 200m xp in all skills

it‚Äôs still telling people how they should vote.
---
MTX were never polled? Are you sure about that?
---
True, and you're right, many of them probably have some kind of mental issues or hardships in life that they may be running from. I was just talking about this specific person. In retrospect my original comment probably didn't fit too well in this thread
---
Wtf even is warding this shit ain‚Äôt old school smh
---
Dude
---
It's "Our ... dead"
---
I don't think it would be bad in any way, but I think once the training meta is set for a skill,it's unecessary to add any real variety only for training. Also the fact that thieving has a minigame that is viable, something not every skill has.
---
Ah fair enough, just would prefer a slight change of scenery and some progression for those who choose to pickpocket, thanks for the reply
---
Oof you got downvoted but the joke here is that the gambling bots all look the same and wear the same things

mfw i put iron in my name while being a normal account to get free help with monsters and bosses

Sailing sounds 100% cooler than motherfucking warding
---
&gt;&gt;What level player are you?
---
&gt;One level higher than you.
---
It was a real question
---
First offences are 2 week bans. Second offence is perm. The only botting bans that are perm first offence are botting for ranks (continue botting a skill post 99) or accounts that have only been botted and no legitimate (or very little legitmate) training has been done on the account.

Nvm theres a set of stairs near by lmao

Like seriously why would I can crafting when I could get hoes on my runescape yecht

I see this misconception a lot. EoC was out before RS3. RS3 describes the graphics, camera and interface overhaul you see in the modern game.

For someone who was in love for 5 years with this man and is going through a harsh breakup, easier said than done. It can take months to get over it and her platform to get it out is likely online. I had a friend who had a breakup with his fiance and he was down for 2-3 months, visibly off. I don't agree with this.
---
What a meanie you just wanted to help üò° smh

But what is the scam?!

It's cuz you get tokkul for it not gp

Can you elaborate pls

These high quality/effort memes are getting out of hand. Seriously amazing job
---
It costs upwards to 20m perhaps even more from 60
---
**NO TIME GATING.**
---
There are better ways of limiting frequency.
---
Similar to how very good monsters/ content in Slayer don't come up *constantly*, similar to how as an ironman you can't just plant your best trees for farming all the time, similar to how raids has scouting, similar to how God wars requires killcount on certain things, Alchemical Hydra requires those keys (I think? I've not done it)
---
Super neat post!

Too bad warding will never be in oldschool runescape

Wowee

they family-member has an account that was recently unbanned after being hijacked and used for, what seems to be, a green dragon-bot as it was in the wilderness when we randomly logged in after months, maybe a year.  I‚Äôm seriously curious if it has a chance to be mistakingly banned after this, as he recently got back into  game and is grinding alot and i don‚Äôt want to see him lose his progress.
---
Thank you all for any info!
---
Same thing happened to me. Permanently banned in 2010 then 2018 was unbanned. I knew it was 2018 as I checked the account early 2018 and was still banned. Then later in the year I checked again and it was unbanned.
---
Lmao considering in that CC someone was bragging about voting no because ‚Äúhe likes wasting dev time‚Äù thats hilarious
---
No it's a massive bot dump, only way to get the price that low
---
Sorry to say but hosting is just something that's not worth it. The same guy, Drew G, has been hosting his house for like a year straight. People literally pay millions to have their house hosted.

Block em shit xp
---
I did and it‚Äôs not the dance itself that‚Äôs supposed to be intimidating, it‚Äôs to show gang affiliation. Apparantly it‚Äôs also used as a signature after a killing or to signal a coast clear for a robbery. The meaning behind the dance is intimidating and not the dance itself.
---
Whats your zulrah killcount?
---
Pretty much the camp i'm in. Its funny seeing the difference in reaction when a No meme is on the front page compared to a yes meme.. cos they can't downvote to get rid of it haha. Bit ironic really :)
---
Slayer garbage for money until later
---
Make an ironman
---
From 72 to 83 con I used 13k Mahogany planks making mahogany tables. When I met my 83 goal I had 2100 mahogany planks left. That costed me 22mil. Then on top of that, the items required for all the good stuf totaled out to 17-21mil ( l didn‚Äôt keep track of that sorry, but that‚Äôs about right)
---
Not all bosses. For bosses with multiple phases like KQ, Telos, Inferno Boss , it only takes out one phase per dart.  They don't work on Raids Bosses, and some newer bosses like Solak, and some Quest bosses like Sliske. I find them useless since anything they can kill is easily killable , i got 15 darts just wasting away in my bank.
---
Apparently the concept exists in other RPGs, along with the term "warding", though it seems most players aren't familiar with this reference.

Ali the nice try
---
I love you!
---
Have you done: waterfall quest, dragon slayer, fight arena, tree gnome village, monkey madness, vampyre slayer and death plateau quests? These quests give you a great amount of combat xp and can all be completed within a few hours. 
---
Your strength should be high than your attack, as strength is what calculates your max hit and that in turn increases your dps and xp/hr
---
So I‚Äôve got my first cave kraken task. What‚Äôs the Meta? Do I kill the boss or just the little ones? Also what welfareish gear should I use (83 magic - have occult but nothing really else). Cheers!
---
Reward rewarding rewards
---
Hunter is good once you get to chincompas, fishing is pretty afk money, mining is decent over time. Try some bosses out with the combat skills you got from slayer like the giant mole. I think fletching can be profitable although not much. Basically every skill has a profitable path to leveling up
---
Would ruin acc builds
---
Ik im just kidding, this is my first time doing barrows too I'm really lucky
---
No dude, you‚Äôre just lazy. On the last post I encountered you on, you claimed you could‚Äôve find shops in San Diego that don‚Äôt charge extra to use a card payment.... bro I spent 10 second on google and found thousands of places that accept cards with no fee. You‚Äôre just making shit up. Stop.
---
The VAST majority of new players are f2p, so warding won't bother them at all. The no voters will be too addicted to the game to quit, even if the new skill magically makes everyone hate the rest of the game for some reason. The yes voters will just be happy. Nothing is going to happen to the game one way or the other you dolt
---
Width &gt; length confirmed.
---
I'm going to assume you're talking about finishing Dragon Slayer 2, so sorry if I misunderstood. 
---
You can teleport out after each 'wave' of dragons. The [wiki page here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_Slayer_II#Part_III) goes over pretty well what each wave consists of and when you can teleport out. If you have a dragon hunter crossbow you should be fine killing them, and if you feel like your supplies are low just teleport out after a wave. You don't really need anything special other than good food and maybe a few prayer potions for the normal dragon fights. 
---
For the adamant and rune dragons, an important tip is that you can stand underneath them most of the time and let the other guard NPC's do most of the damage, if you feel like you're taking too much damage yourself. 
---
For the Galvek fight, the wiki has a recommended inventory and you can also try looking up a few Youtube videos on how to do the boss fight. It shouldn't take more than a few tries probably, and worst comes to worst you can either teleport out during the fight or just pay 100k to get your stuff back. If you end up struggling a lot on certain phases, try watching videos or reading the mechanics to make sure you're not taking too much unnecessary damage. Good luck!
---
Are you implying 2 days to receive almost any item a person could want is a long time?
---
What account builds would that ruin? Curious?
---
75 att
---
I can definitely see how something as a core part of the game like a skill shouldn't exist soelely as a gold sink. It's unfortunate that the intentions of the skill may be good, but it's crossing the line of what might be considered a bandaid fix as "content". I'm torn on the warding skill myself.
---
Nice analysis, very well though out and explained.
---
I‚Äôd like to throw all the out the window however and go for a nice purple cap with a contrasting yellow/gold trim.
---
I havent played in 6 months but this might make me vote Yes to warding.
---
His wild what?
---
Yeh no they haven't.
---
He‚Äôs entirely right though? I‚Äôve been talking to bustahnugs literally all day on Reddit going back and forth. He‚Äôs probably posted like 50 book length replies today. He is a serial liar, I highly highly doubt he‚Äôs moving or has a dog named nugget or lives in San Diego or anything like that. I honestly find the dude kinda repulsive with the whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so nice but not nice enough to ever just admit I could‚Äôve googled something myself‚Äù. He doubles down on every reply he makes. Just check the history dude.
---
Probably selling gold if you haven't bought 99 prayer yet
---
mainly i do it to be able to wear my dragon pickaxe. so thats No problem
---
When I was fletching I would put in overnight orders for feathers for 2 gp and never would any buy.
---
I guess maybe I just didn't wait long enough.
---
I also remember stripy feathers were 3gp as well which made getting fletching so much easier cuz double buy limit
---
have not done any of those didnt do quests when i played 10 years ago. should i do them insteed of crabs?
---
please no, they'll replace all the nice brick with that nasty ass varrock concrete
---
Yup, apart from work, school and social activities bodybuilding and playing Runescape are the two most time consuming things in my life, that's correct, and I don't feel bad or guilty about that in the slightest. What do you spend your life doing?
---
Must have spoken to Oziach.
---
I play both as well. And Anachronia is shit. (Minus bgh) they added more timegated content and the codex takes 12 hours to get the 2 yourself. The island is huge and there is almost NOTHING to do there.
---
You can drop a rune pouch and pick it up again. The small one at least. I did it a month or two ago and I doubt they‚Äôve changed it since then.
---
I think the other guy played on his smart fridge while his hungry  roommate was constantly opening and closing the fridge in hope something new will appear. GG
---
You sound fun irl
---
Cape of skulls, like 1 in 5000 from easy scrolls
---
in what order would you recommend?
---
I think what people want from sailing is more than transportation. There are a lot of things sailors can do - smuggling, escort, bounty hunting, privateering, raiding, trawling, whaling, distress aid, and treasure hunting.
---
This isn't even mentioning all the kinda of ships that exist. You have caravels, sloops, carracks, barques, brigantines, longships, galleons, and frigates.
---
There is so much raw potential to easily make a content-rich and fun skill such as sailing. Use your imagination, I'm sure you can think of cool things you could do on a boat, too.
---
Plot twist: Runescape was a binge eating simulator this entire time

You're a hero to the community!! Thank for newspaper :^)

Try that new weapon from the spider boss. It's not far off from the abyssal bludgeon in terms of DPS, and the bludgeon is the best DPS at that boss if you don't lower it's defense with a warhammer or bgs spec, so that new weapon shouldn't be far behind. I forget it's name tho. Crudgel or something.
---
I kind of agree with sparcy here, its not really funny for your pet to eat something as dangerous as a screw
---
To be fair if my cat ate a screw it would be going to the vet ASAP not posting it on Twitter, so I can see Sparc Macs point.
---
Nice idea, tbh I liked the beige and Gatorade blue one somebody posted up.
---
Well ur stats are good.
---
What melee weapon you using atm? Whip is fine if you cant afford hasta. Bgs will help alot because it reduces the defense of both phase.
---
It was polled tho
---
People are buying gold for vote yes comment and the only complaint ive seen it towards ore no comments. Seems to me like JaGeX is paying for people to spam vote-yes posts.
---
I didn't do a single level at sand crabs, they are a waste of time imho if you are training your main. You can easily level up your combat by doing quests, slayer and nightmare zone, all of which give you some bonus (drops, points, unlocks etc).
---
By that logic, hackers would just stand outside raids and hack everyone with a tbow/scythe.
---
Simply showing that you have wealth in RuneScape won't get you hacked unless you have no security features on your account
---
I don't even play the game anymore but bought a bond to vote yes regardless.
---
Its F2P, the warding blog mentions it, but isn't super explicit (says creating these would be members only, which implies the beginning stages are F2P.) It is explicitly stated elsewhere, like  the link u/zxv975 posted.
---
For an ironman nmz points are literally useless
---
...Plenty of people are saying exactly that lmao.
---
Ok then
---
Jmods talked about this too on the Q&amp;A 8th of May if you are interested in looking that up, 25 minutes into the Q&amp;A it should be:
---
&gt; Q:Can you please take a critical look at tier 75 weaponry and change or raise the level required based on damage output?
---
.
---
&gt; A: Is the problem with the power balancing of these weapons or the level required to use them? Changing a Twisted bow to something like tier 90 wouldn't change a lot as most people with one have 90+.
---
Amen, this used to be a social game.
---
**Ever think of these gold scammers as Jagex‚Äôs undercover cops enticing shiesty people into buying a hooker?**

You swapped from RS3 to OSRS for a nostalgia trip and now the nostalgia is wearing off you‚Äôre blaming it on new content as if the second you joined the game should have never been updated again. Fuck off you yibb.

This betting strategy is called "[Martingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system))". It rarely works due to the exponential growth of bets required.
---
In saying that, you'll get scammed before you even have the chance to beat the bot. If you Google "osrs gambling bot script" you'll see what I mean (no link provided since it's a botting website). They're setup to scam you.
---
You are gonna be so salty when it doesn't pass :)

You can time clicks to hit them when they come out from the tree.

That‚Äôs like 5 hours?

That shard/crystal thing on top of the Iban staff could of Zarosian origin you never know! Perhaps with this Quest the staff could be upgraded in a zorosian way to neutralise the damage that was caused! And we‚Äôd get a stronger staff!

no magic demons so it doesn't matter.... but maging is not sustainable on HCIM, runes are too expensive/time consuming to make. Instead, rush lost tribe so u have access to bone crossbow. MUCH CHEAPER! and sustainable.
---
Now that would be awesome! Great idea!
---
I found the Smooth Brain..
---
hey hey people, Seth here
---
How about "so the results can be legit either way" üôÑ
---
Good point. Although it never happened to me, that I cannot help you with haha
---
Interesting, but fletching can be easily zero timed to 99 while doing other activities
---
I think the colour you selected, and the others that aren‚Äôt in game are like that for a reason. Because they are ugly. I also think that the warding logo is just stupid looking and sticks out like a sore thumb. Why the circle? The design just needs some work, and the colour of the cape is fine as grey and purple to me.
---
How can you be this lucky. Really annoying when there are people with over 100x your kc dry. Genuinely salty right now.
---
But look how adorably excited the developers are about it
---
Im assuming you cant buy it in the auction house? And if the mini game has no req how comd its not showing in the mini game list?
---
Got 77 prayer for Augury between orders on night shift tonight xD
---
OSRS bonds can only get you membership. RS3 bonds can also give u tokens to play on Treasure Hunter = paying for bonus exp and stuff.
---
U really think these bots are the odds advertised lololol
---
I actually have and enchanted trident of the swamp will that do? I was also suggested switching to range for one of the brothers would you recommend the same?
---
Me explaining to gf we can't leave for the event we're late for cuz some fucking twink with full justicar fucked me over at dks and I need to run back for my stuff
---
True, but North  Americans and brits seem to have this weird obsession with using different fonts and umlauts, and accents in their names. Just go on twitter for 20 minutes and look at people's names. Maybe it's cause English naturally lacks them. 
---
Remember one thread where some guy pointed out the dude on the 10RSD note was  Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, where the first reply to the comment was "Ah yes, √´√ø√ªƒØ≈ì√¶√ü≈Ç≈æ√ß√±"
---
Don't know how he got caught tbh, I recently posted 99 fishing and cooking on my ironman, botting is back baby.
---
Using mithril darts is a waste of scales.
---
To be fair, If someone pays for 5 accounts should they not be allowed 5 votes?
---
He has a point but it's also smart to get your combat up a lil before going to members.  
---
No point to pay for membership only to get 1 shotted by moss giants during waterfall quest.  
---
If you do become a member immediately, do witch's house first before waterfall for some hp boost.
---
Looks like they prayin mage when they should have been praying ranged
---
Bowl of spaghetti os.... brilliant
---
diving without flippers on fossil island currently automatically toggles your run energy, is it possible to have it automatically unequip weapons if you have space in your inventory?
---
im mobile only, so double that amount
---
Damn that's not a lot of herbs for mills of xp don't think I'll be doing herbi
---
Your thick head isn't getting the point. I'll break it down for you. First of all the guy was comparing kids and pets in the aspect of preparing before adoption or birth. You want to make sure you have the financial stability to own a pet same goes for a kid, you want to make sure you're stable in life to care for it. And second you don't have to have surgery every single time if it's not going to harm the animal. And if it is I'm willing to make that sacrifice and sell everything I have because my pets are everything to me. And let's not forget the part about him posting online about how his animal ate something that could potentially kill it and laughing about it. It's like laughing at a kid for swallowing a battery and posting it online. Both could very easily kill either the kid or the animal.
---
If I play 20 hours a day on a single account should my vote count more than once? Play time shouldn't add more voting power
---
Turns out that plenty of OSRS players don't actually like RS and are just addicted.
---
Vote yes to trigger the purists.
---
Play ironman then loser
---
Honestly I dont want warding unless its purple. Unpopular opinion but theres no true purple cape. Either change cooking or thieving to a nicer purple or keep wardings og design plz
---
You could have voted yes on 3 and no on the other to not influence the vote
---
No worries man, I don't specifically state I'm talking about partnerships anyway so I can see where the confusion stemmed from.
---
At least it's not 70rc
---
and so does this, its a funny and entertaining thing to do, good a reason as any.
---
I love it
---
Iirc it's about 80-100m in Cballs and supplies.
---
That's also not taking into account the time you could be making money instead.
---
Have you any ideas on making the voting system less corrupt, people offering go for votes, people using 10 accounts to make their own personal votes etc?
---
The thing is. When you look at the skills in vanilla your eyes don't really get pulled to a specific skill as they're all quite subtle colours. But with the purple warding logo, your eyes are instantly drawn to look at it every time
---
And imagine being in ur first kill of a trip (ihad been there for hours) and getting mad at someone for showing up on kill number 1, then that someone apologizing cus they didn't realize ur an ironman, and afterwards he's still made. Boy musta been hurting for some zammy wines.
---
Is that a crimson charm?? Dammmm havent seen one in years
---
This
---
I like the idea. Maybe you could learn the fine art of bankrobbing from the wise old man? Isn't he supposed to be responsible for the Draynor Village bank robbery?
---
fmod calling someone else a brainlet, classic.
---
The lamp makes more sense wouldnt it? Probably would look another FM skill though
---
Ah alright
---
ya sadly there is only a few that have a matching color mostly the black and white ones. and the gilded and fake bronze trim lol.
---
id love if they just expanded this with at least chest pieces.
---
Some people even suggest new crest that show off boss kills.
---
id kill for a KBD crest set.
---
Baited
---
I'd imagine if you turn on gpu acceleration it does. But I must admit I don't know for sure, just going off the fact that it's called gpu acceleration.
---
The fact that ‚Äúvote no to warding‚Äù is being jammed down my throat like a 12 inch bwana pp, has made me vote yes just because of that.
---
I think that's just teenagers though. I guess you could broaden your statement to just include all Latin-alphabet-using-cheap-on-extra-√±√∏√Æ≈ü√Ω-chars languages
---
Also hhehe vuk
---
That's what Im doing. Lobsters.
---
Runelite has a plugin for enabling gpu rendingering
---
Fossil Island absolutely fucking tanks my computer. I'd guess it's too many polygons on screen simultaneously, those mushrooms are killer.
---
A man of culture, I see.
---
Yep, he's the one that gave me this idea. That and pick pocketing a knight in a bank for two hours..
---
That are us really badly designed, too much shit on screen basically.  
---
Only thing you can really do is turn GPU plugin on and lower render distance, I keep it at around 30 for herbiboar and even then get occasionally stutters.
---
oh shit oh fuck a meteor
---
Hey I could use some Help if you could (sorry hijacked) when at demonic gorillas on runelite the game likes freezes for a split second every couple of seconds but when I restart runelite it works fine ? Gets really annoying / makes me fuck up
---
Show me the proof.
---
According to the skilling discords it can be worth doing in some scenarios. Which to me says a lot, as they are only concerned with very efficient methods.
---
What?
---
I'm prematurely asking this because (if I'm not mistaken) the Warding poll will have finished by the time this QnA is filmed...
---
What are the next steps for warding? This can be asked for all three results... 
---
If it's **passed**, how will it be developed and what sort of timeline are you thinking about
---
If it's **just about failed by a minimal amount**, are you going to tweak it and hope it stays as a new skill or slot it into current skills
---
If it's **failed substantially**, are you still going to put some aspects of it into OSRS, or scrap the majority or ideas?
---
Follow-up: I assume (and hope) not, but is this it for new skill ideas for the foreseeable future (whether it's passed or not)?
---
Sneak: 100
---
Ahhh... thanks for making it more clearer!
---
For context sparc mac was annoyed because he had a cat that died because of choking
---
You can also use Preserve for 90 seconds of boosted stats, but that might not be necessary. Wait, could you make it from Edgeville to the Water Alter in 90 seconds? That might also be an option in that case.
---
It wouldn't feel new or fresh.. It's just a bank standing clicking inventory and watch Netflix skill. It's basically just fletching, crafting V2. When Hunter came out now that felt new and fresh. Completely unique way of training the skill, lots of new areas, music tracks, and items, including items that help train other skills and can make you lots of money like chins and lizards. Warding compared to that is terrible. And with all of our years of accumulated knowledge and development history it's a shame for something so simple and basic to be taking up dev time and resources. I'm not against a new skill, I just want it to feel like a valuable logical progression to the game.
---
Umm, objectively no? 
---
3/4 &gt; 1/2
---
Look at the posts above. I have been doing animal husbandry my entire life. I have watched many dogs and cats live and die. Many pigs sheeps goats cows chickens deers bears cougars and lots of other animals as well. I believe because I grew up in a rural part of the country on a farm, I am a lot more in tune with the realities of life and death for animals than you. 
---
On a farm animals are money. They aren‚Äôt pets. Yes the barn cat is a pet, and many cats and dogs have been some of my very best friends. But if I got attached to every single Wilbur in the pig pen, my life would‚Äôve been very difficult. Charlottes web isn‚Äôt real life man. In real life, you slaughter the runt. It might sound ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù to you, but I am sure you‚Äôre the type who gets prebutchered meat from the deli and doesn‚Äôt think twice about that ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù act that took place before you could eat it. Your idea of animal life is incredibly childish, like I‚Äôm a father explaining the hardships of life and death to a young boy saddened by harsh realities.
---
Ok. How?
---
What‚Äôs fascinating is Fransisco Goya painted this and over a dozen other on the walls of his house... they were not intended to be seen or found, they were discovered when he died. This type of artwork is classified as dark romanticism and the paintings collectively known as The Black Paintings. I love that art
---
How do you knoooowww
---
She is way out of that kid's league
---
Oh, absolutely! But that wasn't why players left back in the day. So that's not what they set out to avoid
---
Getting sick of these memes
---
Are you implying they‚Äôre not?
---
PIVVVVAAAAAAHHHHTTTTTT
---
im in ;)
---
People complained about it looking like a house portal, so they changed it to a circle.
---
Worth looking up the video if they have it on youtube, this part was at 14m 30s on the the Q&amp;A - 25th Oct 2017. 
---
I guess for alts they would see the IPs and billing/playstyle/computer-fingerprint or anything to link them to one single owner.
---
Being paid to vote, I think they'd be able to see who hasn't ever voted in anything and then randomly votes in that poll. Or people would just claim to have voted. 
---
It's also worth remembering that if one side is playing dirty the other may too, if both for/against have people with alts then they all kinda balance out. 
---
Maybe manipulation or streamer influence etc was more of a thing at the time when we could SEE poll results because if it was close then streamers and people would put in more effort to persuade people.
---
Use a bonecrusher bro
---
normal humans
---
Level 2 Herblore... is that even possible?
---
He stalled you
---
Best one yet!!
---
i voted yes but you gotta appreciate the kind of paid sponsorship where people keep reposting the ad in the sub it's related to for free.
---
this guy is a genius in advertisement.
---
Jelly?
---
LOL
---
With mom's credit card yes
---
I respect your opinion and you are free for the rest of your life to do as you wish with you animals. If you desire to spend lots of money saving them in times of crisis, I commend you for your magnificent compassion. I will, however, be saying farewell to the poor cat who ate the screw, and getting a new one. I am sorry you cannot dear with death in this way. One day unfortunately, you will probably have to. Good luck!
---
mfw I put iron in my name to make myself into an iron axe so I can alch myself
---
Sorry I'm no expert. I was just offering some generic trouble shooting. Basically just lowering settings is all I can think of. If restarting the client fixes it for you it might be some kind of memory leak issue, but I've never heard of that issue with runelite so no idea if it's true. If I was you if try low detail mode at gorillas and if that doesn't work just always remember to restart before a trip I guess.
---
Hello, this is Chris Hanson
---
Consistently upsetting 49% of the game's playerbase is a great way to destroy the game. 75% is safer and we've been getting an absolute fuck tonne of great updates regardless of that threshold anyway. 
---
And you are incorrect, many democratic processes - particularly when making big systemic changes like a change to a constitution - require more than a 51%.
---
Pretty damn cheap, dunno why there's not a adds selling gfs from venezuela for gp
---
Is OSRS stagnating? We get shit loads of updates...
---
thumbwhoring for votes
---
B ring if you imbue it.
---
Loosely and in a few sentences; I just don't feel that the skill fits into the game. It feels too much of a big change to me. To me the concept isn't a skill that makes sense like other typical skills (woodcutting to cut trees and gain wood, hack bushes etc... Thieving to allow you to steal things). 
---
Buyable or self-sourced buyable skills - like Crafting and Smithing - are boring and I think there are cooler skills that we can make.
---
I'd prefer any of the things coming from Warding, to simply be polled as standalone things or folded in elsewhere like RC, Crafting, Smithing or a minigame.
---
Obviously all subjective (and apologies to anyone that will counter my points above, it's bedtime for me!) but that's just my $0.02 on where I stand with Warding!
---
"sorry you cannot deal with death in this way"
---
You are a Sociopath and need serious help. Vets literally hate people like you.
---
Yeah I don't think you should have pets.
---
Not taking the animal to the vet is cruel, and you should have emergency funds covering unforseen expenses for your pet.
---
You should view your pets as a family member, so you can just go fuck yourself.
---
You don't have good arguments, just a ton of words to try to justify your shitty views.
---
And I'm not American.
---
He'll just make slapping your ass into a new exception
---
2 hours watching porn??? I can last about round of zulrah when i have to empty my ore sacks
---
Armour has weight, which reduces how long you can run for
---
Why?
---
When can we get blue tooth mouse support on mobile??
---
That's fair. We clearly were talking about 2 different things and that's why we weren't seeing eye to eye. The only reason why I would personally pay for the cat surgery is because it would have been my fault and I wouldn't be able to live with myself. But if for example what you said the cat fell out of the tree and had body parts falling out then I would definitely put it down
---
Sell archer ring, get trident and occult. You shou√∏d use magic on 5 of them. And use rabge pn ahrim. Archer ring is not worth it for you atm
---
Completely agree with this, Menaphos was my final straw. barely any content which they tried to hide behind the rep grind.
---
Get an occult necklace. Increases damage%
---
Now how can I pk f2p as a weekend evening activity!
---
What magic level do you need for that?
---
I did not make this and I apologize for whoever was the OP. If anyone knows who it was, tag them and give them some love.
---
I haven't even seen where they've said that.
---
But if true, then yeah.
---
This skill doesnt fit at all final marks loll
---
Yea I am ranging ahrim
---
I thought that was a razorblade on the left. Still not sure what it is... a ticket?
---
And if most people dont have the money for pets... Most people shouldn't keep pets.
---
But the answer is right there? What is this test???? Americans
---
You're gonna have to defend the claim of gamebreaker tho.
---
300 chompy kills are literally a few hours
---
The diaries give an improved chance -50% so 1/125
---
I'm taking OP at their word, but you're probably right to think we shouldn't assume anything is true until we read it for ourselves.
---
Also the fact that something is ready to be polled usually means it's closer to a finished product than just a design. So if you don't like the current concept of it, I doubt they'll smooth it out enough for you to like it later.
---
Yah... Stealing creation helped.
---
Remember the legends that stole the rotten potato?
---
Really wish he wouldn't have posted it in a "funny" manner on Twitter then or defended himself as completely innocent tho :/ I know he hated sparc Mac but that doesn't really justify it
---
If you aren't sure what to vote in Warding poll, do not vote at all. But I HIGHLY recommend reading the [**official Warding blog**](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/warding-blog?oldschool=1#_ga=2.191071138.940746376.1563719479-2034607474.1529754380) which explains the skill very well what it is all about. Then after you have read it, you could make your mind what to vote.
---
I do not mind do you vote yes or no - as long you voted based on YOUR opinion, I am happy.
---
Use should use mage on karils. Archer ring is not worth it for you √¶, when you can get occult/trident
---
Ancient effigies were a placeholder item, when will these be removed from the game?
---
Amen.
---
People unfortunately vote no on what *they* want, not what is generally good for the game as a whole.
---
I'm sure a lot of people voted no on Inferno simply based off the fact they'll never be able to do it.
---
Genius
---
It's better at 99 cooking and high-ish fishing
---
oh yeah - i know. In case its not obvious - this its a kind of experiment.... its a Reddit's opinion poll :)
---
I wouldn't necessarily say that a new skill affects everyone. There are people with 1 RC who are completely unaffected by the RC skill.
---
If someone wants to level Warding, they will do it. If they don't want to level it, then they won't.
---
As the person you replied to -- yes, I believe people can look at situations with differing views but both without malice.
---
It's just...assuming basic food and shelter needs are already met, what better use for money than to save a being you love &amp; who loves you?
---
I think you‚Äôre too emotional and irrational. Saying my views are ‚Äúshitty‚Äù and ‚Äúa ton of words‚Äù isn‚Äôt an argument against. You can really tell when someone has no argument when they just attack your character instead of the merit of what  you said. I told you I‚Äôd never treat an animal with cruelty. My pets never suffer. I buy them lots of toys and expensive food. I groom them and exercise them. I take great care of my pets whom I adore. That still wouldn‚Äôt make me spend more than like $100 on a vet visit. Sorry.
---
Yeah it's not that serious dude
---
I saw zulrah in the flax fields once
---
Removing runelite would be very risky. And imo not needed.
---
Read the blog post
---
Yeah and don't be too rational with this lunatic just because they use a strawman to get you to agree with them.
---
It's like when this retard talked about shelling out all possession to save a pet. Or saving a dog over a human.
---
These are all strawman arguments that totally ignore the point.
---
If you have pets you need to be able to afford them. If you can't afford pets, don't get them. Don't be surprised when people who deeply love animals, which is an extremely normal human behaviour, are prepared to pay in excess of $3000 to keep them alive. Because they can afford it and because they love them.
---
They do this people for sure hop around outside CoX writing names down.
---
74% of people being angry that the game didn't change isn't as bad as 49% being angry the game had a major change they didn't like.
---
Me, yesterday I haven‚Äôt 6 hour logged in years
---
I mean weapons, not armor.
---
The only magical weapons available to F2P players aren't craftable anyways (the regular staves), and melee weapons can be crafted with Smithing.
---
However, Ranged weapons and ammo aren't craftable by any means for F2P players.
---
Probably because they have data suggesting account security is not the number one reason people leave their game. Their are definite improvements to be made, but most people who get hacked did something extremely dumb. If you have a unique email with a unique password, authenticator, bank pin, and don't click every link you see on Facebook, you'll be fine.
---
If Warding fails by a substantial amount I'd be highly surprised if we ever have a skill proposed for OSRS again. Sailing failed by only 7% and it took 4 years for another skill to be polled. As cool as adding a new skill would be, be that Warding or a future skill, the reality is that it's difficult to justify the expenditure to bring a skill to the polls when they've proven so divisive.
---
Never said it was.
---
&gt; lower price than saving its life
---
the first thing is not being a fucking idiot and leaving screws randomly lying around ?????????????
---
My guess: never.
---
Totally thought this was NSFW from the thumbnail. Glad I clicked it though.
---
You do know bridding was a thing before DMM?
---
They probably assume it would never even get close to 75%
---
Could you please designate a world as a social agility world? It's much more fun when there are people to race. I've been training a bit recently but there are usually 0-2 others on the course and it's not much fun hopping to find more people.
---
No. Reds and even grey chins are plenty fast enough. I only use blacks for arma.
---
Son can you please get a job. Your mother worries about you
---
Oh shit I hadn't thought of that. BRB grinding 76 RC.
---
And by BRB I mean, if I'm lucky and I grind 24/7 I might just get it done by 10AM Thurs.
---
Definitive fact: 99 mage imbued heart spaghetti staff
---
Literally everything that isn't that: use the dps calc, figure out for yourself what is best. I know that isn't really an answer but part of the game is being able to figure this stuff out for yourself
---
Is it possible to add an optional orb that when pressed makes any additional action register as a right click? Some content like abyssal sire is legit impossible due to the huge right click delay.
---
I didn‚Äôt kill him, my arm did!
---
Wake up sheeple
---
Now you can Farm double wrath runes all day for sweet gp's. :)
---
As someone who had 99 summoning back in the day, pking with a pack yak was dope. I dont really understand why people hated summoning however I was very rich in the game at that point maybe that's why I didnt mind.
---
Well yes, Jagex will as it's hitting them directly in the pocket. Plus I'm not the only one who feels this way, I know of multiple maxed players who have 0 interest in warding and intend on quitting the game upon it's release, which again has an effect on Jagex.
---
Great post. Hope Jagex sees and takes into consideration, as I agree about the current colors matching existing content.
---
Depends on your mage lvl. If above ~78, swamp trident is better than fire wave with sotd/smoke staff and tome. If above ~82ish then sea trident is also better. 
---
Surge has different cutoffs that I don't know.
---
Someone hasnt done mm2
---
Okay but why are all of your videos actually masterpieces???
---
When you shit your pants for an xp record
---
Fair, carry on
---
With passive birdhouse xp and red chins I got 5 levels pretty fast within a day or 2 not really trying and only hunting like 30 min at a time. I would set a goal of catching X amount of red chins so that I wasn't thinking about xp. They are around 1.3k ea so it's decent gp for what it is.
---
it's not that, i'd just like to be able to do the content solo without having to tick-eat perfectly for 30 mins.
---
It's to do with your phone settings, search for something along the lines of background apps. If you're using an iphone then you may be outta luck
---
That is an unbelievably unreal standard. If they animal is not visibly suffering, there is no way at all to hold an individual culpable for ‚Äúneglect and abuse‚Äù - by your own admission they were unaware of the suffering, and are unable to know the animals feelings.
---
In such a case should I be taking my cat in every day, since who knows maybe he‚Äôs hurting and I don‚Äôt know, better go make sure otherwise I‚Äôm abusive - this seems like an unrealistic standard.
---
One could argue that allowing an animal to visibly suffer for a long period is neglecting the animal, but requiring a vet visit is for the mere unknown possibility that the creature is invisibly suffering is an impossible standard to uphold.
---
Telling me my arguments are shitty is fine, but showing me how they‚Äôre shitty would be better. You tried to do that here, I‚Äôve countered. How about show me some respect
---
Everything you‚Äôve described is Google Chrome not Firefox
---
How come when i search Barrows in the GE nothing pops up?
---
Too soon üòî
---
Thats a drop every 53 kills. Holy cow. I thought i was lucky. Good thing the cores are like 6m that adds up
---
Iban‚Äôs blast if you can‚Äôt use a trident! Slayer dart if you can‚Äôt be bothered with doing the quest for iban‚Äôs blast.
---
Thank you, i hate it
---
I am jelly.
---
Did you make friends with my arm?
---
Welcome my man!
---
I will help you all pack your stuff. Please leave now tbh because if thats genuinely your thoughts in regards to the poll not going your way, then you are not worth the 66$ you claim to be subbing (which we all know is absolute bullshit Mr Six Figures LOL). Please alch yourself at your earliest convenience, you absolute mouth breathing cretin.
---
Still. The votes even at the 48 hour mark was over double
---
They've already talked about this in the previous Q&amp;A. The only unknown is the timeline. There will be betas and there will be continious communication with the community during those betas.  
---
If it fails by a minimal amount they'll look at what made it fail and address those issues, before repolling at a later date.
---
If failed substantially, probably just drop it.
---
Keep it up u will get it eventually. And thanks im going to try
---
‚ÄúBased on the fact they‚Äôll never be able to do it.‚Äù  No one thought that.
---
Yup, never trained attack, 48 from quests only.
---
Agree with you here. I honestly would say that the tweet is most likely a lie. I can‚Äôt imagine a cat eating a screw. They can only process meat and are very aware of what is meat and what is not. Only very few things like adhesive, paper, feathers, string are commonly swallowed by a cat. It‚Äôs pretty rare for cats to just eat stuff.
---
Also add in important life things like work/school/socializing.

&gt;Could you please address the issue of cheater clients like RuneLitePlus and Lyzrdlite?
---
 ...and runelite. It's all or nothing mate. Accept the consequences of the convenience you have come to demand.
---
Staves are already a part of Crafting, so it would make logical sense to add the magical armour into Crafting too. I don't think there's too much content in Crafting in comparison to skills like Farming, Hunter or Cooking.
---
It would take much less dev time to add them as an expansion rather than an entire skill.
---
I'm not referring to the 2200 world, but rather the lower level worlds such as 1500 as a level 3 (which requires max) and the 1750 total worlds as a pure.
---
With a 30 prayer bonus protect from melee would be 1 point per 6 seconds, kill them faster than that and you don‚Äôt need potions
---
Doesnt have to be gamebreaking.  An example of an augment could be temporary extra % def bonus vs the undead
---
The people already playing the game?
---
You misinterpret what people mean when they talk about something being 'EoC'. It's a fundemental change in ideology and direction of the game. People aren't literally implying it's the same exact patch as EoC was. Like if someone says 'this patch is cancer', they don't literally mean that the patch is cells dividing uncontrollable.

Your second idea sounded reasonable but I remember summoning being one of those things that were 'the beginning of the end' pre-eoc because of how OP it was and off the rails it got.  However just because you think there can be better does not mean that the skill should not be put in. This skill certainly could be a stepping stone to allowing other new skills(obviously with great thought and polling for them). I'm not saying vote for mediocrity but this seems well thought out and will certainly cause the economy in game to churn from players who don't have as much gold, which would be a positive effect all around. Just my .02!

As i said youre blinded lol

Type in your google.. Slayermusiq1 quest order google doc... This is a list of the quest.. The order you should do them in depending on how you want to do them.. And also has links to YouTube vids for every single quest.. I just got my barrows gloves following this.. Trust me..
---
Who?
---
I dont see how its innovative. It sounds like it's exactly like alching items except it produces a different currency.
---
Underrated
---
Well I respect your views regardless of the fact you‚Äôve shown me zero respect. You have a few points, but I‚Äôm not convinced. Not a single person in this whole thread was able to have a civil discussion with me. It reminded me a lot of political debates where everyone just yells ‚ÄúYOURE RACIST‚Äù at the people they don‚Äôt like, instead of explaining to me why their arguments are right and mine are wrong. Anyway have a nice day.

Hey now what's is wrong in Summoning that ruined original rs and wouldn't fit OSRS even in weaker form or Warding with different name?!
---
That doesn't happen though. As has been mentioned over and over, loads of content passes the polls. When a skill does finally pass the 75% mark (and I'm almost certain it will at some point) we will have been better off waiting for it rather than forcing through something contentious like warding.
---
I see a different reason: Warding has divided the community (at least Reddit community) in two large group which seem comparable. I mean, like 50/50, or 40/60 - not as usual 10/90. There is no one "community opinion" - there are two of them. This is why we see such passions and the poll attract everyone (and everyone's alts too :).
---
Quests and new dungeons and new guilds etc are also very important, but dont give such controversy. And I would say such situation would be with ANY new skill. Doesn't matter if it's about Warding or Sailing or something totally new. Runescape is a game *based* on skills.
---
My only question to you, no voter. Did you read the blog before voting.
---
Yes, Summoning Lite and Imbues: The Skill just totally blow Warding out of the water /s
---
GET THAT GET OUTA MY STREAM
---
They arent the most fun boss. Its can be a long fight 2:30-3:30 min. But i have had decent luck making money off them. And they are decent slayer xp. If i got pet i would never do them again but i dont mind them for now.
---
Ofc lol what tells you we didnt?
---
Nah
---
I speak freedom units, 11 when?
---
Do you do anything else apart from vork? What goals are you going for atm?
---
Read it even twice;p
---
Did i imply you didn‚Äôt?
---
Gz
---
Did you let your browser (chrome) automagically make a password for you?  That seems to be the only other possibility and even that's a stretch as it uses symbols (afaik) and runescape doesnt let ya do that.
---
Pmod smackdown
---
Good to know.
---
Now get 99 fletching and bank stand next to the maxed accounts
---
I'm not sure if it's going to pass but you are completely overestimating the amount of these naysayers. They are outnumbered and downvoted here and almost guaranteed even smaller minority outside reddit.
---
what is this complaint referring to?
---
Yes you all say we didnt read like bitches but fact is you have.no.clue

I have oodles of karma. Downvote away.

Hell yea, now youll be arrested for eating meat in London.

Previously, you discussed migrating the collection/boss log to part of the interface (rather than it being accessible via an item). What is the status of this, please?
---
The irony. Thats settled, no voters are the ones bitching.
---
I‚Äôd be 100% down to vote for this
---
Sick idea
---
How?
---
LOL. Cannot imagine anyone who would leave the game because of a new skill like crafting or RC. If they don't like it, they may leave it to Guthuix - like many do with RC.
---
Honestly, are u trying to say you personally would quit? Sorry, cannot believe you.
---
Well, those people are affected by it, as in they never get a quest cape, nor do they get the hundreds of mills the skill gives you after 77.
---
Which color warding **could** be
---
Vote yes to pvp
---
Cooking lmao
---
Welcome to democracy.
---
They probably don't get banned with a cash stack og 0gp
---
Mmmh k lol
---
3 posts in a month = karma farming
---
You know if they add warding that doesn't preclude adding another skill later?  In fact adding one skill would making adding another easier.
---
I personally think the upgraded armor sets need some numbers tweaked. The melee set in particular seems a little bit mismatched with the helm having 'combined' berserker and warrior helm stats while the other pieces have similar defenses to degradable barrows armor. If the set doesn't degrade, the defenses bonuses should be a little lower than barrows armor. The helmet is probably fine, but just feels a bit out of place considering the other pieces seem so defensively oriented.
---
The ranged and magic sets are a little more digestable. I personally think it might be interesting to see an upgrade to spined armor be designed as 'tanky' range armor since the spined set itself looks bulkier and more protective than most other hide armors--but that's not really a suggestion, just something I like.
---
Otherwise it all makes sense and looks cool to me, you used a strong lore basis for this and it looks like it would give some life to some otherwise near-useless equipment.
---
&gt; has 13 alt accounts to assure any bankstanding skills wont pass
---
That they use to bankstand
---
ok i just did,  your right
---
While I do like the post, that skill cape is so ugly
---
Like what
---
lol, seriously though I think they will just make the skills screen taller to accommodate for the extra skill block.
---
The test polls show only reddit audience. Or twitter or whatever source. There are many players who vote in the game and don't visit such places.
---
I hope so all the neck beards get mad muhahahaha

Ask me if i care LOL
---
no.
---
You‚Äôre already speaking way above my pay grade.
---
It will be f2p as well, because the tier 1 minigame tasks are associated with f2p only NPC's.
---
The opinions overall seem way too split for it to pass. Also from what I've seen, majority of the high level people are voting 'no'. This is just a speculation but I'd imagine the high level people generally do have more alts they vote on compared to those who are still working on their first accounts.
---
75% is pretty much. But we can still hope :).

cmon dont act like you never plowed your teacher man,  we all have ahahaha.   btw the names chad. nice to meet you

You can be assigned them, you need to have boss tasks unlocked. It‚Äôs a pretty low chance but I‚Äôve had them a couple times :)

Slayer helm is bis whenever you're doing slayer, no matter what attack style, unless there's a set effect like guthans/void that you want to use. Slayer helm and other appropriate gear is usually stronger than void tho anyways.
---
The afk method uses super combats so you can afk for 20 minutes. Full Obby with the Obby sword will be better unless you have Full Bandos/Prims/Tort/Rapier.
---
As much as i want it to pass, no i dont think it will, people who vote no have more power over people who vote yes because the passing percentage is 75%, if it were 70% that would be a different story.
---
You really must understand the irony of stomping your foot, whining, and complaining about "going against the circlejerk" while at the same time pretending to be an adult, right?

I also invite you to take a step back and examine why you are getting so upset about this. You seem extremely bent out of shape for someone pretending to not like drama.

I've always liked the looks of the Zaros set myself.

Can Mage Arena get looked into some more. Like, add room for ancient, lunar, and accesussusus spell books.

Yes, make it hard to get points just like normal spell book

The required 75% is to ensure the quality of the updates. Splitting the community in half for a 51% result wouldn't be very productive.

This is the second time I've slayed Skotizo on any account (just trying to learn) and I'm pretty happy with this drop.. 1/2500 which is just crazy because it could take ages to get enough totems for close to 2,500 kc.  Hoping the rest of the RNG works out too for completion log. : )
---
Yeah lol unsure how it got that nickname but it did and I like it
---
Don‚Äôt forget that crooked ass fench.
---
I'd buy
---
Black chins are better if you are 90 range.
---
I liked Aquatic Bane but I think the lack of clarity is what hurt it. Personally, I'd call it "Waterbirth Bane" or such and focus it more on Dagannoth, Wallaski, and Rock Crabs (the three Waterbirth creatures), which also would mean it would be useful on training on Rock Crabs too.
---
Not if you have 35m
---
Skotizo finished 2KC not bad, not bad.

I like how the Cancer symbol is the unofficial warding emoji

Stop responding if you don't wanna waste your time then, you're on Reddit.

You should be okay, what i would do for sure though is get an app that tests your battery health, if you play games on a phone that much youre gonna notice your battery is losing its health faster, only thing you can do is get it replaced.
---
Could we get a notice board on the side of one of the buildings in Edgeville, close to the Wilderness ditch?
---
This notice board would be, "THE LAWS OF THE WILDERNESS". It will state every unique property/interaction that exists within the wilderness, for example (can't teleport past 30 wilderness, can't teleport past 20 wilderness unless with a glory amulet and other items, unprotected untradable items will turn into coins on death past level 20 wilderness, untradable items will break on death under level 20 wilderness and will need to be repaired, dropped items will become visible to other players immediately, on PvM deaths your loot will be visible to only yourself for 1 minute instead of 60, special attack orb does not work, and all other unique properties of the wilderness etc.)
---
This is all vital information that should be accessible in-game. Upon entering the Wilderness (or first time only), you will get a warning suggesting you to read "The Laws of the Wilderness" noticeboard in Edgeville, this warning can be toggled off.
---
Same. Reddit's warding circle jerk made me go vote no with an alt, after voting yes on main.
---
I think the proposed defense for rockcrusher armor might be a little too high. It would probably significantly lower the value of tank barrows armor. I think having defensive bonuses similar to dragon legs/chain is fair since those are already cheap. Then with the bonus against waterbirth creatures it would be more effective than barrows armor. Just my opinion though, great idea and thanks for putting this together!
---
Mac addresses would be better but they can still be spoofed easy these days
---
That's fine, I was just letting you know in case you wanted to be even more afk than 5 minutes.
---
Thanks. I hate it.
---
Multiple saved logins would be nice. John c talked about it at one point on stream
---
Chasing that pet now! Pretty common I think so it shouldn't be an issue.
---
Incredibly pathetic and sad OP has to vote no on all their alts. Voting yes and hoping the banhammer finds him on OSRS.
---
Never said playtime should. Just that you could make the argument that players more invested in the game should have more sway. But I don't expect that would be widely supported.
---
There are plenty of useful skill cape perks
---
so you just want rs3, gotcha.
---
I'd say it's more likely to pass, Reddit definitely doesn't represent the player base of the game completely. A lot of osrs players might still be new and/or don't pay attention to Reddit. If they choose to vote they might say "oh hey, a new skill, awesome I could make magic armor that sounds really cool" proceeds to vote Yes. They are really good at wording poll questions to make them sound more interesting, we saw that in the partnership poll which I think was like 40% yes? that's just what I heard. Correct me if I am wrong there. Either way I'd say it will pass or at least come pretty damn close this time around. If they go for a reevaluation/repoll later in the future it will pass for sure is my guess.
---
I get they wanted to base it off of the fight caves, but if they just cut out the waves before the mager it would be more reasonable imo
---
Join a clan! You can find active ones on the forums with requirements that you meet :)
---
I agree, would be interesting. Probably really quick games too
---
Since when is a ranged skill Cape useful? I‚Äôve not used mine once as 99% have Ava‚Äôs devices
---
TBH props to you for not deleting the post lol
---
I did a solo run at 101 combat. Took 1hr30mins and got fuck all points, but meant I didn't have to leach and was good fun learning some solo techniques for future runs
---
I know you didn't lol but "people hated it" is a weird generalization
---
Ohh god I got an Ingress flashback from this.
---
Bankstanding skills are skills you just buy supplies on ge and skill right there.
---
\**this dude eating his son\** lolol i love/hate this community
---
Some perks are definitely better than others. That said, I don't think Attack is useful even if you are going for 200M; it is just nice to stock up on more defenders.
---
Personally, I think the best perks are capes like Cooking. Never Burning Food is very relevant to the focus on the skill and if you are going to use Cooking post-99, it is a useful perk to have. Woodcutting is almost there; a better nest chance is nice for Woodcutting post-99 since it adds a bit more profit, but it is a bit too minor to feel worthwhile. Capes like Crafting are kinda terrible since the point of adding perks was so you'd have a reason to use the capes while doing the skills; Crafting is just a glorified Ring of Dueling for a quick bank, useful overall but not really useful for Crafting.
---
I support this I hate the purple if I had to look at that everyday I'd be pissed
---
rock man bad?
---
Make sure you‚Äôre doing a normal rumble if you want to afk for longer. I do full obsidian with those same bosses and last 6 hours per inventory without lowering my health. 6 super combats and the rest absorbs.
---
I added up the yes and no votes from both the Reddit and Mod Ash Twitter poll and from about 26k respondents it was at 68% Yes, excluding skips. I realise there's some overlap and that it's not by any means a decent sample, but I'd be quite surprised if it passed - even if you expect non-social media users to be more pro-Warding, it's a big gap to cover. I think 72% Yes.
---
We have Dagon'hai robes? Can you please DM me on how to go about getting them so I can be the first one in-game?
---
What was your herblore level when you did this grind? The herb drops are better with higher herblore levels.

I like to do body and legs the brownish ones and the rest Arma

At this point Yagex might as well make pets for them

With ultra compost and the revive spell things very rarely die so just plant them asap.
---
73 favorites nice
---
It‚Äôs not much can‚Äôt remember exactly but max you can get assigned is 36 which is only like 6 runs for the task
---
Hahahahaha love it
---
Activity bar would be great.
---
is it that much different?
---
i came back from playing in '05-'10. i left after dungeoneering was added and EOC was on the horizon. i didnt want a minigame skill and did not want a wow rip off combat system (its the main reason i aint playing wow). the game fundamentally feels the same to me as before summoning arrived regardless of it not being a frozen-in-time private server.
---
Yup, this makes too much sense. Time to panic buy rock-shell armour.
---
It is useful because it provides the Ava's Effects with higher Defence and Prayer, which can be more worthwhile than the Attack Bonus in some situations. For example, I believe it was popular at Zilyana because you range it and prayer is very important there (unless you flick everything; then you can go with Avas).
---
one rune drag alt is pretty standard fare you can maintain that with like zero effort
---
two or more is for frontpagers and sweatlords
---
I think it‚Äôs implied that they already have one. If it‚Äôs your first one, yeah it‚Äôs one of the best drops. But it‚Äôs super common
---
I don‚Äôt know why I made all the boots purple. The more I look at it, the worse it gets. Saradomin is definitely best looking so far. I don‚Äôt feel confident enough to rock full ancients haha
---
its what runecrafting shouldve had included in it
---
[Not even 24 hours since previously posted on the same subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cglgow/sarachnis_web_skipping_guide_shrink_me_potion/)
---
Warding is way more developed and feels like a way more fitting skill than artisan and sailing, which failed at 58% and 68%. I think if warding fails it will be very very close to 75%. Id say there's a more than 50% chance it will pass.
---
Ash confirms Warding is passing by a landslide
---
Creepy and macabre, I like it
---
Thank's for the non-meme answer in these trying times. Even though I disagree with you, I appreciate the realness
---
oh god my eyes
---
but there's the alternative way to train it like runecrafting Kappa
---
npc reponse to show others they are the npc. top mind here
---
It needs 75% to pass. It doesn't have it, it's just a matter of figuring out if Jagex will try to rebuild it again (as inbuing or something like that) if they'll just scrap it entirely.
---
We really dont tho. Our life saving stays in either lms or nmz.
---
the drop has to be in your name to fill the log
---
Already have quest cape lol
---
Fossil Island is a good suggestion
---
Inferno is Def a goal I just don't think I have the tenacity or the defence level atm lol
---
I'm not maxed and don't oppose a new skill, I just don't think this looks very good...
---
Honestly at this point I feel it's jagex making these accounts and posting stuff like this LOL how did everything go from one sided negatives to all of sudden we're accepting warding? Maybe it's because we all know jagex is going to rig this anyways.
---
Hoping it will pass.
---
I imagine you speak with the voice of Bob Ross
---
That was Mod Ash basically saying "get ready mate"
---
I guess the problem is how do you get "significantly more challenging boss" than Zuk in OSRS
---
I think there‚Äôs a difference in what you are thinking and what he actually has done. Clearly only does it to be a dick
---
Have you been boosting from 82? 
---
Side note: the fishing spots move too often
---
Vote yes to warding
---
Dunno why you are posting disinformation? Runelite+ won‚Äôt get you hacked or banned stop chatting shit
---
Vote yes to warding btw
---
I see what you mean. I meant it as "creatures that originate from Waterbirth" rather than just creatures on Waterbirth. Perhaps the examine could say "effective on dagannoth, wallaski, and rock crabs" or such to help explain it? Though an examine would only make sense if it scaled per piece and I feel like it would go over better if it was a set effect only.
---
I'd definitely say there is something there tough if you can communicate it properly. It really would be nice to see an equipment stat screen update to show weapon speed for one but also to add an "Additional Bonuses" area to list hidden effects like set effects and such. like if you had full Void, under "Additional Bonuses" it could say "Set Effect- Void Ranged" and perhaps mouse over with what it does. But that probably isn't likely to happen soon.
---
Yup, this sounds very sensible. Time to panic buy rock-shell armour.
---
Now wear that untrimmed cape proudly with your full dragon and show off at the g.e, never take it off!  
---
Really tho gz was my first 99 on original rs
---
Yeah. Runescape is a game of inventory management and planning as well as actual execution. The inferno is a good challenge both for inventory optimisation and actual gameplay.
---
They target people who have previously bought/sold gp. That's probably why you get messages more often from them.
---
I totally agree. But I'm not gonna lie, that ad is much more convincing than the "2x XP" ads. 10 seconds of research however would've proved this wrong, so I'm not gonna defend OP.
---
assuming you used chins you could go 90-99 range in one day and then 9.5k vorkath kills would be like 20% less time due to hire range bonus so you'd probably be around 12k kc. i don't care what you do just fun facting lol
---
As if there aren't no voters doing the exact same thing.
---
Petition to change % to a reasonable 65% pass, we don‚Äôt get anything done at 75%
---
More like your $10.02 on where you stand on warding!

I said the chances would be astronomical. Ive paid well over 500 people to vote no and made way over 50 accounts with bonds. Its free real estate

Thanks I hate it

---
Tbh I got very lucky. I suck bit time

Yup
---
I mean, I don't disagree with you! I have considered botting on a normal account (and in my opinion, with people using unapproved plugins and that sort of crap, there are people who think they are legitimate players doing shit that is way worse than auto fishing or alching).   
---
But you're still on an iron man! I'm sorry my first post was so biting, but for real! Other people are working fucking HARD to achieve that shit! Personally, even if had utter contempt for fairness in general, Jagex, whatever (which you don't seem to), I'd still feel bad for the neckbeard ironmen playing the game fair. People are throwing away their lives lmao.
---
I wonder how many sets op has banked

Hey, if I had like 40m to blow on chins at the time I would‚Äôve considered it but what‚Äôs done is done
---

---
So don't pk there :) ezclap
---
So, summoning and invention from RS3
---
Did i say that? I said argument that we need more content isnt an argument to add a new skill
---
Well thought out and put together! Sounds like an awesome addition which helps expand OSRS, and integrates existing equipment, also acts as a gold sink, make the dropped items alch for 0 gp when attached to gear, or alone.  Love the idea for seercull rework...
---
Sarachnis is a new boss in the Forthos Dungeon that fits your combat level. She's weak to crush, so use a leaf bladed battle axe if you can wield that. If you have the money, you can buy Sarachnis' Cudgel, which is a drop from the boss that's supposed to be BiS for lower levels on her. You will also need a slash weapon to get to her because there are webs in the way.
---
Beyond that, Barrows is still really good becasue the gear you get will help you do God Wars bosses when your stats are higher
---
People are downvoting you, but it's literally right. A lot of people probably wouldn't want their boss walking up behind them and have the N word big on screen lol. Then again if your boss sees you on reddit you might be screwed anyway, so who knows.
---
He looks like worse Thanos.

seeds already are over flooding the market thanks to farming contracts despite us nerfing birdhouses to deal with that sort of... as well as the master farmer bots hence the extremely low price of most potions and herbs atm....

---
His second idea is invention from rs3 as well
---
Ranarr is expensive but when successfully grown the costs are recouped with added profit not to mention the seed reward pack. I would argue players rotate their farming guild patches more so around profiting than experience. I thought the community might be more in favor of a small balance so that increasingly expensive trees wouldn't occur as an option from rerolling easier contracts obligating players to commit to the easy tier in an effort to avoid spending the cost of trees which offer no recoup value in themselves.

Of it passing? Hard to say. It would seem like the Nos are 28K easily, but it could just be a vocal minority and a lot more talk than votes. But with 111K Votes and still rising, that is far more than most of the communities discussing on socials and it is hard to say where those players stand on the issue.
---
In a previous Q&amp;A, it was mentioned that the Enhanced Crystal Chest will give better rewards compared to the Taverly chest, but the drop table wasn't finalized yet. Can you give us any ideas on what to expect from this new chest now that development has completed?

I use sanguinesti staff, its doesn't drop one of those...
---
What will happen to the warding content/equipment if warding doesn't pass. I feel like most of the people who are voting no still want to see a lot of the content in the game, they just don't want it as a skill.

I have all those items for my mage XD so i guess im good to go

Not if you're fighting undead. Salve (ei) doesn't stack with slayer helm, so void is better in that case
---
artisan was slayer but for non combat skills.
---
It's true. It got terrible rating and reviews when it came out and got cancelled after the 3rd season. People hated it.
---
It's more or less the same so far.
---
Just spitballing...maybe have more darts/scales next time? (I'm an ASSHOLE)

And pointless to begin with
---
Hey, on spotify there are some old school runescape music, but not all. Would it be possible to add more from the osrs soundtrack including the ones made after the remake.
---
Happened to me too . F
---
Yes that's possible though I would consider that to be "breaking the rendering" since the scene would no longer be actually correct. Maybe we could re-model them ourselves or something not sure.
---
You could do KBD. Although if you literally have no quests done you can't. You'd need dragon slayer. But he'd be perfect for mobile and for a player who's relatively inexperienced at bossing
---
Rapier is 7 str and like 12 attack bonus over a regular whip. Can‚Äôt really count tent vs whip imo since tent degrades rapier doesn‚Äôt. So yeah it is a significant upgrade for let‚Äôs say slayer.

Your opinion is that you think ur amazing and like warding

My opinion is that ur booty and i do not like warding, its an opinion champ.

The straw man fallacy is when you make it seem like you're taking on your opponent's logic by attacking their argument but in reality its an argument they've never made. I.E. you're attacking a straw man disguised as your opponent, though not actually them.
---
I‚Äôm all for Re-vamping DKs or even the new Dagganoth Queen (which sounds fun.) I just have a question about would there be any other incentives as far as drops from the Queen? I get the armor add ons, but it being only useful at one area, would she be able to drop anything else? Love the idea though, DKs are my favorite OSRS bosses of all time, thank you for the hard work you put into this!

If a dice bot has 50m on the account and gets banned that's 50m gone from the game. Anytime a bot gets banned all of the shit that bot had is no longer in the game.

Congrats!
---
I don't really have a leg in this fight, but if something is being leveled by ToG it usually mean that you aren't that interested in it right? Otherwise it would already be leveled I think.
---
So if ToG is split between 2 skills that someone doesn't want to level it shouldn't truly matter right?
---
Oh my gee. My world has been shattered

You said ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need more content,‚Äù I dono buddy sounds like you‚Äôre saying we should have a limit of content in the game to me.

Daily pest control on lunch break.  Might do some mage arena graveyard when I get home, or get my last runecraft level for hard diary.
---
Well if you use the 1 invent + suicide method then you could die on like 4/10 trips and still get more xp than at a gilded altar so defo worth it! It‚Äôs a bit of a dead pking spot as well
---
Well, that is not what the title says. It just claims that yes voters think there isn't enough content while ignoring that Warding is not the same type of updates as the ones shown. And I would say that a new skill filling a type of content than other updates haven't is a valid argument, even if not the strongest; at least it is a lot more sound than trying to refute it by pointing to completly different styles of updates. A better counter-argument would have been showing recent content that is more comparable to what Warding would offer, like more of Kebos, Beginner Clues, and so on, instead of focusing as much on Endgame PvM.
---
warding failing yes.
---
I was drunk one night and when I logged on the next day I noticed it following me. Never even noticed when I got it.
---
I‚Äôm not telling anyone how to vote. But the ‚Äòopinion‚Äô that the game shouldn‚Äôt grow *is* toxic. Have an opinion based on the content being voted on, not just based on voting down (or up for that matter) any new content.
---
didn't realise wt was in a bank, nor were there any burst spots there.
---
Its hard for me to tell on mobile but do you have auto retaliate on? It looks like you do on some of the minions, it should be off. Part of your problem is you aren't dealing enough damage, try to speed up your switches and dont forget that you can attack while running. A major example of this is when she changes from the second green phase to the red phase and you needed to run the whole island. Attack red zulrah as soon as shes up, continue running, attack 4 ticks later, etc. Doing this will get you extra dps. Eat up more before the jad phase, the reason you died is because you changed prayers a tick late. As soon as zulrahs attack is visible, you can change prayers. So pray mage, as soon as you see a fireball pray range, as soon as you see a snot ball pray mage, etc. You want your hp to be high enough to not worry about the minions, and tank a missed prayer. Keep trying, it gets a lot easier
---
thats what I did, every no vote makes me whant to vote yes again lmao
---
Jagex should rule against buffing suggestions of un-used items.
---
This is a fucking perverse trend, you have no shame with your merches.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it is wrong. But it is toxic to the game. People who are against new content on principle alone, and not based on what the new content is, is toxic to the game. That is *my* opinion.
---
lmfao ppl really have nothing better to spend their money on
---
I would guess it would go down, as warding would be adding more options for mage armor. More supply, less demand, price goes down. That‚Äôs assuming that skeletal won‚Äôt be worth more due to something like disassembling for materials useful in warding.
---
Nightmare fuel
---
this is the first step towards EOCüò§
---
They could very easily work with a few approved clients and ban the rest. Once runelite and osb have some cryptographically secure authentication in them it would be trivial to detect and ban people using cheat clients.
---
God i want to F U C K Zanik
---
I think the best option at this point is for JaGex to hire the main RuneLite dev and take over the RuneLite project themselves (might not need to buy since it is open source). Like I could see them still allowing limited open source contribution where they, or we - via polls, decide what can be added to the client. Then they could just restrict the use of third party clients without upsetting the majority of players
---
I hope it passes, but idk if it will or not. Based on what Reddit and the more serious players say... I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll pass. It depends on the random casuals in game to vote for it to pass I think
---
No.
---
I don‚Äôt see a difference. Why oppose a new skill on principle if you don‚Äôt have anything against new content in general?
---
Are you telling me that the memes are true and that there are just a bunch of maxed players who don‚Äôt want to grind a new skill?
---
It just seems silly that a lot of the rewards that could be good additions to the skill could fail the poll because of this, and we will never see the suggestion again because it failed a poll.
---
Like you pointed out though, it does make it difficult because people could vote no to Warding because they dislike a future poll coming out for it. The question then becomes does that outweigh the amount of people voting no down the ballet? I personally do not think so. There has to be something done. They could even have the future polls grayed out in the poll booth so that they can read future questions, while not being able to vote on them quite yet. This would at least let them see in the moment of voting that voting yes to Warding (in this case) will mean the question they do not care for will pass.
---
**Can something be actually done with Thammaron's sceptre already?**
---
Thammaron's sceptre is currently useless and in need of a buff in comparison to the other wilderness weapons. The **core problem** remains the same though, which is that there's very **few monsters in the wilderness you can actually use magic against.** This can be addressed by fixing the many safe spots by either putting the bosses into caves or enclosed areas and making magic actually a possibility instead of being entirely disallowed by the ridiculous +500 magic defense bonus that Callisto has. Originally it was possible to use magic against Callisto but they decided on a lazy fix (now gone jmod) to just fix safe spotting at the time by making it impossible to use magic.
---
So to sum it up:
---
1) Fix wilderness safe spots (callisto, venanatis, vet'tion, etc)
---
2) Make magic great again by allowing us to use it (**greater pool of npcs not immune to magic preferably**)
---
3) Make more npcs weak to magic and perhaps resistant to other styles within the wilderness (**At the very least allow all 3 styles to be equally used instead of limiting others**)
---
4) Fix Thammaron's sceptre so it's actually on par with craw's bow and vigorra's chainmace in terms of **DPS and similar cost** to use per hour.
---
5) Another possibility is to allow the sceptre to ignore all magic defense of npcs in the wilderness. This allows a competitive edge against all other magic weapons in the wilderness and gives way to being able to use magic against Callisto once again without being able to safespot abuse with ice barrage's freezing. **Callisto can remain immune to all binding and freezes.**
---
Can I ask why? I generally favour better icons/silhouette over colours to allow an equal playing field for those with colour blindness.
---

---
Anti anti scam
---
Wow, hilarious joke.
---
1. Great observation. I was interesting in making a boss that wasn't easy, and that may require some manual switches and casting in order to "keep up" with the fight. Combination Runes, Elemental Staves, Tome of Fire, and the Rune Pouch make Rune commitment fairly minimal. I like this feedback and I'll take it into consideration on the second round of design for version two.
---
2. Presumably, yes. I also had the thought of adding superior Waterbirth creatures in a new dungeon. Think Monster Rock Crabs, Gigadagannoth, and Skeletal Wallasalkis.
---
3. The reason why it is +75 is because of Attack Speed and the increased potential for greater strength. Ranged Armor offers very significant Ranged Attack Bonuses, so that even with a weak weapon Ranged is highly accurate. It is also the only bow with Shortbow speed, besides the 3rd Age Bow, which can fire Dragon Arrows. The 3rd Age Bow only grants +80 Ranged Attack, and yet is sometimes devaststing when used with Ranged gear and Dragon Arrows because of its fast speed. See videos online if you're curious; I can't say for myself because I've never used a 3rd Age Bow. Using the 3rd Age Bow as a reference, I scaled back the bonuses to account for the Waterbirth creature attack bonus and the Special Attack.
---
4. I like that idea, of the Royal Pieces degrading or consuming the armor. I'll consider both of those for the second version. Excellent, excellent idea.
---
5. The Dagannoth Spawn already exist in game, and you can find them on the wiki. Or go to Waterbirth yourself and walk by the eggs, and they will attack you. I intended that they would be stronger than normal spawn, but I can clarify that.
---
6. I considered weighing the set effect more heavily, but my hangups involved using the sets with other things that might be better. For example, Slayer Helm will still surpass and of the Helmets while on task. Therefore, it wouldn't usurp Slayer Helm of its intended purpose. Also, the Gloves and Boots of the lower levels become more useful even though they lack significant bonuses. I will consider rebalancing it for the future; thanks for that thought.
---
7. I liked the idea of being able to mix and match armors against Waterbirth enemies or the Dagannoth Kings. This way, players don't have to take 3 entire sets to receive the max benefits. I can balance out my Magic Defences by throwing in a piece or two of Spinewielder or Skullbearer. It could help players optimize their setup a little bit more.
---
Thanks a lot for your feedback! Honestly, this is exzctly what I asked for and you were very thorough! Props to you for the in-depth analysis! I think I have a lot of changes incoming, now.
---
How do we kill, that which has no life? You're the real life Cartman. Bravo.

I watched like 10 people trade someone doing this and then thank them. O_o only 1 was like "waaait a minute"
---
Sara top arma bottom is the only option
---
WHAT‚ÄôS THE PURPOSE OF IT ALL?
---
Considering it's calculations based on the actual numbers for everything, pretty much.
---
just looking over it real quick. 
---
your tile marker is wrong on the bottom right, the farthest right one, should be one tile higher.
---
youre losing alot of dps not attacking while moving to your next spot, ie attack, move, attack, move.
---
for the jad phase, the easiest way im gonna explain this is that you switch prayers when her head drops to attack so visually it ends up looking like you have the opposite prayer up.
---
bring more switches if you can, youre hitting like a wet noodle. 
---
you just kinda have to throw your face at it until you get it, then it just becomes sorta muscle memory
---
I think this is a really great idea, however with the flood of t70s right now. I think it would be a lot more efficient being t45 upgraded armour, something to couple the frem helms
---
If you aren't used to the alphabet and are say Chinese, Korean or Japanese you could have trouble with it, no?
---
You‚Äôre right that if you‚Äôre going for Slayer on your main you might as well just be patient and save 99 ranged for last as you‚Äôll collect so much xp from cannon tasks.
---
But for pures and tanks that go for 99 ranged early on then chinning will be the fastest method regardless of wealth. You‚Äôll reach 99 faster by making money on the side to afford chins than using any old method you might remember pures and range tanks used to do back in the day.
---
I wasnt joking, ur shit @ game
---
Thats not a thing at all lmao.
---
Dude stop being racist
---
Looks good to me. Ignore all the upset children that can't accept that change is necessary. Ask them if they wanted ge to be added back in the day and whether or not they use it.
---
Sure, but it sets the precedent. Basically, all the rich maxed mains are controlling the fate of the game by bonding up tons of accounts and literally paying for ad space to keep content out of a game that "devalues" their progress. That's likely why early or mid level content has a hard time passing as well. 
---
It's not game life or death in itself, but if we are never able to pass a skill and hours upon hours of dev time is always wasted on it, they'll eventually just give up. No point trying to make content that can never pass. So it will definitely stagnate.

theres 10 difficulities for each "punishment" its set to 10 atm :)
---
This post was a real boomer joke.
---
Well I assume no one wants to be hit by the wrong Jad attack, get hit by Zuk's fireball, and that no one wants Zulrah to throw Mage during Ranged phase. The fact is, the boss isn't meant to be easy. It has its weaknesses that must be exploited.
---
I agree with you on Rockcrusher. A few others have expressed this, and I'll weaken it a little bit in the next version.
---
I will think of a way to make the Royal Pieces either degradable, or make them consume the armors.
---
Thanks for the feedback! Stay tuned for the next version.
---
I can see colour blindness being an issue.  Mainly however I feel like this is a more easily perceived change rather than just a symbol when prayer switching. 
---
This stemmed from doing demonic gorillas for a good while and I felt like I was straining my eyes between inventory management and prayer switches, but I imagine this applies to pvp as well. 
---
New icons/shilouette would work too, but that may seem like a big change to some.
---
Noice
---
No you're not. I said Jagex' previous fuckup won't keep me from voting yes to content I want in the game because I trust they won't fuck up again. You say because I trust Jagex won't fuck up again I should vote yes to anything they propose. Please, try to focus. Read our little debate again SLOWLY and try to understand every sentence before you respond again, because you really don't seem to be capable to read/understand what I'm writing lol

Finishing grinding out the Song of the Elves requirements. I wasn't remotely near the requirements a month ago, but now I just need to get from 55 to 70 herblore and I think I have enough cash. Got the skill requirements for Mourning's end part 1 yesterday. Will be grinding herblore at work and on public transit to get home then questing tonight and tomorrow night.
---
I've never been able to do a quest at launch before and want to give this a go
---
Someone already made this comment and the answer is about 10k of each set lol just a coincidence though hahaha xD
---
Divine would have been in the game.
---
If your original alphabet doesn't stem from the Latin alphabet you could have a hard time writing the letters out.  You could have trouble doing a version of this in Chinese, for example.
---
Thanks! I'll try and improve the idea for a second version. Stay tuned for that.
---
Pp hard?
---
Same for sure
---
Well here I sort of agree with you, but in a different way. I've been saying for years that they should just make one or two worlds that don't receive updates for us players who don't want them, like myself and Autumn Elegy before he quit. They would require little attention, and they would keep both sides happy. Those who vote no because they're here for OSRS and not pre-eoc would have genuine **old**school RuneScape, while those who vote yes would have RS3 without the EOC and as many constant updates as they like.
---
And no, "just not using it" doesn't work. It becomes a requirement for clues, quests, max cape, quest cape, general achievement/account progress, etc. Also not having an OP item in the game is not the same as being the only one who doesn't use it, it is an online game after all. People who had unofficial irons, for the most part, made real ones when it came out. Same principle applies here. It's just not the same.
---
Stay with the archer ring, take 3 range pots 2antidotes and full bag of ppots or restore alch runes and you can easy 30 50 kills per trip depends on drops
---
Harder, but definitely possible
---
its not bannable with the default plugins it ships with. nice try tho
---
I think it‚Äôll pass and I voted no. 
---
There‚Äôs sooooooo many votes this poll it makes me think people are excited for a new skill
---
No thanks. Lumbridge is fine as it is.

that doesnt equal your account getting banned tho, nice bait

Maybe his daddy works at Jagex
---
I don't get why they decided to implement it like that... it's stupid af. Just make it an expensive attachment you can't take off, and have it drop the whole thing if you're risking it. It will replace whatever +1 pures use now and add a whole lot of risk without forcing them to spend fuckin 4m every time they wanna pk lmao
---
They really need a poll of "Would you like a new skill in OSRS" poll question because I don't know if the argument is over the implementation or whether people even want to see a new skill.
---
I'm starting to get to the point where I'm becoming not much of a fan of the minority rule.
---
2/3rds Supermajority (67%) would have made more sense.
---
Pregunta estupida
---
  
---
See how you had to say "in spanish" to make it clear what you meant?
---
1,000,000,000,000% agree. The entire mini game is completely dominated by Ancients. Games are often 0-0 draws or complete blow-outs if one team has a shortage of ancients magic. I know it may sound extreme but I think they should just restrict everyone to the standard spell book. I think game would be much more balanced and fun that way. Can‚Äôt even make it across the map without getting frozen in place 69 times.
---
Edit: maybe they could add some untradable reward like a Ring of Eternal Dueling?
---
Sailing almost passed and it looked like a copypaste from the garbage section of the forums in 2005
---
How much harder is vork post quest? Thinking about getting an assembler.
---
Shitty test, but as a learning tool it's fine. 
---
How did you learn to spell as a kid? You got your list of words, copied then down, and after enough repetition you could do it from memory
---
While we are it why not add every teleport in game to your poh? /s
---
I don't propose adding buildings or changing its layout.
---
As an ironman these people are the reason I can't enjoy this game mode. People are so toxic, I try to have a normal conversation with them (I only mention I'm an ironman like twice usually) and then they just crash me and don't understand why I'm offended. It's become a serious problem, like ironmen are people too, just retarded.
---
Yea
---
You could add the robemaking content into the game with as few as 10 craftable items if you sunk more steps/processing into runecrafting.
---
Craft an inert robe/bark armor, then process it through runecrafting. The same inert armor could be processed in different manners requiring different mechanics and runecrafting levels to avoid "over bloating" crafting.
---
It makes sense thematically to have runecrafting as the magic support skill. If a new player wanted to train magic on their own, you could tell them to make their own runes, and once they've made enough, they could make their own robes too.
---
Creating an item sink is important for the longevity for the game, but it doesn't belong to a skill that's been reduced/strictly limted to creating mid-tier items. It'd be akin to attaching a dissolving mechanic to train smithing, with the incentive to eventually create... a rune platebody.
---
Yeah, it's not like there's an actual fun game behind all the memes. We gotta have fun here somehow.
---
There is literally a promoted post telling me to vote no...

Stolen meme from the guy working on the car js

mama mia that's one spicy smackdown

Personally, agility. Not a fan of rooftops and wish they expanded on brimhaven a little more
---
As long as it isn't raids or gwd tier gear it's fine.
---
level what, your woodcutting?
---
They sort of have with priority polls, but I agree it would be nice to have an explicit yes/no to the topic. Especially considering how long  they may go before pitching another skill if this fails.
---
50% margin sounds great until you realise you're making a maximum of 13000gp every 4 hours thanks to the buy limit
---
Is it harder because it's less dps or because it's not as much range
---
Just keep doing slayer, it‚Äôs good for money making at high levels depending on what monsters are assigned to you
---
anyone know how much it is to advertise something on reddit? i wanna know how much money these people wasted for maybe a few votes.
---
construction lvl 69 nice
---
What about warding would make you stop enjoying the game? This is a genuine question that I haven't heard an answer to. A lot of what I hear is something along the lines of, "warding is bad, because I don't like change." 
---
Ive been playing for a long time, and I think it's about time a new skill was implemented. They even listened to the community initially and rethought how to introduce it to the game, so it's not like they didn't spend time thinking about it.
---
How many times is this gonna get reposted? I say about 23 more
---
Check out theOSlounge
---
I got 99 mining from mlm and I dont even know. I'm assuming yes, once you pass 85 and move to 90, 95. It should be giving you more runite ore but im not 100%.  A way to ensure getting higher level ores is by completing the Falador Elite Diaries since the reward lets you yield higher tier ores more frequently
---
Don‚Äôt rationalize it like that. There‚Äôs toxic people on both sides. Don‚Äôt just think it‚Äôs ok just because your side did it.
---
OK, I don‚Äôt know what a shark card is but I know that a bond costs 4m and give you membership and a shark card doesn‚Äôt so you‚Äôre wrong.
---
yea because telling someone to vote no to warding and not providing any genuine reasons to do so is totally gonna get someone to vote no.
---
normally about $2500
---
Repost. They have already talked about this.

Prediction: 70/26/4

Expectation: 76/22/2
---
If it passes, it will indeed have a player based testing phase as mentioned by I believe mod ash recently. If it fails, I think Mod West said he was willing to take another look at sailing.
---
Might be able to grind a few vork kills if I can make time to play today.
---
Go see a psychiatrist

You will always get a full set before duplicates.  The one exception is with large fossils that can become either animal or plant fossils, but each set will still complete before duplicates.
---
Do you have a solution to scrub the entire internet of clue puzzle solvers, coordinate lists, NPC answers etc.? If not it seems rather pointless imo.
---
yea but 1m at master farmers is only doable if you have 94+ thieving, gp rates at lower levels are much less.
---
Player Owned House.
---
If it fails I hope they re-try sailing and just add the warding stuff to Runecrafting so we can get real training options

I agree with you. New content doesn't make the rest of the game unplayable. I just don't think a lot of players cope with change well, so they make a mountain out of a molehill. If warding is really expensive, hopefully it'll be a good money sink and help the ig economy, so I hope it passes.
---
Yes but how about only to Lynx Titan
---
and if the mods had any control over whether that is visible or not they would've hidden it.
---
Surely thats not true
---
Hold on, let me create a gofundme
---
Yeah I feel like the 2019 playerbase will have a much higher chance to vote in sailing compared to when it was originally polled, by a long shot.
---
Oh ok
---
"protect"? from what? new content? lmfao
---
sailing poll got 68% so idk why hes saying 58 to 42
---
No. But there is a solution for other cheat plugins.
---
I like to use the crystal halberd if you have access to that it absolutely rips through supreme
---
You're meant to cover up the left side, from what I remember from primary school.
---
30/40/30
---
I find it easier to pre-plant maples/celestial/redwood/palm and reroll all other trees as I can do many more contracts in the time it takes to grow a magic tree at a net loss. Seems like the majority agrees changing the contracts would be an easy scape move though.
---
Man, I never realized how much xp that is. I've only been doing herb runs for money but torstols are really nice
---
It has been like that for the past 15 years or so.
---
so whats exactly wrong with my name?
---
central banks do legal counterfeiting, they literally lend money they don't have in arbitrary amounts at arbitrary prices (interest rates) to govern finances, if you did the same, you would be in prision
---
heck, they even lend at 0% to some or buy up stocks with that created money, its called Quantative Easing
---
jagex economy fuck ups are shadowed by irl central banks in comparision, those are absolute leeches
---
There have been plenty of no posts with people giving full explanation of why they voted no.
---
It's often more efficient to get some account upgrades prior to going directly for gold.
---
If you're interested in some long-term upgrades and have *a significant amount* of time to play and time prior to needing to buy another bond, you could try grinding agility to full graceful (40-59 or so), mining to a coal bag (67-68?), obtaining ice gloves (50 mining is covered by previous req, possibly 43 prayer and mid-combat) and then unlocking access to the blast furnace for roughly 400-450k/hr. This would probably take 15-20 hours for graceful, 20 hours for mining, negligible time for prayer, and then begin profiting (ores may cover initial gold costs) at the blast furnace and set you up with some useful benchmarks, but unless you play more than 20 hours a week, then this would literally be all you'd expect to do with this first bond (which is probably very not fun), but you'd have a reliable moneymaker.
---
If you want short-term gold, then you could try making unfinished potions. This would require completing druidic ritual and investing some money to get roughly 30-40 initial levels, as well as more initial money to buy ingredients in bulk, but you could probably get 300-450k/hr. The major downside to this method is that it yields absolutely no experience and it's repetitive as hell.
---
If you're decent with the grand exchange, you could flip items. There's millions of flipping videos out there, but there's no telling how good you will actually perform until you actually try it yourself. You could make millions, or you could lose millions too.
---
Lastly, if you're decent at finding player run activities, you could be an essence runner. Players with tons of money will hire other players to travel between a bank and a runecrafting altar, delivering supplies for them to level their skills insanely fast compared to traditional methods. I heard it was around 8m/hr, but I don't actually know the requirements nor where you would need to look to find such a business.
---
In any case, if you want to actually enjoy the game instead of constantly playing it to maintain it like paying your mortgage, you'd need to make some significant account upgrades before you can always make enough money to only buy bonds.
---
This is being worked on, it was to do with phones have the front camera integrated into the screen I'm amazed you can register clicks between the edge and the menu icons I cant on mine :(
---
Of course I'm referring to the "alts you supposedly made".  Just fuck off dude. You're not worth talking to. 
---
I reported your account multiple times, and I pray jagex looks into your account and perm bans you for trying to rig the polls.
---
One of the main appeals to Runescape is that the quests and lore don't involve insane amounts of grinding within them. Many other top down mmorpgs are go here, kill this many, you've saved my city so here's your reward. I don't get how people sell Runescape on that and then say "slayer is so much fun". Maybe because they know what they're getting in to, I just never understood the appeal
---
It looks like someone took a hit of that serum that turned him into a titan.
---
Listen here dick in the booty ass nigga.. I dont know who shit in your coffee this morning.. But dont take it out on me ok?? Thx have a great day captain neckbeardüòò
---
Warding is shit ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
It upsets me because there will be atleast 1 person that thinks this way..
---
Definitely by release
---
what lol
---
Personally I feel staves should be added to warding but yes gathering skills tend to be different from the production skills, just as there are going to be many ways to gather the resources for Warding. It's the END RESULT that's important in crafting skills so while you gather some materials to Fletch bows and what not, that's to be expected, as gathering and production skills are different. The bow string isn't the end product, it's a "gathering" product that you use to finish a fletching own. We have only one group of armor that can't currently be made and I think that really hinders things. Crafting has already become a sort of "catch all" for both certain production elements as well as gathering elements and I don't think adding more to that already bloated skill will do any good.
---
J1mmy‚Äôs By Release is good if you haven‚Äôt watched it already
---
Yes of course jagex will ban a rs account because of a reddit thread. Get a grip lmfao
---
I'm interested in seeing some of this dead content become useful. 
---
Right now the role Splitbark/Skeletal "fills" is useless. It's "mage armor with very modest melee defenses", but that's not a thing players want or need. Magic only gets used when a monster is specifically weak to it, which often means +magic attack isn't actually all that important. 
---
If the enemy can deal damage back and isn't safespottable, players tend to use +prayer gear to manage the appropriate protection prayers. I, for one, have never gotten a demon task (for example) and been like "Maybe I'll use Splitbark to be able to get positive magic *but also maybe tank a little";* I just lurk in a safespot, or if that's not an option I pray melee and go ham. 
---
\---
---
Okay, rant-over about Splitbark/Skeletal. 
---
Your proposed bonuses on these pieces of equipment are *very* strong. +50% accuracy with +30% damage is going to be incredibly powerful against bosses like the DKs. That's probably a DPS upgrade greater than 50% overall when you count that hits are landing 30% harder and way fewer attacks are missing. 
---
For comparison on these sorts of 'flat' bonuses, the Salve amulet (ei) is only 20% to each combat style and is a "big" bonus, that comes at the cost of offensive bonuses from something like a Fury amulet. The Slayer helm is a lower bonus than that. Void Knight armor is only 10% to its combat style. None of the above include a flat damage reduction. That damage reduction would make this "cheap" armor (T40) perform comparably to some very high-end armor, and the upgraded versions retaining this bonus would be best-in-game with HUGE offensive bonuses. 
---
I want Splitbark/Skeletal to be useful for something but I think you've gone overboard on the bonuses.
---
If it's not yes and not no, it's not counted. It's the exact same as not voting. Not counted as a no, lmao.
---
I accidentally got construction xp last week. Was mortified. Was one lamp over üò≠
---
BeCAusE iT bAd... why... bEcAuSE iT BaD
---
I enjoy this idea, I love seeing area themed gear (cosmetically speaking) it just helps fit with the area you're in more.
---
No you can, because I promise this isn't realistic. Each client would send off it's secure key? How would that be determined if it's tied to an account? That doesn't make sense to me. Like, where/when would this be generated? After the client is downloaded once? Tied to accounts probably isn't what you meant since that would means you can only use one account per pc/client without the auth failing. 
---
I cannot see a way to generate this client sided authentication in a way that detects cheats
---
Gonna be honest i was like ‚Äúbeating scarecrow?? ‚Äú but yeah thats a pretty solid meme now that i get it
---
I'd like it, but judging by the rest of the comments it's not gonna happen. Oh well.
---
They are all RS2 servers lol.
---
RuneScape classic - RS1
---
OSRS - RS2
---
RuneScape - RS3
---
I've already accepted that it's going to fail so I won't be surprised or upset when it does. No skill will ever pass a 75% poll, IMO.
---
This is how I see it.  We all love and dedicate an insane amount of time on this game.  If a poll comes around that isn't your average update and you really don't like it and even think it might have negative effects on the game and the way you enjoy it then I can't really blame anyone for fighting against it.  This is no different from an election which will affect your life.   Some people(prob more than I'd care to admit) literally play this game 12 hours a day.  They care more about this poll than the upcoming US presidential election.  People do the same thing for elections (spend time and resources to get your opinion out and hope it persuades others).  Plus someone said (credibal, I know) the cost can range from $10+ which is already cheaper than a membership *insert crab meme here*.
---
I think a better question is why tf does that box sometimes leave the passage against the wall? You literally can't escape and are forced to take the dmg.
---
A lot of people recommend barb fishing as a way to help gain agility xp. I personally think go for grace, then do some other stuff and grind out a level or two when you feel it up to it all the way to 70 agility. When you feel up for just chilling and doing laps, do a couple hours and stop. 
---
Agility is one of those things that it's a pain when focusing on the grind, but gearing up takes no time so its easy to do whenever you feel it. That said, do it whenever you need magic levels and you'll be set.
---
What I've been doing is logging off in the evenings at seers village so I can hop on and grind out a few laps during break time at work. Helps cut the laps down and for some reason feels less monotonous.
---
If those are checkmarks the size of the first tick is literally too small to be captured in that camera.
---
Unfortunately the community has changed. While I'm a big advocate of a full server wipe, take everything back to how it was in 2007, remove the wilderness ditch and all the hand holding. The majority of newer players are more interested in the consistent money making, whether it be via pvm or skilling. 
---
The older ones among us are making ironmen, and playing the game from a 'different' angle. The ones who know what they are doing are simply not involved in the PvP community any more, even b0aty has only just really returned to what made him popular in the first place. 
---
RuneScape thrived on PvP, it always did. PvPers are the only reason osrs exists at all, they took the incentive and gained the traction and following we needed. 
---
I still believe the issue with PvP being mostly dead is that of the overall competence of the player base. There's no point in spending hundreds of hours building a PvP account any more, we no longer know with 100% certainty that we will find some idiot doing a clue scroll in 3m worth of gear or someone skulled at green dragons with a whip and dragon skirt. The new players will no longer accidentally wander aimlessly into the wilderness with their entire banks, so there's nobody to pick them off as we used to. 
---
Another issue I've found is that PvP practice starts in f2p mostly, which is a great way to learn timings, eating and how your character reacts to different clicks and situations. However the f2p PvP community mostly consists of black market accounts with perfectly rounded stats (incorrectly rounded at that), many of them 1 iteming and flaming people actually pking in lumbridge because they haven't got a fucking clue what they are doing. The rest of them seem to be so misguided and pompous that nobody wants anything to do with them. 
---
Tldr: 
---
The community is too clever now, and new people aren't often stupid enough to go into the wilderness by mistake. Meaning nobody bothers to look for them. 
---
Decent PvPers are migrating to ironmen and pvm.
---
F2p PvP has become a cess pool of retarded 12 year olds.
---
its referring to the stupid 69 joke. If not then i dont even get this post
---
Fair enough. Would still be amazing.
---
You sure? I heard 4:30 BST which is 11:30 EST.
---
Says the guy who maxed in osrs, doing the same repetitive actions in a video game for literally thousands of hours.
---
Woox videos usually get me in the zone for some serious clicking.
---
expecting a funny meme when a wall of text hit me, damn
---
There used to be and you got a korasi a super OP spec weapon, The quest line was fun would be happy to see it.
---
You just stand in the open space at the wall. Only time you have to click that specific tile.
---
My original point is that the people with no reasons that they would not enjoy it are the same as people who use the reason they will probably enjoy it are equally as empty and valid. I‚Äôve seen plenty of players in game say they will vote for any new skill proposed simply because they want a new skill. I‚Äôm not saying I voted yes or no.
---
Personally I believe the only controversial idea in this entire scenario is the addition of a skill. If they took every content suggestion such as dissolving items, crafting magic robes, shifting imbued rings to other content, and removed them from the idea of adding an entire skill almost every suggestion would pass, people who don‚Äôt want a skill will be happy, people who want the beneficial game content would be happy, the only disappointed group would be the people claiming they want any new skill in any form. That‚Äôs just my take on the entire situation.
---
Damn is 75% kind of ridiculous or is it just me? It would just be a shame if 73% or so makes it not pass, at that point I feel like you‚Äôre splitting hairs, alts could make up for a percent or 2. Like that‚Äôs saying that 3/10 players can overshadow what the other 7 want, I‚Äôd prefer a 65ish maybe?
---
Then again I guess you have to stick the threshold somewhere, and 51% isn‚Äôt a good idea.
---
GRATZ
---
Ty, I'm fully ready, if it's anything like my fire cape experience itll be at least a day for me lol
---
&gt;Has never done the content
---
"i need to protect game from shit content i know nothing about, me and my 17 alts i bonded to vote no"
---
It's kinda counter intuitive given that both wyverns and dragons drop visafe
---
Legendary name
---
Was just going off what the other guy said with 11 GMT. Which is also 7 est so I‚Äôm double stupid
---
Plus the initial levels power past. It gets grindy 85+ and you meet more pkers interrupting your runs.
---
For people that legit alch, they could hang out at barrows in the DH crypt and sometimes a person would get smacked and you could make good money.
---
Could we get a Noticeboard for hosts in W330 house portals? That would cut down on the spam bots which kinda suck.
---
Any plans for a Smithing rework? the rewards for getting 99 are meager to say the least. Nothing like grinding a really click intensive skill to FINALLY make those rune platebodies!
---
Will we get new quests that reward with Warding xp if Warding passes the polls?
---
Wtf is this hahahaha
---
Wtf were you going for 99 straight from tutorial island? Why carry that many chins...
---
Probably done before gold selling sites acknowledged what was happening.
---
Couldn't really give any less of a shit what you think. Fuck off. Enjoy whatever comes to you.
---
It can be depending on how it's done. Entrapment is illegal, but for it to be entrapment the officer has to influence you into doing something you wouldn't otherwise be doing. 
---
Example: Cop leaves expensive car unlocked on street. You steal it. Not entrapment. Cop could even walk by and say "wow what a nice car, oh wow am idiot left it unlocked..." And if you steal the car it's not entrapment. 
---
If a cop, instead, came up to you and offered you 10 grand to steal that car and meet him somewhere, that's entrapment.
---
In the US, a cop can provide the opportunity for you to commit a crime, like asking to buy drugs off you or offering to sell sex, and it's not entrapment. Of they harass, threaten, go out of their way to convince you/induce you to commit a crime it's entrapment.
---
They thought they could track them down because they are such a rare item.. But people who went to bed with offers in GE for tbow were getting them now and so they would lose a bill and lose the item..   
---
I don't think they fully realize how many bows came into the game
---
Always been a fan of this skill concept and especially the revisited version. Too bad a lot of people don't see this as a 'real' skill, but a minigame instead.
---
Yo add me dawg what's your name
---
Hahahahaha ur so mad. Is it because I voted no in a point and click video game?
---
It was probably a site that was buying it.. he sells to a site then a site sells to others
---
Outside of Swampletics, I'm a big fan of Framed's "Gridlocked" series, and smallexplamp's "F2P to Main" series.
---
find some guy who pays people for their vote regarding warding
---
To be honest I don‚Äôt like the mechanic of ‚Äúhey something is low now something else should heal it.‚Äù 
---
I think the lops should inflict venom or some sort of poison that hits harder and quicker(kind of like venom, maybe just venom) and there will be places around the room to which you can cure yourself.
---
The lops should go into like a rage mode as well taking more damage but dealing more damage as well, and to do the previous action as stated earlier.
---
However they don‚Äôt go into rage mode until 20%~ making it easier either for you to focus the Queen down in a reasonable time or play it safe with the lops.
---
However the lops shouldn‚Äôt do TOO much damage to where you can only stay for a few kills, but have it in a way it will be beneficial to wear say high ranged defense gear for less often hits, and low magic defense so if you did go ancients you can simultaneously heal and kill them to prolong your trips(same concept as dks, but obviously less heal amount from them).
---
However the defense thing might not be an issue because of the damage reduction, but obviously it‚Äôs all about how much they do and the numbers of everything else involved but yea.
---
Otherwise definitely a good suggestion.
---
It's Midsummer and we're browsing Reddit, this sub is sweaty.
---
82 Runecrafting
---
80 Agility
---
It's not 3m/H   who has that xD
---
-8k gp each kill less is huge when rings add barely up to 30k/kill on average
---
would troloing daganoths be worth it? spawn times might take too long for me doing that
---
See ya, loser.
---
Didn't realize that wasn't a thing anymore!!
---
I think there's a decent chance. As we saw in the recicide poll, there's  a large amount of players that appear to just vote yes for anything and probably don't visit reddit or twitter. It's hard to know how many people are in that group, but I think it's enough to push Warding over the edge.
---
That is feasible. It would take some creative numbers-work, but I could make it happen.
---
The reason why I wanted to make it T70 was because of an undeveloped idea I had to add a new area to Warerbirth Island called the Waterbirth Trench with powerful versions of Waterbirth Creatures. I'll include a more developed idea in my second proposal, so stay tuned on that. Thanks for the feedback, as it is nice to know what others think
---
Merci beaucoup!
---
If it involves adding anything magical to it then it should be in warding. That's the key aspect is adding MAGIC to armor as you're creating it.
---
What I didn't like about recent updates was how empty they feel. Honestly, the GE was the turning point, and I was there and I remember how fake that update seemed. You guys talking about how a few guys are poping a few bonds to vote twice against warding? Streamers were bringing hundreds of RS3 players to vote for GE. The game felt like an investment of hours/coins in the endgame, that's why I made an ironman account and I'm again enjoying the game.
---
For the record, I did not vote no to all the updates, just voted no to the ones I didn't feel like voting. At this point in time I don't think there are people who just votes no to anything. That's what people don't seem to realise.
---
you have poor reading comprehension. im not spelling it out again.
---
Haha, Mod West already took a look. But, I'll be making a second, improved version later on. Stay tuned for that.
---
Yep, all of that information should be accessible on the notice board.
---
Summoning and PVP minigames were odd. But I did like dungeoneering lmao. Just fun to goof around with friends at a lower level
---
+100% damage and accuracy against Stacys
---
Yes, the interactive one is boring one, not the bankstander... üëèüëèüëè
---
As opposed to firemaking, which was (on release) exciting and fun  
---
I also don't like Sailing, at all, but that's not a good argument
---
Look at how long their name is... holy shit..
---
Revolution now ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Your friend is a bitch
---
My comprehension: I‚Äôm doing a lot of kills. No one has interrupted me. My assumption is no one is here. I refuse to check if someone is in-fact here. Someone is here. Called me names because I didn‚Äôt check. *surprised face*.
---
Keep crying bud
---
What's your point?
---
It's like what, 10M?
---
I think LMS has the potential to be the starting ground for people wanting to PK. Hell, LMS got me to pk at callisto for a bit(yea ik im a noob, but im not good enough to go to lava maze). Sure its tribrid right now but nothing is stopping jagex from doing weekly events (I.E pure week, zerk week, no ancient week, etc.)
---
What's even weirder than just this random person being spammed everywhere, but for about 2 days a week or so ago, those same bots were saying someone else's name. Something like 'muhfn' or something.
---
Chin down gamer, your neck beard is showing.
---
the magic gained by detroying metal weapons/leather armor/elegant clothing or by casting magic at runecrafting alters?
---
Loved dungeoneering, it‚Äôs basically raids but smaller, more procedurally generated dungeons, and you don‚Äôt get to take your own gear in. Best part was that you actually use all your skills in Daemonheim.
---
This is the real tragedy behind Warding failing the poll. No blue wizard skirt :(
---
I love Link and Rargh but Tanzoo and Virtoso do the same thing with much higher quality and more content.
---
The lamp is also too detailed. All of the icons are a basic shape with a noticeable outline. Colours are few, there's no shadow, and the icon with the most detailed "shape" is Slayer adding three holes for eyes, bumps for teeth, and a sword, so not exactly super in-depth. The lantern, however, has shadows detailed on the icon, has an irregular shape due to the perspective like you mentioned, the lantern itself has different coloured spots on it rather than being mono-colour like the other icons. 
---
As for the swirls, the problem that I feel is space usage. Without the sparkles, a large portion of the upper and lower parts of the icon area are empty, and it looks barren. They tried to fix this by adding the sparkles, but they seem out of place to me because they aren't really connected to the swirl, and are just floating add-ons. The only other icons to have "floating" parts that con't connect are fletching (two separate arrows) and hunter (a paw print), but they both make sense to have floating parts. These sparks don't have any reason to be floating around other than to fill up space, so it feels off.
---
Repeating it doesn't make it anymore true.

So I did a shit woad of NMZ and now I'm buwnt de heww out of dat.

It's faster to bank the ores iirc
---
Either so long as the magic is going into armor. I like to look at breaking down mundane weapons for magic as similar to making a small magical nuclear reactor. You break it down into "atomic" particles that get "infused" into other armor to make it magical.
---
Consider the fact that they would ONLY be more effective against Waterbirth Creatures.
---
Many creatures fall under the Undead category, making it reasonable to limit.
---
Slayer Helmet can be effective against any Slayer assignment.
---
Void is effective against all things, in general.
---
I also think I went overboard on the bonuses, but I wanted to see what people thought. I'm definitely scaling it back in the second version.
---
you just described like 90% of players in osrs. simple answer is, he was always a toxic waste.
---
Needs to be Cyan and Yellow-green to fill the color wheel
---
Every vote is based on personal interest/need, like it or not. Just like you voted basing on personal interest, so did he.
---
Ahh yeah it was I'll change it in the OP cheers.
---
More like KitBOGUS amirite?
---
Pls everything, but not my Log info :o
---
Doesn't trading for other gear defeat the purpose of the account? You can do barrows in barrows sooo if your only doing barrows then use barrows.
---
Lamp is most definitely the best, really fits in with the rest of the icons
---
Thanks! That was the whole purpose. Appreciate your support :)
---
Couldn't agree more! It was truly a fun experience. I always loved training mage and runecrafting for free in there üòâ
---
I got one from bandos back in 2012, to this date RS3 wiki says he doesn't drop it. I'm guessing it's just ultra rare.
---
I've been doing more merching lately and it's going fairly well. Does anyone know of clan chats, specific worlds/locations, or third party forums that are useful for flipping? Particularly bulk items. 
---
I am aware of the official RS forums but they aren't super active. And obviously W302. But I'm sure there are clan chats specifically for bulk items/bypassing GE limits, but I haven't been able to find any.
---
I am braided from the chin down. I am a collective unit.
---
Thanks; the boss fight was a rather undeveloped suggestion, but I'm 100% open to changing it in the second version. Thanks for the feedback!
---
This. So much this. They're one of the funniest osrs channels and have amazing production quality and skits.
---
eOc!!11!
---
Should really bring a crossbow or crystal bow for luring the healers anyway. Blowpipe sucks dick for that and if something like this happens you have a backup weapon.
---
I mean, this is literally how you can make your spellbook look in RL+
---
https://i.redd.it/ysm133ogya121.jpg
---
Not that sweaty of a complaint when people are using that in pvp
---
All fruit trees, cacti, belladonna, mushroom, celastrus, redwood, hardwood, seaweed and hespori now too. Feels bad. Appreciate the info my friend
---
I had the idea to make newer, more powerful Waterbirth Creatures. I'll include it in my second edition of this.
---
I'd hands down rather have a lantern. Might need to be stylized a bit differently than the in game one, but it would fit great in the skill list
---
Cuz 4 gloves
---
Over a quarter of people is a superminority to you? Anything to reinforce your bias.
---
I‚Äôm saying what I think. I don‚Äôt think we should just sit and accept the idea that the game shouldn‚Äôt improve is all.
---
My brother just had his name changed by Jagex and is now blocked from changing his name for a whole year.
---
Thank you for giving me this reminder. I had this philosophy originally, but I did not follow it well. I will make the changes in the next version of this proposal; stay tuned!
---
I agree their content is good, I just personally prefer Rargh and Link regardless if they're just rebooting someone else's content.
---
I'd also add Framed to the list
---
Off topic a bit-
---
In your scenario now you're 70/##/60 where str is probably 70-80.  Where do you train from there?  (I am 76/80/71 just wondering)
---
Some people are pissed because sailing didnt pass and cant let it go, others like lower levels dont want more skills to level up, others feel like its moving away from oldschool. If you ask me all of these reasons are completely salty reasons to vote no. The rest of them are voting no because they claim it looks boring, but if you detail the other skills in comparison to warding its in a league of its own in the modern era of osrs which forces me to assume they are just being salty also.
---
Most of the people voting no probably have not even read the entire dev blog, its a completely spiteful choice they are making.
---
Lmao the Elmer gear. This cheap ass noob!
---
Thanks,
---
as for the vorkath thing, and bosses in general who shit out a ton of alchables what they do is they deflate lower tier items or in other words a lot of PK items. Rune, hides etc. while inflating more wanted items.. I.E  is tbow scythe etc.  Overall they inflate the economy by deflating lower tier items into their alchable price.
---
And I agree with the death mechanics, but that would be such a huge change I doubt it would garner enough traction. you have to start small and inch your way forward.
---
I also 1 million percent agree with the boss shatting out profit idea too, unfortunately I think its expected that all bosses do this now or its dead content on release pretty much.
---
Tzhaar for obby cape, shield, and maul drops are nice
---
Since you asked, there are a couple or more things I feel off about,
---
I don't like the niche-scape direction the game took. It just feels weak when they add the best stab weapon for killing this very specific kind of NPC from 53 to 58 attack, or the best crossbow for doing this and that. Items just don't feel good anymore, you just need to have every single item to be efficient if something, as there is no item better than the other. I don't like raids, thought the update was well done and everything, I'm just not a student anymore, I can only play for a few hours a day and I felt like a burden to my team not being reliable to raid with them. I don't like to know everything that's going to happen - the poll thing it's good don't get me wrong, but honestly, I miss being surprised by the updates.

Fletching, cooking, and woodcutting are all medium or low click intensity skills that offer mediocre gold income without requiring skill or much attention. Consider cutting yew longbows, stringing magic longbows, cooking sharks, and cutting magic logs. Magic logs are super low click intensity but modest xp (\~25,000/hr) and gold (\~100,000/hr). It's inefficient in terms of ehp, but the lack of attention it requires is appealing to a player like myself who likes to multitask while playing. Stringing magic longbows will require more clicks, but yields \~ 200k gp and xp per hour (at the time of writing). Again, not the best methods efficiency-wise, but they're easy and don't require much attention if you like to multitask. Slayer is more exciting and can yield much more gp at the higher levels at the cost of increased risk and time spent training.
---
It's fantastic and everything I expected it to be.

Just kick him. Pray melee then pray the other style if he uses mage or range...

That's your opinion and you're entitled to it.
---
If you care LOL?
---
If you've died one in the wildy in 5 years you've definitely never PKed before. Try taking a max set in to the wildy and let me know when you plank to someone in salad robes. You can pretend all you want to be knowledgeable on this subject but the truth is you're talking out of your ass. 
---
Why would chins be in the wilderness if people weren't suppose to kill the people catching them? You try to shame the people killing them because it upsets you that you die while doing it. Accept that it's a risk in the game and move on.
---
Thanks for your extremely convincing argument against it.

I think a merchanting aspect that allows sailors to deliver special boosts (say a food which heals 20 apiece and adds +2 damage to every strike for 10 minutes, for example) which cannot be transported normally would be cool if combined with difficult to fight monsters that have good drops (maybe slayer-gated).  Sailors could set up little shops (like a localized grand exchange) to sell to players.  The grand exchange is cool and all, but I think a lot of players miss the more local economy dynamics and the human aspect of bartering with someone for a price.  If it provided a big enough boost to the buying player to make it worth spending, say, $50k on a boost, while being relatively cheap for the sailor player to produce, sell, and transport, it could be a neat little dynamic.  
---
Obviously there would need to be a mechanism in place to prevent people from just sailing there with the boost and using it themselves (like you'd normally take a combat pot with you).
---
So by stating my opinion on people who already voted is me trying to convince those you haven't voted yet into voting yes ? I'm just saying, read the blog before you vote lol.  
---
A big "?" indeed.
---
go fuck yourself pal
---
This is one of those things where so much time has passed now a lot of this has either become irrelevant or could be vastly improved upon. While I still stand by the notion that a Sailing skill *could* work, if done right, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs fully worth pursuing due to so many other factors. 
---
Ultimately at this point in time, obviously dependant on what happens with Warding tomorrow, I think we need to collectively side-line all of the ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù concepts that people keep getting hung up on. While a totally reworked Sailing pitch, or Artisan, or Dungeoneering or Summoning or whatever might theoretically work if executed well and/or differently, I think it‚Äôs holding us back that - as a community - we keep rehashing &amp; circling back to these same 4 or 5 things just because they're familiar, rather than exploring a few new ones that might be better. Ones that could be even more interesting or fitting for OSRS without needing to feel like we‚Äôre heading over already trodden ground.
---
Pretty sure it is, has the eye-patches and all
---
The partnership polls was a unanimous no though. This is at least 50/50
---
This needs to be marked NSFW due to vulgar language in image.
---
Woosh
---
I have never seen a max player saying they dont want to grind it to get their max capes back as an argument for voting no.
---
Like I asked, I'm trying to understand where the negative opinions are coming from, I see your point. You don't think new skills have a place, or that this skill doesn't look interesting enough to you. That I can respect, at least I can see the reason for the disagreement instead of "warding bad" "warding good" all day long.
---
Insert meme making fun of people voting no by calling them neckbeards whose only argument is that ‚Äúit‚Äôll ruin the game‚Äù.
---
I mean personally I don‚Äôt care either way, but a lot of the memes seem mean spirited and less joking.

Its an anti-anti-scam. Idk how it works, but its a guaranteed scam because there are always at least two players spamming it and they‚Äôre level 3‚Äôs.
---
I was an idiot kid bursting there in Ahrims. Lost my entire bank when I agro'd some rangers and didn't notice üò≠

I‚Äôd be happy if they made the game shorter or gave more tickets
---
Well quite frankly we don't give a shit about his life and he can keep it to himself if he doesn't want it insulted.
---
Compared to range and melee, magic is lackluster- yes. It does have it's place for certain bosses though. Dks, kraken, scorp, archaeologist, Barrows, and a tiny bit of Sire.
---
The problem isn't that magic is too weak, the problem is that most mobs are too resistant to it. Magic defense isn't calculated the same way range and melee defense is calculated. Magic defense (for pvm) is the targets magic level plus their passive magic defense bonus. It does not rely on base defense level, which for most mobs is significantly lower than their magic level.
---
So let's use Cerberus as an example- a boss that absolutely no one uses magic on. Cerby has a def level of 100, magic level of 220, a stab def bonus of +50, and magic def bonus of +100.
---
If you were using a stab weapon on him, you'd be fighting against his defense level + stab bonus, which is +150 total stab resistance.
---
If you tried magic, you'd be dealing with his magic level (220) PLUS his magic defense (100). Add them all together, and his magic resistance is +320, compared to +150 stab resist. 
---
Warding is just robes. It wouldn't change the meta for any endgame content, nor would it come even close to making magic bossing viable. The reason range and melee are meta on most bosses is because, well, they're just weak to that style.
---
If we want magic to be more viable for pvm, either the system would need to be reworked (a complete magic def overhaul) or bosses stats would need to be readjusted (rebalancing every boss).
---
Warding isn't going to be the solution. Some sets will have niche uses, but even the best set is still second to Ahrims, which is already second to Ancestral.
---
imagine pking on osrs and not roat pkz :joy: never caught a black chin in my life you're reaching bud. you're defensive cause you deep down know its the life of a lame
---
Yup, many people have expressed that. I'll be changing that in the next version to make it more balanced. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Chinned 6 accounts to 99 range. If you do mm2 on ur alt yeah, it's worth. Mm1 dunq not really.
---
I'm just getting all the quests and medium diaries done at the moment. 5 medium diaries, 6 quests, 6 miniquests left.
---
I have 2 phoenixs with no clothes it hates me
---
I don't really understand what you mean by this. The idea behind Brown &gt; Red &gt; Black chins is they get progressively better. You can stop at red chins and make decent money and xp with no risk or move to blacks and make good money and xp but be in a dangerous area.
---
A boss like venenatis or revs would never be in the game if they weren't in the wilderness. The entire set of rewards and profits is balanced around the fact that it's in a dangerous area and you may die.
---
Then you probably should be working. Just got rid of my amphetamine addiction a week and a half ago, so I'm getting high on life and weed rn üòÑ
---
Is that bonus before or after you switch to a staff with auto cast? Or do you manual cast with melee weapon.
---
Basically a meme about Venezuelans farming dragon bones/hide because it earns them more irl money than an actual job in Venezuela would.

Posts are from the community and their success/failure is determined by the community.
---
More people agree with posts that are pro-Warding than to those that are against it... If the ratios swapped we would only see posts against Warding but 2007scape has made its stance pretty clear.
---
I haven't yet seen what I would consider a "good" post against Warding because almost every point that argues against Warding is a point that I consider an argument For Warding.
---
Either Warding is nice piece of content that fits OSRS or it's the worst skill idea ever seen and has no place in the game.
---
Seemingly people fall on either side of that line or they don't care either way.
---
You can link the mobile account to a standard email IIRC and log in normally on a PC. Where and how you do this though, I'm not sure. But I know it's doable at least
---
How long did it take 77-99?
---
Only voted no bc the purple and warding symbol was made by mod west
---
I did this probably three times on super promising attempts. Plenty of brews and restores left. Late stage waves. THREE TIMES.
---
Thanks I have a maths degree so you can trust me
---
I feel like Amethyst would just shapeshift into a fighter torso and slam people, lol.
---
Define substantially. 10% below 75% and 10% below 50% are different in the context of OSRS.
---
The short answer is that most players are fine with the ability to make magic armor, but they don't feel it needs its own skill when it could work under RC or Crafting. Also, Skills tend to be pretty impactful to the wider game so they can be harder to justify than a boss or such since they'd only become more relevant and required with time.
---
I was against the idea, but when voicing it I was ripped apart for daring to not support warding. By the time the polls opened I was bitter enough that I wouldn't even consider it. We'll see what happens, maybe it will pass and maybe it won't. But if it just barely fails, that's something the community is going to have to look at. The pro-warders will have been the ones to put the nail in the "no" result, ironically enough.
---
With that being said, Trump didn't need only 25% of the vote to win. But otherwise, I entirely agree with the metaphor.
---
Are you trolling or are you actually trying to claim that you dont try to get people to vote yes after you said no voters are preventing the groth of the game, follow by a "but if the poll passes uneducated votes are fine!"?
---
i wouldnt recommend zezimas chat lol
---
put all of your money into crystal keys they will double in price tomorrow with the update
---
I responded to more people with an actual opinion, why'd you decide to respond to this one?
---
Which ultimately stabilizes the economy, right?
---
Anti-Warding logic kills me.
---
‚ÄòWe want a new skill to be perfect!‚Äô
---
‚ÄúWell, even the existing skills don‚Äôt live up to that expectation‚Äù
---
‚ÄòSo put these updates into fixing old skills!‚Äô
---
‚ÄúOkay, lets roll Warding into Runecrafting‚Äù
---
‚ÄòNoooo you‚Äôre devaluing the 300 hours I spent grinding Lavas! Runecrafting is ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùsupposed to be‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù a hard skill!‚Äô
---
‚Äú...‚Äù
---
In other words, a new skill must be of higher quality than pretty much anything else in the game. But don‚Äôt update anything currently in the game to that level of quality, because the the game wasn‚Äôt that good before and *muh nostalgia*.
---
I upvote brainlet No Voter memes not because I think they are dumb, but because they are downright impossible to please and refuse to admit it.
---
Is there a set date for the pvp "integrity lul" changes? I'm looking to get my hands on a sweet potentially discounted dinh's.
---
Lmfaooooooo
---
If you actually read my comments you'd see I did say only killing chin hunters is lame. That's why I 1. PK at other spots and 2. Kill the other Pkers there as well.
---
The fact that you have to PK on a private server further solidifies the fact that you have no idea what you're talking about. If you had a 6b bank and say you'd fight in a max set you'd be PKing in the main game.
---
I'm pretty sure they ended that promotion.
---
Wow, the no voters really are sophisticated and smart.
---
&gt;  There's probably a lot of ways overlay plugins can safe from that
---
Since you are still talking about overlays for some reason, I'll assume you've read up on canvas fingerprinting then? Well no there aren't the whole point of the hash is it's virtually impossible to reverse so good luck to the clients trying to match it.
---

---
No, I‚Äôm just curious. If they are removing names for being offensive, why let them be registered to begin with?
---
I was the opposite. I voted no to warding but yes to some of the features.

I‚Äôm so proud of you. Great work.

Lmfao üòÇ Yeah, that's RNG

You really are a miserable jackass ain't ya?

Except that I don't care that he called me names. Nothing about the situation I posted bothered me. It was funny to me how much he freaked out over 1 kq kill. And it's funny to me how mad you're getting about this. Maybe it was you I crashed üòÇ imagine missing a tick to check the cave 1600 times in an attempt to not mildly inconvenience an ironman.
---
No, are you?

Getting that Runecrafting out of the way is smart.
---

I ran out of scales doing Jad once so I had to pull the remaining darts out of my blowpipe and throw them manually. It was working pretty well until I missed a prayer flick. F
---
I'm sorry. I really tried to understand what you wrote but I don't get it. Not trying to be a dick. Are you saying that sailing and artisan are both less 2007 than warding?
---
As for the death mechancis it doesnt have to build traction... The current death mechanics were stated be temporary 5 years ago. On that statement alone they can go right ahead and implement an integrity change whenever on it.
---
what time will results release? directly after it closes?
---
I'm looking to try the fight caves soon. I have 66 defense and 72 ranged, so blowpipe is not an option for me. Is rcb with broad bolts then switching to diamond bolts for jad a decent plan, or is there something else I should use?
---
Ik this is a joke but I feel this way all the time lmao.
---
So you don't know what warding is, but you want it to pass and you're getting angry over it? Epic.
---
You don't even need to safe spot him, step back 1 sq, hit twice, he teleports you, repeat.
---
I looked up on google big things happening march 24. Jim Parsons birthday was one of the top things, as well as the other two... so I said those things news/entertainment sites were highlighting don‚Äôt matter because warding does... And I did this in an ironic fashion.
---
No thanks.
---
It can be tricky due to how spells work, but there is a lot more room for weapon types than weapons like SotD and weapons like a Trident. Two I'd love to see are Magic Spec weapons and Magic KO Weapons.
---
Magic doesn't really use special attacks and even if we don't get a Magic AGS, I think there is more room to offer weapons that use this aspect of the game. For example, imagine if the Imbue Heart effect was from a special attack instead of an inventory item; it may be a bit tedious to bring a staff swap but you may also just use that as your main staff to avoid a swap. Similar empowering specs could still happen with future staves though. Or you could have a simple spec that just made your next combat spell use no runes. Or even an ACB style spec that increases the accuracy of next combat spell.
---
For KO Weapons, the main thing new staves can play around is speed. An old idea of mine is a staff that casts all spells a speed slower, but it offers 30% Magic Damage. This means it would be lower DPS than your SotD or such (at least if balanced properly), but it would believe higher bursts of damage. One of the Armors with Warding does play around with something like this with a robe set that increases cast speed. So more weapons that lowered or increased speed could be neat to see.
---
And one other idea that comes to mind is Magic Penetration as its been called. This is pretty much the Brimstone Ring's effect to ignore magic defence which is mainly useful in PvP. But there was talk of potentially adding armors with similar effects and the same could be true of weapons too. So there is certainly room to offer a bit more diverse choice in type of magic weapon than just the two we've been getting even if some are niche.
---
&gt;We remove both pro-warding and anti-warding posts if they break rules. Same case for users. For example, if you go around posting how you voted or telling players how to vote in posts that have nothing to do with Warding, it starts to become spam. I've also removed posts that are just "vote yes" or "vote no" and nothing else since we have at least a dozen of similar posts every day providing discussion and not just making a statement. And another reason a post or comment can get removed is it if it breaks the second rule by coming off as too insulting or antagonistic; there definitely have been some like that we haven't removed but as the poll has gone on I've been more careful with these posts, especially if they don't come off or are not marked as humor.
---
thats the only slightly useful thing it does and that gap could easily be filled just by adding that robe set to crafting. most of the stuff on warding is dead content already
---
This is pretty cool
---
Sure bud.
---
As your pots tick down, you will gain a max hit on some levels with the torture compared to the fury. If you don't use potions, then you can just stay with a fury, but you should really use potions.
---
Probably not best to nerf it. I'd say +10 +12 +14 could work fine; mystic would be a close rival to Ancient then, but I don't think that is too bad of a thing.
---
Any new skills will fail if:
---
*-- skill type (reasons given by the community)*
---
-- They are buyables (because they are gold sinks or people don't want them)
---
-- They are slow like runecraft (slow, boring, not engaging)
---
-- Are too fast like fletching (too easy, game turning into rs3)
---
-- Are made up skills (it ruins immersion - some retards actually said this)
---
-- Are combat skills (we already have the combat triangle)
---
-- Involve killing monsters (devalues slayer)
---
-- literally anything else (it didn't exist in 07, I'm voting no)
---
And these are just some examples at the top of my head. Good fucking luck pleasing everyone lmao
---
You like it? Fine, just use your imagination and pretend it's in the game. It's that simple.
---
Firstly that seems super pedantic to point out. Also no evidence to back it up, finally changing in integral part of tribridding came with a lot of push back in general from what I remember. We shouldnt change the mechanics of pking, we should entice new people to try it out by making it easier to try and more forgiving if you die. not the mechanics themselves for the most part.

Question: I'm missing nearly every holiday event music track. Do I need them for the music Cape? If so that's pretty annoying being time locked like that

I see marks of grace have been going up in value the last few weeks, when I started they were valued at 15k, lowest I saw was 7k, currently almost 10k. I have a full graceful, all recolored, 110 marks currently stashed.

I think the warding poll has this sub bloodthirsty and ready for war lmao there is zero hostile intent behind my original comment. Interesting to see how people are interpreting it though. Guess I should have phrased it differently, maybe the astirik came off too uppity idk. Jeezus

Warding won't pass. Mark my words.
---
Care to explain how alienating potentially 1/3rd of your playerbase on potentially every poll question ever would be a good decision ever?
---
Warding is going to fail the poll because it‚Äôs a boring concept, not because it wasn‚Äôt fleshed out.
---
how about a nice egg?
---
You only need them to trim the music cape, if you have all non-holiday tracks you cam get the untrimmed version
---
you can search OSRS on thingiverse, there are tons of models, including the mole pet!
---
I'm using the logic those voting no are openly using. This update is needed for the integrity of the games economy and fits almost perfectly with the 2007 meta.  People are voting no just because they'll lose their max cape and using a bullshit excuse.
---
The wiki mentions holiday event music is not required for it :)

---

---
Dead to veterans yes but not new people and it does offer more items than just me get ahrims me get ancestral eventually
---
Interesting. Probably a good move, especially if the quest is more dialog heavy. It may not have as tough of a boss as DS2 or such either... Then again, the Light Puzzle will probably be the real boss.
---
I‚Äôd vote yes to this
---
While I‚Äôm not colorblind, I think a different shape/silhouette is probably the best route to take here.
---
Im personally satisfied with how magic turned out from release. 
---
Magic is now at least theatening in pvp. Normal spellbook is better dps than ancients but ancients has more utility/less inv space, trident makes magic viable/attractice for pvm, and zulrah and raids require using magic.
---
It was a tiny screw and did not do any harm to the cat. A cat randomly eating something is funny.

People are entitled to their vote - whatever that is. Democracy is what it is; there is no "right" choice, only the most popular one. Have your opinion, even state why, but it's stupid to insult people because their opinion is different to yours.

Couldn't the same be asked about alienating 2/3rds of your playerbase on potentially every poll question ever would be a good decision ever?

They wouldnt be able to out dps melee weapons in a fight, right now theyre in use a bunch because you can easily 1 tick from MSB into claw/ags/maul, and then just tele out when youre out of specs
---
If we put a huge penalty on teleporting/got rid of torso for the most part i don't think ranging in melee gear would be optimal compared to say a d scim in melee gear. it would be better for KO potential but i dont think you would win many fights that you werent able to spec them out.

You're so deluded. You're not using the reasons that the no voters are giving. You're using the reasons that some of the propaganda Yes voters made up in order to criticize the No.
---
It's not going to stop people from space-baring through the dialogue to unlock the rewards, also, shouldn't the dialogue be important enough to not be skipped in the first place during a quest? Seems pushy to take away announcing something like that considering they've done it in the past.

The skill should be more fleshed out with at least a working alpha of certain aspects of the skill, and with Jagex track record of releasing broken content (zulrah drop table, twisted bush, windertodt drops, zmi alter xp rates, ect) I don't trust them to get this right first try

Trim my armor while you're at it, please
---
What is your RSN?
---
OP, mind if I come over for a few hours?
---
Actually curious how you think the losing of untradeables etc will make the ags price go up? It's low price because arma is camped because the armour is expensive asf because of pvm, and the ags has a very niche use.
---
Did they have a red cape on?
---
I find it funny that it was my last 99 and now it‚Äôs the skill I have the most experience in. (Around 40m+) I never realized how much it was used in the end game
---
Imagine thinking it never could.
---
It's the same as the RuneScape time that's in game
---
So it stops at 4:30 RuneScape time(you can check it in your cc tab)
---
It‚Äôs just a lot easier to go after those arguments than ones like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not interested in it‚Äù or ‚ÄúI feel like most of it would be better distributed amongst other skills.‚Äù
---
I'd love for this to be an official gamemode. To me the appeal/"prestige" of ironmen is that everyone knows you acquired the gear you have from the source. If you have an ely, you didn't kill vorkath for 250 hours to go buy one on the GE; you killed corp 4000 times (probably).
---
Having to endlessly restock on fundamental supplies by doing 10000+ zulrah, post-99 herb runs, post-99 blood runecrafting etc. is a huge turnoff for me personally.
---
Imagine if they did something like Lucid Nightmare maze from WoW, guide readers would be fucking MAD.
---
When it comes to Reddit, it do be like that. If you don't want to get downvoted and bullied, you had better have the correct opinion.
---
Bluetooth mouse support is something I'm interested in seeing the current opinions on.

Laughed way too hard at this because this has happened before.

Sounds like a bug, report it
---
Assuming youre not bossing. Why wouldnt it make you more money? wasnt the whole point that its better gp but less xp since you cant do it where you want?
---
you'd have no problem on a computer, it's def because of the track pad.
---
I was making points until you decided to go full morally superior, cba. And I like rc actually so there's that.
---
Too bad, they should patch the shit. And once again it's not scamming lmfao. It's like saying a university is scamming you because they're teaching you knowledge they know but you don't.
---
So like basically I came to the realization that I can focus on whatever I want now and I think I was overwhelmed.

Pet farming @ vorkath and then I‚Äôm sort of doing clues and mining pet hunting at MLM

but why fletch tho

Camping for aby demon head, I really want the red slayer helmet. Currently about 12k kc dry.

Max cape inherits the hp cape's effect which boosts health regen, that effect stacks with the regen bracelet. DFS adds defensive bonusses to compensate for the lack of justiciar.

Just because you didn't get your way doesn't mean the system is suddenly flawed. That's such an unaware and immature line of thinking.

do oak doors! Im at 90 con atm but banked 99.

Yeah it is actually nothing like that but gl scamming people. You could also say the people at the ge spamming doubling 2 trade and scamming people are not actually scamming because the person handed it over willingly. Guess what you can justify it however you want but it is still scamming. All of this is even assuming you are legit and are not just trying to steal accounts which is very unlikely.

They should just do this on an unannounced and rolling basis.

People want new skill mechanics but if it ventures too far then it becomes a minigame. People say it doesn‚Äôt sound fun when half of the skills in the game involve bank standing or clicking the same couple of spots for hours on end... there has to be compromise if we‚Äôll ever get a new skill.
---
There are literally around twelve total people that have killed Telos at max enrage. It's one of the hardest things to do out of any MMO I know, it took over a year for the first person to do it. It's something Woox didn't manage to do after putting countless hours into Telos, and he's just as legendary on RS3 as he is on OSRS. You can shit on RS3 for a lot of reasons, but the bossing being braindead isn't one of them.
---
That's just a turoth which is a really low level monster so I doubt it would be used
---

---

---
You said it yourself... if you want fun then play a mini-game. But Warding doesn't fit as a minigame because of the depth and breadth of its impact to the broader game. I understand your point COMPLETELY. I do, please believe me. 
---
Training skills is incentivised via access to other content that is fun to partake in. Once you get past unlocking the top tier content you're either doing it to max out, get a pet, or gain total exp unless it's a skill you take particular enjoyment in.
---
The devs have already said there would be a Warding related minigame if it passes so if that's fun enough people would train via that method the same way they train FM via Wintertodt etc. Or they would train Warding normally to gain additional advantage in that minigame. 
---
Do you understand where I'm coming from though? Warding touches on so many other things that it can't be streamlined into a minigame style activity unless it gets butchered in scope.
---
The mindset that a skill has to be fun and novel to get implemented is what will stop anything getting implemented. Unless the devs catch lightning in a bottle with one of their ideas then its absurdly unlikely that any proposed skill will match all of the criteria that people demand. And an additional restriction they face is that they're expected to deliver to you a skill with sufficient utility to the game, making it fun to train, making it fit the OSRS spirit, not break current metas, designing ways it will interact with the current set of skills... all before any of us even get a first look at the skill, and when we do get a first glimpe we tell them to improve it. They do that and come back and we tell them no again?
---
It's a catch-22 where they have to meet these demands but what they *can* get designed you don't like because they don't have go-ahead from management to design it further *because the community doesn't like it*. This mindset will see OSRS fielded by a skeleton crew with no updates or bug fixes in just a few years. OSRS needs to be open to change and variety. *It's not a game you're intended to complete*, so why not give more variety to playstyles that I've been familiar with? All I want is something new to do. I've already done nearly fucking everything except ToB and that doesn't even interest me.
---
And if you'll forgive my whataboutisms....
---
* Consider the impact that Warding will have on the prices of the materials used to train it, you get increased profit from the usual drops you receive because demand for unused shit like Rune Daggers and Adamant Fullhelms goes up as they get eaten up into another skill tree. Consider how many mith items you leave on the ground when Slaying. What's the point of them existing in the game if they aren't utilised elsewhere? They just get alched, if you can be bothered to pick them up...
---
* Then about the affect Warding will have on Smithing or Crafting or other skills that intersect with Warding. People will change their training methods. I would say that a skill being boring to train is also improved by having more variety, not less (i.e. Smithing &gt; Blast Furnace &gt; Warding-related alternative). Of course if a minigame can fit in, sure by all means.
---
* What about the fact that things like Rune Platebodies are so depressed in value that their GE price is below their alch value... If Rune wasn't tethered to alch price it would be cheaper than Mith. Their tethering to alch value doesn't' represent the value they provide to an account, only that there are so bloody many of them being *dumped* because you can't do anything else aside from alch them. The game *needs* something to take this abundance out of it.

That shit is right in the picture.

When does this ever happen?
---
I am so sorry.
---
I usually buy all the required items, put them on my bank and then do the quest "blind"
---
? So racists aren't wrong?
---
Uhh...you are aware that Jagex already made their sailing proposal and it failed, right?
---
The proposal is right here, since you clearly haven't read it:
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Dev_Blog:_Sailing_-_An_Overview
---
Now, are you seriously going to tell me that Jagex's proposal involves the same level work that gentletractor's does? 
---
By the way, is someone standing behind you with a gun to your head forcing you to reply to my comment? I get that you are a shill and want to attack anyone who isn't as firmly attached to Jagex's nuts as you are, but if you haven't even read the fucking sailing proposal why would you even comment?
---
I'm gong to vote yes just because of this
---
I shaved yesterday, too, for a meeting at work.
---
Guy and his dog?
---
Sorry I replied to the wrong person, I was meant to reply to a comment suggesting that Jagex can detect clients people use
---
Flip DZN's until you're around 5m then move on to the higher value items
---
This is a really easy method, very easy to stay on top of spawns and not get overwhelmed. I recommend at least 80 base stats.

---
Just got max.
---
Democracy shows no favour to any demographic besides the majority. Why should white's votes be more important? Intelligent people's? Female's? Long time fans Vs new people?
---
My point is that everyone is entitled to their opinions regardless of how informed of one side or the other's arguments, or none at all. That's how you get a vote that makes the most people happy (and sometimes also the most unhappy).
---
Pvper with blood hound pet or something...? Guy and his dog.... idk
---
Not going to pass.
---
I do CoX all the time. That can be solo'd too.
---
Wintertodt can be done in a group or solo'd.
---
GWD can be done in a group or solo'd.
---
What possible harm could come from giving a multi-option on Gaunlet?

Just remove uniques or nerf the droptable for multi groups. I am here for content with friends, not soloscape or sick money rewards.

garbage skill and unreasonably slow. the money is "good" if you can't muster up the ability to pvm

Yeah imagine caring about one of the few things that's hard to do in this game

Yes i think so because you have freedom to go to bossing with greaters,avis,hellhounds etc.
---
Time to merch

Yikes dude

That tifu post was even worse than this meme good job
---
I mean a large portion of content is literally gated by the wilderness. I agree with you that it's typically more valuable BECAUSE it's gated there, but "just ignore the content you want to partake in" isnt really a good argument.

Are you going for cash or xp or both? If xp then is it farming or Herblore or both?
---
When reporting someone that is breaking multiple rules, is there an order or preference for which rule you report for? For example lets say there's a bot spamming for a dice game that scams anyone who plays. Should I report for "scamming", "player-run games of chance", or "macroing or use of bots"

They can do what they want but its a stupid reason. If people have fun doing it why stop it?
---
Steven with bulwark, let it be done
---
Thanks bro .
---
I personally wasn't a fan of artisan as a skill itself. I love the concept and think it's starting to finally be looked at a bit with things like Farming Contracts. It feels more at home in that, but potentially with a global contract system that offers rewards. It just didn't quite feel like a skill in its entirety. That said that's only my opinion.
---
Does that make you get the Olm pet?
---
wouldnt your cash stack be left untouched since you have no money in said magic items? If anything youll have more buying power, not less when things go down.
---
I've seen a lot of people bashing the 75% threshold requirement, and although I do understand their pain, and I also have a sinking feeling that while I want it to pass, it will get near the threshold but still be a no, which seems really frustrating, I feel that the game being conservative in that way and possibly turning down a good number of positive updates is better than the alternative of it all going to shit like last time.
---
Basically, I hope Warding passes, but feel it won't, and despite that I still think the current voting mechanics are good for the overall health of the game. I just hope we get some of features of the skill, even with a no vote. Like get imbues away from NMZ! It's EZPZ exp but it's sooo boring.
---
The problem with converting your account to standard is that the effort input to attain your UIM stats is much more effort compared to achieving those stats on a normal account.  I would say leave the UIM as-is now and play the normal account, or put membership on the UIM to get gain access goals to strive towards.
---
Unlocking the member areas gives you a LOT more goals to strive towards on your UIM. And because there's so much more content, the grind between achieving new content is reduced massively so the gameplay is more consistently rewarding.
---
I did the same thing but I think I was 72 thieving.
---
Most require range. I haven't done that new one but I think it's weak to crush?
---
Man, if you cant distinguish those symbols you shouldnt pvp with overheads
---
Bruh... spwnt 3 weeks grinding barrows for Elites &gt; Masters. Got 1 Mimic in like 28 caskets...

Not to mention an underwater area and FOSSIL ISLAND name and all lmao
---
I cant tell if you're trolling. Are you? If not you're just a lowlife scumbag
---
you should flip ligma
---
Yeah but if each time a skill is polled the argument is "well people *must* like the current state so don't change anything" then nothing will change and the game gets stale.
---
That's like asking how many people can afford to train construction, or herblore, or crafting. Everyone. They'll have to earn the money to sure, bit they will. The poor people can go and splash (I'm seriously still baffled this is a proposed thing) to afk for vis at lower rates.

The war was lost long ago. PVP is dead, which is ironic since the PVP copmmunity is what brought back OSRS.

There hasnt been any meaningful updates in years,  people love their pixels and effeciency so much it wont change. Ill upvote you for old times sake but your fighting a lost war.
---
Ill continue logging on for about an hour or 2 every few days and pk a bit and then realize the wildy/PVP is dead and then log off. until 1 day I wont log on anymore . The things your arguing about with people are things that were common sense not to long ago, oh how the times have changed.

If Warding fails I'd like them to try either the Foraging skill suggestion.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9uhl7a/foraging_the_last_gathering_skill/
---
Or if possible it would be cool with a stealth skill, sneaking around, could be tied with Thieving and Agility since neither of those have much to do with actual stealth.
---

I've seen like 2 poll questions that got under 50% since I started playing osrs, one of which was about mtx. Like half the playerbase just votes yes to literally everything

---
Was walking around the wizards South of Falador one day and found a santa hat. Don't know why they were fighting the wizards with no food.
---
I‚Äôd assume both of those would make the market go way up for whatever items are needed to finish those. Warding materials have already gone up just in case, so I guess the crash would be selling them off if warding fails.
---
I really like it, but I wonder how it'd look if the purple was a shade darker.

reverse psych, they want you to say yes

Pure pking isnt about accuracy its about k0 potential with max hits. Getting attack just lowers ur k0 potential. Its like saying get 60 attack on ur gmauler to make training faster

A couple of people have asked this already, but if Warding doesn't pass, will there be another survey on whether the idea or concept of warding can be put into other skill areas?
---
Duradel pet
---
So I‚Äôm not the best person to ask but here I go...
---
In a nutshell warding, a possible new skill,  May or may not be coming out tomorrow (you still have time to cast your votes, in game) 
---
That skill is going to be like smithing for magic gear. 
---
That being said plenty of expensive in game gear will drop as people can and will make their own in the process of leveling their new skill. 
---
Me not understanding fully how big changes like this affect the economy of the game made me scared my money will devalue...
---
From all the responses so far it seems I had it backwards, bht again it may not even happen.
---
You can try for the +5 from stews but I'd HIGHLY recommend getting 72 instead given how rare a +5 is in comparison.
---
Oh right the nvm mb.
---
hoes mad
---
Thought baby moles were pink
---
Also its OP
---
In the time it took you to type that you could've googled a time converter
---
damn man that sucks that you had those 99s, but unfortunately they probably wont or cant because it is 2 different games with some people who play both on the same account. Starting all over is a pain but I feel like you'll fall in love with the game again if you havent played since before 2010. I definitely did, but it was easier for me since i never had one 'main' acc and was accountless when osrs came out

You're saying ironmen use tent whips for slayer to be fair?
---
That‚Äôs a damn shame. Was through all the shit of when they turned off the wild and created clan wars n shit. I remember they had like a daily spin with a goblin in the middle. I was like ‚Äúwtf is this BS‚Äù a week later they updated the game and didn‚Äôt touch it for years. Haven‚Äôt even tried to hop on RS3. I just now created a acc that‚Äôs lvl 3 but I have lvl 40 fishing, mining, and woodcutting. I always loved grinding those non combat skills and wish there was a way I could use my old acc that I spend so much time on

Doesn't sound very in depth though.

Move those goalposts a bit more, clicking a single spot isn't hard in any way.

Plot twist: Steve is just Nieve after converting. She faked her own death to live the life she's always wanted.
---
It's a meme poking fun at people who overly censor stuff, who now in turn censor random shit to play along.
---
I for one collect all the untradeable breads she gives you. Maze random is actually decent money, especially for low levels.
---
It would be nice to have a toggle to turn them off for people like yourself who dont want them though.

Why is this gilded? ü§¢ü§Æ

upwards of 180 QP, and every quest i've done was with this man. Legend
---
I like how you think ahead by having a backup plan! 
---
Now if Warding fails the ballot, now we have a backup skill that pleases the normies, gets money for Jagex without partnerships, and... most importantly, a way to suck GentleTractor's cock for internet points once again! 
---
I love you guys so much.
---
You mean like the stale baguette?
---
I should have definitely said why in that comment it was prob deserved, but it is interesting to see how it‚Äôs faked isn‚Äôt it?
---
Darkscape was flawed but so great I miss it too.
---
I'm saying that ironmen use the dragon lance for stab damage when doing slayer. Dragon lance is upgraded by a better defender if you're not using a dfs. Yes, on boss slayer tasks people use tent whip.
---
I mean I agree it's against the rules and shouldn't be tolerated, but telling them to just work to fix their country is naive. Have you seen what is going on on the streets? Despite the government having tanks and everything, these people are demonstrating and what else. "Just throwing over the government" is difficult when you're dead because you starved btw.
---
If you want pet do solos. Solo = more points, more loot. W9 = more exp. Because of the exp drop when the game ends.
---
Nice lol. Congrats man!
---
Foraging sounds pretty alright, it reminds me of herbalism in WoW, It would compliment herblore pretty well, could be used for cooking, maybe crafting. I'm not sure what kind of items would be valuable with this skill, I didn't really know for hunter either; hunter brought us exploding hamsters for range training, which nobody could have expected, maybe foraging could have an item just as unique.
---
Stealth would require a complete overhaul of how combat and poking works, and otherwise would only be useful for avoiding hostile monsters, it'd be a lot harder to implement than foraging.
---
Ive always thought the snakeskin looked way better than d hide
---
I was only considering the examples you gave. Yeah the bones seems OP.
---
Why are they all ticked tho
---
Just got that one lmao
---
Ayyy shoutouts to Boise.
---
But fuck r/boise
---
Technically they could manually set your stats if your rs3 account isn't banned, but there's no chance in hell they would do it.
---
Nah. If it was possible/they wanted to do it, they already would have. Sorry man!
---
Lost 2k red chins the other day.
---
I laughed way too hard at this
---
Eh, I doubt it. I didn‚Äôt start playing ironman til like a year ago and the memes been circulating quite a bit longer than that. Plus that comment was obviously a joke.
---
I think staying inside and providing for your family might be better than fighting a totalitarian regime.
---
You generally wont have perfect rotations which drops the kills/h down from the theoretical max of 120.
---
That means wrong and a circle means correct? I assume
---
Probably, or people getting mad if it passes and selling their gear because they'll try to quit.
---
Its not. Thats silver.
