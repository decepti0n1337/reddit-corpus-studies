That’s my swamp man
---
---
---
Damn, what a bitch. How can you be mad that you lost to the masterpiece that is 'Swampletics Exposed'?
---
Nice
---
It's only profitable now because it's new and BIS, and it isn't even good gp/hr for higher levelled accounts which are the group the buff was supposed to appease.
---

---
Having the price depend entirely on how willing people are to skip the task is absolutely horrendous game design. As it stands the price will drop rapidly until people decide they'd rather skip and do Vorkath/Zulrah for money, then the price will gradually decline as people accept that it's another 18k XP/hr task that is very likely going to cost them money. For it to not be dead content it needs to at least be afkable, pay for itself in supply cost, or outright be profitable. It'll be none of those things in a few months of people grinding it on task drop rate.
---
That's not the definition of BiS. Ferocious gloves are bis in every situation except few places like dks and cox (where you still bring them). Serp helm has more str and def bonus and is bis for melee situations.

In my minds eye I pictured some humanoid (don't know exactly what would make sense, but work with me) riding them and having the new neit Helm + lance + shield
---
It’s not even remotely shocking he lost to content related to swampletics. This community praises swamp man like he’s a god
---
R
---
Truly a cultured reference.
---
That’s my sparc mac
---
ye as seeing the video this idea got in wrong hands, i remember we only used to scout for clans we were about to fight/scout their regroup worlds, or if it was about decent money like glory runners, clue scrollers at 50 ports etc. 
---
But using this at locations where ppl only risk 200k and it happens back2back2back2back2back is just annoying af. tbh i would've prob just sold my bank and went to staking if this happend to me lol. wildy already packed af, imagine being scouted first real quick so pker's can prepare to instant tb/freeze... ripppppp
---
17 cb actually
---
Scum
---
He's actually pretty cute ngl
---
What a damn child, that sub 2 minute video of swampletics exposed was more creative then him flinching and tic eating some god damn fucking monsters.
---
Doesn't change much for doing steel. You still make solid gp/hr and Smith xp. Coal bag just makes it a bit quicker. And makes mith or addy or rune much quicker.
---
He won best video maker or something. Not best individual video. I voted a long time ago so I don’t really remember the nominees or the categories
---
You spoke it into existence
---
Wouldn’t expect anything less from a bunch of man child’s at a RuneScape convention, how immature
---
Most people don't really care about today, cuz it's mostly just the competition for content creators. Its not really even a competition, but more like a "hand selected by jagex as the best"
---
Tomorrow is when all the juicy stuff gets revealed like raids 3
---
I mean, ideally I agree with you. I'm just stating a more practical **post-development** chance would be to up their slayer level. A boss would have 1000% been more appropriate but they're not going to add a post-release boss as an afterthought.
---
And those thousands of people would do the exact same thing. Be super excited the first day and hop world's a bunch. Then quickly realise it does nothing, and instead just be helpful on the world's they play on, like all pmods are...
---
You just seem to have a hatred for pmods and think they're all about vanity.
---
Okay you're fucking blind it seems.
---
Where's all the red shirts?
---
Oh god i don’t want to end up like you
---
Sorry, I was high as fuck when I posted that comment. Just noticed now. Thanks lmao
---
Nah.
---
His content is good and enjoyable but the quality people like Settled, J1mmy and Lil Smokey put into their videos you can see why they won
---
Generalised it for a reason ;)
---
Nah, just legit passion for streamers and that's just what he brings to the table.

I frequent Faux, Sick Nerd, Sparc, and B0aty. And Sparc is just something else honestly.

Agreed. The music and comedy alone. Then get into the little nuances where he truly engages the chat. Pausing the stream to blow chat up to a real banger while dancing it around while everyone spams emotes. Dude really is an entertainer.

Damn was this made by Rendi.

My average yields seem to be lower when I use Attas. No proof, it just seemed that way to me. Although I did always get a min of 6.

---
Personally I don't really care at all, but completely understand the desire to see someone who you feel like you know in the flesh, I guess it's part of forming human relationships, which I'm a bit shit at lol.
---
Yews, lobsters, mine shit. Make bars. Go to orges on corsair and range safe spot them. Ankous if you have the stats. Etc.
---
If they add dailies that are good enough exp/hr they would be balanced by only being able to do them 1 or 2 times per day. So that means if you want the best exp for your time spent you will do the daily. You're not forced the same way you're not forced to get a dpick from the wilderness. There's nothing wrong with logging in for a specific purpose, but there's no proof that not having dailies would cause those people not to log in at all. Why balance the content around being limited per day? Why not create content that gets people to log in whenever they want, which could be more or less than once per day?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ddeymq/slightly_better_version_with_without_green_screen/ From the new meme at runefest.
---
Many bis come from short grinds and easy content.
---
Barrows gloves, zenyte (bit harder but also way more significant of an upgrade for range, mage and melee), mage arena 2 capes.
---
Even some of the more iconic ones are just from low req bosses that you can group.
---
You have beautiful hair 😩
---
Absolutely not. Not everything needs a pet
---
Yes. They just did the golden gnomes early this year.
---
Except you are wrong. It’s more the sense of community with tribe events and infection mansion events which are unmatched by any other rs streamer!

Even if 90% of his viewers are there for giveaways, that's more incentive to watch then people have to watch half the other streamers.

B0aty's 5th ironman and unironic deaths and ASMR eating sessions. Sick Nerd camping minecraft or Elder Scrolls or streaming 5h of Raids 1. Faux talking down to anyone who has a noobie question or a differing opinion. And who's Mammal? That guy from OSRS Ironman gets what he's been after vids?

You might not be one, idk. But why do people make 1 def pures? What's the benefit?
---
I mean he's not being nice about it, but it's a valid reason to not like someone's videos. But your condescending response to him voicing his opinion isn't any better.
---
I personally don't like rendi's personality and style, but I'm not gunna say his videos are shit. They take a lot of time and effort and has some pretty good editing.
---
I did pyramid plunder for the last levels. It was honesty fun for me
---
Stuff like this is why he didn’t win. People don’t like an asshole regardless of their content. He gives off this real overzealous dickhead kinda vibe and a lot of people don’t like him for that.
---
you can get them with 40 def
---
Damn lol, he got pretty unlucky with his genetics
---
That would make you the 10 year old then
---
Officially, no. They know that banning Runelite players will cause an uproar, and haven't banned anyone for using the client as far as I'm aware.
---
There have been rumors that using a client with a custom overlay may accidentally ban your account for botting, but I haven't seen any conclusive evidence for this.
---
A solid percentage of people use Runelite, including most high level players. I think you're safe.
---
I hope it's a great time!
---
Not quite sure I believe you're maxed. Regardless, lower the angst a few notches, partner

You consider level 60 skills mid level? There’s no challenge within the quest either. Imo it’s on par with like monkey madness 1, obviously steeper reqs but the difference between 30 something and 60 is like nothing.
---
You guys might be joking but he did have pictures up of himself on Twitter occasionally
---
You'd be the richest player overnight if they added that bitching skill
---
Yeah, it was a popularity contest this year. In every category, the person with the most followers/subs won.
---
Kind of dumb if you ask me but I guess that's normal for Jagex.
---
Lmao do yanks and britfags ever heard of a shower?
---
Yikes yep you're showing your lack of knowledge. There are hundreds. In fact when Aus worlds came around they recruited 100 more, and only ~3 of them got reverted.
---
Showing your bias tho. Authority bad mmkay.
---
Teleport tablet bots possibly
---
• he’s not sleeping with all the people asking him questions enough
---
He doesn't get paid enough. Whatever they pay him needs to be doubled and then tripled
---
Lmao! You need to fast for 2-3 days before an ordeal like that.
---
A shared bank would be lit though
---
Not only is he an overzealous dickhead, but he’s a dickhead about Runescape. RUNESCAPE! I bet he’s an insufferable person irl. He really comes off as a guy completely consumed by this game.
---
Yeah cool you got the lowest cb fire cape, but have you ever had a girlfriend?
---
Fuuck I'm at 45 farming and I'm getting scared
---
Most of the game's players are adults who played Runescape as a kid. There are certainly bad eggs, but the community is reasonably mature.
---
Find a supportive clan that welcomes new players. The official Forums has plenty.
---
Trying to make a point saying "Barrows gloves don't require def" when you require def to *get* barrows gloves is pretty fucking moot, to be fair.
---
Like yeah, Barrows gloves *don't* require defense to equip, but without defense they literally don't exist for your character. So what is your point?
---

I am currently a f2p player, who wants to escape to p2p. I have heard that you should have certain stats/quests done before entering, but many people have different opinion on the amount. So before I am telegrabbing zami vines for quite some time i just wanted to ask if my current stats are good enough:
---
-40 attack
---
-44 strength
---
-44 defense
---
-28 ranged
---
-17 prayer
---
-39 magic
---
-1 rune crafting
---
-42 health
---
-31 crafting
---
-36 mining
---
-36 smithing
---
-34 fishing
---
-36 cooking
---
-50 firemaking
---
-46 woodcutting
---
Yo Chad link us a selfie right now
---
At least keep the mechanic and not buff their defence and HP. At least it would be bearable.
---
No way it took him anywhere near 100 hours. Not unless he was learning as he was making it.
---
I am tired of this "It's BIS" bullshit.  It is best in slot in numbers only.  It offers nothing the other better helms do and in some cases doesn't offer a max hit for the trade off.  This item was always going to have minimal uses and drop like a rock post release.  Artificially extending the price curve while taking content away from mid levels is ridiculous.  It should be relegated to a higher risk melee pvp helm and a welfare bossing helm taking over the role from its direct predecessor , that costs 500k.
---
Well, I was mostly responding to them claiming barrows gloves requires 60 def. Which they don't, even taking into account quest requirements.  
---
Just thought I'd mention that they *technically* don't require def at all.
---
Not swamp mans ass though.
---
That would be pretty cool they could make a guild/clan bank that'd allow people to do group Ironman on mains.
---
You shouldn’t be able to afk a new bis item. That’s the entire thing. It’s not even about an afk money maker. If they were 1m-1.5mhr from regular drops I’d literally care less. I mean realistically I don’t give a fuck either way. I won’t be doing the content anyways, I just don’t agree with the change, it feels out of place to osrs’ design for obtaining bis items.
---
Someone wanna be a gangster and loan me bad ass gear so I can finally beat this fucker? I'm 6 attempts in and I'm a noob
---
The rare combo of impressive RuneScaper and handsome.
---
The 60 def part is wrong, for sure. But you do have to have at least 41 def to have barrows gloves. So it still, for all intents and purposes, requires defense.
---
Imagine caring that much about a little statue and throwing a significant portion of your rep down the drain in a hissy fit on twitter. Take the L, keep making money off your successful videos.

---
Vocal minority.

Sure, I was just being snarky with my  original comment.
---
That's why they'll be valuable for longer this way
---
well hes definitely not getting paid enough and i think thats on him personally.
---
where was this streamed? i see no vod on the osrs channel
---
Yes
---
Where the the is the stream I can't find it
---
&gt; You said maxed players.
---
? never said that. Its pretty much 2m/hr for end game players, and even if its not efficient there are tons of high-end players doing inefficient things.
---
Even if 0 high-end players want to kill it, it would surely still be 1m/hr even if you could only kill 30 per hour, which you can even with shit stats and gear. 
---
I think a lot of people wished they just had something fun mechanics about them sort of like demonics, but that takes time so it was easier for them to hotfix it. It couldn't stay the way it was atleast.
---
Stats bro what's your stats bro I don't know how to have an argument bro please just give me your stats bro

More info on leauges!

Whats the best way to start getting into raids?  Currently maxed melee, 95 range, 86 mage, 75 prayer. Watched a couple guides but it just seems like a lot, highest level of PVE content I've done outside of slayer is Fight Caves. Just don't want to be a burden to my team going in
---
Make it equal strength bonus to serp. And go back to the old version and rates. This makes it desirable, but not BIS.
---
Making planks through butlers
---
The explorer's ring has a +1 prayer bonus. It can also restore 50% of your run energy twice per day.
---
You need to complete the easy Lumbridge and Falador diary to get it, but that should take under an hour if you're being efficient. Once you do you can get as many rings as you want for free.
---
If this is real, its fucked up. but it sounds so unbelievably fake that 2 guys would just be following one guy who's just hated for being an asshole on twitter... serious doubt here.
---
If its real, that sucks though. Violence solves nothing and proves you're less of a person.

---
Even from the greediest possible standpoint, leaving things as is gives the most income over time. Adding mtx to osrs immediately destroys their income, so it's a really stupid move. That said people are often greedy and stupid.
---
Sounds horrible.
---
guess I'm in the minority here, but I actually don't mind a BIS helmet being relatively attainable. I can see why people don't like that, but most other BIS items are locked behind high level bosses, master quests, long minigame grinds, or a combination of a couple of them with things with additions like ferocious gloves.
---
I can see why this makes people assume that all BIS gear should be expensive or hard to get, but I just think why not? BIS setups are hard to get, so what's wrong with having just one or two BIS items be a little more attainable? The Neit helm back in the day was BIS and incredibly cheap and easy to get, the amulet of strength is still joint-best amulet for strength bonus, and Ava's Accumulator used to be BIS for ranged and was pretty easy too.
---
BIS setups are expensive and take a while to get. I don't see why one or two of those items being easy to get is a massive problem, because it was the case back in 2007 too.
---
73 btw
---
They wanted to give him an award but everyone knows settled is getting the big prize.
---
I'd disagree personally. I can't stand Swampletics but I love UIM Karamja.
---
E: I mean SWAMP MAN GOOD RIGHT REDDIT??
---
I wish Rendi would have won that category, but damn. No need to shit all over someone else's win. This is a good way to make sure you never win an award. The community will absolutely remember his little tantrum when it comes time to vote next year.
---
I thought by release was a lame concept; just watch J1mmy do quests? Any Ironman content is just that tbh. And I’m still unconvinced it’s good content, but I am convinced J1mmy makes it good content. He is very entertaining and I enjoy his content a lot. Well deserved award.
---

Using VPN, yes. Changed IP, no.

If it helps it helps

thanks a million lmao

Yolo a solo raid, my first ever raid was a solo one took over 4 hours and died so many times that it didnt matter for loot but I learned allot, my second raid was also solo and the time went down to a hour and a half and a single death at olm.
---
Best way to learn something is being able to experience it yourself.
---
Technically it's a new session if you log out
---
Remove all negative attack bonus and let it carry reduced range damage from the trolls.
---
Or...... ya know... TRICK or treat..
---
not our problem

We just had two big news posts, and this thread is also stickied. Reddit only lets subreddits sticky two posts at a time.

Runefest should probably take priority, but I'm not a moderator.

Complete list of people who are surprised:
---
Sick nerd just complains the whole stream
---
Good thing no one asked your opinion. What the fuck are you even saying? Having 15/23 skills and legit requirements for 270+ QP as opposed to 42 QP, L O L. I forgot that Inferno, ToB, CoX, a single Jad, MM2, DS2, or even hybriding is easy scape opposed to simply gaining experience.
---
Thank God you can log out in the middle of the caves now
---
Ive never even heard of rendi. Ill have to check him out
---
In my head: everyone is handsomer than me.
---
In reality: &gt;!everyone is handsomer than me!&lt;.
---
I like him. Genuine guy. Hope life treats his right
---
Word, I'll give it a shot this weekend then just to see how it turns out
---
WDR min stats is 90 mage/range but you could get away with 86 for a couple mentor raids, just long term you won't want to be raiding with 86 as it is way way worse dps than 99 or even 95
---
join their discord, minimum gear costs about 50m and you need barrows gloves/fire cape/ma2 cape/salve ei, only weird items you would need that you might not have are dpick and bgs basically
---
Salve army, leaf bladed anything, Craws, etc. are all niche use items. A slayer helm has way more use cases than all of them combined (and is arguably the most used helmet in the game). Given the prevalence of slayerscape, I think it deserves to at least be mentioned, even if you exclude it from "true" BIS gear.
---
Sparcy has more fans, it's a fan vote this year.
---
Can’t believe you guys have just been pooping I’ve been holding it for years
---
They told me they forgot to make one
---
I'll try it! Seems like a good place to start, thanks man
---
Alright brainlet, have fun with that mentality. It's not unreasonable to think you have a good chance of getting the pet by 100m xp since most people will get it by 99 or close to it. 200m is a completely different story.
---
I remember it was during halo 3s early days. Bungie were offering a chance to win recon armor for signing up for the twitter open beta.

This comment literally had me laugh so hard I jumped out of my seat 😂. If I could afford gold (#Yang2020)  you would deserve it sir
---
Str bonus &gt; literally everything else in this game

You're not using Rigour. The Range prayers, especially Rigour, are a bigger boost to DPS than any gear you can use.

Go home Sephiroth you're drunk.

The first video I ever watched by him was a Master Yi (league of legends) video, and In it he had a clip of a black guy dancing. I always thought he was the one in the clip.

I'm not sure where everyone else got the idea

Ah I see
---
Damn you mean you actually need to pay attention when killing an NPC that drops a bis item?
---
🤮 this man

His music is pretty fire too. That jungle potion song is the best.

Didn't even know that was popular in the UK.

This will take her around the game and allow her enjoy arguably the most normie part about RS, quests. While insidiously implanting in her subconscious the infallible, inexorable need to continuously watch arbitrary statistics on a java-based browser medieval fantasy point and click game go up, and up... Until her soul is claimed in the ever-more and impenetrable regions of the deepest darkest pits of hell where there is no escape.
---
glhf :)
---
oh yeah i have heard that, but i also have heard that you need 50 ranged or magic to farm them effectively. I dont know if it would be worth to train it, since i can get a good amount of money until i get to that point
---
Sorry can't hear you over my higher stats
---
The people who spent 50m on it on day of release can afford to lose that money too. It still sucks for them, and ideally no one would get fucked over, but in the grand scheme of things they'll be able to recover.

Daily reminder that Rendi was an infernal cape seller before his recent success on youtube
---
Ahh fuck forgot BP being 2h. Shield slot was in my head since i was initially considering rune cbow. 
---
Do you know any good videos of people doing jad with sub 50 pray?
---
Quite a big difference between having your video revolve around Swampletics and tagging his name is the tags, is it not?
---
Besides, any big youtuber has done this before and it's not something Rendi is hiding on purpose and doesn't want you to see, else he wouldn't put #KempQ. So yes I would call this banter, with a bit of clever marketing.
---
What made u come back?
---
Damn and here I was going to mention 3rd party clients and MTX, guess I'll just leave.
---
I've been trying to say this for ages. the pmod system is outdated and is just a rare cosmetic these days (the crown).
---
I’m slowly saving up for it but my whole bank is about the cost of Rigour. Aiming to finish DS2 this weekend and learn Vorkath so I can expedite that process.
---
Edit: Also, I usually use protect from melee to extend my HP. Should I be using eagle eye until I get rigour?
---
99 is the highest
---
I zoomed in looking for like mod ash or something then I noticed that god like jawline andrew gower has.
---
Thanks! But I meant more in depth of numbers.
---
For example:
---
Lvl 1 ranged has 10% accuracy and max hit of 5.
---
Lvl 2 ranged had 11% accuracy and max hit of 6.
---
Lvl 70 - 60% - max 25
---
Lvl 71 - 65% - max 30
---
If that's the case, I can bust out 90 mage. Not a big deal at all. I already have all of those in my bank too outside of the bgs, but I can buy one if needed.
---
Your rates sound about right.
---
You have the annoying bosses turned off - which also give a lot more points.
---
dude ogre shamans are harder than all of that you clearly havent killed one
---
Yes, whatever damage boosting Prayer you use will be a huge boost to your XP/hr, the same applies to Melee and Piety.
---
With equal strength bonuses, this would still effectively "kill" serp as much as it would with a +1 strength bonus. It won't change your max hit, but the serp costs 140k/hour to use and the face guard is free. There are almost no scenarios where the serp's defense would be worth the cost of use.
---
Chances are good the if black dhide drops you’ll find out it’s a prince.
---
Ive never even heard of the guy
---
Dude c'mon.. you can criticize the length of the video but you cannot say it's shitty. Lilsmokey's editing blows Rendi's out the water.
---
I was going to say pretty much the same thing. Genuine community interaction goes a long way, and btw he's not an ironman. I'm sure there are many viewers getting tired of them.
---
Reaching into /r/iamverysmart territory there you're so tilted.
---
A lot of people have paid for services for their irons, from their mains. It's not really enforceable - and honestly considering it's only bolstering an ironman account not really a problem (Unless for ranks, i suppose).
---
It comes down to what you want to do and how you want to go about it.
---
Ranged 40 is best, but yeah at first it'll be a little slower, but with them you get to train your ranged and hp. 
---
With magic you only need 35 for fire bolt
---
as your levels go up the more effective they become
---
With tele grab wines you're getting very small amount of mage xp, but the money is undeniable.  
---
Ogresses are great to train while getting money at the same time
---
&gt; rendi put so much effort into his video
---
his editing sucks. yeah the content is impressive, but 90% of his videos involved tick eating purple sweets, with a clipped CHESTBRAH sound clip thrown in. guy needs to spend some of his sellout money on a new mic as well
---
I dont even play osrs anymore, but always watch his videos when they drop. Honestly such a great series
---
You are the dumbest cunt
---
Oooooo I'm telling
---
 
---
*MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM*
---
Almost certain Settled even commented on the video at the time saying he approved of the tags?
---
Yeah it comes off as really entitled. Ive never even heard of rendi or heard anyone talk about him, and ive been playing osrs for 2 years now. He needs a lesson in good sportsmanship.
---
You don’t think he baited out that salty reply from rendi? His first comment wasn’t putting anyone down.
---
I love you too x
---
He cute
---
While true, if you're creating *new content* it shouldn't be dead on release. New slayer tasks should be competitive either with GP/hour or exp/hour.
---
I would honestly say to change out the rangers for d'hide boots, you lose +1 range attack but the blessed boots have a +1 prayer bonus to make up for it. Then you can use that money for prayer
---
No comments from Settled on the video
---
Swamp man letting it get to his head, seems a little arrogant here
---
Genuinely curious, is Sick Nerd terminally ill? Would make the IGN check out and he looks like he needs to go see a vet.
---
...how?
---
What
---
His voice and his magnificent beard do not go together in most people's expectations
---
Yeah not now, I just looked. When it was released I'm sure he did.
---
It seemed like very mild banter but then Rendi escalated it to some real shit
---
I hope he does. Just not enough for me to spend $65.
---
It's saying that the silent majority was happy with the content on release, and didn't complain about it, which is why the vocal minority was able to convince Jagex to change the content.
---
Now that the content has been fucked up for the actual majority of players, we're hearing their voices.
---
Why tf am I getting poked from every angle?? Who gives a toss?
---
Yes, but the original post asking for clips was for RS3 and Swamp man.

MM &gt; 60 atk &gt; 50-70 str with d scim &gt; 55 def while you get your defenders
---
Its understandably frustrating for him, this just isn't the way to vent.
---
The games didn't load half the time but it was a fantastic idea, although I should have won the ski one for blue
---
I literally never understood this, he doesn't sound black, like at all.
---
Someone else said:
---
&gt;He sounds like a fat, white, new yorker. COME AHHHN
---
That's on point.
---
why Sydney crosby lol
---
While I personally wanted Sick Nerd to win, Sparc is just as good of a content creator/streamer, contrary to the large amount of unnecessary hate that he gets. Actually happy that he got some recognition, since he seems to be a lone wolf within the streaming community.
---
HAHAHA I eat ass i'm so funny HAHAHAHA
---
Guess it was the supposed Sparcmac winning?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I can't blame people for booing, compared to Sick Nerd or Faux Sparcmac is incredibly dull imo he has been doing the same thing for like half a decade now I feel.
---
I mean settled also lost the same category so i feel like he has the right to say something about it.
---
bruh the whole company is a joke
---
## bruh 🔥🔥🤣💀💯
---
Slayer can be good GP/h on particular tasks (but still nothing compared to the actual best money makers), but over all it is not. Also, to get optimal exp you need to directly sacrifice your GP/h.
---
I'm not saying new tasks need to have both, or that new tasks need to be better than what's out there right now, just that they need to be in line with current tasks so that they're worth doing on release. Otherwise it's literally a complete waste of dev time.
---
Awful to see someone getting booed for winning a golden gnome.
---
I figured that was from 19 to 23 or something. I knew he was young but...
---
Bro I’m literally not saying anything about skill — at least not in the terms of skill playing RuneScape. You’re filling that in for whatever weird reason you’ve got.
---
this is like osrs ASMR video oh gawd
---
calm your fucking titties, you really think Jagex isn't going to tweak them anymore?
---
Pepega
---
If I had to guess you’re doing what I’m doing post 99 and that’s no more tree runs. I got my pet off calquats but I haven’t done a single tree outside of a farming contract. Gl my dude
---
He won because most runescapers can reate to him, they are small musle boys. How about eating you litte shats
---
for anything above like 30k seed price it's worth resurrecting
---
Still, booing is silly especially as it's a night of celebrations
---
Did not mean it negatively that’s just what it is but ok.
---
When are the Reveals?
---
Yeah, not everyone could win despite wanting them all to
---
I choose obviously not because OBVIOUSLY you don’t understand what the word content means because it’s NOT about skill playing the game.
---
Chilling with some friends at a get together
---
So fake. Apple watches don't support wrist bands of such high quality
---
I've never understood the mindset of "I put a lot of time that I didn't have to into something, so that makes what I've done more valuable."  You don't deserve an award just because you've done something tedious.
---
Of course, that's that same reason Settled's videos are starting to wear on me, so I don't think either of them deserves to talk.  Swampletics was more interesting early on, when you got to see region-specific content used in creative ways.  When it turned into "the only way for me to achieve this thing is to spend hundreds of hours on repetitive tasks and pay people to help," it's no longer a wondrous accomplishment, but an addiction.
---
entertaining chain of events.
---
Lol
---
It truly is.

If they remove effigies I am all for this update, until they are removed no.
---
Posting on social media with high emotions is never a good idea. I can sympathize, but this level of entitlement is unbecoming. :(
---
There's really no recommendation. It'd honestly be great to start at p2p with all level 1s because it's faster to train as a member

Wubwubwubwubwubwub

No kidding.

I’m saying that ‘silent majority’ has been loud as fuck.

---
I love the area, I love the premise, I feel like there’s just so much potential there that was wasted on a relatively short fetch quest. I would love to see an expansion into the nomadic fremmy tribe in the mountains. 
---
It’s one of the most pretty areas in the game with a great song that comes with it. But it’s effective just flyover content for pures to get a bearhead.
---
i... don’t know what people see in their content... it’s just a rip off of old popular content, and of the few videos i suffered through, they were all the same video in a new area lol
---
My hero
---
Rendi &gt; Settled unironically
---
Thing is, dude knew me when I had like 500m (not a huge stack but pretty decent) but yeh. That’s what I get for branching out of my super casual stoners CC I guess. Fucking cancerous community this is. I’ve only played maybe 5-6hours Since that’s happened. I used to be a 2-4 a day guy. More of work was slow. Oh well. I’m sure I’ll be a much more productive person now I don’t give two shits about this game. Mostly just on this shit reddit to watch all the “reeeee” as jagex continues to fuck up their updates.
---
love that   
---
i've been called discount orlando bloom a few times :P
---
That doesn't look like morytania !
---
Length of video does not directly correlate to how much effort was put into creating it. What a sore loser.
---
Out of curiosity what has Xzact done?
---
*cough* there's other ways to watch *cough*
---
Well it certainly shouldn't be how most people use it, and I'm not even sure if that's true to be honest, was there a survey on this or what? It's pretty much everything that's wrong with this website that you can just downvote and hide someone's opinion just because you don't agree with it.
---
I wonder how Fart Tart 55 is doing
---
Yeah exactly. The chestbrah thing is way over done at this point and his videos really aren’t even that interesting to me. Gratz, you can grind out and tick eat for extended periods of time people aren’t willing to do themselves. Not like others can’t do the shit he does if they put in the time.
---
This is exactly what I'm wodering looking at the schedule here and on the RS website
---
I mean skilling multiple skills to 99, completing GWD and Raids 2 and going for Raids 1 completion, maxing an account, doing new quests on stream, etc.   Literally just the skilling is more diverse than almost the entirety of SParcmacs content.  Gambling, mass wildy stuff, giveaways, and watching YT vids is his entire content.
---
if he had even decent commentary i might watch him but holy shit his vids of him doing insane stuff at low levels are somehow waaaay more boring than settled jumping a broken bridge for 10 minutes.
---
Rendi is just astounding in terms of game knowledge and dedication. His videos are out of this world and have such a wide range of material.
---
A bitch, and because he’s a bitch

I do not like Dunkey because he is black.

Opinions by definition cant be wrong so go ahead and jot that down. I dont care where they got it from, in my opinion theyre better so you can have as big a meltdown as you want but youre not going to change my mind. 
---
Also thanks for the downvotes for stating my opinion, classy as always 2007scape.
---
Bro they are playing the game. Just because they're doing it in a way you don't like doesn't change that fact.
---
It's like the typical scrub going "damn these fighting game pros suck, they just play the best characters and use the same combos every game." or "wow these FPS players aren't rushing like a retard 24/7 they're so bad"

---
i mean uim doesn't require you to use niche game mechanics to play the gamemode, just different training methods sometimes, so no, not really the same. not putting down settled's game knowledge, because he's definitely an extremely good and knowledgable player, but the content he makes is definitely more noob-friendly than watching Rendi talk about different safespots, tick eating methods, and interface stalls that he has to use to kill a monster at lvl 5 combat.
---
Subjective, so fair enough, but many people found that video entertaining
---
No homo tho but yes
---
It's locked behind a master quest
---
wow grats dude it took me almost 300 clues to get my first crozier
---
Hell even sparc mac isn't at 500k yet and he's been making vids for how long? And like him or not, he's probably one of the biggest names.
---
You make hours of grinding look so fun! Started watching months before I started playing again. You do great work :)
---
Well then you go enjoy that content. I was just explaining to you why they didn't win. Not like you could have expected them to win against the likes of Settled or Rendi.
---
I do like how you just whined about being down voted for an opinion, but you downvoted me though.
---
The category was best OSRS video and rendis video was about OSRS. Smokey's video was a great video and incredibly creative from an artistic point of view but it was about a community figure first and foremost kind of like an in-joke. Rendi's video had to be creative in a more technical way and do something with the game that was maybe never thought possible before. It comes down to taste but man rendi put out a sweet video.
---
TBF it's runescape. It 100% relies on the content creator to make it interesting. Because the game is insanely boring to watch otherwise.
---
I guess this means c h e s t b r a h won’t be doing a face reveal.
---
As ironman with recent 99 herb i can comfirm it’s still buggy.
---
lmao me too, he went with the "I'm an ironman btw" angle haha
---
Honestly the whole ceremony was pretty meh, but seeing him get so choked up over winning was heartwarming. Especially after 3 people clapped for the awesome violin trio
---
what a bummer. the whole situation is awkward. i love rendi. he makes great videos and is really awesome at the game. it’s a shame he felt like he needed to say this. he should let the content speak for itself. he’s clearly doing something right even if he didn’t win the gnome—the nomination’s not for nothing
---
F
---
I am sorry. Hey all. I was extremely intoxicated while having a bad one already and realized the response to settled was dumb. Deleted it 5 minutes after, and it is not how I really feel. But obviously that is no excuse. I congratulated smokey hours before this tweet but I will again, he really does deserve it. Congrats smokey! His edits are A++. Originally the tweet was basically me trying to realize what I need to improve on next year because I see it as a hopeless task. Reason being I put my entire heart and soul into something and it wasn't enough. Doesn't mean the other guy didn't deserve it at all! Have a good one all and please don't be too upset with me. Love you all
---
U \*\*\*\* my balls
---
Their time is 5 hours ahead of US eastern time I’m pretty sure, 8 hours ahead of US pacific. Hope that helps
---
Alchs it
---
Honestly I think its because his content is just too savage for Jagex to put it in the spotlight.
---
It kinda looks like a SARK005 with a blue dial, tbh I'm colorblind and the picture is too small, I have no idea what that is... Maybe /r/watches would know, some people there are insane

Restart the account creation process from the beginning. If the issue persists, try going incognito or using a different machine.
---
Cave horrors are actually a great point to bring up. They drop BiS helm for slayer, have a shit loot table, are easy to kill (hell, you can almost afk them), and they have an even lower requirement than knights. Why isn’t everyone whining about how cave horrors are too easy and how we need to buff their stats &amp; abilities?
---
Yea, 100%. I imagined him being around 25 and looking like more of a man than a boy. 
---
Hopefully this doesn’t ruin his commentary for me, because it’s A1.
---
War Bobby Knuckles
---
I used to think GradeAUnderA looked like a more drunk and unstable Casey Neistat.
---
And Settled has put just as much, if not more, time into some episodes of Swampletics
---
You should be able to find it if you search "prayer" in the plugin section.  
---
If not reply and I can check when I'm on pc.
---
Or just take a shit before you start.
---
I'm extremely hazy on the details since it's been well... About 15 years, but it was a reference to it being a mimic hence why it gives rotten food. A reference to d&amp;d or that British TV show with all the old dudes making wild jokes about pelicans flying. I was about 8 at the time but my friend showed me it and we laughed at it, but I can't remember how to do it and I remember finding out it was removed/broke in rs2. But I remember it was about trying to feed it some item or searching it while some items where in your invent.

I want the shiny Rayquaza from Dragon Slayer II

He reminds me of tehnoobshow for whatever reason
---
i think it was a combination of video being swamp man related content and also being graphically impressive that most of the lower level players on reddit could understand and enjoy it. 
---
Compared to rendis vids which requires to have a little knowledge about the game to appreciate, which is fair i guess. But i personally dont agree that best video should go to someone just because it catered to the lowest common denominator.
---
oh boy are you in for a treat, youve got a lot of content ahead of you
---
swampletics is settled's morytania locked ultimate ironman. combining the normal restrictions of UIM (no bank, no trading) with only being able to use content in morytania

Thats rs2. Rs3 does look amazing though. The combat is quite engaging and fun and i would say far from awful.
---
what did you use for the zammy image?
---
why would you be sorry? they're your videos, do what makes you happy. obviously a lot of people enjoy them, who cares what I think?
---
Tough to complete ToB at CoX. Wonder how he did it.

Oh nice. Thank you!

Except he's not white either? What?

You're the best! Never stop

Please change this to sort by new instead of old by default, It makes no sense to have to scroll past a ton of old, already answered questions to help out new comments
---
Good work
---
Lmao you're so desperate for attention and affirmation it's pathetic
---
Comparatively these bots aren't as bad as others in game
---
&gt; Who is better is rather subjective though..
---
if you dont agree with the general subject of this comment chain then why even answer to begin with lol
---
He is gonna slay so much puss this weekend.
---
Went on google images and grabbed a simple Zammy symbol. Took it into photoshop to touch it up, adjust color and make sure it was the proper pixel dimensions for my cpu cooler.
---
What is he saying?
---
It's more unique to him as a streamer. Also pvp definitely has an element of being unpredictable compared to anything else
---
oh he definitely did. There are videos of him with 10+ blues in RS2
---
AHAHAHAH REDDIT AND HELMIES BTFO
---
never believe rng
---
Holy shit Randy Jackson was there in a purple party hat.
---
Tucker and Dale vs Evil. A man of culture I see. My father-in-law absolutely loved that movie when we made him watch it. So many good laughs!
---
Whats the CPU Cooler model?
---
wait yall telling me jagex throws an event where the big wigs all jerk each other off? what the fuck?
---
Gentlemen we got him
---
!remindme 1000 years
---
80 fishing?
---
You mean like trying to slip in partnerships which delays content for those who don't buy into it? Cosmetic changes to POH to show off these things early which would entice others to get the next partnership to show it off?
---
They failed that one, they won't stop at that. Just like how they forced your hand to get Bonds by holding F2P hostage. It will be a slow death by 1000 cuts.
---
Make a girl acc and sell yourself for 10k to a bunch of basement dwellers.
---
Amen. Zulrah is my favorite aswell and i might add another reason to what you allready said. Zulrah has 3 untradeables that are cool unlike most other bosses who only got pet
---
Swamp man good
---
Yeah that seems right. I used msb(i) with rune arrows and elite void, at 91 ranged I was getting maybe the same rates.
---
I thought I was alone thank you
---
Gratz J1mmy. His vids helped me get back into Rs. Good to see him win a gnome.
---
It’s an ROG Ryuo 240. In another comment on here I listed all the hardware and software I used 😜👍
---
Yes that is correct.
---
ill bet you 385 million mind runes i dont
---
With a quickness.
---
Do you have a swamp man shrine in your closet?
---
Between Void and Slayer Helm...How many will actually put this faceguard on?
---
&gt;i personally don’t consider myself to be bad at the game, but I also admit I’d never be able to do half of what Rendi has done because I just don’t get the game mechanics enough, and also can’t do actions tick perfect for hours.
---
Thats what I'm pointing out though, you don't have to be able to do those things or have put thousands of hours into the game to appreciate what goes into his videos
---
Impetuous impulses will have some people in it if they make these though
---
I had my account locked after buying membership. Never used a vpn either
---
Technically no, it’s not legal. Jagex has never said that 1:1 is allowed, that’s just some sort of rule that people thought of lol. But I’m sure hundreds still use AHK without punishment. Just use at your own risk.
---
I know well enough the infinite growth of business that you speak of being a death spiral, its likely inevitable and will mark the end of osrs. I don't think that day should come for another ten years, but it may be tomorrow.
---
Crazy, that sounded creepy and gay
---
Swamp man good, op bad
---
Source? Last i heard the necessary engine work for clans wasn’t even done and that would be the functionality group ironman would be implemented on as well.
---
That's what PKing is in general. Just griefing.
---
i love how everyone in this thread is pretending they wouldnt act the same way. like imagine getting upstaged by a minute long meme video that only won because it was about some content creator that everyone circle jerks about, i can totally understand why hes fucked up over this
---
mouse movement is a no no
---
Or just menaphos
---
He ain't no pussy
---
But it helps a lot to understand it. Like watching Hell’s Kitchen (best show so I gotta shout it out) it seems so easy for them to not fuck up the food during dinner service, but if you had Gordon Ramsay screaming at you, you’d also understand.
---
Now instead of them fucking up food, it’s tick eats and Gordon Ramsay is Corp. I realize this is a shitty analogy but I’m tired as fuck so yeah lol.
---
I stand by my comment
---
Oh shut up
---
Love your videos, please keep up the good work! 2 nominations are great, so you shouldn't look at this as a failure if you didn't win an award this time. It shouldn't be a black-white view like that, and imo showcasing your insane game skills together with your deep game knowledge on a technical level has made some of the most impressive RS achievements and videos I've ever seen.
---
I love you both
---
Alt prayers might be cool, but OSRS is severely lacking in combat depth compared to RS3 and many other games, so I'm not entirely sure what new niches we can have, especially if we're not just reusing what RS2 had.
---
Happy to be proven wrong, though.
---
Fake
---
Actually a decent idea. Gets to point across for those in the know, and those who don't know are none the wiser about what's happening.
---
I am no tree, I am an ent!
---
He should’ve won, his videos are amazing, have actual new content for osrs, and show insane skill.
---
I was on my hc so I had friends with me to protect me so I didint actually have to do anything about the solos as they always ran away. "Luckily" for me I ran into the team while hunting for the next boss and was able to insta log.
---
From the numbers they published apparently not. They break it down by subscription and MTX, when the math is done the MTX seems to exclusively come from RS3 and it seems bonds are included in OSRS's total amount.
---
Yeah agreed. I hate sparc macs stream personality so i cant watch him but his pk events and masses are reallly good for the community and breathe life into the game.
---
Thank you!!! I just broke 1500 and I’m on my enthmost attempt of getting the fire cape (died on Jad twice now). Anyway, I though I know the game well... hah!
---
Prestige. The same way people remake hardcore ironmans.
---
Yeah, you’re right, i didn’t watch the video. Judging from everybody else’s comments, it sounded like he did. But i did just watch the ending right now because of your comment, and while he’s not really shitting on him, it is kind of in bad taste to mock him, and then point out how salty kempQ was for what he did. It feels like that part wasn’t necessary, which i can see why people wouldn’t like that too much
---
Who?
---
1650 kc told myself no more konar
---
Not really. Just because you reach a level doesn’t mean you deserve the pet, lmao. And in this particular case, the guy is beyond unlucky. He’s probably the only player with 200m without the pet. 
---
Just because some people are going to get unlucky with this system, doesn’t mean you should change the system and render the idea of pets meaningless. And that’s exactly what would happen if they added any kind of inherent acceleration in pet drop rate.
---
This is the Problem with their statements. They don’t say what is legal and what is not. So you know who takes the chance? Cheaters do. The rest of us are in the dark about the rules.
---
/r/NotKenM
---
Love the vids man. Yeah what you did was stupid and you'll get memed to death for it but keep up the content.

Or take a break, whatever's best for you

Back in 2010 they definitely would have, back when u made shit for content creation. Sparcs osrs bank was worth like 70 grand but he didnt sell because streaming is well enough money. Same for faux and any of em.

I don't think this was the right move, but putting anything BiS on a 60 slayer drop table was never a good idea
---
kids watching his staking and giveaway streams
---
🤮
---
Honestly, if you're really into the game the member pays for itself. OSRS has a shit ton of content for members and I have been a mem for about 5 months now (started OSRS in Feb on my main) and I haven't even hit 50% of it going at my own pace and enjoying the game.
---
I'm going to hit Barrows Gloves here in the next couple weeks for the first time ever, pretty stoked about that accomplishment.
---
Rendi, it wasn't enough to win some popularity contest award, but it was enough to drop mine and thousands of other jaws every video with what you do. Please don't stop making content, it is being recognized and I'm sure you'll win a Gnome down the line.
---
We are talking about a most likely overweight gamer. I guarantee he was boofin hot pockets and slamming gravy during the tournament (or whatever you would call it). He probably shits 3x a day
---
It wasn't shitting on Kemp lmao
---
I said "better pick" and you came back with "more popular" as a rebuttal so you're definitely conflating the two
---
PvP is definitely unpredictable, but it can still be very repetitive.  Either camp hotspots, go to revs en masse, or just do a setup PK.   I dont see Sparcmac doing what Torvesta or any other actual PvP content creator does.  
---
There is also now LMS which can be fun for a bit and offers "PvP" for HCIM like Sick Nerd as well.
---
now thats fucking unlucky lol
---
Because the jmods own these bots
---
My heart stopped for a second thx
---
&lt;3
---
All good bro, sometimes your emotions can take over at times.  Especially when it's something you care so much about, gl next year
---
I'm sure if you asked him he'd agree that he was shitting on Kemp and I'm sure he had his reasons for it but it definitely is in poor taste and it's unneeded. He can make a good funny video without that segment and the only thing it served to do was make fun of a youtuber he barely knew.
---
Ima sleep for now but I'll reply in the morning if you say anything else^^
---
Except for Phoenix because it’s technically a boss pet (I’m sure you knew, but in case anyone else didn’t know)

---
Easily digestible content like memes and art get more upvotes. It isn't surprising that a 2 minute video with great editing would get more votes than a very long and technical video, even though Rendi put more work into his video.
---
Not now that it's 100% useless, dead content, worthless slag of an item because of the almighty basilisk fang.
---
Welcome to the world of Jeremy.
---
From my experience, I wouldn't expect a leech, but they didn't have a problem with me tagging along and learning as I went, even knowing I was only gonna stick around for 1 kc. Not sure if they'd make an exception if your gear or levels aren't up to standard, but it wouldn't hurt to ask.
---
Got mine at 74 farming. Rng is a biatch
---
Rendi's videos are garbage. I can't pay attention to them. I think what he does is insane and is pushing this game to its limit. But he has no charisma, isn't funny, and just explains his strategies in a monotone voice at rapid speed. It sounds like he's bored, which makes me feel bored.
---
Bro I'm using like 6m of gear and having trouble

---
Jamflex is too rigged and will never allow savage prophecy to spread on their stage. Only the shapeshifting lizzard swamp Billy boy and other simmilar clowns are allowed to win this competition. Hahahahahahahahahaha wow.
---
The idea is that for every level a regular account had in defence, your account has it in strength / attack. So a 60 combat account could be 60/60/1 instead of 40/40/40. Runescape pvp, especially at lower combat, favours bursty dps, because you're able to heal the same amount at any combat level because food doesn't have any requirements on it. An account that can only use rune weapons would get destroyed by a dragon dagger or g maul, because even though their defence is better, they don't have the damage to land a kill.
---
For someone who spends as much time as he does playing osrs I'm actually happy to see he seems healthy

For a zerker this is base 75. Just like it’s for a skiller base 75 when he still has all combats 1. Or when a F2P only has all 75s, you wouldn’t keep calling it “base 1”. 
---
Why are so many of you salty or even butthurt over me calling the account base 75. It’s not like getting 75 defence is a hard part of base 75 and thus devaluing the achievement.
---
Don't listen to people shitting on you. Everyone makes dumb comments sometimes, you'll be fine. You make quality content and the community has your back. It wasn't the craziest outburst we've seen and you've apogized for it pretty quickly. Just enjoy the rest of runefest and come back better than ever!
---
To troll people who aren't paying attention ;-;
---
I wouldn't worry about it it too much man any publicity is good publicity. I honestly haven't heard of your content till this post and am now watching your series. Chin up
---
Best way to get jagex help is on Twitter I had a similar issue and messaged them on Twitter and they fixed it without even replying to me lol
---
Framed and jimmy were about what I expected but I imagined settled to look like Fred from those 2008 YouTube videos
---
Honestly I'm not a big sparc mac fan, but he has undoubtedly done a ton to help the game and the community over the many years he has been making content
---
Ah, I misinterpreted what you meant.
---
This was literally on the schedule how are you surprised?
---
To be fair no rs youtuber ever held a candle to simon and James
---
it was #3 in trending the day it was posted.
---
goddamn was it wholesome.
---
You mean cringy
---
Did u plant trees aswell? And if u did, did u plant low level fruit or high level?
---
That's fucked up
---
Did he really "shit on KempQ" tho? Kemp made a video idea like 3 years ago to get the lowest firecape, spent like 5 episodes brainstorming then threw in the towel and went back to Ironman pking videos and RWT'ing for an excuse to make the "content" that was "playing runescape properly" smh. Rendi, being the record holder for lowest combat firecape decided he would take up the challenge to best his own record and then did it. He then did the equivalent of a WWE fighter bragging after a win. He didnt harass or bully Kemp like Kemp's 11 year old fan base seems to tell themselves. He was flexing an achievement by making a joke. And before you accuse me of being a rendi superfan, the constant chestbrah soundclip drives me insane but I watch for the insane amounts of skill the guy has and for the willpower it would take to do the things he accomplishes. If your gonna dislike the guy at least get a better reason than "He bullied KempQ"
---
Wow look at you. So brave being against settled.
---
What a goddamn lad
---
Hard agree. Pointless and boring 20min quest.
---
Wow is this real? I voted for him and thought his video was great but this is pathetic behaviour.
---
Edit: looked it up on Twitter. Apparently people were poking fun at him and it got to him, he apologised for what he said which is good of him.
---
He is Evil Evan
---
There's no use. 90% of the sub probably doesn't even have a fire cape,  if all the posts about first time carriers are any indication. They probably didn't even watch rendi's video. It was miles better than swampletics exposed in just about every way
---
Gzz, I’m 580 zalcano kc no pet yet
---
46 i believe
---
I to, have a dog.
---
Wait are you that Bama guy from the Runehq forums way back when
---
I was 10 at the time and was staying at my grandma's place for a week and one day we went to visit my dad at work and he let me check  the rs homepage. I couldn't wait to get back home and try it out, good times :)
---
Do solo. Fix'd.
---
Mate got your caps lock stuck?
---
No, It really wouldn't, It's just another trend that people laugh at because others laugh too so they must all laugh together, For fear of being OOTL.
---
So it then becomes a thing, There was never a punchline.
---
Never heard of it tbh.
---
That’s not the most efficient in the slightest.
---
Thanks for this comment :). I personally think you should have won the gnome, I'm gutted that you didn't
---
Your skill and the time editing you put in really is insane and I'd have loved to see it win over a video that piggybacked off of the popularity of swamp man
---
I agree, just get a fucking mixer lmao
---
Hey mate, I've tried watching your videos a few times and always end up turning them off before getting even halfway through. 
---
Maybe I'm just a bit out of the loop and all but the Chestbrah recurring theme isn't funny and the voice with effects saying "fucking X" every time isn't really funny either. 
---
In addition, I find your videos lack flow, they take forever to get to the point, the pacing is slow and they jump around without explaining why very well. 
---
Lastly, time spent on a task isn't an indicator on how good something is. Something could take 5 minutes and be a better product than something that took hours.
---
Good luck with your video making for next year!
---
NMZ 75 attack 75 defense and basically NMZ 96 strength and level up your attack to 90ish finish 99 strength and attack then either chin defense or NMZ it.
---
Sparc is constantly rimming or being rimmed by jmods.
---
Boo
---
Bruh if you don't think every Ironman drops every extra beserker/barrows pieces/zulrah loot to a main for bonds
---
He's a fucking pleb, Who's only selling point is his ass eating skills.
---
Didn't deserve shit.
---
I do kinda miss the days of going onto the homepage and boom, new skill without having to go through the polling rigmarole.
---
It's supposed to be completely terrible. Nobody likes reading it, it's kinda like a Rickroll in that way.
---
you dont find pets, pets find you
---
You not lucky
---
Only Rendi video i saw was his low cb firecape. I barely finished the video becasue the terrible editing and the constent chest brah shit was annoying. The whole video felt like it was edited by a middle schooler, and was nothing but a big troll. Comparing settled and rendi's videos side by side, its obvious he wouldnt win.
---
I don't think that you understand what I'm implying.
---
Just started raiding around 10 days ago and I'm at 30kc, did it though the We Do Raids Discord, and that's really the best way to go unless you know someone in game already who can show you the ropes
---
En mass*
---
I was so happy that all my 3 favourites won, J1mmy, Lilsmokey and Settled, well deserved wins all three of them i'd say. And as others has pointed out already it is amusing to see how your expectations on how these people look gets completely shattered lol
---
No I'm sure its a reference to Fight Club, wherein the narrator says "A guy who came to Fight Club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood."- meaning, Mod Ash was leaner and more fit than Brad Pitt in the movie Fight Club. Ergo, Ash's ass was made of wood.
---
Lol what? Yes it is.
---
You’re netting the most xp for your account in the long run. By using Slayer you’re ensuring there’s no wasted xp. Imagine using NMZ to max your melees and then going 2x the xp for 99 because you were only 53 Slayer when you maxed your combat. It’s a bad look bud.
---
I would also recommend Barb fish for similar reasons, it’s called macro-efficiency, look it up.
---
Nope lol
---
Raids/slayer/gwd bossing 
---
Oh and the odd casino visit
---
I've watched maybe 4 full rendi vids, while I think they're impressive game wise, I actively dislike his editing and humour.
---
Most efficient in what sense. For the average player probably obby to dh nmz. You almost never melee slayer tasks. Defensive barraging slayer is 0 time though. Ehp for atk and str is Dinh’s and arclight at necks with spec transfer alts. Unless someone found a new way to do what cave horror did with chally.
---
Only if you call piggybacking of the most popular content a "story".
---
Keep it up! Just an infinity to go
---
Looking forward, maybe we can boss one day :)
---
Then I'm sure you're well informed.
---
Thanks! I had no idea they stocked emeralds too. I’ll get on that
---
Best defence is offence
---
as if jmods understand balance in this game. lmfao
---
everyone here is wrong, there are two really great methods that from what i can see nobody even considered
---
1) viggora's chainmace in wilderness (double damage)
---
2) spec restore dinhs bullwark special attacks (aoe)
---
Damn dude.
---
I got mine from a herb patch by Fally / Draynor
---
What kinda watch you rockin?
---
Realistically because he’s been active on YouTube for over 10 years now (since pre-eoc) so he has a huge following unlike the others. It was actually unfair to have him against the small guys, sparcmac is like a corporation in terms of osrs channel size
---
Kodak
---
My friend just typed in the chat that they were watching runefest chillling with a beer and got timed out
---
damn that looks cool
---
Hey man, it's rough but if you keep grinding at it you'll get there eventually. You've already got a more impressive content library than the vast majority of osrs content creators, and that's something you can be proud of whether or not you've got some random award for it
---
Are cars killing the wagon industry?
---
Golden Gnome. Completed :)
---
not intentional but good catch.
---
Lol idiot its because hes   the most veteran mod left on the osrs team tou fucking  neet.
---
I don't vape? Where did you get that from
---
What are you 14 and just came here from rs3?
---
Dailies and conventional skilling are not mutually exclusive; you can do one after the other with no penalty. The main advantage of dailies is that you save a lot of time over conventional training, time that you can use to do other stuff in the game, which can be conventional training again. The daily restriction is to prevent them to be too OP and devalue conventional training method.
---
More important is the fact that some of the dailies in RS3 are actually fun to do compared to their conventional skilling counterparts. Some of them cannot be afked and require a lot of skill and effort to do efficiently, kind of like a skilling boss. Cache and Sinkholes comes to mind for me.
---
Would've prefered Mammal or Faux, sick nerd is overrated.
---
Wow. He's kinda cute.
---
It's really doubtful we would have ever gotten new content with 2011scape. A big reason 2007scape got any updates at all in the first place was because it could be implemented with a super small team. Implementing updates in 2011scape would require a team similar to the team that currently works on RS3. 
---
This is also not to mention that people really did want 2006/7 rs over anything else at the time. EOC wasn't the only thing people disliked about rs in 2012
---
Rendi video unpopular opinion: pretending chetbrah is an omnipotent god instead of a friend on an alt talking through discord ruins the videos. 
---
I don’t watch them all but I would say I’ve had over half of them on as background noise.
---
I don't want faster XP rates at all, just less aids ways of training certain skills. I'm sure many feel the same. A good example would be left-click Construction that was popular for a week or two. Identical XP rate, but no carpal tunnel.
---
Sparc Mac 100% still RWT's
---
Welcome to my Ted Talk about why this is bullshit.
---
&gt;I am sorry
---
Decent start.
---
&gt; Hey all. I was extremely intoxicated while having a bad one already and realized the response to settled was dumb.
---
Ah, so the alcohol did it. And it’s not that bad because you were having a bad day. Go on. 
---
&gt; Deleted it 5 minutes after
---
At least 12. Considering that this screenshot is 12 minutes after you tweeted and 6 minutes after Settled replied. So maybe it was 5 minutes after you got called out for being a child. 
---
&gt; and it is not how I really feel
---
Seems if that’s not how you really felt, you wouldn’t have kept replying defensively to Settled or you would have deleted the following defending tweets. 
---
&gt; But obviously that is no excuse.
---
If it’s no excuse then why make the excuse? None of that should matter, so why even say it? 
---
&gt; Originally the tweet was basically me trying to realize what I need to improve on next year because I see it as a hopeless task.
---
If the tweet was you trying to realize what you need to improve on, how does Smokey’s 2 minutes matter? What does that even have to do with what you have to improve on? You need to improve on the fact that the person you lost to had a 2 minute video? That makes absolutely no sense bud. 
---
&gt; Reason being I put my entire heart and soul into something and it wasn't enough. Doesn't mean the other guy didn't deserve it at all!
---
Then why give the excuses at the beginning defending your tweet that made it seem like you meant like he didn’t deserve the award?
---
Here let me edit this for you, nothing that you didn’t write yourself here, just without the bullshit. 
---
&gt; I am sorry. Hey all. No excuses. I put my entire heart and soul into something and it wasn't enough, but obviously that doesn't mean the other guy didn't deserve it at all. I need to improve. Please don't be too upset with me. Love you all. 
---
Notice how you say everything that matters without any of the shit that doesn’t matter. How in that way, you actually state what you did and how you were wrong without trying to minimize what you said?  And notice how you don’t make up excuses so people don’t hate you as much, but after you’ve said everything you should, you kindly ask people not to be too harsh?
---
It seems like the defensive tweets and the excuses at the beginning and this “apology” are just ways to try to get people to hate you less. 
---
When if you really wanted to give an apology you should have just given an apology.
---
Did slayer for a long time but was a bit of a noob and ended up making only about 30m. After that I farmed zulrah for a while untill I was at 70m.
---
 Past that I did Vorkath with a tbp until 120m after which I sold the bank and bought a dhcb. I farmed Vorkath from 92-99 range racking up about 280m in the process.
---
Then my friend told me how easy CoX was and that hed teach me, so he did. Got a T-bow split at 7kc 3-way and now at about 110 kc im at 680m.
---
??? 
---
This isn’t boaty though.
---
Not exactly sure what you want mate, most of these items are just natural gear progressions. Add a few range bonus to rangers and you get pegs, what else are you suppose to do?
---
Most people argue the brokeness of rs3 was MTX, and the power creep which mostly came from overloads and ancient prayers, not ragefire boots or the hand cannon. 
---
Tbow and the BP are incredibly broken but you'll be hard pressed to find anybody that disagrees. And very few people even argue for muh 2007scape like you say. It's all pretty well established and respected that the game has evolved tremendously.
---
Weird. Neverr heard of him before now.
---
Back to lumbridge with a swiftness goblin boy
---
71 slayer 0 kc 0 assingments
---
lolwut..?
---
I'm getting membership for my birthday! I've tried to train my stats as much as possible for questing.
---
If anyone is up for some activities hit me up :)
---
I feel the same about WildMudkip, low key one of the best content creators
---
How does no one know what they look like? J1mmy and Kevin have face cammed on twitch, and Settled has posted pics on twitter.
---
Back when B0aty did it, it would probably be against the rules for account sharing. As for Rendi, it's always been against the rules to sell Infernos, regardless of what the payment is. It would probably get you banned even if you did it for free.
---
Breathtaking man good
---
Breathtaking man funny
---
Breathtaking word good
---
Breathtaking word funny

Must circlejerk over the funny, good man and funny, good word
---
How did you interpret my initial comment?
---
thanks doc
---
I honestly think this is rude as hell.
---
Well u have to be blind and deaf to spend more than 15 seconds on his vids. Hes so annoying and boring
---
It's a tradition to prevent account hacking, by now it's almost a meme tho.
---
And by the time of winning Jagex did not know it was the same person either AFAIK.
---
Scamming people destroying the integrity of the game isn't too bad. If they were caught there would definitely be backlash, but I personally wouldn't care, and I've seen lots of people suggest this exact thing.
---
Yeah likely they'll get it on YT but it's currently on twitch VODS anyway:
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/490186024
---
Slightly related, a group f2p boss sounds fun.
---
You're either blaming jagex for being hacked, or blaming them because you botted. Both are stupid.
---
It's real, but it's defunct and he doesn't do it anymore
---
Yeah I think that would be pretty good
---
Ah right, forgot about account sharing only being allowed a fairly recent time ago.
---
Pretty sure the votes for Sparc Mac were bought since his bank is so massive. But he did also stream with his community by going to the rev caves and doing drop parties. Now we wait for the the “drop party” to happen where half is bank is gone to pay off the voters.
---
If this isn't a troll... 
---
This will take you around the game world while getting some starter levels for member skills.

600m, a mix of Corp and CoX

Thanks all for the responses, I tried to reach out to them on twitter and they asked me to fill out a different form so I did and they replied with another copy-pasted response which was basically the same thing from the original ticket I sent, gave up on that now as it seems like an endless circle of me not being able to get my account back, I did have a few Halloween masks on my RS3 account and I heard they're quiet the hefty amount when transferred to old school so it's a shame, but probably better off for my enjoyment of the game anyway if i'm starting fully from scratch. Much appreciative of all of those who tried to help and offer advice
---
zulrah, vork, raids, slayer (well slayer bosses that is ) 
---
mostly scaled raids too, unscaled is just a waste of time. i was hacked for my tbow at around 1.5b bank and am now rebuilding at around 800m already. usually do 2+1's and 2+2's.
---
I think it works exactly like that
---
Might aswell also be the Best looking pet in the game
---
Yeah, this sounds familiar, good point
---
Well I believe youre stating the obvious is that all these players have done something wrong however what B0aty did was not actually against the rules compared to the other people.
---
I have hellpuppy and its so tiny. I like more bulky Pets like the tangleroot i also have
---
Oh don't worry, this time you can watch this very community kill PKing IN FULL GLORIOUS HD FOR THE LOW LOW PRICE OF ONE SPITE VOTE PER POLL!!
---
He looks exactly like I thought he would tbh
---
[It gets better](https://twitter.com/SettledRS/status/1131682362440540167?s=19)
---
Oh lol i honestly didnt know that, thanks for explaining!
---
What a nerd lmao
---
&gt;Fat people's metabolism is really slow which is a reason why they are fat.
---
Common misconception but it's actually the other way around: Fat people burn far more calories than a thinner person, and to simplify massively, metabolism = how many calories you need to maintain weight. A fat person will lose weight eating what a non-fat person eats. A fat person will burn more calories doing the same activity as a non-fat person. I recommend you watch Supersize vs Superskinny for an example.
---
Obesity is, in 99,99% of all cases, caused exclusively by eating more calories than the body needs. Weightloss can, in 99,99% of all cases, be induced by eating less food or moving more.
---
That wouldnt last
---
He really is offensively ugly. You should shave and you'd be a decent twink.
---
Make one appear 30 minutes after another? Scouting ccs and stuff, it'd feel fun doing it with breaks, chilling with all dem people hunting for trees.
---
I think it's good when they update the old school servers they create. The first game versions like rs3 works as a filter to filter out bad updates :)
---
Asking the real questions
---
that's okay we can't all be right i suppose.
---
In all the most common gearsets for builds that can even use serp it doesn't offer a max hit over nezzy. Nezzy has pray bonus + serp costs 150k/hr in scales to use. It's way cheaper to use nezzy and antis for anything that may poison or venom. Nezzy is better for any combat you're praying in which is most pvm. Not to mention no negative range/mage on nezzy if you are switching styles.
---
If you're wanting serp for the defense, verac helm is cheaper and better defense for a budget option or justiciar for a little more expensive option. 
---
There are very very few niche uses for serp and honestly only one I can think of (crabs in raids).
---
We Do Raids sometimes look for +1s in their raids, you could join something there if you advertise yourself on their discord.
---
If you are still needing the raids completion by Monday evening, I'll boost you through a duo raid on my own. You can just chill out while I do it. I'm not free this weekend, unfortunately.
---
I get the frustration but this isn't acceptable behavior.
---
He’s making an alt the longer he spends not using it to make money or not using it as an actual alt the worse off he is. So it’s about speed.
---
This is rendi in a nutshell pretty much.
---
Idk how much money he has and if he cares either option works ones just faster and more a luxury.
---
Settled acting up a bit there as well...
---
He’s making an alt, it doesn’t matter about it looking bad. Plus NMZ is zero time training while he plays his main.
---
Someone acting like a dickmuffin also doesn't justify you acting like a cuntcake. Both are acting like children.
---
If u haven't found a raid by 6-7pm GMT IL have u as a +1 just for more points :)
---
That's just the UK culture mate
---
Sounds like reddit people have found a new hype train to jump on. Im not a 'maxed sweaty' myself but damn why does everyone on reddit has exactly the same vocabulary?
---
Poe's law.
---
This comment makes no sense
---
Why would you waste money on ether plus make it so you have to pay attention when NMZ is zero time while playing your main account. You’re also not even remotely right.
---
honestly I was trying to be as objective as possible whilst making this, although I am definitely biased against slayer helm because I haven't touched slayer in months and mainly do raids/corp if I'm pvming which the slayer helm is useless at. dk's, ma2, thermy, vorkath and rfd are all pretty easy depending on your account stats and I'm not trying to hide that lol
---
Melees are zero time.
---
"I just wanted her to love me but she wouldn't even look at me ." :(
---
Now i feel bad for killing her...
---
Your absolutely right and i wonder if thats on purpose.
---
because people enjoyed it more
---
Copy-pasting the same, three-word response to all posts is a shallow damage-control tactic. You've posted enough and I'm only halfway through the thread.
---
Oof, how to not be invited next year.
---
It’s not homemade but it’s not many steps further
---
yeah i have a main account i want to pay from. emblem area is the cc?
---
Why?

Honestly what you said wasn’t great, but he went in on you disproportionately hard. Queue the downvotes.

Accomplishment != good or well made video.
---
Smokey made an extremely well made video and won video of the year. 
---
And even if it was an award for most impressive accomplishment I doubt rendi wins. Xzact has been doing some nutty stuff in inferno.
---
What changed?
---
Yes also have done it with a painted dbow
---
Well deserved. The rest of you are just jealous that you're not as cute as him.

He looks daddy AF 😍😍 I'd have a ride on that 🍆
---
Nope. I've got my authenticator and bank pin on
---
People going on about this like it werent 10 years ago get over it bro
---
And I haven't received any emails about any recovery

Is it a meme if he's the only person using it?

Think that was the first of many things that lead me to quitting, changing the dh axe just rubbed me wrong lol

Rendi is clearly arrogant, which is displayed with his behaviour and manurisms. He still thinks that effort alone deserves recognition. That's why he always posts the money spent and hours spent doing every single thing. People don't appreciate bragging, nor do they reward it. His character has showed itself and the community will never forget. 1M subscriber dream gone for sure.

---
The fact that they said “it’s up to us to decide what is and isn’t allowed” and “we don’t have a master list of things not allowed”... 
---
Runelite is to osrs what Technic is to Minecraft. They help each other out and keep players interested in the game. Taking that away will kill off a lot of the community. In my opinion this should have been solved when players were first beginning to use 3rd party clients. Not years later when one of the game creators was like “wait I didn’t know about this stop this now!!” 
---
You can’t do that it’s so intertwined with the game. It’s too late to make those changes now without pissing people off just let them use their 3rd party clients without restriction and gtfo Jagex. Your moderation sucks and you should learn that and know that the players know what’s best for the players and the game not you.
---
Uhhhh...
---
To be fair you'd also likely get banned for posting "osrs is bad come to rs3" on this sub

Oh alright. I'll start up a regular ironman and see how it goes. Thank you.

Sparc mac been in the osrs community for a really long time so in that way it makes sense.
---
My bank is approx 750M. I've just played since day 1 of OSRS and it's kinda accumulated. I don't do anything specifically for money I just do things I find  fun, and over many many years the bank has just gotten bigger.
---
I mean, I'm sitting over here with a 750M bank fetching yew longbows for 100k an hour lol.
---
Poor bosses ain't worth the effort man
---
As long as that cum eating sperglord sicknerd didnt win idgaf
---
Lmao? Dumbass.
---
What are the videos being compared?
---
they want the audience to still have semen remaining to shoot off their cum fireworks when mod ash ascends the stage
---
I honestly am more forgiving and didn't mind the stuff like wifi wars. it was at the very least Runescape themed at one point with the quiz. I still agree with OP and theres much better things that could happen but all of this is fine except the violinists for me.
---
Not only was the segment drawn out, but could Jagex not even do runescape songs? I didn't get to watch the whole thing (left after the quiz) but those violinists felt the most out of place by far.
---
I don't even know where to begin...
---
Oh my god he talked to a fucking WAMEN!!
---
twisted bow = hexhunter bow
---
I'm out of the loop, what happened?
---
Latop on lap is very dangerous. Proven to cause infertility and testicular cancer. Scape safely everyone
---
No, you have to be a dumbass to share your account.
---
Yeah, honestly it really annoys me when Mod Ash does all this bad stuff, like;
---
Faux' content is kind of meh imho and I feel like he's being a smartass which isn't my humor
---
petty jerk should watch his tongue before me and the swampsuckers come sort him out
---
I agree, I’ve been doxxed on rs before and it was absolute hell having my work called, parents called and pizzas ordered to my house.
---
&gt;Fyi, I'm in a long term relationship so yeah.
---
Yeah a long term relationship with your hand 🤣
---
That is true, but he was trying to get higher levels before he got into p2p. He’s super prepared and dedicated. We might be looking at the next woox lol.
---
Type swamplettuce instead
---
Isn't that not allowed?
---
Cheers
---
Exactly lol. There arent that many people anymore who use the ”muh 2007scape” argument luckily since it doesnt make any sense really lol. There is one semi old post which lists stuff in osrs that are added later which are copied/really similar in rs3
---
Lol youre a dumbass
---
Hey, the Violinists were pretty good, it just wasn’t appropriate to have them playing for longer than the actual awards being announced.
---
That fucking host though, ooooohhhh she was fucking bad. She clearly has never played runescape.
---
Lmao
---
Something about “I’m off to c other cities” is just so cute and pure
---
20m in cash currently, probably 50m-100m counting gear and bank value. 
---
Mostly just slayer. Tons of wyverns and brutal black dragons. Maybe some barrows thrown in. Nothing too mind blowing
---
Ah okay cheers. Yeah I haven't been following this and don't watch many RS youtubers so I genuinely don't know.
---
Don't know why someone downvoted me for asking lol
---
This is bait.
---
Astounding.
---
Have you not followed him on zee Twitter?
---
Both games have their share of social deviance but I find osrs is more funny about it. I find that makes it fun to be a part of. The RS3 community tends be prissier and cringier imo.
---
Can't imagine any human being wanting to willing be with you.
---
personally haven't seen or heard of much of that, but i will say that there are a staggering number of people with nazi or other hateful handles (like 'waffen1488' or similar) that i just haven't seen in other games
---
What is happening here?
---
No u you dont. Dipshit. Go back to wacking with your hand
---
Settled is being a twat lol
---
Nah but he's pretty easy if you use mage. Just keep running.
---
Thank you, that was extremely useful and detailed information, i had no idea about the amount of dirt affects the outcome of golden nuggets, i always thought it was random, that will surely speed up things. Alright i will keep the outfit, i will surely gain 100 nuggets anyway mining from 67 to 72, i will get the coal bag after that.
---
Literally nobody will remember this by next week.
---
That whole interview was pretty solid and brought some attention to charities that Jagex helps sponsor in regards to mental health. Sure she interjected at a couple moments when she shouldn’t have but that doesn’t make her a cunt, or wrong.  The “stay in and get pizza” thing wasn’t meant to be taken literally, she was trying to say sit around them and keep an eye on them.  You need to just calm down there pall.
---
Holy shit dude go see a therapist
---
Yeah, I don't think effort decides who wins these things anyway its a democracy, people voted, samw goes for sparcmac winning, people gotta calm, just cause he didn't put as much effort into having a good hardcore account and was just fooling around in the wilderness doesn't mean he didn't deserve to win.
---
Yeah, I'm a f2p lvl 42 mage, but I thought it would be more fun to do with friends
---
I saw the dude in the Reddit comments who said he was going to do this.
---
Because it’s runefest..? It’s about coming together and united the community for future updates ?
---
they mentioned it on a recent livestream too, i believe
---
Not really, its a lot more fun to fight people when you hit every time.
---
Apparently the drive that had the game code for 2007 was on a shelf in storage somewhere. Jagex doesn't seem to really know how to keep backups in an organized area.
---
It was on his twitch, the ironman icon was green and the chat command was something along the lines of jagex allowed us to beta test Group iron man and in June mod ash said we expect group iron man to be the next mode
---
Zyzz was zyzz’s online screen name...chestbrah is his brothers online screen name
---
Had me for the first half, not gonna lie.
---
The title checks out
---
dude just chomping away in the background lol
---
I suggest going for 99 firemaking at wintertodt, and it will boost your bank a lot so you can have more freedom.
---
I’d literally rather die than get 70 smithing in f2p, prayer wouldn’t be too fun either
---
Okay. You have no legs and eat faeces daily. 
---
I've said it, it must be true.
---
The best part was that nearly everything was updated, unlike more recent post-rs3 graphical updates that just update one town and leave it looking like a biome change in old minecraft
---
didn't you ever do seaweed? with your pet rate now you should get it in a couple of days
---
Lol you have too much time in your life to train this on f2p
---
if you feed it acorns it will follow you anywhere within fossil island
---
That looks nice but the touch ups are going to be a bitch.
---
Ah, the "Morytanian Mist". Infused with sweat from countless running through the swamp. If you want to be able to chug this elixir of life - you'll need an ultimate iron stomach to keep it down.
---
Just a couple of things on my mind, don't necessarily disagree with you.
---
A lot of people actually do want to see some, but not all, 2011 content added to the game. It's also well known that rs3 content gets thrown into the bad graphics machine where it becomes content in osrs. (another parallel i wanna add: trident = polypore)
---
And for all the content you mentioned, basically everything only got added to the game gradually over its lifespan of six years. If we got 2011scape we'd literally get almost everything immediately. Kinda accelerates the powercreep in the game.
---
And lastly about polling summ, curses, nex. Eh, fuck it, why not? We'll see how much of the community actually wants them to be added in game. Considering that dclaws and ge passed polls, anything could happen
---
Yes exactly! They didn't completely rework the design of everything and make it all look different, just an update to spruce it all up a little.
---
Careful, don't cut yourself on all that edge
---
If they don’t like PvP and don’t want dev time going towards those updates, then clearly most of the community couldn’t care less. They don’t like PvP. They’re entitled to their opinions. 
---
I know it sucks feeling shafted being on the other side of the fence — but perhaps these PvP updates will come with time. Not to say you’re on the losing side of democracy here buddy, but I’d imagine you’d prefer Jagex reconsidered polling some of these updates, and that I’m actually personally on board with.
---
And so is mining imo
---

Oh ye? I sat in skype calls with mr Kevin Moran back in 2012, before he was a big YouTuber.

wtf

On you mean Tears of Guthicc skill?

cmon bro he’s just chillin

I used to make Runescape-inspired drawings like these back in 2007 too lol. Simpler times.

why not both?

I remember making so many with my friends in class, this one survived because it was folded up in an old book I found.
---
This happened to me on my rune pure that I used for f2p pking back in the day.
---
cause he makes quality stuff :)
---
I don’t see why not. If I programmed mouse movements into the keys then maybe but idk
---
 i dunno man, i think he’s done some amazing stuff considering he can’t leave morytania
---
Rendi video's maybe take a lot of effort and skill, but they still boring as shit to watch tbh. Lilsmokey vid are short but are fun bc of the great edits.
---
you clearly are lmao
---
unpopular opinion: his content is stale
---
Were you doing seaweed, mushrooms, cactus, and belladonna?
---
Juppeliscape
---
Past this next statement you are a waste of energy.  I’m convinced you didn’t even read what I wrote or you just can not comprehend English that well.  All you did was give me a list of suicides when nowhere in my original post did I discredit suicide or mental health issues. Learn to comprehend what people say instead of going on your pre-scripted rant next time.
---
Imo why RC is worse than agility and mining is cause it's pretty click intensive and requires a fair amount of attention (and yes I know zmi has helped with this) but I find it worse because agility it's just brainlessly clicking, mining is slow but very afk with upstairs mlm. Both either having extra XP an hour or afkability.
---
All this pre 77 RC as bloods and souls have that afkness that brings it to the same level as the others.
---
And also I think group mentality probably plays a role in it I didn't hate RC as much before I discovered this sub hahah
---
The hero is overpowered but overly cautious
---
Dont use ranging pots
---
I’ve heard all about it, but i wasn’t actively playing at the time. Either way, i only hang out with my CC and my cousin’s group of 200m xp friends so i don’t really get a chance to interact with those kinds of people.
---
that wasnt the point.
---
the point is that some npcs/bosses in this game has a bugged attack.
---
This is the worst luck so far on phoenix (450m+ exp)
---

---
you have to re install runelite, but the stuttering is a runelite bug
---
But Kevin shows his face often in his vids.
---
Probably a PKer 😂
---
I think none will argue about it either.
---
There's plenty balancing options. You could still make the exp and the rewards good. I think the perfect scenario is large spikes in experience, but less consistency over traditional skilling. So it's still overall less exp/hr than say 3tick teaks for example. But if you get lucky one day with a few high end trees in a row you would get lots of exp, but that wouldn't happen often. 
---
If you make it like Evil Trees in Rs3 where there are different types you have that. The higher trees would be more desirable and even if they weren't rarer to spawn (they could be) they would be the ones people look for. Though I'd rather the higher trees not be significantly better just marginally better through linear scaling from the low end trees. (aka say the lowest tree is 100% reward, next tree would be 105%, 110% and so on) That way low end trees aren't ignored if there is no other choice. Higher trees have higher requirements.
---
The other way you could balance is if the activity itself takes a decent amount of time. 20+ minutes to take down a tree. (this would also give people time to show up) You could have the trees give an indicator for about when they will be completely grown to give people time to plan. Give experience during the activity, but rewards after the tree is dead. Make it like wintertodt where you can qualify for rewards through points rather than spliting rewards based on damage dealt. 
---
You could balance by how many spawn per world and how many spawn per day. Meaning you could make say max 2 trees per world that spawn once every 8-12 hours. (random each day so the times couldn't be mapped by players) There's plenty of worlds that people will be in a cc scouting and sharing their location.
---
You could make the trees cause disruption, so they are "in your face" meaning they block off certain places randomly or spawn in insane places that make it interesting. People would feel like they are doing a service by killing the trees. I mean they are EVIL, if I was an evil tree I would grow right next to General Graador and start throwing logs at people. If I was a smart Evil tree I would grow in Rev caves. The more varied/random the spawn points are the better, in rs3 every spawn point is mapped which is boring imo. 
---
Sorry for the long read, these are just some ideas.

The run from the dark altar to blood altar loops around so you can click the far end, meanwhile the path to soul altar is almost straight so you have to click more often during the run.
---
He is

Absolute madlad. I threw in the towel at 80 mining. Congrats!!!
---
Rendi, I appreciate you owning your mistake and I don't think your apology comes across fake at all.
---
I'm a big fan of your videos and and constantly impressed by what you are able to pull off. Who cares if you lost some popularity contest. Next time you got this.

?
---
I could sticky it, but I consider this more of a personal thing than a subreddit thing. But some years it doesn't get noticed much and sometimes they don't gain much traction to pretty late.
---
That’s like 10 games
---
Just because it's your opinion doesn't mean it's toxic.
---
Divine super combats
---
Like when you come up against a boss in an RPG that you can't kill after a few attempts, you go and train for a while, get OP weapons, come back and absolutely murder the fucker.
---
I think most people are down for new content, as long as it’s fair and balanced. why would anyone want things to remain the same where eventually things just get stale
---
I used to think tanzoo and virtoso were scrawny and settled was buff af based off of their voices.
---
Jesus
---
You spend ~70 extra hours doing bloods instead of souls. That alone should encourage you to do souls instead, especially since you could use that saved time to make a lot more money than what bloods what have given you.
---
Did you... Did you talk to Oziach?
---
You’re ridiculously prepared!!! Nice job brother. Really good stats for F2p only.
---
If you see someone walking down the road and you don't like his shirt, do you go to his face and tell him to fuck off? I certainly hope not. 
---
It's ok to have and opinion and ok to voice it but know when and how.

The absolute fucking mad lad, jumped in head first without a fucking worry what a total chad Swolvesta is new daddy
---
Honestly I kinda hope they do the necromancy rework, except they make it an entirely new combat skill with it's own playstyle. I think that'd be one of the only skills with a real chance to pass, and just being a spellbook won't do it justice.
---
Basically what summoning should've been.
---
His achievements are interesting but he himself is boring to me. It's a weird combination. I usually skip around his vids to the parts or watch sped up.
---
The announcement
---
Yes. Kill NPCs on different squares.
---
Just because he chooses not to use 3rd party clients, why must that be imposed on the rest of us? 
---
That’s just my opinion, runelite really makes the game much better for me
---
Being born with it.
---
Prayer is the biggest difference of any skill between mem/f2p. Burying big bones is 15 xp, whereas dragon bones at the gilded altar are like 500 xp. You need like 4 invs of big bones per dragon bone.
---
ngl I thought this meant "when you see a noob die at barrows ***2 guthan***" 
---
and then I realized it doesn't.
---
Yup. I enjoyed the videos at the time. The loot he got from some of the lures was astronomical.
---
Literally just type the phrase "6:15 pm BST" into google and itll show u
---
The community that will never vote to buff content? Sure
---
Yikes
---
My mistake meant to say afk pray mage. Also no low level content should introduce a bis helm. It should been released as true mid tier content and not low level everyone can do shit.
---
settled looks weirdly like my brother
---
Yea the Mac ecosystem is untouchable
---
Agreed, I understand why they don't do it for the most part. Just would be a nice QoL change for people like myself. I get burnt out staring at OSRS sometimes when doing monotonous stuff like rune crafting hahaha. But I always just take a break because I love the game anyways.
---
Mind if i hav a go at that gash m8?
---
@coxie
---
Woodcutting and burning yews wouldn't be the absolute worst compared to doing magics.
---
It’s not about making the game easier it’s about sacrificing some qol to fully remove the op aspects of 3rd party clients and Botting clients also
---
I'll agree with you, but only because I hate graceful. It sucks to go skilling and see 300 players wearing the exact same outfit.
---
Well, my opinion is still that some improved dead content can be more interesting than new one.
---
Lol no. Stop jerking off into your body pillow and realize pornstars aren’t the norm lmao she’s not a 5
---
At least with RC I feel like I'm doing something. Like yeah its slow and tedious but I'm creating something.
---
Agility is literally just running around in circles and maybe occasionally stopping to pick up a penny on the ground.
---
well the crowd is not fulled and there not that many ppl around but when the golden gnomes start itll be prolly
---
I played mostly mobile until recently. I can do barrows brothers and have competed all but 4 quests, currently working on mm2. I haven’t had any problems playing mobile and due to my crappy laptop I can pray flick better on mobile that’ll on my computer.  I have an iPhone 8 if that matters lol.
---
I think it would bring in a new era of rsmv’s since the golden age for those started with the rshd update, but I feel like too many people do youtube as a job these days that they wouldn’t be able to deal with the demonetization that’d come with it.
---
I cant kill zulrah. I died around 15times so far, watched many guides, tried void/ahrims/karils, have blowpipe and trident. 89range + 79mage. 
---
I always end up either getting koed or surviving to see the jad phase and die. 
---
I've always had this problem even with jad fight caves and I've been playing since 2008, switching items/prayer+eating? = insta death.
---
I came to realize I am so bad at this game and I dont know what to do anymore.
---
anyone has any recommendation or should I just quit trying any pvm content? Thank you.
---
This is the quality memes I sub for
---
golden gnomes were yesterday?
---
for a solid month, yes he did.
---
Well the games basically done for you now with the best weapon in the game or BIS gear for every combat form
---
My 4 best irl buddies all play ironman and we're waiting for the day group ironmen comes out.
---
They didn't promise shit they said it require loads of engine work
---
This has to be a troll
---
That was last night mate, I think its because the golden gnomes everyone attends, at the moment there is a lot going on and nothing is compulsory. I’m watching mythbusters on the main stage but theres another stages and loads walking around
---
fuck me yes im wrong...
---
Use spawn prediction and the waves are trivial.
---
the type of axe matters of course, yes. tick manipulation changes the frequency with which you attempt to gather the resource but the chance of actually gathering a resource on that attempt is dictated by level and axe.
---
3t with rune axe will still be much faster than 2t with a rune axe though.
---
My Idea: keep basilisks a slayer task, revert buff on superior and take away the jaw drop from BOTH these monsters. Have a key drop (more common from superior) similar to mossy key/etc. that gives access to fighting Basilisk (King?, Queen?) which will be the only Basilisk type that actually drops the jaw. Gives access to med level accs to actually complete this slayer task effectively, while still maintaining a challenge/barrier around a BiS drop. Thoughts?
---
Smouldering lamp promos aren't content?
---
if your gonna camp blowpipe bring a blessing
---
He shoulda lied and said crack.
---
Yeah seems like a huge barrier for new players. Anytime someone sees me playing, their reaction to the graphics is usually “ew”. I don’t think updating the textures would ruin the integrity of OSRS
---
Wtf are you on about? Just because something isnt a meme, doesn't make it not entertainment. Every single content creator on youtube and twitch are entertainers. Your last sentence is very true though.
---
Can't recommend WDR, I went in there and asked a couple basic questions about gear and like 5 dudes (some were mentors mind you) started belittling me for it. If that's the kind of mentors you're getting at WDR, fuck all that.
---
Csgo
---
Honestly, I think Zulrah is harder than a lot of other pvm content and I feel like people make it seem easier than it is. I'd honestly advise trying to do Dragon Slayer 2 and practise Vorkath - I think it's a much easier boss but still fairly mechanically heavy so that you learn the skills to pvm. Then after you've done that for a bit you can go back to Zulrah. Just remember it takes practise to get better.
---
I tend to take life a little less serious than you might
---
It's the opposite for me. When Zeah rc'ing, graceful is a must so you see everyone wear it. Some agility courses like Prifddinas don't need graceful so I rarely ever see it there.

---
Get a blessing instead of those arrows, and replace the prayer potions with restores. If you're not too confident I'd probably take 6 brews instead of 4. GL with the cape
---
He has the most slappable face ive seen in a while
---
Yeah but you can mix it up with some slayer training and any others skills you like to do.
---
Have fun brother!
---
personally ive literally never had any problems with them
---
I wouldn't say solos are too worth it, as someone who solos. They start off and become tedious. You can really pump them out in teams a lot easier and more leisurely.
---
Sure you "could" say that but unfortunately it's not true. In almost all the common melee setups, the 1 extra str bonus from faceguard does push you into a new max hit.
---
And prayer pot =/= poison immunity potion. You're spending 150k/hr for poison immunity whereas it would cost you only 10k/hr with a nezzy and anti. While with the nezzy you'll be saving a few pray pots a hour at 10k savings a piece. So you're essentially in comparison spending 170k a hr for serp over nezzy.
---
Most pvm you're not actually worried about tankiness and usually protect prayer. The instances where you do verac helm will be better due to no cost. Yes you lose 1 max hit, but in the scenario where you're tanking, I can't think of a single boss or use where 1 max dmg will make you lose 150k in profits (cost of serp) to justify using serp.
---
And not to mention when bossing, more often than not blowpipe will be better and you'll have a venom chance already, or the boss will be immune to venom making that aspect of serp useless. As for trash mobs, they shouldn't be alive long enough to venom and see that benefit.
---
Join a competent bossing or pvm clan and you'll truly understand how useless serp is lol. Only one instance where I could even start to think to use it.
---
No way they make 400-500k profit without DWH. Blowpipes are expensive to use.
---
imbue your archer ring, bring more brews, wear a blessing. You could also replace your helm and legs for verac helm and verac skirt for more range defence which makes the later waves easier. Also theres no reason to bring parayer pots, just use all restores
---
Dragon bones are 252 xp at an altar. Superior dragon bones are 525.
---
What pots are you running out of first idd suggest more brews and do it on task so you get the damage bonus from slayer helm you have to unlock it first ofc
---
ugly mutt pet.
---
Reinstall runelite to fix the issue
---
Meanwhile, I’m 80+ dry on solos :( I hope I get to see a Tbow someday.
---
Congratulations though! Huge drop.
---
Keep your head high man!  Look at it like this - I wasn't aware of your content until the drama or whatever last night so I looked you up.   And really like your videos!  So you made at least one new subscriber from all this, probably many!  
---
Imagine taking such a petty comment so seriously lol. In terms of looks, you're either lucky, unlucky or adequate
---
This is entirely just because some people cheat with certain stuff in PvP, that they would do even if runelite was removed
---
But yeah let's just make the game worse for most players why don't we, what a shitty opinion
---
What are you on about? Spawn prediction is referring to the fact that where monsters spawn in early waves correlates to where monsters (and jad) will spawn later in the caves. Nothing to do with a 3rd party client.
---
mobile is doable for a lot of stuff but anything involving lots of right clicking is gonna be way way worse. you also don't have f-keys to switch between interface tabs quickly so that's a pretty significnat disadvantage. 
---
you can get pretty far into the game without really being bottlenecked by mobile but high level content is gonna require a mouse keyboard for most people.
---

I can’t print the screen anymore as I logged in, which takes down the tally. I will, however, upload the other two logins I did last night, including my alt.

Not really a game that's playable in 2019 if you're using the vanilla client. It's aids.
---
My alt had over 2000+ days without play it’s FACKED
---
Well, I can see he . . . *settled down.*
---
**YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH**
---
I feel bad, he was obviously nervous and trying. I hope someone read that out for him!
---
I feel like his point of 'removing 3rd party clients' isn't aimed at base runelite or osbuddy; it's more the 3rd party clients like the ones that were used in dmm that have them timers of freezes and safespots for pvp. Torvesta has stated in his videos before about this issue, so that's what I think he's trying to say here.
---
At least thieving can get over 200k xp/hr with relative ease, agility is always bad.
---
That's called supply and demand. Not inflation. If there were inflation, the price of *everything* would be going up. But the prices of a lot of things actually seem to be trending down.

Read the first tweet I posted before the response. In actual chronological order. Nothing was mentioned about smokey till someone mentioned him. The OP was based on my hopeless feeling of putting everything into something and it not being enough exactly as I worded it earlier.
---
I believe a spell with those rune costs would be called "Big Hitta"
---
I didn’t even mean to do that lol just crossed out the numbers and quickly “filled in” the xp bar

Well I haven't done MEP2 yet, so i guess i'll give this a shot.

I think we might be the same person. I remember sitting in the back of class drawing these kind of things. I’d make like an entire PvP scenario in my head good stuff!

Bring 7 brews, 2 range pots, Torag leg swap, rest restores, blessing, and sweets.

Maybe a Crystal bow instead of a restore. That way you can target something farther away if needed.

I did not say I am sorry to comments supporting myself if I did I I might have misunderstood

Wtf did he say?  I couldnt hear.

So he looks like a younger, nerdier Ice Poseidon.

I wonder what the actual lowest level you can be is while full void melee, range and mage
---
I like Rendi, but I like making humour of light hearted situations more. This has more or less been resolved albeit with some lingering fallout.
---
No thanks x100
---
Is there a place where I can find all quest items needed for certain quests? like. Not just one quest, but lets say all f2p quests.
---
So I can just buy them all at once?
---
Way to be dramatic lol
---
Thanks, I’m a big hit in my class
---
Real talk, how long would it take to efficiently grind out 70 herb if you bought all the items beforehand? Certainly at least a few hours?
---
Yeah.. I really, really, really want to fuck her.
---
It would be a easy way to make a new company to get away from Chinese influence..

But in actuality, I accidentally bursted him instead of barraged and thought I had more time to finish his last 2hp... I've since nicknamed him "one hit wonder."

Breaking game rules violates Twitch TOS.

Encouraging users to break Jagex Rules and he's a huge streamer.
---
People trap the knights in a corner so they can't move so all you have to do is click them. 
---
You used to just get gold from them so you could so this forever without even looking. Just click. 
---
They updated it so now you get coin pouches that don't stack so your inventory will fill up. then you have to click the pouch to get the gold. Still not bad but not nearly as easy as it was.

I hate how people defend toxic drinking behaviour and alcoholism as “culture”.

Thanks everyone :D

Originally, I wanted to get 99 RC from Tears of Guthix but before I finished the grind to 99 slayer this quest came out and the quest rewards happen to have the last two skills I had left and I saw the stars align
---
Haha it makes me laugh that male feminists think women cosplaying with their tits out dont want male attention

i just want swampy to see this. this is about them, it has nothing to do with tweets, likes or anything else that you care about so much.

Evil trees and Daily activities are problem in rs3.

This isnt another mobile log few Times A Day game.

---
Yes, to kill zammy it is most efficient to boost points and skip tasks until you get a zammy / gdz task. That’s how people farm the boss. You average the highest kills per hour doing it via that method. I don’t know how to make it any more clear to you. It’s okay to just be wrong, you know?
---
tbf they probably were strong on that one bc kemp is within their friend circle and he was probably salty
---
&gt;Why would you set up a stopwatch though when you can use a client that does it for you? Why set up farming timers when you can use a client that does it for you? 
---
Personally? Because I'm over the age of 7 and can handle playing a kids game without needing a client to tell me how to play. If I'm feeling lazy that day and don't want to put in the extra effort guess what? I just don't get the benefits that come with putting in that extra effort and I'm fine with that because I'm an adult.
---
My main point is that all you morons who comment things like "just count to 3 xD", "just use a stopwatch xD" , "just do it 4head", etc. to justify using 3PC  are lying to yourselves. Doing things manually isn't as easy as a 3PC no matter how many times you tell yourself you could do it without 3PC. 
---
&gt;Why would you risk missing expensive drops like snapdragon seeds when you can use a client that highlights those items
---
This exists on the main client you stupid fuck.
---
&gt; Like bro, there's plenty of good reasons to use 3rd party clients than just "I want the game to be easier."
---
Not really, you just want the 3PC to do all the thinking for you and you just call it QOL to make pretend your not making the game easier for the sake of making it easier. Oh there's a little bit of nuance for this thing? Better turn on my 3PC plugin that completely erases it.
---
The only actual feature is the CPU shit and that's only a thing because so many people are playing this game on toasters.
---
Good for him
---
I hope he got lifetime membership for his main and Swampletics.
---
what is that in freedom time?
---
So that's why the black dragons sit at the end of the cave
---
Maybe he plays for the experience and not the easiest ways or efficient. The game is far more enjoyable if you do that imo. Unless you’re chasing ranks and get enjoyment out of that. I’ve be been on both sides of the aisle, first 5 years of my rs journey I played to enjoy then it turned to addiction and played for ranks and now I consider myself a retired player and play the game to enjoy it after 15 years of it. Perhaps he’s just like the rest of us when we first started. Has that crossed your mind?
---

Was anyone really surprised?

Why tf overlap UI stupid

More brews?

It's level 51. You'd have to quest a fair amount of the experience to keep your HP at 42, though that's not difficult.
---
This.... this wasn't a race. Did I miss a tiebreaker round where Rendi lost a footrace? They didn't compete to make the video first. It was literally a judgement of whose final product was better. I'm beginning to believe you don't know what they actually competed at. As such, have a good day and bless your heart.

The Jagex twitch channel is not moderated by Jagex and they don’t make the rules or select the mods. They influence them heavily and verified the channel but they 100% don’t make the calls on what is and isn’t allowed

Really though, I think I like him more than I did before. We've all been in a place of needing to rant because we're down/disappointed with a situation, but this man stepped up and took ownership of his mistakes. Serious props to Rendi!

It's easily my least favorite update to the game, even more so than EOC
---
Get off your high horse. 
---
Firstly, it’s already public. Secondly, I’m not shaming (if anything, its showcasing the apology). Lastly, it’s humour based off the situation that is now largely resolved.
---
Different is one is a boss and the other is a normal mob.  Why should a mob give the highest rates in the game over the hardest end game pvm?  Tob use to be 7m a hr before scythe crashes now it’s less then 6m a hour. Best gp/hr shouldn’t come from a wilderness mob that does zero damage to the player.
---
RuneScape died the day bank sales did,
---
Hence why we can make light of it with some humour. I agree!
---
You’re trying so hard. Good for you 🥺
---
You're speaking from your own experiences, which is why your imagination is so limited, it will prevent you from growing and learning as a person. Try not to push your thought patterns onto other people and consider how this being resolved would benefit this community.
---
It's consistent though, unlike something such as mlm, making it far better for me. 99 agility was very chill for me just watching tv shows. Some obstacles are often over 10 seconds and you know whats coming anyway.
---
Honestly, fuck you. Swampletics hasn't done a thing wrong. I will honestly fight anyone IRL who disagrees. Swampletics must be defended.
---
Yes, but it's not normal human beings commenting on her.

HCIM content is literally a dime a dozen on YouTube and twitch.

Double the viewers for osrs keynote...???
---
Keynote has not even happend yet, its gonna happen any minute now
---
You wouldn't simply remove the hence, you would have to reword the sentence.
---
"It's an alt, hence why I didn't blur it"
---
It should be "It's an alt, that's why I didn't blur it" or "It's an alt, hence the lack of blur" or however else you feel like wording it.
---
I'm not going to try and defend my example as the perfect comparison, but here's how I thought of it. You can, if you like, say "I chose to make the decision to settle on the determination of whether or not to blur the name." That's all cluttered and an exaggerated version of what I was trying to get across, which I'm sure everyone can agree is wrong.
---
In the second sentence, I'm sure there are circumstances you could create to give proper context to a sentence like that, as you have suggested. I was specifically trying to keep it within this immediate context. (and maybe it does, I don't know anything about settled's decision-making process)
---
I'm glad you asked why removing hence would work, I'll try to be clearer in the future.
---
do you have slayer? if so bursting dust devils or nechs in the combs
---
Why would you limit yourself to f2p if you enjoy the game so much? I could never wait to get to p2p when I first started lol
---
You didn't link anything
---
Not everyone(i can't yikes)can do corrupted so i put two most easiest and best ways to get shards for most of the playerbase.
---
That's a good point, and I'm unsure of how that would affect this chart if it would. 
---
This is all 1-99 (technically 98 with 1 exp to go for 99)
---
I'm sure post 99 would look at least a bit different.
---
95% of the chat is hate towards rs3, the things that get deleted are people spamming the same letter/word/emote because thats how the automod works
---
I got 99runecrafting on rs3, darkscape (when it was live) and on osrs. But I can’t bring myself to do even more then 10minutes of agility before wanting to kill myself.
---
Congrats my man! You can finally play the game.
---
can you pm disc link? I don't see it anywhere
---
The scaling is very minor. It basically just means you get less rewards if you're under 114 combat.
---
A number of plans. That number could be 0
---
Woah dude, who took the jam out of your doughnut?
---
Awesome new skill announcement.
---
There are tons of little things you can add to your farm runs to offset the cost of trees, herbs being the big main one but most patches have a decently profitable option. Just check some youtube guides for full farm runs
---
Their [ban appeal system](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000867958-Appeal-a-ban) is designed for your exact situation (hijacked, then banned) have you given that a go?

Imagine wearing a skillcape for the stats

The OSRS streaming community would beg to differ. But i would agree with you. Not the smartest decision for long term.
---
How much dps is it over regular whip? At least on low def monsters
---
The brothers have been to many Runefests
---
make an Ironchad. There's a huuuge community for it in rs3.
---
Slayer is also a harder one to calculate since it is highly dependant on combat stats and gear. If you don't train it until you are max combat with BiS gear, that will be very different exp rates from a level 3 with no gear trying to train it. Either way, I think we can all agree that Slayer, RC, and Agility are some of the slowest skills. But Agility is the least AFKable of the three.
---
To kill Cerberus...
---
Seeing his face kind of ruins his videos for me
---
I don't understand what you're trying to say. Shards cost is tied to divine potions cost and that's how i got a value in gp for them. 
---
Are you saying you should be able to charge a one time fee for a no charge consuming blade of saeldor?
---
got the rs3 team on the osrs twitch and osrs on the jagex upcoming? Why isnt rs3 on the runescape channel..? Oh yeah, because it's a dead channel.
---
Have you, say, tried looking up a guide?
---
its already happened, we're getting a new skill called sexing where we fuck eachother and raise babies, 2 new quests, a new minigame
---
Humble
---
Exactly, I had just hit 99 slay too- check my post history. I can't even play that account anymore, so I started a pure. I mined like 2k runite ores then transferred that to the pure. Might do some hydra tasks on it for future funding of the pure but I'll never leave anything on it again. It's like when my car got stolen irl.. got it back after repairs and I traded it in. Didn't feel like it was mine anymore.
---
How? It’s people celebrating someone who did something great by the community standards. Swamp man forever

Only watch ironmen streams - there are actual gambling streams out there

My parents host a large event in the city I grew up in. For a decade or so they hosted it themselves. One year they decided to hire an event host and it was horrible. She wasn't even from our city and knew nothing about the event.
---
This brings back memories of that night.
---
hire this man jagex
---
Wtf? That's pretty sweet lmao
---
So someone else mentioning him made it ok to shit on him as long as you outlined your excuses on Reddit later and spammed I’m sorry to everyone. Got it. 
---
Like don’t get me twisted here, I’m not trying to fuel the cancel fire or anything. People should be able to say stupid shit and if they realize it was stupid shot and apologize, they can move on. 
---
But the defensive tweets still up, the excuses, caring about how it’s going to look to your fans rather than giving an apology to the person you shat on doesn’t show that you’re truly sorry. 
---
It shows that you don’t want this situation to negatively affect you and that you’re sorry you got yourself into this situation. 
---
&gt; The OP was based on my hopeless feeling of putting everything into something and it not being enough exactly as I worded it earlier.
---
I don’t see how this makes giving excuses any better even when you say “no excuse” in your comment.  
---
The way you “apologized” here and this reply show that you’re sorry that there is backlash and that’s what you wish you could take back. Not that you’re sorry you were a prick and wish you could take that back. You’re more concerned about how you look because of your shitty comments rather than apologizing for your shitty comments. 
---
I dunno man, you do you. You definitely have a super high potential as a content creator. This shitty defensive self serving apology is a huge show of that.
---
Do you know anyone that would be potentially live tweeting the keynote?
---
No.
---
the invite link for the volcanic mine discord is **VfZsNEF**
---
they've broken down volcanic mine into 4 roles (5 if you count leeching) and they have super in-depth guides for how to do each. if you're a newbie, just do B check or C fix. team VM is around 90k xp/hr at 90+ mining - currently I am only 78 mining and I was getting around 58k xp/hr in a team, so keep that in mind if you want to try out VM at a lower mining level. it is indeed ridiculously afk but you need to make sure you don't die and also to not fuck up your role, as it'll hurt your team as well.
---
The concept of the video is good, but the entire entertainment value of the video is seeing someone do it, and his bad memes. Is someone puts out a 3 hour film of them doing 100,000 pull ups in a row, should it win an Oscar just because the challenge is cool?
---
Lmao why would you donate to someone with over 1b debt
---
They didn't give a clear timezone for the schedule. I think it was just "UK Time" which is not helpful when both BST and GMT are used in the UK. I assumed it was BST and it seemed correct yesterday, but perhaps UK Time meant Jagex Time... Which seems to be one of those odd half an hour later timezones =P
---
Thanks gonna check it out

Ultimate chad you mad lad :D
---
I live by the motto, "fuck beggars and especially fuck anyone who gives money to them".

People who actually work for their money unite!
---
I feel like I saw a dude get 99 agility then firemaking, cooking, fletching, and maybe something else as well all at the same time. I'm not sure if someone knows the actual record. I'd assume there'd be a cap just based on how many skills you can level based on not moving too far. I guess you could just have some stored up lamps though.
---
That actually sounds interesting. However, I haven't played in like 7 years so I'm really far behind on content.
---
She’s so fucking hot though omfg I want her to sit on my face
---
GOOD SONG
---
Does it give runecrafting xp?
---
The accounts are connected through both games so it’s irrelevant that the backup is from 2007, no?
---
Whip is 82 str
---
Blade is 89 str and is BiS str slash weapon in-game. 
---
People pay 30m for prims for just +1 str bonus so blade of saeldor is a big upgrade
---
45min late and counting... bruh
---
Gratz on the quest cape and maxing your acct
---
Staking streams need to be banned. This shit is legit gambling and every single one of them is in debt.

If my comments are getting deleted the invite code is Yb5PB4

Until the shards are tradeable like zulrah scales it will be dead content and keep the price of the 'valuable' drops down cause nobody wants to use them.

hey guys, now that we've stooped to a low level while drunk, but then kindly apologized it, we can step into a better light while reddit stoops even lower then i ever could.
---
looks like stooping lower than reddit is... RENDIPROOF
---
I tried doing some of the quests in the order listed in that guide, but it does get boring fast. I skipped large sections of it to do the quests that I actually wanted to do.
---
Good for him. He's better than that. 
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I think Settled replying with a pretty sarcastic comment to Rendi's rant was a little inappropriate. He was obviously emotional and Settled just kind of poked him a little further. That being said, it looks like water under the bridge, and hopefully it stays that way.
---
Tbh "i was drunk and emotional" isnt a good excuse.
---
Start a regular ironman.
---
Group ironman might not be coming out for years, and it's not going to be as popular as people think. After the initial hype wears off, there won't be many "normal"/casual players doing group ironman. It's really only going to be good for streamers and hardcore players, your average player will have a hard time finding a group to play with that doesn't quit a few months in. Really can't see many "groups" stick around for years unless it's their career (like in the case of streamers) or if it's 1 person operating multiple accounts.
---
What a coward.
---
Lmao that's literally me, I'm 90 farming but got mining pet at 62.
---
If ur a public figure, u cant be acting like a petulant child for losing. He's entitled to feel however he would like, but the second he made it public, he messed up, alcohol or not. Settled comment was half a joke and half a good observation. Does Rendi suffering to make his video make it any better of a video? No, and given he could've made the exact same video after getting better, there was no reason to have put himself through that in the first place.
---
This dude's a straight alcoholic
---
I am not able to watch it, so what is the name of this girl? Is it Mod Gee?
---
You realize you could simplify that to 836/1497 right? Amateur
---
Hyphonix just got banned on Twitch for an unknown reason. He is currently streaming on YouTube and has like 37b in debt lmao, down from his peak of 62b.
---
Honestly I can see why Rendi is mad about this it feels like he had a huge goal oriented video and lost because swampman good
---
Swampletics exposed was good but not award winning
---
Paid actor
---
&gt;because I'd prefer my stopwatch built in to the client instead of opening an external program for it
---
No It's because you much prefer RL to do all the work for you and auto reset itself and put itself directly on top of the screen and only show up exactly when you need it to without putting in any effort on your behalf.
---
You have never and will never use a stopwatch to do anything in runescape because it's too much work for you, thats why you and everyone else uses RL. You want all the benefits putting in the effort of using a stopwatch but none of the actual effort. It's not QOL its because RL makes the game easier and more afkable for you with zero effort on your end.
---
No, I think she's an "event host" from a private company.
---
that's like people who act like assholes and then say "im depressed lol" or "im bipolar lol"
---
I feel so let down if I'm honest. I don't see why morytania needs so many more updates at this point when other areas surely need addressing first. It just seems like this is slightly catered towards settled, which yes, is kind of understandable. But there was so much potential and hype around this year's announcements. 
---
Group ironman is huge but expected,
---
It would be weird to rename it, it's been called that for so many years now regardless of it not even being in the game
---
You don't need to customize if you don't want too. Nothing wrong with RS3 interface, people can adjust it to their liking.
---
Yep, my exact thought. Couldn't care less about highscores and world firsts for raids or loot completions. I know some people really do and for those it's great that they exist and they can race on release but I'd be content with mine getting wiped or w/e just to play with my friends.

Back to to the hotel room to give that bag a good ol suck.
---
Honestly this situation has made me lose a bit of respect for Settled. There was no need to make such antagonistic comments towards Rendi.
---
It's really easy to throw punches when you're at the top, huh Swampman? But throwing punches downward doesn't make anyone look good.
---
I believe most of the people hyped about this update haven't played in a while, and therefore aren't vocal about it. I know lots of people that have been waiting for this update to come out before playing again.
---
It sounds like a lot of the work is coming from the clans feature as well, which is a long overdue feature for another niche group.
---
they said nightmare is going to be a group boss more like corp, it's not raids 3
---
desert update is hopefully coming in the future but I'm also okay with them fleshing out unfinished morytania content like Slepe, tbh
---
Yup, this content is definitely being catered towards streamers. I just started a btw back in January and I really don't have any desire to start again, even if it is with a group of friends.
---
Dude I loved this, ty
---
I'd be surprised if it was anything more than a link to the channel. I don't see voice coming anytime soon.
---
Happy to hear it!
---
did you even listen to the announcement?
---
Already sounds op but let’s see
---
The only thing I'm excited for with group ironman is I think there will be a few really cool new youtube and twitch content. Besides that it's useless for me.
---
Oh that’s a skilling pure. A skiller is just someone who likes training skills in the game more than combat. Like a bot with feelings.
---
With your combats you can easily bang out a quest cape. In your shoes I would juggle that with doing barrows for money for more bonds/gear to move up to Zulrah and Vorkath
---
I don't think they would share the same hiscores
---
It just seems a bit silly to develop the whole back end clan system to also support group ironman, only to limit it to 5. If you have more than 4 friends who would want to join you, you cant.
---
Either way it's great we are getting the update. I'm just a bit disappointed by this restriction.
---
literally the blood amulet of fury from RS3 lmao
---
B sales were the shit
---
Tbh Id rather see them fully focus on one area and finish it completely instead having random pieces of content and quests all over the map. Maybe they will start working on desert once they feel like Morytania is finished.
---
Hmmm, if thats the case then I misunderstood.
---
Faux actually knew omg
---
Poop brown cus ironmen are shit
---
Hell yes!
---
No idea, I really thought a massive pyramid raid with a bunch of really cool Egyptian god type bosses would be incredible
---
It’s a spooky place that spooky things congregate to. It makes sense.
---
I do imagine that there will be separate banks, one for the group and one for each member, due to un-tradables being locked to each individual account.
---
It's a conspiracy, more content for Swampletics.
---
I too have access to RuneLite developer tools
---
Lord Drakan better be a repeatable boss with a harder version after the quest is complete (just like Vorkath).
---
Ever since I was a kid reading his lore, being a badass General of Zamorak's army I always envisioned him as some end-game boss.
---
When I think of Lord Drakan I think of the Unseen Elder in The Witcher 3. When I imagine Lord Drakan entering the battlefield he commands thick black clouds to cover the lands in shadow and a storm of blood rains from the clouds.
---
Breh they are a 60 Slayer req monster if what u sayin was the case then why didn't they raise the LV REQ Make no sense
---
Epic troll
---
Good thats what you get for killing attacking me during my callisto trip
---
They will since you can kick members and re-add people. That was a crucial piece.
---
It's an interesting point, I think you're right. It's a big concern if it's the case.
---
Here we see the rare creature spergicus maximus. While originally a bipedal creature evolution has required it to resort to a state similar to its sister species of the same genus, gorillas. The creature walks on all 4, and strangely enough it’s right arm is nearly two times the size of its left. Marvelous really.
---
It's not a raid, it's a group boss, one that osrs desperately needed.
---
It better be rainbow
---
Well you spammed “I am sorry” 50 times, that doesn’t seem very genuine. And the big apology you gave was more of you just trying to say “I’m sorry you didn’t like my comments, here are the reasons you shouldn’t be mad at me, please don’t dislike me” but with an apology mask on. 
---
I mean you clearly didn’t read any of my comment, or at least you only paid attention to the parts you wanted to. Like you hope your fans pay attention to the “I’m sorry” part and not the half dozens of excuses while saying no excuses. 
---
If you’re trying to be someone in the public eye, and you’re still going to do shit that’s going to upset people, learn how to fucking apologize. Don’t just say “I’m sorry” and hope you don’t lose subs and viewers. 
---
But I’m sure it’s not your fault somehow. Were you hungover when you made your shit apology? No excuses but it was a rough night?
---
I dont understand why its coming from a pickpocket seems a bit op
---
I feel ya brother
---
Mummies and ancient stuff centered in an old forgotten pyramid isn't spooky?
---
PVP got thoughts and prayers.
---
Why would you do that though? If you manage to get best in slot items why all of a sudden make a new account lol?
---
You can only join groups as a fresh group ironman.  If you get kicked, you're effectively in a 1 man group and need to recruit new fresh ironmen to expand your team
---
iirc that was the original effect that was polled with zenyte jewellery.
---
What do you mean, thats every iron Man helmet?
---
Yeah, I'm just interested to see how much longevity Group Iron would have for the average player. Anything that gives more streaming content and boosts interest in the game is a win in my book, but unless you've already got strong social ties in the game, I'm not sure how much appeal it has.
---
2020 kicks off with Morytania, i'd prob wager it to be same release time as SOTE
---
Maybe not the gigantic reveals as some expected, but almost every reveal here has been desired and talked about forever. Also exited to see whatever smaller content we'll get that was not mentioned, like revamping existing content, Zeah quests etc. Overall I'm excited for this.
---
Oh I never said I thought rendi was a bad person, like I said I still watch his series even though I heard the rumours. I was just saying that the fire cape wasn't a real comparison.
---
Sparc mac to inferno cape is a real comparison, but I don't watch sparc mac, so it wouldn't convince me as I don't really care about him, but for anyone who does like Sparc Mac that argument could certainly work.
---
They definitely should go with someone in-house next year. Someone who actually understands the game. Mod Gee did well speaking in the cooking thing this morning I think she’d have done far better at presenting than this woman
---
The game has been almost exclusively tailored towards solo players for the past 3-4 years. Having some actual group content for once is a fucking godsend
---
i don’t have access to that (that i know of). what would that do for my farming pet dupes anyway
---
You are this easily fooled by some PR back tracking lmao. Fuck Rendi the sore loser
---
Slepe &amp; darkmeyer are already on the map, but they're essentially devoid of any content currently. I think it makes a lot of sense to actually fill them out before moving on to other big black spots, instead of leaving a good chuck of morytania half finished.
---
Did you say M-m-m-m-MUMMIES?
---
Maybe the gear is group bound as opposed to account bound?
---
This is drama calendar content for sure
---
You trying to make them shit more?
---
"Imagine caring that much about the thing you spend hundreds of hours on" is it just me or is this the stupidest comment? 
---
Just cuz you don't care a lot about it doesn't mean he shouldn't.
---
A best-in-slot addition to the torture only requiring 60 Thieving? Surely that's not serious?
---
Aight good talk.
---
You have to respect the long con
---
I'm not too crazy about dedicating so much dev time for a mode that really only benefits content creators either
---
oh yea mixed it with runecrafting
---
I'd really rather Jagex focus on finishing existing expansions than start new ones. Waiting 10 years for a completion for the Morytania quests would suck.
---
I legitimately think this is the case. Not even meming.
---
I assumed the player kicked from the group had all the items in his inventory returned to the rest of the groups bank. They aren’t gonna release a broken game mode with super obvious exploits relax
---
I was expecting them to continue the Myreque questline, but I am surprised Morytania got such a heavy focus without another big content update elsewhere.
---
&gt;Create new essence that gives 50% more runecrafting xp
---
&gt;Gives it the same XP rate as existing methods anyway
---
This is getting monotonous. Why can't a higher rate be introduced if it takes multiple master quests and an untradeable resource to introduce?!?
---
inb4 Swampletics tribute in darkmeyer
---
Then it'll just end up like falador back in the day where people just trade shit without the ge anyway
---
black graceful!!!!
---
RWT on a new level
---
:D
---
Devalues my guthan locked ironman
---
I hate the desert so I don't mind this. Idk how much hate this may get me
---
Well your guess isnt any better than his
---
Plz add a crossbow shop, it's about time
---
One with 0 stock would be nice tbh
---
It's actually really sad. She asks a legitimate and cool question that everyone picks up on and discusses for a few minutes. Meanwhile the chat goes, "OMG she DOeS'Nt haVe a CLUE!!!11" She can't win with those people either way.
---
Small indie company /s
---
10HP*
---
Because literally every other good item worth having comes from PvM/Slayer. The game is more multi-faceted than that.
---
God wars and wildy bosses are not “mid level”, the fuck? 
---
On top of that, I don’t want my only decent option to be in deep wildy. No PvMer does.
---
Hmm I like this idea but how do you make it cover a wide enough area of content but also not making the interface too cluttered.
---
quest and wrapping up castle drakan would been enough
---
signed
---
50:49, 51:49  
---
Above is the timestamp on where that's mentioned. He states they must be a fresh group ironman
---
Great reveals tbh, all these things are great for the game.
---
I'm not saying "people will run this", I'm saying "I hope jagex doesn't balance the RC XP rates relative to the rates people can get with runners".
---
It seemed like they were planning space for other updates than just those mentioned, so hopefully, some of the smaller PvP stuff would fall in there. The Colosseum will likely come with Varlamore, or Menaphos if they move it; not sure if there are any other big PvP content they want to add for risk of splitting the community further.
---
As for making the Wildy feel more alive, I don't think they're really is a good way to do this. Add PvM content, Skilling content, or just strong content in general hasn't gone well in the past so just doing more of that would likely make the problem worse than better. I'd say the best approach is to revisit the content already there, like some of the Wildy Bosses, the Resource Area, and other things that are unpopular (i.e. not chins) or things that aren't working as intended (i.e. prayer altar); if what is there is more worthwhile, then players have more of a reason to go to the wilderness without cluttering up the wilderness with more things and hotspots.
---
Aside from that, it is just a matter of getting more players interested in Wilderness PvP, which likely won't be done through updates to the Wilderness itself. A good clan system is probably one of the better things they can do for this aside.
---
Possible to have a group bank account and a private one (kinda like raids chest) to make the sharing of items, resources 100x smoother?
---
Good
---
&gt; No, it couldn't. Because raids doesn't rely on the same group of players to be present every single time you want to raid. Raids are inclusive to any and all players, not restricted to just a few.
---
You're right, but if you're signing up for a group ironman mode account, then surprise, you're signing up for a group ironman commitment. It's almost as if it's the same commitment someone makes when they advertise they're looking for a raiding group. They want to raid-&gt; they're now committed to that certain team to raid. Group ironmen want to play group ironman -&gt; They're not committed to playing Group Ironman mode. 
---
&gt;I don't see how group ironman would bring new players to the game. I honestly don't. Only people already included in OSRS would know what group ironman is in context.
---
Yeah no, using that same ideology of "only current players would know what it is", then using your same logic Runescape never gained new players from OSRS release/ raids/ content creators/etc. Besides, only current players new what any of these things were.
---
Its also like "hey, jagex employees are paid too low!" - "hey!, membership prices are way too high!"
---
Welcome to the runescape community.
---
Swamp man bad?
---
Well getting Skilling pets by 99 range from 20-35% I think. So you're not likely to get it by 99
---
ah yes
---
The tweet has been down. Said there was no excuse. Apologized to him multiple times publicly on Twitter. Then went on here and apologized to 50 people. I am sorry that is not enough for you and I am sorry to everyone else I am not sure what else to say but that and whether you believe it or not I guess that is just up to you man.
---
Oh damn never thought of that. You can make a really good 10hp chin hunter killer without ruining stats getting items like gmaul or get a much easier rune cross
---
You only really need 55 farm for Noxifer. I think higher farming just gives you more herbs per seed so it's not really a big deal.
---
Herblore definitely helps. I was only like 80 herb when I started so could only make the standard overloads, not the strong ones but even they were fine. You get the stronger overloads from Muttadiles anyway and 1-2 is enough.
---
I'm not sure how much raids experience you have but the hardest part was learning Olm. I ended up just taking like 20 staminas and suiciding through to the end and suiciding Olm over and over while trying to learn how to run without taking damage, then started adding in doing damage.
---
For learning, an ACB or even dragon crossbow would be fine. DHCB you only use on the final head phase which is the easiest part anyway
---
If you haven't already, check out Woox's and Sync's solo guides as well. They're long but they have a shit load of useful info in them too
---
Dagon'hai resembles Ancestral and that's coming soon. That's a good sign.
---
What would a Grizzly chump actually look like? There is no way your average Grizzly is in fact a chump.
---
whos gonna be out there playing with people they dont know? and whos gonna wait as long as it takes for you actually get good drops?
---
and the easy workaround is track who gets what drop and give it to them if they get kicked. youll noticed that took 0 seconds to think of, because this is an easily solved (and probably unlikely to occur) problem
---
Anyone clip the rap?
---
It’s me in the picture. You can leave it up. 
---
-Source... Me
---
Gotta play it safe when players vote down stuff. This content will pass with stupidly high pass rates; only stuff that might fail is rewards from Morytania content.
---
They'll still add other content, that's just the big stuff to get hyped up now.
---
That is a bad apology
---
Im planning to grind out the chest and legs soon, any tips?
---
What do you mean? Now he can *FINALLY* play the game.
---
About group ironman
---
quite honestly I think this could be interesting concept for single player playing on 2 accounts simultaneously; microcontrol would add depth to simple rs mechanics, but without really deviating from time tested formula and spoiling it for others. I'm thinking less of clone wars style of play, and more sort of split-responsibilities between the accounts approach, so they're not often doing literally same thing at once. Ofcourse you could do that now, but there's sort of lack of purpose to play on two coequal (self imposed) trade restricted accounts, especially when playing main + moneymaker alt with off-ge bought stuff gives so much more faster progression in game.
---
Biggest drawback is probably pricing. With normal alts they can pay for themselves in bonds; not a case here. I'd hope Jagex at least brainstorms what, if any, special promos they could make for such use case.
---
You'd be surprised
---
hey i'm the gay in the picture ur cute wanna date lol
---
Farmed
---
Someone’s projecting
---
Was there an issue at previous RuneFests I didn't notice? Why did they feel the need to hire an outside event host?
---
Took ownership by blaming it on a drunken tirade? Cmon though..
---
Yeah, as proposed there will be a black market for group ironman starter kits within a month. 
---
I guess they could make it against the rules and start banning people for abuse, but people will always push the envelope as far as they can get away with.
---
Even if you couldn't take items with you, could could join a group; get fed 99 crafting then leave and go start your real group. 
---
It's harsh but I think the only rule that works is that the kicked player gets de-ironed, and just don't play the gamemode if you don't have people you trust to play with.
---
Ye thats why i bought some for 800k lol. They were below a mill its just facts.
---
That's odd, almost like it doesn't see the dfw as df protection. You don't need the shield if you use potion and protect mage. I killed 10k brutal black wearing a twisted buckler.
---
&gt;Your group can always increase in size (up to five players), but cannot decrease. We don't want players to gain an advantage with a bigger group and then move down to a more competitive bracket.
---
0.6 tick rate is way to integral to fuck with imo
---
What are the perma 0 stock shops? And what’s the point?
---
I think swampletics is overrated.
---
Which may be true but the unique will not drop to even the combined price of your very rare drops of Dragon knives and Thrownaxes lol.
---
Yep. They didn’t let us down. Still, we knew it was coming already but I wish they’d given us a release date. Oh well. All seemingly great updates coming.
---
Eh, not particularly you're basically just an ironman if your group members aren't online and I doubt anyone would've played it anyways that doesn't enjoy the ironman mode itself. Unless you group up with people who have a drastically different schedule then you, (at which point why did you group with them? that is your own fault), it shouldn't be that big of an issue.
---
Besides people have been begging for this content for years since ironman launched, it isn't that rare to see unofficial group ironmen running around either.
---
Stun and Alch at the same time with -63 magic bonus. About 175k exp/hr, and is very minimal cost.
---
I’d rather it attach to the bonecrusher necklace tbh
---
Group Ironman is gonna be huge on YT
---
Lord Drakan should be a repeatable boss with a harder version after the quest is complete (just like Vorkath).
---
 Ash is leaning more towards customer support, he even said it himself. Their Dev and ICU (anti cheating) budget has been reduced significantly only the last year alone.
---
Having a junior dev make some quests is probably easy for them, where a raid would require more resources and developers to my understanding.
---
Clans/Group ironman are basic features not content worthy in this presentation.
---
this arouses me
---
from huge runescape lurer who laughed at peoples misery to someone everyone loves apparently. the power of social media (streaming) and the power of deception for $$$.
---
the luring was a hobby and then when streaming became a thing he just saw it as an opportunity to put on an act and be a "nice guy". Deception is quite the powerful tool when you want something.
---
I think everyone liked them, we were just hoping for other stuff.
---
Should have just made Ash the host.
---
Edit: BTW btw
---
What were the announcements for both RS3 and OSRS?
---
this would make me quit for good
---
Had a beaver. Lost it. Regret not getting insurance.
---
Just sounds to me like you dont really like the game. Yes i enjoy questing, yes i enjoy the early stages where the smallest things can unlock something massive and gamechanging for your account, its exciting. The point where the game gets boring for me, is the midgame right before you reach endgame, where all you have to do is grind for 100s of hours with no real changes till you get that big unlock you're missing, THAT is boring. 
---
I have both a main and an ironman near max, and i can definitely say that the game is alot more fun early game than endgame. You can only do raids so many times before it becomes boring, quests you can only do once per account.
---
TBH the same could be said for a follow-the-sun type of group as well. That way when your not online, there is still progress being made.
---
A new boss is kinda a big deal. The problem is they didn't mention any rewards so it is kinda meh at the moment, but it will probably be great on release. It also did suggest it would come with a quest. Darkmeyer doesn't seem to be that big of an update though, at least compared to Prif. So if the new Slepe Boss is 2020's Kebos and Darkmeyer is 2020's Prif, it does seem like lesser updates when you compare them like that. But overall I'd still expect 2020 to be a good year.
---
As for RS3, don't let the shiny updates distract you from the big MTX whooblah that is still going on. The new skill looks interesting, if a bit OP like you'd expect from RS3. More Player Owned Farms with 120 Farming and Herblore is a bit eh and the new quest didn't give a lot of info besides "we're continuing our recent storyline". Still a bit more content than OSRS's keynote, but probably not as big as it might seem.
---
lol repolling the original torture effect i see
---
I think a lot of people are forgetting about the new game mode that's basically dmm 2: ironman edition 
---
that's going to be fucking huge as well
---
well you got cooler updates and don't have to worry about them having to pass a poll. on the other hand its rs3 and rs3 is pay to win so idk
---
Yea you come out as a douche. Especially when you just won. I know you feel like you got clout and think you got shit to say an and you feeling good. But dont let it get to your head.
---
I would've liked it too but I agree with them finishing up morytania first tbh, I'd rather a zone that feels complete than 2 zones that really don't feel useful.
---
I mean yeah that's cool and all but all I'm saying is they should focus on the main game a little more rather than create 10 different game modes. We've already got the main game, 3 types of ironman, had deadman, king of the skill etc, now we're getting two more. It all feels like it's streamer orientated content, which I guess helps get the game out there but it is a bit bland for the average player who just plays mainscape.
---
Darkmeyer with an agility minigame and a group boss seem a bit bare boned to cover an entire years worth of content. I'm also a bit bored of Morty, like raids 2 wasn't that long ago.
---
I think, If you get kicked you have to recruit new fresh players to your party. You cant join others
---
Our biggest reveal was shit though
---
They actually said that? lol
---
I was whelmed as well but considering that you didn't put a crap ton of stuff on your plate. I really think this upcoming content you guys announced is gonna be bloody top quality. So now I am really excited about the new Agility Training method and the Morytania expansion. 
---
Between OSRS Leagues and  Morytania expansion, I think 2020 is going to be an amazing year in terms of content.
---
Honestly, I hold RC and Agility in the same regard.
---
I sorta like Agility more though, idk why
---
Am I the only one that thinks if jagex were to completely restart an Rs3 server, where everyone had a fresh account, and anything MTX related (and whatever else we think is BS in the game) was deleted, the game would do well?
---
He was upset and drunk and made a bad decision. he wasn't blaming it on that though and he had taken responsibility and apologised. You can't ask for more really
---
well that was just pure luck on the wyrms. and that is exactly what you need on the basilisks if you want to profit from them at all it seems
---
What was so amazing?
---
Schrodinger's content
---
Well deserved. Grats!
---
I also struggled with barrows tunels kc. Above works but sometimes yù
---
Skiller means both things actually. I can see why Gambit got confused here.
---
&gt;whos gonna be out there playing with people they dont know?
---
nobody? you would be just selling them the items and then leaving so they can invite someone whos gonna play with you
---
&gt;and the easy workaround is track who gets what drop and give it to them if they get kicked. youll noticed that took 0 seconds to think of, because this is an easily solved (and probably unlikely to occur) problem
---
holy fuck you cant be serious when you say that? easily???????
---
Because OSRS announce something then community Vote NO.
---
Can you imagine how much time they spend developing something and then for the community to vote against it.
---
This community want OSRS to stay OSRS therefore are very reluctant to vote in favour a lot of time. On top of that the player base is very diverse, players will Vote no just because they dont engage in that activity, rather than vote yes for the games development sometimes.
---
you must be joking lol. osrs is pretty much all solo. the game is SEVERELY lacking group content.
---
Okay but you join a group with people, get kicked out or leave. Then you join a fresh group of level 3s and boost the hell out of them giving all the gear and stuff they need? 
---
I think there needs to be some sort of average level requirement in joining a group
---
Game modes get polled buddy.
---
Ironman was polled, HCIM got polled, UIM got polled.
---
Special gameservers like your example don't get polled, wish again ironicly deadman mode got polled.
---
go lucky or go home i guess hehe.
---
You can’t leave the group, I guess you could drop it all 🤔 moral of the story don’t let ass holes in your groups
---
Eh. Doesn't matter when people are on. 5x the progress during the day is the same as 5x process night and day.
---
Edit: it would be good for viewership tho
---
Watch the video again and around 51:50, he says "...you can then recruit a new *fresh* group-ironman to your group. The person who was removed can do the same; they, obviously, have more slots to fill.". 
---
So it seems like the new recruits will be fresh level 3's and people who've been kicked cannot join other groups but, instead, will create their own group with fresh group-ironmen.
---
I bet the new group boss is gonna have a common rune crossbow drop.
---
There are a number of them. The Keldagrim crossbow shop, conveniently, has 0 stock for every crossbow bronze-rune.
---
Basically, the idea is that specialty shops buy items for more than you would get from selling them to the general store. However, in order to sell stuff to those shops, they need a placeholder for you to sell items into. Hence 0 stock.
---
Did sparc mac really win something? After all the scamming he’s done to his own community how is he still around?
---
I honestly think that Rendi deserved the award for best video. Killing Jad is one of the most iconic things in this game and Rendi achieved the goddamn record for lowest account to ever do that. He truly deserved the award.
---
Lil Smokey's video was very well done in terms of editing and such, but it was only popular because it could ride on the Swampletics hype train. Rendi has put down achievement after achievement.
---
The ore shop in the mining guild too
---
I mean that their announcements were B2B. ToB released around the summer of 2018 if I can remember, so obviously Jagex couldn't announce Raids 3 during Runefest 2018. However, it's Runefest 2019 now.
---
Right click &gt; trade &gt; offer gp &gt; accept &gt; accept again
---
It was pretty cool when you had cool people get your stuff for you and trade it back when you came back or they teled to Lumby and gave it back.
---
You can see them use it though!
---
I mean hes done taste of hope, So its not off the table
---
They're on a despawn timer if you log out, otherwise they stack.
---
They can make a league anywhere/any rules, fixing morytania has nothing to do with that.
---
\^ pretty much this.
---
As long as your stuck on the group ironman leaderboards then theres no harm I'm seeing
---
11 Mods worked on TOB according to the TOB update thread. 
---
Mod ED developed the last quest (exiles) together with Wolf in QA before he had to go.
---
Flying in clan leaders to talk about clans and content creators to talk selfies seems to be the focus atm.
---
Oh yes indeed Curtis, faux, mr mammal, boaty and the girl next to boaty
---
Damn, good point. Time to sink 4 bonds
---
It only won by riding on swampletics' coattails, 18fb fire cape is way more monumental
---
so remind me again why runecrafting xp/hr is locked at a method that you basically unlock at level 23? a Master level quest and 75 mining should be enough to unlock a faster way to train.
---
&gt; Aimed at small to large groups, this new group boss will have a similar play style to Corporeal Beast and be both challenging and accessible.
---
I hope it's not a boss you can teleport directly to, kill with a couple of monkfish, rejuv pool and repeat.
---
If you look at things like CoX, ToB, Gauntlet, Zulrah, Vorkath, etc. the problem I have is they bring a lot of resources into the game but don't really take much out. 
---
Back in the day, it was almost always better to gear up around staying at the boss as long as possible. Now it's more around basing your setup on maxing DPS, only taking a few food and doing 1-2 kills per trip.
---
Just trade with your friends...
---
indeed
---
I mean it says Runefest, I take that to mean the event itself
---
Worth.
---
If Jagex ever gets desktop GPU support up and running, they could work in a toggle to allow textures and ground blending, and then just assign a texture to each of their underlays and overlays for the ground (as someone who knows the cache, this is how they did it in 08). That alone would make OSRS look similar to the picture but with the OSRS characters/player models. Then if they really wanted to take it a step further in a way that would take time, they could assign textures to all models so that objects (such as the steps and statue for example) are more detailed when texturing is turned on.
---
I can dream.
---
I'm just here for the memes man 🤷‍♂️
---
Lol bruh you don't even know what you're talking about, I have a main and a baby pure I pk on quite often. Some people can enjoy more than one aspect of the game, shocker ik
---
Yeah I was thinking the same thing
---
in a group of 40 what's the damn point of ironman, just play a regular account cause that's a clan
---
i think you're missing the point of what it should be, not have a clan of 25 ironmen
---
You can see someone use it though 👀
---
Sell tbow buy other BIS
---
Want to “WOW” the players?? Tell Jagex to leave 3rd party clients alone &amp; let the game flourish as it has for the last 6 years. They’re literally going to suicide their own game for no reason..
---
Especially with Classic WoW around as a competitor, Jagex should really step up their game.
---
I wonder if you could get a bank wipe so you can join a group with similar total levels
---
It'll cost all of my points (i dont even have the amount to buy it right now) so I think id rather just buy it. Easier to get gp than slayer points
---
New maeter lul, new maeter for looting bots
---
ye the outfit next to him ain't bad either
---
I would say that
---
Don't worry, everyone screaming about group ironman will drown out the reasonable concerns about lack of actual content updates for the entirety of 2020...

To this day RuneScape bans the use of non-official clients. Do you really think that Classic, RS2, and RS3 have been bot free because of this rule?
---
I don't get why everyone points this out like it's a bad thing.
---
If you really Wana compete for highscores by alting on a bunch of different accounts then by all means go ahead if that's what you find fun.
---
Jagex gets more membership from you anyways so it's a win win.
---
Also if it was only duo group ironman I would definatly start one and alt it for myself. I'd have one ironman be the skillet, that feeds the one that does Slayer. Eventually I'll have over my extras to my alt and then that one can train combat.
---
Genuine question: Why?
---
E: I look forward to all the downvoters coming back 3 months after release complaining about their friends quitting.
---
It’s not a good excuse and the people saying it’s an explanation is wrong. The explanation is clearly how he really felt basically saying he did more under more stress. (Not agreeing or disagreeing with his statement)
---
&gt; PvM Achievement diaries
---
Any further info on this one?
---
Maybe read the rest of the comment...
---
Most of the toxicity around os ive seen has been here in the reddit lol. In game everyones either afk and silent or chatting about skilling or what have you, in my experience at least. I dont spend much time in pvp content though..
---
Sweet Baby Jesus, Mod Ash's voice is so crisp.
---
He's explaining what could have caused the emotions and "outburst." Some people get very emotional and outspoken when intoxicated. It's a perfectly good explanation.
---
Getting a host with 0 game knowledge is awkward for the host and awkward for the viewers. All she can do is make general comments that dont mean anything. Just absolute filler.
---
This is the most disappointing OSRS keynote in years.
---
I bought a tier 10 emblem (arpund 2m when i bought it) and bought the pouch and a bunch of whip mixes. After selling the whip mixes the pouch ended up only being 500k or so.
---
I appreciate your detailed response, and yeah, you're certainly right. Fuckin' English is a mess lol.
---
Lol if she’s a 2, I gotta live in your world then.
---
That is a good question... For another time.
---
Your right large pvm group pissed off rn They needed to announce raids 3. Rip
---
Garbage reveal, one quest and a clan system that should had been put in three years ago. Oh but no worries because we also are introducing group Ironman! Something that also should had been in the game two years ago. 
---
Waste of time, and I get why, this community hates any inkling of “massive content” as it could disturb their 500 hour grinds and make them a 475 hour grind. Sad :(
---
This makes me like him more
---
Do lavas and it’s 75k xp/hr. Meanwhile agility peaks at 64k or so.
---
Exiles aren't the best example. It was done largely on TAPP time and I doubt it was just those two without any artists. A quest like Sins of the Father will likely have a larger dev team. And likewise, a quest like SotE was just as big as ToB. So it isn't that quest themselves are easier; it is a matter of scale. A raid can be smaller than a quest, especially now that they built a lot of the systems for them, and quests arn't by nature small things.
---
Hmm, it’s like he only decides to apologize and blame alcohol when people are giving him shit for whining like a petulant child.
---
Don’t even know the dude but from this short little glimpse I’ve seen, I’m not wasting my time with his content.
---
I think the problem is rs3 was a bit more prepared. They had stuff to showcase. The engine work they have planned is huge too.
---
Yes a new boss is sort of a big deal - or could be. But as you mention they didn't tell is any ideas for rewards, and didn't have any idea how the boss would work.
---
I get they need to poll things, but with theatre of blood they pitched reward ideas and what type of bosses the raid would have - neither of which was even polled. Point is they had material prepared, where as this boss seems like it's just an idea with a name.
---
wahey sell your sgs and guthans boys
---
Pretty sure they are gonna work on DT2 regardless. It has been mentioned so many times, it sure caught their interest by now
---
He deleted the tweet 5 mins after making it. He made a mistake and owned up to it immediately.
---
I'll also be honest and say I agree with you it's not good for the game ;)
---
This is your brain on monolingual.
---
 [https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/osrs-reveals---morytania-expansion-clans-and-group-ironman?oldschool=1](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/osrs-reveals---morytania-expansion-clans-and-group-ironman?oldschool=1) to read the main three
---
That makes negative sense
---
So what would be the max amount of people in a group? Also what happens to that person's banked items? Does the acc just progress as normal IM or does the account's items go to the rest of the group automatically? So many questions, but I love the idea
---
Bit higher than that but you are right; I was mixing up Zenytes poll with their passive effect. I remember one of them was like right around 75%.
---
This is a good idea, a prayer book designed around the quest. Instead of the white from pre-eoc SS, it would be red for blood. The only thing is that they'd have to come up with an entire prayer book, which would mean a lot of potential that they'd make prayers everyone would be against. Maybe a normal prayer book unlock that as someone else mentioned, does damage every time the prayer is activated to make flicking it not effective.
---
Also why were the other two excluded? They could have given the bracelet the effect too and simply made it so that the effect only applies once even if you were the necklace/amulet and the bracelet so that ranged and magic aren't left out.
---
It's 2/3's as much time spent actually runecrafting, and then you spend the rest of the time afk mining. 
---
Even if it's slightly worse xp/hour overall I'd use that. 
---
It's also unclear if they mean "it won't be better than crafting nats", "it won't be better than ZMI", or "it won't be better than tick perfect lavas". There's space for this to be by far the best method for most people without it being better than lavas.
---
They could have paid any bigish streamer to do it. 
---
I assume they have some social skills and would at least have a lick of knowledge about what they are hosting.
---
Just having Ash on stage generates more hype than rs3 or anyone can compete with, so it's not really a fair comparison. Rs3 likes shauny but you're comparing a man to a god. And there's Settled too. Osrs memes harder and gets more hyped up.
---
“Boo hoo I put SOOOO much effort into my video and I was SICK &gt;:(!!!!”
---
Anyone who’s going to be a little bitch over something like this deserves no sympathy.
---
Personality is included in a rating. Theres nothing hot about talking up alcohol in a room full of gamers
---
Which is like 70% of their player base
---
You choose to limit yourself
---
He should have a scene in the video where someone comes to recruit the “legendary vampyre slayer Swampletics” to help the poor villagers in Draynor
---
He's right though they should be removed but only because jagex should improve their own client. It's pretty pathetic that they depend on 3rd party clients for basic things their own should be capable of doing.
---
Yeah but how often do iornmen go pking besides like two that are YouTubers?
---
The only thing they can benefit from is emblems, and the only thing useful they'd want with those is rune pouch. 
---
So yes you might see more ironman low level builds killing emblem farmers
---
Could you use that 2.5m for something more useful? All it really does is save 2 inventory spots. 
---
What places would you use it that those two spaces will *actually make a difference*?
---
Agility is a lot chiller because you're literally just clicking in circles, you're not going to the bank, withdraw essence, fill pouch, withdraw essence, run to ditch, hop over ditch, teleport to abyss, find the right path, go to altar, click altar, withdraw essence from pouch, click altar, teleport back to bank oh and don't forget to keep those glory charges up!
---
You've never used twitch before, that much is clear.
---
Is his shirt almost entirely covered in sweat or is just the lighting
---
It also gives the ectophial, which significantly boosts xp rates for some skills (such as smithing and fletching) in the early game.
---
🦀🦀11$🦀🦀
---
I dont think they consider runners when calculating xp rates. Those are a community created thing and definitely not a part of the norm for most accounts.
---
No he’s just trying to damage control because he doesn’t want people to think he’s a whiny child.
---
I think ash did actually
---
Dude just get the other pets instead of farming wtf lmao
---
And my axe!
---
yeah they expanded morytania because of swamp man, literally. 
---
That dudes been carrying OSRS for the last year. So they are making sure his videos will have content for a while. Raids 3 will most likely be in the desert. So its time will come.
---
Just do some zulrah I’m at like 300k essence banked
---
we have several people in “TheOSLounge” that love barbarian assault and are happy to help newcomers :)
---
You are delusional if you think 70% of the community is even close to being at a stage where they care about a 3rd raid.
---
Deep words
---
Couldn't disagree more. I realize we're on Reddit and criticizing a woman is a crime here, but it was a lot more "awkward" to listen to someone very drunk make terrible jokes, interrupt the mods, and generally be loud and obnoxious than it would have been to simply listen to the mods talk about the game and their plans, even if they had some awkward silence. I've seen awkward silence at RuneFests before, along with the half-assed applause, and general lack of social skills- and I'm telling you for a fact this was a hell of a lot worse. It really didn't look like she wanted to be there either, and I don't really blame her for that.
---
If they wanted someone for "energy" or hype, they could have just hired one (or two/three) of the several popular RS streamers that was at the event. I guarantee they would have been happy to do it, they have an existing relationship with the community, and they (obviously) actually play the game.
---
Yep i would absolutely just play it by myself if i had noone else to play with, which i fortunately do. 
---
I would most likely just do like you said, focus on 1 account while i do afk stuff on the other. Eventually getting them both to a point where i can dolo content like GWD, which is alot more fun than solos as far as i'm concerned.
---
What’s the gp/xp like?
---
Jagex is just reusing old dungeoneering items lol first hexhunter bow now blood necklace. when will we get an item with the ssh effect? It could have some interesting niche uses.
---
I think having an item with the effect would be interesting but it definitely shouldn't be an addition to tort and it should also probably be less accessible, either dropped by a new boss or a demiboss like demonics.
---
Yeah that's what I'm thinking too. Obviously there needs to be ways to kick inactive or troll players but someone high leveled starting a new group with low levels seems dumb but I guess that doesn't benefit the high level unless they couldnt find others. 
---
Also if you were a member of a 5 man group, if kicked out, can you only join/create other 5 man groups?
---
Wym?? All the female streamers that play are attractive and so are the ones that dont stream
---
I mean, wasn't settled being hecka mad that he put so much effort into a video and only got $40.00 from it in adsense in a very similar post? Rendi's original post seemed like an accept of defeat "man I had such high hopes i put all this effort in and still lost, will try harder next year". Swampman tried to joke with a bro who was down with what would've seemed like an off-hand joke to him  (five ear infections! he only has two ears!) but to someone who had just lost probably felt like a gloat.
---
tl;dr shut-ins who play a 2001 point and click being shut ins who would play a 2001 point and click.
---
It's a twitter rant about a videogame. I don't know why you're expecting them to have the decorum of a presidential address*.
---
*Pre-2017
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. Nobody uses justishit unless you're soloing with an alt or for whatever reason someone has a dedicated tank and want bis for it. Best for dps is literally range gear and a blowpipe. D hides are like 10k and a blowpipe is 4m.
---
So PvP in a weird meta way?
---
one day... i’ll show you. mark my words, DAD
---
The link doesnt show anything about Zeah quest and pvm diary, where can i see/hear more about that?
---
Thanks cutie
---
both
---
But rc doesn't make your account better in any way really.
---
Agility is useful because it gives you something that's always with you, better run energy restoration. A bit similar to combat skills or prayer.
---
In other news, choosing not to level skills in a game about leveling skills may restrict which content you have access to?  Say it ain't so.
---
Even if i were to agree the helmet is a good item, it should have came from a different source. The quest did not even involve the Neiznot warriors.
---
The quest is too brief/short to be Master tier.
---
Nah, classic wow fizzled pretty quickly
---
Eh, i’ve experienced the community back in the day too for 6-7 years before osrs was a thing. (Bring back stealing creations btw) and it was never that bad back then either, it’s more or less the same where you can strike up a conversation with anyone and make friends. I’d like to think with my massive amounts of play time i’ve experienced a lot of the community.
---
Worlds are not 100% in sync ticks even move at different speeds between worlds... To verify that you're not out of sync and thus duping items is not super trivial idk why all these non developers just decide stuff is easy without looking at the greater implications. We can all sit here and back seat dev but honestly this problem isn't as easy as copying some code from raids 1.
---
you being here contradicts that statement.
---
I go on it daily. Mind telling me exactly why you think I don’t though so I can tell you why you’re the one who hasn’t ever used twitch?
---
Brimhaven course is a lot about clicks though
---
I wish you were more like your brother..
---
You're just stupid if you think there's any chance at all they balance it with runners rates lmfao get real
---
What a let down. No raids 3 or exciting content. Just another game mode for streamers. And a morytania expansion to cater to one specific account. Won’t be renewing membership anytime soon. 
---
Only promising thing is the nightmare, which rewards aren’t even proposed of yet and likely won’t pass due to the amount of power creep we have already. 
---
Clan system is 3 years over due. Shouldn’t be considered one of your big 3 updates, considering that most of it dwells from the engine team. Not the devs.
---
i think you damaged my iq with that sentence
---
Black "graceful" not appropriate art style about to nope outta this game hard.
---
Have you tried waiting a bit?
---
Speculated to be related to morytiana expansion.
---
Yeah you have to get to Zeah/finish the Mory quests to raid, and you have to do Death Plateau to get to Godwars. But that's not what makes that Pvm challenging or exclusive, is it? The jaw update was some of the most uninspired and short sighted development I've seen from Jagex. A new BiS helm was basically the last upgrade Jagex had that didn't have to be a crazy niche item and they completely dropped the ball.
---
95 herb, 75 rc. I'm stupid for not doing it earlier
---
baby hits
---
AFK doesn't mean the whole process is afk. If most of the time spent is afk, then it's considered afk. Like woodcutting and fishing is afk, even though you have to sometimes drop/bank your inventory.
---
I agree, it would give the Fury a much more desirable niche as a tanking amulet
---
Yeah but even more Afk
---
The whole point of it was for more accounts to buy membs. Won’t last long term
---
Normal account would get combat xp for killing the chin hunters. Giving it an unofficial expiration date after so many kills or failed kills.
---
ALCOHOLISM
---
Wrong
---
the only endgame content that can't be done solo by most people is tob...inferno is solo, solo raids 1 is better pts/hr than teams (worse than scaled but altscape is its own can of worms)
---
I mean I would too for all those juicy internet points.
---
C H E S T B R A H
---
No its not it's trying to add an Afk method to train rc
---
Its nothing abot collecting the ess
---
The activity you're spending 2/3 less time runecrafting, instead you're Afk mining.
---
The casual player doesn’t have all day to sit there &amp; learn content like live streamers. I value your opinion I just think it’s a bad call on Jagexs part. I can agree that some of the plugins are a bit op but there will be a lot less bossing going on when they go away, leading to boredom of the game &amp; unsubscribing. Inb4 membs goes up to $15
---
Settled - "Heavy Breathing"
---
It has been like 2 hours now. I thought I’d instantly receive it?
---
Doesn’t have any interesting pictures
---
You get it by doing the new agilty minigame that will take place in Morytania
---
I would prefer the Blood Shard to consume your torture and degrade like a tent whip. That's the only way I would vote yes I think.
---
I'm just gonna make a duo-locked team with a friend. Managing 5 people and making sure everyone is pulling their weight is hard, but it's ez'ier for duo.
---
But if you're not someone who earns money from OSRS and you plan to alt multiple irons on your GIM, you have issues and i'm sorry for you.
---
Scythe
---
He's (as well as a bunch of others are) upset that Sparc Mac won a golden gnome that he wanted Sick Nerd to win. Sparc even got booed which i honestly hated watching, yeah the dude you wanted to win didn't win, but Sparc didn't do anything to deserve that kind of negativity
---
aye just realized that right as I replied, edited it
---
No, they shoulda hired someone with knowledge of the game. Any of the big streamers woulda been fine, they're good at that kind of thing.
---
Really disappointing tbh I don’t think GIM is as good for an average player as people think... you’re gonna have to start another account AGAIN, but your progress will be accelerated a little. That’s it. Streamers are always promoting it since it just gives them an easy year or two of content to provide and maybe that’s twisting peoples opinions. 
---
The only new PvM for the entire next year is ONE group boss? And it’s in a similar location to last years Raids. A raid in itself is essentially 5 group bosses...
---
I didn’t get to watch the event, does anyone have a clip that sums this post up?
---
&gt;drinks are on me
---
Maybe he should lay off for a bit
---
Slayer bad?
---
Ironmen can remove their ironman status so I assume these can too
---
Yeah a lot of player base went to classic wow as well I imagine the numbers have definitely dropped over the past few months.
---
I think it's pretty clear by now that they don't give a crap about PVP unless it's to use DMM to attract players. I would just play another game tbh, I have.
---
Or if you die you're out of the group but a fresh account can join
---
I personally wouldn't consider that afk. I just consider that very low effort. Afk is something where you can leave the window for a bit. If you have to constantly keep clicking, it would only be afk if you did it on a different device, or autoclicked.
---
Cheers mate
---
Dag queens leak
---
Perhaps
---
90% of the game is solo play, 10% being end game pve, group pking and minigames. Sounds pretty lacking to me
---
This game is based on what players want. It's not "pandering" if Jagex is giving the majority of players what they want?
---
Besides, Morytania is unfinished, just like Menaphos is.
---
Make reward a new range weapon better than a rune c bow
---
I mean it doesn't, you're still an iron, you can still do everything a normal iron can do, you just have the option of doing multi content like corp, wildy bosses etc if you want to
---
Secret GP sink? monkaS
---
- Arguably one of the best candidates for Best OSRS Streamer &amp; ended up losing again but to Sparc Mac.
---
- Husky spent a small segment of the GIM talking about practically every IM streamer there besides Sick Nerd, even using B0aty as an example for HCIM content despite Sick Nerd completing GWD/ToB on stream &amp; having the best HCIM by a large margin.
---
hell yeah. Too bad people are still gonna continue to harass and drag even after the two have moved on cause of how drama addicted everyone is.
---
I've been watching a guy named [ExtremeEzio](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8wjcvXxiCpyLRtBDp_WN7A/featured) which does exactly this. Not well known but makes great content regardless. 
---
Anyway, the desert is one of the last major regions which lacks proper end-game content, I can't even remember if it has gotten any significant content updates at all in OSRS?
---
except osrs will 100% get every update that was revealed. 50/50% shot with rs3 most of it will likely get shelved
---
This guy to the right is a disgusting streamer, biggieonjob called basically all the popular streamers ugly, like sick nerd and boaty and many others, just sitting there like he is a king and stuff
---
For selling, basically means the shop buys that item. And theoretically if people more regularly sold to shops, mains would see those items in stock because other players supplied them.
---
Juat slash, thats why its shit, like most of the stuff is weak to stab, wheres as slash is bandos and tob (verzik only lol, others are weak to stab)
---
I feel like anything that doesn’t surpass lavas is fine, that’s a high effort high reward method. I’d be fine with something around 50-55k/hr from this
---
pretty undewhelming for a player like me. the new quest is cool, boss I'll never do even once, clans I've never been a part of and group ironman I was never interested in.
---
just a quest for the entire year for me it is
---
dengiS
---
It sounds like you’re just really burned out on the game. Maybe take a break and try something else because this game isn’t meeting your desires anymore. Find something that makes you happy instead.
---
I, for one, am happy with today’s new announcements. There doesn’t always need to be insanely big additions and the focuses seem to be on addressing and updating what we currently have with some new additions. 
---
I do wish that more quests would be added like RS3.
---
Progress is only accelerated if you're already an iron man, and assuming you whole group puts the same amount of effort.
---
I have feeling this will be like partner slayer. People wanted it, we got it. Then ppl realized it wasn't as effecient or fun as they thought
---
Yeah but night/day you can multi-log 2 accs each on alternating 12 hr schedules for both accs 24/7
---
This is a great argument for player choice for countless areas and aspects of the game, but don't give me that shit for Bandos. You know as well as I do that it's the only viable melee armor. That's just how it is. As for how it looks, that's personal opinion. I don't hate that it's in the game, but I dislike how it fits into the medieval fantasy theme. To me it looks out of place. Justiciar does a great job have having medieval looks that match its tier. The design was wasted on that armor though because no str bonus.
---
But no one likes the desert
---
And people wonder why the RS community isn't taken seriously..
---
Except that if the clan system update is good and players use it to its fullest ability it will make osrs feel like more of an MMO and that community feel and companionship is what mmorpgs should be all about which imo would breathe even more life into the game.
---
Why would twitch ban the words MTX and Swampletics? Are they racist? Hateful? No. Those words don't break the TOS, and thusly twitch wouldn't ban people for using them. This is Jagex, I can't tell if you're a troll or really this ignorant
---
I agree, you gotta be able to joke and banter about stuff
---
At least you didn't lose your hardcore status.
---
I have half your kc with 1/8 the loot you've made without pet.
---
No friends to play with? Unlucky bud
---
I feel like mobile was announced around March/April of 2017 but was delayed a year
---
Its all about being self sufficient. There is still no GE which means that a lot of items still have to be achieved through the same methods. The satisfaction is the same but this time you do it in a more social setting with friends. I would personally say it is the best of both worlds.
---
Lol who's being the sore baby here?
---
Use your diary lamps on it and do tears of guthix - I am mid 60s and I have never crafted a rune.
---
You're very right. I haven't played for 4 months or so simply because there wasn't anything that I haven't done yet outside of maxing.. which I don't care for at all. I'm happy with my base 80's. But I was really hoping there would be something huge to look out for like raids III or some cool bossing update that would spark an interest to come back at some point. It's just a bummer to not have that.
---
You no lucky Jal-Yt
---
#DARK GRACEFUL!!!!
---
So they don't play regular runescape.. but will play when there's a group ironman mode?
---
15 times IS way highter when talking with such low rates for skilling pets, it drasticaly increase the rates.
---
I'd rather they took the time and didn't half-arse the content before moving on though. Look what happened with Zeah.
---
Besides, the desert expansion will likely involve the next Raid and we aren't due that yet anyway.
---
Nah. It couldn't work with aoe spells since then you would make blood spells worthless and it would barely ever be used otherwise.
---
Like morning dew on a spring morning

Tanzoo and Virtoso r super obnoxious and not very knowledgeable about the game

A little on the nose there, Jagex.
---
So much cooler than justiciar. Buckles &amp; check patterns ftw
---
First 200m alls, cheap gear ToB solos, low combat infernals like you say, and there's more like sick nerd finishing ToB on a hardcore. All of those are more impressive imo, and are actually relevant content. Cheesing 15 year old content shouldn't make anyone so arrogant that they start Twitter spats because they didn't win a fan voted award.
---
That being said, I actually voted for Rendi, I just don't like the arrogance around him essentially implying he should definitely have won it. He lost me as a fan, I'll probably watch his content still, but I don't like him anymore.
---
Sometimes it's delayed and sending multiple requests will invalidate previous links.
---
Convert mole parts to nest then sell seeds for even more cash money
---
I don't understand why everyone has it in their heads that osrs is for sure getting a menaphos expansion and they're just putting it off. 
---
Why do you think it's ever going to happen? Just cuz rs3 did?? They already have darkmeyer, was that guaranteed to come to osrs as well?
---
Well i guess this definitely isn’t the last season of swamp man. New season for the new boss likely.

There's my Groot, you stole him dick

Burnout is really intense on this game for lots of people.
---
I have to say i was surprised that Morytania would receive another focus update, but i guess it has to do with Swampletic.
---
Very confused about the group ironman size leaving system. At first says "We don't want players to gain an advantage with a bigger group and then move down to a more competitive bracket."
---
Then says "The group leader will have the power to initiate a vote to remove someone from the group. If you are removed from the group you will remain a Group Ironman but will have to recruit more members to your own newly-formed group."
---
So you can just leave and join up with other ironmen who have also been kicked? Wouldn't that be the definition of "We don't want players to gain an advantage with a bigger group and then move down to a more competitive bracket."
---
I dont know. Worst runefest reveals to date.
---
Could swear I've seen at least 5 other posts of people doing this, it's crazy
---
How is settled wrong? He called a guy out who's ego was so big he thought he should have won no matter what even tho his content wasn't objectively better.  Being a sore loser is pathetic.

I think it’s 2gp/xp which is really good compared to crafting methods
---
I get some of your points but a lot of those probably won’t change. Especially the ones that sell for tons of the ge like the prayer unlocks, players wouldn’t sign off on the changes.
---
This also occurs when you’ve played on pc while between mobile sessions, you’ll get an xp drop on mobile of whatever you earned while on pc!
---
I think we should talk about the fact that a graceful recolour was a Runefest announcement :/
---
A pyramid plunder style raid where you can go to deeper more complex rooms depending on the number of people you have would be sick! Would force something in the game to truly be group content.
---
Thank you for that beautiful picture
---
??? I love the game and would never make multiple accounts to actually play on. I don't see why you would want to go through the exact same grind, doing the exact same quests and content unless you were a content creator. It's not like other MMOs where you can pick a different class and go down a different path. If you want to restrict yourself you can do so on your current main account. No need to create a whole new account for it.
---
You're saying that as if its the only possible outcome yet the only thing we've seen are a handful of fundamentally flawed skills. As time goes on I only see it more likely, because the identity of osrs is always shifting and people get more eager for new skills.
---
Cant wait for winter 2017.
---
He wears a man-bag his opinion is invalid
---
*Meet Sand &amp; Field, my desert locked UIM.*
---
Big true, they cater to content creators.
---
What? They talked about how the player ID system that they are making for clans could be used for group ironman. It's not entirely different at all. Did you even watch the stream?
---
The profit is alright, but not great considering the time there. You could instead lose some gp doing lavas, then with the time saved go do zulrah/vorkath/raids or whatever and make way more gp. But if you just want to afk and get rc gains then ye do zeah, but I would say do it for the profit.
---
Yall missed the humor tag ☺️
---
In large volume you make money doing it, rewarded for the extra effort of opening all the nests
---
With a small quantity though it is a gamble
---
Imagine difficult combat-based content requiring high combat stats. Pretty stupid right
---
I really hope the sequel to desert treasure isn’t called desert treasure 2
---
I mean... and presumably more leagues after Twisted, and PvM diaries, and a new boss, and two new quests, and a new area with a new agility training method, plus the fact that they explicitly mentioned in the broadcast that this is not the entire selection of 2020 content since they want to leave room for new ideas that come up and not have the whole year completely blocked out. Is all that not actual content?
---
I fail to see how the addition of two long-requested features plus all of the above plus presumably some other bits and pieces equates to no actual content updates in 2020. What, exactly, constitutes content for you if not bosses, quests, new game modes/activities, and new regions? Just seems like the communities typical whining.

But then you would never learn

I understand that some people hate 3rd party clients because they can be used to make the game easier; however using the vanilla client is a massive inconvenience. All I want is the ability to make the screen fixed size however being able to stretch it. I don't wanna be dragging my mouse half way along my desk to get to the other side of my monitor, I want to be able to check quickly XP Rates, Recent Drops, Task Counter, What valuable items drop, Timers without opening 30 programs. It's a game not a spreadsheet.
---
Botted ass stats lmao
---
This wouldn't pass a poll.
---
Hey it's only twice as many tears as you've gotten already!
---
Any advice you can give? I am literally trying to get 99 agility ONLY so i never have to worry about it again (i know it doesn’t make sense but having a goal like that helps me stay interested). The burnout of that aids ass skill makes me sick even thinking of the game.
---
Yeah nice 15 minute grind
---
Take all the expensive shit and never log on again.
---
Same thing.
---
Yeah that's too much technical complexity. You have to sync up server requests and handle race conditions among other things. It's too much of a hassle for not enough of a reward in usability.
---
Why are people so disappointed? This game already gets updated way too quickly, I'm pretty happy with what was shown.
---
Yeah I can see that. I do miss the turmoil pure build and I would definitely make one if they release the curses for OSRS. I think pking is pretty much at the bottom of the barrel right now so anything won't hurt it at this point.
---
If anything good about agility wasn’t locked behind diaries i would agree.
---
B0aty really gives me major twink vibe. God i wish he would come out of the closet already!
---
Although RedEye hosting dota events is pretty smooth, I don't think Day9 did poorly at all. Few hang ups here and there but that's to be expected. I think RedEye just really fits the atmosphere a bit better.
---
Gratz! Was nice to finally meet you in person!
---
It’s coming from a new agility gauntlet mini game.
---
What happens when you de-iron as a group ironman?
---
Settled wasn't being a jerk in any capacity. He made a joke that Rendi inexplicably took as a personal attack and then defended smokey when Rendi took an unwarranted shot at him.
---
he's really big lol
---
Why not finish the desert first before expanding other places.
---
Isnt that basically the yearly deadman tourney?
---
KFC
---
Long story short rendi was upset he didn't win a golden gnome and went to Twitter to complain about it. Settled then commented and told him to stop complaining and to be a gracious loser pretty much. It is nothing big they are not even mad at one another. Just some stupid Twitter shit.
---
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
Must suck not having friends?
---
Jimmy looks like Baker Mayfield
---
Pretty disappointed swamp man’s territory is getting the majority of the attention here. Yes , I do think that these are great ideas for this region. Although the desert has been neglected severely over the years. Maybe 2021...?
---
Ty beep boop
---
Fuck dessert, hate it personally. Just don't like it's theme but that's just me
---
Well good luck to the PKers having any sort of sway in a poll.
---
Grats! Charge your phone!
---
Yeah, the more you try the more likely you are to get whatever it is but each attempt has the same chance of getting it, its just the more attempts there are the higher chance that one of those attempts will be the lucky one to do it.
---
I think she did a good job given the situation. The decision to have a host who doesn't know anything about the game seems a little strange though.
---
Group Iron brings in more account subs.
---
And that's all they really give a shit about.
---
Same reason twitch chat was spamming in their excitement during the announcement, a large portion of the playerbase has requested it and therefore it's something Jagex wants to work on
---
I saw all of that. Thought I must have missed something else because, in context, this joke makes no sense. 😂
---
Then it would be dead content like the dragonbone necklace
---
Her: ‘ALCOHOL FUNNY HAHAHAH’
---
group is prob over a year out due to jagex having to do the clan rework before releasing it
---
