It was a joke man. Guess I should use /s.

I mean people have fun luring pvm bosses in the wild and killing them without a challenge. Killing a player is faster and often better loot than a callisto kill
---
we need a grandmaster quest that explains the lore of the ancient machinery and we find out OSRS is not actually medieval high fantasy, but is really a post apocalyptic dystopia.
---
Is Tithe farm good? I've never tried it, im pretty new to OSRS, I played a lot os RS2, but my farming was like 20 back then.
---
An item / gold sink would do wonders for osrs.

To further elaborate, the easiest way to get into pking is using a pure build. Though, you‚Äôre free to look up pking builds and see which seems the most fun to you. I‚Äôd suggest creating a pking account once you‚Äôre able to fund it on your main.  You‚Äôll be losing money at first when you‚Äôre learning, so you want an account that can pay for that. 
---
As for your main account, the other person said it best: Max melee and get veng.

It corrupted my education too üòÇ that veteran cape got traded in for technical college ü§ò still living the best life though üòÅ

Well carbon comes from coal. When iron and coal are smelted together it forms the alloy steel, which is just iron with 1% carbon. The final product is a much tougher metal.

6 months seems like a long downward trend though. Do you think i should sell this thing or hold onto it? I dont really need the cash

Yes. You can spend 50 points to have your patches never grow back weeds after you rake it.

Depends what you use for, if your bank is like 100m. I would buy dhcb and vork for gp, items went up at the start of the year due to hydra.

That is fucking adorable. Get your barrows gloves dude it's an expensive grind.

Oh, so you get farming based rewards for playing it? I'll read the wiki page and try it.

Gold sink isn't really hard for Jagex to add more of, but item sinks are a bit trickier. I'm not fully on board with the whole Warding skill proposal they showed us, but the Dissolving part is interesting.

Did the dummies used to give unlimited exp?

Just safespot him in the tunnels

Omg lol

time to earn money for tassets then. bossing or slaying should be the way to go. You could also add a couple of ranarr runs a days too

The uniques are an extra item on top of the two loot rolls you get per kill

Yep, as someone who is a big Keanu fan, I have to agree that ur gey l0l

You can safespot him in a bunch of places, notably in any of the four corner rooms where the ladder would be. Even if the ladder is gone, the tile is impassable and you should be able to kill him with impunity. There are also spots in the long outer tunnels where you can catch him on some rubble.
---
What is the basis for this reasoning? I see different people saying different things. Some people say don't use DH until 80something hp, I've seen others say that it's not worth it until 90something, which is it, and what is the basis for this particular hp breakpoint?
---
Dont pretend you dont know why.

Oh, yeah I wouldn't worry about that much either haha it's a relatively simple mini-game and I actually quite enjoy it!

Can't kill Zulrah+ doesn't know how to make money = you've never attempted inferno. Inferno isn't cheap and it's definitely harder than Zulrah.

Definitely disagree with the other guy, Brimhaven/Port Sarim are the best spirit tree locations (POH doesn't count towards your total).
---
You'll never really use either that much though as they're not the best teleports available; Brimhaven redirection scroll is better to get to Brimhaven, rimmington/fairy ring is better for skeletal wyverns.

Demonic gorillas are 3m/h and require 69 slayer. Highest gp/h for a slayer monster, averaged over time.
---
Other guy is wrong, Hydra is only about 2m/h after factoring in uniques (little more with Tbow)
---
No worries man. The people downvoting really dont understand that what im saying.  You risk ether or the flail, but you almost never see pkers. And when you do see pkers, they're usually in garbage gear and by themselves. I've done hundreds of Vetion kills only seeing 2 trash pkers with d scim and rune c bow. They dont bring ags, claws, whip because they will lose it if they die. Also, you still keep your 3 items if you die unskulled.  If your at vetion in a normal world, you get jumped every 10-20 kill and have no chance of surviving
---
That's the whole point of the wilderness though, no one's forcing you
---
crabs will be more afk. sand, rock, ammonite are all in different places so you can take your pick
---
I disagree if you do enough kills to normalize your RNG gorillas are better than zulrah
---
that sounds like terrible design ... i do want to fight back (with a rune crossbow pr something while im frozen)  but i'm terrified of getting skull tricked..

Sand crabs until your attack and strength add up to 130 when combined so you can get a dragon defender which will boost your offensive melee bonuses.

Ive heard its a pain in the ass to get the dragon defender cause of the token system. I'm mobile only at the moment and have been doing pest control to get ranger void set and then I'm gonna do barb assault to get fighter torso.
---
all the same stats, if you plan on using god spells e.g. for pking then there's a difference but otherwise no
---
Dharock's set effect gives a +1% damage buff for every point of health you're missing. If you're using a rock cake you'll always be at 1 hp, so every additional hp level is +1% damage.
---
Could be annoying when i chuck in like 100k on some obscure item so i dont have to guess its price.
---
The point of the wilderness is to bait people with sub optimal pking gear and supplies into it so that people walking around in specialized gear, stats, and inventories can hunt them without them having the ability to fight back properly? Wow and here I was thinking the wilderness was simply there for people to fight each other. Not for it to create some sort of pseudo-ecosystem in which the mighty salad robed pker can hunt the galloping chaos alter bonelet or the search spade clue boys.
---
The servers r shit yagex fix them instead of releasing dead on arrival content
---
Defender is very important. Add it to your to-do lists. It's bis until you get an avernic defender one day.

Karambwans are unique in the sense that they have low requirements but a high level to stop burning. The level to stop burning is what matters most, and the gap in levels is more extreme than other foods. For example, you can start cooking sharks at level 80 and stop burning them at level 89. At level 80 you are already close to that guaranteed cook level. In your case, you are over 20 levels below the guaranteed cook level. Try cooking sharks as soon as you hit 80 cooking, half your inventory will be burnt, now put that in proportion to karambwans. Like I said, you just need to level up your cooking (and cook at the Hosidious range with cooking gauntlets)

This actually makes a lot of sense.  Someone makes a buy offer for a whip at 2.6m, someone else is selling for 2.5m, so 100k gets deleted and both get what they originally asked for.  No messing with prices or taking money from either player.
---
Complete collection log is virtually impossible given the length of a human life, lmao.
---
It was a bug with hosidius range. I went to rogues den and immediately it's normal. I get that I should be burning a lot bc their cooking req is weird, but I literally could not do anything but burn them on that range.
---
If you decide to do vasa yeah I guess. But you wanna prioritize range in there so you don't have to use your stab weapon as much

Have you tried talking to Oziach?

Don't most people stream with a capture card anyway?

I'm going to take a shot in the dark and guess how dmm became an esport.

Step 1. copy darkscape because players would probably enjoy it.

Step 2. B0aty gets an insane amount of viewers on twitch/youtube and new players start pouring in.
---
Step 3. Out of touch higher-ups tell the OS team to make it an esport.

Instead of solely focusing on endgame content and raids, the developers of this game add content to almost all levels of play. New areas, bosses, weapons and armor, you name it. When they do add new weapons and armour, specifically at higher levels they make sure not to make it so it renders whatever is second best to it completely useless which WoW has a horrible track record of doing. 
---
Runescape is a game for people who like long grinds, which classic wow has a bit of but nowhere to the extent of the monotonous grinds of runescape.
---
If you don't mind doing pretty boring, average things in the early game like woodcutting, mining or thieving where you literally just click on the same spot for hours and watch a larger number rise in tiny increments. Then this game is for you. If you're expecting to reach endgame in less than a few months, I only have to say to you: good luck.

u/GentleTractor is an OSRS player that contributed to re-designing Zeah (the location of this picture).

The tractor in the picture is a ‚Äúgentle tractor‚Äù placed in Zeah as an homage to this player. The joke is that OP said ‚Äúgentile‚Äù tractor, and gentile means a non-Jewish person.

The tractor in the picture is a ‚Äúgentle tractor‚Äù placed in Zeah as an homage to the player.

He's just messing with you. The truth is it varies. Some content isn't developed at all until it passes a poll while some content is so easy to implement that it can be pushed put within a week.

The 3rd age helm, platebody and platelegs models are property of Jagex and I in no way claim them to be of my make or ownership.
---
are there any good youtube progress series from around the release of the game in 2013?
---
 lol who cares Very low ban rate if any. Thousands of people do it. Some people maxed multiple skills doing it. Heck when I fish or wood cutting I can drop a inventory in 1.5 seconds lol
---
Seen you at raids bank

Gz on cape

Dibs. Ha gotcha jagex.

Incorporate elements of smithing, crafting, strength, firemaking, and magic. Everybody know engines run partly on magic.

It‚Äôs RSN you fucking casual

don't imagine this is OC but I legit giggled so good on yah.
---
I think keeping v skirt is more worth, that +1 str with not very good defence bonus. And v skirt give nice little prayer bonus aswell
---
Interesting. What changes did the developers make to OSRS that turned into modern runescape? Like what are the differences. Is it comparable to Classic WoW vs like Battle for Azeroth? I've see that modern runescape has 3d graphics.
---
You should have built it next to a swamp man. Otherwise looks great.
---
LOL so this is deff waay better money than infernal eels which would make about 85m from this same lvl
---
Because it goes off alch price not ge price
---
I‚Äôll build that swamp good...
---
Runescape questing are really, really, fantastic compared to WoW. Rather than a single overarching storyline that drives every action in an expansion, the Runescape world feels like a living world, full of people with their own individual problems, goals, and histories.
---
The grind
---
Does runelite work with these puzzles?  The last one I remember doing was the one to get the glider working in MM1 and runelite didnt provide any assistance at all.
---
You just outted yourself as someone who never pked before
---
Ah damn i was there with my squirrel just before that i guess i saw it when there were 7ish people
---
Are most of the best items drops from raids and dungeons, or are some player crafted? Also, what is the wilderness about and how does that relate to farming?
---
It‚Äôs weird being only 23 and seeing some people you went to high school getting married.
---
Why is there never lewd love for my girl Chaeldar tho
---
Awesome! That's kind of what I have gathered.
---
You can unlock auto-weed for all patches by buying it in tithe farm shop. From what I recall, auto-weed takes about 40 mins to unlock
---
Is that your password?  Gotcha thanks for the account kid.

I'm 23 too.. it's weird too young or having a kid!!
---
You a fellow Canadian there bud?
---
oof
---
If you end up liking barrows I recommend working towards morty hard diary for 50% more runes from the chest. Even if you go on a massive dry streak the runes will still be making you ok money. The reqs aren't too high, with boosts the highest non combat requirement is 66 agility, and all the rest are low-mid 50s.
---
I got 83 today and had no idea till now...
---
You think your so sly.. My goat runs around *red* fences thank you very much.

How do you get the classic 05/06 overlay?

The only thing that made the grind for farmer's outfit + auto-weed somewhat tolerable was the XP rates. That being said, I've been thinking about going back for the watering can but.. but.. I don't want to go back.. not again..

I am at 72 agility and have 99 hp should i take food with me to the werewolf agility course
---
You can only play mobile? Oof
---
So worth it. Haven't touched a rake in a long time.
---
Nah you should pray magic or ranged. It doesn‚Äôt really matter which since they both have 100% accuracy
---
Dharoks can crush
---
And with 99 herblore you can make boomer brews to grant bonus xp when using it.
---
If you had the knowledge that items wouldn't stop dropping for another 6 months what would you do?  At some point you just gotta take a step back and go "shit I actually need gear". Either it's a long way until the crashing stops, in which case you'll be waiting for months, or gear stats to stabilise in value and you lose nothing. Consider both scenarios, at the end of the day isn't it just with buying the gear and keeping it?
---
From op‚Äôs house obviously /s
---
No sir

Tell me about it, lmao. Just 60 cmb stats was a gigantic pain in my ass.
---
Why not 3rd age grieves
---
Yes. Mlm is pretty awful

Where would you recommend doing them??

You should take an inventory of summer pies and stam pots as it will affect xprates.

Don't forget to leave an inventory slot open for the stick, and you need an empty helm slot

especially since we're basically playing efficiencyscape now, of course I'm going to get my ma2 cape, which is locked behind the wilderness. Jagex needs to realise forcing pvmers into the wilderness won't revive it, and definitely shouldn't lock a bis item behind it
---
I think it could be a ploy to bring attention to the client so it is banned by Jagex
---
Cmon bro mobile exists. I did all my f2p on that. And I do my p2p stuff on a chromebook running the android apk from my galaxy note (works great just need a bluetooth mouse)

Rare drop table is 1/15 from the mystery box. And then shield left half is 1/4096 from the rare drop table. So that effective chance of getting a shield left half from the mystery box is   1/61440. May be the peak of your rng lol
---
Ask, ‚Äúwc lvls?‚Äù
---
I think its more of a demonstration than anything. Its pretty shocking to me that not only did every single one of these bots make it off tutorial island, but they made it all the way to the GE to amass like this. 
---
It just makes it abundantly clear that jagex is unable to handle a bot army that‚Äôs literally right in there face. If they can get this many bots off tutorial island what else are they doing with them?
---
Boaty‚Äôs one man army

Hahaha good to see you doing well! Congrats CJ! -Chase

The Zulrah script that's out there allows for mage only I believe, and not because they couldn't code in range lol
---
Our corporate overlords love bots.  They pay for memberships.
---
ardy cloak has prayer bonus and mage atk bonus. imbued god capes are definitely better but i don't think OP has 75 mage if he is mentioning iban staff
---
Maybe one of those double exp scams?
---
BiS for the nearly-extinct breed of defence pures who can‚Äôt use slayer staff because of the mage requirement
---
The wild is uber dead though. I stocked up on capes recently and did like 13 Sara capes at 50 wild east of the obelisk and ran into literally only clue hunters headed to the volcano. There‚Äôs no real risk and ma2 capes can be obtained using less than 100k risk if you use recoils, even less if you use a veng alt. 
---
If 100k loss is enough to be considered ‚Äúrisk‚Äù then you probably aren‚Äôt at a stage where MA2 cape is good for you yet anyway.
---
Do you have a need for the watering can? If not, I wouldn't recommend getting it. The big uses would be turning seeds to saplings or... Tithe Farm. If you don't really do either of those, is it even worth getting? =/
---
Heh, yeah, right guys? Isn't Jad so easy? What? Oh, no I just like how my legends cape looks better, that's all. My fire cape is in the bank though definitely.
---
I've done the content, but when pvmers that want their cape have to go all across the wildy and through multi to get it and inevitably get pk'd, it creates the divide between pvmers and pkers. I'm just sure there's better ways to revive the wildy then forcing pvmers to go in it
---
Pkers also wonder why pking is on the verge of death. ‚Äú don‚Äôt like the wild don‚Äôt go in it‚Äù 
---
Okay I won‚Äôt. ‚Äú omg why is the wilderness dying ‚Äú

Why? Because some bots decide to spam about it? People don't like on the internet!

Actually, it's not.
---
According to an older thread, Runelite plus downloads a small amount of microcode every time it's run. This isn't visible in the source, and isn't in any of the JARs. 
---
This code could be absolutely anything, and there is no easy way of knowing exactly what it is. It could also be changed at a moments notice.

Chances are the goal of this was to get people thinking this way. Not sure what you're on about with runelite notifications though.
---
Honestly I did it for the the memes. I know it's highly unlikely that they will sky rocket in price.
---
If you want a single kc for the diary task, I would recommend the flinching method. Should be plenty of youtube guides, very low risk of death.
---
Anyone remember the Hand Cannon? And how it actually had that one mechanic where there was a chance for it to blow up during combat, with that chance increasing when you use it‚Äôs special attack? I remember dying a few times because my cannon blew up when I went to spec and it damaged me for a shit ton. I actually got 99 firemaking because of that damned weapon. Good times.
---
The Amish could put the construction industry out of business. They work like human ants lmao.

No

It is real, it's a fork of Runelite, but without all of the development/plugin restrictions Runelite put in place. It's also completely open source unlike normal Runelite.

I promise u no one gives a rats ass when this happens

Your mind is not ready may be code for ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt been to NMZ yet so you can‚Äôt teleport there‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know for sure.
---
I see sexist/racist/homophobic shit on the daily coming from white incels, and whenever I see anybody try to defend it they‚Äôre labeled as a ‚Äúwhite knight‚Äù.
---
While yes it was a joke, I was a bit too baked to understand that at the time (especially since he was downvoted previously). And while I don‚Äôt remember harshly insulting anyone, that wasn‚Äôt my objective.
---
So it's an invisible download done by code that doesn't exist, and no amount of evidence can be found? 
---
Nice.
---
We really would not be doing this to advertise the client. This is pathetic and impacts other players awfully.
---
To bait people? Theres a ditch with a mandatory warning that says you shouldnt risk anything you dont want to lose.
---
Dual arena is for fighting and only fighting. The wilderness is functioning exactly how its intended to since the beginning. Anything goes.
---
If you dint want to risk it, then just dont fucking go in the wilderness
---
Bot, bot name and they only do magic kills. There in every world. You can tell which ones are new because they will have 75-85 mage. Some are over 99 with 20m exp.
---
Should have done it on super flat world. If you do go on to the rest of RS you‚Äôre gonna be doing ALOT of terraforming.
---
Red spices are effectively useless since it's just combat boosting. The others have their uses, but I agree, orange seems to always be in short supply
---
Hi everyone, please help me with this.....when should i aim for a bond as f2p?   
---
Everytime i look for guides on f2p, everyone says "wtf you doing, try to escape F2P ASAP, just started? grind GP for bond", but i think that it would be a waste because i'd be more worried about getting the money for another bond instead of  doing quests and skilling which is the purpose of getting membs so i think that i would enter in a vicious circle.  
---
Please if someone can give me some tips or advices i'd REALLY REALLY REALLY appreciate it, because i swear i'm blank, i dont know what to do :(

Is there any real point of hosting a gilded altar? Are some people just good people?

Is that a sword or a window?

screw the rules I have money

the older you go, the more incomprehensible the writing.
---
I just saw your username, dope demons souls reference my dude.
---
How does it suck? It‚Äôs great if you‚Äôre doing melee on tasks. The only difference it makes when it‚Äôs imbued is give you bonuses on range and magic...
---
Yes, you are being unreasonable. You wanna take something so serious when it's clearly a joke. I know that you can't necessarily read the time something is written in, but if you don't have trouble with social skills irl, contextually it was pretty obviously a joke. You don't need to be so aggressive and ready to call people homophobes or racists or whatever the case may be for whatever situation, sometimes people make jokes, sometimes people don't get that they're jokes, and sometimes people are serious about hatred or discrimination, but the difference is the context, the language, and the self awareness or lack thereof; I understand discriminatory behavior getting under your skin, but for the most part in my experience, it's pretty easily discernable from "edgy" jokes. 
---
Basically what I'm saying is you should work on recognizing the difference in these behaviors if you truly care about calling out people who really are trying to put others down, hate, or act superior based on gender, identity, sexuality, or race.
---
Honestly not sure if he even plays anymore. Would love to reconnect with him. He was my best friend.
---
What‚Äôs BiS?
---
Yeah google prolly has the answer. Just been too lazy to type it myself.
---
I've spoken to a some ppl who got maxed combat through nmz/not slayer and they tell me they regret it because the skill feels significantly slower and they only have 50m bank. A good amount of these people also only do bandos for gp because they didn't do quests either so they can't kill money dragon for significantly better gp.
---
C'mon, for old times sake
---
Cyberpunk 2077
---
Yeah I guess if you expect it to get banned at any moment it‚Äôs probably best not to invest more time into it.
---
it‚Äôs because defense and defensive bonuses are kind of shit compared to str and str bonuses. Use a dps call if you don‚Äôt believe me
---
Best in Slot. The best item you can have in a slot at your current level.
---
This is crazy..
---
Efficient for XP? Sure, but burning out after a month because you've removed all incentive to play the game isn't very fun. Training combat with slayer is half of the fun.
---
Huh. Pm me a link to whatever guide you used? Super interested.
---
"Nice" always follows a pattern of up-down in this sub.
---
Ah I see ty man
---
You‚Äôre right, [this](https://imgur.com/a/WCpbLR4) looks much better.
---
!thesaurizethis
---
Cause safespotting is cheaper in the long run with my combat stats being what they are.
---
Looks cool, my friend recently did a copy of the GE through Unity3d and it looks pretty good, I think he posted it here.
---
Inferno needs highlighted gear to see what to click it seems
---
Currently getting void to do vork. Glad to see I‚Äôm not wasting my time
---
Lmao you described like 3 people I know.
---
idk
---
IDK how you could burn out from something completely afk, but you can't assume that fun is the same for everybody.
---
This what it feels like when you are playing quads on BO1 and your the last alive on wave 80
---
Out of curiosity how many were you asked to kill? is it possible to kill Jad on a Tzhaar task or are there just too many minions?
---
The madlad is rly getting his hunter up there. Can't wait for next episode.
---
This is a fantastic demonstration of the inability of Jagex to stop bots. Forget Runelite Plus
---
Pvp? retarded
---
This is awesome
---
Ye, I have pet on both raids, I'll go for Challenge Mode dust soon too
---
Your battery is about to give up.
---
What is the best way to get a nature talisman (Ironman btw)? I‚Äôve got 40 in melee stats, 1 range, 51 mage. Feel like I‚Äôve got no consistent way of killing abyssal leeches.
---
Any guidance would be appreciated
---
This piece is wonderful! Do you have a tumblr/twitter/instagram we can follow?
---
That's just jpeg tho
---
I made this meme with Zezima, be more original
---
Same, only got fucked at the docks twice though, once after I got powder and once before. Super thankful about that shit was in a panic the whole time.
---
DMM does not look fun one bit.
---
I mostly go "Ugh I couldve gotten away/beat them.."
---
At the moment the sword looks like one of those inflatable birthday swords. Maybe it could be redesigned at the similar thickness of the Dragon 2h ?
---
Fair point

Im torn on the one hand i want more memes/jokes on this sub, on the other hand this joke blows
---
next time marry him
---
Why would you post yourself getting roasted? lmao they shit all over you and you had nothing to say about it
---
How come these don‚Äôt get pinned/stickied anymore?
---
&gt; can hunt them without them having the ability to fight back properly?
---
If you go into a fighting area and you're not geared for a fight, that's not Jagex's fault, LMAO
---
Supplying all of us with low cost resources. Imagine if there were no bots. 1.2k for a lobster
---
7.8/10 too much water.
---
Too many minions. U wont make it even with a full task
---
I'm pretty comfortable these days with fight caves but never wanted to do it back to back.
---
Let it wear whatever item you‚Äôve pked before and used on it
---
When you don‚Äôt even try to hide the fact you‚Äôre a troll...what exactly are you trying to accomplish here? Lol
---
If think this sounds miserable god damn...you got a lot of tragedies ahead of you son
---
Nieve fights Zulrah
---
Maybe a style kit for barrows/ferocious gloves and prims?  I don't see these being useful otherwise.
---
I don‚Äôt doubt that but that‚Äôs a huge risk. Just thought they‚Äôd script the bots to switch to range for better dps during the phases for quicker kills.
---
Because it's spaghetti code from 2002, poorly built upon until 2007, sat dorment for 7 years, and slapped online in a few months. And every update since has been a Chase to fix things broken by the last patch.
---
As much as I fucking love this game, it's an absolute shit show from top to bottom.
---
The worst being a proprietary engine. Hard to hire good programmers because everything you learn at Jagex is damn near useless anywhere else.
---
So is that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt script in a range switch? More food for zulrah mage phase or allowing the bot to eat and not get combod out?
---
I wonder if they will do a pride event in Runescape this year...
---
Looks kinda like... clickbait maybe? Hard to make out

If you play more than 15-20 hours a month, its worth it

its time
---
Both looking dapper Congratulations.

RuneLitePlus good no ban
---
HD graphics best part about 2010-11 RS, remove so many hourlys u have to do
---
Killing jad on task increases the chance by 1/67
---
Also I just learned the other day - capitalization doesn‚Äôt matter when entering it for jagex. So it‚Äôs really a-z and not A-z, if that is what you mean by that.
---
Okokok
---
This is really cool! We (Maikeru's (which is an rs3 youtuber/streamer) twitch subs) are currently working on the entire rs3 world, and he occasionally streams it if anyone is interested in joining in on the fun of the whole world in minecraft.
---
Requires engine work.
---
My point is that you really shouldn't be focusing on your client when you're doing nmz, either play another acc or watch movies/vids. Anyways, this discussion is pointless since we're both right. Your way is more fun for sure, and mine is more efficient.
---
just say NO to future platforming updates
---
Sorry didn't realize you were retarded, my bad man
---
19 house tabs? Gf account
---
Weird flex but ok

They only added it a couple months ago iirc. Sucks about your slayer points though :/

It explains the Guthan gut
---
Where are the pmods also is there none that go to the GE to shut them bots up as well?? Ffs
---
How helpful is an Ely ?
---
That sounds like a thing that would kill the GE instantly. It would become insanely hard to sell anything, the buy offers would collapse.
---
Congratulations on your wedding, OP, and it's amazing to see what kinds of lifelong friendships can spawn from something as simple as chatting to someone in Clan Chat. 
---
All the best in the future!
---
Try being less of a dick next time your right about something if you truly care about making a point for someone else to digest. Dude only said at least someone else thinks so lol followed by a ?
---
no today, Satan
---
They need a mod whos full time job is to pk these bots.
---
And that guy posted with absolutely no evidence. People keep spreading bullshit without doing the most basic verification.
---
This all stemmed from my original comment saying "dont fight people better than you" which is sound and easy advice to follow. It only takes seconds to judge another player, which leaves you with plenty of time to run. If youre looking for me to describe some 6th sense that enables you to read another players ability upon first sighting, then sorry, I cant do that, but there are some tells I previously described (combat level, gear) which for some reason you dissmissed. Do you want some more? 
---
As for the things I listed that easily satisfy your grand revolutionary idea of a "practice mode" - sure castle wars may not perfectly mimic a pk scenario, but it can help with switching, prayers, movement, specing, and eating. What more do you need to practice? The minigame has as many idiots as it does dedicated players, probably more, so I totally disagree with you. Its great practice, Its literally pvp. As for the duel arena, its dead simple to ask a friend to come practice, so again, I disagree with you. Finally you didnt even bother to mention turny worlds, which literally provide the perfect environment for practicing pking. Max stats, any gear, and no loss. Although they could be made permanent, but again, there are plenty of other options.
---
Maybe you should consider not being so hostile and instead formulate a thoughtful opinion, rather than just bashing on someone else's.
---
Add an amulet of ironspeak. If not worn, all ironman chat messages look like btw btw btw btw

This is getting out of hand. Now there's 2,000 of them.

Are They going to smoke barrage jamflex hq?!

I went to DKs for a daxe on my iron. 580 kc later I have 3 extra brings 4 warrior rings an archers, seers mud and seercull.... And no dragon axe.
---
Now I know where they are.
---
Also to add to that, according to pornhub, hentai was the number 5 most watched category. Now, if I were you, I'd quit spewing hogwash bullshit that comes to your mind because you make yourself look like an imbecile. 
---
If anyone thinks that animated boobs are better than real boobs then clearly the person has never seen a pair of tits in real life lmao

Yass pls
---
Ok

Runelite+ plugins don't work on Runelite because RL devs actively work to prevent those plugins from working. Also Runelite+ is open source so please show us all where the account stealing code is.

The day that j roc loses his flow is the day the hair on jim laheys bald head grows.

Wear Monkeyspeak amulet
---
Gonna start off saying be careful who you ask for inferno advice. For some reason tons of people give inferno advice with 0 kc and the information is generally very wrong (Like the guy who just commented defense isn't important). My current kc is 12.
---
Those stats are fine, the extra prayer is nice as your potions give extra prayer but its not a big deal.
---
You will probably get 98 or 99 ranged in the inferno.
---
For setup you need to watch a video but you the basics are tbow + arma, pegs, anguish, avas, ring of suffering, justiciar faceguard, b gloves. For mage switches bring ancestral top + bottom, kodai, occult &amp; ely. Bring an sgs and blowpipe as well. Some people bring a bcp too for the ranged defense. I would recommend it but its up to you.
---
For inventory i recommend a lot of brews while you're learning and make sure you use them. People have the default mentality of conserving supplies but you should focus lasting as long as you can. Once you start getting to triple jads consistently anywhere from 6-10 brews is sufficient. I brought 8 my first completion. 1 bastion, 1 stam, rune pouch with blood barrage runes, the rest restores.

Ironic if you actually bot but have your main account in your post history..
---
The drawing has that Tumblr "perpetually has a cold" nose.
---
Don't worry I'm a regular there
---
In some sense, we all are, with OSRS being a spin-off Timeline from the original Runescape (3) back in 2007.  I'd say we're in the good timeline (and RS3 players, the doomed.)
---
I hate you with every fibre of my being
---
Get 75 attack/def and 77 prayer and max everything else. PK acc and main acc (‚Äúmed level‚Äù)
---
Ability to extinguish the rogues den fire
---
It was a somewhat rhetorical why
---
I'm just worried and concerned at this point
---
Youll get tears either way, only different source
---
Wait a minute you're not some bloke, you're the Loch Ness monster!
---
Whoah- someone who understands that designing things with low detail but prominant shapes is essential for the game and knows the main reason why
---
Dead ass this was (and still is) my biggest issue with a lot of RS3's aesthetic. So much shit just blends together in the mess of details they oversaturate every piece of gear with. It all also becomes literal static at the camera angle you play at 99% of the time. (I'm looking at you, dungeoneering armor)
---
OSRS has a clear visual progression of items, and things are very easily identifiable. (At least the well designed stuff, like the regular sets, dragon, barrows, bandos, 3rd age)
---
man these irons fucked you up lol
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
thats what you get for crashing shit thats alot of heat are you ok lol
---
its my mothers recipe
---
Eh. Agility is a guaranteed XP rate from the start, per course/activity. Herblore implies you have the herbs. And if you don't, you kill for herb drops, or farm for herbs. Either way, there's delay in the XP gained from herblore. Sure you can hit 100k xp/hr if you plan it all out right, but that's with a lot of stocking up ahead of time. Thus, not faster.
---
Heck
---
Still, that xp though.
---
No that's why he meant sex is way more than dating

Oh boy you're missing out
---
These shouldn't take longer than 3 minutes for anyone to solve.
---
The xp rates are awful though unless you need to get quick levels for a quest or something
---
Cheers from tanrack
---
A build like this could do a lot of end game content yeah? I'm obviously super far away from that but would be working towards bossing and such if I did make the switch.
---
Sounds like you buy gold, your accounts skill total is low for your combat level, you crashed someone because you're lazy/can't find your own world, and you cry to reddit. Weird flex
---
You could get 75 attack and 75 defense and still be a lower level but could also do stuff a main could do :)
---
With 99 construction
---
I think that was the joke.
---
Recently got her a new phone just so she could play games of her own.
---
Best investment ever, the tables have turned completely
---
Pretty sure it is, but they kinda add it as a side thing. It should really be the first strat listed since most players are gonna be low end of the combat scale.
---
Does he also sell Gf's?
---
Maybe the God Wars is a euphemism for nuclear war. Climate change and WW3 changed the landscape of Earth beyond recognition, runes are leftover pieces of technology whose operation is so far beyond the comprehension of most of their users that the resulting effects are simply referred to as ‚Äúmagic‚Äù, the monks of Entrana are part of an ancient pacifist tradition that sought to prevent WW3, many places like Morytania became permanently scarred from radiation damage and creatures all over Gielinor mutated into all kinds of horrific and unusual monsters over millennia resulting in the likes of dragons, goblins and trolls.

Lol build a million random blocks that look like figure bots.
---
We already have draw-X.
---
Look up what cost benefit analysis is.
---
It's about maintaining an acceptable level of bots.
---
Enough bots to sell bonds and enough bots to keep consumable prices fair.
---
But not so many bots that the economy becomes unstable, or the players riot.
---
If you actually think that Jagex doesn't factor bots and not management into their bottom line, you need to stay in your lane.
---
He's asking if he continued staking and if he did, what was his net winnings/loss.
---
At this point im tempted to get into botting, just to flood all corners of gielnor with 100s of bots who spam "jagex is powerless against botting" as a protest. maybe that will catch their attention
---
Blew my mind the more I thought about it.
---
&gt;how much of those 200m you lost
---
"GUuuuUUUuuTHHHIXXXX"
---
Oh yeah, the river that‚Äôs floating on top of another river?
---
If you have money use a blowpipe with addy darts and if you have even more money use a cannon.

If you‚Äôre poor fella a rune crossbow with broad bolts is a reasonable alternative.

Those graphics are legit fire tho

I did mm2 on mobile as well now on ds2 last chapter so i know the struggle
---
Is there a reason you just cant use overhead prayers or something?
---
You've done the math yet have no figures whatsoever to show?
---
Yeah. BS. I rest my case.
---
Why the hell would you do this on mobile over pc
---
Runelite.
---
Logins have been especially slow for me lately. Haven't really played enough to have noticed bad ping tho
---
That point can be argued at times but I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre happy.
---
Don't know if you already do this but I suggest using the player indicators plugin. Having a name appear on minimap is much easier spot than a dot
---
Not really
---
Nice. I‚Äôm 2k+ total but still not base 70s... 69 runecrafting lol
---
Do you actually use those chat colors? Are you psychotic OP?
---
The suggestion is to be able to use draw X aswell as a custom draw on items you set it on.
---
So if draw X is set to 14 and I withdraw coins that I have set a custom withdraw limit on for all, clicking coins will withdraw all and clicking rannars for example will still withdraw with X (14)
---
How would you tax items worth 99 gp or less? Rounding?
---
Why is Runelite better?
---
Which would generate less money
---
Requires engine work
---
Yo op is living in 2039
---
Same as that mate. Was really tempted by the one click construction but allow that lol
---
yea
---
Runelite is free and better than osbuddy premium. There's no better alternative, and lots of not safe alternatives
---
And trick or treating bots!
---
Abyssal sire

Go members for 5x the exp than what f2p can offer

It's a figure of speech. As in, assuming he stakes 200m each time, how many 200m did you win/lose?
---
I‚Äôm going around Lumbridge trying to recreate it in Minecraft and let me tell ya there‚Äôs no hidden rooms, though Bob‚Äôs Axes shop looks like it would have a second floor but when I go to a second floor to see what‚Äôs up there it‚Äôs completely empty... maybe I‚Äôve found the hidden rooms up there...
---
How?
---
I‚Äôll try that. Thanks!
---
Welcome to any item market in the world, where prices go up and down.
---
Torvesta's med level is a good series
---
Yes learn how to tank. I love the wildy and I do PVM and skilling and everything there, I don‚Äôt get mad when I get pked. To me i just wasnt paying enough attention to the pray switches. No salt. Regear and I‚Äôm back in the wild. Seriously though, bulwark and black dhide....pay attention to the PKers gear swaps, brew when you get attacked, and restore JUST before the freeze timer is over, and most of the time you‚Äôll get out ez
---
So Runelite has everything for free, and OSBuddy goes ahead, and makes you pay for what RuneLite does better, essentially?
---
Doubt it lol unless English is like his 3rd language
---
Better weapons = more damage = more xp
---
more minigames, like pest control which can award massive xp bonuses &amp; waterfall quest (40k xp btw)
---
WOW
---
And OP is using RL+ to detach his camera lol
---
So anything under 50gp isn't taxed then. Seems fair
---
Ultimately, it's not up to the mods to teach the userbase basic account security.
---
If the player has 2FA on their emails and 2FA on their RS account, then the only reason they'll get hacked is if they have recovery questions which are known by others.
---
Jagex already promote having solid account security but they can't do much else if the players don't do it.
---
YouTube some anti-pking videos, that's how I got started. Then take some friends to clan wars or duel arena and practice there. It'll take time to learn like pvm does but it does get easier.
---
My bad, I was confused cause I did learners w/ Yef and he fully explained verzik
---
No worries, just wanted to paint the picture a little clearer.
---
I‚Äôm sure plenty of people have quit because of bottling. 
---
Imagine a new player logging in and seeing this. Makes the game look amateur. 
---
The economy, and botting, has made 99% of the game dead content apart from an exp grind. 
---
So calm your man titties
---
theres a cooldown? wth
---
obligatory: check/follow the optimal quest guide on the osrs wiki, and work your way to doing birdhouse/herb runs for consistent money
---
Yeah we finally going outside lol
---
*Reactor core explodes*
---
Weird right?
---
Only 3.6% of bots make it out of Tutorial Island. Not great, not terrible.
---
Plan a day off to quest. Can do RFD in one day if your determined
---
Also where do I mine? Finished the tutorial but I‚Äôm not sure of how everything works.
---
I played osrs from launch to summer of 2018 I loved the initial return to a childhood game with my old friends. However, I love to chat while bank standing (alching) or woodcutting. I was met with silence at least 40% of the time. And most of the time you just pass it off as "another afk player...." However as soon as I logged into rs3 (forgot I had a couple 99s!) I noticed people would respond a vast majority of the time when I went to mine/Smith/div/alch/disassemble there's always plenty of people to talk to. Even in really obscure mining places like right outside of phasmatys in world 44 there will be a couple weirdos slapping rocks that I can chit chat with while I  have a smoke listen to music and slap some rocks myself.
---
That is why I play RuneScape. Sometimes I don't want to kill things, sometimes I want to relax and do other skills while talking to other people leveling the same skills. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I don't encounter bots on RS3 and it really makes the game feel alive.
---
Dailies, misscelania and pking (1v1s) is the way I make money and I would rather do that than killing zulrah or slayer monsters over and over again
---
Get your slayer up so you can use broad bolts you need 55 Slayer for them. They're very cheap and effective. Once you have them go to taverly dundgeon and safespot the Blue dragons there, you should make a good bit starter cash by doing that and also get your range and hp lvl up.
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
Yeah it was just a "if", DWH will always be extremely useful so in demand too
---
Slayer mainly. You won't be making much at your levels but it'll start to come in later. Also get into doing herb runs. And skilling like blast furnace, runecrafting and hunter can be pretty decent
---
Yeah, the 'gap' in the middle should be the actual size of the sword.
---
It would kill the bot farm economy...and the P2P economy...and the F2P economy...and then the entire economy when they try to bring them all back together.
---
Could just trade to a members account to bypass.
---
Most people that PK with private on would die to someone on mobile, too
---
Check out Incrediblecc clanchat, im at work right now so i dont have the details but someone in the chat can get you the discord invite and the forum post

"record numbers of new players joining oldschool runescape"
---
Actually, according to my recent studies this might be true
---
I really would, considering how big The Matrix was for millennials, seeing as millenials covers like 80s to 2000?  Like 80% of the millenial population was old enough to experience the cultural shock that was the Matrix, and that other 20% was old enough to experience the sequels in school/media. 
---
I would argue a very, very small amount of millennials does not know what the Matrix is, or who Keanu Reeves is, even if not by name until recently.
---
My friend plays WoW as much as I play RS, and we get into arguments constantly about which is better and why.
---
Apparently you can't max every skill (profession) in WoW on one character. She doesn't understand  why I Reeee over this every time we have this discussion.
---
I explain that in RS, I can be the tank, DPS, and spellcaster in the same fight, and that I can do all of the bossing content (minus Raids 2) alone. She Reeees that there's no point in bossing alone.
---
To each his own, we keep having to end these arguments lol.
---
&gt;Someone has a super powerful computer than can run hundreds of botting scripts on 100s of different clients at the same time.
---
I hope they stub their toe in the dark, every day, for at least 5 years.
---

And if you don't mind, gear should I stock up on with ~60m with 70 combat stats and a Bandos chestplate already?

Make another e-mail request or send a support ticket, if their mailserver is offline they'd like to know!

---
&gt;There is a big difference between requiring 70 Mining for a quest and requiring literal everything for a BiS Cape. 
---
Where does the difference start between *forcing* players to do content they don't like being OK and not being OK then? Level 70 is OK apparently, so what about 80? Maybe 90? 98...?
---
&gt; Skills on their own should feel useful 
---
Why? Aren't you worried about devaluing the achievements of people who got 99 while it was useless? God forbid a video game has some incentive to play certain content.
---
&gt;players only want recognition for their achievements, not special benefits because of it.
---
According to what exactly? Well I'll tell you that's according to nothing at all. Only a vocal minority says this. Poll evidence proves otherwise.
---
&gt; if you give everyone a reason to get the achievement, then it stops being a prestigious achievement. 
---
Also a pretty dumb mentality to have. Lynx Titan will never not be the first person to 4.6b XP. No matter how many more people achieve that or how much faster training skills gets.

send a ticket through the support system?

I‚Äôve been training slayer lately and even I can pick out the bots with more advanced scripts. They are high levelled accounts and use climbing boots and rune defenders. I‚Äôve seen lvl 90-115 with the setup, and I doubt it‚Äôs a coincidence.

I can't because I don't know anyone there, he moved to Leicester and I'm in London with no way of contacting him + I don't know anyone there as he is the only one from our area who went there.

I hope you die alone and feeling like your entire life was for naught. Literally everything you do could be done better by someone else.

---
Fucking love that game series. All three games
---
I've played since 04 dude. Been around a long time. Bots have always been a problem but there's no denying they've gotten *worse* in the last 6 months or so. It makes it extremely discouraging to play.

I quit because of the massive number of bots and complete lack of faith in the security of my account despite all measures taken offered by Jagex. I refuse to spend $11 on a game with hardly any customer support and almost no confidence to offer players that their accounts and banks will stay theirs, I feel I‚Äôm safest staying offline and keeping my username out of peoples eyes.  I truly feel bad for Mod Ash as that company will do nothing to support or accommodate  that mans passion for his job and player base.  I truly appreciate some of the effort the people who truly care there seem to be exerting.  But I will not spend another dime on them until they do more to address my core concerns with customer support.  I don‚Äôt have very well informed opinions or ideas on how game content has been handled so I won‚Äôt speak on that.  But the rest definitely made me quit sadly.
---
Hey, im a pker, and I wish I would have pked you and then followed you to lumby and see your legless graceful
---
Will it ignore attacking an NPC on tile?
---
I'll give you a scenario why this is a problem and why jagex do NOT implement IP Bans. Say there is a child and a father, both play runescape. The child is running the bot farm on the same ip as the dad who knows nothing about this, is it fair to ban the dad for doing nothing wrong? Also what if the IP was an internet cafe where 100s of people played legitimately?
---
Hobo goblins üòÇ love it

~~What about his e-mail address? Has the password ever been leaked? You can probably find his passwords in one of the lists if he get hacked once.~~

Lmao, why does he even play if he's not going to have fun building it

This is like the ultimate temper tantrum lmao but runescape manlet would quit for those reasons
---
I‚Äôll see if I can get to you after that pussy in Oregon. I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm not stupid enough to think I can hurt everyone but thanks for not being a complete pussy not kindly quit wasting me time and fuck off and maybe if your lucky I‚Äôll find my way to Germany where I can put you in a fucking gas chamber where you belong fucker.

Nobody is discussing the fact that a very good friend betrayed you. I don‚Äôt think this is really about osrs. I feel bad for you dude, goodluck getting over this.

I hope that the time spent in your room playing this game and avoiding your family members starts to take a toll on your mothers mental health so badly that she starts eating more and more every day to the point of which she develops type 2 diabetes and has a heart attack while laying in bed one night and you miss your opportunity to save her life due to the fact that you were sitting in your room alone once again, trying to grind out that last piece of graceful.
---
What proof does fedex have that he did?
---
No problem, I only expected to break even as I always see people saying it‚Äôs break even or slight loss. I did have an occult so I‚Äôm not sure if that was what made the difference?
---
An RS3 player by the name of MaikeruRS (look him up on YT) is already doing this and has gotten pretty far, go and see if you can collab with him maybe?
---
I found his email address for the account but I don't have the password for it as it was a new email made specifically for the creation of his new account.
---
They‚Äôre just mocking jagex at this point. What a sad sight to see
---
I‚Äôm not gonna shame you for wanting to buy an account, I‚Äôve done before because I didn‚Äôt want anything to do with early game runescape, training from level 1 and doing all the quests is just aids and annoying.
---
But, I will tell you I played on that account for about a whole year and then it was recovered and I was never able to get on it again.  MOST runescape accounts that people sell will just get recovered to be sold again, it‚Äôs not worth it.
---
Wait isn't this already the case?
---
btw
---
Wtf are you talking about?
---
I‚Äôve already cut my fucking family out of my life. Whatever happens to those fuckers is the least they deserve for trying to bring someone like me into the world. Your attempt at making me feel bad is as limp dicked as you are in real life now kindly go fuck yourself you child.
---
Because someone managed to run that many bots.  Imagine how many are out skilling/looting if someone can just run like 100 of them at the GE.  Doesn‚Äôt take long for the economy to take an arrow to the knee.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter what they‚Äôre doing, the fact they‚Äôve managed to amass that many accounts at once is scary. You‚Äôre very quick to judge this other person for piping up about botting like you yourself are some sort of expert, yet you are using metrics which show the prevalence of botting as proof it‚Äôs not that bad.
---
The reason it‚Äôs hard for botters to make profit is because gp is worthless, botters are rampant and have floored all the prices so low that the time investment is becoming less worth it. 
---
If by doing something right you mean making free to play a cesspit of bots with all items being worthless so that the barrier to becoming a member is too much time investment to be worth it for botters, then you‚Äôre correct, what a great strategy...

They haven't gotten any worse at all, you're just falling for the classic "if this sub says it, it must be true!". If you actually speak to some of the botting community they will tell you just how hard it is to make money ATM due to ban rates from tutorial island bots, meaning tutorial island has to be done manually if you don't want a large risk of being banned... That is a HUGE deal.
---
A lot of the insane bot hotspots from years gone by are empty, eg turoths used to be ridiculous, every world was full of bots. That doesn't happen now.

A good source for money making ideas would be the [money making page on the wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide). It has various methods and lists the requirements and expected profit/hour of each method. you can go the page of a specific money maker for more information on the method.
---
Real World Trading mostly: sell the gp to people who are willing to pay real money for it. Botters are willing to go pretty far to keep their bot farms up because their own livelihood is at stake.
---
Thanks I'll check it out :P
---
Thanks for that. I probably wouldn't repeat the event if the community behaved like that. Really unfortunate.

Create a f2p account and sit on tutorial island for a while and watch all accounts that disappear. The info is out there you just have to look at places other than Reddit.

Can someone explain to me the absolutely drastic differences between what people claim gp/hr rates are on YouTube/this Reddit vs what the wiki says? I know the wiki's GE prices are not updated every 60 seconds, but with claims of 10m+ an hour, GE prices on the wiki would have to be off by like 300 %.

One of the key components when updates are brought to OSRS is that any new gear needs to be horizontally power scaled. Pretty much any new weapon added to the game will only be stronger than another in specific scenarios (some weapons are dragon bane, some are better for stab than slash, etc.). 
---
Also there's tons of mid/end game content being added. I hope Blizz adds more end game raids with classic once the core player base has cleared Molten Core to oblivion. Part of what makes OSRS raid content and other end game content interesting is seeing how far you can push the game with your limited gear. Not power creeping your gear means that more difficult content will require more skill to clear rather than just better gear.

---
I don't think its really an issue of it needing a buff. I feel it is more that there are very few places in he game that high defensive stats is better than going max dps. It would be kind of nice if content was added that would give it more of a use.
---
(I don't know the hit chance calculations well enough to know how feasible it really is, so take with a grain of salt.) It would be neat to have a boss that can hit very hard with decent accuracy that would target the player with the highest defense. Possibly with it healing based on damage dealt or getting stronger every time it killed someone so that it's not just dps is quickly as you need someone to actually be wearing very tanky gear to keep it from getting stronger or healing

Wat? If you thought I was implying gayness, I think you misunderstood me. Of course IF you want to imply that, do rainbow Gracefuls - that surely attracts a lot unwanted attention.
---
Yes
---
The difference is subjective. Some players think Diaries force players too. But when the requirement is level 99 in every skill or literally everything in the game, that is far less reasonable of a requirement so you'll likely find more opposition. Also, your skill argument is silly; you don't devalue a 99 by adding content at 99 because skills are meant to have content (increasing exp rates is a different story). Maxing has never had "content" for it until the Max Cape and even then it was originally polled as cosmetic and Completionist has never had rewards for it in OSRS. Same can be said for Champion's Challange and other prestige achievements; players never did them expecting a reward or benefit.
---
&gt; According to what exactly? Well I'll tell you that's according to nothing at all. Only a vocal minority says this. Poll evidence proves otherwise.
---
According to the players the content is for. The Completionist Cape is for Completionists and most Completionists I've seen are opposed to adding benefits to Comp. It is mainly players with the mentality of "I'll never get it, but it takes a lot of work, therefore, it should give really good perks" who support that kind of thing, which is a horribly flawed mentality since it completely ignores the interests of the players it is for and the impacts it has on the game. And this is not just a thing I'm in favor of; the OSRS Team have said this is why they are hesitant to add a Completionist Cape multiple times.
---
And your last point is barely worth addressing with how much you twisted that. The first player to do something will always have a prestigious achievement. But if you are one of 100 players who have the Champion's Cape, that is a rare thing; if now 10,000 players own the cape because they made it BiS so everyone grinds it out, it is no longer a prestigious thing now is it? The point of adding these sorts of items is to recognize the achievement; not to encourage more players to grind it out by offering benefits where none were needed.

The angle you chose made it seem very 2D. Should've angled the camera a bit
---
What's your farming level? Happy to answer as many questions as you have. 
---
I always recommend being consistent with fruit tree runs. Papaya (or the best you can do if lower) once a day every day, calquats when you unlock them and your farming will be great before you know it. After that, you just have to start adding in more stuff. Everything other than trees is somewhat inefficient in terms of xp/hr, so you have to decide how much xp you want and how fast. I started doing herb runs and that was pretty good xp, but not great. 
---
But the real game changer was Snape Grass. You can pull in hundreds of thousands of xp/day if you commit to doing Snape Grass. I think I was at 94 farming when Snape Grass was released and I hit 99 just a few weeks later, and that was only doing the guild and hosidius allotments. If you do all the allotments on recharge, you could pull in an absurd amount of xp in one day. 
---
All of my post 99 xp is from contracts and money-farming in the farming guild.
---
I haven't seen a single ironmen that didnt enjoy the ez scape alchable drop instanced boss updates. That's literally all they want. Bad roleplay / 10
---
I do the same thing but on a much smaller scale. Probably once a week I'll buy 10-20 set of iron armor and scimmys. Then just walk around goblins, chickens and cows to look for people who look legitimately new. I'll throw them the full iron, iron scimmy and 5k. It's such and inconsequential cost for me but it feels like the absolute world to them. It feels nice to help out and then have someone say "I'm really happy there are people like you in this game"

Well done pal.

That was pretty good actually, took me a minute tho.

No one bots on a game no one plays, RS3 is a good example of this.

Given that gp has real world value, you would need to make osrs 18+ to abide by every regional gambling law.

Potentially worse so is if someone went on a won streak and won a few bil. That's a few bil that magically enters the economy in just a few seconds. The economy would be a slave to this dice npc after a good number of large bets.
---
Taking highschool econ doesn't make you Warren buffet
---
Urmmmmmmmmmm

Idk I don't do this kind of thing because it ruins the early game experience, having to manage your bank and save up for your first rune item is very exciting as a new player
---
I think it's time for you to get help dude
---
That's exactly what I did. It was my 3rd attempt and 2nd time reaching Jad but I would watch Jad videos on Youtube and call out Jads attack while hovering over the video like I was gonna click prayers, absolutely helped.
---
Never seen such a shit idea
---
You, gentlemen are what make this game great, not just helping true noobs through early game, which let's face it kinda sucks, but teaching lifelong skills that set the foundation for a truly fun experience! Not to mention continuing the act of paying it forward!
---
And for that, I salute you!

She floats right? It's probably pretty easy to update an NPCs speed but doing the animation would be different, so her floating made it pretty simple

Right now I'm 49. I'm doing herb runs when I get seed drops, and I just got 100% favour for tithe farm last night
---
Probably saying that because price of a lot of gear is going down. Could be the case but summer time and a lot of other factors influence that too.
---
2 of them actually, the same one too. I'd rather a useful drop. It's a curse for ironmen.

And thats why cox is great, it actually incorporates many of your skills instead of it just being focused purely on combat skills

Thank you, I will forever look at those shapes as skeletal structures too

Noobs wanted tank armour, even though more experienced players know tanking is always worse than offence. The noobs get tank armour, which does exactly what they wanted, tank. And now noobs want it to be better cause tanking in this game is useless.

Fucking noobs dude

You'll have to speak to oziach first to enable that feature.
---
Combat isnt too hard to train, there are plenty of afk ways to train melee, ranged, and magic. 
---
What's your problem with nmz? Is it too afk? Makes too much money? Too good of xp rates? 
---
"actually have to play sc" that's why there are 50 people just camping base and afking the whole game right?
---
Instead of nmz you could just dharok at ape atol beside the altar, use guthans at bandits, chainmace at elder chaos druids, slayer etc. (nmz isnt too good for magic and ranged) and afk as well. 
---
Stealing creation gives double xp (doubling xp rates not accounting for time spent in sc) in mining, woodcutting, fishing, smithing, crafting, and fletching. For the last 3 skills it pretty much halves the cost to get your skills up. Nmz doesnt double your xp rates... 
---
 nightmare zone is only a decent "money maker" using melee, and even after that you can only claim 15 herb boxes daily or take a big hit in gp/hr, but doing slayer is more afk than farming points.. So i dont see your point in hating nmz?
---
Hahahaha I assume youve been rcing with me recently

Thank you for silver kind scaper

Worst 3 moneymaking advice i've read on this subreddit my entire life.

I too collect overly baked goods. Haven‚Äôt been on in a while, what‚Äôs your asking price?
---
&gt;I wish there was an award for stupid comments, cus I'd spend that 2.99 to give it to you.

Can you repeat the question?
---
This has been my routine since 07 came out....
---
Honestly wish my RS IQ was near 0 so I could actually have fun and enjoy the game as it is instead of the vicious cycle of PvM/Pk, make bank, get bored, stake, lose it all, rebuild, stake, etc. 
---
Something about rebuilding is the only way I can really enjoy the game.
---
Congratulations
---
you‚Äôre not the only one, i saw the elder maul first too

Thanks!

How many PCs do you need to do run a bot net like this and how beefy do they need to be?
---
I think the worst of it was the past couple years and shes been without that drama recently I believe. I used to watch a shit ton of RT back in the rvb days and I was horrified when I learned a dude went into gavin/megs house to kill them both and ended up killing himself. some people are just mentally unstable and get too attached to these internet figures

Angler outfit is needed for a master clue as well, I believe. As well as being required for minnow fishing.

I guess you don‚Äôt understand how account recovery works if there is a good amount of personal info leaked
---
It has no dps, it is only used for its spec. A much better upgrade is getting fighter torso and buying bandos tassets. I have been using sgs for slayer for a while now and it's not a huge requirement, its just a convenience thing.
---
Yep. It's why I like hosting small groups at ardy knights. If I don't properly re-engage after leveling magic I lose aggro and folks auto clicking or just using a mouse key while watching TV keep clicking the picture above happens.
---
nice
---
What‚Äôs +40 damage boost ?
---
More of a ball sack tho
---
Every game has their superstitions. I get my BGS spec ready in my poh so it doesn't think it'll get used for vorkath and will hit above 10. Definitely not how it works but it makes me feel better. I also don't let other people touch my D&amp;D dice because everyone knows that if you share dice it sucks all the good rolls out of them.
---
Sell it all go to duel arena
---
Not especially, more that a service such as a client is suspicious until proven otherwise, and using another trusted services brand within your own title has been a go-to for scams and other malicious attacks in the past.
---
Get out of here, Stalker!
---
Then you can't be a completionist, so it shouldn't be added
---
please explain.. this sounds devious and i like devious.
---
I've been doing inferno for a few weeks and still don't have Cape but have been getting to zuk consistently for a while, take that for what you will. But IMO you should start learning using ancestral/armadyl and then switch to justiciar/armadyl once you've gotten a feel for all the monsters. You literally don't even equip justiciar until wave 38 if you use it, so there is really no point in bringing it at the beginning when you are just learning the early waves.
---
I can take Ironman jokes, but these "Ironman btw" and "Ironman chat system" jokes are been overused to the point of losing the edge. They just aren't funny anymore.
---
If you want to joke our "stubbornness" to play game "properly", be more creative and make new original jokes about us.
---
I know, but isn't it a myth that this information can be used to recover your account?
---
Looting in general ruins the experience. Why not play the game for real and make your money that way instead of just picking up things left on the ground? I understand why boys are bad, I dont understand how looting bots are ruining this poor guy's experience.
---
&gt;a service emulating another services brand 
---
All 3rd party clients are services emulating another service's brand lol.
---
No, it's not slow at all. 
---
Anything before the new expansion is irrelevant. You have to level through the zones, but that only takes a few days and doesn't require you touching any dungeons at all. Plus, you can buy a boost through it all.
---
In the current expansion, there are catchup mechanics to let you get geared for the newest raid within a week or two. If you go really hard with Mythic+, you can do it extremely quickly.
---
Once you're there, all of the best gear is in the newest raid. Every older raid is irrelevant, even from the most recent expansion, since there are no real upgrades to be had.
---
There's 15 years of content in WoW, and Uldir, released on 11th September 2018, is already not worth running at all. Battle of Dazar'alor, which was released on the 22nd January this year, is already pretty much pointless to run since the new raid and patch is coming out on the 9th July. You won't find many guilds still running it next month, and a lot are on a break at the minute until the new raid.
---
Dont forget no symbols
---
It don't :(
---
It was steel for sure. Maybe I got it from Neive then. I use both. It was definitely in the 50's though cuz I banged it out with a trident and expeditious bracelet. Which only went off twice üòë
---
Correct me if I'm stupid, but would integrating Captcha to login (like, once every 30 days or something) help with the problem?
---
Well I keep all my items cause I still want to play the game, can‚Äôt really do anything with a stack of gp
---
This is the time to buy imo best guess is how low everything‚Äôs gonna drop it‚Äôs all eventually going back up
---
Cute and pretty. I like it a lot. \^\^
---
Or you just don't I cause unobtainable things to it? Lmao. Calm down love.
---
lets be real here my guy we are on runescape right now. I love this game but i'd rather say i play fortnite than runescape
---
It's poorly formatted. It should read: "Prayer Bonus: +40; Damage Boost: +10% against overheads"
---
This is... Not a great suggestion lol
---
? I am calm lol, what makes you think I'm angry?
---
Depends on how fast you kill the  cyclops and if ou get lucky or not. I would recommend getting like 2k tokens and then see where that gets you.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre being intentionally obtuse, but calling yourself ‚ÄúRuneLite+‚Äù when you‚Äôre not RuneLite or associated in any way with RuneLite is an issue.

Is it possible to obtain a clue scroll bottle while fishing for frog spawn? Or is that limited to rivers, the sea.
---
Is OP a boat?
---
Maybe
---
Definitely illegal unfortunately. Dont get me wrong ive spent plenty of time dinking around with the dicers. (I may have a problem lol) but if Jagex were to implement their own form of gambling, that would def be illegal in parts of the world especially with the portion of the player base that is underage having access to this. Even if you don‚Äôt consider the price of gold to equate to how much bot farms sell it for, you could technically equate $6 to 4mil since thats the irl price of a bond and ingame price of a bond.
---
Eliminating the incentives is a good thought! Difficult to approach, but the right idea. Although I believe that most bots are made as a means to make gold and sell it for real money. If people didn‚Äôt buy gold, we‚Äôd see the amount of bots drop pretty significantly. The bots that are made for people to shortcut when training skills are a smaller portion of the overall bots, and I don‚Äôt see them as much of an issue. 
---
The ones I‚Äôm referring to are the bot farms who make hundreds of bots each week and have them banned every week, but not before they make a few million gold and sell it to gold selling websites.
---
Btw I appreciate your feedback on the issue, I think it‚Äôs been very constructive
---
Im not buying gold, just saying that Iron Man (and its popularity) is a big game-changer for the RWT.
---
People are lazy and want 99 Prayer, etc., without all the effort, either way Im hoping for the day that we login without all the bots!
---
And then a giant river troll bludgeoned you in the back. Not the first time this has happened. Sorry about your luck

Bones to peaches turns all the bones in your inventory into peaches, Dragon bones are 3k a piece while peaches are significantly less than that. It would be pretty frustrating but also hilarious as a pker to get an inventory full of peaches when you were expecting 200k in bones.

---
Oh shit is this why I couldnt log in yesterday? I got an error message that said "no reply from login server".
---
Not a very well thought out idea and very bad formatting. It looks like you‚Äôre suggesting a 40% damage boost. 
---
Anyway, no. 10% damage boost to an offhand is broken. The point of those monsters having overheads is to limit your attack choices/make it harder.
---
And everyone would just use the insanely cheap Guthix god pages to repair their book.
---
He was getting downvoted. Fair
---
It's a bit true.

In a general sense they definitely prioritize end game stuff, though.

You won't lose a lot of money even if they do dip a little more. Ideally, they should go back up again at some point.
---
It's literally how the game works, it's how they designed it. Just because you weren't smart enough to account for it doesn't mean it's a negative thing. You can cry about it or you can go make more spicy stews and not be such a dumbass next time.
---
Literally drop everything and get b gloves. Your gear is shit until you get them, that's how important they are. B gloves are a significantly better upgrade than fury to torture, d boots to prims, and barrows armor to bandos all combined. They are essential on any mid level account with plans to do any combat.
---
That is pretty expensive. At the very least that‚Äôd make it less profitable. It‚Äôs not an airtight plan, I agree. Just want to get the suggestions rolling
---
okay what do u offer
---

190k/hr isn‚Äôt fast enough?

This argument would have been valid
---

Slayer bosses/ superriors

---
Were never added but oh wait they were and they made the game easier, and quicker to train and better for the community.
---
Who needs barrows gloves when you have a sexy regen bracelet /s
---
That explains it.
---
Looooool this pre good, tbh most time pking here is just to find other pkers , people training prayer are attacked just to fill a void in time between finding them
---
Because there's only one global timer for all boosts. If using a boosting item reset the timer, you could use something cheap like attack potions to prevent your boosts from draining.
---
I had to take a 2nd look, you literally have the same set up as me, down to the corner of the wall!
---
Yea we used to have 6 of us spend all day there and split with every1 if you took part in the kill, only me n my missus left but had a full Bandos set dropped yesterday
---
Dm me a pic!

Your comment has nothing but negativity in it, its unnecessary in all ways imaginable. Take a big look in the mirror, is this the person you want to be?

Is it possible to maintain member with coins only
---
Imo most fun part of Ironman is early to mid game. End game grinds are just dumb long and annoying like crafting before the new seaweeds and slayer without a cannon or unlimited pray pots
---
That's what I say about them adding new skills to the game to anti new skillers...
---
Off the top of my head, I think that it provides very minimal defense bonuses.  
---
They‚Äôre super cheap and minimal defense is better than no defense, so might as well snag one!
---
Lol worst subreddit on this platform, crab memes are fun. Keep it up 30 year old virgins ;)
---
*Botting: 99*
---
Because there are multiple stats all running on a single timer; doing a time per skill would be far more resource intensive. And I recall they did mention changing it so if you have base stats, the timer resets when you're stats are modified. But because you are using stews, you likely already had stats modified before getting the boost you want. And likewise, even if your Con is boosted by the stew, you Crafting may not have been touched so if if your Crafting is boosted or drained, getting a Con boost can't reset that timer too.
---
Thanks, this is actually helpful and makes sense.

Use an Excalibur or dragon battle axe special and wait for the counter to start when trying to boost. Or any cheap potion like attack..

Dude everyone deals this shit. Like someone just posted below, if it were set up differently it would be abused. You literally made a mistake and then you came here to cry about it expecting sympathy, but you're gunna call other people toxic children? Give me a break dude, you need to get laid.
---
Good idea!
---
You mean just like ZMI and Arceuus RC were already added to RC? There is a difference between adding new content to the skill and reworking the entire skill. RC has already seen some updates to give more options for training, but complaining that it needs a global exp buff because you think it is too slow is silly. It isn't even the slowest skill...
---
Servers aren't PCs though? You realize "PC" stands for "Personal Computer" right? Like, a PC can be a server, too, but the type of servers that dude above was talking about are like.. *server* servers. Like Server OS and hardware type.
---
Using the "Chop chop" special attack clearly references the fact that hands were chopped off when rubber gathering quota's weren't met.

Buffing xp would ruin the economy?

Stringing jewelery is very afk and at 130k xp/hr it's pretty good imo. Look for low loss amulets though don't just buy the first that comes to mind

All fine and dandy until Torvesta logs in under you and d claws the fuck out of you.

Which is history

Congratulations, you have explained the picture!
---
It's really not. $3 for say 800 including bugs in a script that makes the account, then bot them though tutorial Island and sell them for $0.08 and you've made $64 - 3 for expenses = $61.

They think theyre chads for getting 500 total level L0L

---
Isn't this against the rules?
---
The issue with people like you is the same issue with conservatives, you worked your ass off to get where you are and you don‚Äôt want it to be easier for others, no matter the justification. It‚Äôs funny because you‚Äôd think In a game as fucking massive as rs, you think you‚Äôd run out of original stuff to do and be interested in additional content, yet people of your same creed consistently turn down great ideas for legitimately no good reason. You guys don‚Äôt even listen to the idea, it‚Äôs funny.
---
Everything you listed, safe spot, spellbook, freeze timer, etc isn‚Äôt against the rules.

**Can something be actually done with Thammaron's sceptre already?**
---
Thammaron's sceptre is currently useless and in need of a buff in comparison to the other wilderness weapons. The **core problem** remains the same though, which is that there's very **few monsters in the wilderness you can actually use magic against.** This can be addressed by fixing the many safe spots by either putting the bosses into caves or enclosed areas and making magic actually a possibility instead of being entirely disallowed by the ridiculous +500 magic defense bonus that Callisto has. Originally it was possible to use magic against Callisto but they decided on a lazy fix (now gone jmod) to just fix safe spotting at the time by making it impossible to use magic.
---
So to sum it up:
---
1) Fix wilderness safe spots (callisto, venanatis, vet'tion, etc)
---
2) Make magic great again by allowing us to use it (**greater pool of npcs not immune to magic preferably**)
---
3) Make more npcs weak to magic and perhaps resistant to other styles within the wilderness (**At the very least allow all 3 styles to be equally used instead of limiting others**)
---
4) Fix Thammaron's sceptre so it's actually on par with craw's bow and vigorra's chainmace in terms of **DPS and similar cost** to use per hour.
---
5) Another possibility is to allow the sceptre to ignore all magic defense of npcs in the wilderness. This allows a competitive edge against all other magic weapons in the wilderness and gives way to being able to use magic against Callisto once again without being able to safespot abuse with ice barrage's freezing. **Callisto can remain immune to all binding and freezes.**
---
You weren't beat enough as a child.
---
Cant venenatis stack over 100? Super greedy and unreasonable.

Revs did help the wildy, but it also was pretty aids in another way.  Many other spots died a ton in activity because of revs. They are nice in that there is permanently action there, but you have to be ready to fight very large teams. It's not terribly friendly to small man groups, which imo small man pk group fights are some of the most fun.  I say this as someone currently in a big multi clan as well. If we had a reduction in the number of worlds, or some miracle could take place and the world hop timer could be reduced, that would help out some problems. If you try to pk other places you just hit hop timers before  you find one of the few other people out there. There are of course a few spots that do get action still, but without revs they'd be much more popular for sure.

No they don't. Anyone that can set up a bot can change their IP. It's not worth their time.

Why did you change the face? The colored one has a sort of half-smug/half-stoned look that doesn't really suit the rest of the drawing.
---
The playerbase is largely against warding, and doesn't like to see all of this dev time being spent developing an idea that will likely never be implemented. What would it take for warding to actually just be cancelled? It feels like it's currently plodding along despite every reason to kill it.
---
Can the message ironmen receive when they get no loot from a monster because another player damaged it appear when they first damage the creature instead of when they finally kill it? If this were implemented, the message would have to not be filtered by the game chat as it currently is.
---
Lol. I don‚Äôt have any wealth in the game, but I‚Äôve gotten joy dressed up as Santa and passing gems onto people who were training at Goblins in lumby. It‚Äôs small, but people are grateful and funny and all that. Definitely a fun game to give in.

Nope. Start fresh :)

Just started farming Vorkath. Plugged my stats and gear into the DPS calculator, using blowpipe with mith darts I got 6.382 DPS and with addy darts I got 6.477 DPS. Why does everyone recommend at minimum addy darts when they are hardly even better for so much more of a jump? I used mith darts for my first 5 kills yesterday.

---
They are all just dancing, rather that then bring more money into the game.
---
Alch yourself.
---
People dont like the fact that someone else botted to get their stats while they had to work hard for their own. If you were more open minded, you would realize its just a silly pride and it doesnt actually matter.
---
Zeah is so relaxing honestly. Have nothing but time at the moment  so I'm just putting time into it while listening to podcasts. Should have 99 in like a week or so.

I've only skimmed it so far, but it looks like a lot of changes in the right direction. Glad to see a lot of the core mechanics were simplified.
---
Fixed it to curb your saltiness.

Highly doubt they'd put in a skill similar to dungeoneering. Too much PTSD associated with chaotics.

Best bet would maybe be a minigame with weaker rewards.

What if the item costs 1gp in GE?

I guess selling gold means you can't provide feedback.

it probably doesn' help that shes good at games and likes pretty hardcore shit like comp shooters and from soft games
---
I‚Äôd buy
---
Kemp
---
That's why I said, 1% with a minimum of 1gp.. Meaning, if the tax is less than 1gp you always have a 1gp tax, so a  1gp item will cost 2gp then

oh wow a pk clip. there's probably 200,000 better clips on youtube.

"yo babe ill pay you in head and back scratchies if youll run this grey shit to me for a few hours every day for a month"
---
So what happens to items currently selling for 1gp? This is so bad for economy tho
---
No, people bought because they want to sell gold. Very few people just bot for stats. I‚Äôd rather not get into another argument about how gold selling is bad for the game. Right now you‚Äôre just playing devils advocate. You‚Äôre saying that botting is okay and I think that‚Äôs where this needs to end. Me, Jagex, and many other players disagree

In bonds it would be more like $3k as 4m (1 bond) is like $7
---
I always wondered why they made it more xp than fishing, compared to mining which is more xp than smithing.
---
Meaning fishing the fish gives way less xp than cooking it, while mining the ores give slightly more xp than smelting and smithing those ores.
---
Mining and Smithing make more sense.

Ya i can buy a game on steam for it to take 5 hours to download.  Can go crack the same game from some scetch basement in norway and it download in an hour.

Yes. In almost all states convicted felons are eligible to vote in elections again as soon as they're free. Kemp got banned, that was his punishment, and hes contributing still to the game he clearly cares about. You sound ignorant and I'd rather have Kemp's input than yours at this point.
---
This is why we have looting bags
---
It's so we can pick everything up and leave nothing for these looters
---
Even b4 the looting bots there was legit players looting. Now they can't because bots, but it was still a thing.
---
That's why they added looting bag to pvp worlds too
---
The cost of scales, darts etc.
---
Contact his parentsüëπ
---
i want to see a compelling elevator pitch. a 40 page design document is incredibly intimidating and if Jagex wants people to vote yes, they need to be able to explain the core gameplay loops concisely which I don't think they've done yet
---
and yeah this document was not intended to explain warding with brevity, but at this point its been several months and I feel that most people still dont quite understand what warding is other than "crafting but for magic armor"
---
This thread is blessed
---
I can probably do it faster/more AFK some other way, but thanks for the suggestion.
---
Better would be a stale baguette ü•ñ

You‚Äôll need shit tons for slayer and sang/scythe when you get those
---
Blowpipe costs over 350k per hour to use so yeah depends if u have the money for it or not
---
Would it be possible to have a less click intensive options for lower and mid level thieving training? I was thinking something like birdhouses where it's EHP training. I think the Sorceress's Garden minigame could be reworked for this. One run equals one glass of juice for all levels, but you're locked out of the game for \~hour. I don't know what the best numbers should be, but the one glass would give more xp. Maybe side rewards could be herbs from the garden as well, like seeds from birdhouses, but I don't know what the implications of that would be. It certainly doesn't need to be another passive moneymaker.

* Memes

Currently I have no official posts to follow progress since it is in such an alpha stage. But I was compiling demo clips to showcase the current status. If anyone here is interested I will update this comment when I do.
---
This reminds me of when I got two 1/4096 drops back to back while grinding for the 1/3000 mole pet. Still don‚Äôt have the pet btw.
---
If that's pretty cash then you wouldn't be f2p

If Twitter users could stop using the royal ‚Äúwe‚Äù in one sentence rants, it would make their opinions so much more valid.
---
I'm in that range and I've never heard of any of these people or brands before. I may be an outlier, but I'm not convinced
---
Why do u say Konar
---
Is this a new skill they‚Äôre thinking of adding?
---
As far as next steps go, dragon, obsidian, and then barrows are going to be in your immediate future. I would also definitely recommend grinding out a fighter torso in barbarian assault - it usually only takes about 4 hours and there are clans you can join with skilled players who will help.
---
These items may seem expensive now, but the money-making methods in p2p are way quicker and more efficient than F2P, and they won‚Äôt be nearly as much of a grind as you‚Äôre used to.
---
I‚Äôd also highly recommend getting full graceful. I know it‚Äôs not really combat armor, but it‚Äôs going to make your life 1000000x easier in the long run (ha).
---
I dont think they'd actually do anything since we're around 22 years old and not controlled by our parents.
---
A good thing to note is that he basically has made it so that mtx is a low possibility in osrs
---
He drilled it into everyone's heads that we do not like mtx, and now the higher ups kind of understand it'll be a bad idea(of course money is always a factor for them...)
---
So we can thank him for any lack of mtx so far
---
No prob

Konar for 10th task and the rest Duradel. Nieve if you don't have 100 combat.

oh yeah

---
"enjoy your bananas ya filthy animal"
---
I meant after a long time. I‚Äôm saying that if I train about a week the difference would be 100k.
---
Btw.
---
Yo...if this were really a thing I would grind it out continuously. That's some top tier fashionscape
---
You'll start milking another player
---
That‚Äôs some psycho gf shit :)
---
Why Konar for 10th task does it give more points then nieve
---
also super combats and absord + rockcake with any gear on easy rumble. 20 min afks for super afk training
---
You really don't see anything wrong with a single inventory slot holding runes allowing you to cast any spell in the game on any spellbook? Just in general, that's a large change.
---
Or you could just kill the wyrms and actually improve your account while making money so you don't have to rely on looting for money.
---
Nope it gives a +1 str bonus not a 1%
---
Good fucking lord
---
rune pouch would have to be brought in the wildy and there's associated risks with that. also how often do people grab runes for more than 1 or 2 spells. it doesnt really buff anything other than a couple inventory spaces saved, at most
---

You underestimate how much influence a parent has on their children even when they're adults! Do make sure you explain the value of what he stole and in what way he did it.

\#The guard is busy being robbed at the moment.
---
While I absolutely agree that adding more characters will *theoretically* be better. I disagree with it being "such a problem". 
---
Your entire post is full of assumptions, human error, hypothetical scenarios and just outright blaming Jagex without a shred of evidence.
---
I've already stated in your previous thread that the complexity of a password doesn't really matter against phishing, keyloggers, account sharing and compromised databases. Those are the main reasons people get their account hacked.
---
Bruteforcing rarely happens, if at all. Jagex already has measures against that by limiting login attempts. What Jagex does is simply limiting the amount of login attempts one can do. And at some point they'll just lock the entire account. (Which is what happened with Zezima a while back.)   
---
So even if they use a dictionary attack it will still take forever. There are over 600.000 words in the English dictionary alone. That excludes anything you modify to existing words, such as adding additional characters or numbers.    
---
Lets say that the maximum login attempts one can do is 100 an hour. That would still be over 6000 hours to go through the dictionary alone. Again, that is without any modifications. 
---
Not to mention that password length is much, much more important than password complexity. In fact, the whole "complex password" thing is a bit of an outdated concept. You know, the common password policy where you're forced to have all kinds of characters for "security reasons", which you'll always forget to remember because it's so damn complicated. 
---
As you should know as a password security expert. Forgetting passwords is a major security risk one and of its own. Because it is known that people will resort  to shorter passwords, reusing existing ones and start using obvious patterns much more often.
---
There is an additional issue when it comes to RuneScape. Because Jagex heavily relies on previous passwords in the recovery process to identify the account creator. It will be more difficult for the player to recover their own account, because they can't remember their previous passwords. Meanwhile, a hijacker isn't affected by that in the slightest, because they probably have your password saved in plaintext from a phishing link or from a third party's compromised database.
---
I think I'll just leave it here. There is more I wanted to write, but I can't be bothered anymore. This should more or less cover everything.
---
**tl;dr:** "Brute force attacks are rare and the vast, vast majority of RS account hijackings relate to phishing, sharing, social engineering or shared passwords. The predicted small impact on hijacking versus the cost of implementation means it's unlikely we will change anything short term.

what are you not convinced of lol? obviously not everybody can know everything

I mean they don‚Äôt cost anything for a small stat bonus so no reason not to

Yes Konar gives the most points out of any non-wildy slayer master, so it's recommended to take advantage of streak bonuses.

Runespan but with so many easyscape rewards. Why do we need this? No.
---
Of course, this is aimed at people not in a position to do so
---
Great answer! That's certainly very evident in combat.
---
Is there any difference in pathing between a player following a player while walking and a follower following a player specifically, though? Not sure of the specifics but they seem pretty similar. Followers obviously 1) teleport to you and 2) will get stuck on npcs where players won't
---
Equally password case sensitivity, length and not having symbols is not the reason for account breaches. Brute forcing isn't a thing on osrs as you have X amount of log in attempts before having to wait it out.
---
Also you can easily make an impossible to guess password with the current options available by swapping letters for numbers and vice versa.
---
I do think it could be made better there's no doubt about that, I just feel as though authenticator delay should be more of a priority.
---
Getting stuck behind one or these on a narrow road is the worst
---
They usually will let you pass, but the road being small it's kind of like "welp deal with it for now"
---
This has been talked about multiple times, and the more casual streams were more requested than the strict questions only streams. Plus they're more enjoyable to watch.

Use this to figure out what darts are worth using, keeping in mind that weaker darts make it harder to get that little bit of the way to an extra kill and result in more food/potion usage/banking frequency depending on your circumstances
---
Trying to flex your 30 def account with 3rd age?
---
When you say dragon, obsidian, etc, do you mean that I should get a complete set of the above? What should be done for capes/shields?
---
This whole post is disagreeing with your first point, I don't think it's good enough right now, and it's definitely not good enough compared to other games and online services that have user accounts.
---
Also, recovery questions being easy to guess is the same as brute forcing a password
---
Herblore is expensive because of the value lost by making potions, not because herbs are expensive. The price of a super restore, for example, is closely correlated with the price of a snapdragon. If you make snapdragons cheaper, super restores will become cheaper as well, and the cost of making a super restore won't change very much. Conversely, removing herb boxes from NMZ will increase the price of herbs but also that of the finished potions.
---
The only way to make herblore cheaper is to find some way to item-sink finished potions from the game.
---
Search the sack

[Here it is](https://i.redd.it/gd3sndi0m9631.jpg)
---
I agree with you entirely. The only reason I can‚Äôt think why this is, is because cooking you burn lots (especially at lower levels). I presume the extra xp you get for cooking is to compensate for the burn rate (I.e the lost xp).
---
Deathlover1??? Is that you bub??ü§£

so relatable

Can you even be mad though?  Who tf needs RNG with an inferno cape and a 1kc Zuk pet?  Just bank stand baby, you beat the game!
---
Gz man! 200m xp next?
---
The issue with this post is that you take the fact that passwords are case insensitive and use it to make assumptions about the rest of their account security practices. 
---
&gt; Jagex‚Äôs authentication system is extremely outdated
---
This really isn‚Äôt true. They have support for 2FA &amp; Authenticator which are modern security measures. Case insensitive passwords is a minor issue which really doesn‚Äôt matter in the grand scheme of account security
---
I think you‚Äôre just overestimating the team‚Äôs ability to be consistent.

Do you have to hit them up through discord first to get confirmed that you‚Äôre a zerk?
---
I am also a software developer and I just want to comment on a few things in this post. People do tend to focus on password requirements, i.e. length, complexity, etc., but this focus tends to be misplaced. Password complexity is not especially relevant for a game like RuneScape because login is behind an API server which a) limits number of attempts, and b) has a slow (&gt;100ms) response time which makes dictionary/bruteforce attacks ineffective. The point behind password complexity is in the off chance that somehow password hashes are leaked, they are still hard to break.

---

---
Yeah, but if herblore xp gets cheaper, more people will use the opportunity to train herblore, driving down the price of finished potions.
---
I'm sure it's not exactly 1:1 but herbs have fluctuated quite a lot over the last year (Ranarrs have gone from as high as 9.2k in October 2018 to today's low of 6.3k) and the cost of herblore xp has stayed roughly the same throughout this time, because the cost of finished potions has closely followed that of the herbs.

This wouldn‚Äôt cause the prices of the low cost pages to rise, they‚Äôd be the same. No one is going to pay 100k+ for a Guthix page.

This part makes the book useless in most situations and the ‚Äúgood‚Äù bonus (AKA OP) makes the monsters‚Äô overheads useless.

Appreciate you taking the time out to think of something new, but this shouldn‚Äôt be added to the game. Also, your comment earlier ‚Äúyou guys have no imagination‚Äù is really childish, I‚Äôd recommend just deleting that one.

Yeah pretty sure that was the intention too, unavoidable 1 hit mechanics are never fun though, they could at least make it telegraphed so you could move to avoid massive damage instead of just randomly getting 100 hp'd, it's not even just the damage combo but the fact she could just follow that up with another ~100 damage a few ticks later lol.

Hm. Yeah, I didn't think of it that way. I suppose regular construction companies are also hampered by OSHA/other regulations in ways that slow them down, too. If you designed those systems to hang from rafters instead of be in-ceiling or in-wall then maybe similar speeds could be achieved at an overall aesthetic loss - kind of how some larger big box stores / warehouses are built, maybe? Not my subject of expertise.
---
I assume you mean farming, not herblore :)
---
I would recommend definitely doing mahoganies twice a week, and fruit trees/calquat daily. Normal trees are very expensive relative to the xp you gain (\~10gp/xp) compared to mahoganies (\~2gp/xp) and fruit trees (&lt;1gp/xp).
---
I would also recommend doing herb runs, but thats more for money at your current level, not really for xp.
---
If you want to "actively" train farming, doing allotments is worth it, it'll definitely boost your xp per day. But if you just want to check it like once a day, you can still gain levels pretty quickly by just doing fruit trees and mahogs :)
---
Brilliant

Majority have. Even some that receive a check from Jamflex, like Ian (purespam) have RWTed in the past.
---
Because they could poll Herblore today and have it fail because it devalues someone's Strength Pot collection. They'd be polling the same community that actively votes against positive QoL because it "devalues" their account. The concept there is actually kinda funny when you think about it. Only attention whores care that their super special cape takes 20 hours less to get. People who actually value their achievements will still value said achievements just the same, regardless of game updates.

Dragon fire shield gives a str bonus and is defensive. When is it beneficial? When you want to increase your defence bonuses...
---
Lol enjoy logging back on to a 0 gp bank
---
Also if you die with it you lose all the bolts in it, unless they updated that.
---
Give this man a break with the downvotes, he actually didn't get it.
---
Because the game has amassed a metric fuck ton of content in the past years. It‚Äôs about time they hit the ‚Äúreset button‚Äù like RuneScape did. I think it has potential to be as great as OSRS if they do it right.

and then there's the type they make reality TV shows about
---
That‚Äôs what Reddit thought about the Underground pass poll as well but the results show a clear minority want the changes. Reddit isn‚Äôt the game as much as we think it is.
---
The Twitter answers are a shitshow anyway. Half of them didn't even open the document and the other half doesn't explain why they think its shit.
---
Bin warding and fix the servers
---
If you don't know them go watch their summer car series. That is what finally sucked me in.
---
I like the concept of banking downwards. Feels good.
---
Why do you have so many clockworks and birdhouses banked?
---
Why don't you store your seeds in the seed vault?
---
Also it's a small thing, but I crush my birds nests before I bank them at the end of a birdhouse run. Takes little time to do at the end of a run, and would make making brews faster when you train herb, imo.
---
bad
---
you do realize this is a suggestion right?
---
May I speak up as a player who is giving the feedback that I do want warding :)
---
Click any sketchy links recently? Double xp weekend or something?
---
Bossing
---
Congrats on the sex
---
Mod ash asked them not to so their app would show up higher on the store
---
Spoken like a true PHP programmer
---
Extremely shit. Combat interrupts the interface for switching bolts, so you have to be quick if its possible at all.
---
It stores up to 10k bolts but you lose all bolts inside it for any type of death. So have fun.
---
I'm 55 smithing and I need to get to 70 for questing. How much money should I expect to spend doing blast furnace? Is there a more cost effective way to train? Not looking for crazy profits, just not trying to spend my whole cash stack.
---
Nice!! I am doing the opposite of you actually. Got my strength up to 90, now working on getting Attack to 99. Congrats on the end of a grind!
---
Boil the hot dog water, bois
---
Well I'm not saying there's no gain, just that it's not something they need to prioritize. They limit login attempts so bruteforcing is currently not effective. Falling for things like phishing streams are how most new/low level people are getting hacked, they don't have gp to the point where people spend time trying to recover and probably just assume it's a real email or real login page. When people with money or high stats get hacked it's most likely through the recovery system. Password complexity effects none of these. No point spending time on something that wouldn't help in 99.999% of situations over things like auth removal delay, improving recovery system, etc.
---
because you get it from keldagrim

Scaling is wrong, cerberus is sooo much bigger than  that.
---
Do barbarian assault, fighter torso is pretty fast
---
I remember before the first stat squish, I played Death Knight just because I wanted to solo older raids. The game has just gotten so much worse since Mists
---
It didn‚Äôt get taken or stolen from you. You knew the risk. Take it as a lesson learned and move on
---
Could‚Äôve been better
---
The creators of the game itself are posting on Twitter to gauge reactions and ask for feedback. The comments aren‚Äôt constructive, nor is it really criticism. It‚Äôs just flaming because they have a spotlight. 
---
They have the best chance to change their mind right now, but instead are making a half-attempt at snark for other cynical people to share. 
---
I‚Äôd rather not worry about a toxic minority and engage with people who actually want a decent discussion on the topic.
---
That‚Äôs genius. Would save sooo much disk space lmao
---
Probably a random dude that commissioned it
---
"Runecraft is a difficult skill to change due to skill devaluing fears".
---
Can we, as the REEEing hivemind, reflect and realize that RC is complete ass to train and shouldnt have to be?
---
We're polling an entire new skill that would have worked as a perfect addition to RC.
---
Any year now they'll become blue checkmark internet personalities. Any year!
---
&gt; High Level Community community
---
But accounts with 1 defense cannot do the quest. I wish that one high level quest could be done with 1 defense would be cool content. It‚Äôs not game breaking.
---
Stay with me, and read my reply again. Here we go. You are not entitled to the rewards of a skill that you dont want to train. That includes the quest reqs and achievement diary rewards. Am I hard done by because I dislike Slayer and it has a level 90 req for elite diaries, 4 levels higher than the level 86 req rc has for its HIGHEST requirement? 
---
RC as a skill is fine. Not every skill has to train the same way, or have an afk method that "finishes" the skill. Lets look at slayer, for instance - using your logic.
---
Slayer as a skill feels have finished.
---
Go to slayer master
---
Get slayer task
---
Kill 140 monsters
---
Repeat. Boss slayer branches off of this slightly.
---
The community collectively not being fond of RC does not mean it should be changed any more than the community being collectively fond of Slayer meaning it shouldnt be changed. Neither of them should be changed. They're two of the most unique, interesting, and iconic skills the game has *because* they arent just another fishing or woodcutting or mining where you click and wait for 5 minutes. 
---
Don't train it if you don't want to. I'm sorry you have to get the diary reqs (which is why it's pretty horrendous game design that there are PvM inclined rewards gated behind skilling content), but you're just going to have to suck it up if you want the rewards they offer. Thats how it is for every single skill in the game and every single requirement in the game.
---
Ha! They even got the weird stack clipping that happens. If you guys ever get the itch, openrsc is free and a complete rsc vanilla private server. You make your own account without needing an email.
---
Skill overview
---
What is the skill in a nutshell?
---
Warding is a production skill that allows players to create various types of magical items, equipment and
---
tools that will aid the player in combat.
---
If you had 4 lines, how would you explain this to a player?
---
Warding is a fiercely old-school production skill in which players can create new and old magic armours,
---
ward equipment to make them stronger and create powerful buffs to Old School\&amp;#39;s mages to share and
---
devastate their foes. Harnessing the power of runestones, catching a wide variety of moths and
---
dissolving old, unneeded equipment are some of the steps to make you a master of Warding.
---
Harlem shake was such a great meme. And idk why, but I find ear rape hilarious üòÇ
---
Could be an idea worth looking into
---
docx
---
Did you just assume its file extension
---
oops
---
Lol it sounds like irl politics.
---
Yes it fucking would have lmao. When was the first time you heard about a community give a shit about a game so much that they all but abandoned the company to re-release an old version of the same game? 
---
Old School Runescape 2013
---
&gt;	When was the last time you saw them vote with their brain and the best interests of the game in mind? 
---
Approving theatre of Blood for Major PvM content, approving a grandmaster quest (song of the elves) with the Elven content, approving the forthos dungeon for mid tier content, preventing another wine of Zamorak spawn in the Wildy (lazy content), and changing the teleblock mechanics repeatedly to prevent it from being game breaking in the modern-Wildy meta. 
---
I can go on. 
---
&gt;	People made up their minds about warding months ago...
---
Proof that this makes up &gt;75% of the voting population? If not the result remain undecided. 
---
For example, I could just say: I am a person who knows one other person (u/BioMasterZap) thereby making us ‚Äúpeople‚Äù who have not made our minds up about warding, have reacted favorably to the rigorous process and drafts, and look forward to the next step while critiquing what‚Äôs been domes this far. 
---
&gt;	...nothing Jagex could ever do to refine it would matter - for any skill.
---
You assert this, but provide no examples, criticism, or imagination to substantiate your claim. 
---
In essence you‚Äôre appeal to an authority through the term ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and basing only off your experience blank-check claims like ‚Äúnothing jagex could ever do‚Äù and ‚Äúpeople made UK their minds months ago‚Äù while using strong swear words as if they make your communication more important or intimidating. (I would like to point out that I intentionally decided to use such words to demonstrate how I initially reacted to your post.)
---
Looking at your points, I agree there has been a broad sweep of negative sentiment (LOL idiots at jagex trying to ruin the game) in response to a concept sketch (outline for a school paper, not the final draft.) Then ‚Äúthe people‚Äù (whom you must spend a lot of time with) have needlessly extrapolated a final draft from these sketches, made a judgment, and refused to re-engage in any basis.   
---
Please do better, please have more compassion: please if you care about the longevity of the game care less about what ‚Äúthe people‚Äù want and more about what you believe is right for the game. Otherwise...I‚Äôm not sure why you spread such vehemence, I would like to hear why! I know how hard it is to propose something as vast as a new skill to a skeptical audience, and I‚Äôm not afraid of that. What does bother me is when people try to tell me: ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dumb have you seen what it‚Äôs like out there?‚Äù I know, but I‚Äôm not afraid.
---
10000 IQ
---
They probably want small exposure because they know it's cobbled notes and not ready for primetime yet.
---
I thought it was executed brilliantly, loved the sailing at the end, was not expecting that!!
---
Dragon dong scimitar
---
Again, I don't need anything from anyone. I enjoy the game as it is currently. Feel free to sit on your pedestal of "everyone NEEDS me, im so special :)" but most of us don't care about the skill one way or the other.
---
Hard to read something that people don't know exists. How many people in this thread alone would even know it existed if it wasn't re-posted to reddit. 
---
I'm sure all those meme posts on twitter are great feedback for the content development team.
---
As a "veteran" I'm really disappointed in how so many people don't like this perfectly old school skill. Sailing just seems like it'll be a side minigame a la dungeoneering, but warding just weaves into the base game so easily. 
---
Imo a new skill should mix with existing game mechanics, and I just can't see sailing doing that
---
I can smell it now..
---
Well I guess if that‚Äôs your first and only account you have even played on and the elitist view you have holds no value tbh. I pay mills for the same xp rates I could get in other skills because I‚Äôd rather do that then up rc the normal way and I calling him a bitch for just makes you look childish. 
---
You can make 1k of most runes and not even touch 25k xp earned. 
---
I‚Äôd love to see rc reworked so all the plebs can go make money like the real players instead of stand around in clan chats offing to run pure ess for 12-15k a trip.
---
If enough people are going to vote "no" without discussion, than it isnt worth wasting dev time on. It simply wont pass. 
---
In this case, saying a simple "no" is absolutely valid feedback, and listening to that feedback will ultimately save time and effort. 
---
The system is designed to make large scale changes to the game difficult. 
---
Jagex, and the "yes" camp are in the difficult position of convincing the "no" camp to vote yes. Calling them names isnt going to make them do so. 
---
Maybe nothing will, and that is ok too.
---
Still a better skill idea than Warding.
---
I knew exactly what was gonna happen but had to finish watching it. Loving the sailing icon as well lmao.
---
Neither is training defence to access more parts of the game. It is almost like it is a sandbox mmo where you can train everything so they encourage you to do that
---
But their auth is fine  it's people leaving their email wide open that is the problem
---
They have the best 2fa there is on RS it's the same thing as gmail
---
They're just completely different jobs. Content devs/artists can't help with account security
---
Someone didn't see that light
---
To runecrafting, more specifically. It's a great fit.
---
Game reassigns the value on certain amount of ticking. It‚Äôs constantly changing and no you cannot find out what yours is.
---
Damn, there's no avoiding that. *mayyyyybe* by adding a dose of sara brew to the combo foods might prolong it, but how do you even do anything other than give them a "gf" and tip your hat when they hit rng like that?
---
Really hope you get hacked for this lame attempt at a flex.
---
I like whiskey too!
---
I think it's on the right path but I have to say I totally understand where this is coming from. It's confusing and complex.
---
Awesome stuff, your fella is a lucky guy.
---
If it was so easy, Jagex would've done it 15 years ago.
---
It's not that difficult to make a system that bans all or at least most of the bots. But it's nearly impossible to make a system that doesn't ban any legit players in the process. If you want to make a visual problem that's hard for bots to solve, it's also going to be difficult for players with limited vision. Other types of problems can be difficult for colorblind or deaf players, people with limited motor control or non-native English speakers.
---
As for the rewards, I think the optimal way of getting items should be actually playing the game instead of doing random events.
---
The feedback before this though that was warding was too barebones and didn't have the content necessary to justify its existence as its own skill. Now it has too much content that's being "held hostage" from other skills? 
---
You can really use this logic for anything. Why have smithing when it could be a part of crafting? Why have fletching when it could also be a part of crafting? You're still just crafting stuff, right? Why have attack strength and defence when they could all just be a general "melee" stat? Wardings nature as a slightly deviant skill with enough unique content to justify its existence is the most oldschool aspect about it.
---
hooded fire cape...? i like it..a lot
---
Long time. As long as you got drop rates you'll make more
---
was your pin your birthday/year/some other 4 digit number you use in usernames/emails/anything about your life? if so odds are they just had you doxed and tried all those things and guessed right
---
Whataboutism at its finest
---
I feel like it will get more stuff cut off as feedback is taken in. By the time they have all the positive poll-passable stuff left, it'll be a chunk of content too small to become its own skill.
---
Will I get more xp per hour if I put it on normal ?
---
you think you do, but you don't

Some skills could‚Äôve been swapped around to make more sense. That‚Äôs all.

Petition to put hell cows in level 50 wilderness
---
You obviously do care. You care enough to continually attack those who are going to vote "no" as of now. 
---
And the "yes" camp absolutely does need the "no" camp. No matter how much you want to pretend that YOU are special. 
---
The 75% threshold was chosen for a reason. Ignoring it wont help the "yes" vote. 
---
Politics in runescape is just like politics IRL. You aren't going to get anywhere by ridiculing those voters whom you want support from. You need to coalition build for success.
---
At least be constructive. They're constantly updating it based on feedback.
---
I completely agree, I don't even understand how some people can setup name sniping bot
---
Wait so you‚Äôre saying FT 2 is no longer required???
---

---
I just don't want them to give up making new skills. I feel like they're gonna get convinced that OS shouldn't have new skills and stop making them. I don't want to play a time capsule.
---
nah
---
Making magic armor instead of buying it from a shop or getting it from a *shuffles deck, picks card* **gargoyle** makes sense.
---
I've never wanted something so much in my entire life.
---
Theres a reason that a) no one uses it b) most ppl don't know it exists
---
Lol the gp spent to get this rate.
---
I agree and understand. Warding is very complex.
---
Speak for yourself, I get the maximum download rate for my internet from steam, ~200mbps.
---
Step into my van, I'll show you
---
Who voted for this shit
---
It's the same in every game. Some folks think that everything in the game is worked on by the same people and they single-file work on a single thing at a time. Any time spent on X is taking away from Y.
---
When the reality is as you described, outside of some small indie games where a handful of people work on every part of the game.
---
You should start using ultracompost on them. I normally get 7+

What are yalls thoughts on an option to tie an irl ID to your account for security purposes like blizzard does?
---
It's not required of course, but then people that get hacked can lock their accounts and then fax their ID to prove ownership and unlock their account.
---
I know a lot of people would be willing to go through the "hassle" to make sure their account is basically 100% secure.
---
This would add an option to stop false recoverys and auth removal from emails. Any type of account security change such as removing auth would require ID.
---
Or 1000 bolts
---
Milking level?
---
Walk is 1 tile/tick, run is 2 tiles/tick. She either goes at 1 or 2 tiles/tick. She's slower than you running, therefore she goes at 1 tile/tick, or a walk, and is the same speed as any npc

Is there any plans to rework the Tithe Farm rewards in order to make Wines instead of tele grabbing?
---
Recently you added a new Zamorak Wine spawn in Wildy, but it just felt a lazy implementation since it won't add anything of value to Pking.

Please make a diarrhea cape

---
Ban players that buy gold. Simple
---
I think bots could figure out the captcha in RuneScape Classic for the fatigue system. Good idea but wouldn't work
---
Rcing is monotonous grind, every wave of inferno past 21 is a fun puzzle to solve, using your mechanics and positioning. Not really an apt comparison.

So it takes no talent just time and you want to remove that aspect and make it require nothing

For the sake of transparency, here are the two documents I made &amp; gave back to the OSRS team based on the first version 3 draft they sent me a few weeks ago. Hopefully they won‚Äôt mind me sharing them now seeing as it‚Äôs pretty much all public.

](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YdcNj3T2dsF0BWCW-5l7iZayuKYBTXIgaAPLwy3F6sQ/edit?usp=sharing)
---
The big things I discussed were ideas of a hybrid Warding/Runecraft activity &amp; guild. I‚Äôm really curious to know what some folks think of that. To me, a big, big thing that Warding is missing is both a truly interesting selling point &amp; having it overly swamping over Runecrafting‚Äôs territory (amongst other skills). It‚Äôs all well &amp; good looking &amp; feeling ‚Äútraditional‚Äù but I do think it has to be doing something special, and by including Runecrafting more heavily too you prevent that skill from being left in the dirt as a magical-support skill, and instead give them both a decent sense of parity. 
---
Even after all of that I still have my own strong reservations on Warding as a whole, but it‚Äôs certainly interesting to see it evolve &amp; shift. Curious to see what the overall sentiment is within the wider community &amp; where things go from here. 
---
(And obviously thanks to the OSRS team for reaching out in search of more feedback, in spite of my own negativity on the topic).
---
&gt; On /r/2007scape "Diversity" is just a dog whistle for "make a skilling method with 90% of the effort cut out but keep 90% of the exp rates of normal methods".
---
 lmfao so true
---
Yeah it's not super rare like other 3rd age.
---
Kraken? Stuff is delicious
---
Eh its not something that needs to be a quest reward. Its not something that bots abuse and it not like the item didn't already exist. Its in the same realm as the iban's staff, where you just pay someone to upgrade it once you already have it.
---
Always! It's my favourite
---
Not to make a slippery slope argument, but how long can that attitude keep the game alive?
---
If the only reasoning for a no vote is ‚Äúbecause no‚Äù, how will Jagex know what to add? It‚Äôs not fair to say they can‚Äôt add good content if the only feedback they get is a binary ‚Äúyes/no‚Äù with no additional opinions. Especially on a huge effort from a small team, knowing what to fix going forward will be much easier if there are realistic expectations instead of ‚Äúmake new things that aren‚Äôt x‚Äù. 
---
I‚Äôll keep playing this game for a while if things don‚Äôt get added, but not forever. I might be alone in that, but I highly doubt I am. If the 25% doesn‚Äôt give an idea of what they would vote yes on, then I think OSRS will become stagnant. If that happens, either it dies a slow death with people like me leaving, or Jagex tries to force an update as a last ditch effort, and the game is killed. 
---
The updates are already hard wired to make new content ridiculously difficult to pass. I guess I just don‚Äôt understand why adding more layers of difficulty is seen as a valid argument.
---
"public safety concerns"
---
who said its coming soon?
---
I agree, its agility with extra steps and no real rewards to training it. Yes it provides runes, but lets be real. You can get runes from shops or drops while making much more money and buying even more runes. There are very few people out there training runecrafting for any other reason than requirements or maxing. Its a meme, sure, but rooted in the opinion that many people hate the skill in itself. What other reason are we polling changes than to help improve the game in a way that a **majority** of the players want.
---
Sometimes you have to devalue older methods of gaining xp. Its part of playing a game that has a dev team that updates it. People complained about wintertodt, and I still think it has ridiculous rewards for what it is, but it added a sensible way to make firemaking not seem like some stupid skill thats just arbitrary to maxing. That, to me, is also how runecrafting feels.
---
sure it is, because they're both ridiculously tedious grinds that people enjoy for their own various self loathings.
---
We're like twins! I just started farming this month at ~1650 Total LOL
---
I get kingdom seeds / nests from maple log collection. If you fletch the logs into unstrung longs and sell 50 at a time to legends guild general store then you make a very small profit. 
---
So 10 workers on on herb is my standard and then the other 5 on fish or maples.
---
I don't do herb runs either, the kingdom does a fantastic job of keeping my herb stacks full. 
---
I camp the shit out of that giant seaweed patch though, I love that part lf fossil island. 
---
I don't have graceful :( cant stand agility. lol I brought that up to be snow flakey
---
I'll give the bird houses a try, you talked me into it and I've been meaning to see the rest of fossil island anyways. 
---
Serious question: i have 43 hunter. So maple houses. I can cut / craft / fletch magic logs. 
---
Is it worth it to grind my hunter up to the yew or magic house levels before I start doing runs or should I just do maples? 
---
I'm assuming there is a difference in quality and quantity of seeds? 
---
Add me if you want. RSN: Slazket
---
rs3 bad osrs good
---
That's actually dope dude. Good work.
---
This is a moo'd
---
Ayyy my dude brothergreed getting litty
---
someone call up the r/neverbrokenabone boys, they'll certainly appreciate this
---
Not sadly, people were griefing and dosing other people to get their items, also the servers dont work most of the time and it would be real unfun to lose your bank to a DC'd server
---
This makes me moist
---
Can spirit seeds be made tradeable? Its a bit annoying when they just stack up in the bank and you can't do anything with them.
---
I think I like it, but removing the farming element really seems like a misstep to me, was actually a portion I looked forward to
---
Thank you for using my simple example that took me 5 seconds to come up with as a strawman.  First off - we aren't talking about a pure "what is this image" problem.  We are talking about the more complex problem where first they have to figure out what the containers of images are, then find where the containers are, and then identify the image.  All of which can be made even more difficult by the fact that Runescape has unique objects in the game that won't have any training data - which can be mixed in from a container, general scenery, and pure image recognition standpoint.  This all narrows down the pool of data that is available and makes this a more difficult problem to solve quickly.
---
It's not only whether or not the problem can be solved, but how much effort it takes.  Following the model of most encryption.
---
But once again - this is me as a more casual programmer thinking up scenarios which could have tons of iterations.  There are plenty of other options.
---
&gt;for "only" ~50m Rigour is an absolute steal
---
Can confirm, basically spent my bank on it a few months ago and it has helped so much.
---
That's ok
---
Zulrah and Free to play apparently brought the game a looot more players when it was about to die out.
---
Keep thinking like that if you wish, not like that mindset can be changed anyway.
---
&gt; people on here dont have any fucking clue how botting works
---
including yourself it seems
---
Lucky enough to get the squirrel at 47 agility, Heron at 69 fishing and Skotos at 6kc
---
I‚Äôd bet your opinion would change if things went south for your account.  It could happen to any of us, even if we think our security is top notch.  Additionally, there are protections against phishing, such as proper two-factor authentication WITH A DELAY TO DISABLE.

I think having the slayer masters sat around a taven table drinking and making merry would be a cute image.
---
&gt; Either the chaos temple couldn‚Äôt exist or it has to be in the wilderness. 
---
Chaos temple **SHOULDN'T** exist. That's the problem. Something that basically cuts the price in half of what is meant to be an extremely expensive skill is blatantly OP and has no reason to be in the game. It's some RS3 shit that they slapped in the wilderness in order to bait people there for pker's so they can say "see pking isn't dead look at all this content!"
---
OP knows what he's talking about..
---
Point #1 (Leak DB's) is how i got my pure hacked a couple of months ago even though the leak happened on a random website i registered on several years ago (i know this is how i got hacked since i got an email warning me about their DB being leaked). It only took the ''hacker'' two days to gain access to my pure which i know because i changed my password to the old one (same that got leaked) two days prior to the account being cleaned.
---
Luckily i had transfered the big majority of my bank onto my main and only lost 10ish M.
---
Stay safe scapers.
---
Can the Thammaron's sceptre be buffed? Having its own built in spell(only usable in the wild) and giving it a special effect that gives a chance to ignore magic defence are a few ideas.
---
&gt; I havent seen anyone ever support the skill itself
---
You're not looking at all then, because the general consensus of the feedback has always been the concept of the skill is solid, they just need to refine it before bringing it to a poll.
---
&gt;legend‚Äôs cape
---
&gt;can‚Äôt do it
---
Wut lol
---
With runecrafting, it's not just about rates, it's also about annoyance and anon-fkability multiplied by remembering it worse than it is. Some people enjoyed leveling runecrafting because nobody enjoys leveling it, and making it less tedious to level would devalue it to them.
---
Plus, there's the other reason that they didn't mention, 13m exp allows for more items to be dissolved than just 10m exp or whatever.
---
Yay love this series
---
Congratulations man. I remeber how many times I tried that fight on mobile. I got it though on the 4th go around. Let's hope it didn't take you that many. Well done!
---
That‚Äôs the trimmed version
---
Lmao I thought the bucket was on the cape lol
---

It's telling you the cost of one hour of time saved by using the stronger darts over the weaker ones. So yeah, I guess going strictly by that it's not worth using addy darts at Vorkath, but I still feel like it doesn't take into account the increased banking frequency and cost of supplies per hour.
---
If I were you, I'd try out both and see which seems to get you better GP/h.
---
Can't even recognize how dumb you sound so you say something just as dumb. Man it's no wonder Reddit is never right about shit.
---
Meh
---
Congrats you are now a mod of r/neverbrokeabone
---
&gt;a q p  
---
&gt;

&gt;w
---
Look what you've done! You've distracted our precious mods from working on an authenticator delay.
---
Lezz make this happen. Need some new and exciting ranging gear
---
This will completely destroy the milk meta.  Big risk of power creep: what‚Äôs next rune milk, dragon milk, barrows milk?
---
yeah demonic gorrilas are fun and great money even better with a little luck shards are only 1/300
---
This argument hurts me so much... Like the game has changed SOOOO much from when it first came out, but people still act as if any new update will ruin it. Keep vigilant for ACTUAL bad updates like Battlewards or MTX, or Double XP Weekends, but be mindful that not every QOL update is EZScape
---
Yeah RC is holding me back from base 70s!
---
Don‚Äôt die :^)
---
You might check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov15yKrazGk) and then read [this blog](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/warding-design-blog?oldschool=1)
---
Note that the information there might not be entirely accurate anymore as this is the third redesign based on player feedback.
---
Someone tell me why he caught 30,000 horned Graahk so I don't have to watch the shitty video.
---
Always nice to see love for one's siblings(even if his skill of choice is basic-af).
---
Magic equivalent of crafting and smithing. Runecrafting is more the magic equivalent to fletching.
---
Who tf silver'd that
---
Looking good. Though you should shake the dust off your dscimmy :p
---
Lame attempt to promote you/your friend 
---
You/he will never be popular
---
Lmfao same guy in another thread saying dumb shit. No one really cares about the death mechanics going back as long as people don't purposefully ddos to steal your items. You must not have played when it was bad as you have such a dog shit opinion without knowing the situation at all.
---
You need to attempt to get it from one of the other 20 people that still play on world 45
---
If anyone has some low level gear I can purchase please let me know !
---
Just gagged a little bit on my sandwich
---
This is twitter, do you really expect people to be able to write anything meaningful in 280 characters?
---
As a bug or intended feature?
---
these belong to someone who deserves them.
---
Needs a tl;dr
---
How‚Äôre they gonna get your mom all the way up to 50 wild?
---
Um yes they did? There was no slayer rewards at the start of osrs.
---
Why are you telling me to spread love when you were rude to me first, completely unprovoked. Are you being serious right now? Also why you ignore my response to your dumb accusation regarding egocentric bias?
---
im not sure, but the odds are too damn high
---
blessed d hide
---
Thats a terrible answer. You didn‚Äôt answer OPs question in regards to when it‚Äôs more worthwhile to be more offensive or more defensive. In many cases you will have more survivability in pvm when you focus on offensive bonuses.
---
So to OPs question, many people will duo or trio a godwars boss. Only one player takes the roll of the tank and will use gear with more derisive stats than their teammates. For most solo bosses you will still use defender bc you need to kill it faster. Things with dragonfire you will probably use DFS. Spectral shield is BIS for Cerberus and DKs.
---
It's faqqot month once again
---
69. HEY OH
---
So like 90% of that is all in the 100 spectacles and phat combo..
---
Someone has a different opinion, must be a brainlet. Real nice argument bud, and I‚Äôm the stupid one?
---
Its a solid concept that needed refining.
---
Did someone actually say this
---
Yea. Fuckin panic!
---
How are you a pure if your wearing the slayer helm?
---
test
---
I switched to addy and kills have definitely been generally faster, so I think I'll just stick with them for a while. The DPS margin increases as I get better gear and range lvls too.
---
Look forward to this everytime
---
He‚Äôs here to make the sub disgusting and vile.
---
The runecrafting made me giggle
---
Until you can get Spectral shield or DFS, I think some people use the crystal shield for its high ranged defense at DKs
---
Its rng
---
Blessed d'hide
---
Archer ring

Completely random. Make sure you kill the ORANGE 360 last this is where had will spawn and get ready to watch his tootsies
---
The password (among its variants) I use for basically everything is one that I created back in 2004 for Runescape, and surprisingly my runescape account is pretty much the only account so far that hasn't been hacked yet and I have never needed to change it in the last 15 years despite basically everything else having needed a change at least once.

Sorry for the ultra late reply, I was trying to source this. It turns out I read it on the RDA guide and unfortunately it isn't accurate: https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1143065925597519872?s=19
---
Luckily, I've only said it like.... 50 times... so... oops?

Took me a few tries and that was on pc. Props to you on mobile

Just look at his username, it checks out.
---
I‚Äôm only 4b exp from becoming the 2nd person as well!
---
Ohhhh so that's why people kept yelling OFF OFFF OFFFFFF at ardy bank the other day, and then eventually world hopped.
---
Never understood why the splasher couldn't just re-aggro but now it all makes sense.
---
Bring a d spear and mess with pkers at the door by juking them. Its fun
---
I struggle to think of another example.
---
Dungeoneering please jagex ty
---
Honestly loving how its coming along and glad to see its not a mess like the first thing we got was. But My issues here are really only with the rune crafting touches. As if you introduce the proposed changes in theory anyone will have access to all spells at once with the new combo runes and the 4 slot rune pouch which would be very devastating across the board especially for things like raids where if i sacrifice one spot and bring a mage cape you're team can rotate through veng barrage and pot share within that rune pouch
---
try getting 2 in one task
---
oh no you killed something and got 35k
---
Yikes, 2400 kc deep 2 claws 0 pets but boy do I got heads and tails for daaaays.
---
Kind of sad how people can glitch these wilderness bosses still to this day, especially when you consider how many years they've been out for.
---
I still have 0 pets in this game :(
---
Can‚Äôt alch my account I haven‚Äôt got 55 mage
---
If you think you have a handle on all the monsters through the mage then justiciar is best imo, some people say just ancestral the whole way but I have been liking justiciar personally
---
Lost over 60M total bank value, even though i made over 5M these past two weeks...
---
Shit has me not wanting to play anymore, one slayer task took me two weeks to do since 0 motivation..
---
Fuck your garbage ass gtfo
---
Dairy caves confirmed
---
So he could catch your fat mom.
---
Alternative thread title: anyone want to throw away some GP so I don‚Äôt have to?
---
Perhaps just removing prayer from it entirely lol
---
It's tedious bud. I'm sorry that me not liking it hurts you and I sure am glad that you don't care about this btw.
---
Doubtful
---
ok stop milkin it
---
i like to call it summer time sadness
---
I feel you man, I used to think RC was the worst, after 77 its not bad at all.  Nice passive money maker too, agility is the real evil
---
10 m
---
Nope. Died yesterday going for rune x bow
---
So basically you don't want to learn how to PvP, you want a PvP minigame that is as profitable as Vorkath.
---
Yay
---
&gt;  I always thought the first new skill in osrs would be adventurous and fun, yet all I see is a similar grind to old skills for at best a couple perks
---
I would have hoped for the same, but I think after Sailing failed with a large part of the criticism being that it felt more like a minigame than a skill, they've gone back to more traditional style skills. And I can't say I blame them. I'd love a skill like Exploration or similar, but there is no way to do that kind of skill justice without it deviating from the normal grind.
---
Thanks so much for the advice!!!!
---
Ikr. It's a hard living
---
Sit.
---
Again if people don‚Äôt like the inferno I can understand, but tedious is not a fair criticism
---
can confirm
---
U can do wdr raid, usually takes 20-25min, and after u can log off again
---
Sounds fun
---
Even if you don't have dhcb, vorkath is almost certainly one of the best money makers available to you. If you're even remotely considering profit in your slayer the #1 top priority is vorkath. 2nd is gorillas. Don't even briefly consider any boss tasks or the regular loot from any monsters before vorkath lol
---
Can you please ELI1
---
This was a great video Verf. It seems like every new video you put out becomes my favourite in the series.
---
I'd argue making lava runes efficiently is much harder than 3t fishing or 1 tick prayer training
---
Addiction
---
We are all men of culture
---
Pretty cool I upvote
---
I'd vote for that
---
I hate you and love you
---
Lol.
---
I‚Äôve got 4, but they were all random. Not the ones I was grinding for.
---
Bitch you already borderline suicidal doing it why bother with safety at that point
---
Yes I can and yes I do, fuck you buddy
---
Lol, you think that‚Äôs how it works. You dumb dumb micro penis child
---
To be fair you don't really NEED the elite diaries for anything besides convenience
---
And all content I see from you gets an auto down vote so smd
---
Hell ya. Ive been waiting for a better teleport to my training spot
---
but do you really need luck anymore
---
You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You know nothing about project management, you know nothing about software development.
---
The case cost of a shot from the blowpipe- any dart- is 2/3 of a scale. So like 120 ish atm. The darts only actually cost 20% of their price cuz of assembler. So in truth, going from mith to addy only very slightly raises the cost per shot
---
Exactly. The order makes zero fucking sense
---
Try logging into all the emails you've used
---
I think RC is fine as is, would be nice if they added more rewards to the later levels.  If you don't like it don't train it, theres a lot more for you to do besides runecraft
---
Why? It's going to show up as 200m in the highscores regardless of this, and first person will always stay the first unless they get banned.
---
You have heard of Google?
---
Probably by milking cows
---
Alternatively: Anyone in the same boat that I am and want to save both of us money?
---
 
---
You're clearly not interested in anything resembling good faith so that'll be a block.  Good luck with whatever is making you the way you are.
---
I can't even tell if you're serious or not
---
No never used the internet
---
First, how can you convince Jagex you didn't sell the name?  They won't refund it since they can't prove you didn't.
---
Secondly, everyone should be aware that any name worth 500M+ on the RSN market is being watched actively by bot scripts which will, around 20% of the time, snipe it faster than you can transfer/sell it.
---
True. Didn't think about that. My apologies milk man
---
Couldn't they just make it all the same level and model?
---
The rune javelin drop is 1 in 82k. Just commenting on how crazy of a drop it is lul
---
Good
---
Bis
---
&gt; In a Java app like the client there isn't as much disjointness between "frontend" and "backend" like in the web.  
---
There absolutely is. Content developers don't write Java, they write RuneScript. A proprietary in-house scripting language.  
---
&gt;  Take a look at the Runelite source, the display code is dwarfed by more "backend-y" stuff. 
---
You can't compare working on RuneLite to working on the actual OSRS client. They're an entirely different process, especially when working on content.  
---
&gt; Anyone working on the client could also work on the engine, provided they've had time to get up to speed with its architecture.  
---
You seem to have it in your head that there are 'client devs' and 'engine devs'. The engine is part of the client and the server, it's what allows content developers to add and modify CONTENT through RuneScript.
---
I get what you‚Äôre trying to say, but I don‚Äôt think something taking a lot of time automatically meams it‚Äôs difficult
---
Keep at it... says the guy with 45 kc lolololol
---
I simply don‚Äôt want this skill. I think it‚Äôs great that they‚Äôre open to all the user feedback and that they‚Äôre clearly putting a lot of time into the skill, but I‚Äôd much rather them try to fix crafting and the current game before adding a new plethora of confusion. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love welcoming new content, but a new skill is absolutely game changing and could potentially have a huge impact on the game we‚Äôre used to. I don‚Äôt think it will be a good impact.
---
Nice title length
