Ehhh. The Western Provenances is fuckin huge. It covers everything from Pest Control to Piscarillius. Makes sense to break it up. The desert doesn't cover nearly as large of an area and it's got less content.

Oh nothing. Speaks volumes.
---
OP is likely referring to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bmw5wv/add_a_combat_or_quest_requirement_to_enter_rev)
---

---
Op doesn't realize the irony of his complaint, because he just latched on to one of the suggestions,  not the main idea (which was to limit scouting bots in  rev caves)
---
That's a nice way to remember what it means in the context of gaming, I guess, but that's not the meaning of *meta*, that's just a backronym.
---
Why is everyone so obsessed with agility getting variety when nearly every other skill unlocks their meta training method at like....level 40-50?
---
Agility is actually one of the most varried skills when it comes to power training it.
---
It's on the Prifddinas map on the online thread

Idk, seems out of place...

Sorry man, got it the other day checking a mahogany at 93 farming
---
How so?t Because they have 8 elven clans, most of which was already established in lore? Because they both expand Crystal equipment? The similarities are mostly surface level and some aren't even that far. The only thing in the new Dev Blog that feels even remotely similar to RS3 are the Divine Potions, but they are nothing like RS3's Combination Potions; they are just a different type of potion we learn from the potion clan. I suppose the Crystal Impling is also an RS3 thing, even if its purpose differs in OSRS. But aside from those, there really isn't much.
---
There are no serenity posts, harps, seren stones, resource dungeons, harmony pillars, waterfall fishing, max guild, voice of seren, GE, or any of the other notable features of RS3 Prif. And the majority of what is in the Dev Blog are things the community asked for.
---
I'm not sure he cares either way tbh

Suggestion: make all slayer xp past 200m go into agility.

Why would these bots have more than just the two weeks of bond?

I don‚Äôt even know what that is ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

As long as it‚Äôs 1-1 I think you‚Äôd be safe.

Damage is calculated on the tick it is given, or when a projectile is sent in some cases(this is on hit). It calculates 71 damage or whatever his hp is which should kill him, but he eats on the same game tick healing himself and preventing death

Had this account for about a week roughly, been seeing a fair amount of drop posts recently so I figured I'd add my account's contribution.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This was about a couple or few days ago. I used Iban Blast on the melee brothers and melee'd Ahrim with base 60 melee stats, but I know better now and I've just hit 70 Range. Now to train Mage to 75 for Zulrah! :P
---
Got a 15 year old account.. never been hacked. The secret is not being a dumbaass

No problem it's happened to me before too!

I sure hope you're not chopping away at your junk when offline. Damn.

Seeyou tomorrow
---
Lol why would I waste my time doing that
---
Lol not sure if that's a man or a woman....but that ain't woox haha
---
Underrated how good that game is.
---
How do you get the life points on the bar and prayer on right?
---
Zero because I‚Äôm not a nerd that sits around playing video games all day. It only takes me one run to the bar to find a skinny bitch to come back to my place and spread eagle on the sofa for my fat dick. You ever touch a pussy before, virg?
---
Only 3 items over drop rate, but gratz.
---
First level was with mystic, next 3 with ahrims, and last level with initiate because all you really need is the pray bonus. Definitely use an occult necklace though for the added damage.
---
Or just leave the cannon on the ground shooting. You don't lose your cannon if you don't pick it up. Just go to the dwarf cannon guy near ice mountain and reclaim it from him
---
Load it up with as much money as possible, just save yourself enough cash to function in F2P and be able to buy a Bond when you come back.
---
Honestly same, and I'm normally the one for that kinda stuff but it just doesn't work in this game.
---
Now I would love more (thematic) cosmetics, but transmog would be terrible in this game.
---
The diary rewards seem a little lean, maybe add:   
---
Hard:   
---
5% Increased XP from Zalcano   
---
Increased rewards from crystal chest    
---
Elite:   
---
10% increased XP from Zalcano    
---
Crystal Butterfly Net (20% increased chance to catch implings)   
---
*Shouldn't degrade, or buff the chance/boost hunter level and have charges
---
Other than dragons and ToB where is Rapier &lt; Lance/Tent? I kinda disagree (unless missing something) that rapier is a a really bad place. 
---
Agree though, this sword is better cause of slash.
---
thats alot for just a few k hunter xp. you would do better if you did herbiboar for a few hours
---
It's not
---
I know this is probably common sense for a lot of people, but I only recently learned that you don't necessarily need high Agility to do Underground Pass. I did it on my new account with 34 Agility and using Agility potions. That being said, I did die once and lose a bit of money from misclicking a trap -\_-

New players:

* Do Romeo and Juliet, Cook's Assistant, and Sheep Shearer to quickly obtain 7 Quest Points and get immediate sell access to the list of protected items on the Grand Exchange.
---
* Don't bury your bones! Instead, use a public house in the House Party world. Using your bones on their altar yields a free +350% Prayer experience multiplier, and it's automatic! Un-note bones using Phials nearby.
---
* To cheaply train Crafting, buy a glass blowing pipe and some molten glass. Experience rates are roughly 90-100k an hour, it requires very little attention, and the cost per experience is around 1-3gp.

Second place record*

Iron men:

* If you want food and thieving xp, go right to Ardougne via the Edgeville wilderness lever (NOT HARDCORES). There's a man upstairs in the estate shop you can get exp on until you reach cake stalls. Spend the money you pickpocket on cheap food from the cake seller.

Did you talk to Oziach?

Reposting your own content when its been over a year isnt a big deal

use me
---
That's nuts man. Anyone know the chance of this?!?
---
The weaker wyverns are actually not a bad task if you use venom and a whip
---
The diary rewards look incredibly crude and not very good at all. Especially considering how they will be harder than other diaries.
---
i think its hilarious ur talking shit about them. u wouldnt say this shit to them at the ge, theyre maxed. not only that but they wear the freshest bis gear, eat at the chillest pubs and hang out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol
---
Doesn't make the 59 pray any less useless.
---
If I pay, am I therefore gay?
---
You still left about 100 pixels of your slayer skill. Thanks for the account kid, better luck next time
---
Those servers were not even remotely close to the popularity of Nostalrius. Nost had tens of thousands of active players.
---
I got stupidly reeled into a phishing scam the other week, and the only reason I know what it was from, was because they sent me my non case sensitive runescape password as the email subject
---
I bet this idiot didn't change his pin after the first time
---
It still makes no sense to make the new imbues take significantly longer to do. Currently its 20k nmz points. Which take like 2 minutes to get.

It's so catchy it's already glued to my head. Plz add this song to wc guild

It's a D scim but crush, which I love as my pure doesn't have to complete mm and can keep the tunnels open til max range/mage. Also, training with it in the wild is insane exp. Was getting 90k/h with 60att 70 str and no boosting prayers
---
&gt;In a car right now, can someone do the math and figure out how many rune ores that some of these bots have mined?
---
375k ish if they're at 50m mining xp and they started at 85 which is something stupid like 4b GP
---
Pretty sure there‚Äôs no way you could have an account reset, unless a jmod did it for something but seems unlikely given your post.
---
More than likely you‚Äôve accidentally logged into the wrong account somehow
---
2 kc and 1 cape gamble btw
---
What‚Äôs unplayable?
---
Still this is an extremely unheard of practice in today‚Äôs age of internet security lol
---
50-80k risk isn't much still tbh. That's what you risk 1 Def PKing to learn the basics for the reason that it's the cheapest form of PKing. 
---
I'm against the P2P/W version of protection on all total worlds but everything else you've listed seems part of revs. The only fix I'd suggest is having an account risk X amount to get in, just like the old EP system if bots are what's ruining it for people. At least then killing the bot would become meta for people.
---
Make the armor/tools/specific crystal seeds untradable.
---
Make the crystal shard, the ones you charge items with, tradeble.
---
This makes it that no one is essentially "forced" to charge their items.
---
Yo my name's spagehtti too
---
They've said they don't want to make the mistake of extremes/ovls again and lock combat/pvm behind skilling. As in then it'd be a requirement for you to have these other skills to do pvm.
---
If you‚Äôve been hacked multiple times through bank pin and authenticator you are the one responsible. It‚Äôs the hard truth but this is all on you

Don't they fall into the gold farming category?

Nor can we have special characters
---
Cheating yourself out of REM sleep is extremely dangerous over long periods of time. This is very unhealthy, please don't be serious.
---
Don't let hourlies consume you.

Nah. The 99 crafting cape already makes it so you don't need the fally diary to use the bank in the guild so there is that precedent

"I will scam the scammer"

Did you find that you get pked alot ? I usually bring blowbpipe to fanatic and get pked maybe inbetween 5-10 kills. Or do you hop after every couple kills

What he's saying is Mod Acorn is actually a Venezuelan spy planted inside Jagex to ensure the security of their gold farmers. 
---
The farmers bankroll a secrete Venezuelan political movement which will soon enact a coup and take the country, Mod Acorn has been promised first lady of Venezuela for her service.
---
Or not. Who knows.

I feel like accident, hilarious anyway

Dude nice mith plate drop.
---
Runelite has a pro version? What the heck
---
They're not going to do anything yet until it's polled, they're just changing the underlying code so they have the option to add shit to it in the future in case people do want certain features.
---
They definitely do and they definitely deserve it
---
Sr Swap is legit, swapped 1400m rs3 to 07 with them
---
If it wasn't some combat buff then yeah sure
---
step 1 move to venezuela
---
step 2 slay green dragons
---
step 3 profit
---
Sr Swap is trusted as far as I know. Been in their clan and used them for mils of swaps from 07
---
That but also look into smithing cannonballs. Both are pretty similar in profit. Cannonballs might be better now. And it takes twice as long to do an inv of cannonballs so it‚Äôs more afk
---
Chip chop chip.
---
I never said that, I just said changing quests to cater to them seems kinda dumb to me. Pures aren‚Äôt an official game mode, it‚Äôs a person choosing to limit their account.
---
It‚Äôs possible you may have created an account in the past without remembering it. Not sure how the authenticator could be tied in, possibly you added it when creating it or maybe it‚Äôs linked somehow (not sure)
---
You need at least 77 rc to fight jad sorry man
---
It‚Äôs a good way to talk down to someone
---
Jagex security is pretty garbage though to be fair. Also the system does favor hackers who can get into account and sell everything in minutes without any kind of delay whatsoever.
---
You'll get it at 6789 like I guessed, just watch :)
---
Why not just buff the crystal bow? It feels like it would be obvious to run this with it so why not buff the only bow it works with instead of adding an item?
---
Trimmed quest cape time fam
---
What are all three for the unassociated?
---
Tassets and bcp are last. Use prosy top and v skirt. Use piety, it seems dear but you easily make the money back and it's like 25% faster. I highly reccomend getting an sgs as soon as you can afford it
---
Dude, that's too complicated for some people.
---

Thats insane luck, gz!

JFC I know these people.
---
Agility is pretty aids but it at least has its staple as being uncheat-able via buyables, and it having some degree of function passively.
---
RC by all means in the community has its reputation as "the aids skill"- on paper it seems like you wouldn't want an "aids skill" to exist, but RC doesn't truly serve much purpose beyond a sort of bragging right for your level of patience.
---
Like if that's what it's always been famous for, I think it's totally reasonable to argue that the rates shouldn't be tremendously increased.
---
Personally I find RC a bit more enjoyable passively than agility, due to the variety of viable training methods RC offers each with exaggerated pros and cons. Agility is really only a handful of basically the same exp rate, sans Werewolf which is an annoying amount of concentration (not a lot, but not "little enough to brain afk") for some payoff- then when you hit 90 it's literally nothing but Ardy till 99 no questions asked.
---
Boy, you've got some insecurity issues.

---
The counter is I really don't see any point in using myself. I've never had a crystal bow, I prefer crossbows and if I have to use a bow I just use the magic short. For how little I use a bow I can't see a reason to spend time/money on a crystal.
---
i'm glad my adorable little bunnies are getting the recognition they deserve &lt;3

whats the prifddinas agility course you're talking about? I cant find any info about it

Thank you my guy and yes so far the people I‚Äôve talked to have all been really nice and helped me a lot on what quests I should be doing first

---
imagine just being a jmod trying to go about your daily life, you leave work, go on your favorite banter subreddit...and this is what you see
---
Decent point. I think you could change the color of the shots, if a visual difference really was needed though? 
---
I am kinda torn on if I'd want it in the ammo or cape slot. Ammo slot makes sense because the bow doesn't use ammo anyway and it empowers it or whatever. Cape slot it'd probably be cool fashinscape. You'd lose assembler str bonus though.
---
They're popular because they're cheap and easy to empty and reroll with pot.

Craws bow

All rules are made up

i play social ironman.. i don‚Äôt talk to anyone cause 90% of people in this game are trying to scam you for your account
---
I have an untrimmed agility cape.
---
By all means disrupt the fucking rooftop meta. I like the idea of Werewolf's niche but with like marginally more focus than I put on Ardy it's only like 5k+ extra exp an hour all while spending money on staminas, as opposed to being barely lucid and still able to hit max rate at Ardy.
---
My dream would be re-introducing iconic agility courses like Ape Atoll as FUCKING VIABLE alternatives to ridiculously convenient rooftop courses.
---
None of the guides I seen mention craws bow but it seems like a good option
---
repost
---
That‚Äôs what it sounds like to have a stroke

They couldn't make the rapier better because of power creep, but they didn't think of it while doing the lance imo

Dude this is sick
---
‚ÄúJust hop‚Äù
---
You really just repost this within an hour? Bold move.
---
What's that
---
What if Jagex washes their hands :/
---
Just gunna put this in perspective because I can tell OP has never done Ardougne agility course.
---
Tick perfect Ardougne Agility at 96 is 62,300 xp per hour.
---
More acurate Ardougne rates are closer to 55k at 90 and 58-60k at 96 and above. 
---
Prifddinas Agility is at 60k per hour according to the blog at 90, this assumes it will get better the higher your agility level. 
---
Its like someone saying current mining training is fine because you can get 100k per hour at 90 doing 3T granite. 
---
This post is just trying to get people to believe Ardougne needs to be nerfed or Prifddinas is not good enough. Its clickbait because the community cant be bothered to max their accounts with current xp rates.
---
CoX riding? No one put this already? Y‚Äôall are slippin‚Äô
---
good have 12 atm at gargs training up while they are there. sorry It took so long to reply. slowly im gearing them up better, one thing I noticed is if u have a alt make cannon balls, some f2p smithign the gold bars into ammys. it does rougly bring up the average u make per hour. although because of the cost of ess, bars and the rares. its sadly around 400k a hour if u just use guthans and supercombats and cycle between clients
---
rc bad
---
Worst part is that it's the name of an actual place.
---
You are a bot confirmed
---
I did it with lower defence than that, just remember to pray mage for the boss
---
This is worthy of many golds

---
I got 99 hunter about a month ago without the use of private chinchompa hunting spot. 
---
I would say about 85% of that was done on world 365 which is the high risk world. Bots strangely avoid that world even though it‚Äôs not PvP combat outside of wilderness.
---
Sick.
---
I'll bring my uninsured beaver
---
Wouldn't stop anything really like 50 slayer is really low. It would help reduce bots maybe.
---
XD rawr
---
those 10 people are gonna be pissed
---
Original meaning is Best in Slot, it derives from MMORPGs such a world of warcraft and runescape where you could define a single item to be the very best one for one equipment slot
---
&gt; Nothing is going to get absurdly priced, because there's a point where something becomes valuable enough for someone to spend their time doing it, lowering the price.
---
All basic supplies would go up. I honestly do not think we have the raw numbers to support that side of the economy at this point. We saw a small taste once when minnow bots got nuked and sharks went up to 1.5k, and that wasn't even all of them or all the bots in rotation.
---
We have an eco based around botting. I really don't see how we can fix it at this point. For every person that goes for the good profit, there are 10 others that need the supplies at that moment.
---
Let's also not talk about how merching would fuck us over at that point.
---
Somebody give Abyss a hug
---
Sounds like you‚Äôve got some spectrals to merch lol. But I do like the idea
---
well firstly the update you're asking for here already [got added two years ago](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/party-petes-birthday-bash?oldschool=1), and secondly armadyl uses a range based mage attack (god alone knows why)
---
I do not. I‚Äôm not rich enough to unfortunately. Although I would like to see the Spectral gain some value as this would add value to killing Corp, I do not intend for any malicious gains to be acquired as a result of this suggestion. Items will inevitably rise if a buff is polled, that can‚Äôt be helped. I could buy like 5 Spectrals max lol
---
No kidding, share some for the rest of us.
---
Are we going to ignore how the game completely bombed at launch
---
I may be wrong on this but I think he‚Äôs using an account build for tribriding that he‚Äôs never gone for before
---
We are not going to help you falsely recover someone's account.
---
Ah I somehow forgot this happened. I guess my suggestion has changed for the Spectral to block some of the drain from Smite.
---
Yeah I'd kill myself if I were a splasher.
---
lol i guess now that i look at how I typed this post it definitely seems this way hahaha. Its my ranger pure i made like 3 years ago.
---
The whip mix is from BA store right? Maybe a bot farm recently cashed in.
---
You‚Äôre 100% wrong, even in places where woods are cheap, they‚Äôre still some of the most expensive wraps. Swishers, games, etc are 2 for 99¬¢ and there are some cheap wraps that are 4 for $1.
---
Fist (pee++)
---
40-60 in fishing herblore mining farming would help for better rewards
---
Typically a player that attacks one specific player over again and again. Raggers usually wear only one item such as Crystal bow and if you kill them, you don't get anything and the ragger just comes back to attack again. They can make pking difficult as their target is constantly under attack &amp; waste their supplies.
---
Because someone else is now using it...
---
It seems it was already taken
---
It's still my previous name. When I try to add it, it says I cannot add myself to my own friends
---
Long. Fletching is a buyable. Making bows is way to slow.
---
Just leave fletching for later when you can afford darts. Adamant darts are not too expensive
---
That‚Äôs very odd! Look it up on the high scores
---

It says not found. Maybe wait another day
---
Seriously... Just do barrows or zulrah for a bit and you'll be able to afford the dagger.
---
No.
---
That's not self-referential...
---
Lol don't even know what that is
---
any guides on 3 (or less) ticking chinchompas which actually tells you what to do instead of just showing you the process
---
Its already taken by you not as a username but as a previous name , as soon it stops to be ur previous , u can get it back .
---
Defenetly herblore. Contruction you train by buying limestone with morytania legs 4 and flametear bag then making limestone attack stone. Runecrafting you train regular to 77 then bloods/souls.
---
why is pvp so fucking stale right now.
---
Long form talks of all kinds are good food for thought. I like listening to them while I grind skills because it helps me mellow out and focus.
---
Okay?.... fail to see what your point is but... sure.
---
About 90% of players on f2p and 20-40% in p2p. There are about 200 bots in every world if you count just the obvious things like mining, air orbs, green drags, rune rafting.

You could have an infected client. What client are you using, and where are you downloading it from?
---
unholy town name
---
I mean if idiots keep using that logic than we should remove hunter, mobile, Zeah, Zulrah, MM2 and DS2, The G.E. All raids etc.
---
Hot!
---
This kind of rather childish mentality is why people who have it should not be in charge, virtually or in the real world. 
---
It sets the stage for scoffing at anyone who merely reports being scammed or hacked, like that one streamer in this subreddit a year or so ago who reported being hacked and authenticator bypassed. He said he was the type to tell people it was "your fault" for being hacked/scammed, to boot, which is interesting.
---
Fact is anyone can get scammed or tricked into something, ingame or real life. And just because someone falls for one and you don't doesn't mean the scammer shouldn't be stopped. Seriously, people treat everything as a game until it happens to them.
---
"Rev caves, 2M GP / hour!"

Incredible. You try have talent. Don't waste it on Runescape xd
---
Prices of old potions are unlikely to get affected much.
---
Could we get more info regarding your stats?
---
I'd definitely go for 60 attack once you hit 80+ strength,  the DDS is alot better for NH fights because the g maul is so RNG based and you get only one shot at KOing someone with it, whereas you can spec 4 times with the DDS. Also the DDS is better for smiting someone IMO (because they can eat in between specs, raising their HP and so your smite can deal more damage to their prayer).
---
I fucking love osrs, the grind, teaching milestones and getting that rare drop you weren‚Äôt exspecting.

Wouldn't want to reduce my vorkath gp/hr by 10% to get 50% more gp/hr killing daggonath kings.

Thanks for the tip. Is there certain quests I should prioritze? the members ones I did are animal magnetism, dwarf cannon, druidic ritual, gertrudes cat, Plague city, priest in peril, tree gnome village and the waterfall quest.
---
Eat your ass
---
Lol

Divine Potions are literally just nerfed Overloads except Super Combat is an Overload but better because it only does 10 damage. We REALLY don't need overloads unless we want people to grind every boss as we have right now faster and inevitably power creep the difficulty of the bosses for no reason making them REQUIRE Divine Potions because if the boss didn't require them because if you DID use them then you'd bash it's brains in.
---
Ouch, you sure are showing me that I'm immature and you're stable by attacking me on a subreddit. Do you have a crush on me or something :3?
---
I think we are somewhat in agreement but the moneymaking concept I was talking about is very important, it's called opportunity cost. Unless you're getting money by buying bonds with your mom's credit card you have to earn it. Think about a person with a maxed main vs a low level f2p. The maxed main can make like 5m an hour from Raids (maybe more, not sure), the f2p person is probably doing something shit like buying from shops and filling jugs of water for 200k an hour. Obviously the blowpipe cost means much to the people with weaker money makers. Any cost does. The quest requirements mean that the people completing the quest are very likely to to have already unlocked very strong money makers. The absolute cost stays the same but the opportunity cost differs, because the extra time you save using the blowpipe needs to be wasted by making money, and how much time that takes depends on your moneymakers. Personally I always use blowpipe because 400k an hour isn't that much to me, and I can't currently see a situation in which I'd use the crystal bow, even if it were free, with it's current stats.

Get quest scape, choose a target slayer monster (ex wyverns), go join a pvm  clan
---
The potential for a non-maxed HCIM training with some of the best gear in the game outweighs the fact he‚Äôs not doing a lot of damage.
---
What happened to him and how did you find out
---
You got a lot of the notable ones done! I haven‚Äôt been in that road for a while, but I‚Äôd suggest getting full graceful (which will take a few days, and you‚Äôll get it around 55-60~ agility), then I worked towards all the quest requirements for Recipe for Disaster so definitely look that up! You should look up the quests on the wiki and see what rewards they give out at the end of the quest. For me I liked a lot of the early game level skips so whichever quests gave lvls to my lower level skills, I definitely prioritized. Barrows gloves are awesome so do recipe for disaster. Tears of guthix is also great for the weekly free exp! For me I also prioritized get varrock medium diary for the daily zaff staff discount, as well as morytania hard diary for the 1.5x runes at barrows as well as the bonecrusher which I use a lot for slayer.
---
However you want to play is up to you! But if you‚Äôre lost, quests definitely help! If you ever need advice in game feel free to message me since there‚Äôs tons of things going on in this game that‚Äôs too difficult to summarize in a post! Best of luck!

They wouldn't. If 3rd party clients go they lose revenue from OSBuddy Pro and a lot of people would probably quit all together because of how horrible the vanilla client is.
---
Gz

Im pretty sure this was a thing before EOC aswell, didnt really play but I know that AGS, dragon claws and other op shit was in runescape after 2007. After the game was ruined.

good try though

the crystal armour seems like it would take to much time to get when u can just use a bp with armadyl and still do way more dammage

People always say Verf‚Äôs series are great, but I tried watching the first episode of Karamja only and I just could not get into it, didn‚Äôt like it at all.  Does it get better or is the series all like that more or less?

Pc specs? Works fine for me.
---
I was thinking about using Proselyte legs for the prayer bonus but switching to tank legs when I need to tank some damage, otherwise I think I will be using too much of the resources.

Besides fight cave, I would like some armour anyways for slayer.

Not new and the people who bring their bank on a pvp world are braindead. Still should be patched but the bigger problem is trying to anti lure. People who try to anti deserve it imo.
---
what about the potato only iron man?
---
I stagger my clients and put one (that Im usually afking or paying less attention to) in the bottom left and my main in the top right and minimize it just enough for the notification not to overlap with the client. I know it leaves some dead space but it‚Äôs an easy fix

I love coming out to war with you guys, but when it's costing me all my supplies and money, and we can't even stay to do round 3 when they have 12 people left, and we have 26, it's ridiculous to me... It's fun and all, but damn, I'm just gonna' focus on getting a 50m+ bank like all of you before I get demoralized anymore from using all my supplies. I HEAR the calls to log out and ignore round 3, but wtf, when I'm scouting, and seeing nobody else on but 12 mother fuckers, just listen to the damn calls and stay instead of logging out. We can win a war and save supplies... I'm not here to flame other clans, sorry if that's y'alls goal or agenda.... It's fucking Monday, and I get going up to war on Fridays as i've made it out as much as possible... But damn, us poorer pkers can't afford to make the numbers big in this cc if we don't have the bank to spend 500k on wizard boots, or 5m on staff of light... Fuck this shit, i'm trying to build a bank before just flaming/ragging kids to boost my ego.... Y'all have fun. I'll see y'all rarely from now on...
---
P.S.: Thanks for the few minis, but i'm still going negative just trying to support the clan instead of enjoying a game I learned to love in 2001.... Games are for fun, not stress.
---
I just might now, thanks for the help!
---
Looks dope! How long did it take?
---
Lmao no

sit

While I do agree that in this case it is irrelevant whether they had FT2 as a requirement or not, using your logic we shouldn't lock out people from doing content when they decide to lock themselves out of content to begin with?

This changes everything

Congrats! Got it a few months ago myself, and it's hella satisfying. I like that, requiring quest cape and with new diaries being added, this cape gets harder to get over time, instead of easier.

thats wholesome

Holy shit, that's dark.

Just click the ditch at edge or varrock, it gives you warning, click okay and you are in wilderness.
---
Mithril darts, keep in mind my average kill is around 1:40-1:50, you need insane rng to get 1:34.  
---
With assembler+anguish+99 ranged mith darts have the same max hit as addy as long as you're potted to 112 or 111 ranged, I use 1 dose per kill and bring like 5 per trip.
---
It ain't much but it's honest work

Thank you for the kind words. :)

will do, what about fighter torso vs prosy top? I assume w/ sgs on most normal tasks you'll be able to sustain with enough prayer bonus and sgs but is there ever a time to take torso instead?
---
I've been interested in reading about scams and lures recently, and the more I read about them the stupider they seem. I seriously don't see how any of these lures would ever work.

You can bot pretty much anything but agility 12 hours a day without getting banned.

17k zulrah kills in 4 weeks btw. It's pretty much 24/7.

Amazing!

I feel 0:30 - 1:15 on a personal level. The major two differences between us though is 1.) You're actually good at drawing and 2.) you stick with things. I usually just give up trying to make the thing look good and change what I'm doing.

Sure it's the first? I saw a pure, that I don't think was you, consistently farming Hydra for months after release.  He had the sire pet so I reckon it wasn't his first rodeo

He forgot to turn off Protect from Melee after blocking Theon's charge. Then he ran out of prayer while slow-mo walking over to Bran obviously.

Combat bracelet's equivalent is mithril gloves, while granite glove's equivalent is adamant gloves, so granite gloves are slightly better (gives +1 more strength bonus and slightly more defence) with higher crush bonus, but slightly lower slash/stab bonus.

Because referring to an experience in the past and calling it nostalgia at the time doesn't make any sense.

Now that I think about it, they didn't mention how the xp/hr increases as you lvl up, did they? But yeah, even still they should buff it a bit.
---
Find it/make the list yourself, dude.

Whip attacks every 2.4s, so in 1 hour of full combat it uses 1500 charges. 1 charge is 270 gp, so that's 405k gp cost per hour to use a tentacle, which isn't very cheap.
---
Yes

I don't follow rules and they don't like that.

---
So they beat out zerk in deep wildy,   ut at that point why not use a max account if you pk in deep wildy to kill the same targets while having better stats. You can fight 1 lv difference per lv in wildy right? So a 126 should be able to hit a 76+ in 50+ wild if im not mistaken. Just not sure the point to a zerk or mid in deep wild at that point
---
I agree, however a week after a release is quite reasonable for spoilers. I think actors are allowed to spoil one week after release.
---
Honestly this is the best idea, but this man got lucky. Look to break even (which should happen) while doing this.
---
It's true though. Woox keeps such a straight face. When he starts to smile, you know something good just happened.
---
What I am saying is that the Crystal Bow is lower DPS but lower cost and that is consistent no matter how much money you make. So it could be a case where at Zulrah or whatever else you kill it is slightly slower kills, but the lower cost yields equal or greater profit overall. A good example of this was Brutal Dragons; the Blowpipe was higher DPS than the pre-buff DHCB, but the DHCB was higher profit because it had a far lower upkeep cost. The Crystal Bow could fit into a similar role.
---
Also, the Range is something that you seem to be overlooking. You don't take a Blowpipe to bosses like Zilyana because you need the range (well, you bring it for Minions but you get the point). So there is more at play than just DPS and a Crystal Bow with the same DPS as the Blowpipe isn't just an alternative; it is a stronger weapon. And like I said, I am for buffing the Crystal Bow from its current, even from its proposed current, but I am skeptical about how comparable it is to the Blowpipe. I think there is a middle ground between Crossbows and Blowpipe where it would be useful without being the best weapon.
---
Lastly, it is a bit of an assumption that anyone who does Song of the Elves will have a strong money maker. It has 70 reqs, but that doesn't mean the quest itself will be very difficult or that the player will have good combat levels to match it. It is possible to have all the reqs yet still not have completed DS2 and not have the stats or gear to kill Zulrah effectively.
---
I'd take it of it was even easier to train than ardy. Like less clicks/h.
---
Pks 500k: eh, that's pretty good
---
Pks 150k: oo nice! 150k!
---
They mentioned looking into it, but Wolf said he wouldn't mind a 5-10% nerf. Either way, it would still be one of the best methods and I believe the potential nerf was only for the dual exp and not the individual exp since that is the one that is really good.
---
Norm on runescape was always alt. Toon is only the norm for every other mmo
---
LOL, you forgot to mark out your battery. GG account. Changing your credentials as we speak.
---
"OP build"
---
Right, that's what they were saying. They were having nostalgic thoughts about 2007 when first playing osrs, and are now having nostalgic thoughts about having nostalgic thoughts lol.
---
Only if they added some runelite plugins to the official client. GPU, Ground Items, Timers, calculated XP rates...I'd probably just RWT and quit without the QoL plugins.

First week as a hardcore and still alive, my first died carelessly fighting zombies while I turned away from the monitor for a minute thinking I could survive long enough... but nah. I learned my lesson.

Whatever the law, it's really irresponsible to ship a cat and Jagex should be ashamed of themselves.
---
It's actually sickening to think of how many times Jagex might have shipped people cats. :/
---
Just like red dhide bodies or rune warhammers from shamans.
---
Magic rockmake BAD
---
Yeah one sec
---
Clockwork mice at the duel arena?
---
The entire idea depends on having enough players to cover all basic supplies which I do not think we have. There is a ridiculous amount of basic shit we use and most won't be the best gp/hr creating a heavy lack of it. Cballs are a decent example of this.
---
Also I don't get how my look on the economy diverts with yours apart of that point.
---
Ok
---
literally means "you had the chance to die with proper rng"
---
so for example when youre 40 hp and someone misses an ags spec on you, you just got chanced

If you're thinking herblore on an ironman is slow, you've clearly never done smithing on an ultimate ironman exclusively with voice commands.

So sick

I don‚Äôt get why people like to put iron/fe in their usernames for their ironmen.

I‚Äôm not a pker, but I‚Äôm pretty sure i‚Äôd be much more motivated to pk someone doing a clue with ‚Äúiron‚Äù in their username

Thanks! But I did appeal and got rejected. Then I filled out a ticket explaining my situation only to receive an email saying that this method is no longer in use. I tried to find a way to contact mods directly, but everything eventually redirects me to the appeal page, which I technically can't do anymore as I already have done so once.

A long time, since you need 175 quest points to finish the quest, and most quests (which all all have thir own stat requirements) give 1-5 quest points each and have varying lengths.

Hearing people bitch about the last couple of skill capes that don't have 100k xp per hour methods is getting old. Its weird that you don't need to have 99 agility or runecrafting yet people will bitch about it because they can't get it.

Yeah he hates racism

---
make it upside down
---
That was painful to watch
---
u just had to brag about your fancy life didn't you? prick.
---
Is that just because people at similar combat with 50 atk have much greater strength and can smack you about?
---
Which is why runescape pking is fucking garbage
---
At most people are risking like.....20 cents of gold....who fucking cares
---
Like your risking maybe 15 minutes of play time per death in items.....who fucking cares
---
I will never understand how anyone gets excited by the absolute shit risking of pking now a days, it was way more fun in 2007 when people were running around with the bank
---
Anyone know why torstol seeds have gone up over 10k in the last few days?
---
How pathetic can you get, having your friends boost you through ToB while using minimum welfare gear like Mystic, d'hide, r'cbow and a Dscim, guess people are willing to do anything for attention on Twitch nowadays, Jagex should really look into the integrity issues of HCIM being boosted for drops

If the flow of microtransactions slows to rs3, then osrs will be flooded with them. Good metaphor

Yeah, but as others have said in this thread and clearly the Jmods have agreed with, that particular quest requirement was arbitrary and wasn't really related to the quest anyway, so it didn't need to be there.

I'm at work so I can't check right now, but I'm pretty sure if you look across the playerbase of players who've been active in the past like.. 6 months, the spectrum of players who have/are within 3 or 4 levels of the 70s required and those who aren't would be in a biiiiiig heavy on the "those who aren't" side.

---
(Haven't tried this myself)
---
Hellll yea brother
---
What, care to elaborate
---
Its more about how the kill happens rather than the loot itself.
---
1)A lot of the portals use other runes like bloods/souls/astrals and other random stuff like bananas (ape atoll) and salts (troll stronghold)
---
2) Portals also save you runes in the long run, since it's a one time payment
---
3) You can use a house tablet and go to any of them, regardless of what spellbook you're on
---
4) Don't need to risk a rune pouch in dangerous areas when you can use a tablet instead
---
10 mins faster than my first jad, so Well done!
---
They don't care about whether or not they made 500k, they care that they got a clip of them pking 500k, but the account build they're fighting usually risks 300-800k, so 500k is "not bad"
---
But when they pk a ragger that they expect to only drop bones, and they instead drop 200k. They get excited because it's content for their channel
---
The amount of time spent running, the graceful recharge bonus doesn't really help nearly as much as using a stamina pot. At that point, the main focus is keeping weight under 0.
---
For example: When you have different spellbook and teletab to your house you need them.

That‚Äôs real good to know! Would 2 chambers be enough to cover me? Or should I get my construction up to make a basic nexus?
---
it‚Äôs not that people don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs that they miss learning everything for the first time
---
that‚Äôs why a lot of people fall in love with ironman mode, because even though you have all this game knowledge it sets you back and makes you learn all different methods and ways of playing that you may not have even known existed
---
I think it's because of the lack of it being an "alternative" in this case. I totally get the "not everything needs to be best xp/gp" argument, and I support it. But if you're gonna have me knock out a grandmaster quest for this course, gimme like.. a high average for those crystal shards, since they're used for *everything*!
---
Everything else within the area provides so many more crystal shards, I think if they just upped the average shards/hr expected from it, I'd be fine with the similar XP rate. Not anything huge, but maybe like 12/16/hr average would be enough, if I planned to train agility past 75, y'know?

Aw someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed

I would stop playing... Because i was never able to run the vanilla client across different computers and hardware. It simply wont install, and always erroring with "failed to apply transformations"

It's pretty crude where I just placed ironing board with stack of books for high enough mouse "table". The "table" is about 1.4 meters/ 4.6 feet high. I haven't made nor make a stand for a keyboard because I don't require it. I only do indoor cycling + OSRS when doing boring stuff.

Is there still a runepure clan???

Yeah man like.......who fucking cares

For training keep using mith darts. For slayer use a magic shortbow imbued with rune arrows. It‚Äôs cheap and much much higher dps than a crossbow

Nexus is very expensive and not needed. I have 2 rooms with 3 teles in both of them and I'm fine. Jewellery box is most used with the fairy ring and spirit tree.

Yes, all of his 327k subscribers unironically like him.

Well duh, I'm just pointing out that the clue number was equal to the value of the reward. I would do the same for any other clue tier. I'm not calling for beginner buffs because they are already hurting the cooked shrimp market.

Is he still going? Hasn't been an upload in what feels line a really long time
---
Imagine pking people not built or geared for pking for fun

Upscale it.
---
Clan wars does not act as an ornate pool. It resets stats and doesn't give spec back
---
Man I hope that's a requirement
---
To be fair he does get a few head-scratching loots, like toxic staff, and dragon crossbow from recent videos.
---
How is this not got 1k+ upvotes?
---
So if someone with the same name as you goes on a rampage will you change your name?
---
You make an okay sign and place it below your waist. If you friend looks at it, you get to punch him three times.
---
The Okay sign has been adopted by white supremacist and neonazis as a hate symbol. The terrorist and white supremacist who shot up the New Zealand mosque flashed it at his trial. Since he was handcuffed, it was in the exact position one would place it when playing the game.
---
He lived 230 years lmao
---
Torvesta hits big in his last video if u haven‚Äôt seen it lol. He‚Äôs risking 70 m but he gets I think over half lol which is still insane
---
I would totally buy a RuneScape/LEGO collab
---
I mean all you will lose is the supplies you use which you could always start out with cheap food till you get the hang of it.
---
Only you know what you enjoy, but I'd personally find the game to be pointless if I bought gold. If I had everything I needed/wanted then what is there to go for?

Weird flex but grats
---
Shit I saw 2 of them just outside of canifis the other day. Good thing my level 50 hunter ass could really appreciate them
---
When did runescape have horses!??!!?
---
No, that's entirely different. There was a push before the incident for white supremacists to adopt this symbol before hand. Many claimed to do it ironically.
---
or just hover logout button and hop if you see a white dot. i also zoom camera all the way out so i can see anyone running up out of the corner of my eye. that way i don't have to stare at the minimap constantly. i usually watch youtube or w/e on the the left side of my monitor and still manage to get away 9/10 times.
---
I too, have gotten rare drops before.
---
Torvesta in his last video literally pk'd an armadyl crossbow...
---
By literal internet trolls. Did you also microwave your iPhone?
---
??????????????????
---
White supremacists, neonazis and others. I pmed you a link about it since automod removes my posts when I post bbc  and other news articles.
---
I think it's hilarious these low IQ care-bears eat up everything 4chan does, no wonder they keep getting bored and making new random "hate symbols", Don't forget to start spreading around that the rainbow flag is now a hate symbol as well as clowns.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I thought people who called their wow characters toons in 2005 were losers then too.

I know you didn't ask, I know you don't care about the norm(so obvious that you don't care) but you kinda seem like a huge loser

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in pk school, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on rev caves, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top bridder in the entire wildy. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies in Al kharid and your ipis being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can tele anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my barrowa gloves equipped. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the ge with my 8b bank and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of gielenor, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo
---
And it started being more than that once a god-damn terrorist who murdered over 50 people flashed it at his trial.
---
pffffft

Maybe I am, and that's okay, cause I really don't care.

Yeah, I can. You meant ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an elitist asshole who likes to tell everyone that I‚Äôm an ironman and therefore my achievements far outweigh your fake achievements you dumb bondies. I spent 400 hours blowing glass and digging sand lmao.‚Äù

And I‚Äôm sure you deleting your post means nothing.

Run it through waifu2x

I usually risk so little that having to gear up again and walk back is more annoying than the value of what I lost.

One time I'm pretty sure the PKer actually got a net loss because of the cost of runes they used. At that point it kinda goes from being annoying to amusing.

Sounds fun

Underrated comment lmao
---
They say that but it just seems unlikely. From the time it took me to get 73-81 mining at the triple iron at the mining guild, 1 guy responded to me the whole time and the other accs had like 108 mining with 50 stats. Theres no way they haven‚Äôt been reported multiple times lol. Could be wrong though.
---
He's talking about the streamers though mate
---
I meant horses, which shouldn't exist in runescape because we killed them all.
---
What lol this is like the 10000 time it‚Äôs been reposted

I don‚Äôt think there are any bots on mobile

I can‚Äôt link atm but there‚Äôa a nice 2 man raid guide on google somewhere. I‚Äôve used it with a mate before, though I mostly just solo. Look up ‚ÄúCox 2 man raid guide osrs‚Äù which is what I did and remember it being on top of the searches.
---
It's not equivalent. Comparing 2 things doesn't mean I think they are equivalent. I was using the Swastika as an example of how symbols can have their meanings changed when white supremacists and nazis adopt them.
---
I‚Äôve been doing vorkath a bit more lately and I had a few questions about the efficiency of it. I have 95 range 85 def 85 att and 92 str. I‚Äôm using a bp with elite void and switch for bgs spec. I have an ornate pool and used to just do 1 kill per trip and my kills are between 1.5-3 minutes depending on spec. If I miss both specs it‚Äôs around 3.5 to maybe 4 minutes a kill. For a 1 kill trip I take 8 shark and 4 karambwans and I‚Äôll maybe take 1 sip of prayer if it‚Äôs a bit longer. If I do 2 kill trips I bring 12 manta rays and will go through a prayer pot. If I spec at the start of my second kill it seems faster, but if I don‚Äôt it seems to take longer and i have to drop more mantas to pick up loot. So not sure which is better in the long run. Also for my quick prayers I use steel skin, eagle eye, pray mage, and preserve. Should I be using preserve? I‚Äôm not sure how it works if I turn off prayer for special phases or get hit by his purple attack. Also my bank is around 180 mil and am not sure if it‚Äôd be worth it to buy dhcb. I don‚Äôt camp him for long. I‚Äôll do maybe 1-3 hours a day before I get tired of him and do something else. I‚Äôve also though about the lance cause it‚Äôs a bit cheaper but don‚Äôt know how that compares kills/hr.

Sorry to hear. I hope he lived a life without regrets.

This is r/2007scape, I think you meant to post this on Discord? Or something?

No one is saying move the caves, just add reqs for what is one of the most profitable spots in the game for both PKers and PVMers. PVMers don't get access to the best spots without reqs why should PKers?
---
As others said ancients, but also the fact that magic offers zero time training with spells like high alch or magic imbue

I've accidently put a 3rd age pickaxe in the ge for 750 gp instead of 750m (it sold for 742.8m). Didn't grab a a screen of the pick being in for 750 gp, get downvoted 100% of the time I mention it lol.

I would love to but I am on a 3 week camping trip with my family ;)

how can you complain about private server players when you play RS3, the biggest, most grotesque abomination of an RS version of them all?
---
Wait, so you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs more impressive for somebody in maxed gear to do ToB with other people in maxed gear, than to watch a HCIM do something that‚Äôs extremely risky to his HCIM status? What a boring and repetitive world you live in my dude
---
Dont really have any but theres no reason he would lie to me about this
---
Yes, do you not? The creator even realized that it was adopted by nazis, racists and white supremacists and tried to stop it. He failed though.
---
Hello all, I played heavily from '03 to '09 before taking a long break. Finally came back last week and I'm loving building back up from mood island. No one I knew back in the day plays anymore so I'm just looking for a friend to text screenshots of achievements/accomplishments and just generally talk about the game. RS2 was a big part ofy life for a long time and I'd love to re-experience it with a friend.  Hit me up in PM's if interested.
---
It didn‚Äôt go through as 750gp so who cares

Speaking of Torvesta. How does that guy get every single video of his into suggested/auto play? I came back to osrs about a month ago and as tradition dictate I've been watching tutorials on questing, skilling and some moneymaking ever since. Now whenever the guide im watching finishes and auto play triggers it takes like 5-10 seconds before I hear that guy talking. Every. Single. Time. I'm not even into pvp videos.
---
That's hilarious. It's a 4chan meme. Nothing has meaning until you make it have meaning and nobody called it a hate symbol until the left started getting more and more wacky. It's not a hate symbol
---
Lock it behind elite Karamja tho
---
Sorry for the late response I use runelite from their site always have

To encourage people to attack you.

Was hoping for sea shanty 2 :/

No proof = lie; yikes bro id love to have you on a jury trial
---
The creator himself says its a hate symbol.

Look up nmz training with a blowpipe, could be a more viable way or cannoning is good too so a little costly.

Thanks for the reply ! I was thinking about getting my hunter level up and doing the chins for some early money and then investing into other skills. Is that a good idea?
---
Yes but Chins are only better exp if you‚Äôre 3ting
---
Yeah I do, at the very least he‚Äôs insane at pking and that itself is enjoyable to watch. The odd 10m+ pks are hype too. But he‚Äôs also not the only pker I watch on YouTube so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm lacking in content to watch ya dig

Ahh yes my favorite skill, egg cracking.

Yo my littler brother was the one who took ur blowpipe, let me explain before all you bash on me. I CANT BELIEVE this is happening to me. I would never do something like this. Heres the truth, my little brother plays on my osrs while i play on my rs3. U can check my accomplishments (completionist, high boss enrage, lots of achievements etc.) He's the one who ''borrowed'' your blowpipe and I am extremely sorry but I deleted ur account name because i generally do that for people he adds both on my runescape and my discord. Tell me your rs username and ill add you and pm me back. I am highly sorry for what happened. I truly am and I know my little brother is a dumbass. Sorry for what happened. Give me your rs username and discord and ill give you back your blowpipe. He only has ur blowpipe, or anything else he borrowed?
---
? It's literally just making the game fair. How is it fair that other people can hit an iron's monster once and get the drop? Never go into game design.

When someone gets the whole set of DEGRADABLE gear together to make crystal bow viable it should actually be worth using over other T70 gear, at-least in some situations.
---
come on now you werent expecting any better from jagex were you?
---
you are complaining about an alternate mode that was only made because of streamers.  If you believe that the game should be designed around ironmen you might as well take your ass to rs3 if you want a dead game.
---
They can't, why do you think it works this way? Stop answering these lol it litterally works the way you want it too.
---
You mean Donald Trump happened. He's the one who emboldens racists and described a neonazi ralley as having very fine people on both sides.

Well you could argue combat skills would become a bit more meaningful if you would not just get it passively through slayer.

---
So make the set cause the crystal bow to be ALMOST as good as BP and then nerf blowpipe since we would have a new piece of content to fill the void it leaves. BP can still be good due to its poison effect, such as multi-target slayer assignments.
---
Maybe nerf BP's damage by a chunk and up its venom rate? Wouldn't be good for xp since it's poison damage, but like I said it could be for venoming a whole bunch of targets and letting them kill themselves.
---
Ranarrs are actually more profitable overall. There‚Äôs a small time frame where snapdragons are a bit more profitable. Someone did the math a while ago and it‚Äôs best to plant ranaars for profit.

Crystal bow needed 50 agility for roving elves quest

yeah people are super biased here, he is obsiouly not pulling his weight and is getting carried. This is not a viable activity to do on an account in the state it is now. So i'd say the rewards he gets from tob are not deserved. If he actually pulled his weight id say otherwise. but yeah this is basically leeching for free. Like buying emblems, except you pay for those.

I am in the skilling discord. I'm not even doing these shitty tasks - I have bloodveldes, gargoyles, abyssal demons etc. blocked. All the tasks I do are the barrage tasks and the cannon tasks (kalphites, dagannoths etc.). But I can't maintain points - so I do black demons and greater demons (like they also recommend in the skilling discord). I never bursted ankous, I guess I could make it a bit faster. But that's not gonna change a lot - I still have to do 200 black demons sometimes, which literally takes 30 minutes and it's only 30-40k xp/h at best.
---
Also why does nobody ever take into the account the time it takes to bank? It's not like it takes 10 seconds, it takes a few minutes to re-gear and re-stock etc.??
---
Like come on: I've gotten lucky before and got nechs into dust into smoke into nechs into kalphites etc. etc. so you get 90k/h for a period of 4-5 hours, but then you also get unlucky sometimes where you get 2 black demon tasks in a row followed by stupid shit like steel dragons and black dragons which ends you up with 30k xp/h
---
Oh holy shit. The level requirements are insane. Fuck that, rings of wealth are cheaper.

I just don't like the notion that the average player isn't having fun with the game where the new players are.

It makes me wonder why these people play if they feel like everybody else is having more fun that is the point I wanted to make
---
YouTube's algorithm isn't the best. Idk if it's the sheer amount of content or YouTube itself but it doesn't do similar suggestions well anymore.

My average with addy darts is like 2:20 - 2:35. Wonder with that same gear and stats, wonder where I‚Äôm missing time?

Lmaoooo this is awesome
---
Yeah i think a lot of people dont understand theres no such thing as a perfect bot detection algorithm.

If you make your detection and banning routine too "strict" you'll start catching innocent players with it and banning them, and bots will still wind up getting through anyway

Karamja only I believe
---
Because it takes 3 years to max runecrafting

I‚Äôll say this much, Slayer is my least favorite skill to TRAIN. I don‚Äôt mind doing it just to do it. I actually don‚Äôt find it that dull either. But it does suck to train it. Every time I look at my skills, it‚Äôs the only one I dread having to train.
---
All from birdhouses?
---
These could probably be made quite easily. 
---
Ghostly versions would just be clear purple plastic.
---
insane? Highest requirement is 40 fm
---
Ooo. Thats not bad. Only an hour 66-68? Ohh yes. Thats what I'll be doing! Haha. Honestly I dont mind the click intensive stuff, and i say that in a weird way..because yes, I hate mining and *certain* click heavy skills however i will always prefer to do the fastest/most efficient exp. Unless its like minimal difference then yeah I'll do the more afk route. Idk it seems weird to me so many people play the game..but literally only to do afk stuff. I mean youre not even playing the game bro..whats the point? If you wanna afk to reach a certain point then ok - but to strictly ONLY play and only afk skill, that seems pointless lol. 
---
Its like construction. It took me forever to get motivated to actually knock out 50-83 con and finally I set a goal for myself and did it in a day and a half doing oak larders/doors. Im So glad i did too man, fuck me its nice having a max poh thats your own and i havent even gotten full use yet since im not doing as many bosses as i plan to. Plus con is like 300k/hr doing oak larders. Anf then 450k doing doors. Only cost about 18m in oak planks, then another like 25m to build everything lmao. I laughed at myself thinking fuck me I forgot to think about how expensive actually BUILDING the shit in the house would be once i got the level. Good thing i had a bit of spare money i didnt know what to do with yet (not rich at all lmao just hard figuring out what upgrades to go for first as far as gear goes)
---
The ole distract him with a question and impale him with your pickaxe. Nice
---
Is it really. Just look at his post history. How do people find the time for this.
---
Collect mort myre fungus
---
They don't restore stats like overloads.
---
Tsunamiscape
---
No, there was a push by racists, white supremacists and nazis to adopt the symbol "ironically". What sealed the deal was when a terrorist who murdered dozens of people used it.
---
&gt;Obama used the ok sign, is he an islamophobic white supremacist now?
---
No, that was before the nazis converted it.
---
Herbs are where the money is, but they're not amazing XP. What I did for XP was a daily fruit tree + calquat tree run, and I did snapegrass (watermelons are somewhat worth too) along with herbs. Throw in some other longer growing big XP drop things like Hespori, teaks/mahogs when you're higher up. At your level you could do some normal trees too for XP.
---
Nice.
---
bad idea in general
---
Agreed, it's not called FriendlyScape. If you're not saying Sit after a kill you're not living.
---
Venezuelans arent the problem, it's the bots
---
Theres alot of people who take pictures of new players and fawn over them. I've honestly never seen people refer to these as jokes before just nostalgia creaming which I think is pretty lame. 
---
I'm not trying to express that I'm angry or annoyed in any capacity tho mainly confused xd
---
Uses 1 prayer acc. "*I almost got smited*"
---
At 77 you can RC bloods at zeah, which involves you mining and idling for extended periods. It's way easier than every other RC method, pretty good xp, and pretty good money.
---
I mean you definitely get nothing out of it apart from some quick levels. have probably made like 4 mill from MLM, and I have the outfit finished. 
---
And tbh I'm the same, I will skill to get requirements for a quest and once I'm done go back to PVM because I like the satisfaction of doing certain bosses without dying lol. I only got my cons up for house portals but I seriously need to finish and get the pool next
---
At your level, you'll be hard pressed to make 2.5m in 3 days, unless you're willing to put in a lot of time. If you can afford it, I would recommend buying a month of membership with real money and taking that time to build up your account to being self-sufficient.
---
You could also just spend some time building up your stats in f2p, but the moneymaking situation in non members is pretty bleak.
---
I wish to join to farm for the pet :))))
---
You didn't even say the account name, how are jmods, should they come across this post, supposed to help you? Your gmail doesn't just randomly delete itself. This post sounds stupid. You don't own the account and/or this is just a nonsense/desperate post.
---
Yer
---
It amazes me how well the original dialog fits with this meme. Top quality.
---
I did a rooftop course (canifis) for the first time the other night and it was really addicting tbh. Got 60 marks in one sitting. I was high alching too, it was a legit dopamine rush.
---
FINALLY! thanks for the content bro, been looking forward to the next episode
---
I'm not doing what i call "normal slayer". I only do barrage tasks or cannon tasks. But look, how stupid is it that everyone just ignores what is supposed to be the main thing about slayer: getting assigned monsters that you have to kill. You might as well call it "barraging'' instead of slayer, because that's what it basically is if you want xp. On top of that you need an alt to get the high xp rates, how autistic is that even.
---
Upvoted since your youtube profile picture isn't a hate symbol.
---
I appreciate you &lt;3 hopefully we can get a group going
---
If cannonballs or dart tips gave good xp, the materials for them would be expensive. It‚Äôs not really about the demand of the item. Lava runes come to mind, they are in high demand but because they‚Äôre good experience you actually lose money making them.
---
It means 'correct'
---
Imagine when he finds out that guy got it at like 50kc as well
---
99% arent 1def for the challenge. They enjoy what 1 def has to offer. If there was a way to just reset to 1 def for pvp, that 99% would just be 99 def. or if quest xp was optional and pvp gear had hard reqs instead. 
---
Also they didnt choose either way. U make the choice to be a pure when u make an acc. Any update post acc creation isnt a choice u get to make
---
Seed pod: Wingstone, Penwie, Brambickle and Professor Manglethorp.
---
Mint cake: Wingstone, Penwie, and Brambickle.
---
I would alch myself if that happened to me
---
Lay off the Ranarr my man
---
Except you can still bank in UIM you just can't use the literal banks or bank chests but gz.
---
This changed everything, for me. 
---
P.S. the high ping was annoying as hell tho so I only used that server to tele and hopped back to my default world.
---
Pures can't do mm2. They can use light ballistas without quest req but can't ever complete mm2 for heavy. It would mess with some Pures, but most would easily grind out 50 slayer. It's 100k xp.
---
There are currently 3 active ones, possibly a forth smaller one but I don't keep tabs on them.
---
Aiming for questcape because that questcape+lunar staff combo is heavenly. And ofcourse all the content unlocked by quests.
---
You in any of them? Can you gimme the ones?
---
It definitely could be. Probably around 80ish you leave your private on. There will be hardcores that pay quite a bit. I know I paid 300k per kill on mine and it was still a struggle finding players to kill.
---
Gz man
---
Hank?
---
It's literally not
---
No you.
---
Out loud?
---
there's enough time to run back and pick up a drop if you're quick, at least if you can use the higher shortcut
---
ü¶Ä
---
you cant say the üÖ±Ô∏è word thats racist
---
Do you need over 88% to get max elite clue scroll chance from barrows?
---
I'd imagine you could prob make it back in time if you had a key tele
---
https://support.runescape.com
---
I'm unsure of what payment method you used or what platform or anything, but it's very likely you'll end up at a page either telling you to contact Google or Apple about it, or to contact Jagex.
---
I‚Äôd reckon it‚Äôs higher than that lol
---
Agility + lunchtime bong = happy always?
---
I already contacted apple but they couldnt do anything because it says jagex didnt take 10.99 but yet my balance is still gone
---
And the support doesnt have anything for my problem
---
Oh shit that‚Äôs not bad at all! I‚Äôm gonna get it too haha!
---
Only 10hp mages however ruined second you attack someone (unless IM of course). Unless you plan on getting 99att/str/def/range with genies mage is your only option.
---
S
---
Yeah, thanks for the estimate, could fill them coffers for 30 days.
---
The nice at the end got me. Much good. Well done
---
&gt;gets PKed
---
The amount of points you get is based on the amount of bosses you have active, so since you have so many disabled you will get less points :)
---
Fucking quantity
---
Nice propaganda. People still make decent progress.
---
Dharoks isnt worth unless you have almost max hp.
---
that's nuts, feels like that should really be taken care of..
---
&gt; What you gain far outweighs any costs involved
---
[Citation needed]
---
I like AFKing Abyssal Demons for hours for melee experience and Whip drops and I use Dragon platelegs
---
I still use it. Specially for 3scape, the quest guides are way better written.
---
Join my CC thru my username Twelvey12 and you‚Äôll find others to run you thru the game! We teach games from time to time (:  We also have a clan discord!
---
And they used not to allow mobile players play who had developers option on and don't work with unlocked or rooted phones.
---
If you pk 10 hours a day every day weird things happen. Also he wasn‚Äôt even playing on his own account.
---
14 hours a day? Damn. Should take me like 8 weeks than. I 3 tick it, but like 1 hour a day
---
16 hours*
---
If you run a business where 75% (numbers taken outta my ass) of your profits come from a piece of shit that's bothering the other 25%, do you kick him out or try to work it out somehow? Show the other 25% some stats and they'll be like yeah..ok, they're trying their best guys! 
---
Fact is, we buy 2 bonds a month. While a guy running a bot farm will probably be buying 200 bonds a month and he won't even get to use them because his bots will get caught and banned and he'll have to remake and buy new ones. 
---
TL;DR, this is a business and bots make jagex a shit ton of money and provide them the most revenue since we don't have MTX. They probably could go nuclear but they'd destroy their profits to do so and eventually we'd have MTX shoved down our throats to make up for it.
---
With that sapphire amulet, unenchanted.
---
Barrows is not afk.. no comparison.. next please
---
I'm 99% sure that at your levels, you'll do better with obby and berserker necklace over dharoks. Dream mentor is also a large source of points, and unless I'm mistaken, any quests you don't have done will still count as the boss being disabled, lowering your points gained.
---
Just when I thought I couldn‚Äôt hate agility anymore lol
---
Crying SMH. I'm having a blast. Especially after iOS mobile came out.
---
I feel like he‚Äôs making a Star Wars midichlorian joke.
---
Maybe be aware of where the person is that youre trading with in a pvp world.
---
Just planked to triple jads cause I was super tired. Hoping to kill zuk this week though! Very excited :)
---
What they're doing is using an item, usually a commorb or a few other select items that have a long animation. Using this, when you activate the commorb, you can move, but your character is still showing the animation, delaying your movement. So, when you trade him, you'll be pulled outside of the safe zone since he is technically outside of it and you die.
---
Please to upload this to youtube.
---
Yes, but I doubt that. If you're gonna hand train why do something like mining for 50M+ XP and like 2-300k/h using a RUNE pickaxe when you could do Zulrah for 3m/H
---
If it's too good to be true just don't do it. You can easily grind for the maul on your own.
---
literally in the middle of the varrok west bank, in a safe zone.
---
Nice so the scenery is similar it the northern cities too huh.
---
Remove non-BIS neckties, it's time
---
So he attacked you inside the bank? Or attacked you after you ran out of the bank?
---
Guildbrainlet Jane
---
that seems like that ignores the bigger issue of the fact that people can use an exploit to scam other people
---
I know I can save up and get it, but I figured after a few minutes of friendly conversation this guy might be nice
---
obviously was not the case
---
Good luck my man, you're definitely killing Jad soon :)
---
But muh dopamine
---
made my cry
---
Oh wow, I'm almost maxed and I had no idea. I've never run into that problem as I've never had a HCIM. I didn't realise that the teleport functionality was added after OSRS launched. TIL.
---
I thought about running a bot farm, but the numbers just didn't make it worth it. I guess if you live in a 3rd world country it might be decent money though.
---
Not sure why this chap is being spanked with downvotes when they're not wrong.
---
- Borrowed Account he spent no time in creating.
---
- PKing Bots.
---
Glory is the one that was made because glory tele is used for quite a few banking methods for skilling, where speed matters - hence glory&gt;house. I very much doubt the wealth would see anywhere near as much use.
---
But I still support it anyway because why not?
---
Yeah, the difference is that telomeres are real, but mitochondria were made up for Wrinkle in Time and later Star Wars
---
The midichlorians are the powerhouse of the telomere.
