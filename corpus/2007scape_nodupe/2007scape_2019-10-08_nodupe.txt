My original account was hacked, botted, and perma banned. Appealed 7 years later. They could tell it was hacked before the bottling and gave it back to me.

Yes, it regens 2hp per minute instead of the standard 1hp.

I use it while training my 1 def pure

Or just, have friends.

^also this when’s it out!

i actually didnt, but not sure what the use would be pretending anyway lmao

Hahaha I should’ve said that instead.

Dragon bones can’t be used in f2p. Best is big bones.

Oh neat! That seems less convenient then having the price hovering right over all items on the ground, but it's nice that they have something.

Hahahhueheu WOW

I got the occult necklace luckily at 8kc, I enjoy these bosses more since the big drops feel awesome! Even KBD feels more rewarding than vorkath due to living or dying getting to the boss haha. I agree with you my man, love the big ticket items more than consistent streams of gp.

Blame jagex, because they should be removing them. several youtubers/streamers have all been recorded using them, so ignorance isnt an option.

Rag bolts meaning dragon bolts, right? Never heard them called that before and thought I’d double check

group ironmen is kinda sad honestly, People getting hyped to play together and stuff while idk.. but that IS EXACTLY WHAT THE NORMAL GAME IS???? good way to use dev time
---
I feel you man. I recently got a 2 day out of nowhere for, "Macroing". Even though I've never been banned for botting or macroing nor have I ever felt the need to macro or bot. I tried to reach out to a Jmod on twitter but he just ignored me. Lmao.

But what the other person is suggesting is that people are breaking the rules and because the system doesn't check for situations like that, they get away with it.
---
Your mom purposefully working 19 hours a week indicates that she was following the rules, not cheating the system. If it allowed her to still work a part-time (or less since part-time is usually 20 hours) and claim unemployment then those are the rules and she's following them.

Coochie
---
So the only time to make a group is lvl 3 at the start, or if you are increasing the group size by inviting a group ironman who is solo. So like a group of 4 high levels can recruit 1 high level who was alone? How does that work.  
---
What happens if you are kicked out can you rejoin other groups? Or are you stuck alone. Or can you recruit with lvl 3s so 4 level 3s and 1 high level.

I'm confused on how the system works

Gotta find something to bring other people's achievements down to they have an excuse to ignore their own mediocrity.
---
Yeah i felt it was really ambiguous and I don't know how the system is supposed to work at the moment. Besides the highscores factor in the largest group you've been in and you can't go down in size atleast for highschores.
---
Mind if I join too? I’m only 67/71/62 melee. I’m currently working on training up to 75 for all through nmz but eventually I’d like to get into raiding and learn some things.
---
At 15 i ate sand..
---
Nice vid man. That's definitely a good alt option
---
Yeah, so if we take your logic in the other direction, there should be no left click options at all because it's easier to left click once than right click into a menu to left click, and something being easier is bad.
---
what were you at revs for?

Ya we've been taught it all wrong from the beginning. You are responsible for your own prosperity, the government should not be your parent.

I don't know but we MUST be a little "off".  Like you said all you have to do is just describe the things you are doing or have done on this game out loud and it's obvious how absurd they are.  It's truly a strange thing.
---
As far as I know there's no convenient one-stop spreadsheet but you can get pretty close between these two wiki pages:

Basically your old account cept be 42 def and no maxed hp. Also anywhere from 90-99 str is fine.
---
I just watched the video you linked to compare. Granted, while the recording quality was decent and they put effort (kind of) into the voices and the story, the actual video quality was nothing special.
---
The camera was always static and there was little to no editing done other than jumping to the next scene. I think that's the level of detail we've come to appreciate now with creators like Settled. The intros, overlays, transitions etc. are all really well thought out and nicely presented.
---
Are obby rings made out of the "flesh and bone" of TzHaar people?

ROFL. You buy one set for collection log, put it in house. You'd never have it somewhere dangerous
---
Yeah some of these I don't understand. There were a few where it's obvious his opponent will attack before him, but he still tries to get the Dharok hit in and dies. Also that zulrah ko was stupid, the snakes can hit like 15 and he had 8hp left. 46% chance he would die if that snake hit.

How exactly do combat stats work? I remember hearing that attack increases accuracy as you level it up, strength increases the damage you do and defence increases your ability to avoid damage. I realised I have no idea who told me that and it might all be a load of bull. Please clarify?

And botting skills would help in doing content you want to do, like bossing.

I use it at Zalcano.
---
Im not a opposed to a 3-some with someone powerful
---
It's very spam clicky if youre doing chins. I can make much more bank doing rc and also relax a bit more doing double astrals or wraths
---
It is probably the most integral part to the entire ritual and definitely not some small unknown ability unlocked from completing the swan song quest
---
I ain’t gay, but $11 is $11

The run on sentences and constant assertions of innocence are tell tale signs of lying. Your emotional response isn't consistent with your argument.
---
Sick.
---
Idk, sounds hilarious
---
Yeah for sure, I wouldn't want an app that requires any info to input, or have to download a suspicious apk
---
You missed the main point - why are these important difficulties in either of these cases?  
---
Prayer already has steep gp costs, which is the main limitation for many players.  
---
Blackjacking already has the right-click -&gt; knock out before clicking to pickpocket.  
---
And this doesn't make either of these faster. This makes these tasks a lot less annoying, but doesn't increase the max xp/hr - you could still do both of these perfectly without the swapper. But the question is still: why is this an interesting or important difficulty to have in either case? Does prayer become afk/ezmode with it? Does blackjacking become afk/ezmode with it?  
---
Is dealing with default left-click options really an essential part of the game?
---
42U 🔥😂👌💯🔥😂😂💯
---
But 3pc doesn’t help with that, does it? Their feature was to make “build” &amp; “destroy” left clickable, no ?
---
$73
---
Well an alternative could be have x amount of player kills before being eligible to vote for such questions. Also the K/D restriction could be for example have K/D &gt; 1.0 or 1.5 so even if it is reset it doesn't make you instantly eligible.
---
Great idea but they’ll probably just end up slapping a Santa hat on Zalcano and call it a day
---
I don't actually. It got noticeably better this evening so I'm hoping it's been smoothed over.
---
Microtransactions
---
This happened to me on my inferno cape, very sad
---
Oof mine is a lot easier to redo
---
Not without email access no. You can REQUEST disabling auth without email access. But it goes to your email lol.
---
The only tracked kills are bh kills. 
---
They have addressed this already, if it was a problem that was just isolated to pvp then sure, but everything they poll has a wider impact than just pvp.
---
I’m not sure about the whole osbuddy thing tbh I don’t use osb. I’ve just read kinda the argument and agreed on a few notes that a few places (not everything) could probably be a little bit less clicking but take the same amount of time
---
Didn't know ranger boots reverse puberty.

Haha my rs3 dude is definitely a evil clown in those boots...  Sometimes miss the game...

Define what is a "pvp question". Almost everything on the last BH poll was something that everyone should have the ability to vote on.
---
The grind isn't actually worth it in the end. Nothing special happens when you get the max cape. Either you feel there's nothing left to do and quit, go for 200m, start collecting, or make another account. And people do it because they enjoy the grind even though it doesn't pay off. It's just fun to watch the numbers go up every day.
---
Bit of non yellow text-black background writing.
---
I think with the twisted tourney coming up, we'll see a lot of lackluster participation or people using the "I don't want to bond my second account" talk. So I thought why not allow players to give their twisted tourney time to another account. These bonds would only allow access to the twisted tourney worlds and could perhaps be required for anyone who wants to play, membs or not. People who have membership already could get them for free from the bond guy outside the GE. Perhaps even people without membs could purchase them for a few hundred k.
---
This way we'd see a lot more people participating in a skill-based event and then maybe jagex would realize catering to PvP is not the only way to get their game popular.
---
🦀WHY $22 WHEN $44🦀
---
True but the impact is normally minimal and people just vote no because it doesn't benefit them. Not even a PKer myself but seeing their community get shit on because people aren't willing to sacrifice little to nothing for the greater benefit of the game. It just breeds a toxic relationship between the communities, and ultimately is probably more detrimental than beneficial.

I legit thought it was a 35 year old...grinding out on every little min as soon he was off his shift

You know you can fill them without closing the bank, right?  Right click on them while the bank is open and hit fill.  It still only pulls from your inv, but it’s better than opening and closing over and over again.
---
So I'm on mobile so excuse the formatting, but on the your first point, 
---
"a big problem is that boters would run rampant if they could make huge profits from easy skilling scripts."
---
Not really, botters dont really run rampant the way a lot of people in this sub say they do. A 'simple' script can be written for mining in a way it can't for zulrah that is true, but a simple script will be detected faster and removed easier. Runescape is a simple game, that is an attraction for a lot of people, that comes with a want for botting, but that shouldn't be a reason to hurt a portion of the community.
---
"Noted drops are an imperfect solution to a few tough problems."
---
What are they? It allows for supply to reach demand (reducing value) instead of allowing demand to dictate an increase in production (by increasing value) say there is a crap job most people won't do, now imagine companies are so desperate for someone they offer double the salary. Now more people apply. If flax no longer drops noted it will no longer cost 3gp, but it will rise as supply depletes until demand gets people to consider picking flax again. I don't see that as an issue. If there is a task seen as unsustainable in that no money is worth the production new skilling methods should be explored, not added to a monster drop table as a bank note imo.
---
Let me know what you think.
---
Any recommendation on what to say
---
Also where mines went and continues to go. Sorry my job hunt wasn’t expedited for you.

Doubt this guy is hurting for cash

Haha this is perf
---
You say "again" as if you're repeating a point, but your comment is backtracking on the one before it and raising an entirely new one. To reiterate, I *don't* "want extra xp without extra effort." I'm just of the opinion that having to click 27x more than you otherwise would is a sufficient increase in difficulty for the reward of better xp rates. Its certainly clear that your opinion is different, but it seems to me that having to click 81 times per inventory to get double the xp rates of when you click twice per inventory is excessive.
---
To address the second part of your comment, I know Jagex considers it a bannable offense, which is why I don't use menu entity swapper any more. My contention is simply that this game has a lot of needlessly grindy shit in it that turns people off of it and could be improved without taking away from the overall experience. Because Jagex refuses to update the vanilla client in any meaningful way, clients like RuneLite serve that purpose, making the game much more enjoyable.
---
Looks more like hespori haha
---
You must not of smoked a spinach roll yet, it's top shelf.
---
Yea I'm already pretty comfortable with the mechanics, killed it about 15 times with 76 magic. The kills were just taking too long which ended up in me dying a few times so that's why I decided to boost levels before going back.
---
I'm pretty poor atm so have been grinding barrows to get money for bursting maniacal monkeys. Getting a bit sick of it though so that's why I was wondering whether its better to get 85 magic or swamp staff before giving zulrah another try.
---
Thanks though :)
---
Wait... Was this you? 
---
I really doubt no-one would pick those up for 10+ seconds if they were visible on the floor.
---
Alright cheers, I might go back and see if i can get consistent kills this time.
---
Can you still get the pet after 200m?
---
Do you want this game to become like RS3?
---
For example, the only question that could _maybe_ be construed as PVP only is the elemental rune question, but it's still aesthetically displeasing to have something that randomly doesn't work outside of the wilderness.
---
I just imagine people turning into bananas and yelling “ITS PEANUT BETTER JELU TIME WAYY AT”😂😂
---
No I completely forgot about that sign, you are correct.
---
Dharok's helmet. You can find some in the crypts under the barrows in morytania
---
I like the idea of there being bonds for just twisted league. But I think they should just be purchasable at less of a cost than the normal ones, maybe around half the price and would make you still f2p but would allow you into the twisted league worlds. This way, Jagex makes more money from people who don’t wanna bond their secondary account just for the twisted league. Doubt it’ll happen, but it would be pretty cool to see.
---
Nope, props to Mr Hesseux69 for randomly doing this on World 378
---
I mainly use the hood for Zulrah at the moment. I decided to keep blessed d’hide instead of Karil’s because I value the prayer bonus and protection in GWD over the magic defence bonus. Thank you!
---
There may have been a certain transaction completed that resulted in the cape
---
Have you tried crying really hard about it
---
Likely story...
---
Then there should be a KC requirement to vote on PVM updates and a skill total level to vote on skill updates, yeah?
---
You can make them with celastrus bark or something like that
---
Ha, you nerds actually bated with your hands?
---
I humped my pillow for *true immersion*
---
True, however the last poll though would have had a drastic economical impact though, especially with the questions that were polled. 
---
Along with also effecting non wilderness mechanics as well.
---
I too hate... 
---
Sweaty maxed accounts
---
...This select group of players really annoy me.
---
I believe you "Fletch" them from Celastrus branches/bark. 
---
The crafting skill is used when you attach an elemental orb.

The bark from the celestrus or however you spell it can be fletched into battlestaves.
---

---
The xp rates and gp rates of farming are completely within your control, there's a lot of freedom associated with it. If you want raw xp, go with trees/fruit trees and you'll be done with your run in about 5-10 minutes.
---
If you want gp, go with herbs and limpwurts (maybe even hops too). Again, you'll be done with that in about a similar amount of time.
---
Those alone are the core necessities of your farm run. Both of those are about the most efficient for their own individual purposes. The rest are almost entirely optional, sans the little extra bit of xp or gp, like from allotments, bushes, compost, whatevers. Those you do if you *really* like the farming grind or want to min-max your available xp for every run you do. But they're still entirely optional if you're going off of efficient runs.
---
Care to, at least, elaborate? I did say it would be controversial.
---
No, all the other skills have been base 50 for a while, they’ve just been waiting on rc to be a complete base 50
---
Thank god, now you can turn it into death runes properly.

Virgin pmods have such bad power trips that jagex took their power down to 1 hour mutes lol.. I've seen scammers straight up tell them to "shut the fuck up I'll just scam on an alt for an hour if you mute me"

100 percent real. Theres an event going on for mental health awareness except the event has hard coded mtx in the event itself. As well theres a post on the runescape sub rn pointing out that jamflex themselves have admitted TH is lootboxes and they strive for dailyscape content
---
I personally love that clue because it’s the only one Runelite isn’t able to completely solve for you, killing the joy of clue scrolls.
---
This is amazing
---
He’s not claiming that,  but again... phobias are treatable? So 6 years of actively avoiding a job is what I’m reading from this guy. And this clearly is too close to home of a subject for you. So I’m out. Don’t feel like getting bitched at by some random mental dude on rs reddit.

Animation smoothing looks terrible

The devs specifically design the animations with the clunkyness in mind

you lose a ton of little tweaks and personality to the animations with smoothing

I thought the ass backwards states were the ones that had it super low..? Did you just out yourself as a pedo lmaoooo
---
Yeah I just read yours. Im not sure why everyone is so against it, its like they are actively fighting stuff away and complain there's nothing left. I think leagues seem cool but I don't think they're going to be popular enough for jagex to warrant doing it again. Seriously even 1% of the xp getting transferred would be cool.
---
Is there a better way of doing it?
---
The huge thing I had about this is it's not osbuddy's place to make these decisions.
---
Everyone's counter argument is always "it should be this way anyway", but then we should poll it. If the majority of people actually want 1 click con it'd pass a poll.
---
I really wish jagex wasn't so lazy about the client.

It doesnt track which monsters dropped the heads? Thats such a jagex thing to do lmao

&gt; defence increases your ability to avoid damage
---
Well worded. It may be a common misconception that def reduces the amount of damage you take, but this is only on average.  
---
The max hit of any damage you *do* take won't change, whether your def is 1 or 99 (unless you're wearing justiciar and/or ely).
---
With hp cape in max cape effect of 2x regen it adds up to 4x

This may sound crazy, but smash your foot with a ball peen hammer until you can't walk anymore.  You aren't allowed to dress the wound, use crutches or a cane, only whatever drugs you can buy on the street or over the counter to deal with it.  Now, instead of using things like health insurance that cover physical injuries, pay your doctor $100/hr for months or years until you can walk again.  Lose your job because you can't walk, causing you to lose insurance, not be able to afford whatever you self-medicated with earlier, etc.  Now, deal with people telling you your foot isn't actually broken because you can still wear shoes every single day, whenever you bring it up.  That's what having mental health problems is like, and you are that person telling him his foot isn't broken.
---
Profit relying on others fighting you and not being as good or better than you. PvM is guaranteed long term due to drop rates flattening out in terms of RNG.
---
PvP being amazing gp is like saying staking is. You have just as much chance to lose 10m some days.
---
I haven’t seen the left-click build but I’m assuming you still need to right-click remove the previous item, or no?
---
I’d argue the difference is whether it has a direct vs indirect impact on xp rates. Shift-clicking dropping has an impact on xp when power mining etc but - and correct me if I’m wrong - three-ticking would have a much bigger impact. Whereas left-click building directly impacts the max xp rates possible. 
---
Potentially clutching at straws here and I’d also agree it’s strongly aligned with if 
---
Jagex did it = good
---
3PC did it = bad
---
But if I was Jagex, that’s how I’d argue the difference ^
---
Congrats :) and super early too!
---
It's definitely one of my fav pets but nowhere near as cool as metamorphed olmlet, zalcano, Zuk or hydra imo.
---
Right now, recoloring graceful either requires marks or grace or agility arena tickets. Both can be turned into something valuable (amalayse crystals or pirate's hook, respectfully). I suspect the trend will continue, especially if they want people to stay long enough to train agility instead of just get black graceful.

People, it drops the bis helm upgrade. It's tough to kill. Deal with it.

Low grade GPU or onboard but with a poor core performance cpu so gpu rendering gets him better and more stable fps.

Just get 99, then you won't have to anymore

You'll make more profit per hour with the trident of the swamp. If you can afford it, go for it.

Don't do it then. You're no where near being considered dry for that pet, as it's a 1/3k rate. Never understand people torturing themselves into doing what is also a shit boss for loot and slay XP. Just do stuff you enjoy. I'm still 1 sire and zulrah KC because of this point.

And still, finnish moms who stay at home with their kids (from kid being 9 months to the date the kid turns 2) you get 330€ per month. System no perfecto
---
that cape but with identical stats to the fire cape. make it have a cd effect to block the next mage hit. then with three cape drops you could take it to an npc to degrade into silk material that can be weaved into the infernal cape giving it a trimmed look and the effect with additional mage def

That sounds like "fun", and fun is xp waste.

I remember accidentally scamming a Sara kite circa 2005 when I offered up 125k instead of 1.25m. Other guy accepted while I was calculating the difference to add to my offer
---
HUGE FAN
---
Pretty much always worth it to swap I believe, the extra max hits will shave a lot of time off your runs. Also if you are still using prayer doses then the reduced time in each tomb will offset that as well.
---
What the actual fuck.  What is your abyssal demon kc???
---
Which means the bracelet is just 2x. Functionally, it's additive, not multiplicative.

Yeah I haven’t researched it enough. Didn’t know if it’s possible with potato sacks like woox did for Corp.

I can't wait for this game mode.  Especially with five man teams.

You have the level for ice burst, which is used for tasks like nechryael or dust devils.

If you have a task like metal dragons and can't skip for some reason, then use iban's blast until 75 mage when you can use trident of the seas (or if you have absolutely no money, slayer dart (e)

---
75 sweets on an iron doesn’t sound like a lot but when you factor in collecting the clues, doing them and rolling the sweet table you’re looking at a lot of time not accounting for failures. Could legitimately be hundreds of hours before one completion which is definitely the longest grind for a KC. I know it’s possible and I know if I cared enough I could get a setup but cbf and will just enjoy watching others until someone slips a less tedious prep method.

Gone now.

Ur not getting funnier, try again

What's your plan for prayer training? I assume rule #2 makes bone drops and ensouled heads out of the question. Burying something like bone yard bones seems fine, but what about offering them at an altar? I guess minigames are also an option (pest control points).
---
i'd try it if they made a game like rs3 but with oldschool graphics. everything just looks so confusing and fucking downright weird there, literally can't get into it whatsoever. game still runs on a tick system anyway despite trying to be some scuffed wow clone with gcd's and all lol

Theres a app called osrs wiki that is a overlay just looked

Create 37 alts to farm your kids

Profitable? 100%, seeing as everything is from scratch.

It’s a fairly AFK, guaranteed way of bringing in cash. Once you have the mage level, use magic to destroy everything.

also you have to be skulled and 0 pray and inv has to be clue + 27 spades

Baiting for views idk? But its the same as all the other wildy tabs.

@ 3.2k KC, bring bones to peaches and high alch. You can pretty much stay until your divine super combat or prayer runs out.

I did Haunted Mine tonight. Was feeling good about my second attempt of the boss and I got hit by a minecart about 5 seconds into the fight and just insta-teled out. I hateed it.
---
i wonder how much the cashstack was, since he lost avernic and infernal plus probably some other stuff
---
If you played in the past you won't experience learning curve till endgame
---
With XP rates so high on the skill, that's a variance of 1% or less.
---
Runescape account trading is illegal and your and his accounts can be banned I'd jagex finds out. He probably just wants your account so he can sell it online.. Just ignore him, reporting him will have no affect
---
File police report ?

Daily quests are what made me finally quit WoW entirely. Login every day just to do menial tasks for free stuff, or a good item after 3 months.  It's definitely addictive and I was hooked. Can't miss out on free stuff.  I really hate them.
---
The trade scam works by the scammer asking you to trade the teleport over, so when most people start left click the items into the trade window, the scammer will X close the trade and the unwitting user ends up left clicking a teleport.
---
Its not the game thats promoting. Its Jagex. The same company that made osrs.
---

This is so wrong, this encourages Jagex to continue their predatory micro transactions.

This is why they say everyone likes treasure hunter. If you log in to do your spins you are just confirming this.

Classic wow is a thing no?

i think only the burning amulet does this actually
---
I started this year because I tried the game back in 2007 and couldnt stand it back then
---
Now Im all for removing OP features like demonic gorillas and menu swapper, but things like ground items, loot tracker, chat commands and GPU are absolutely essential for my enjoyment of the game
---
Thats the joke champ. Same shit happened to me as op. System is fucking doinked.
---
It is an mmoRPG after all 😂😂😂
---
It definitely doesn't. I had researched the shit out of that and apparently having shift-click in the bank interface would require engine work. 
---
Oh well. I had hope.
---
Lies. If you arent asked then you would just chuckle and go on with your day. Why do you think youtubers always ask to like and subscribe?
---
BP+BGS works better for me but just compare how many kills you get per hour and how much supplies you use with and without bgs
---
Art.
---
Nice
---
I think in terms of gear it was needed in some way. OSRS is slowly getting there since we all want new raids and bosses but have no idea what rewards they should give and it normally ends up being a weapon or armour that is only BIS for really niche situations. But eventually it's going to get to the point where without changing the tiers of the weapons and armour in the game there is going to be nothing left to release as drops apart from cosmetics and pets.
---
actually .6 something is their selling price while 0.4 something is buying price and their prices are pretty much the same as other sites

There are many meaningful ways to be employed. Should you not be proud of being a doctor? Should you not be proud to be a chef and bring joy to people? Should you not be proud of being a teacher and engaging young minds?

i remember way back when i was like maybe 15? they had a glitch at the dual arena where you could stay in the leaning position when you watched over the arena. probably spent hours just making trains of hunched over people just because it was fun.

Are you stupid? Lol.

It is tho

---
PoH obelisk warns you aswell off the top of my head
---
Overall it's good for the economy of the game though, otherwise eventually almost all items will eventually trade at alch value.
---
Osrsmv's are my new thing
---
i'd rather just have a GE tax
---
It’s a high volume item on the market. The likelihood of there being so few offers available on the ge that it goes for anything less than under 5-10% it’s market value is very little. Not impossible, but very little. Odds are he just got market price or slightly below market price as it will always go to the highest bidder currently available
---
If you stop to watch, you owe them a coin
---
The problem is it's very rarely better to use a tank.
---
You're normally better to have that extra person as DPS for the faster kill speed

You’re right.  Everyone deals with shit.  I don’t mean to say that you or your family’s depression doesn’t suck, it does and deserves all of the respect.  And I feel the pain of working 60+ hour weeks.  The point where you make too much to get assistance and not making enough to get by is the absolute worst.  I’m also not talking about people in your (or my to be honest) situation here, accusing you or your family of being any less capable or deserving of success than anyone else, or anything of the sort.  I can see how you might have taken my last post like that, and I apologize if I upset you unintentionally.
---
There’s different degrees of mental illness, just like there are different degrees of injury.  A missing finger sucks, but you can work with it.  You can run in the Olympics with prosthetic legs.  Missing an eye?  You can work with that.  However, some people are the equivalent of wheelchair bound, quadruple amputees, blind and deaf, or whatever other ailment we give people a free pass for.  They end up homeless because society doesn’t recognize that they’re crippled, and I shouldn’t need to remind you that getting decent health insurance isn’t an option if you can’t work in this country.   The hobo you see wearing a sandwich board that says “THE END IS NIGH” isn’t doing that because he’s a lazy freeloader, he’s doing that because he’s delusional in a way he can’t control.  Just like someone who can’t walk.  Or they kill themselves rather than deal with life.
---
If you’re the kind of person that doesn’t even want your tax dollars going to help people who get crippled in industrial accidents or something, I don’t think I can really say anything to further this conversation.  If that isn’t the case, the severely mentally ill can have it just as bad, and get almost no help for it.  It’a a shame, because mental illnesses are usually treatable with proper medication and therapy, but we don’t put our resources towards actually making it happen on a large scale.

JAGNEEEEEEX...!!!

Dw, 5 heads and 2 daggers in 13k kc while slayer

the meta now is to not do dragon slayer until you get 69 herblore since they made it so you dont get dragon tasks until you do it.

Does a 90 cmb with 70's stats needs a +1 str that much? I don't think so, there's easier upgrades for you out there bud, so you can go ahead and kill the lower leveled basilisk, these should prove no problem.

What is bank standing,  is that like training crafting or fletching or alcing?

What is the timeline for the new Morytania content?

Also why was Morytania chosen as the region for new updates instead of the desert? (A place which desperately needs content)

It is literally doing the same as DBM/BW/Weak It is not doing anything Automaticly for you it is just saying Pray Mage/Range. and where to stand it is literally the same :D

Yeah setting it up like raids makes the most sense imo

I'm so fucking tired of this narrative, honestly. It drops BiS gear, it's obviously not intended to be mid game anything, "but muh 60 slayer req" be damned.
---
Don't get me wrong, BKs are in a horrific state right now, in dire need of some tweaking, but base 70 melees carrying on about how inaccessible a BiS item is for them just about has my eyes rolling out my skull.

My budget tanking set up was guthans helm, karils top, and veracs skirt. Worked very well

This is fucking awesome info

it's basically a bunyip that does damage

Thank you very much. My advice to any aspiring UIM player would be to complete quests (Quest point cape is extremely useful) and achievement diaries (Desert hard, Kandarin hard, Karamja hard, Kourend hard, Lumbridge elite, Morytania hard, and Western Provinces hard are very useful IMO).

Do those pvmers lose money? Yes? Point and case.

---
Reminded me of the Evil Containment Wave with that pot.
---
Sorry it hadn't popped up for me. But even tho its only 49, you dont need money to level it up. It's easy as well as gets all your skills up in the process. At 70 you can kill kurasks thatll get you like 400k and hour and 75 gets gargoyles that's about 700k an hour. Then slowly get your whip and blowpipe

Could you make it possible for existing ironmen to make a group and just not show them on the world’s firsts scoreboard?
---
I think we are missing many players who don’t have the time to grind a new ironman just for group ironman but would really like to play with their friends. Especially the people who have a fulltime job. These people can’t play nonstop anymore and therefore probably don’t care to be on the world first’s scoreboard anyway.

tbh this but i started getting temp jobs so it's better now

At no point did he state that. He stated that you can do active work to improve your mental health rather than throw in the towel.

Send the bare minimum of job applications required to get unemployment gibs. Have a weird generalist degree nobody knows about so you're not considered/the employer doesn't care enough to research your degree. Compete with people that have 10 years of experience.

I'm 90 cb with base 70s stats. I use a mix of dragon, abyssal, and slayer helmet loadout. I'm praying mage and using a superset boost. It takes me TWO TO THREE MINUTES to kill this "mid-game" enemy now. Better yet, I can only kill 4-5 per trip before I run out of food WHILE praying. I'm wasting all this time and resources just to get 1 grimy avantoe or 500gp... all because of a single BiS item being locked behind this enemy. This is ridiculous and I hope Jagex acknowledges the fact. As far as I'm concerned, until I'm close to max cb with end-game gear, this "mid-game" content is dead to me. Does anyone know if they're planning on fixing this mess?
---
The set hits higher the lower hp you have (don’t have access to the maths currently) but that set ups orobably better at nightmare zone on hp with absorbs pots
---
Not now, if it was 90 from the start that makes it endgame content for an endgame item which would work.

You need 1 HP with Dharoks for some nice xp drops

Skill reqs have very little to do with reward in this game, once you have a reasonable amount of options unlocked. Teak trees are the best wc xp in the game, but are a very early unlock. Does that mean we should change then be as high of a req as redwood trees? Or that because redwoods are worse xp then teaks, they should be a low tier tree?

are you fishing dark crabs just for exp then?

Any timeline on fixing the bug which renders mobile players unable to pick things up from stacks of dropped items?

Hoprfully nothing will be done and there will be a total of 11 people in a pvp world instead of the usual 10.

For the most part, yeah. I know its not nearly as nice as an iPad, but I still really like my Amazon Fire HD10. It does everything I need to do just fine, including OSRS.

Yes and Zulrah should be deleted from the game along with all of its drops. Blowpipe has been one of the worst updates to Old School since its release.

with maxed combat i could do 20 kills per trip with pray mage and divine super cmbs. And the superior monster legit takes 2+ minutes to kill lmao
---
Can I please get a link to Jagex' statement about 3rd party clients from a few weeks ago? I can't seem to find it.
---
Compared to other monsters that drop BIS, this is by far the easiest to kill, it's not hard, there's basically no mechanics, just really tedious. I think it's fine.

It might be a toggled warning

For afk fishing xp. Its basicly redwoods but for fishing

And seed box, and rune pouches of all sizes, and every other item that I'm not thinking of that holds X amount of said item.  See how this might be a problem?  Would make it more convenient yes, but it would be a lot of dev time for such a small time save for those players who fill up the holder items.

I hate to break this to you, but definitely not the first ever 99. I've definitely seen other people with 99s before in Old School RuneScape.

You're a liar. I was killing them without any bother before the nerf and I don't even have great gear. You and everyone else complaining are just lazy.
---
so this is whats going on on RP servers?
---
It kinda is that much to ask, jagex can’t only roll back your account it would have to be a complete rollback and they definitely can’t set the precedent of doing that for every person who accidentally got xp in a skill they didnt want too. It’s not like it was a bug or anything, you just made a preventable mistake, it’s unfortunate but nothing jagex could or should do about it.
---
This sub is ridiculous sometimes. The amount of downvotes that just get rained down on anybody and everybody for little to no reason is crazy. Whenever I scroll through new it seems like every other post is at 0 points, with a good amount of them being legitimate questions from new players or people just sharing achievements or asking if anybody wants to add them.
---
Super super fucking toxic people on here. I really wouldn't be surprised if the game loses a good amount of potential new players based on the interactions they have on this sub. Which now that I think about it, is probably exactly what all the autismo 9000s want. Because, y'know, fuck everybody who isn't maxed and doesn't have complete knowledge of everything in the game.
---
I don’t think you should be giving out money when you’re poor

Devalues bulwark as BiS shield. 😂

Only on RDT, which you can't get in f2p

Sick clue man, ranarr wines of sammy, a ornament kit and the pet, Ironman dream

For the record, I was joking lol.

Nice btw.

Going dry at hydra at least makes you bank so not too bad
---
That'd be badass
---
220 hp vs 300hp, can be afked, 120 defence vs 187.
---
Hahahaha
---
Who? Me? No way, you
---
The best solution would be to ban anyone over 100 cb from slaying these things. 
---
Im going to get downvoted by some selfish maxed players but this is the best solution for the game and the economy.
---
That's what reddit does to you.
---
If you want less stress and less annoyance at the game/players, stop going on reddit and just enjoy the game with your friends and clan mates.

It's never taken me more than 2 minutes in w2 od typing 'clue'

Why was Dagonhai robes polled as the reward for wilderness slayer when Thammaron’s set makes more thematic sense.
---
Firstly thank you for all of the work you guys put into making osrs a great game!
---
So, in terms of priority, whats at the top of the list in terms of development, out of the things revealed at runefest?
---
I realise there will be multiple different teams working on different content, but whats the top priority?
---
that wouldve worked yes, true
---
Big yikes
---
I just got banned on mobile, wasnt botting.. think I got picked up for using a mouse with ios13 accessibility features! Glad im not the only one !
---
Yea
---
&gt; Maybe you DC, forget to turn on prot, forget to sip ppot, there's many ways it can happen just because your hp is lower than your prayer level doesn't mean it's impossible to lose +1s, we're human - we make mistakes.
---
Right but that has nothing to do with being smited. It’s pretty much impossible to be smited for anything on a 10 hp account unless something beyond your control happens like a dc. 
---
10 hp accounts aren’t well suited to deep wild stuff for obvious reasons. They can’t stay and fight someone. They’re just low combat rushing accounts designed to get free emblems or stack someone out in a PvP world. So again their purpose plus the fact that it’s extremely difficult to smite a 10 hp account unless you redbar them 3 to 4 times and they don’t drink a restore sip makes it pretty much impossible to smite them.
---
I'm guessing your not a nice person?
---
Does the effect of the upgraded torture (blood shard + torture) work in both PvM and PvP?
---
To be fair, the people that maxed within the first year of OSRS' launch didn't need any new content after that, but stuff has been added over time anyways. Why even have new content?
---
If you’re training at crabs full obsidian with berserker necklace is very good
---
Where is tome of fire and mages book?
---
It has made me bank, but at this point on my ironman. I have more then enough money to do the buyables, and enough to purchase runes/supplies. But I would to do other things in this game then hydra. I know I could just move on, but I'm too committed and stubborn stop at this point.
---
Nice man, I used to do this with some beer and kebabs

True that. It's not the end of the world of course, just a little inconvenient.

I didn't delete it, I think the Reddit mods hid it? =(
---
Yeah it's really shitty how they do that. People always say 'grass is always greener on the other side', but it's pretty painful to see how Jagex is comparatively so blatantly treating Rs3 like shit.
---
I guess my phone is $2000 so yes?
---
It's like they outsourced the writing to an actual writung department. For all the worldbuilding and lore, bethesda games of late have lacked so much in plots
---
Blood shard would just be dead content if they put it on fury. Nobody is going to bring fury over anguish/torture/occult ANYWHERE. DPS matters far more to the vast majority of the player base than some paltry 1 or 2 hp every once in a while. Fury is a hybrid amulet with decent defenses, that's the niche it has like barrows gloves.
---
Didn’t you steal those in the first place?
---
I prefer to melee vorkath. 5-6 kills per trip avg kills 1:30, PB is like 55 seconds or something. Your melee switch gear is instead just the bgs and takes up one inventory space so a ton of extra food.
---
Remove BIS bookshelf, it’s time.
---
Add \~23m for the actual price of the jaw.
---
Honestly I think both games are great and if it weren't for all the mtx I would highly recommend rs3. The community is just dying a slow death at this point though and they dont want to the fix the actual problems unfortunately

In all seriousness is this a POH feature? Idk why I always thought u could store all ur books there.

I leveled hunter from 60 to 99 exclusively from birdhouse runs.

Best part of that, the birds nests basically financed my herblore from 81 to like 95
---
Yes
---
No i'm saying you don't need to censor "banned" and "botted" because whatever idea you have about reddit hiding threads doesn't work because there are tons of threads about it.
---
it looks like you're either 5 and you're "not saying it" because it makes you cool to say a bad word, like kids whispering curses and giggling. Or it looks like you're trying to sneak through a loophole, "hahah, I never said i never botted, you just assumed thats what i meant but i really meant betted, cuz i'm not staker tehehe"
---
Lets. Do. Both.
---
Your stats are too low for DH to out-dps obby, especially if you're leaving your character afk.
---
This should also increase home tele cast time by 10 seconds since you have to look around for the book
---
really? shows how much i know about inferno lol. I fell like that should be a thing, 1 fire cape per attempt.
---
This video is kind of poetic if you think about it. He knew the decline was upon us.
---
Look at all the other threads I posted.... they all got automatically hidden because it's apparently against Reddit rules - This one didn't get hidden because I censored macro and ban
---
No, they passed the poll as a 60 slayer level requirement monster. They should be treated as such.
---
Are you guthix? Because you know how to balance
---
Never experienced it. Quit in 2009 so just about missed on that.
---
Hugo1 does cool San Andreas speedruns if that interests you
---
Is NMZ efficient with shitty gear/lvl 80?
---
Did the Morytania expansion just pass you by?
---
I collect seeds got 150M so far
---
That’s not what passed the poll. BIS helmet upgrade passed for the 60 slayer requirement monster.
---
Ammonite crabs. I like to train there at work when I’m not using my phone to masturbate in the bathroom.
---
This right here. Melee method is lowkey the better method at vorkath. No need for extra melee gear for specs to hit. It's a lot easier to "woox walk" with the lance as well. 10/10 would recommend.
---
Not sure what the whole whip thing has to do with that, seems like a stupid comparison and a fail at trying to correlate the two subjects. But the point of the herb sack is for you to store unnoted herbs, yes monsters drop noted and unnoted herbs, most of the time if the monster drops noted herbs then the other drops most likely don't fill your inv to the brim which means that you wouldnt need to bring your herbsack anyways. Herb sack isn't always a must bring item, but some people seem to not be able to live without it. Its only useful on Abby specs and i think kurasks(?) not sure don't quote me on it, i stoppped playing rs.
---
The whole library? Filthy casual, I’m secluded on the first floor

Well inferno was done by a lvl 46 with a mith cbow lol

except now you need to use ppots

So you are going to kill stuff, takes it loot, and then sell it? That's pretty much just the goal of everyone account
---
How tf does this guy have a fire cape and I still don't.

this is also what i did
---
They don't want to give a date because it depends on the clan system, which requires them to create a consistent unique id that the game worlds can use. 
---
As with all software development, it's really hard to judge how long this will take in advance.
---
Did you watch the video
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
I would definitely recommend starting as a regular player until you've explored the majority of content *again*. Ironman mode is daunting and gets boring very quick. Play regular mode, begin to enjoy the game again, nostalgia kicks in and boom, trapped. That's when you make your ironman btw. Gl
---
Regular basilisk knights drop jaw fragments, and the boss counterpart drops the jaw in full? The knights should feel like a 60 slayer monster. A boss would be an option
---
Yessir
---
yes, 1.6k is a noob and so is 1.8k, might hurt to hear but it isn't 2015 anymore.
---
This makes slayer zero time because you can just partner with an alt and have the alt train slayer, getting xp gains on your main with zero time investment.
---
2020
---
Is the Wiki defense stats for basilisk knights incorrect? Bc their defense according to the wiki is very low. Maybe that's pre-buff though.
---
Can the new boss have a lot mechanic like zulcano so iron man and mains can play together
---
I said "if they don't care about ranks". 
---
It allows future ironmen to get some amount of extra bank space for free.
---
You are a comedic genius, buttholes.
---
you're whining more than any of the supposed "whining ass bitches"

I decided to put all BiS armour items into an easy-to-read table. I think this format is interesting because it highlights some missing niches:
---
* There is no body or leg armour with melee accuracy (besides Void melee set)
---
* There is no +6 slash cape
---
* There are no +3 slash/crush boots
---
* There are no +6 stab/slash helms
---
* Barrows gloves functions as BiS tank gloves and BiS offensive ranged gloves
---
* Infernal cape is BiS defensive and tanking cape
---
* BiS Magic defence is an interesting assortment of both ranged and magic gear
---
* There are very few ranged strength -yielding items (although that's probably for the better)
---
* There is no magic damage boosting offhand, boots, or rings
---
* Most of the BiS prayer items are a bit lower tier compared to the other items on the table.
---
I will probably do the same type of table for weapons when I get around to it, but I just wanted to focus on armour here.
---
The jealous side of me Hope's you enjoy the next 109 years of bad luck. Big congrats that's actually crazy.
---
I would if i have any :/
---
Are maxed sweatys human? They have access to every Slayer mob in the game, ability to do any boss, and they take this away from mid-level players because of what will be a 10m item or less?
---
Minigame, not skill, like many others. As a skill, looking back it really didn't make sense, but as a minigame, it was fun

Is anyone over 100 combat who isn't an ironman still killing them? Doesn't seem worth anyone else's time anymore.

Yea im guessing my dry streak at raids will now continue for en eternity.
---
Because jagex in their infinite wisdom decided jewelery interfaces at furnace were more important than the carpel tunnel inducing hell that construction training is, and third party clients reacted accordingly.
---
Regular for sure. Ironman early on can be very tedious.
---
8 hours a day are rookie numbers.
---
What the fuck is that format dude
---
No-one seems to know about MM2 monkeys, ~100k xp/h at higher levels with very low effort.

It’s intentional because jagex don’t want any goblin boys beating ds2 with their beta recoils

This isn't meant to be negative, but how did he make it entertaining?  
---
I'm watching it for the dumb grinds, sure his personality helps a lot but it's not like he can just transition into being a lounge singer just because he played OSRS.

You judge this based on what?

/r/WatchPeopleDieInside
---
NO
---
Is that a CHP car?
---
What did you do?
---
I looked up the questline on the wikis buy there's a bunch of them. The last few seem pretty standard except for the member betraying you.
---
Acerbic defender still better for melee. But new BiS mage/range. You know how much range gear is neglected.
---
its definately not 1/2k off task, I'm 6400 dry off task, which means I would be 3x over drop rate. From what I have seen and heard its 1/800 on, and 1/4000 off, as ash said its 5x rarer off task
---
And add all stats to it
---
I think galvek isn't really attacking you there.
---
You attack a npc that just has loads of hp, and you get damaged by the area.
---
Its easier to code I guess for stuff like that. So your recoil doesn't really have the correct target.
---
Atleast thats my best guess.
---
The cycle begins
---
Add 200 pounds of weight to your character? Do it... Drain your run energy to 0 with it in your inventory after 2 seconds of running with 99 agility and full weight reducing clothing.
---
You would be an actual mage.
---
Will Group Ironman still allow for the new Lumbridge tasks to be completed? As an experienced player going to encourage people with no-experience to tag along for the ride, I’d like them to have that hand holding detour as I think it does break the game world open nicely.
---
Lol.. Disrespectful?? Thats some soft ass shit for a grown man to feel disrespected by someone saying English.. Everyone knows that just means can you explain in a more dumbed down way because I dont understand.. But okthxbye
---
That’s actually a brilliant solution.
---
I understand your suggestion and I agree with it.
---
Sadly you would have to block ironman from using said boost because of the obvious reasons that some skills could be way easier to train on leagues and even with a nerfed xp rate it would be inbalanced.
---
I remember getting some runecrafting levels from rushing rc in darkscape. I feel like its fine to an extent.
---
Diablo 3 let you keep gears after a season. Obivously league cannot let you keep items for multiple reason but I feel like a split of the xp could be balanced.
---
Sadly this will never pass a poll because people just hate on everything that is fun.
---
Have a good day!
---
Damnit Jagex!
---
I couldn't agree more. It's like people have this inbuilt fear that anything that doesn't keep osrs on its old-style which was restrictive, rigid, and content revoking; it'll become rs3 and the world will come to and end.
---
What updates are you talking about? I don't even play that much and think there should be more updates.
---

Seems a little too easy. Should check out my area maxed completionist uim locked to the falador estate agency. 2700 in game hours of waiting for imps to walk in to get enough money to buy a house
---
A group iron with a 1 p2p and 1 f2p would be considered a p2p group for most purposes
---
Not boss, just highest combat level monster when the game was first released
---
Very nice. Interested in going with me sometime?
---
Oh wow that seems like a lot. Thanks for the help!
---
I completely agree with companies not mixing them, but I am curious about why you feel that way about the player base taking a stand.
---
You’re a noob then
---
Can we have Hardcore Group Ironman on Release. I'd really like to have a group that slowly falls apart.
---
You're totally right, I'm 23 now but in middle school my cousin and I would schedule "wildy days" where we would take off all gear and just explore the wilderness. We were literally in awe seeing the big bosses and the dragons and lava. Nothing will ever top those days
---
I do not, sorry bud
---
yeah pretty much
---
Not everyone does,  but that is the answer to your question regardless. That or autotyper bot lol
---
“ThIS iS FrOm DkS” ye ur very big brained I think that’s the joke
---
How is ranged not neglected? Stuff like KQ and Vet'ion even have phases where you can't attack with ranged...
---
"efficient" I think is 94 hp, but its not a huge deal honestly.
---
Idk anything about serp helm for irons, but it isn't so useful for mains so maybe break it for scales. Look into what others recommend first though.
---
Rule of thumb I used is 90+ str/hp
---
I miss it too. The concept of it was great, and it was accessible to casual players. I loved that you could just hop in with random people and use all your skills to help out the group. Many friendships were forged in the dungeons of Daemonheim.
---
+30 prayer bonus and a handful of teles in one slot? I’m in
---
Xiaomi mi pad 4! Cheap and good
---
“Feels like I’m wearing nothing at all!
---
...nothing at all!
---
...nothing at all!”
---
You would have been lucky*
---
It starts being worth it around 90 hp if you're paying full attention and keeping your hp at 1.
---
What I. Meant is, I didn't script it.
---
The idea of this makes me tremendously happy.
---
The lean glitch... I had a youtube video that Jagex copy-struck down back in the day on this.
---
Anyone remember the glitch on the granite maul where if you simply spammed the special bar it would continually spec? And when you had spec you could stack like 4 or 5 gmaul hits at once. It never gets mentioned but I actually had hypercam footage back in the day of it.
---
If you want to use fancy words to sound smart, don't use them incorrectly.
---
Disagree. If by a 2 weeks you mean a few months sure there will be a couple pieces of new content probably but I'm not going to complain about having more game to play.
---
Still not as many upvotes as Settled.
---
NGL I'd let God Ash pop my cherry mx brown.

---
Can we ever expect ornamental kits for the graceful set? It's the most commonly worn outfit in the game and the look gets repetitive. Diversifying the base graceful set in other ways than just basic recolors would be very appealing. 
---
It'd be cool if there was a unique drop from the Hallowed Sepulchre that gave the black graceful more of a vampire aesthetic.
---
True! Pretty crazy!
---
I think this is impossible without tanking the spider, the spellbook swap animation takes so long that you can’t crumble in time
---
They should have standard drops worth the cost in supplies. Oh boy let's spend 20m in supplies to get a 30m drop. 
---
If they added a second drop table that dropped food and prayer pots then it would be okay. You're literally burning money until you hit the jaw.
---
Flowshart btw
---
I hate this argument because I said it would be too easy and time of people replied with "BuT wE dOnT kNOw hOw HaRd tHEy WiLl bE" and no suddenly the opposite excuse us being used to justify them?
---
No. But I am sad that we'll never get anything new like sailing, ranching, archaeology, or even warding (which should have just been an expansion to rc)
---
The closest thing we have to DG is The Gauntlet, but it's just far more tedious because all the rooms look the same, the boss is always the same and the way you complete it is essentially the same, and it uses far fewer skills. There's just far less focus on exploration than there was in dungeoneering. CoX is pretty similar to DG but feels and plays very different.
---
I used wildy slayer for my herb sack. If you three item (helm ammy and weapon) and turn player attack off you get points very easily.
---
Back then I just used idungeon for my chaotics and 99 dungeoneering
---
It's a damn good thing some people aren't game devs.
---
Then again, this is probably how we got shit like most mobile games.
---
Nah raids aren't much alike with dng. The gauntlet is a very watered down solo dng. But because it pretty much flopped, I worry that they will take that as a dg minigame remake not being worth their time.
---
NMZ. Buy absorption pots then rock cake down to 1hp, absorb up to 1000 and afk. Rock cake back down to 1 every now and then - I'd say don't go higher than 10hp. Take a few super sets or super combat potions if gp isn't an issue.   
---
Use either your max strength gear or obby set and berserker necklace. Don't use dharoks despite what some people might say.  
---
Hard mode will yield a lot of points, normal not so many but you'll last longer. I'd recommend hard, you can then use the points to buy herb boxes and imbue certain items.
---
Haha thanks I'll just keep typing dont really wanna use a bot
---
I do too but im not holding my breath. The thieves guild in Oblivion was also amazing, what a questline. Mages was okay, and fighters was decebt.
---
Shivering isles however... Otherworldly. Literally. Oblivion was where I spent my youth, and now that I have a computer again I'll have to download that shit and get into it this weekend

As everyone said, this is what mousekeys does.  As long as you remap the key and it has only one function (pressing 5 left clicks) per keystroke then you're golden.  Iirc the issue with autohotkeys was that they allowed you to perform more than one function per keystroke .

---
Will the Leagues high score table track stats, points gained or both?
---
I’m perfectly fine with how they were at release. BIS doesn’t always have to come from endgame sweat content. Pre-Serp the best in slot helmet was a quest reward.
---
a while ago i made suggestions for stuff like scaling weapons and armor that are upgraded based on how much resource you put into them IE in the same process as folding steel.
---
this would allow you to put in an exponential amount of tier resources to upgrade its effectiveness based on tier.
---
so this would mean like a rune item would take a bunch of rune bars to get to tier 50, a ton to get to 60, a houseload to get to 70.
---
Ty Cheers!
---
in
---
My first pet so I'm stoked for both reasons.
---
If you're only bringing 3 items you don't need a clue box, waste of 50k if you get pkd since it's always lost.
---
Additionally, you can bring diary items to the wildy, they're lost before clues, so you can have some extra protection. The morytania legs have a pretty close tp to a bank with the Burgh tele.
---
It's funny to me that a grown ass adult with a proper job had to sit down and design a fire giant booty.
---
If you rock cake down to 1 hp, the only hit a monster could roll on you is 1. Therefore your absorption pool can only be reduced by 1 if they land a hit roll. It basically means as long as you are paying attention and cancel your hp recovering you can stay in NMZ training for a very long time.
---
SotE really isn’t that hard. The boss just comes down to stats and RNG. What are your cb stats?
---
yeah but he said he is now legal even tho he is now 19?
---
idk, that dude was just on one lol
---
Iirc you might be able to email billing support or something and get it converted, if they bother to read your email, that is.
---
It sounded condescending and I disagreed with it, none of the points held any value imo. OP states that's they keep making new quests, somebody replies, actually, it's been a bunch of sequels, then you say how the sequels weren't needed, or were more stand alone than sequels. The quests mentioned we're specifically pitched to us by jagex as a continuation of a specific storyline, and then you tell others to re-read your opinion that ignores what jagex's intention was completely, yeah I mean I downvoted you.
---
Yah, tis so!
---
Other people may have argued that, I did not. Unlike your strawmen you’re using to argue, I had reasonable expectations for what a 60 slayer requirement involved difficulty wise.
---
First of all if it's not obvious in that post I wasn't talking about Jatex I meant larger companies like EA and Activision that have had the life sucked out of them. Second I don't know what it's actually like, I just hear stories of the pressure these large companies put on their employees. To be perfectly honest I wasnt really thinking when I wrote that comment, once I started writing I was just overwhelmed with hate and disgust of the game industry and needed to vent.
---
Bookshelf of Gielenor
---
People(The guy I'm responding to specifically) are calling for it to require 90 thieving for blood shard. Nobody using guthans has 90 thieving lol. You people can't call it endgame content then bring up midgame content.
---
Fuse was doing hard clues without banking like a dummy. Framed seea this. Borrows fuses friend erics account and kills him since he had like 2 food. Fuse was mad but now im excited to rebuild. Its all in his recent youtube video
---
because raids suck major ass
---
You can also get rid of non members stuff as long as you get below the item limit.
---
Yea he said that took over 4 months of mining
---
We need a BIS +6 Slash cape soon.
---
This is a future attachment for dinhs
---
I loved how it rewarded you the more work you put into your total level. True endgame content. People even got 200m XP for fun and not for ranks, **and kept Dungeoneering post-200m**. Does this not tell Jagex anything?
---
Meth.
---
So the same guy who wants a 90 thieving req on it also wants it only used on the level 70s running around with furies, there's no winning an argument with you people because none of you know what you even want this content aimed at.
---
I haven’t even gotten a basilisk task... I unlocked it from Steve and all that, still not even a task, I did the quest on release if that helps show how long I haven’t gotten one
---
Looks a bit too much like Yanni to me. I know you used other map assets to make it though. I suppose it’s a good place holder tho to show you want a town there.
---
Then dont die scrub.

I don't think this is true. I get them from Magic trees too.
---
Poll it so I can vote no.
---
&gt; I don't see many people with low slayer at decent combat
---
A lot of people who play this game to play with friends or for the social element just NMZ to go bossing quickly.
---
CARRY IT LIKE DIHNS BULLWARK!
---
Serp is useless because it's absurdly expensive to use and has -5 range/mage attack that make it horrible for hybridding. Serp was bad even before this update.
---
If you're shit, maybe. ToB and CoX at least have a little variation to them instead of slapping the same monster 2000 times. You also make a lot more money from doing them as well.
---
Sweet, I'll make sure not to let my dreams be dreams by having good RNG. Thanks for your great advice OP. All this time I thought I had to get good at the game, but no actually I just needed the right RNG.
---
You might go 5k dry anywhere, that doesn't mean anything. The point is that you break even until you get a big drop. That's how drop tables are generally supposed to work
---

---
Any tree can get clue nests I’m sure I got loads of them from cutting 4K oaks. Banked the beginner/easy/hards when I got them and then kept doing the meds as I received them so that when I rolled a clue it didn’t give me another easy
---
Other than pet farmers no high level kills bandos, it's mostly level 90s and 100s in guthans and other mid tier gear. Graardor is by far the easiest gwd boss. If you had said kree'arra or zilyana I probably would agree with you.
---
It’s literally Yani lmao
---
I do vorkath because it's chill money and I don't have to fuck around looking for a raids team, other people disagree with your opinions because they just disagree with your opinions
---
People say the average drop is 3k because they're too lazy to kill enough to hit the 25m unique drop. It's like spending 2m arma without getting a drop then complaining that arma is shit gp/hr
---
Can we sort this thread by new for a chance? Or try it out?
---
🦀🦀$11$🦀🦀

I was astonished
---
Still not mid level. Groups of level 95-100 cb are not doing gwd

Haha true I like to believe he used moms cc for mems

Meanwhile, I get 37k from an Elite clue scroll...

Average redditor logic - you can have an opinion but if I don’t like it then it’s cancer for the game and the pizza bagels cooled off early tonight
---
And change the mining spots to ice piles
---
Gave my buddy 20m after I got a scythe split. He used it for prayer, construction and bought some gear. Felt so nice to help him out especially when 20m to him is worth sooo much more than to myself.
---
It has 25m drop, not all drop tables need to be profit all the time. They are still 2m+ an hour at 60 slayer and there was no need to even add a bis helm to this content
---
I’m sure too, but would be pretty cool if you had extra heads and could give them to your group to recolor the slayer helm
---
He didn’t add the arrows but it looks like the “loose and shit ton of money” and LMS blocks push you back to “Are you skilled at pking”. If yes make money, if no, loose money or do lms again. But I agree it’s probably not the best overall lol.

It's not that rare, it's happened to me on several occasions and I haven't even invested heavily into mobile gameplay.

I just got 99 hunter a few days back :D oh on mobile, btw

If you actually pvmed and went to GWD you'd constantly see teams of 3-5 level 100s on half the worlds.

Wasn’t it a few hundred mill?
---
i get what he means... ive been in between jobs for months at a time before. during these periods I always had income to support myself through various odd jobs (treework, guitar lesson, uber, etc.,), but since none of these were everyday stable jobs i sort of considered myself unemployed. working an inconsistent 3-4 days a week not advancing in your career path for months at a time is a weird limbo because you are defeinitely contributing to society, but you (or at least myself personally) dont feel like you are contributing to your personal growth... you still feel unemployed
---
well. Yes but...LISTEN ALRIGHT IT COULD BE "Why do you have a family?" AND HE'D HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY WHICH COULD MEAN EXPLAINING HOW.

this examine thing on mobile has been posted so many times i'm surprised it isn't fixed yet

Yeahhh. I’m totally against the buff, but the quest mobs and boss were cake.

If I recall correctly, it has something to do with the strength/hardness of the gem. The economic value isn't really a qualifying factor.

Very true! You’re a good man.

Brilliant.

Joey bonzo ladies and gentlemen

I'm out.
---
I got the mask on my first kill on my HCIM. They tell me it's rare. I'm sorry tho.
---
Fighter hat is currently only used by 1 attack pures and even then its use is more for fashion.
---
Inferno cape retains its utility with its massive +8 strength as well as overall good stats. Mythic and ardy cape dont affect it at all, and a cape with say +16 defensive stats and no offensive stats won't compete with Infernal anywhere.
---
I agree that ranged and mage strength bonus need to be costly and rare and perhaps come with very low stats elsewhere.
---
Personally i knew about the trick but not that it still works with hidden player attack options

ITT: everyone who disagree and enjoys this clue step is downvoted.
---
Considering I pulled it in a duo ffa when it was 1.06b, I could’ve given more 😂😂 but he was too stoked to realize that. He just sold his entire bank for rigour and I told him once he finishes b gloves I’ll let him use all the gear he wants - scythe bow Kodai rapier lance etc. (irl friend, not some internet rando)
---
How do you know the routes tho. Explain like I'm five
---
Outstanding move.
---
The previous BiS item was a quest reward. Not every BiS item needs to be from the hardest of hard. Case in point: Mage Arena 2 capes, Barrows gloves, Black Mask, etc.
---
“It’s frustrating to put players at a disadvantage when they choose not to play parts of the game that enables that advantage”
---
where did they ever say it was supposed to be mid-game?
---
Really? I've never done werewolf before aside from the clue step.
---
Why have beloved minigames that we've all asked for like Stealing Creation and FoG when you can have one like LMS that nobody asked for instead?
---
its 1/800 on task thats 31k per kill average long term just from jaw drops
---
Well, it has mage defense that might cause my ice barrages to splash, so it clearly does deserve an unpolled nerf. Without landing a barrage, how am I supposed to make people hold still long enough for me to type Sit?
---
Yes this part wasn't worded well admittedly. It's frustrating that someone who can use a pick can't also hold it
---
Sweet! Now i can bribe them into muting people IRL
---
How to get around things like elvarg, lizardman shaman and others, that drain prayer?
---
Can confirm died 300000 times to Jad still no cape.
---
i wouldn't consider someones sexual orientation important enough to label it politics.
---
So what happens is someone will offer to buy your Tbow for max cash, but they will put up platinum tokens that are almost replicated max cash digits, but the actual value is 2.147mil instead of 2.247bil. The scam is essentially you get too excited and accept. 
---
My argument is that if you have played the game long enough and are skilled enough to manage to accumulate the wealth for a Tbow, you should have almost zero excuse to fall for this kind of scam.
---
My bad.
---
I understand, but you can see why it's kind of frustrating to argue about.
---
Yes and no.
---
The "pray melee and facetank" method will probably net you 1-2 kill trips, but it's pretty easy to do so if you're OK with that then no.
---
The more advanced prayer flicking methods will net you much longer trips... But they're much harder to do, and you'll probably  die a lot while learning from taking a hit from bandos without prot v.s. melee up.
---
There's also the issue of your stats... Versus the boss they're good enough, but Bandos is the most popular GWD boss. Someone with 99/99/99 and better gear might crash you without a second thought. Same thing if a team comes by - A team with someone that has 99 range and max range gear would steal most kills away from you. So if you're playing during peak hours, then yeah you're going to have a hard time.
---
Its definitely not 2m/hr bud. Not even 2m per extended task.
---
The best way to get around this problem is to create a normal account and never log into your ironman again.
---
how long have prims been ~30m? this helm is a bigger upgrade to nietz than prims are to dragon boots.
---
Everyone is saying you need to be maxed and be on task to kill these, and no one will bother.
---
you kill a more of these per hour than cerb, but the jaw is rarer than prim crystal, everyone gets assigned hell hounds unless they opt-out by blocking, but you have to opt-in by unlocking basilisks, so theres probably similar number of people killing them
---
where did they call it mid game?
---
I played pre-sequel first and fell in love with playing as Claptrap and now I cant get into 2. 
---
Maybe I'll try again since it's on my mind now.
---
So you don’t have to do it later I assume
---
I love the idea of multiple pyramids! That's always bugged me
---
Wasn't this guy spamming his CC on this subreddit constantly? I guess this is why.
---
Are there any quest requirements to do the fight caves? 
---
Can I use a magic shortbow I to get a firecape? Or do I have to use a crossbow so I can equip a shield. 
---
I just really feel like the Runecrossbow doesn't hit a whole lot and I can't afford to get a better crossbow
---
I understand where you’re coming from as well. It doesn’t make any logical sense that you can’t equip it lol maybe perhaps find a middle ground like you can equip it without the atk level but must unequip to trigger the spec attack for the lvl boost (with atk req can trigger while equipped as it is now). Still leaves a bit of a disadvantage without the atk lvl thus keeping the interconnection of skills, but does allow you to save one invent space if you so wish to make a combat lvl restricted acc, and fixes the logic of being able to hold tools without the atk req
---
That's a lot but pretty small compared to the rarity of a lot of drop.
---
Gooose Game looks a lot of fun. Wish it was coming out on PC sooner
---
You can hide drop by right clicking or something
---
Burst?

Only one stat that matters in PVM and that's melee/ranged strength.

there is nothing wrong with hong kong everybody is on vacation please don't look any further

Please no, farming mobs for a chance to fight a boss is the epitome of annoying grinds in this game. Should've just made it a normal slayer boss, proven and tested concept

Yeah I wouldn't be opposed to some sort of compromise. Just seems like an odd thing that has just been overlooked and now it's just the way it is because it's the way it's been.
---
&gt; It's why proper end-game mobs don't drop just trash with 1 good super rare drop.
---
gwd is the perfect design, giving basilisks multiple uniques would be silly though
---
the trend of every bossing being 3m/hr in just alchables is very stupid

If you have a buddy who wants to play, then I totally get feeding him/her gear at level 1 to help in leveling etc. But the add/drop group mechanic will definitely get defiled by one guy neckbearding 5 accounts etc
---
I'd definitely recommend OSRS to anyone. A good goal to get yourself acclimated to the game would have to be quest cape and the diaries! They'll get you levels and perks that will help your whole game experience.
---
Oh, didn’t think about the crashing situation, I want to start learning hard pvming bosses and prayer flicks, to eventually doing cox, but don’t know where to start and was afraid of bandos, so I thought to myself I should go for him first
---
I remember having to resort to scammer tactics when trying to do this clue because no one wanted to help out. Said some shit like "challenge me for a prize, you won't regret it."  After completing my clue step I traded him a lobster and said "enjoy the free dinner m8" and hopped.
---
the HA value is really just its protect on death value, runelite uses it as HA value. use the vanilla client and you wont run into this lol
---
Dont make a ironman, get waterfall quest, tree gnome village and the grand tree done asap then aim for dragon slayer then barrows gloves
---
Ardy knights
---
Yeah bro, definitely worth a shot. If you want to skip the early game do waterfall quest asap.
---
If you wanna enjoy yourself, do some f2p quests and then move on to more. Go for fairytale II right away because traveling around the world right away is gunna suuuuuuck if you’re used to rs3.
---
I use bonecrusher fairly exclusively on prayer based tasks in the catacombs and B2P when the bones are compatible and guthans isn't feasible.
---
100% will depend on the task
---
I think they're saying that because of the drop rate. I can kill about 40 an hour, and I think I get somewhere around 15k xp an hour. If the drop rate is 750, I have a 50% chance of getting the drop after about 500 kills. That's 12 hours. Now I do get ranged xp, but I'm also not guaranteed the drop.
---
In 12 hours at zalcano, I could make at least 24 mil, probably more, even without a unique. 
---
You know way more about slayer than me, but for my levels, these creatures don't seem to make sense for money or for xp.
---
Did you read the poll questions before you voted? This content was very clearly focused at mid-level. 60 slayer isn’t exactly the pinnacle of PvM.
---
A JMod tweeted about the OSRS team working on this and that it might be awhile because of apple approvals.
---
ahhh i see now, makes sense.
---
I've played for 12 years. Pre-eoc I got to 88rc on lamps and books lol. I don't do anything I don't wanna do ever haha.
---
Sire is an easy one though, use Arclite and Hally you can pretty much KO last phase
---
For elvarg, i have full bandos and lance. NMZ provides the antifire shield
---
For the little lizardman that can poison, i usually take 1 sanfew, but on budget you can take antidote++
---
For prayer draining monsters, well pray pots or restores. Restores are better because if elvarg/karamel/other stat reducing boss suddenly hits you and drains your stats then you can sip restore to restore stats (+plus prayer). And you really dont so much need prayer (if you want to sweat with piety but i usually flick it) but for kameel (dt ice boss) and karamel to warp them close to you to put mage pray on
---
For extra bonus i also bring trident so i can hit other mage weak bosses while safespotting them. This is also very useful when fighting against prayer draining bosses (barrelchest and damis' 2nd form comes first in mind)
---
The orange one :^)

Y’all remember when troll posts had actual bait

Solid choice!
---
These questions are regarding the proposed Ashihama. It got a bit long sorry.
---
Main points:
---
Less Tbow/Blowpipe
---
More magic
---
Harder to get to and focus on longer trips
---
Can we please move away from the Tbow/Blowpipe meta in high level PVM? An easy solution would be requiring an offhand item to block Tbow and blowpipe or damage reductions like Corp.
---
I would also love to see magic as the meta for Ashihama. There's a lot of potential with Elemental spells, God spells, different ancients types, crumble undead, etc. to make some interesting mechanics. 
---
Can we also make it harder to get there so you have to gear around surviving as long as you can.
---
If you look at a lot of the high level pvm (Corp, zulrah, vork, sire, hydra, CoX, etc). Trips are geared around max DPS with a little bit of food and banking every few kills. It would be great to see a change where there's more emphasis on survivability.
---
Whether that means it takes longer to get to the boss due to having to get something like a kill count, or some sort of item sacrifice, I don't know. But the aim would basically be to make a time/cost investment to reach the boss that drives you towards trying to survive as long as possible.
---
I pretty much only use b2p at gwd bosses now, SGS replaces it pretty much anywhere you'd use it outside of those.If you don't have SGS I would bring both, and just turn bonecrusher off when you're low on hp and need bones.
---
Support

why would it not apply to the uim?

i thought there would be no special treatment for btwmemes

I dont like this

Imagine having a dragon defender before you even have the stats to enter the warriors guild
---
I have not and won’t ever.
---
locking hp on obby maulers is big, can range to maul.
---
locking hp on any 50/60 attack build is huge too tbh for edge pk
---
70 attack whip hybrids too.
---
Right, like, whats the point? Limiting it. Like, say, not trading with people..
---
&gt; The problem of relying on a such a rare drop is the fact that drop chances don't really work like that in reality
---
That was the original design philosophy of the game. See GWD, KQ, DKS
---
Clue scrolls also have rare drops with inconsistent profit. Are you going to complain about those, too?
---
Clearly but thanks for pointing it out for everyone else
---
...?
---
How many 5+ year jmods have left in the last 6 months now? Turnover is one thing, but when an exodus of veteran staff leave shortly after one another there's a good shout upper management is rotten.

Up to 350 kc and 10 heads nothing else lmao
---
It seems like theyre trying to create a pking account but dont know how combat levels or game mechanics work. Like they assume 1 level in any combat skill has the same impact on your combat level.
---
&gt; They should have standard drops worth the cost in supplies
---
Why
---
His inventory is perfectly fine. Since he has DHCB he needs to be praying range, which means any defence boosts are useless because he's only getting hit by mage attacks. He also doesn't need brews and restores because he's going to run out of inventory space around 7 kills. You're clearly a noob so here's some advice, don't give advice if you don't know what you're talking about.
---
You've never seen the 1/50m drops commonly posted on Reddit here, have you?
---
You limit yourself by playing f2p. Deal with it.
---
&gt; And what happens when you don't get the drop?
---
Then you're unlucky. What happens if you do 600,000 raids and don't get a drop?
---
They’re not sad. That’s a mustache on his face
---
On a plus note, you have made about 5bil from Vorkath. Hahaha

The ice burst spell on the ancient spell book. It damages multiple enemies in a 3x3 area. Use it whenever monsters are grouped together.
---
You know what bothers me the most about what you just said? Is the fact that jagex listens to and caters to this subreddit 100%
---
,-,
---
If they have really high defence, they'll just get warhammer spec'd and dps gear will still be best. It's a shame because there's clearly a void for certain types of gear that could be great as rewards but they'll likely never be worth using unless they increase damage.
---
Yeah if you're going for those EXACT items, otherwise they are just random rare drops dropped together.

I used the wiki extensively when i came back. Anytime i heard a word I'd never heard before I'd wiki it. That's how i learned about fossil island and great kourend.

Me when I got lucky enough to get my hands on a 3900x 3 weeks after launch and I have yet to do anything more demanding that school work and play runescape.

Glad to hear all that helped and that you're coming along with your account. Also awesome that you managed to skip the D sword for the scimmy! Barb assault has a lot of tutorials but you can just camp the barb assault world (306 I think) for a team and pray they dont leave you on wave 9 (also if you get the 375 honor points for your role before wave 10, its courtesy to stay and finish the game out for obvious reasons)
---
Best of luck to you, man. This game's a hell of a grind but it all pays off... maybe? All I know is its fun for some reason and worth sticking with

---
other people have done the math, feel free to use your computer and do some research on your own. not hard to figure out the kills p/hr and calculate a rough gp/hr when you know the jaw is \~1/800.
---
I guess you should've worn rune gloves then?..
---
The reward is that you don’t need the cinnamon stick anymore.  You can just use the rings without any special items
---
If you don't care about grinds, and just want to have fun, then neither runescape is the game fo you.
---
To be fair, pretty much every other wilderness teleport gives you a warning (even the wilderness ditch warns you) before teleporting you, so I don't see why this one teleport should be different.
---
The defender remains in your invent irrespective of what protects overnight, BELOW 20 wild.
---
What is this brain dead argument? I didn’t say “it’s free so it’s ok” I specifically said it is free AND not against the rules, so theirs no unfair advantage because you have every ability to download the client for free and use it yourself, while still being inside the rules of the game. 
---
Are you saying that you choose not to use runelite, and just want everyone to play the game the same as you? Because there is no unfair advantage when Jagex has said 3rd party clients are ok as long as they don’t have rule breaking plugins, which runelite communicates with Jagex to remove any plugins that Jagex deems OP, and you and anyone else can download it for free. It seems like the only disadvantage you have is your unwillingness to download a program the game devs have said isn’t against their rules. Which again is perfectly fine if that’s how you choose to play, but don’t complain that it is unfair when you have every ability to use it yourself and Jagex has said is ok and to use at your own risk.
---
It was accepted because there was nothing that could be done about it. The jaw isn't a slight upgrade it literally makes it the melee bis from content that is unlocked at 2% of total xp. 60 was to low for the content which is why it was buffed it was never intended to be for low levels.
---
No... If you died at 20 wildy or above you lose the defender, under 20 wildy you keep it in broken form and pay 40k to repair
---
Barrows gloves are still better
---
I want to sincerely apologize. You are absolutely right - I shouldn't get to voice an opinion on what makes for interesting gameplay. The game is based on an old game and should never change. Jagex is infallible, their decisions are immutable, and if they want to vaguely suggest that something might be 'cheating' because they've never thought about creating a workable UI for their own game, we should not question them.  
---
On a serious note, you've also missed the point. I don't care if Jagex implements this in their base client or not - maybe it's more work than they want to do. But they should have a clear, consistent and reasonable policy of what is 'cheating'. My argument is that this is a very stupid thing to call 'cheating' - if it offers significant advantages, it's because the base client is shit. I've not played any other game that treats right-click menus as a core mechanic.

No, they're all going for 99 botting capes. Thankfully that's F2P

When you are using the dragon warhammer or arclight special attack (since it only matters IF you hit, not WHAT you hit) and when you are fighting  a boss that you have to constantly be running away and can't attack often (Zilyana, Tekton)

Sure it is. Not every BiS has to be from pinnacle content. Mage Arena 2 capes, Barrows Gloves, Black Masks. All BiS, none of them hard.

While being bis slot, the helm with the jaw on it also screams mid level and pk item.  It fills the same small niche its direct predecessor did, and other helms while not offering as much str bonus offer so much more for a high level player.  IT IS A MID LEVEL ITEM.
---
The main problem is that i work lol
---
You should be expecting around 15-20ish kills without an SGS if you're just learning and then upward of 20+ kill trips as you get better at the mechanics, depending on your RNG and how often they drop sharks/prayer pots. After an SGS you can pretty consistently get 40+ kill trips
---
I seriously doubt untradables will be traded between accounts.
---
&gt;Skilling isn’t exactly a viable money making method
---
So why should slayer be
---
4 mil an hour usually so its be like a few hundred kills to make your money back. 
---
I'd say it is worth it especially if you plan to make the money back quickly
---
That's fair. Plus you can't use a defender with them.
---
very necessary
---
In addition to how many players are on each side, olm also pays attention to which hand is getting attacked. If there are 2 on the melee side, but neither attacks the melee hand + both attack the mage hand, olm will turn mage.
---
I don't know all the details but you can get all the info you need on Cox from the We Do Raids discord and YouTube.
---
"almost" the jaw drop ALONE is 1.5m/hr @ 50 kills an hour, which is what you can easily achieve in max gear. even closer to 60 kills per hour which makes it \~1.8m/hr JUST the jaw that's even even including the 200-300kish per hour from regular drops.
---
It's not hard to do a little math.
---
I don't know what this is but I love it
---
How many kills do you get per trip?
---
To be fair, in 2007 (that year) runescape died in 2013 which was 6 years later. OSRS is entering its seventh year and is effectively the runescape of 2007 we never had. Thus we’re on borrowed time now, whatever happens from here is simply extra :))

That's why you only attack the gnomes

That's how averages work, buddy
---
The jaw is selling for 24.8m right now, and the accepted number from RuneLite data collection is 1/800 for a jaw drop.
---
800/60 = 13.33hr for a drop
---
24.8m/13.33hr = 1.86m/hr, just from the jaw, before other drops or operating costs.
---
put it in the wilderness for a week, would make for some interesting interactions trying to sell your precious loot
---
Haha seriously, you see them everywhere. I think it’s because they have a sale 11 🦀 stickers for $11.
---
According to the wiki it was accomplished Sept. 6, 2018
---
Jeez, disgusting if true. Thanks for the info!
---
Unfortunately a plenty of people still care a lot.
---
haha wow
---
Correct, how long should it take me optimally? Like 5 mins?
---
Ok but saying “other industries have managed to accomplish this” doesn’t mean anything when it comes to Jagex specifically lol
---
It’s not been easy for him, he started off in Lumbridge
---
Do you have a source that 5 man is the same gp/h as 4? Anecdotally I've found it is slightly less, but also it reduces the individual's chances of MVP.
---
But the tab doesnt
---
1/800 is the on-task drop rate. Even considering that, you'd have to factor in the time it takes to specifically get a Basilisk task (which all things considered is probably slower than outright just camping the Basilisk off task).
---
No conscription would ever happen, we have far too many of us actually in the military already that have been on standby doing nothing, no need for civilians

Jagex is being moved under another shell company. On r/RuneScape there is a post
---
It's a funny meme but not "Add your reddit username over the picture" level of funny meme m8.
---
Brimhaven post 99 &gt; Werewolf pre 99 &gt; Prif
---
&gt; but for my levels, these creatures don't seem to make sense for money or for xp.
---
They're definitely not, but it's all a matter of perspective. A lot of content in this game isn't worth doing for money or XP like Gargoyles, Rune Dragons, Brutal Blacks, Kurasks, etc. But a lot of people like doing them anyways just because they're chill ways to make money. In terms of monsters that don't have any mechanics to deal with (since you can autoretaliate out of their one mechanic) they're actually the best GP/hr mob (long-term at least).
---
And yeah I was talking about 2-3 minute superior kills. The reason why it's good for those to take a long time to kill is because superiors drop 3x the regular drop and have access to a unique drop table too, with a huge XP boost. So as long as you kill the monster in like the time it takes you to kill 4 regular Knights, it's more GP and XP than killing the regular Knight. Superiors should be one of the first unlocks though because they add a noticeable amount of XP/hr and are good for profit.
---
Nice 550k! I only get 20k ones..
---
But how much do you spend on supplies per kill if the fight lasts 2-3 minutes, praying the whole time and eating high end food? 
---
And I mean, making long run assumptions on a drop rate of 1/800 is pretty dumb tbh. Sure you might get it in the first 800 kills, but you also might go dry and not get one in 2000 kills. Considering OP, a fairly mid level player (which the content was supposed to be aimed at), can only kill 5 per trip, that's 160 trips taking hours upon hours of grinding to *maybe* eventually breakeven or get a profit. 
---
Pretty much any mid level money maker would net you more cash and be far more reliable.
---
Wyverns are similar lvl too...
---
I mean its gotta be, why else? How are you gonnna parlay "I did some coding for a web browser game that runs on java from like 1999" into a nicer job? You can't really use the work you're doing there anymore than you could somewhere else, the pay is terrible, and you are constantly bitched at 24/7 by the fanbase.
---
Comment for potential future use
---
The reality is that this is a game with very little financial support. Old school has a fraction on the dev support that rs3 does, along with most other games in existence. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion...but what do you honestly expect to change by posting this? That is my point. We can sit back and think that Jagex's stance on menu entry swapper is shit, and their vanilla client is shit, but that's not going to change the fact that this game doesnt have the support needed to make these core changes. It is a fantasy to think the old school team is capable of a complete client overhaul with the resources currently available to them. The vanilla client is shit, I 100% agree. But again, what do you expect to accomplish with this post? You can think it's a stupid thing to call cheating all you want, but if Jagex says it's cheating, then there is a large percentage of the playerbase that will refrain from doing it, giving those who chose to do it a clear advantage. 
---
Look, don't get me wrong. As I said earlier I would love for them to implement more quality of life into their client. But until they do, we can only ensure a level playing field by refraining from the things they have stated are cheating. Otherwise, where do we draw the line? It's a slippery slope and before you know it we're promoting one-click agility laps under the pretense that agility is poorly designed and miserable and therefore not having to do it ourselves is a quality of life update.
---
Having lower drop rates off-task keeps items scarce, is ideal for the economy
---
I repost this next time,ok?
---
Hey its me ur friend
---
Interesting. I’ll have to try it bc I’m not quite to 75 mage for trident.
---
Wait, who made this meme?
---
This is a good answer
---
Play cs 1.6 its better
---
Ah ok. Couldn't find any pictures of it or mentions of it happening
---
Only whoops is that ive been burying long bones apparently. Thanks again :)
---
This entire discussion is based around being on task. You shouldn't be camping them off task because of the 5x drop rate.
---
I'm in the same boat, same stats. I was going to do this quest soon, but now it's dead content. Now I'll just do the quest when I get to it for quest cape. Or when I have a spare 20m and all the other BiS item slots filled.
---
&gt;If you plan on doing other things as well tho, then yeah get Rigour instead.
---
Also, the current UI is workable. Being tedious does not make it unplayable.
---
Alt your money and pummel gp into smithing, fletching, and cooking is much better.
---
He got the pet on 1 KC on his hard clues
---
&gt;But how much do you spend on supplies per kill if the fight lasts 2-3 minutes, praying the whole time and eating high end food?
---
You pretty much break even on supplies with the normal drops (roughly 4k per kill)
---
&gt;And I mean, making long run assumptions on a drop rate of 1/800 is pretty dumb tbh. Sure you might get it in the first 800 kills, but you also might go dry and not get one in 2000 kills.
---
you might also get 3 in the first 30 kills. 
---
Theres a reason we use statistics, in the long run you will average about 1/800 if you do them enough. For every unlucky player there will be an equally lucky player given the size of the community.
---
&gt;a fairly mid level player (which the content was supposed to be aimed at)
---
Where did they ever say that?
---
&gt;Pretty much any mid level money maker would net you more cash and be far more reliable.
---
not everything has to be for everyone, if people want to do them for the extra cash while slaying let them, its an opt-in task, if you dont want to do them it doesnt hurt you at all.
---
My bank is heading towards 700m right now. Money making transitioned from herb runs/birdhouses to mid level slayer with gargs/kurask and whatever else. Late game is bosses like cerberus, kraken, dks, bandos along with demonic gorilla's. At this point I would say about 50% or more of my money has come from slayer. Another thing to include would be zalcano.
---
I need my dragon grapple, so I can finna get a grapple that doesnt friggen break all the time!

I think part of the issue is that they can't get anything to pass the polls. They don't want to sink resources into something and have everything fail miserably.

everyone suggesting zerker but i dont think that will work. you need to get most of the defence xp from quests since u need barrows gloves. so check the numbers before you decide

Wait, where does gnome,troll,dwarven and demonic cheese come from?
---
Demonic gorillas are brainless content. Sure, you have to pay attention but they’re not hard, especially if you were around back when they were just Tormented Demons.
---
And you can’t really AFK knights anymore post-buff. It’s less attention required than demonic gorillas but it’s still not tank and spank.
---
I mean, if they want to pass things, they need to poll actually good ideas.
---
Seems reasonable, a little too reasonable... Hmm.
---
Burst Dust devils
---
I wouldn't buy a bond with GP. Maybe buy one with cash and redeem it, or just one month of members.
---
That cash will help you a lot more with getting members moneymaking up than it will getting your first members experience.
---
Don't have the real cash? Then totally just do the GP bond. Just my suggestion.
---
Level 99 creativity

Oh ok thank you,

Why no stepping stones to Menaphos? Obviously going to fail a poll..
---
Could you give some examples? 
---
If you live in the uk and have ideas, you can always apply. They recently added several openings.
---
huh? are you on the wrong thread or..? There was no argument about adding a req to collect something. His argument was that the herb sack is useless. And you didn't even say that, you just said "I don't like getting a whip, can we make all monsters easier so my dragon longsword is strong enough?".
---
Your main point was that but you also said "Then what is the point of the herb sack?" which i then told you what it does, and you kept making a comparison, there isn't any comparison between that. 
---
An abyssal whip is better than a dlong but no ones complaining about the req for that which is pretty high to get to if you don't just buy it from the GE. Theres no req for the herb sack (not that i know of). So im going to knock this down before it grows into just a wall vs wall argument.
---
Herbsack isn't useless and OP's claim was that it was. It's only useless to them because they've got a problem with mobs dropping noted herbs. Noted herbs SHOULD be able to go into an herbsack and i thought they already did but i was mistaken, not everyone has access to the 750 points to just toss into an herbsack thats useful for about 2 specific tasks, noted herbs are good for the people that don't have that and don't want to waste putting points into it. **Dumbed down version:** they see it as dead content because they no longer see it is a viable thing. Which just isn't the case. No one starts at base 70's and has automatic access to the herbsack, OP's just stupid for saying that.
---
Now to what YOU'RE comparing; Whip to dlong and their capabilities. Whip has a 70 attack req to use and a pretty price tag on it if you buy it from someone, but if you do it the Ironmeme way then it requires you to have 75 slayer. there is no slayer req for a dlong and you only need 60 attack. You suggesting that they make all monsters easier so you can slay with that instead of a whip is just retarded and you should feel retarded for even making the comparison tbh. I'm honestly kind of baffled at how dumb it feels to argue with you because it feels like im trying to tell all this to a 12 year old who just hit base 60's in combat stats and is just starting runescape.
---
Staff of light / sotd 15% instead of smoke bstaff 10% but I agree mid-late 80s is the break point. Fire wave is better before and swamp is after. Once you have imbued heart then swamp is way ahead.
---
This actually sounds chill to me
---
That's not really how polls work unfortunately. The time between passing a poll and implementation varies wildly. Could be next week, could be a month, could be 6 months.
---
Thank you for making this I appreciate it
---
that didn't actually happen, fyi
---
You can withdraw it anytime. So yes.
---
Lmao. Thank DJ Khaled

You can withdraw the money otherwise it stays their until you use the furnace again

Good look in your infernal grind! /u/hahahasplat guide in WDR is without a doubt the most comprehensive and well written inferno guide out there. Hai painstakingly documented nearly every possible scenario for each wave with solutions. If you don't use it as a dictionary when grinding your first cape you're doing yourself a disservice.
---
Yes, there's no way that knights are "harder" than demonic gorillas though. Demonic gorillas require a lot more attention, and have similar defences (more hp, lower def). It's just a ridiculous comparison to say that knights are harder, for the sake of being outraged.
---
you can always start off as an ironman and change back to normal if you're not feeling it

why does travel time matter when u can stay there forever

Sand snake from kourend quest (depths of despair I think). Count draynor from vampire slayer. Khazard warlord from fight arena. The kendal from mountain daughter. King Roald, can't remember quest. Moss guardian from roving elves if you can, if not then maybe tree spirit from lost city.

The only pvp content that ever passes polls is pvm content. Not really Jagex's fault people want that content.

So why does it have to be more than 750k an hour?
---
It might stay at 30m if no one does them, which wouldn't be the worst thing.
---
It's pretty clear that only cosmetics and items that benefit skillers or inferno capeless PvM'ers pass polling. This suggests that polling is an ineffective catalyst for PvP content, whose principle design aim is to enrich the PvP experience. The problem here is that none of the jmods are pkers. None of the Jmods understand the mode enough to simply bypass their ineffective and outdated polling system and pass good content. You can see their hamster brains working over time trying to revive PvP, but they're too pudding brained to realise that it will never happen under the current systems in place
---
basic pretty good things that were polled failed. Such as being able to have multiple looting bags/multiple rune pouches
---
For Crafting, you should definitely try out gold bracelets. They're very solid exp for lower levels and will profit! Even if you don't have a large starting cash stack, you can buy and craft 100, sell them, buy and craft 150, sell them, buy and craft 300 etc
---
Good talk.
---
To hunt herbiboar you need 80 hunter, I would be willing to bet there are fewer people who boosted to hunt herbiboar, let alone got the pet before being level 80, than most of these things. Hunter is so passive with birdhouses not a ton of people do herbiboar let alone would feel the need to boost.

This sounds pretty good idea. If they leave by themselves, they get nothing.

OP: "over 2 minutes"

thats okay though

Get enough kills and you'll average 1 drop in every 750 kills (or whatever the droprate is). No one thinks they can just go there in 750 kills for a guaranteed drop.

I don't like how every new monster has to have consistent profit. No one thinks they

Ah ok thanks! Didn’t know about the (i).
---
Here's one idea that is probably about 3 years old, which has had zero engagement with from Jagex. An elo system of any kind...
---
I don't understand your argument. Demonics are locked behind MM2 which is a lot tougher than exiles, which probably wouldn't even be considered master level if not for the boss fight. 55 in a skill is less than 200k total XP too. Just because it's RC and we live in a slayerscape good RC bad world doesn't make that a difficult requirement by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Underground Pass would actually be a cool thematic exception to a vegan ironman because your character behaving in an evil manner under the influence of Iban during that quest. The unicorn may be the most brutal thing you do, but you also murder three of Ardougne's paladins in cold blood.
---
Yes actually, some will. You'd be surprised how nice and reasonable people can be when you don't walk in like an entitled brat. If someone asked me for half my sandwich because they were starving i'd most likely say yes. If they walked up and just took a bite out of my sandwich without asking, fuck no i'd be pissed. Why is that so hard for you guys to understand? People didn't give a fuck about group size because they didn't know how much money they were missing out on. Now they do. Hence why they go find their own world for their team instead of joining the mass worlds (like you should, as a guy with no team). You can walk in and do your thing wherever the fuck you want, but you're gonna have a hard life if you don't realize that people will get upset if you doing your thing, interrupts or prevents them doing theirs.

HONESTLY if you made it weigh 30kgs, capped the prayer bonus at 5ish, and didn't allow Tome of Fire / Mage's Book to be put in, it would be like... basically balanced lol
---
Arcane Spirit Shield is basically +20 magic attack, +50 defenses, +3 prayer, and weighs 2kgs.
---
Bookshelf would be +22 Range/Mage, +12 melees, +12 defenses, +5 prayer for 30kg.

We are WAY early into this announcement to know for sure how its all going work yet. They've said only level 3s can join previously established groups, however, so much can change between now and the currently unknown release date. I think we all need to chill a bit and wait for more info....
---
I get your point but maybe group iron just isn’t the place to show off pvm/item achievements. The ability to add new players is probably gonna keep many groups alive longer term.
---
In my opinion being able to add new people to a group is more valuable than not knowing which group Ironmen have achieved actually impressive low level pvm and which groups have done some less than ethical tactics to get those items on a low level. Release day is still far away though so we’ll see what jagex does.
---
So I tried it out using the range setting in customizable normal mode w/ the 5 easiest bosses. I have 65 range, using super range pots, and high def armour (archers helm, obby plate, dragon boots), fury, attractor, and barrows gloves. I don’t have an archers ring, though I assume that would boost the xp a great deal. 
---
I was getting about 25k xp/hr...so not amazing. I bet my xp could get up to around 50 once I’m in the 70s, have an archers ring imbued, and maybe wearing black d’hide. However, I found out that you only need one swamp lizard (it’s reusable unlike chins), so you’re literally only spending 2-3 gp/attack from the tars. I wonder how the gp/xp compares to using a MSB(i) with rune arrows to see if paying more is worth it. Anyone know what the rates look like with 70 range using the shortbow?
---
Why does the Barrows Brothers Chest drop Mind Runes? I understand the higher level runes such as Blood and Death but why Mind?

Can we see the group iron man numbers increase slightly, 5 is a little low for some of us with a big friendship group who all want to play together

Maybe I should have asked differently. To what tab is each f key binded?

*woof*

no other wildy tele tab gives you a warning....

Lmao. You said i lived in a fairy tale world, I most clearly do not as we are having this conversation. In this version of real life you call a fairy tale, I experience what you say never happens pretty frequently and the only reason i can think of that you don't, is that you don't treat people the same way. Didn't mean to say you're never a kind person, I have no clue who you are and could never make that statement, I am sorry if that's how it came out.

Fake. Reddit says that it's literally impossible to kill them anymore.

Hmm. Is there a source for this? I’ve done 1200+ kills and have only seen 3 pet drops lol. 1000+ of those kills were with teams of like 6-15
---
 30 def is still considered pure....

Except the pay being below average isn't anything new, so it doesn't explain why the employee turnover is suddenly skyrocketing.

A bunch of people gathering in a video game to support a far right movement? Damn that’ll show them
---
Wouldn’t that expand the pvp  community? Alts to supply your pvp account, sure there will be a few details that’ll have to be thought out to prevent overpowered situations but increasing the flexibility of ones pvp experience isn’t a bad thing? I hope.
---
For example: barrows gloves having the quest requirement added to them. Sure you might have them but you won’t be able to equip them. Little details like this would surely have a positive affect overall, optimistically thinking.

That’s not what a slayer monster is? That’s like complaining gargoyles are too hard for something to with an 11 prayer requirement. I get the point OP is trying to make but demonics aren’t a slayer monster
---
We have pornhub and nhentai for that
---
It has 4 unique rares ranging from 5m-40m value.. that’s pretty damn good.
---
Curious as to why it took you months? This isn't meant to be condescending just curiosity.
---
Damn, that makes me nostalgic back to when barrows and whip were top tier.
---
You use an ability with dual wield mage (which has 4 tick auto-attack intervals), and then switch to a staff and throw an auto attack and ability at the same time, then switch back to dual wield mage and repeat.

Oh sorry that gp rate is factoring in herbs dying.

Oakdice has been doing it since 2013 and are always posted on these types of threads but just fyi its a trust trade.

I don't understand how the hell you don't understand such an easy concept. It's free. There are multiple news posts from Jagex allowing them. Because it's free, they are available to anyone who wants to use it.

At this point, it seems like you're just a child arguing for the fun of it. You're consistently grasping at straws. It's pretty obvious that you can't come up with any logical response other than telling other people they have nothing. I'm done trying to explain a simple concept.

He was begging 2 weeks ago for a 100m for a twisted bow loan as well... What the fuck is this guy doing. I spent a month in this CC and this guy always seemed to be going above and beyond for the CC. I knew he had to want something for it eventually. Seems it was all to get loans... The guy has like 4k zalcano KC as well.
---
I wish i could give you gold holy shit thanks for making my day

So do I, but man, that was rough since my bank at the time was only about 50m.

They are actually easy dude. Stand a few squares away and it the gorillas actions tell you what it will use next.

what mob is that?

If runelite wasn't free, you'd say it wouldn't be okay then?

I thought it was shown that hand dryers are less hygienic than old fashioned paper towels because they just blow the germs everywhere, whereas paper towels collect them and dump them in the bin? Unless I've just been lied to by Big Paper Towel of course.
---
While you aren’t wrong. I mean take it to the literal sense in that i’m power mining iron or barb fishing. Im not dropping any of the items. If i have to kill 90 fire giants, then all the bones, coins, guam leafs, etc get picked up. Nothing left behind no matter what I do in the game. Not just “oh rune med drop from my 100th black demon” and thats all you picked up. I understand the idea’s lame and at it’s core the basic mechanic of an rng game but I felt it be fun/a small challenge to never leave anything behind or drop anything ever.

too bad the myths guild is useless.

WAHHHHHH WAHHHHHHHHH

I want everything to be like zulrah and vorkath, consistent gp per hour is better than luck based gp per hour

Wahhhhhhhhhh

Make it BIS defense and I vote Yes.
---
This is bad advice. It’s ranged attack is much more accurate and has a higher max hit. If you’re in decent melee gear, you will take the melee hits easily, but the ranged will quickly chip away your health.

Lol nice thieving is one of the fastest 99’s. I’ve stopped worrying about when it’ll end because it did end in 2013, OSRS was somehow just a miracle that happened. Something along the lines of we have a bird in hand, and from a certain perspective nothing can be better than it.

Some hearthstone pro made a remark about the Hong Kong protest in an interview and was banned and had all his earnings stripped. The two casters who let him speak were also fired.

---
We know that clans and group ironman are currently locked behind engine work. Relative to other content, how much dev time do you expect clans and group ironman to take?
---
20 mins, and no response. This feels a lot like when my dad left
---
The extra loot roll can be an extra 200kish if you get rune ore or onyx bolt tips or something. It’s totally variable.
---
Me, circa 2005.
---
This. The ranged attack is actually stronger and more accurate than the melee attack, which is why you pray ranged no matter what.
---
Items not being usable for stakes didn't help either.
---
Drop rate has nothing to do with the rarity of the achievement. You're 100% likely to get 99 slayer untrimmed if you plan your cb xp properly but there's only like 50 (estimate) people in game with untrimmed slayer capes, so untrimmed slayer capes aren't rare because of the statiscal probability of getting one?
---
Just because there's an 100% chance you can do this doesn't mean everyone is going to do it. That's the entire reason why untrimmed slayer capes are rare. And that's especially true in the case of this achievement where you'd have to deliberately go out of your way to hunt herbiboar pre-80, whereas you could theoretically just have happened to balance out your training and use a cannon a lot while going for 99 slayer first-thing and just end up getting 99 slayer first. There's likely not a single person out there mass-training accounts up to 75 hunt, doing herbi perm-potted until 80, and then starting over on a fresh account if they don't get the pet in that window.
---
Wow...
---
No no. The clue was from Skotizo, I killed a saradomin mage for the final step.
---
Shauny implemented some of the most valued QOLs updates in RS3 in recent history. He was behind the buff bar, one of the best interfaces updates ever in my opinion. He wasn't "just a community Jmod", absolutely far from it.
---
When are you fixing pvp
---
People seem to think companies owe complete transparency and think the worst due to social media.
---
Not quite
---
I’m happy to be the one to introduce you to this copy pasta. Hope it brings as much joy to you the next 20 times you see it as it did this time
---
This is actually really sad.  He went to the arena afterwards and proceeded to lose over 1b and got himself cleaned.  That's the mentality...
---
That was actually really cool
---
I thoroughly enjoyed playing claptrap in TPS, if you have the dlc characters for BL2 give hellborn Krieg a shot. It's just as chaotic as claptrap and BL2 is a much better game in my opinion.
---
Why are we not funding this??
---
Just remove staking and let ppl use it for fun
---
oh my god pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Could we do this with other items too? Mainly wilderness locked items such as the dragon pickaxe
---
cheesemaking skill
---
Thank you!
---
Congrats.
---
Who gives a fuck lol it devalues like 2 people's 10 hp ironman
---
“Taking an opportunity where I can progress in my career” - Every jmod when they leave Jamflex
---
You lucky sod, I must be close to 14k there and I'm still yet to get it
---
Could the next BiS Melee upgrade be a piece of equipment intended for PvM that is very powerful but prevents the use of protection prayers while in use?
---
So many freely sold out to them. Blows my mind everyone is so spineless when it comes to some dollar bills but I guess I shouldn't be surprised
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
I haven't done basilisk knights yet as a 123 combat ironmeme, and I have to say all this shit that's happened just makes me not want to go kill them now. Why did they buff them in the first place? Were they too easy or something? 
---
If they were designed as a mid-level enemy why did Jagex put the item that upgrades neitz to the best helm in the game into their loot table? Doesn't make any sense to me at all. Wouldn't it have been much better to create a boss like grotesque guardians or something for the jaw?
---
I'd argue that conventional war would happen almost every time before escalating into a nuclear conflict. As much as nobody wants war, nobody ESPECIALLY wants nuclear war. The first side to launch nukes instantly turns the entire world against them.
---
Despite what some people would have you believe, no nation or government wants to get into another world war. The price would just not be worth it in any way, especially between superpowers.
---
funny
---
can we change our character dick size to be accurate to life
---
Isn’t the point of the desert to be deserted?
---
It's still active fyi
---
Elite diary is harder than ds2
---
reformed into puddles*
---
No point doing it. That's exactly why no one is. If you have an alt at that stage they have far better options in rune drags, gargoyles or brutal Blacks.
---
It's not because people are lazy, it's because people are smart enough to not waste their time doing something not worth doing. Camping basilisks off task is not worth it.. at all. You pretty much lose money unless you're on a maxed main until jaw drop. And that off task seems stupid rare.
---
On task you're sacrificing a bunch of slayer experience for a chance of rare drop. Again, not really worthwhile short term.
---
Make them all req lvl1 cooking, but they need to be unlocked by quests that require high levels of rune crafting and agility
---
People are shitting on it for the wrong reasons, endgame was kinda lacking and it didnt have the best writing but if you truely enjoyed 2 you cant not enjoy TPS, the gameplay is very very similar. And also claptastic voyage is by far the best borderlands dlc imo
---
Bro your own drop log has both food and potions in it...
---
Is this specific knight and that building any better than the other knights or trapping locations?
---
It shouldn’t matter? You should set your own keys with what your comfortable with.
---
Wait.. people actually do spiritual tasks?
---
&gt; Otherwise no one will fucking kill it.
---
Anything that drops a BiS item will always be farmed.
---
Honest question,most people who play ultimate Ironmen I've found either have some sort of mental condition or don't work or anything.  What's up with you?
---
Yeah sure if you already have all of the diary/quest level reqs then of course the other ones arent that hard
---
As in, is the Scythe actually going to be useful at the new boss or whatever
---
At your level your best bet is going to be to train on crabs at fossil island to get combat stats up, then transition into money making. It's really only the higher levels where you can get good exp and money at the same time.
---
Hmmm 🤔 well unfortunately I cant support any suggestion that isn't black background and yellow text..
---
Have you ever had a job? Honest question, because this is not unusual at all.
---
Maybe read what you are buying?
---
Encourages botting.
---
&gt; Also why was Morytania chosen as the region for new updates instead of the desert?
---
Gotta cash in on that Swampletics before everyone moves on to the next big thing.
---
I actually really like this idea.
---
iPads aren’t designed to be mouse compatible. If you wanna play on a pc why don’t you?
---
Yeah, its not a big deal yet very annoying to me..especially when in combat.
---
Not sure what level your prayer is but holy wrench is hardly ever worth bringing anywhere. Look up your prayer level on the wiki page and check https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Holy_wrench
---
It wasn't fine.  
---
If you honestly think that it's alright for an AFK monster to drop one of the best items in the game I don't know what to say.
---
Welp, there goes any hope of me merching any more.
---
Lead engine developer quit 2 weeks ago. There will be no client updates.
---
Remove duel arena and introduce slot machines where you can gamble gp
---
What they could do is nerf range a little and then add some ranged strength armor to raids 3 or something else new. So all old content dosent get even easier with bp and tbow
---
Also nice! d boots can add up quick
---
Usury is a misunderstanding (full of envy and vices)  of renting money contracts.
---
Why do you keep your piss jugs in your room?
---
It rarely uses range when you stand in melee range. I've seen and experienced much better results using protect from melee.
---
Monkey madness requires 69 slayer so there's that
---
Damn I thought it was apple cider vinegar... I’ll check with the doc!
---
give me ur lunch money
---
My worst fear is getting a pet but then dying to a delayed last hit from the boss
---
on the wiki lol
---
I'm curious about the reaction of each Torag helmet after about the 8th one or so lol.
---
The planets name is Gielinor named by guthix himself. Later on runes were discovered and humans nicknamed the world Runescape after them
---
and ppl already police mining lvls, but u wouldn't know since u dont bother joining a cc and attempting to start a group.
---
&gt;no one's talking about herbi
---
Actually thats the whole point
---
good list, but the ordering is pretty damn weird lol

The similarity they seemed to touch on was just about it being a boss in a cave where you can go in with "infinite" people. No instance, no slayer only solo boss, etc. Just a big ass boss you gotta kill. I imagine it will technically be solo'able in a similar way to corp as if it's not instanced it won't reset stats on specs like corp.
---
I don't think he's smart enough to have thought that

Bro, RS3 is having an MTX event to raise awareness for mental illness. We can man up and deal with some overpowered slayer mobs.
---
F2p cow boss
---
No ammy or fire cape he bought gold
---
Do you have any plans on updating the desert in the future?
---
at the moment it seems rather dry (pun intended)
---
Still a chad
---
I really hope they look at partner slayer with these engine features. Because it could be seriously fun with friends without having to wait to have our group irons there.
---
As for your 3rd question, they *definitely* will. I'd see that as being a mode ruiner if you couldn't, as that's the main reason we want it. Iron man makes progress so different and enjoyable, but removes the ability to play with friends except in minigames and raids. This brings that back. And the engine work required to have it doable is why they had to delay this update so long.
---
Sounds like private servers are actually what you want.
---
What about "theeeeeee collection log"
---
"I flipped a coin and got heads 4 times in a row. Ergo, the coin is biased!"
---
The average kill gp is the same. It may seem like bandos is more profitable, but that’s because you can stay there for hours on end.
---
Good job, Just one mistake I noticed with the seers ring and archers ring, but any noob can see what its meant to be.
---
The best thing to do when you get a bond is to make more gp. Until at the end of the two weeks you can buy another bond. Depending on your levels there are many ways to do this. This is just for the beginning, after you get that rhythm down you can do anything.
---
pretty funny hope ur a good hooman
---
When I first saw the image I thought you were dead lmaoo. Anyways, gzz on the pet! I got it at 282kc, but not in that risky situation :P
---
Can't alch hydra heads either :/
---
Well we only know it’s 3x for now, I’m also hoping they make it at least 8-10x more xp. Unless they have a relic that increases xp, but who knows. I think it’s too early to tell. Also...
---
team rargh
---
Grats man!
---
Can i borrow some of your drop-rate luck? Haha i promise i'll give it back after, i just wanna get a D warhammer.
---
Lmfao didn't even notice that
---
They're not in any particular order
---
&gt; What they said.
---
Fun like all the other dead minigames
---
Depends on his much herbi they've done.
---
they already said it would
---
thought this was something from god of war for some reason
---
I removed the apostrophes and (i)s on purpose
---
Sniper take the shot.
---
no it can't. Extra drop is literally capped at mid to low 30k.
---
Oof that's rough my guy :(
---
This would be dead content
---
Could GE buy/sell progress messages be moved to trade instead of game chat?
---
Accuracy matters more and more the deeper end game you get. And with that said most bis upgrades are these kinda small changes. Even lots of the +1 strength upgrades rarely give you a max hit, but adding them up together does make significant changes while potted especially. Accuracy does the same.
---
hessuex69 is a cutie exorcist tho
---
Any Venezuelan beaver cheese perhaps?
---
tangleroot looks weird in this pic
---
It's ironman mode is it not? Or is it just fake ironman where you can't trade with people and there's obviously no GE. Cos I guess ironman mode would cause problems of griefing by doing single bits of damage.
---
You trying to quit heroin or do you just like kratom
---
Turn up the heater and melt the snowflakes (/s)
---
Thanks!
---
Very much agree. But skyrim could not have been prettier.
---
There's literally 0 risk for people who never step foot into the wild which then creates this negative rep for the wilderness because once an entitled pvmer who never loses items dying to goblins and chickens all day gets pked, he loses his stuff and goes bat shit crazy on the polls and spewing hate towards pkers. Safe death mechanic is what tore apart the pk / pvm community into two separate player groups which is stupid.
---
He's almost always set up on 2k worlds but still flickers if you get a few people on him.  Entity hider is your best friend here. At least on 2k worlds it's rare to encounter people who despawn him
---
I'm sure it is possible. I hope if it's ever polled / desired it should be a toggle..because personally I don't want anything to do with that. But if it's client side and just for you and you can toggle it on, sounds good (and would benefit mobile pretty well)
---
ik, but 
---
&gt;Fire cape or infernal cape
---
there's a bit of a gap between those two things lol
---
also seeing base 70 stats/pet/diaries and slayer helm/torso/ddef on the same list is kinda disorienting
---
Skyrim was beautiful no doubt
---
Worth a permaban.
---
I dont understand why it bothers people that a group of 4 got together and created a group in a world that isnt 378, 377, 375, 302-305. You can literally go to any of those worlds if u wanna group up in masses and leave the people who want to grind zalcano alone
