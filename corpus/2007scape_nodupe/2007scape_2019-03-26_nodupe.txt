Is any skill as afk and profitable as Fletching? I find it so easy to just buy 10k yew logs and bow strings and just fletch a load when I'm watching tv. Then either alch or sell them. Makes a couple mil, is very afk and fairly good xp. I guess fishing? I'm only 62 fishing and not made any good profit on it yet. Banking makes it way less afk

If you look at what they're doing the accounts are technically different. If you look at their purpose theyre the exact same. Torvesta had his account making money to feed his main. Clans had their crafter there to make gear/money to feed its members. Its too arbitrary to say "Oh hey this guy didn't train any skills therefore hes a mule" because then people can train to (for example) base 30s combat stats to get by it.
---
I'm not saying torvesta is not using that account as a bank as well as a moneymaker, but if jagex's rules do not allow that, then clan skilling accounts shouldnt be allowed either.

Torvesta is one of the reasons I still watch RS videos ... smh jagex you never cease to disappoint

Untrue, as a streamer is in a position to influence other people through their own actions.
---
Mate they literally did this (but with the GE as well). Swapping and feeding was still running rampant and all it did was kill the game mode for actual players. DMM is a pking game mode, not a skilling game mode.

The GE is the critical difference maker, though. You can't just say "it was like ironman but with the GE". 
---
Well for starters rot getting feed information about safe zones for dmm and getting ip info so they could ddos opponents. I know that doesnt offer proof but look at Jed getting fired for giving away account info and combine that with the past evidence of him helping rot in dmm doing what I said and it is pretty cut and dry

Hes been doing this and recording it for the past 4+ DMM tournies lol. This is just Jagex arbitrarily banning him for no reason, stop making excuses for them. It's not like he was trying to "hide" the fact that he used this account, he's literally done it forever. The fact that they randomly decided to ban him now, without warning, is complete and utter bullshit. But I mean it's Jagex, that's to be expected.

The only issue with WoW pvp is how much you need to know to understand what’s really going on for the most part, and WoW is finally starting to hit a wall in its popularity. Even WoW pvp in its current state is 100x better than rs pvp though, at least Blizzard doesn’t straight ignore it and not fix major issues, some of the updates and patches may not be well received at times but WoW pvp was INSANELY popular back in the prime days, the only issue us streaming didn’t exist like it does now nor did the same esport market. If it did though, wow pvp would have been massive. I without a doubt had far more fun pvping on WoW during its 6-8 year hayday than RS, RS PVP is just far too neglected and broken in many ways to EVER be anything that Jagex claims they want for it. There’s plenty of times when a player with better gear and better stats is attacking someone in considerably worse gear and considerably worse skill(sometimes just doing nothing right) and yet that person isn’t punished for it and lives and the better pvper is just splashing or hitting 0s/low and that just isn’t acceptable in the least bit if they want to be serious about Pvp becoming something in this game, and of course that just scratches the surface of the issues in PvP and just general lack of attention/updates/fixes to gameplay. They’ve been handing out this lip service about PvP about how they’re listening and want it to flourish etc FOR YEARS now, not going to believe them nor or ever until they actually show a tad bit of competency. Pretty sad since, with fixes and an overhaul in some aspects and a new enticing way to PvP would make it really blow up again kind of like how it was back in the day, but I won’t hold my breath.
---
Dude he worked hard for that bronze.. thats a weeks wages irl for him!
---
Both of those have been handled with Jed getting fired. They clearly didn't ignore it.
---
Unfortunately you're wrong. Couldn't give a shit about the tournament. What I do give a shit about though is this place of discussion being turned into a place for you to spam retarded nonsense and drive some sort of personal agenda. Instead of spamming shit, email a jmod asking them to fix whatever the fuck asinine bullshit you're trying to push. Please don't be a sheep. Think for yourself and stop following the herd.
---
He ain’t even do shit tho
---
God yes, this is the way.
---
Vorkath is just great for all around skilling drops. Lots of crafting and prayer xp in bones/hides, it drops addy ores, dragon bolts/darts/arrows which can be hard to get a sizable amount. The ward and dfs are just a bonus in my eyes. 
---
Personally i melee him, ive preferred that over blowpipe even before I upgraded to a dragon hunter lance. Never felt that dumping that many scales was worth it. 
---
Even if you don’t camp him, getting the assembler is a huge upgrade. Its better accuracy and damage over the accumulator and it never drops ammunition to the ground. Its 80% reused and 20% destroyed instead of 72# reused, 8% on the ground, and 20% destroyed. Its absolutely worth doing the 50 kills (or less if you’re lucky)then coming back later when you’re better geared
---
It's as ironman as a PvP game mode can get. It's literally referred to as the ironman season of DMM. You can make a pvp gamemode with ironman restrictions when you cna kill others for their loot. Just doesn't work.
---

---
Yes they do make more monsters the more players you have, it's fucking hectic with a full team.
---
No, nobody really plays it as there's no point. I think maybe some very niche scenarios when you'd want to (think like points boosting if everyone stands in the middle and pro-melee while another guy barrages or chin's). There's just no real benefit to playing full team.
---
Why not? 
---
 No plz no
---
Assuming he plays the game outside of just RC'ing nats (since he just wanted to do RC to "sustain" his account), Graceful is 100% worth it. It will reduce the weight in all other aspects of the game, and help out in almost every skill in the game.

Duradel
---
But how many dmm tournaments did they get away with it before they did something? And they also did nothing for all the dmm tournaments they finally did it once he was hacking accounts to rwt
---
I agree the jmod should be held responsible, it was probably negligent for him to tell Torvesta what he was doing wasn't bannable. Regardless imo playing two accounts in dmm is pretty iffy anyways, it's certainly an unfair advantage for a true solo player. 
---
He's probably using super combats
---
I qualified 2-4 accounts every DMM Seasonal I played in. I was nowhere near competitive either - I just felt like it was the only way I could even participate, lol.

I would say 2-300 could be pretty accurate.

Because there was little conclusive evidence that it was actually him leaking stuff like IPs and final locations. Even now there still really isn't, it's mostly circumstantial. It's pretty convincing, sure, but not enough to ban the clan over.

Thanks a bunch!! Appreciate it.
---
Wait a second. Let me get this right.
---
You think that it is perfectly valid for that account to play in complete safety and let tens to hundreds of other people mule resources on it as no problem, effectively giving the entire clan the benefit of a perfectly safe permanent mule, because it is one person benefiting a clan and providing some crafting services.
---
However, if any single random person thinks 'hey, it might be nice to do the same thing so I can keep up with the clans,' then it's a grievous game-breaking offense?
---
I get what you're saying about what he is doing being muling with extra steps. But, you can't just say it's not fine for one person to do it, but fine for a clan to do it. If you're going to ban a player for doing it, ban clans for doing it too. And, I'm 100% sure that Jagex could track clan muling too if they really cared enough.
---
There is really no 'gray area' or discretion needed.

Just that you had adequate supplies to see you through. It’s unlucky you fell so close with ultimately time to spare.

Just lost my untrimed hp cape on my hcim because I didn’t know weapons saved atk style. I got to 100 Xp left and was finishing the slayer task, then I dds’d an ankou and got 99 str. Pretty devastating honestly, I know it’s not rly an accomplishment to get untrim hp but it sucks to just lose it for something that wasn’t really my fault other than not playing for a few weeks and I know there’s no way I’m getting it back and it especially hurts right now when ppl are getting xp adjusted after the pure mess up and stuff. Idk I’m done ranting

Problem is, DMM is going down the “e-sport” side of things and I find there’s little more unwatchable in runescape than clans. Plus, clans add to the lack of accessibility of DMM and issues with player base continually pop up. No idea how you fix any of that though because as you said, it’s an MMORPG. 
---
How many tries did it take you?   I think I'm fairly skilled but I've never done anything as close to as hard as the inferno.  I always told myself I'd start once I got a tbow but I'll look into doing it without one.  I should be able to buy the rest of the gear.

May be an unpopular opinion but if you don't want clans then remove trading and marginally increase droprates for desirable items.

 I don't see a clear cut way for fixing clans locking down areas, but I would love to hear suggestions however (I'm sure Jagex would too since all of their ideas come from Reddit). 
---
In the end, pick a side Jagex. Either embrace that clans are a thing and build a tournament where they're official and you don't end up saying "oh I think this guy is in Fools, wait no he's in Lit, now we're getting reports he's solo!" Or make clanning an impossible or inviable option.

---
I've always thought the evidence of RoT was damning but coming from the perspective of Jagex, they need pretty strong evidence to ban or disqualify people of stuff like that. No matter the clan, whether it was RoT or not, Jagex has never banned anyone for circumstantial evidence of DDoSing no matter how strong that evidence was. They only banned FL members of it when they admitted to it in writing. 
---
As much as it would totally seem like a RoT exclusive thing with Jed involved, it's just how they treat the matter of DDoSing.
---
Serious question:
---
With all these decompiled versions of runescape (private servers and such), how much work would it be to make a program that constructs this in Minecraft automatically. The tiled, low poly design of this game matches Minecraft in a lot of ways. Probably a dumb question but crazier things have been made..

There are a lot of reasons, the most honest answer is people that buy gold are likely "normal" players, that play RuneScape without bots, and engage in the game in meaningful ways. They buy gold to engage with the game *even more*. Gold sellers often use fake credit cards, and other illegal acts tied to real world crimes. They are a real financial drain on Jagex. Their goal is to play the game less, to sell more gold, and to engage in the real world with real money. A buyer could possibly be educated and play the game without illicit gold buying. A seller will always be motivated to sell, because the reason they sell exists outside of the game (real world money).

You've failed to provide motive of a third party.

My guess on the two biggest reasons is that new people get to see what's it's like to play RuneScape and not just see the fights. The second is because once people figure out the optimal setups everyone will have the same gear and strategy not making it fun to watch as it's mostly rng.

I'd be all for that, although I would imagine prize money availability would indeed be limited, and may be a substantial motivator for player involvement currently for DMM, as there's currently $32,000 in prize money for this tournament alone.
---
According to him, he straight up asked if it was against the rules, and the jmods told him that because he was actively using the account and it wasn't just sitting there to protect items, it wasn't muling and he wouldn't be banned for it
---
Hey how much per hour are you making from PP? Im a newer ironman as well
---
fun
---
Meet Swampletics!
---
Yeah, only about 70,000.
---
The world does not revolve around you kiddo.
---
Nice

Ironman mode has really shifted this communities attitude towards playing a far more isolated style of gameplay. Which is fine - but people should be more receptive to other, more niche and alternative styles of play (like group minigames, and indeed, clanmanmode) imo
---
Yes, they are. Was added a few weeks ago.
---
Clans are the only reason I don’t play dmm. I admit Jagex has made some great changes but they still cant stop clans.
---
Not going to pretend to know how I would go about it either, I just hope they can find something.
---
Just out of curiosity, what is the benefit to a Farming Guild Spirit tree? Is that just if you don't have a jewellery box in the POH or am I missing something else?
---
We have had other players admit to having "ge alts" and the community asked for their bans. So yes this is double standard.

i like goblin diplomacy
---
If he was training with the account and bringing it outside of the safe zone, then no it would not have been considered muling. But if the account just sat at the ge the entire time, which is how he operated it, that is muling.
---
I dont think that the whip and d def is true. I checked on the dps calculator spreadsheet and changing my current gear for full obby with necklace AND sword would be better dps...
---
please clip 
---
Jagex hasn’t fixed any of the problems with their game, but yeah it’s definitely because of memes. Memes are the problem here. 
---
Torvesta muled super hard this season, got banned, and everyone is mad at Jagex for selective rule enforcement (banning a solo player while teams safely feed leaders).
---
The question I answered was " ..So is Jagex powerless against a PvP clan, or not?"
---
While they are not literally crippled and unable to take any action against a clan of gamers, they did get tricked for over a year and had the results of almost every DMM tournament in that time frame pre-determined. They had many players banned and hacked for over $900k irl value with no legal recourse due to the nature of their defense that gold has no in-game value.  While they eventually fired Jed, he and his clan definitely won the war due to lack of recourse and the timespan of the abuse.
---
Why do lumbridge when you could just tag on edgeville and Barb village
---
torvesta fucks. FTFY
---
You literally said word for word, a solo player cant be 'competitively viable' the fuck are you on about lmao
---
That's a lot of assumptions about Jagex's competency
---
wow amazing man love the 11$ crab in the back
---
What about playing solo, but not expecting victory?
---
This makes teamwork a necessary factor to victory, but not a necessary factor to playing?
---
I'm mostly just curious about people's opinions.
---
Free Torvesta!!!!!
---
Yes...the "torvesta" account he is claiming that he "plays on" has no stats at all compared to the alt he used last season which actually had stats. 
---
Muling. He used a level 3 account with no stats that never left the ge to hold his excess gold so that he wouldn't be risking it. 
---
The problem here is that he was punished for doing something that a Jmod told him was allowed.  
---
I understand why muleing is a rule but the logistics of ever actually policing that rule just makes it so ridiculous. I guarantee you 15-25% of players participating in the tournament are doing the exact same thing, and they will never get disqualified. It's not like they "caught" him in the act. He was pretty open about what and why he was doing it. It's frustrating at the thought that he didn't get disqualified because the "system" was working but rather some J Mod seeing his video, congrats you took out literally the only reason I watch these tourneys. 
---
super antifires/ward should take care of the pink pray disabler and red dragonfire. pray range covers spiky ball. antivenom+ covers the green. only thing that should hit you is mage. 
---
the random hitsplats are probably the ruby e bolts? do you know how their spec works? when it goes off, you lose 10% of your current hp.
---
He said he was spending time with his family and on studies. He used agility as a break from other skills. And his alt has about 150m rc xp or so.
---
Oh never heard of that but I don’t pay attention to tourneys much. Thanks!
---
LOL those are awesome, thanks for sharing
---
He literally was muling. He transferred wealth onto an alt.
---
Fair enough. You do you. 
---
No one is gonna see your side of it however, so you have to determine how much effort you want to waste attempting to change the opinion of those who are morally opposed to your viewpoint. 
---
Like there has to be a limit where you realize you aren’t going to change their minds and it’s not worth your time and effort anymore when you could instead be having a constructive discussion with people who might eventually come to agree with your viewpoint. 
---
even the GE wow i know almost every building in this city more than my own home city.
---
It was a GE alt that a mod said he could use in previous tournament.
---
This is what bugs me the most about the situation. If you wanna ban people for mulling fine, but how many people are gonna go unnoticed because they don't make videos for the communities benefit?
---
Are these numbers, the 1 account to 4 alt ratio common? And if so, what are the roles of the alt accounts within DMM? Seems like a lot of work and effort to get this many people cooperatively working together to dominate the game.
---
Sounds pretty interesting too, even if "impossible" to compete against is a reality.
---
I don’t even play the game anymore, I only ever watch him play and now that he is automatically out, I won’t be watching the stream since he was the only reason I tuned in. I love his creativity and his determination. I’ll just go back to just following his channel. Fuck Jagex 
---
The issue is that a Jmod told him that what he was doing was allowed.  
---

IMO like 40 or 50, the threshold is kinda arbitrary though. rigour will barely make your kills any faster but you'll notice that specs matter way less.

Oh no, I'm not denying the fact that this is a protest. I find it hilarious that you actually think crab emojis and spamming Reddit is an effective way to protest. Cancel your membership and quit the game if you're genuinely that upset.
---
Lmao anyone who thought runescape would ever be some kind of esport are very delusional. While osrs pvp is kinda unique its also not very esports friendly. Lack of varity in strats, relies heavily on rng and the way pid works just puts the fight immediately in a 55/45. Probably more issues too, pk isnt my thing but i will admit it can be fun to watch high lvl 1v1s, shit like edge pk and pvp worlds is boring as hell though and is just about launching combos and timing vengs.
---
Anyways, osrs pvp was never designed for a competitive scene, but it can be fun to watch.

Can some reverants monsters be added outside the wilderness, they wouldn't have all the expensive drops like the wilderness ones just a place for ironmen to farm up either and/or get a bracelet?

Release was chaos. I eventually stopped trying to kill them and just focused on looting the dead. I remember getting a lot of Barrows peices lol.

It's crazy. Hes over 70k views in 5hrs. His other DMM videos have over 200k views from this season. It's absolutely wrong bc in previous seasons JMods have allowed it. And you know they wont ban any clans doing the same thing.
---
3 hours well spent! I like it!

This is awesome.

Would love to know more about the process from start to finish.

More proof osrs is just a money gran for the real game before they shut down the osrs offshoot game.

Can you explain this? Been sick for a week and I feel like I missed a L O T.

Maybe I’ll record one of my RuneScape logos sometime 
---
GE alt is code for mule. If the ge alt had been making all of the money on its own that is one thing. But transferring your wealth from your main account onto an account with 0 risk is the definition of muling, regardless of what you call it. This story of a mod saying it is fine was probably grossly misunderstood.
---
How? They clearly don't have the resources to stop an issue that LITERALLY MULTIPLIES itself. You can't stop a bot farm unless you find the guy that does it, who could be countries away.
---
The argument is fine, like I said this is an issue thats as old as the internet. How do you ban someone with the ability to change his own ip, and continuously create bots? How do you ban SEVERAL people with this ability? All you're saying is "No resources = bots rule". What I'm saying is it doesn't matter if they had enough resources, bots will always be an issue because there is always a way to create more even if they're caught. The bot developers can improve just as well as the Jmods can, even if they temporarily find an edge against the bots.
---
Same thing for other websites, software and games, they do their best. But at the most they can only slow down their progress. Any success is only temporary until the next patch.
---
Somewhere between 40-60 imo

---
Lmao thanks, 3&amp;4 are the best
---
Then some of those methods may be a bit a ways away. Mid level crafting sucks a lot but once you’re established and doing more end game content you really do just get it passively. My suggestion would be to get like 87 from mostly sand, not as bad now with the sandstone update, then let it be more of a passive skill.
---
87 for the anguish is a big upgrade over other amulets. Tormented is nice but not necessary everywhere you’re maging and the torture is another nice upgrade but not necessary.
---
Not the same at all. One has addy (t), and the other has SOS boots.
---
Wasn’t aware, saw everything you had was max (armadyl, sang over trident, tbow) except for avernic. Saw your comment about saving for a scythe so yup don’t get an avernic if you’re close to a scythe.
---
Any evidence of this?

Ah, civil adults tend to discuss things on Reddit in a free torvesta meme post? In that case I'm very sorry for not being more mature here in this sanctuary of adulthood.  
---
 I gave him my opinion on the matter, sorry y'all don't like it! Why would i be at all invested in someones opinion whom i will literally never see or meet and will most likely never exchange another word with again? If not caring about his opinion makes me cool then i guess I'm fucking awesome, thanks for the compliment.  
---
Your meme game is weak. It doesn’t make any sense. You’re only getting upvotes because “Torvesta” and “dmm” are in the meme.
---
I wouldnt say it's fair. Think about it. He says he transfers cash from main to merchant/buy stuff on alt. If he died on his main at this time, he would not be losing any of that wealth. Aka. Definition of muling.
---
How is that fair compared to someone who does not have 2 accounts qualified?

Ha, that's it. I was too stoked for the 500xp drop and 100 damage to notice I was taking damage. Half a shark for 100 damage is a fair deal
---
The funny thing is jagex banned the biggest content creator on osrs, meanwhile plenty of other players do exactly the same with no consequence. Jagex, stop acting like a stupid basement company. If you didnt want this to be allowed, and everyone does it, wouldn't it maybe be a great idea to come with an official statement on specificly what is allowed and not as this is a grey area. Also, if youre gonna ban someone for this, you have to ban everyone.
---
Its really hard to take jagex and the people who work there serious when they do shit like this. Like do you guys even talk together and discuss things or do you all just work individually and everyone does their own thing? Get your shit together
---
The tournament needs to be Ironman.  Seems crazy that it isn’t.  But I’m new.
---
Yes essentially a mule and alt funtion the same in early levels however, his plan was to use the alt to do wildly slayer for the weapons while the main does barrows for the armor. Does jagex want solo players to not sleep for the week? How are you ment to get end game gear when it's rng based. 
---
I won't lie, you seem pretty sincere and this'll probably get buried but I love when shit like this happens. A lot of people show up expecting some kind of redemption and it's pretty fun making people realise how wasted and futile their efforts are. Don't worry man I'm not offended or anything, I've been on the internet for a while and you kinda get a second sense on how to rile people up 😉
---
Profitable alchs, Gratz man!
---
In your opinion is this better for the player base and games health? Creating defined rules for DMMT to allow solo players a fair chance or continuing this trend of letting clans run these tournaments through locking down areas, possible muling, etc. 
---
Ofc the clans will always have an advantage, its just that the advantage is way too large and needs to be adjusted.
---
This is bloody quality right 'ere
---
And on the third day, Torvesta was banished from the DMM tournament. But he did not fear, for he knew he would be saved by the grace of Settled. Praise be
---

Hi everyone, so I’m still relatively new, my account is only two months old and I’m at about 6-7 mil xp total. I only have one other friend that plays, he get me into it and we can rarely play together because of time zones.
---
So is there a way to join a clan or a group of like people because I remember someone saying that you have to get invited into one
---
🦀🦀 **$11.99???** 🦀🦀
---
That's a very good suggestion! Thank you for it. I was planning on stopping at 85 since that's the fury and I'm almost there. But that is a very big upgrade for ranged.
---
I will probably finish to 87 doing mostly passive from slayer and then manually silver.
---
I do use lunars to superheat in mosleharess sometimes. But only when I'm feeling ambitious lol.
---
I exaggerated a bit but the end result is the same since it’s like 150 people with 2-3 accounts per person not including scouts/ge flip/mule accounts. Most of the alts do range and kill arma/kbd, farm barrows, farm pvp weapons, etc. The biggest issue is they send 30 alts to camp quest areas and block them because even when another clan kills them they just lose ragging gear and send those accounts somewhere else to camp.
---
Look like it’s settled then

Getting base 70 combat stats soon so not quite there for most higher level bosses and raids, but I do plan to do raid and tob with people i just feel like trying to get boss kills alone by myself at least the first time then I'd look into doing it with people haha
---
No one cares
---
Ban well over half the tournament then, it should be fair. If you’re going to ban one person for using alts to give himself a chance, ban the clans that make up 80% of the tournament that are doing the EXACT same things.
---
No
---
Absolutely incredible my man, I hope to see more from you in the future :) glad you worked out the white tree as well :)

As he stated in his latest vid, he already asked a jmod last tourney and the method was approved from the jmod.

How do u do this?

Hey, Peter Griffin from the TV show family guy here! I'm here to explain this trendy yet confusing joke people use in these parts of the internet! See it all started with a catchy music video called crab rave released by noisestorm, some users of this subreddit made a video with a thumbnail and title acting as bait where upon clicking it, the video would reveal the dancing iconic RuneScape "Bob" with various sentences and text incriminating the creators of this video game based upon their mistakes and bad decisions, thus giving it the comedic effect. Now this has become a staple meme of this community which has been slowly spreading to others so these crab emoticons are actually meant to represent said meme.
---
I hope you learnt something new today and have a wonderful day!

Minimum wage is around $6.50 a month there, so a boss bringing you in 500k an hour isn’t looking bad. That’s 20m a week at 40 hours. On the ultra cheap side that’s $6.50 at least 
---
:(
---
When that happens to me I just change the brightness setting and it fixes it.
---
Only happens when I switch back from YouTube or texting.

Zulrah and Vorkath have nothing to do with mining and you're essentially denouncing the entire mining skill as being "less efficient" with this post.
---
Friend and I started accounts about 2 months ago and I was wondering how long it takes people to get to a level where they can boss (let's use gwd as a standard). I'm sure the time varies all over the place, but if anyone has a general idea that would be great. 
---
I see videos of people having multiple accounts that are such high levels but I don't know if I'm doing things inefficiently or they're just crazy good.
---
On a side note, I've been doing quests instead of skilling since I figure I will have to do them all at some point anyway, 150qp as of today. Been training combat skills basically exclusively through slayer except for recently doing nmz to start getting points for imbued items. Is this a good action plan for me to be following?

So he says. I'm not saying i don't trust/believe Torv but you can't just take everyone at their word 100%. Jmod may have misunderstood what he meant etc. maybe the Jmod thought, with the way Torv explained it, that he would be playing the second account normally as well. Not just camp it at the GE. Maybe that Jmod was someone with absolutely nothing to do with DMM rules and shouldn't have said anything etc. Either way muling is against the rules and its exactly what Torv did

You can bump out 7 qp in like an hour honestly, even as F2P. Romeo and Juliet is already 5 isn’t it?

There will be tons of progress once the server is up and running!
---
Definitely. You can pull nearly 2m/hr if you're good at timing rocks. Then, say you're mining rune, you're likely to get 2/3 more ore per rock which gives you a 22k/33k bonus every time. It makes a big difference, up to 120k or so an hour.
---
Agreeeeed, I'm ready for downvotes too
---
Who told him it was ok? Pretty sure alt accounts have been illegal. I could totally be wrong.
---
90 base stats would be good. I’ve done 135 medium clue scrolls this past weekend in hopes of getting ranger boots. Set a wealth goal, maybe complete all the skilling outfits (graceful, prospector, rouge)

&gt; Lack of varity in strats
---
They've already added Ancient Warriors gear to DMM, they could just add new, unpolled gear with special specs to any PvP format and only in that format
---
&gt;relies heavily on rng
---
Can be mitigated with new gear, maybe gear with low stats but gives +HP when equipped, but takes away that HP when unequipped.
---
&gt; the way pid works just puts the fight immediately in a 55/45
---
Could potentially add gear with specs or effects that favor a "going second" strat in pid, like maybe a Veng effect on a spec?
---
DMM in general is shit IMO, too many people manage, too many benefits to cheating, and encourages literally unhealthy play habits because of how much you have to no-life towards the end.
---
Lets say they do unban him, isn’t his tourny ruined since hes wasted this much time? Sorry if this is a dumb question but Im new to DMM.

---
Sorry for not including any pictures, but he was using melee void at mid 80s melee. I believe ovls would dramatically increase his xp/h and "afkness" in that setup since he would likely require less absorption potions if relying on the rolls against his defence level while dishing out more damage.
---
&gt; Many people don't ovl or pot at allMany people don't ovl or pot at all   
---
I personally know no people that do not use overloads at NMZ.
---
&gt; You saying it's a mistake in another comment shows you thinking you're superior to him even though he knew what he was doing.
---
I never said not using pots/ovls is a mistake. The mistake I was referring to was about the correct usage of the rock cake when using overloads. It's either right or wrong, there is no judgement involved.
---
If you don't mind me asking: why do you believe that pointing out mistakes conveys a sense of superiority? 
---
Unpopular opinion: He DID break the rules of the tournament and his punishment is just. I’m a HUGE Torvesta fan. He’s the first Oldschool YouTuber I’ve watched. 
---
I realize other popular clans abuse the rules and suffer no consequences. However that’s like saying “Officer yes I was speeding which is against the law, but others were speeding too”. Unfortunately you’re the unlucky one they pick out of the crowd. 
---
I really hope they re-vamp a “new” DMM for solo players. Torv. Will soar to the top of the charts more so than he has in the past. 
---
You missed the whole point of his video. He just wants consistency.
---

Not watching without torvesta. That’s stupid af. Cancel dmm it’s over. 
---
I enjoyed watching torvestas DMM content. In a tournament riddled with shitty clans, (that cheat, hack and ruin the servers) it was a breath of fresh air to see him go down solo to caves, doors, house, etc. This truly is shitty on jagex's part, and I'll do my part to cancel my subscription to the game until he is reinstated. 
---
think it asks you to turn it in, not give to him. fallo the bard is the dude who wants to see items.
---
Says fucking who? The point of DMM from a business perspective is not to be "An uber fun gamemode for hardcore RS players!!" The point of DMM, from Jagex' POV is to develop as a legitimate eSport in order to draw in a new playerbase and viewership, and ultimately result in profit for them.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
If they want DMM to be a team gamemode, like League or something, then they need to design it as such. If not, and they instead want to stoke the solo playerbase (which would ultimately be the better choice, and result in a stronger playerbase) then they need to design it as such. This halfway point that they're stuck at is retarded. And so are you.

Also how do you melee vork?

Not to be "That guy", but the Jmod is in the clear. Torvesta waited too late to get the alt to join. (5 days before the tournament ends, March 30th.)

&gt; **Muling, which can be defined as:** using a separate account to store wealth. This includes clan banks. **Alternate accounts are permitted provided they are used competitively.** Players found to be muling will be banned (including clan banks, and those who use them). 
---
When did the tournament start? Because he had all that time to get his alt somewhat involved competitively in the tournament. And he got banned 5 days before. Otherwise, Torvesta basically admitted in his video that he used that alt to hold his main's wealth (to buy shit at the ge, understandable) so that he could train on his main and catch up with the clans. So thats technically muling, especially if he dies and the pker doesn't get his FULL bank.   
---
How competitive was his alt this tournament? Did it bankstand in the safezone for weeks on end? If so, understandable.
---
How does Jagex win against clans? Serious question. Everyone complains about this, but no one has an answer without flaws.

Dude, Tyson Glory was his DMMT main. He was muling on Torvesta, which did not leave the GE

&gt;Deadman Mode is a unique and punishing game mode for Old School RuneScape. With an emphasis on survival in an unforgiving player-vs-player environment, it's the ultimate in competitive gaming for Old School RuneScape. What differentiates Deadman Mode from ordinary Old School RuneScape is the raft of changes to content designed to make it as brutal and fiercely-contested as possible.
---
Straight from their website. It's meant to be the most brutal, unforgiving, hardcore experience of RS possible.
---
Where it draws in new players via the exposure it generates from viewership. Do you really expect new players to jump right into deadman?
---
Jagex have been pretty clear about muling in the past. 
---
Lmfao 10/10
---
He was still using the account as a mule. That's just dodging the rules..or trying to. Break the rules get banned. 
---
Yeah man, it’s only his first language. 
---
Lmao they absolutely are. A clan will camp demonics, get a bunch of zenyte shards, then pass them to the clan alt to make tortures. Now, nobody else can get tortures except one clan. 
---
But ok, if you just want to see one clan win over and over again that's up to you. You'll be the only one. 
---

&gt;**Muling, which can be defined as:** using a separate account to store wealth. This includes clan banks. **Alternate accounts are permitted provided they are used competitively.** Players found to be muling will be banned (including clan banks, and those who use them).
---
The alt was banned today on the 25th, 5 days before the final. Torvesta might've spent too long bankstanding.
---
I feel like a pleb but what is mulling?

Awesome, thank you! And I love that it also have articles for the Deadman tournament, I've been trying to find out how the streams and such are done so I can watch! Thanks for sharing this!

For reals though, why isn't my boy /u/Zuuhar onto this?
---
It is competitive. Whether or not it's an "esport" is semantics.
---
Clan man mode is stupid and needs to be fixed, but muling is unfair too. What’s the difference between a clan of 5 working together, or me, and my 4 alts flipping, making $$, and getting gear. I’m disappointed for Torvesta as I love watching his DMM stuff, but I’m glad Jagex is trying to make DMM better. Get rid of Mules, then next clans and DMM will actually be 10/10. 
---
I was on my phone the entire time to get it tile for tile. It’s not exactly 1:1 due to complications with walls but it’s close enough 
---
Coming from the worst PKer on Earth, I think PvP in RS is really interesting and different from every other game. It’s when the J-mods fuck it up that make it bad.

ALSO, bear in mind that Torvesta is a vocal minority. One person. No clan or individual person is going to brag about their accounts/half their squad being banned for muling.
---
The last 3 deadman winners have been, if I recall correctly, fools once, blazers once, and FL once. Not the same clan each time.

People only downvoting your comment because they fucking LOVE how Torvesta’s cock tastes

Its literally just rock paper scissors with more clicks, if you can use a mouse and you have about 30 hours of free time you too can become a top tier pker!

Now try practicing any other real competitive game for 30 hours and competing with best in the world, not gonna happen.
---
Just here to drop my comment in the bucket of "I don't play runescape but I watch DMM because of Torvesta's videos". It's honestly baffling how terrible Jagex is at making decisions. Like borderline absurd given their record. You could literally put a monkey in charge and get less scandals and insane decisions haha.
---
Clans would abuse the fuck out of this man... it'd be worse than the current situation.
---
have you seen none of his other video he doesn't do it immediately he does it later on
---
It's actually muling, as in using an account as a "pack mule" of sorts. Basically they're just alt accounts that can hold items and just stay in safe zones so they dont have to risk anything
---
I hope James bans the word torvesta on the stream cause Twitch chat is gonna have some fun with this

Ah okay, I guess I misunderstood AHK. I suppose I was confusing it with macros that move your mouse automatically and allow speedy gear switches. I'll cross that out in my original post
---
A simple pvp competition of matched gear would not be interesting to watch as opposed to the week of preparation and the final hour in dmmt. Also, the large majority of the best pkers are already in singles clans, and having a pvp competition of matched gear would only alienate non-pkers (most people, even those who play dmm) even further. One side problem is that ahkers are not detected (or at least not punished), and are apparently a growing problem nowadays, which could compromise a possible pvp-only tournament in the future.

Go bring 50m risk to 44s and see how quick you get baited and then have 20 people fall in on you, they dont make shit off of PvMers or bots unless they can skull trick them. Wildy is dead partly because of these clans abusing the fact the PJ timer is non existent (which just makes people only pk on BH worlds even more because theres actually a pj timer) and spec trading/just tagging you with 10 different people. My minds blown you dont think the majority of people they kill for the most money are other pkers lol.

I do believe they stated vefore that they consider muling placing an alt in a safe zone with wealth that never leaves the safe zone kinda like what he was doing having a flipping acciunt is muling.

Haha i got pretty lucky! Thanks man. I got it on 145 kc (well obv in the pic lol) but i was laughing so hard. I literally stayed for a few extra kills cause i sat there and said to myself "well what if..lets kill a few to be safe" after task ended and sure thing 5 kills later lmao. I was literally gonna tele after that kill to!

Solo players can't take advantage or else ban
---
Some people are content with being a smaller part of the larger clan victory, which is fine. And how do you think those big members got to where they are? Most of the super fed members of clans are the best pkers and the best hybrids. They've worked their ass off to get to where they are
---
Both.
---
Nice tiny edit, lol.
---
No he just used his alt. They only DQed his main
---
Pvp should absolutely not be ruled out in OSRS. Tribridding is a part of osrs that has been under appreciated in its growth. It's the number 1 thing that really highlights the unique combat that this game has &amp; shows that osrs has a place in modern game competitiveness and entertainment.
---
Holy shut the fuck up man 
---
But you still have to win a shit ton of 1v1s to be the actual champion. Every single winner of DMM has been a skilled player on an individual level, even if they are "exploiting" an ""unfair"" (lol) advantage.
---
Lot's of other people have "alts", are they going to get DQ'd too?
---
The rule has always been it has to leave the safe zone, dude was lvl 3 straight parked at GE

depends on what you do, if you plan on slaying more, buy upgrades to your current gear, or invest in rigour, 78 herb for raids etc whatever you feel like you'll need

The issue isn't that it stops, that makes sense. The question is: why does it often pause at 9999 specifically?
---
Did you buy one to test the price?
---
And the problem is made even worse by the fact that pking clans in osrs are about as bad as you can get, just the other day I saw a thread about some kid getting scammed his bank just trying to join one of these clans and the pk community just said he was an idiot therefore he deserved being robbed. Jagex are pushing people towards these toxic clans.

Thought you implyed ddm should be solo only. I feel yah infact i only fuck around in ddm and havnt played for real or with a clan in a while. Bro rush dds day 1 with a few people and go fuck ppl up. Thats my fav thing to do in dmm hahaha.
---
&gt; That's bullshit, 9 times out of 10 a better player beats a worse player
---
I guess it depends on what you think "beat" means. If you mean kill, not always. There are TONS of times someone who is objectively worse and possibly in worse gear too just survives off of pure luck and RNG even though they do everything wrong just because the other much more skilled person gets shit RNG/hits and because mage is pretty awful. The point really is that people arent really punished much for doing something wrong, you can sit with just range pray up and not die because mage sucks. You may not kill the other person but you can still easily live by being clearly the inferior player by far. Honestly A LOT needs to be revamped with PvP, you can be in great gear and still hit like ass and someone doing the wrong things still gets away easily. I mean theres so much broken/need fixing if they want PvP to be taken seriously and actually be a legit esport like they claim they want. In WoW, youll be punished hard if you keep doing the wrong things and die, completely different in RS. Skill isnt nearly rewarded enough and poor play isnt punished enough with how things are. Given their incompetence when it comes to PvP (I mean this is the same company who literally removed PvP in the past and are now slowly killing it through neglect) I just dont see how they will ever make substantial and impactful changes at this point, its something theyve said multiple times over the years they want to fix and are trying to and yet...nothing?
---
Because if the buy limit is 10k and you bought one previously within the last 4 hours then 9999 is the remainder of your 10k limit
---
By that logic sparcmac will get DQ'd for alting too
---
I did. I figured out that it was the buying limit being 10,000. Thanks.

---

---
...Care to elaborate?
---
Torvesta is the only reason to watch DMM. Clans suck and are boring cheaters.
---
Yes that obviously takes skill. The problem is someone who is THAT skilled and can do all of that quickly and accurately (which really is not many people, just the top brids mostly) is not rewarded as much as they should be for being that much more skilled than someone else. Mistakes are not punished like they are in other games. People can sit there and camp range pray with just dhide/karils top and tank legs and tank mage hits because mage is garbage, they may not kill the person who is much more skilled than them but they can pretty reliably not die as long as that person whose much more skilled than them doesnt get some really good RNG with some big hits. And thats exactly part of the issue. Not only does PvP need good, fresh, and enticing updates but a lot of shit needs fixing and some shit would just need a straight overhaul if they are serious about making it a legitimate esport otherwise it will continue to be a joke.

Torvesta is one of the only reasons I watch anyone play osrs and the DMM tournies. This just guaranteed I'll never watch any DMM content any longer. I hate pking and the wilderness but I still find the whole idea behind it interesting and humorous. This just cements my beliefs that clans and Jagex dont actually care about anything other than money and protecting the fuckwits who ruin normal rs gameplay. I've had a love hate relationship with Jagex since they took away free trade (also when they muted me for an inside joke I made to my friend in a cc with some random I wasnt aware of, which was 10 years ago) but this seriously makes me question the entire companies competence. They might as well make DMM ultra clan friendly the way its going. 
---
lol i care about the torvesta thing more than the last thing people were spamming a few days ago. i already forgot what that was.
---
&gt; I don't really see why a solo player should have an equal chance of winning when they deliberately choose not to use all the resources available, in this case resources being other players.
---
The problem is a solo player legitimately has absolutely 0 chance of winning let alone even getting to 1v1s or getting deep into 1v1s. Even someone who is technically "solo" who joins a clan because he has to still has basically no chance because theyre more of a meat shield/pawn for the higher ranking clan members during the multi stage and they also arent being fed the best gear so even if they get to the 1v1s theyll be at a huge disadvantage. Im not even sure why people play DMM who arent streamers/popular with clans, its completely pointless unless you like just feeding the people above you/being a meat shield. So even if you ARE skilled, that pretty much has little impact on your ability to win.
---
He is a niceguy
---
I don’t necesarily disagree with the ban, but Jagex should just ban Alts if they want to prevent muling. Alts on DMMT make no sense other than for muling. There’s also a limited number of people so banning alts make sense to allow more players. 
---
I'll be on Mikas stream. But if he gets unlucky again I'm not going over to the official one the way I used to
---
The main thing I hate about this is DMM and LMS were really fun games first time around. I won't even bother played anymore, because I know and can see that all the big PVP clans have got their strangle on any and all tournaments. There's no point playing anymore, and no real point watching now that one of our only good DMM streamers is not playing.

When have I ever said its ok for them to break the rules? They're subject to the same rules as everyone else.

This is an awful solution though, because dedicated clan mules aren't being banned. So an account a clan has dedicated to the same purpose is being permitted, but it can't be done by a single player multi-logging. they either need to ban every account which holds or xfers wealth/flips or bank stands, which is impossible to track because clans will transfer wealth since donating is permitted. they need to ban clanning in general for dmm or allow alts and add trade and G.E limits otherwise it's impossible to compete "legitimately" as a solo player.

it was his cc, not his clan. RoT and such litcherally have people holding popular spots, as well as they will be feeding their best competitors. Torv was getting all his gear on his own
---

---
There is a maximum of 2000 accounts playing on tourney worlds. It would not be hard to scrub the world for all of the active IP address' and compare them (similarities between IP addressing can be one early identifier) for muling. Sure there are definitely ways to get around it (VPN's, ect) but add the above to other data sets they'll be storing and there are definitely ways to detect it. Given the fact that there is 32k on the line, they should be clear of this rule set and be enforcing it appropriately.

Surely you cant be serious right now lol...? You insinuated it when you think its ok for Torvesta to be banned but the clans using "skillers"(not really just skillers, obviously lol) is completely fine and the feeding of just the top clan members is fine too making it appear like its a legitimate competition when it isnt, the only people who have any chance of winning are those top clan members. Ive read your comments in this thread, youve done nothing but play an extremely pedantic game of devils advocate and indicated clearly that you think theres no problems with clans.

Except they clearly are not...? I mean RoT blatantly broke rules(even going as far to DDoS a bunch of opposing clan members) with the help of Jed and won multiple tourneys and won a bunch of money and yet they still let all of those people and clans compete again and are still competing in this one. They all abuse the rules muling and what not, and everyone knows that (except for you..? Willful ignorance?) and yet they have never been punished.

Yeah it's not bad, I think most people opt for the Obby maul for 1 attack builds, but that also requires 60 Str.

Hillary isn’t a socialist and if you honestly think that you’re dumb af lmfao.

But saying all democrats want socialism is about as accurate as saying all republicans are nazis lmao I’m more libertarian myself but both sides are complete bonkers
---
They do a good job for the most part, especially in regards to community interaction, but still have a long ways to go. Their balancing of the game, polling of updates, and sluggish response to crisis are notably some of the biggest issues the game has. I can tell they are really care and want whats best for the game, though, which is way more than I can say for most game companies, and even the Jagex of old.

I mean you're saying this but all it is sitting by a fire.

Reddit complains that someone got banned for breaking the rules.
---
???
---
Sure dedicated clan banks are against the rules but you know full well there is nothing stopping clan members from trading all their best gear to their leader at the last opportunity.
---
&gt; Solo players will never have a level playing field with clans. It's just in the nature of the game mode. Multiple people working together and collaborating will always, and I mean always, do better than an individual working by themselves.
---
And this is why DMM is a broken game mode. You cannot just disregard the solo player base, they absolutely must be catered to in everything that Jagex does with RS unless it’s content specifically made for teams. Fair enough that clans should be allowed to compete but they should have their own competition so that clans only compete with clans. As other users pointed out, the point of DMM is to attract more players to RS but nobody is going to want to join in a game where they can see that the only way of winning is to be carried by a team. Clan members winning against solo players aren’t actually winning or proving anything, allowing clans to compete against solo players is like allowing Connor McGregor to fight a toddler and claiming that it’s a fair competition.
---
What pisses me off more is that because of this BS rule, despite Jagex saying this is ok, it makes DMM impossible to win for solo players, so how the fuck do they expect to attract new players by making it harder to join for people who arent part of huge clans?
---
You poor soul.
---
Good luck.

they did not your chatting shit and getting 40 points reddit is so stupid i cant handle it. BTW he trained his alt and used it in the final
---
Progress report??
---
what the fuck is this? you're weird  
---
This whole thing could’ve been solved by banning alts from the dmmt limit each ip to 1 acc , this also lets more people qualify 
---
This movie is so fucking weird. 
---
Did that alt receive wealth from his main? Yes.  
---
Did that alt ever leave the safe area? No.  
---
Muling.
---
There's no grey area.
---
&gt; However, the j mods fucked up by telling torvesta that he could last season. 
---
Yes, they did. Muling is against the rules. It shouldn't have been allowed last season, either. Either there was a mistake in either season (this one or the last), or their policy changed in between the two.
---
&gt;  there are the clans who funnel wealth to a few players to buy gear for the best players. What about these players? Were these players also banned?
---
Funneling wealth to players who are still actually playing DMM and risking said wealth isn't against the rules, as far as I know. Alts (and clans) aren't against the rules.
---
There's a reasonable debate to be had over whether they should be, and from what I've seen, clans are the biggest issue with all of PvP, not just DMM, so I think it's fair to say most people think it should be against the rules, but aside from making everyone on DMM an Ironman, it'd be a hard thing to prevent.
---
&gt; It would have been okay to banned torvesta if they are applying the rule behind the ban fairly and equally, but right now there is no evidence that suggests this is the case. 
---
If you mean applying the *same* rule fairly and equally, I disagree. It's hard to really prove muling. Torvesta made videos talking about the fact he was muling. There was video evidence of him doing it. A ban was pretty easy to justify with proof like that.
---
As for the assumption that bans for muling aren't being given out fairly and equally, I believe that is simply because Torvesta is a big name, and an individual. It's hard to really ban "the clans," and most of the other individuals being banned are probably nameless nobodies you'll never know. Most people don't have the following to make a big stink (or have reddit make said big stink for them) over being banned for breaking the rules.
---
What do you want to prove that this is being applied "fairly and equally?" Screenshots of other people being banned for muling? There's plenty of that, I'm sure.
---
&gt; Also dick move for them to give him the okay last season 
---
Should've ended the sentence right here. It was totally unacceptable for JMods to say it was okay to be breaking rules. I'd much rather they make the right move this time around than use a precedent of accepted rulebreaking as justification for further rulebreaking.
---
Thanks, I just unlocked brews.

Torvesta also plays with a clan you fucking mong. He plays in the 800man alliance get a grip dude.

---
Love the art, but if they were to release nex armors they would have to be massively scaled down, not have the overheals etc
---
I can see why you feel that way but you are greatly underestimating the communities ability to exploit anything they can about this game

DMM is and should be Clan vs Clan. PVP tournaments are for 1v1 or king of the skill etc
---
These people think that every guy that PK's is a hardcore pvp player. 
---
Kinda blows my mind how the top tier armors and weapons mostly have ZERO upkeep cost.
---
Barrows Has a cost, Serpentine helm was really done right with scales as was blowpipe. 
---
Stuff like the armor and rapier from Theatre of blood having no cost is dumb. Scythe was done right
---
Twisted bow is stupid stupid stupid OP, that shit is beyond Tier 92 and people are scared of tier 80's lol

Doesn't matter how strong a armor or weapon is, as long as it's labled tier 75 the community is happy with it.

---
I feel it really turns any old MMO into a proper MMORPG, get really into doing one quest start to finish at a time! 
---
The thing is, he was given the green light by a J Mod last DMM saying that what he was doing was okay. You also won't see them doing the same thing to clans. 
---
Sounds nice 
---
So what you want man. My advice is just work on questing and let everything else fall in place.
---
The trick is to read the dialogue instead of holding spacebar.
---
Get some farming levels while you're at it and start doing herb runs. Really nice and easy injection of money into your cashflow along with your main money maker. Doesnt take too long to get to ranarrs.
---
Completely defeats the purpose of DMM
---
Even if they unban him. He lost a shit load of time because of this bs ban.
---
That's still muling if the alt is pretty much always in safe zones
---
It's a meme, btw.
---
No I mean originally. This isn't where I know the actual tune from
---
If the mechanics of the mode were kept as is, I think it would be even more interesting if the players were limited to playing x  hours per day.  That way they'd have to really pre-plan their builds and there'd be a bit more variety in  said builds over a bunch of guys killing themselves to grind out  a bunch of 99s.

If you think community opinion doesn’t matter because it doesn’t have a price tag on it you’re disconnected from how selling a product and keeping it alive works.
---

---
That is the same answer as one of you're mom's clients had when he saw the state of her pussy. He still came inside. 
---
At that point you would just see wealth transfer between accounts. The IP check would just show related accounts
---
I see the distinction you are making now. As aposed to one who logs in, accepts loot and logs out, one would be going out grinding and handing it off to their superior who buys pots and gear upgrades to bully people out of their minion's money makers.
---
I don't love how many hours people have to play to be competitive and I could see this being an interesting shake-up. The lower level gear and accounts would probably be a drag in the final 1v1s though.

How does this make any sense? People who care about the price of stam pot prices are more likely to be players who also care about the price of other resources.

Yes but it was also dead on release as if you just walked/used run as it restored you would get where you were going faster than stopping to rest

Jamflex has the mobile cash cow now. They dont need the small subset of people that give a fuck about pvp or cmm
---
Also the fact that if people do have to go out of their way in order to not be detected then it’s clearly against the game rules and they won’t bitch if they do get banned
---
Well it wasn't dead on release, but it would be pretty dead in osrs. People weren't as savvy and efficient back then so a lot of people just assumed that it was better to rest. Also as a kid i hated how slow walking was so I prefered to rest and grab a snack quickly or whatever, so I wouldn't mind it in todays game
---
Imo, they should go the other way around. Leave Torvesta as is and DQ all the clan members!
---
He wasn't using the alt so that he wasn't risking on his main, he was using the alt to make money so he could actually do useful things on his main and not worry about losing too much time making money.
---
Most likely phished like omirocx mentioned. Aside from "forum pages" you might have clicked on a fake "change password" email. Did you give your authenticator (and pin) anywhere else other than the login page? You will ONLY be asked for authenticator when logging in to your character account and bank pin when opening bank interface, nowhere else, not even website login.  
---
Since your authenticator was still intact your email was not compromised/recovered, and since they knew your bank pin, it's likely you got phished, or you may have downloaded a fake client.  
---
Regardless, if you intend to continue playing, change your password, set up authenticator for your email (or change it and set authenticator if you think the hacker has knowledge of your email), disable and re-enable authenticator (prevents hacker from using the "remember for 30 days" option) in order to re-secure your account.
---
What he did shouldn't be against the rules in the first place or all clans should get banned. It's unfair for clans to be allowed to do what solo players can't.

I said that in one of my comments. Often skull tricking though isn’t trying to skull people who want to fight back, it’s trying to skull people who are just trying to protect their stuff by deceiving them into thinking someone is trying to help them so they skull.
---
Yes I get that, clans are basically griefing in DMMT. Locking quests out so nobody gets piety is pretty scummy, but Jagex doesn't do anything about them and can't do anything. Jagex can't monitor every single player, especially whole clans and behind the scenes stuff like DDOSing. You're all expecting Jagex to ban clans which will result in a lot of innocent clan members getting banned aswell just because they were sick of playing solo deadman. Plus, Jagex automates the bans anyway, and clan players already have ways to bypass those... Why are you even expecting Jagex to be competent?
---
For me the RS2 feeling was dead when those came out. You might be too young.
---
So.. he was using a mule and got banned for it, yet people are mad at Jagex?  
---
He legit broke one of the rules and even admitted it in his video, but then goes on to irrelevant stuff like "people use ank in main game" "people rag you at camelot bank in the main game". Side tracking the whole thing from him using a mule.  
---
Ban seems right. Doesn't matter if there's clans in DMM, or if people trade items to one person, that's not against the rules. May be unfair, but it's a tough thing to solve.

Hard agree on the warning part. 0 to ban is pretty bullshit in most scenarios, especially for people who aren't *trying* to break the rules, they just don't fully understand them and break them by accident. Torvesta wanted to do the right thing, but didn't realise his precise combinations of actions were against the rules, which sucks.
---
&gt;Even if its not somebodies alt, you can trade it to a clan member who stands in the bank and just claim you are "helping a buddy out" even if you do somehow get caught. Whats jagex going to do, ban you for giving money to a friend?
---
Yeah, I've often thought about that. What's the technical difference between helping out a mate who doesn't log in for a few days vs storing money on an alt? Similarly, what's the difference between a swap and a donation? These grey areas are just one of the numerous issues with DMM unfortunately. I really don't envy Jagex, but it was their choice to try and turn DMM in to something serious... So I guess that's on them to make it work.
---
Damn you’re right.

This is how you meme folks. You dont just repost the same shitty-beaten-dead-horse $11 meme, you build an entire fuckin city in minecraft. 
---

---
I dont really agree with this. Part of runescape, DMM included, is grinding your stats up and getting money for items. You aren't just doing PVP all the time. As long as people start at the same time, with the same items and stats, it should be an even playing field, comparable to fortnite I suppose. The clan issue is real but doesnt change much, if you start on an even playing field I don't see anything wrong with that.

---
dead wildy without venezuelans just clans
---
in light of this ban, the clans would probably transfer some wealth off the clan mules just in case.
---
Came here to say the same thing
---
I mean he had full black d hide in his main, and pots a emblems and gear, that's a pretty big risk on day 2. He just didn't have his cash stack, which because everyone is spending their cash until day 4-5 just to stay up with everyone else it's not a big deal imo. If he was training using shit gear and trying to hide his wealth of accept it as muling, but just using your cash stack to flip and then trading over gear once you have it isn't really muling.
---
I mean I feel like guys who run in groups of 29 while holding down quest areas risk a lot less than he did, but clans aren't banned.....

I understand that. But the issue being if you want to penalize 'muling'.. which isn't really muling (it's using two accounts to help you stay competitive as players with clan advantage)... you need to address the real issue - and that is no one standing a chance because clans feed each other items and screw solo players during dmm.

Also, let me get this right. A player trades stores most of his money on another account of his, and thinks it's not muling? Holy shit this community is actually retarded and dick rides any influencer.
---
It’s bold but it’s entirely true 
---
this is why osrs is dying
---
Jesus this guy is fucking over rated. His content is fucking boring. 
---
Not if you’re bridding 
---
For the lads lol.
---
Oh dear, torvestas fanbase must be actual children. Please don't plague the subreddit with your youtuber drama bullshit.

But the money is just gonna be RWT to some fat whale?

As long as the J-mods ban every player unfairly gaining an advantage during DMMs from clans, and 'muling'. Then sure, your comment means something. Otherwise yeah they shouldn't of DQed Torvesta. So go crucify the rest of them as well. 
---
At least the sand casino is part of the game, hacking isn't. It's messed up that you'd rather show support for hackers than for normal players possibly suffering from a gambling addiction. 
---
Then its not really a big deal, take the one you feel like you do less dmg with
---
It is, but these casuals won't understand
---
I enjoy watching it 🤷‍♂️
---
I’m dissapointed that this ALMOST rhymed but not really
---
As long as the J-mods ban every player unfairly gaining an advantage during DMMs from clans, and 'muling'. Then sure. Otherwise yeah they shouldn't of DQed Torvesta. He wasnt even 'muling'. He was actively playing the second account to help compete against clan advantage. 
---
What is it with pkers and just NEEDING to talk shit? 
---
If you’re on PS4 then yes I can send you a link. I will be switching to pc soon so for a while there won’t be a link
---
Which isn't allowed. Certainly not by higher-up influential figures. Seems like a justifiable ban.
---
He was actively playing the second account to help compete against clan advantage, lol. 
---
🦀🦀DONT ABUSE IT🦀🦀
---
Yeah well thats what Torvesta did the only difference is that he is playing the 2 accounts.
---
A streamer abusing the rules and pushing the line? Ofc they'll ban him. They won't listen to a bunch of people screaming.
---
The hive mind has decided dude, the power of fandom has overruled all logic and reason. If frontline was found to be doing this there would be outrage on the front page.

Aha the copyright symbol! Good job
---
Taking what personally? That you were able to google a quote from a childrens movie I got wrong? Okay you absolute weirdo lol
---
:)
---
I mean, the rules literally say "player" not account, so as a player, he was dq'd. Jagex just came back and tried to act like the rules are account based even though they literally say "player will be disqualified" not account.
---
Wheres the season 2 blue cape?
---
Weird how it has to happen to someone famous for anyone to care.  Got perm banned without chance for appeal on 2 accounts for swapping \~ 1 year ago, DURING THE SEASONAL, not during the tourney.  Meanwhile it's okay for donations/clan feeding.  Pointless game mode for solo players as it is atm.
---
If jagex cared about unethical play in the tournament and a fair playing field for all Torvestas ban would be just. They do not. Until they get clans in check and work a few things out they had no business DQing Torvesta. 
---
You wont do it pussy

In dmm or in the actual game? I have alts that do different things. Besides the startup costs they are self sustaining and rarely interact with each other. I'm curious as to why you feel like it's almost cheating. 
---
This’ll show them! 
---
Jagex are bad at communicating anything and deliberately keep it vague so they can always default to "well, we did say this, actually" 
---
I feel like its account sharing. 
---
As long as you aren’t transferring large amounts of wealth from one account to another, or have a history of buying/selling gold (trading with flagged accounts) you should be fine. 
---
I used to play this game all the time as a child and due to other commitments I had to stop playing but still check in on content creators on YT. I kept my subscription active to help the game develop more after mobile being such a great success, recently due to all the fuck ups from updates and now this I have cancelled my membership ( which I don’t play ). Hope they will eventually come to their senses about all this but the game is rushing ahead too fast forgetting the basics. 
---
\#FreeTorvesta
---
Then the clans should be disqualified for using accounts specifically for that kind of stuff. Someone in another thread pointed out there's an account with 1 in every stat but crafting. There's no way that is trying to compete.

What happened to torvesta ? 
---
Maybe the first 30 times the joke was made 
---
Hello son, it's me, the great-grandfather. I've been dead for a long time now but I like to watch you and Torvesta play that machine doodle game from beyond the grave.
---
It's my fault Torvesta got banned for muling since he was trying to honour me. I was actually a mule for WW1, transfering items from warzone to warzone. Little Torvy has made his great grandfather very proud. If slavemaster Jamflox can unban him, I would finally be able to rest in peace.
---
Says he's muling in vid, kicked for muling, people mad?
---
Cancel through the actual jagex website so you can select an option of why youre quitting.

I do have to say, it's sad to see that because you died in the Wilderness and had some random internet person speak poorly to you, you vote no on PvP updates on 4 accounts... 
---
This conversation was held years ago, if PvP doesn't thrive other elements of the game become stagnant. You seem like a skiller, therefore your potions, runes, food among other things all get used by players who take part in PvP and PvE. If those elements of the game die, so will your income. 
---
As much as some people in clans can be toxic, voting no on something that obviously doesn't effect you also seems toxic to me.
---
How much are you making at chins? Because air orbs are around 350k an hour.

Verac helm, blessed dhide body, Verac skirt, barrows gloves, DHCB, Pegasians, Archer ring, Fury ammy.
---
Do I take my DFW or a different shield? And is assemblers better than an untrimmed ranged cape? Any other comments about gear?
---
Is he... Is he giving Will Smith an old-fashioned ? $11/10
---
There was an app update yesterday that claimed to fix it in the update notes. Still isn’t fixed for me. 
---
I think more people are taking issue with the fact that in previous tournaments he got the a-ok from a moderator for using an alt in that way, and with the fact that other DMM players breaking various rules are still in (player harrasment and racial slurs, also muling, and clans being gay).
---
It's still possible that he was doing something different with the account that he didn't mention in the vid, but the other issues do stand.
---
Better to just use nmz, if you really want Max afk there you can do normal mode and not use overloads
---
I think you can tank one or two hits
---
That doesn't make sense. Deadman mode is all about pking people. Its how you play the game, you kill people and take their loot. To remove that is to completely remove the gamemode itself.
---
then we delete dmm
---
He uses that clan for protection during training/slayer/and the final hour. But they don't feed him gear and items like most clans do for their "top players".
---
Hi Dad!

Yeah that’s what I thought aha!

---
Wait, is Muling allowed as long as you skill in safe zones?
---
I trust Torvesta 50x more than I trust the liars at Jagex 
---
Regardless of that, Jagex still turn a blind eye to all the clan BS that ruins the game
---
New member noob here!

What is better to level Up first Range or melee? 
---
Currently 50+ in melee stats 63 Combat level. 33 range only.
---
I want to use slayer also! But only 37 atm thanks!
---
I find it helpful now a days to generally have around 3 - 5 accounts up at A time with some of them farming shit like coal or working on wc. Helps add a bit of income. 
---
Well, nothing you can really do about them, unless Jagex up-s their anti-bot game by a mile. I would sugguest to work towards getting 500 and then 750 total level in f2p skills- literally no bots on these worlds and the game experience is okay, because the competition for resources is much lower.
---
When I started OSRS a year a go I did this - First I went to hill giants in populated world. There usually are some people powerleveling (not looting their stuff, even big bones) so go ahead and loot them, sell at GE. When you have like 100k, start flipping mind runes. Go to any rune shop (Varrock or Port Sarim) and buy every mind rune pack on sight and open them, then sell the runes at GE 4gp ea (might take a bit to sell). Doing this you make 1gp out of each rune, because each mind rune from a pack is 3gp. So if youre able to buy 100k mind runes you make 100k and so on. It is kinda boring way to make money, but I made like 3m in couple of days using this method. There are rune shop running bots also, but they are usually after the death runes, so If you see a shop with solid death rune stock, buy these as well- they are the most profitable.
---
Now kiss
---
Lmao bitch trying to tattle tell
---
You too.
---
I got an account banned for muling over a year ago, before muling was even listed as a bannable offense. They acted the same way, they ban the account with combat stats, and didnt ban my second account.
---
&gt;Lasttime they did this 
---
Stamina pots didn't exist back then. Energy pots likely crashed because they revamped run energy entirely with the same update, massively boosting the regen rate. Everyone was also highly inefficient back then, nobody with access to stams is going to sit their ass down for 30s to refill their energy.
---
So much yes to this. J-MODS NOTICE PLZ
---
It's almost impossible to enforce and even then you won't solve the problem of clans blocking specific areas so others can't complete some content (e.g. Shilo Pass quest shown in the video).
---

It’s a status symbol; you want best in slot gloves? You have to work for them.

black full helm bonuses at 1 def, added +7 magic def, only weighs 0.453 kg. good for zmi back in the day
---
Usually you only have 1 free trial available. When I tried a 2nd time, it didn't give me the option. That makes me think it's most likely safe. Also, are you using a different Apple ID / Google account?
---
How are you going to ban people from teaming? Ban the friendslist and clanchat? Ban discord and teamspeak? Send pictures of people teaming by tweet? C’mon bro you know that’s ridiculous

---
Yea exactly, it’s already boring. 
---
At least it has a benefit of a bit of a passive money maker which is always nice.  Take that away and it just feels a bit of a shame 
---
Balanced properly this would have little to no impact on stams. Only a sucker would start wasting their time sitting around to recharge energy when they have stams available to them.
---
Hey guys just a reminder that RoT blatantly bottled giant mole on dmm and nothing was done
---
There are possibly ways around clans, but that doesn't not take away the fact that they have an enormous advantage when they team up. 
---
I'm not against clans. I'm simply questioning if it's fair that they are allowed certain advantages is a tournament like DMM where there's prizes on the line and the intention clearly is that the best PvPer is supposed to win, not the best clan. 
---
Haha, no. A defender just goes into the shield slot and provides the best offensive bonuses for melee. It's free too :) (although does take anywhere from 1-3 hours to get depending on luck)
---
It's a game of progression and increments. Nothing comes easy. At this point you're pretty much asking to be spoon fed. 
---
Ok Reddit account made minutes before this comment was posted

Mechanically, the fights are more "interesting" but I wouldn't call them better. The tick system does not lend itself well to the direction they've taken that game.

They have never used internet before other than google, they'll probably google "what is article 13" after they go home today.

I legit made an account so I could reply to threads :p

Dude, I've had this question since it came out. Just release an ELO style coliseum arena and let us see the top-ranked people from each season duke it out for the top prize. Would be a lot cooler. Everyone only watches for the last tourney fights anyways.

---
Im lost, 6 hours ago we were w torvesta!! What happened!?!?
---
Lol so when should i switch to a defender? For melee traning? or should i have always had one haha
---
Theres a HUGE difference between 'being in a clan' to do green dragons and being in a clan that is feeding you gear like it's a fucking pyramid scheme without you actually having to give back.
---
Look at Alfie right now, he's in Blazers, but they're not just feeding him an unnessecary amount of gear. Same thing for him last season. He had to contribute and trade within his clan just like a solo player would. That is grossly different than someone in Frontline/RoT (or any clan) getting to focus on training stats all tourney and then getting the gear spoon-fed to them. 
---
And before its brought up, I know Alfie gets donations from viewers, as do many streamers, but that's not the issue at hand here. To me that's also a problem, but the cause of that is a lot of them feel the need to accept donations due to the way clanmanmode works.
---
But 175 QP. I have 90 and that took me long already.
---
Voising your opinions and pointing out potential flaws comes off as anger? 
---
Hey Torvesta, I don’t watch your videos or play DMM but if you want to start a 2 man clan Ill trade at the GE for you
---
neither should be banned. any language should never be bannable
---
I like this idea but people could just sabotage entire factions with alts
---
Broly?
---
Fuck DMM
---
Good point, I forgot to mention that.
---
66 att, 70 str, 65 def, 63 range and 62 magic :) you'll be fine. Just take a rune crossbow and Iban's staff with you. Once you've got the strategy, you'll have no worries.
---
He asked in a previous tournament if what he was doing was okay. Im guessing that the circumstances of the last tournament were different than this one.  He probably had stats on his alt last tournament instead of a level 3 with no stats that never left the ge

---
stfu kid
---
Please tell me you’re joking lol
---
Basically he got banned for “muling” when he was using an alt to hold his stuff while he was out and about, yet he had prior permission from jamflex to do this, and clans also do this and go unpunished. 
---
What's the runelite site?
---
What are some good plug-ins for it? 
---
what are better games for pvp do you think?
---
Because you'd still get people purposefully dying to their mates to loot trade. Or drop trading.  
---
Clan wars resets stat boosts which makes it a tad annoying for some activities though. In addition to not restoring spec.
---
But ik we are talking about stamina here
---
Yes but this has nothing to do with osrs clans 
---
No gays
---
what does it mean?
---
IS there a tweet or clip with the jmod telling torvesta that?  I am curious what exactly was said
---
Yes to rest by fire, no to restore run energy. We don't need more ways to restore run energy. F2p already has energy potions. What I would like to see is more idle animations like sitting or flipping a coin/dagger. Those are the few things rs3 has that I'd love to see on osrs.
---
Had to throw the hackers a bone 
---

---
well tbh from jagex point of view

22$ vs a clan

20\*22$=440$

so i see their point of view having a few clans &gt; having a few dedicated players
---
make the whole map single combat?
---
lazy meme good
---
It would require the time and oversight that Jagex isn't willing to commit to, but it would be possible. 
---
DMM is inherently flawed and will never have a successful tournament. Change my mind.

Thanks Peter, your explanation of this trendy hip meme was very satisfactory and it demonstrated the cultural context of said meme very well for all the hip kids who might not be with it. Tune in next week for an explanation on sbeve and until then, happy meming!

he absolutely almost admits to muleing in episode 1. He gets black d'hide, and banks it while he does wildy Slayer. Except I bet he puts it on his alt for the time being, so he doesn't lose it.
---
Doesn't matter if he's playing his alt, if he is deliberately keeping extra items safe on his alt in a safe zone. 
---
"muh clans, why is nobody else getting banned?"

Nobody else admits to it on video.

U’re saying that 50m on my main actually is better than making and enchanting emerald rings on my ironman?!?? Get outta here

Don't know about that. But I'm willing to bet it's not okay for anyone and this is not the only ban they have made. Of course some people might get away with it though. But Torvesta didn't, tough luck

Ah, gotcha. Alright, well, ‘nice’ chatting with ya I guess, too bad it took this long for me to realize you really don’t have anything to say about the actual discussion and just want to shit on Fortnite. 
---
Ideally, just turn off multi for players. That way everything is 1v1 when it comes to fight mechanics. That won't necessarily solve all of DMM faults in terms of clanning but it will make it significantly more bearable to play/watch especially as final hour rolls in.
---
No you got the gist of it.
---
You get tokens for the cyclops by killing reanimated suits of armor and then head upstairs for defenders Bronze -&gt; Rune. Once you get Rune there's a basement behind the Warrior's Guild where you grind out the D Defender. 
---
You can't stand at the GE and get banned and then say "I was about to move but I got banned"
---
*deep sigh of disappointment* I was really really really looking forward to watching him kill it.  Its so boring watching a clan cheat their way to the final reward.  Watching torv was like watching and rooting for the underdog, even if he doesn’t make it to the end. And lmao jagex wont use reddit as their customer service, so instead they will use absolutely nothing? Geniuses.
---
You can xfer one to me whenever is a good time for you
---
If you're wanting to get rid of the frog spawns you can use bank incenerator. Sucks that you can't withdraw noted to flex though.
---
We'll i'd say that they both deserve to be banned in my opinion.
---
You are definitely right about this. Mabye Ironman DMM? That would actually be cool to see in my opinion.
---
oldschool restscape
---
This has a lot of potential meme in it for shooters
---
That is exactly the feedback they got from the playerbase. Customer service is an actual joke. Like that guy who got hacked and they said “you didnt get hacked because it isnt your account” and he lost everything. They need to get their shit together
---
As much as people might disagree with it. This is so true. I mean no one should be sitting in front of their computer for 20 hours a day. Even Pro Esports players whose profession it is to play do not play 20 hours in a day. 
---
This game mode is a awful idea because this is like the only event where Jagex kicks their PC/sensitivity training bullshit to the curve and says fuck it lets let the monkeys exhaust themselves than battle it out for a few grand that we will never pay them. All while we get to promote runescape for around a week. 
---
Now, in the idea of entertainment and drama. I love this time of the year. I get to watch these people slowly go insane over this game mode. It is almost like a reality show addiction for me watching people have to get around clans and how they can progress the furtherest before they eventually get DDosed by a clan or some how get killed.
---
Literally stfu lol
---
He literally said in his last video that once he has gear on that account he was going to use it to kill monsters and stuff.
---
Torvesta barred from DMM for using an alt while clans are allowed to get away with murder. 
---
Isn't the fan giving the streamer a donation a false equivalency? The fan doesn't donate to a streamer with the expectation of reclaiming the donation at a certain point, and the donator no longer has control over the wealth after the donation to the streamer takes place.

Torvesta was barred from DMM while clans are still able to get away with murder.

Funny how 2 words are all that’s needed to melt a snowflake these days, completely ignoring everything else that was said and stomping away from logic like a giant crybaby.

I got perm banned on 2 accounts for swapping.  Figured it was impossible to compete without swapping.  Haven't played again since.

Does it matter? I don't even watch or care for dmm. I just like to fuel the flames.

Torvesta was banned from DMM for using an alt while clans are able to get away with murder. 
---
Hmmm... what do you mean murder?
---
Torvesta was barred from DMM for using an alt while clans are able to get away with murder. 
---
Fair enough, it is still a skill which is good to learn, and that's how I did it.
---
A post that’s not about torvesta??
---
I think that yes, if you give your friend a big chunk of your wealth and let him stay in the safe zone while you go do dangerous things and then he gives it back again then I would consider that muling.  It would be different if you gave him gold or supplies and he used that to train up the stats and that gold/supplies doesn't make its way back to you but maybe he crafts you some black dhide or something.
---
2nd situation seems totally different from what we are talking about.  You are taking wealth from an account that is (most likely) playing in dangerous areas and giving it to another account that is playing in dangerous  areas.  Also on top of this the wealth is never going back to the original account which is the main point of muleing
---
Yeah I spent over 1.5k bolts :/
---
This is a quality meme and as a practicing ICU nurse I can confirm that this is the medically correct way to explain to Jagex where and how to shove it. 
---
Just call the event clan wars at this point...smh
---
Ironman DMM seems to be like what it has to be for true solo fairness
---
Clans repeatedly block quests from being accessible, and enlist lower ranking members to hoard wealth and trade superior items to them at finals time. 
---
The quests are so ridiculous

Lord, imagine if Jagex ever banned Swampletics for some stupid reason...sub would  I M P L O D E .

oops

its a huge nostalgia trip. new quests are trash, riddles with lame memes i just hold space bar through them.

You could also bring guthans if it isn't a task that requires you to keep your slayer helm on and you don't care about a little attack/def exp.

It would be cool if there was a mode where it was ironman mode and then at the end everyone fights in a 1v1 setting.
---
RS3 has bronze to dragon “gauntlets” instead of gloves that can just be bought and equipped. Theres also bandos gloves
---
Youre completely right. Might as well be. Solo players have no chance. 
---
Why do you care that they care
---
That's what baffles me. He's done it every single tournament so you know they've seen it. Why not just tell him this tourney we will ban you if you do that.
---
Yeah its wrong but at least he knows then
---
He's an annoying content creator, cue the brainlets freak out when they won't get repetitive video #/9xx
---
Is getting ganked at multi the biggest issue with clans? 
---
What about loot? Or more specifically death-trading?
---
What about the final hour?
---
I like your attitude
---
Dont get runelite taken away too sheesh
---
Not really anything related to being an ironman moreso about efficiency, collecting 1000 feathers from chickens in an hour or purchasing 15k from stealing silk for an hour...
---
What did I do now?
---
According to the rules on the OSRS homepage clan's are not allowed to do that.  
---
"Muling, which can be defined as: using a separate account to store wealth. This includes clan banks. Alternate accounts are permitted provided they are used competitively. Players found to be muling will be banned (including clan banks, and those who use them)."
---
If you watch his video the alt was clearly level 3 and had not done anything other than sit in the ge. 
---
hahaha. i am an idiot. thanks for that. my bad

But the problem isn’t muling everyone’s pissed Bc 1) clan leaders do this. 2) he was using the account and leveling it (so he wasn’t just at the GE flipping it Bc he had 60+ combat stats prior to getting ban). 3) the jmod okay’d it. A combination of all 3 is making this much bigger
---
if the clans were caught doing it they would be banned from tourney as well.
---
Clan members have been banned from tourney non-stop its not like they are above the rules
---
how? Jagex assigns 1 employee to 1 person to make sure that he is not colaborating with anyone else?

No, I think that’s what being *young* feels like. Most people played before musicians and quit before them.

I got hacked 3 times due to me streaming, similar situations.. always relating to me making bank staking as well. And now I'm perm banned for 'rwt' which I never did. It's nearly impossible to get a response from Jagex or the support team. Hopes high though!
---
I really don't care about this, torvesta or dmm in general. One person gets dq from deadmode man and its a big deal?

Hey, but in case you’re not just *pretending* to be an idiot, anyone looking at this thread can clearly see there is exactly one adult here and it isn’t you. I came at you with a serious discussion about DMM’s flaws and you came back (twice i should add! Saying the exact same thing!) with ‘nope can’t be done go back to fortnite’.
---
Which, and ~~no~~ offense, is really childish.
---
And the most embarrassing part is you think you won here, you just argued *circles around me! 
---
Who needs to actually *be informed* on things when you can just attack the other person until they realize they’re talking to a (stupid) brick wall and then claim you ‘offended the snowflake’ or whatever.
---
Man people like you are a real piece of work.
---
Because instead of watching another gigantic clan win out, some of us enjoyed watching the solo underdog try his best. And the fact that he got banned for such a trivial, widespread, accepted part of solo dmm, pisses everyone off. I didnt think this was drama was too hard to understand, in fact, my 5 year old cousin can understand how unfair this is.
---

You shush, get off the bandwagon, torvesta probably wouldn't argue for you, don't be an old head and mess with runelite 🦀
---
&gt; All bots fall into one critical issue. They are bots. This means that their is always some aspect of their behavior that is repetitive or illogical.
---
Yeah, and once the first bot gets banned due to your new method of identifying "repetitive illogical" behavior, the next update will circumvent that. 
---
Bots have been an issue in every MMORPG since MMORPG exists, people make a living out of that so I don't see how do you expect them to stop because one single update. 
---
I like this idea. Could just implement trade limit like they did in 2008
---
Where do you draw the line between valuables and resources?

Is the 10k he traded him considered a valuable?

Based on his first video, all of his valuables were on his main(Tyson Glory)

I mean either it is against the rules or it isn’t. You can’t have it both ways. 
---
Deadman mode is basically a survival mode tournament thing. PvP clans basically pick one account to lead them and therefore have a ton of people involved doing different tasks to gear up the main. So the main gets given all this high lvl gear from clan members.
---
This makes it pretty much impossible for any single players to compete.
---
Torvesta was trying to compete as a single player. He asked the mods last DMM if it would be allowed for him to have a main account and an alt account. The alt would merch or whatever to fund gear for his main. They said it would be fine. Then they wouldn’t let him in DMM mode because he “broke the rules” by having an alt.
---
Meanwhile these clans are basically doing the same thing on a larger scale.
---
Merching at the GE with his mains wealth
---
Who watches Deadclan Mode anyway? It's always some rando from a huge clan that wins it.

---
You would have gotten a lot more upvotes with some shader mod
---
Yeah bro clans totally arent muling and not getting banned for it, they totally adhere to every single rule completely!
---
I mean its not like some of these clans dont regularly break rules in the main game and have long reputations of doing so! Its not like Rot didnt DDoS in one tournament and break tons of other "rules", only to continue playing in tournaments there after and its not like many of these clans are linked to DDoSing in the main game. Youre talking about these clans like they DONT have bad reputations that involve breaking rules in the main game and other shit, why on earth would you think they WOULDNT attempt to break rules in DMM when theres actually money on the line? I mean how freakin naive can you be? Jagex has already proved time and time again over the course of the previous DMM tournaments that these clans can break/bend rules and easily get away with it, the precedent has already been set for them so why would they stop and how on earth do you think they DONT do this shit?
---
Legitimately mind blowing someone could think clans that have poor reputations in the main game and have been known to break rules in previous DMM's are all the sudden completely innocent and not breaking or bending any rules anymore. Wake up my guy, Jagex is horribly inconsistent with applying their own rules, this has been a regular thing forever.
---
You gotta remember homie, no matter what dart you put in you always have to pay for 2/3 of a scale per shot regardless. And furthermore the assembler recovers 80% of ammo (accumulator like 72 I think?) So in reality, you're only really paying for 20% of a dart per shot. So for addy darts you're paying 148 gp per shot and mith darts you're paying 124 gp per shot. Meaning the difference is really not even close to as significant as it seems initially. 
---
Dumbed down it's essentially that online content must be passed through a copyright filter to make sure there's no breaches of copyright. Obviously for sites like Reddit &amp; YouTube for example which receive millions of posts, that would be impossible to achieve.

This. Their payroll budget would be insane compared to the minuscule prize of dmm.

Yeah unfortunately you'd need to at the least use your cash stack and buy a bond then sell your members stuff then. 
---
I would say it’s worth it to get proselyte armor if you do not have it, and keep doing what you are already doing.  The prayer bonus is so thicc that you use way less prayer pot doses during tasks.
---
Is this really what happened? I was under the impression he told him it was ok to have a second account but never said it was ok for him to have his second account just safe for him and act as a safe bank for valuables. Which, I might add, completely ruins the whole idea of dmm. 
---
I could be wrong. 
---
Pray/gear switches and faking while bridding requires far more than fighting most pvm outside of inferno, raids, and tob. Most gwd is basically afkable at this point.

Again, I’d rather listen to the official rules you can find than what a jmod said. And if he said it, I want screenshots of this conversation before I’d go against official rules. This is a tournament for like $20k, bending the rules shouldn’t be okay just because “BuT cLaNmAn MoDe”

You spelled shutdown wrong.

But it is related because playing Ironman mode means you can't be efficient. But to answer your question, Grant in Port Sarim sells feather packs.

Well said, I fucking hate Jagex. Good content creators are the only reason I play this game.
---
Whole community is toxic
---
This is so stupid. Give him warning. He's one of the biggest promoters. Come up with a more intelligent solution to muling. It's your failure that muling is possible
---
To put it into perspective, early stages of seasonal DMM cash is valued 1:70 &amp; can go higher. So add in that it's the tournament, cash is worth substantially more.
---
Try not to make so much sense. People on this subreddit don’t seem to like that.
---
I think it’s a reference to a previous jmod smackdown
---
Torvesta and other content creators got their "skilling and flipping accounts" approved, specifically asking if it was against the mule rule.
---
Jagex said no, it wasn't, and they were fine to use. Muling was putting all your mains wealth onto a separate account that didnt play the mode, keeping the money safe in case you die (cheating the game mode).  Having a separate account that is mostly self sufficient and just earns money is NOT muling.  
---
Muling would be "holy shit I got a GWD drop, better trade it to my alt in case I get PKd so I dont lose it".  That is not what Torvesta and other content creators did and it was confirmed by Jagex that having a flipping alt is A-OK as long as they aren't using it to protect wealth/valuable items for the main account.
---
Torvesta was hit to be used as an example bc he was the largest DMM content creator.  So they knew that everyone would find out and "get the message" if he was banned for this one.  The problem is - as far as we can tell - they banned him for alt flipping under the "muling" rule AFTER jagex confirmed alt flipping was not only allowed but necessary to compete as a solo player against clans in DMM 
---
Iirc I get somewhere around 130k magic/def exp per hour on greater nechs (no alts), using kodai and God vestments
---
Idk why jamflex is having a huge brainlagg and not warn torvesta first before banning at the least.

If you have any buddies who play who trust you have them let you borrow the gold for a bond and pay them back after you sell a few things.

What are some of the flaws you see in DMM?
---
Doesn't change anything
---
Because its just yet another major fuck up by Jagex where they show how utterly incompetent they are (especially when it comes to PvP) and just try to bullshit their player base (more specifically their PvP community) with pure lip service. Theyre a complete joke, they cant go a few weeks without some major drama stemming from their own incompetency and its getting pretty old. The sad part is this is right after they come out and say how theyre super serious about making big changes to DMM and making RS PvP into a legitimate esport when they pull bullshit like this while clans have been breaking and bending rules forever in DMM (and the main game) and PvP has received little to no updates and they still have not fixed many major things in PvP that have been major problems forever and that the top/most popular PvPers have been telling them about and how to fix for YEARS. The issue is they claim they want to listen to these people and use their knowledge/experience to help fix and improve PvP and thats just proven blatantly false over and over again, its just a major slap in the face.
---
Jagex is going to end up completely fucking up PvP yet again, apparently they didnt learn the first time when they just completely removed it instead this time theyre just doing it through a slow burn of neglect and incompetency. 
---
Also, if they discontinued dmm as a whole, they money saved including production costs and prize pool could maybe cover ONE dude's yearly salary?

There’s way too much hate against justiciar capes that I feel is just because people want to gatekeep. I got my first cape using justiciar and i learned many aspects of the inferno such as 1t flicking, flicking both blob and either mage/range, flicking mager and ranger when they’re lined up behind a pillar. I didn’t learn how to offtick or how to pray flick both mager/ranger at Zuk but I highly doubt it’s because of justiciar.
---
Like you said, it’s literally like a couple waves where you use justiciar, most notably 53-56 and 60-63. When I used it and ran south, I still flicked too, kept range pray on and flicked to mage when the mager attacked. With ely too, I never dropped below 50 health using the method so I really can’t understand how people call it inconsistent

---
it could be easy to fix, but jagex close their eyes once again... if they'd just increase the chance of good fish on higher levels, the rates would be much better.
---
Right now the reason you get such low rates is cause 99% of the fish you catch is Bluegill
---
You act like he did that for the entire tournament. The only video we saw was for Day 1 and Day 1 is the most important day to generate money so the supply is there and prices don't skyrocket to max price. He has done this for almost all tournaments. He even mentioned in his video that the alt is the one that does wildy slayer for pvp weapons once flipping is done for primary gear.
---
I get that you don't like him and want to justify his DQ, but shit, at least try to read what actually happened.
---
No, its not.
---
Again, you are misdefining muling.  Trading, donating, funneling, etc between accounts are all allowed in DMM tournements.  If Torv trades his alt 10k to help with earlygame items, flipping and skilling that is not against the rules and is not even close to muling.
---
Muling is not simply "trading between two accounts owned by the same player".  It is, specifically, "trading large amounts of wealth or valuable items to an inactive account in order to keep them safe".  Muling is a good rule as it stops people from cheating the game mode by, essentially, risking nothing on their main while they level it up and progress.  This is NOT what Torvesta and other content creators did.
---
If your definition of muling applied, every single account that traded gold or items onto a different account to make it stronger (aka every single clan in DMM) would be banned.  
---
The issue is that donations are allowed in DMM. So big clans can funnel all there cash and PVP gear into one player and get away with it because they're just "donating" it.
---
Whether or not Torvesta should have been DQ'd is debatable, but it should be consistent across the board.
---
If he plays silly games, he's going to win silly prizes.
---
Remember when all the autistics in this sub decided to cry a bitch fit about streamer favoritism? Now the monthly flavor is this. I think people just look for shit to cry about to justify their own existence. It’s like looking for RuneScape drama is the core of these kids lives when they could easily stop paying monthly if they actually felt some type of emotional way.. but they don’t feel that way really. They just think it’s cute and genius to repost the same memes year round.

You can buy enough for 99 fish within 10 minutes by buying feather packs. You need 200k gp for it. Either rush hunter for impling alchs or do winterdodt.

I'd love to see him unbanned just on principle, but at this point his tournament is over regardless. He would be too far behind to justify grinding out the last few days.

Funny how streamers always get "hacked" right as they win something big in the arena :D but don't post anything about it or you'll get downvoted to oblivion

Yeah thats what i was hoping not to hear. I guess i'll do some AFK training till summer and then kick on from there. Already done ogresses, can only really range them and have done it from 40-61 range, which i was fine with till i started watching videos in which people were not using the maple shortbow haha. I'm still getting the hang of flipping so i'll try get better at that. Thanks a lot for the reply

Vork isn't that varied in terms of setups so I'm gonna guess it's elite void, salve, pegs, archers i as is usual. Use bp for specs to heal and dhcb for dps.

Yeah any option to have it play through all the songs you have unlocked, regardless of your location, would be awesome. Also, the option to create a playlist of your favorite songs would be great too.
---
You are misdefining muling.  Trading, donating, funneling, etc between accounts are all allowed in DMM tournements.  If Torv trades his alt 10k to help with earlygame items, flipping and skilling that is not against the rules and is not even close to muling.
---
Having another account whose purpose is to funnel gold and/or items to a main is not only NOT muling, but allowed by Jagex.  Its what every content creator does (Mika, Solo mission, etc) as well as how every single DMM clan is structured (there is a "main" account that gets all the resources funnelled to it from the others).
---
If your definition of muling applied, every single account that traded gold or items onto a different account to make it stronger would be banned.  
---
A higher level would be handy to maintain your damage as your range pot starts to tick down, but you'll be able to do Vorkath pretty efficiently, already. Just get your range XP killing the dragon. Might as well earn some money while you're at it.
---
Immediately rescan your pc and if nothing turns up, I'd honestly just do a restore.
---
After that change all of your passwords to something unique for each account.

Good luck bud.

The only reason the wealth is on the account is to flip and buy items, though. It saves him time making money and having to sit in GE until his items buy. After he gets his items he puts them in his deposit box on his main. 
---
But that’ll make the godswords less unique
---
&gt;Apparently its too much to ask for a company to simply enforce things like a normal, competent company would.
---
They are either incapable or unwilling. So yes it is too much to ask. Quit if you don't like it.

Billions are traded over the black market every day with no punishment, hundreds of thousands of bots and goldfarmers 'play' the game unpunished, and yet you sit here and start crying because a few dozen people slip through the cracks on a game mode you don't play and skirt the rules unpunished. Go be outraged somewhere else. Or just quit because things are not going to change.
---
Jagex disqualified someone that was recording themselves breaking the rules. Reminds me of the time when they "banned" AHK. They don't actually ban people for using AHK unless you brag about it or record yourself doing it. (see: that one time autumn elegy streamed with it and people spammed reddit/Weath's twitter to get him banned)
---
competitive castle wars tournament in with similar coverage to the Deadman tournaments would be extremely popular. Especially so if they had big streamers participate and shoutcasting
---
yes, muling is storing wealth from a risking account to an account that does not risk.
---
You are assuming that the only time Torvesta traded wealth to his GE alt was the initial 10k from stronghold. I highly doubt this was the only trade he made from his main to his alt, or else he would not have gotten banned.
---
He was more likely going on slay/wildy trips, and bringing back whatever excess he made from them, and putting it onto his lvl 3 ge locked alt. 
---
Seerz is actively doing things on three separate accounts to try and get an edge in the DMM. Hardly worth DQing him.

---
Yeah but the issue is Reddit acts like PKers are always the toxic ones and the person getting attacked in the wildy is just some innocent victim of some mean and toxic pker. Whereas in reality the PvMer getting attacked will A LOT of the time(at least in my experience) be salty and be the one to start throwing around insults first because theyre mad they cant just kill something without any interruption in the wilderness. I pretty much never talk shit until someone says something first personally, and then they will get whatever they deserve. 
---
Somehow people on here delude themselves into thinking its fine if a Pvmer is "toxic" to a pker because theyre getting attacked in the wilderness, but if the Pker started it all the sudden the pitchforks come out and it turns into a 500 comment thread circlejerking about how toxic Pkers are and how PvMers are such innocent good players.

I mean in my opinion, most people are too sensitive and take shit WAYYY too seriously and personally. People freak the fuck out and go on a reddit crusade to try and shame and name someone for talking shit in a competitive PvP environment, like theyve never played a sport competitively and know shit like that is a common occurrence and theres nothing wrong with it. The sad part is most of these people that act this way are fucking ADULTS, I mean just imagine going and crying to someone in real life about how somebody said some mean things to you and talked shit...youd get laughed at. But everyone on RS wants to be some SJW and sit on their moral high horse.
---
He was not straight up muling. Both accounts had substantially levelled stats and he even received useful pvp/pvm drops from both. He was hardly muling unlike these clans using strictly muling accounts. 
---
A time investment and content were more or less taken from Torvesta
---
My account security is best it can be now, I paid to have security and got falsely banned now that I am finally secure.
---
Some context is needed I suppose. For reference, I don't care about either DMM or RS streamers in general; I just believe in informed opinions so I did my own research. 
---
Torvesta is both a 'crowd favorite' and seen as 'the little guy' standing up against the 'big bad clans' that [reputedly] monopolize DMM and keep taking home the cash prizes on offer from the seasonal tournaments by having a large group of people farm gear and then trading all of that gear to a few characters; the entire point of DMM is that you have to PVP with limited resources, and this tactic is seen as basically cheating given that these clans tend to store their wealth with players who sit at the ge flipping and buying gear for the clan's chosen few to use at the end of the mode. 
---
Torvesta was using a second account he claims to have been actually playing [rather than just leaving in the bank forever] to flip his way up in an attempt to compete with the clans. He had previously sought out and obtained permission from a jagex representative to do this [in a previous season, however no rules updates were made banning the tactic], so he used this tactic again and was on the cusp of qualifying for the finals/had qualified [this bit is unclear], when without apparent warning he was disqualified for 'using a mule'. 
---
This angered the community because he had previously cleared his alt with jagex as *not a mule* and now they had changed their stance without warning and without disqualifying other players using the same tactic, right as the crowd favorite was about to 'beat the system' and get into the finals potentially in a position to win. 
---
Confusion seems to be spreading about whether or not he went and did anything on his alt this time other than sit in safe zones, but regardless given the [*apparent*] lack of warning from Jagex on the issue and the unequal enforcement, the overall impressions seems to be that this was Jagex 'bending to the wishes of a PVP clan' again. Personally I doubt that, but the *perception* is there, and that is what has generated this controversy. Regardless of how justified or unjustified the disqualification was, Jagex's poor handling of the community and silence on the matter [once word spread] has simply allowed tensions to build. 
---
TLDR: One way or another, chalk another one next to Jagex for 'PR screwups this month'
---
I suppose so. I don't claim it to be any work of art. But at the end of the day, I made it so I have the right to watermark it! If anyone would like an unmarked copy I'd be more than happy to send it to them. I didn't think it was that big of a deal haha. I mean, I can repost it unmarked. 
---
So
---
I think you need a rewatch mate, it's Plankton's line
---
Your a douche
---
Exactly. Thank you for doing a much better job than I did at schooling these people that have nothing to say besides "well he broke the rules he deserved what he got". Because that is hardly the end of it. 
---
Hahaha always the case mate. People start wearing one as a 'joke' or claim it's just comfy for wearing around the house, but the symbiote that is the mighty vest always ends up taking full hold.

He did. He clearly talked about it because he was led to believe he was doing no wrong - because honestly.. he wasn't. 
---
Ardy cloak, dramas staff, explorers ring, picking up all loot for slayer tab (I presume)... seems like you’re doing everything perfectly. Goon here probably buys his gold. Keep it real. 
---
He woulda been downvoted maybe but its not worth making a new account over
---
Just wait for eoc v2....you act like jagex hasn't done this before there buddy.
---
Never have, never will bud.
---
Do a farm run. 
---
Do a prayer run. 
---
You aren’t maxed Asy.
---
Or you know just cut them up into bitsized pieces
---
equally weird flex but ok
---
Yeah and the problem is made worse by the fact that apparently the grown ass adults who play this game are too insecure and sensitive to just either talk some shit back or laugh it off as some idiot on the internet whose mad, and instead take it SUPER seriously and personally. I really wonder what people are like in real life who act like that in game, the real world is a muchhhhh tougher and more "mean" place than RS.
---
u/jagex_weath said he will take a look! Wish me luck guys! Justice!
---
Atheism OSRS edition l0l
---
Didn’t RuneScape have musicians that had this same effect placed on main roads and stuff?
---
Guess you've never been to gwd then
---
Damn it’s just the fact that I have to sit there for so long and you can’t even bring Alchs on the boat
---
Same thing happened to me. The community agreed I must have leaked my own info because RS cant be hacked with 2 way. Sry
---
&gt;This is pretty poor and flawed logic. How do people seriously act like PvP is some uniquely "toxic" community? For one, the ironman community can be just as toxic have a disgusting level of superiority complexes, and that goes for high level PvM as well specifically with raids. So by your logic, should those things not receive updates as well? No of course not, they receive literally 50x the updates and attention as PvP. Look at any game with highly competitive PvP, toxicity is ALWAYS there because you have a lot of immature people hiding behind a computer screen in a very competitive environment and its not something unique to RS PvP AT ALL, its just the nature of the beast. Again, using your logic should those games PvP be ignored and become dog shit too?
---
When you have a game with many sub-communities, if one sticks out in a negative way, people tend to not want to help them. I've never claimed that it's unique to RS or OSRS, or that PvP games should not exist. I'm saying that their behaviour ingame and on the forums leaves many people with a bad impression, and they don't want to help them out. 
---
Let's take a look at your first comment. You said that Jagex was 
---
* BY FAR the most grossly incompetent company when it comes to PvP
---
* They NEVER produce anything
---
* Their incompetence is seriously pathetic
---
* You suggest that they might be dumb
---
In my book, that's quite agressive, and not constructive at all. 
---
&gt; And why do you think its so small now? Could it be from the completely lack of attention and fixes and updates that has driven the people who actually participate away as well as not enticing any new people to join in? PvP was huge back in the day. Of course the community that receives 0 attention is going to keep getting smaller when 95% of the attention and effort is committed to PvM and ironmen, so those communities grow..I mean MANY PvPers switched over because of that. 
---
In terms of ingame time spent, PvP in 07 has never been anywhere close to "big". Yes, there are some youtube channels that makes PvP content, and some streamers, but they are, and have always been a minority. 
---
&gt; Oh jesus christ please dude, can you stop it with the bullshit? So Jagex has SUCH limited resources they cant even FIX small things that could have a large impact (notice, not even talking about major content updates) over the course of YEARS? Please. And their resources are so limited even though the game has exploded in popularity and therefore revenue? Again, youre just spewing complete nonsense excuses. This isnt about ENOUGH ATTENTION, this is about ANY attention and effort at all over the course of years. You cannot possibly make any legitimate and valid excuses for their neglect of PvP as hard as you want to try dude, the proof is in their years of inaction and complete incompetency. 
---
Do you really think that they want people to be angry at them? If there truly was an easy fix, they would have taken care of it ages ago. Just because you might thing that you have a good idea, doesn't mean that it would actually work well in practice. A core principle when developing any kind of new technology or games, is to take baby steps and understand all the implications of the changes you are about to make. If they made a change to the way PvP works and it went badly, they would be crucified. 
---
&gt; Do you ever stop it with the pedantic bullshit? Not only that, but what youre suggesting would OBVIOUSLY have absolutely zero impact. Top PvP streamers and pvpers have been in contact with Jagex for years telling them what needs to be fixed and still are, and yet NOTHING. So what exactly would be accomplished by me sitting here and posting about it in an irrelevant reddit comment? 
---
If comments here doesn't help, why are you complaning in the first place? You are here, in a post about muling in DMM, badgering me about the lack of updates for PvP. I even said in my original post that Jagex should do more about PvP. You are the one that initiated this entire conversation, but you're only interested in complaining instead of trying to come up with solutions. You want everything to be perfect for you, without even bothering to tell them what you want and how you want it to be done.

REV UP THAT DEADMAN CUZ I SURE AM READY FOR A 
---
HELP
---
MY DAAAYS
---
Ok yea that’s what I figured, but man that really sucks. I really enjoyed that first video he did and he was the only content creator I was following along with for DMMT.
---
He was the last one alive. Sounds like he won to me
---
He was mueling, plain and simple.
---
Who would win ? Youtube legend that brought thousands of new players into the game or one hoover boi ? 
---
Alright
---
really...by far one of the biggest steps? staminas are far more easy scape. This would just be a nice feature for ironmen and low lvl players who cant afford them. I don't see how you think this would affect you in any way besides being scared of something you associate with EoC

Fire making is already worthless why make it even more shitty

I'll repost unmarked

why would you take donations if you have a tbow? You deserve losing your account you money-grubbing jew
---
If they ban Torvesta for muling then they need to ban fucking everyone.
---
He is saying he’s tired of everyone saying “meet xxx my xxx locked Ironman.....”
---
I'm 100% agreeing with you. Justiciar is in the game to be used for places like the inferno. I agree even at zuk it's usefull to tank the ranger. 
---
Some people are elitist assholes. Just ignore and play the game how it's meant to be played. 
---
Unbearable, unless you're going to ddos the entirety of RoT, you're not getting much done there.
---
Staminas are high level herblore potions that cost a decent amount of money to use. Resting does not. It was purely put into the game to make it easier.
---
What's next? Lodestones?
---
He'll have to wait in line. 
---
Do you take donations on your stream? It’s possible someone donated $1 or something to see the email it goes to and then got to your account like they 
---
It's the client you're using mate. I was on vanilla client for YEARS and YEARS, finally a buddy convinced me to try rsbuddy and I was super hesitant about it because of all the stories I read and all the comments of "oh no its totally safe". 
---
I tried the new client and was so enraged on how much better it was, then got hacked with 2-factor and bank pin when I had a little hiatus. The stories are real my friend. 
---
Hooonestly don't think people really want to use it. It's just that you thought to even watermark it in the first place is really weird.
---
Narthr stfu bro... You legit read this guy's comment and nitpicked a few points and took them out of context...

If you don't know what you're talking about just read without responding :)

no, get me on that shit

No player has ever been banned for account sharing in osrs unless it was for the purchase of in-game services.
---
not to mention it will be a nice improvement to ironman run issues. Grinding graceful is one of the first things I'm doing on my ironman cuz I really dislike running out of energy every 30 seconds.
---
It's empty space for Raids III

If it was really unjustified DQ then you can be sure they won't respond. Did Jagex ever said in public that they fucked up? I don't recall it at all. 🦍

&gt; @FraserRS @JagexAyiza Account sharing isn't something I ban for, but the buying/selling of Infernal cape services is. There are awkward cases involving long-term shares which are looked at case-by-case. Calling favouritism is ridiculous, I don't discriminate. This is just karma hunting on your part

yes? no?

Clans aren't running multiple accounts per person so it's not the "exact same thing" (or at least that's not what they're being accused of)

thanks a lot

yeah but they are expensive? f2p doesn't have the expendable cash that many member accounts have

Delhi, India has a giant smog problem and we need to solve it
---
Rules are for thee, not for me.
---
All of this could have been avoided if they just warned him before the ban.
---
Jmod PM: Hey Torvesta, we've noticed you're using a second account for flipping and this could be considered muling, so please stop immediately or you will be disqualified.
---
Id rather rc
---
This is one solution, but if you're just concerned about runescape you should just make a fresh email with a unique password, change that to the registered email, 2factor it,  and then never use it for anything else. If you don't use your email/password combo for anything else then it can't be leaked from a database cuz it isn't *in any databases*. 
---
That said if you're using the same shit on like, your amazon account...that should 100% concern you. The whole "use unique passwords" thing is not just a meme lol. 
---
No problem sir.
---
* Have 2 auth on both email and account
---
* Unique passwords on both
---
* Don't use your email for literally anything else(if you didn't know this when you made the account you're SOL cause you can't disconnect that login name)
---
* Have 0 friends so they don't know anything about you
---
* Don't talk to anyone about yourself at all
---
* Don't use the same screen name on rs that you have anywhere else
---
* Don't allow anyone to know your account's wealth
---
That's the only way you can be 100% sure to be safe
---
Just speaking the truth, regardless if its what the people want to hear. Not saying he is a bad person or not entertaining, but he isn't cut out to win.
---
Yep, but what are they gonna do? Roll back the whole tournament to right before he went in? Shitty situation with no good solution. Now we know though. 
---
I thought you was quitting osrs?
---
It’s more like they should take clearer stances, he’s done the same thing the last like 3-4 seasons and not gotten DQ’ed.
---
Well we aren't even 100% certain that's what happened in this case. This is just the streamers assumption. It could really be anything.
---
I'm no expert, but usually getting keylogged or ratted comes from running an executable masked as something legitimate (think gold_doubler_totally_legit.exe). I've seen cases though where people have been infected by just running a java application from a browser or even flash (lookup java drive by). These are rarer nowadays though because browsers have come a long way in terms of security.
---
It could be from a number of things though. Maybe he's played some private servers, maybe he downloaded a video editing software that looked legit and wasn't but went undetected, etc.
---
Usually though it's from the user downloading or running something.
---
Be careful mate. Tried to transfer 450m Rs3 and got taken to the cleaners from a “Legit Chat”.

But he won’t have to worry about getting smited

Can’t put a price on that qol gain of that ornate pool. It’s too convenient

"Friends"

That’s the best fix I’ve heard, limit literal playtime to like 6-8 hours a day. Doesn’t kill clanmanmode but really fucks with it.
---
YouTube Torvesta. I will not spoon feed you the information.
---
He got us wet
---
Exactly. Not muling. 
---
Repent, heathen.

I mean he’s not gonna be deep wildy nhing, he doesn’t have protect item.  1-13 prayer builds only pk at the g/e and edge, where you don’t use overheads anyways
---
I like the one guy’s idea of not watching the DMM tournament, but I don’t think I wanna lose my membership, they haven’t fucked uo that bad yet
---
Understandable, but “the rest of the community is shit” is a pretty bad generalization. There are more players that are trustworthy and respectable than players who aren’t. If out of all the times you interact with others in the game only a few are toxic/annoying, that’s a pretty good percentage. Also, I don’t think this guy did anything wrong. He’s not toxic from the info you provided, just a little daft for not mentioning the collat first. 
---
“We’ll get you your account back but we aren’t editing your account to replace your bills”

“That’s okay I’ll rwt to get some money back and play again after my account is fixed”

No lie.

Hmm yeah, I guess the whole gamemode is irrepairable then
---
Move over lads and let ROT collect their quarterly paycheck
---
I wish people wouldn’t watch it if they didn’t like it.  It only perpetuates dmm.
---
Yeah u sure are worried about a fair tournament by wanting a blatant muler back in the tournament
---
Mulers ruin it for actual solo players, they are cut from the same cloth as the cheating clans (which should also be banned btw)
---
It’s actually a gray area.
---
I'm not your friend, pal.
---
It's just memes man, nobody cares enough to organise a boycott. 
---
Also the crab meme is definitely working, the announcements last week are proof of that to me. It's childish but after years of silence it snowballed into this stupid meme culture we find ourselves in.
---
I'm not subbed here because the posts are crazy and I didn't want softcore sandwich ladies on my front page. But the sub is still worth coming back to for the latest drama/funny content/discussion threads. 
---
Don't take it all so seriously. And remember reddit is the vocal minority.
---
The people who become successful steamers dont have time to be in a clan. So what we have is every top streamer being solo and influencing the masses that clanning is lame because their fav streamer isnt in one. 
---
But he asked a jmod and the jmod said he wasn't breaking any rules.
---
15% pain

Hey thanks a lot

Frog spawn, an unnotable food. You can feed it to your cat as well as to yourself. The player in the photo got a big stack off them from gourmet implings, which have a common droprate for easy clues. 
---
Still in line
---
Most subbed OSRS Youtuber. One of the best DMM Youtubers. Disqualified for playing two accounts and muling.
---
Tbh at this point just ban everyone cause fuck it 🦀 $11 🦀
---
I also don't play osrs anymore so i don't care THAT much, but if i wanted to return it would be nice to still have my like 15m that i do have lol.
---
Actually a really cool idea, reminds me of a game called Rose Online where you would get buffed next to a fire.

The comment above literally says before Stam pots are in the game. Dude don't waste my time with dumb replies
---
Home tele 
---
It just seems to me there is this huge resentment to clans which is odd for an mmorpg.
---
 From what I can tell, Jagex does take action against clans aswell by disqualifying a clan of 50+ using a lvl 3 alt banker.. 
---
The last few dmms have been more solo focused than clan focused. I do agree that it should be mixed up. Do an entirely solo dmm and an entirely multi dmm. And mix in different pk builds in between. 
---
Welcome to third party, unofficial, probably fake, Runelite client which is unsupported by Jagex (rightly so)
---
Right, that completely skipped my mind, mb
---
Ah okay, thank you!
---
Botting a main isn't even hard though. The scripts are all out there and reviewed. As long as you don't go crazy botting 24/7, put some variety in and some manual play, you likely won't get banned. If you do, it'll be 48 hours because the perm first time bans, the distinction is if you're a goldfarmer or real player, from what I've seen. A very fresh account may also get perm.
---
Now goldfarming on a non-suicide operation takes way more effort. That's because you're focused on one thing, a moneymaker, squeezing variety and manual play isn't ideal, and the less hours you do the less you make. Plus you need to train the account up and not make it look like a bot.
---
Suicide farming on the other hand is very easy after figuring out scripts, VPS and proxies for each instance.
---
2009 bud
---
You clearly havent played DMM but i will try to explain it.
---
You don't flip in PVP areas in DMM. Just inside the grand exchange. His flipping account was because he plays basically solo, meaning he has to max an account in 7 days, but also make enough money to buy gear. There is not a lot of selling activity going on in DMM. So sometimes it takes him a while to make a trade.  
---
If he trades an item he received for cash, he then has to sit in the GE until he spends that cash into items that he can store in a safe deposit box. Basically his flipping account is ONLY there to save him time. As he will never leave the grand exchange with a cash stack he will sit there until he sells it and puts the item into the safety box. Which can take time. Lots and lots of time.   
---
From watching his other videos, he makes sure to keep all the items he intends to keep and use for the final on his main in the deposit box. Only items he is actively trying to sell he keeps on the flipping bot.  
---
Torvesta was the really only solo player that ever has a chance to win. The man can flip like no other and is good at pvp. Even being a "solo" player he still is forced to do tons of things with clans. 
---
With Torvesta getting banned it is officially RIP forever for the DMM solo players. He had a hard enough time when he was using a flipping alt, now he can't. 
---
I would argue you are probably *objectively* wrong here. DMM overall has been an incredible Success for Jagex.
---
that said, they're obviously fucking a lot of it up.
---
I dont have an incredible amount of coding experience, but it seems it would be pretty simple to add a feature that allows the user to tick songs, and index them in an array that will have a random index selected and played.
---
I agree. Takes 30 seconds to go to the GE between slayer trips to adjust flip offers.
---
Weak excuses for muling.
---
Actually infuriates me to look at this. &gt;!USE THE FUCKING PRINT SCREEN BUTTON.!&lt;
---
It does have a monopoly, it's just not 100%.
---
r/pics 
---
that was stolen
---
He wasnt *too* bad for me, but I never attempted the boss until I was maxed melee. I open up most kills with a BGS spec and cannon w/ granite cannonballs, so he melted pretty quick on a good portion of the kills. 
---
If you stand in the right spot you can hit him 5 times with the cannon plus your spec before he can even dig haha.
---
Yeah lol it's worth securing. Especially because once it becomes unsecured even once, they will always have a reasonable shot at recovering your account from then on so it can really never be truly secure again. 
---
Good luck!
---
Fellow Mac player here, what software do you use to stream ?
---
Well I did the 0 friends part...
---
I know the story, not gonna read that wall of text 
---
Many people in DMM play the role of distributors for items that are hard to obtain. For example, having a high crafting and magic level so you can provide glories and d'hide armor to other players so that they can buy them off of you while making profit off of it. Then, trading that wealth to the main to get good items and what-not. Those types of accounts play an important role to the game mode.
---
The medium must match the art.
---
😂
---
Small chance it could be runelite? 
---
Try to get a printout with color of the rotations, or use a tablet to look at the rotation chart if you can. I’ve recently learned zulrah for the first time, exclusively on mobile too. I just look at my iPad for rotations, and as soon as you learn the flow of everything it gets super easy, even with a six way switch on mobile lol 
---
There is a herb sack u get with slayer tasks though right?
---
Impressive
---
Why? This is literal shit lol.

I trade u 70 farming and tanglefoot for 70m xp

Is that supposed to be Ruth Bader Ginsburg lmao
---
* Jagex creates gamemode where it's ridiculously easy to cheat
---
* Everybody cheats
---
* Popular youtuber cheats
---
* Jagex DQs popular youtuber
---
To max hit. Dharoks armor ability lets you hit higher if you have lower hp. You get much more xp if you set it down low instead of staying high with prayer. 
---
Lower to 1hp with absorption and overload potions and you’ll be there for hours. 
---
Bless you for this summary post
---
I actually would love the idea of a 4 ironman team in deadmode. Sounds awesome!
---
Jagex does do streamer favoritism lol. Torvesta was borderline breaking the rules. He was str8 up breaking then. If torv was muling but still doing dangerous shit on the mile, jagex would probably let it slide.
---
Minus the part about jagex saying it was okay last time (where weve only heard one side of the story).  
---
Why don’t we take a budgeting class 
---
50%*
---
10% + 20% + 15% + 5% + 15% does not add up to 100%
---
in the current dmm you can get killed by a clan right away as you enter an area in multi with at least single way combat you'll have a fighting chance 
---
maybe add immunity to players who kill another player for 30 seconds or maybe dependent on the amount of items that where lost on death's value, EX: so like 1 minute of immunity per mill lost in items
---
as for you max stats and max gear thats like making a tournament and not a game mode
---
I remember reading this too, that's why I havent been making a big deal about the current situation, cuz it seems like Jagex already made a plan way before this drama started (I'll get mad if it's not what they hyped it up to be)
---
thanks I'll give it a try
---
When a guy with the name  [**hahastupidd**](https://www.twitch.tv/hahastupidds/clips)**s**  asks you to bring a tbow and you accept. Smh.
---
ah okay, I just use runelite and dont download anything else for runescape or fall for phishing so I should be fine then
---
Reimage, not a system restore, wipe everything out.
---
Seems fair enough xD
---
Those are the ge mid prices you’ll see if you search up an item. They are mostly accurate but since they are only updated every 4 hours sometimes they can be off. Use the ge tracker website to look up most accurate prices
---
"heh, better pick apart this joke to look cool on the internet"
---
pretty sure they're on Wednesdays just FYI, unless there's something special about today I'm unaware of
---
If you do IronDMM and want to keep early PvP you have to include permadeath, Its the only way
---
You can trade those golden trenches for pearls right?
---
It wouldn't stop clans. When you've got a big enough group it doesn't matter that you cant kill 20% of people.
---
Yeah, a lot of people here make fun of you if you have low stats or don’t play as efficiently as possible.
---
But not everyone is like that!
---
incremental games
---
What's that?
---
Vyrewatch Shoes &gt; Elven Forest Traps
---
So the first statement you made is based in almost no fact, and you’re just repeating things you see on the subreddit?
---
*shrug*
---
How can you say this matters though, when clans organize the same things, just with multiple people? That’s bullshit.
---
Oh yeah, I remember that 
---
This is assuming you have 449,428 xp which is the xp required to be level 65 in a skill.
---
2,673,114 - 449,428 = 2,223,686.
---
You need 2,223,686 more xp for 83 Construction. Assuming you continue using mounted mythical capes,
---
2,223,686 ÷ 370 = 6009.96 or 6010 rounded up. You will need to make 6010 more mounted capes for 83. 
---
Since each mount requires 3 Teak planks,
---
6010 × 3 = 18,030
---
You will need 18,030 Teak planks for all the mounts. Going by the current GE price listing for Teak planks of 850gp each,
---
18,030 × 850 = 15,325,500.
---
You will need 15,325,500 gp if you continue using mounted mythical capes and buy each plank at 850 gp.
---
&gt;ya'll
---
yikes
---
Literally every online game community has toxicity. This is one of the best I've seen
---
This is the best explanation yet 
---
go to RS3 if you want to rest.
---
Runescape suspiciously gets fucky when dmm is out. Its like theres this clan that is known for ddosing and jagex doesn’t do anything about it 
---
Can someone convert this to freedom hours? 
---
I remember having an issue where my connection would turn on and off all the time, maybe you should look into that?
---
Or maybe its the pc or laptop itself, try the runelite 32-bit client and check if that works because its less heavy on the pc..
---
Please remove 5 min logout timer. I'm not afk, I'm just recharging my stamina slowly.
---
also F2p player have energy pots now. 
---
True but sometimes I don’t know what it’s talking about since I don’t know the game so well, I even went to YouTube and other guides
---
It goes against the whole aspect of there being 1 winner. 1 solo winner to show how skilled they are not 1 guy being boosted and helped along the way by a clan. The fact people thinks this isn’t wrong baffles me. 
---
cause then they’d have to deal with the reality of
---
maintaining a game
---
Sure dude. Sue me.
---
Clans do the same things and nothing happens.
---
Stop constantly switching accounts. Its pathetic. 
---
You are right. You can't know without someone proving me right or wrong. But according to you that shouldn't happen or be encouraged because it is toxic and harassment. So that leaves you at perpetually trusting me with no basis.
---
They might not have a monopoly but boy are they a huge force, I'm already seeing certain things going up in price. Like I have been imps and as soon as they lose power the price has started to move upwards, if I sell one at mid price it sells for a decent bit over, if I increase a bit over the mid it still sells a decent bit over. It's the same thing that happened last time they lost power.
---
Weak bait
---
Even imposing ironman mode restrictions would not fix it. Clans would still camp important quest areas and resources to prevent anyone else from progressing.
---
Low key toxic? Have you seen any discussions about rs3&amp;osrs?
---
There's still trading by killing accounts. Maybe keys could be funneled into the ge upon death and the cash is given 
---
Post in a different subreddit then.
---
crash the market whenever they want
---
Screw you I was just about to make this same meme :( 
---
He wasn’t just using the acc as a mule and logging off, he was constantly playing on it and was going to use it to get pvp items later in the week, all he did was qualify two accounts and play them legit
---
Tf is pve?
---
If he had a keylogger, chances are they have access to his email too.
---
Still a mule if it goes out to PvM with 0 risk because it's hoarding valuable items in the protected bank for his main...
---
yes, and that is called exposition 'kiddo'
---
Isn't that a skyrim quote?
---
The others I’ve been don’t have people who talk shit
---
Honestly, unless jagex really did fuck up bad. I bet that torvesta was flipping on the ge (which is fine) and he was probably banking his loot onto his alt to sell at the ge to keep training (also fine) but the second that the loot sells and/or he buys something else with that money. 
---
He would have to (immediately) trade all that stuff back to his main so that if he dies he would be risking. I bet this is where they flagged him for muling. Sure he was trading and flipping. But the wealth probably spent tooooo much time on the alt. Its gotta go back to the main fast.
---
I've seen multiple people saying his mule account had all stats level 1?
---
Lol I’m not gonna stop posting...
---
And even if the mods make an edit and document their changes...there is still no way to know they made the change unless you went back and looked at that post.
---
If the post isn’t helpful, downvote and move on. Its not a big deal...
---
yeah thats all there is to it lol
---
“Problem”  
---
Not liking Settled is a problem instead of a personal preference nowadays.
---
I know people make fun of RS3 
---
nope, I stopped when Squeal came out
---
Who knows? Maybe he was the first and others will follow..
---
You could do it with less. Borderline necessary stats are 97+ magic, 90+ ranged and 75+ defence, 77+ prayer with rigour and augury. 90+ hp
---
Wasn't his mule account level 1 in all stats?
---
Protect from Range.
---
Will do
---
It’s not quite ‘textbook’ muling, he was playing on the alt and it was OK’d by a jmod. There is a grey area here.
---
Your solution is a band aid. We shouldn’t have to make a delegate email address just for our runescape account to be secure. How backwards is that??
---
This is a neat idea. Maybe they could add this into firemaking itself. Level 30 firemaking you get your first bench and someone can sit with you. Level 50 you can have multiple people sit with you, and as levels go up so does the regen on run energy.
---
Or just make levels increase run energy so people don't need 50 firemaking to sit around and socialize lol
---
Said the guy throwing a tantrum about memes
---
People talk shit in every single game that has a chat in it. Unless you're fresh off the boat from Club Penguin I don't know how this is a bad community
---
ye or just AFK redwoods for 70k xp/h and do other shit.
---
wait i found a tbow in the seed vault wtf
---
Dude put 2fa on your email 
---
So basically, per Jagex, cheating is tolerating as long as you are shady enough about it. 
---
uhh
---
The big problem here is that the rules around (1) what is considered playing the game and (2) what is considered a 'safezone alt' are poorly defined. It seems like Jagex just pick and choose however suits them, and no one knows if what they're doing is allowed or not. This is simply not acceptable in any sort of competitive game environment.  
---
Firstly, say I am part of a clan, and one of my clan members is our designated 'crafter', we trade cash to it and it sits in a safe zone training crafting and buying items. This is effectively muling, and pretty much every clan is doing this is some way, yet it isn't bannable because the player is actively playing the account by crafting. So why is training a skill considered 'playing the account' and not muling, but merching isn't? Is it therefore fine for me to trade to an alt if it sits in a safezone fletching arrows? How often do I have to gain experience before it is considered 'playing the account'?  
---
    
---
Second thing is what is considered a 'safesone alt'. If I take one step out of the safezone every hour and immediately walk back in, am I still a safezone alt? How often do I have to exit a safezone to no longer be considered a mule? What if I do something out of a safezone that is safe, like AFK splashing in single-way combat?
---
it's the inconsistency that's the problem. He's done that for the last couple tournaments and apparently a mod said that it was ok to flip on an alt. I agree that it shouldn't have ever been allowed, but it's not ok to go back and ban him for something that they obviously didn't have a problem with in the past.
---
Can I join as f2p or is this in a members world?
---
99 agility. Straight through . Nothing else. 
---
He's been told his account was completely acceptable. Meanwhile, clans have Skilling alts and alt accounts to lock down quest areas. Individual content creators get banned, but if rot wants to ddos someone during the 1v1s, there's no problem there! 
---
Surely you're not serious?
---
damn I should give it a shot, what did you do about the snakelings? I am worried about not having ring of suffering (I think thats what its called)
---
I don't think I agree with that, the RuneScape wiki is one of the best resources I've come across.  What specifically are you having an issue with that the wiki doesn't help with?
---
i have used it for my past 4 attempts. does the range hit higher or something?
---
"uh I’m broke I have no money"
---
"Honestly dude if I wanted your dfs I would have bought it already"
---
Bought it with what money, you just said you're broke. And of course he's gonna want some kind of insurance, it'd be foolish to just blindly hand over what is very likely a valuable item to the first person that responded.
---
Most retarded quest in the game, RNG on top of some bullshit maze
---
Yeah I only suggest restore if you don't have anything backed up but a reimage would be ideal. But it's impossible to know when the logger was installed
---
Question, do you know if a virus can avoid a system restore and stay on the system?
---
Shhhh people who parrot the same Reddit runescape memes over and over don't think logically or realistically
---
Just because it was reportedly okayed doesn't mean what he did wasnt muling. This is why he asked for approval so that he could mule without a ban, because it was 100 muling.
---
As much as I hate to see Torvesta DQ'd from the tourny it makes sense. He was taking wealth off of his main and giving it to an alt that he said was just going to be sitting in the GE. So instead of risking it on his account that is running around the world it's safely tucked away in the GE alts bank for flipping.
---
Big difference from Solo who has all 3 of his accounts out in the world killing things. Alts are fine, using an account to hold your wealth in a safe zone is not.
---
Just to point something out:
---
OP is using 3 accounts to reply in this thread lol. 
---
/u/ItCouldBeYourAccount
---
/u/BubbleGumBumBum
---
/u/-Eyan-
---
These are all the same person lol. 
---
so? a clan locking down a quest is use of ingame mechanics to prevent other players from finishing the quest, torvesta using a mule is a breach of the rules so he gets banned, i dont see a problem here?
---
This is a good suggestion. Sad it won’t be top due to all the drama posts...
---
DMM is a good investment, brings new viewers and new players. It sometimes hits number one on twitch. 
---
The problem is that they suck at organizing and setting rules. 
---
Weird post
---
What's that helmet?
---
WHy would a f2p player have 90mil riddle me this
---
You can't enforce rules based on that though. "I risk as much as others because I only transfer as many items to my alt as I have free slots in deposit box". Maybe that's true, but obviously you can't take that into account when enforcing rules.
---
Jagex is a British company, Britain is a Capitalist and SOCIALIST country. Also it might be helpful to note OSRS was not originally created to 'make money' exclusively. It was the runescape community that asked for old school to be released and in fact a completely different company all together released a 2007 scape version for the public before Jagex did, which was ultimately closed since Jagex's release. Nevertheless, it is not unheard of for businesses to take on criticism to change for the customers.
---
Giving an ultimatum such as don't like it don't buy it is also a very narrow minded action to take for an issue such as this. For most players, Jagex is part of their childhood and so quitting without putting in the effort to push change isn't the first option that comes to most minds.
---
In most professional situations a business would rather take note of an issue that would likely lose them money (in the long run) than to carry on and possibly run the risk of losing more customers or closing altogether as the very worst case scenario. 
---
Reddit has also become a great stage to give your views and opinions and Jagex has been known to occasionally respond to complaints/issues. It's a good idea to try and change or modify issues within the game if you're passionate about it, even though it may not be seen, you never know. 
---
Since the release of bonds, players don't actually have to pay any real life money to play this game either, so that's not a good comparison.
---
Tldr - calling someone a kid for believing something is ignorant and immature. No one is the same, you do you and they can do them :) 
---
🦀🦀 Jagex won't reply. 🦀🦀
---
Sorry OP.
---
Why would I say something that isn't true? Saying "cracker" doesn't mean I hate white people, for example.
---
I mean, happy stories rarely get popular in general. Its always the stories that are sad or extraordinary. 
---
That might help explain why negative posts gain traction and why they're so prevalent. People do what makes them feel happy, even if it means spreading negativity so they feel some purpose. 
---
This but make it his butt
---
Can you explain this further please? Efficiency to me would mean most kills per hour and for that you wouldn’t bring the notebook as it takes up a space going in that could be used for an additional potion/food/etc. 
---
Kinda like dark souls
---
Muling is definitely against the rules. What are you talking about?
---
No.
---
I just done the same hahahaha im an idiot too. forgot i turned that off lol 
---
I saw your comments from your last post and it looks like you got angry over things that weren't intended to be mean or negative at all.
---
A lot of people cry about and try to invalidate infernal capes just because you used an item in the game lol...
---
Not this. You clearly haven't watched his video explaining why he's turned the communty on Jagex, I always defend Jagex, this time i'm on Torvesta's side.
---
If you can't be fucked to watch the video, he basically points out how screwed solo players are because he can't have a side account while clanmates can feed people in their clan, and streamers can accept donos.
---
Whats worse, transferring money to a side account to flip with, or waiting until the last minute to have your clanmates trade you all your good gear?
---
They said it was 3-4 weeks away last week... hmmmm
---
What do you think he should do with the video? Take it down or keep it up? 
---
There are lots of people who get banned for muling.

This game didn’t exist in 2002. Go to runescape 3

---
They're silly looking ms paint characters. whats not to like?
---
Muling means that you store items on an account that isn't online, thus being literally unkillable. I can see why you'd think what he was doing as muling but he was still playin on the account (assuming he's telling the truth)
---
People are freaking out because not everyone considers what his alt was doing muling and because he had asked in the past if it was alright and was told that it was.
---
Didn’t know this, interesting
---
Just watch his video, that’s how we all know
---
Or maybe, just maybe, they're subscribed to Torvesta because of.... Torvesta. And not for DMM. 
---
Stop fucking projecting your own preferences on other people jesus christ are you thick
---
Wasnt me but not sure why ur so upset over one downvote
---
That's his point, dipshit
---
Apparently people support streamer/content creator favoritism now? 
---
That was last season, and it was wrong for a mod to say that muling was acceptable, because it isn't.
---
Either a mistake was made last season, a mistake was made this season, or the policy changed between now and then. Considering muling is against the rules, my bets are on the former.
---
Got fucked by roblox ffs
---
Interesting, I guess it's the difference between a targeted hack and just some mass malware or whatever. Got me reading on viruses that can create secret hard drive partitions to and persist even after a reimage which I pretty scary
---
Some of them are. Point is that you people need to stop thinking *everyone* is. 
---
That’s for people camping for a long time with range. Melee trips are short anyways so that cc isn’t useful for him
---
(Little did they know I have dclaws)
---
So if a mod says botting is okay even though the rules explicitly say botting isn't acceptable, people who get banned for botting should be unbanned?

tbh looking at rs3's new firemaking update i wonder how osrs fans would react to a better version of that.
---

---
Account locks aren't taken any more seriously than recoveries. People who get recovered are brainlets who either A) use some old ass email that is compromised with same passwords or B) have their whole online life readily available to be socially engineered. And C) they shared the account and the other guy knows info.
---
People just aren't careful with their personal info and account security. There's a reason people like me don't get recovered, we're careful and don't leak our info or share accounts.
---
Then the Jmod was wrong. The rules aren't determined by a single, random, unnamed Jmod. The rules are the rules, regardless of what a single mod thinks.
---

confused why you have soo many restores and soo little food, new meta or maxxed?
---
Yeah, I'm just expecting a clan would find a way to game the system.
---
His alt wasn't risking anything it had, though. That's muling. Stop denying reality.
---
That doesnt insinuate everyone, only a large amount of people. I mean are you just being pedantic or do legitimately think that the polls and narrative on this sub reddit doesnt represent a pretty accurate picture of how people feel...? Usually things like that paint a fairly good picture of how people feel, and of course there will be outliers.

Just feel like more positivity and helping others would benefit this sub better

did you have recovery questions set?

Knowing Jagex it's probably safer to wait 24 hours after release for the player to QA test it before throwing all your seeds in there.

He made it to 3k, time to update him. 
---
This is a good breakdown of the center of the problem. If torv had been using the acc to do an afk skill like crafting or fletching I wonder if he would be banned. Is it purely the fact that it’s one person playing two accounts that makes it bannable? Could I be torvesta’s mule and just sit at the ge making arrow shafts and holding all of his money for him under the pretext that I’m his fletcher and he’s supplying me with money to fletch? It doesn’t seem like it should matter if it’s two people or one, it’s still essentially muleing, why give clans an even bigger advantage just because they decided to play the mode the easier way? (no offense meant to clans, it’s just obvious how big of an advantage they have in this game mode)
---
Time to make a new new account
---
See 2 problems, one people could farm blood money with alts. Just getting blood money from pking would give almost no incentive to pk leading to everyone avoiding fighting which is boring.

Because I subbed to the osrs reddit to learn more about the game. Just with this post alone I learned about DMM, not to mention I wouldn’t have known about swampletics of it weren’t for this sub so
---
&gt;Feeding people in their clan isn't against the rules.
---
Which is exactly why solo players cannot compete
---
With the power of autism and runescape by my side anything’s possible 
---
You say they can't just let it go, but they did just let it go last tournament. He literally did the exact same thing and let it go. So obviously they are ok with letting it go when they feel like it. That's my problem. I'm trying to be constructive by saying that's not ok. If they did it the first time it was done, then I would be all with you and I refuse to believe they didn't notice it the first time. 
---
Put the banning in any other context and it's easy to see why it's not justified. Say you've got a golfer who found this new club, but it might be against the rules, so he asks a tournament organizer if it's ok because you're unsure. He says yeah that's fine and then of course he goes on his way and uses it. Then all of a sudden half way through the tournament he comes back, says wait that's against the rules and kicks him out. Is that alright? That's my problem. Even if he broke the rules, you can't come back 4 months later and say wait a second never mind, you're banned.
---
DMM has about a million problems and IMO can't be fixed. An ironman DMM wouldn't work because either pking would be worthless as you get no drops, or you still get all they're stuff in which case nothing changes. You can't just remove clans from the game. How do you enforce that? Clans will just find some other way around the rules, and since Jagex enforces the rules about a quarter of the time, who knows what's ok and what's not. Muling isn't ok but when a clan funnels all they're gear on their strongest players that's fine? There's no consistency, just enforcing the rules when they feel like it.
---
Do you want the main game to be changed because a minority (ironmen) want it changed?
---
Then why should a minority of tournament players (solo players) dictate changes?
---
Contradictive.
---
The tournament should, and will, be changed based on the people who actually play it.
---
If you don't like it, just play the seasonal and don't qualify?
---
Do people go to a basketball tournament and complain that they want to play 1v1s? No. They know the tournament is for teams. So they wont go into it wanting 1v1s.
---
That logic makes no sense.

I’m not projecting torvesta mentions his fans loving dmm in several of his videos. Stop thinking you’re smart because you’re being a contrarian. I’m done with you but turning your brain on once in a while might help your life
---
Nah man just keep seeing your name followed by 1 word replys trying to be serene or summat just fk off with it

Quest cape
---
Dude I know, I have done like 15 master clues and haven't gotten a 3rd age item yet. Like wtf
---
Not interesting to whom? The guy's original point is that it's the solo pvp players that bring most of the eyes to dmm. 
---
It was drawn in 2003, definitely not the first time it’s been used in this format. Are you on top of yours?
---
His alt is level 1 in every single stat except for 10 hp and 3 herblore dude, it was a mule 100%
---
Dude. Ur thread has 20+ comments, like 15 posts helping you, and 1 troll post which was a reply to ur toxic post. When somene tells one to kill yourself, people dont generally tell that person he is rude and how he should better himself. They usually attack back or laugh it off. Ur expectations are unreal irl or online.

yes 911 someone is about to get murdered right here
---
make me then lil bitch
---
Whooooo, meme battle, now!!!
---
Yes he is, and he asked jagex if that was allowed and they said yes.
---
Every content creator does the same thing.  Its mimicking the "clan meta" where clans have members who are assigned to farm gold and items while the main account does nothing but train stats.  Then all the resources get traded to the main account so it has items and stats but didnt waste any time from training to get the items.
---
Did you not read my last comment I linked you? Playing 2 accounts is fine as long as you’re not transferring your wealth off to the account that’s hiding in a safe zone the entire time. Which he did. He mislead the mod of what he was actually doing unless you have evidence of what he actually said to the mod. 
---
I swear this exact "unpopular opinion" has been said like 50 times today.
---
The reason people are mad is because clans always venture into that same gray area and nothing happens. Punishment needs to be the same across the board.
---
There are zero p2p quests like that.
---
Check your account security so you don't get rehacked
---
Then ya you can do raids one, people drastically over estimate the stats you need, I’m about to start doing them on my pure
---
Nice. How many people are usually recommended for R1? Assuming they are roughly around same stats etc
---

I see why the J Mods banned Torv, he was obviously muling which is against the rules, and he knew better. This had nothing to do with the number of accounts he had, as everything to do with the way he was using them.
---
The problem here is that a lot of other players are doing the same thing, and as of yet, no action seems to be being taken against them. It's not an issue that they banned him, it's an issue that they appear to be applying the ban *inconsistently*.
---
Sure, probably. I have no idea, but it's just very typical this game and sub - that's all I meant.
---
Often this sub gets overrun by circlejerking as soon as something happens. From my point of view as starting up again it can become frustrating since it makes it hard to get back into the game and what's new. 
---
Oh okay that makes sense that it’s not allowed then. But yeah it sounds like there’s bigger issues with this server than one guy muling but I guess at least it’s something
---
I'm not sure lmao
---
I wouldnt know about it without the Futurama episode
---
What he said in his video was last tournament he was doing the exact same thing with his alt and asked a jmod to look into his account see what he was doing was bannable and they said no because he's still playing on the account. I agree that if he was depositing money on his ACC and logging off for the day but he was actively flipping while playing on his main. Maybe he asked them after he was done flipping and starting to train it or maybe it was before. Seems like a grey area that I can't start REEing about until jagex comments.
---
Nature talisman is 1/9k
---
JaGeX should have never moved on to using email addressed for logging in to RuneScape in the first place then.
---
A username is much shorter to write than email anyways, and doesn't run the same security issues.
---
Using the same password but different login/username is much easier than the other way around.
---
The question is, why is JaGeX customer support so incompetent?
---
Love the vids man. Saw this one last night!
---
I mean to be fair its reddit.. everything on reddit is a witch hunt. If you want OSRS team offically releases update notes after every update explaining everything new thatvis added, its worth a look if thatsbwhat youre after.
---
There's a cool [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJBpkz29-DQ) on this guy and how he makes his blowpipes. This gif isn't in the video, but I recognize that haircut anywhere.
---
Yes.
---
Sacred makes me about 270k/hr while afk with the same stats. No idea what infernal gets you but I’ve never seen any other sites have anywhere close to 270k/hr.
---
No, it's using a new condom each time you have sex.

---
They can make changes when it's inconvenient for them if they don't.
---
I'm not going to bother replying to someone that wants to be offended by the community being correct in their outrage. If you want to sit here and not read all the facts or watch his video with the proof, that's on you. 
---
Muling should be allowed, everyone does it anyways in some form.
---
You could AFK cannonballs pretty easily on this account 
---
Mhmm, do you see me complaining about not getting a b ring?
---
So you think it's  a good idea to take something that requires effort (juggling) qnd replace it with the same reward that requires no effort and no extra cost? That's just buffing something that doesn't need to be buffed.
---
There's so so many ways, have you done any of the RS3 bosses?
---
I sadly found only really jpeg images like this one
---
Muling is not simply "trading between two accounts owned by the same player".  It is, specifically, "trading large amounts of wealth or valuable items *obtained on a Main account* to an inactive account in order to keep them safe".  Muling is a good rule as it stops people from cheating the game mode by, essentially, risking nothing on their main while they level it up and progress.  This is NOT what Torvesta and other content creators did and/or have been doing for the past few DMM tourneys.
---
Having another account whose purpose is to generate gold/items and funnel them to a main is not only NOT muling, but allowed by Jagex.  Torv specifically asked about this a few DMMs ago.  Its what every content creator does (Mika, Solo mission, etc) as well as how every single DMM clan is structured (there is a "main" account that gets all the resources funnelled to it from the others).
---
If Torv was continually trading all the wealth/items *that he earned on his main* to his alt account AND kept that alt account in safe areas/logged out exclusively - then that would be muling.  But, according to the info we have so far, that's not what he was doing. 
---
Earning money on a second account and funnelling it to a "main" is not and never has been muling.  Literally every single DMM competitor does this to mimic the "clan meta"
---
But his alt did/does leave the safe zone 
---
Better art than Mona Lisa.
---
Try navigating through their confusing support website and hopefully find what you're looking for and submit a ticket. When I've had issues it's been resolved within a day or two every time
---
Yeah, not when you have to run somewhere that takes more than 100% energy lol 
---
A lot of media that became memes were created much earlier than when they were popularized
---
Ik it's a meme but check out ditterbitters vids, one of the only youtuber that is pking this tourny
---
How??? If you are trying to win the 32k prize. Killing someone early is 2000 -1 players who can win
---
r/brainlet.
---
They definitely should make it so an account can't be logged in for more than 16 hours a day
---
So if someone and their friend were playing the tournament together and one sat at the ge and merched the entire time and then transferred all their newly obtained items to back to their friend would that be against the rules? Because that’s what clans do the entire time so there shouldn’t be a problem with someone doing that just on an alt. Also as I said in my last comment in torvestas video he said he was going into the wilderness on his alt to get pvp weapons after buying everything he needed from the ge therefore the items on the alt account are not any safer than on his original account so he’s not breaking any rules
---
Oh we snitching now, boys.
---
A rock and a hard place is a.common english idiom. Even Simpsons had a joke with it 
---
Do the 2 factor authentication part too, it's really easy and you only need to login with the authentication every 30 days on devices you trust, so it's not inconvenient. I set mine up recently on my email and account, and it was super easy. 
---
ayeee OP you from MI?

If they ever get the code working for Team Ironman and true clans, this wouldn't definitely be possible. That was something they expressed interest in in the past.
---
We get that dude, thats why he does it is to save time.   
---
Clans do it to, they just have actual players they dedicate to doing the merching for them. But to start they quickly go and get some free levels before starting
---
Really? Maybe it was just my area then, no one at my school/cousins/people I knew played past 2007 and only a few played past 2006. Among the folks I knew it peaked 2005-2006 but maybe that was atypical. Everyone moved on to wow/cod. 
---
I love this and turbo charge rng
---
Mmmm, I don't know about that one to be honest, I'm an f2p player on my pure (have never funded my p2p main with it and actually, the other way around most of the time) and 590gp per is actually pretty cheap considering that that's basically just a bit over 2 swordies; people eat that like nothing in pking!
---
So urs dad but I watch him
---
Ur a genius bro. Must be fun at party’s
---
Could suicide to your mates to give items.
---
Torvesta said in his video he planned to take the account out of the safe zones after he had merched barrows so that he could get PvP weapons and double his odds... 
---
Some of those are good (mostly the ones stolen from here and 4chan) but God damn, a lot of those were drawn by actual brainlets lmfao 
---
You're probably right, and not just new people. It attracts ex-players to revisit the game too, even if they don't end up playing DMM.
---
Actually hilarious
---
dude that’s the definition of muling lmao
---
Boy, do I got some good news for you.
---
It makes it no different if before you leave you transfer funds onto your main.. then do the farm runs and transfer it back..
---
Hahaha it's just funny to be subscribed to. Going through your feed with the occasional brainlet passing through.
---
ctrl+c + ctrl+v = easy karma
---
I remember watching your fire cape streams too. :) 
---
He literally transfers money onto his mule. It doesn’t matter if hes flipping on it or anything like that. What matters is that he loses less gp when he dies because his alt is holding shit for him
---
u/OneColdBeer you should append this to the list. It's extremely important to use a unique password for OSRS not used for any other account
---
No reason to watch dmm for me now. Btw pro tip jagex, if u want dmm to succeed thenstop letting clans dominate,make dmm ironman pvm only. No items from player kills. G.e doesnt work. All quests done. and lastly u can only pick items at the final tournament stage. Of course the excuse not to will be "spaghetti code" Clan bullshit has to end, if it was solo only there would be like 50 time more people attempting it. I would be and i never even tried dmm once.
---
I'm not sure how you have a PVP mode that doesn't reward PVP.
---
Do people still say that?
---
The torvesta vids got me hyped, and ready to watch other content and follow the tournament. But now that hes gone I'm not really looking for other dmm content tbh. I will probably fast forward the twitch vod of the tournament and watch the last fight or so and be done with it. Probably not though I dont really care enough.
---
Train them
---
&gt; If you were a jmod seeing a player transferring wealth to an alt which never left a safe zone then carrying on doing his risky activities on the other account, what exactly are you to take from that?
---
Downvoting me because you can’t argue my point is beyond petty. Feel free to respond to this. 
---
cause every opinion of every JMod is Jagex law now, even when it goes against the written rules on Jagex's website? Don't delude yourself m8.
---
Those were stressful but really fun haha
---
/r/BrandNewSentence 
---
No muling is putting items onto an account and logging out to keep them safe which isn’t what he did for a fact. The main issue here is the fact that jagex’s rules aren’t clear and they have a double standard. It’s either all okay or none of it is okay. Torvesta was doing the exact same thing that every clan does therefore either he shouldn’t be banned or everyone that does it should be banned. 
---
Well at least I'm not rehashing stupid jokes from ages ago that weren't even funny back then

---
Hey I really love this and want to make one myself. Could you point me in the right direction? I don't have any experience but I'm willing to learn
---
What about if trading player to player was not possible, but GE still worked. then his idea might work. If loot dropped as cash, you could buy items on GE with the cash.
---
Would make it so self obtained items have more value, and would be much harder to give wealth over to a single account. There is probably something I'm missing, but sounds like it could work maybe
---
Torvesta got banned for MULING using 2 accounts. Having alts is allowed, muling is not
---
You attached a player who wasn’t attacking you. Easy
---
I honestly thought this was how DMM worked.
---
I came here to comment this exact thing, smh
---
I was just mending I didn't think the rate was really 1/3 by the time you were 99
---
Just ban DMM
---
Not good enough &gt;.&lt; need more 
---
As opposed to the current thrilling meta of “I’m going to train at the top tier spot and have my clan of 50 pick off anyone who dares even try to play PvP in a PvP game mode”
---
Yeah it's gotten to the point where people already know the most efficient way to max the character. It'd be far more interesting cutting all that out, having qualifiers instead be PvP, and go from there. 
---
99 slayer
---
He ice barraged me 20 sec earlier, then i spear him once without getting skulled and immediately i do it again and it skulls me.
---
One method is to get to 55 (superheat ores, splash, or regular combat I guess) and then high alch. Depending on what you alch you can even make a little bit of profit, and you can do it while training agility
---
Ok my clan will be locking down the knight's sword so if you want 1-31 smithing, 🖕

I think that's the real point if this post lol

I came HERE to comment THIS exact thing, smh
---
So muling is okay if it's 5 people feeding 1 strong account, rather than 1 person with 2 accounts?
---
Make sure you did your last elite. My buddy complained about being 65 dry only to realize he still had his last elite in bank.
---
They have already tried the ironman idea and it sucked
---
Bro I am so sorry, pet odds are stupidly ridiculous sometimes.
---
trust me I want to hop on the free trovesta train too but it’s obvious he broke rules. 
---
“Not leaving the safe zone” is effectively the same exact thing as “logging out”. Both things keep all your items safe. It’s pretty obviously against the rules. 
---
Nice try ditterbitter.

I mean it's not like you get chinchompas back after throwing them.

Wouldn't matter though.

I can tb and stop attacking, then my friend can attack.

Or if the person I tb fights back, either I kill them or they kill me then get rushed by my friend.
---
Who the fuck memorizes their time zone?
---
U?
---
cant compete with teams teaming together in a PKING game mode so crying on reddit LUL
---
And i'm no saying that Clans should be able to mule. Torvesta's ban was as per the rules, which is fair.
---
If Jagex finds that a clan is muling, ban the mule, and those who gave it wealth to hold on to as well. If they made youtube videos about muling, it would be wasier to find.
---
They can't ignore a content creator blatantly breaking the rules because he has a bunch of crybaby fans that throw a hissy ft.
---
Just need Jagex to listen to suggestions like yours so they might be able to come up with something similar. 
---
If there were PJ timers that would work great, but singles PvP zones are full of 2-3 person ice barraging PK groups who team up so they can each spec you while you’re frozen.
---
True. Would need to lower draynor req to 1 though
---
Most of the popular singles areas are camped by singles teams which tb you then swap off. Its a much worse problem recently too, basically every fight you have someone work you and get your supplies down then their team logs in with full invent and tags off on you.
---
I keep everything very far separated. The email is not the same.
---
I get where you’re coming from but it’s honestly for our own good. Bank pin is the last line of defense. 
---
In all seriousness, I would create a new account, watch a how to f2p tutorial(on youtube) on how to make enough money for your first bond. You will have your bond in 1-3 days and be on a fast track to hit the members worlds running.
---
I'm all in for some good banter but if they're all spamming the worst slurs you can come up with/ wishing death upon their families that is pretty disgusting to me.
---
I found the guy that has never participated in PvP in his RS career. 
---
Make DMM a true solo campaign: no trading. 
---
To compensate: improved xp in non-combat skills, and perhaps a slightly longer tournament.
---
It seems as if we've hit rock-bottom. This shit is literally not even fun anymore. I remember the good old days when people used to complain about the removal of trading and wildy. Now we're complaining a youtuber getting banned for some obscure shit which probably shouldn't even be allowed in the first place.
---
Sounds like you have a problem tanking then. If you see someone doing that then say fuck them and tp out.  If they have a tber then I understand otherwise it's pretty easy to 1v1 at each.  
---
Honestly, assuming he actually did ask jmods if what he was doing was on the up and up, he shouldn't be banned but his alt should be with a message stating so. Basically a warning because he directly asked and didn't try to hide anything.
---
Mod Ash responded to 800 customer support tweets in addition to doing his actual job on the day of the twisted bow rollback. I think people underestimate how much ONE extra dude working full time to do exactly the kind of stuff Ash does in his spare time would help the company. 
---
Ultimately we'd need a few more than one guy, but just one more guy effectively prioritizing support tickets would make a world of difference.
---
Is it esc
---
I'm sorry too guys :'(
---
Thanks a lot! Will definitely add you, warning though, you.might receive a lot of questions 
---
Yea I’ve got 9 whips from sire and I’ve never killed it
---
it has 3000+ upvotes thoe
---
Sounds like you might need to make a few friends than. 
---
I don’t think woox is a fair comparison to the tons of low level pures with 1 def fire capes?
---
The problem isn’t teams in multi areas, its teams in singles areas. You’ll be in a fight, get tb’d and your supplies drained, then the rest of their team logs in and they tag off on you in singles.
---
The main problem is that the rules aren’t clear though.  If torvesta had a friend doing the same exact thing for him at the ge and then going to get pvp weapons and what not neither one of them would have been banned. 
---
What I’m saying though if both his main account and his alt account went out of the safe zone to do risky stuff like training and getting pvp weapons the wealth on either account isn’t safe so he wasn’t muling. His alt account could have been killed at any time while he was out in the wildy with it.
---
Virus scan your PC to make sure keyloggers aren't on it
---
Link a second email to your account
---
Authenticator etc
---
Make sure your password hasn't remained the same for a long period of time, more susceptible to leaks, so change it occasionally etc
---
Uh, I'm guessing you haven't seen what an area being locked down by a clan looks like. If you have enough friends to take that on be my fucking guest buddy 
---
Straight forward and to the point, haha
---
My herb and seaweed yield have been great as of late. You also have to factor in farming level and dairies. :) 
---
Well, i'll assume that this interaction between me and him is a lesson that i will never know what other people think and i should try to say less to people, who i do not know well enough. 
---
He admitted to doing it. That has nothing to do with anything whether it was an automated system or a jmod manually banning him. You have yet to answer my question. 
---
Runescape just adds a delay after you fighting someone.. Then you can easily loot and get away. Which if a clan is on you makes it beneficial to fight one member in the clan
---
Seems like a sticky situation for jagex 
---
I love how "Hide pool results" crab/lobsta is hiding :D
---
Nah, agility, for the amount of mental gymnastics required to call him completely innocent  
---
DMM in a nutshell
---
Run with a clan not having to have any actual PvP skills, feeding the top clan members who will get in to the 1v1s, wherein clans no longer matter unless you get paired up with a clan mate and then it's just a matter of who throws for who.
---
Damn I was hoping you knew something I didn’t

Seeds are not an issue at all with the farming guild seed generator.

Why would you buy dragon bones when they’re at their most expensive?

Some of them, their values are just dropping due to market. See Rapier prices. Sucks if you bought in at high value. Correction mode would be seen as rapid artificial inflation.

I just liked the positivity of the video, so much negativity in on reddit atm.

If you send in a recover form you can use any mail to send the mail to. Bypassing the 2nd mail.
---
What youre looking for has nothing to do with the client. You can find it in the game settings
---
Haha go read the thread again. You guys got tricked by the OP. Dude was lying out his ass and jmod gave him a 2nd smackdown. 
---
Seriously, never believe these posts claiming to be hacked out of nowhere and it's not their own fault.
---
The phone is on charge 4hed
---
No trading but allowing the Ge could work in theory. Not entirely sure what downsides there could be exactly though
---
How do we obtain it?
---
look at the rules section, they changed it 
---
however using an infernal cape account would fall into a category that would be in a grey area that should probably get you banned
---
Oh yeah, good call. I’m not the most well versed in it myself
---
If he's a virgin at this point it's partially your fault, no?
---
30k definitely isn't a lot with revenue like Jagex's, but it's unquestionable that having an **individual player** win $10k every season would be much more exciting than watching RoT split $10k between 200 people for a total of less than minimum wage for the fourteenth season in a row.
---
&gt;Even if they had the login, password, email, and email password; would any potential hacker still not need access to OP's phone? (Assuming he has 2FA on his registered email account)
---
Correct. Even getting keylogged isn't enough if you use everything available to you. 
---
&gt;If you have authenticator on your account, and 2FA on your registered email, how does one get hacked anyways?
---
You don't get hacked in a conventional sense. You can still get recovered but that is a 100% separate issue that is always your own fault. You cannot get randomly fucked by database leaks if you use auth on account and email. Literally impossible. 
---
Looks sick
---
I have plenty people to pk with, but if I had the option I’d much rather solo pk. I think it’s more fun solo pking, any team with three people can pile on a solo pker and get kills. Personally I don’t find that massively fun. I prefer to get a good 1v1 and actually just fight someone.
---
tangleroot
---
Buy high and sell low, duh.
---
??? 
---
If you’re on a pure and getting 3v1 at 60-70 combat bracket, it’s a little difficult to tank 3 separate specs, a tb, and ice barrage my dude. It has nothing to do with me having a problem, getting smited by 3 separate players makes it impossible to keep prot prayers up. The best you can hope for is to restore and get enough prayer for protect item.
---
Luckily got out of rapiers at 200.Hopefully the rest of these items which remain useful rebound soon, pretty depressing to see your bank lose 10-15% in few weeks
---
No i didn't see that
---
Tanglefoot is the boss of Fairy Tale pt I, Tangleroot is the pet.
---
Then your best bet is to try pvp, edge, or single strip.  If you fight a solo at alter and a team shows up start making your way south or ne to box and log/tp/get in kbd.
---
Do slayer, also I'll DM you a good method that you can do at your level.
---
Can't post links on this sub. DM me and I'll show you how you can order any custom sticker online, and give you the image file for the graphic.

Try pking at revs, so many empty worlds

That's the underground pass
---
"Stop being dumb guys..."
---
Kinda the biggest advice you could really dish out for most of these people. 
---
Their posts always start with "I didn't do anything I'm super secure blah blah blah..", then afterwards it comes out that they did exactly the kind of stupid shit that will ALMOST ALWAYS lead to your account getting wrecked.
---
part of the issue is that it's hard to convey tone via text, something totally innocent that you mean as a joke can be completely misread because of the inability to reflect how you're saying it
---
it's likely that this guy was just an asshole, you shouldn't worry too much about saying less or more at the end of the day the worst that can happen is one of you has to block the other, it's a videogame not real life
---
&gt; The only reason to be mad about torvesta being dqed is if others are getting off for it.
---
I never once paid attention to DDM, just the ensuing drama after every single one of them, but I thought that *was* why everyone is mad.
---
This sounds like the time to implement that shared bank ironman mode and put it in dmm. With suiciding into someone to give them loot being bannable. 
---
Clans can still put their best man forward, but because he shares a bank with some other members, pking one is the same as pking the mules. 
---
Yeah, I understand the keylogging issue, but much of the player base consists of people who have been playing for years who are familiar with keylogging and shady websites. I do think many of these players would value this update, but, yeah, maybe the the costs do outweigh the benefits. 
---
The fuck are you even arguing at this point? I never said everyone thinks it’s unfair 
---
So what you're saying is they're pushing it up by not doing/rushing QA? sounds smart given recent events 
---
42 defence? Might want to work on that...
---
Lmao if something's wrong irl don't take your frustration out here. There are better more therapeutic ways to deal with anger
---
You're joking right? You think having actual security by making good decisions is a bandaid and authenticator delay which *literally only does anything if you have already been hacked* is a good and permanent solution?? Do you not see how clearly backwards that is? 
---
Personal responsibility will always be part of account security. Nobody can retard-proof it for you. If you insist on being as bad as possible at keeping your account secure you will always, always find a way to get hacked. You don't technically even need a separate email for rs, you just can't use the same email/password combo anywhere else. This is more difficult imo than just making a separate email though, so that's what I recommend. 
---
Its not about tanking, I can tank just fine, the point is that I and a lot of other players just prefer solo pking. So when you pk for a couple hours in deep wild, find like 3 fights in that amount of time and every one of them is teaming, then it gets dull and is damaging the pvp community.
---
I did
---
What was the comment?
---
That's why I couldn't find it. Thank you! 
---
Don’t worry everyone we can still watch solo mission, and he has 2 alts!

Hell I'd say no GE either.

Maybe add in-game shops with rare items that cost a lot or add them into the bounty shop.

No 2FA. Nothing to see here. Close thread.

Okay, it's very clear that you're not understanding the problem. People are losing their accounts through account recovery...the "hackers" don't even need access to someone's email address with this method. 
---
A unique email, a unique password, a unique password and email combination - yes, great things, but when you don't need ANY of that to recover a runescape account that isn't yours, how does that help?

I wanted to be an ironman obby so I could range forever. My main is a 99 str obby and you can't pass 67 range or you get combat levels. Ya I would love criticism so I can improve thanks.
---
I go rev cave entrance, chins, and 44s, if ur talking nh fights, yes it takes at least 10-15 minutes to find one on average, never said 20-30 minutes. 
---
Well most people that learn raids invest a huge number of hours grinding it compared to something like cerberus or zulrah. Its also end game pvm so most people that can raid will just stick to it until some new content thats more challenging is released. Same with inferno
---
I'm not misdefining anything.
---
"**Muling, which can be defined as:** using a separate account to store wealth. This includes clan banks. Alternate accounts are permitted provided they are used competitively. Players found to be muling will be banned (including clan banks, and those who use them)."
---

---
Torvesta's alt was not used competitively. Nice try, buddy.
---
The only rule they break is rwt. Since it's an actual person running the account it's very negligible compared to mass not farms. There impact on the economy is small, but the impact on their real life is huge.

I think the RS community should be happy enough to take a hit to essentially help impoverished people.

alright mate, enjoy HCIM episode 124

Probably because everyone at the party also knows the phrase
---
because you made him leave the house to go to some lame club
---
&gt; The insane thing about the torvesta situation is that he asked a jmod if it is ok, got the answer yes its ok, then gets banned.
---
That was last season though, where he actually trained the acc up, this time it sat at the ge as a lvl 3, with 32 total, the entire time.
---
He's the only one who actually pks in his though. Everyone else just releases stat highlights/ item drops.
---

Yeah, all it takes is lingering one or two seconds on the confirmation screen to notice something weird and decline the trade. Rip your friend.
---
No, it's very clear that *you* are not understanding the problem. I agree that your account can be recovered through any layers of security currently available. Did you read the post above at all?? His account was very clearly not recovered! It was wiped of its auth and password with email access! This guy is at fault!
---
I agree that overhauling the recovery system is an actual, non-retarded step towards changing account security. Auth delay, however, is 100% completely retarded as it only does anything if you have already been hacked. We have not been arguing about recovery and you fucking know it, you just decided to change the conversation to recovery because it was convenient for your narrative.  We have been arguing about email security and that's the problem in this post. 
---
Is there any way to get one as an iron man?
---
Jokes on you. Lad is getting xp, what are you doing?
---
Agreed. PvP is in a pretty bad state at the moment. That doesn't mean Torvesta didn't deserve the DQ he got.

I like the idea and I like the fact you have a face cam and the energy you’re rockin when you get a kill but maybe chill a bit on the over played enthusiasm. I feel like every streamer and YouTuber does that yelling “LETS GO BOYS” shit and it’s overplayed. I feel like you just kicked back relaxed and did some sweet off the wall content you would be more successful. Haven’t seen too many Ironman pkers but I really haven’t looked for it so I think your content is there. Good luck bud I enjoyed the vid.
---
I guess it was the wrong place wrong time. i'd love to give it a try some time in the future after my goals.
---
Fuck you.
---
You haven’t seen league... I think league is way worse especially bronze and silver ranks 
---
&gt; I mean - if one account is just generating and storing money for another account, isn’t that basically muling? 
---
By my own definition, I guess so!  
---
They probably rather spend their time training/giving the tools to someone with a little bit more ambition than someone willing to do it for free slowly when they have time.

The solo battle Royale mode doesn't reward its winner thousands of dollars, nice strawman though.
---
Thats just how the choose to pk :P
---
Nope, nope, far too real. Gonna need the brain bleach for this one.
---
The problem with making everyone in DMM an Ironman is that you couldn't get items from anyone you kill, making it rather pointless as a PvP gamemode.
---
&gt; wait til you hear how the damage is also RNG based 
---
That's exactly why I don't PvP in OSRS, actually.
---
Would be good to set up a test DMM world for this. I'd play it, at least.
---
Big argument is there should have been a warning instead of an insta ban. 
---
Mostly because a jmod said it was okay
---
I think one of the biggest problems with this is that he wasn't clear in the video what he did.... Partly because he probably knows he is in the wrong. If he was just flipping on that alt and he got all of that "seed" money from his main, it was 100% muling. If he was just using the alt to get stuff for his main, that wouldn't have been an issue. But as soon as you start trading items from your main to your alt is when things change.
---
My hope is that they found some way to detect low effort muling instead of just trying to make an example out of a popular content creator.
---

---
I mean, I also don't stream because no one will watch me, but yeah, this also can a reason.

I do not remember the XP rates but I did use this personally to get to 70 and it wasn't bad at all.
---
Honestly just go walk off a cliff. 30k kc with only 1 muta
---
Why thing
---
ohh cool cool thanks
---
So hes not transferring wealth and items at all? Nor merching? or using the extra deposit boxes to store more items?
---
&gt;Yes??
---
The correct answer is "no." Botting isn't okay just because a single mod says it is. If it's against the rules, it's against the rules, regardless of what any individual JMod says about the matter.
---
Do you have bank pin / 2FA on your account?
---
Awesome :) thanks so much for the feedback, I will try to tone it down. I have ADHD so I have always been hyper like I do the yelling and getting excited off stream in everything, but I will try to tone it down.

---
Yea it's just not going to work. if you put just no trading in then people can just suicide to mule, if you make it ironman then no1 will pk. Basically they should just remove bank keys since muling is always going to happen and is too hard to regulate. 
---
At least from their piss poor efforts it seems to be too hard.

---
Jagex holds the rights to dq anyone if they are teamed up or not..
---
Yeah I agree with you on that, thats why I was wondering why certain items like ancestral,dex, and others went down 5-10% when they have been relatively stable
---
I don't know, but it doesn't really matter. The rule simply says "using a separate account to store wealth." The minimum amount of wealth is not specified.
---
From my understanding, he was using the account to flip items on the GE, so he must've had a substantial amount of wealth to be able to do that. I don't think he meant he was flipping vials of water.

---
Well to be fair, most of the sub acts like 12 year olds so I can see why you thought this would be believable 
---
You're correct about training them separately giving more xp over two hours, but you're incorrect about the EHP being higher for separate training.
---
Consider this math:
---
* 2 hours of separate training (1 hour of hunting &amp; 1 hour of fishing) = 110k fishing &amp; 240k hunter = 350k total xp
---
* 2 hours of Aerial fishing = 150k fishing xp &amp; 190K hunter xp = 340k total xp
---
As you can see aerial fishing results in 10k less overall xp in 2 hours, but you're getting 40k more xp in the significantly slower skill. This is what makes aerial fishing higher EHP despite being lower overall xp in 2 hours; you're effectively trading 50k xp in a skill that maxes at 240k/hr (12.5 minutes of training at max rate) for 40k in a skill that maxes at 110k/hr (21 minutes of training).
---
Agreed
---
There is a pin to log in, it's called your password. If they can get your password they can get your pin as well 
---
and just like he said, this is not one of them
---
Right?
---
Torvesta, “Muling is when you transfer funds between accounts” -mules gear- “I’m not breaking the core rules!”
---
* Stay away from this shitty sub if you want to enjoy the game
---
Mmmmm I'm gonna call BS that your f2p pure funds your p2p main most of the time, unless your main is like 300 total level and even then.
---
to keep you in
---
Would be a shame if someone killed your bird. 
---
eh i think the general sentiment is less that hes "completely innocent" and more that the clan man mode format is uninteresting af to watch and it seems unfair that clans can do what he was doing on a much more drastic level and not get banned. 
---
Hahaha. A riot to protest someone being banned for breaking rules. Sounds legit.
---
LMAO 
---
I agree that it’s bologna that they singled out the #1 YouTuber. But, sometimes you have to make an example of a single rule breaker to deter others. I think that, if Jagex doesn’t release a statement before the finals, they’re going to have a shitstorm on their hands. It’s already been too long without word from Jagex’s side.
---
Remember the gnome copters?
---
If you give someone that information they could use it to scour the web for your other online profiles which may have information though.
---
I do agree that if you are an absolute ghost on the internet and someone had your login details they couldn't get in if the rest was secure. But most of us grew up on the internet and there's a lot out there
---
Reverse this image.
---
"Am I out of touch?"
---
"No, it's the rules that are wrong!"
---
Fair enough I can agree to everything except locking down spots, why would that be breaking the rules? Teaming up to hold territory is more like strategy. 
---
All those other things you said are cheating, yes.
---
I disagree with the premise that he even broke the rule. I don't think that what he did can be defined as muling because he put the items at risk at times, and did a variety of other activities on it as well. Not like he just sat there and hoarded the money.
---
same
---
I want to believe this
---
So the only thing left out of this is that his alt never left safe zones and THATS the reason he got banned. He asked if it was ok to have an alt and jagflex said yes, but he didn't specify that his alt would never go into a dangerous zone ever. And that's the reason he got banned because it was called a "mule" not an alt. NOW I'm not saying a ton of people weren't doing this I'm sure they were and because he's a big name it was easy for them to see he was doing it so he got dq. But technically he didn't just have an alt because his alt would have left safe zones to try to do non buyable skills, which it never did which is why it was a mule not an alt and therefore against the rules. 
---
That’s true. They need to do serious work in fixing DMM like they said they were going to do. 3 months of work to remove Ring of Sufferings like the 1v1’s are the problem is absurd.
---
Tell me, what is the point of any runescape account? 
---
Let me explain this to you very clearly.
---
&gt; he needs to trade &amp; merch on it while he levels other account.
---
&gt; Muling is hiding wealth ~ exploiting tournament rules.
---
Do you know what standing in a safe-zone, unable to be attacked, unable to lose your wealth is? It's hiding wealth. You said it yourself. He is moving his wealth to an account that is ALWAYS safe. That is literally the definition of muling.
---
Yeah and its not like everything is cheap comparatively. Youre iphone will still be over $1000, just the home made bread will be pennies
---
10% is nothing compared to the advantage of having clan mates 
---
yikes discord trannies
---
I agree. They need to actually enforce sweeping DQ’s instead of singling out the biggest YouTuber for rule breaking. If you break a rule, you should DQ’d. No exceptions. 
---
Maybe this would be a better place for the agility course 
---
nice gloves
---
Did you have to download something to do that or are they online these days? Did you reuse any information (email?) or register using your actual info like address, DOB etc? 
---
Yeah it has 500+hours on rs3 and less than 1hour on osrs but the account recovery but it shouldn't matter if I post it here or in the RS3 forum right
---
only if it gets really big amount of wealth
---
Yeah. So for example if you had the same password for your Kroger card and target card and chipotle membership, and any 1 of the 3 leaked, they would all be compromised now. But as long as that single compromised password isn't the same one on anything important like your email, bank, amazon, etc...it doesn't really matter, they can just hack all your throwaway stuff and you'll survive. Anytime you make an account for anything, you are trusting that organization with your email/password combination. If they get hacked then that email/password combination is no longer safe and never will be again. 
---
It's not that he's completely innocent, it's that they ban the most popular DMM player among a sea of some of the most toxic people to ever play this game and the allowance of clans to all feed into one player and turn a blind eye to them. It's ass backwards, if they're gonna ban Torvesta they would need to ban over half the population of the DMMT to be consistent with their stance on muling.
---
He's not saying you can change your Runescape login. He's saying when you create you're account you can add "+blah" at the end of your email (but before the @ symbol) and it will still send email to the original email address. 
---
This way, unless someone has access to your email and is specifically looking for the runescape email address, no one will be able to find your Runescape username. 
---
Even then, you could have your Runescape username be "email+secureword@gmail.com" but your registered email could just be "email@gmail.com", thus hiding all trace of this username from the world. 
---
r/WallStreetBets
---
Another way to achieve this is to turn off XP drops while skilling (preferably skilling that gives no monetary gain like non-rooftop agility) so the dopamine drip is removed. I guess you know it's still happening, but once the levels get further and further spaced out you gain a greater appreciation for just how much time is spent doing such a mundane task.
---
Made a hard-afk skiller out of me reeeeeal quick.
---
True, it just seems weird to have it on such a (relatively) low level character.
---
Use an email specifically for RS make sure it has 2fa on it and a unique password. Same for the rs account make sure the password is unique and you don’t use it elsewhere. If you want to go overkill make sure to only log onto the email on your phone or clean pc separate from the one you play rs on in case of a key-logger (but proper 2fa should make this extra step redundant)   
---
I found this so funny as I've done this before 😂 I can relate to this
---
Banning Torvesta isn't deterring anyone besides content creators. It has only lead to a negative reaction from everyone, and will lead to a decline in DMM engagement from anyone not in a clan.
---
The clans aren't going to stop, until Jagex goes in there and bans every single one of them, which they aren't. Hence, 🦀 JAGEX IS POWERLESS AGAINST A PVP CLAN 🦀

For runscape specifically it's a very good solution. You make a new secure one with a unique password and you basically never have to use it ever again. I don't see anything wrong with that. It's peace of mind too.

I burn out from AFK training as well. There's something about the hand eye coordination of some click intensive methods that appeals to me (serum 203's, 3T tar, lavas, stun alching etc). I'm by no means a macro efficient player because I still 'waste' time by having fun with chatting and skill hopping because I get bored easily, but micro efficient methods are fun when I hyper-focus.
---
Reasonable. Let's say for now the number is arbitrary. Is there a bonus at which that advantage is equally matched with a solo ironman player? What if it was a 40%, 75%, 100% invisible stat boost for playing solo? 
---
Quest, quest, quest... Get that agility banged out early for that graceful, will help a ton with Skilling and quests ect... If you get 70 you can afk blue drags for that 43 prayer really early making questing allot faster!

So kinda noob question here. My current goal is to get to farming Vorkath (still a long way off, just hit 70s in all combat stats and need more skills for quest reqs), and so I'm eyeing getting a DHCB (eventually). But it's 130m which is an insane amount of money to me right now with my money making methods. Even high level Vorkath farming is only like 2.5m/hr, so that translates to 52 hours of farming Vorkath to pay for it. Is this a correct assessment or am I missing something that makes 130m a more feasible goal?
---
Why does this hurt me so much to hear?
---
Just made one about 2 months ago myself!! Feel free to add me. "Notradeforme" few things, that are outdated vs older videos. 
---
Farming is VERY valuable. 
---
Contracts at 65 are CRUCIAL since you can't get assigned trees, which makes it consistantly allotment patches and flowers. You can build easy seeds here. Master farmers are a.. fairly reliable way to get to that level. 
---
On the same note, BIRDHOUSE RUNS. You get tree seeds, more importantly, lots of fruit tree seeds. These are my main source of XP. Once a day, 15k~ xp. Plant as often as you can. 
---
Also, future you, will thank past you for the nests.

Quests are crappy, but those xp rewards are the most important early.

And i would still pay 111 dollars for it. Sure the customer support could improve. But comparing Jagex to amazon is abit wrong. Also i have more faith in the people who have been doing this since i was a kid, rather than my own knowledge as a player. I believe all decitions are taken with good intent and knowledge to back it up.

at low levels that might work yeah, but you'll need 25+ prayer which isn't very viable anymore once you get into higher 60's, just depends if you want to make new accounts costantly as you'll level up pretty fast through pking.

Or even better, make random loot system like in RS3 back in 2009 or so. Like if you risked more than 75k you'd get some statuettes, some rune armor pieces n shit. If you risked less than that you'd get stuff like tuna, mithril items and stuff. Even if you killed skulled max with bis items you'd get like dragon legs or something around that. I remember it was later patched so you get more items that person lost or so, but back when they released pvp worlds I remember you'd get shit even if you killed max hybrid. :D I know that's shit idea, but combined with ironman mode+random shittyass loots like that+ removing keys kinda might work.

I wasn’t comparing jagex to Amazon, I was giving you an example hence why I said other companies. Amazon is worth wayy more and generally is a different platform. But I don’t play other games but a good comparison would be a game that is made by a company who’s value is near jagexs. Almost all games/ companies have excellent support. People always say wow support does wonderful things and this and that. Only company I ever seen without customer support is jagex. If you call the customer support they currently have customer support then your out of touch with reality because that isn’t customer support, maybe support at best, support at helping you achieve nothing . Lol

This guy has 2 youtube channels, “Goatis” and “Sv3rige”. He practices the “carnivore” diet where he essentially eats nothing but raw animal products.

Will try to find the posts and will edit this post.

You really gotta do better than that standard "muh muh incel/neet muh basement" 
---
You actually dont see it?
---
Unequal application is why people are pissed about this. Jagex doesn't hold any sort of standard when it comes to their governing of the game. The rules are too subjective and are enforced at the whim of the mods. This isn't an isolated incident either sadly. The polls are only enforced when the mod team agrees with the end result rather than having changes be properly tested and researched prior to polling and tools like WMK are allowed for years before being bannable. 
---
In this instance, Torvesta asked the mods in the past if his playstyle was permitted and they said yes. There were no rule changes in this matter since that ruling and the banning this season.
