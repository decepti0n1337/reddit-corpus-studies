Found the &lt;200ehp burnout.
---
That was long long ago......waiting for wasd-movement control :0
---
lolol.

That's not her son, that's her husband. The perspective is just off. Don't kink shame.

What is msb?
---
in a clicking simulator, nonetheless
---
Mb, near the bank at dual arena autochatting shit like staking any lvls, trade for bow.
---
I hope it settles back to 110M+....when I finally buy one honestly with my own effort then it'll seem like it's worth something valuable. I don't want it to drop lower than 100M.
---
Nah too many entities on screen a few non bots disappear too.
---
They where all banned, and looked like some legit players where banned to lol.
---
Its just a feature I really like because muscle memory of having a hand on WASD from fps games. I don't think I would like wasd to move :o
---
Dont call me champ, buddy
---
he'd beg for dboots constantly lol
---
I genuinely wanted to welcome her to the RS community, not sure why everyone's being super nice n positive. guess its the female effect.

this is a repost already, but it's a classic for sure
---
No nice reading comprehension lul
---
It’s people like that (who you are responding to, mr. dresser) who occasionally make me resent being in this community. Like what the actual fuck?
---
Understanding that racism is bannable because it's wrong? IDK, I don't wanna argue over bullshit. Maybe he's still racist, maybe not, everyone fucking sucks anyway and the world is shit. Have fun.

Can u use something besides F keys to switch back and forth?

I went from using DHCB which got me 4 kills per trip to Lance which gets me 6-8 kills per trip consistently. I used elite void/max set up with dhcb with woox walking and all that but when I use max str with lance I take so much less dmg and get kills quicker.
---
And you're that guy that is somehow bothered by another man's taste in music and humor. Who is the real pathetic one here? Me probably....
---
Holy crap, rng can be a cruel bitch sometimes. Congrats, how long do you think it took hours wise?
---
Oh shit, they added the Wendy Williams show to osrs.
---
Bruh jad is just Simon says.
---
Yea but vork is:
---

---
-more difficult 
---
-designed to be a short fight and done repeatedly 
---
The fight caves is only supposed to be done once in most people's cases. So even if you have as hard of a time killing jad as you do killing vorkath for some reason, 6 hours really isn't that bad for a permanent upgrade in RuneScape.
---
You can't get a jad task until you kill jad once.
---
I dont think changing emails is something you should worry about. Ive gotten these messages on accounts that have 0 correlation with my rs email. Obviously its possible they somehow tracked the accounts back to me, but I doubt it.
---
Just make sure 2FA is turn on for your email and you should be fine.
---
Lance all the way
---
Yyou ain’t finished there bud, no boots. So pitterpatter...
---
Greedy greedy money grabbers
---
Lol even to this day, whenever runelite (normal RL) has a super nice update, a bunch of posts on reddit pop up about getting hacked and they blame it on 3rd party clients, because they take their account super serious and how it never happened with osb.
---
I've watched this happen every time for like 9 months now.
---
Hell of a coincidence.
---
I mean if you use the item on it, that would be whatever value you paid so isn't really necessary.
---
I hope they ban all third party clients so people like you quit.
---
very true and possible!
---
You can buy a tinderbox at the Lumbridge general store for a couple gp.  It’s just east of the castle.  Just west of the castle, there’s an axe shop.  You can buy an axe there.
---
Just a heads up, if you die, your loot will stay on the ground for an hour for you to pick it up.
---
New to the game, what's the best way to make money in order to escape f2p that "feels" fast?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also is it easier to get a bond here in osrs or rs3 currently?
---
You can buy them at a general store or the grand exchange.
---
oh man i hate it when they put tbows on my accounts
---
You really reposted your own post?
---
There is no way you have to pay more attention to fishing. Not s Chance. Mining yes.

But it's even written that it's going to be multi combat

I’d suck on those fingers 😀

Being racist, homophobic, sexist, transphobic, ect. is very rude and not chill.
---
You need to click once every 20 minutes.  You never need to move aside from that.   Combat will never end - if you don't click once in those 20 minutes you just stop attacking but you're still logged in.  So even if you click every 25 minutes you're still fine, just worse XP.
---
You’ll be teleported to Lumbridge when your membership really runs out. Had this happen multiple times.
---

Official Runelite is 100% open source, though. How small is your life that you have to shill for a 3rd party Runescape app?
---
I the last year;
---
7.5M Mage xp &amp; 9M Range xp
---
I'd say add half onto each of those for 1.5 years time taken.

No chance of ever is a tad disingenuous. I feel like a lot of max mains mess around in the wild

Sorry, switching. Yeah booting up takes 10-20 secs I’m an idiot

Whats wrong with "burned slave"?

Nice. What was your average work ethic throughout? (From afk Netflix to shit your pants for 2nd place)

Or was it a mix of high and low end effort?

Right click on the alchemy icon in your spellbook, and enable the warning for alchemizing untradeable items.

What percentage are maxed mains? Sure it's a lot less than the 10% ballpark figure of pvmers he gave

Yep! That's me check out my recently submitted posts for this week and last week Q&amp;A.
---
&gt;Official Runelite is 100% open source, though
---
no it is not how small is your life that you have to shill for a 3rd party Runescape app?

Maybe if you attempt the fight caves once? I didn’t kill Jad and Nieve gave me the option
---
Most bots use the official client, I vote to removing all none best in slot clients and only having runelite

This question is better for a linux sub than for the OSRS sub.
---
You shouldn't have any difficulties installing runelite provided you can get crouton running but I would be hesitant to pull the trigger on a new laptop unless someone else confirms that crouton works out of the box on it.
---
I haven't used a chromebook in a long time but I had a great experience with mine back in middle school. They make terrific low cost Linux laptops, ChromeOS itself is pointlessly limiting though.
---
Yeah I'm sure there's a lot of new players on this PvP world to witness this.
---
You probably showed this to 100 times as many newbies by making this post.
---
Oh boy here come all the copy and paste memes. Rip
---
Jagex is worth $300m USD. As I've no idea how much gold is per Mil, let's just say $0.50/mil. Runelite would have to steal 600 trillion gold to do that.
---
This is actually in the realm of possibility, as a single High-Alch of your mum will more then cover it.
---
there's already a mobile bot client
---
100% agree, give warding a chance!
---
At level 42 wildy?
---
Thanks for the comment! To be honest the point of the post is just to state my opinion, not to summery Warding because that's been done many times already,  [check out this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/arbx4x/warding_an_extensive_overview_of_the_potential/) for example!

Any reason why EVERYTHING is crashing?
---
Just started doing barrows and had a few questions. My combat stats are pretty much all flat 70s. Is it worth bringing melee for karil and the tunnel or should I just stick with iban's blast? Also, is it worth using offensive prayers or is the prayer drain too much?-
---
His fault lol, keep that shit
---
Cheers, I'll try my hand at installing crouton then reach out to the Linux sub if I struggle. I bought this one because my current Dell laptop isn't doing the greatest atm and I was able to get a C330 for $50 by cashing in some credit card rewards.
---
Dude just spend ~30 minutes~ 6 hours tidying your bank up.

Jagex, Destory everything that has to do with Warding, r/ephemeralarchon said No.

The anti-cheat team and devs are not the same people, content does not need to be delayed to "fix" bots which the anti-cheat team is working on eternally.

I\`d run to the general store right now if I were you

Bought my mum for 50k in Lumbridge so its seems to be worth it.
---
This exact picture was posted several times meme and "format "
---
How would you do it?
---
You make a very good point, but i think the goal OP's post was just to say post your hog.
---
try joining some ccs people typically talk in there. Some social ones have been posted here, also most popular content creators have active ones.
---
By using the quantity x (50) and clicking on the runes
---
Also when summer is over prices will raise again!
---
I'd suggest sticking with Iban's blast. Prayer pots are your biggest expense and so minimizing their use is the priority. You want as much inventory space as possible available for food so you can eat instead of pray on the brothers you can reasonably tank. I'd say only consider offensive prayers if there is a specific brother that takes way longer than the others (thus more prayer drain) - for me that's Ahrim and ranging.

I very eh with runelite and osbuddy

Is this so we know to crash a player if they're an ironman?

Yeah mine was named "Labrador puppy" and I felt like an absolute Savage
---
&gt;You don't need to hold Ctrl.  Deleting ignored users is always one click, just spam click the top one.

You're 100% right. Wow wtf lmao I never knew that. Thanks dude.
---
I just stay at full hp on normal mode with absorbs. Don't really get hit much and still get about 75k xp/hr.

Thanks for the transcript,  looks like they answered my question this week!

---
I always found it weird they refer to subhumans as "men".
---
And lol he deleted it after someone brings up it would make crashing ironmen easier lololo
---
He used **coding** and **algorithms** to control the bots
---
It was one of the best tip I ever got, i feel like most people panic when healers come out and that’s when they die and with this method just two clicks instead of 4.

So you are proposing a weapon that costs 60m to make and 3k per swing which isn't BIS in any situation?
---
Plus the hour it takes to get to him. Its endurance more than anything.
---
Doesn't work unfortunately, since the constitution is just legalesed and sophisted away, as it is being now. You need a government with 4 laws, don't steal, murder, assault, commit fraud. 
---
No ability to amend or add new laws. 
---
This is the only government that could remain permanently stable.
---
lol this post was spot on because i'm trying to kill splasher rats with a kitten rn xD
---
Home tele don't work?
---
I think farming was just released, so yeah lol. 
---
The acc has super high stats in everything, but only 24 farming. So it was probably just released.
---
That would be a gold sink. If you had 140m and you buy a Dragon Hunter crossbow from someone, you both have 140m each. What one player does with their gold doesn't affect the other player's wealth. If I choose to put 140m with of a DHCB into a pet that consumes the item, then I'll never get that 140m back. That's a gold sink.
---
And have it occasionally do the cry emote.
---
I could still play the game without RuneLite but I think sometimes I definitely take some of its features for granted. I love skill calculator, exp trackers and loot trackers that it now feels like it’s just part of the game.
---
I prefer dhide maybe even verac’s helm or skirt. Being a little tanky can help you save supplies. Also, helps you tank the healers on jad so you can just tag them. Good luck!
---
Yep. Even if you were a remainer, Brexit is a travesty of democracy.
---
Never seen anyone be so heated about guthans
---
I find it silly how the community accepts runelite but then complains about ezscape updates.
---
i don't think the default solution should be to keep changing the rules of the game based on where you are. when pvm is different from bh pvp is different from low wildy pvp is different from deep wildy pvp is different from pvp world pvp (etc) it just makes it all that much less appealing to get into.
---
Would it not still be considered a gold sink? That item has value. Even if you aren't directly throwing gold away, you are taking an item that has value out of the game.
---
this gave me a good chuckle.
---
u/ismystr0
---
You have to drop and telegrab the cape you dont want trimmed every time you get another 99. It's not unreliable you just did it wrong if the untrimmed cape was in your bank.
---
Except you can freeze for more than 10s. So many skull tricks like that have time even with the logout timer.
---
Also the inconsistency is probably just due to how the engine decides if you're "in combat" which requires being hit afaik.
---
I don't pk at all so I'm not sure I follow. Log into another account? Say I'm in the wild and I'm being attacked, then I attack that play back. What's the trick there? These players are able to log in to a different account in the exact same spot in the wild, in less than the second it takes for me to determine who attacked me? How can they input their password that fast? You can't copy paste it.
---
When you haven't made a 2.2m PK, that you called a 3m PK, whilst risking 102m, on someone else's account, in 2 seconds.
---
No one duels for fun. People only duel for practice with their mates and a lot of people can't find partners or have no motivation to take time off of grinding to do pvp
---
There's no reason for a pvmer not to vote yes to that anyway. If they never get a kill it doesn't affect them, but if they do ever get a kill they get a benefit.
---
It's not even a circlejerk.
---
Ahhh I remember seeing this

What do you mean? I'm not hip on the Jagex/Runelite drama.

Wintertodt damage scales to your hp level, so if you have 10 (and up to like 15 or something like that) hp, it'll only ever hit 1s on you and you can just use really cheap food and never have to worry about dying.
---
Uhh... No. When you trade items there's no net difference to the economy.

Christ of all the maymays I've seen today THIS is the one that made me actually lol
---
I'm enjoying it the most I have since just before EoC launched, which I quite like now after coming back. Starting as an Ironman and going slow helped me out tons. I had plenty of incentive to do quests as they became available since the rewards were quite useful to me and new items (ones that aren't in OSRS) came slowly or I learned about them ahead of time sorta through 'osmosis,' just from being in a clan or chatting to people when I could.
---
The early game, the revisions of old quests and the overhauled visuals of old content, that was magical to me. I loved every bit of playing through those memories and seeing how they looked now. The late game stuff I'm opening up now is exciting and interesting and addictive.
---
It may not be the game for everyone, but it's definitely my favorite iteration of RS since classic. And they added a /wiki function for easy searches, so that's pretty nice.
---
Wow.
---
Yeah but nobody cares about F2P amirite guys haha
---
I’m sure you could but it’s easier to just kill them in one trip. You have to understand that when you go into their lair, it’s very likely two of even all three of them aggro you. You will not want to deal with this to kill all three. Look up a solo guide and kill Supreme first, Rex second, and Prime last, all while praying Magic really high Ranged defence.
---
Wow I’ve been taking a break for a couple weeks playing the new PoE league, band is has really dropped in price?
---
Pray protection on ahrim, dharok, and karils. If you have left over prayer, use the rest on the other brothers. If you happen to get ahrim or dharok in tunnel, drink a dose of prayer and pray that you finish them quickly.
---
Me right now after dying to zuk twice in one night

I like the idea of more hunting things there and resource type things.
---
Imagine I have 1b and I buy a tbow off of you. You now have 1b. A week later i drop the tbow and nobody picks it up. You still have your 1b, the gold never left the game. Gold sinks remove gold from the game. Imagine you could go to an NPC and pay him 1b so that your pet now looks like he's holding a tbow. Gold has permanently left the game
---
...And most of them were stolen or Venezuelan accounts, which is the point

.&gt;everyone else has Infernal Capes

.&gt;still get called a noob by asshole elitists
---
.&gt;reeee
---
Pleeeeease this. It desperately needs it.
---
I say it's more of a dick move since it clearly looked like you were wanting to fight someone else.
---
Nice kill but he wasn't even trying to fight you. He was getting skull and walked back to his opponent to fight and then. He could have unequipped whip and just kicked once but he hit a 0 anyways so it didn't matter. Not even karma just a normal pk.
---
they didnt offer new imbues, they offered imbues we already have.
---
Even that's 1.2b at its peak.
---
35 attempts here. Got to triple jads once and lagged bad. V sad
---
Yo this is good
---
Definitely. He's just higher stress because a screw up can mean 40-60 minutes of wait to try again.
---
Really jad is a sound/visual test with 2 seconds to react, and the only challenge thrown ontop of that is the healers spawning forcing you to shift focus while still reacting.
---
It's one of the easiest bosses in the game compared to learning some of the newer ones. It just has a lot more potential to one shot you, and you can't just "try again instantly"
---
Why yes I do work for Jagex, how did you know?
---
looks pretty sick
---
you should get on to creating the entire runescape from scratch in unity so i can migrate
---
I agree all of those players should be banned for spamming. That will fix absolutely all of the issues
---
If it displayed their name that’d be amazing, free pet for every hcim you slay to promote hcim hunting 8)
---
Pest control is probably the only solution you need right? It's the fastest and does all of them. Balance out mage/range however you want, prayer is obvious and melees/HP are easy to figure out together.
---
That’s brutal
---
All of my friends who are buff like that utilized steroids.  Odds are against the dude that he’s been natural his entire life.  It takes genetics and insane dieting otherwise.  Nothing personal against him, it’s just the reality of guys trying to look like Superman because of over-saturation of ripped guys in entertainment.

That's not going to happen.

Buy bonds or swap the money over idiot
---
They pretty much give you a bow and rune arrows but block your off hand so you cant use the bow.
---
I took in 15m and used rune throwing axes, easy work when they accept.
---
I’d cast my vote for “engine work” or “pvp updates ARE (lol) important to us” being the reasons it wouldn’t happen.
---
It does so much dps it is worth. Here is a guid for max kills an hour with tbow https://youtu.be/cBAzYd6kssc
---
We know how to do it, more curious on how the scene went did it go rs3 or osrs ? Just what has happen to the game in that area. I remember when I leave it was a big issue and the economy was screwed.

Just keep going back. Just bad rng. U risk almost nothing. Be quick on the log or tele or run.

Why not

I'm on a 250 day grind.

Yeah, I haven't tried to replicate it but I'm assuming it was just some weird mobile glitch.
---
To be fat, he loses money every friggen video
---
From an efficiency standpoint yea, but if you really wanted to max your account the most efficient way then you would prob want to get 99 rc, fishing, and mining first just to have a fat cash stack to help you out with everything else. Playing as efficiently as possible is much different than playing enjoyably.
---
I'm 99 prayer, 99 fletching, 99 cooking, 99 fishing.  Not HP.
---
Oh my
---
It’s still messy in osrs, haven’t played much rs3, but economy skyrockets when bots get banned.
---
They are more then welcome to, I have never ran a bot on my account :) Doesn't mean the interest about them isn't there, it's a large fraction of the game the entire rwt and botting community. Would the game even service without those members ?
---
IWD back at it with the flame on another platform
---
Had to expand too much crack fueled rage to contain it to just one game
---
Sovereign (SV)
---
Laughing gas.
---
I did on my asus flip chrome book. Downloaded crouton and installed Linux. r/crouton and their github page make it pretty clear. Runelite runs ok on it once you install java
---
I take 12-15 monkfish and that gets me a full inv of loot and bones. If you don’t care about the loot then just take ppots I guess
---
After playing Runescape for over 13 years, the only immersion I get is from questing. Really looking forward to the new quest seeing as I’ve done all the rest. Everything else is just **click mouse watch number happen** so it’s hard to experience the immersion.
---
Though I must say that was a clever comment lol
---
I  dissagree. Achievement diary rewards are a good incentive to train skills, and so is the achievement of gaining a level on itself. Any progression on your account is meaningful, as long as it gets you closer to max and you are enjoying yourself doing it.
---
90+ str, 94 mage. Veng pk
---
Wilderness slayer should to be at least 750k/h when doing slayer, seeing as you can get that and beyond whiöe doing regular slayer.
---
Do we need to increase the key loot? Meh, i dont think so. We do need more creatures with abit buffed drop table.
---
u/jagex_wolf
---
This is great, almost makes me want to runecraft for 2 minutes. Almost.
---
Just fix the bot problem lol
---
Oh I know I am a 10 year vet. Just since my room mate used to farm gold got me curious if the scene still exists. I am just a very casual player now.
---
they didnt offer anything, the skill doesn't exist. The idea of new imbues being added was indeed mentioned as a possibility. For some reason people have it drilled in their heads that the "idea" of warding pitched in the dev blog is all that it could be and is exactly what would be added to the game 1:1. that's not even remotely the case, simply a very early design idea.
---
Fuckin black magic is what it is!
---
Yes but you're limited to a certain amount of bones per day based on your diary completion. So it a slow, but more efficient grind
---
BP + D darts are definitely BiS in ToB. Tbow is only used for lazy maiden (can stand further back so more time to react to the blood special attack, but it's slightly less DPS), the free shot running into maiden/Sote, and as the last hit at Nylos boss range phase (3-4 blowpipe hits + 1 tbow). Other than that bp + d darts are always better DPS (Assuming you have scythe, without scythe it can be used at Sote as well as Xarpus if specs miss)

You can participate in wilderness content and get the same rewards out of it with 1m risk as you would 50k risk. You have the same chances at the unique items from say, callisto with or without a skull. I know saying 0 risk is an overstatement, but in this game you can make \~50k per minute doing fully safe pvm. I don't really feel bad saying 50k is practically 0 risk. I also don't think risk in the wilderness should rely on people forgetting to bank runes/coins before doing a clue scroll.
---
If your risk was 500k each time you lost about 1-1.2b
---
You didn't really add an argument of your own for the things you support.

Pking
---
Doesn't the GPU thing just make it blue? I'm trying to figure it out.
---
Accept✅
---
I really like having heaps of bots in the game, I like cheap cannonballs, cheap iron, cheap gold, cheap lobs etc.
---
To be honest if there were no bots in the game, the cost of pure essence would be 1000% what it is now.
---
Like I said, if he does regain access of his account he needs to change the info and it’ll be secure. He could even make an RS only email/pass for it. Any game you play you should use different passwords. It’s best to have a main gaming email for trusted sites or platforms like Steam, secondary gaming for sites like RS, I call them “sign up games”. Finally get one for personal use and one for business, best place to keep the info is written down or printed out and kept in a safe spot. I have a ton of passwords and things I remember for recovery. Never hurts to protect your information.
---
You’re 3rd party client has miscounted the kills left. You’ve already finished the task, but if you kill 2 o. The same game tick the client only recognises the one xp drop. It happens when using a cannon or barraging tasks.
---
It is only irritating untill you get the flow of the fight, a breeze after. Open zulrah helper next to your game window to easily follow rotation.
---
Neat. Upvote.

They should make Ironmen be able to trade with each other, make like a new tier like Ironman Lite where there's still no GE and all that but you can trade only with other Ironmen
---
Skotizos temple? Care to elaborate? Im interested
---
Nice link
---
This is what places look like the day after a new skill is released.
---
Why can I not just change my password? I know my password and want to change it.  But its locked behind my email.
---
If I remember correctly, once the engine work for the updated clan system is done, reworked coop slayer and group ironman mode aren't too far behind (assuming they pass the poll of course.) 
---
I guess they run on the same/similar system or something.
---
Haven't leveled up farming in years. What does it look like now?
---
God I’ve just started trying to learn zulrah and shit that fucking snake changes forms fast
---
Im new to pking on PVP worlds. Is there not a timer? I know it isn't 10 seconds but I can never attack people for a while after a fight.
---
I believe they polled or talked about "group ironman" or something like that before. Don't quote me on that, I only read it on here when someone else said it. From what I gathered it would be normal ironman, except you can only trade with people in your "group" so you and a couple buddies I guess. Be a tier below normal ironmen I'd assume.
---
You realise the burden of proof doesn't fall on anyone because this is a runescape subreddit you absolute numpty
---
Here's the thing, almost every large pking update over the last year most of which were pupular with solo pkers and would have had good effects on pker vs pker fights where voted no to. When those updates got changed to be pvm based they always pass. And it wasn't pkers withholding support until they were pvm wilderness polls.
---
I don’t use OSBuddy so cant speak for it from experience, but I do trust it. Runelite of course I 100% have faith in, so that leaves your old email. If you get access try to contact support to get it changed to an email you know isn’t compromised. Good job with the quick reacting for the rest of your accounts and emails, I wish you the best of luck with your mains recovery/losses (if there’s much at all he can do).
---
It is worth noting there is a difference between empty and dead. Karamja is a jungle; some parts of it should feel like a jungle without a bunch of activities to do. The East side does have room for some new content, but the West side is pretty good on content; it just could use some improvements.
---
A lot of the points you raised there are not really issues. The mine isn't very useful, but you could say the same of dozens of other mines; it is not a flaw of Karamja but of the skill since no one mines ores except Iron, Gem, and Granite. The Nature Altar isn't traveled to outside of the Abyss often (Fairy Ring Nats are a thing...) but it is still one of the most popular Rune Altars in the game and in far better shape than most.
---
So I wouldn't say just because there is an empty space we need to fill it. It is kinda like saying there is so much empty desert between the cities; that is kinda the point of a desert... And then when there is content there, you just disregard it. A question worth asking is what would you put there exactly that would fill the space without it feeling too much like a theme park instead of a jungle. Some random hunter creatures (new or old)? Yet another cave system with monsters? A new type of Woodcutting Tree since most existing ones wouldn't suit the environment? Because with an area like that it is hard to put something there that would be more worthwhile than the Nature Altar or Mine while still making it feel like a long stretch of jungle.

A terrible idea

outside of the skilling imbues, they offered all the same imbues already in the game.
---
Wait, that’s legal?
---
Did you do the tutorial island

Bad or no toothpaste means more money for dentists
---
But also make its weight effect your run energy so people have to grind a second graceful set so we have mark of grace sink
---
Time is money. Long term the time saved using blowpipe outweighs the extra time using melee
---
The possibilities of skilling imbues are endless, Jagex knows that.  Stop trying to argue with pointless points.
---
They can see your kc on the party board.
---
Insane.....
---
did you forget the part where he's in the wilderness
---
if your goal is to use efficiently, taking 4 months to get 50 magic even at a slow pace is extremely inefficient.  The point of me mentioning that i already have all the imbues, is that chances are a majority of the current player base already have the imbues, when a majority of the imbues being added to the skill are already in the game that is a piss poor design.  New lvl 5-40 robes wont change people splashing, they are not looking for engaging content at that level, and magic accuracy doesnt mean fuck all when you are that low anyway since 80% of it comes off of your magic level anyways.  I am fine with a new skill coming into the game, but i want it to be engaging and enjoyable, what is enjoyable about me buying useless shit just to break it down to make more useless shit?  Oh gold sink i forgot!!!!!
---
Doesn't look like you're getting the attention you were looking for
---
Also, I care
---
Use in-game gold you silly gooses. Learn to do either vork or moneysnek and you can easily buy bonds whenever you need them.
---
Howd it go? Takes a bit but its well worth the learning curve.
---
Yeah as someone in a clan I do the same thing. If people hit me in a high risk world doing prayer or even a normal world it's like 10 seconds until a team logs in and singles to multi them. If your just doing prayer next to someone it's unlikely they'll call a team unless your in insane tank gear and they think you've got a lot of bones.
---
Flexing on us with that screen
---
OMG whoever told you that blood font on black background was a good idea, lied to you.
---
On this subreddit, are we aloud to post our OSRS channels and videos? I know we can’t post live-streams, wasn’t sure about channels
---
so you want warding to break down useless shit, yet you want rewards that will increase raw resources.  Kind of counter productive dont you think?
---
Bots are killing the game by running around the GE.
---
Its not even like theyre merching. Theyre literally just running around.
---
Hitting 73s with a whip? Badass
---
The issue was addressed in 2017 already during one of the livestreams by Mat K, appearantly game positions the staff around male model positioning (which is wider).
---
I seriously doubt they'll bother to fix it this year either
---
When you look on Reddit and find a repost
---
we need to start a gofundme for this dude
---
It doesn’t really prepare you for the stress of fucking up two hours of effort, nor the healer phase, or much else really.. but it does at least make sure you know what prayer to use
---
Amen brother, amen

How do you trim qpc?

This something I'm concerned about. I want to get qpc for diaries. But I also want to get untrimmed slayer Cape. Can I get qpc first?

Saying fart? Not in my Christian RuneScape server.
---
Just needed something of value tbh. Is there anything in chest over 300k?

I got that exact same reward from that exact same location a few hours ago.
---
Nangs
---
relax cc is hinestly one of the most friendly/helpful cc’s ive found in game, since join i have been taught how to raid and with weekly clan events engaged in so much more content then i was previously when hanging out in streamers cc’s, low reqs for a pvming clan and is honestly the mid tier clan for anyone who is looking to getting into bossing and raids, highly reccomend
---
Because nmz is literally the most afk combat in the game?
---
Yea usually you see a little dip in April and May when people sell their gear to do finals so you see a mini crash that evens out and then summer hits and everything goes down 10-20%. Once it hits August stuff will go up again but don’t expect it to go back to the price before the crash, I expect dhammer to be around 45-49m and dhxbow to go back to 108-110.
---
It does my head in!
---
Rc bad
---
I kinda like that they wear what they wore when killed.
---
Would prevent people farming them as who would want a naked version can’t flex that, and then it would be truly rare to see one in 3a or whatever
---
Yes, you can get to mort on a level 3.
---
Lol, he think im talking exp? Jeez
---
got mine the other day on 53 kc
---
Planet earth, wbu?
---
Uncheck and check the remember box, this usually fixes it. Also on pc.
---
Do you remember when the wild/free trade was taken away back in 2007? We're in a similar situation now except replace the lack of wild/free trade with the lack of pvp updates/ironman mode, everyone who was originally interested in pvp back then left the game never to return, osrs was a second chance but they've blown it and I really don't think there can be a third at least for the original pvp crowd since they're too old/don't care anymore.
---
Full disclosure, ironman mode is a great addition to the game and I can absolutely see the appeal, it's the entitled mentality that people who exclusively play them seem to have adopted, why would people want to fight back/team up to do any potential group multi content when they have nothing to gain? When the mode was introduced we were told the mode wouldn't ever effect the main game and updates wouldn't be catered towards ironmen but unfortunately the mentality of players changing drastically was overlooked. 
---
It might be possible to bring it back with some well informed updates but that would require someone on the jmod team who understands the different aspects of pvp, deep wild/account builds/team pking/clan pking/anti-pking, not just edge pking. But we can't have people selfishly denying potential updates just because they're ironmen and stand to gain nothing from it.
---
I do this when I wanna avoid doing something incredibly stressful or annoying in-game, and it works. No point doing something relatively pointless against your will.
---
impressive!
---
still has a bigger brain than spade pkers
---
Botting used to be way way worse
---
Damn you had 3 ruby specs in a row. That is some good rng
---
Try manually hitting log out instead of closing the app or window on pc.
---
Jagex plz! This is amazing idea!
---
I am guessing mobile players hitting max / near max and doing pvm ?
---
ranarr: seed cost 38k, assume 7 herbs per patch @ 6.5k ea = 45.5k, 7.5k profit per seed
---
avantoe: seed cost 1k, assume 7 herbs per patch @ 1.7k ea = 11.9k, 10.9k profit per seed
---
At higher farming levels you'll get more herbs per seed so ranarr starts to edge out the others, but for now toadflax and avantoe will probably be better.
---
I don't think it was ever polled but it has a lot of the communities support. Last Runefest a lot of people expected them to announce it but they didn't so a lot of the twitch chat were spamming about it and forced Jagex to speak about it and basically said the guys that would work on it are working on mobile so it's not coming out any time soon. I'm hoping after rs3 mobile is launched they'll got around to it. :)
---
4 but one was on a freeze sadly
---
The ironman way to vorkath, its so much easier to woox walk melee as well...
---
Congrats man :)
---
&gt;Because nmz is literally the most afk combat in the game?
---
variation, drops, clue scrolls, xp in a skill other than combat, superiors, slayer point rewards. do you need any more?
---
This guy is a ddoser wanting to scam people out of their gear.
---
Don't think it was ever polled.
---
Was talked about in a Q&amp;A but then was said that it would require significant looking at the code and changes to the clan system.
---
I would also like more content on the island itself rather than in the vulcano. Only come there for karambwans and fruit tree/calquat
---
I disagree, 25 Buttholes is the goat
---
Ice demon for raids?
---
Not sure otherwise
---
Yea, I’m bigger and leaner than him and have just lifted casually for several years while avoiding junk food
---
Is Nieve/Steve better than Duradaddy?
---
I’m JK.  Most of the people I run into nowadays are military.  Even had a couple LTs in my clan and had no idea !
---
Or an amount that most people can actually get but would be unwilling to just spend on "nothing", like 10m or more. Maybe 50m?
---
Now that's a dry streak.
---
People hated getting scammed back in the day, but to me that was part of the charm
---
I recall no real discussion about multiple houses but i'm curious what you have in mind
---
Cringe
---
add a few more herb patches to go along with that and i'm all for it
---
It’s not that, the engine would need a lot of work and it’s not that they don’t want to do group Ironman, but RS3 mobile is just ahead of the queue for engine work.
---
anything which involves fire runes, high alching, farm runs, glass blowing etc
---
This is what I said but I have 0 kill count cause I cant even kill it :)))))))))
---
I think there’s two types - unrestricted (where you did fight caves) and tournament (where you can only practice PVP @ clan wars)
---
I didn't want it either, I just got it because I got sick of hearing "Nice cape" for no reason when I stand at GE for more than a minute.
---
Ugggh...it's nothing compared to your 2800+ kills but Im at 700 kills and I haven't got any uniques yet :( wishing u good luck with ur tanzanite fang grind brother
---
I do try my best
---
I thibk the location is at the bottom next to the charcoal place, the pray location is there too. Not sure tho had the same clue but cant remember the right place. I was running around the place to find it.
---
If you do finish Dragon Slayer II, Rune dragons and Vorkath are really good money. You probably can get enough money for 83 constriction in a day or two.
---
[This wiki article](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide) sounds like something you might be looking for.
---
It orders them in such a way they're doable at the time you get there and you get as much use out of your xp rewards as possible (by getting them at the time you need em most).
---
I do encourage deviating when you feel like it because that's what this game is about, but if you ever feel lost it gives you a bit of guidance
---
I really enjoy playing as a regular acct and its all i do, fuck ironman, i respect those who can do it though. Just try regular account for awhile and if you dont get into it then maybe its not your game? Rs is grindy/boring no matter the playstyle.
---
You don't, you stop autoretaliating at 20 min. Log out a bit after that.
---
Someone else complained about this the other day - they mentioned you need a ‘perfect mould’ since April or something?

Can you do 36 more kills for me champ?
---
Ever since I maxed I’m playing an account with a limitation of being 10hp and an ironman. I had so much fun with it thinking about methods to do quests and getting certain items that people belive are impossible that I cannot describe it. Even completing a quest gives me more joy here than a 99 did on my main account.
---
It's almost as if the PK streamers have something to gain from killing unarmed opponents who drop things worth actual money...

The people who capitalizes on such posts for karma or discussion initiations care.
---
There you go, mind changed.
---
no it's not. it's true. getting a fire cape is not any kind of achievement. op is 100% correct.
---
Wasting time to get an infernal cape is even worse. Fire cape does suffice.
---
I'd rather not get an item and end up making a loss from bossing because I lost 10m+ on the item when I sell it back.
---
lack of jmod crowns
---
If you used a ring of coins on the pet would it turn into coins you could pick up ;)?
---
It's not supposed to be literal. It's just showing that as you collect more kills (the subtracting from the denominator part) your likelihood of receiving a drop increases. If you took a huge sample of people, the average person would get the drop at approximately 16,000 kills, so you can treat that like it's the literal figure when trying to explain the concept as I was here\^ You're just trying to make me look stupid on the internet.
---
Feel free to join the cc 'cheah' in game and ask for a discord invite there. Our req is ~115cbt and we do lots of raids and some gwd. We are looking to start tob soon. Based in NA with a lot of Australian members theres almost always someone down to pvm or talk shit

F2P can get beginner clues and they only have access to Musa Point. So I think it's fair to assume they didn't add Karamja on purpose.
---
I managed to get a few kills, 1 pk'er! Which I'm very happy with. Definitely helped me stay motivated. I'm going to put in a lot more practice and hopefully I get to be a decent pk'er someday in the future. Kind of forced to take a little break though, my supplies ran out a lot quicker than i thought they would so I need to make some money to pay for those. Thank you so much for asking!
---
58 mins ouch. At least you were rewarded.

Goodluck brother, I am in the same spot. Hit 82 kc today on the hc, no bucket yet. Hope that we get it both very soon!
---
Hey guys dendicc here,   
---
As most of you know I've been struggling these past few years trying to get over what Durial321 did to me. I was thinking of maybe hosting group therapy sessions for all Falador massacre survivors maybe at the Blue Moon Inn? I'm open to other location suggestions, just not in Falador as I haven't been back there ever since you know what. 
---
Let me know if you guys are interested. 
---
Thanks, dende.
---
I'm guessing you never read my suggestion on how I'd like Warding to be changed. Basically scratch the soapstones, runic energies and monoliths and make various wards on fires instead with a lamp charged at a Runecrafting altar. 
---
It integrates other boring and/or meaningless skills into Warding to improve both at the same time.
---
Also Agility will have a part too in that it's used to traverse specific wards in PvP areas, giving Agility some much needed reasons to train.
---
It ruins the quality of a post. Theres a whole sub dedicated to it: r/awardspeechedits
---
40 atk 70 str 80ish range and magic 1 prayer and just do F2p its cheap and the only switch you gotta do is into your 2h for KOs.  If your gonna do 99hp def and range youve pretty much made a main at that point and should just pk on your main
---
Claim runes from the magic tutor as a start
---
Sorry you had to do that bro
---
Tome is not needed really. You’ll need mage’s book anyways.
---
Who is saying agility is afk?
---
No it’s 50/50 you either get it or you don’t
---
Fire cape is most definitely an achievement especially for people that haven’t gotten it before. What’s with the elitist bullshit in here lol.
---
I think it's just some dirt, it will wipe off.
---
i just noticed a few days ago my hp bars switched back to normal ugly, when will they come back? the option isnt even there anymore
---
That’s not playing the game though. So yeah, what’s your point? Fucking braindead monkey.
---
yes
---
My favorite was the grow as adult knowing he was gonna get scammed crying about getting scam cause he kept dying to Jad
---
It literally is the 2007 version/backup and it's been tweaked. You're possibly confusing this with classic WoW.
---
Yeah, it was way worse.
---
Runescape 3 is still there. Nobody forces you to play Oldschool Runescape. Just saying.
---
Yea looks like he only trains chest arms and shoulders
---
A tbow is 1/30m points. So assuming you do solo’s its about 1k solo raids to get 1 tbow. Lets say including scouting etc itll take u 500 hours for 1 tbow, if it would be 50m nobody would do cox.
---
No there not if u are non ironman and get pked the pker can pick then up on death if a ironman dies they get destroyed no matter what
---
Obby set, berserker neck, obby knife

Suppose game has 1k items, 1m gold. All the items would cost 1k each.

I lost. I quit. I’m back.

He's like "toothpaste? That's some kind of paste made out of teeth? Can't be good, gotta say no"
---
For what it's worth - you get 15 hours of combat out of your veracs armor, and I think it's like 300k? to repair the set and even less if you get your smithing level up. for those 15 hours you will easily make that money (and save loads on pray pots because of veracs high pray bonus) so dont be afraid to rock it!

This is the real answer
---
Hence why he kept the glory. Still doubt it tho
---
Praise the battlewards! Halleluljah!
---
For a quick answer- Dhide bodies are always profitable. But max stack of each colour and you usually make 200k\*gp every 8 hours
---
I domt think you realize how statistics work. If you have a 20 sides die and roll 5 1s in a row, that is a 1/3,200,000 million odds. However that is the same odds as rolling any other combination of numbers. His chances of getting and of the other items with a low KC didn't go down just because he got the first ones at a lower KC, his odds of getting every item on the first KC are the same as getting the item on his 9,000th KC, that's how RNG works.
---
He mentioned d'hide as well. Considering he's taking about cost efficiency and range, I think he's referring to that.
---
Takes a while to get it down. I died probably 30+ times before I got my first kill, then died several times between the next 20 or so. But now I'm a little over 1k kc, I don't need to look at any of the reference chart/diagrams for the rotations, and went around 200+kc without dying (until recently breaking that streak). And I'm using the standard ahrims/dhide setup with toxic trident and BP, with only 87 range/mage. It's just one of those things that just becomes muscle memory with some practice.

Like that rock pet from a while back in RS3. Well before it was RS3. People giving it party hats n shit

I made a a fresh chin, then died walking to edge ville by one of those trees between draynor manor and the cow field.

Is that really you, Serene-senpai?

Honestly agree with you. If you got really bad or really good rng somewhere you should post it! I love seeing people who finished something like demonics in 150kc
---
Cannon your range to 40, get str to 60 and your in the bracket. Gl
---
Bot i should be able to bolt him then go on for the dclaws haha skill specs sucks.
---
the layout for fixed mode is a lot better for more accurate clicking for things like tob, pking, etc.., and the reason i use it is because it was the default screen size a couple years ago so i got used to it
---
Did'ya punch your screen or something? Gratz nevertheless.
---
Ahh right you are
---
I don't understand why people bitch. This sub is already nothing but shitty beaten to death unfunny memes. Decent discussion is few and far between. Let people post whatever. There's no need to limit what's allowable.

No and nor should there be

This was done using things found in heavily Barbarian themed areas, where there's no Xerician presence.

How do you guys get so many hespori seeds? I do 2-3 contracts per day, 3-4 herb runs, entire tree run and seaweed runs. I feel like I should be getting way more

Ya, 'tis so.

The plan is for a dragon defender asap, but that wont be for a long time.

I forgot about the prayer bonus lol, I just got that set for the looks. And I should be able to make 300k every 15 hours along with less prayer pots, so I'll probably start using it. Thanks for the help!
---
I'd argue that the "prestige of accomplishing everything" would include beating the fight caves? Getting both the fire/inferno capes shows you've basically mastered the mechanics of the game, not just put enough time into maxing an account.
---
Like, maxed acc = time and inferno = "skill".
---
Plus, a lvl 126 without a fire or inferno cape looks really fucked lmao
---
Nice, man! Good luck. Mm2 (in my opinion) is WAY easier than ds2. The platform is easy if you zoom in the view and take your time. Dont click in a hurry. The only challenge is glough's last phase but it can be done easily if you exploit the ranged flinching trick.
---
I'm not sure how long it took but I would guess around two hours without making mistakes.
---
Oh....my.......days.
---
Nice, dude. I love when I get a good drop from my last kill.
---
No worries man! I personally rock the veracs skirt, with a fighter torso which is good middle ground between are bonus and pray bonus. And way I see it, your praying you don't care about Def bonus :)
---
Yes, there is a way to track the mole without falador diary 3 unlocked.  It is a simple feature called "Using your eyes"/
---
Oh duh
---
I think this is just fine, let them live their lives how they want.
---
Hi everyone ('-')/ i'll try to make long story short:  
---
I got back to OSRS after 2 years, literally started 2 days ago and won a bond on a marble race on stream  
---
I dont remember much, and because of that i think using the bond would be a waste since i dont remember any P2P money making method to afford another one except for running nature runes which i remember, IT SUUUUUUCKS, but gives decent money, please dont get me back to it :( , but it is true that trying to do things on F2P sometimes can be....."annoying" (i.e. trying to level up mining or WC at varrock if you know what i mean) and membership would help to level my skills a lot faster.  
---
I'd like if someone can please give me some suggestions on what to do, since i started 2 days ago my account is extremely low, pretty much like base 20's on f2p skills,  should i stay on f2p for a while till i get used to the game and get my skills up a bit? or should i use it for the purpose of questing (with guides like OSRS wiki) and fast lvling for like the 1st week then focus on trying to find a money making method somewhere else (youtube/google guides) as for 2nd week?  
---
Also 1st post on reddit ¡yay!.
---
Zulrah grind isnt too bad compared to most other boss grinds, because almost every kill is going to be rewarding due to the scales and other drops.
---
I read Ardougne as ADrougne for basically my entire life until the ardougne memes came out in which I realized my folly
---
You can leave the tomb the moment you get the xp drop for casting the final hit that kills the brother and you'll be fine. For instance if the brother is on 1 hp and you get an exp drop with HP exp, you can peace out immediately and save a few ticks
---
Yeah who the fuck wants to trade 😂😂😂 honestly man this plan is great this is gonna make rs as big as fortnite
---
Great point. Thanks for the motivation!
---
Acb with Ruby or diamonds?
---
Nice risk
---
holy shit
---
Source or...?
---
Nice meme, also accurate at raids. But I would rather not have 2 min+ zulrah kills :).
---
Cba even reading it tbh what u expect from the sub, it’s been like this for a long ass time
---
You're not wrong. But remind me to never take you to the Falador party room.
---
That's like saying you didn't put a spoiler tag on an endgame spoiler because you could have seen it by watching the movie.
---
Very lucky BTW! Got rangers yet?
---
No you didn't.
---
Dhcb was selling for 95m last night, was insane and then 1 hour later you couldn’t buy for 103m

Y’all mf will argue about anything

I have a clan but I would like to 1v1 at times without doing the typical dharok bh fights. Cant do that because most clans are out waiting for one of their mates to lower another person's food before logging in.
---
because it's legit karma farm. imagine games like league of legends where some people consider getting gold an achievement, but it's not posted to death on the league sub. its the internet, toxicity isnt even a new thing, it has been happening for decades. get over it.

They announced the gauntlet won’t use outside gear and that coupled with summer crash

Just got a black demon konar task. is it possible to safespot them with ranged in brimhaven?
---
Did you enjoy playing runescape today? *thumbs up button*
---
I was about to say, once you get above 100 cb a lot of people start looking down on you for not having a fire Cape. I don't have inferno cape but I am *very* excited to try. Like literally anyone could have a max account at this point if they just had the time for it. The hardest part of fight caves for me was finding an hour and 15 minute window I could stay paying attention to just the game.
---
Rs3 got that voodoo place though, as well as a divination spot and reworks to the TzHaar
---
I thought this was ....not a dating site?
---
100%.
---
Link?
---
So the lumbridge teleport? Yes I’m that low.
---
All I’m gonna say and it’s an unpopular opinion, the grind is to high. It feels like they designed this heavy long grind to keep people from getting to endgame to endgame. It shouldn’t take 7,000 hours to max an account because content should be why you play 7,000 hours not afk. The only reason I play this game at all is cause I can play on mobile when I’m bored at my In laws so I get it. I’m not the hardcore player some of you are, however what is fun about afk clicking every 5 minutes to get an arbitrary number that says 99. I enjoy the pvp aspects and especially the PVM but if I have to play hundreds of hours for it to get fun then there is some disconnect and why this game is a cult classic
---
If you forgot your email, what you can do is go to forgotten username or login whatever it is and fill out the form and in the description box tell them your issue and provide as much proof as you can in description box like ip created on and credit cards used and date created etc. That's the only way a real jagex human will look at it unless you get their attention here or Twitter but its low chance
---
Full Screen is the best screen. I only used fixed to take the picture.
---
big true
---
the problem is that the window for personal and account achievements has shifted so all of the things people used to think were impressive are actually just very common now
---
They used to be released 100%
---
This was changed specifically to attempt to revitalize PvP. 
---
I would prefer they were all released.
---
Does it work like that?
---
You get QC now, and you lose it (or it becomes unwearable) if a new quest is released?
---
Ok thanks man!
---
Oh wow - nice dude!!
---
They’ve been prevalent for a good year now unfortunately:(
---
Imagine if everyone was so self absorbed they thought their mediocre achievements should be posted and recognized on this sub. We'd literally have 1000s of 99 and fire cape posts daily.
---
It's just not what this sub is made for.
---
You talk down to readers for their toxicity as if it hasn't been there from day 1.
---
Tyty!!

---
My accounts older than kbd mate and I used to smoke a lot of weed lol. Might have to jus wander on down to jagex hq and chain myself to their tank lol.
---
So if I read it correctly you have a high ping on all the servers?
---
Do you also have a high ping on other non osrs servers? (e.g. [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8))? If that is the case I would assume the problem is with your connection. Maybe someone is using netflix or downloading large files, perhaps if you use a wireless connection the problem might be solved by using a wired connection. I am kinda grasping at straws here since I don't have a lot of information. If you only have a high ping when you connect to the osrs servers than I am clueless.
---
It's just memorisation, takes longer to learn than vorkath so yeah may as well stick with that unless you want a pet or you're an iron.
---
Painful

please can this meme die

Inferno's like getting plugged attempt after attempt before you finally pull a fast one and plug the plug-ee

Yep, if a new quest is released you lose ability to wear or operate the cape until you finish it.
---
sure and catacombs of kourend is not in Zeah but underneath it XD
---
just buy from ge
---
Okay, prolly just gonna sell it then. Thanks man
---
But can you hold boots with combat stats? :D

That was the original intention of the comment, yes. I couldn't come up with anything clever so I wrote the last bit normally and left the Grub bit at the start.

You do not need high agility for MM2, your fail rate in the agility obstacles is determined mainly by whether you guessed the right patch or not, if you didn't you're falling anyway so just do it whenever. I did the agility route on a low level account with 65 agility with no issues.
---
Didn't this happen to someone else like a year ago? The previous post even got a JMod reply offering to come and tele them to the other side of the gate. 
---
Even after that they didn't fix it. Classic Jamflex.
---
Lol look at this
---
I agree with the other comments, there should not be one added an "use your eyes" etc.
---
 However, one thing that may help is as the mole starts to burrow, right click it, wait a second or 2 then click attack. Your character will probably run in the general direction of where the mole is. I have not tested this personally though so it may not work.

&gt; But strictly speaking the average player doesn’t have a fire cape...

only if you include f2p which would be a retarded thing to try to do here. i don't want to see 50 carbon copies of the same worthless post every single day, and neither does anyone else.

Literally me after my 8th try the other day. 😂

I know what you mean, but where do you live where 3/4 of an hour at a minimum wage job pays for memb? Here I have to work 2 hours to pay for it. Got to love the US National minimum at 7.25.

Adding to the f2p money makers. Corsairs cove is probably the fastest money in the game for f2p. Yes its later game f2p but you could safe spot.

What bolts are those? Diamond e? Also, what is your ranged level?

Idk maybe best is to be a full time farmer then :) Every hour doing a 20min herb run and for me i do willow run after every 3 hours. Not the best method maybe but idk. Have days where i do just half a herb run because too busy.

Similar things other people have said, here are things to work towards that gave me a wholesome mix of passively and actively gaining both cash and xp:
---
Passive
---
\-Tears of guthix
---
\-Birdhouse runs
---
\-Farming
---
Active
---
\-Barrows gloves
---
\-**Slayer** (train both melee and range, need range for eventual bossing. Mage too if you want zulrah/raids)
---
\-MM2 and DS 2
---
\-82 con for full house
---
That's two completely separate cases. TzHaar is technically underneath Karamja but isn't thematically linked in any other way than the volcano. It has completely different art style, culture, mobs, gameplay etc. It even has a bank and cooking places etc making it a self contained area. 
---
Catacombs are just an extension of The Great Kourend, it has no separate identity, it isn't self contained. It doesn't have a bank, it doesn't have a separate government. It doesn't have a different currency, you can only train combat and slayer there etc. 
---
So many differences. One is a distinct self contained area that just happens to be underneath Karamja and the other is a dungeon extension with only a single type of content that is clearly a part of The Great Kourend.

I can hear Reposts though

This took me about 2 weeks to read. Low level achievements are pointless. All that shit should be in a megathread.

Nice accomplishment! Currently inching my way toward that goal while working on other things as well. How consistently were you questing?

Dude tree runs are so easy. Half hour a day for a month and your at 90 farming lol

It’s a massive accomplishment for your first completion. When you look back it obviously isn’t that significant. Still, celebrate people’s victories as I’m sure you’d want them to celebrate yours

Apologies for the shit quality, got a smoldering stone (1/32,000 drop rate at hell hounds). By far the rarest drop I’ve ever gotten on an account.

Every once in a while, a couple of my friends and I will throw on some shit gear and run around the wilderness. It's actually so much fun and feels like the old days of rs. Basically just exploring and messing with people for an hour or so.

It's nice to get away from the no xp-waste, try hard aspect of the game - even though we usually get slaughtered by a group of pkers.

Yeah I’m stopping at 85 at end of clan skill of the week. Then I won’t be doing it for a long time... until my other stats are finished at least

I imagine OP was watching a pile of items get larger and larger

except any other client tries to play nicely with Jagex and generally follow their demand, and thus features they have are considered appropriate by Jagex themselves. Jagex thought Zulrah plugin was unfair and asked Runelite to remove it, which they did. But then comes this plus thing and adds it back -- they did something Jagex had explicitly objected to in the past, which puts it squarely on the cheating area.
---
They are lost forever

What was you kc for it?

Very funny when fighting in multi and using this prayer. Especially clan fights lol. Bullets flying everywhere.
---
If that’s what it takes, I can totally welfare this. Only have bandos chest though. Should I sub in veracs skirt for pray bonus? Other than that, I have all the other welfare things you mentioned, with the exception of the zerk ring(i). That one wasn’t too hard to get.
---
because you advertising the client is really helping
---
But FFA is cancer.
---
If its 1:1, str basically always wins. Only exceptions are if ur cannoning as cannon accuracy is ur accuracy, but most mobs have low enough defense its not enough to make up for the lost of str. Cant remember em off the top of my head.

How did you know he was a HCIM?

How has nobody seen that the same guy posted this twice yikes
---
I went flawlessly through Regicide, even with barell and was boosting from 51 agility, but I wasted 2,5h on UP with 40 agility :)))
---
fire cape is not hard, hell practice on rs3 to get used pray switching etc... its practically the same thing just you do more damage so you can blow through the lower waves
---
That shouldn’t be possible since one of the diary reqs is to use your qpc emote somewhere
---
Are you ironman? Or why go for points
---
I wouldn’t consider it advertising if I’m saying don’t use it because you’ll get hacked. I’ve seen 15 posts in the last few days of people getting hacked from it, hopefully this will prevent at least 1. 
---
Also if someone reads this, downloads the client and gets hacked any way, that’s their fault for being an idiot.
---
Runelite doesn't work either and OSRS's website seems to be down ... did the servers crashed? :°
---
I would pay more than $11 for this game

It's disappointing to me that you feel this way about the wilderness. I don't want to lose something that's part of the game that gives players more ways to enjoy it. The content in the wilderness is very rewarding for the requirements but it wouldn't be in the game without the risk of dying. I also don't think you would be banned for attacking a clan at revs in full bronze, but you could know more than me on that.
---
New pc is the only way to be safe
---
I picked up a bunch of fruit, there's a bank right there. But after like two inventories of stuff it was like 2500 coins, so I stopped.
---
some people dont care, if you have friends to raid with theres no need to join a clan or discord. Also with tbow it's easy to solo most content
---
You can't get achievement cape before all quests
---
I think so. They're good enough usually even below 90 hp.
---
Added tips on 3rd party clients too:
---
Runelite+ is not real
---
Normal Runelite does not have a zulrah or jad plugin
---
Sorry, I just edited the post. Only looking for quick XP.
---
Nothing interesting happens.
---
there were people making tons of money selling those plugins from what i rad runelite plus killed that market but putting it all open source. Those plugins are gonna be around no matter if Jagex wants them removed or not. I watched a video of that zulrah plugin and it didn't play the game for them all i saw it doing was showing the person where to stand and what to pray next. Which a person will learn eventually through time it just helps the new players to memorize the rotations. I don't call that cheating.
---
Got 99 yesterday, no pet. Good luck.
---
that's exactly how i felt to with my agility cape. I got mine as my first max when i was only 1050 total level, and i of course keep on getting bombarded with "who hurt you" comments and the like

All events in RS are synchronized around the game tick (\~0.6s). All data sent to/from the server occurs within this span of time, continuously. Depending on how the data is processed server-side, any GE offers input within the same game tick could be considered to have occurred simultaneously.
---
Funny, I remember a similar story about old school...
---
Imagine if 80% of this sub was mid-level achievement posts though. You wouldn't say that would be a healthy environment for this sub would you? Achievement posts are good in moderation but the vast majority of users in this sub dont want the ratio between loot/achievements posts to other content to be 10 to 1.

You'll probably screw up the first few waves, but it's hard to lose the first few waves anyway, and the game isn't too hard once you get the hang of it. I recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll6zPiPRc6A) and reading through the wiki guide so you have a decent idea of how to play. It might be a bit frustrating at first, especially if your team doesn't communicate well, but you can have a fighter torso in 3-4 hours (less if you're skilled/lucky) and I think it's pretty fun once you know what you're doing.  
---
Also remember CHAD when fighting the queen.
---
the brain damage they give you makes scaping less tedious
---
Last time I was legitimately trying I don't think I always died on wave 31, so glad to see the data backs me up haha
---
I might be wrong, but I thought the majority of those devs are working on rs3. That adds some salt
---
Americans can’t roll for shit.
---
Please reply to me so I can block you...
---
I'll say what I want, fight me
---
Yeah that is true too, with g-mail 2fa they need your phone number to get your code, which is near impossible, cause you have to quess the phone numeer and all that jazz
---
My mans a natural :\] It actually took me a depressingly long time to get my first PK back in pre-eoc, i think it was multiple months before I got a kill. Good shit man and keep it up &lt;3
---
m8 skotizos infected yer screen, fs lad
---
That is not aloud my friend. That's real world account trading and most definitely a bannable offense.
---
Good to see no filter for ash memes, those r great
---
every 2 months i try it 5-6 times in a row and then give up lol
---
Atleast it gets easier everytime because my gear gets better everytime
---
Jad isn't the problem, I just can't stand the 62 first waves
---
I've never done raids but wanting to get into it.  What combat lvl is good  to do it?
---
This took longer than 30 seconds to read.
---
Are you OK?
---
*Filters all of them*
---
r/2007scape: "I've got... nothing left!"
---
dude weed 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Yup
---
Pin the program "Snipping Tool" to your taskbar and utilize it for high quality screenshots :)
---
Lots of people have alts and get the cape on their first try due to previous experience also
---
I think it's funny how there is such a separation between individual skill capes and max cape. People in game always point out tough capes like rc, mining, and agility but I never see anyone say anything about max capes lol. (not a max btw)
---
Add this shitty warding into runecrafting. Skip all this bullshit that runecrafting is creation of times not crafting armor. Ffs fletching means making arrows and somehow making bows or crossbows  count as fletching.
---
Max runecrafting
---
Only bannable if you get caught
---
I'd really recommend watching youtube guides on it. The worst thing about barbarian assault is people do what you described: they jump in without knowing what they're doing. This makes the waves take an extremely long time and makes everyone frustrated.
---
Here's a tl;dr for each role:
---
Attacker: Kill all of the penance fighters and rangers. You **must** use the correct attack style (shown on the interface) in order to damage them
---
Collector: Collect as many eggs possible. You must collect the eggs shown on the interface
---
Healer: Use poisoned food (retrieved from the healer machine near the start of the wave) on the penance healers. Kill all the penance healers. You must use the correct food on them in order to damage them.
---
Defender: Drop food on the penance traps located on both sides of the room. The best side to use (generally speaking) is the east side. This is the role people have the hardest time with, but it's actually one of the quickest and easiest roles once you realize what to do. The general idea is to drop the correct food (shown by the interface) on the trap, and then drop a piece of food every few squares to "lure" the penance runner towards the trap. 
---
The biggest help you can be in BA is making sure you call. If you don't know what calling is, it's basically whenever the interface changes, you need to select the right option on your horn in your inventory. This tells the other role in your team what the correct item is to use for their role. You need to call each time it changes, which I believe is every 30 seconds. If you don't do this people will leave your team and flame you.
---
There's lots of good guides on each role if you want to get more into the specifics.
---
runescape is technically nothing more than an advanced cookie clicker or idle game. skillcapes only show the amount of time
---
someone was able to do the same thing over
---
Feel free to add me. “Razmuz00” - combat 119. Always down for some pvm. Got slight amount of Raids experience (About 40kc ish), Im down to teach you what i know, but i am still learning myself. Active basically every day, However wont be able to pvm until monday as Im visiting my parents atm.
---
Cave Horrors are only NPC which drop black mask, haha.
---
Without knowing your stats: blowpipe, a magic shortbow (I) with rune arrows, a non imbued version with rune arrows, rune cross bow with broad bolts, dorgeshuun crossbow with bone bolts. 
---
They have low ranged defense so mith darts would probably work too.
---
Don't let the haters get to you. Wear Runecrafting cape with pride! You've put all the hours into it so you deserve it!
---
Not denying that people have alts, thus why I said suggesting. Maybe I'm thick skulled but I would be willing to bet there are more cape buyers than alt inferno capes
---
Nah, you're overthinking it.
---
Um... Have you not heard of the spell "Lumbridge Home Teleport"? Costs no runes, and teleports you back to Lumbridge. When membership expires, your spellbook is reverted to default, so if you were on lunars or something, you always go back to lumby. 
---
Alternatively, just die and then go back to telegrab your stuff.
---
These bots are also logged in for very small amounts of time in any one session making them much more difficult to catch compared to accounts logged in doing the same thing for 24 hours straight.
---
This censoring meme has gone too far.
---
That... is actually pretty cool. In fact. I'd be cool with 25-50% of the worlds being like that.
---
Mid lvl main here Eli5?
---
I mean deciding to split with randoms is dumb idea imo if it's not a trusted clan member or friend.. Just do ffa if you don't have trusted team.
---
Not sure why people are downvoting for raising awareness. Maybe the idea of all advertisement is good advertisement, but at least people know it’d be their own stupid fault if they got hacked.
---
I blame jagex being powerless against a pvp clan
---
This is not a good idea
---
Haha, no dramen staff yet I assume? :p
---
Zammy spear is a great crush weapon if you can't afford bludgeon.
---
Probably not
---
Haha not yet. I hope he sees these comments and makes It happen.
---
"30 second rant"
---
"this took me 4 minutes to type"
---
elaborate
---
The negativity here is what prevents OSRS from growing, but the basement dwellers who dominate this subreddit don't want it to grow anyway.
---
BTW the shill is actually called 
---
Runecraft and NOT Runecrafting
---
Don't bother, it'll just get recovered by the original owner.
---
And thats a good thing
---
It isn't the staple of his other videos but it's more about the principle. I don't want to condone the tactic of using  drama for views and in that light feel it is hypocritical of me to support him despite it. Same reason I don't watch KempQ as a result of it even though it doesn't (based off this subreddit) seem like he mentioned it even once.There are also plenty of actors/artists I don't watch/listen too because I don't agree with various things they've done completely unrelated to their acting/music. 
---
I get that some people love YouTube drama, and many others don't care about it, and they are welcome to that opinion. I'm also allowed to have my opinion that it's a shame that due to their actions I can no longer in good conscience watch a player who does bring out interesting content.
---
Join meow talk. Tell them teq from Reddit sent you , they have a wealth of knowledge about the game. I'll be in the cc when I leave work today and can help you out as well.
---
I'm saying it's bad but it definitely should be expected
---
No worries Ive used it before for a long time and you can ask me anything you need. I believe in giving you all the information you need, the decision however is yours to make :)
---
As many as possible so I can go on as long as I want :) Solos are the only way to go if you're grinding for 99, you barely get interrupted and it's super nice construction exp!
---
Yea, idk. I just figured it would be a good idea to make some posts to raise awareness, hopefully to help those, even if its their own faults. We all know Jagex isn't going to do anything about some of these issues. I'm just going to give up though. Survival of the fittest.
---
I'm close to that in 3 months. However, someone new with minimal game knowledge is going to be nowhere near efficient. I think 1000 total is reasonable
---
OK, but have you considered that I'm miserable and only play this game because I hate myself...so if anyone is enjoying it they're basically taking a slight at me?
---
A 30 second rant that took you 4 minutes to type.
---
TL;DR
---
Suppose it depends on your kills per hour no?
---
I believe it doesn't do it if you're in a F2P area, as otherwise it would lead to a lot of people who F2PK but have members for better training options to be randomly teleport to lumby from the GE because they didn't earn a bond PKing.
---
The highest (for buying) and lowest (for selling) offer is always first priority. Your buddy had the highest offer in the GE when someone decided to dump a bond for below his offer price so he got the bond. Length of time his offer was in the GE did not give him priority over any other buyers, only the price his offer was at.
---
Hol up
---
I made my ultimate as a joke. Fully green, speedo pants, gay leather jacket with twirly light green mustache; the ugliest character I could make and named him "Schnoblin" like a mix of schnoze and goblin.
---
Was planning on keeping it FTP and not going anywhere with it; just holding the acc name cause it was funny.
---
... I'm now unironically invested in going for an untrimmed herblore cape. 1350~ total.
---
And every fucking day I'm discovering new things and new goals, big and small, to unlock and make my life easier/ more efficient, and it's not even like "once I do the grind I have it forever"- I have to plan on whether I wanna drop it or re-grind, or if there is a way to store it, etc.
---
For example, I COULD go for a slayer helm or a dragon defender, but I can't store it anywhere. But I COULD ge the Stash unit that holds both those things, along with a dragon battleaxe. But then I'll have to get the construction level for it. And for the construction level, I have to have a ton of money and a clear inventory, so for that I need to do a chunky grind that gets me money. But I could make the grind a lot cheaper and FASTER by completing Dragon Slayer II to use the mythical cape method- but to do that I'd need... Well...
---
Etc etc.
---
Like for instance rn I'm not (ever) completing Lunar Diplomacy cause there's a method called Lunar herblore which gives really good exp out of marentills and guams; 2 otherwise trash tier herbs. I'm also able to get a free lunar staff any time I want so I don't need to do the Entrana shenanigans to get another one (which is really annoying if you have any weapons in your looting bag)
---
But not completing it locks me out of a lot of other content/ training methods, so it's like a big decision I have to make for the account and the "path" I take with it.
---
The ability to not bank still keeps the game grindy, but it puts way more emphasis on your agency as the player and your goals. It's not totally unreasonable either, like I thought it was gonna be.
---
It's actually **so fucking fun**. Runescape at its core isn't about the grinds, it's about the *reason* you do the grinds. It's about the mental landscape of the challenges and "aids" grinds it presents, and your choice on what you spend your patience on is a big part in what makes accomplishing those goals feel good.
---
I’m talking about Runelite+. Different then the Runelite everyone uses. Yes they are both open source.
---
The spec is tehnically an attack
---
Keyloggers are on your computer
---
&gt;  so that many many hours played were for nothing
---
Idk if its still active but ge services. Also a dude named Bulk Geotia.
---
Go a picture of your stats? I’m curious about your ranged/agility/thieving levels
---
Please submit links using the [link submission form](http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/submit).
---
Because people feel entilted to earn something for their time, despite the fact that it is complete rng
---
Have we heard anything of The Fremennik Exiles recently?
---
man if I could filter posts to just discussions and suggestions that would be amazing. And I actually like looking at shitposts. But a lot of the time the only thing I'm interested in is reading things like opinions, feedback on updates, creative suggestions, etc
---
It should be mentioned that before you actually do the raid, discuss with the group if everyone splits loot or keeps
---
OP telling people that they are literally not allowed to dislike these kind of posts lmao
---
This even happens in normal cc's. It's so god damn annoying, the clan chat isn't your personal fucking blog.
---
Do you really wanna know
---
Just because details matter here. Cut rubies?
---
(Litterally did this quest less than ten hours ago, made two rings and had to go back for more ore, but other than that it was fine for me)
---
&gt; They can't bot bosses like Telos, GWD2, or Rax. The only one possible would be Gregorovic in GWD2 but stupid high requirements for a bot.
---
You absolutely can, and I know of one or two people pushing their scripts further and further on Telos. One of them has finished every GWD2 boss.
---
High reqs doesn't mean anything, Jagex has shown to only be concerned with goldfarmers, targeting the most popular bot clients and scripts. High-level methods aren't goldfarmed, so why would Jagex waste their time searching for those mains, when the majority of the bots are farming cows/chickens/zulrah even.
---
High-end methods are the **perfect** thing to farm with a private client/script. They aren't profiled, and Jagex doesn't appear to give a shit about them.
---
Shit, didn't even realize it was that time of year again. Thanks!
---
People who’ve played this game for years forget how nice the “noobie” wins are. I agree with your rant.
---
I dont think people have a right to make fun of any achievement in this game, its a common joke these days to say people are sweaty nerds with no life, and yes some people are like that, but most arent. Free time and game knowledge can go a long way. Congrats on the rc cape! Im actually kinda jealous
---
Maybe in the 12th after he takes off his bulwark
---
BOTS ARE UNSTOPPABLE. ANYONE WHO SUGGESTS COMBATING BOTS IS AN IDIOT. THE VENEZUELEANS ARE LITERALLY LIKE THE REAL LIFE VERSION OF THE MATRIX HACKERS. WE SHOULD THANK OUR STARS THEY'VE DECIDED TO REIGN OVER OSRS AND NOT THE WORLD.
---
I got my normal mold of the ge and did it last night. This wasnt true for me.
---
Anyone could say this in any world
---
Amethyst for now, gonna do elemental for fashionscape
---
No, no, no... no Jmod.
---
Aren't Gem rocks decent XP/hour for people that aren't 3 ticking granite?
---
If game was fun at that time, it doesn't matter. And if it wasn't, then you're a fucking brainlet to play a game you yourself found boring and only did for some big accumulated xp numbers
---
I definitely have to ask for a PM in regards to comission prices. I'd love one!
---
Be the change you want to see in the world
---
People in this sub aren't ready for real life yet. They're telling you coins are just pixels, and yet get outraged at the mere thought of you holding more pixels than you should. Everyone's saying they'd never scam, and that no one would ever scam them.
---
I'm not saying scamming is good, but these people are either fake or real life's gonna hit them damn hard and soon.
---
The point is to flex on other clans.
---
Pmods are volunteers and they get shitted on, smh
---
Why the fuck would anyone do such a shitty grind like that? It's 2019, there's more xph methods than crafting laws.
---
Says who? What "content" to you?
---
Ok so it's not just me then. I thought I was going crazy and was sure this I had just entered it like a week ago
---
Ge surplus
---
Is there a way to post pictures in the comments thread? Until then... range 75, agility 63, thieving 60.
---
Oh congrats. Should have looked for a comment that you got it working. Have a good one.
---
still 2.5m/h
---
That's why I bring a stack of Iron Nails, so my enemy gets tetanus. With the anti-vaxx movement in full force, it's a really nice alternative win condition.
---
Yeah thank god you didn’t exaggerate that number. Imagine not using fire staff to high alch
---
I shot you a message!
---
\*influx of Iron Party People Pkers\*  
---
Wait... this is, everything I've ever wanted
---
Yeah this is a problem I could definitely see arising. I think you could take some measures to prevent that though, like assigning it to a specific world with a 500 lvl requirement maybe. Some thought would have to be put into it for sure though.
---
Some of these.. man. Like, I wanted to do miscellania the other day. Saw that it had a few requirements. Did fremenik trials. Went back to the guide... okay, needs heroes quest, let's look that one up... ok, that one needs 3 others that I don't have either. 
---
And... logged out.
---
I doubt botters would go through the effort of making their bot work on a single world
---
both ways about it really suck, if you get the rare that you wanted your expected to pot it. if you dont get a drop your more dependent on everything being put in the pot. i feel like they named the items to avoid this paradox of butthurt
---
I still have daealt or so in my bank for if I get the pet
---
What the hell are you doing with 250k fire runes. Also so what? No reason to train at wt after 99 for that
---
Maybe jagex should increase that number to like 1000?
---
I know I use RL+, it’s open source just like normal runelite surely some plugins are shady but it’s open source you can see it’s not a RAT
---
How I feel with my fire Cape compared to inferno.
---
Stay mad incel
---
No, I don’t think i will
---
Well thats an eyebrow raiser if its true. Do you have any documentation? I find it hard to believe these things could be such good gp if they were botted.
---
Nothing new.
---
They're on a free world.
---
The Twitch Prime promotion is also over.
---
Should result in an instant ban
---
Thanks
---
&gt;goblin boy
---
hahahahahaha wow
---
They cant detect zulrah plugin. It's an overlay lol.
---
Oh shit really? I'm 2260 total and i mostly wear my achievement diary cape. Ppl have never roasted my 'nolifeness'. 
---
I got 99 rc 2 months ago and i have never really worn it.
---
when i train agility I dont sit straight on my pc chair but watch series/movies instead
---
Gz
---
cope. ppl who have afked for an hr a day are maxed now. 99s and skilling posts sub post max are worthless now
---
B-E-A-UUUUUUTEEEFUL
---
Then what about the inferno?
---
To be fair, this is an idea Sirsugarbear originally came up with 6 months ago and mentioned on twitch. I've discussed it with him a bit but he doesn't really post to reddit much.
---
Ayyyy congrats man
---
of course its just harder to do if its a cc and not a disc of people you actually know (like that ever happens)
---
Last night I flinched the shadow of the storm quest boss wearing IM legs, mithril platebody black square shield black med helm and rune scimmy. Had a blast.
---
I've been doing barrows for weeks trying to get Guthans. Needed just the helm for about 150kc now.
---
Imagine deleting an entire project because someone doesn't wanna run to the store for a external hard drive
---
Yeah but consider I literally would not have gained any combat exp during that nmz week
---
I got $11 in
---
Zezima and Lynx Titan are brainlets? Ok then.
---
what if you dont care about that when all you want to see is funny runescape pictures?
---
holy fuck make this happen
---
Few things to think about...
---
We don't want kids buying bis gear with mummy's credit card when most people have to grind for there shit.
---
There is no point in making money in osrs if everything is just cheap/quest items and who wants to make cash just to do nothing but get buy-able skills to 99? I mean if things like the t bow or scythe was simply given after something like a new master master MASTER quest called Zeah Rises or some shit where it takes average 20 days to finish with 30 almost impossible bosses you have to kill tick perfectly (coming in 2030 btw) it fucks it because then cash is worthless.
---
What we need is items that require a medium to long quest line to be done in order to unlock them and a harder drop rate (the 1/5k from vorkath was great imo if that shield was 1/512 it would be 2m right now instead of 30m).
---
Problems imo are its not rare enough too many people are maxed now and like a million people have 99 slayer for jagex to doing these 1/512 drop rates its like 1 dropped every 10 seconds at the rate the bosses are being killed and when there is not anyone left to pay 50m for an item it drops to 45 then 40 and keeps going...my biggest problem with this is the fact that its locked behind something that new players can not do for years and experienced players don't really do ds2 with an alt for money making so its like the main experienced player base all have f gloves now there is nobody left to buy them who can use them.
---
T bow/scythe is worth bank because more and more are duloing bosses with there alts so there is always demand for them and they are rare...i feel if instead of ds2 they were locked behind a new quest that was not such a heavy req it would make more sense because imo rfd is a nightmare enough to do for all your alts nobody in the right mine (unless you are playing all day because you don't work or you are playing for work) will re do ds2 to get there alts f gloves when you can smash out rfd 2x faster and not have any issue with bosses (i mean ds2 boss is not hard imo but not everyone is me lol and im not saying im woox im saying average experienced players can beat it 1st-3rd try and then every try after that)
---
The balance is the emblems bro
---
What haha? Are you maybe just a random text generator or something?
---
This guy knows what he is doing, he is hiding his name and hitpoints...... nice try hackers
---
you can also feel free to just not do raids
---
They’re the same account tho
---
Usually they require proof of agreeing to split for a case to be posted. Would you mind linking your friend's case? If what you're saying is true my opinion of RW will be changed
---
My next 99 is smithing lmao
---
Oh man I haven't been on Twitter in years, but this is probably a worthy cause.
---
I can see this working to some extent, but how it will be implemented will take some serious work, especially engine wise.
---
The transfer of items wouldn't be a massive issue since they have a similar thing with the rotten potato. But implementing this for when an Ironman PK's will take some time to implement correctly. Issues that can pop up is when people are using the hp glitch thing and where the items would be stored in the meantime.
---
They could use a separate bank to store the items from ironman pk'ing and dump them into the party chest. This could be on a timer or when a certain value has been met. This would help with the world issue and we know that they can implement it.
---
This effect should be something ironmen can toggle since there are those who use alts to pick up the loot.
---
Would be fun to see this being implemented, but it will take time, and there are tons of other PvP related things they are asked to fix/implement already.
---
Honestly surprised it's so difficult to tell what your streak is currently ingame. It's even inaccurate with runelite 30% of the time
---
It’s free to choose whatever, some worlds are dedicated to certain countries which makes them usually have a lower ping to the people in those countries. Personally I have my home world but move around for event worlds
---
Keep in mind, it's completely normal to have 1-8 attempts on it before you kill it. But you're fine on stats.
---
Grats on d chain :)
---
Wait. Really? Smh jamflex
---
That's what makes it fun though
---
Then the party room will completely die.
---
More like between 1-2 AMIRITE
---
Not even joking I have nightmares about losing my graceful even though it’s not that hard to get. I just would dread doing the agility all over again to get those marks lol
---
I agree. Similar could be said for Grand Exchange, but NMZ just seems far more offensive.
---
Or do a daily drop party (probably twice daily because of time zones) as there probably won't be much loot coming from this. Who knows though?
---
No it isnt. When you instasell something (eg throw it in for 1 gp) it sells to the highest offer in the ge.
---
Bonds are a 1 per slot thing so its hard to set up lots of buy offers and sell offers which means theyre very prone to getting dumped. Kid with moms credit card isnt gunna wait a day + sitting at ge to sell his 50 bonds
---
You fuckers are delusional if you think that shit is healthy for the game there's a reason people barely pk anymore
---
Mobile gang in tears
---
This is the quality I come here for.
---
I do normally, but not everyone wants to FFA. If they say “I’d rather split” I will, but I’ve had that happen and had a few items yoinked so at this point if it’s worth more than like 500m I’m just keeping it. I’ll split everything else but a tbow is mine. Like 90% of the time the random would do the same so I wouldn’t feel guilty if it happened.
---
Wow. Thank you very much for the prompt and helpful replies. Looking forward to learning more and maybe coming across you in-game. Thanks again!
---
No lol
---
It may have not been a bot
---
Would it perhaps encourage fally party room bots to be created to pick up loot? Could be one possible negative, just spitballing here though
---
What in the shit?
---
A+ title OP
---
Yeah I get it now. I was thinking there are like 4 scenarios but there are actually more like 8 with the whole "buyer vs buyer" "seller vs seller" thing. I think that's what finally made it click for me. Thanks man
---
Ah thanks for the info! Feels like I’m getting the best I can for now then, until my stats or gear upgrade. My PB is 2:04 but my average kill is definitely nowhere near that. I’m missing the Anguish and Suffering (no imbued heart either but I’m assuming that’s less commonly used). I am also using the regular Trident. And yep okay I’ll look at how to get better magic xp, I don’t quite like the idea of splashing at these levels haha.
---
Thank you!
---
Gzzzzz!
---
peepocheer
---
Thank you
---
That was hyper inflated because of mobile launch brining in tons of noobs
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Is it really an abuse? On a regular account you would just pick it up. If you get Pked or anti-ed, why shouldn't you lose your items?
---
would it be possible to turn a heart rate monitor into something like this? click on every heartbeat, high alch as youn as you're not dead
---
You would be able to get a Duiral321 pet
---
Sorry for your losas
---
Theres not really that many scenarios. Its just a logical exchange prioritizing fiing “best” offers
---
Only emblem updrages
---
Q
---
Imagine having a 2 factor authentication system set up in such a way that you can instantly disable the second factor if you have the first.
---
That isn’t 2 factor authentication at all, and it’s a joke to call it that or to have a system like that in place at all. This is why Authenticator delay is necessary, and the current state of authenticator is a joke.
---
If, for your customers to be secure, they need to be well versed in security themselves, then you’ve kind of failed your end of the bargain from a dev/business standpoint.
---
Just amazing to see the revenue compared to the staff/support. Truly astonishing.
---
I think that many people have this "mentality" where they say to themselves that ok itll be a waste being a member so lll get 60 in all melee stats in the most gruesome way rather than be a member and complete like 4 quests and you have ability to hold a rune scim and 30 str from a lvl 3 acc then easily afk at sand crabs. Or they think that they should do all f2p quests and then become a member which is still ridiculous
---
as per a post a long time ago i promised 5m to whomever had the closest guess. If you can provide me with proof of your guess then come claim your GP :)
---
So I’m combat lvl 65 and I just got an elite clue scroll from a birdhouse. Is there any chance I’ll be able to complete this? Or will I have to fight something I have no chance against?
---
Jagex is a billion dollar company who is perfectly able to support oldschool runescape more than they already are. The problem is that when OSRS was polled, Jagex promised a certain amount of services and funds allocated to upkeeping such a project, but they neglected the need for customer service because, well, it wasn’t guaranteed that osrs would succeed or last. But what baffles me is that despite the major success and playerbase accumulated by osrs, they haven’t really adjusted their dedication to it, resulting in certain aspects like customer support lacking.
---
It could turn new players away from the game if they can't even try it without installing an app on their phone.
---
Tree runs/fruit tree/hespori, herb runs, cacti, and calquat is what included in my calculation. Tree/fruit tree runs are the ~30%. Now if I was doing all the highest chance (cactus, fruit trees, belledona, mushrooms) it gives like an 80ish% chance of getting it before 99 but that takes like 7 months iirc
---
absolutely not. this is a terrible idea.
---
Yeah I tried that, but I hadn't even started any quests until I was attack base 70, so going through the 100 or so super easy quests was getting really boring for very little reward.
---
*demonic laughter erupts from screen*
---
you'd be shocked at how many zulrah bots there are. That combined with summer time. Yeah it's definitely taken a hit as of late
---
Ahh i see. Good luck grinding :)
---
Incoming biggest spade drop part in RS history
---
Farm some giant keys and kill Obor for a chance at the club maybe.
---
I had the same problem at first but if you find the right zoom, you get used to it
---
Runelite+ is a legit client until jagex decides to address 3p clients
---
When runelite devs start making arbitrary decisions around what they, not jagex think is “ethical” obviously other capable people will start making plugins that arent outright banned.
---
All rl+ is doing is making what are normally private paywalled plugins public. Which if anything is what all clients should be doing to force jagex to respond.
---
Wtf.... No way man
---
&gt; and it's not even like "once I do the grind I have it forever"- I have to plan on whether I wanna drop it or re-grind, or if there is a way to store it, etc
---
This is what stops me from doing UIM, that and inventory management. The thing I love most about runescape is finishing something and now its done. I accomplished it and most likely wont need to go back to it. I am a fan of questing for this reason, and in games I really enjoy, I often go the completionist route. 
---
Ironman is so much fun. I just about maxed my combat on my main sans prayer. So now hes basically just a woodcutting alt cuz that the lowest effort thing I can manage while giving 100% to my ironman.
---
I've answered this in a different thread, but this would have no effect on inflation. As it stands anyone killed by an ironman can just go pick up their items again, so this would not be replacing a gold sink.
---
I'd love if they readded this!  This was how i got my full void on my original account.  So much fun!
---
I'm a visual learner and it helped me to see this "logical prioritizing" within the context of 8 different scenarios. Without showing what I'm talking about it would likely be difficult to explain but I could PM you the Excel I made to help myself if you really want. I don't think I'll ever need to look at it again now that I think about understand the priority but it really helped me get it.
---
But then the loot would be left for the very few people that do it and people would realize it and it wouldn't be dead.
---
Facts.  I've seen it happen first hand
---
It doesn't matter if U forget tho. I've had yew trees planted for months bc I got to a level of farming I wanted to and didn't really care for xp afterwards. It's probably top 4 or 5 favorite skills for me
---
Giant keys? Obor? :O
---
I can't remember which video unfortunately :( I think it was a high risk world at the GE. Literally one-smacks him. After a lot of shit talking.
---
Golden IM helmet ;)
---
winamp was other name
---
The description you offered showed clearly that your own computer was compromised. That is your fault, not the fault of Jagex
---
LOL cuz rs3 is trash! LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL i fuck!
---
I don't see that as much of an issue, but just delete a pker's gear upon death if killed by an ironman then. I'd be all for making gear be lootable only by the pker, ironman or not.
---
So now you only want your update to take place on a single total level world? Probably not even worth implementing at all then.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I like the original goal of yours
---
I have an iron in my clan chat who has 3 tbows and he hasn’t even dropped one of them (granted he solos CoX). I actually chuckled at “some groups will make them drop it” lmfao.
---
The money isn't leaving the game currently though. PKers that die to ironmen can easily retrieve their items after dying, beaning that they can PK with almost no risk whatsoever. If anything this just goes to make the wilderness, a place where players are supposed to be risking something, a little riskier.
---
I don't think that there are nearly as many logistical kinks as you would like to imagine, this would work fairly similarly to the bank keys in DMM.
---
That's such a stupid analogy. Bots are way worse than murder. ^^^^^/s
---
I didn’t actually describe anything about the scenario at all buddy your just here assuming lol. I said I got hacked that’s not a description of what happened at all...
---
Don’t most iron men pkers have another account they try to loot on? I just don’t see people trying to give up their loot when most Ironman pkers are unique builds to kill farmers and botters. Solid idea just wouldn’t work with the community
---
You can’t use it until you have so many Kudos with the museum.
---
The updates are shot down because the goal is almost never lets get more pkers fighting pkers. The goal is almost always let's get more pvmers and skillers in the wild for pkers to kill and it's super transparent.
---
hey man wait till u get the full set
---
But cure for cancer
---
They are still working on the right way to introduce this ground breaking item
---
I believe this is already the case, if an ironman does most of the damage to a mob but another played does damage to it, nobody gets the loot.
---
15). Don't stream on Twitch. From what I've heard, streaming on Twitch uses an unsecure network connection.
---
Reupload/Edit: fixed missing 1st scene &amp; fixed filesize.
---
I was thinking in my head that looting bots already exist; however, these looting bots would be able to get real loot rather than just leftover pots and ammo
---
gz beast
---
Seems like a useful gold-sink! It might give the economy a decent shove too.
---
According to doctordementoid, its not upto jagex to cater to a paying customer to help them with issues such as yours🤔
---
Just wipe the whole world every few months or so /s
---
You got hacked. That’s enough
---
Get pk'd, respawn in falador, go directly to partyroom and get your stuff back.
---
Dont worry at some point they will run out of numbers to add tho these accounts!
---
You can install the 2FA application on your computer too.
---
&gt;The money isn't leaving the game currently though.
---
Well you're sure as fuck going to concentrate and centralize it with this idea.
---
Bones to the dog? Big nono.
---
Just while the whole world every couple of months /s
---
Okay so what got hacked?
---
OP is the type of guy who would give his children 50$ for every C on their report card and wonder what went wrong when they reach adulthood
---
Also, "Vegan BTW" is catchy
---
So it's known to be a rat?
---
There are cases where a godsword can be used as a main weapon, but they are mostly flinching methods.
---
I think a way of not having it be abused is pool the items for a week and slap it out randomly within 1-7 days of collecting for that world... might need engine work for that though
---
Damn this is fantastic
---
Maybe just put it in a dedicated drop party that happens once or twice a day
---
np
---
Thank you for the advice !
---
Maybe set a timer on it. What i mean by this is that every x hour all the pked items from ironmen will be dropped at the party room. 
---
Not that you get a party room with only 1 or 2 pks
---
Yeah, that's the problem, PKing ironmen is currently almost no risk at all
---
Hello friend, it has been 1 hour
---
A goblin boy fitting in with the goblins... in lumbridge. HAHAHAHAHA Wow!
---
Also name checks out lmao
---
While I don't mind the idea, I think this would take an unreal amount of time to implement.
---
It would reward people for afk camping party rooms with multiple level 3 accounts, give bots an even easier mm method and just basically add another luck factor while making money in the game. It sounds like a good idea on the surface, but it could ruin a lot in the game.
---
If your account got hacked into, either your computer was compromised, and/or you released some of your personal information.
---
Either way that is your fault, not Jagex’s fault
---
Your examples steps the line on scam (maybe not by rules guidelines) and I don't see why it's not bannable. I don't take the increase of reports as valid reasonings; if it's wrong, it's wrong. And there are all type of shit like asking for bond to pay back with members stuff and other clear things, like pretending to be a noob when you know exactly you gotta go to ge to do it.
---
What if there were specific chests in the party room that iron men could send loot to that would give a flat even random roll on all pieces of loot in the chest and they could only be opened by a random event key? Honestly might be kind of OP but idk
---
I went straight to ultimate cause I felt like if I max an ironman I'll move onto it anyway
---
Was gonna say this post is a waste of time but i forgot you have a runecrafting cape, you already showed you don't care about your time
---
Neither of those happened so keep going, but I thought you already knew what happened?...
---
That just means no one is selling what you’re trying to buy at that price. The price listed in the GE gets you in the ball park of what the actually going price for something is, but there still has to be someone willing to sell that thing at that price. For items that move in small quantities over the GE because people rarely sell them the prices can be over inflated because someone realizes there is a market for them albeit in small quantities so they put the selling price higher than what is listed. You just have to fiddle with and be more liberal with your buying/selling prices or be very patient if you’re hard set on buying or selling something for a certain price
---
Even if im at 2 mill already? Getting the 1-2 mill shouldnt take the whole month right? Thanks for the info btw.
---
Can you turn a TzHaar task into a Jad task before actually killing Jad for the first time?
---
I meant like current day fuck ups, EOC was released in 2012 lol
---
How many ironmen do you expect to be pking regularly?
---
"ummmmm ACKSHUALLY......"
---
I agree people shouldnt be posting shitty comments on things. But thats what downvotes are for. Downvote shitty comments, also downvote posts of achievements you dont think are worthy of mention. Reddit has a built in rating system for what its users value, granted that gets fucked sometimes because of the hivemind, but use your vote, hide the post and move on.
---
I don't think a post like this is going to give the toxic folks even a second of self reflection. The subreddit is what it is, I like it for the memes, and for real discussion over game changes. Some people like to just see other people enjoying the game. I feel like its just a futile effort to try to get people to change their ways online, especially with an inflammatory worded post like this
---
My man Serene laying down the facts.
---
It does it requires membership, even if you do this 24/7 this will never pay for a bond on consistent basis.
---
Once again with the assuming haha. It’s funny
---
I think it’s a good idea, it can also be an item sink of sorts, the items that are pked can go to the ironman’s “party room” tab or something similar, and they can manually put items into the party room, and keep nice items as trophies. That way high priced items don’t automatically get given away.
---
woah there edgelord
---
Farming is the best!! After every slay task do an herb run, seaweed run, birdhouse run. Nice break in between
---
I got hacked on an old account once before i knew e-mail 2fa was a thing. E-mail database had a leak. So while i could have prevented it if i knew about e-mail 2fa, i didn't compromise my own account.
---
Yeah, first death is like "WTF just happened.", 2-4 deaths is like, "Okay, I'm learning the fight, try not to think about the cost of the items to pay for these runs." 5-7 is like, "Ey, I'm getting this down...if I didn't mess up at that one point, I might've had it." and the 8th try is like, "YESSSSSSSSSSSS I DID ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT".  
---
That feeling of finally beating a boss after have real cost to you....totally makes it worth it at the end. Just like Jad and many others.
---

---
Makes me think... What if player dots (white dots) never showed on Wilderness? Could spice things up
---
It could probably just go to a dedicated drop chest on a timer to drop once or twice a day
---
&gt; PK some scrub on my Ironman, get his sweet sweet +1
---
&gt; PM: NOOO please let me pick it up don't send it to the party room
---
&gt; Alright give my main 10m and I'll leave it
---
Berserker ring and archers ring. Both imbued
---
I know that’s tobacco. Weed shouldn’t even really be up here imo
---
Haha it’s always nice having a real discussion with someone about it. Don’t vote yes for me though. If they polled it as it was pitched in the dev blog I’d smash that no button so fast. I’m not even pro-warding. I’m just pro-the possibilities warding can bring if done right. Have a good one!
---
It would be a really cool little update if they have the time but honestly Ironman pkers are such a niche group I think it’d be tough to justify it if it’ll take any significant amount of time
---
Level requirements don’t mean anything. Bots can level up in a few days.
---
I'll complain til I get my dragon
---
I feel like OP made many good points on how issues could be avoided if adding this.
---
Just bring a single inv of bones and no gear, no risk
---
Get a new highscores page going for Ironmen accounts: Wealth Distributed to the Noobs of Glienor
---
You seem better at repeating buzzwords than making arguments.
---
lmao who the fuck prefers nitrous over weed
---
Oh fuck idk maybe because this is reddit and that's what this site is literally made for
---
If its on a specific timer to drop like twice a day then you wouldnt have to wait or hang out there, just head over when its supposed to start
---
On another note arcanists would make a cool mobile game
---
So you want to get rid of the one death related item sink that remains? Nty
---
Because all PvM content in PvP are badly designed and will never work without broken mechanics.
---
There’s no assuming here. There really aren’t that many ways this could have happened, and all of them are related to you doing a poor job of keeping your own account secure. If Jagex has experienced a leak, it wouldn’t be your fault. Since we know that didn’t happen, it has to be your fault that your account got hacked
---
Generally speaking, you'll find people hosting their house with altars that you can use for free. At higher levels once you have the money, maybe you can tip them, but for now, feel free to use it without paying anything.
---
nothing. if you want you can tip them, but its not required.
---
This is actually golden. Maybe I would pk
---
Looks like OSB
---
I'm gonna take my brews to the Tzhaar town road, i'm gonna Jad till i can't no more.
---
Well no risk other than time wasted if you get killed
---
Read your previous reply you assumed two things in it that I didn’t state anywhere. Which is why I’m not taking your dumbass seriously. Learn to read and not assume stuff in your own little world buddy.
---
And whats the difference between the home altars and chaos altars?
---
Not if you count when you used to play, since you are counting those days as well.
---
On the face of it I can understand why people feel these updates don't achieve the goal of having pkers fight pkers, but the reality is updates like this give people of all skill levels a reason to be in the wilderness and creating hot spots (good ones not half assed ones) does cause pkers to run into each other far more often. 
---
The thing is people who aren't interested in pvp don't see any of that because they aren't sticking around long enough to see it, they log out at the sight of a clan rushing into rev caves or a white dot logging in at chins, rarely do non pvp orientated players stick around long enough to see the knock on effect the wilderness "food chain" has, maybe that dot that logs into chins has another another guy log in to fight him after you teleport out, maybe they both had backup leading to a fight between teams, the same can happen at revs. 
---
If i'm being totally honest i'd rather see the older wilderness content updated and improved rather than brand new content being added for now, there's so much shit from the previous few wilderness rejuvenation's which is basically dead content for most players because of both easier and more profitable/useful options located outside of the wilderness, not to mention half of the content is either flawed due to safe spots or just placed in an awkward location.
---
Look at deadmanmode. If we support good ideas, jagex will figure it out. Maybe in a few years, but it could still be cool.
---
Oof, not cake day by the time I replied
---
Right? This guys an idiot
---
I mean using mind runes you only get about 5k xp before you have to interact with the client. More likely you're preventing less than that.
---
Use total lvl worlds, there are basically no bots in 1500 worlds
---
Homies full of shit lmao, RL+ has an active discord and pushes out updates all the time
---
99*
---
Big yikes, time to commit sudoku
---
all these people who laugh at RC capes will cry when we will finally pull removal of runes drops and rune ban rune shops!
---
So what looters do anyway? If ironmen pkers don't use an alt to pick loot looter bots will
---
You're so triggered dude, go start your Nazi club in the US &lt;3
---
Yesterday and today I did bronze to dragon.  3000+ tokens, and from 70-72 Str and 20-52 def
---
I hate combat, and my favorite skills are Hunter, Fishing, Runecrafting, Agility, Smithing/Mining... LOL
---
Here’s the retard assuming things again haha. Apparently according to this guy nothing is Jagex fault especially whenever a paying customer loses the account they were paying for. Hmmmm
---
By that logic you would get banned for using a mouse.
---
I'm dying lmao what the fuck OP has Amazon on his taskbar.
---
Why do they even care about drop trading anymore it was only ever really used to mule money between accounts that I know of and now you can run multi accs at once so do people still do it?
---
“I’m going to send you to the ~~shadow realm~~ party room”
---
You’ll have to be more specific. The non-aggression principle is at the core of voluntarism. First, don’t aggress upon anyone. Everything else is secondary.
---
We have an idea of what a free society will look like and how it might organize itself. As I said before though, you’ll have to be a bit more specific.
---
Slow!!!!!!!!!!
---
Or just get 1750+ total.
---
People still droptrade, but only if the stuff is coming from a btw cause they can't trade, and they don't use the party room. I haven't heard of anyone droptrading in osrs otherwise since you can just do a regular trade nowadays.
---
brave man waiting to do rc last.
---
What do you mean it won’t let you log in with authenticator?
---
&gt; Fight for them back? I could understand in multi yes but in singles the items would be picked up and the iron teleported out before you even have a chance.
---
It does not change that every player deserves the opportunity to fight back for their items. If you can quickly get back into high level multi to reengage or have are fighting with a team, having someone kill one of your guys and remove that loot from the playing field is cancerous design.
---
&gt;Do you work for Jagex and know the workload involved
---
Regardless of how fucking patronizing and garbage this argument is, yes, this is fucking massively problematic because it would completely shit on the entire pvp meta.
---
The problem is people can pk ironmen risk-free right now. The wilderness should be dangerous for everybody, at every time, and if you are pking an ironman it is not dangerous anymore.
---
" because your overweight-living-in-your-mother’s-basement-playing-12hours-a-day-stinking-of-BO fat arse doesn’t"

"Can’t we please just go back to the times when this sub wasn’t such a toxic place"
---
yeah bud you definitely aren't toxic
---
Max cape is the best looking cape
---
What? I've never heard of this. I've had authenticator from day 1 and I've never had a problem with mobile.
---
How can you think about RuneScape with that view?
---
I'll keep complaining til I get my dragon lol
---
If you have to explain the joke, it's not a very good joke

U fished for longer than it took me to 200m cooking cooking only anglers you mad man
---
yeah lol i noticed it and thought i was on the wrong sub, i started playing again almost a year ago

They used to do it in RS2 too, he's probably talking about that since droptrading really isn't an issue anymore.

🦀 DEVALUING MY 20 ATTACK DEFENSE PURE 🦀
---
If your range and magic aren’t 99 train attack first
---
You can train defense with defensive casting or long range. 
---
That’s what I did.
---
You should try to find someone whos starting out aswell to spar in tourney worlds while theyre up. Really good way to test builds and practice clicks
---
Take a dds to kill the wizard (or blowpipe for elite/master), spade, clue, stamina, and a glory. If someone attacks you drop the spade or drink the stamina, nothing lost.
---
Why not just use lash and train both? It’s shared experience and I am assuming the use of a whip here. At the end of the day it gets the exp needed

Yo, I hope you find everyone. That'd be dope!
---
Imagine getting attacked in wildy and telling the pker there's a spade spawn in Falador.
---
If an ironman kills someone then yes i agree, they should not be able to go back and loot their stuff if they died (person the ironman killed). 
---
So yes..i agree there. BUT you still need to understand you chose that game mode willingly and knowingly the mechanics of it.. Its not this change in specific thats the issue but it's ALL the "suggestions" that are to make life "easier" or whatever for an ironman that i take issue with because it is NOT the "normal" game play mode/style. They already cater to ironmen with past updates, everyone knows it. This should NOT be a thing.
---
Problem is that most of the time, the accounts who are spamming got hacked
---
How is this a good idea? I’m just imagining 200 lvl 3 bots waiting for balloons
---
Can't they just go to the wildy and loot the stuff anyway? What's the difference between the party room and the wilderness o.o
---
Imagine having to do 500 beginner clues if you want that cosmetic
---
noooooo thank you mate

He’s had me banned for a while over some goofy shit

^hahahaha ***WOW***
---
“Spite these pkers by handing shit out commie style” yeah sure the pkers are really suffering at the hands of ironmen right now fuck off you’re an arrogant elitist asshole.  You’re probably also the first guy to comment “tHE WiLDerNess Is SUPposseD tO bE DaNGerous” whenever an ironman complains about being pked
---
zammy wine spot is super nice tho for IM. pretty hard to get any level of bulk zammy wines, but i can almost for sure live pkers because its in singles and all you have to do is get to fire giants. also its gated by hard wildy diaries so there wont be hella people doing it, or tons of people hunting them
---
The obvious reason is that you can't smith black gear, so you can't smith a black Hasta. Also the black spear itself is one of the most obscure items in the game.
---
No. 2FA can be done with an app. I use Authy myself, but it just follows a [standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm)
---
**Time-based One-time Password algorithm**
---
The Time-based One-Time Password algorithm (TOTP) is an extension of the HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm (HOTP) generating a one-time password by instead taking uniqueness from the current time. It has been adopted as Internet Engineering Task Force standard RFC 6238, is the cornerstone of Initiative For Open Authentication (OATH), and is used in a number of two-factor authentication systems.
---
Because of latency, both network and human, and unsynchronised clocks, the one-time password must validate over a range of times between the authenticator and the authenticated. Here, time is downsampled into larger durations (e.g., 30 seconds) to allow for validity between the parties.

In order to split on iron you'd use an alt to pay them their split, and if they got a drop they'd have to give your alt gp from the split. That's how it works, but I don't understand the point because your alt needs to be rich af in case you get big drops consecutively and if your alt is already rich why would you want splits on it?
---
You have to complete a wildy clue scroll armed with only a spade before you can be cured

There’s only 9-15 worlds that have 200~pings for me so those are my only options for pvm/click intensive activity.

There’s no need to be an ass to others about their “inefficiencies”, but it’s pretty satisfying to know that you’ve figured out how to do something in the best possible way, and it’s human nature to want to help others in good faith. A lot of people on the receiving end of that lump it as some kinda of efficiency supremacy culture, and that’s usually not the case.
---
What counts as “best” may not necessarily be the fastest depending on how you like to play, but for some people it is and thats fine. There are also lot of people that are happy to hear about new things they’ve not come across.
---
Damn, 250 runite bolts is a steal!

Nothing. Can’t say it’s safe to use or not and there are other clients out there too, this is the one I used today but I have uninstalled it and will no longer be using since I just wanted to try it out and bring attention. Download anything (including Runelite) at your own risk
---
This entire comment section: Fuck off I'm keeping it! No that's a dick move you're an asshole! Nah some guy scammed me once so I deserve to scam other people! No you don't you're not being honorable and you'll get blacklisted! Who cares I'll just change names! Why would you even play as a group with splitting if you don't intend to split?! Because they might do it to me, so I'm doing it to them first! Totally not a scummy shitty person though right! Except I actually am and I admit it but I'm not!
---
I don’t think you understand the conversation.
---
Imagine Botting a skill you get to 99 by doing slayer, the one skill most people like. Yikes.
---
Bring more brews/restores than food.  I had a few tuna potatoes for phase 1 and after that used just brews and restores.  Did it at 76 ranged, 79 hp, 60 prayer
---
With 94 wc I get like 60-65k xp an hour. I think wc guild is definitely better because of the invisible +7 boost
---
Yeah just use home Tele in 44 wild thanks for the advice!
---
Iirc wc boosts past 99 do nothing, so if you are 92+ wc, it'd be the same rates
---
But you brought a ppot along.
---
Wowwww
---
&gt; Stealing to feed a starving child is not always wrong for a lot of people. 
---
Then they are wrong. The only consistent moral position is the non-aggression principal. Consistency &gt; feelings.
---
&gt; Depends who you’re stealing from and what you’re stealing, an example of why a black and white absolute law would not be fair at all in many people’s opinions.
---
No, it doesn't. Context here would determine how severe your wrong act was, not if the act was wrong. Theft is always, to some extent, wrong. 
---
&gt; Also I just find it weird that your perception of the legal system is that all cases taken to court are going to cripple your life as if everyone’s going into court over million dollar cases.
---
It doesn't have to be a million dollars. The average US citizen doesn't have 10k to spare. Even now without legal debts, most US citizens will die working. No retirement. Even if you somehow get solid legal representation in a criminal case against the government, and it "only" runs you 5 figures, this would cripple the best bulk of people. 
---
And that's if you're insanely lucky. A criminal case against the government is far more likely to run you into six figures. We're talking about paying off a fucking house in cash type of costs here. 
---
**and you're innocent AND not even guaranteed not to go to prison in addition to having your financial life annihilated**. 
---
&gt; The vast majority of court cases are over small petty crimes like a speeding ticket that wasn’t payed or something similar.
---
Clearly I am not talking about petty "crimes" that you don't require a lawyer for. 
---
&gt; It is not the case that most court cases mean you need to sell your house to have enough money to defend yourself, not at all.
---
Most **criminal** cases involve this, and FYI, this is why so many ordinary innocent folks take plea deals. Because they know they'd likely win in court, but the costs are so staggering that it's still an overwhelming loss. 
---
&gt; And lastly I’m not sure what you’re obsession with false accusations is. The only case of false accusations actually being a problem is when it involves corruption inside the legal system, or it involves accusations of sexual offences. 
---
Nope. Like I said, most people in prison have taken plea deals. Most charges never go to trial because of the ludicrous costs. If you're innocent on, say, murder, you're offered a 3-year deal or a multi-month trial with a six figure cost to prove your innocence. What do you take? The latter = your life is over. You're free but sleeping under a bridge. 
---
If you're innocent and not a multi-millionaire, the only logical choice is taking the plea deal. At least then when you serve your unjust time, you have the money you earned your whole life left and maybe there's a chance left at happiness. 
---
&gt; an absolutist system isn’t going to prevent corruption.
---
Yes, it would, because my system holds virtually no power over the innocent. It's so simple that lawyers wouldn't be needed. You're falsely accused? Defend yourself easily at a cost of zero dollars, go home. 
---
&gt; For all the people getting falsely accused there are just as many, if not likely more, people lying when defending themselves and getting away without punishment. Sure that is not just, but how is an absolutist system going to help this.
---
I'd rather a thousand guilty go unpunished than one innocent be punished. And as I stated, if you're accused of a serious crime, the system will destroy your life. Guaranteed. One way or another. So our current system punishes more innocent than it does guilty.
---
This is an ok stopgap but,
---
This doesn’t get rid of the issue at hand though. Bots are rampant and ruining f2p
---
No it really wouldn't. Those bots would be far far better off camping edge and looting there.. which they already do. There's barely any ironmen pking, let alone on a concentrated world that would provide any profit
---
This is old as hell
---
That defender is kinda a big difference to the relative dps between the two.
---
It’s so dumb
---
Byte code is compiled code, which is the literal opposite of open source. Just because you can compile something does not make it open source. You can compile runelite "runelite" and it isn't open source because in reality you're only compiling part of runelite, the other parts are precompiled bytecode.
---
Screw all the haters. Good nice progress OP!
---
Nothing the players can do about bots. This is just a filter to automatically ignore spammers.
---
True, the issue is definitely up to jagex
---
I used to call it Ard-oog-nee
---
You mean Raikesy?
---
Tough luck, just sold everything for a crude chair + rope rebuild
---
Untrimmed RC here
---
Nice progress OP!
---
They remade RuneScape and we got rs3. Please be careful what you wish for.
---
It's just rng
---
Those couple tiles...mmmm.....
---
Bounty Craters in about 2009 was the best team related minigame. Never knew what was going to happen.
---
Or just have your alt be with you, or just pk on a normal account. Cant believe this comment got upvotes
---
Was about to say this. 92 wcing here and the wc guild is the way to go
---
Personally I just look at APM (i.e. method 1). The only exception is if you can click in the same spot on the screen (e.g. high alch) and own a foot pedal.
---
Took me 80 minutes on my ironman the other day with 82 range and then just using a RCB.
---
What a chad
---
Maybe this is true if you are doing 100% efficient slayer (boorrrring)
---
I hardly pray for any of my tasks
---
People use "afk" to refer to things that do not require much attention or effort to do.
---
Spend it to getting pools, fairy ring, jewellery box and portals in POH. A decent Poh is the best QOL you’ll have.
---
Upvote my post
---
Yeah, thats what ruined the ironman subreddit for me tbh.
---
Revs are just not worth the giant pain in the ass that they are (as a money maker), imo
---
Getting attacked every 5 minutes, and like every 3 mins if you have a wilderness weapon equipped, gets old realllllllly fast
---
No one forces irons to drop items. Some groups run irons as ffa and some agree that all drops are split from the iron's main.
---
I 100% agree. But to most who do FFA’s regularly, it seems they’d rather there be no drop than somebody other than themselves get it 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
All i see doing kamil in desert treasure.
---
Great argument, really won me over.
---
SPADE PARTY
---
He was probably killed by an iron man lol
---
I'd support this if done properly. Providing it gave no other benefit outside the realm of the combined armors bonus.
---
Well, yeah lol those too
---
It would be cool if you could pick them up (as an unusable version) and sell them on the GE to buy bonds. 
---
Idk if it would be possible with the engine but you would have to change the GE so ironmen can use it and they wouldnt get GP but only bondGP which they could use on bonds and the unusable versions of the item are a special kind (like a noted item, so it basically changes its itemID when it gets PKed). Would be a little hacky but if you do it for the most valuable items it could be a cool thing and you could have an ironman PK account where you have to get the supplies yourself
---
You still have some skills with fast xp rates, for now I would say something like this
---
5 con levels (mahog tables)
---
6 crafting levels 
---
10 fm levels (wintertodt)
---
10 prayer levels
---
12 herb levels
---
9 fletch levels
---
9 thieving levels
---
20 smithing levels (gold bars @ blast furnace)
---
Tree runs for fast extra levels (fruit and regular)
---
Artist team to cater items to look different on irons? Lmao hell no. They don't need to cater to ironman
---
Sounds like an awesome idea. Maybe you could also buy spins on this wheel. I'd be yelling about how much money I could make. A squeal of fortune, if you would.
---
Vendetta is not intended to be effective with Vengeance 
---
&gt;Has no effect if you cast vengeance recently
---
Like I stated previously, none of us can truly say for sure whether or not this is balanced or not without playtesting. My goal of course is to produce something that is balanced and good for the game, but I realize I could be off.
---
Currently though, I am not convinced that it's overpowered.
---
* The prayer drain is pretty punishing I think. Consider this situation: Player A has 62 prayer and has Vendetta and Ultimate Strength active. Player B has 52 prayer and attacks with a 3-tick weapon (e.g. magic shortbow). If player A camps these prayers, they will lose about 3.44 prayer points per second, and will be at zero prayer in about  18 seconds. This isn't accounting for smite. This makes camping Vendetta less practical, especially considering the opportunity cost of smite and other overheads.
---
* Vendetta reflects significantly less damage than Vengeance, and this scales down with opponent's damage. For hits between 20-30, I suggested having a 25% reflection rate, which is still decent, but it's nowhere near vengeance. Vendetta only comes close to Vengeance when the opponent has very high hits (70% reflection when the hit is 60+).
---
Again, most of this is just my intuitive feel for how it will operate in PvP. I am open to any suggestions and I'm not trying to saying you are absolutely wrong if you think it's OP, but I at least think it's unfair to call it a "permanent veng." :)
---
Either a HCIM. Or a 10 hp account. 
---
Better yet, a 10 HP HCIM
---
They could hire a hundred devs at 65k a year and it would be a drop in the bucket...
---
That’s great. I didn’t ever say I don’t think that this happens. I said it’s fucked up and we shouldn’t accept it as something normal. 
---
People are greedy and shitty. But, not everyone is. Being a pessimist that every human would fuck somebody else over for their own gain is a sad life to live. I like to think we, as a community, can better ourselves and not be shitheads to one another and scam items that were agreed on to be split. If you want items to yourself, go do FFA. 
---
I don’t understand how you guys think this is okay and should be normalized. It’s simply wrong lmfao. People scam, but it shouldn’t be a regular thing. Just like irl some people murder, mug, extort, etc. But it isn’t a normalized, everyday occurrence people just accept...

Nah he doesnt post in /r/sweden enough

Get goldsmithing gauntlets, use them at blast furnace.
---
if these consequences won't effect you its very unlikely you'll ever have to make this choice.
---
Shit you're right lmao. Read it easy too quick
---
So, to clarify because you failed to specify before which is why I said what I said... are you actually talking about ornamental ONLY?
---
I wouldnt say im wrong or your wrong bro. In this situation i literally wouldve typed "how long does it take ________ to grow? Osrs" into google and wouldve had the answer right away. Im just being a troll while still trying to pursaude you to be a little more self reliant.
---
Chinese overlords control rs3 while brits hold 07scape
---
I agree
---
I've always wondered how it would work if they charged more but based your membership on in game play time, like a month's worth of in game time played versus 30 days whether I use it or not. It would be a really weird system but it's interesting to think about
---
1.3m? How is this even possible? Doesn't lavas max out at like 70k? That's almost 20 hours of perfect ticks unless there's some other better method I'm unaware of.
---
3kc vissy 53 kc pet here sorry bud
---
Yes. It’s is purely a cosmetic thing. Just to have the look of the Ironman that you have at the beginning
---
oh okay that's fair.
---
it was just make as a discussion not a serious thing

Im thinking of asking for a diamond ring and 25k

I develop a Stamina Potion and Super Energy Potion addiction whenever I start a fresh account.

---
Way too high quality for this sub. I fucking love it
---
It is normal. It is not unique to this games community in any way. You can hope and pray all you want but good luck changing human nature. You're better off asking jagex to add coinshare to raids.
---
Yeah, one day I kept hitting the "remember username" and when I would keep going to log back in, I have to
---
I made a rune dragon alt during most of the 77-99 rc grind. That way you have a nice account for money making afterwards.

He's just been extra serene-y lately. Almost like he's trying to replace him.

You have a crown beside your name. Thats your flex. Shouldn’t even have ironman armour but you do so be happy with that.
---
And they say pkers aren’t toxic #deadcontent
---
I'm sorry can you help me understand how I was being an ass? Are BR's or MOBA's bad. I'm sorry that I came off sounding the wrong way.
---
RL has nothing to do with ppl making cheat clients LOL people are going to do that shit regardless
---
Nobody can relate because bots don't mess up
---
slayer bad
---
hunter good
---
I don't have a tbow but I would sell mine. It depends on the person.
---
Firemaking, smithing, and then fletching
---
To be fair, it's more than 95% likely that those are the exact kind of people that are doing what OP is describing.
---
Save for DHCB, it's crashing hard now. You might be able to pick one up for cheap. It's almost 15m down from 2 weeks ago.
---
This is legit me
---
I feel like if you're an iron you shouldn't have to split since you cant get lost from the other people's drops anyway.
---
I kinda wish you could permanently keep your run energy on for moments like that. Not like you really keep it off in any situation unless you're doing Vorkath or something similar.
---
Time for 85cmb max cape
---
Best for last.
---
Idk man today I got 2 in my seed pack and I was ECSTATIC. I don’t want that feeling to go away. IM btw
---
Although a cool idea, how used will this really be? What benefit is there for an Ironman to PK? They cant collect items and all they do is waste their own supplies.
---
When they kill you they will often advertise the clan as well
---
You pay a premium for the best XP. It's perfectly fine imo, though that comes from a guy who got his 99 farming from magic seeds at 200k and palms at 75k.
---
Ayyye congrats! I just finished desert treasure for the first time and freed all the dudes for rfd! Now i just need to get that 175 qp and ill finally get my barrows gloves! Next step is the fire cape!
---
Mm2 is easy compared to ds2 anyways just a bit of a pain
---
Wouldn’t bother selling it. You’ll make the 5m back in 2 hours at vorkath. Just use it.
---
73IQ
---
So basically fuck anyone who wants to save money?
---
Pretty good 👍
---
Thank you, at work so can’t watch the video. Much easier to hide reddit.
---
Jokes on you. 
---
We say the same to pvp polls 😂
---
The way this game is there will always be a huge jump between the best xp or bis and second best even if that gap is very small
---
If someone can't secure their e-mail, that's 100% on them. There's a financial incentive to steal a RS account, so the least someone could do is protect their e-mail.
---
This is more for ironmen doing PVE in the wilderness who anti PKers. Currently PKing ironmen is low/no risk because even if you die you can go back for your items
---
Yea I never had an issue with Jagex customer support. I even had my old rs3 account stolen and used for botting, which was perm banned and thru their support page i was able to contact them and they investigated and returned my account.
