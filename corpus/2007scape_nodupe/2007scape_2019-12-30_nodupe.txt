If hes contemplating a bgs I doubt he has the cashstack for dhcb
---
---
---
I’ll back google and myself over some hick on the internet.
---
This is really cool!
---
items like d limbs should never be drops from gold farming monsters like rune dragons in my opinion. Completely devalues the unique drop to people who don't camp rune dragons with half a dozen alts (or bots). Every rare and super rare unique is already cheap as possible. i would totally vote to have it switched to kbd drop table and reward people who arent already farming gold in one of the easiest ways possible.
---
thanks :)
---
Account doesn’t have any favour in Kourend and I love Brimhaven dungeon anyway due to nostalgia.
---
Sadistic? Why?
---
Damn that isn't that rare, thought it was more around 1/500-1/1500. I'm new to p2p so i dont know much. Got overexcited and hyped up about it... Thank you for the response!
---
I used to have a 60 attack med with 70 def and that account is now 75 def 75 attack, but that’s it. Other builds, like 20, 25, 30, and 40 are useless or weak imo.
---
Just how high Genie is?
---
Yep. Some food is coded like potions, which allow you to eat a food and drink/eat the next food on the same tick. Sara brews and karambwans are most commonly used for this.
---
I wondered why people took karambwans when they don't heal as much as pizza. Now I know. Thank you.
---
I only ever see it in the mirror, which is like once a day for like a few minutes while I get ready. But the truth is, one only styles their hair for the benefit of others. We feel good knowing our appearance looks good to someone else. If our hair were invisible to everyone else, we wouldn't bother.
---
Hi all, very inexperiencre uim here, wondering where I should go about acquiring rune gear and how Im going to store the gear for later use.
---
That's why I always have public chat turned off. Other people are annoying.
---
&gt;I saw this on Reddit, I'm sure Reddit will love it!
---
What a cordial pro. He really is just a cool guy who pursued his passion of rs and is doing the best with it. He really cares and he re-wrote 1% of the entire game's code in a week. The title god ash is funny, but it's also kinda appropriate with how much he cares about the game.
---
Even if you have DHCB? Or if you only have BP?
---
Jesus so many people are falling for his bait
---
Lmfao that part make a you look even more stupid.
---
I'm going out on a limb and presuming that you've got an internal cape, because if you haven't, i think its time you jump off the sub for a bit and reconsider the life choices that led you here.
---

---
Starting later with less supplies? Might aswell skip to zuk with no supplies. If you can make it to zuk from 31, you should be able to do it from 1. It's meant to be the hardest activity in the game for a reason.
---
If you're good enough to do this, then you're already good enough to get -1.5 hour capes. If you can't put aside 1.5 hours (off task) to complete the hardest activity in the game (which you only need to do once unless you're pet hunting / slaying), then you're shit out of luck and should maybe find a game that requires less grinding
---
/u/ThePussyHammer
---
OSRSadvice. It's definitely not for everyone, as we have rules like no swearing and try to be mature. But those rules make it a lot friendlier atmosphere and people are always willing to answer questions and give advice
---
ye so it doesnt matter if you open it early or save it up. Opening it early and getting the 30m early is better
---
Lol
---
Thats falador not wilderness lmfaoooooo
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
Me neither. You forgot "role playing." I play it because I enjoy the actual gameplay.
---
Are you one of those OSRS clan leaders that hasn't had a single moment of joy in the game for 3 years  now? I read the other comments, then thought myself a fool for overreacting to such a simple thing, i guess i'm going to say sorry for making a meaningless thread.
---
Gz! :)
---
[removed]
---
Love the numbers. Thanks much for the link!
---
I had a 30 pre eoc with turmoil, but I agree that anything between 1-41 is pretty useless on oldschool. Only bothered to make a zerker, a 60 attack 1 def and a 50att 70def piety/rigour mauler that's more of a novelty then an actual pking account.
---
Honestly that joke was way worse than this meme
---
I opened the picture, saw the screenshot is from Vista, skimmed a part about him making 100b from buying willow bows, then realized it's nothing worth reading.
---
how about no
---
How is this so accurate.
---
Fuck I'm about to cry
---
I love them rambling. Makes me happy .
---
I like Skilling too, can get tedious but I agree with the accomplishment feeling. 
---
I think my favorite part are the quests. They are way more in depth and creative and thought out and interesting compared to any other modern mmo. 
---
Every other mmo's quest system is literally just the slayer skill in RS.
---
Get members. Jump to Wintertodt minigame. Great cash / firemaking exp. Do these a few a day. Start leveling up farming and once 32, do your ranarr runs every 1.5h for 60-200k a run (if you use the 4 easy to get patches) - on a regular day you can expect 400-800k profit just doing ranarr plants every 1.5h (takes 5-10 mins)
---
I netted about 9m doing this over a week, casually playing (herb runs at work smoke breaks, 1-2h WT when home after dinner / kids)
---
By making it again .. aintthat hard
---
Go back to the bakery, go through the door and then try to go back down to the lower floor where you made the shield. The guy should give you another
---
I'm obviously sorry that happened to you, but false positives do happen. Thus far, I haven't had issues.
---
Did the bots downvote your comment too?
---
Damn how did you not get diagnosed with MCAD for so long, nothing as a child no docs picked up on? Even when you’re a baby they detect that shit from tests after birth, shit luck
---
Then your issue is with google and their recent slew of greedy tactics to revoke ad revenue form content creators.
---
This is why more, and more people are flocking towards personal sponsorships.
---
... and y’know what? I can’t blame them for seeking the ability to pay their bills.
---
Why do you pay? Get UBlock Origin and it blocks 'em for free.
---
the green baker is gone I cant teleport to the bakery to make another one
---
For sure!
---
I actually did. But it's often misdiagnosed. I spent years being treated for other issues. I have four pages of wrong diagnosis. When I was a kid, I spent months in the ER. Wasn't till a while back I finally had one that got the right one.
---
To catch 8 times as much fish r u dumb
---
Agreed. Ring of Suffering being used to reset recoil charges isn't a bug, it's a mechanic behaving exactly as it was programmed to; Apply partial recoil charges to the RoS before full ones, and prioritizing noted recoils over a worn one.
---
It's likely just a matter of nobody on the team stopping to think how it could be used to create a gameplay advantage. And in fairness, it's a really niche advantage. Only really useful for low combat challenges/records where you can't get the HP level to wear a suffering, specifically in circumstances where you can't bring enough recoils in your inventory... So basically just the Fight Caves, as far as I know.
---
For the game at large, it's not a particularly useful function, and therefor not especially problematic. I wouldn't be surprised if they just let it stand as-is, although I could also see them changing it so that you have to be at a bank to add charges to the RoS.
---
Join the cc 'soa' (stands for shield of arrav) cc is always packed with people looking for a partner
---
Fuckin damn it!  
---
I was doing some crafting grinds on twisted league in my B U C K E T (g), barely paying any attention as is typical with scaping.  
---
I look over and I see it in the chat box, "wow dude! Nice swag helm!"  
---
I look all around, but he was nowhere in sight. I was too late.  
---
If only he knew how badly I wanted to be noticed, but alas, I didn't notice the one who noticed me.
---
you might have trouble breathing if you wear that fury
---
And you also don't get any of the loot. But you can if you really want to.
---
Iron dragon drops visage?
---
Thanks man
---
Layman’s term just to break the idea down in a simple way. No need for hostility.
---
Yes, the conspiracy that Michael Jackson developed Runescape and not the Gowans
---
Nice
---
I definitely agree. RuneScape may seem dated to the outside world, but the inside.. it's something far greater. It's beautiful, unique, and definitely my home away from home. I spent a lot of my youth programming, making graphics, etc. Hoping I could join the ranks some day. I had even hoped to become a mod, or in some way legitimately help the community. I've never had a single account banned, not even a single complaint. 
---
But hey, I'm just happy to be here. Haha. :)
---
Get friends
---
That's a really kind way of saying "lol fuck that"
---
Find a way to get off tutorial island with 2 hp and you're golden.
---
Happening on 498 for the entire day. Thought they might be saying bank pins but it’s sometimes only 3 digits. Have you found an answer?
---
Ros adds charges to other rings isnt intended mate sorry to break it to ya...
---
This but unironically
---
Can you please change your reddit name I think you've done enough
---
what's a PAFT?
---
What on earth is that
---
Nah, I actually take breaks. It's definitely nice to have the gold, but.. you can't fully experience RuneScape without exploring. Agility is probably my favorite skill actually
---
Man Runescape was an amazing phenomenon with me and my friends. We absolutely loved it even though we all sucked at it. I remember wanting to play together but we couldn't go to each other's houses so when the school bell rang, we'd run as fast as possible to a computer that was free to use at our local mall. It was about 5 minutes of full on running, and whoever got there first would be the one playing for about 1hr until we had to go home. I think the computer was part of a marketing campaign by a internet provider, it was free to "try their awesome interner" so we just went and the guy there let us play. Good times.
---
Gonna doubt that without evidence supporting you
---
woah people pay for youtube red?
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/H6drnfe.png](https://i.imgur.com/H6drnfe.png) Is what I use for my gear heard it was better to go with this over void, I'd recommend more bolts than what I got here like around 5k+
---
I love it. Turning my phone screen off and still being able to listen to videos is amazing. Super battery saver
---
Well I was too busy winning lms to screenshot what some washed yter called me
---
similar stats but using barrows gear, i generally get 7-9 kills per trip
---
currently at about 150 kc and no spectral so still lots of room for improvement, i die maybe one every 5 trips when i get greedy or don't kill before the bit where ghosts and pools come at the same time
---
I didn’t have the crafting level to fuck up on the zenith. No amulet option since I’m 85 boosting to 90
---
Yeah it’s absolute madness how low cb the record is now
---
73k
---
NO
---
Must've been an expensive bot
---
I’d use the OG client if it had GPU rendering. That’s the number 1 reason I use RL tbh, the game feels pretty bad without it
---
Dude how did u get 14 upvotes and I got -13
---
MSB with rune arrows better 
---
If you're doing something that requires a cbow ur prob not sposed to use broad bolts generally invest in better bolts like diamond e or rubies
---
cbows good for high defence/high hp low magic monsters
---
in the end more than likely what you want is MSB I except bossing where u shuld have the stats for BP
---
Can you imagine the shit theyd get if they made loot boxes
---
I know right? Just get it
---
An Elysian sigil
---
Hell I saw Zezima at edge bank in OSRS like 2 years ago, I still screenshotted it and showed it to my friends
---
Drug dealing
---
[deleted]
---
99 cooking and 99 magic and a 23m bank were a long grind brother
---
Hahaha
---
May I ask where to train for these stats for your alt? Nmz too? Thanks!
---
Nice wc has always been my favorite skill
---
True, you're only there for a second but I have seen some clans camping the tele spot. Don't you lose all your void if you die with it in deep wild?
---
Monster isnt aids whatsoever
---
It's a sub 50 hour grind on average with minimal effort for one of the best items in the game
---
F
---
But what monster should I get them from because the wiki shows that a lot of them drop from different monsters.
---
You probably went on the diagonal and mistook that for needing to be on the blue tile.
---
I will burn with you!
---
This guy gets it...
---
How long did this take? Nice!!
---
That'd be dope.
---
Getting 2 kill trips is lucky with blowpipe mostthe time you get 1. You might be able to stretch to 3 if you can get woox walk down and amazing rng on your specs
---
An old 'loading - please wait' in white text or whatever would perfect this
---
Damn, do you bring anything other than super cmb, prayer pots, and anglers?
---
Depends. Normally, yes, which is why I switched to blessed d'hide since Void was overkill anyway. But now you can use that Parchment from LMS to keep it as a PvP Untradeable on death, but it adds a high cost.
---
It's pretty interesting you spent hundreds of hours getting 99 in the two skills you can use an auto clicker to train, yet you have 4 skills that aren't even level 10, which takes 5 minutes
---
My favorite right now but black is coming soon!
---
The bludgeon pieces comprise 50% of the unsired drop table. If you acquire all 3 pieces but do not assemble them, you remove that 50% of the drop table. This means the jar, head, whip, dagger, and pet get their rates adjusted to fill this space, raising your odds of getting the pet. The downside to this is you have a lot more of a chance to get the other rewards, making Sire *much* less profitable.
---
I work 2 days a week, and play this in my free time. Skill total above 1700 after playing for 1.5yrs. 95 in thieving is my best accomplishment so far. And thieving is a griiind. Took me 8 months to get that far... people, feel free to donate so I never have to work and be as dedicated as you guys 😬
---
you'd make way more per hour just doing zulrah thou
---
the good thing about taking a break for months is that players will find easier and easier ways of doing the inferno over time that you can just copy and better items come out because of jagex's insatiable need for power creep
---
7/10 flame.
---
Decent
---
Calling bs on that one lmao.
---
6/10 flame.
---
Funny af but just as unoriginal
---
Lair of Tarn Razorlor.
---
I'm assigned to kill ankou and I'm terrified of the catacombs...
---
2/10 flame.
---
So pointed, no humor.
---
Oh my account that I’ve since ~2005 which is now in RS3 my highest stat I think was ~90 and that was fishing.
---
Welp it's true
---
He was flaming me cause I wasn’t gonna max in 2019 but ended up finishing in time, dunno why he said it there lol
---
8/10 flame. Good humor, passive af.
---
While his content is alright, expert projections suggest Rendi's ego is inflating from the size of our galaxy to the entire universe. More updates will follow.
---
U r our generations Woodward and Bernstein ty
---
Why did you make me look
---
Now it’s time to play the game, duh!
---
Kidding aside probably just pvm/completionist stuff
---
Typical ironman
---
Try to outlevel ores you want to mine. Coal is unlocked at 30 mining, but if you start mining it right at 30 it'll be slow going. Stick with iron for awhile, and once you can use a rune pick or so then you can consider moving to coal if you want. 
---
That said, iron will be the most efficient for just getting levels.
---
JASON!
---
I actually laughed at this, because it's the first time I've seen it. 
---
Can I still be rated though?
---
So I was there and scored a zammy godsword and zerker ring and guilded shield...thank you brother for making my Christmas :)
---
Good stuff OP. Those nostalgic years were some of the best of our lives
---
Exam gives more xp!
---
Can't unsee this.
---
I’m kinda new to dks. So I took the safe way
---
Trade
---
How are you people so good at this stuff I cant hold 2 or 3 brimstone keys without wanting to cash in
---
I disagree.
---
I put work into my looks cause its important to me, idc about anyone else.
---
I also clean parts of my car that no one else will ever see, same principle.
---
I'm sure you do similar things.
---
My gf is blind and stretched fixed mode is the only way she can even see anything! :) RuneLite is amazing.
---
Fucking lol- you’re missing the point entirely, NEET boy.
---
How long has this been known? I feel like it’d just start another bludgeon piece lol. Do you have a confirmed source of this happening? Like on video or anything?
---
Lol, I love having mismatched armor at low levels and still thinking you looked badass. Some stranger one day gave me a full set mithril plate armor for free and I nearly lost my fucking mind since that almost seems OP for me. Good times.
---
Wtf does :-# convey
---
Still no evidence, right? I still don't believe it.
---
Well explained, nice.
---
FBI OPEN UP!
---
I have two monitors hooked up to a MacBook. I needed a port replicator to do this though and I have to keep it plugged in. But I can use two or three screens.
---
Did anyone else read these answers in the voice of Mod Ash?
---
The YouTube link to the orchestra is legit so I would say the q&amp;a is legit
---
Damn that’s sicc I’m actually so jealous
---
Wise old man - "what an amateur"
---
Makes so much sense, but Jmods don't like to use their brains and put the dragon platebody and high tier crossbow on an afk money making mob. That's why these items are so damn cheap.
---
Now do all of them at once
---
Good concept, unfortunately you've peaked already by doing Mod Ash first. Can't possibly get any better.
---
Could always do median of accs with 10000, 1000, 100+ hours played
---
Neigh. It makes it much easier to bot. Kbd dont have requirements, rune dragons do
---
You can actually do the same thing in the mm2 tunnel with one of the floor traps (pressure trap thing) for 40k xp/hr
---
imagine not bringing a puzzlebox, losing your clue scroll because of it, and blaming the pkers instead of just buying a puzzlebox. Like seriously do people just not know that puzzlebox exists for this exact reason?
---
This is a good look on you pal
---
Never going back to that dumb boss. Also have definitely wasted my RNG in this game.
---
Where is the pet arena?
---
Will probably be runescape VR someday or something very similar
---
Obviously get max FPS on the pro I’m kind of looking for iPad Air stats lol
---
Also free
---
Holy shit. 
---
12/10 just for the effort lmfao
---
You should check the clans section on the forums and try to join a clan that does a lot of tob. Its the best way to find consistent teams.
---
Listen here. I’ll mash you real good if you don’t quiet down. &gt;.&gt;
---
Who?
---
Is there still the old safe spot? Might go back to it. It was chill as fuck
---
I remember getting two within my firdt 1500~ kills when they were around 85m. 
---
Stopped when I got the second and that was basically who my built my from bank from after merching.
---
He was well known before ice Poseidon though :P
---
Crystal axe for sure but non tick manip teaks are bad xp/hr and pretty click intensive. You should try some sulliusceps if you're 65
---
It isn't really an accomplishment anymore to get 99 rc. It's the new woodcutting cape now that Zeah exists. Well done though, you're on your way to a completely non-prestigious but powerful cape; the max cape
---
Lol Kempq defending himself
---
If the recovery request wasnt instantly denied thats a good sign - it means it will be reviewed by an actual person. Usually takes less than 1 business today. Gl
---
In a cc rn but they all 500kc+ never join
---
He's got full ranger gear
---
also better in every way than OSB
---
 Poll #69 Question #420
---
Man I love amenity 😂
---
True runescaper! 😀
---
Nothing.
---
You dont own your account, Jagex does.
---
Appreciate it :)
---
But my feeling
---
Wow hilarious.
---
"Starting later with less supplies? Might aswell skip to zuk with no supplies." clearly implying that skipping 1-31 is same as skipping 31-68.
---
Crying? When was i crying? Just defending my stance that paying for skipping unchallanging waves in challanging pvm content is not unreasonable.
---
Doing your first cape without prayerflicking? Have you stepped in inerno?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You are just spewing out random shit in your money rage at this point.
---
Sorry no said it, happy belated birthday 😀
---
I swap them. Not coordinated enough. :)
---
My understanding is that at vorkath, with a DFW and anti fire pot you'll still take damage so using a super antifire is what everyone does. However with **protect from mage** and the DFW, would I still need a super antifire to get complete protection? I am aware that if i am using DHCB and DFW, protect from range is definitely the better choice, however **in theory**, is a super antifire still needed for full protection if I used the ward + protect from mage?
---
I like things that force people to interact and help each other.  It’s an mmo.
---
Me realizing my main is this guy’s alt
---
It does, but not at first. I use the jagex approved mouse keys. I have my number one on my mouse bound to shift. First one doesn't do anything, just to switch over, then it works.
---
Back when ironmemes were added the mentality was that no content would ever be adjusted to fit ironmen and ironmen were a side thing basically. Dwh and zeah were added around this time.
---
With ironman popularity rising since then mentality has changed.
---
Really appreciate it man:)
---
They make enough in two to three days to pay for em all. So it's 9 days of profits:)
---
Classic Sosa 🔥
---
Hahaha ;)
---
Thats why my rsn is (Iamafk dude) .... xD
---
Its a group boss, 1 kill trips are not odd when soloing.
---
Sure is. I even asked jagex mods directly
---
You can't stack a spicy stew and dragon axe special since they are both visible boosts, right? 
---
I need 90 woodcutting for a master clue step and just hit 85, wasn't sure if I should gamble for the +5 (or +2 if they do stack) or just power out two more levels to know I get the boost.
---
America - more alcohol
---
on kc 47 wow gz
---
Wear it as a cock ring
---
More sharks than all the sharks in the RuneScape seas ;). 
---
When I'm finished... I will be the ruler of sharks. I'll command an army so powerful, the scape of RuneScape shall be in flames.
---
Muhahaha.
---
Or.. make some gold. Ya know...
---
Whatever works.
---
I just recently started playing on mobile 2 days ago, made my account and everything on the app. All I did was verify my email and logged into the account fine on PC tonight. Have never opened Game Center on my phone either.
---
I remember back in like 05 I was playing WoW and flying on a Gryphon somewhere and my grandfather was amazed how “the bird knew where to go” lmao.
---
You'd just get a letter from their legal team and then they definitely would cut off all contact with someone threatening legal action. First rule of law is to never talk to your opponent unless your through a lawyer.
---
Magic's or redwoods
---
Couple hours, any estimate?
---
I would definitely take it if I wasn't making a living being a content creator. But if I was relying on content creation as a stream of income I wouldn't because I want to keep a better image than if I was doing it as a hobby. It raises higher expectations. I prefer this over fake subscribers and inflated view counts as a method of gaining more income
---
Yep iron :/ gg runes and gp lmao
---
delete this
---
It's not just people with high level accounts that deserve to have their account back
---
Genie reminds me of that drawing of the genie and swampletics
---
In the sense of the facial features and expression.
---
Bro rust is like osrs on crack
---
You seem to be the maniac here..
---
Fishing? What's fishing?
---
Nice.
---
I actually have. I wasn't the last person on earth, but I did experience isolation. But it was a strange situation, where I was required to wear the exact same thing every single day for years and any sense of self image went out the window. I never even notice myself in a mirror anymore.
---
But is there gonna be cake
---
"The challenging content is 1-68", "i get 1-31 is piss easy"
---
So which one?
---
"This game is literally a grind."
---
Cool argument, now everything new should also be a grind to minimize enjoyment.
---
And those examples are fucking horrible and in no way comparable.
---
If you gonna go after some1 so relentlessly, then atleast atleast have some consistensy and knowledge about the topic.
---
I've got like 30m. Bahahaha. But I'm honestly glad to hear that. Thanks bud :)
---
Here in Canada, full breakfast, double Caesar and get back on the piss for round 2
---
Light him up boys
---
Like bro I just built a 2nd base to cover more of the map. And I added a 2nd story with windows so I can roof camp like a chad lmfao
---
Also when I solely associate your product with annoying adverts that interrupt what I was watching. I don’t even mean osrs content creators, the ads are on the YouTube videos before hand, on websites and reddit Facebook etc. 
---
I just resent you for shoving your product down my throat and will be less likely to check it out than if they just did less advertising. Good product speak for themselves, you don’t need to be reminded 24/7 that Mercedes makes good cars because it is well known.
---
Mucha importacion
---
Now do adamant lallana
---
It must be a gliiitch, it must be
---
What the fuck do you think endless means?
---
This is so impressive! Imagine the money you’ll bring in if you eventually turned these into rune dragon alts.
---
done it on ardy, its cancer to multi log thieving
---
What all do you plant?
---
Drakes are already in the game
---
You also don’t know how long he will live for. He could play 3 minutes a week but live long enough for 200m all.
---
You're not quite right here - more max hits on zulrah is still more dps even if you can't hit that number. You still roll damage based on your max hit, but anything &gt; 50 is rolled down to a 50. If your max hit is 50, you have a ~2% chance to hit a 50 on zulrah. If your max hit is 100, you have a ~50% chance to hit &gt;= 50 and it gets rounded down to a 50
---
I’m sorry for your losses
---
But congratz on your first 99! That’s something to be proud of :)
---
"Once you've learned it, its not a grind." ????????
---
Im dumb for arguing with a wall.
---
i use 3 screens all on one pc running 5 accounts, usually 3 at rune dragons, my main, and now my twisted league account.
---
my best friend has MCAD, did you not get diagnosed until you were older?  he was screened at birth and has it under control for the most part, he does have a pretty strict diet he has to follow to stop it from creating havoc on his body (he eats like zero fatty foods).
---
Wow dude, who took your spade?
---
This cracked me up scrolling through as well
---
normal antifire + dfw + mage protect means you take no damage from dragonfire, yes
---
Thats just retarded lmao
---
All time spent on games is "wasted time", unless youre playing this game to make money through RWT in which case I just feel bad for you as youre just slaving away for chump change
---
Haha XD I’m famous, but really I got my mining pet at 47 mining aswell..
---
If it’s the redwood log step there’s a chance you wouldn’t even cut the log in time if you need the full +5 boost so it’s better to at least get an extra level just to be safe anyway
---
downvote this guy quick!!
---
What’s the average amount of time it takes to get 99 runecrafting with no runners
---
This. I was confused at first when I bought mine. Guides are easy and usually have all the links.
---
Just note that some apps won’t work with Google play installed (Disney Plus for example). I just uninstall Google play and it works. Then reinstall it when I’m done with Disney plus.
---
That was my very first skill cape back in '07. Also, it became my first on OSR in '14.
---
How does it have everything? Your first post stating what you farmed just happened. You never state that anywhere else.
---
Nice try bud. All your post says is a friend gave you 2 mil on top of the 5 mil you already had.
---
Your math still doesn't add up. You would need, at a minimum (perfect drops), around 2,000 kills to get the 5 mil. If you started at 25 and killed 2,000 warriors with ONLY ranged, you would be at least level 68 Ranged (2000 kills is roughly 650k xp, which is 68). That's with getting amazing RNG on drops. So unless you got amazing RNG, again, the math doesn't add up.

Either way - enjoy mems you gold buyer you. Someone has to support those Venezuelans.

I can make dinner in a room 15 metres away from my room with the pc in it, going back every 5-6 minutes to pot up.

If I don’t feel like doing an AFK task when they come up I just skip or do a different skill until I need to do something afk.
---
Yea my app keeps freezing and I have to reset it constantly.
---
edge dungeon is like 20k per hour i think
---
Tbh I’ve played far longer than you and we’re pretty comparable. I mean I’m level 86. Around 1k total. I have like 10+ mill but I also got super lucky with some clan drop parties. I don’t have any of those untradeables. I’m definitely a noob, but it probably gives you perspective as to how ahead you are compared to many players.
---
depends what method you use, divide the xp needed by xp/hr
---
No you didn’t. Every level you gain is one you don’t have to gain later.
---
Range? Than?

Oh shit bro! Bro are you for real? That’s wack bro.

You can make it fight the pet fish and they both say things like that
---
Depends on stage of the game but IMO the big ones in each tier are Ardy easy (fantastic early game unlimited teleport to the Ardougne area), Varrock medium (GE teleport, also battlestaves are decent), Kandarin hard (Seers teleport), and Lumbridge elite (goodbye Dramen staff, 6th Slayer block slot).
---
There's other stuff that gives nice QOL improvements depending on what you're doing e.g. a bunch of different diary rewards that improve herb runs, Fremennik hard for lunars, Morytania hard for Barrows, Western Provinces hard for elite void, etc etc.

If you're a very good risk fighter, I imagine that would be better gp/hr than tob, especially since tob uniques have gone down so much, and will probably continue to go down, specifically rapier and avernic.

This has started in the last three days and is borderline unplayable. I personally only play on mobile these days and have had to completely forego any dangerous content for fear of death. This same instant disconnect happens on WiFi and Data connections as well as different wifi. I am running on a OnePlus 6 with latest Android 10 updates. I would love any suggestions on what is happening or how to fix this.

1. This isnt even a scam. They took a discord rank away from you? Lmao
---
2. I am in this discord. The only thing you need in order to sell/buy/swap is the “verified” rank. U just meet an admin in game and they verify. U probably got verified when you shouldnt or some other shit came up. Like if u dont have this rank, something is fucking wrong. 
---
3. Everybody fucking inflates and deflates. Its all opportunity because most people dont give a shit about 5-10%. 
---
Actually as i type this there is a rule. U cant price manipulate. Right now there is 3 people buying for 1:1.6 ratio or sell for 1.6-2.0. If you tried to sell for drastically under that or buy for over, ur gunna get ur access taken. So if i tried to sell for 1:1, im just going to get banned. Idc if ur in a hurry, theres like 10 admins that will gladly take ur gold for 1:1.6
---
I think it's worth noting that because of the topics usually covered by Crumb's videos (RWT, botting, etc), this poll might have a bias toward representing the "dirtier" side of the OSRS community.

Except runescape has walls on its tile borders, where as minecraft takes up a full block for walls. So either your inside is going to be small or your outside is going to be too large. Encountered this problem myself.

Kind of sad really. I really wish they'd do something to allow ironmen to enter other peoples houses and have people enter theirs and just restrict them from using anything there. If nothing else, why can't ironmen have other people in their houses? I mean fuck what are they gonna do, light their altar burners for them?

if you can be bothered, sapphires are best. Takes a long time and a lot of hopping though

Otherwise check the osrs wiki, there are gp per tokkul ratios for both buying and selling

Out of what you have blocked I'd only keep spiritual creatures blocked. The others are good xp

The real question tho, can you complete the agility course?

Are you like 12? Why would you screenshot an image instead of saving it losslessly?

I've started making money on RS3 and after +/- 2 years, Switched my gp from RS3 to OSRS.
---
I’d expect everything related to infernal cape to go up too. People have a good amount of time to get one before release
---
Because he has 1300 total
---
BahahahHa
---
1. You dont know anything about me. You are just making assumptions based on 1 comment i wrote. I work alot and dont got alot of time to play. I decided for the 2 weeks vacation i had to grind out dwh, no matter how many KC it took. 
---
2. I never complained. I was just pointing it out. Im glad i did the grind and am proud i pulled trough.
---
Yeah you're fine lol
---
If you make a new account you cant redeem the awards straight away. This is because of people making bots and making millions of gp

Man you need some moneyy to replace laptop with monitor(s)

unfortunately thats the real deal

Lol you troglodyte
---
I can't even do some slayer tasks on mobile
---
You really just downvote me lmao? God I'm thinking some nasty stuff
---
Meh its kind of like the brigaded/planned reddit buff suggestions(merches), its gonna happen.
---
You could level up mage and prayer a bit, 60pray for chivalry and 60+mage for most teleports, ibans and godspells. Or you could go for 75 range and try to save up 2 more mill for a blowpipe
---
Are there any legal 3rd party clients out there then? Because the official osrs launcher never works for me and runelite is a bot now
---
personally i like my power amulet over glory. more defense. 
---
ofc fury &gt; both.
---
I bet if people weren't using adblock they'd be getting paid a lot more.
---
To max stats.
---
gargs defense isnt that high, so it won't be as useful as guthans or something else
---
Same here; I've been doing bananas, calquat, cactus (cacti after guild was added), belladonna, mushroom, teaks every few days, and 2+ seaweed runs every day after their release. I have done an overlay on my counts and I'm about 2.5-3x dry for pet after almost 3 years of daily runs. I have gained 350ish hespori seeds since guild release about a year ago, and to my knowledge the seeds have same rate calculation as skilling clues meaning that you have an average of 100-200 seeds for pet rate (100 average for spirit trees/hardwood/seaweed, 150 at 1/7500 rates and scaling towards 200). 
---
In that time I have only gone from level 99 to 41m xp, I could easily have been at 200m for the same effort and pet rate total if I had instead committed my bank to doing high level trees. 
---
Meanwhile *I literally got the fucking pet on Twisted League yesterday I am totally not salty in any way*
---
Nor did an ecumenical key
---
When I first got the barrelchest anchor when I as about 12 I would run around the GE holding it because I loved the animation. Still do with the ballista sometimes.
---
Adblock is definitely the problem here.
---
Isn't that not possible cuz they never showed the entirety of it
---
you fool, how could you willingly hand over so much power
---
they are dropped by the minions, therefore they are related.
---
With prices right now, Karambwans actually ARE the most profitable to cook lol
---
After a certain amount, there really is no point.  And truly "max gear" is quite unnecessary for the most part.  IMO the only big-ticket item that pulls anywhere even close to its weight is tbow.  Scythe and Ely seem pretty superfluous to me for the most part.  Scythe is only super-BiS for ToB, there are other places it's BiS as well (such as Cerb) but it costs so damn much to use that it often actually falls behind other gear on gp/hr and becomes basically a pet farming tool.  And Ely is pure luxury, pretty much no amount of defense is worth anywhere even close to 800m in this game.
---
So if you take out those 2 major items then you're pretty much gonna be all set with like 2b tops.  1b for twisted bow, 1b for pretty much every other piece of gear you could possibly want plus a couple hundred hours' worth of supplies for whatever you'd like to do.  MAYBE 2.5b since you might also feel like maxing out all the buyable skills in the most expensive/fastest ways possible.
---
But that's about it.  Anything more than that is pure excess, I honestly don't even know why people bother to gather like 5b, utterly pointless in my eyes.  That's thousands of extra hours spent making money for seemingly no purpose.
---
because Twitter lul
---
Meele is more gp because of cost of supplies. It is cheaper to use max meele compared to void + dhcb as you use less supplies aka bolts which means more profit. In terms of kills/hr it's almost the same
---
that.... that's the joke
---
it's a joke
---
I don't see any appeal in risking a skull and a teleblock when I can just 3 item imps and icefiends for maybe an hour at a time to get keys with no risk. 1/60 isn't an especially punishing drop rate.
---
Or just don't use adblock, if you down like adverts pay to have them removed. The only people in the wrong are the people using adblock. 
---
Nobody is going to directly give people money when they watch a YouTube video they liked ya egg. You're the problem and the reason these content creators have to get the endorsements
---
Not even EVERYONE. It was a few select streamer voices on twitter complaining directly to the Jmods. It only changed because the meta is distorted and perverted for being a intermediate-level quest
---
I am wondering this as well, I absolutely genocided the babies yesterday, just kept spamming them as a slayer task. Prayer is my last skill for base 80s and I deeply regret using all of my lamps on Agility and it's incredibly unlikely that I'm getting the Elite diary done within the time-frame of TL for that 500k XP Lamp. I feel like 95 Slayer is just too far away for me personally.
---
There's a whole lot of mental gymnastics when comparing (assuming you have Wisdom T5 without Way of The Warrior T3) the 900 xp from the baby bones to the 2160 of the adults, the babies have no defence whereas the adults have a decent amount, babies have 50 HP and adults have 140, what kind of gear and stats you've got, whether or not you have the level and runes for Reanimate Dragon for the adults, and that babies don't have to tan/craft/alch the hides so I decided to go with the babies.
---
They babies are aggressive if you're under 96 Combat, which was nice for a while until I leveled up. I killed about 500 of the poor little guys while getting 70-80 Defence and that got me 72-77 Prayer. Definitely worth considering 84 Slayer ASAP for Drakes (Bones) and 85 for Abbys (Ensouled heads) and they're both 100 TLPoints for completing a task. Hydras would most likely be best but that's not likely to be an option for me.
---
Ahh YouTube spammer, I see
---
OK but why tho
---
Thanks! Couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw that I obtained it haha
---
Yeah you're right shouldn't have said everyone
---
Thank you! Was thinking about rc or mining :x
---
but i want to :(
---
im guessing 96k
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
1. Stop doing drugs.
---
2. Theres no sloppy seconds
---
If you have a decent amount of time to play/afk you can probably get a pretty decent amount of points. Competing for ranks won't really be practical though
---
Haha thanks! I am, took quite a while to get there. Proud of myself that I did not give up along the way :p
---
People can risk it to speed up getting keys
---
Gratz!!
---
Well, since my irl friends dont play and my current friendlist is hugely inactive. Besides that, I did hunter constantly when I play. So, yeah, you don’t meet a lotta people down there
---
Might be true but also could intrigue people like me who haven't bought any but are watching because of lack of knowledge and intrigued on peoples perspectives of it.
---
Ty! Rc or mining maybe. Equally mindnumbing lol :p
---
Thanks!
---
Oh I don't mind the difficulty, I just don't understand how anyone could ever think that this random Slayer monster would be a good idea.
---
Do how much profit are you making off of this?
---
I think they meant the first floor. I remember seeing something like that a while ago.
---
The question is who do you want to support? Youtube and everys single content creator that's on there or only the ones you consume?
---
Gz
---
That's the flash game.

They're so easy to kill though lmao

It’s sad because I really wanted basilisks to have a “revitalization”. This just made it worse, not better

"Before the Evolution of Combat a player using a Frostbite dagger had a 20% chance of dealing an extra 50 magic-type damage with each hit. This passive effect damage was increased to 100 if Frostbite dagger was wielded together with Flameburst defender." - 
---
https://runescape.wiki/w/Frostbite_dagger
---
Those numbers are post-constitution update, so it would be 5 and 10 in OSRS. I guess it would make sense if it came out at the same time as a fire giant boss?
---
&gt;Tfw no toxic deep wildy tribrid gf that tells me to sit and calls me a whale
---
It's very weird indeed, because if you think about it this game is super pay to win. Buy bonds with real money -&gt; sell for gp -&gt; buy BiS gear -&gt; win 
---
But I never hear people talking about this
---
Jesus that’s a lot of dead moles
---
Game ticks are .6 but how would I set the metronome to start at the same time as a game tick?  If I knew how to do that, I could prayer flick
---
Because we voted for it and it was a bad idea from the get go. Putting bis on a regular mob in 2019 is not good content no matter how hard it is, how low the drop rate is, or what it is locked behind. It simply is not fun, easy or hard. This jaw needed to be a boss drop or a raids/pvm challenge drop, locked behind challenging and fun content.
---
The dwh grind is awful. Truly awful. But it isn't bis, and it's mainly got specific niche uses. It's one of those items that you can skip as an iron if you only want to slay and don't care about raids or high level pvm. If you want max gear though, you gotta deal with the jaw grind.
---
Ibans is around ~200gp per cast and trident ~500gp per cast.
---
I'm not ready for your q but I'm ready for your q p
---
Yes runelite but no piety.  Are blue xp drops different than normal xp drops ( are normal xp drops blue)
---
If I flick before my attack then I wouldn’t be prayer flicking considering my prayer would be off for .. ~3 ticks each time then?  
---
Do you lazy flick?

P2W game minus P2W cash shop doesn't fix it unfortunately, the game was designed with P2W in mind from its foundations and it still shows through in unchained.

Good luck outeating the spawn!

How do you pronounce ardougne again? Ar-doug-ney? Huh
---
What kind of question is that? You've just implied you use adblock and now seem to be taking the high ground asking me who I support when you've implied you support nobody whilst I pay to watch ad free YouTube.
---
I support the people I watch and the platform by paying a subscription fee that's inflated due to people using adblocker that indirectly takes money from content creators.
---
Take occult for extra dmg
---
Just turn the unlock off.
---
I feel like they probably wouldn't disclose this information as 'the worst thing they've muted someone for' would be pretty bad.
---
Nah its 13k. And cant get pked here. So if ur 65+ then this is better.
---
Abby for bosses just use dragon you'll make up the money later unless he's on a boss slayer task which tune darts will ripp it apart
---
Right, that was an excellent response a month ago.
---
Also, almost every uses downvotes incorrectly (unpopular opinions or even unpopular facts), and then idiots see a comment with 5 downvotes and instantly believe it's wrong and that the world disagrees with you even if the comment is factually correct.

fair enough, agility is definitely the worst skill by quite a long way lol

Of course lmao.
---
True or just kill regular basilisks, either way it's very clear that I am salty about no jaw
---
Im pretty sure you can just move forward 1 tile instead.
---
Point is that if you want to support the content creators you're actually watching instead of a giant corporate machine, pay them directly via patreon or merch. 
---
When you've already taken the high ground everyone taking at your level seems like they're taking the high ground.
---
Theres also gonna be a dchain upgrade similar to zalcano shard, not sure why they added that nor will it make it in game.
---
Possibly an attempt of balance new content and nostalgia

Or it’s half an hour a day for three years

okay, I understand that.. but that converts them into fish chunks, only viable for barb fishing... I'm suggesting a source for creating "fishing bait" to be used in early game (or late game, ie infernal/sacred eels) or f2p training. Also serves as slow passive afk cooking exp, not a meta. Just an alternative to dropping unwanted fish.

Now he has to farm it again.

definitely! theyre easy points
---
Because while it’s in 1x1 it’s still dealing with thin walls, as well as doors that fit the entire height of the wall or fit on a diagonal of that grid square. 
---
While Minecraft is all blocks and they’re all the same size, in order to get an accurate build somethings are going to naturally be a little different than the other.
---
The house right behind the silver stall for example: in OSRS there’s just enough room to fit a bed and a wardrobe, but in Minecraft that space is huge. I’m trying to figure out if I should put two smaller rooms in there or keep the bedroom huge as it is.

Tried to recover my 14 year old account after it recently got hijacked. Provided about the same info that you have listed here, but mine got denied too. The hijacker has put a .pl (I’m guessing its from Poland) mail to it and I’ve only ever lived in Norway. The recovery system is such bullshit. Good luck on future attempts

I came very close to finishing Varrock, but I have my eyes set on the underground Pass and even Priffdinas with this build, time will only tell how long my ADHD will let me work it.

He obviously gives a shit though. That's why he is responding to everything.

Thin skinned repost b o y

F2p smither alt gang. No need to worry about bonds. Just gotta pay off the cost of 99 smithing with platebodies.
---
Sorry to hear that :/ I wish I understood the system. I'm just confused as to why it was so easy for me to recover at first and then now I can't get it again.
---
See this thread: https://amp.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/amkr0r/i_wrote_code_to_calculate_barbarian_fishing_xp/

Same, took me 23x as many kills to get mine. Unlucky
---
I know i was drunk, annoyed with the tunnels and not prepared. Back to making more air orbs kill me now.
---
Priff Slayer Cave is garbage though. Should contain a Slayer boss at least
---
the people who complain about this get downvoted
---
Wow I’ve never noticed how the entrance to Varrock castle from the fountain isn’t symmetrical until now... I hate it

I fear no man....

But that name - that name scares me

Probably, but not big enough that I feel it's going to be big to complete strangers, just for the sole fact it's me, and they all need to see it too and be proud of me.
---
Can't be coincidence that all these self-important and desperate for approval people don't have friends to share things with lol.

you have good taste
---
Client developer obviously doesn't play rs. 
---
The damn keyboard button is already in the UI all they have to do is remove the big fuck off bar no one wants

Adamant darts are the bare minimum that should be used with a blowpipe for general use.
---
well someone still has to pay for the bonds
---
I built Lumbridge once as well, I got frustrated with the swamp though as I couldn’t get the puddles to line up right with the castle and I had made it in Switch before moving into Java and it was still a lot of retracing my steps.
---
What dirius said. You don't have to eat ever as long as you stay in the mini safespot. It's really afk

I spent too much time picking pockets and stealing from stalls here

About 38m if I remember correctly

No botting no RWT

Only houses? Damn, how long it takes +/-? It`s big rep+

Finally a useful post that usnt some forced mene or confirmation that this sub is a bunch of 11 year old minded middle aged men.
---
With 2 99s, and a casual pace, sure.
---
This is awesome!!!
---
Let’s hope you haven’t purchased this 😂😆
---
This is the most retarded response I’ve ever seen. What the fuck kind of argument is that? Spending $182 on a game for just 1 year is significant, and whether or not it’s “bank breaking” is completely irrelevant. If you were in charge, you’d make a shit manager with that kind of mentality - shutting down customers with “just stop playing” the second any sort of inconvenience arises is a fast way to lose business.
---
There have been plenty of jmods caught abusing their power. Let's look back at mod reach and mod jed as a couple who were fired for such things.  
---
Manipulating the price is done by flooding the market with these holiday items that are only available one week of the year. People pick them up and then sell them since it's free go. The rest of the year they are considered discontinued items so you can no longer get them. Things like Easter eggs and pumpkins are consumables so once used are gone for the year and can not be obtained until that 1 week comes around again. That causes prices to rise up as the year goes on. Look at the price of easter eggs during easter(600-800gp ea) and the price of them now( 2100gp ea). You were able to buy all those eggs people were picking up cheap because so many were coming into the game.
---
I think the difference is that our accounts were banned and yours was just hijacked and cleaned.
---
They are terrible at getting back to people. I tried to jump back into the game a few weeks ago and my account was perma banned for using 3rd party programs when the only thing I’ve ever used was OSBuddy back in the day which I did research and thought it was okay. Still to this day no response to my appeal. 
---
Very disappointing service on their end tbh.
---
Eggly_Peggly
---
As a previous player of both these amazing games, I just had nostalgia overload.
---
Thanks brother!! I need every bit of help I can get right now. It's been a hard fight, maybe hopefully they will see this.
---
&gt; that not every BiS has to be from endgame content.
---
This is the worst take.
---
Oh right so there is no evidence to make your claim. Nice one, cheers.
---
Tried this and it actually happens on both, but much more frequently on just wifi over just mobile data. I was really hoping this was the fix :(
---
What if we are a nolifing student? Oops..
---
&gt; the helmet is just a generic item with stats, it wouldn't be justified as a boss drop unless it has a very good special attack or some unique niche.
---
It's literally the best Melee helmet in the game.
---
Lmfao. Do cooking next
---
Yeah this was through the account recovery page after you click forgot password in client
---
Thanks, I love it
---
That's really dissapointing. I was hoping it wasn't the Android 10 update but I did start to see this behavior after the update. It's only evident in apps that require consistent connection.
---
$11\*
---
I have been ignored by all the mods, because speaking about in game issues on social media platform is prohibited
---
Soooooo what happens to the ppl that spent their bank on the spells
---
What were your approximate costs?
---
most likely they have some information on you that can resemble 70% or more as the owner of the account + they probably have the e-mail locked on to it.
---
Scapecraft is another that went defunct as well due to boredom/owners getting lazy with the project.
---
Oh repost!
---
You should try swapping some of the regular grass blocks with some of the browner variants to get that more accurate color. The name of it escapes me but it’s in the giant taiga biomes. Also, using invisible blocks with command blocks and such would allow you to place banners in midair for the clothes on the clothes line, I noticed the line was empty XD great job overall man, it looks great!
---
Your best bet at receiving a response from Jagex for anything is to post to Twitter or the subreddit.  They don't have a dedicated customer support team.
---
The general perception of this is especially negative based on the fact that the bot detection system isn't perfect, so occasionally genuine non-botting paying users will be banned with no recourse available to them unless they're able to nail \~4k upvotes on Reddit.
---
Ive been playing this game on and off for over a decade now. The two 99s and unique items I had are what took most of my time.
---
Sorry lol I might’ve put too much emphasis on quick tasks. Regardless though sounds like you have a good setup. Me personally I have hellhounds unlocked for Cerberus and But I keep Abby demons blocked just because I’m not too big a fan
---
Yeah, it's gonna be a no from me, dog.
---
It's called mcmmo, the plugin,  and it's capable of being modified to resemble rs' Skilling/leveling system.
---
Oh repostermen!
---
This battle has been going for months
---
Done. What should we name it?
---
I don't think the 500 hours is nothing. I think 1300-1400 total is nothing. Unless the 99's he has are very slow skills, hence the higher playtime, its really not much to start again. Sucks, and is shit if he didn't actually do anything wrong. But 1300 total is literally a 2 week effort for most people.
---
So original
---
Recently just got my fire caps (thanks for the guidance there) and just hit 100cb. I plan on leveling slayer a lot now through Duradel. My only hold back is I don’t really know what gear to invest in. I have slayer helm (i), fury, full obby, obby sword, void (range), no mage gear and about 5m in cash stack. I don’t mind doing quest if needed. Just some guidance on start up gear for melee/range/mage 
---

Do agility rooftops next pog

Most don't though. in fact most charge for the privilege.

That's not how you make a table 😠
---
Shit son, I didn't read the title, I thought this was an RS mod pack, great job!
---
That's pretty cool, tried to do Varrock in 3d few weeks ago didn't end up that far... [https://imgur.com/a/VYrIUpG](https://imgur.com/a/VYrIUpG) was using [legend arts speed paint as reference](https://twitter.com/Legend_Arts/status/1125912307756949504)
---
So you think paying salaries and software licenses for the customer service software is less than $50k/year? Even at $10/hr that barely gets you 2 full time customer service agents per year (without benefits)
---
I thought that might have been the case when I realized the 3 skills you needed were all exactly 5 levels off lol. Well then, maybe take a bit of a break from diaries and do something else that you find fun. Also, it might be worth training your skills so RC is the lowest for tears if you don't want to grind that; though I can understand not wanting to grind Hunter either, but it tends to be a lot quicker.
---
2k more upvotes for a jmod response, good luck!
---
That is something I addressed further down the chain of comments.
---
Oh my, a spoiler of the video game show, on the video game subreddit, where we talk about the video game. How dare they?!
---
Word I turned in 25 elites only got 5 done I just want 10 for league pionts
---
&gt; It might really not be enough of a thing to dedicate resources for
---
Even if it's not enough to warrant dedicated resources, which I seriously doubt, you *always* need some sort of customer support... Even if it's just a role system where everyone does it for an hour a week or whatever. Anything other than winning the lottery on reddit and/or twitter and those twitter helpers that just copy paste stuff because they're not actually part of the company.

This made me realize how harsh fishing has gotta be on my virtual knees

Does anyone have a rough estimate of mage xp per barrows run with iban’s staff? 67 magic btw
---
You can use a rune crossbow, so you can use it with diamond (e) and ruby (e) bolts. Honestly, my own issue is that I only have 56 prayer so I'm constantly having to deal with managing my prayer. The wiki has a guide on how to deal with the waves, what equipment to bring, and what supplies to use.
---
Thats karamja bruh
---
Lucky you. I can't believe I'm reading someone say that customer service "isn't enough of a thing" for a company to pay for.. I feel like the very foundation of your company should be built on supporting your consumers.
---
Almost no other company ever does an authenticator removal delay, and there's probably a reason for that that us plebs on reddit can't see
---
Please release this as a mod of some sort. Holy shit.
---
They released servers that hosted Classic after it was cancelled for awhile. I believe that's the one OP is referring to.
---
What customer support do you need? I've recovered an account, managed billing just fine and never had a problem.  Y'all are the vocal minority, or do you guys really need this much help?
---
You may want an anti venom as well
---
Is that enough seeds from 89-99 farming?
---
Yeah I suggest you report the problem to OnePlus so it can get addressed ASAP
---
While this is true for the IP address issue, someone other than him has a lot of info on his account. Just saying it’s fishy imo.
---
Why would I buy myself silver lmao
---
Half my comments on reddit are negative, I don't need the confidence boost
---
Yeah that might actually be something i do first, so i can at least passively work towards 77 rc, thanks for the input!!!
---
Did you sell your account?
---
Farming guild spirit tree is kinda useless if you have the medium tier jewelry box
---
Ever heard of the armadyl crossbow
---
I'm at the point where I could easily keep bonds up with the one account I have, but I don't. I'd like a tbow and/or scythe sometime soon and I don't want to have spend half my income on membership.
---
This game is grindy enough as it is, I don't want to grind another 10m+ a month that basically just disappears.
---
Customer services &lt; More coke money
---
They don't want account's going back and forth like that  and if you lost the account again after appealing why would they trust you
---
And give Jagex even more money? No thank you, good sir. Also, bonds in this game only giving you 2 weeks of playtime (instead of a month like similar games) is straight greed imo.
---
I must be one of the few who have never had an issue with their support.
---
Who needs customer service when we have reddit and Twitter.
---
Lmao 33$ an hour, funny Guy
---
Yeah I agreed they need better support
---
But to think your 30 cents a day is such a massive cost, that you're so entitled to it is just dumb
---
This reminds me of Port Sarim on F2P worlds at the one wooden dock.

Haha this was the other one I thought folks would get. J. Cole was mine.
---
Smash won't be updated forever. It will be replaced by the next smash game, on the next console, both of which you need to buy for hundreds of dollars a year or two later. 
---
Runescape membership is, unless the game goes down, **infinite**. Smash ultimate, is not. You can't equate the two.
---
The best comparison you can make is to other online MMOs that are infinitely updated, for example WoW. That game is $15 a month, which is more than runescape is. Quit whining.
---
Please use 2FA on your email account in the future. This would've prevented them from hacking the email itself in the first place.
---
Stand there in full justi, lance, insulated boots, etc. then just keep your prayer and hp up with auto retaliate turned on.
---
Quests quests quests. Lunar dip, desert treasure, and horror from the deep on the menu today
---
If it truly was a bare necessity, as you claim, then players would leave. Simple as that. If they are not leaving, its not a bare necessity. 
---
No amount of platitudes are going to change the economics of the situation. 
---
Just dont play is a perfectly valid comment. If it bothers you, dont play. 
---
If it bothers enough people to the point that they do not play, Jagex will invest in it. 
---
Thats literally the reason we have OSRS to begin with.
---
Afk with prayer, full just, lance and those insulated boots
---
Can’t be worse than doing demonic gorillas for a black demon task right?

---
Did you just assume my loneliness?
---
I had something similar. About 10 years ago my first account got hijacked and this year (2019) I tried to recover it and was successful. But the person charged $200 on the account and didn’t pay (on purpose) and got it locked. I’ve appealed to have the money removed and anything they purchased removed but they said they can’t tell if it was made from a different person. (Even though the new email attached was a Poland email and I’ve only ever lived in the states. I’ve had multiple conversations with jagex’s gold tier customer service and to no avail. It’s okay though Bc for past 10 years I’ve played in a completely different account and I’m okay with not playing the old one.
---
Requiring OC all the time is a good way to kill your subreddit.
---
Nice! I think something might be wrong with me mentally. I have 99 range and I still die from JAD lol. Always accidentally misclick attack prayer instead of magic lol
---
Assuming crumble undead in the rune pouch, I think you'll run out of food. I did vorkath around 75 range with the blowpipe and black dhide (which is more dps than rcb) and had to use brews in order to get enough healing (sharks+karam weren't even enough).
---
It could definitely be done. If someone built a full runescape map, all they’d need to do is tweak the Minecraft MMO mod so that the skills matched Runescapes. Obviously some skills would be a lot harder to tweak, specifically the ones they’d have to make from scratch like thieving, runecrafting, Firemaking, etc. but it could be real fun. 
---
Fletching can be made easily, slayer can be easy, woodcutting, minion, fishing. Someone could actually do this.
---
Its a general pain. Lost my old account around 2010. Only got it back in 2017
---
I knew the top comment would be about the rc pet. Lol. Only at 71, too!
---
Sorry man you have to try harder for the upvotes. Try saying you can't sleep at night without the account, or that you used to play with your brother way back. Try gaining some sympathy and the upvotes roll in
---
You could have the Home Portal be Nether Portals and have the nether be a construction free zone, if someone decides to make a server out of this.
---
&gt; And they weren't put there because of a lack of dev time or resources, but because they were intended rewards for that content. CoX is bloated because players kept asking for more rewards.
---
No, Rigour/Augury was clearly forced there because the dev team was small at that time. First they wanted to add it to Nightmare Zone, then Sailing etc. It only passed at CoX because the community feared there won't be any more opportunities to obtain it any better way. That does not imply CoX was the appropriate location of the prayers.
---
&gt; Rigour is the strongest prayer in the game and it comes from endgame content; seems pretty elite to me. Just because Melee has a similar prayer from lower-level content doesn't mean the same should be true of the other combat style.
---
Yes it does, comparable rewards should come from contents comparable in terms of effort/difficulty. If Rigour gave +32% then it would be justified to have a more difficult requirement.
---
Ignoring the blatantly unbalanced Blowpipe, Range was lacking compared to Melee and needed Rigour. 
---
&gt; Ranged is more powerful than Melee.
---
Blowpipe/T-bow should be nerfed. I exempt them from the Ranged skill as a whole. A more balanced comparison should be the crossbow/shortbows.
---
&gt; It is like arguing that the Lance should be 30% like the Crossbow so they are equal
---
The Crossbow should actually be nerfed to 20% rather than buffing Lance to 30%. Range has the ability to farcast so the DPS should not be higher than melee. The crossbow max hit is too high when combined with void/salve amulet (e) on vorkath.
---
Tbh I don't understand not having a phone number. 
---
I needed customer support for a surgical guide design software the other day, the phone they did have was only a terribly recorded voicemail box. It's 2020 in a couple days lol.
---
So many things can be resolved by talking to someone real quick, we all got phones but hardly use em to voice chat lol.
---
I like your item: Large Cog
---
Dude :(
---
!remindme 1 week
---
Depends on your combat level but over to the west of the boss lair (forget her name) there’s a room with like 6 moss giants in it and a narrow corridor where you can fight them where numbers count for nothing
---
I estimate 2.1m total
---
Assuming you use seeds worth 2gp that’ll cost you 137k (there may be a seed worth 1gp)
---
Redwood logs will cost you 1.97m
---
You happen to know what the server was called?
---
I don't quite remember. Either that or instead of P pots.
---
Gotta pay the mole toll to get out of this heck hole
---
How does them keeping the account with the original email account shitty? People have loads of their information compromised all the time, the "hijacker" will have more than just an email address, it's not difficult to find other information readily available especially if OP can't even keep their email address secure. 
---
The fact OP's claiming to keep a record of their IP's since creation is suspicious in the first place, I don't know anyone who actually does that.
---
Genuinely curious. What should the recovery system be?
---
&gt; This game is quite expensive in comparison to similar game
---
Most MMOs are P2W garbage or have sub fees of like $15/month. OSRS is definitely on the cheaper end.
---
The honest truth was had my maxed cb irl buddy stake for me.
---
I’ve brought this up as well. Maybe if enough people do they’ll change it
---
if only this was 2005
---
We have OSRS because of the horrible mistakes that were made by the company in the first place. They bungled the original game so badly that rolling back every update in the last 9 years has a larger playerbase than the game that they've been pumping the majority of their funds into for the last 20ish. If Jagex had LISTENED to their customer base before most of them quit, the game would be in much better shape today. It should never take the majority of a game's playerbase quitting for action to be taken. That's again a ridiculous notion.
---
We've seen from their reports that pretty much any money they make goes back to the investors.
---
6/9 - Nice.
---
Watch a YouTube video on it. It has quite a few settings that are pretty neat for camera options.
---
BRO!!! WHEN THE MAP IS FINISHED PLEASE REVIVE THE RUNESCAPE MOD! I USED TO PLAY A RUNESCAPE MOD SERVER THAT WAS SOOOO FUN BUT THE MAP WAS JUST A RANDOMLY MADE ONE. BRING THIS SHIT BACK FAMO
---
Why not just be honest and say you’re looking forward most to the smack down lol
---
New skill called riding.  Let's you get around faster without using run energy.  At Higher levels the horses can even climb up mountains and walls (think Skyrim horses) or jump small rivers, possibly just replaces agility.
---
This, but replace "coke money" with "sufficient profit margins to keep the Chinese overlord company's MTX cancer confined to RS3".
---
Haha thanks
---
Honestly seems likely given that he de-ironed. Why the hell would you max an ironman and then de-iron it? Such a huge waste.
---
but horses dont exist??? it must be some kind of weird hornless unicorn
---
Same thing happened to my rs3 main. Had it since I found runescape. Cant even talk to a person about it just banned and nothing I can do about it
---
I think rune dragon alts mostly use justiciar and lance.
---
Gottem
---
I got made fun of for using a skill cape at gargoyles because I didn’t have a fire cape and I got so salty I went and got the fire cape before finishing the task.
---
It's at least driven partially by player markets ... As long as people can buy membership with in-game gold, it's easy enough to sweep that discussion under the rug.
---
Bruh I’m shook

If we're talking afk then slayer is good. For fast money you can do raids.
---
Runelite Custom Cursor plugin
---
If someone has your username and password (say for example you still log in with a username instead of an email) then 2FA on your gmail account does absolutely nothing to stop your account from getting recovered
---
Look I know we are feeling a lot of nostalgia for this decade but please don’t make impact memes a thing again
---
I refuse to believe jagex servers are ever to blame for anything wrong happening
---
Have 21m, need 78m, how to make 56 i mean 57m* 
---
Lol. Also osrs.wiki check out the money maker guidelines. They've got recommended strategies and gear, etc. Very helpful!
---
Well after reading posts about security and info for appeal, I may start logging my IP also, so you'll now know someone else who does.
---
With 21m you can easily do margin flips and make 200-500k every hour or so consistently with little effort while doing something else.  I usually slay and teleport to GE after each task or after birdhouse runs.
---
What's in the chests in the west banks basement?
---
Jagex is very cheap and probably neglected to pay a few vendors.
---
I have a massive erection just thinking about it.
---
Always has been like this
---
Lol nope. 
---
People huffing and puffing on social media doesnt do anything. Its an avenue approved by official channels in most cases because it stymies actual pro consumer changes. The only thing that forces that is consumers choosing to stop consuming. 
---
Its a two way relationship until people like you try to stop it from being one. 
---
Its hilarious that you bring up basilisk knights, because the social media outrage was over the buff itself that was implemented, which did not change. 
---
Let me guess, you think it was people posting on twitter that caused Jagex's abrupt 180 on the banning of Runelite and not the mass amounts of people cancelling membership?
---
Lol at lvl 94, kinda garbage
---
Sorry but why do you need to change your email to do Varrock med?
---
Demonics are better money and faster kills if you are good at switching.

He isnt going to do that.
---
Yes it's a normal male name
---
It's a pretty unhealthy way of carrying a heavy object.
---
Fair i don't keep up with prices i'm a ironman with 200m cook
---
That would be a big F.
---
If that's the case, it may be time for a good, old fashioned internet scrub of his info.
---
Boddy
---
You need to set up an Authenticator to complete the strong hold of security. Which is for the med diary.
---
You killed that many in one setting? Damn dude
---
Seriously ?
---
I could of swore it wasn't always like this..
---
...but RuneLite is legal and approved by Jagex...
---
Nah, just didn't close runelite, I'm killing around 50/h !
---
Its always been like this, and there isnt really a reason to change it. Bruteforcing of passwords is not practical, and doesn't happen in any meaningful way for RS accounts. 
---
Adding more length to your password will make it more secure in every instance if you feel the need for a stronger password.
---
I think I averaged about 40 casts per run at around that level
---
Damn man!!!
---
I’ve been wondering how much profit birdhouses to 99 are thanks for an estimate. I’m 70-93 from only birdhouses and plan to only do them for 99
---
show me the evidence of massive amounts of people cancelling membership and I will gladly concede to that argument.
---
Fake. It's more zoomed in when you come back to the surface.

Where's old-school RuneScape though? Rs2 is dead.

Once i get my acc back

Still waiting for any evidence lad

---
I think WoW is upwards of 20 dollars.
---
But I wouldnt call osrs p2w because the members gear cant be used on f2p servers.
---
That's not an issue. You start doing them at 60 slayer and by 99 you'll have killed thousands of knights. Obviously you can't just afk them constantly like rune drags, but you can still kill a lot
---
yeah thats ok thanks
---
The expansions are great. The base game is huge. Each expansion is about 15+ hours of content and only about 25 bucks. Thats not including the bonus classes either. The expansions are well worth the money.
---
Right?  
---
“Look at the discord!!! “
---
If I knew it existed and how to find it this thread wouldn’t exist
---
It's so terribly slow that it's only useful on maybe an iron. You can buy rune items in bulk and make more per alch and it'll be more worth it
---
Luckily it was my main not iron man
---
Yes I found it thanks, although it only says over 500 hours. I wanted to really see how much of a life I don’t have
---
Rc is faster than agility even without runners.
---
Remindme! 3 days
---
Omg can I join your world!?!
---
I’ve been playing for a decade. I’ve probably put in $1000 for this game. Fuck me.
---
Love your content man.
---
Unfortuantely you botched this poll, because you haven't explained how bonds should be treated for the purpose of this poll. Bonds are not RWT, that term has usually been reserved for illegal buying of gp. You might have a different belief, but not specifying it will skew your results.
---
I never RWTed, but I did buy a couple bonds to start me up when I restarted in OSRS. It's a perfectly legitimate way of getting some gp if you need it badly and it supports the game. Nothing wrong with it.
---
!remindme 3 days
---
and you get way more content, like idk about you but i've been playing 2 years straight, at least 1-2 hours per day, sometimes way more than that. no other game (except wow and the elder scrolls genre) has ever kept my attention that long, and i didn't play even play wow nearly as much. it's basically that much for a game you put down after like a week or two of playing.
---
&gt;ds2 
---
well for Rune drag alt OFC ;)
---
But favorite quest was indeed DS2 or ( and for the life of me I can't recall it's name) the one where you had to sneak around a castle in an instance :D
---
wc and mining
---
People like sick nerd weren't even complaining about them being easy, they were complaining about them being boring. I think most of us expected something more like gorilla difficulty. Jagex just changed them the wrong way and make them more boring and slower.
---
Pretty common scam "buying full bandos (or any end game pvm gear) for 2147b", but they only offer 2147 platinum tokens or 2.147 m worth. People are so excited to get a max cash stack they trade away 60m. Dont ever trade at G.E. and you wont get scammed
---
Please turn on PM :)
---
Dude you’re the one trying to nitpick the argument so I’m just doing the same to you.  The simple fact is we pay for membership and we don’t have customer service.  IMO that’s wrong.  
---
It doesn’t matter if it costs $10/month or $30. If dominos didnt answer the phone when the pizza was late, I’d be just as annoyed.
---
You have given them more than enough information. What a terrible company.
---
just did lol
---
I wouldn’t bother getting arma yet. I would get the dhl and start raiding! Also very good for vorkath so you can camp him for cash
---
I spend $200 - $300 a year On my various accounts
---
Well you still have to grind the levels and xp and learn mechanics et cetera. Buying BiS gear won’t get you a fire cape. It might make it easier but there’s still skill involved. Same with buying bonds for supplies to skill.... you can’t buy xp like on World of Warscape, I mean Rs3. You STILL have to use all those planks on your house, you still have to make all those potions, you still have to run those ores through the blast furnace. Everyone knows having a lot of gp helps, and I’ve never even bought bonds, but I certainly dont think that being able to purchase gold instantly makes a game “pay to win.” The day that xp is directly available for money, THEN we have a problem...
---
Hey man, Gz! I got the farming pet yesterday aswell on a tree run, somewhere between level 40-42 doing willows. I didn't realise until like 20 mins into making potions at the GE. I misclicked and walked a few tiles away and this tree was following me. Good guy at the GE told me about insuring him so I did that ASAP!
---
Yo that dog's gonna f up your screen
---
The middle ground is lowering their defence, increasing their offense, and giving them actual mechanics like demonic gorillas.

---
That's because there's only so many IPv4 public addresses so most are on private IPs routed through a public router/gateway. They shouldn't be given out willy-nilly.
---
People will say it’s fake
---
What are you using at skotizo that uses p pots
---
I'll add you when I get on
---
Mining would just be mining a block and waiting for it to reappear lol
---
Is that v50?
---
I did 77 doing lavas on mobile, I feel that pain...
---
Correct, that’s why I said cost difference😉
---
Always useful to look up quests that give specific experience rewards on wiki:
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quest\_experience\_rewards](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quest_experience_rewards)
---
it's literally like a 1 hour and 15 minutes of vorkath to play for two entire weeks lmao. unless you're a noob you shouldn't be complaining about bonds. any main at endgame can pretty much, at any time, be able to afford like 6 bonds  no problem at all unless you're broke as a joke.
---
Someone getting fuckin mauled in the blue moon inn
---
200 iq memes around here boys
---
22 seconds ill never get back
---
People just don't really care. Getting max cash or max gear isn't really impressive anymore on a main, and since 99.99% of players aren't competing for any hiscores it doesn't really affect most of us. Sure, some of the people you run into might have spent $1000 on a t bow or something, but it kind of doesn't matter in a game like osrs.
---
Rc yeah, but disagreed with Agility. Agil is actually not that slow and for sure not as painful. And it is also completely free to train, or even makes you money, which is not insignificant to many players.
---
Seriously impressive !!!  You should be proud
---
Yeah even small things like hiding attack styles from one account, different tile markings, etc etc it helps a ton
---
That is an interesting rollercoaster for an account hcim--&gt;ironman--&gt;normalman
---
Not everyone can afford just paying down $90 right away. I would love to but I don't have that money. Hence why monthly is easier.
---
Why the shield?

Veteran of 16+ years, your comment is mostly true but as proven by probably hundreds of threads on 2007scape, legitimate support requests come up all the time and we get to see how they were massively mishandled first hand.
---
So yes, and no. I don't think we should be arguing for it to be okay for a company worth hundreds of millions to skip out on customer support.
---
You're an ass.
---
Ok Boomer
---
Okay, we will get right on that!
---
Determination! (And efficient use of off time, yeah.)
---
I had made the complete lumby, if you ever want to work on it as well I'd be down. I even had custom devs with my version I had.
---
Literally just recovered a blizzard account a couple weeks ago with my DL and it took less than 48 hrs lol.
---
Never bought gold and never bought a bond. It cheapens the rewarding feeling of amassing gold and purchasing stuff on my own. 
---
I think people that rwt are scum. It doesn’t exactly ruin the game for other players, but it’s always in the back of my head if I should be impressed by someone’s gear/riches or if they just bought it with real world money. You can never have that certainty and that takes away from my experience personally.
---
I don’t like the idea of buying bonds for gold being in the game but I feel like it’s a necessary evil to help counter rwt. It is what it is.
---
There HAS to be droves of skilled builders willing to help you with this project dude
---
It’s $11 per account.  I personally pay $20-40/ month depending on how many accounts I feel like having.
---
Wtf I thought we were friends?
---
prif would be cool if it had a miniquest. the shit behind priff is way too interesting. theres a black dragon, a colony of tree people, and a bunch of cool characters.  id love more backstory
---
And downvoted
---
It lets you go back to your house from the farming guild though, if you have a tree in your house. I like it because it’s a super fast bank from the house, and then you can go back to your house and tp anywhere.
---
They do have customer service, it's actually pretty average compared to most other companies.
---
They've just started a precedent where you can go to reddit and if you get enough upvotes you can skip the queue/get your problem addressed more closely  looked at
---
New phone, who diss?
---
I’ll be your friend if you want, I’m also on the no osrs friends gang as my friends list is alllll inactive. My rsn is “Kang Butae” hit me up and we can be friends!
---
It really be like that
---
I was wondering how rare my account would be with jad pet at 1 kc, I cant wait for the slayer tasks to grind this guy now that I have a decent footing
---
Who cares
---
If you play multiple accounts, you should be using bonds to supplement membership fees.
---
Dont think 10 yo you had dustdevils back then ;)
---
Answer is no, he bought it and original owner scammed him lmao.
---
Fish lvls?
---
That's just your opinion though.  Strength is by far the most bang for the xp in increasing further xp gains.  Check an xp rate calculator and tweak strength.
---
Then you should know Pakistan exists
---
Quests, then do roof tops and if you dont care about marks do wilderness course asap
---
It’s me, Mario!
---
Someone watching yall thinking you all are high as fuck
---
shitty task but i stuck with it and got my jaw about 700 kc, stick with it. (on task preferably)
---
Exactly.  This ungrateful asshole probably uses air conditioning too instead of a handheld fan like we did back in the day.  Unreal how people want things to improve, the gall of these folks.
---
I'm trying to max in 2020. I'm 2180 total now with 10 99's right now. I have plenty of money to use on the buyables and I can afk mobile at work a lot so I hope I can make it :).
---
do you not get shards?

Moving from one area to the next cancels damage, I used to run into this early on in twisted league I would try to finish kill 2 at brutal black dragons before climbing the vine but my prayer didn't always last, so I would stay in as long as I could before climbing and it would always cancel the last damage before going up the ladder, but usually it wouldn't show the damage itself before cancelling it. It's possible that if you climb the same tick it would still cancel, or because I'm your case you received two sets of damage in one tick it's possible the game was delaying the damage from the second hit until the next tick but because you were already transitioning areas it cancelled entirely.
---
bless em
---
I meant the  1hp a minute regen happened when you got hit the last time and then got delayed by server lag/climbing up the rope. But then again it could be a glitch that happens sometimes. 
---
I got a clip of me tick eating perfectly but dying to sotitzeg special attack so sometimes the game glitches/server lags.
---
J Peg
---
Barrows, and when you get there bursting/barraging nechryaels in Kourend. They drop a lot of rune items and runes, so you usually come out on top.
---
All you have are gameplay screens. Where are the exchanges with J mods, denials, proof you used the IP addresses, and screens of the account in its infancy and creation? 
---
Any idiot can show people runelite screenshots, or take 50 screens and label them “hydra leather 4”. 
---
You bought an HCIM, sucked and died with it, then de ironed because Ironman was too hard.
---
Amazing work!
---
Just do the level 1 fire cape
---
I was assuming a call center in Pakistan which will cost the company around $8/hr.  Setting it up in the Cambridge office would be a really bad idea.

I don't even like deep wildy PKing but shit like this makes me want to throw on brid gear and slap clue hunters
---
I do on my main but I play different alts every few months
---
Yeah i think it'd help if you bring some of those.
---
The niche of this meme is next level.
---
Had my account hacked and botted, but was able to regain access of the account and appeal the ban, maybe you'll be able to do that?
---
Yeah i've seen several guides and attempt it every now and then. Once when I have more free time I'll commit to it and get it :)
---
I don't even have an email for recovery since my acc was created in 2002-2003, what am I supposed to do?
---
Hmm, I need a lot more money then. Guess I'll stick to myths guild for now
---
Most people that play are people in their 20's that grew up playing. I started in 2006 on Miniclip for example
---
23
---
Please do explain? You listed a bunch of claims without any actual explanation or proof as to how a username acc is less secure, at the end you say “the email you use to log in can’t be changed”
---
It’s a username acc, you don’t use an email to log in.... do you even know what you’re talking about or did you just feel like saying things
---
Can someone please edit this so one person asks what everyone's fishing levels are, and then follows it up with a "nice"?
---
There will always be toxic people,  but finding the right group of friends to enjoy this classic game together makes it so great. That being said, add me! Would love new friends to play with: MaxinMike
---
Maybe the fact that they cant own up to being on some bullshit
---
I wish my issue was resolved this easy!
---
hahah he said walmart so you know he's american and has expensive living costs and low hourly wages, but he doesn't know the rest of the world actually has liveable wages and living costs LOL !!! Hilarious lmfao holy shit! Minimum wage here is over $13 USD! Wow! Take that and rewind it back, lil john got the beat that make your booty go clap!
---
You should make a server! I would love to help.
---
I am saying the mis prioritization is the problem. You acknowledge it but say its not a problem. 
---
It's a mindset thing. I work super hard and demand the same from the people around me. I do everything possible to deliver only the highest quality to all customers and expect the same from everyone around me. Other people are happy just kinda working hard. What ever the result is, as long as we tried it's all meh anyway so who cares.
---
I'd like one please!
---
Yea it’s shocking TBH. I think most people that play now remember the miniclip days
---
This is the best thing I have seen this decade.
---
Join "07 helpers" clan chat. Assortment of good pals there who know the game pretty well. We always like hearing about people's progress :)
---
07 for pking. Rs3 for bossing and questing!
---
Just my 2¢ as a guy who actually has "hacking" experience. I say hacking with quotes because I do stuff like pen testing. If I were to hack for financial gain, but wanted to stay out of trouble and keep my cushy job, I'd hack RuneScape accounts. Specially with how stupid easy it is and when you can get $600 like the above guy mentioned, all while keeping your 'skills sharp'. 
---
Literally anyone with enough patience can 'hack' (steal) an account.
---
# Sureee
---
Gamble it for the pet! /s
---
Gzz it's the first of many pvm accomplishments
---
From your comments it appears that you literally only care about money and not exp, in which case why the hell arent you just doing raids/zulrah/vorkath.
---
Youre a bit of a tool.
---
Well done I think you’re ready for tob perhaps infernal
---
I have over a thousand hours in Rocket League but that's over the course of fucking years of game play. Even half of that is is still a ton of time lost.
---
You do realize people joke right?
---
Max cape
---
Maxing
---
Nobody steals a secure account, you're shady as fuck.
---
I'm innocent until my guilt is proven
---
Just consider expenses that you have autonomy over then. 1 month of membership is the same as 1 bought lunch. Skip a bought dinner once a month and you've easily supplemented your RS addiction. 
---
&gt;Making money on RS is also a lot less effort than a lot of jobs.
---
Speak for yourself. I have a maxed main that I can't even be bothered using as a RD alt or Vorkath alt to make bonds on. Bonds also feel like anti-progress to me, and I've never enjoyed using them.
---
Good times. Simple times
---
I just removed 2FA from my secondary email account, no human intervention required.
---
I was manually perm muted from like 2008-2017 or so because I told someone my email over private chat. 
---
Had to make a reddit post to eventually get un-muted. 
---
I found out from a mod later on that it was because I had made an account named “pedofil3d” or something when I was younger, making fun of defil3d  
---
Anyways, point being, sometimes there’s more that goes on behind the scenes than just getting muted or banned on a single account for a single instance. Sometimes it comes from things you’ve done on other accounts.
---
If you can’t figure it out, try playing for another month or two. This question is really stupid.
---
24. Started in the miniclip days. Recently started playing again
---
Oh you need the whole set for the bonus on it
---
Oh. Im dumb then. Does it get used up 1:1 ? Maybe thats what im remembering
---
&gt;find a better source of income.
---
Thanks I’m cured. 
---
That’s some shit a boomer who retired at 50 would say, after working at the post office his whole life making slightly more than minimum.
---
Huh
---
So long
---
Not every loot table needs to be buffed.
---
If you're too cheap/poor to pay 5m + scales cost for a serp then you're not spending 30m on jaw. And again, jaw is not a raids drop like avernic or a high lvl slayer boss drop like prims. Those only cost as much as they do cause the reqs to even get them are so high, not because the DPS boost they provide is that substantial. It should cost about the same as torture imo.
---
No, it seem like 1 thread is used up every 2-3 crafted items or so
---
OK I need to see how to do this now
---
That looks like the UK to you?
---
Gratz you king!
---
Ahh ok lol. That must be what i was thinkin of.
---
I just want to know why it’s an ad to be honest lol
---
Happened to me as well but on an IPhone XS. Did you just happen to he recording when it crashed or could you reliably recreate it?
---
I think in classic they could break
---
Please, do I have to legit pay a osrs team member to look in to THE REASON WHY I WAS PERMAMUTED? I will legit send them money through paypal or something if they can look into this for me at this point, I would PAY for jagex to provide me a reason why I was permamuted, although they said in the original "your permamuted" offense message that the "reason and proof" was sent to my email, which neither email that was previously and currently associated with account received.
---
f
---
Cute how people jump straight into the conclusion lmao
---
No, people are 99% retarded and miss the obvious support button on the main page.
---
It has a lot of common problem solutions, but if that fails, you can write a ticket, and those tickets get answered.
---
I've dealt with arenanet, where my ticket literally took more than a month, and with fucking MICROSOFT, where it took over a week to get an answer.
---
Dealing with support is usually something that happens very rarely, i've had to deal with jagex support only twice in over my 10 years of playing.
---
Try to remove Protonmail 2fa (you can't) or Blizzard 2fa (have to talk to a blizzard employee). Gmail is relatively secure due to requiring confirmation to login far from home. AOL requires confirmation with a real person. Cell Phone carriers frequently require a phonecall.
---
There are companies with extra security measures that results in them being able to give their users the benefit of a faster 2fa removal, Jagex is not one of them.
---
He did include bonds btw.
---
I didn't know that. I usually sell mine when I have like 200 or so, at which point it's still really fast to crush them myself.
---
You would waste it if you had it back anyway.
---
Wow that’s insane gratz bro. I am obligated to hate you a little though, so let for getting two Vorkath pets before 500 kc when I’m over 3600 without my pet but still that’s awesome af.
---
High combat lol. They're afkable and terrible monsters anyway. Just block them
---
that just feels wrong
---
I don't think that's why these other items are that expensive, except for avernic. If prims cost so much because of the boss reqs and not because of the dps increase, they wouldn't be  8x as much as eternal
---
Hah was this in an aussie world?
---
Yes new BiS does need to be behind end-game content now 'cause power creep can only happen slowly. The helm upgrade was wasted on a shit slayer monster. That was a potential raid reward and ideas are already hard to come by without just boosting power creep further. Neitz helm is an old item where that kind of balancing wasn't needed as much but we are a lot further and a lot more knowledgeable about the game and its balancing needs that anyone should know it was a terrible decision.
---
You go man, you tell those demons in your head that youve had enough!
---
That is some extremely slow progress my man...
---
Only if i logged onto this shit game
---
Considering that Google of all people can't validate that my own email belongs to me given all the info I provided them I highly doubt that Jagex is capable of doing so.
---
They are a bare bones team and don't have time to look into this manually.
---
Just do the rooftop courses till 99 and make some cash to start the game with it
---
22, i highly doubt there are many kids that play this game
---
Afaik they’ve always been more of an xp focused task than loot. That being said, I always thought the pre-EOC update for different tiered demonic ashes and urns to train prayer was a cool change. Not sure we need more prayer training avenues but I thought the change was a nice change
---
Crazy how he's the one talking about circlejerking.
---
MVP right here
---
Not every drop table needs to shit out gp mate, they’re piss easy with no slayer requirement too.
---
I’d like one please
---
Afk with tbow
---
Veteran pest control games are almost always under 2 minutes each, how are you getting 7 minute games?
---
Sometimes. I took a break from the game for a about 1.5 years and came back to multiple of my accounts hacked. I recovered both of them and they were both perm banned for botting. Appealed both of them and only one of them got a response unbanning it. I never even got a response on the other account. I’m assuming it’s because the hijacker attempted to appeal it himself...no clue
---
A piece of shit for picking up an item that another dude had to miss for an entire 60 seconds because he was killing a gorilla and not finishing the one he started?
---
Seems like a just reward to me lmao
---
Thanks man xd
---
Wishful thinking haha. It hurts thinking if i hit drop rates id have 210m+ more. So now im in a position where its like ok..itll sort of even out eventually right? :( 
---
I think my hydra rng is just broken and the coding for a claw drop is actually 1/1500000. Hell i even got rune javs the other week (rarest item can get from hydra). 
---
The rough life..
---
Reddit's hive Mind is horribly misportraying the support of this game.
---
It's by no means the best in its class but it's easily acceptable quality. 
---
People sometimes compare it to blizz which is hilarious to me. Just compare the companies profits and say they should have anywhere near equal resources.
---
thank mr skeltal
---
Odd one out event
---
**I am a mole and I'm digging a hole...**
---
I made the picture in photoshop, the cup vendor is Tervis.
---
When you buy an account, someone else can recover it. That person is most likely the one who “hacked” the account. This situation would make absolutely no sense if he was the account seller. 
---
He only needs to show Jagex exchanges and proof he’s played this game from start to finish. Idk where you’re getting that he needs to show personal info, that’s absolutely ridiculous. He could show that he’s paid for membership throughout his accounts history using only dates and all sensitive information redacted, but there’s no need to when he can just show shots of him as a lvl 3 or gaining low levels. 
---
You yourself have it backwards and wrote a giant wall of text to explain it. Fucking stupid. “LOL”
---
For money, it's mostly gem mining and amethyst mining. For training it's iron at lower levels, and then motherlode for somewhat afk training.
---
Guess you had the same idea as me hahah
---
Thepoint.meme
---
Why does it matter what the slayer level of the monster is? It drops a bis item that boosts dps more than any other helmet, so its going to be expensive. If people thought it was too expensive, it would go down in price.
---
So if you sell gold on one account they should just assume you wont on the other?
---
Clearly he pushed the rules as a kid. He likely didn't really think about it, cos he was a kid, but a mute stops further incorrect behaviour while allowing you to play.
---
Quest cape 
---
99 Agility
---
99 Magic
---
At the moment I'm just rotating training all combat and magic while tanning cowhides and mining. I also go to the dudes who are powerskilling and just take their stuff.
---
The billing ones are the most common legit ones I've seen. But they're also the ones always resolved. So what's your point?
---
I can only get away with super super afk stuff since I am away from the game for 5-15 minutes at a time, so I usually just stick to sand crabs
---
I'd like one please
---
I killed 1555 rune dragons on my iron going for the dcb. People tagging and teleporting out was a big annoyance. if I noticed it had been tagged I just walked under it but I didn't catch it every time. Probably 50-100 kills I didn't get the loot.
---
easy. he has 30 fletching.
---
Lmao right op probably had a RAT on his computer when he was recovering his previously keylogged account
---
The patience is real
---
Yes, they make you pay for each account separately so they should be treated as such.
---
Getting one account permabanned for botting also doesn't mean the other account should be touched.
---
We all play the game differently and just because you play different from me doesn’t mean I can hate on how you play. So good luck getting back your account dude
---
Does this run decently? This might be a cheap way to tablet for me.
---
But why did someone pay their actual money for it to show up as an ad is what I’m wondering lol, it’s not THAT deep, I know how it works bud.
---
Hundreds of threads... Of liars trying to game the system and then they waste time. People say support is slow, it's because this community now expects them to respond and investigate every banned person who goes "nuh uh I didn't do it" without using the actual appeal process (because *they know they don't have info or a valid point to stand on*).
---
Outside of Jed scenario, I've seen less than 10 legit cases where someone was perma'd and couldn't get support but it turned out to be a false positive. And those got resolved. I've had 3 issues in 5 years that I've needed support on. And 3/3 times I got it within 24 hrs of submitting my ticket.
---
So there's definitely a minority of players with a legit reason to distrust support. But for the majority it does it's job.
---
29 here, hardly ever play without smoking
---
what age category would your gf consider autistic people in their mid-20s?
---
Do whatever you enjoy! That’s the most important thing with OSRS.
---
Congrats, not the biggest fan of hunter myself, sounds pretty painful
---
I think it happens because you can't die ontop of an obstacle. So instead of killing you inside the rope block it heals you. I've seen people taking lethal damage from the floor in Mount korrum survive like this too.
---
&gt; not trying to shit on your parade op
---
Doubt
---
The honest response is that they have a customer service. Their ticketing system works okay, specially for billing issues. It just has a few cracks and is a bit of a mess to navigate, so the meme kinda was born.
---
Obviously it could and has to be much better, but it's not like people are just left to their own devices
---
Because a mid lvl slayer monster with a good drop should be profitably farmable by mid lvl players. At the original difficulty and assuming jaw leveled out around 10m, a mid lvl player could still prob profit 500k/h or so in the long term and would still make some money if they never saw a jaw drop. Now, even for max players, doing basilisks is a gp loss until you get a jaw and when you do you prob averaged like 750k/h, maybe 1m/h. They're just a terrible slayer task for anyone at any lvl now. Pre-nerf they were something everyone could do for some profit.
---
I mean in terms of difficulty/length of kills. I’ve killed plenty of demonics but never killed a basilisk knight, what makes them so horrible to fight?
---
You can prevent that issue by submitting a ticket stating your changing address. I've done so myself.
---
It also doesn't get banned simply from playing from a different location. If he was moving around every few weeks, that would trigger it
