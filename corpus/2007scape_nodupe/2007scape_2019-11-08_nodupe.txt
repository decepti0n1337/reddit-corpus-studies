I try to put them behind mages, I'll flick proc melee to run under them if necessary
---
Oooo I always wondered about this. Dds special attack always confused me - is it stabbing or slashing? But if it's slashing, don't I have crappy slash bonus?  
---
  
---
Dds' spec is now confirmed to be based on stab attack bonus offensively and slash bonus defensively. This makes it better than expected at skele wyverns, which from personal experience could be true, yet pretty bad against dragons in general, which also seems true. I've brought my dds to rune dragons before and can confirm the spec sucks even with all BiS equipment. Rune dragons have +115 slash def, but +30 stab def, so are perfect for confirming dds is a stab-slash spec if anyone wants to. I am convinced personally, though.

This is genuinely a very good idea. Having it as a rare drop from cows makes it a novelty item and a market to be created.

It's not something they can detect on their end. The only person who can truly know if a specific vote was made out of spite is the individual voter them self, and they might even be disingenuous in their evaluation of themselves in the first place.
---

---
Something we can say for sure is that spite voting to some extent does occur, though if it has ever effected the end result of the poll is something we can't have absolute confidence in. Making the assumption that a poll failed due to mass spite voting is an even greater assumption than assuming 1 individual spite voted, which we've already said the only person who even has a chance of knowing is the voter them self.
---
Basically while the stipulation of interaction with the content comes with the positive of removing most of the spite voters, it unfortunately does remove genuine voters who just don't happen to interact with the content but might vote no due to perceived negative impacts it will have on the game as a whole. (Which I think is something Jagex is willing to accept the compromise of.) There's also the large probability that this will even further divide the already fragmented community of PvPer's and PvMer's. While that's not a big deal on it's own, it will eventually make the wilderness less and less hospitibale for Pvmer's, which is already being done pretty well as it is. Haha holy shit what the fuck am I even doing, I haven't played this game in months.

If they end up doing a magic attack is there time to switch to magic pray on reaction?

jk, I support some kind of change to this.
---
Do you think there is any hope to solve the root cause instead of focusing on bandaid solutions like restricting votes?
---
I ask this, because I feel like the more Jagex doesn‚Äôt poll, and forces decisions on players, the more the players distrust them.
---
It seemed like the gmaul update did more harm than good and hurt entry level pking.
---
Isn't that how the food chain works? I think a better way to put it would be this: You shouldn't be allowed to regulate the way someone else has to play the game when you yourself shall never suffer the same regulations. Non PKers having the vote of how PKers get to play makes zero sense when PKers have zero influence over the way you play. They literally don't have other places to go, PvP worlds are a joke. For them to PK, they have to be in the wild. So why should someone who doesn't PvP be allowed to control the way PKers play the game? My votes don't mean shit to the state south of me, why would they? It wouldn't make sense. Allowing polling for specific target audiences may be the best balance between PKers and Non-PKers if it was given a chance to be tested.

Any change to one part of the game can potentially affect another aspect of the game in unexpected ways.  To deny one group the ability to vote for or against changes simply because they don't want "something" and never have doesn't make that "something" a good idea.
---
Jagex already adds "integrity" changes to the game when something they want fails a poll or re-poll questions which pass until they fail(by 0.7%).  Allowing Jagex to completely ignore groups which will likely feel the effects of updates is a decent way to get things like MTX or EoC
---
to be fair there's no much point to get 99 construction other than the (admittedly extremely good) cape. obviously like, 83 for a max house is amazing but beyond that more levels don't really do much. as opposed to prayer while although levels above 77 may have very marginal impact they at least do something.
---
100% support. 
---
Did they ever add a free skip to killerwatt tasks given the epilepsy warnings etc?
---
I like your stance
---
Thank you for putting the time in your original comment and replies. Puts nicely into words a lot of what I was feeling
---
Yea, they kinda ruined it. What made it worse is they failed the poll to have it tradeable.

Is there other ways of earning rc xp?

Cool man. You still play OSRS? We should get some bossing going together.
---
I seem to be getting a bit more rune ore since doing the diary for sure. Maybe a 50% increase in rune ores? Can't say much about the other ore quantities, but the more rune ore is definitely a noticeable profit increase.

"We've... we've done it...
---
...shit those old men never beat the Inferno how much is Justiciar"
---
Well, they should balance it so everyone can't have 20 players on one guy first! That way when they nerf the bulwark it actually makes sense as a means to promote solo pkers.
---
If they nerf the bulwark first, singles clans are just going to have even less counterplay. Singles clans existed before the bulwark was introduced - don't forget that. The bulwark is being used as the counterplay to singles clans with the side effect that it is too strong for actual solo pkers.
---
Balance 101: you nerf the cancerous strategy first and then nerf that strategy's counterplay.
---
Mainly USA timezones but we have members from all over the world
---
Yeah, the d scim will actually boost his dps. Makes sense to prioritize that. D slayer has decent xp rewards at low levels, but if you don't want dragon slayer tasks it makes sense.
---
Just hop around looking for a 3 man team. Fyi, most 4 man teams dont appreciate you joining as their loot gets worse, but you can ask and 5 man sometimes.
---
If you are a pure let us know and we will wave that requirement.
---
I really like the farming guild location as I do a lot of farming contracts, plus it's right by a bank. Also, your house doesn't count towards the total, so you can do one in the farming guild and one in the house. It's definitely the one I use the most.
---
The second tree I planted was in brimhaven for fruit tree/calquat runs which was nice.

I just finished planting the rest of them (yay boosting to 99) but have yet to use any of them

The pker vs civilian cat and mouse has been integral to the Wilderness‚Äôs design since the beginning.
---
I hope the porting skill passes the poll.
---
no idea why it replaced all my returns with with spaces, might of been something to do with the mobile site but fixed now I hope
---
I agree, always thought this was the way to go.
---
Possible ways to improve would be to have different leagues, which would determine:
---
Pre set / no pre set gear
---
Max stats / player stats
---
Cash risk / no cash risk 
---
Also, within leagues, as per Elo there would be brackets such as league of legends or any other game bronze, iron, steel, mithril etc.
---
The season would last X weeks and depending on where you placed a reward is given (sorry no btws get rewards - you can play for fun tho!). A cosmetic would be sweet too.
---
If this sort of elo based PvP was introduced I would actually play it.
---
Nice!
---
nooooo MATH BAD!!! Lol ok thanks yeah that should help.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt advocate for grinding out clues unless you have a max house, unless you‚Äôre an Ironman.
---
He's not level 126? Wtf?
---
Never said they can‚Äôt vote, they would just need to meet the criteria to vote. There‚Äôs people who will vote negatively just so a specific price of content won‚Äôt come into the game. There was a voting poll in the past that had bots vote poorly on it on purpose so it wouldn‚Äôt pass. I‚Äôm glad their implementing this into the game. Can‚Äôt please everyone.
---
Dont forget houses for quick telly and pools.
---
I mean ya.... That game is almost 20 years old dude
---
It really be like that
---
 **X D**
---
Holy shit i didnt even think of that lmao
---
Has anyone done a similar thing where they get every skill a few XP away from 99 and then do like a waterfall type of thing where they get all 99s in a matter of like 30 seconds? That‚Äôd be a cool video to see
---
Ya but you got howuchining exp dude? No need to be rude
---
Alternatively, you could imagine a guy named Mcgroober dying of Lou Gehrig's Disease.
---
Nobody is going to open that video, your title is too vague
---
&gt; And now the new suggestion is to lock players out who don't PvP?
---
That is not quite what they've suggested.  Previously when they talked about restricting PvP polls only to PvPers, they mentioned making the items only work in BH and PvP Worlds rather than any PvP or the Wilderness. If they did limit it like that, then it is more reasonable to limit the voters since there isn't a reason to use those worlds outside PvP (and making planks or such).
---
But if they were offering a new BiS PvP Weapon that worked in the Wilderness and only polled to players with BH kills, then that would be an issue. That said, from how they've discussed it, it seems they are aware of those issues. Like you said, the Wilderness isn't just PvP, so you shouldn't assume when they talk about limiting PvP polls that they mean Wilderness polls too.
---
Playing on and off for the past 5 years, never had an issue. I also created an email specifically just for osrs so I will never have to worry anyway since all security is activated across the board. The 'regular' occurance is due to poor security by the user or using an account from back in the day that had leaked their info at one time or another. I also made an account with my old login and still no issues.

Do you not realize the difference in these companies? Jagex does need to do better, but you can't honestly compare jagex to blizzard and say "but they're only $4 more!". They have support for all games, including one that doesn't take much to upkeep.
---
Because that's literally not the case. It's not just 5%. It's a ton of people, even PKers. It would have polled north of 50%. 
---
Look at this thread from May: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/boktbl/potential_gmaul_update/
---
Just one of many examples of people agreeing that all PKing is was GMaul speccing and how overpowered it is. Even PKers understanding "yeah, spec on weapon 1 into instant spec on gmaul is kinda overpowered at these combat brackets."
---
Altar
---
I'd be fine with this is in non-PVP worlds the following changes were applied:
---
* Resource Area is removed (from both PVP and Non-PVP worlds, as it becomes too useless on PVP worlds due to not having enough worlds to dilute PKers and too useful on a world with no PKers).
---
* Fountain of Rune rate for Amulets of Eternal Glory is lowered from 1/25,000 to 1/250,000.
---
* Wilderness Bosses unique rarity is increased from 1/512 to 1/2000.
---
* Dragon Pickaxe Rarity is increase from 1/171 to 1/1710.
---
* Wilderness Boss drops amounts are halved.
---
* KBD &amp; Corp is unchanged.
---
* Larran's Keys loot is halved.
---
* Dagon Hai is thrice as rare.
---
* Mage Arena 2 bosses are more difficult.
---
* Wilderness Agility Course gives Half XP.
---
* Rune Ore respawns at normal speed instead of increased rate.
---
* Some Rune Ore is Removed.
---
* Original Roaming PKer Revenants introduced (like back in the day), Revenant cave does not spawn old Revenants.
---
* Revenant drop tables reworked.
---
* Rogues Castle Chest loot quartered.
---
* Krystalia's Slayer Points for tasks lowered to a more normal amount.
---
* Less Black Chinchompa spawn spots.
---
* Ents do not drop double noted logs and instead just drop noted logs like Ents outside of the Wilderness.
---
* Dark Bait is dropped at quarter amounts.
---
* Additional Zammy Wine spawn in Fire Giant Cave removed.
---
Or we can not poll content to the portion of the community that wants it and exclude anyone who doesn't without forcing them to do content.
---
If this was the case prior we'd have multiple new half baked skills
---
It‚Äôs their turn
---
It‚Äôs not necessarily fear of this happening me. Just annoyance to see it happen to others.
---
Interesting. Nearly 2/3 of people with 99 runecrafting are also maxed.
---
How do you exist in the real world or other parts of the internet if this offended you...?

You only have to worry if you use the same email on everything you sign up for, use the same password and don't use any security features available to you.

You are 100% incentivised to fight back when escaping from a pker. If you really are smart you will be dealing damage to them while trying to hit all your over head prayers to reduce the dps he is doing on to you.
---
Pvp can be really engaging if you are escaping. Learn to flower box, or bring a lock pick or something and pretend like you're on dead man mode with a escape route always ready. It's one of the funnest things I enjoy doing in old school RuneScape. Some days it's not but a good escape feels what I imagine a good PK feels like.

Can you link me that?

to be fair, as a 99% pvmer, i voted no because i was under the impression they were going to remain just as accessible as before. if i had known there would be no way other than playing actual BH to get them i would have voted yes. this is on jagex, the poll was not very descriptive and as someone who hasnt followed the BH rework it seemed like a pointless thing to poll. they should just bring back being able to buy them. alternatively, dont make them lost on death in pvp? would probably shift the meta a tiny bit but it would be a boost to the standard spellbook

So you make a ‚Äú joke‚Äù about voting no to pvp content. Then I make a joke about you being an RS3 guy and you lose your mind. Snowflake, you seemed the type.

We tried limiting who could vote based off of requirements in the United States years ago, it didnt work out well. I know you're across the pond, but I wouldn't try it.
---
No, I'm not asking all these questions expecting answers, I'm asking all these questions to show you how complicated the smithing rework question really is. RS3's M&amp;S rework might have been a popular update but it failed to accomplish anything different - the new armors introduced have reached alch value, stone spirits are seen as trash fodder for drops, Invention components have become harder to obtain, and the prices of older armors like Bandos and Barrows have become exceedingly unstable while bots smith masterwork armor. A lot of the changes to smithing have created more problems than they fixed in RS3.
---
The questions I am asking were all addressed by RS3's developers and even then, problems still continue to arise in RS3 where they have to keep throwing out ideas on how to fix some changes to Smithing.
---
My point in all this is lowering the Smithing level for rune won't help this game - smithing will still end up a mostly useless skill. You're risking widespread economic collapse just because you think it's wrong that rune requires 99 smithing for 40 defense.
---
Don't make fun of cute noobs.
---
You come into the wilderness for clues like what once in a blue moon? how long are you actually there at a time? like less than 5 minutes? Risking a spade? And you expect to have equal say to people who play the game solely to pvp? That's valid reasoning to me.  
---
I understand voting no to vesta's longsword, but to tradeable looting bags? so pkers can have the convenience of stacking them in bank? to 50xp (500 max per account) negative xp lamps? so 2 def pures can fix their one time accident where they accidentally click defensive instead of spec bar when going for the gmaul? Tell me again how that's gonna make killing PvMers a shit ton easier? Answer: Its not, they're QoLs for pvpers but failed anyways. But fuck me right? its not spite voting  
---
How about if people who go to barb assault once in a blue moon for their torsos get equal vote to the BA regulars to make sure their torso grind don't suck ass (from their perspective). Yeah you'll up in arms as well won't you?

---
Agreed that the cap isn't too high. If it gets lowered, there are going to be cries for retroactively pushing forward everything that narrowly passed - as an interesting aside, colonello has a pretty good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn-67wEurzY&amp;t=285s) of a lot of things that narrowly didn't pass polls. Can you imagine if sailing and warding were actually passed into the game? ughhhh.
---
In my opinion, the OSRS playerbase is rather conservative about conserving the game's culture and identity, hence both the high standard to pass and frequency that the veto power is used. Jagex sometimes hits it on the head with what people want, and sometimes they miss the mark completely. If 75% of the community doesn't think it's a good idea for the game, it's probably not a good idea for the game.

Hey man, I appreciate the discussion but I have to respectfully disagree on some points. I know you've already spent some time talking about this and it gets tiring at a point, but if you happen to have some time I'd be really interested to hear your take on these points:
---
1. Using the argument that it'll be farmed imo is not enough to justify. Using that logic no new money makers should be added to the game as they will be farmed by bots. If anything pvp at least gives people a chance to take down bots (e.g. chins).
---
2. The issue with dhide is not that people that want to escape can always escape. I have no problem that people that want to escape can get a dhin's and a full inv of brews and be able to tank an ancestral team 80% of the time. The issue is it's vastly overpowered compared to its price point, just look at the stats and compare it to rune. It has great mage defence, decent range/melee defence, gives range attack bonus AND it is 1/5th of the cost. There's no downsides to it. Look at it from a balance perspective, not a "it's always been this way" perspective. (personally I'd sooner complain about my pvp opponent benefiting from high stats from cheap ass gear than not having "easy" targets).

3. I also agree to a point, there's already a lot of content in the wilderness. As an aside and speaking as someone that partakes in those activities, it would feel really dull to farm skilling/pvm content in the wilderness without running into anyone. I'd be thinking, is this game dead? and where's the risk I was promised?
---
4. .
---
5. I don't think the devs made the updates to "lure \[pvmers\] into the wilderness". It's always been advertised as a risk vs reward area, and it's a little naive to just look at gp/hr without factoring in that risk. A lot of people that go to the wilderness to pvm also pvp. IMO it's already too easy to escape fights if I need to. While I pvm, worst case if I get attacked all I need is a 10 second freeze, step under and log out. Heck when I started playing old school again 2 years ago and had no pvp experience, I'd just go to the wildy for the thrill of it. Soon enough I realised that hovering my mouse over the logout button gets you out of tough situations 99% of the time, and I quickly got bored of it (unless I don't safespot in which case I accept the risk and get my 3 items accordingly, that alone gives you a huge advantage over skulled people).
---
I guess it also depends on the person. A lot of people I run into don't know how to switch prayers or eat or box npcs properly. I guess to those people the wilderness feels very dangerous as it is. That's not the case at all closer to the skill ceiling. Two skilled pvpers would have a very hard time taking each other down if neither was willing to risk hp, and thats even with rag gear. I think when we are looking at competitive elements of a game, the goal should be to foster a challenging environment, not necessarily one that everyone can enjoy.
---
No company bans you then unbans you and gives you membership days back.  Blizzard only does it on very rare occurrence.
---
Interesting! I wonder what the hlc has to say
---
The wilderness is not going to be fixed by rigging votes to give shitty players stronger weapons so they have an easier time killing PvMers.
---
It's shortsighted, it creates even more ill will towards an unlikable bunch (what remains of the PKing community) and it makes an unbalanced RNG shitfest even worse.
---
This game's playerbase has largely moved on from PKing. I know I did - I used to PK all the time in Runescape from classic with the 3 turn combat to Runescape 2. I don't anymore because there are better games to compete against other people.
---
If Jagex wants to shoot itself in the foot and cause many cancelled subscriptions over time as people get fed up when pet hunting in the wilderness or trying to get a revenant item... this is a way to do it.
---
Lol

Funny thing is the people most affected by these pvp updates are the pvm players they are killing. Yet they get no say. Also if you only poll pkers how would anything ever not pass. May has well just put it straight into the game instead of polling. 
---
Also they pointed out last PK vote the last question voted on pointed to people voting no because they dont pk. Yet in jagex mind that somehow means the vote was unfair. Shouldn't that point to instead most ppl dont pk or want it in the game? Instead in typical jagex fashion they are ignoring that and trying to force pk updates no one wants except for a small minority instead of working on other things.
---
It just might work!
---

They say that the cases will get reviewed it just won't happen as quickly (obviously).

thanks!
---
Why do you even need WASD?
---
Right and when did pkers get their previous "meaningful" content? Let them have a month, itll be 2021 until the next big pvp update anyways
---
 Very poor money compared to basically any other activity requiring that much attention.
---
Ah, well its probably not much faster at all considering the lance 2 shots frequently. The key to efficiently farming them isn't how many you can kill per hour, its how many you can kill per hour while looting. Its pretty sweaty since you have to kite them over to the loot piles when they die in 2 hits.
---
So have prices on bonds dropped as a result?
---
Slayer is slow but it is super necessary. You can grind out some horrible skilling grinds for money, but it's not really worth it. Best thing to do is just grind out a ton of slayer, bring high alchs, get your battlestaffs from varrock diary, and get that range up
---
Lmaaaao just do it already
---
Just pked again. streamed both sessions
---
I've gotten 39 target kills since BHv2.
---
I got 71 crates from that. 
---
I made ~12.6m from those crates.
---
I made 8m from regular loots.
---
20m+ for 39 kills is not half bad. That was about 5 hours of pking.
---
The Office theme song intensifies
---
Dawg, your blood skull idea was shot down by like 50 different people. Give it a rest already.
---
I guess that could potentially be a remedy? Maybe make the content functional for pvp/bh worlds but not in regular wildy?
---
"only" most AAA video games are less than 20 hours and the majority of people don't even complete them. 250 hours is probably more time than the average person spends driving in a year. 
---
I maxed just after a year of release and quit about 3 years ago. It's bizarre that enough though I have thousands of hours in the game, I hardly remember any of it. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. But it shows you how little maxing really means when you move on in life.
---
This seems really negative to me, for some ambiguous reason.
---
Am I right for feeling this way, and if so, is there anything I/we as players can do to change this?
---
Like, is Jagex failing as a company or something?

I think the problem is that they RWT

2. the real one isn't any use either
---
3. if you're so worried about a false ban I'm guessing you're probably autoclicking or botting
---
Geez lol way to take shit out of context.
---
The word "extremes" don't have one single meaning, the same way the word "bat" can either mean an animal or a stick. "Extremes are a great way to point out ridiculous arguments" here OBVIOUSLY is in reference to the analogy that I made, one of serious nature, one that we all share, death, to point out that the statement in question (adding more instances) is ridiculous. It does not mean an "extreme consequence" which "appeal to extremes" is. If I were to say, "Runescape should be banned because it could cause cancer", then yes, THAT is a case of appeal to extremes. Because cancer in this case is an extremely, niche, specific instance that runescape could be the cause of, but just because of that fact it doesn't mean that runescape should be banned.
---
This is why it could be a possible case of false equivalency, I can actually see where you're coming from. You can actually argue that the analogy of "lag is bad enough, but adding a bit more lag is okay" does not share equivalency to "death is bad enough, adding a bit more death is okay".
---
Regardless, congratulations for resorting to derogatory labeling. If you can't attack the argument, attack the person making the argument right? Ad hominem at its best
---
Thought it was rs3 until i read the comments
---
Sorry dude, it's a niche marked in the osrs world. What you are voicing are minor criticisms that are obviously not shared.
---
You can have your opinion, but you're in the minority.
---
Not defending it obviously, but I think it's more about the scummy ways he tricks people into getting killed by him. Honestly I wouldn't mind learning PKing and fighting people, but the logging techniques, clans jumping you etc. is really tiresome. I loved the beta bounty hunter world where you could insta gear up and stat up and just 1v1 people, but the real wilderness is just a bunch of crap.

Funny thing about context is that the majority of folks probably read that with the "be" in the sentence already. Its basically a predictive reading of sorts, the words not actually there but you know the context ahead of time so automatically in your brain it registers it.

---
Oh teak teak mofucker oh teak teak gdamn.
---
It's called altar.
---
Yeah..thats definitely some raw "*meat*" right there yep.
---
Wildy altar?
---
To expand on my answer, you need to consider you have 3 primary options
---
1: Gilded altar. Expensive, fast, no risk.
---
2: Ecto: Slightly cheaper, slower, no risk.
---
3: Wildy altar. Potentially cheapest and fastest, but you risk death.
---
You've chosen your method for its very slight advantage per bone over gilded altar but in the time you've spent there you could have made back the difference in funds by training the fast way.
---
I don't think the "noobs are crying instead of putting in the effort to get better." I'm sure a solid amount of people who complain are competent players. It's just that it's an inconvenience at best. I walked out of the mage arena bank intending to finish the steps to imbuing a god cape and a level 126 dude just starts attacking me. He didn't even wait for webs to appear, I just prayer swapped and ate, then ran back to the lever. Then later on, as I was bringing back the ent remains to finish the cape, another maxed player who was skulled logged in right in front of the spider web from edge lever, probably intending to skulltrick players who don't have left click attack off.
---
These aren't noobs to pking, just like I'm not a noob to pking and know how to work around it.
---
Do you want to know what the real issue is? Nowhere in OSRS is there a PVP tutorial that teaches you about taking advantage of the tick system to get weapon/armor swaps to catch your opponent off guard. They don't tell you about predicting swap ins with a veng, they don't tell you about combo specs, and so on. Everything about real PVP (on PVP worlds and not this wilderness stuff) is stuff you'd have to learn through a guide online. And that's nowhere near as good as hands on experience. Which sucks, because genuine PVP is super thrilling and always fills me with adrenaline
---
I'm not completely against having stuff like altar in Wilderness. I'm fine with a high risk high reward gimmick. I'm annoyed with how both communities act like they are victims. I've said it before and I'll say it again and again: the wilderness is supposed to be a lawless place. Anything goes in the wilderness. If you walk into multi and get caught out by a clan that has people hopping through various worlds, too bad. That's what happens in the wilderness. Conversely, if you find a dude at black chins who looks like easy pickings only for him to equip black dhide and bulwark and run all the way back to the wilderness ditch, that's too bad for you.
---
People need to stop trying to add "rules" to the wilderness. If the PKer argument is "you know what you're signing up for when you enter the wilderness," the PVMer argument should just as easily be "you know what you're signing up for when you attempt to PK in the wilderness."
---
Stop trying to heavily control the direction which the game goes in. Neither side is "owed" anything, I'd be completely fine with Jagex just completely ignoring the wilderness at this point.
---
If the community wants it
---
Clearly a few other people agree with me, hence the upvotes.

Like I said, I like their content and I'm glad they're on a good path to even better content this year.

Good god I love it

Those weapons/armors that would only be active while unskulled would just make unskull pking even more of an issue among pkers and wouldn't help pvmers much as these wouldn't be good for pvm if they are pvp only bonuses.

No issues with RL. They work with Jagex to stay in compliance.

What are you referring to?

Well yes, but actually no

You should be aware then that your "innocent question" is the kind of thing that would likely get you sat down with HR at most modern companies. I figured you would reply as such and downvote, but these are the kinds of questions that often lead to situations where were people are discriminated against in the workplace for medical conditions.

We have a duty to treat people better than asking simple, googleable, questions about their medical condition. Otherwise we end up in a world where it is totally okay for large pizza chains to try and remove those people from the internet.

Hulu Netflix DAZN Xbox PSN Stream and etc etc. They're all around the same price range of $11/month and they have quick and easy support. Now I know they're HUGE companies but the least Jagex could AND should do is have support for the people that are giving them jobs.

Oh dear, you are dead!

I got banned for botting when I only have one account that is legit and has never been hacked. It evidently got banned on Sept 7 2018 but I played for November-march without being banned and eventually tried to get back into it like last week just to find it banned. Jagex bans legit players and allows bots to persist and it's fucking stupid.
---
How do you move from left to right with the mouse?
---
This is the ideal male body.
---
No.  Since there are unavoidable wilderness steps that either makes me drop the clue or go into the wildy I am choosing to engage in wilderness content ...therefore I reserve the right to vote
---
I've done the elite diary but never gone back after completing it. I'll have a try when I get home soon in like an hour and a bit.
---
I love these kind of segments, glad I got something to look forward to every week
---
Pretty sure there have been wildy clues since clue scrolls ever existed, and it was to make use of the wilderness as an area - not necessarily to attract pkers. I don't see most people pking at the exact dig spots for clues, they just happen to see people tele into the tele spots and kill them and they happen to be clue hunters. Also if the pkers had other pkers to fight then the clue hunters would be able to walk right passed them without worry as they would already be in a fight.
---
As far as other skilling/pvm content in the wilderness, it passed by over 80% in the polls which means people wanted the content - if they wanted the content but not in the wilderness they should have/would have voted no. I know people now feel forced to be in the wilderness but they had the chance to vote as long as they were playing the game during the time when it was polled. 
---
Also the general feeling is now that people are punished for wanting to pvm in the wilderness but the fact is that wildy bosses are very profitable which is why they are in the wilderness. Even when pkers are trying to boss in the wildy it's annoying to be attacked by pkers. They would be much less profitable if they were polled outside of the wilderness and the rings would be worth far less since more would come into the game.
---
I agree that d pick should be available outside of wildy but it would severely decrease its price. I would like it available to level 3 skillers/ironman skillers just like the d axe is. But there's no good content for it to come from currently.
---
Overall I think polls have served their purpose well and most of the pvp updates would be bad for the game which is why they failed (although 20 second freeze on normals would have been good for pvp (at least they finally took out half freezes with integrity update)). A few of the runes/spells would have been good for pking and pking alone which is why they failed - which is the reason they want to split the polls.
---
 I think for pvp polls there should just be a spot where every time at the start of the poll it asks whether you like pvp - if the answer is no, then disregard their answers just like those who vote to skip them. Pkers know better than even the devs of what is good for pking as they know the effects of overpowered and underpowered items and spells but their votes are worth the same as people who can't even find protect item.

This subreddit is hilarious. A dude maxes and you all suck his dick.

And another guy posts that he played 7 hours a day for a year and he gets shit on. You know it's very possible this maxed player came close to that average hours a day too for extended periods of time lmao.
---
People will praise 1b total xp then once they hear how much time it took they instantly attack the player. Do these people not understand how the game works lol
---
Good point. One way or another, there needs to be a clear and logical progression between safe, accessible minigames and full risk PKing, just as you say. I don't see any obvious pathways to learning how to PK all over again in the current game, and new players no doubt have it even worse - your proposal would fix that to a great extent.
---
One problem, though, is that as long as everything PvP-related is zero-sum or worse, the only incentive that matters is simply being interested in the idea of fighting other players. If we want to get a healthy PvP community back, we can either milk that sole incentive for all it's worth or find a way to make PvP more profitable in general without alienating our skillers and PvMers.
---
I'm a PvMer/skiller at heart, but I cut my PvPing teeth on FoG - and that's because it was a safe, positive-sum minigame that required lots of PvM-esque grinding to really reap the rewards. That kind of thing would be especially good for getting people who wouldn't otherwise be interested in PvP to start gaining an interest and getting involved.

I think you shouldn‚Äôt really worry to much about your gp but instead focus on getting your stats up for bossing. Then the money will slowly come in time. That‚Äôs my opinion. Quests and some non-tradeable gear you can obtain can be something to set a goal for. They will help a lot. The only monsters I can think of are stuff like wyverns and gargoyles though atm for super easy no thinking required money though.

Probably something to do with certain terrain patterns making them prioritise moving into a spot, like they constantly hit X obstacle and path west as the default.

Could also be that there are more hot spots in areas we see less of due to low player traffic. I know the Isafder forest has a fair few spots for high tier implings.

These are complaints that a noob would make. If you can't be bothered to watch some videos and try to understand what's going on then there's not much that can be done to help you - much less if you're seriously going to whine about not having your hand held the entire time. But, since you're making these weird complaints, let's try this: can you find an in-game tutorial about raids mechanics? Vorkath? Zulrah? Gorillas? Bandos, Armadyl, or Saradomin Godwars? Kalphite Queen? Chaos Elemental?
---
I hope you see the point I'm trying to make here, but if not, I will spell it out: the fact that you complain about not having your hand held leads me to believe that you're one of the people I was referring to in my post..less than 1500 total and used to having everything spoon-fed to you with zero risk.
---
&gt;People need to stop trying to add "rules" to the wilderness. If the PKer argument is "you know what you're signing up for when you enter the wilderness," the PVMer argument should just as easily be "you know what you're signing up for when you attempt to PK in the wilderness."

Cool, except approximately zero pkers are whining about a dangerous area. It's the carebears who are doing the whining.

---
Yes, but that experience is about what is being polled...
---
QPC and Max stats does not imply knowledge within PvM or PvP
---
This is an easy thing to say coming from the perspective of a PKer, but trust me this doesn't work in reality. Also, I can't even remember the last time I (or anyone for that matter) played Castle Wars, but I definitely wasn't experiencing any real mechanics in there.
---
&gt; everybody's done it multiple times 
---
That doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement.

This expansion to Duel Arena or mini-game in itself would be just that--a learning experience. And as you suggest, it would be fun the entire time.

Few days ago I watched a staking stream for the first time. The girl lost around 3b in less than 10min, all with pretty ridiculous losses. Then a guy gave her 1.5b just to instantly lose all in one stake. Some other people kept giving her amounts like 200-300m and she lost all of it in just a few minutes. I think I watched for like 20-25min and only saw her win once in that time, for only 150m lol

&gt; When I don‚Äôt play for a month I suck but if I play for a couple hours I get better and better and then when I play for days straight I end up on their level.
---
I experience a similar thing with american handball. The difference is I spent time on a very good team playing and improving my game, and years in general playing with friends. But I didn't just "play for a couple of hours" or "days straight" and *become* as good as some of my coaches, who were World Champions. To even score off them took months of constant practice. Maybe *getting back into it* would be that way. But it doesn't start like that.
---
&gt; Everyone wants to be good with no effort. 
---
Completely false. This is *exactly that: putting in the effort*. People simply don't want to lose their banks over a learning experience that they are only *mildly* interested in anyway. I kept playing handball because the worst monetary risk I had was accidentally hitting a ball over the fence and losing $0.50. But when you get very good, you can spend money to enter tournmanets and win a good deal of cash (for playing a game, anyway). PKing is no different: with less risk, there's more incentive to learn. And once you learn, then you're confident in risking for that chance at reward.
---
Perfection.

If the word ‚Äòsit‚Äô hurts your feelings I think you might be playing the wrong game. This community (esp PKers) isn‚Äôt exactly known for its sensitivity and kind-heartedness lol

Which one has more slayer pets
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
Humidify
---
I made a midsommar meme on here with the gmaul
---
Sounds fine until a guy name IlllIIlllI attacks you and then runs away and you follow him but attack IllIIIlllI who logged in underneath him and get skulled, then being at a disadvantage and losing your +3
---
Nevermind. I just checked and it's not obvious. But im fairly sure you can't leave between attempts.
---
cannonballs
---
Yet PvP updates like new weapons (even if they are just used in PvP) affect everyone.
---
PvMers have many bosses in the wilderness, and some of the best training methods for skillers are in the wilderness.
---
I'd fuck him up too don't worry
---
Including banking time? that number seems suspect
---
bro what the fuck
---
[That's a billion gp name!](https://i.imgur.com/tDOeXAf.png)

Agreed. I watch Rice Cup and after he got Blade of Saeldor(sic?), one tool seed and Zalcano pet he had like... 5.7k shards? From memory anyway. AND that was with him going over drop rate for Blade and Tool Seed (he was never going after pets). So yeah, even if he grinds out another two tool seeds (which he isn't going to do) and the gauntlet pet (which I don't think he cares about at least for now), he would still be waaaaay off the shards needed. Rice Cup has already completed all of the elven gear minus one pet and that was his goal.
---
I suppose the only way we will see someone come even close to the shards needed for it is if one of the pet hunter completionists go massively over the drop rate for gauntlet and zalcano pets... AND then gets lucky at the chest. Yeah its crazy rare when you put it like that as well. 
---
Oh well, I still think it's okay because Jagex never
---
That is the coolest thing I've ever seen deadass.
---
invest in bowstrings
---
Oh man I like that. The shared PoH in particular.
---
üòÇ
---
You shouldn't play with people you don't trust, right?
---
This guy slays
---
Are you talking about the set of ass cheeks?
---
Thanks for the support m8 &lt;3
---
And this is why pvmers vote no, even when being spoon-fed knowledge as to how to improve it's not good enough
---
3 skeles does as well
---
Maybe it's because you are the flaw.
---
grats on finding yourself
---
Maybe it's just the recording, but it looks like you switch to piety before actually shooting the arrow just about every single range hit lol
---
Fally has a course?
---
Kings ransom?
---
&gt; 'Well it doesn't affect me but it seems like a cool change for pvpers'.
---
vs.
---
&gt; 'Well it doesn't affect me but it seems like a cool change for ~~pvpers~~ DMM players'.
---
You see the difference? Exactly, there is none. They don't play the content and vote no because it doesn't benefit them.
---
Exactly why I avoid Wildy, Fuck losing my hard earned gear to be apart of some idiots 10 second montage where he gets what took me hours to get in seconds off of my cold dead corpse.  I'm sorry, I don't like the idea of losing my gear much so I'm not going to subject myself to that BS, if they'd let me keep my gear on a PvP Death, just equipped stuff, then I'd be happy.
---
If you hage rigour you dont need to use rune darts
---
Maybe set up a rule where the one that's behind gets 10 minutes of extra time for every round that  he's behind. 
---
So if Rargh leads 4-2, Link gets 20 mins extra prep time.
---
Every vork kill is worth over 100k you arent using that much in supplies
---
It depends on varying factors. Are you using divines, addy darts, rune? If not divines when do you repot? Best to check the DPS calc.
---
So turning my 20second return time into like 2 minutes, ye rather go without the looting bag. If someone was pvming for a bag on my trip i would kick them from the clan.
---
Also, it‚Äôs 2147 for max reference not 2174 :p
---
Nope. Nothing.
---
Nosepeg also works, but slayer helm is better so it looks like you're on task and you don't get crashed
---
I've gotta get some sleep, I even double checked before posting haha
---
How old are you? Do you work atm? How does one have so much spare time? :o
---
the complete silence is deafening
---
If comparing verac safespot and verac no safespot you just bring karambwans + venge and walk under after each hit.
---
do you want to give me a bond
---
it's fuck all anyway
---
You're about 50x too low on that value. Too many choices=back to the safety-scape.
---
We need a pvp bus
---
Why should a main do barrows tho
---
I do Youtube
---
Normie DVS, you offend the normies by calling them normies
---
Please explain how blessed d'hide chaps being 1 def is trash?
---
I bought the beeds on zybez. There were quest sets and stuff on the zybez trade list too.
---
Was really cool to pay a dude like 100k and get all items for a quest series. (I would still prefer that over buying 20 different items at the ge.) (For example there was Desert treasure and you got all the items for DT and all the pre quests for a fee of 100k).
---
wilderness has never been high risk.
---
you just go in the cheapest possible setup to each piece of content (dhides + weapon usually).
---
meanwhile Jagex keep putting content that's extremely sought after and has no place being ONLY in a pvp zone, in a pvp zone.
---
Dragon Pickaxe for example. 
---
You never make money killing a pvmer, only by killing other pkers.
---
The fact is, PvP at the core isn't fun for 90% of the playerbase. So Jagex trying to force people to engage in content they clearly don't want to and then blaming polls is just fucking retarded.
---
How much more per raid
---
I legit prefer three ticking fishing to afking it. When I can play I would rather be interacting with the client than not, I guess.
---
Proud of you &lt;3
---
I'm so glad I went through with posting this, these comments are tickling me so thoroughly
---
No idea why they‚Äôre so expensive
---
People don't want to engage with content
---
They vote no
---
The polls are there for players to vote on how they want to play the game. Just because they disagree with you doesn't invalidate their opinion
---
Meenage Tutant Neetle Nurtles
---
You either hate yourself or you're a bot.
---
Definitely quest the first 30-40 levels, it's massively faster than actually training them.
---
Me after opening that casket:
---
(‚ï•_‚ï•)
---
You also have to add 12 for killing 6 brothers. A lot of people forget about that one.
---
You 100% would have bolt racks by now doing that it's like a 1 in 50 per roll and you've done over 600 rolls
---
Well, it is an MMO. Not supposed to be solo player catered all the time, if at all. Great photoshop skills tho.
---
Omfg first time I've cried laughing on reddit lmao
---
Fun
---
But yeah you don't need to ever do barrows
---
You complained that he hadn't done barrows before now, and now you're complaining he is doing barrows now?
---
Kill creatures in the wilderness.
---
If u have amazon/twitch prime you can claim 2 weeks free right now
---
To clarify- Maple
---
You shouldn't get bolt racks if you're doing it right
---
Hilt drop rate * pet drop rate = 50/50
---
People so, myself included.
---
Well I do have a record of bad rng
---
Agreed
---
I trained it on roof tops last night hah... At 31 now, doing the varrock rooftop course. Planning to unlock morytania to get thr canifis course at 40. Will check oit those quests tho!
---
What backbling is that called?
---
Aim for 30k
---
Gold selling is super prominent because accounts can be so easily made and thrown away. 
---
The kind of accounts that stick around long term, long enough to want to think about using complex systems of mules, are very, very few.
---
Treasure hunter my old friend how have you been. Just looking at that makes me want to buy keys.
---
&gt;Thoatrix puts out some damn high quality guides.
---
Only if you have no idea about the content he does guides on. The more you play and learn about the game you realise he‚Äôs just reading the wiki and it‚Äôs generally really outdated information if it‚Äôs not off the wiki
---
I mean it‚Äôs the equivalent of pvmers voting in some boss that‚Äôs afk and 10m an hour, if you did you can‚Äôt be trusted with ur vote
---
Likewise voting no to all dangerous pvp stuff cuz you want an easier time in the dangerous PvP area means you can‚Äôt be trusted with ur vote
---
Hey bro come into L0st Dynasty cc! We do every bit of content you can think of and very friendly with learners. You name it bro we will have someone to go with you to it. Come in and look for TTTankey and if I ain‚Äôt in tell em I sent ya
---
I reckon it should be if there's conclusive evidence, eg chat logs and video footage (as with this guy). But knowing Jagex what r they gonna do lol
---
Underground pass
---
What, looting bags are in the slayer shop now? Are you sure you don't mean rune pouches?
---
Also some stuff on the right, near the pink bit
---
If you wanted it so bad maybe you should have claimed it.
---
Maybe openly giving access to your accounts to others is why you got hacked
---
Fair point, didn't think of bots.
---
What a genuine douchebag
---
Buying deedeepeeplusplus 30k
---
Nah
---
The point is, out of all the mmos that I've played, Jagex is the only company to not restore lost game time from a false ban from the many stories I have seen over the years.
---
I just bought it and i was skeptic too. Boy am i glad i bought it. Everything that i could do from bossing became easy, everything i couldnt do 100% i could do now.
---
‚ÄúEquip raw beef‚Äù.
---
Are you rock caking down to 1hp?
---
Almost every enemy in game can only hit a maximum of what your hp is, so if your hp is 1, then they'll only hit 1s.
---
The combination of overload potions, absorptions, and rock caking to 1hp usually gives me at least 3 hours if I'm paying even a slight bit of attention.
---
Except we‚Äôd still be waiting on the gwd update
---
You reap what you sow, a matter of time before there is a post about a wrongful ban. You did what you did and now you can‚Äôt take it back.
---
I swear clues always target quest I haven't done. Like more than half of my quest are because of clues
---
Not really getting hacked when someone is given the info for the account, now is it? Hence the quotation marks. Regardless, it‚Äôs a video game and not a huge deal, some people sweat pixels too hard. lol
---
except no, they do what they are ordered to, they can tell them "yo ppl are mad we shouldnt do this etc etc" but if the shareholders insist they have no choice but to go through with it.
---
he cummed in his pants
---
Oh man I wish archeage had turned out differently. It had so much potential. Fucking game companies and their greed.
---
Upvotes for recognition. Damn this guys, I hope he gets his karma
---
I tried to kill Callisto once, it took an unholy amount of time to get it anywhere near dead, and then a pker logged in and I ran south..
---
0/10 would not recommend.
---
They only have 1 attack range so you can go in for 1 hit and then back out of melee range, similar to how you do thermy.
---
Haven't played rs3, but isnt there a place where you click once and get runecrafting exp for free?
---
Charge
---
I've had 2 claws in a similar KC but goddamn I would like a pet from a boss sometime soon. 4100 vorkath kc and 1700 hydra kc and still no pet from either :(
---
From a pvm perspective, Back in the day no one would have taken the risk of doing things like zulrah or other bosses. It would be left to the very few skilled players. The game has changed. Dying was so devastating back in the day that I remember quitting for nearly a year because I accidentally died and lost my whole cash stack one time.
---
I died 3 times yesterday with over 70m in items I would have lost each time. I dont have the time to remake 70m with each fuck up doing end game content.
---
If I'm going to the wild, I bring minimal gear to complete what I'm doing to avoid risk. People dont get mad over dying while 3 iteming due to the risk, they get mad because they feel like you're an asshole for attacking someone who isnt risking anything while they try to complete risky content that they were forced to do.
---
 It's a complete inconvenience when I'm standing there fighting a zammy mage and a pker comes up and waits for me to kill it just to dds spec me out. It's not about being spoiled, its about being extremely inconvenienced by a shitty pker.
---
On the flip side, I'm a shitty pker and when I pk, I kill anyone I can find lol.
---
Never liked lootshare on rs2 because instead of dropping an item it just gives everyone coins instead, surely that'd make gold inflate even more
---
I know you're just a troll but there are people out there who are seriously like this.
---
You do realise you can achieve things on video games and STILL do things IRL too? Also, what the fuck has it got to do with you how somebody spends their time.
---
rev clans split 1m+ kills too, under 1m not worth splitting. (back when i was rev pking ob my L60 with f2p xlpc clan)
---
RS3 is the real joke
---
It's also complete garbage:D
---
Detroit Velvet Smooth!
---
He's got a low level hard-core on osrs and gives me advice on mine:D:D:D
---
His name is Ethan Johnson a.k.a. azazel4zero or angeldouche7
---
Link and rargh are definitely my favourites other than J1mmy and settled
---
Go outside
---
Nice combat bracelets
---
If it sent the item to GE and sold it for lowest price, then no gold would come into the game.
---
What he did was wrong, but doxxing isn't the answer.
---
It's Japanese
---
It's MA'AM!
---
What about just calling them demonic gorillas instead and let them drop zenyte?
---
Bringing in loads of legitimate new players I see!
---
This was a cc raid, MY cc mind you, and although i wasn't in the raid with him today, i was yesterday when we got 2 purples, which 1 of them he got and he split it cuz he knew thats our ccs rules unless he states hes doing a ffa. plz dont try to justify as if this was some ffa random. yoinking when ur playing with randoms is 1 thing, yoinking when ur playing with "friends" is a whole different level of scum.
---
but i guess ur right, u cant get banned for it.
---
Actual slayer
---
&gt;where I can get a Dragon pickaxe outside of the Wilderness.
---
GE
---
Scumbags need to be name and shamed. But you're right, deleted it. Although it's pretty easy to find it.
---
sounds like they're both bored and quiting tho
---
That shit's expensive though
---
First of all your whole argumentation is totally weird and what you are saying is also wrong.
---
First of all you can't compare a twisted bow drop to a god damn arcane prayer scroll!! To make that big split in an argument to purposely have a right opinion is just totally messed up and shows, that you have no idea what you are even talking about, because you have to LOOK at THIS CASE!
---
The drop in cox is NOT yours, when you explicitly make a deal with your group to split the drop! - see his behaviour-- ......
---
It is also wrong , that you need 10-20 minutes to sell an item at the ge. Just put it in for 5% less and you find a buyer INSTANTLY! 
---
I have to ask you, if you even play the game???
---
Your argument with the person dying irl is more than retarded, this doesnt even need an explanation why it is not right in the first place. - look at the case shown above-...
---
I dont care if you "tip" people to waste their time for your drops in cox. Who wants to play with someone who never splits his items, but in fact "tips" them?!! 
---
if  you want to have items to play the game, then do SOLO COX runs and dont waste the time of other people. If your skill isnt good enough to do consistend sub 30 min solo raids, thats your problem alone! Cox is not that hard in 2019. If you are transferring your problem to other people by only giving them "tips" , and keep the items for yourself, then you are just an egoistic person.
---
Lots of new players! I like that!
---
Also, if I were to make a new account, I didn't know you could get starter sword and shield, huh! Something new everyday!
---

---
Ypu can switcht your food to brews restores. That way you have like 50% more food. Otherwise i would start training ranged :-)
---
I kill spectres in the Slayer tower and use expeditious bracelets, kourend ones take too long.
---
tfw when he scams his only viewer
---
Again it's not really about that, but ok. I won't indulge you any further lol
---
8 hours a day plus any amount is unhealthy, regardless if it's work or play.
---
I bought at 110 to motivate me to bash out reqs for ds2, it‚Äôs like 90% of my bank :(
---
"Sometimes you gotta think out of the box. Other people are already getting 200-300k in the chest if they did good in the raid, so anything else is just extra." What the heck? Hopefully nobody loses their split because of you
---
Why is it crashing so hard? Did I miss something?
---
Just because you said I'm wrong doesnt make me wrong.
---
Wow, not true. I never said that i steal drops. I always come to an agreement BEFORE the raid. The amount of name-calling shows me how immature this community is.
---
It‚Äôs just pure gear plus mystic and addy gloves.  Halo may still be BIS but idk off the top of my head.  Unless you‚Äôre planning to swap out studded body too. Unfortunately 20 def accounts haven‚Äôt been strong for many years. 
---
If you go deep, zerks and meds dominate.
---
Jagex should ban this kid and set an example
---
With how quickly he was to leave clan, turn private off and hop worlds, thats enough proof to me that it was meant to be split; you wouldn't do that if it wasn't
---
If you really want to have a win-win-situation for everyone as you say, you would always do a 3-man split. If you are morbidly stingy and try to see what is best for you in every situation and mediocre / bad for the other people you are raiding with, because you are poor in game its your issue. I am not hard on you or condescending in any means. I just see that you put your interest above the interest of the group, thats all there is to it. Thats egoistic by definition. Case closed.
---
\&gt;playerbase drops 80k
---
RS: oh that's just normal fluctation 
---
This is a desin idea
---
Smile you're on reddit you son of a bitch.
---
Since they don't fight back that's about as useful as fighting rock crabs in PK gear to practice swaps. There should be a better way to go about it.
---
I'm saying that the loot system for cox is very biased. Most people want a split, but im saying that's not the only way of making a fair drop. IF you raid with like 2 solid friends, you can let each other keep drops and just throw like 5-10m depending on what you get. It's more circumstantial and you need to come to an agreement with your own group.  I think you guys are blowing this way out of proportion.
---
Alright. I was asking for a friend
---
No zulrah, no gwd, no abyss. Those are the only bosses I‚Äôm really locked out of. The goal is to complete the inferno without ancients or chins :)
---
Absolute Chad of an account.
---
once you get better at swaps and PKing, you can try killing other weaker pkers who also practice PKing by killing skillers and PVMers
---
No, those statements are definitely in the prohibited section. You might want to check it again.
---
8 hours a day IS much. It's sick that you are justifying this.
---
Twitch/chey (idk if I can post links)
---
And my schedule is kind of wonky cuz my job doesnt have set hours. I try to go live when I can though
---
snakelings - get ring of suffering!!!  Expensive but worth it.
---
Smog you have to stand in the correct spots.
---
Pathetic.
---
You should be able to assign tasks. How long did this take?
---
This is why I wouldn‚Äôt recommend WDR to anyone. It‚Äôs a shitty slow learning experience that really doesn‚Äôt benefit besides getting you first couple kc
---
He will probably RWT it
---
So in conclusion nobody knows about twisted league
---
Hello, WDR mod here.  
---
For those of you who want to get this knobhead on your ignore lists, he's double name changed:  
---
From Azazel4zero to FrostTorn to InfernoSmape.
---
You just have to click the roof next to it, more specifically the roof jump. 
---
At least that's what I did when it happens to me; happens quite often on mobile.
---
Yeah my first 20 crates I wasnt seeing 100k a crate then I got really lucky with the second batch of 35
---
Overrated imo. Like the progress vids are decent but I wouldn't say they're that great. It's not necessarily a bad thing. Progress vids can only offer so much.
---
Scott's tots !!!!
---
At some point you need to rank up your range mage and slayer.  It will bring money naturally
---
Yeah just checked on the website. NuttyRS mentioned it is not bannable and mentioned those statement. But yes they are in the prohibited section so nutty was talking crap i guess
---
wtf
---
Remove 3 9s and you are correct
---
Manked literally won twice.....???????
---
Low alch
---
This isn't a silly question..
---
As it goes, there almost certainly won't be a rebate. Kind of like when they do balancing changes - one group benefits pre or post change and the others just button down and accept it.
---
The Arceuus library with the runelite plugin?
---
official definition of a scam, its not the whole thing but " Players must not scam or deceive other players.", agreeing to split if you get a drop and then not splitting is a deception. Just cuz people dont get banned for it doesnt mean its not a scam.
---
Dad beat me last time

Thanks for the advice. I didn't use any of the structural hiding spots unless they were already close by, instead 1t flicking the mejkots, turning on eagle eye for the xils, and positioning the enemies to have the wimpiest one hitting me.
---
I did end up face tanking a mejkot in wave 61, but he died in 5 hits and didn't do any damage. I turned steel skin on for that one.

Bro you only get 234.5 xp an hour max in f2p
---
There is an official rule against scamming.
---
I'm not sure what scamming is if this isn't scamming. Do you have any suggestions?
---
It's not a scam but it is super scummy. No one will ever group with him again now.
---
I could be wrong but I think it was still a popular 99 before wintertodt because it was so simple and just a moneysink
---
My longest dry streak without a rare was about 900. My longest dry streak without a tanz was about 1,600.
---
Hang in there bud.
---
I can't vouch for the whole community, but I did vote in favor of tradeable looting bags and the XP lamps, for what it's worth.  It's possible their thought process was something like, "If it's easier to get looting bags, more people will be inclined to PK, which means my Wilderness experience will be worse."  I don't think that, but someone might.
---
I thought they clarified self placed tile markers are fine.
---
I'm glad someone else is noticing that. That helium ass sounding bitch
---
I actually don't care or think he should be banned but there is a literal rule against scamming, code of conduct section 2. Additionally on their official page: https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules - under Scams
---
&gt; Players must not scam or deceive other players.
---
1b isnt $350?
---
Lol. No they arent.
---
I did a bunch of melee Vork with similar stats and would get 6 kill trips almost every time. The difference is absolutely bcp and serp helm. Vork's ranged attack is much more accurate than his melee so ranged defence is the top priority.
---
Depending on your max hit calc you could consider guardian boots as well. Only 3 str bonus instead of 4 from dragon boots, both otherwise superior in every way.
---
I'm starting my grind from 83 (currently 86) with elites done right now.
---
I can let you know in like 4-5 months lol
---
Where?
---
Big F on that
---
Runescape gives the drop to one player, thats "the core" of how drops work. What a player does with that drop is the choice of the player.
---
Does that even matter? Just add him to your ignore list and any name he changes to will still be on your ignore list.
---
Lemme test this r/woooosh
---
Yeah I sold at 115m as well lol
---
It‚Äôs worth even less if he‚Äôs selling to a website. Right now you can but a bill for just under 600 and if your selling this gold I would guess he would get 4? Maybe? I don‚Äôt really know I‚Äôve never sold but maybe someone who has can give us more info on what they pay.
---
Here's a similar experience, I used to suck at PvP in Dark Souls/ DS2 and get super salty when I got invaded and killed (sounds like dying in the wildy huh?) so I spent a bunch of time in the arenas where people go specifically to fight, over time that got me used to rolling/ baiting/ parrying times and made me confident to go around invading people myself/ defending against invaders and even camping pvp hotspots, I can't speak for everyone else, but your idea would definitely get me training and eventually risking stuff in the wildy/ pvp world/ bh!
---
Double wrath talisman is even worse. They don't even stack like the seeds do.
---
Yep
---
Scamming is against the rules, this is scamming. Slap a 2weeker for this guy at least so he can think about what he has done.
---
well he also could sell the current account and profit easily. poor guy to whoever buys that account tho
---
Steals Twisted bow to buy 200 bonds for 200 name changes. Everyone is shit talking him but he's clearly 500 iq.
---
OOL what is the abyssal sire update?
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll do that.
---
It could just be an option you can toggle on and off.
---
source?
---
Underrated comment!
---
Did you re-log after completing the diary? It shouldn't be necessary, but it is a really old game, so who knows.
---
&gt;Scams \~$350 to buy a \~$500 similar stats main acc i love it.
---
I love when people pretend they know what they are talking about.
---
I know different game different expectation but any game with a raid, if something drops to you its yours and you're not expected to do whatever with it. It's not much of a scam if you got it to drop and earned it.
---
"even if written in crayon"
---
Do you think these guys have a contract? Or do you think it's more of a friendly understanding?
---
I always loved the risk vs reward setting of skilling in the wilderness.
---
Do black chins instead of red, maybe you get pked but if you don't you profit more.
---
Do the wildy altar, get double the exp per bone, you are constantly on edge(Training prayer is intense and not booring).
---
If you get pked you lost the game of risk and reward. But probably you made enough extra before, and if you haven't use the methods outside of the wilderness.
---
Revs don't need a slayer lvl and do no damage back to you if you have the bracelet. Even if you kill revs for 10min out of an hour you make better money there than on compearable outside of the wildy options if you are a low lvl. 
---
I think ppl should just start with that mindset before doing wildy content.
---
The Venezuelans are the ones whining about "too many people", not OP. If they come and camp Australian servers, they have no right to whine when an Aussie wants to come play the game. 5 people hardly effects Zalcano gp/hr anyway.
---
Also, revs is a bad example because you can fit plenty of people at revs. If it's too "crowded," just start pk'ing. You can't pk at Zalcano.
---
&gt;So i can tell everyone who‚Äôs not american at revs to hop
---
And yes, you can. But they'll probably tell you to fuck off. And if you don't like that, kill them.
---
sees the twisted boy, (no expression). after when he scams the tbow "ooommmyyy god" orgasm lmao
---
What?
---
There are nodes where you click and it gives you experience for a random duration. The experience is faster than crafting runes but you gain nothing except for points which can be used to buy stuff like the basic Runecrafting outfit set, and crafting soul runes once you get to 90 RC becomes much better experience.
---
The safe spot doesn't work exactly like that. Basically the Fight Kiln has a wave with two Jads and there's a rock where you can get them stuck behind so you only have to deal with one of them at a time. You can't hit them from the safe spot but otherwise yes, there is a safe spot to stand and there are a variety of crystals, one of which makes you invincible.
---
People have been asking for a harder version of the Fight Kiln for a very long time since it's extremely dated content from 2012 and the most Jagex have done so far is buffed the NPC HP so it doesn't die instantly to EoC combat.
---
For the purpose of making ass loads of alts can I do the 'ol:
---
Bigolcuntexample+osrsalt1@gmail
---
 
---
bigolcuntexample+osrsalt2@gmail
---
And so forth for alts using the same email?
---
Pretty sure I did the quest before 60 attack all those years back.
---
Kappa
---
What do you mean pick one? They CAN vote but they need to meet the criteria of the content they‚Äôre voting for or against. Technically speaking both of those statements go hand in hand. Find it funny when someone shares an opinion everyone goes witch hunting. 
---
This looks like some epic shenanigans, I love it! Can't wait.
---
you went from i wont get hacked to i dont even care if i get hacked in fact i want to 
---
Might as well do dmm while u wait
---
Because pking is fun
---
1/1000 people have the motivation to max 5 accounts? Doubtful. DVS has the most maxed accounts of any osrs player I believe?
---
How is BP becoming less viable for vorki?
---
No you cannot. Sitting for that long is not great for your spine, posture, organs, etc. Everybody works differently, yes. Great statement. But that doesn't allow for people to sit 8 hours a day. It's unhealthy, no matter which way you spin it.

It used to be my dream to be a pmod lmaoooo

Sounds great :)

Whoops
---
All of the friends I trust aren't high enough leveled to do ToB. I have to find randoms and do ffa. It would be so much better to be able to split the drops, without trust being involved, and without a way that hurts the economy.
---
How is it silly ? The only thing PKers moaning about are pvmers voting no for no reason and I agree it‚Äôs not black and white I pk as well as pvm but it‚Äôs entirely true that while PKers might pvm also, the vast majority of pvmers don‚Äôt pk
---
Firemaking was the 6th rarest cape right before Wintertodt released with 3.3k players with 99.
---
Upvoted, you have my support. I was reading something on the gamedev reddit recently saying that developers need to use color AND shape to signify certain things, because there is a good portion of the population affected by color-blindness and you want the game to be accesible to them as well. I like the shape idea the best, they already have the sprites for it. Only issue is when you're standing right next to someone else and you cannot tell which is coming towards you, then you would still need the chatbox. Maybe they throw a shape in the chat box as well, so it is something like:   
---
 ‚óä olm throws a sphere of accuracy and dexterity  
---
 ‚ñ° olm throws a sphere of aggression  
---
 ‚óã om throws a sphere of magical power
---
The shapes could be anything, but different enough so you could easily tell which it is. Thoughts?
---
It's called /r/place, and it was a temporary event on reddit where you could place a pixel on this shared board every couple hrs or so.
---
they do it for free o7
---
They were added to several new monsters' drop tables and the farm yield increased by a generous amount.
---
Why not though? You don't trust your best friend with a key to your house? This just seems extremely paranoid, or you're just repeating the stronghold of security mantra without thinking about it yourself.
---
Join a raid clan? If on big clans somebody scams a drop they are banned for that clan. So most of them are legit. Or you will have to chose, do high end pvm with randoms or have fun with friends
---
This guy does not resonate well with the swolesome memes
---
Only way I can think of is that it's becoming more expensive to use at Vork vs. alternatives since scales are going up.
---
No I didn't wtf can you read? They are MY BEST FRIENDS OF 18 YEARS.  I never said I don't care if I get hacked, I never said I wanna get hacked and I never said I don't wanna get hacked. I said IF I DO GET HACKER I HAVE ANOTHER ACCOUNT I CAN PLAY ON.
---
Maybe he just doesn‚Äôt think of you as his bwana..
---
They get a lot of views already lol
---
I have a pb of 1:24 with 94 range blowpipe, addy darts, and no rigour/elite void. It's all RNG. Get enough KC and one kill is bound to be extremely lucky.
---
You've made like 6 post in the last month about this game. You even make info pages with your cute little ideas for the game. Sometime you even throw in some super cool OSRS graphs!
---
He like playing the game. So do you. He makes money playing the game. You don't. Making the assumption he does is to impress people on reddit is a clear reflection of yourself. Keep posting on reddit so you can jack people off for Karma. 
---
Leave out the negativity though you nerd.
---
You should honestly just drop combat and focus on RC, it's a fun and profitable skill to train
---
My main is early endgame and can definitely suffice itself with zalcano, gwd, beginner raids, etc. 
---
There‚Äôs times however doing tedious tasks on my main such as wc, or fletching that I get bored and wish I had an alt that I could play on. I dont want to do any serious grinding on the alt however because I want most of my attention geared to the main so afk tasks like chopping yews is the most preferred on the alt. Yews are crap gp though and really not worth my effort. 
---
Might just turn to netflix.
---
Fuck maybe my bwana card expired
---
From the tweet, as I understand it:
---
1. Kill an alt to get on a 3 kill-streak.
---
2. Both you and the alt grab three Tier-4 emblems.
---
3. Get each other as targets.
---
4. Splash on each other as you walk to the hotspot, so you can't be PJ'd.
---
5. Kill your alt with the account that has a killstreak
---
6. All 6 emblems are upgraded to Tier 5, a ~3.3m profit
---
Ya if the rules said ‚Äúnot choosing to split is bannable if you have evidence‚Äù I would agree. But it isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs purely a community thing at this point and no one disagrees that he should be shunned from all PvM groups. But people want him banned from OSRS lol
---
\&gt; We had exactly what your describing
---
I'm not describing anything, boomer.
---
\&gt; a minigame made entirely for PKing where everyone was on equal terms.
---
Checked 5 minutes ago - that minigame is still there  - if that minigame is the salvation of pvp, why not go play it instead of crying on reddit?  In the words of Toto: "Hurry boi it's waiting there for you!"
---
\&gt; so LMS was dead within 2 weeks
---
"This minigame is amazing!  But if you don't pay me to play it I won't!"
---
Christ, you people sound miserable.  I don't know the last time I did something in osrs for the money - but I do remember feeling fucking miserable trapped in moneyscape while I still thought something giving a reward was an excuse to do something I didn't wanna do.
---
And the final irony is that with the Trouver parchment, LMS gp/h is fine, even better if you do high stakes.  Probably more than wt if you're good (I can see how that's a problem for you though, soz).
---
\&gt; You know what happened? It got absolutely NO worthwhile rewards due to the polling system
---
If Jagex unironically suggests tradeable clue scrolls, it's not on us that it failed, its on jagex for suggesting stupid fucking rewards lmfao.  We're not obligated to pass stupid content ideas because they benefit you, buttercup.
---
\&gt; minigame gives a pet
---
Pkers on reddit: "ree LMS has mostly cosmetic rewards"
---
Also pkers on reddit: "ree WT gets a cosmetic pet"
---
Did you even want a pet?  Jagex didn't even poll a pet for LMS.  Though if they did, it would have likely passed lol, like the other cosmetics.
---
\&gt; insane xp/h
---
??? WT gives worse or equivalent xp/h to on-level logs.  XP rates at WT are fairly standard for firemaking.  Also it's fucking firemaking - until a few years ago the skill was literally a waste of code, and even now it's one of the easiest and most inconsequential skills.
---
\&gt; good gp/h
---
If you're not doing solos (solos means worse xp) it's like 100-200k an hour lol.  That's comparable to fucking cannonballs.  LMS is higher than this- and you're complaining that it has no rewards.  Nuff said.
---
That's the funny thing - whenever one of y'all brings up WT as a source of hatred, I know I'm about to hear some opinions from someone who knows absolutely nothing about the game and has an inflated view of WT based on twitter dramalets and youtube clickbait.  
---
\&gt; or even replacing the cancerous grind that is NMZ was just too much   
---
Imagine being so entitled that clicking a button every 2 minutes on your phone while getting BIS combat exp is just too damn much - and then still playing runescape, the game of fishing, woodcutting, and rc.    
---
\&gt;It was going to "devalue" the worst minigame in OSRS that everyone already hates.  
---
a) It's not even close to the worst minigame in OSRS ahaha.
---
b) People hate it for being stupidly easy and a trivial way to get BIS rings.  Hell, the only thing that would be more brainless than gating ring imbues behind "rock crabs, but even better" is just making them tradeable.  And when Jagex offered just that in LMS poll, you're shocked that it didn't pass?  (Hell, shit wasn't even close)  
---
Again, if NMZ is a challenge for you, that's on you.  We're under no obligation to somehow lower the bar even lower because you want to just butt-chug ring imbues.  You have your vote, and we have ours.  Don't like that, I hear North Korea is nice this time of year.  
---
\&gt; You've all proven time and time again that you'll screw over PKers even when it causes literally NO disadvantage to yourselves. When that's the case, it's evident you shouldn't be allowed to participate. No matter how much you whine about it.   
---
You've proven time and time again that you're willing to vote yes to the stupidest content/concepts imaginable if it means even a marginal perceived advantage for yourself.  When faced with the concept that 4/5 of the playerbase isn't going to allow tradeable fucking clue scrolls into the game, instead of asking jagex to submit more reasonable polled content you want your vote to count as 4 votes, because you're a fucking crybaby that cannot comprehend the fact that other people have different opinions, and wouldn't care if you could.  
---
You claim that "we" are voting solely to screw you over - yet how many shitty gamebreaking polls have you upvoted because they were pvp content you wanted to see?  Ever stopped to think about that?  Of course not, because you're a disingenuous piece of garbo.  Only thing that's "evident" is that you would do anything to have your way, and that you are the last person anyone should listen to, past the mandatory 1 vote you get as a paying member.  No matter how much you whine about it.  
---
Proposed content in this game goes to a poll - and if enough people don't like it, it doesn't matter how hard you love it, because your voice does not have any extra weight.  This applies for all polls - see warding. Not sure why that's complicated to understand, or accept.

Guys look at the top right! He left the swamp! He has to restart the account now
---
I wish bots weren‚Äôt anywhere. Honestly the big issue here is that Jagexs bot detection isn‚Äôt up to par and Zulrah is far far too good of a money maker. 
---
Bots already got through a string of quests to even get to Zulrah as is, so adding another one likely won‚Äôt stop them for long. Jagex either needs to implement a ‚ÄúBotwatch‚Äù type system for OSRS or they need to heavily nerf Zulrah so the bots move onto something else.
---
I don't believe so. I used BlueStacks on my PC and I was never banned on there.
---
Feels bad that you‚Äôre making assumptions because I‚Äôm from the states and you keep bringing up politics to pixels. Again it‚Äôs my opinion if you have an issue then make a reddit post about it, but going on a witch hunt because I‚Äôm stating what I believe in (which you can post what you want because you have your rights as well). It‚Äôs getting old my mind isn‚Äôt gonna change.
---
I agree. Zulrah has been out for years NOT locked behind the quest with the highest requirements ever. I don't mind them adding another req, but sote is too much.
---
Already confirmed it's not heavily farmed by bots, but actually manually by gold farmers A LOT
---
This would be on mobile tho
---
Bad comparison. Designing too many mechanics around something to restrict the players will just annoy the players, and then nobody would do the content. If there was a restriction like: "You can only use 15 bones every 5 minutes." That would be a nudge in the right direction to carrying some food and fighting back. But that's so restrictive that most people just wouldn't do it.
---
They give us the tools, how we use them is up to us most of the time.
---
There was a pmod name arshmello and that is my favorite one yet
---
Do you have a link to this related thing? I would actually love to read up on it.
---
The loot is different for each player, when you get a unique drop it chooses one person for it to go to (chances are based on your points). Unless you're doing FFAs the person that got the rare drop is supposed to split it.
---
BUY HIGH
---
SELL LOW
---
Wow what a surprise is a shit overcomplicated minigame that was 100% not rewarding realistic pvp fights is now going to be abused by bots. What a surprise, if only there were people who told them to not push this garbage.
---
The amazingpart is that someone really thought that it would be a realistic situation for 2 targets to meet in a hotspot in deep wildy and both carry 3 fucking emblems around
---
Or LMS
---
Translation: I'm okay with bots as long as it benefits me
---
Anyone that doesn't think this is good for the game is obviously a spite voter. I bet PvP gets a lot more people today, update is a success!
---
You can renew it for free with the Karamja elite diary
---
you'd think a system that was better at preventing boosting wouldve been one of the core goals of a bh rework XD
---
make sense, through partnered slayer.
---
Gz Bro!

---
Fuck you Ichael. Piece of shit.
---
people would just multilog on vms
---
Just do slayer. Good xp and slayer will eventually net you a LOT of gp
---
This^. Nothing is stopping players from bringing 250 noted bones and just being prepared for a fight while they do their thing. It's just that people are lazy, and a lot of them hate PvP for one reason or another, and would rather just play a victim card.
---
"He had no reason to attack me!"
---
But he did. You were in a PvP zone. It's always warranted. The whole idea that you MAY die for no reason, is the sole purpose of the wilderness. Content that's dangerous because of the restrictions of that area.
---
916 Nice yeet yeet skeet on the sheet
---
Keeping my dhcb regardless.
---
It'll probably go back up soon enough... i hope.
---
Or I'll sell it and just grab the lance. Don't care too much. Suddenly.
---
I bought my first one for 93 mil and it went back up to 115
---
The fact he didn't capitalize the c in "can" really bothers me
---
Brilliant
---
I would think that Jagex would take into account that most mobile devices have had mouse and keyboard functionality for several years. 
---
But I've never seen anything directly from them about it so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
and now I've seen everything
---
I was watching amenity yesterday when he was figuring all this stuff out. Once he started reviewing the new BH mechanics he predicted this right away lmao.
---
I had to leave before he could test it in a hotzone, but if nothing else, this post confirms he was right.
---
I bought my first one for 93 mil and it went back to 115
---
Im just going to come out and say it. Clans ruined PVP. Solo Pking is dead. Even in singles you get tag teamed over and over again. you try to fight someone and then the clan logs in and tags in when you used half your food. You cant risk anything because this happens over and over again. going to a boss? Guess what a clan is going to log in on your ass. Rev caves? more like clan caves. Here is my proposal. Make a PJ timer everywhere. also make the boss areas, multi-only when attacking the boss. nobody like 20 people logging in to have 20 ice barrages lading on your face to get stacked for 400 hp. spotting bots are bullshit and literally kill areas of the wilderness.
---
lmaooooo
---
Not even maxed on all main game modes smh.
---
I used a app called: "Octopus" to use my mouse on my Pixel. I had to use a USB-C to USB adapter, and just plugged my mouse in. As far as bluetooth and keyboard, I have no idea. But I had no issues.
---
Torille
---
The scam is that when you join a clan, you must abide by their rules. He did NOT abide by the rules.
---
Also into a customer service that still does not have a phone number to call
---
Ah how the turn tables
---
that's always the thing with pvp updates, since you're not fighting an npc but in fact fighting a human who can behave as you want and now can practically drop extra loot like npcs, it was inevitable that it would be abused, i think pvp should always be self contained and the reward should be what your enemy drops and nothing more, i mean really most people that want to do pvp will do it for fun, if they want consistent money they would be doing other less risky stuff.
---
You would think but I want to verify before I get some

\&gt; You begin your reply with the meme of the week as an insult, proceed to do the ol' reddit quote-by-quote dissection, and then follow up with a multi paragraph rant.   
---
You mean I made a joke, then responded to your points, then had 2 paragraphs of what your entire original comment was, a multi-paragraph rant?
---
God forbid I do what even you admit is a fairly standard way to deliver points in an argument, definite sign of mental illness there boysh.
---
\&gt; Did you expect me to take your reply seriously? 
---
I expected you to not have a coherent response - whether this was by delivering an incoherent response or not delivering a response I made no bets on.  
---
As for you taking my reply seriously - I refuted your points.  I really don't care whether or not you're taking that seriously, because it was a serious response, and I accomplished what I set out to do with it.  You as a person never mattered - your points are what I cared about.  And your opinion of me will do nothing to change what your points and my counterpoints are.
---
So since you just seem to be intent on clarifying that opinion and nothing else, my work here is done.  Good day.
---
Hot nerf, not really a fix. 1.1m/run instead of 3.3m. Still worth it for the bots.
---
I don't care myself, I'm not a RS3 fan strictly os for me, I was curious if anyone else here did like it or play both
---
You realize theres an item you can add to your gmaul to make it a 50/50 spec again. If someone doesnt want to risk 300k to make the gmaul 50/50 spec, theyre cheap as fuck.
---
Q
---
Happens to the best of us my man.
---
Good to hear, thank you. Have they ever talked about expanding into the existing lore or are they just going to expand on the 5th age?
---
That ign tho
---
Confirmed by who? Theres a a whole load of zulrah bot script for sale on scythe at all times
---
Fez in That 70's Show is a great example too
---
Think they mentioned in the same Q&amp;A that Mod Ed wrote some new lore so any further quest restrictions would make more sense. Prob the easiest solution than spending weeks writing and coding an entire new quest just for that.
---
The mistake was ever buying any game that's in early access
---
pretty sure the only people who would want to do this bounty hunting, would be pkers, and likely already have a skull, or, it'd go the same way deadman went, where every PKer refuses to skull, and only fights people already skulled, so.. no one gets a skull
---
This is the dumbest comment I've seen in some time. Bots will be able to do anything in the game, and a lot of better than actual players. If they lock zulrah behind a quest, they will just script bots to unlock it (and yeah I know they'll have to get levels and such, but they will script those too)
---
I recently started doing it. I make sure I‚Äôm close to full health and if I get hit twice I‚Äôll stop and start eating. I realized you don‚Äôt have to run, so no need to worry about that. It‚Äôs sped up some of my kills. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it but I still haven‚Äôt beat my PB from not using it
---
Oh absolutely having the 8 way switch makes it much more demanding. I was just thinking maybe since Vorkath was top dog for so long maybe people want to switch it up. Realistically I think people seeing it drop just causes panic sells. Kind of a domino effect.
---
Imagine if your buddy could see you asking OSRS reddit for help with a comeback tho. THAT would be hilarious
---
I'm confused what you're asking - seems like this can be mitigated by making an f2p account to buy bonds with. Just drop trade the cash to buy from GE then use it on the ironman, or just buy with real cash on the ironman

Yeah, I've never played Rs3 either. All the interfaces and menus, looks crowded, especially on mobile.
---
That's not a projection. That was based on observations reinforced through some light perusing of studies. What you did was a projection. 
---
I didn't generalize either. I also didn't say everyone who sits for that period is unhealthy. You're intentionally skewing my words. I said that sitting for extended periods is unhealthy - not that the person is unhealthy. There's the difference.
---
I don't actually spend that much time arguing. It's more engaged in conversation. What's your connection to "my constitution? Engaging in discourse suddenly isn't healthy? By that reasoning, cruising through my history making your assumptions based off comments isn't good for "your constitution". 
---
Nah, mate. Good try at inciting some sort of inflamed response, though. Your sarcasm needs some refinement, but your pettiness is quite practiced. I suggest omitting the emoticon though as it kind of weakens your intentions.
---
Here's my feedback Jagex, FUCK YOU.
---
First we had removing 3p client features which negatively affected absolutely no one, now this. You want only pvp players to vote on wilderness updates despite the fact that there's tons of non-pvp related content in the wilderness.
---
Are you guys actively trying to piss off your playerbase at the moment or what?
---
He makes a good point, and is the main reason why they havent added this
---
Just don‚Äôt lose. Ez or if someone is only risking what you say(what pures usually risk before the update), blk dhides and such, then just make them skull, and you dont? Simple.
---
Aight, well he‚Äôs basically just on the ‚Äúdo not raid with or trust list‚Äù hopefully it doesn‚Äôt spiral into a suicide, but if it eats at him that much, he can clear his name and actually split the twisted bow lol
---
oof 100
---
The problem with it is ddoser that make people die and ruin the game thats why it got changed in the first place its the lesser of 2 evils
---
Inspirational!  I'm in rather poor health due to some muscle dysfunction and I've toyed in my head with ways to exercise/game at the same time.  The cycling board thing is a great idea!

The only thing I sort of like is the tool belt idea, where your tools don't take up inventory space and are always with you, but hey OS is for the pros and we overcome üí™

Is using menu entry swapper on the silver sickle(b) to "cast bloom" against the new rules? I am aware menu entry swapping isn't allowed on equipped items, but it is in my inventory when I use it as I equip my lunar staff. Thanks.
---
A significant time having passed would be back to rs2 era. 4 years is in the osrs era so obviously not that long ago, rightfully so.
---
Half the people on this thread are oblivious to the fact that this was a clan raid.. Who needs context when you have a keyboard.
---
Yea I don‚Äôt see why it can‚Äôt just be ME1 or at most ME2
---
Sote is fair but like i don‚Äôt want to get essentially base 70s for it
---
A pattern of the community upvoting ridiculously rare cases...
---
Well to be fair you literally hop past Zulrah‚Äôs shrine in the quest.
---
I think they've mentioned that for OS before and people have shot it down? I can't remember, lol. I'd love that idea, personally, though.

I‚Äôm sure you can tell when bot ban waves are by checking in on prices of items like red chin every so often. It‚Äôs crazy how the price fluctuates like 20% and that‚Äôs only while the new bots train up their hunter. If there were no bots hunter would be one of the better money makers in the game I think.
---
Gratz on spending half ur life on rs
---
Tbh removing 100% protection prayers would be quite an interesting change.   
---
Also no point to discuss there, they are different games. RS3 is great in it's way, ignoring the MTX ofc. The PvP seems nice i guess. Skilling achievements still feel more relevant in OSRS.
---
And there's me who can barely complete Dragon Slayer without dying to Elvarg twice in a row.

yeah making money off youtube vids while playing a game for fun is definitely a waste of time hobby
---
MADLAD
---
Even easier with the lance tbh
---
They should allow 1 kill before the quest - heck there should be a kill requirement to start the quest. You kill Zulrah once and piss off the locals, so they don't let you back until you finish the quest.
---
Congrats! Check out r/ironscape if you haven't already.

Her prayers have been answered, so she says "Oh God yes!" a lot.
---
GL
---
Ugh, sounds like you would enjoy ironman
---
Well, slayer isn't even good for money so that's irrelevant.
---
I'd like to withdraw my twisted bow, please
---
I'm really excited to follow your progress.  I should get back into something like this.  Keep it up!
---
I had one when it was like 20m back before ds2 was even announced, I sold it off instead of hanging on to it and I could have flipped it for 8x the price if I just held on to it for a few more months while I was taking a break from the game üòî
---
So why would dhcb go down if they are changing zulrah reqs? Seems like blowpipe and scales would go up, not dhcb
---
quite good on kbd aswell but yeah it doesn't have enough uses and inflation causing the item to drop but merchers aswell.
---
ah alright thanks for the extra info, definitely handy to know. And yeah hopefully can find a couple others to do it,  i'll try 4 as you suggested. Cheers!
---
don't understand how this comment is so low, that's exactly what's happening.
---
Vorkath prime example

I will never be this organized

You don‚Äôt get it kiddo, do you? üòÇ

These bots that say "100k minimum, 55x2" or something like that in crowded places - they aren't coded well with paying back the player that did the bet. John123 trades bot his money. Then John123 trades to receive his payout for winning. Receiving the trade request from John123 tells the bot to payout on trade. You spam trade requests, and the bot pays you John123's winnings. John123 learns that bots scam and why you don't break the No Gambling rule, the bot is out the money, and you profit.
---
That is the Right Honorable representative of Morytania, sir.
---
Why does it say 106wc? Remember a few times I'd look at people and see various stats at 100+?
---
No.
---
After 6 hours of being logged in without relogging you get autologged, it's a warning of that
---
Oh ty
---
Even with iron man, you don't. Dragon slayer and buy it, but some things, you grind to unlock. Blue d'hide was an enjoyable achievement after getting smashed by abherrent spectres.
---
Safe mechanics on everything already no thanks unless the chin box is quite expensive.
---
I have about 2k vorkath kills and average ~1:15 kill time with dhcb. You're doing something wrong.
---
Nice repost
---
Makes it easier to activate prayers right before specs and shit when you rearrange them
---
Once I realized the series ended where it would begin, I just started messing with things.

Equating a content creator spending time on a game that makes him money to talking someone out of suicide looooool
---
Congratulations, well done on improving your health!
---
Thank you lol
---
You go king !
---
This is sad. Not even funny.
---
I‚Äôm not super aware of the lore surrounding Zulrah, so I‚Äôm not sure if that would fit. If it does though that‚Äôs a great idea!
---
Eyes are creepy AF
---
BIg gz to all the participants!
---
It was known from beta blogs, I'm surprised nobody in Jagex QA team took a moment to read it.
---
I don't see how pvp discussion has anything to do with poorly implemented pvp changes. 
---
As I asked another commenter:
---
How does people voting no to changes make it so that bad changes are implemented? 
---
If they ask "do you want this change?", and the vote fails, how does that lead us to the current situation?
---
How is this flubbed update caused by my not paying attention to pvp discussion?
---
I remember watching streams of the HCIM a couple years ago. Not sure if he still streams since I'm not on twitch much.
---
When raiding you get points based on how much you do. At the end of the raid, assuming you roll the rare table (typically a 7-10% chance) the game picks a player to recieve the rare. The more points you have the greater chance you get at an item (you could do nothing and still get a rare drop, though this is very very rare)
---
In we do raids you are expected to split and if you dont you are added to the ban list which makes raiding almost impossible as everyone knows you scam
---
Lol then what‚Äôs the point in you crying about venezuela on reddit? I don‚Äôt care how many months of your life you‚Äôve put in this game, the only point is it‚Äôs retarded to complain about rule breakers without holding the people who are supposed to moderate them accountable, but apparently you agree so idk why ur whining about venezuelans you sweaty autist
---
Note - this will pay maybe 1-2 times an hour. Low success rate, but it is still 200k+ per hour. The other option has some minor risk. DM me and I will explain. More ethical**
---
MTX Is fine but there's a fine line to draw and everyone knows what that line is.
---
''Cosmetic Only''
---
Jagex messed up when they added coins and XP/Bonus XP to treasure hunter/squeel of fortune.
---
Oof imagine unironically using OSBuddy
---
GUH
---
Keep hoping.
---
I have about the same bank with 78 slayer, but I also have 89 runecrafting
---
Oh okay thats cool thanks for the info
---
OSRS doesn't really care about lore the same way RS3 does
---
the middle guy has a naruto headband
---
I enjoy my job but I don‚Äôt want to do it 12-16 hours a day and really only leave my job to go get food to keep myself alive so I do my job more
---
Hey I get to repost this next month ok
---
No pkers at least...
---
I think most people would say 99 attack
---
200m from farming? What d you farm and farming level?
---
They very explicitly said equipped items so I think you're ok
---
Osrs player here. 
---
This most recent update allowed players to generate 20m+/hr with the only requirement being a second account that you can use. 
---
Inaccurate as fuxk
---
You'll have to be way more specific than that...
---
yooo 916 wanna go get a beer or smoke or kiss
---
The only rules are Jagex rules, this isn't a _am
---
"Caught out"?
---
dont like their pker vs pvmer direction
---
&gt;now going to be abused by bots.
---
Just like rs3 BH was!
---
Just make BH happen in one smaller area so these guys can't hide
---
He‚Äôs joking, stay away from RC.
---
You mean *deep wildy pkers*
---
I love this post so much. You made some insane results while scaping.. now I challenge you to get 99 strength while only doing free weights
---
Wasn't it shown that if literally all the people who voted no due to the "I don't like PvP" option voted yes instead it STILL would've failed? And how was Jagex "forced" to do this? How pathetic do you have to be to blame literally everything on "spite voters"? By your logic, every single poll that ever fails is due to people spite voting no, and even if it is shown that the quantity of actual people doing that is inarguably insignificant, then that's wrong because they all lied and Jagex should just skirt the polls for every update you/me/whoever want.
---
Huh?
---
crates are fucking stupid OP
---
crates alone are 1-2m/hr if you're good at pking which is ridiculous. PvP is about taking from another fucking player.
---
OOF, and on such an unimpressive pet too
---
What space are you trying to save? I did my tree/fruit tree runs, and then herb right after without banking. You do know you can pay for the farmers with notes correct?
---
Kkkkkkkkk
---
Nerf blowpipe
---
Cause people are selling their dchb to start farming Zulrah since they think the items from it will increase in value if this happens
---
1KC DWH or bust
---
Outside of gorrillas, cerb, and hydra, no it's really not. If you consider bloodvelds, fire giants, hellhounds then doing a task of gargoyles for an hour to get 400k good money go for it. But it's not good money.
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll check it out.
---
I mean... That's probably one of the fastest ways to max a group Ironman account. Have 4 accounts gathering supplies and one maxing.
---
That is correct. And it seems that most of the opinions that Jagex has for "PvP improvements" is demonstrably nonsense so they would like for only those that agree with their nonsense to vote.
---
On top of that, there are some great PvP improvement suggestions from the community but an overwhelming amount of whiny idiots proposing their own version of broken and thoughtless content.
---
I can kill him pretty consistently on PC but I'm afraid to try on mobile..
---
So like what if the raid I scout has Olm in it
---
He already has 99 on atleast 2 of them, his normal ironman and his hcim. Those 2 are both maxed.
---
I didn't even start slayer until around 2k total, most elite diaries done, and around 200-300m in gear. Made my money from farming, double astral rc, some bf smithing, a ton of zalcano when it came out, and agility.
---
Chad doesn‚Äôt leak his gfs nudes
---
I didn't vote in any bh update polls.
---
!remindme December 2018
---
Cool -- i'll add you. What is your RSN?
---
Sweet, i'll be on in a bit and add you :).
---
Pretty sure the vast majority of players does not have this
---
Or a different password...
---
Thanks :)
---
Thank you for answering
---
Never bothered after my 1st cape. Died twice on tournament worlds, failed again on 1st try and got it 2nd attempt. I was legit losing sleep and hair over it so i never did it again. I turned the account into a ranged tank cause i never had the cape now im to lazy train my melee stats now that I do have it
---
Youve had 3 of a drop thats worth 40m and 0 of a completely worthless drop, whats to complain about
---
Man im on that grind too... 3.2k kc and nothing (not complaining tho), hope i dont go as dry as u tho. Gl!
---
:)
---
Why is it too much? The boss has some of the best money, uniques, and materials in the game. Why would it be too much to lock it behind SOTE? It's one of the best bosses to do in the game, locking it behind a quest like that doesn't seem like the least bit excessive. Just because they made a mistake of making it too easy to get to before doesn't mean we should continue to do that, that's a terrible argument and makes no sense.
---
Ofcourse there is going to be more good cases than bad. The bad cases that are there though are extremely important. Some people have insane amounts of time put into this game just to have it taken away. Same thing with people who dismiss bad police interactions because there are more good than bad. Those interractions are still super important and need to be addressed.
---
I got a pb around 1:10 with no rigour, no woox waking and using normal ruby/diamond bolts not dragon
---
If you do this you can equip bank and withdraw the cape as much as you‚Äôd like. You just have to do this every 99
---
16 hours is extreme.
---
I do 12 hour shifts in a Job I don't like, I could easily do 12 hours doing a job I enjoy.
---
Definitely not the 0 pets which is the entire reason for the post/photo edit. :facepalm:
---
True there are other ways to make money and true low lvl slayer makes you 0gp but once you start hitting the gargs and brutal blacks slayer can is very profitable. If you had to pick one way to make the best gp what would you say? (Not trying to sound sarcastic just curious) i didnt feel like i was making that much at blast furnace and i was using a coal bag maybe i should have stuck with it a little longer
---
That's not what I said. I'm just saying that we can't definitively say if there's a trend either way because this sub sufferers from huge confirmation bias.
---
Tbf tbow has dropped 8m in like 2 weeks :(
---
There is obviously a problem. Don't put your head in the sand and ignore it. Downvoting my comments wont make them less true btw.
---
Not impressed, gratz on 4 pedestrian accs.
---
Make a 70s cmb 99 slay w/ no slayer helm and maybe it's  a worthy accomplishment
---
I literally just got enough money to buy this...you've gotta be kidding me.
---
thanks ill have to look into this more sure.
---
I don't think the two are equivalent, tbh. One is a bug/glitch and the other is just aloofness. 
---
Discovery of flicking is in no way similar to not questioning what items someone will have in their inventory when training a skill that requires inventory space.
---
Yes. OSRS does not currently do double XP promos.
---
916 area code? cuz I'm down dog
---
I know what you mean, add me up ign: Ekonan
---
Which is why im saying that Pkers deserve the items and to get to balance their gameplay, but it needs to be done in ways that don't effect normal gameplay, such as the new stuff in pvp/bounty worlds or in hotspots
---
Jaksaa jaksaa. Motivoiva nimi ainaki, aika kova
---
I literally completed Regicide last night JUST to do money snek. Missed my chance to use ground markers too, and I‚Äôm still pretty pissed that‚Äôs been done away with.
---
Now they want to lock it behind SoTE?!
---
Fuck me, mate. That was going to be my one way ticket out of crippling poverty.
---
Jagex: adds update where two players can kill eachother to spawn items*
---
people abuse it*
---
jagex: surprised pikachu face*
---
Yeah nice cherry picking, this represents a very small minority of the pkers. Most do NOT use ahk/macros... 
---
Pking is dying and this is NOT the reason.
---
If all you do for farming is farm herbs, it makes a lot of money to 99
---
except your acc won't be set up for pking which puts you at a disadvantage
---
Bought at 111 for vork, was all of my bank at the time. Now I can never sell it because I'll just be mad at how low it is
---
RIP
---
Jagex needs to add a strip club to osrs. Great gold sink. Make it a 500k cover to get in. All sorts of strippers from gnomes, elves, dwarfs maybe a goblin and even a human. Perhaps the goblin is transsexual because ‚Äúthe money is really good‚Äù.
---
Should spend your time grinding an actual cool pet, Vorki is like Zulrah/Kraken, no one gives a shit if you got 1.
---
You should have blackened his name at the top of the client.  You could saved a friend.
---
I've been kinda tracking it and a few weeks ago they were 18-20k/shard. Now they're around 11k/shard. Dropped off hard idk why.
---
Stick with the range pure til you get bored, then work in mith/addy/rune 2h so you can stack those tasty KO‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt touch prayer til your range/str levels are UP there. Keep strength high and ranged a little higher.
---
I'm the absolute reverse, but really need to switch to the lance
---
REEEeeeeeEEEEEeeee YoU'rE wRoNg BeCaUsE sInGlE wAy CoMbAt ShOuLd Be MuLtI oNlY fOr My ClAn Of SaLaD fUcKeRs.
---
Newsflash: Single Way combat exists and has existed so that solo players could fight other solo players. If you wanted to take 20 players to fight people, you should have to go to multi.
---
Stop crying because you're not guaranteed a kill. You're not a victim of an unfair meta, you're just an entitled bitch. PvMers and solo Pkers use Dinh's because they know at any point you and your goonsquad could just pile them even in singles.
---
If you're fine with clans in singles, then Dinh's shouldn't be a problem either. OP shit against OP shit, simple as that.
---
you fucking asshole
---
I mean I'm quite certain rwt 200 mil on a main account, especially using a mule would not result in a ban on the main account especially if you are more discreet than just trading over the money.
---
Don't think most consumers use a complex system of mules, and I'm pretty sure most consumers aren't banned.
---
True before this there were no bots
---
Wtf dude I guess if you don't have a quest cape you aren't a real gamer??
---
the gold farmers have moved on
---
Fucking take the upvote and get out of here
---
Well If you go to get tracker you see that everything crashed this time last year. Prices always go down at this time because people play less on winter. That's why I sold everything else than my vorkath gear at end of the last month,  probably invest in bonds when they drop
---
Clan "wedoraids" should be able to help you out.
---
I was gonna skip going to the gym today, but because of this post I am going to get that irl Xp.
---
There was post showing how much one zulrah bot farm made

I still do it, even when my shitty Ironman has like a 12 max hit

Ruins wildly slayer pvmers too. Mainly fucked over pvpers, but also fucked over a good chunk of pvmers

---
She deleted the aforementioned post I see. I still don't think it's very professional posting non-jagex related things under a mod handle considering other jmods have 2 accounts for that reason.
---
Are there any requirements to scouting?
---
0 pets comment lol
---
Or use the crystal chest, if you don't have very high herblore. 10 shards, one key, generally make 50-70k
---
All and all 1 tick switch them to be a beautiful unicorn
---
lol just because someone doesn't have level 70 in 2 separate flushing money down the drain skills, doesn't mean they don't really play the game.
---
Oh wow. I mean they were bound to drop with how many shards come into the game. I did a big chunk of them around a month ago at 16k per. I guess I should've used all of em when I had the chance lol
---
Blow pipe is worth it even at 10m
---
Mmmmm... To come think about it, doing heavily afking methods like cannonballs or yew/magic trees it could work, to do reps.
---
I consider it, but I do not plan to become heavily muscular - I am already satisfied to my current muscle build. But thanks for the idea! \^\^
---
Thank you! \^\^
---
Glad to hear that I motivated you way or another! :D
---
70 isn't even a million experience... so for someone who's playing the game, 70 should be nothing. It's not my fault you don't know what you're doing.
---
Quite a long time ago from what I remember. I‚Äôm 90% sure we voted. Either that or it was a devblog that didn‚Äôt get enough support to move forward
---
That‚Äôs this community‚Äôs opinion on everything lol
---
Shit 100mill!? I have 2mill and feel rich
---
I know there are zulrah bots but im saying the large amount is mostly gold farmers
---
Nice. I liked how Benjo made his 1 column rather than 2.  Makes it easier to scroll on mobile.  Maybe keep that in mind if you make more!
---
Origami level 99
---
Honestly I'm considering doing this same exact thing now. This is such a cool idea and ever since I started working at a desk fulltime at the beginning of the year, I have been packing on the pounds... 
---
Excellent work and keep improving yourself my friend!
---
I think I did medium and did Gargoyles with a bludgeon for a minute. Then past ~95 or so I just wanted fast exp
---
This unironically, all those chinese looking letters are the same to us regular folk.
---
Wait can you link that clip lmao that sounds amazing to watch
---
Maybe they were forced to make unpolled changes, but nobody forced them to make shitty changes
---
Trenbolonge sandwiches are for humans
---
I agree but so far most wildy updates suck ass. They should add different pvp modes other than the current lame old ass method.
---

Uncut lemon = what i thought customer support was

cut lemon = what i now know customer support is

50/50*
---
"No that's wrong, you could get it through slayer" is literally not what i said. Learn to read.
---
still not good enough. 
---
If i killed someone in old bh with a t9, i got 2.5m points. Thats 2 rune pouches and 250 bags. I could also buy a t10 and get 500 looting bags for 2m.
---
i'll drop them too XD
---
WeDoRaids, big discord server for teaming up for raids/learning raids/etc
---
Price difference though.  Max str with lance vs dhcb and pegs with void.
---
Can't find the picture but 86 kc here. The grind was rough.
---
Yes it is anecdotal but when 100+ people from the midwest all playing osrs from multiple locations have no problem on US worlds it becomes  actual evidence that the problem lies with you. So you can go eat a dick with your sarcasm.
---
There is a guy who is 19k dry of supreme pet. I ran into him the other day, said good luck, did my sis task, and for supreme pet an hour in at 500 kc
---
Because it actually doesn‚Äôt fucking happen? Lmao meanwhile you leave menu entry swapper on and you can get banned for not even using it. But pkers are able to auto switch prayer, gear change, run scripts etc. How is that information not surprising to you?
---
Zulandra teleports are only maybe worth it if you are getting multiple kills per trip. If you use zulandra teleports for 1 kill then it eats in your profit alot. So until you can get ~3 ish kills per trip keep using fairy ring .
---
Been watching him about 4/5 years. Clint is a real gent.
---
Well I brought up in the past it was only available to bh. Why bring up that it's available from slayer points if you didnt mean in the same time period I was talking about? That's obviously what you meant. Stop being fucking obtuse to delude yourself that you weren't wrong.
---
Btw
---
I don't bother. I do vorkath for a chill money maker and woox walking with BP is too sweaty
---
Would doing this be bannable If o bonded an alt and played em both myself?  As in, not botting?
---
So rough, very high skill level for a 87 slayer monster
---
Still in profit at that 24m pre-buff buy
---
Didn't he say he wasn't a big fan of the "god ash" meme?
---
Add me rsn: varrick7 I'll sell you some
---
Or maybe op would know better cause it's his own account? God you people are cynical.
---
You're projecting meanings from phrases i specifically didn't say and ones you're making up, onto things i did say. Hence why you're delusional.
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
They have the white portal too, where you can definitely find an available world and definitely have clan free for alls. You even have the option for friendly fire and using team capes to identify each other.
---
A defense level capped server is unnecessary because Jagex has made an environment where you can do exactly what you listed uninterrupted. If you're not willing to use the white portal in Clan Wars then that is an issue with you and your pure clans.
---
I mean yeah I can make a post about plenty of things. My ex makes plenty of texts to my phone but if they keep saying they‚Äôre changing and they aren‚Äôt then what the fuck was the point of the post lol
---
If you're f2p and you buy bonds with real money instead of membership there is something seriously fucked up in your head and you should go to a doctor to get checked out
---
It was down to like 14? At one point but that was before it was majorly buffed.
---
It's not botting, no, but I have no idea how Jagex will view it in terms of other rules, like exploiting a bug.
---
I thought that would be the case, there's allot of crowding on a PC I couldn't imagine it all being jammed on a mobile screen
---
Still Patrick nonetheless
---
I really agree with the song of the elves prerequisite. There‚Äôs virtually no reason not to do it. Getting skills to 70 people act like is so bad. I did base 80‚Äôs in around 9 months playing on and off and only after work before bed. The cash skills are easy too, people just don‚Äôt want to have to earn money
---
thx for ur opinion virgin. lol....
---
"Decent amount" but you can only prove that there are 2.
---
Meh who cares I'm sure plenty of ppl scam in raids, this just happened to be caught.
---
Oh ty. I didn't see they had updated this.
---
Yea just funny he did it on stream
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9r1xmr/this_is_how_a_venezuelan_goldfarmer_looks_like/
---
Thats a ton of ore
---
So why make your comment then? Please explain how it adds to my point that bh was the only way possible to get one and that it probably still effects peoples mentality? I even mentioned the slayer point option undermines that mentality in my comment.
---
Some people arent bottom feeding scum
---
Ya it's not ideal but I think it's better than letting 100's of people with no KC determine changes to the boss.
---
People get banned for it mate, jagex can detect when your only clicking once for blackjack.
---
Why do you keep ur gp on u when ur not UIM
---
Yep exact reason why I don‚Äôt watch boatys stream
---
everyone freaks out over not having pool..
---
play on 330 with 1 construction and you have a maxed house

I mean you may be right on that point. I just thought you were trolling me so i was trolling back.
---
Blackjacking? What‚Äôs that, is that PVP?
---
Herb runs, barrows, merching, swapping
---
Your right that they can trade non tradeable but giving them a bonus shared bank would allow gim to have more bank space per bond which is a clear advantage. Iron man mode is supposed to limit your account not give it benefits
---
You, the jagex team, should let us move the prayers at least, it's not a big advantage for us and there are so many prayers that no one uses, i'll pray u let us move the prayers. I'm okay with the resize forbid.
---
You just said you understand that they they have been ... then go to say it doesn‚Äôt happen ...  ??
---
Try their own poll results? https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Poll:Bounty_Hunter_Rework_rewards
---
The only PKer-buff poll question that could have passed without "spite-voters" taken into account, by their own numbers, was the Abyssal Dagger upgrade. The rest would still be below passing threshold. But yeah that one staged twitter post is definitely the whole truth.
---
True. I wish people would skip questions they know they donr have the knowledge for. Thats what i try to do.
---
We‚Äôve all thought about it, but this mad lad actually did it. Congrats man
---
Because if you wanted to save 5p or whatever the conversion is you can buy them 1 at a time if you really want to.
---
It's just lose change, people don't care about it. They round their change up to pay to a random charity which lines the pockets of the charity managers whilst they pretend to help the needy. That happens whilst we ignore the blatent poverty around us but we do not help those in n√©ed that we see.
---
To be honest I don't know why.
---
I have told myself I would do the same before. Like ten pushups every time I die at revs. I gave up I should start again
---
Thanks lmao
---
Why did that happen? Did the goliath kill her
---
Zulrah has been out for almost 5 years? They're now just getting around to fixing such a busted MM method? I haven't played for a few years but I think the damage has already been done.

I am Venezuelan. My entire family immigrated to the USA including my parents so I am also first generation American.
---
The situation there is disgusting and sad.  My family is having to build bars on windows from constant burglary and has even been car jacked at gun point multiple times. The Venezuelan currency has experienced out of control inflation, jobs are few and far between, hell even the grocery stores are empty. 
---
That being said, the Venezuelan population of this game is often either very sweet and humble or people that are just downright assholes. The only time you can determine the first is if you speak any Spanish. The people that are assholes are abrasive, rude, and blatantly fucking over a beloved game for personal gain. They are profiting at your and my expense. It‚Äôs very hard to look past that for some people and I don‚Äôt blame them.
---
Prices spike at Christmas break. Probably around thanksgiving a bit, but that‚Äôs US only. Christmas is international

It really does disgust me that Zalcano is more smithing xp per hour than actually mining ore. That's the thing that pissed me off with ironman mode: The best way to do a lot of skills is to make money with Slayer, then buy your way to the skills.

Low considering im almost lvl 100 and have yet to get it
---
The account is 14 years old and the ban was in 2014 for macroing. I had botted iron ores on it and got banned within the same day. After 3 years I applied my ban, which got declined. 2 years later I decided to apply again and the account got a positive response. The very same account had scamming and offensive language mutes. Account holds near 0 total levels in 07 and about 800 in RuneScape 3.

---
Looks like money laundering
---
Sick outfit
---
Thank you very much for your words\~ After all I used to be obese, but I changed my lifestyle and I hope to improve others' lives way or another into better. As for my journey, I will keep up playing OSRS, exercise &amp; combine it with OSRS and write stories. :)
---
Sorta: we both are into Agility, but I just multitasked mine. :p
---
Yes but you dont lose anything else which in a sense defeats the purpose of a death
---
Always love seeing good fan art, amazing work man!
---
All you gotta do is kill stuff not too bad
---
I have a locked low level Ironman account I tried to recover.  I only played it for a little bit, then quit.  Eventually the actual email was deleted for inactivity since I only made it for RuneScape.  I tried to change the email but it's literally impossible.  It never had membership so there's no way I can provide that info so everything instantly gets denied.  I provided info on country changes, internet providers, even wrote *exactly* everything I did on that account in the text box because I literally only did 2 things on that account yet it immediately gets denied by the Jagex's appeal bot.
---
Not upset since I didn't put much time into it, moreso I'm upset that there's literally nothing I can do in this situation because Jagex's appeal bot is fucked.
---
You did infinitely more exercise inbetween though, making you the opposite :~)
---
Maybe with that money he can get a haircut
---
ba services, its like 110-150m
---
With a massive lag and time getting into someone elses house. I mean, yeah you should do it until you can aford your own. I also did it.
---
Have you moved since the last time you've played a lot, or created the account? Having an IP that links to an address much further away will drastically reduce the chances of a recovery appeal being denied.  
---
Are you getting the rejection emails within a minute?  
---
If so, I'd recommend using TeamViewer to access the computer of a parent or friend who still lives in the original area.  
---
I had an appeal with the exact same information turn from being denied to being accepted instantly by doing this.
---
Also I feel like lance kills is by far easier and you have less chance to die and wooxwalking is way easier with melee too
---
Nah you have to max all skills both on rs and irl in the same method.
---
Now go out into the real world and craft runes for 400 hours.
---
Ive got a master on my Ironman from where I don‚Äôt even remember, but I‚Äôm on the 3rd step and it‚Äôs to smith a rune med helm. Can‚Äôt express the sadness it makes me feel bc that‚Äôs suuuuuch a huge grind
---
You've gotta elaborate. If you mean taking the current blessed chaps and simply reducing the def level required, that's silly. Why would every piece but the legs require a different defense level.
---
If you mean allowing lower tiers of D'hide to have blessed forms (aka, not sharing stats with black) that seems fine...
---
The only problem I see overall is power creep. If a low tier piece of dhide has +1 pray bonus, what should tier 70 range blessed hide have - should it go to 2? What about Arma? One of the big points for getting the def for black is the pray bonus that blessed hide and higher provide.
---
They buffed it because it was ass
---
Why is it stinky?
---
Nope, you're just terrible at it.
---
Well, simple. You go to the white portal and look for an empty world, have all the pure clans show up and fight there. I don't see how that's hard to grasp.
---
If someone's specifically bringing their mains to grief you then that's unfortunate but to be expected when you have hundreds of players.
---
The idea that Jagex should dedicate worlds to a group of players who limit themselves solely so they can organize a massive clan war once a week is actual grasping at straws. I'm sorry you're too blinded by your entitlement, but you chose to limit yourself.
---
Thanks for the advice but im at the same address and using the same PC that I last logged into the account on.
---
Good advice though.

"Removal or swapping of menu entries on any entity" refers to entities within boss fights. The changes made to RuneLite to comply with the rules are listed here: https://runelite.net/blog/show/2019-10-30-1.5.37-Release

The dragon warhammer method.
---
I hope that's not true
---
Yes, everything that's currently in RuneLite is okay.
---
Ugh. This is what I get for not selling my DCHB after I got burnt out on the game
---
...Facing a 20m drop in what I sold my bank for is not gonna get me back in the grind
---
Yep and one day communism will be tried "for real" and succeed.
---
So left click to use bones is allowed?
---
for all roles or per role?
---
There needs to be a way to contact an actual support team for situations like this.
---
I see u are also a member of /r/wallstreetbets
---
I love how it was just a strait up reaction for this guy, didn't even hesitate. Just "I'm outta here."
---
This
---
In before someone asks OP how many amulets he has in bank
---
Underrated comment
---
I‚Äôm saying the reason they want to do it is to combat botting not to add lore, regardless of what they add
---
I'm in the US and my parents didn't get me circumcised and I'm very thankful for that.
---
I'm too scared
---
Obviously Jagex will never tell us what they are doing and detecting, but I'm pretty confident they can tell different clients apart. Whether or not a plugin is active would probably be much harder, though. We'll see if they blanket ban cheat client users or actually try to detect the plugins.
---
Oh wow what a dick
---
correct
---
My point seems unclear. Requirements for a higher tier diary should *not* be lower than that of its predecessors. That is not strict to skills only, but also quest requirements. If SOTE becomes a *hard* requirement then elite *must* be updated to balance. Since you can pickpocket elves after MEP1 they would intern have to remove that feature over there.
---
Wow real life monkfish
---
I got vorki while going for assembler, hope you get it soon tho.
---
Is the dragon cross bow with the dragonfire ward any good at Vorkath or should I use the blow pipe until I can get the dh crossbow?
---
KempQ and BoomEpicKill
---
Given they are content creators, im sure they inspired a few more
---
usually wr raids go for 3-5mill...you can scout on mutiple accs and actually make good money

&lt;3
---
Ahem.
---
**He.**
---
Finished about two weeks ago, then watched Broly this past weekend.
---
He's also a strong advocate of the free market and sells his woodwork to the folks of Pawnee.
---
I have a dragon cbow, why rune?
---
you crazy fuck, how long did this take you?
---
He stands alone
---
You‚Äôd do well on r/wallstreetbets
---
It isn't unclear. Your point is a poor one. Quests don't matter, the skills requirements are far lower and take much less time to obtain, and will require the new quest to finish it. Just because that is how you think it should be doesn't mean that others do, because it's dumb. Ardy hard requires mep2, legends, mm1 and watchtower. Ardy elite requires dt and haunted mine. Jagex already has diaries different than how youve said they should be.
---
Any runelite plugins or settings that anyone would reccomend for revenant hunting?
---
If you care about bonds crashing then you need to put down mom‚Äôs credit card
---
It's still there. That one doesn't actually make bosses any easier or change the fight in any way, so there's no need to remove it
---
Considering quitting instead of finding my account stolen by jagex after more years of investment.
---
Fuck this support
---
the majority of the game is PvE? like that's the goal of almost every game lol...
---
PvP is additional content, not the purpose of the game, and when there is a player on the other side it will always be abused. Even legit PvP is blatantly abused with skull tricks and lures. Now people are using alts and friends lol
---
The greatest bank robbery ever pulled off.
---
Ham members aren't Kosher anyways so they don't matter
---
Well written post and a huge congrats on this meaningful milestone! 
---
And next to that 17k death runes from selling cats and exactly 500 total too, that's well thought out so far.
---
GL on the hunt for the quest point cape, definitely one of the most fun things to go for in this game :)
---

---
Any reason you're funneling points into torsos, or did you just want to make this gif?
---
Wow bs
---
And to make you feel even worse, you're nowhere near the drop rate than when you first killed Vorkath. &lt;3
---
lol settle down there. I have a normie that's over 1750 total that I played for about 10 months when i returned with mobile's release. 
---
I wasn't knocking anyone. Was just saying um or iron is the way to go cause I think normie accounts are boring.
---
Oh dvs is devious I get it
---
I couldn't say. I just casually BA on this account while playing on my alt, lol. I do 13 to 40 minute games on world 6 depending on the team I'm with.
---
Lootshare was terrible. The loot went to a random person and then that person would just leave when they got something good because his loot potential was gone and there was no point.
---
Coinshare destroyed the economy.
---
Shardshare was basically scam city.
---
No, lol. 
---
1 instance of this happening does not justify introducing some system which will destroy the economy. Also, this is why you don't raid with people you don't trust.
---
Can I get it unpunctuated please?
---
Insta sold things for med in GE to spit out a coin split, even if that thing never came into the game.
---
Resulted in GP becoming worth substantially less over the time it was left in what is now RS3, unchecked (years).
---
Because no one would get the item on coinshare. You would just get the split for the item dropped instead of the item.
---
So basically only coins came into the game.
---
Support. Consolidate pvp mini games to reduce spreading the playerbase too thin
---
The goal of this game was originally PvP and that's what made it popular. It was nuked through shit decisions twice and it drove the player base away. Now we're stuck at 70k players.
---
Stop trying to force this into a PvM game when it's not what made it popular.
---
No chance they are one ticking 8 ways no problem without some sort of auto switch or at the minimum clicking with their keyboard. I‚Äôve one ticked 7 ways but I can assure you it‚Äôs not every time.
---
nice keep posting
---
monkaSheet
---
Yeah same, Jagex wouldn't let me recover my main from 2006 despite me trying to recover it like 10 times between 2011 and 2018. Nobody was on the account either, so not sure why they didn't help. Guess it's lost forever I had to make a new one.
---
Wouldn't the tree... IDK burn?
---
Unrealistic, downvote
---
True, but he did expressly state he was making an f2p alt for f2p Pking. I think it's fair to think he intends to only play it on f2p.
---
But, I may be totally wrong.
---
That's still 3 mil an hour, is that supposed to be bad?
---
I thought the instasell into the he gave the item to the buyer? Just made the process faster and safer
---
That would be the defender role!
---
Honestly, I just wouldn't bother. I'm already playing Runescape 3-4 hours less a day than I used to.
---
I'm 24, work full time, trying to start a family. I play maybe 30mins to an hour a day when I can. Sometimes on weekends I get up to 4 hours, fantastic.
---
Not necessarily Vanilla clients fault but, RuneLite makes things easier &amp; faster for me, and more importantly the data it retains is crucial (xp rates and drop tables etc). I prefer playing OSRS RuneLite edition more than I enjoyed playing Runescape in 2007.
---
You know what they say
---
I feel like id guess higher into the 200m range just by the fact that some pretty commonly owned items or sets are 100m+
---
1900 total, 500m
---
If you ignore what's actually in the quest, which no one does. That isn't my logic at all, as that quest requires much more than 25 range. You're trying to twist my words but you're just wrong. My logic is that it doesn't matter if a higher diary requires less quests than a former one, as it requires that diary anyway. Don't be dumb.
---
I use arch
---
Five hours later, it's the top comic. You did it, u/NoHetro!
---
A third of the tbow was his if they had sold it. This wasn't even a 1b scam, only 660m. This creature literally destroyed his entire online presence (including his OSRS account) for what amounts to $300. Hard to even comprehend how it thought that was worth $300. He can't even PVM/boss with other players now without grinding out or buying a new main.
---
wait I thought it just auto sold on GE. Why would they not do it like that?
---
I'm so proud of this community.
---
Make it for WC plz, fuck the "devaluing achievements". I need something that makes the 99 WC i got valuable and not a waste of time
---
So still the best use of Shards if you want to make money, other than potions? No question that divine super combats are the best thing to do with shards, but very few people have 97 herblore.
---
So we can use runelite?
---
No it's not outrageously bad. The abuse of PvP doesn't even compare to the abuse of PvM and skilling.
---
i was using the 3rd party clients...  i switched over and now i got myself 2 def.. Fuck this is what i get for stopping to use the clients ..
---
Not rare enough to do the math on it
---
Jagex‚Äôs GE price is rarely accurate anyway. The coin share system didn‚Äôt require a counter party to buy the item, it just sold it and put GP in the game.
---
I think Joon the King has a YT Video on it that‚Äôs a good explainer.
---
26k accounts have that. Pretty significant amount.
---
Yea it's very possible. Hopefully I'll get enough votes to figure it out with reasonable certainty.
---
Sorry dude, This is definitely a problem Jagex needs to fix.
---
GG
---
One of the main things that got removed from wow was the client knowing where every individual player was at any given time. This meant that people could write add-ons that could tell every member of a raid exactly where to stand to completely negate certain mechanics.
---
Just say, you want to have a family but don‚Äôt want to put gaming at a lower priority.
---
At this point of time, if family commitment is more preferred than gaming in terms of life fulfilment. Just let go of the game slowly. Unless you wanna be super man and take on everything
---
So youre blaming the non-pvp community for jagex's sloppy updates?
---
Please, tell me more about how our community is so split and it's all my fault.
---
Upvote and comment to give you attention. I love statistics threads.
---
Sounds like a way to track users with the most wealth and wait for slip ups for personal information that would lead to a phish or hack.
---
They've probably decided that "look up the clue on the wiki" is sufficiently similar that it's not a hill worth dying on.
---
thanks :) will do
---
This reminds me of that youtube video on runescape showcasing that when given the chance, a white guy will steal your shit before anyone else.
---
Enjoy your new unofficial ironman you repulsive creature. That's basically what your account is now.
---
25-50m an hour is not outrageously bad lol
---
Only 100kc but I enjoy it
---
I guess he wanted to try out being a solo ironman.
---
Somehow they don‚Äôt understand this basic concept
---
Maybe if you killed jad like a real man, they would be proud of you
---
Well look at all the casuals in this thread who go outside from time to time. Stop wasting xp!
---
People sent just customizing their UI
---
They're changint inputs and theres some plugins that tell you literally where to stand and what to pray and when to click.
---
Like imagine a puzzle boss that you havr to figure out a maze. Welp the 3rd party plugin will do the maze for you.
---
There's also point 3rd party clients that will literally let you interact with all tabs at once(having inventory pray mage and spec bar all clickable as once)
---
There's some that will auto switch for you too.
---
They're basically glorified bots that you have to click for
---
No overall profit if you only get what other players drop. Player A transfers some items to Player B and that's it. Sure, duel arena remains popular like this but that's much higher risk / it's just gambling. There should be some incentive to go pking. When was the last time you went to kill a monster, or play a minigame, without any hopes of a reward? I've heard barb assault can be fun, but I don't need anything there so why waste time? I could go pking and maybe get a kill, but between us both wasting supplies, and maybe having a 50/50 win rate, I would expect a net loss over time.
---
I said wat because the math doesn't work out and it's a strong statement.
---
300m will never be enough to cover the remainder of your gameplay unless your buyable skills are already maxed.
---
Fuck yeah. Sick repost bubz
---
Prostitution. RuneScape girls don't come cheap. Though I hear the male playing female pack is discounted.
---
Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted you‚Äôre right
---
But... you can still get the diary done before hand... you can do the elite diary diary first and claim the easy reward... then do the easy diary to claim the medium reward... that‚Äôs how the game is designed... i.e. I did karamja medium diary first and still got gloves 1...

I find the wording bad, It's an absolute scum move but wouldn't say it's scamming. At the end of the day it's his drop even if they promised to share drops it's not really a scam. It's a risk you take when raiding or bossing with a team  
---
Incoming downvotes but hey just my opinion
---
Anhthing still in runelite is good to go
---
Sure but this would stop you from ever losing chins if you die in any way and I don't think there is going to be a away to have it only work if that was the case. Frankly many of the places chins are used range from fairly op to incredibly op and I'm not sure it should be even better by stopping you from losing chins in the event that you mess up.
