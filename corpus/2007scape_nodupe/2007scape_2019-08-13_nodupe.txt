Yeah, it's fucked up that OP's 26 and apparently sees nothing funky about chatting online about underaged sex. Should've jetpacked out of this conversation as soon as that headed there. Or sooner.

Two different bosses completely, I’d say galvek is probably harder to learn and get down but you can do it over and over if you mess up. Thing about jad is the grind to actually get to him so you don’t get much time to fight him. However I will say jad is extremely easy once you get a blowpipe, you have 5 seconds in between each attack to be ready for the next one.

The audacity of using the GPU

---
Seriously tho I just came back to rs after over a decade and gpu acceleration in runelite is amazing *chef kiss*
---
You take max cape or range cape
---
Tough lesson, I'm sure you'll get that back in no time. I once tried drop trading inside edgeville bank a long time ago, and as soon as the items started appearing a random guy came over to ask what I was doing. He took half of the noted supplies I dropped, then called me a dumbass and logged. I was so sad, but I was indeed a dumbass.

Imagine spoiling shit to try get karma

To most of us, with login names entirely separate from our display name and email, using email to login would be far less secure.
---
This has literally been going on for a year now. Same guy does it on the same few accounts. 
---
It's been 5 hours since it was posted, either op has already been scammed or he/she knows it's a scam and they're safe. They literally try and do it back to back with this one, like within 10 minutes. 
---
They used to do it with ancestral hat, then ZGS, they're getting cheap. 
---
Also, you will literally never get the arcane. They make sure they have good pid before you get on. You'd have to log on, predict where they're going to drop it and be lucky enough to have better pid.
---
This should've been your first reply. Until this comment, I agreed with everybody else in that what you said implied you thought Jagex should be excused for bad coding practises. Now that I've seen your explanation, I can see what you were going for, but it wasn't obvious and wasn't the first natural interpretation. 
---
Don't blame everybody else for misinterpreting what you wrote. Maybe what you wrote wasn't clear enough, and that's fine. Just clear it up and don't act so defensive.
---
Rumour has it he found a 50 on the ground and since it only took him 5mins he quit youtube after realizing he could be making 600$ an hour scavenging outside
---
Ah I see a fellow balder in chat.
---
Moral of the story.
---
2 factor your account, use a unique email with a unique password that is also 2 factored.
---
Use a bank pin, and use a different unique password for your account.
---
Don't use this game email anywhere else, don't use the password anywhere else (common practice).
---
You never need to change any of this information, as long as it's unique and a strong password. I've not changed my OSRS pass once in 5 years. Keeping the same password is never going to be what gets you hacked.. using the same password in multiple places will.
---
**tl;dr**
---
Use a password manager. Make every password you use unique. Make a separate email just for Runescape and associate your account with that. Use 2 factor authentication in game and on your email (and ideally absolutely everywhere these days). Use a bank pin. You will never get hacked. You do not need to change passwords or pins at all, let alone 10+ times a year.
---
Unless you are an Ironman trying to get bolt racks. You should go for 88% rewards to get more runes as bolt racks are worth very little.
---
There are a number of ways but I found the best was kill two skeletons and 1 blood worm... this gets you about 86% so you get very close to the max runes with out losing money from getting bolt racks.
---
RNG decent
---
You could do both. Afk Barb fish or other things while playing your main.
---
You just summed up all pvp games lol
---
this is really bad logic, using a charged scythe on something like gargoyles makes about as much sense as using a tent whip

Ohhh I did not know that it was an item. Thank you !

Noobtube69420 is my name welcome back
---
Ohhh ok. Thank you for the help!
---
Not as much as you think.
---
Most people stake expensive single items, not 100k magic longbows.
---
People just wouldn't use it, since the large single items couldn't be staked.
---
If you stake loads of smaller value items, you might aswell stake platinum tokens or GP.
---
Catch 22
---
they added a tax of 10% to each stake and they wouldn't be able to take a percentage out of items so it's cash only now
---
"no"
---
Yeah no. I know that's the case just a little odd is all.
---
But the games been back for like 6 years....
---
Runecrafting isn't explicitly crafting runes, as dumb as that sounds.
---
There are multiple examples that runecrafting is imbuing or manipulating energy. There are at least 19 different in-game examples of using runecrafting to imbuing energy into objects that aren't runes.
---
Granted that most of the runecrafting skill guide is 15 non-combination runes and 5 combination runes (and the ability to produce multiples of those runes), runecrafting is almost half imbuing non-rune objects.
---
There's no lore-reason that we can't make magical fabric with runecrafting when our character has already made magical objects like the Lunar staff and imbued wand on runecrafting altars.

It shouldn't be too hard to just let some populat accounts have whitelists to who can attempt to log in to the account.

Or let everyone make whitelists, to increase account security.

---
What is going on in the picture?
---
Obviously it depends on the balance. It would probably depend on exactly how much vis/bonus materials you get out of. And the idea is not necessarily to sink items arbitrarily, but to guarantee a price floor without increasing the gold supply.
---
Paying that sweet cash to make some magic stones

---
I see phone picture I upvote. Even if it’s not a meme. I just like seeing people complain about the lack of print screen usage.

That would probably just make people stake items with inaccurate ge prices

Thank you so much for the insightful answer.

I did them today with lvl 92 ranged, bp, rigour, ranging pot, anguish and assembler and missed 2 times out of 6. I have also missed it with dragon darts. If that's not good enough then idk.

Could the Lumbridge diary reward ring be changed slightly, so instead of “functions” its options are restore energy and alch, since all this menu really does is make the ring unusable in combat
---
It is due to how it functions. Much like how cutscenes work there is always 1 npc in the cutscene that takes the place of the player. In this case youre just able to go wherever you want without bounds. Allowing it full access to all players at once would definitely cause some problems
---
I’m not sure what that is, but Keldagrim has the blast furnace minigame which is the fastest method of smelting bars in the game
---
Rs2 didnt come out in 2007. Just because osrs is based on a 2007 patch doesnt mean the game was made in 2007.

Hell I can’t even get a Fire cape yet :(

What are the teams thoughts on using more outside the box mechanics, or trade-offs to balance future possible PVM rewards? It may be very interesting to have weight reducing/extreme weight combat gear, or even negative prayer bonus. Currently there are not too many trade offs as we have combat styles (whip &amp; spears), degrading (barrows &amp; crystal), and ancients autocast (ancient staff vs water battlestaff)

I would suggest obsidian armor. It looks awesome and is really good for training =)
---
The way they code the game is a scripting language (this is smart on their end as this means if something bugs out it doesn't crash the world it's on and can be fixed without restarting the world), scripting languages only are able to execute commands that were defined by a programming language hence the game engine. This means that there is no hooks/ways to define what that arm needs to do other than what has been previously made possible. Completely new content that uses old mechanics (look at Volcanic mine) are easier than this because that wouldn't require anything past scripting as all the components to make Volcanic mine were already available where tagging animations to a slot that previously didn't have animation tagging would require editing the system they use for animation which is engine work.

How many times has zulrah been killed since release? Do you have any other interesting statistics about zulrah (i.e. highest number of total kills across all worlds in one day, average number of daily kills, etc?)

Blast furnace/blast mining, wc wilderness ents with medium diary and 75 wc(500k/h)

Charge air orbs(magic exp and money )

I literally can't do zulrah and I have no incentive to learn it when I could just do vork instead. If zulrah was still comparable money, I'd probably like how interactive it is over just staring at the screen waiting for a purple or white ball to come towards me or green going everywhere. I got the one kill for the diary but for how difficult, and honestly fun if you know how to kill h(er?), it is, the average kill is down to like 114k according to the wiki

Was about to flame and make fun of you for how me and all my friends have infernal capes till I saw that you did it on mobile lmao gz my man

That's another thing, it's been so long since I've done MEP2 and I didn't want to do any research, but the reqs I don't remember being anything too crazy. Some quest needs to have a crazy req like DS2's mining or something like that, and zulrah needs to be behind that. The only problem I can see is that the only content that makes sense to gate zulrah behind has low reqs already However, I'm 100% okay with arbitrarily adding something to slow down bots. Normal players should be okay as they actually make progress in general and not to just unlock money snake and then farm the shit out of it

Jagex is being lazy by not attempting to solve it, putting the burden on the user instead of themselves - disgusting.
---
What solutions have they offered thus far?
---
The goal should be to disincentivize the attack without requiring a permanent change to the way a user interacts with the game. If there's a workaround then why waste resources spamming for no gain?
---
How about this: email the account owner a signed URL that bypasses the block (the URL contains a token from jagex). A user just clicks on the link, enters their credentials and logs in. Jagex servers can verify the token in a signed request without ever making a database call - so it could be done at the edge with extremely low cost (wherever they're doing the blocking now).
---
One weakness I can perceive is email spam. But isn't it a better experience to throttle the workaround email instead of blocking a user? Allow one email per hour, and expire the link after one hour. Solved?
---
I was just making sure he knew this wasn’t some new thing haha, and yeah it’s just a game who really cares about luring noobs lol
---
Hahaha even better!
---
Happens all the time and Jagex stroke their cocks saying they're confident in their system, when I've been falsely banned twice on the same account for them to be both reversed
---
Fucking hate helmies, kill them all
---
Okay, people. Before you downvote him just consider that thats what he wants
---
In a normal or gaussian probability distribution, small differences in probability is negligible. But in this case, we know that it isn't a normal distribution, but a discrete probability mass function one point out of 381 for a chance to be a drop of the item and the other 380 points having uniform distribution for a chance to not be a drop of the item. Imagine this distribution as a discrete histogram, whereas the normal distribution as a continuous function that looks like a bell.
---
I think it's just a certain point in regicide. Either way, just buy some scrolls when you get to that point and it's farming time
---
Basically lol. This is why integrity is a thing.
---
They froze his account recently, this was maybe a year ago plus. I'm not in the business of lying for zero gain. Either he was scamming, someone else had access to his account, or he was trolling. None seem very likely. It was simply a warning on the off chance someone had been getting away with scamming.
---
It's probably mostly just due to audience size. If hundreds of thousands of people know you, statistically that number will include lots of assholes and a probably even a few thundercunts.

^ Lowkey me at Jad :(
---
And it locked me out on a different IP, your point?
---
I would say not safe. He hit me really hard when I had 65 defence in rune. If you want a rune helm, I would recommend seeing if you can kill Ogress Shaman in Corsair Cove with protect from magic on, they drop med and full helms occasionally.
---

---
You can plant a crystal weapon seed?
---
They’re fucking w you, it’s a meme you don’t have to talk to him
---
You could switch out blessed dhide coif and legs for verac pieces - it's how I did my first Jad at 77 range/70 defence.  
---
It would allow you to keep using blowpipe without spending spaces on shield/crossbow
---
I said *IF* he refuses. Reading comprehension goes a long way. Also thats not hypotethical, the exact same thing happened to zezima and that was the solution offered. But sure, keep crying about things you know nothing of.
---
LMAO BRUH SO IM JUST THAT UNLUCKY
---
I agree it does make it not all him, but tbh waiting for him to manually find hundreds of lucky imps would be terrible. It would take soooo long for him to find them. Also, this makes it a community effort. The jackpot is from donations, not from his rich main or something. I don't know about the 5m bonus, but tbh 5m is not that much for someone late game. I expect that is also taken from donations as well. Overall I think community &gt; purity on this one.
---
No, but my phone autocorrects "osts" to "osrs"
---
You could always take some d darts with you for jad
---
That's what I was referring to. I did that same shit man. I remember convincing my friend that I had *over 1m*. I was the coolest kid at my public library.
---
There was (is?) also a lot of poorly made private servers where cheat engine actually changes what's server-side since there wasn't validation.
---
I went a made a drop party train at ge to get ppl to gz me for the cape. Then logged after lol
---
Try lactose free milk
---
I guess. You may have missed it though it’s super unlikely you go 1800 dry on a 1/250 drop

But that's the boomer uncle, and the title says "your cool new" which implies good things
---
Reminds me of clap traps birthday
---
Who the fuck plays this game with friends
---
btw
---
Time to flip the raw mats I've been hoarding.
---
Fair point.  Off the top of my head I'd agree with Corp, reaching zuk (not necessarily finishing it to separate it from the inferno cape), insuring a pet, something to do with Hunter (maybe catching a siren with aerial Hunter), finishing off corrupted gauntlet, performing a music cape emote.  I'm not particularly tied to any of these, just random ideas.
---
But you're probably right about it not having enough content to justify, borderline max cape isn't really something that is interesting (though, you could always boost for certain tasks).
---
Yea it probably is too cheap, for me, i would goof alot and have to log back in so it costed me alot more, but thats true. Also, if its not for nmz, people just do bandits or ape atoll.
---
Would it be possible on clue scrolls to add a message or something to let us know if we have set up a STASH unit for that particular step, as for some players it's very hard to remember which STASH units have been set up or not.  Something like a little tick next to the word STASH at the bottom of the clue when you open it.
---
You dont
---
Iirc it was skylar508 who created it?
---
This is the advice I need. I'm hitting 12 consistently chaos and air runes (including fire staff) but I hit 15 with death runes
---
Xp rates are worse for both of those and it's less afk, also bandits makes guthans actually used again
---
Can we talk about tidying up the legend quest tunnel after completion? Digging beneath the dragon's eye is a very common master clue step and takes far longer to complete than any of the others. If a shortcut to the location would be considered too far could the path itself get some QoL?
---
Some possible improvements:
---
-After quest completion please remove or shorten the chat boxes as there are quite a few that serve little purpose. There are currently ones for: the rock at the entrance, the bookshelf, the ancient gate for thieving, the ancient gate for strength, the marked wall, the rope, and all six of the rocks along the dangerous path.
---
-Don't put the three rocks from the mining bit in our inventory please.
---
-Why do we need to search for the rope before using it? we aren't required to bring a new one anyways so it just adds time.
---
If anyone has stuff to add let me know. :)
---
O.o.
---
Fuck, if you can do this on mobile you can do Inferno, report back.
---
Only 1 patch for Crystal Trees compared to 6 patches for regular Trees, so even though Crystal Trees grow faster, you plant so many more regular Trees per day. Similar reason for why Palm Trees are so much cheaper than Magics, although with growth time rather than number of patches.
---
It’s not bad I did it at 40’s in melee stats and defense with full rune/rune scim only used like 6 karambwans/sharks
---
lost landssssass 🦖

People do this all the time so ye why not

---
Correct sir
---
You guys talked a while ago about upping the slayer experience you get from Sire considering how long it takes to kill the respiratory systems. Is this still something we can do? The experience feels so low compared to how long it takes to kill.  
---
Also, grotesque guardians are super low gp per hour compared to most other bosses.  I think a drop table buff would be great to bring them back into line with similar content.  At this point they're pretty much on par with their normal counterparts, making it little more than a pet hunt
---
Probably not as great as getting paid 1b to let Settled catch it.
---
Only people having this issue are big names and streamers. Your average player wont be affected by this
---
Nice job
---
they are. if you are impatient enough to instabuy at 1b then you're -200iq
---
I used to love being able to copy and paste radio stations into the client function. Good times. That's when d chain was the meta.
---
All of tumblr migrated to twitter
---
There's also a runelite devoloper mode feature that is basically the same thing. Not sure what it's called if you do get dev mode on, but it's worth a Google
---
I got 99 hp and one guy showed up, we just danced for a bit at durl arena for like 5 mins before getting back to our respective grinds.
---
Runelite does not provide transaction data
---
Lmao yep. Back in the day it was necessary as a CPU would melt if you had two programs running
---
But most elite diaries have a 91-95 skill requirement already. Desert is fletching, kourend is slayer, ardy is 94 mage, most of the others have early 90s. I'm just saying there's very few skills with enough content around 95+ to pad a new diary with. 
---
Amethyst is only 92 mining for example. What makes that a master task but killing thermy at 93 slayer is only elite?
---
What a cancerous set of replies. He just is getting targeted by multiple (hundred) hacker (bot) attempts. It's not exactly hard to try and brute force his account into being locked since his login username is Sparc Mac and not a random email address.

I was gonna ask how you level up woodcutting inside a building, staring at cake.
---
You can walk through people. Your friend's aren't coming.
---
I'm fully aware I said probably not at max
---
With our whole 128mb of ram hahahah
---
Yeah, with that attitude.
---
We don't have any rules regarding irons. It's up to the discretion of whoever you raid with as to whether or not they're cool with it.
---
Wtf is Oculus orb
---
Yeah, i know i should be using defensive, im just super impatient for 94 mage. No particular reason. Ill probably start doing defensive next burst task
---
"cool new" is irony. And boomers grew up in another enviroment that wasent filled with SJW's, raging feminists and peoples pretending to be attack helicopters. So they would find this thing pretty odd. Therefor the statement "what is this THING" like its not even human.

This game was made in 2001 and only one guy on the planet even understands the code anymore.

I appreciate it but it would be a waste, I can afford membership I just don't wanna waste money when I don't have the time to play. I made sure to hit 10m in the bank to get a bond when I'm ready.

Hate that sub, it's just generic porn with runescape in the background, fetish stuff like Zanik, or some ungodly plastic looking SFM type pictures

why you hef to be med

Unfortunately not, my guy. Hope you didn't lose too much.
---
Hope your stack wasn't too huge. Pretty sure dying in an instance is bye-bye to those items.
---
It's not so bad with the newer nerfs to tb now though.
---
There's an invisible +64 defense bonus for every style on every monster (because of the way defense is calculated). The defense is multiplicative of Defense level and Defense bonus, so even with 0 defense bonus on the stat screen, lowering the defense level is still useful. 
---
Additionally, the meta method of doing maiden is just 1 spec from each person at the start, one more claw spec doesn't add that much damage compared to 1 claw + 1 chally + 1 dwh
---
Im so pissed... 35m gone for no fucking reason.
---
Fuck yeah
---
Nope ya done fucked up son
---
More legit, cut the EHP estimate by like 70% since he's going to be stabbing away at 0 EHP for a long time at GWD, Zulrah, Shamans, Gorillas (the last two are like 0.3 EHP with the money earned but still) and because so many ironman EHP methods are literally half or worse until significant unlocks.
---
Tldr, for early game especially it estimates 450 hours it's probably closer to 1200.  There are about 300 hours' pvm content minimum in there just for "good gear" that don't even include lategame slayer or raids.
---
Heres a top tier tip for jad; watch his back left foot. If it comes off the ground, its a range attack. If it doesn't, its mage. Lets you know a about a tick earlier than watching his front feet.

Habla mucho ingles. Habla "Fucking bean eater." Habla "Slippery little mexican." Habla "Little piece of shit"

When? lmao, don\`t now what to say.. been there for 3 weeks and the experience has been completely different than yours...
---
You probably bought it with bonds anyway.  Im sure you'll buy some more
---
It offered me no answers
---
Rune cbow, with Ruby and diamond bolts e is best for had, and blowpipe for healers.
---
Make that bitch a ring so we can fight drunk
---
lmao did 30k of this. i dont think im going back
---
Genuinely curious: where is he getting this money from? Last I recall, his main UIM was worth a few hundred mil, maybe 1b. I can't imagine that he's made that much money since maxing that he's okay with liquidating like 1.5b off an ironman account to fund this grind. Does anybody know if he explains where the money comes from? Verf too.
---
Ok so now you will have to basically recover the account. Go to the support section about changing email address. It will have you enter a new email address and a bunch of other info so hope you know a lot about your account.
---
respect that
---
That’s unlucky, I have my connected emails so never had that issue, sounds like you might not have enough info to recover though although the phone really should be close to enough
---
Your opinion is that being varied makes an "objectively better" game than one where pvm is king.
---
Plenty of clients still use usernames. It’s no excuse to allow shit like this to happen because “we allowed an alternative that’s easier for us”
---
Nice bro
---
Taking me back man... the glory days
---
I didn’t, but whats the point of being shitty? I was just hoping to find a way to get it back, there really isn’t a reason to attack me for asking a question.
---
Lmao it's gone dumb ass. Get over it
---
Maybe for some people. I play plenty of pvp games because I enjoy the competition and challenge. If I did it for a reaction I’d use the chat to talk shit more which I don’t.
---
True. It’s possible but with the loot pile not visible I’m inclined to believe otherwise.
---
CONGRATS MY BRO!! 🎉🎉
---
99 mag yesterday btw :) i wanna tell every1
---
What’s your macro program or AHK
---
Lame, find a better hobby than trolling on reddit.
---
Cancer but if u do em use a trident
---
Glad u lost ur 35m lmao. What a degenerate.
---
"Slayer"
---
You could get it for free but no methods worth the grind with current stats!
---
I still live with that fear in me, I almost wish the game was still like that. Seeing someone die was actually exciting.
---
you got it man!
---
Well it's either that or don't play the game
---
You are entirely wrong about recoil usage. Maiden is a 0 damage room if you're not designated tank (which he wont be). And so it bloat, assuming a competent team. But even in the event of fly damage, it would not use recoil charges. The recoil would be entirely used at nylo. Please refrain from commenting on shit you know nothing about. I guarantee you have 0 tob kc.
---
I eat bronze dragons for bfast after 85 atk with melee.  
---
Not sure about iron dragons, haven't gotten them in awhile.
---
Reminds me back in '10 when I got 99 WC. I invited all my RS friends and they said they'd be there when it happens.. only one dude showed up and left before I got it :\[
---
In his discord, people are donating. Every time someone does he posts the amount, and who did it. Now that it hit 1b they aren't going to keep adding to the bounty, but instead raise it to 5m every lucky imp you tell him about, as opposed to the 3m each now. The bounty started at 50m from swampman himself tho
---
Ok thanks for the info!
---
Cause you were Mr Rogers in that situation lol
---
If they offer something like a free ironman account this won't be a problem.
---
So why are they disliking? looks like they are pretty offended.
---
I was standing next to him praying melee because i don't want him to use his breath, because you can't fully protect breaths. How do i not use pray pots?
---
&lt;3
---
Mad lad
---
Get up, come on get down with the quickness
---
Not in front of the DS aye? Looks great
---
Oh my god lmao, this was word for word. Haha thanks you guys are awesome. He knows I have tbow since I think he spotted me at inferno bank, he kept saying same shit like doing tob and cox. Gonna delete him thanks lads!
---
Anti dragon shield, extended antifire potion while ranging
---
Gotta use prayer while meleeing though
---
*Excuuse* me? Don't you mean *person*cott the quest?
---
You just got unlucky with a few drops. It’s not going to be some breakthrough money making method but you will profit if you stick with it.
---
The work of learning zulrah and the uniques that come from it (BiS non slayer melee helm, bp) all should make zulrah comparable to those. I understand it has less requirements, but that's why we're saying add more reqs
---
Yup, gave it a read. Thank you so much. It's probably the same dude, word for word story.
---
What imp type?
---
Zalcano, barrows, vorkath. All are better money. 
---
I've heard pickpocketing elves is 2m or more an hour but don't know for sure. 
---
Blast furnace is almost as much as zulrah. 
---
1mil per hour is pretty bad for the task being zulrah.
---
But you can upgrade to the maximum portal nexus at 84 so don’t worry
---
Could be ironic wording. Pretty difficult to misinterpret the literal troll though.
---
You must be a riot at parties.
---
+1
---
You have never done KBD have you?  
---
antifire doesn't protect freeze, poison and shock breaths.
---
Idk I rather have 1bil than a video that won’t be remembered
---
You’d remember it though 😂
---
Kill green dragons
---
If that's true thats a sick deal lmao
---
I assume you used downstairs?
---
Video no one except you will remember in a month of $1,000... Hmmm
---
Haha! I was wonder if you’d come across this!
---
Glad I checked the comments so I can downvote, ahyahhahyahhaha WOW!
---
If it's any consolation, I've seen a post of a guy who did 50-99 fm and didn't get a single torch. So guess where your luck went :S
---
Doing everything on mobile, started playing at release date, 110 combat and 1758 total
---
Customisable right click button for mobile? I'd much rather 3d touch or 2 finger tap than press and hold while the npc walks away.
---
Meanwhile im getting so fking triggered by the frame stutters. 
---
400kc no shard btw
---
was thinking about fletching also
---
Now it makes sense why construction is one of the best methods to train prayer.
---
bro u gonna get banned
---
99 farming in a month? Tell me your secrets
---
Varrock diary tasks. If you don't know what that is, Google or watch a YouTube vid. It's a passive money maker
---
Pro tip, keep some savings in nmz and lms coffers so you have a backup in case something like this happens
---
Also the fact that verf is the one who chose to stream it lol. That's like if you got mad that endgame was spoiled for you because you were waiting for it to come out on DVD.
---
I got back into osrs, have no friends who play anymore. I got 99 farming today, purposely hopped world's till I found 1 guy at the herb patch. He followed me to get my cape. Thank you kind stranger.
---
Hello,
---
Just hope this post gets thousands of upvotes, or you're fucked. That is Jagnex for u!
---
No one is trying to brute force. This is an issue with jagex and it is IP related. Maybe you should check out the forums. Not everyone uses twitter
---
Can mr meeseeks do my runecrafting
---
Fury has to be his best in slot for inferno. His account is gonna look so god damn swaggy with an ornamental fury and infernal cape lol
---
As a uim I can say that’s not a thing thankfully lol
---
I'm not a real man. what is swiftkit and how did it work? is it the OG runelite?
---
They catch those by intervals, not mouse position. Loads of people, myself included use mousekeys to spam click, which is totally legal. Some people even tape the bottom of their mouse to make sure it doesn't move, which is also ok.
---
Does that grave have the Warding icon on it?
---
Beautiful animation btw.
---
You really don't take that much damage.  It's not really worth it.
---
Also  10 bolts per kill? You use .2 bolts per attack so you're averaging 5 damage per shot? Yikes
---
Let's make a reddit post of every game tick in the game
---
I actually just got back into osrs and spent a little under two weeks afking sand crabs while I was at work LOL. Mobile is really handy for this.
---
(When I could actually play I've been questing and other things, but afking to level up and clear more content)

i used to give my classmate 100k-500k to do my homework back in 7th grade lol rwt isn't always a bad thing

You are comparing with BiS gear and max level meanwhile it's my 4th trip i haven't even learn how to flick eagle eye yet. Calm down.
---
I know the Abyssal Sire has been out for a long time now, but I think something that would be way more enjoyable is to remove the negated damage when going into part 2 and 3 of the kill. It just seems like an old mechanic to extend the boss fight and sometimes even waste a hit just to hit nothing and send the boss to the next stage.  Could this be looked at as some form of QOL to a boss that not many people do now a day?
---
\&gt;gender fluid

Big YIKES!

smited for karambit black pearl ez scrub

Back before Clan Chat and everyone would use IRC
---
I just don't understand. Take the 5 seconds extra and make a screenshot.
---
and why would i bring a 120M weapon to kill a year 2004 boss to get mediocre loot?  
---
You may think it's safe, i'm thinking it's a huge potential to get skull tricked.
---
This is interesting, but it's kind of useless unless you're doing some rendi shit
---
"genderfluid" just means "not being tied down by 70 year old, massively archaec ideas of gender roles". In other words, a woman wearing pants or a man not beating his wife.
---
maybe old info or something scythe related then? dunno, lemme ask.
---
Personally not sure if there is a workaround with Jagex. But most companies do that when you get grandfathered into a rate, so that as soon as you update your payment method or anything minor related to your subscription it renews into the current plan
---
What is the current best method to do barrows for collection log? As in route, gear, when to tele for spec etc. Gear, profit and stats are no issue.

You sound like such a positive carer OP, i'm sure she enjoyed her time with you, I only wish you had more of that time
---
thats the power of osrs
---
im pretty sure you should aim for 88% every single time for best drop rates. That said i just finished 10k barrows chest and ive had this happen multiple times, or 2k and 300mind runes which is equally bad. Good thing i got 14 karil tops and a decent amount of ahrims top and bottom to make up for crap like that. Also i know it speak for itdelf but never do barrowd before you have the additional rune reward from the hard diary. 10k chests netted me 112mil only from runes
---
I try to do this every time I’m wildy slaying.  Every now and then they think it’s a laugh and leave me alone, so it’s worth it IMO lol
---
I imagine there are probably 3 generations of osrs players now.
---
We do raids discord also has a really good and in depth guide in the #inferno section
---
No, what am i supposed to be using?
---
As much is I want to play devil's advocate and argue otherwise, you're absolutely right. Generally the 1:1 rule was just made so people stop asking stupid questions about their broken AHK script that they're trying to make not trigger bot detection while being as OP as possible. Usually it's safe to say anything in a popular unofficial client won't get you banned before it's removed.
---
EXCEPT that jagex has even explicitly said that even something like osbuddys mousekeys plugin was not allowed. It pretty much guaranteed won't get you autobanned, but they still maintain the position that it's against the rules and anything could happen.
---
Is this really how you see the world?
---
I submitted a bug report for that over a week ago. Reddit more effective than in game bug report confirmed.

Hey man soz I dropped all of that by mistake, can you trade it back to me?

I died :) that was me :)

Do the Knights sword quest and get your smithing up. After this, get a coal bag from Motherlode mining and hit up the blast furnace.

You're wrong, imo

Well done on 5 fletching

1/6543652 odds of this happening, gz man

Do people like that actually exist? I've never seen gender fluid people irl and if i would id just think theyre mentally ill or something. Seems like people in the u.s only have to deal with this
---
What is a decent meal to u, when I go once a month i get 2-3 big macs and 3-4 cheeseburgers, that's like a million dollars

I added the wiki to my search options so when I type "wiki" in front of something  it'll automatically search on the osrs wiki instead of using regular old google. For example if I type "wiki gargoyle" it'll automatically search the osrs wiki for the gargoyle page

APPEARING OFFLINE DOES NOT FUCKING STOP IT, SO STOP GIVING ADVICE YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT!
---
Nice! What office do you work at?
---
I wouldn’t want to know. I’ll never check my in game play time. It’s depressing.
---
you cant kill any boss 4 times and EXPECT profit, rng exists. KBD had decent drops worth 200k+. you didnt get those drops in your 4 kills. its pretty simple. you can kill vorkath and zulrah 4 times and potentially walk away with &lt;100k in loot just the same.
---
Wait, what?
---
I bet you’re fun at parties
---
*You're

Always high haha
---
Can we put pies together like pizzas?

You and your brother did this but it was your sister who whispered some guy to stop trying to get the 10k? Yeah ok dude I totally believe this story /s
---
You need to get laid my man, that's all I have to say
---
Deathtouched dart.. you can buy it for 5m in eoc i just looked it up it really isn’t a challenging game no more.
---
I remember when those darts came out, you could only have like 3 of them per account and it was discontinued
---
Its cos ur standing still too long mate, u wont see it cos of all the scions but the pool of poison will be beneath u in the final stage it just doesnt always show due to graphics, and that thing takes rapid HP off.
---
Regardless of 45 defence, if u keep moving and pray range in final phase the boss is more than doable.
---
Just walk away and let mother Nieve do all the work

yeah bro, 1 year in remission!

Also, I’ve dropped a clue I got from barb fishing accidentally and it vanished. Is this normal?

I think that's a fair stance to take. I see what you mean. But it's not something I'm personally interested in. I can be, and am, part of the community in other ways.
---
I'm sure I sound like a lot of things ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I agree

ok sorry

you are so correct. We are just a pawn in their sick game.

No? Just no.

Congrats! We're proud of you
---
Can we make poll questions a minimum of 3 days? The Elena chat head poll was only up for 1 day and many players didn't have a chance to vote due to the short time frame. 3 days minimum I think would insure that a larger sample size of players get to vote before the end of a poll.
---
Say that to my upvotes. Sit pussy
---
\+ seems like the majority of the people dont understand how to keep their account even remotely safe in the first place

Coach: I can’t do it it’s been too long every second coaching is like living torture! Wait, I know how I can take all the minutes off his inferno attempt, when I kill him!
---
Chambers of Xerics and Theater of Blood can both make 2-3x+ what you can make at Vorkath (in efficient teams at least).
---
And you do realize people who actually study gender claim that there are more than 2 genders? Science is not on your side buddy
---
Hm you are correct tho.
---
Fantastic work
---
When I got the pet, literally the same moment two white dots popped up on my minimap, I panicked and ran down to tele out. Later I realised they were not pk’ers, just other bear killers. Nonetheless still one of the scariest moments ever.
---
I’ll post an update at 90kc mate
---
Ugh Pray range during the last bit and move north to south after each attack so your not standing o pools too long, also are you doing the hammer and pool method of reducing its defence? If you are it should die in like 3 hits on the last phase
---
Can we get auto pray switching too
---
$7 USD lol
---
F2p or members?
---
Yea that limit is practically gone now. The old limit didn't lock you out of the game for more than 5 minutes.
---
I guess I’m not a real man...
---
No pets for buyables
---
y :(
---
The gauntlet I think has really fast elite drops, like maybe 1/25? 10 minutes per run
---
CL4p-TP, is that you?
---
It will not pass because idiots like you vote no because you already have 99 rc.
---
You equip NMZ? Which slot does it go into?
---
i hope jagex doesn't nerf that like Blizzard nerfed Jaina https://i.imgur.com/z8gRoY7.jpg . i still think this was stupid graphical change.
---
Pets don't have an intrinsic monetary value, and they shouldn't.
---
Not nice
---
I hate wildy bosses because you could've gotten pick at KBD. None the less, the cub is crazy
---
I could play out of Rostov without issues
---
But I want one :(
---
it would be if it was balanced, but the same clan is there 24/7 and it defeats the purpose of total level worlds for that activity unless you chose to pay them. they don't own the total level world so it shouldn't be so easy for them to lock you out of that activity on it.
---
Gender and sex are identical. They are synonymous. Only people with an agenda or are biased claim otherwise. Science is on my side. Wacky clown logic is not on my side, which I'm 100% okay with.
---
Then grind out a different skill or boss. I wanted a kbd pet so I killed 500 a day until I got it my dude
---
I've gotten 1 elite in 95 kc. Wouldn't recommend
---
Herb and Birdhouse runs are your best bet for cash atm. In your downtime, try to do some slayer and quests (Both work great with herb/birdhouse runs, just pop out every few tasks/quests and knock out your runs then back to the grind). Once you get higher stats, much better moneymakers become available to you.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For some comparison, your top tier moneymaker right now is probably around 1m/h if you went hard grinding mobs (Barrows would probably be your best bet, maybe Zulrah if you have 75+ range/mage). Herb/Birdhouse runs are somewhere in the ballpark of 3m/h if you just count the time actually doing them (and not the downtime while waiting for them to grow/fill). Vorkath/Zulrah can peak around 3m/h. CoX can hit \~7m/h. ToB can hit 10m+/h. There's nothing you can grind money for right now that would save you more time leveling than it took to grind for, so yeah. Just make it through the mid levels with welfare gear, then worry about making money to upgrade your gear and get some buyables when you can do real moneymaking methods. Herb/birdhouse runs will make you enough for your day-to-day expenses in the mean time.
---
What? No, not at all. You need Fossil Island done, and maybe a few k to make some digsite pendants and get some cheap seeds to throw into the birdhouses, and ofc buy a few logs for the birdhouses themselves (Or  buy pre-built birdhouses) but there aren't any big expenses if you do it a couple runs at a time and don't like stock up for 99 hunter via birdhouses.
---
I mean, if you really want to do barrows then go for it... I just really wouldn't recommend wasting your time making 1m/h when you can make 10x that later. Herb and birdhouse runs will buy you everything you need until the late/end game, so my recommendation would be just working your way through the mid game with welfare gear and focusing on making money when you have better options available.
---
I remember people thought this was a cheat client, imagine if we could take Runelite back in time

I'm just gonna cut out the middle man.

Trading Rune Cross Bow for Twisted Bow, DM for details.

We all have friends my dude, I’m right here.

Holy fuck. 17 pets?

Thank you for your service, maybe? Honestly just guessing.

Assuming 1/300 drop rate approx. this puts each lucky impling expected value at 3.33 mil!

Isn't a torso a downgrade from bcp?
---
Buying gp cmon man... Both of you can't speak english (ban youre account) + are "dumb cunts" imo.

---
1-98 so far in 8 days and less than 7 hours from 99. Yeah I hope not but don't think so.
---
A N8GGUH
---
rather use trident then, its really decent dps. way better than rcb
---
Aw man, that's proper hit me in the feels. Congrats on 99 WC though, invite me to your next party. I'll bring the beers.
---
Defensive stats yes. 
---
But str bonus is same. Torso is free and bcp is ~20m?
---
Not that I'm endorsing that behavior at all, but it was likely more self-serving than people being dicks for the sake of being dicks.  I don't know the rate at which Lucky Imps are being found, but anyone with access to all those call-outs could make bank.
---
Vorkath for 1/65 chance. Quick money too
---
Nice. Halfway to 99
---
99% of those cases have been because they have botted elsewhere too. I autoclick every time I need to alch something over like 50 alchs never randomised either so would be super easy to detect. Have done it since 2008 probably over 300k alchs
---
at this point it would be kinda unfair for non maxed players to remove it. i see maxed combat stats anywhere, i'd be pissed if i now had to train it "manually" while everyone else afk'ed it.
---
Just configure your RuneLite auto-snapshot settings.  Then when something awesome happens that no one will ever believe, you can be like [suck it, nerds](https://imgur.com/QaipPVg)
---
I don't enjoy saying this, but since you happened to offer such an invaluable perspective on the situation, I feel like I should inform you that murder is defined as the unjustified and unlawful killing of **another person**, so your opinion is 'technically' false.
---
I really enjoyed dungeoneering. 
---
And I guess you could add that skill without it having to much of an impact on the game.
---
Is that 145 pounds because that's very light for a "lifter"
---
As much as I miss Swiftswitch, I still sometimes use the [SwiftKit](https://imgur.com/gallery/hcnIovU)  app to feel like I still have it in my life
---
That’s deep
---
Thanks for the information.
---
Are you still members? Try making toad crunchies. Is it good money? Idfk
---
You are ignorant.
---
Doing that just moved the problem, it definitely doesn't solve it since the number of logins being attempted is obviously high. They just have to guess the authenticator instead and there needs to be a limit for that as well since it's more statistically likely to guess the authenticator code than it is to guess the password, that's why 2fa always comes after a login for every place that uses it. It's a great back up but not a great password
---
What did it cost?
---
Yeah, I don't keep up with any of this. Dude's insane lol.
---
Not as far as we know. Graceful + varrock armor seems to be the best gear.
---
Almost definitely zhasta is better than elder maul, maul is way too slow to have any decent dps. But training def through bursting is way faster than melee, you might want to consider that instead and just use controlled here
---
That's fucked top
---
Fair point haha, no harm intended. It’s just that people are always going on about how good herbs are and that they’re a good way to offset the cost of trees.
---
I think you're the one who is confused.
---
If you liked it, then it should just stay as a mini game. Nothing in the "skill" of dungeoneering is relatable outside of it.
---
Because at that point you may as well have a castle wars skill and a pest control skill
---
I's vote for that
---
It wasn't all that high poly, the problem is that I wanted to to give the highest texture quality to everything and i did so giving 2k textures to every model. Also the hair and SSS, they took a tool on the workflow speed.
---
I'm planning a new model(a zerker) and I'll animate him so I'm being more careful now
---

I just train in the warrior guild my melee stats and the rune defenders are my main money maker there haha. I get there like ~100k gp in a few hours. Thats why I want to know If a place exists where I can make a bit more Money and still Level up my melee stats. But pure money making methodes are fine too because I still need better gear.

Depends on your level and how many boss tasks you want to do. Fire giants, abby demons, kalphite, hellhounds (unless you're doing cerb), drakes, gargs, suqah, wyrms etc. are all fine to block

Gender and Sex were used synonymous for centuries until the 1980s. Words aren't fixed a bunch of people can start using a word to mean something else. There's no scientific reason to separate gender from sex though it was a societal choice.

Fury is his side grind. He's mostly been going for imps for infernal gear, but has been farming TzHaar for obsidian items to sell for tokkul to buy an onyx. He'll then train crafting for fury
---
There really are too many to list! Almost all of the quests are really good on humour, references or names. A few of my recent favourites were One Small Favour, most of the Desert and Morytania quests, pretty much every quest which involves pirates, Fremennik Isles, and Animal Magnetism.
---
It's a demon boss pet released with Song of the Elves and Prifddinas. Funnily enough yours is the first complaint I've heard about its appearance lol
---
Ok, sure. But that doesn't mean that gender is non existent. If a society begins using words differently than they did in the past, then people adopt the definition. Not say that "oh since gender wasn't used this way in the past, means it shouldn't be used this way now". That is the dumbest thing people can say. Words change definitions

There was an UIM on /r/ironscape bragging about managing to get dragon pick from Calisto recently.
---
so main bridding is a tad difficult at times but honestly its one of the best places to learn. with 90 attack, 99 str, 90 range, and 94 magic as well as rigour and augury, you will never be smited unless you dont pay attention to your prayer and you will be able to nail your specs easily. with 90 def you wont get hit as often either. 
---
for pures and zerks, which a lot of people recommend as beginner accounts, they have no defence, low attack and low prayer. so their specs hit less, they take tons of damage, and get smited much easier. smiting doesnt matter if you dont risk but if you do risk then someone dumping 2 good claw specs into you will smite you. the reason why people recommend pures is because the general skill level of people who play pures, especially unfinished ones, is lower, while max mains have obviously been playing longer. 
---
for edgeville and PVP pking i would go with a zerk or pure for sure, but hybridding is a close call. you can always rag in neitiznot, full salad, red book, rune gloves and water stick and then bring an AGS as your spec wep with your risk being 300k, and even with mystic your risk is still only going to be around 400k. 
---
baby pures like 50 attack maulers and low cb 60 attack accounts risk 300k if smited, or 240k or so with full invent of supplies. but they can be frustrating with all the damage you take. however when fighting other pures its cake and a great place to learn beginner bridding if not fighting a sweaty who has a pure with 500 bh kills. but usually those r the maxed pures.

Normally I would be, but I'm actually not here. I don't need to be fully immersed in the game when I play, but something like this would very blatantly feel like a workaround to a shortcoming on the client's part. It makes you think about how the code runs and breaks the fourth wall in a bad way. There's no realistic reason they could come up with for needing to use an item to make a bouquet of flowers switch hands.
---
Understandable, have a bad day!

Dang that’s a big blog lol. As someone who doesn’t PvP at all, does this update change much for other players?

If anyone has a TL;DR I’d appreciate it

maybe weird but why tier 75? why not make them a little or a lot higher tier? and make hybrid waps end game ?

Everything is on him now. Can't blame Jagex when they person they offered to help declined the help they offered. Why should Jagex bother continue to try and fix something for him if he is going to continue to decline the help that's being offered to him? Idgaf that he's popular.

---
For keeping those so called """content creators""" annoyed, no price is too high.
---
This actually adds a fair bit of content for PvP Players whilst at the same time offering PvMers to unlock decent sounding cosmetic changes. I honestly think this is a well rounded and great sounding update that would be great for the game.
---
....So it probably wont pass.

You won't be able to save pvp by adding incentives, people used to kill each another for the fun of it, if people doesn't find it fun, then it will die out.

They'll write paragraphs about it thinking that they're right, but we all know the truth.

It's physically impossible to be at 5% body fat without extreme measures that'll push you near death. Bodyfat percentage is also difficult to measure and is innaccurate with the best tools. Bodybuilders dehydrating the fuck out of them selves might dip into the 6-8% range but they can't survive like that for long and can pass out and throw up during competitions. They don't walk around like that, they're probably normally closer to 15% during training and only right before competitions do they start fuckin themselves up. So he's absolutely not 5% body fat no matter what he does to cut.

Someone made the point that the bad guys got purple skin, pointing them out as bad guys during earlier quests when the player shouldn't know their intentions. Also they aren't even bad guys just elves with other ideals and goals, which should be what separates them from the other clans,  not some skin color.
---
Cutting is what people that lift call losing weight
---
The idea is you are either "bulking", which is eating more than your Total Daily Expenditure of calories to grow muscles more quickly (more calories/protein -&gt; faster growth), but makes you look a little pudgy. So you'd "cut" when you want to look good and get that more defined look. CC guy is claiming that he's not only super low bodyfat %, but also does it while lifting AND not dieting
---
Some people advocate for the cut/bulk cycle and claim it's more efficient than just eating your Total Daily Expenditure, others think it's unhealthy to adjust your diet up and down like that
---
They disagree with me, therefore they are dumb!
---
all good just hope can ice that cake

Yes a bunch of people who cry on Reddit every week that they're unable to secure a fucking Runescape account themselves, so they need Jagex to hold their hand for them while login in are gonna group together and ""social engineer"" and hack my account as revenge?

100m gets you a really budget gear for Inferno, of course people have done it with budget setups but it makes it alot harder.

I'd say you need alot of patience and nerves. It might take 100 tries so be prepared and dont give up =)
---
Can Lizardman Shamans be updated so they no longer jump if the player is within melee distance?
---
This could make melee viable since ranged is the dominant style here. They already deal damage if you melee them and you'd have to dodge the spawns eitherway.

Did i mention i'm better than any of you because i'm a vegan Ironman? Did i mention i don't torture animals?

Gotta take steps to be a beefy boi, you don't just start there and if he's claiming 5% bodyfat then he's very obviously new to lifting
---
They now changed into 'I give 10% of what you show in one trade' bots.

Noted, thanks a lot! :)

Good. Not as many people will be tempted to do that.

I do not participate in PvP, but I like the idea of Jagex finally doing something about emblem farming.
---
Anyone from the PvP community willing to let me know any potential impact of these changes?

Don't tho.

In fact, I demand climbing be added as a material in crafting so we can finally make climbing boots

Sex and gender are identical.

No, they should provide a proper solution, like giving some players access to making a whitelist of IPs that can attempt to login to the account.

make a new 1 and just see if u can log in

99 Prayer might be worth spending that cash on, from what I know Prayer is a precious resource during inferno and going in with 80 means your pots will be giving ~5 less prayer per dose which puts you at a huge disadvantage

What percentage of nuggets do you get back?

Regardless of whether it’s right or not to the game’s health, passing without polling is unethical.

what are you talking about? all pvp weapons &amp; gear cost fuckall now compared to pvm gear lol
---
Can't propose a change to EHP unless you reveal the method. There's ways to store exp and fake that tracker.
---
Join a pk clan, pvm clans always end up scamming you.

Please lets do more for F2P PK as it is getting better, the addition of Mage equipment; the battlemage. Also addition of corrupted dragon equipment to f2p like before thanks!!!!
---
looks like OP gained 444k str xp over about 58 minutes, so he did about 111000 damage. 
---
5800 game ticks in 58 minutes,  if he's using rapier he gets 1450 attacks, to deal 111k dmg he would need to average a hit of 76.5.
---
so I really don't see how this could be possible, I think it's cashing in pest control points 100 at a time.
---
PvP only weapon
---
They will still be using lol check the blog
---
Disturber
---
Minigames already have rewards. Once something becomes a skill then it will be a quest requirement, and it will impact your total level and max/completion cape if those ever become a thing
---
I loved the concept for Sailing, but I still voted against it because I don't wanna force someone else to train a Skill just because I thought it was cool.
---
If you think the GMaul should be made completely unusable, we're not likely to agree, but I'll explain the thought process. 
---
Because it's a cheap weapon used by lots of players, we wanted to maintain it's viability but at least increase the cost to use it. Locking the spec behind a limited resource item like the attachment described in the blog will make it more expensive to use. Prior to any of the rework changes, it'll sit at a value of at least 500k, based on how much emblems are going for right now. This seems fair for a +1 spec weapon with low requirements, or is at least a step in the right direction.
---
That's what j though but when I downloaded the authenticator  on my new phone osrs is no longer there. When I went to get it set up, it's no longer there. I did the recovery thing they denied. It's literally an email on a dead domain I used I to own.
---
Correct

How is wildy slayer not worthwile? It already gives a shit ton of points.

So sick of this game being Slayerscape.
---
Nice BH rework. its about time
---
please, offer *your* issues with pvp
---
&gt;Why is magic defence being changed in pvp again?
---
again?
---
The points would have to be spend before conversion, like the emblem, yeah. I've added the looting back to the list of items available in the BH shop - we also intend to keep them on the general wilderness drop table.
---
Did not help
---
With attas boost, I presume?
---
That’s why I suggested the main issue being a PJ timer. If it takes 20 seconds for you to be attacked by another pker, that gives you more than enough time to eat up and prepare before another player tries to spec you out. If you are in singles (Callisto, venenatis safespot) you will actually have a chance to get away in singles rather than having 20 max combat mains all claw spec you out
---
I mean look at ags. People aren’t called ags prods for nothing. Spec enough times and you’ll 1 shot people.
---
He said he stopped playing for half a year. Good chance the bank is cleaned too.

With Song of the Elves now released, what's the next big update coming down the pipeline for OSRS?

All these changes make sense from a pvp perspective, but lets be real, the community hates us pkers and wont vote yes to this lol.

Yeah it moved to the correct directory but it said it did not recognize the command afterwards.
---
I would suggest adding the cosmetic stuff to another place, or the Emblem trader for points. This way it wont devalue your emblem since you can pick cash or cosmetic.
---
I just recently started a melee only btw without doing any research of what I’d be able to do. Gotta say playing a snowflake has really made me love the game again.  Just find something interesting and go for it.

You think you are some anime warrior when in reality you're just a runescape nerd trying to defend hate speech.

Why are you being such a snowflake about this, these people literally do not affect your life at all. 
---
Have you asked for a chromosome test from each person that you call a man or a woman? Have you seen all of your coworkers genitals? How do you know what gender they are then? By your standard, you barely know people's sexes, but referring to people by their gender is almost a daily occurrence. Why are you being triggered by a word. You keep saying "the science is on my side bucko" but you are yet to cite anything to defend that point. SURELY there are heaps of evidence since it's OBVIOUSLY the science. You have literally nothing to gain from defending this viewpoint, other than the rush of being edgy.
---
As for the "lol enjoy ur mental illness", transitioning is actually the cure for the mental illness of gender dysphoria,  the distress a person feels due to their birth-assigned sex and gender not matching their gender identity. 
---
Trans people obviously exist, what do you propose we do with them? offer no care or cures that have positive outcomes.
---
\&gt;[After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the GD was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved.](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)

---
Even the word "sex" is a socially constructed concept that describes a grouping of traits, that again, is completely arbitrary, but it seems to give us some value, so might as well use it. 
---
You have a hard on for science even though you clearly lack the scientific bases for your arguments, i guess ben shapiro really got you on the hook. Science is literally there to serve humans, so if we have the opportunity to widen that pool of people we help, with 0 cost, why not? 
---
I'd also like to take your comment and assign it to gay rights, since this is the exact same situation as we are now having with trans people. 
---
\&gt; Marriage was changed due to political correctness. Marriage has always been between a man and a woman. I still follow the old definition and I will not bend the knee just because pink haired F\*\*got says it's now suddenly different. 
---
Please educate yourself
---
I never really got it? Plenty of women like to feel sexy and show off what they've got. Sex has a place in art and we shouldn't be treating video games like they're not. Why can't tracer be proud of her butt lol, plenty of guys run around with their abs and biceps out.
---
I wonder if something like PvP weapons drain 5-10x faster when your target is not retaliating against you might curb their use against pvmers without hampering them in actual PvP vs pvper content?
---
The goal is to make people consider if they wanna risk 500k (1,2m bh points) instead of 30k. Frankly I think the cost should be higher, somewhere 1-2m for using the upgraded maul.
---
I dont pk but this looks exciting and if they go through ill surely be taking it up. Amazing proposals well done mods

&gt; An upgrade for the Saradomin sword. This item would reduce the sword's special attack energy cost to 60% and deal magic based damage.
---
So... This is the Saradomin's Tear, right? Because that exactly describes how the Blessed Sword works, only with a 5% difference in spec cost. If that is now the Sara Tear but a new item, can we just rework the Blessed Sword instead of adding a second upgrade to the Sara Sword? Its only role at the moment is strength training, which kinda is irrelevant since the Bludgeon and such replaced it.
---
Sex is biological. Gender is Psychological/neurological. This IS my element. This is literally what I studied for years. How do you feel that this is YOUR element? What did YOU study for years?

The PvP changes described in the blog are separate to the BH Rework Design
---
The amount of people voting out of spite is probably pretty low, much like how people made a big deal about HLC community using alts to vote no on warding.
---
The problem lies in asking people to vote against their own interests. Pkers are a minority, most people are only in the wild because of pvm or skilling, they aren’t going to vote for things that make dying more probable.
---
Look at how dead
---
Sarachnis, Vorkath, Zulrah, Barrows, Gauntlet if you don't like the Wilderness
---
Didn't you poll this before and have it fail?
---
The way this is worded, it seems like PVP weapons will be non degradeable, is this the case?  So the vls will be the primary spec weapon of choice and KO potential. Will this weapon be pvp only? Also will the new BH hat receive any stats? They could come into play after x amount of kills. Could you implement different tiers of hat for each defence level bracket and offer the same stats, or more strength even, as the corresponding helm of that category? (45 def to match a zerk, etc) 
---
Much excite, many questions, such wow.
---
I already stopped doing wildy slayer (and thats all I did) because emblems are worth 60k and they keys aren't worth it
---
Totally me
---
I have no issues with who people want to sleep with, as long as it isn't children. My issue is the social change being brought about by a incredibly small, vocal minority group that decided the world has to now participate in their little circus. Also I am of the belief these people should be helped. The suicide rate for transsexuals is so insanely high that by encouraging more to do it is just irresponsible as fuck. These people NEED help. And by catering to them you are only hurting them.
---
Please fix HCIM legs overlapping boots when worn
---
Wonder how well PvP 'slayer' masters would do in the game? High tier PvP masters could be locked behind points and unlockable like slayer masters are locked behind combat level. High tier PvP masters could assign more difficult tasks (KO someone with a Dragon Hasta special attack for example) and reward more points.
---
This is what I do; if you flame them they'll just farm you so might as well go out in style.
---
It's important to consider that these changes are for bounty hunter pkers, which differ a bit from a lot of the clan pking and pkers that prey on PvM'ers and clue hunters that you see being memed on reddit a lot. There are more problems with bh, in that it only hosts UK and USA worlds leaving everyone else high and dry. However, as a pker that does all types of pking, this update looks truly amazing. The hardest thing that will be very difficult to get right is the mage defence calculations
---
I prefer taking a picture to trigger people and it feels more “old school”
---
@JagexSween can you please provide some basis for saying it's a minor change? +18 bonus to +0 seems like quite a lot. And if zuriel staff and vls are added to the game, it doesnt seem like the odd clue scroller in max defensive gear has much of a chance.
---
Lol i love flicking my priv chat on after these kinds of kills to see the rage.
---
I use a lance for all metal dragon tasks (even mithril) and they arent worth skipping
---
oh no my feelings
---
Perhaps a system where emblems are upgraded during slayer would be better? Currently people who are doing wildy slayer risk fuck all unless they are carrying an emblem or key. Since the drop rates of the emblems and keys are pretty low, even if you do catch someone as a PvPer, you are unlikely to get any loot. To counteract this, maybe you could put “emblem upgrades” (an item that imbues an emblem) on the drop table for wildy slayer.  The idea would be to make those doing slayer increase their risk for greater reward. To prevent not risking the “emblem upgrade” item would disintegrate when taken outside of the wild.
---
Im a pvmer and would vote for them. If you want to bust out a vls for my spade go ahead, theyre exciting high risk weapons

---
I mean it should be worth more than the herb sack, which has less utility but costs 750 points. I'd say 800 or 900 is fine. Or maybe 750 at worst, but it shouldn't cost less than the herb sack does.
---
Or make it need to be done at altars, duh. Doesn't need to allow you to bankstand.
---
Who cares dude
---
You get extra for having a bank pin, and then a few more for having authenticator on.
---
It can't autocast ancients so bursting is likely out of question. Another idea instead of prayer bonus is to double the effect from saradomin's strike so it drains 2 prayer points every successful hit instead of 1. Atleast now it's more pvp oriented, but I'm not entirely sure how good or bad that effect would be in reality.

I couldn't afford it/do it back in the day so I asked my grandmother to do it for me.
---
Or just use runelite and it will get solved for you, free of charge.
---
Obviously not pitching it as a fix and obviously dont know how to code but if they could get it in a way that to deposit it you need to be on the tab that has the stack you want it to go in, no tab can have 2 stacks of the same item, and if you withdraw more than what you have in that stack treat it as each stack is a different item so only the one stack will be depleted.
---
While wearing the cape too! Impressive
---
Eyy never thought I'd see another trucker in this sub reddit. When I drove over the road I used to live for that hour or 2 at the end of the day to sit down and play RS. Who do you drive for?

I used to drink 10 cans of pepsi a day, but then I quit... and now I'm addicted to Marlboro Red's instead which I started smoking while I was trying to quit the caffeine and sugar. 2 packs a day. Well played vice's, well played.

Underrated comment
---
I feel bad for you. I got the pet on KC 8 with a dex scroll.
---
But the Blessed Sword already does that... Its spec is "deals a Magic-based attack (Magical melee) that increases the player's max hit by 25%, consuming 65% of the player's special attack energy." There is no mention that the new one would have minimum damage either. I don't see a point in making yet another Sara Sword upgrade when it is so close to the current one; just improve that one instead.
---
Why exactly did you decide to go from allowing people to buy runepouches for ~500k-1m each (depending on which emblems you buy) to either 1250 slayer points or 100+ bounty hunter kills for a single rune pouch?
---
Rune pouches have literally nothing to do with bh style pking and most people who pk with them have probably never gotten a target kill on their account.
---
Hey man sorry art isnt your thing, good on you for skipping things you dont care about though mate.
---
How tf is the only streamer that actually does shit with his community toxic lmfao. Are you braindead?
---
I have to redo the last light puzzle. Accidentally ported out before entering death altar. Rip me.
---
Really bitched out back there man.
---
I think 1 is pretty invalid due to slayer points but I agree otherwise
---
nobody cares
---
Loot is amazing if skilled pvming. I’ve made 1m in 20-30 mins just there. Pking at the caves I make 5m in a hour if I don’t die to other clans out
---
I just ran every single time, especially against the damn Shade. A rune b-axe, addy chain, full helm, kite, with salmon and trout wasn't well equipped enough to deal with these guys.
---
&gt;Discussions around how untradeables should behave upon death in PvM are still ongoing. Because it's a large topic and outside the scope of PvP, no decision has been made just yet. Any changes in this area proposed as a result of your feedback and discussion within the team will be polled.
---
The only death mechanic changes to pvm jagex should be entertaining in their head should be the way rs3 handles it.

The dynamic should at least be somewhat balanced. I was risking 10m (75m of gear if we include claws), this kid was risking his chins and nothing else. A 7m item should not guarantee survival for someone so unskilled that they do not switch prayers once in 5 mins.
---
To be fair it was the first time I was attacked and I was over triple the drop rate too. But I never minded if I died really. Just wanted to create an ironman haha
---
These changes seem pretty good,although pvp weapons definitely won't pass, and the rune pouch will be more difficult to obtain (through bh)
---
Why do you feel this warrants an AMA?
---
Sorry if the post said this, but I'm blind. If this update passes, would we lose the points in our store currently?
---
GZ on maxing!
---
So what happens to our current BH store points when they implement the new BH changes?
---
It's ok, you can swear. The police won't arrest you for saying the fuck word.
---
Lolololol youre poor af
---
I thought you were gonna say that. I love rc though made it my first 99. I’m having a tough time with mining. 95 rn
---
The thing is, even with a dhide/magic def nerf, bulwark still protects against melee/range so strongly that you can just camp mage prayer and be fine. Magic DPS through prayer will never be enough to kill anyone on a tb.
---
Not that hard at all really. You should be fine.
---
I think the plan was to format it a bit more than that, compare to other polls, and do data stuff and whatnot.
---
Can confirm. I did this accidentally with agility and was confused when it said I was getting 80k+/hr at rellekka  lmao.
---
Would prefer to see the corrupt variants of the ancient warrior weapons (corrupt vesta longsword, spear and statius' warhammer) over the corrupt dragon weaponry at level 20. Added added much more diversity for lower-mid tier pking back when they were originally introduced and also added more risk and reward too.
---
That can be done ofc, but then you still need bigger difference between black dhide and kharils/arma.
---
The problem is that range gear has a cheap lvl70 (40def)variant while mage only has a cheap lvl40(20def) gear.
---
do you enjoy or do you want to pretend like you do just for the sake of it?
---
That still lines up with gender fluidity lol
---
I'm torn as a pker and an uim. Basically impossible to get a rune pouch now (I'm an uim, I don't believe in boosting). Very sad about that but the pker side really REALLY likes the changes
---
My point isnt that its hard to code, or even hard to define consistent behavior. My point is that you have to define that behavior in the first place. The fact that there even is room for interpretation means that it will confuse some users.
---
it’s a joke relax
---
Exams rn might do after exams, but I think it won't solve the problem. (It makes you splash less on low def and more on high def, at 99 mage the breakpoint is like 85def)
---
UIM’s usually suicide in edgeville with locator orb and then pick up what they need. The rest of their items stay on the ground for an hour and they can go into the Wilde without much risk
---
I really dont care about pvp weapons except for morrigans javelins and thrown axes. If they will be added please change the spec animation and gfx that was in rs2 cuz the ones used in deadman mode are absolute trash. Real morrigans spec MATTERS!!!!!
---
Greeeeeasy
---
Surely by adding more and more ways for PKers to kill PvMers, and nerfing Dihns (admittedly in a minor way) you’re only going to push whatever tiny population remaining of PvMers out of the wilderness.
---
I mean really, the wilderness offers what? The best hunting method in game but realistically isn’t usually viable from constant PVP, a prayer method thats an okay alternative, and some bosses that not only can’t compete with Zulrah or Vorkath, have much higher risk, and rev caves, which I understand are good but for many aren’t worth the swarms of clans.
---
Honestly, you need to look at multi boxing, dragon spear stunlocking you endlessly in multi, and making content rewarding enough to actually go there.
---
PVPVM needs PVMers to survive, making nothing but PVP upgrades will just tip an already unbalanced scale
---
Please stop assuming what I care and do not care about.
---
I have an account where I log in with the username I chose when I created it, and I couldn't care less, if I had to use an email instead, if it meant me being able to use my account without issues.
---
Please explain, if you can, why the letters you type when logging into a game are relavant.
---
Please explain why you or anyone would care about it.
---
This doesnt seem like a bad step, what's wrong with it?
---
Why even bother just take kacys clue setup(Claws bp black dhide top rest diary gear with teleports).
---
Yeah, I've already noticed a dramatic increase in my profits from slayer. I had a wyrm task yesterday that got me ~600k in about an hour, with only two super sets and four prayer potions used. It was a good feeling, and I can't wait till skeletal wyverns, abyssal demons, etc.
---
Last night after reading your comment (and the other guy's) I put on my prossy and let my Protect from Melee run while I practiced flicking piety, and holy *crap* does that help a lot. Iron dragons are a lot more frustrating, unfortunately, but my black demon task went quite a bit faster and cheaper. Thanks again for the advice! I'm actually starting to get excited about slayer now.
---
EliteSwitch.
---
Flexing with a 100m bank lmao
---
This approach raises a number of concerns:
---
Firstly, the accounts who actually uses rune pouches don't play BH; they're PvMers, ironmen and deep wildy pkers. 
---
For PvMers/ironmen, the 1250 slayer points cost should be lowered since buying from BH would be far less obtainable for the average person. Could even consider making it tradeable.
---
For deep wildy pkers, please consider adding the wildy rune pouch (stores 3 runes, only usable within wildy) from the Warding blog to the BH shop at an affordable price. Going from instabuy with emblem points to having to grind BH is a massive change.
---
I approve of the idea if only because the two are very similar in purpose.
---
I bring combo food for this exact reason. Bitch hasn’t zeroed me out for ages because I refuse to let it. I’ll happily over eat to survive.
---
To be an ass for the reactions
---
Cosmic runes usually have 0 or 1 in stock. Sometimes you find a world with a couple of them in stock. But in extremely rare cases, you'll have a chance to find one with its stock topped out at 20.
---
This is the only way to obtain cosmic runes without runecrafting them yourself before SotE.

Are you talking crystal math labs or runelite? I've never seen my runelite track anything from mobile. I'm hopping back and forth between them a lot and nothing is from mobile is ever tracked on runelite for me. Whether it be xp, drops, or anything else.
---
Exactly.
---
What if people stay cuz they add so much content that a new skill isnt needed at all?

How does this new system lend itself to not be farmable/boostable? It seems like the point system is easier to farm than emblems.

Is there any kind of input lag?

found out some month later when i looked up the skill pets and realized how lucky i was
---
They're full on all worlds, but finding cosmics like this has an astronomically low chance.
---
I thought that was the dwarf helmet for a minute. 141 crush is pretty nice.
---
I like some of the ideas, but why do you need to change the point system? Why not just just make each Bounty Hunter kill 100,000 points and keep the current point system?
---
Sure do. Zybez and runehq had them too
---
Nice. I just didnt get the whole 37kc thing at first. Like, mage arena 37kc? What?
---
I'm gonna check again though, so you're saying I should be able to see my xp rates from last night on mobile on my computer right?

Blizzard censored a lot of crap in hearthstone recently. Blood got removed and other girls got "adjusted". Moves probably made to make it a more kid friendly game. I miss when blizzard was the dark, gritty, bloody PC game masters

wouldnt mind if gmaul cost like 500k..but a mill plus is crazy.. i deep wilder pk on a lvl 60 with no protect .. cant wait till the people bitchin about rushers.. are rushed just as much because these people have protect item and dont really die anyways.. congratz you played your self and now we got some shit emblem updates that people will somehow abuse even more.. JAGEX thanks..
---
Enjoy the swampletics binge.

Sadly yes. Although not more than if i woud play via remote desktop. It ok do to afk stuff, skilling etc. bossing, not so much!

it won't be any different these people have protect item, the spec tele thing didnt change much.. take this from a lvl 60 pure

Why?

Thank. I appreciate it. It set me back a hefty amount but it’ll soon be fall/winter so it’ll be well worth it!
---
LOCKED WE REALLY THOUGHT YALLS WAS BETTER THAN THIS BUT YE GUESS NOT
---
Theres only room for interpretation because it hasn't been defined yet. If it was defined in the way I mentioned or if someone else can come up with something better than there is no confusion whatsoever. Making a very precise rule like it needing to be on the tab you want it In would eliminate any confusion.
---
"Overhaul" is a very strong word. And if some weapons affect such a small percentage of the players, I'd consider them completely useless.
---
Almost done with some MLM grind to 60 mining, i hate it but at least it's more afkable than just mining iron.
---
I do this, but I do the bottom corner 2 at a time, then do the final 6.

Same, even have some friends I hang with irl that I met because IRC/rs over 13yrs ago. A big part of them have moved to discord but I still have a few that float around irc networks. At this point, I've had at least 1 or more of them as my neighbor, roommate, coworker.
---
I stick around IRC and use the same name for most games because it's kinda nice to see people that you haven't spoke with in forever randomly join channels. About a year or so ago, I was playing Battlerite and got queued with some random dude that turned out to be someone from years ago on SwiftIRC that recognized my name.
---
Good compromise imo. Make them risk a bit more if they want the 50%
---
I must admit it may be a little embarrassing I didn't realise it was the agility pet at a total level of 1450. I pretty much AFK seers and didn't see the chat message that I had gotten it hence why I was confused lol. Awesome to hear you got it so early man :)

What kind of input lag are you seeing?

I don’t even see pkers anywhere other than Revs/Lava drags tbh, so just tell Khrystalia to fuck off if she gives you those tasks.

Hmm, is that better than rock cake (including getting it back?) What I currently do on my UIM for chaos ele is rock cake down to low hp, then use the edge nettles.
---
and why should pvMers have an opinon on pvp shit they will never use.. thats how we ended up witha ditch.. and  and that dumb crater... at trade limits and no wilderness and rs3 ... and then godswords and then this and then that.. and then its a dead game again. they always ruin this game and have to backtrack to get people back. Maybe listen to who is doing the activity and not people who are clueless and just want to play the game with ever having to fight another player
---
Hey if you got it why not spend it?
---
Level 112 here. Am definitely at a disadvantage most of the time, but i've taken out a few lvl 126's. Takes some luck for sure. But I still agree with OP's comment. I do not have the time it takes to max out my stats. It's why I miss the LMS beta so much right now, it was a level playing field for everybody to practice. Now I'm playing at a constant disadvantage, hoping it will just make me better in the long run.
---
Why not make the rune pouch a drop in the learns key dop table?

The point of elo would not only to take in game stats into account but also skill and ability. Like it would take into account the speed of kills, the number of wins vs losses. 
---
If I’m a new player trying to pvp with a main account I don’t want to fight a person with 10000 wins and 0 losses. Even if we have the same stats.
---
Jagex already tracks k/d ratio so they obviously have the data to make an elo system. They just need to implement it.
---
Gonna blow your mind here for a second.
---
It's ecto funtus. There's no C in funtus.
---
members, you can see my addy cloak
---
Maybe I’m misunderstanding, so if someone could explain that would be great. 
---
BH rework would get rid of all previous points. You gain new points by killing your target and getting streaks, as well as different little challenges. And you get slayer-esque bonus points as well for kill. All these increments being small, with a max of 3 points per kill and on your 1000th kill, you get a bonus 150. 
---
The new granite maul upgrade is 1,250,000 points. 
---
If we assume flawless 120 kills an hour, without considering time to resupply and jumping straight to 3 points per kill, and you do every bonus challenge every 30 minutes. 
---
So you would be getting 108 regular kills, 
---
ten “10th” kill bonuses, and two “50th” kill bonuses. As well as the two 10 point challenges every half hour
---
108x3 + 10x25 + 2x50 + 2x10 = 644 points per hour at unrealistic efficiency. 
---
1,250,000/644 = 1941 hours to get granite maul upgrade?!
---
Please tell me I’ve missed something here..
---
&gt;Corrupt Dragon weaponry (battleaxe, dagger, longsword, mace, scimitar).  These would require 20 attack and have the same stats as equivalent  Dragon weapons. Once equipped, they will become untradeable and begin  degrading to dust, which takes 30 minutes. They would only work in PvP.  We're open to feedback on whether or not these should have the  equivalent special attacks, or if the stats should be adjusted.
---
Consider making them F2P tier 50-60 weapons with stats equal to Dragon weaponry, but without the special attacks - similarly to how they worked in RS2. This would be a breath of fresh air for F2P PK.
---
Don't change it cowards.
---
I risk nothing and most of the time get killed or forced to run away before even making it to the actual rev’s.
---
Inb4 some conspiracy that these professionals are somehow involved into a big manipulation.
---
Why not have a legacy store, the same as it currently is? There would be no way to earn points for it, and the only way to access it would be a dialogue option with the emblem trader if you already have points. 
---
This removes a reason to vote no and is comparable or less work for the devs.
---
I believe you can drop trick a bunch from Jorral, I know the jorral ones will KO I’m not sure if the DS2 one will
---
Can't pay 200K for clue scroll puzzles might as well figure it out now.

original sauce?
---
I wonder if they will just recolor the sash on the Elder Druid robes like originally planned or if they'll do the full robe. But hopefully, the rest of the recolors are more subtle... Like changing ghostly from black to say navy or dark red would still look about the same while providing some variation, but making it yellow would be weird.
---
Small minority. S M A L L. keyword: **S - M - A - L - L** Small.
---
"It's a minority. Not a small minority."
---
Yes, which is sketchy with whatever point of view you have. But the thing is, PvP is one of the most contentious part of the game, and is where the polling systems really falls short by punishing minorities. It's not the first time they push updates which failed a PvP-related poll, and certainly not the last time.
---
Very is an understatement
---
nah, there is a spell that already does this called monster examine on the lunar spellbook. It’s fine the way it is imo
---
In pvp it is exactly the same as any other shield worn without a weapon or a purely tanky weapon like a staff except the bonuses are broken. Everyone always pulls out this argument that bulwark deserves special treatment because it forces you to give up retaliating, as if you can’t possibly equip something else to fight back with. Sick of the crap arguments people keep using to defend this item because they can’t just say they want to keep abusing it themselves
---

Only thing I can think of is if he used a computer with a RAT. Then the hacker could just take over whenever and get in because the computer fingerprint means it wouldn't ask for auth code.
---
That's kinda unlikely though, and the very convenient timing makes me think it's someone OP knows.
---
Never said it wasn't small. Still a minority. It being a small minority doesn't change the definition of what a minority is.
---
&gt; The hardest thing that will be very difficult to get right is the mage defence calculations.

Well thats what the beta worlds are for

---
Have you ever PKed? Watch the video he linked, he has a 50 attack med letting him hit 45s with g maul and over 60 with Obby Maul at like 97 combat or something. He literally 1 tick stacks multiple people out from near full HP in the vid.
---
They're looking into this
---
But you’re trying to argue against the changes so what’s the reason?
---
weeb
---
I suppose what I mean mostly is how little variation there is. You’re right, thats basically edge pking in a nutshell, but for all combat brackets from like 40-126 combat, the gmaul is used as a KO weapon. That’s boring. A 30k weapon shouldn’t be the meta for all combat brackets. This update will force people who don’t want to risk 400k to use other weapons for KO, and people who want to risk that much still can use the gmaul. People can still use cheap weapons like a dds. The main thing is it will bring a change in the current meta, which is healthy for pvp in the long term.
---
Pkers that don’t do slayer to train initially are just dumb
---
The best third-party client by far =P Crazy to think there was a time Jagex ban it because it let you click a button to open a url to game worlds, bypassing the normal website world select. Now today we got clients that let you transfer worlds without even logging out that were so prevalent they added it to the game.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/t5apkKh](https://imgur.com/a/t5apkKh)
---
Meh. The wiki fills this role better than any in-game feature is likely too.
---
I didn't say that's what makes it good. I'm saying that because the magic defence is getting nerfed, you are more likely to get frozen which means you have to tank more hits
---
I guess it would be a golden recolour or something like that
---
Hey they're basically working as really challenging NPCs who give a very lucrative area of the game a sense of danger found no where else. Like devastating random events that can appear at any moment and take the loot you've been gathering. They're totally escapable and Jagex does more than enough to help those who are prepared and practice their exit strategy. If you're just wandering around or afking I don't have any sympathy.
---
You're allowed to bring sharks, brews, and high magic defense gear when you do clues. You don't have to be naked in hopes you'll be shown mercy. There is no mercy.
---
I wouldn’t worry about it. I personally plan on voting no to everything as long as they keep trying to nerf Dihn.
---
Nothing else in the game is even close to being that visually offensive.
---
Nope you're missing a combat bracelet
---
Yep! If you only got a pet once and you lost it without it being insured it would suck never getting a chance to roll it again.
---
But BSS is also one of the best strength-training DPS weapons in the game (although expensive to use), so doesn't it fall under your concerns as well?
---
No amount of BH changes will prevent people from getting gangbanged while naked doing a clue lol. That being said, voting no simply "because PvP" is ridiculous. I want PKers to get the content that they need / want, and I'll be voting yes even if I never do the content myself.
---
Well what you would consider useless then is harmful to minority groups of the player base like ironmen so I guess we shouldn’t entertain your ideas
---
In fact, this exact meme has been posted lol
---
Victim.
---
Voting no for weapons, recolours and the 5k kill hat. The hat will just lead to people boosting kills endlessly or buying kills to get it
---
Good advice, thank you!
---
thank you!
---
The original comment said "because of a **S - M - A - L - L** minority, the guy to whom you replied emphasised it wasn't small (although with the wrong numbers) and I replied to you saying it was indeed a minority, but very far from being a S.M.A.L.L one.
---
If you're dedicated enough to grind through inferno, getting 95+ range shouldn't be too much of an issue imo. Get range as high as you feel like investing.
---
At the very minimum though, I'd recommend getting 90 range over 89 because you're one level away from getting +13 per range or bastion potion dose after 89 compared to +12 at 89.
---
0.0
---
:)
---
This is a terrible idea there are way too many emblem farm bots. Fuck this shit unless Jagex can fix this the number of bots will be insane and introduce way too much gp into the game
---
So get better.
---
The slider puzzles are far easier than the light puzzles, especially if you actually did them both on your own
---
Slayer is useless for pking, 5x slower than NMZ, and worse money than pking if you are good. Yep, definitely dumb.
---
That is a good idea but I already got the torso. I guess I can just lvl the other roles for the elite diary while they get it
---

---
You've already started off horribly if you want to convince people who are hesitant/intend on voting no to instead vote yes.
---
People don't like being told what to do. They ESPECIALLY don't like being told what they WILL do. Don't tell people what they will or will not do if this or that.

Educate them and let them come to a decision on their own. Don't try and make their decision for them.

Just make Evil Dave's mom sell bags for 25k a piece. Might aswell create some sort of a gold sink. Wouldn't price it above 50 tho.

---
This is what I did at the time of my account pre-hydra. 
---
I trained my attack and defense to 75 (the highest level I needed was 75 for both) and then I just maxed strength out. I personally think you should do Strength&gt;Attack&gt;Defense but that’s just my opinion. It’s nice slaying high 40’s on slayer tasks.

for strength training it just depends. I personally didn’t mind using a Dscim on tasks. It got the job done at the end of the day.
---
Gz! I’ll be maxing next Tuesday, can’t wait!
---
Exactly, and I’d like to not be one so often.
---
You can clearly see theres a plant in the doorway, you cant access the ladder
---
I got 99 mage on my main when that was around. Profitted around 13m even with paying for hosts(back when you needed a host who only had the desired quests unlocked.)
---
No, that is not what I am saying. His initial offer simply can't exceed max cash. He can sell 2 billion tbows at 1gp each in his offer and place it with out any issue. The issue is how the GE handles filling out his offer. Obviously he would not get 1gp for the tbows that he placed his sell offer for, because people already have buy offers in for more than 1b each. If it were to sell his tbows for 1b each, the sell offer would then exceed max cash.
---
Like I have already explained, the way the game will then handle his offer is as follows.
---
User places a sell offer consisting of 4 tbows in GE at 1gp each.
---
Game accepts offer because it is valued at 4gp.
---
Game looks for current highest bidding offer for tbow. Let us say that offer is buying 1 tbow at 1020m and fills that order.
---
Seller then receives 1020m in GE for his 4gp sell offer.
---
GE then processes next transaction and sees someone buying at 1016m and sells it to him.
---
Seller then receives another 1016m in GE totaling at 2036m.
---
GE then processes next transaction and immediately rejects any offer exceeding 111m as it would bring his GE total over 2147m as 2147m - 2036m = 111m (rounding max cash to nearest million for easy math)
---
GE then looks for highest current offer in GE under 111m. Let us say it found one just shy of the limit by around 20gp, so it fills out an order that was placed at 110,999,980gp (110.999m)
---
That means the user's GE offer that he originally placed as 4 tbows * 1gp without any issue has filled out 2,146,999,980 GP out of a limit of 2,147,000,000. It now has the task of looking for an offer that will not exceed that remaining 20gp while still selling to the highest possible offer.
---
GE looks at highest offer within the 20gp limit and sees that the highest one buying is 13gp. GE then processes the transaction and sells it to OP at 13gp.
---
Keep in mind this all happens in a single game tick so the seller would not see these individual transactions. This is simply breaking down the procedure in a step by step manner.
---
The game does not restrict you from creating a GE offer simply because the potential of it going over max cash. They only restrict the offer if your offer already exceeds max cash in order to fill it as you initially requested. If it did not function this way, you wouldn't be able to place an order for anything, as literally any transaction with more than 1 quantity has the potential of running into this issue.
---
As I have stated many times, OP's post is 99% chance of being fake. That said, this is a very realistic scenario. Someone's account could've been hacked and the people liquidating it may have no idea the GE functions in this way, so when they dump 4+ tbows it may have sold off most of them at bargain prices.
---
I can't tell without context if he's making fun of it, or promoting it? Or maybe saying it's bad? Confused.
---
Nah voting no on all 6 accounts. The less updates they get the faster the wild dies.
---
5 points per crate is a lot more reasonable. I had feared that it was 1 point per crate. Other than that one concern, everything else looks great and well put together. Great job :)

Ok, I really appreciate it! Yeah I honestly got range where it is now mostly by fight caves, learning and then just beating it a bunch to try for the pet. But I appreciate the help! Do I bring ahrims robes for range or blessed dhide?
---
Wrong sub boi
---
It would probably be better to use sharks or mantas so you can use super combats. Along with barrows gear.
---
If you can afford it, a Viggora's chainmace would be a really good choice for a main weapon.
---
Just pray range and attack and run from his special attack. Shouldn't have much trouble with your stats.
---
one color per limb
---
I used to use their signatures on clan forums, good times.
---
Not many would disagree, this is a good idea.
---
If an addition or chance affects a group of players then they should have a say on it. PvMers may never use PvP weapons, but they will be attacked by them. PvMers are already having one of their most important defensive tools nerfed, and now they could be also start being attacked with stronger weapons.
---
GHOSTLY ROBES YES PLEASE
---
Huh, theres a subreddit poll? Is there a fear that poll results were rigged? because official warding poll failed, I wasn't aware there was a private reddit-only poll
---
ah right so ur catering to edge veng pkers and really encouraging any type of water staff 2 rune pking (why people splash on black dhide) from anyone that pks deeper wild since your force obtaining rune pouch via edge pking only (lol)
---
killing off all low lvl 50 attack builds with gmaul change when you could just make it 100% spec and do the 3 hits (only people that pk in bh) since the weapon is broken in correlation with ags/claws
---
now ur also killing off f2p multi warring even more with ur f2p snare/entangle considering its already fucked enough with the phasing of players in 9x9 square
---
real nice integrity changes jagex !
---
for chiseling? i usually use 3 keys in a triangle, like O,L,P
---
P = left click
---
O = move cursor up an inv slot
---
L = move cursor down an inv slot
---
and to chisel its ```POPL POPL POPL POPL ...```
---
and low level bot farms, with 30+ accounts in a single area farming kills/points?
---
what do you mean?
---
fuck
---
Keep in mind that osrs is meant to be played however you want to play it. What skills, training methods and gp makings methods you enjoy and want to focus on are entirely up to you. 
---
I’m not familiar enough with early game membership things, so I don’t think my advice will be the best; however, I’d recommend questing early on. There are lots and lots of things locked behind quests and mini quests that you will want to get out of the way ASAP. 
---
Waterfall quest will reward you with a massive combat xp drop and is doable at a very low lvl. It’s  recommended to do that first.
---
Starting fairytale pt2 to unlock fairy teleport rings is crucial for convenience. Same with the gnome quest (can’t remember their names) to unlock the spirit trees tele. 
---
I would be training slayer and farming in between quests to keep things interesting and eventually earn money. I don’t spend too much time on skilling except for quest requirements (and I mine afk a lot; motherload mine). Go for faster xp methods rather than gp earning methods, unless the difference in xp is negligible or fast xp method requires heaps of gp. 
---
Keep in mind that some skills are much more click intensive and require more attention than others. Runecrafting, for instance, can be extremely profitable, but requires time and attention.
---
I would also recommend you download Runelite from their official site. It makes all kinds of things smoother. Saves time looking things up and has great tools like xp trackers/price checkers, and all sorts of customizable options.
---
Gain points through slayer and doing wildy task while holding it, so maybe do a whole task while holding a t2 it turns it to t3.
---
They are very aware of the zulrah situation and your zulrah rares/scales investment will pay off because Weath just returned from his summer holiday and is probably eager to ban them first thing tomorrow morning.
---
Dicing bots are only there because the anti-bot resources got cut in half a while ago, he is doing good on his own but only so much he can do. 
---
(and of course getting 7-day memberships for 500K eliminates the startup costs for these bots)
---
You can reword how ya want it. But that ain't gonna change it.
---
Whoosh
---
YOU CAN PAY?!!!!!!!
---
I know Reddit likes to cream themselves with the "you made the game harder for yourself" argument, but what about rune pouches for Ironmen?
---
The proposed removal of emblems from wildy Slayer makes it way more intense since the risk an im takes on is higher than a non-im counterpart. I saw embelms would be buyable at tier one, does that mean pouch would become buyable?
---
Did I miss something because it says that gmaul upgrade is gonna be 10million points but they are also saying they are gonna change the points system...
---
So what will it be for the new system?
---
Also the price on the new rune pouches is beyond insane.
---
Given the average person is not going to be getting 10 kills in a row, it will likely take over 100 target kills to afford the rune pouch. That is an insane jump compared to what it takes now.
---
Boosting of bh kills is certainly a problem but I only see this new system making it worse by putting one of the main rewards (the rune pouch) behind the requirement of a hundred odd target kills.
---
Additionally what happens to those of us with millions of bh points currently? Did I miss that section?
---
Thoughts from someone who spends half of their game time PKing outside of BH:
---
* I like the concept of earning points and spending them on crates with a randomized reward. This definitely seems more exciting than the current BH reward shop. However, the points system seems like it would be much easier for bots to farm than the current system, unless I'm missing something.
---
* As for the rewards themselves, I'm honestly not sure how I feel about the addition of the PVP and corrupted weapons. The sara sword and abby dagger upgrades could bring some love to lesser used weapons as well, but I think all of these rewards should be given **extensive** beta testing periods before being potentially added to the live game. It's just too hard to say how much of an effect on overall gameplay they would have otherwise.
---
* Last bit regarding the rewards, the amount of recolours seems a bit forced just for the sake of adding more content to the shop. Cosmetic rewards are always nice, but do we really need recolours for all of these items? It seems a bit private server-esque. I personally would rather see more unique cosmetics or even graphical overrides for existing items instead of recolours.
---
* The granite maul changes are much needed and I'm especially glad you reconsidered how the upgrade will work on death, but I still think that this upgrade should be added to the GG boss table for both thematic and gameplay reasons instead of being forced into the BH store to fit in with the rest of the update.
---
* The bulwark nerf is also gladly welcomed, and I'm happy with the direction you chose. It makes sense that a tank shield doesn't give magic defence and now forces players to choose between raw physical defence or magic defence (or bringing appropriate switches) instead of having both in one item.
---
* The most glaring flaw that I see with the potential to broadly hurt PVP is the rune pouch being locked behind BH points with no way of purchasing it externally and the complete removal of looting bags from the store. These items are both hugely popular in all forms of PVP and shouldn't be obtainable only from BH points.
---
* Lastly, as I mentioned in another post before having the time to write out a proper reply, changing the magic defence roll from 70/30 to 50/50 only indirectly buffs med and main accounts as defence can be boosted higher than magic with both potions and prayers. Adjusting these weightings in any direction buffs some account builds while nerfing others. Instead, magic somehow needs to be made more accurate in PVP across the board, such as a percentage multiplier being applied after the existing calculations.
---
Honestly I know jack shit about any of that stuff. I played a game called Black Desert Online (piece of shit game btw don't play it) and it requires you to have a Family name (account) and character name. I made Yeshua my family name and when googled to make sure I typed it right the name "Hamashiach" came up as "Jesus Christ" or some shit so I was like fuck it and made that my character name. 
---
Then it just kinda stuck and I use it for lots of games now.
---
No need to be efficient if you run the bot 24/7.
---
You realise outlasting and burst are two totally different ways of getting a kill? 
---
People have no qualms calling power creep to anything PVM, but PVPers already have every advantage in the book and still need more.
---
AND I dont even just vote no like “a moron”, just to PVP weapons, which I feel are too much. But its my fault, sorry I and many others don’t enjoy it!
---
I am looking at buying a fury right now and noticed the price is tanking, is this due to something with song of the elves release, is it just fluctuation of the market, or something else.  Should I hold off on buying one I guess is the heart of this question.
---
Also I just started playing this game again after quitting in probable 2008 and have been pretty much playing alone.  Is there some guide to finding a good clan, or can someone suggest one to me.
---
Thanks for your time.

Would there be a potential in making a modifier for the Ring of Wealth to allow it to pick up Numlite? Or maybe you could 'charge' it with a rune and allow it to automatically pick up all of that rune drops?
---
I have the item "coins" from I think Shilo Village quest. It's a stack of fake coins and I use it as the icon for my loot tab, it's the only reason why I don't just hit the remove all button with the wise old man.

I'm in the same boat as you- RC might take a while but it's easier to get a rhythm going while you focus on something else. Mining always feels like it demands more attention.

yes, but they are still the best in slot, and i'd love to be able to use a crystal axe while woodcutting or, even a harpoon while fishing, the pickaxe is definitely the most useful of the 3, but they are still the best in slot..
---
The quest itself is one of the most enjoyable things you can do in osrs, and galvek is not hard at all. His mechanics are easy, you just have to have good enough gear and stats or else youll run out of brews.
---
Dragon crossbow, dragon ruby(e)/diamond(e) bolts, blessed d’hide I’d say is the minimum gear setup.
---
Yep. Top-down by row, bottom-left corner, bottom-right corner.
---
It's not hard to have dialogue options that are only visible if certain conditions are met. See various quests, ring of charos, and so on. I mentioned to gambit the possibility of having it only be visible if you have the currency.

Still looking for the Zezima message, no success
---
lol i just did this quest a couple weeks back on my rebuild account and did this part on mobile. completely forgot there was a plugin for this. FUCK
---
If someone has a max cape what more is one more skill going to do? If someone loves the game so much they have a max cape why would they NOT want another skill? That's another challenge to overcome and another change to show others how good they can be at the game. Anyone with a high total  level or max cape that doesn't want a new skill (in general, not talking specific) should quit the game. They're just bogging down everyone else's fun because they don't want to feel less superior to other people around them. They hate the game and should leave.
---
I got enough for a bond, just waiting until I'm thoroughly bored with F2P beforehand.
---
And I'll probably use real $$ for membership when I get to it anyways.
---
The average age of an OSRS player is 24. I know this because I’m 24.
---
Completely agree. The recolours feel forced for the sake of adding more "content" to the shop. Would much rather see cosmetic overrides for the existing items instead of recolours, or entirely new unique cosmetics to flex your BH prowess.
---
What's the hesitation around converting points or just having the new point system get more inline with the existing one and keep it the same? IE having 10 kills be something around 100k points instead of 25.
---
Just trying to understand the thought process a bit more.
---

Im gunna do what a friend did and just save up for a full inventory and just hope
---
&gt;We aren't going to make massive changes to the Dinh's Bulwark. Instead we're just going to reduce its magic defence bonus to 0.
---
That's even worse than the previous proposed change. There's no problem with it's stats, but if you are gonna force more PvP integrity again then at least make it a PvP only change. The thing was designed for PvM tanking and it's gonna be even worse now.
---
I'm guilty of this also
---
TBF it raises awareness
---
The cost to use mele or range is so much less then magic.
---
Ice barrage isn't an instakill button for pkers anymore, that's the "problem" they are fixing.
---
I like this idea more than the proposed one.
---
It's more an argument for display names to be able to be changed to be different than usernames. 
---
While an email can serve that purpose, it can also do more useful things, like allowing Jagex to contact you outside of the runescape platform, semi-divorced from your account (and credentials).
---
Good idea. All of my friends are grown and don't play. RS is kind of something I still latch-on to from my childhood, but my social status in the game isn't nearly what it was back in 05.
---
Whats the logic behind this again
---
go into your settings and toggle resizable mode
---
A black or white torso could be cool but something about seeing any other colour torso just rubs me the wrong way. Its such an iconic item
---
What the fuck that's one of the last quests I need for my quest Cape after just doing ds2
---
Not OP but using math I can give you a rough estimate.
---
According to the wiki, current GE prices for palm saplings are 37,388 and magic saplings are 112,283. Adding in the cost of the payment, assuming he paid to protect them, 15 papayas and 25 coconuts bring the cost to 49,118 and 147,958 (note some of the coconut cost would be offset by him harvesting coconuts from palm trees but I'm too lazy to do all that). This is also assuming he has 5 of each tree patch (he said he never set foot in the farming guild til 99). This is also assuming only 1 run per day (on his morning poop, theoretically he could do a second magic tree run in a day). He would have to plant roughly 400 of each tree to get from 85-99, with palm trees giving 10,509.6 xp and magic trees giving 13,913.8 xp. 
---
So 400 of each tree would cost 19,647,200 + 59,183,200 = 78,830,400 gp. But that's just a rough estimate because i assumed some variables that arent necessarily accurate.
---
tbh what kind of example would this set? That it's okay to break the rules only when reddit says it's okay?

This changes nothing in the mid tier bracket (65-75 combat) since most of those accounts are 50 atk and 31~ prayer. It completely changes Low and high tier brackets though (40-60 combat levels and 80-110 combat bracket + main pking). Low tier bracket will now probably use something like Dragon Knives or knives to C bow/ballista to KO, while the 80+ combat bracket will honestly probably still use the g maul, just with the added risk. 
---
Overall, good change, but I'm worried about the low tier bracket since that's the one that most beginners are in, and while the G maul was terrible to fight against, it was also the easiest weapon to get a kill with as a beginner (just look at Autumn Elegy's pk video for a good example of the maul being a great beginner weapon that allows new pkers to still have fun since they have a chance at getting kills).
---
that has like no relevance to my post

boosts that change your actual level that you can see in the level screen do not stack; e.g. a dpick can boost your mining to 73/70 and you'll see your mining stat displayed as 73 - this doesn't stack with similar boosts like the dwarven stout, spicy stew, etc. it does stack with invisible boosts such as the invisible +7 from the mining guild

They should just make them only usable in PvP/bh world's for risk fighting

What like 400k/h? Thats not even f2p good.

I will admit what we got vs what they talked about at runefest for the first time was a lot less than expected. However it was still good for the most part imo. Without a doubt there were legit complaints about it and still are some fair complaints. But people that called it useless back then, and especially people that call it useless now...I don't understand.

Absolutely. Another point to add is that there are similar toggleble items ingame such as metal collecting on Ava's devices. Consistency is key for world-building, so if the bonecrusher were changed, it wouldn't make sense if those items weren't also changed. It's a bigger job than it might appear, and it's hardly worth the dev time or the eye-sore to save a few people a right click here and there.

Wiki says they’re 2/128. It’s probably won’t be very fast but you should get some if you camp them for a while. Dragon dart tips are 3/128 it says too.
---
me neither, i occasionally show up to help clear worlds, but as a pure you hardly make money.
---
If you die does he sell your data?
---
Yeah there's never been a paid-for tool that gives players advantages over others with Jagex's implied consent from their mods using it themselves[.](https://rsbuddy.com/)
---
I mean the general basic info is fine and well...basic. 
---
The gearing though. oh boy.
---
That being said, numbers aside, I still very much agree with your point, regarding cost ranking. Sorry if I came off as steep.
---
This would be amazing. It would add a whole strategic layer to the game that currently doesn't exist. You might even have actual team compositions develop with things like the lunar heal spells seeing use.
---
Don't they get it thru Slayer anyway ?
---
First off, I’m really happy to see Jagex addressing integrity and balancing in PVP. 
---
However, the gmaul 50% special is just so much more powerful in the low and mid tier PKing brackets than anything else available that the meta is simply going to evolve around keeping it (eg moving to 25/31 prayer sooner, and leaving some other +1 behind). Even if the max hit is decreased by a few HPs due to these changes, it’s still the best KO weapon by a large margin. 
---
For the health of the game, please consider permanently moving the g maul spec to 60% within PvP, or at the very least increasing the attack requirement to use the 50% g maul special to 60 or 65.
---
C
---
Yeah
---
Why? My phone is fine. No need to waste money on the latest every year brah.
---
You mean life
---
That should be against the rules
---
I did yes
---
Np, I didn't really take it that way. I was just focusing on the herb sack being fixed for some reason haha
---
I own all the items so I don't really care how the price changes now as I don't plan to make another account. But I guess this will suck for future ironmen down the line since they can't do Wildy Slayer for the rune pouch. And even regular players will either have to do BH or pay 1250 points... yikes
---
Was hilarious for the few days to a week (can't specifically remember) that there was no 200k skip.
---
All the plebs were complaining so bad on the RSOF instead of just learning how to do puzzleboxes with the very simple guide on tip it.
---
(put them in order horizontally top left to top right, when you get to the bottom two rows, do two rows at a time. you can move any piece around in groups of 6)
---
Doesn’t matter, other companies have similar famous individuals streaming on their platform that don’t have an issue logging in simply because people know their username. This is unacceptable. And it doesn’t even just effect those few people. Anyone who streams with an account with a legacy login like this is affected.
---
Yeah, wouldn’t be a bad mobile thing but I don’t typically have a lot of afk time and with the time I do have again it’s not something I’m trying to do when I have alternative options. Picked up 4 d imp calls yesterday, so this method works. But thanks for the suggestion.
---
I believe they do mage only because Zulrah's blue phase is too unpredictable with the attacks, so the bot doesn't even bother with the variable blue phase and sticks to green/red/jad
---
Back before Home Tele, JMods would literally have to come and get you personally

Is the Magic Training Arena laggy for anyone else on mobile? Going for bones to peaches and considering full infinity and and wand, but not if its gonna be this laggy mess every step of the way

Nope, should be fine. I’ve used a foot pedal for alching before while playing other games and listening to a metronome, can’t be any worse than that

Most non ironmen just buy it since its so time consuming and risky to get otherwise.  And even most ironmen just do wildy slayer for it.  For the price of the actually unlocking it through a slayer master you could unlock slayer helmet, superior boss monsters, fill the block menu (including the lumby elite block) and extend a task.

''A tank shield designed for tanking actually working and being useful? NERF!!!''
---
But that’s why it would only apply to bounty hunter worlds. If a clue hunter is in a bounty hunter world is their fault.
---
Also there’s no Elo system in the world that can outsmart smurfs. It’s just fundamentally not feasible.
---
It’s possible with the team’s current tools IMO. All you need is a system to assign a new variable to all players (Elo rating) and a system to add or remove from that variable if the player wins or loses. An Elo rating system isn’t that complex honestly, people like to make it seem like it’s an amazingly complex system for fair gameplay but honestly it doesn’t have to be.
---
Just using kd ratio and skill level could honestly be a fine Elo in it of itself.
---
What’s the best way to get from 52 farming to 65 to use the herb patch in the farming guild for my ranarr herb runs? The wiki says tree runs are best for xp but also mentions that you can only do about two a day and looking at a skill calculator it says that it’ll take me 67 pineapple trees to get to 65 which would be over a month to achieve it.
---
can you expand on everything you just said?
---
What lvl hp you think a lvl 60 has? A dds at that lvl can hit 2727? I'm 60 hp lol . I never argued the gmaul wasnt broken. But should it cost more then ballista? More then dark bow? My gmaul noodles 5/10 times at 50 attack you know the level required.  So how is it better then? It's better for high levels in maxed gear for the crazy hits. The problem is rushers. There should be a full minute where rushers can be hit if they rush you , no teling that would stop the gmaul rush and just make it cost 500k.. boom problem fixed
---
Is lummy elite done ?
---
That’s why I maxed con early, I wish I knew how many times I’ve used that tele and how much money I’ve saved
---
we dont speak about that
---
&gt; nerf graceful
---
it's already pretty useless aside from reducing how often you stam at blast furnace

I added, ill pm if i see ya on
---
it was 75 attack :(
---
Got to have a picture of your in game character on your profile page as well for maximum gains
---
How much can you have made through wintertodt when you have 82 fm? Or birdhouse runs with 63 hunter?
---
Well, it's irrefutable that the Dmace is for Chad's.
---
i have 2 choices 1: 75 def 2: max main
---
Wasn’t he the same guy who was super pissed about the PVP clients that make you switch your gear instantly?
---
Well damn, I hope I never have to see those. Imagine doing a master and getting 27k
---
Fish
---
I would like to see less of the recolours. Rather id like to see actual upgrades to the items both cosmetically and stat wise. Now hear me out...
---
For popular untradeables in pking (barb assult and cwars gear) add upgrades which alter the items appearance aswell as stats. For example the fighter torso would receive minor accuracy bonuses to melee, aswell as minor defensive bonuses. It would then be made a degradeable item which would need to be charged much like the crystal armour. The charges would always be lost on death making those who use it pking would risk more.
---
In addition to this the item would now have higher requirements to wield. (50 defence instead of 45) allowing new pking builds to develop! The upgrades would never be better than current BiS items like the BCP however, stopping those items from being devalued.
---
Thoughts? 
---
Id also like to see an item which would upgrade weapons by giving them an ‘agressive’ attack option, but not increasing theie current attack speed or max hit.  The new upgraded weapon would become degradeable with charges always lost on death making it more expensive to pk with, aswell as giving signifigantly reduced xp, making the non upgraded weapon better for training still.
---
This item would allow certain builds to use things like whips, zammy hasta, dragon hasta, spears, etc. and would really open up new weapon combos! Its a win win really!
---
15-20 kph in 4 man teams
---
&gt; 
---
These changes will go ahead without a poll for necessary rebalancing to protect the health of PvP. Large amounts of feedback and ongoing discussion informed these decisions. While no single outcome will please everyone, these changes were decided with the integrity of PvP and fairness at the top of our priorities.
---
Glad that you'll ignore the playerbase and ram through changes for a small vocal faction, but we don't get warding with 60%+.
---
Every time I asked my dad for help in a game he would catastrophically fuck up beyond repair unless it was Mario in case he was a wizard
---
I got a double on day of release. Was dh plate and axe. The set was actually bugged and lower HP didn't make you hit any harder for like the first week lol. Idk if I knew that when I sold for 11m
---
Well that’s an example of when I lose expensive stuff I have to grind up cash just to keep going. 
---
But usually it’s trying to quest, I’ll die
---
Yes 150m is cheap, his target demograph is stakers who treat this game as a job, or some wannabe big staker with a 1b+ bank, 150m is nothing if people at arena regularaly give 55%+ odds. Back when i played i paid 10b +250m-350m a week for 58% odds in a flower clan and made over 40b profit.
---
Also, Did you not even read my comment. I clearly said it is not ethical to sell, the reason it is ethical to use personally is because if you are smart enough to understand the odds based on urs and ur opponents stars, then its just as ethical as card counting in a casino.
---
I suppose. thanks for the advice
---
They're from the runelite bank plugin. Very useful for creating specific tabs for various activities
---
What is coming out of Guthan’s chain skirt? 0.0
---
not that much, most of the gold that I accumulated came from herb runs or looting. wintertodt actually does give a good amount of gold though, I've probably made a mil off of it since I started playing
---
&gt;an msb is the iconic green stock.
---
hold up
---
Ur not wrong but some how feel like i am gonna still die with my spade
---
How daft are you? If I’m camping 100+ hp you think you’re gonna be able to dds me? LOL. And no ones talking about gmail rushing retard, you have no idea how to brid if you think that’s what I’m talking about.
---
Getting paid to play, that's the dream
---
Yep Ironman
---
Honestly all I care about is whether this will buff the current meta of making massive botfarms that abuse the BH world or not.
---
Drop the clue
---
That doesn’t even make sense. Gold used for staking is all taxed. The worst bots are ones generating resources.
---
Depends on the issue
---
actually I said less than 1%... so it's more than 100m. plus i have quest cape, all hard diaries and base 80 stats.
---
&gt; I guess the other forms of feedback they get outweigh failing 2 polls in 2 years?
---
I mean, yah... The D Spear nerf also failed a poll, but the feedback of "this is a stupid broken mechanic, please change it for the good of the game" was enough for them to decide to go against those results. When it comes to the health of the game and balancing, arguments backed by reason should be valued over a general consensus.
---
In this case, the current state of snares isn't harmful to the game so there isn't as big of a need to change it as with D Spears so I don't fully agree with them changing it unpolled. But I think there is far more of a reason to change this unpolled than to add Tele-Block to F2P unpolled since this is an inconsistent mechanic between spellbooks that causes one spellbook to be stronger than the other.
---
Though personally I would have gone with something like both bind spells and ice spells have their duration reduced by say 25% if you have mage prayer to make it consistent without removing the benefit of the correct prayer (e.g. Ice barrage drops from 20 to 15 if you pray while Entangel drops from 15 to 11). Perhaps something like 20% reduction on Ice and 30% on Binds even to still give Ice more of an advantage or just reducing Binds from 50% to 25% and leaving Ice as is.
---
I been mining since mobile for the most part took a break for a couple months February and March mined 140k rune since mobile I’ll be done at 200k in probably 10 more weeks and I still have to buy bonds to get everything I want minus scythe my limit is 20% of my bank bought I want to grind at least 80%
---
Literally just watch videos and guides, just like how you would before doing bosses. Torvestas guide goes over literally every aspect you mentioned, so you're just being lazy in that regard. Also I am a little skeptical that you can do a lot of pvm after three months of playing.  Pure PvP has always been a rich mans game, as there's not really any profit possible outside of risk fights and emblems as supplies cost just as much as the loot. In regards to high level players not being able to afford to PvP, this is a little weird. If you can do zulrah, it's 2-3m an hour. When I occasionally PvP, I risk like 350k. I can afford to spend 6 minutes at vorkath if I die.
---
You have to ask permission?
---
Use runelite. Use OSbuddy if you want to pay for a client that has significantly less devs and just steals updates from runelite anyway.
---
Black dragon hide needs nerfing for its price and requirements. I shouldn’t be splashing a teleblock 3 times because somebody has 5k chaps on
---
When the LMS beta comes back try out hybrid pking on that for free. Its going to have another round of beta testing, then come in to the main game, so you’d be able to keep playing it and learning once it does. Other than that, just keep trying with pvp worlds, bh worlds, and wilderness. Make a low level pure account and just keep at it. You’ll die ALOT when your starting out, but eventually you’ll start learning mechanics and winning more fights.
---
You didn't count the shark drops, might aswell start over.
---
&gt; If you want an optimized acc put in the work. 
---
I can understand this, but isn't the main point of pking is the actual pking part not the acc building? I feel like streamlining the acc building process would just bring in more people to actually fight each other, especially noobs/ casual players who only play one acc.
---
Bounty hunter point farmers sat at extremely low combat brackets making it easy to pair up with their other accounts.
---
And due to the fact that you will no longer be able to get points if you are under 30 combat, this will severely mitigate the chance of bot farms. This is because other (actual) players will be able to match up with said bots, and because the farmers arent so low of combat anymore, it will actually be possible for those actual players to kill the bot farms effectivly. 
---
At about 40 combat you start to see some really powerfull builds that would make short work of bot farms.

Lava runes are the beat xp. Tele to duel ring. Tele to cw

Lmfao unless you’re from Venezuela or something I don’t think it’s possible to have the free time to play Runescape AND be hard-pressed to afford 11$ / month.
---
Seriously if you can’t afford 1 hour of minimum wage a month in most places how tf do you even have the free time to play this game? Wouldn’t that time be better used fixing your financial situation?
---
If you’re from the first world and unless you’re disabled and can’t work or a little kid who’s parents won’t let them use a credit card online I can’t see this being possible.
---
Hese a late game ironman who has gotten multiple onyxes for 3m gp. Barrows isnt really that ideal as money on an ironman becomes cake at high slayer. Thats all he said
---
I’m with you in this man. PvP in this game feels comparable to fighting a twink in World or Warcraft or getting invaded in Dark Souls. The average account in these situations is built specifically to fight in that bracket and puts the average person at a huge disadvantage. Since people are at that disadvantage it’s hard for people to get into it that are new and makes balancing difficult because every change can impacted one “bracket” in the dedicated PvP community in large.
---
Personally I see as PvP as tacked on the main game and it should be balanced around the rest of the games integrity. I understand that PvP is a major viewer source and community though so I understand their struggle.
---
I appreciate the heads up. Cheers mate
---
ah that's a shame, am at the point now of wanting to upgrade from Glory to Fury but am understandably hesitate too with how much of a bad investment it would be, for now Torture is unaffordable for myself too. 
---
Feel like I might be one of many players stuck in this predicament, I like your suggestions and hope Jagex will implement something along those lines.
---
[deleted]
---
I actually did the puzzle legit even though I had way more than enough money to comfortably afford losing 200k. Without runelite too, I never finished a puzzle like that before so I was like fuck it today is the day. Took me 20 mins tbh I was lucky I found the pattern quicker than I expected. Was very exciting tho
---
You seem a little angry buddy, upset your first post didnt get accepted because of your bad words? :( awwwww. You are garbage anyway. I'll be safe at tob making 10m+ an hour whilst you run around like an ape in the dead content known as the wilderness :). Also, because of your comments, I'll now be voting no on 5 of my alts too.
---
I PVM now. I use to primarily PK. I vote for whatever brings the most fun to the game without breaking it.

And for fellow pvm'ers. If you dont like that

No, not at all. Almost never worth it to sacrifice a defender for a shield while slaying
---
I've literally already answered this question like 3-4 times in this thread.
---
The No votes in all past pvp content polls. That's who. The idiot commenting "I'll just vote no on my rusher 🤷🏼‍♂️" is a prime example. No solid reasoning, no point made, just doing shit to do it. Because "we want their spades".  You must not frequent this subreddit if you think PvPers aren't spited by the majority in this game.
---
Per and each both mean the same thing, using them together is wrong, end of it. Also you chose to be offended by a simple correction, the only twat here is you. You need to work on your anger issues.
---
Will the rune pouch be tradeable?
---
Imagine insulting people on the internet over feedback.
---
If poor people plan on spending more than 2 hours a month playing Runescape it’s probably worth picking up a tiny bit of extra work instead of wasting all that time earning bonds
---
Increasing the value of slayer anywhere in the game, wilderness or not, falls into the “absolutely not needed whatsoever” category of updates OSRS is in need of.
---
This man is crazy.

I did you a favor of collecting all of my responses regarding this, not really sure where you think I sperged out. It’s okay that you guys want to be super defensive about some hideous monstrosity, you just don’t have to make things up to suit your perceptions.
---
“Haven’t played in months so whatever that thing is on the left (Assuming ToB reward) can go away until it gets redesigned, that’s just atrocious.”

“It looks like a super low polycount and even more demonic form of Queen of Pain from Dota 2.”

“Nothing else in the game is even close to being that visually offensive.”

“Lmao someone sounds offended over their precious little pixels, I’m not gonna quit a game because there’s an ugly ass pet that I never plan on getting.”

---
PvPers and PvMers are playing two completely different games, to be honest. PvMers completely act like it as well, and take every opportunity to talk shit/demean PvPers or "pures". 
---
You're just not seeing the point and that's ok. Jagex needs to see it though because this is important, whether you come to realize it or not.
---
Yeah but who is voting no? Isn't it the pve fellas?
---
I'm more okay with multi combat than I am with the pj timers in singles where people dd and you cant even see what's hitting you
---
Right, but what is the wilderness meant for? Originally what was the only area that allowed for pvp called? Yeah, the wilderness. Just because pvmers and skillers have some extra content out there now doesn't make it theirs. And it DEFINITELY does not give their opinion as much or more weight than an actual pkers' has in the area that is, and has always been, DESIGNATED for pking.
---
His point is if you buy bonds with gp, you're helping Jagex make more money
---
I’m not saying PvE is killing off pking. I’m saying a lavk of updates is, and a lack of updates is as a result of a lot of polls related to pking being voted against out of spite.
---
what does? The bulwark no longer being the only shield in the game that is nigh-unbeatable by all three attack styles?   
---
Gmaul being slightly less effective than it currently is in NMZ...  
---
Btws not being able to boost a runepouch anymore? \*GASP\*

Looks cool, probably awful to drag the mouse around though
---
Don’t fuck with a gamers pixel titties bro
---
this calculates odds based on stats nothing to do with pid
---
But WHY is having a ton of variants tacky? Why is having more options if you WANT them a bad thing? Nobody's making you use them yourself, and if you're complaining that you have to look at other people using them, then that's on you.
---
That aside, recolors/cosmetics aren't upgrades in any sense of the word, nor do they add to confusion in the game any more than actual new weapons and armour do (ACTUAL upgrades, to boot).
---
How hard is it to ask someone what an item is or how they got it? How hard is it to use google or read changelogs? If you really care about not being confused that much, you'll do your due diligence.
---
If not, well, you'll do something like asking about it. I did as much with the Odium cosmetic, and my takeaway wasn't anger at confusing cosmetics.
---
Did he now? Let’s see it!
---
Those are the worst that had been received. Worst possible should be a blank roll on everything. I'll have to tweet ash and reconfirm. It's been a few(like 4 or 5) years since he tweeted about it. He said something like the odds of it happening are more rare than getting two third age in the same clue.
---
Thank god for runelite this was ass
---
Why would skillers or pvmers vote no to the BH rework if it would drive some deep wildy pkers away to BH? They would only vote no to content that could be used against them, like the VLS.
---
Random reader here, you got whooshed.
---
That would require them to waste dozens of hours actually coding this content that probably won't end up in the live game.
---
The system works fine as is
---
I thought the message Jagex was trying to send was that good elves are white and bad elves are non-white?
---
That's the point. He just did the quests and that's his face when he realizes hes going to be spending the next few months getting to 99 RC.
---
Hello brother! We have the same tv :D
---
&gt;like the fact that participating in pvp implies actually pvping. Not running through a pvp area.
---
"Participating in PvP implies PvPing"
---
I mean, yeah? PvP = PvP. Duh?
---
&gt;Not running through a pvp area.
---
Right! Just being in a PvP area doesn't mean you're participating. You have to be in combat. If you're in player-vs-player combat, then you are participating in PvP.
---
You're right, the wildy doesn't belong to pvers. Nor does it belong to pvpers either, it's just a part of the game. And you're also right pvers shouldn't have more weight than actual pkers, thats why everyone's votes weight the same.
---
I voted to keep it all the way it is. Let's see how you people like it.
---
"Give us a reason to do Bounty Hunter that don't negatively impact gameplay, like cosmetics!" - the PvP community
---
"REEEE NO RECOLORS STUPID COSMETICS ARE CONFUSING MY APE BRAIN" - also the PvP community
---
How the fuck do you guys expect Jagex to fix your side of the game if you can't even figure out what you want?
---
Jagex failing? you mean the community failing?
---
warding got less yes % than sailing
---
Are these changes bad for PvErs?
---
I really don't get your points, if you prefer the original version of an item then that's fine! You don't have to recolour it, the whole point is that it's completely up to the player if they like it or not.
---
And there's nothing wrong with the graceful set, the only people who're really gonna get optimal use out of it are low-mid level ironmen who don't have access to higher tier energy pots. If anything stams are OP not graceful
---
Bloods are slightly less xp/hr for more gp/hr and less clicks to and from the altars. Don’t know the exact rates off the top of my head unfortunately but personally I just did bloods the whole time for the extra afk. Bloods you can click on the minimap and get to the altar in like only 4 clicks with a pretty afk run, souls you have to keep clicking to run because of its path.
---
is that the runescape 120hp cape but with black trim?
---
I didn't, but thanks for your input.
---
PvPers haven't been voting no on updates FOR them for the past couple years themselves dude. I don't know who it is - skillers, pvmers. But obviously PvPers aren't the ones cannibalizing their own polls. There wouldn't be so many complaints from PvPers when those polls went about not having a say.

I've gotten McDonald's for my friend and he forgot his walled so he OSRS mobiled me gp haha
---
imagine having to google the definition of a wimp to make your counterpoint
---
Did any of you actually read the post? They already said they will do a beta world for it..
---
I AM GRANITE MAAAN.
---
DWARF CANNON, SAFETY ALWAYS OFF
---
He probably has 200m rc
---
FYI: I did report this player. I merely wanted to share this funny, yet sad experience.
---
He's good cheap tank gear. Better that Dh if you're not going to use the set effect.
---
This sounds like an idea strait of out of a private server Manual
---
Good good
---
I sure hope so.
---
Not hard
---
Lets make it happen
---
Not a main
---
so that should be its only use?
---
If you want these changes to make the wilderness more dangerous, please do something to help clue hunters. That's the only reason I really go to the wilderness.
---
I didn't say anything like that... I said having the omni elemental runes barely saves inventory space. It saves no inventory space on ancients, and it saves 1 inventory space (air rune, water rune, or earth rune) for normals.
---
If you are a main you must have 99 in everything to be PVP viable.
---
Brutal black dragons?
---
Imagine if the bots didn’t exist and supply and demand went up for blowpipes to actually be priced near their usefulness.
---
To be honest if blowpipes cost 50m, I’d still buy one at that price. It gets way more use than my dwh.
---
Yea
---
Ork love me Today!
---
99 viriginity
---
Is it really like 90 logs an hour? Geeze
---
Harsh reaction but why you gotta do an Ironman dirty like that?
---
Nope. Nechryael in the Stronghold Slayer Cave.
---
two things lahey, put on some fucking pants. and fuck off
---
I remember I used to play a private server way back around 08 that had a chest up there that gave coins every so often, so I'd camp up there to earn money lol.
---
I’m going to vote no just because you are a massive douchebag
---
This is going to turn into RainbowScape if we aren’t careful...
---
They should really make the PvP polls only open to vote to people with BH/wilderness kills only tbh, because what all that stuff has anything to do with pvmers really
---
won't have time to do this for like a year + lol
---
Will we see ‘lore gaps’ filled? 
---
Corp beast and wildy bosses essentially have no lore or connection to the gameworld and it feels very private-servery.
---
Pking will never be as good as the era when it was just dragon longs/mace, granite maul and the original abyssal whip that had a 50% chance of doing a mix hit on special attack.
---
Put it next to your COD k/d ratio
---
Your wit is iron like curtain.
---
It wasn't intentional. I multi-task when I play, sometimes I make mistakes. It's a casual game for me.
---
Yeah that’s what I’m wondering.
---
Good suggestion. 
---
Infernal crystal equipment one day I'm sure.
---
I WANT A HALBERD-DAGGER
---
They’re not being polled my man, they’re integrity changes
---
My first OSRS chibi commission for /u/HCIMAlpha. :D thank you so much!!
---
Also the highlight of the manga, especially the latest chapter
---
Nice job censoring the Alch Yourself 👌
---
Runelite now shows how to do it. Makes it a tad easier lel
---
What new did it bring more outfit changes? A promise of old dragon weapons from like 8 years ago? All it did was change gmail's and bh which I didnt do because it was all rushers
---
. Dbows dds gmaul and other spec weapons.
---
Lmao  use the screenshot button
---
I think next episode will be the gauntlet
---
Omni runes are useless. Litetally useless. So you have a rune that takes up 1 inventory spot that gives you air, water, earth and fire. Please somebody give me an example of a situation where this would be useful? Entangle? We have mud runes. Tb? Doesnt use any of the elemental runes. Ice barrage? Only uses water. God spells needing fire and air? We have dust. Fire surge? Ur using tome of fire which gives infinite fire runes already. The only thing i can think of is people on ancients tribrid fighting could bring omni instead of water and be able to cast smoke barrage withiut bringing additional runes. But like, what the fuck is the point of smoke barraging someone. Its max normal hit is 27 and poisons only 4
---
You mean our wit is iron, like curtain. 
---
Welcome comrade
---
Dying = Bad
---
120 *
---
Cammy tele bc can buy laws in bulk just let it auto click 8 days straight or less. Got 1-99
---
Theres a tab feature in runelite that lets you make other tabs that appear on the left side of the bank interface.
---
 Say you want a farming run tab, you can tag the items you want (prob name it farming) and the stacks will appear in both the reg bank and your custom tab.
---
IDK back in the day I did all of my rlf clue puzzles takes like 2-4 minutes peek time 90 seconds but that is a good puzzle alignment was 12-16 btw
---
I don't think it's OP, it's just weird that it would come from PVP and then only work in the Wilderness.  
---
Put a high (higher than Wrath) level requirement on it and I'd vote it in.
---
You need as much food as you can get. Either way i still think you shouldnt be punished for using normals. More space needed
---
That’s completely irrelevant when everyone who uses one isn’t attacking back no matter what tank gear they bring. See all the “I can’t attack back I’ll get skull tricked!!!” comments
---
You vote no to everything well just be more “toxic” as you crybabies love to say.
---
Also I pk about 100M a week at rev caves in straight loot from pvmers so ty for that lmao
---
Update me in like a week if you get banned or not haha
---
My mistake. Sorry. Our mistake.
---
Instead you find a super computer running thousands of bots
---
Holy crap it really is that low. Tbh I came back from a break a few months ago and in my head it was still worth 100’s of mils
---
Yeah I wanna get back into playing p2p and am more then capable of sustaining a bond every two weeks. Just need the first XD
---
Couldn’t you just take it out first.? Drop the fake coins before you talk to him if you’re really worried. Pretty sure he doesn’t check your inventory though.
---
Alright, could I ask for some info? I'm not a PvPer, I'm not even much of a PvMer, I play this game quite casually in almost anything I do. I don't understand;  does using protect from magic halve the duration of bind, snare, and entangle in addition to the bonus chance of making those spells splash or does it halve it instead?
---
I could just as easily go read up on the wiki about this, but I would rather have a response here on the post explain it so that anyone else in my position could also quickly get the information they need to stay informed about the discussion.
---
🤔 i wonder
---
I lost my hc to crazy archeologist lmao
---
thx man! trust me if there was a better way to prove it I would lol, if there is a way to show my trade history though let me know
---
Guess you shouldn't have staked that 30m then huh?
---
Now kiss
---
If you do and need a group member hit me up: ChickpeaBae
---
DW about it man, what other people think doesn't always matter
---
Sorry I hurt your feelings. I'll be posting this every day in the hopes it gains traction, because I honestly feel that this update deserves it. So prepare to see a lot more of it.
---
so many e-thots on msn bro, shit was great
---
#bringbackmsn
---
Wym back in the day.
---
I still pay that fucker. Cba.
---
I think that it is fair to assume that bots own the g.e, they could lower or raise the price of anything if they really wanted to.
---
There's no bonus chance to make spells splash with you pray magic
---
You are grossly cynical.
---
Here is a wiki, start reading
---
Samsung 75ru7100?
---
It's also great that the nerf they settled on does virtually nothing to actually help singles pkers. Making it slightly easier to freeze isn't going to help much when you can't do enough dps for it to matter.
---
It was also a total misdiagnosis of the core problem with the wilderness, which is the risk mechanics. It doesn't matter _at all_ how much your top three items are worth if you aren't skulling, so anyone who can afford a bulwurk can use it all the time.
---
YOU ARE MA QUEEN https://i.imgur.com/CtULiM2.png
---
That's a long session, his firearms must be JACKED
---
Ahahahaha. Beggars have evolved into being on reddit as well.
---
Really though who the fuck stops playing every 15 minutes? You'd never get any game finished that way.
---
No, the issue is that ironmen were allowed to stake at all. That's the only thing they had to address.
---
Introduce them first to the sacred chicken pen. Its where all new players must go.
---
I just wanna sell these items and play p2p :( if jagex would implement the ability too sell membs items in p2p I wouldn't need this sadly
---
/r/2007scape is full of kids who started in or after 2009. They have no concept of danger.
---
If you didn’t watch MXC after a long session were you even old school
---
I do agree there is a huge grey area. Though I would argue that adding corrupt items would have an insignificant impact on anything but the pvp scene. Even if you could get the best dps using vesta's longsword as an extreme example, it would be so cost inefficient that it would stay a pvp niche.
---
Venezuelan is a nationality not a race
---
Super smash bros melee community would agree with this statement
---
How come you think it has to do with the hop limit? Just curious.
---
Click really fast and dont read anything..
---
I didn't know that either but according to the wiki: "It should be noted that Protect from Magic does NOT affect splash chance in PvP situations, and it only mitigates damage dealt. A consequence of this is that Protect from Magic does not make it less likely that Ice spells or Bind/Snare/Entangle will hit, but will make any damage dealt lower."
---
The reason there is interest in changing it is because Ice Spells don't have their freeze duration reduced by Protect from Magic but the Binds do. So if your opponent camps Protect from Magic, you'd be able to land a 7.2 second bind while you could instead land a 20 second freeze.
---
Thanks Jagex stepping up whenever the community, or I should say Reddit, thinks they're right but really aren't.
---
Lower the amount of Slayer points then or brainlet pvmers will never vote Yes
---
This discussion is so pointlessly hilarious.
---
Im sure when we all say no you'll ironically match your username.
---
I'll be voting no. The change would make getting a runepouch absolutely shit and kills incentive to do wildy slayer. Also voting no to the dumb cosmetic changes to iconic items.
---
Speaking of PVP changes and confusing players who are not familiar with PVP. Can the special attack orb be polled to be enabled in PVP zones? This was not polled specifically and most discussion about the topic seemed to be agreement that manually speccing is much faster and this would only serve as a convenience feature. Any player that uses the orb normally is surely confused whenever they do any form of PvM Wilderness content.
---
Then buy one. Go earn the money. 
---
It has nothing to do with selling members items. 
---
Your trying to get a bond like ~2m cheaper than the current value. 
---
Shit I can put a random cash stack in my invent and stand on a f2p world as well and beg poor.
---
It definitely has not solved the brutal black bots. I saw a bot with rank 100 ranging (180m+) exp botting at it yesterday with a rune crossbow and book of law. And regularly run into 2-3 bots per world. Sometimes they even will crash you when there’s already 3-4 people in the world. It’s actually extremely frustrating.
---
Thank you so much. I really appreciate your help!
---
Nize it
---
Any advice for f2p money makers?
---
To shatter their echochamber.
---
Did you ever pick up those NMZ boxes?
---
Mums credit card.
---
Pffft. Wouldn't be here begging for a loan if that was the case lmao
---
Just take that 2700k and buy some shit that is profitable to high alch. That's what I did when I came back to RS and was F2p
---
Depends on how they do them this time. I think they only said Corrupted Dragon, which were formerly F2P, and their degrading may work differently than the old ones... Though I would agree that stuff like that is more of a PvP-focused thing. Still, not everything in the poll will affect only BH so you can't put it all behind a BH req. And I feel like they can't block certian questions on a poll based on req; it probably would need to be seperate polls.
---
Hooray for discrimination*
---
Name a popular mmo where the player vs player isn’t completely different then the pvm. It’s always going to be a completely different thing to learn why is that bad?
---
Was it that fun getting 57 ranged
---
All they have to do to please me is allow us to put in parts of a set. It might take me 1k clues to finish collecting iron (g) pieces.
---
learning to blob flick is one of the most ocnfusing things in game. it seems so simple. you think you get it. you *almost certainly* do not get it lol.
---
Whays profitable?
---
As if any of you sweaty mongoloids ever even used that goddamn shield. Only places I have legit EVER seen it being used is at Dark Crabs/Black Chinchompas. It made you able to not risk anything and farm wilderness resources. They dropped the mage defence and that's it. Completely valid IMO.
---
im a btw and i agree
---
most btws are braindead
---
Wow, these are some terrible ideas for bounty hunter. You guys are over complicating this as much as you can.
---
Needs more jpeg
---
I actually didn't know this was (not?) a thing. Infernal variants are good for afking while gaining more xp.
---
Dude they have double XP streams on the OSRS Twitch page each weekend! All you have to do is log in with your account credentials on the OFFICIAL RS website that’s provided by a link! /s
---
Sorry but if you can’t afford 1 bond aka like $7 then you should probably re-evaluate what’s really important for you right now. 
---
At least your admitting your a crappy beggar now. 
---
Go join the rest of them on 301
---
Face it. No one listed a tbow for 14gp... It didn't happen. It was faked.
---
Literally setting yourself up for disappointment as an HCIM.
---
Btw? Sorry not familiar with that term other than "by the way"
---
I don't have any money until payday. Just because I'm off work and want too play runescape dosent mean I need too re-evaluate my priorities.
---
Yeah no thanks
---
First off id like a source on intended for pvp only usage champ then we can talk
---
For me, bossing on mobile is way harder.
---
Try zezima cc. Really good and knowledgeable people in there.
---
I'm not complaining about downvotes
---
 I'm pointing out your inbox downvote which is always a direct result of being upset. The fact is your first response to anyone replying to you is to spam downvotes. Why are you here? It's not for disscussion
---
Btw doing that cancles them out, So only 1 of my comments will get your downvote.
---
It's just really funny watching you get mad becuz someone dares reply to you on a social media thread! Like you even made a comment asking why people were replying to you. It's because you made a comment on an internet fourm made for disscussion. People are here to reply to each other.
---
I'm gunna block you now cuz you arnt actually disscussing you're just being mad
---
I definitely found it tougher personally, but the fact I was on the stairstepper while doing it was the icing on the cake for me
---
You sure got him
---
Hey look ran I'm mowing the air bud
---
Woosh
---
I've never seen it so I consider it OC. You go OP!
---
The purpose of the shield is to defend yourself. If you have it then you're not going to be attacking. If you want to fight against someone that has it then you should also have end game gear, which is hardly ever used. It's the same thing with someone trying to use crap mage attack gear and kill someone with black d'hide armor.
---
The shield isn't the issue. Yeah it's a lot cheaper than a lot of other end game gear, but its purpose is completely different as it's only a defensive shield.
---
I suck at pking but from what I've observed is that most pkers bring trash gear and expect to kill with that.
---
BIRD UP
---
Make it so Dinh's breaks on death and drops a bunch of gold.
---
You nugget.
---
Jagex don't need to stop the requests. They just need to let the actual player log-in, which they can do by verifying their credentials. And actually jagex implemented ddos mitigation quite some time ago, or did everyone stop noticing the constant downtimes?
---
Not sure, get it to about 30% and and can't seem to finish it
---
Enjoying runecrafting... damn. I wish.
---
Mod Ash must have 99 Slayer, his comments leave no survivors.
---
This is most definitely one of my favourite comments on Reddit
---
Get Corey and Trevor to do it
---
You probably shouldnt train the skill again. Even if youre not tryna flex the fact that you got it at such a low level, its just a shitty skill with not too much use aside from the pet. a lot of high level players still have level 1 so i cant imagine youll have a reason to train it for a while so you might as well flex your pet while at the level
---
That was hilarious, not a troll either, just incredibly dense
---
Just pull a Jagex and pass it as an integrity change then.
---
You don't use graceful set effect at blast furnace and boots of lightness and spottier cape are better than their graceful counterparts
---
I think you misspelled www.reddit.com/r/2007scape
---
It comes down to bots and alts. Take a look at edgeville bank and see how many low level accounts have absurdly high runecrafting levels.
---
Alching revenant bracelets charges with 1 ether
---
ZMI up to 77 and then bloods till 90 and souls from here on out is the plan
---
&gt;I'm pointing out your inbox downvote which is always a direct result of being upset.
---
Seemed like you were complaining about downvotes.  Also, downvoting from the inbox doesn't work.
---
&gt;The fact is you spamming downvotes cancles them out, So only 1 of my comments will get your downvote.
---
Spamming downvotes doesn't cancel them out.  I simply didn't downvote you anymore because I got the reaction I wanted from you with the first one.  You barely understand how reddit works, lol.
---
If you have 3x of a piece and roll a fourth, it will reroll as either a torstol seed or a magic seed I believe
---
degeneweit
---
Nicely done! Cool cape, that’s for sure!
---
Is there a link to a site for these?
---
What will happen to items such as the clue box and ring of wealth upgrade scroll?
---
These items are clearly not meant for Pkers but for their unfortunate “prey” locking these items in a store you need PvP kills for will give these items even less of a use...
---
And why not make the Omni tunes available to use outside of the Wildy too? This might provide some great profit for pkers that is not generated directly by alchemy in the store. The runes itself would save just a up to 1 invent space in PvM as combination runes and rune pouches already provide great benefit in PvM.
---
What's the point in the polling system is you're constantly ignoring it?
---
F2P Teleblock? Binding spell timers?
---
Even the way the Elf graphics were reworked was a load of bollocks. You changed the graphics of an entire race without poll, then told us we had to vote on a new one via a poll (bearing in mind "reverting to original" wasn't even an option on some of the votes).
---
Might as well just call the polling system Advisory at this point.
---
Woah this is actually the first smart take on “stop giving me the *option* to have better xp / drops by going in the wilderness reeeee” that I’ve ever seen.
---
I sorta agree with you.
---
Get t2 gear
---
What you’re talking about is 100% irrelevant to this post, so bravo, you got off topic
---
Ye man. Like agility you can watch shows while doing it. Just banking needs a little focus.
---
I have one of those ergonomic chairs that's like a mesh, so it doesn't smell that bad. Rips cape was done in early 2018, fsr's in late 2018, and o ly finished Sr today.
---
is that 3 champion capes? ffs
---
Stonk
---
Thank you very much!
---
DnD, clerics have a specialization in maces that lets them get a bonus on their attack rolls
---
Yikes that SD and HD option is nothing to do with what we are talking about. That's essentially equivalent to RuneLites Low Detail mode. All it changed was how much ground texture there was etc.
---
The HD rework came out in July 2008. That offered actual texture changes and a new graphics engine that utilised the GPU in your PC. They hired 30 new artists to do this change and it took 18 months.
---
Hardly a small thing. And I'm not saying I wouldn't want it if it was. The more options the better. The fact you're sitting here saying how YOU want the game to be is the right way and how I want it to stay is the wrong way is hilariously hypocritical. 
---
It's got nothing to do with wanting the option or not. Deciding to have it doubles the work for all future content, on top of requiring massive investment from the engine team and a whole group of artists to do it. We wouldn't see major content in that time. Id rather see new content to bring new players and keep existing, than a HD update that I don't think is as desired as you claim, nor as simple.
---
OP is a dick. Yeah you misclicked every single one of those nechs and ran away. Fuck off with your "it's just a prank bro" shit.
---
You just explain that scamming can happen. I would never recommend scamming a new player to teach him that scamming is possible. That’s not the fresh start someone needs to want to stay playing the game.
---
how much is that btw
---
I'm pretty well.
---
Let’s see them algorithms.
---
I find it enjoyable in moderation. Most people have super short attention spans though so they find it hard to enjoy anything. One of the reasons why some people say every skill is shit except slayer.
---
Yes sir.
---
Calling someone a nugget eh? Great way to demonstrate you have a good point and it’s not just stupidity behind your post.
---
You clearly know nothing about this scenario. What you’re proposing would allow people to bruteforce runescape passwords, making it an unfathomably stupid thing to suggest when they can just have people use emails for logging in.
---
There is nothing to unlock for players not liking PvP...
---
Go check political subreddits here and you'll find a bunch more people like that
---
Thank God for stretched fixed mode
---
On the default client the menus would be sooooooo tiny lol
---
Hmm I get two t2 pieces and leave one at t1 but maybe that extra one would help, if I have time
---
Demon butler can be upto i think twice as fast. When i did the calculations i think philias only saved like 400k or something for every additional hour you spend, so philias isnt worth your time as long as you have money makers above 400k/hr which isnt hard and you probably have if youre spending money on construction
---
Has to be the full set for the bonus
---
Good to hear, what was the longest dry streak?
---
Ik osrs has some official ones
---
Except several of these updates make it even easier for a PKer to kill a clue hunter. I’m not voting for things that make PKing people who are not trying to PK easier, that would be a bad idea.
---
Lmfao, the jump scare sound when he Gmaul’d that dude
---
