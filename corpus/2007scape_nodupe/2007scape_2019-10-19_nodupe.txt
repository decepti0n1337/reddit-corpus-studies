No ill will, but what encouraged you to start in '19? Seems like most are there for the nostalgia, myself included, so genuinely curious. PM me to be friends, again, no ill will. Just wondering the interest in 2007 scape

Yeah but jagex doesn't even bother

What's the point of beatboxing with both hands like that? I've watched a lot of professional beat boxers on youtube and they all go one-handed? Is this because females have a naturally higher pitch voice so they have to augment their sound with two hands to create more depth?
---
Also what does this have to do with a in-game clan?
---
Sit
---
Troll? Is that what you call trolling?
---
I remember when some news outlet ran pictures of some conflict, turns out they were pictures of ARMA II
---
was hoping for a real response as to why i'm wrong. disappoint.
---
I mean, there was a big poll with a bunch of potential rewards. Some good, some bad rewards, but it's not like you didn't see this coming.
---
Information on when it will be?
---
How do you explain the looting bag and rune pouch QoL poll that would be less of an inconvenience for everybody not passing? Or the Ags spec recolor being the only BH reward passing? Or the crab teleport being the only LMS reward passing in the second rewards poll? All these Pvp related questions failing polls in a row is too much of a coincidence. Yet these recent unnecessary quests pass with flying colors.
---
Sure, I haven't achieved anything :D It isn't hard work killing Zuk with a Twisted Bow.

Integrity updates go both ways.  The only way they dont go is new content.
---
You stole my rng!
---
Yeah on my UIM it's honestly the scariest shit risking all my herb exp.
---
Yeah I don't buy this. I used an ahk script to bot 99 agility that uses robotic mousemovements (the only randomness is the click area and the time between clicks) and didn't get banned.
---
What were you killing?

If pking was fun youd be doing it and not getting mad at a spadepost on leddit

I was also wondering what the pic had to do with a clan :D
---
Increase the droprate of keys, but only while on slayer tasks.
---
Give this man gold
---
Yo I’m MomsLasagna from that raid last night. If you want to start raidingI can teach you cox anytime.
---
You can only get them from a wildy slayer task...
---
Picture is for attention :D
---
Oh. Strange that they’re so shit then. I’ve only done about 10 wildy tasks but I’ve never seen one.
---
Sir, are you okay?
---
**Rune pouches will potentially become a lot more difficult to obtain. Make them tradeable and offer them for a reasonable price in the BH store**
---
Because emblems were originally transferable through death and later made tradeable the rune pouch has been a buyable since release. Pre-rework a 6 killstreak was sufficient to get you one pouch so the new cost should roughly reflect that. Even the most recent proposal of 75 points would make rune pouches far more time consuming to get than before.
---
**Poll some new rewards with a target KC requirement down the line**
---
So that people who do not like PvP will have to go out of their way to vote no and skip the question instead.
---
**Player bounties need to be reconsidered**
---
The idea in general is fine but some of the bounties are horribly out of touch with the PK meta. Lets look at them individually:
---
* Kill two targets without leaving, or going below level 1 Wilderness.
---
Luck dependent and abuse-able by using alts to give you supplies but otherwise okay.
---
* Kill your target using Ranged/Melee/Magic on the last hit
---
This one is good as it encourages variety. Getting a KO with magic is going to be the hardest one by far unless you're outlast fighting with TBs though.
---
* Kill your target while risking 250,000 GP (in coins/platinum tokens only)
---
This one is also fine as it rewards players for risking more wealth.
---
* Kill your target without using any prayers
---
Dead content. Only benefits account builds that do not have prayer because they don't have to forfeit a large chunk of their KO potential for no reason. Get rid of this, make it apply only to overheads or nerf it (see suggestions below).
---
* Kill your target without using a special attack
---
Does GMaul to any weapon without a special attack bar count? If not then it's another one that's impossible against anyone with a brain. 
---
* Kill your target without using Protect Item
---
This would be a good one if it actually did what it's supposed to (encourage people to use different weapons). All it's going to do is encourage people to unskull PK with 3 items which is no fun. 
---
* Kill your target without any stat boosts
---
Like the "kill your target without prayer" but even more out of touch because virtually everyone uses potions. Get rid of this or nerf it so it's not as crippling (see below).
---
Some ideas for bounties
---
* Kill your target without body/leg armour
---
* Kill your target with a specific KO weapon (requiring the stats and quests to wield said weapon to get the bounty; obviously only include weapons that are viable for PvP so a dragon mace would be acceptable but a bronze dagger not so much)
---
* Kill your target with the abyssal bludgeon special attack whilst skulled. Similar to the above except it would give more reward points due to the risk involved.
---
* Kill your target while risking a specific barrows set. Requires 70 melees, ranged and magic.
---
* Kill your target with residual damage. This would include vengeance, recoils and poison/venom.
---
* Die to your target. This one challenges your ego rather than your skill.
---
* Kill your target within 15 seconds of starting the fight. Toxic but it's an idea.
---
* Kill your target without using super potions. This is like the no-potions bounty but actually realistic. Since ranged does not have a super potion ranged boosting would be restricted to using wild pies (+4) instead. Magic boosting does not need to be restricted because no one does it. 
---
* Kill your target without using your best boosting prayers. This means eagle eye, mystic might, ultimate strength/incredible reflexes if you have all prayers unlocked. If you do not have rigour you have to use hawk eye. If you do not have augury, you have to use mystic lore. If you do not have piety you have to use ultimate strength, improved reflexes and rock skin.
---
* Smite your target (requiring 52 prayer)
---
I think a 350k or so risk at vorkath is risky enough. If a death were to cost over 3m or w/e you are thinking would be too punishable due to lags and dcs.
---
Holy cow, thank you so much for bringing this to my attention. I didn't know this method was that much better, since I play ironman and smith any ore I can get my hands on.
---
The effect of this is seen in more instances than just the price of ores. I see tons of accounts smithing gold bars into amulets or bracelets in F2P because the gold bars are so cheap. I don't know how many of these accounts are bots, but it seems a very easy activity to bot, which may be an argument for this being an integrity issue. 
---
Unfortunately, I believe it's too late to change this directly. It sounds like this has been the meta for three years now. 
---
I'm curious to know where all this gold ore is coming from. A possible work-around could be limiting the amount of gold ore available. If this was far, far more expensive than other smithing methods, that might be a way to limit this issue. There are other skills where the best training method is way above other methods, but just isn't feasible in the long run due to cost.
---
Also, do you know how this compares to smithing platebodies?
---
Q
---
I get what you're trying to say about bond babies (i assume), but this format ain't it. Taken literally, you're saying you gave someone some gp, a combat bracelet and an obby cape and they turned around and obtained full Bandos with what you gave them. That's a success story. In what way does this refer to credit card warriors? Billy should be holding a bond and a credit card in the last scene.
---
Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.

Hunter is my highest skill and main income method. I've always liked it
---
What’s your password I’ll do it
---
Do quests/diaries
---
How do you know you were being ddosed? Maybe it was just your internet? Just a simple disconnect doesn’t really prove anything...
---
I did this, its pretty high xp per hr honestly
---
You want to give players free xp for being in a different game mode than the regular game, or pay them to play Leagues. Did anyone playing DMM complain about bonding another account, paying two subs, or using their mains for DMM? No, they didn't.
---
No, we should not reimburse people's "opportunity cost" for participating in Leagues. You can choose to play, or you can choose not to. It's a cost benefit analysis you have to make for yourself.
---
Your solution would be akin to players asking for free xp because they spent all night playing Fortnite and forgot to do their herb runs. That's not Jagex's problem.
---
Oh shit. Redditor for a year. This is the real Zyzz. I knew you faked your death.
---
Any specific ones you suggest? Thanks for reply
---
Our god, unyielding jmod of Oldschool's Twitter, rise if you would... For that is your curse.
---
Granted, but turns out you don't grind that hard as you think in runescape and your life effort increases slightly
---
Let me make it clear: I was disconnect for about 20 minutes and once I logged back in I was at the ge, a different location from where I was before
---
Just happened again. Disconnected at mage training arena, reconnected at ge

How about you pm me your login info and i will have a look whats wrong
---
Might be engine work but wil forward this to Jed who will take care of it.
---
p.s bankpin
---
Yep
---
Swampman gud
---
this update has been such a trainwreck lmfao
---
Engine work
---
Well you did about all you could. Unless there’s something on your computer malware wise. Have you clicked anything fishy lately? Share the computer with anyone? Public open WiFi? Easy network password? Anyone else use the network that might’ve introduced it. Friends that play that might try to get into your account?
---
&gt; I know you've come too far already with this update, and even released a beta, but it's not too late to look back at this new emblem system. Please listen to the constructive comments in this thread and do not further ruin BH.
---
Please Jagex, don't pull an EoC on us. The players told you EoC was garbage, you released it anyway, and half the playerbase quit. Now this is nowhere near as impacting as EoC on runescape as a whole, but for the BH community, this will kill it and there will not be new players there to take their place. Pking won't die, but BH will.
---
ur 100% right, if u want a d pick on ur iron accept that u can die or use a rune pick
---
ppl here act like theyre forced to go the wilderness lmao
---
You'd choose which items to exchange for blood money.

Yeah, the examine option is cool on it

No to all

I dont click links/download pirated stuff. No friends play so that cant be the case. I also was instructed to unplug my router and modem to get a new IP address

Yeah bruh, where you been?
---
Fucking Diaries man... it's bad enough we have to grind out 175 QP that NOBODY wanted to do in the first place, and then go in circles for literally dozens of hours so our character can hop over a creek without BREAKING THEIR FUCKING NECKS
---
I'd imagine if his personal computer's privacy was compromised, there should be no reason why they aren't able to obtain his bank pin.
---
fuck pvm in the wilderness, i'm voting triple yes to see that gone.
---
Interface delaying?
---
this 100%. Why should we risk gear to make less money then PVM makes risking literally 0.
---
You need -64 bonus to always hit a 0 though and unless some new item has been added recently, the lowest bonus you can get is -62 on a level 3.
---
What was your preferred method for killing it?
---
lmao this is gold
---
you could have played, read, or watched the greatest arts of our time greatly expanding your brain and starting you on the path to the godhead. but u chose this.

---
I just sold 3a platelegs for 69m
---
what a funny and original joke
---
how do you do it ?
---
I agree with you 100% that the new Emblem system only serves to stratify the BH players and reduce the number of fights. However I think current system of using Emblems as points isn't very good either since Tier 2-9 Emblems are basically worthless compared to Tier 1 and 10. Once you upgrade an Emblem from Tier 1 to Tier 2 you are commited to going for Tier 10 since a Tier 2 Emblem is worth less than a Tier 1 so there is no point in upgrading an Emblem from Tier 1 to 2 unless you plan to go all the way. Also since the value of each kill increases up the Tiers for example the value difference between a Tier 9 and 10 Emblem is ~750K.
---
This means the only players that are getting meaningful value from the current BH system are the players that are able to get 9 kills in a row. Players that are learning or just starting to PK don't really get any value from the current system. They buy a Tier 1 Emblem from the GE for ~70K and lose it immediately or lose it after a couple kills trying to go for a Tier 10. With a points system they can slowly accumulate points even if they die more than they kill compared to hemorrhaging gold buying Tier 1 Emblems only to lose them trying to upgrade them.
---
Book of law is probably the only useful off hand book these days. (unless you are a pure) The stats are solid  for its price, and you don't lose it. All the other books are outclasses, or out priced a lot easier by their style's alternatives.
---
That's a photo booth but they did pitch an idea for osrs to have a selfie cam to take a picture your character  like the way you'd take a selfie of yourself on real life but players thought it was too dumb.
---
as a non pker i would very much love this
---
un-fucking-playable

Personally, I don't think so.

It's a decently fun mobile game. Way to much on the open the app here's 15 mtx options. But zombies will be fun.

Are you sure? I can't seem to reproduce it.
---
Alphabet guy.

A common meme in RS3, which fits in this situation is......”requires engine work”
---
Yes
---
No, "the" shouldn't be used to alphabetize usually.
---
lol why think when you can just post
---
I have two or three green from the last year at least but I feel it too
---
Unless it was changed again, if you hit a monster on the tick it spawns you don't get xp for that hit - therefore can do cannon damage without gaining xp.
---
You can check the official forums for clans advertising. Probably the easiest way of finding a clan for a specific activity (pvp, pvm, etc)
---
If you only want to chill and participate on events every so often, socialscape is a pretty cool one.

Is this coincidental? It looks pretty scale to scale.

I can't upvote you enough. Agreed.

Literally right below that google definition it says

“deprive (someone) of a right or privilege”

We as PvPers don’t have fair polls if  literally thousands of people are voting in polls and saying they don’t like PvP. It’s plain and simple. PvPers are the disenfranchised voters, not the majority who want to deny content to the minority because they died in the wild once.
---
Looked it up, it’s intentional
---
[removed]
---
That’s fucking cool. I’m from Wisco so the show has always had a soft spot for me.
---
It handles really well on the touch screen controls. I would advice against trying to add controller support and just commit to it. It feels better then a controller over time, it's just you have to slightly change how you play.
---
Don't use the auto shoot mode, set it to manual, and only use the aim stick that fires while you ADS. You'll have to play aggressivley, but the other alternative is so learn how to play claw.

I got 5 d meds, 1 jar, 2 celatrus and 1 redwood, over 15 spirit seeds (supposedly 1/1500) ,over 20 rune sq shields, over 20 rune battle axes and 3 skeletal visages in 4300KC and still no pst. Anybody know why RDT and spirit seeds seem way more common than what’s indicated? It seems super unlikely to get multiple 1/2000s over 20 times in 4K kc.
---
Why would they? You cost basically no time/resources to kill and there is the chance you brought your cash stack or all your teleports
---
I'm not sure the exact amount from 77to 99 but I do have kebos elite done and some came from slayer and barrows
---
This just in: *I'm an idiot*

---
disagree. hard/weird questions get skipped and its easier to pick them up and answer them when its sorted like this.
---
why censor your name?
---
It’s such a dogshit plan and they’re actively trying to pull an EOC on us with these shitty integrity changes and not planning or discussing it with the community before implementing these updates. The BH emblems are the first example of this that we’re going to see and it’s going to be so bad and it’s bleeding into wildly slayer now too.
---
They should be able to make the poll pvpers specific, like having a bare minimum of 20 BH kills so the poll doesn’t get flooded by the rest of the game’s population to vote no on everything.
---
Mainly applies to people who grew up in shitholes tbh
---
Rings of recoil? I remember way back in the day a lvl 3 with fairly high slayer and that's what he was doing.
---
They’re from Wisconsin, cheese is famous there
---
Dragon diamond bolts have 122 ranged strength vs 105 ranged strength on addy diamond. That’s a difference of 17 ranged str or 4 max hits aka huge difference
---
Once again the PvP community proves itself to be toxic af, I feel bad for the mods having to trawl through this thread and commend them for even trying. 
---
Everybody seems to be bitching about lack of rewards so I got an idea for a reward: a scroll that unlocks a spell that combines tele-grab and high-alch so you can high-alch loot straight from the ground with only two clicks. Make it so every scroll is good for set number of casts (100 or something) so the scroll keeps its value. 
---
To avoid the spell-book getting too full and cluttered create a "hide" button next to the filter button in the spellbook tab so people can customise their spellbooks more accurately than with the filters alone.
---
&gt;	Wisconsin is known as "America's Dairyland"[10] because it is one of the nation's leading dairy producers, particularly famous for its cheese.
---
The show takes place in [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin?wprov=sfti1).
---
If people can get 450-500k xp/HR with oak doors then settling for 550k for a method that is twice the price should make you rethink your cost efficiency calculations.
---
Whats stopping you from getting membership'
---
Assuming you don’t have black d’hide on, the time and minimal resources it takes the pker to kill you are worth it for the chance you accidentally brought your cashstack or were brazen enough to bring all your clue hunting teleports
---
&gt;  I still think I’d prefer it if you had to play them all though, at least a bit.
---
Going from a system where we barely have to play any to where we have to play all would suck.
---
How did you die to steel dragons.
---
They’re steel dragons, you shouldn’t be in melee range and an antifire + anti dragon shield and/or mage prot should outlast the PJ timer.
---
Made the wc pets for Inktober (Day 9 Swing).
---
nah that would be useless
---
Thanks homie :)
---
I wouldn't have voted for those skills either. You asked for a reason and I gave a very valid one.
---
Exactly!! Pvmers get some of the best money making methods in the game, a lot of which are so brain dead you can literally do them while multi tasking like zulrah or vorkath. Pking being arguably the thing that requires the most skill in the game is pretty impossible to make bank unless you are extremely good. Pkers don’t want these special items or dumb cosmetics
---
I’m 86 combat and have the 3 GM’s left - which fight did you find most challenging?
---
Me right now.  Have no desire to re continue the grind on a main but twisted leagues is looking up my alley
---
I think that's what he did my man
---
Confirmed 100% drop rate.
---
Is the osrs wiki really that incorrect? Why doesn't Jagex just give us a DPS/hit chance calculator, among other stuff. 
---
So does accuracy bonus not matter because crabs happen to be level 1 defense, +0 defense bonus, or both? If they were level 2 defense +0 def bonus, or level 1 defense +1 or higher def bonus, then would accuracy bonus matter? I'm confused.
---
Makes me sad look at that low kc
---
You suggest making more build variety but also suggest making it less worth to be lower combat so you are promoting being 126...  
---
U also suggest that melee and range are OP. They both arent strong enough. 18k and a dinhs is enough to tank a full tb vs a bis gear guy no matter what he does.
---
I agree that the rewards and the gp/hr needs to be improved but I also think its a good thing they are separating the Emblem and BH Points shop system. They just need to increase the points for streaks, rebalance the cost of rewards in the shop to improve the gp/hr, and rework the new Emblem system.
---
Orrr make every world PvP world. Problem solved. Thanks me later guys 👋

Lmao i literally just watched this show while farming cowhides

This is one of the best ideas I've heard on here in a looooong time. This would be a 10/10 update
---
Isn’t this like a literal 1/1,000,000+ chance?
---
u know literally nothing of the game lol
---
Because a scroll that refreshes your mage cape spellbook swaps makes the already retardedly broken mage cape swapping ability even more overpowered
---
Or because adding rune pouches specifically to make a PKer's inventory management easier give an even more significant advantage to the PKer
---
Or maybe because ancient warrior equipment is retardedly overpowered and having a weapon that can hit 70s while ignoring your defensive gear is busted
---
The recent PvP suggested rewards are just too strong or give too much of an advantage to PKers.
---
We’re not even posting 99’s now for cheap gz’s? We’re going as low as to post 98’s?

---

---
TIL 2 hours &lt; 1 hour
---
that's not accurate either, it costs 830gp for a teak plank on a good day, making it 2490gp/300xp which is a bit more than 8 gp/xp
---
Ok ok ok, auto clicking is macro-ing, agreed, but if we're being serious here about game integrity and keeping the game relevant in an ever widening pool of other "I'm in it for the grind" games, maybe we need to have a conversation about building in some sort of extreme afk grinding method FOR those activities that are most auto-clicked. 
---
For example, show me a person who says alcing for XYZ hours is good game design and I'll show you a liar. Nobody is "playing" runescape while they bandstand alc, they're either sacrificing attention to something they do enjoy (show, movie, etc) or being bored. Why not just cut the bull and make alc 1 click to start the repeat alcing. Hell, a perfect way would be to make alcs take [whatever it is now] per alc when done manually OR twice that time if auto doing it. 
---
For agility there could be a course that lets you click once to enter, then auto moves your character. Make the xp rates shit, like 5-10k an hour. Thieving could have a 'magical thieving dummy' that lets you auto pick a pocket for 0gp and man-level xp rates. I could go on but you get the point.
---
Ideally all these methods would just require some attention from the player once every 2-4 minutes
---
Those guys usually end up RWTing their banks back.
---
This deserves a frame. Even digital.
---
Roughly 45000 people have 99 wcing, this isn’t even 99, it’s just a low effort post
---
You could try giant mole, and maybe sarachnis. Not sure how much profit either of those is, but they're the other bosses with similar requirements to barrows, iirc. Next after that would be trying DKs, I think.
---
No
---
Hah i hang in there but its hardly a organized clan
---
Nice man! I'd be way to scared to try obor on my f2p hcim lol but hes still a noob. What combat?
---
Yes, how many people graduate high school. How many people post their graduation online.
---
Are you really comparing getting 99 woodcutting to graduating college LOOOOOOOL
---
Yeah. You should be building your last table right before the butler returns with your planks. If the butler come back before you run out of planks you’re going to slow
---
Just chiming in to remind you that no matter how right you are (which I'm not sure you are), no one will care if you're a cunt about it.
---
That's true for early questions in the thread. But if it's asked later, fewer people will scroll that far. That makes it less likely the question will be seen by people knowledgeable enough to answer/ curious enough to research and report back
---
Just a random thought but did you update after you installed it? Sometimes when installing apps you get the base version, so after you'd want to type "sudo apt update" then "sudo apt upgrade" if anything needs updating.
---
lol i got 2k kc with the plug in. gonna need to get used to not having it but its not that big a deal
---
That was the point. I'm not sure why I'm being down voted, OSB was one of the audited clients (along with RL) and there were many other clients adding absurd things that would never be allowed in "fair" clients. OSB can't add the same plugins without losing their legitimate status and they can't force other clients to remove them. Their only solution was to force a firm stance from jagex and it completely worked. They were intentionally pushing the limits of 3rd party clients. They were even taunting jagex on Twitter by teasing op plugings with the threat to release them in quick succession. They absolutely forced jagex to take a firm stance for the sake of either their bottom line or because they value game integrity (probably a mix of both but mostly the former).
---
Nothing wrong with it,  torso has shit defence so keeping the d legs and getting bandos top instead of tass is fine...
---
maybe. i know that i personally look for unanswered questions when the thread is old and i think the format helps. it probably wouldn't matter either way if i was looking for unanswered questions i guess.
---
Specifically you need a Scroll of Redirection, which is 775 Nightmare Zone points. Take a day, grind a few hours of NMZ, and just get a bunch of scrolls to keep in the bank. Pull one and a house tab out every time you need one (b/c you don't want to make a stack of one kind and then realize you also need another) and boom, fast tele to every house portal in the game. Great for Vorkath too, if you don't have your house there.

With high 90s ranged, range pots, assembler+anguish+mith darts and +10% range pray, I was averaging around 13 scales per shaman kill. Excluding dupe uniques, each zulrah kill gives ~170 scales (unless you're using serp, in which case it's like 120-130 scales/kill). I did over 10k shaman kills in under 600 zulrah kc for my hammer.

Are you kidding. Getting op rewards with the constant risk of being pked is insane fun, no other mmo can other this style of fun. No other content in rs is this risky or engaging. You and everyone else need to get over the fear of being killed or stop with the entitled attitude. I get my thrills from clan vs clan fights, but love doing wildy slayer or a bit of revs, the risk makes the game exciting, 99% of pvm in this game is a fucking yawn that i can do with half an eye open while falling asleep.
---
Also tbh ganking people has been fun on every mmo forever to the point it is a core part of pvp in every mmo or at least should be. The amount of pkers i have killed by fighting back while doing wildy slayer or imbued capes is insane, as the pvmer you have a massive advantage of inv space and gear. I wish jagex hadn't pandered so much to the carebears of this game over the years so this mentality wouldn't exist.
---
Yep, wont even deny it.
---
The worst part is im just doing slayer at lava dragons, not taking any gear, using salamander. Running the entire way there. Burying my bones, and not picking up any of the loot.
---
Last run i legitimately left a rune long on the ground because i knew id get pked and didnt want the pker getting the loot.
---
"Why am i doing wildy slayer then" you ask?
---
I just wanted to try it and now im stuck with 57 lava dragons. And i dont want to lose my streaks.

---
Pretty much, i just get wrecked by level 95+ mages. And its not even close to fun. Its like they spawn and if i dont log out in time i might aswell just eat all my food, and bury any bones before my death.

thanks, actually gud opinions, iphoners npcs  butthurted and downbotting

It's easy but fun. I prefer puano for a challenge but i can also play guitar. It really isn't any harder than bass.

So you mean you want to train skills and not moving your mouse. There's like 1 skill that you can train which is not requiring to move your mouse which is thieving.

because you will get cosmetic rewards?

If you're a iphone user you can probably get away with using your old iphone until the new one becomes affordable to a real human being. They seem capable for 90% of use cases, I wouldn't think you need the new one to run whats app, or reddit. Hell most games probably run just fine on older ones.

It only changed this week, you're G.
---
I wrote a long post countering all your suggestions but realized how dumb it is to argue these points.
---
If you want to remove PVP just get to the point and say it instead of beating around the bush and suggesting to completely neuter it.
---
Wilderness is fun, your suggestions just remove any sense of risk there is, let alone the fact that the wilderness has been an integral part of old school for literally ever.
---
One thing though, just think about how dumb it is to vote against PVP content that incentivizes real PVP vs the cat and mouse PVP you hate.
---
The wilderness is exciting. It can be extremely profitable as well, you just have to navigate it to the best of your ability and accept that dying is part of the game. I actually wrote all this [while in the wilderness training slayer.](https://i.imgur.com/hEFeoBG.png)
---
You made my day saying that :)
---
That doesn’t mean anything.
---
I'll elaborate for you...
---
Git gud at PKing or running away.
---
I don’t get the point. Glory’s are never going to change in price, why would a pker wear one? (NPC’s being able to agro you save your life occasionally)
---
check in phone settings for something about background apps
---
I would like to throw a completely different design for BH out there and maybe some others can build on it.
---
Idea number 1:
---
Have the BH be similar to PVP world in that the whole wilderness is restricted to say +-10 combat levels, the wilderness is split into different sectors, instead of being assigned a specific person you get assigned to go to a sector of the wilderness. This would combat bots as they wouldn’t be able to hide in a corner of the wilderness as they’d be constantly assigned different section to go fight in and their account could be killed easily by other players.
---
Idea number 2:
---
You could have a task system that has to be completed in the wilderness, some examples could be
---
Get an X kill streak
---
Survive a TB
---
Kill 100 monsters of X, combat and above (a task like this would give you a pvm option for bh points, while also incentivising pkers to go hunt/ tb these players) 
---
Kill a player above level 30 wilderness 
---
- side note this may need NPC’s in single zones to be made non aggressive to make it harder to survive pkers hunting the pvm bounty hunters
---
Just a couple rough ideas that could provide an interesting alternative to what has been thrown out there in the latest beta.
---
Please feel free to expand on this idea if you like it
---
C H E S T B R A H
---
In addition to normal trees and fruit trees, I would strongly recommend doing hardwood trees on Fossil Island (if you weren't already going to do them!)
---
The seeds are extremely cheap and although they have a long grow time, the xp is really good. You can do teaks from 35, then mahogany from 55. You can always boost using garden pies to plant a higher tier of tree for more xp too, which is nice as the garden pies are so cheap.
---
Well I fore one am okay with this scheme to siphon more money from us. It's better then the alternative.
---
A reflection of human depravity
---
Fair enough i was just curious if they would do anything. From what most the player base tells me its a no, which is fine just curious.
---
Don't apologize for people being salty
---
It should ignore the word The and order from the next letter. Which is F
---
Dude's a doosh for doing you like that.
---
No, members items are stripped of all their properties
---
mate i literally spelt that out. just to reiterate, it doesn't matter if you have to bot up the stats as long as you are replacing the bots as they get banned. so a proper bot farm will always have 30 zulrah bots running. They don't wait to get banned then train more, they're training more for when they eventually get banned
---
Will do, thanks.
---
Money is better spent on things like Zenyte jewellery, 83 con and rigour
---
For real. They need to streamline getting looting bags again. I don't want to have to kill 4 people or 50 rats to get a damn bag.
---
Youre allowed to cry after staking 30m trying to make up for that.
---
Not a staker, but I feel that!
---
The real question is what the hell did he even do after he stopped being qna live stream manager guy?
---
Like we got a new pvp expert making leagues and stuff. I thought archie was doing that stuff? I'm confused but as far as I remember he was in charge of dmm events and stuff? Is that just out now? Did he really get fired or was that post that you and I both seen just an elaborate happy birthday meme?
---
I didn't see that post. I was just genuinely curious because he was the J Mod I never liked.
---
all is fair in love and war i suppose. I did however learn that next time i create the server then give ownership after payment.
---
If you're using runelite (this might be too simple of a solution, but you never know), make sure you right click and hit reset on the XP tracker. It tends to track for your entire playtime, not just when you're training the skill.
---
I anti-pked someone at the wc guild for 23 mil. Just keep a dds in your inventory and pay attention.
---
It runs in the family kid
---
Pvmers are not forced into wildernes, get your weak ass shit arguments out of my face you little billy goblin shat
---
My morry taint ya locked steel man.
---
Keep an eye on your account. Might see a few extra mill go into your cash stack and see your stats magically rise one of the days
---
Have you reset your runelite tracker? What sort of xp drops are you getting in game (the ones that come up on the top right of your screen)
---
Yep resetting it worked. Sorry for the newbie question!!! thank you!
---
Fixed it, thank you!
---
There is little reason risk emblem now, why not change it to when you are risking emblem you get roll on rare wilderness weapon/armour/or whatever table 
---
This could be something like: 
---
T1 emblem costs 100k, when u kill someone with emblem u get 75k and roll on rare table (1/600) 
---
T2 emblem costs 200k, when u kill someone with emblem u get 150k and roll on rare table (1/300) 
---
T3 emblem costs 400k, when u kill someone with emblem u get 300k and roll on rare table (1/150) 
---
T4 emblem costs 800k, when u kill someone with emblem u get 600k and roll on rare table (1/75) 
---
T5 emblem costs 1600k, when u kill someone with emblem u get 1300k and roll on rare table (1/50)
---
This can changed and is only example but this way every weapon acts approx 15M gold sink and the one who gets kill even without rare drop gets good ammount of gold and reduces boosting
---
All good mate you were asking a genuine question. Try to keep aware of what information you're receiving from the game and what's coming from runelite itself, a lot of runelite related issues are a simple fix by resetting the plugin (e.g. missing !kc commands can be fixed by checking your boss log on a ring of wealth or by killing the boss again in runelite). Happy scaping!
---
&gt; Poll some new rewards with a target KC requirement down the line
---
&gt; So that people who do not like PvP will have to go out of their way to vote no.
---
No. If the rewards can be used elsewhere everyone is affected not just PKers due to the wilderness. If you want people who don't PK to not have a voice, limit the rewards to only be usable in BH wilderness and PvP worlds.

Abyssal dagger would probably be better dps, since you can use ddef its total stats are 98/81 vs 82/82 of sara sword. The 1 str bonus most likely won't outweigh the extra 16 atk bonus.

the fact i have 99 agility and still can't access every shortcut is so triggering. there's an extremely marginal benefit to 99 agility in the first place so ive never understood why the one interactive part of the game having to do with agility couldn't be fully integrated into the skill. because it's not just one or two, it's a lot of them

How...  How are you getting slayer xp without combat xp?

Add in herb runs along with the other mentioned tree/teak/mahogany and fruit tree runs. The xp adds up nicely and decent cash too
---
Maybe not this specific topic but they do send legitimate emails. That's how you tell fakes from real ones. Real ones will also have a copy of the message in your game inbox on the runescape website.
---
I suppose these type of emails do work in the odd occasion. For little 10 year old Timothy on his dads computer after school and starts panicking when his mom tells him he has an email for the game he plays and that is may get 'disabled'.
---
Great, now grab it and lava maze tele, thanks.

This is part of the reason I quit OSRS after coming back from an 11 year hiatus. People take this game too seriously to ruin it for others and just straight up cheat and exploit, from bots, to AFK methods being exploited, to macroing, everything they can do to be 'better than you' or 'richer than you' or whatever the case...is the only reason they play. It's a toxic shit-storm and people like this ruin OSRS for people like me. I don't even care if this gets negged into the ground, it's stuff like this that made me quit.
---
Unless your bank fits in one window and keep it next to the deposit button, yes.
---
Should have went to corp for b2b ely
---
You little goblin shat I never said "Pkers arent toxic", they are, however you room temperature digit IQ pvm/clue scroll hill giant turds who cant fucking read a warrning and get mad that they get pked cuz they didnt bring gear to fight back or dinh to tank.....
---
At least im not a fucking stalker
---
I've been everywhere and thus I get this reference
---
Because the rewards are mostly cosmetic so there’s no real reason to play it asides from 1 game from ironmen wanting the stuff for greenmans ale (m) and even that’s optional.
---
Pkers don't know how to get to Barrows
---
your toxicity is whats causing pvp polls to fail and i enjoy it. Go ahead and treat pvmers liek shit and go see what happens with polls, clearly it hasnt worked out has it?
---
After all, pvp  is almost fully dead and you can only blame yourself for it, cause us pvmers will have some nice peace and quiet away from you toxic loudmouthing pieces of garbage im sad to call humans
---
&gt;As you progress your account you should become more and more ashamed. If you're 100+ combat or 1600 total you should use the most obscure banks and skilling methods. By the time you hit 1900 total or 100m xp, you should be instantly logging out if you see someone else. And if you're 126 combat or 2100+ total, never leave your PoH.
---
Upvote of shame from me sir.

It's a struggle lol
---
prob getting pegged by chad

thanks! between a rock brought me here haha
---
I believe in the original post regarding the Twisted League or in that section of the runefest stream they said it is like dmm, you are in a specific world set up for the league so you can't be in another world at the same time playing the main game on your account

What would be next if the player clicks on the APPEAL button?

Didn't mean pun, I meant reference fml
---
That would be all well and good... If the bank weren’t literally 1 step away. It’s just an inconvenience at the GE. Coin pouch doesn’t have to be added, just give the GE the option to check bank for coins so I can buy a rope and wooden chair without needing to close an interface, open another, find coins, close interface and open another without even taking a step to do all that, every single time. Would have zero drawbacks, and would be one of the most loved QOL updates for sure.
---
What was he even doing here in the first place haha

I’ve personally sold him at least a few hundred with absurd prices put in lol

How long did it take to teach yourself this?

Maybe we can pay a certain amount of gold for a newsletter subscription, and everyday the newsletter will be sent to our POH, we could build a mailbox next to the portal inside.

It’s pretty easy when the update is pvm cantered tbh

Lost intrest to play osrs atm.
---
Set up a cannon at slayer monster. Interface stall to not shoot the cannon untill you are inside LMS, equip range gear in LMS. Grats, you're 99/1 range with good range bonus, and your cannon is killing mobs for you while you arent getting XP for it since you're in LMS.
---
You know what, you wont get slayer XP(cuz lms) for that I'm dumb. Its a cool method though so I'm still posting the comment. See rendi's latest vid for details.
---
Yeah right? Can’t wait haha

Or maybe just change that u can change key to RoW imbue or like that because they were 1 emblem = RoW imbue now it would be more rng from random drop table from drop or Larran key

Simple prove why that's not how it works:

Imagine someone with 10m kc. According to you that person would have a higher than 1 or 100% chance of having the pet, which can't be.
---
Tbh if I had to bet on it I’d say neither will
---
His entire story makes him a creepy stalker.
---
First my man sais he doesnt follow her but then proceed to search the entire osrs twitch page just for her, proceed to google all her social media including private instagram accounts my man knew the times she streamed out of his damn head yet he claims to not follow her or watch her rarely.

All wilderness mobs drop it at a 1 in 30 chance. Best bet is the thugs in edgeville dungeon. They're quite weak and easy to kill.
---
It does kind of matter though. He had 7 rolls to try and achieve this. 1/9m is the probability to get this drop in 2 attempts.  On each kill you have a 1/3000 chance for the pet and a 2999/3000 chance to not get the pet. The chances to get 1 pet in 7 kc is pretty straightforward: 1-(2999/3000)^7. There are 6 ways a back to back pet drop can occur in 7 kills.   
---
  
---
Possibility 1: pet on kc 1 and 2 has a probability of (1/3000)(1/3000)(2999/3000)^5    
---
Every other scenario has the exact same probability since there are always 5 events where you don't get the pet and 2 events that you do. So the exact probability to get a back to back pet drop within 7 kc is:  
---
6(1/3000)^2(2999/3000)^5 ~ 6.66e-7 or about 1 in 1.5m.
---
It is. Rookie boat requires level 40 and I'm pretty sure slayer xp isn't even on the rewards table.
---
Yeah after 20ish kills you will know when to move
---
If you get your range up to 75, you could learn zulrah.
---
He might get lucky and get 500m doing this! Although I don't think C Engineer was ever going to actually wc there.
---
I would honestly be incredibly flattered. All these random people showing this amount of appreciation for me for just doing my job. When you’re coined “god” you know you’re doing something right.

Fake emails can say they're from blue Hornet but you have to check whether that has been verified or not.
---
Would make sense, but I don't think it is needed
---
Relics, nice.
---
Void stuff is super boring. Going back soon for my mage helm and elites and not looking forward to it.
---
Don't forget being able to attack pures on a max main in edgeville by getting a target as a pure then changing your stats.
---
The easiest one to mess around with is right by the entrance. If you pull Corp to the NW corner, next to the door (in the corner) the first tile inside the Corp room, south of the Corp, is what we call a “cold” tile. This tile has very low priority for the Core. 2 more tiles East (so 3rd tile from entrance) is a “hot” tile and has almost 100% agro for the core.
---
In practice, my friend stands on the South side of Corp, while I stand on the East side, making Corp blocked into the corner by the entrance and can’t move. When my friend wants to spec, he just moves to the first tile next to the gate, and the core will 100% of the time attack me. When he is done specing, he can move to the 3rd tile and the core will go back to him. We can alternate who the core goes to by stepping in and out of the soft and hot tiles. I’ll try to get a screenshot with marked tiles so this is easier to understand.

They are making these changes to cater to eliminate gold farmers in bh. I repeat, they are not catering to the actual pkers. I thought you all realized this months ago???

99 crafting tele to the guild is easily the best teleport for most activities, 91 prayer gives you..... A bit more points when you drink a potion.

The obvious answer is to stake it and get neither of them.
---
I dont think he's talking about mage splashing, he's talking about hitting 0s with melee
---
Is it just one image? Could you imgur it? 🤯
---
The eternal bh problem:
---
Pvp profit has to be limited so it doesn't get out of hand, which in turn makes it harder for average pkers and noobs to enter the pvp scene. The good pkers get even better, dominate even further, and you'll end up with only "the best"; the people who can 1t gmauls while being on the move using msb, the on point tribrids etc
---
Of course it's fair etc, won't argue that, but there's a clear problem in the endless feedback loop that's created.  There has to be a reasonable way for "noobs" to enter pvp without having to either max or make a new account. I'm not saying they should make money, but at least entering the wilderness for a minute shouldn't be a death sentence, where you consistently lose 2m/h
---
You're ignoring the post. If you don't like the discussion, just downvote and move on. The point is to have a discussion as to whether the OSRS Quest Guide from the Wiki can be improved. Strictly following the OSRS Wiki, this post is not helpful as the OSRS Wiki provides no direction as to get a games necklace or its recommendation for Imp Catcher is solely to buy the beads at the GE. So either the Quest Guide is incomplete or the supporting documentation is incomplete. Either way, there would be improvements needed in the wiki.
---
The quest list is based on having a fresh account and with this guide it is minimal training to get qpc, I'm an uim myself and used the list for the most part. Much more important is that you Google which quests you need to do first like recruitment drive because you need to be naked for those or others which travel you to entrana. Do those as much first, then look at the guide and see where ur at.
---
You know, I was thinking...
---
According to the Lunar quests, the Fremennik are responsible for destroying the runecrafting altars across the world, yes?
---
... So how did they bust up the death altar and cosmic altar? There's no way they could have reached either of those.
---
Thanks Freeze!
---
Awesome to hear. Good person.

Why ring of life and defense cape?

Is there an item that breaks even on its own price and also the rune price?

I just got a different phone a day ago and am struggling to log into my RS acct since replacing my phone. I'm unsure if I got hacked or if authenticator isn't working as intended but I can never log in. Always get reprompted to re-enter authenticator too. My pass hasn't changed in over 5 years and I haven't shared acct info with anyone. Been a player for 10+ years wondering what I can do.
---
The email acct that's linked to my RS subscription payments is the email that I had authenticator verify. I don't remember the email that my RS acct primarily uses since my acct is old enough to be logged via username. I'm uncertain if I used authenticator incorrectly and its preventing me from logging in or I was hacked. Idk if this bit of info helps, but this is the first time in 3+ years I've upgraded my smartphone so prior to my most recent phone replacement, I had always received the same exact, refurbished phone from google and the info on the replacements was always identical to the previous phones. For the life of me I can't remember re-logging into authenticator before with any of the previous phone replacements BUT the email tied to my phone/cell provider is the email I use for RS subscriptions/my primary acct.
---
Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.
---
I see your point, but what's the point of having an ordered quest list if someone has to Google which quests to do first?
---
Most scripts that use color detection take advantage of the many RL plugins that will mark certain aspects of the game with a color. Tile marking for pathing or character orientation, npc marking, inventory/bank markers for selecting items to bank/withdraw/drop, they significantly expand the possibilities of that specific type of script.
---
When you drop stuff in wildy it appears instantly and people can just grab it straight away :(
---
Yeah. What’s your point?
---
Isn't that bannable now
---
The chance for to get a back to back pet drop *for any two kills* is 1/9m. If you look at only those two kills then it doesn't matter when those two kills happen. It could be kc 1+2, or 10000+10001 so you are correct in that sense. It's when you consider *all* of the kc as a whole that things start to get more complicated. When you ask "what is the probability for a back to back drop to occur within 10001 attempts" you now have to consider when that back to back could have happened. That back to back could happen on kc {1,2} or {1254,1255} or whatever kc you want. It should make intuitive sense that the more you attempt something, the more likely that event will occur. Of course, this does not mean the pet drop rate ever changes. Any individual flip of a coin is 50/50 heads or tails but if you flip a coin 10 times you are damn near guaranteed to get at least 1 heads. Hope that makes sense.

I bet you're a spade pker trying to kill me twice! Jokes on you, I actually have no spades on me! I DIG WITH MY HANDS HAHAHA HAHA!
---
Because I put the ring of life on before the cape, and totally forgot that I had it on. XD
---
It does actually. Thanks.
---
Didn't this happen to one of the video makers? I feel like framed was doing something and dropped an item there and lost it, but can't recall exactly
---
Out of paper out of stock, theres friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
---
Call michael and stanley, jim dwight creed, call andy and kelly for your business paper needs.
---
iirc poison also "stuns" the core. This was a known mechanic back in RS2 where some players would bring rcbow and emerald e to stun the core. The blowpipe venom probably works in a similar fashion
---
Wow well TIL. People really turn RS into something it wasn’t suppose to be smfh
---
Also In socialscape, it’s pretty awesome
---
Getting laid is exp waste though.
---
Nah, metamorph option between the two forms.

As you said the list is Is not intended for UIM. You’d only have to google for those answers if you were playing on an UIM
---
not even low alchemy?

Darude - Sandstorm
---
What do you mean? I emptied my shield and noticed that there was no warning. I did have the intention to sell it so it's ok
---
You dropped the /s?
---
I get laid while Woodcutting. And I finish before my inventory fills up. 
---
Plus my main is level 143.
---
Guess who is in their 40's and still acts like a hormone driven adolescent?
---
Haha I feel that should be the Ironman t-shirt. Still, this is meant to be a suggestion for how the wiki can be improved, and I feel like augmenting the quest list and providing a quest list that keeps in mind the restrictions of Ironman is a definitive improvement.
---
A lot of that comment is misinformation, that's why it got downvoted.
---
Obviously the OnePlus 5 is better value for money, but to claim that it's an overall better phone is just ridiculous.
---
It really depends on who you ask. If you asked adwaam he’d probably say nothing because he can do inferno on mobile.
---
Agreed. That’s why I also point that the problems still exist for non-Ironmen.
---
Caveman dropped an elite clue there, IIRC.

My biggest thing about your comment is “do not release it yet” its far worse than the previous BH

In England a lot of people don't use a garage for cars, they're usually this small. most people use garages for storing things that just don't belong in a house, ie, bikes, air pressure machines, gardening tools etc. Basically garages in England are just sheds
---
Idk what guide you’re using but you prob need to move to the next safe spot during the phase. If you say what point in what rotation you’re having trouble I can give a more specific answer
---
A LOT of people have 60attack builds and most of them use claws
---
The altars were destroyed a long-ass time ago. Maybe the elves built their stuff around the death altar even after it was destroyed, meaning the fremennik wouldn't have had as much trouble reaching the death altar as players do.
---
For the cosmic altar, the moonclan have a connection to zanaris through the lunar/dramen staff, so it could have been possible for some fremenniks to get their hands on fairy magic to access zanaris and wreck the cosmic altar.

The intended series is to overcome an impossible obstacle no matter the cost. You could consider tick eating and manipulating npc aggression bug abuse as well which has been used since episode 1. Some bugs are just accepted and not changed as they have little implication or are so outrageous for a near nothing reward. Example: Who else wants to spend 5 hours soloing ven for a 1/2k chance at pet? Such a major exploit lol.

Y'all are uncultured swine

Because they aren't fun to do, just annoying. This bh rework is already really bad as is, and you likely have to do these in order to make even a decent amount. At this point an average pker will now lose money trying to pk, whereas before they could make a decent amount(before they did that dumb update making t10s tradable and crashing t1s).
---
Now it's even worse, but I suppose that's why it's beta. If those weapon upgrades passed, it'd be a lot better. The boxes were designed to have rare drops, but now it's just supplies. Really disappointed.
---
I don't really get the faces? Are they both the villager?
---
Like I kinda get it just based on the meme template, but idk...
---
And since I'm this far in... Don't you need to lure villagers away from Blackjacking?
---
Claws are more accurate, which is why people still use them all the time. And lately more people are using elder maul than AGS
---
GWD came out a few weeks after the august 07 backup that became osrs, which is why i was rolled in to the new game so quickly.
---
You have some amazing ideas, perhaps make a separate post if love to see some more love shown to pvp worlds. I miss pking on my main in bh but pvp worlds are where its at now days
---
This is what Pkers get after 4 years of constant lies
---
Absolutely horrendously appalling
---
You've basically changed some interfaces and called it an update
---
Honestly not surprised in the slightest
---
Claws are more accurate but anyone can shark, brew, karambwam is guaranteed to never get killed by it.
---
*looks over shoulder* ..... who me?
---
What if you do both though?
---
Edit: asking for a buddy
---
True I got a bit group of mates together to try the bh beta and it was a mess.. :/
---
I stand wid you, lvl 100 with no rune platebody, don’t hate on me :p
---
&gt;I dont think a bis Skilling option should be suddenly locked behind attack exp
---
Who are you to decide what gets locked behind what, you want to limit yourself=your problem.  
---
Why should I not get attack exp because minority people like you wants to keep their attack level low.....
---
Hmu fam I'll help ya out. IGN Fuglet
---
As mentioned shark brew Karam with pnecks. Also bringing a dinhs switch can help (I don't as I'm 60 atk). Bring a tankier switch like torag legs can help people not used to tanking.
---
It's pretty fast range xp, I went from 90-98 accidentally by mostly vorkath
---
With the [proposed addition of Daeyalt essence](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:OSRS_Reveals:_Morytania_Expansion) I don't think pure essence will be relevant for ironmen with the requirements to gather it. This would be 75 mining and completion of the new quest. It won't be better runecrafting xp per hour than crafting with essence bought or gathered through slayer, but should be better xp than straight up mining essence.
---
This just confirms that the op gets laid
---
The drawback is lack of nostalgia bro. Buy stuff without coins in your inventory? No thanks. If you dont check your inventory before you set out on an adventure, or go to buy certain things, that's on you.
---
Nice meme thou
---
Flash?
---
They’re the most popular smart phone for a reason lol. But yeah there is definitely good competition
---
Did you switch over from the youtube app? It does this to me when I switch over from youtube.

Good luck on completing those sets.

Agreed, I’ve always been on iPhone but in the recent year started watching more phone reviews and looking at other options. And on current trend, if I’m not impressed by the iPhone 12 I’ll be looking at the next Pixel, One Plus or Galaxy as my next upgrade.
---
Bailed because of the massive debt perhaps? That's my guess.
---
Abyssal Whip at level 70 is going to be your bread and butter for quite a long time. If you’re not hurting for cash, the abyssal dagger is a great option specifically for strength training

Contact like the quest and pick up cuz they dont

My chair fucking stinks!!

Pour 2 years of your life into this game and you’ll probably be there 🤙

Dude I’m up here in NYC and they are everywhere. I once said woke up in the middle of the night to seeing one on my pillow less than 3 inches away. It was a fully grown one.
---
But they took my money... Lets wait 5 days to see, if they will return them. Becuz I didn't recive anything.
---
Get your butt to zanaris boi
---
not gonna lie this is impressive as hell
---
You can’t ‘contact a quest’ though
---
nobody is going to play suboptimally when you can make money more consistently playing normally, unless of course there is a HUGE incentive.
---
I got two scythes, one need a charge

Na just opening and closing it a lot while at work. Usually its white haha

Lmao what a nerd. Trash talk is what makes the pvp community fun and exciting. We’re all old enough to take a simple joke.

3) Join the cc "420 Lounge" bet u can make friends and get some help
---
I see no reason to add this mechanic to barbarian fishing. No-one wants those inedible fish. I think the same holds true for normal river fly fishing. Once you unlock lobsters, no-one will fish trout for food. So those pure xp methods should be exempt from this scaling in my opinion.
---
Otherwise you're right. It would ruin the training meta.

RIP ribcage

I use xubuntu 18.04 with the default jre and I have no problems running the runelite.jar. My middle mouse button also works to turn the camera.

Try looking for new drivers for your mouse. Are you using non-free drivers? Sometimes there can be performance differences.
---
Ya right, like you have any friends

you can also go to the chest and click all your pots to destroy them, then type 4 in the search to get all the pots.

Runescape is a Java game.

Ooooh okay. I figured we had some diablo nephalem stuff going on to explain why us at lvl 60 can pop off lvl 400 godly archmages for ma2 and stuff haha.

I'm a noob at wilderness, but I just go with my three best items, pray pots and strength pots. Have a trigger finger on either switch worlds or tele. Most of the time I get out of there with a couple mil if I'm lucky.

Runescape got me laid. I was talking to a girl on PoF and said "I am so committal, that I got 99 mining before it was easy." She responded with "no fuckin way, prove it". We met up for drinks that night, I signed into rsmobile to show her, and realized that my stats were all level 1 because I had played that character on what became rs3.
---
We went back to my place, I showed her the RS3 version and then she showed me her 99s character. I got laid, it was awful, we never spoke again.
---
I honestly think all weapons armor and tools should degrade and need either repairing or relaxing.
---
lol as much as I'm NOT a pvp-er, as much as I always die in the wildy, as much as going there is a fearful trip for which I have to work up courage for an hour, as much as I don't want to have to go there ever again, the game *needs* the wildy and would be boring without the huge pvp zone. I don't always vote. I usually obstain from pure pvp polls. But I usually vote in favor of more wildy content. We have to support the Zammy demesne that is the hunting ground of assholes lest the strength of the lands of Saradomin atrophy.
---
A lot of tasks its kinda useless for but for people that don't study the wiki it would be convenient to stumble upon alternative monsters such as mourners for elves, etc.
---
Man, I miss this version of Rs2 :( ...

[**Or do both at the same time**](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bndshv/project_agility_in_game_and_sorta_in_real_life/).

Wish that applies to my RS3 account where I put 14000 hours between 2006-2014.

I used to be 28/36 but as i got older my love of food has made me a 34 waist :(

Oh, you mean like "The The"? Just kidding ;) I think you're right.

Flash has nothing to do with Java, only thing they have in common is they can both be embedded in web pages.

Gonna need you to do your own research about it. He had a twitter thread talking about it.

With Vanilla Client you can make it to almost just the alch button which is what I'm asking

it's java

Someone mind giving some context, lol
---
For real
---
Yeah thats a good solution too but I personally dont like degrading armour/weapons. Id prefer straight up losing them when I mess up myself instead of having them disappear when using them.
---
I've never PvM'd. Always a pker, this update is shite.

I was getting 35 kills per trip at 90 stats and my friend told me that I wasn't doing good

Nah bro you just suck too much, have you tried sucking less?
---
Jamflex please let us dig with our hands with Wildy Elite
---
This is never a good look, man.
---
I'm not talking about efficiency, it's not like I'm tick manipulating every moment I'm playing, I'm just getting things done. I think everyone should play with the mentality of getting further in the game each time they log in. Time is our biggest limitor here. You cam spend your time making a story to tell or you can stare at yourself bankstanding and pay with both time and money to do so. Like you said, that's fun for some people, but I personally find fun from accomplishing things.
---
you cant thats the problem LUL

Idk how Bono can do so many amazing things, and still be just a huge piece of shit. 😂

It’s a Java based game, not flash. Also, I’m NoT a VirGiN!

Tureal streaking with konar is about 2x as fast

I'm looking for an OSRS song. It's been mentioned on this sub before as being really out of place in the game. IIRC, it sounds like it has an electric guitar in it or something.

Anyone have any ideas?

Weird flex, but okay...

Its the same thing lol

Just sometimes you get interupted mid task

I went from like 30-99 agility using runelite the whole time.. never had an issue.

I've noticed that too. This was my 2nd attempt to bring attention to this here. This subreddit hasn't changed its rules about submissions either.
---
Someone's mad

Wait what how did you get 99 Slayer without getting well above 75 Defence :-o and your Ranged level is 1 so you didn't cannon either!
---
Really curious.

Look it up. The Apple iphone is the most popular smart phone. At least in the United States. Idk about China or the UK etc

Yeah that's Java

Are you from Casual BA or BA Services?

Well I'm not sure what else it could have been,  it's the only thing I've done on the account for weeks

I'm so confuses

Oh shit watch out for the Fragment of Seren
---
Yup, I was wrong

I would fuck you in the wilderness for your shovel ... and I’m not talking about osrs 😏

What is this chart even supposed to mean? 
---
Java is a derivitive of web browsers?
---
You are right.
---
LMS would be sick if they introduced a elo based rating system, like in other competitive video games. 
---
So that the best on the ladder would actually be the best players at the minigame. (And they could just host a pvp tourny for those for their esports)
---
A comment in that thread saying that guys set alarms for every 20 minutes while sleeping so they can reset NMZ. Do people actually do that??? thats absolutely bonkers
---
Huh, yeah not sure why I thought that.
---
doubt
---
That sounds like Jagex, yes.
---
Tele Group Ice Plateau was frequently used back in the day as a Lure of sorts, to send people high aching to level 53 Wildy.  People used to cast it at GE, as it has always been a prime spot for bankstanding.
---
Thank you sir
---
true, gotta pay for those hookers huh
---
It was a joke y’all chill lol it’s not that deep
---
I didn’t even think to put that in the post. The goal of this account is solely to do the quests. I even chose ultimate Ironman, so as to have the restriction of doing it in one life. Thanks for pointing that out.

go to my home country and see how many people think dating a 16 year old with fully developed breasts, almost fully grown in height, and mentally almost identical to an 18 year old at the age of 21 is wrong. i fucking hate Americans and their warped view of sexuality.

The last part is what half makes me think he faked it for some e-peen, but on the other hand why would anyone ever want to be known for that "shit" lol
---
But the fact remains that this guy's reaction to seeing him was to post it online. Hes instantly recognizable. Some people will do anything for a little fame
---
Its all off of a screenshot of him saying he did it in a cc
---
If you're not needing the defence, I.E. safespotting then an MSB(i) is usually better DPS, especially factoring in that it has a Spec

You can’t make a claim like that without evidence what the fuck is wrong with you

He could be disabled, spoiled by parents,or even the result of some legal action leaving him supported for the rest of his life.

Why is sex lauded as the most important thing. Its honestly pretty overrated. Its like 10 seconds of dopamine.
---
Whereas osrs lasts as long as jagex doesnt fuck it up
---
Thought this was r/neopets for a minute
---
Jagex is too lazy for that
---
Ik people used to do it when you could have 6 hour nmz going, and some people will do it for herb runs(every hour and half), but I really doubt anyone can physically wake up every 20 mins.

 At some point your body says fk that noise and just stays asleep.

I feel like BIS being in wildy is actually a good thing if you cant pock it down and get a clan to camp it but there would be no way to enforce that

That's an update I'd vote for!

loot from botting* lol
---
Why tho? They give almost the same XP; but aren't orbs a little more useful for extra crafting XP and alching for GP? Or is powering orbs simply a waste of time?
---
Genuine question, I'm a noob.
---
So make the mailbox low level like say lvl 4.
---
Unlucky but nice
---
as if Jagex referrs to your accounts as main, pures &amp; ironmen lmfao
---
If you're gonna do it for fun and don't care about magic xp you can just splash with melee is what I'm trying to say

Some people dont rendi but still browse reddit. I'm just trying to help, I'm not sure why you're so hostile.
---
Hey, I'm currently in "team paradox" which is a 115 cb pvm clan. We primarily focus on Raids 1/2 &amp; GWD but occasionally hold PVM events for other group bosses and such. We do teach Raids 1/2 so if that's something you need, then you should definitely look into joining the clan! Basic reqs can be found on our discord server; which you can easily gain access to. Just hop in the clan chat 'Team Paradox' in game if you're interested :)
---
Crazy easy. Zulrah has rotations, different colors, different attacks you need to pray against, there's gear switches. Vork with a crossbow is just "stand in one place and attack. Every 12 attacks, walk 5 tiles back and forth." Pretty much
---
I feel like if they made it shared then it would just lead to people leaching off of their main/alt for free slayer exp.
---
Its just a bit strange imo since there are already PvM achievements in the regular diary.
---
No he’s afoot of the game.
---
But that's not what anybody is talking about

I support allowing players to build a shrine to their waifu

I have ferocious gloves but no barrows gloves. Are blessed d'hide bracers acceptable or am I trash who should die alone in noobtown?

working on base 80 stats. 8 done so far, after that more diary completion
---
This is awesome I'd love to build a nieve shrine in my poh.
---
Per skill? Or overall xp
---
Never before have I been so offended by something that is 100% true.
---
I see all streamers and youtubers using runelite?
---
I've never done raids before but I've definitely wanted to learn! Was told by a friend he'd help me learn once I got 115 combat...idk why does cb level affect raids? But by the time I did he kinda stopped playing for the most part

What do you do for work lol

As it should be

No you weren’t lol.

You got phished. Be thankful it wasn’t for more.

Fucking CHAD
---
Best of luck my dude
---
Runelite isn’t the problem. The problem is you won’t be getting an email from them saying your account is locked. They aren’t affiliated with rs. They have no clue what your account status is. You got phished by a fake email and you’re pointing blame elsewhere than yourself.
---
Have they said what the rate for the robes yet?
---
It wasnt actually runelite dummy
---
God you're a smoothbrain
---
Berserker necklace + fun weapon + black d'hide shield is -71 crush attack bonus. You need attack bonus of -64 or lower to always hit 0's

Different people have different sex drives homie. And most other people last a lot longer than 10 seconds.

First of all, it's an ancient JAVA game, fucker.

@divineinsanityreveng 13% of players that voted no the last poll voted strictly because they "don't like PvP". And when you need 75% for polls to pass, do you see why theres a huge issue here? And in reality, theres prob a lot more than just 13% voting no just because they dislike PvP and wish for it to die. Also, I didn't say "all" pvmers vote no, that's obviously not true. But enough of them vote no out of spite to keep the smaller PvP community from growing.

1. Activate Arceeus spellbook
---
2. Kill Imps around GE until one drops an Ensouled head
---
3. Reanimate the Ensouled head on the spot
---
4. Use mage cape to switch back to Standard spellbook
---
5. Splash

There is an extension for reddit where you can "tag" users. Its essentially a flair I gave you on my end that I will see whenever I see your username.
---
So, you are tagged as "likes to fuck 15 year olds."
---
I wish barrows worked more like this.  Instead of having a small decay cost, I'd rather it be double or triple the repair but only degrade on death.  Something like, "as you fall to the ground defeated, you feel you armor shatter from your opponents last blow."  Degradable armor just feels meh considering they aren't useful for very long unless you are an ironman and that the game is more dictated by offensive capability.  Degradable weapons much more fit the game, especially since it usually affects top tier items
---
less people that cut the trees the less chance if despawns so its more afk overall and when someone attacks you its a nice break. doesnt matter if u bank or drop logs
---
Seriously impressive dedication.. currently dying on the 77 rc grind, congrats dude

WGS &gt; Monkey Madness II
---
Only Dragon Slayer II really held up the old standards.
---
Couple figures, pkers call and collect
---
We pk a spade, then we on to the next
---
Unnecessary and redundant when there's discord to serve that function.
---
Not here to prove anything to my fellow clickers bruhsimeelious
---
LOL YEAH GUYS I DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY EITHER LOLOL
---
Wait. Why splash if 99 already?
---
Reddit loves relentlessly making fun of the HLC. What oslo did is repugnant and fucking dumb, but its been like 6 months, get over it.
---
Last time they did that, it was called a Minigame. Heck even Slayer would be called a minigame.
---
I literally blamed no one I specified I'm venting, and I was told runlite is very secure. I've been playing for 3 months now so I can't say im an old player, the community has always been friendly but thanks for letting me know there's people like you as well !
---
Alright it could be way better now that i think of it
---
To be honest I dont care either way. They are fine how they are, and they will be fine if changed. IMO not worth spending too much dev time on this.
---
When people say they hate Rs3, honestly, I think they mean they hate EoC. Some people hated summoning and probably even more hated dungeoneering, but tons of those people would probably still be playing Rs3 if EoC wasn't a thing.
---
And what's the alternative to power creep? We're playing efficiency scape now, so unless something is the new meta, it's dead content within 2 weeks. In order to keep the playerbase interested, there needs to be some sort of creep.
---
Their old muting system was insane. I have mutes on my oldest account for saying "Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii" lol.
---
5 to 10 levels in a couple hours? Am I training agility wrong?
---
Well now they know you’re a pmod 🤪🤪🤪
---
Theyve twice said it will be out the week before halloween. Shooting for october 25th
---
i like these ideas, theyre pretty well thought out but i have to agree with others and say buyable pets aren't  really a popular idea :)
---
Perhaps...
---
I like them, always thought the old models looked bad
---
And if you aren’t on a med level it’s just shitty.
---
The PC I originally played runescape on didnt even sell for $10 at the garage sale I had 5 years ago.
---
How long will the worlds be down for?
---
Spiteful jealousy.
---
Unless you’re at the dark altar you can reanimate anywhere...... that you received an ensouled head from a monster you killed. You can’t just summon a dragon at the GE.
---
Not really. If they vote no to the quest they're also voting no to the rewards which is the whole reason people even do quests to begin with. 
---
There is no "need" for PvMers or skillers to enter the wilderness. They go in themselves knowing perfectly well that they can be attacked and lose their items on death. The fact that the polling system is being weaponised by people that aren't willing to learn to play the game as intended is more than a good enough reason to either suppress votes or lower the pass threshold.
---
Slayers xp rates have increased significantly since osrs release, mainly the introduction of smoke devils and catacombs
---
Spitealousy.

---
Tbh i dont think osrs will ever die. Before osrs was released I still played rs3, I just didnt do combat anymore. When osrs came out I switched and I really like the direction the game is going in.
---
Update! I'm cleaned lmao
---
they need to make these bigger and allow to put them in chapel
---
Sit on my dds.
---
it could be atomatic and would need very little code change
---
No skull, killing a dude doing slayer ... shows no proof of harassing. Why are you trying to farm karma with lies?
---
The new icons look a lot better, but it's really not a huge deal.
---
Blowpipe is faster but cbow is more cost efficient. If you're gunna use cbow bring ruby bolts for the first half of the kill though, they have a ton of HP.
---
You, apparently
---
Nightmare Zone is what I’ve been doing through midterms.  Use Runelite, make it notify you when prayer drops below 20 and minimize it.
---
Tried slayer tasks like hellhounds in Kourend but it’s not really AFK. NMZ is the least distracting skilling method, you only need a click every 3 minutes or so and get amazing EXP rates. I’ve heard Redwood trees are nice and AFK too for woodcutting but haven’t tried it myself
---
I love these suggestions on this sub-reddit, keep them coming.
---
Nice jad pet
---
Yeah, it had higher rates and they were nerfed.  Currently the fastest method is mind tiaras until lavas and lavas to 99, all of which existed in 2007
---
le downboat armie is here! you're not wrong
---
Bet there will be so many pkers camping it as soon as bh world returns
---
RS3 mining with grace of the elves.
---
ud prob get 96-99 str faster than he did 98-99 range tho
---
Slater is a legend
---
He attacked me and a few other people for a good 10 minutes doing air orbs. That's why I killed him without getting a skull, I just went and grabbed my own gear and walked back. I think we can all agree that most people doing wilderness slayer don't normally skull with 10m risk.
---
No pets for buyables.
---
Menu swaps are qol. Why should I have to do 30k dead clicks that do nothing for my character minus physically wearing down my wrist?
---
And if you dont have elite diary completed?
---
Aww man 2 jars... Sorry to see that
---
Support
---
Not worth trying. Stake within your level
---
What were those 3 last items in the invy if you dont mind me asking? Were you **COMPLETELY** out of brews? :o
---
I upvoted you but I didn't like doing it
---
I think if you start the quest at all it unlocks dragon tasks
---
I did air battlestaff from 94-99 and made 11m.
---
That would be smart. I'll make sure i scout it before i go marching in with my bank on me.
---
How? Thanks for sharing btw
---
Dragon boots are so iconic it would make me sad if they changed them
---
Then work towards it it's one of the more important diaries alongside western hard for elite void.
---
He was killing the black demons with proselyte on and slayer helmet to just use protection prayers, which is why the only things he brought with him was prayer and combat potions. Black demons drop rune chains semi frequently, and for some reason was trying to attack everyone his combat level that walked by him to charge air orbs.
---
I’d do leagues even without a reward period tbh. A cosmetic that I can use or sell (probably for a decent chunk) is just a bonus. I do agree that there should be SOME untradable rewards that show “yeah I actually did it, not bought it”
---
Pretty sure they do not drop from slayer anymore.
---
Assuming coin pouches from all different NPC's?
---
&gt;Maybe because they vote this way because pvp right not is not balanced at all and they want Jagex to fix these core issues before adding more content that would make it worse? The players who benefit from pvp the most never see it to be an issue.
---
Lmao this is an incredibly poor argument. No, they don’t care about PvP. They hate it. I just told you the reason why.
---
You would have skull.
---
Kind of depends on your levels.
---
OP’s just really flexing his impossible to achieve RC lvl.
---
Sounds kinda pointless
---
2015? When everyone was defending subscribing to OSBuddy Pro?
---
Ah ok I gotcha.  Yeah that’s totally fair dude, don’t get me wrong, just for me I don’t bother alching basically anything that isn’t tune drops, and it just so happens that many head dropping monsters drop little of any rune stuff.  So I prefer to do the heads on task, and the small amount of drops get alched once the task is over and I switch books back.  We’re doing the same thing but backwards lol
---
When you wake up in the morning and it's Steve!
---
Invest some now while it can’t sell
---
Invest rest when 318 returns and pkers offload emblems they pked in bulk. 
---
?????
---
Profit
---
Ugh
---
Devalues my 2D-only UIM.
---
How is that possible?
---
How do you decide if a boss is similar in difficulty when difficulty is subjective?
---
Also a total requirement seems more appropriate. Skilling content locked behind a requirement usually serves as a reason to go out of your way to train that skill so restricting voting to a specific skill also makes no sense.
---
Just leave the offer in, same same
---
Not if he attacked me first.
---
Big no-no.
---
they were removed but then jmods tweeted that they added them back, i know that they exist as a drop but i swear their drop rate is way rarer than its supposed to be
---
All good homie
---
Prayer potions with chemisty is 5.36 gp/xp
---
1 dose Stams are 10 gp/xp and a fraction of the xp/hr
---
Don't do 1 dose stams unless you're an ironman who wants 5% more stamina's.
---
How to instances work? Is there a maximum number of instances that can be run?
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. Java isn't even close to being terrible. That's an ignorant person's opinion.
---
Fair enough. If you had fun that’s all that matters in the end. Osrs is still an game after all! Just don’t let this translate into real life gambling/gold buying and you’re okay in my eyes
---
Why not Fighter Torso? 
---
Also Rune Boots. And work towards RFD for Barrows Gloves.
---
Why does there have to be rewards for it to be fun? I swear this community has a one track mind sometimes.
---
I am looking forward to leagues because it's going to bring that same new fresh economy feel that I got from dmm. There's a sense of wonder and excitement and a place to be the first one to understand a niche in the market that is untapped.
---
Everything in osrs has been discovered. Every autistic restricted play style you can think of has been done. There's no room for theory crafting, or learning which was the aspect that made RuneScape fun to as a kid. We literally know every aspect of the game, so when something like this comes around it's like a test of your in game knowledge, and a mystery all in one.
---
Like if you have 15+ years experience of this game and know it literally inside in out something like this is a enviorment where you can thrive in. The experience itself is the reward, I don't get why you guys need a fucking item at the end to be able to enjoy the game.
---
People can play with their alt/alts while playing on their main and trade the tradeable to their main (this is not posible for ironman though, sad). People can also do it to sell the rewards for big cash. 
---
What I find interesting is that the rewards from previous leagues can be bought with points from later leagues. So for example I can buy the rewards from the first league (twisted league) with points I earned from the second league. It would be kinda cool if they were limited. I would definitely stop progress on my main to get limited time rewards.
---
Yeah, sounds like it lol
---
I do like when I find out an almost useless item technically profits when alched, like a steel battleaxe.
---
They should be dropping again. Jagex stated in the latest news post that they had temporarily re-enabled them while the beta is still going.
---
In varrock I milly rock
---
because chompy kills are tedious with the frogs and the swamps and all that
---
I guess I just assumed that ft was worse than torags top. I’m basically grinding combat to high lvl with slayer before I do anything like quests or skulking anything else .
---
Why do you gotta expose me like that...
---
tron with demons
---
The mith scim/rune scim always got me
---
I don't think the defense bonus is as good as strength bonus for low level slayer; plus cheaper and no repair costs.
---
Good job fam.
---
Yes. This was part of a news segment iirc
---
Definitely not ruling it out that’s for sure
---
I would advice against telling Reddit your plans they're going to tell you to only play the max efficiency way. I can tell you already you're hitting so many red flags that's going to trigger them.
---
5 attempts?! Great talent
---
Same here, I love the new look and most of the icons are more readable at a glance for new players.
---
top account much better, you’re right
---
Is Abyss for Nature runes actually faster than Fairy Ring to Karamja?
---
Haha you’re probably right .
---
I fell for the scam with mint cakes when they had an overly inflated price lol.
---
I like it. I support.
---
How do you mean the "wrong way" exactly?
---
You quit in 08 because of better graphics? Okay buddy.
---
I wouldn't risk it on something as easy as con. Once you get to dungeon doors its very easy and requires almost zero mouse movement.
---
it's such a non-problem, it's not even worth dev time
---
As someone that just finished the Stronghold of Security, heh.
---
Seriously, I’m totally in favor of altering things to be more in line with the 07 aesthetic and to match each other
---
Read my other comments. I’m tired of explaining it. Old code + spaghetti = bad
---
Ah yes, Stam'pot bridge
---
I’ve splashed on imps for hours in numerous locations. I think they only tele at low hp when trying to escape.
---
My account got banned for botting, have never botted in my life but i would often afk skills such as splashing. my stats were reasonably good and i had a 99 and it seems ridiculous that i got banned. I have appealed the ban but is there anything else i can do?
---
It will be an improvement. The DPS is the same  on crush as a whip, which will be better than the dagger.
---
Can't he just run back and get his shit back because you're an iron though?
---
I suppose making him lose his ring and possibly mask imbue has to count for something though.
---
Current rank 5 looks like this, do you?
---

---
Make sure you have 70 runecrafting for your 50k xp lamp
---
On uim? Marry me
---
Fool me once shame on you
---
Oracle gave me cancer though
---
if only i had such nice friends
---
I think it’s great, but it doesn’t matter. The 79 players who hate everything that changes, at all, overrule us every time.
---
How are you now I’m going through the same
---
"Better". Liking or disliking different variations of Runescape's graphics is pretty subjective. I much prefer what we have over the HD version that was introduced before.
---
but that's not a reason to give bot abusers even more resources?
---
I know RWTing is against the rules, but is trading in-game currencies also illegal in some countries?
---
Yes if its a not prev item
---
aka dboots stay the same, bandos boots stay the same, but fremmy boots, angler boots, etc all get swapped for new model because theyre new items anyway.
---
500 hours in a 4 year program? Damn dude, that's like 12 work weeks worth of commitment in a four year period lmfao
---
I'm going to do the fight caves while getting head on pornhub
---
No i love my ugly fat d boots
---
Sorry for asking but what is that used for anyways?
---
the HLC are easy targets though
---
4 berserker rings before this
---
I take it you found this on the FB group? Love seeing my creations shared 🥰
---
new ones look better but damn i'll miss the dragon bongos
---
thanks for the new lure method
---
Winter 2017
---
Iirc someone asked a mod on twitter or something and they said it doesn’t technically violate the rules to build something physical to autoclick but their bot detection will probably pick it up anyways.
---
please bless me with your luck
---
only like 5k kc no pet here
---
well idk the prices right now but back when i was on the herblore grind around a month ago i was actually profiting with doing normal 4 dose stamina pots, i think i just so happen to do it at the right time and buy and sell at the right price, so that's where i came from, but yeah i know prayer pots is a stable way to train without losing too much.
---
This comment is wrong you need to step on the right tile to off tick mage range stack. And theres 3 different tiles to use depending if its mage/rsnge, bat/mage/range or blob/mage/range stack
---
well thats to mutch leaked infortmation gl with that acc sit pls
---
thats gotta be it cuz i dont remember doing that, thought i remembered reading that i just needed to finish the quest. thanks
---
Just avoid confrontation at all cost. If someone does choose to fight you go all in don't run. Focus more on trying to out last them. Leave auto retaliate on and focus on prayer switches and eating. Slowly work in attacking then back after eating. Then slowly work in switching from melee to range when he switched his gear and prayer flicks. If you can deal damage to them they'll have to eat and do less damage to you. 
---
If you can make it to the top 3 you get points if I remember correctly. I don't think there is a good method besides waiting until it's late at night when mostly only bots play
---
Tbh I'd rather have cosmetics than nothing and this is the only thing people might vote in
---
How are they scumbags for participating in content they enjoy.
---
So, I can spend at least a few hours making my place presentable, manscaping, and probably a date or two, for 2 minutes of sex which will be great (for me at least), or I can spend all that time enjoying myself playing OSRS, and not have to pay for drinks. 
---
Also that's not even factoring in that she would probably want to sleep here. That's an entire night and morning of wasted xp. I could probably get an entire RC level in that time.
---
What skill is in that 50-60 lvl range? If it's combat, you could kill chaos druids or safespot blue dragons. 
---
Training cooking/fletching/runecrafting is profitable from any level as well
---
is there footage of this ordeal because wtf imagine shitting yourself over pixels in a kids medieval gardening simulator
---
it massively hurt rs3 when they started changing iconic game items and this could be equally as hurtful
---
Haha not me this was in r/all 
---
I spend time watching others get laid instead
---
Lmao
---
fuuuck bruh
---
Yeah no prob. It’s in the room past the rune and addy dragons. It’s like a “strange machine” or some shit like that
---
To "splash" is to fail to do damage with a spell. Some people will purposefully get REALLY low magic accuracy so that they constantly splash, and autocast a cheap spell on something weak.
---
You get some magic xp for splashing and because you're in combat (so you don't autolog as fast) and neither of you really do damage, it's VERY afk mage xp.
---
Toxic Blowpipe. It's extremely useful in many, many scenarios. But it also can be relatively expensive to use. 160gp a shot in scales or something like that.
---
What’s the point of changing them. Fine as they are
---
Just make a toggle-able runelite feature and everyone is happy
---
I don't PvP either, and I'm not interested in it because I'm pretty bad at it and a sore loser, but I don't like the idea of PvP stuff not getting polled if it still affects me, for instance when I would engage in wildy activities. I don't want PKers to have an easier time killing me when I do black chins or venenatis, so it's only natural I would vote against PvP weapons is it not?
---
Unfortunately it has been posted every few months since mobile launched.
---
I am upset you would slander gentle mod Ash like this.
---
This thread needs more attention just for this comment.
---
No, you can cure plant on lunar spellbook though
---
yeah, i just find it interesting that people think broad bolts are sometimes better dps. Usually the comparisons use broad bolts since they're so cheap
---
our player is a psychopath who manipulates, steals, lies, kills, and will sit for days on end chopping down a tree for fun
---
Toxic blowpipe is probably the best ranged weapon in the game and "only" costs about 4m, but the ammo is expensive. It's probably your next major upgrade for a ranged weapon.
---
Its fat, it will spread the pressure evenly all over his body and probably even on the floor.
---
Is there any precautions I should know about when it comes using Runelite? As far as I can tell it’s safe to use but maybe there’s something I’m not thinking about that I need to watch out for?
---
I haven't changed my password in atleast 12 years and I use the same one everywhere pretty much.. never been hacked.
---
whts the point of splashing if youre already 99 magic tho?
---
morbidly interested, can you link me?
---
I like it
---
&gt; I was also afk barbarian fishing and would switch clients to drop fish
---
but why switch clients just to drop fish? this is odd as hell.
---
Well a lot of us quit because of EOC. Partly because we didn't recognise anything in our banks, amongst the more obvious reasons.
---
I’ve been thinking about getting all the achievements done. I had quest cape. Just been afk fishing forever. Got 96 yesterday
---
Pair of hockey globes
---
Great to hear :D
---
every day is Archie's birthday, you silly goose
---
Maybe I worded it weird, I had 2 RuneLite apps open and would stop agility on the one to drop fish on the other.
---
Change all except d boots
---
assuming the pker is in a group they could probably cash it in right away
---
I mean I didn’t quit for only that reason but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t change the overall vibe of the game for me.
---
Also, Steven 5D0C is black.
---
Lucky bastard.
---
Told yall it's been like that since release lol
---
Do not change the D boots!!
---
Just got this done today too, childhood goals achieved. Nice job!
---
I think he was advocating for DPS with the cbow and frugality with the broads.
---
This is shit advice. You would only need to change your password if you use the same one on a website that was compromised. You should have different passwords for everything.
---
This is the osrs I wanted
---
