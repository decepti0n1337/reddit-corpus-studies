I just want to mention a few things here. First you need to be aware of the dangers. Always. I lost my hcim skiller doing medium clue as i forgot you can spawn a wizard which pretty much oneshot me. Second being, its possible to safespot some monsters and cannon stall hit them then recoil. So some items or quests are achievable. You can also drop trick air talismans. Others can be obtained through implings or random events. Good luck. Btw castle wars minigame teleport then run to catherby. Beware of bears and bats.

That's such a stupid argument to make. Yes of course Jagex is a business. Of course their goal is to make money. Of course they released Old School to make money. Still, people forget that there are actual people working on it. Assuming they completely agree with the decisions Jagex made is just as Braindead.
---
I don't know why you are even talking about loyalty, what does that have to do with anything? I plainly said that it's okay to criticize Jagex when they deserve it, and it's okay to completely disagree with them.
---
Saying that they are the "worst company ever" is just stupid bullshit. There are far far worse game companies out there, who don't go through half the effort Jagex does to communicate. 
---
Anyway half the time the community is talking out of their ass when it comes to things like anti bot and anti macro tools. Way oversimplifying things and acting like its just an easy task to make a perfect anti bot system. 
---
Of course it's bullshit to lose major progress like some have claimed. It's perfectly okay to be unhappy with Jagex, you don't need to blindly agree with everything and I never implied that anyway. 
---
I'm just fucking sick of seeing the same complaints and same memes over and over. Directly attacking mods whom are just communicating the decisions of the company is pointless. Things could be so, so, so much worse. Calling them the worst company ever is absolutely ridiculous and uncalled for. Voice your opinions when necessary, don't just start shitting out memes anytime you are unhappy
---
Lol love this. Wish most players acted this way instead of saying ‚Äú**** off loser‚Äù or **** like that. Great satire :P
---
But does this actually increase gp/hr over losing a inventory slot?

The rules prevented anyone from under 13 from having an account. This is because data protection laws at the time seemed to prevent internet companies from collecting data (even trivial data like the time you logged in) from users under the age of 13. If you could get Jagex to verify with you parents, you could play, but I'm not sure if they ever responded to letters from parents. 
---
Now a days, the laws have changed to become more clear, and companies have adjusted the red tape. You can make an account and play RuneScape if you're under 13 today, but the in game chat will be disabled, as well as a few other changes.

Capitalism was much more regulated from the 40s -&gt; 80s than it is today. After the great depression there were heaps of regulations put in place to stop that shit ever happening again, then Reagan came along.

He sold 2.8b in that period. It also only dropped 100 points from his sale times. It was already on a downswing of 100 points before he even sold his share during that period. Even looking at the comparative back in June amazon dropped just as many points without him selling any shares. Market volatility is a thing, and if he started dumping all his shares of course it would cause a crash in his overall value. Saying "if he started selling his shares to get some cash" is a really aggressive statement sounding like he's never sold shares. That's not even the case at all. Over 10 years ago he was selling off shares yearly at values more than everyone on this sub will never see. He's selling shares off and he will continue to sell 1B of shares a year to fund his space business.

 Amazon reported an earning of $5.6 billion in 2017 in America. Amazon did pay close to 1 billion in income tax in 2017. $211 million to individual states in America and 724 million to other countries not America. They paid absolutely nothing in federal taxes.
---
Furthermore, Amazon got a $137 million tax refund. Meaning they paid about 74 million dollars in taxes to America in 2017. Meaning they paid about 800 million total. On 5.6 billion. 
---
What is great is how they got all those federal deductions. 220 million in research, development, the stuff you would expect. $917 million in tax-deductible executive pay. Keep in mind that tax breaks only apply to the stock options of executives in a company that have a salary of 1 million or more. Meaning they get paid to make rich people richer. They also got another $789 million from Trump's tax cuts to top off the shit cake.  
---

I also have absolutely no interest in anything Jeff Bezos has to say. The guy is a complete tool bag, which is the exact reason he's so rich. Nobody gets to become a billionaire without being a sociopath and an asshole. He doesn't give a fuck about you, so you really shouldn't care about him. Just look at the way he treats his employees. Amazon made 10 billion in profit last year and didn't pay a single penny in taxes. Again, he doesn't give a fuck about you. You are the ignorant one.

Second the herb/birdhouse runs. Do quests that give farming xp to get to mid 30s, then farm ranarrs. Unlock fossil island and do birdhouse runs. Depending how often you can login during a day (also easy on mobile), you can easily get 400k+ a day from that combo.

If you want to use that backwards logic, almost nothing in an MMO would be an achievement because RNG plays a huge factor in so many things.

It takes the average person 5000 kills to get the pet, therefore it is an achievement. Just because a few people got stupidly lucky doesn't discount it as an achievement symbol.

WRONG
---
PvP is net LOSS. Every time you make an untradeable a gp sink you make PvP even more of a net loss. Not to mention your recent gmaul update which currently is about a 500k net loss per loss of gmaul (250k before bh removal). For example if two guys with AGS + gmaul setup double death to veng, they both lose 500k from the gmaul, probably around 100k+ from firecape/torso and other untradeables + whatever supplies they used during the fight, and failed to loot after the fight AND if they both had a tent whip they both lose a whip - overall about a 3m+ loss each.
---
Depending on the build and what untradeables you risk, and who you manage to kill for what they risk - you need about 2-5 kills to break even from 1 death, and thus you need a 3+ k/d to profit pking. That is why you aren't getting new pkers to the scene. The best a 1 k/d player can do is never risk untradeables and only ever risk 30k so their loss isn't so bad. Which then brings on the cycle of nobody making any money because the loots are less money than the supply cost, god forbid a good player ever die and lose 10 kills worth of profit.

So the guy basically gave up doing Ultimate ironman stuff and decided to permanently camp at pest control
---
kinda funny, but I respect it
---
Also, Jagex would never threaten a lawsuit over RWT.
---
How much were u risking when u took this screen cap?
---
So abusing boss and minigame mechanics to use them as something you set your account not to use is smart,huh?
---
I want to see UIM play the game as they set themselves to,not use handicapped version of bank
---
Some people forget that they're wearing an amulet. Also, get metal boots for members or fighter boots from security stronghold for ftp
---
This gave me horrible horrible flashbacks :(
---
LOL jagex made oxygen sinks into a real thing

Feel forced "you're forced to do a lot of content" it's part of unlocking stuff.

And no ones forcing anyone to train there it gives a alternate form of training you can make up your mind.
---
Castle wars is fun but it's a xp or cash waste.
---
I mean it's only natural progression right
---
I found your issue I think! 
---
Swap out super extended anti fire for super anti fire. 
---
For whatever reason, super extended anti fire only blocks partial fire damage on Vortkarth, where super anti fire blocks all damage. 
---
Also, are you praying range or mage? Vorkarth attacks more frequently with range, and also, you‚Äôre mage defense is higher with elite void. So you should be range praying, using a dragonfire ward or anti dragon shield. If using a blowpipe, you will want to pray mage and use super anti fire. Mage gives +1 fire resistance and you need +3 to avoid all fire damage. This can only be achieved with BP with mage pray and super anti fire. 
---
Don‚Äôt take the holy wrench. It‚Äôs saving you such a small amount of prayer points on a few pots, and sacrificing a food spot. That food spot could be the difference of getting the kill or teleporting out with Vorkarth 1/4th health. 
---
Manta Rays are good. Swap them out for Anglerfish is recommended though. They heal higher and also allow you to overheal your HP like Sara brews. 
---
Super restores are recommended over prayer pots. They restore more prayer points so you can swing bringing 3 super restores instead of 4 prayer pots, thus providing another food spot.
---
I‚Äôd swap dragon darts in place of rune darts. They seem expensive, but all that matters is the number of Vorkarth kills per trip. If you can up that, all the expenses pay for themself on the first kill, and everything else is pure profit. 
---
My inventory setup is:
---
Potions: 
---
1 Super Antifire, 
---
1 Anti Venom++, 
---
1 Divine Super Combat, 
---
1 Divine Ranged Potion, 
---
3 Super Restores, 
---
3 Saradomim Brews 
---
Melee Switch: 
---
Bandos GS, 
---
Berserker Ring (I), 
---
Primordial Boots, 
---
Void melee helm, 
---
Fire cape
---
Items: 
---
Rune Pouch with teleport runes and chaos runes for crumble undead, 
---
Lyre or Fremmy Boots 4, 
---
Diamond Dragon Bolts (e) switch from Ruby Dragon Bolts (e), 
---
Rest of the inventory is full of Anglerfish

Jagex here, did you try fucking yourself? That might resolve the issue. Thanks for reaching out as well as your faithful $11 a month!

King, I welcome you to this subreddit and wholeheatedly appreciate your well worded post, asking a perfectly valid question. The swole dudes are a new "King" meme, King, where an image of a kind hearted male who happens to spend a decent portion of his free time bettering his body (and spirit, no doubt) engages in polite, uplifting, and good-spirited conversations with another male with a similar physique. Such posts are filled with affirmation and muscle. If you have any other questions, we welcome your curiosity and I look forward to the day when I can respond to another question from an individual as gracious as yourself. You are an appreciated member of this community and this post has brightened my day.

We dont need multiple additional slayer pets
---
Magic users are generally weak to ranged attacks and range armor typically has high magic defense.  Try wearing leather armor or better. Raising your magic level will also raise your defense against magic based attacks which may be helpful in your case. Bring food and you should be fine.
---
Probably an ironman

Many thanks, King.

So the other day i just got to an empty world on kraken start killing it get about 5 kills in. An ironman enters and start demanding i leave says its his world he was just banking, just told him that sucks have fun looking for a new world. He goes. Idk if your trolling but its not funny. I say there is an instance over there you left no longer your world. I still cant understand how he thought it was his world
---
Anyone know when to expect the Halloween update?

Doesn't matter if f2p or not. High fishing lvl or not if you not you cannget banned when you hit 3 fishing. That doesn't show anything. Show evidence

You've been featured in a new meme John
---
I think not since a skiller literally shit himself only to get second place if ehp
---
So, closer?
---
If you plan to just get one kc, do mage only or range only. Use the extra inv slots for more food.
---
&gt;why not use the dedicated house world? its better xp
---
Chaos Temple with it's high chance of not consuming bones make it more cost effective.
---
&gt;and lol training with big bones.im getting flashbacks from f2p from over a decade ago
---
PKers dont take big bones, making it cheaper.
---
Why would I call my mom dear
---
Minimize switches and focus on switching prayers and moving correctly. Since you‚Äôre only going for one kc you could focus on learning one rotation and teleporting if you don‚Äôt get it. But if you want to keep going after one kc I would recommend learning them all
---
Check the post history. The account is a China shill. Only commenting on posts related to that and clearly pro-china in them all. Even arguing against the concentration camps going on in China.
---
Thieving
---
I remember cutting sapphires and maybe emeralds until I had enough crafting for higher tier glass blowing. The exp is pretty nice; it's just kind of expensive compared to gold jewelry and glass. 60 crafting on a f2p iron would probably be just as bad as /u/Brooklynrageman is imagining tho
---
Not sure if he means he goes to work early because he plays while he‚Äôs at work or does he mean that RuneScape taught him how to grind.

Hunting black chins is good gp if you can handle it, otherwise cooking is alright gp and very afk. There's a money maker page on the wiki that has a bunch of stuff you can choose from depending how afk you want it.

Wages in this kind of sector are *much* lower over here in the UK when compared to America. There's nothing unreasonable about Jagex wages

I gave him mad respect for doing the things he did on a maxed hardcore though. Getting a Scorpia task a a regular iron isn't gonna be the same as when he did it on a hardcore, even though he had back up.
---

I think they're talking about reducing the number of worlds so probably not I'm afraid :(

If you want to make it even better take a dds equipped. It‚Äôs fun to try and spec them out after they attack. Most of the time they don‚Äôt see it in your hand.

Yo I have a really good idea for a wilderness game but idk how to contact Jagass and I wanna know what ppl think of it.. I'm no expert in the game so there will surely have to be some tweaks but ima copy paste what notes I wrote for it I hope it makes sense.... Basically the idea is to make ppl hang out in the wilderness with safe spots and plenty of skilling material and in return you get points to buy more skilling material or rare armour:
---
Simple, you get points for holding position. 3 positions, the weaker a position is, the more points you get for defending. You cannot bring anything in but points when you join, and you can only spend points inside the minigame, there is one of those walking capeseller guys but sells resources and prizes for points. The land is rich with materials, 3 positions focused on a different combat style. You can bring anything out but each time you join you pay a small fee in gp or points and can't bring anything in. It is a resource unsafe minigame that convinces people to run into the wildy. There are several entrances to the minigame scattered through the wilderness and there's a safespot bank once you past the timed portal. To combat bots, the minigame just needs requirements like several quest points and minimum combat lvl because there is a max player count for the game per world and it would be wasted to lower lvls. Kills grant points and defending your zone grants points. It is meant to be for training skills while also risking everything you gather. There are deposit boxes scattered for timed deposit, 5 sec wait before it opens to prevent safing. The points in the game in a way pay you for your time logged on and if you pvp its extra points, you lose points for dieing and your opponent gains % points that you've gathered plus your loot so bigger targets are created but each time you leave the game (to try and join another team) you have to start fresh just a cape to match your team. Resources include a large land filled with scattered coal and ores, fishing, hunting, woods, caves, zamorak monks for herbs, cows and dragons for hide etc and essence deposits with some system for runecrafting like the abyss. The 3 different teams are focused on melee, ranged, magic so there will always be a counter. You are not limited to your combat style but depending on which team you join, the resources in your section benefit one combat mainly. This game would emphasize the need for skilling as you will not go far with low levels or require a big team to gather for you. The goal is to try to gain control of the board by capturing hills for your team and once a team has full control the point gains are reduced to half but they are more consistent and safe, causing the other two teams to focus the team on top for additional points from kills off the leading faction. There are no rounds, just a continuous minigame with tallied scored and plenty of resources to convince players to spend time in the wildy. You don't have to fight or build armour but everyone is fair game and you will be targeted for game points. It has to be balanced that botting will be very difficult and unprofitable while still being reasonably profitable for high level players to train mining/smoothing/woodcutting/fletching/fishing/hunting and runecrafting. The best way to combat bots is to have high reqs which is necessary to be successful in the wilderness anyway
---
I hope this makes some sence but I think it would be a great idea to attract people to the wilderness portals and once in the minigame you will gain progress in points just for staying alive. The point system will have to be balance I know I didn't make specific details I'm just getting the basic idea of a wilderness skilling/fighting arena that requires effective skills to be successful. Right now the main wilderness attraction is revs and it gets raped by gangs all the time, in this minigame gangs would be hard to form as you have to start fresh upon each entry and the leading team of 3 will be focused by the other two for bonus points.
---
TLDR: Wilderness members only minigame attraction with skilling resources that you have to gather and create your own armour and weapons from scratch to be successful like ores and fishing. 3 teams fight to gain total control. Each time you leave the minigame you save your loot but cannot rejoin with anything but game points. This will be a great way to train skills effectively in a rich land of resources while also attracting pvpers for game points to buy rare loot within the minigame.

All companies have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders homie. The simple fact is if Jagex were to close RS3 tomorrow, or at least stop all MTX, they would hemorrhage their profits substantially. 
---
Why would they invest money into RS3 when they can do minimal work and benefit from the MTX still.
---
I'm not defending MTX but you're looking at it from the outside, try getting a business mindset and look again.
---
And do you not think Jagex (or its parent company) would LOVE to add MTX to osrs?? The only reason they cant is the playerbase, but the RS3 playerbase largely doesnt care about MTX so it works there.
---
You're naive if you think jagex wont continue to add MTX wherever they can, it's almost free money for them

At least he doesnt write a private message 'good luck in lumby lmao' while having his own private set as 'friends' or off. Prob the worst part of me getting pkd while doing wildy slayer.

Case sensitive wont fix people getting hacked.
---
All they need is authenticator delay and authenticator required to login to the website.  And the amount of players getting hacked is already reduced by a massive amount.
---
Right now if you do get hacked your authenticator can instantly be disabled and you're pretty much too late can't prevent it.
---
Whenever there's an authenticator delay it'll take a X amount of time before the authenticator gets disabled meaning you have time to fix the issues before the hacker strikes.

The area marked red is not fun in the moment, but when you look back at it in the future you realized that it was actuallly quite fun

The ideas are nice but have one glaring flaw. You need some risk because people would just 3-item, but on the other hand, what is a "risk"? If I go there on my pure with usual 30k risk, am I risking enough? If it has to be 100k risk, I could just bring noted furniture - has few k "value" but actually sells for 1gp on grand exchange.

Yeah, Dagonnoth kings have really middle of the road req's if you do them right too and are better GP or whatever per hour. I assume you're doing this for money but if you're an iron then just go do regular slayer until you have all the stats necessary since the helm is only useful off task. just because they have a low requirement does mean everybody should be killing them, sure you can but if you choose to do something too difficult for you're account thats on you.
---
the drop rate for a BIS item doesn't need to be easy, putting it on/off task being different is kinda odd but again just wait to kill them until you're on task. also when you say the majority of BIS gear; which is all literally locked behind extremely endgame PVM like COX, TOB, or god wars for the next tier down, which are quite difficult I might add.
---
I don't think they intended for auto retaliate to deal with the special attack tbh and just screwed up but if you want them to be more engaging then just dodge them all, it's pretty clear when they're coming and getting frozen does waste ticks.

Why is it 0/10? I didn't even create anything, this sytem was in place in 2010, and it was when pking was the most popular, by far.
---
To my knowledge there were not nearly as many baits back then and people did not attack you from a fall in as much back then. You could actually 1v1 at MB. Single teams tactics have changed. And edge pking was waaaay more popular than MB pking so that is what kept singles pking going, not MB. Real clans stayed in multi.

I've never seen it that dead.. just after an update or something?

They drop an incredibly item, it's a BIS for cox, which most players will end up doing for hours. Yes they're annoying to kill, but to be honest it would be stupid if such a great item came from something akin to a goblin.
---
I would be fine with nerfing them to have slightly lower defence. Any further nerfs I would be severely against unless they make the new helm worse. +4strength bonus would still make it relevant, but not straight up BIS melee helm.

you only lose hc in unsafe deaths where you lose items innit
---
You dont need to block them you can just uncheck the unlock option without spending a block slot
---
Thats is, if youre using nieve/duradel/konar

hes dressed as  Xandir P. Wifflebottom from the cartoon 'drawn together'
---
Thanks for explaining! Isn't it just 6 reward rolls per chest, though? I thought each brother can only drop their armour if killed, and you have a reward roll for each bro killed.
---
I wonder if he has an item that increases the honey drop rate or if he just grinds it out like the rest of us
---
stop being a pussy, brotherman
---
What makes you assume it will be upvoted now compared to your 157 other posts about this?
---
im done
---
There's a difference between particle-MTX-hell that is RS3 vs. a color change to robes in OSRS. 
---
I see minimum point to comparing the two for this discussion. 
---
Look at Infinity Robes, and Mystic, they have loads of colors; to wish they added a bit of variety to the BIS Magic Robes isn't too far fetched in my opinion.
---
read the first paragraph from that statement again.

**Basically, I‚Äôm the person who is most responsible for all things RuneScape ‚Äì the overarching vision and strategy, the game and developing the team behind it**

who do you think the team is always talking to, to get things cleared? ceo of *insert name of whatever investment company we're on now*
---
Oh FUCK I knew I saw that outfit somewhere. No wonder this pic felt kinda homosexual.
---
Idm some of the other stuff but man I thought the new slayer helm looked ugly
---
He‚Äôs basically a ghoul. If he paid his workers their fair share, maybe I‚Äôd hear him out. People who aren‚Äôt as greedy as he is I am much more capable of taking advice from.
---
My last post I gathered feedback, and they suggested a gold bar sink. The last post I got 100 upvotes before I deleted it to resubmit. If you‚Äôre going to downvote, please tell me what‚Äôs your logic behind it. Just curious as how your downvote would benefit the game more.
---
Valve would like to respectfully disagree with you on that one...
---
"RuneScape" meaning RS3. OSRS has its own executive producer who was introduced in a Q&amp;A a few weeks ago (Mod Fed).
---
Blast Furnace with gold can already reach around 400k+ xp/hour, definitely doesn't need to be made easier.
---
Get 99 smithing for the cape effect if you want this, because nobody sees a need for a gold bar sink.
---
because they had an initial plan for some of the cosmetics in the rewards blog for twisted league to be partner specific rewards, which to me says that's the type of mtx they were dipping their feet into the water with. 
---
the obvious initial outcry, i believe, caused them to take a step back and ease us into it.
---
And here I am, with 120 KC and 2 items, which includes a Torags hammers.
---
I'll still vote against PvP because I find the community toxic and they don't provide anything meaningful to the game in my personal opinion.
---
because if a game steps away from an established aesthetic you tend to alienate people who enjoyed it. it's a fair comparison.

Why are they so many stock photos of buff guys on their computers.

Is this post made just to ruin the good vibes we had going on with the swolesome memes?

Hmm yep. Fuck you. Gz tho

I have no idea how the three outfits and the banner passed, 75% of the voters are blind it seems.

It‚Äôs 250k xp/h not 400k.. in all my times I‚Äôve never ever had 400k xp/h.

Tell me how you gatherd "feedback"? when you're posting the exact same thing.

Just because you deleted your post with 1 upvote btw not 100 doesn't mean we can't see the image linked to that post.

https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dgzhze/new_barrows_rewards_calculator_and_mechanics_on/
---
Always thought the same, but apparently not
---
It would be nice to have a "almost passed" pool, with all the things that didn't pass for a very small percentage
---
If it their post was meant to indicate 1/256 for any piece, then it would be 1/256 for any piece and 1/256 * 1/3 = 1/768 individual.
---
Given that the post says ‚Äúeach‚Äù, and that 1/768 seems a pretty odd number compared to most of the other drops in this game, I‚Äôm going to say that it is 1/256 for each individual piece, or 1/256 * 3/1 = 3/256 for any piece.
---
You already posted this 10 minutes ago.
---
Wait shit you‚Äôre right wtf...
---
Yeah this is pretty rare. It‚Äôs been discussed by Jagex before and can‚Äôt be fixed because of engine limitations. Basically you can‚Äôt get the cape anymore sorry dude :/ gz on 99 tho!
---
Is 15% a typo? 
---
You have to kill the brothers to be able to receive their corresponding armour drop, and killing like two of them should put you over 15%.
---
I bet you're the first to get t bow before you can even wear it lmao
---
Even more tilting when you find out he has 67 range lol
---
I think this a is a great idea, would help out the pvp community and get more people interested in it without having to train up a whole account for the purpose of pvp. But I think the points for staying alive would encourage people to camp for a good amount of points and then repeat. I think every time somebody else dies you get points and you get points for kills.
---
Meanwhile, south america doesnt have a single world

We have to do tob/inferno w/ 150-200 ping minimun

I know, always exciting having new devs. Can't wait to see their work on leagues.

Are you a member? I did the event on several accounts, my members ones got the masks and pumpkin, the F2P accounts did not.

pumpkin lanterns are pretty nice ngl

Can anyone else not start the quest?

I got cooking about a week ago, was at rogues den in a crowded world. Nobody even said gz when i got the big fireworks. Rip. I know the feel, congratz bro!

Even worse is going to decant two prayer pots and accidentally right clicking -&gt; empty
---
If you really think this is a post attempting to recover an account with 8 fishing through reddit, your thicc in the head mate. It's an example showing the potential for false positive bans to turn new players away, thus hindering the future growth of the game. It's an issue that needs to be addressed. Just appealing the ban and recovering the account does nothing to address the wider issue.
---
Pvm bad
---
No, I'm not.
---
That is indeed interesting, though. I was under the impression that these items were also available to F2Pers. Not only that, but the 2018 Christmas event gave me *its* noted items back when I did that, and I wasn't a member then either.
---
It specifically states non-ironmen only
---
I'm super excited to finally get this POH theme as well. Been waiting a long time!
---
Oui
---
This kind of falls under the definition of "in the game" for me, but I can see how someone might disagree as it's not their main character.
---
Voting no on this update item because they're struggling to find items for updates seems pretty backwards if I'm being honest. The idea fits well into a Zeah themed game mode, so I'd imagine people would vote no if they don't want cosmetics/a cosmetic for BiS, or don't like how it looks.
---
Its not a micro transaction though?  And there are loads of cosmetics in the game already so why would this change anything?
---
A true king
---
4+25+18 isnt 48 either hahahaha
---
&gt; I still don't get why people pk clue hunters tbh.

Insecure people trying to feel good about themselves.

You must change your name to HCIM 1KC T-BOW

Use the spooky set on the [Ectofuntus](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ectofuntus).

Just go train prayer at chaos temple on a hardcore Ironman.
---
u use it on the ectofunctus
---
It's a completely different game, for the same reason I wouldn't say DMM is OSRS.
---
I get that it's Zeah content in this game mode/tournament thing though and I would agree but everyone complains that Zeah doesn't have enough content already, so this could have been added as a reward from something newly added to Zeah.
---
Because why would ironmen ever participate in PKing when they cant loot anything?
---
trying so hard to farm karma...
---
Ye I hate it when i accidentally alch my tbow
---
How many points did u have ?
---
Yawn
---
GG! Congrats on that RNG!
---
Yeah same, once I finish all quests I'll probably slowly stop playing tbh. I'm absolutely not planning to max, there's plenty of stuff I like in the game but a lot of skills are pretty boring, so I only do them for quest requirements.
---
Then, a few years later, I'll probably pop back in to see what's new.
---
They now have to milk the whales that are left
---
Oh yeah dude!:double runes and free teleports. I highly recommend doing that dairy before the barrows grind :)
---
This is the argument I've been making for over a year on YouTube and Facebook. Why would pvmers vote to make it easier for themselves to die? PvP is already way different than it was in 2007. Nowadays you have some insane shit everywhere you go with 1 tick gmauls, and maxed pure accounts that are extremely overpowered in their combat brackets. How do you expect some dude who has never pked, or only pked 10yrs ago or more to be able to defend against people who have op accounts and have been perfecting their ability to kill others? 
---
Especially when the victims are practically defenseless. Imagine being geared to go to venenatis for example. A pker simply needs like tier 40 magic gear (which the risk for is practically fucking nothing if they die in comparison) to kill the team or solo player trying to do venenatis. Unless the pvmers want to bring black dhide to switch to if they get attacked, risking even more money. Oh, and jagex (planned to or already has) nerfed the magic def bonus of black dhide bc pkers splash a tad too much for their liking in tier 30/40 magic armour vs one of the best range armours in the game. Thanks, jagex, solid updates. 
---
So they force pvmers to constantly go to the wilderness. For those who say they don't, take a look at the quests that go there. Clues. Multiple bis items that you can only receive there. Some of the absolute best XP and gp per hour from various things. How is it not forcing us to become your bait? Jagex is selling out pvmers, constantly making more and more content to force us there, and then making it easier and easier to kill us by nerfing our defense bonuses (like the dihns bulwark shield or black dhide) or adding new PvP armours thru """integrity updates."""
---
Does any of that seem fair? Why is it an issue that tier fucking 30 mage armour splashes against bis shields for defense and much higher tier range armour?? Pvmers risk more than the average pker as well. It's no wonder pkers target pvmers. Salad robe pk vs pking a dude potentially risking loot and barrows armour. Easy as fuck choice. Why is jagex forcing ppl who can't even compete in PvP to be used as free kills for pkers? 
---
I'd love to see a jagex employee defend this. Just once.
---
No. Make your own.
---

Iron Roxas: "I will make it legal"
---
It's not worth it unless you pay the top dog clans to protect you. Plus since content creators are making videos about these services, a lot more people are paying to be protected which makes the protected designated worlds congested meaning everyone is fighting for a rev and hardly anyone is making their money back.
---
I got 99 herb and a cape ain't one.
---
We wanted bedsheets to be used outside Port Phasmatys and we got it. Bethesda should take examples from Jagex how to listen community.

Sorry for what I said, I had a bad day

Some people are expecting phishers to persuade people to give up their backup code. Considering plenty of people still fall for phishing attempts, how big do you consider this risk to be?

Tf? Weak post

*This is not mtx. This is mtx. this is p2w. Nah this is pay to convenience. Its only cosmetic. Its not locked content because there is an insane rng option too. I dont mind giving them extra money here and there for a little bonus. Man why does content based around cash shop get so much more dev time. We havnt had a non mtx update in sooo long. Man i cant stop buying rolls. I hate this shit but cant stop.* i have heard it all dude.
---
Argue what is and isnt mtx all you want dude. All your doing by talking about that is ignoring every single other thing a company can do that is bad for the players.

IG lol go hit it up on YouTube then there's no third party websites broski.

That's the goal ;)

You are an actual dick

I'd rather the ancestral recolour came from general gameplay than from a tournament.
---
They increased the stats to stop an already too profitable drop table though and stop the influx of jaws. Why on earth would they buff the drop rate after doing something to nerd the drop consistency?
---
Did he tie your hair back too?
---
you can tell he got carried through the raid. he only had 1700 points. He is just super fucking lucky.
---
what started this meme, it's brilliant.

Yeah it is! My main Iron (Which was also in the raid) Is called Iron Sora hehe
---
What is this king meme and way of speaking?  I missed the origination.

When I was doing wintertodt I always insulted ironmen just for fun

I dont think most people actually mean what they say

It's a game afterall and insults are tradition
---
L00000000ll i just read the last paragraph you posted... you think accs are people. No an alt is a paying customer. If you constantly pay for 5 memberships why the fuck would you only vote on one..
---
What about this update other than the cosmetics is bad then?  The only thing you seem annoyed by is the reward from this tournament is a cosmetic in this game?
---
@lazy_lnferno

Obvious bait is obvious.

So have i go look at my current post history. Ive been making a cunt of myself talking about leagues.

They can also consider people getting their e-mail accounts hijacked to not be their problem, but that clearly isn't appreciated by the community.
---
I think that in this game, as in real life, we must be vocal in our disapproval of voter restriction. I believe that any way you implement exceptions to a democratic process will take away the voice of some people. And even if that group of people were already disenfranchised and in the vast minority, they have a right to voice their opinion.
---
Democracy is inherently flawed. We have to accept that if we are to accept each other. So while I respect your opinion, I whole heartedly disagree with your proposed changes to the voting system.
---
you obviously missed Halloween event 2016
---
I can't disagree with you, but I can point out that given that they've failed this poll they're likely to never be repolled again. You don't get to have your cake and eat it too in this game unfortunately.
---
Maybe they'll repoll it... I can't say for certain. But they have a long history of not repolling things that aren't integrity related after they fail 1 time.
---
To be fair the place is kinda cancerous.
---
1.7k points too!? Crazy!
---
Imagine getting this emotional over game

It's not safe tho

You are so toxic it's not even funny. Every time i see you in a comment section it's a uselessly inflammatory comment communicated with the vocabulary of a middle schooler. You need to step away from the computer for a while and recognize that the comments and posts your responding to are real people whose opinions hold every bit as much weight as yours does. Incredibly hypocritical. Stop pretending like you're an accomplished and elite player, the reality is you're an obviously unhappy individual projecting your dissatisfaction onto other people behind a shield of anonymity.
---
Imagine getting this emotional over your job. He invested many of hours, days in days out. It's different for us since we aren't depending on this game to live, he is. Content creators get a lot of smack for caring to much, but imagine being demoted in your workplace. That's how it feels

U dum

K.thx.bye

I thought I was getting tired of these memes until I saw this one.

Runescape is just an object of meaningless attachment
---
Adding to this, the hat (1/3 of the rolls) is basically useless outside fashionscape purposes given its rarity and reqs. If the hat price tanks, the extra profit from Larran's chest get even lower.
---
* Mystic hat: +4 magic att/def, 40 Magic/20 Defence to wear, worth 9-15k
---
* Mitres: +4 magic att/def, +5 prayer, 40 Magic/Prayer to wear, worth 15k
---
* Elder chaos hood: +5 magic att/+4 magic def, 40 Magic to wear, worth 400k
---
* **Dagon'hai hat: +5 magic att/def, +2 prayer, 70 Magic/40 Defence to wear, worth ???** Should have been +7 magic att/def at least, that would match the robe top/bottom which are about as strong as 3rd age.
---
* Infinity hat: +6 magic att/def, 50 Magic/25 Defence to wear, worth 4m
---
* 3rd age mage hat: +8 magic att/def, 65 Magic/30 Defence to wear, worth 11m
---
* Then we have easy-to-get +6 magic attack hats like healer hat (45 Def), Farseer helm (45 Def) and Ahrim's hood (70 Magic/Def).
---
Not sure why people buy/sell torso or whatever, I went in their for my first time ever and join random teams and within 4 hours had my fighters torso and left. It‚Äôs super easy... I am lvl 124 tho... idk.
---
I'd be curious to know what would like to be reworked? It's hard to repoll it without knowing what was wrong.
---
My gut feeling is that its because it's a BiS recolour and that turned people away but is the problem the colour? The fact it was tradeable? Hard to know for sure

Real dumb. If you send an email to me it gets pushed to my phone, which I see regardless of someone trying to delete it.

Where am I gonna store a backup code? In my fucking god damn email! Where the fuck else can I store a backup code that won‚Äôt get lost. Phone? My account was made 6! Years ago in 2013 near the start of osrs. A phone lasts maybe 4 years. 
---
 Computer file? Computers last maybe 4 years too. The only long lasting secure place to keep this code would be... in your email! 
---
Sigh
---
Why do you need a shard so badly¬ø
---
The blog post literally said that they won't remove the authenticator if you don't have hard proof that it's your account. They're making it so you need much more information about the account in question before you can gain access to it

Just get some lube, then you'll never be dry =w=

I voted yes on the ancestral ornament kit but I rather would have had it as a master clue drop anyway.
---
I know everyone's saying to make this a novelty or trophy account, but if this is your only or farthest along ironman that fucking tbow will help you mid game so fucking much. Like you can do zulrah far before 87 slayer now on top of a bunch of other shit. Use that tbow man, enjoy it.

i wore a red mystic top with d legs and a d long because it matched and i couldn't work out how to start monkey madness

Please dont stop. These are great.

But remember, cosplay is not consent!
---
The idea of the boss is interesting. The rewards are too much for a side boss. Possible 2 new BiS items and 1 great upgrade for already very good gear.
---
black dragon hide already is a pain to deal with in pvp so adding a stronger version that's possibly cheaper than kharils would be eh. 
---
I think this boss would be great for lower level armor/weapons though. There's probably plenty of holes to fill under tier 70
---
This is why people don't like untrimmed cooking capes.
---
~850
---
He had 1792 points
---
1792/8675/100= 0.002
---
2/69= 0.029
---
0.029*0.002= 0.000058
---
Pet 1/25,632 = 0.00003901
---
0.000058 x 0.00003901 = 2.26e-9
---
1/2.26e-9= 441973324, so around 1 in 1/2 bilion
---
That‚Äôs 77rc though so i‚Äôd imagine you don‚Äôt have it, ZMI might be a way to get there on mobile though. You can go at your own pace.

I started playing runescape in the early 2000s and I dont have a clue where to find these bosses kind of things.

Pkers will always need spades and clue hunters will always look for clues so it won‚Äôt die just yet /s

It is if you're lucky enough to find someone willing to buy your services right after you fucked them over.

Can you try to put the set into a poh, can you get back the originals after spookifying?

Highly recommend Zeah RC after 77. I get at least 200k xp everyday while at work and I will be getting 99 soon enough!
---
Your missing that they would have 7 days to sort it out. Your missing that the hacker cant just take all your shit and ‚Äúwin‚Äù with one successful recovery. An auth delay would have made the method mod jed use to hack ineffective. 
---
Usually how it happens is you fuck up and the hacker recovers, takes gp, moves on. If there was a delay then you can fuck up, have 7 days to fix shit. Now this relies on jagex seeing ‚Äúwow this dude is from nyc has played on the acc for 5 years from nyc and on that ip for 6months, and this other dude (hacker) hasnt even played rs on the IP he used. We fucked up.‚Äù Still. But at least you have 7 days instead of 0 seconds to correct it.
---
Yo talk about having to manually contact the support team as if there is one. Random cunts on Twitter don‚Äôt count.

Just write it on paper lmao

Calling it poor is giving it too much credit. It's absolutely back-asswards.

Or, you know, you keep it backed up in several places or make a physical copy of it as well. Do you store your bank codes and CC information in your email as well?
---
Is dying in the wilderness ruining your day? Lol
---
wait so he cant use the bow or even alch XD
---
Don't think they have brid anymore ):
---
so if I keep playing everyday, the option to disable the "Losing Your Backup Code &amp; Authenticator" will be disabled right cus im active? or will the hackerman just send a request and then after 72h it will get disabled?
---
Oh cool. Thanks

They'll get a Halloween themed pris lamp promo soon dont worry haha

Man I‚Äôd give you an award if I could !

I‚Äôm not on the whole ‚Äúthey‚Äôre too strong nerf them blah blah blah‚Äù train, but there‚Äôs absolutely no way you completed a task of 220 in 2 hours. I‚Äôm 120 combat with bis gear and a task of the same length takes me upwards of four hours. 
---
That being said, I don‚Äôt mind that at all. I get them pretty regularly and they‚Äôre decent xp. I‚Äôm also a huge fan of drop tables that barely break even unless you get a unique. Not everything in the game needs to shit out money.
---
On task, 80kc. Then another at 222kc.

u cant even wear tbow

If you lost access to the auth, then you lost access to the account
---
I mean they are half way there.
---
Just add more hp, lower task amount to other boss Slayer tasks (I don't play so idk if they have lower tasks) and then increase the drop rate accordingly.
---
Guy prolly put in an offer for 100m the second the update released so he could get the first one

It‚Äôs currently not possible to change your login email. However, you can change the email you‚Äôll receive notifications at. Basically, the email attached as a login, is merely just a login name

Hell yeah brother!

It actually is one of the two best ways to max rc In f2p. With skull scepter pieces you can get up to 55k xp/hr. And if you want to be really sweaty, you can bring 2 running alts and a running killer alt in a pvp world to get this to 60k

---
Personally I just don‚Äôt think they need to be recolored. Everyone is always asking for items to be recolored, but what is wrong with the original? Not every high tier item needs a new skin or color IMO.

They added his comp to the mac filter so he can run their accounts through since he's rngesus

Can we have the option to have the back-up code sent to your phone?

If this were a Bethesda game they would sell 'convenience' items for irl cash to help with the grind...
---
That's a good way to scale if something is too Grundy vs reward.
---
I should've clarified.  The login doesn't matter.  What matters is being able to activate/deactivate authenticator and stuff like that.  If my friend changes his notification email, will he get a confirmation link sent to the previous notification email? Or does it just change without asking permission?
---
Played castle wars for hours to buy the gold decorative armor only to find out it was the same stats as adamant...

anyone?

That doesn't really affect how fast you can obtain them that much. I think it still would be fastest to kill something like rats since they only have 1 hp.

How will you be able to get them after the league is over?

What he could do, is trying to change his contact email. If he needs to verify that on his old school address, your best bet would be to contact jagex (@jagexsupport) on Twitter. Other than that, change your email first and then its authenticator
---
Yeah and rapier price is dropping faster than you‚Äôll lose money on tent whips as well, so it‚Äôs not even efficient gp wise
---
Also typing this gave me depression because I just realized this is how I think about my favorite game, maybe I need to make an iron man and play with no guides until I get back into the do what I want nostalgia section again.
---
King, I understand your worries but I am sincerely sorry to say that we can't stop. These memes reflect our inner self and what we aspire to get to, we cannot get to this goal without sacrificing something. I am deeply sorry for how we taint your image in the eyes of your dear family, friends or even absolute strangers. I shall pray to every God that you will not experience negative consequences do to our actions. Stay strong champ!
---
But you have to lvl range through pc now, so you don't get hp lvls üòõ
---
I don‚Äôt want to either have to play a game mode that isn‚Äôt really for me, and not be able to progress my main at the same time - to get the recolors on my own. And the alternative is probably a massive price for something that‚Äôs coming from a limited time game mode. Thought they looked great, would rather it come as a clue reward or LMS/BH although that probably wouldn‚Äôt fit
---
Or how about just a 10% VAT? #YANG2020
---
In the FAQ it says they'll be obtainable in subsequent leagues once this one has ended, with points earned during that new league.
---
Just look at that FOOT

u know screenmarkers are bannable now

Oshit ive always dropped em lol

I went 65 dry when I first started them :( I was 100% sure I was doing something wrong haha. Gratz on one of the nicest drops :D
---
Congratulations, my dude. I would just remove the ironman mode and sell it. Buy some gear and skills. Invite friends to do some bossing. Well, that's me. Again, congratulations!
---
Yes.
---
Range.
---
Amen!

Exactly, my science professor flipped a coin and said he got heads 3 times, then had us do the math to find out what the chance was he got heads again. Like 3-4 people said 6.25%, most the class said 50/50 because each flip is exactly the same chance. Large numbers applies to the chance that you don‚Äôt get the pet being low over a large period of time, but at 4K dry he‚Äôs still no more likely to get it on his next drop than his 1st.
---
Bet your chair stinks

No one knows but it‚Äôs provocative!

You may not appreciate our visual appearance and it‚Äôs okay. We all have our own, personal styles and ways how we act - and that makes us all unique. I enjoy my body but I still appreciate your opinion. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you are wrong, it‚Äôs your opinion that matters, king.

Halloween event in lumbridge I believe

Thanks, guide is fine :) finished it

wut...

So you're stealing these and selling them online right? RIGHT?!?!

Even recovering an account will require you to input 2fa when logging into a new device.  With no way to remove 2fa, the account is secure.
---
At 560 kc now, haven‚Äôt gotten one yet... 130 more on task atm so might get lucky
---
Speak to Oziach first.
---
Croissant looks like man
---
wtf this is insane
---
lumbridge swamp
---
I second this. Going for narrows gloves gives your account a good foundation.
---
Meanwhile my ironman is over 100cb lvl and I still cant kill jad or zulrah
---
I had better luck converting it in the cauldron behind the  building in the lumby swamp.
---
He was streaming before he got off and was last killing dark beasts in search of s dark bow
---
It was a couple of months of just afking, getting about 30k xp/hr so I'd say total time \~325 Hours
---
It does look amazing. Every stab looks like it shreds the enemy.
---
Well, yes but actually no
---
Swampy sink by the shack in Lumby swamp does the same thing for f2p players
---
Yeah resetting aggro or something I can understand but something longer like banking is fair game for anyone to take your spot.
---
What happens in wintertodt stays in wintertodt.
---
Reply recover your account. There is an option to say you don't have access to the email. You'll need to fill out a recovery form with old passwords and info to prove you are the owner. If it gets declined they will likely ask for specific information. Be sure to add additional notes to check the IP you've been playing from if that hasn't changed in a while.
---
Hmm, I highly doubt that. I wouldn't really consider the duel arena to be a part of PvP as it's essentially just a casino. I would think the biggest GP sink after that would be the Vorkath death bank.
---
G4gp it sick
---
I'll definitely be watching his series now that he's a normie. If anything, opens more doors and makes the videos less stressful to watch.
---
If it's true you can't change recovery questions that's pretty awful for sure, no arguing with that one. Obviously being able to change them should involve entering the backup code / authenticator so.
---
I have 99 slayer on a def pure and only did takes with duradel, you seem to be misinformed. Use partner slayer.
---
choking hysterically on floor laughing ?
---
3 hours ago when I woke up I saw a post of someone selling 6 pieces for 10m each. They really fucked themselves on that one.
---
Slayer points.
---
dunno why but this made me kek quite a bit
---
Big brain move here: Unauthorized people can't access your account if its disabled...
---
Wtf i want angry posts
---
Yes
---
Obviously not. Not like they didn't put out part 1 of this ages ago and have been working on it well over a month.
---
Someone‚Äôs a bit salty
---
Man I made my account like 10 years ago how am I supposed to know that shit
---
I like it
---
I gotta get level 5 in all roles for Elite Diary. I don‚Äôt have hundreds of mils sitting around so have to do it all in pubs. I want to commit cliff jump.
---
I won 400m btw ty so much
---
I'm still waiting for offline mode so I dont have to see any of you fuckers. 2200 total worlds at 3am are already too packed.
---
not really one kill at vorkath nets you back your lost money, and I wasn't referring to the duel arena but actually to pvp
---
You know what, I wouldn't even be mad if they let people do that.  I'd laugh my ass off when a guy runs up to me with a dragon dagger and quad specs me yelling "**SIT"**
---
Not at all, and I don't see what this has to do with the post.
---
Gotta pay the keeper. If he don't get no tolls, then he don't get no rolls.
---
Jealous, I'm at 800 and 20/24, guess I need to do 38 more before bitching?
---
probably "queen runs"
---
Only one I voted no on as well.
---
hey hey im working on it okay! getting piety rn! bursting next!!
---
Children in Africa could have eaten that d pickaxe.
---
Probs because it wasn‚Äôt made public, by Jagex, that they are known to give false positives. 
---
So in hopes of appeasing Reddit/public, they‚Äôre offering compensation for time spent falsely banned.
---
With not a single reward, what the fuck is the point of the Twisted League now aside from wasting time on an $11 alt?
---
Damn yea they‚Äôre that one bad apple from the tree lol
---
The ornament kit was going to be tradeable post league though
---
Not with that attitude he isn‚Äôt
---
Damn you get colored graceful as a reward this event?? I gotta complete it now
---
I'm curious since his is a few mil more even without gems, did you spend the nuggets? Also what level of the fally diary did you complete?
---
You are saying you can't get tasks from higher slayer masters,but you can.
---
I'm grinding Corp for an Elysian. I'm having fun to have fun later
---
yes jagex pls tell google to tell me to secure my email. thanks
---
They are two separate outfits.  You can get the beige one back from django whenever you want
---
Makes sense then, thanks
---
I split with him, i'm not a shit bag
---
People keep saying this, yet I see the password security standards are either holding steady or getting even more extreme.  As much as I‚Äôd like to take Reddit‚Äôs Word for it, if the security industry thinks something is still actual, it‚Äôs still actual.
---
Maybe you were f2p for a longer time back then and were less active? That's the case for me :)
---
I gotta say, even with elite kand + multiple torsos sprinkled across the past 10 years, I feel like I suck at defending. Sometimes it just feels like they ignore the food completely and it just frustrates me. I blame it on the game having shit pathing.
---
Go to Django in Draynor Village.
---
*I'm in this picture and I don't like it*
---
That's a unique achievement. "Yeah, I got bandos pet before any bandos items" can you say the same?
---
STR Cleric build
---
I'm surprised they didn't fix the LMS bug rendi used in his latest video, figured it would be patched right away
---
Screen markera are not, markers that show exactly where next attack lands etc.
---
Spaghetti code tradition continues even in MS Excel
---
I never brought large amounts of the same food, I presumed my character would get more HP if I gave him a varied diet because someone told me so. I would train with 10+ different food items.
---
I did dragon slayer but liked the look of the chain body more so I never bought a platebody.
---
I would lure nubs to fist of guthix when it was in low level Wildy and snare them over and over just to freak them out. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to kill them in 7 Wildy levels but they would try and give me stuff to not kill them.
---
Skills dont get hard till about 70-75 i feel like. Unless its rc mining or agi.
---
That it's more realistic.
---
That doesnt say what you think it says. 
---
If you go to their faq page they will say that you can only remove auth by using email. Heck they even imply it in this blog. But this is untrue because you can recover an acc to remove the blog. There is nothing in this blog that states jagex will be stopping that procedure. 
---
It also doesnt explicitly state that the person will be locked out of the account. Jagex could be making the assumption the person couldnt access the acc without auth. 
---
If the process is: recover account then wait 3 days for removal of auth, then thats good. But it doesnt state this in the blog.
---
Has this been polled yet?
---
If you cared about exp/hr you wouldn't be at Zeah
---
I'm the same way but with rocket league instead. And minus the balling computer
---
Oh my bad I misunderstood, you‚Äôre saying you can only ask for a new code with the Authenticator app? Not with the email. 
---
Gotcha okay, that makes sense. But it also means these codes aren‚Äôt really necessary to keep track of. It basically means you have two Authenticator codes, one with the login to the game, the other with the ability to change your email/remove the Authenticator. That‚Äôs probably fine then.
---
I hate you for no particular reason &gt;:(
---
The majority of people in this game don‚Äôt play IM in the first place. Maybe that‚Äôll attract some more people if they have a friend group in the game. But it‚Äôs not like everyone is going to be piling on to play GIM.
---
You mean like the trophies that are exactly that and passed? That's unfortunately not true.
---
Good. Keep your grimy hands off of my stuff
---
Yeah and the effect from the total number of plugins add up.
---
I just got it through the new one
---
Suggestion: Make queen an assignable slayer target (after Like a boss). Suddenly everyone finishing BA.

Honestly I'm surprised that guy doesn't have 420 honeys per day with that swag setup.
---
are there any features that might secure my account from an unwarranted macroing major ban?
---
Tbh I prefer it short. Cba doing them when they take 20-30 min.
---
was a fun miniquest
---
Man I remember my brother had a 9hp scythe account back in the day, that thing was a relic of times gone past.
---
Woah

&lt;3
---
Jurky is that you?
---
Yeah I love having ridiculously oversized anime style weapons in my medieval game.
---
It is stable, in the past 10 months it‚Äôs gone up 15m
---
What's the actual chance of that?
---
I'd prefer they didn't
---
I don't see why they decided to fix red x stalling in 1 area and left it everywhere else. It wasn't even broken in tob, just made the room take about 3 times as long.
---
Seems about right. People do it for the points and because it requires low input not because it's insanely fast.
---
the halloween masks won't sell for even 1k so chill lol
---
Try using overloads instead my man. They make a huge difference. Also keep in mind that as ur stats go up the exp per hour will noticably increase. 85/91 attack and str will be a huge increase from 81/91
---
Vastly underclothed built dudes, it's homoerotic. That's okay because our community is very gay. We share what we like as a community &lt;3
---
Best pickaxe, prayer xp, pve bosses, pets
---
Don‚Äôt do hard if you‚Äôre doing the obsidian, afk for 15 minutes method. 70k is fine with your gear if you‚Äôre training something other than str. I‚Äôm at 90 atk 96 str right now and I max out at 80k doing it with prims and fero gloves. 
---
70k xp when you‚Äôre afk for a huge amount of time is good xp.
---
Peak male performance
---
A trophy for actually playing the new gamemode is objectively incomparable to the other rewards.
---
Youd think so. But no, its actually that high
---
please remove the arbitrary skill of defense from the game and let me pk level 50s doing pvm without any account restrictions at all
---
cwaso
---
Will hween masks be dropping anywhere?
---
**That's the joke.**
---
Jus t got a false ban as well (1300 total almost) and appealed. 
---
Fucking stupid shit i have 100s of hours into my account. I sent a ticket but im not expecting much. I made a post and it isnt even showing up when i check new.
---
the orichanium made it hard for it to move so it just sits where it knows prey will come and waits for them. that's why it's so fat.
---
F2P aren‚Äôt really customers
---
Well given hes 75 range w bow id assume its an alt

Afk bbds is a viable alt money maker while also being good xp

All jokes aside, please indicate the seriousness of your comment. Its not immediately apparent whether you've put the jokes to the side or not.
---
Nobody expects the redberry pie inquisition
---
I remapped keyboard and mouse buttons to a controller so that i can easily do all left-click only skills to 99. Best decision i ever did to maxing total.
---
Gl on maxing!!
---
i like remapping f1 and f2 to my mouse and then i can switch between whatever menus i'm using on the mouse buttons
---
A controller? Like... eh fair enough
---
Don‚Äôt tell me how to vote.
---
Way too confronting if you ask me lol.
---
Your computer actually temporarily saves all word documents for a while. They can be found somewhere in you AppData. Look it up to save yourself the hastle next time!
---
It gives you a higher chance per kill to obtain one. Depending on how they scale below level 50, like they mentioned in the post, you would likely see an increased speed of obtaining one via the current method.
---
Thanks :)
---
Get Thurgo a special redberry pie delivery for Christmas, so many people have done Knight's sword that he is probably starving and running low :) Thank you for my spookier robes!
---
You‚Äôre the joke pal.
---
My man Melvin got 2 back to back 5‚Äôs on goblins with an iron scimmy. Watch your mouth.
---
He says that was locked up and that he tried to home teleport and they just hit him. Then my character says  he'll go talk to them and when I do that it does the same thing as before
---
Also I couldn‚Äôt start the Halloween event wearing it either. Took me ten minutes to realize I was wearing it and why I kept ‚Äúwoooing‚Äù at the goblins
---
Sorry for spamming questions every few days guys, I'm really trying to avoid any bans in case it's not a mistake and actually my fault
---
How little should someone need to know about your account to override all the layers of security you've placed on it? In all honesty, I'd rather they didn't help players who lost their Backup Code - it's just opening the door to the same account recovery abuse we've seen for years.
---
Thanks for the response, king. I know being grammatically correct is my own responsibility, and I have nothing but appreciation for you pointing this out.  I'll strive to work on my grammar, and hopefully one day achieve grammatical perfection, much like yourself. I wish you the best in your future endeavors. 
---
Thanks again, champ.
---
Thank you my man =]
---
Yeah, and despite multiple people asking he's offered no additional clarification.
---
I think people hate on noobs because they know that every noob thinks these guys have no life XD
---
Voting no to all pvm updates especially slayer
---
Woodcutting is only ranked from 40 and higher though so it would kinda look out of place.
---
Bro these swolesome memes literally bring a smile to my face every time
---
It's very afk if you only play one rd alt. You usually only have to eat in-between kills which takes almost a minute. Sometimes you get hit pretty hard though so it's a bit random. I use runelite idle notifier and set it to 40 hp and 15 prayer. That way you don't have to pay much attention.
---
Try speaking to Bob at Bob's Axes
---
Im fine with the way it looks. No need for the good job with the tone that i hurt myself
---
I wouldn't say never...
---
*Tries hiding rune scimitar*
---
id only level up range now to get the right level and just start flexing in the ge with low lvl tbow
---
I'd honestly want this event to remain as a permanent (mini)quest!
---
why do people flex HCIM when it's cox where it makes no difference whatsoever
---
Just email it to your RuneScape associated email /s
---
No worries, after inktober i will be releasing more comics, this time, ones you can follow, containing the quests of osrs. Still trying to figure out exactly which order to do the quests. Ill still be posting regularly.
---
That's it?
---
Can someone tell me why my spooky set was taken away after completing the event? Confused as hell
---
So non-Ironman can buy the rune pouch, but where do Ironman get it ?
---
I hope so I remapped my mouse keys to F1 and F2
---
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME???!!!!!
---
This king helping me slay the queen
---
Slime fast

---
Jagex is powerless against some vowels? 
---
Dunno though, that is weird.
---
Lets be fucking honest this wouldnt be an issue if jagex would just stop selling our account information to the chinese.
---
There is a CC for that my friend ;)
---
Don't think you're the only one but why f1 and f2 lol
---
hook me up please lol
---
I want to disable account recovery and instead use the proposed backup codes. That would be my ideal solution actually. The fact that this option isn't available is absolutely jagex' fault.
---
Because they‚Äôre mapped to the prayer tab and inventory tab in OSRS :)
---
For me anyway
---
What point in the video exactly? I‚Äôd like to check it out for you. Maybe I right clicked
---
By that logic, password length also doesn't improve security right?
---
7 million / the xp per hour you get
---
This is true, I guess it depends on each individual‚Äôs risk tolerance, fair play
---
Wine, kind of
---
Yeah, this only protects person only from having their email hacked, not from social engineering (which is the way big targets get cleaned. Its not like they don't have secure emails, they get recovered).
---
Think you mean 73
---
I didn‚Äôt even do the event but the set was already placed in my toy box in my house
---
This is the best crafted comment I have ever seen 99 crafting sir?
---
Anything between 60 and 75 should be discussed further, tweaked if possible and polled again.
---
I see they gave us the port phasmatys robes after everyone begged them to let us wear them outside of the city, except in a different way
---
That works aswell mate
---
This is good stuff right here, thanks.

The void set is already broken... whats the point

This is a guide on how to do the defender roll properly, you'll be getting a lot more points and the games will take 30 seconds to 2 minutes as long as you teammates call and don't mess up the lure

They're frog-leather chaps :)

*cries in abyssal bludgeon*
---
What exactly does one need to recover their account should it be compromised? It‚Äôs not stated, it just simply says that clearance will be ‚Äúvery high‚Äù. I would like to have everything i need prepared in a safe place incase something were to happen to my account.
---
Yes! That would've been good! Though technically the void gloves are worse now I think, since there's no set effect haha
---
More like ruined nite
---
Ive seen it sometimes used by people doing Wildy altar prayer, dihns, imbued heart, arma helm, Karils top as +1 and Karils bottom as loss, really good mage defense once you boost your mage past 99.
---
It also pulls double duty at scorpia for the boost to a trident + mage defense with low defense otherwise.
---
Good to see people giving credit to Jagex where it's due. I have no problem with people posting false bans on reddit (with sufficient evidence) but it's nice to see people taking the time to show that Jagex is attempting to right their wrongs.
---
This might be my favorite ye,  awesome work king

All jokes aside, we're migrating to a react environment soon. But for now, we live in a weird environment where we run on Angular but occasionally import React components.
---
Again, he wasn't saying that Curtis' corp grind is comparable to Kacy's master grind. He was saying that Curtis also deserved to flip out. Although, I would personally venture to say they *are* comparable - you also have to realize that Curtis is an ironman so every supply he used during the grind had to be earned.
---
Sounds like  shill for botters Kappa

overloads you have to look at and click on the screen every 5 minutes
---
supercombats you only have to look at and click on the screen every 15 minutes
---
obviously overloads are better but they're less afk

going with 55k xp/hr its about 127-128hours

Oh fuck how do they know this specific place
---
Each kid manages 1 account
---
Problem solved
---
what did I all miss If i done event on a account with less then 200 skill total? I know I missed the rare rewards ( pumpkin and mask) but what else?
---
Hahaha finally, what a dramatic crybaby
---
its cool but not as cool as the SGS with ornament kit... that shit is just epic
---
I just googled Edwardsville TBH lol.
---
Then it would be a hasta, not a lance....
---
A playstation controller?
---
thanks
---
I can't see fucking shit out of this thing!
---
Yoo, that's all the kills I need to 99 range?
---
Dope. The grind will begin shortly.
---
Even though I am not the OP in this particular instance, I'd like to personally thank you for taking the time out of your day to better this community. It's people like you that keep us all going. Cheers to everything you're taking on in the future, champ.
---
It's definitely better to get rapier first. You can always sell it back, and you're getting tent whip level dps without degrading anything. I also remember hearing that Slayer tasks are on average more weak to stab than slash.
---
How can you not be aware of how you died I don‚Äôt understand
---
450, I'm at 6 in 1.8k kills now
---
1-2 hours a day is more than I can manage and I feel I‚Äôm able to skill slowly but surely. A grind is a grind no matter the speed :) 
---
I use wiki and some YouTube videos for guides. I also use a skill calculator to see how close I am to my next levels. 
---
Give me a shout if there‚Äôs any specific questions I can help you with. Can‚Äôt promise I‚Äôll have all the answers but I‚Äôll help you find them for sure :)
---
well not 1kc first time but first trip xD
---
Absolutely worth picking up osrs. Start out with the wikis efficient questing guide to get a good start.
---
its so bad. i gave up and just settled for an obby platebody until i can afford bandos because fuck that toxicity lol.
---
I think it will cost a little more than ahrims. So rip the guys that that payed 30 m per piece after update lol.
---
In absolute agreeance, best part is I have seen alot comments where people actually talk in this super wholesome fashion. Sure it's a meme but at the end of it's still people expressing themselves in a good and wholesome way
---
Oh no...my dude needs a kebab.
---
Wow why is everyone here such huge dicks. Grow the fuck up, stop being jealous. At least keep it to yourselves, I here congratulate you
---
Good on Jagex
---
"J-J-Jmod smackdown r-right guys?"

-Fucking worthless sycophant.
---
It does, it just kinda tops off after a certain amount of characters. I‚Äôd assume if someone is sitting next to you, it‚Äôs easy to remember maybe up to 7 characters, but it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to remember after 7+ characters. In my experience, case sensitivity has lead to more inconvenience than helping, but that‚Äôs just me. A password like Aboss170 is pretty much the same as aboss170. Why not just use different letters instead of caps? It gets especially annoying because it‚Äôs forced upon users. I HAVE to have a special case and capital letter and I can only remember so many passwords.
---
Time to shine my bone dagger

Im waiting for morytania updates group boss etc

Did you seriously put a can of monster and your phone in front of your shirtless dad and take a picture?
---
It's 2019 and some "hardcore" players dont know what a RSMV is. I don't wanna imagine what it will be like in a few years
---
A job and a hobby. Maybe if you had those you wouldn't cry so much.
---
I can only play 1-2 hours per day and sometimes not even that, but when I get free time I hop on and enjoy it. 
---
The game is essentially the same as you remember it but now there‚Äôs a lot more new content and some better/more efficient ways of doing things. There‚Äôs plenty of guides on YouTube and in the Wiki for anything you‚Äôre looking for. 
---
I‚Äôd say login and get a feel for the game again and set yourself some goals to accomplish and just work on completing those goals, you‚Äôll learn a lot quickly as you go and research the task you‚Äôre working on.
---
I remember I got a perm mute when I was younger in 07 lasted a year and got unmuted when summoning was released had 27 offenses with mutes before I finally got perm mute, I‚Äôd say tweet one of the jmods on Twitter about it they might review and remove it seeing as it was 3 years ago

I was so confused why I couldn‚Äôt say anything besides wooo wooo woo

Boss, the swol guy memes are helping the osrs community stay positive and friendly by exemplifying the strength of players that are the best of the community through actual strong men. I apologize for the inconvenience these memes may have caused you or the social ramifications of thier appearance on your screen at your place of work. But, I must continue to support these memes as they have resurrected my interest in the game and homies support homies. Best of luck and congratulations on 45 fishing boss.

Do you know what game we play? People only care about efficient training methods and cosmetic mini bosses that follow you around. How would you incentivize people to play the game with no rewards? Nothing will succeed unless it has good rewards. Cosmetics are the best choice for this scenario because at the end of the day they‚Äôre just cosmetic and are worthless. Rs has done this before with skin colors from various promotions.

Most of my coworkers play WoW so nobody really cares tbh.

Dont tell me how to live my life. Blame jagex for putting pvm content there.
---
It's the wilderness. You agree to the possibility of being pked as soon as you step over that line. This coming from someone who leans heavily on the pvm side of the game. Don't go if you can't handle it, drop the clue if you're gonna blow a gasket when you get pked for your spade.
---
There are plenty of vids where people who are doing clues forget to bank their teleports and other items, and they drop literally 50-100m even though they were "just doing a clue". There's a reason they pk everyone they see. You never know what someone is carrying. 
---
That's a really lame way to rationalize a personal attack on someone for just playing the game. 
---
Git gud and you won't have to be salty over your ever-dwindling spade collection.

Oh okay, sorry I looked up the ghostly robes and just found the mem item, this is my first halloween event since getting back into the game!

I'm actually astounded that the ancestral didn't pass. I don't know if anyone is really voting no because they can't afford ancestral (especially given that it's only like 100m right now), but either way it is disappointing. The slayer helm is hideous, and almost everything else is purely cosmetic. The banner, the trophies, and the armor are all never going to be used. The home tele is pointless since nobody uses home tele anymore except when they periodically forget a tele. The house style is pretty cool, but I don't know how many people will be willing to put in 100+ hours for a change to their house style.

Thought so, that's why I specified "on speedrun.com".  Since there're only two submissions, and BA enthusiasts run that shit like crazy, I figured there'd be better times that weren't recorded.

4-5 hours isn't that much. Remember, it includes the weekends, so that's 35 hours over the full week. If you play 10 hours on the weekend, which still leaves you plenty of time to exercise, you're looking at 15 hours spread out over 5 days, or 3 a day on average.

Say you're working 9 to 5 and get home at 6, that's the equivalent of playing like... 7 to 10.

Everyone bashing you for faking the thread, the fact they were made so close together is odd yes but if you‚Äôd take 2 minutes to check out the 3 reddit accounts involved you‚Äôd realize they‚Äôre 3 completely different people, highly doubt this dude has 4 year old reddit alts laying around just to make an osrs post lmfao

it's a meme because a lot of people did it without a guide back in the day

I don't know how you're saying "you're missing the point" while somehow trying to make a claim that my point had anything to do with people being upset *in general* about someone else having an insanely lucky roll. That's not what I'm saying at all. That is a *perfectly* human response. Never once did I claim, or imply, that was my worry.
---
I *explicitly* made my comment about people who actually get upset *at the person* who got lucky. Which I'm guessing you missed the point of, since you felt the need to clarify "if you're referring to," when that's explicitly who I was referring to. Along with that, I don't really get why you say "that's completely irrelevant here," when just between the time of these comments I've seen multiple people expressing that very disdain *toward this dude* over a lucky drop.
---
You're insanely hung up on everything I'm saying being **directly** in response to someone in this comment chain, even though I very specifically said people like that *exist,* which is unquestionably, and that it's sad and a dumb way to look at things. And the person I responded to who said "I mean he literally got carried through it so yeah" was saying that in regards to someone (jokingly I'm sure) saying, "Legit no idea if someone should say 'Alch yourself' or just congratulate him."
---
I feel like that was a lot of irritation on your end to try to insult me when you like... vehemently overlooked the context of everything I said. But if you feel the act of you misunderstanding the entire point of multiple of my comments while actively ignoring context puts you in the position of making "brain dead" me understand the "retarded shit" I said, then more power to you. You can really make anyone seem braindead in your own eyes if you just continue to not comprehend what they're saying, so you've got a bright future ahead with your hobby.

They are. Group ironman requires the clan system update prior to release and the dev team is already working on that. There are also separate dev team members working on that while simultaneously working on the Morytania expansion.

Hello , I am typing to you regarding here that your sentance was mispelted with the word "Grammer". its actually pronounced grammar. how ironically it is that you wrote that wrong in the same sentance where you said you don't know it. Just wanted to curect your english.
---
Why? It's so obscure and tedious and finally gave 3 cb's a chance at boss pets among other PVM challenges. Why remove skill-requiring depth from the game? I understand that it was unintended and it could maaaaybe affect the integrity of LMS but people are trying to survive in LMS anyway. 3 cb's were given only a single world to do this in and now with the method being known it'd extremely difficult to even get a single kc without getting crashed. If abusing higher range bonus, prayer, and level than the player actually has is the issue (though obviously trivial since you can only fire 30 cballs before having to run all the way back) then let the cannon fire with the levels and bonuses the player had when they entered the game. Removing depth just because it was unintended seems like an unintelligent long-term decision for the game as whole.
---
King, your meme brought forth a great amount of air from my nostrils. Your clever formulations truly capture the feeling experienced by the people who frequent this game we all hold dear. Yet I feel compelled to point out the smallest of errors in your otherwise commendable post. In military parlance, 'over' signifies the expectation of a response, whilst 'out' signifies the lack of that expectation. The amalgamation of the two terms to form 'over and out' is a misnomer that originated with Hollywood. Believe me King, my aim is not to bring you down for such a simple mistake (speaking from experience, I was myself only recently informed of this common error). May rng be with you

You‚Äôre right, an encrypted notes app would be a much better alternative. Either way a hacker would have to go to extreme lengths to try and access the back up code and most of the people that play this game a grown adults and should be able to find a way to memorise and keep a 6 digit number safe.

Frankly, all the stuff that is missing looks like it could be currently worn and/or stuffed into the G.E.

If you really were hacked though, you have my condolence.  My only RL friend that played with me quit because of being hacked like this.

One of the funniest things I‚Äôve ever read. Thank you for making my day better OP
---
Solid!
---
Hope your risk:reward stays this positive.
---
It depends if you‚Äôre gonna get members. IMO f2p gets boring very fast (although plenty of people do stay f2p). If you do plan to get members, do it early, rather than skilling in f2p first. A lot of members quests can get you past the early levels in many skills, and you unlock many things that make your gameplay more efficient so that you can spend your 1-2 hours doing something you want to do without wasting as much time walking/grinding inefficient moneymakers.
---
But yeah in general, do some quick early quests (and diaries) to get past early levels, then just do whatever you enjoy!
---
My first thought was I could see fucking out of the damn thing
---
I actually have always enjoyed pc alot as well. I find it pretty fun, and like building up those points to dump 100 into a skill id like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è its been awhile since ive done it though and was considering it today, and after your post im definitely gonna go back and just enjoy the fun of it. 
---
My question i guess would be, what do you ultimately find fun about it?    I always liked the teamwork and as long as you didnt have a lot of afkers, it actually would go by fast. I also noticed while training range there, rangers/mages have the best spinner pulling from the portal. I could drag a spinner across the map if i wanted to.
---
Good luck to you! Though I'm not planning on playing Twisted league. I'll probably sit this one out and enjoy the streams because I don't want to quit progress on my main. If I play it will be on my alt for a bit while I afk my main.
---
All good m8 xD

Who the fuck upgrades from bone crossbow to tbow immediately?
---
Yah, it does. Still, it is a BiS Helm so it is a bit weird if players are fine with an Olm recolor coming from Leagues instead of Raids, but aren't fine with an Ancestral Recolor doing the same. Though it could also be that enough players just don't want recolors for Ancestral, Bandos, Armadyl, and such.
---
Keep multiple pieces of paper with your back up code on, at your work, in your car, at home, at your parents house or in your neighbours house, just in case each one of those burns down and you need a code

We‚Äôre adults, we can keep a 6 digit number safe and memorised without complaining about it being stolen, or lost in a house fire.

Jokes on you, pking never gets content updates and will vanish away because of it
---
I actually just got a wyrm task but have never done them b4. Whats the best method of attack? And r they somewhat profitable?
---
If cost isn't an issue then ice burst/barrage maniacal monkeys instead.
---
If you want cost effective AFK training you can fire bolt with chaos gauntlets in Bandos for about 45k an hour. Try to maximize defenses without going below 0 magic accuracy. Bosses you want are Count Draynor, King Roald, Sand Snake, Trapped Soul, Me. If you're missing any of those, The Kendal, Tree Spirit, or Khazard Warlord are decent options.

tl;dr

I hate this mindset. Just because YOUR bank is larger and 20m is not a lot to YOU does not mean that losing your entire bank can feel devastating. He still has to start from nothing and I'm assuming your "\[mY\] bANk Is OnE biLLioN tHat'S nOT eVEn A lOt" account has higher stats to start earning it back faster than someone with a 20m bank. Losing progress is annoying no matter how much.

No to summoning as a skill because I'd have to practically max all of my accounts again to get enough charms.
---
Also the higher level familiars were way too good. Namely:
---
* Unicorn stallion: healing special that stacked with combo eating.
---
* Wolpertinger: made barrage max increase more than ancestral did. With the way magic buffs work now it would be useless though.
---
* Pack yak: 30 items BoB + ability to bank items even at mage bank with it's special
---
* Steel titan: +20% flat defence buff + special attack that could hit up to 90s.
