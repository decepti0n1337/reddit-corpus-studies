Test it. Run in p2p to 75% and see how long it takes to replenish and repeat in f2p. A 10 minute experiment

OP wants to suck his dick

Pm me if I can have it

Gz got mine on attempt #3
---
Honestly dude looting BH/PvP worlds is probably better money than green dragons, and you'll just blend in with all the other looters/bots
---
Damn that’s a good post
---
Run some barrows or do the slayer
---
I can't imagine runelite being the problem. 
---

---
Another thing you can do is lookup your email on haveibeenpwned.com to see if your email has been compromised, it's pretty normal. I would also suggest you to have different passwords for RuneScape and your email, and maybe even set up 2 step for your email. Good luck

In the same kill I got an occult necklace, pet and a hard clue scroll from thermonuclear smoke devil. 1/108m drop rate

I have like 12 days of membership left and like 30 slayer

in what world is falling down an agility obstacle 20 times in a row in the underground pass "emotional support" lmao that shit made me want to break something
---
Fucking dick fuck.
---
But Warding is dogshit and the community shouldn't be denied quality of life updates such as wizard robe bottoms because we don't want Warding. Spined armor is also horrible right now too

Respect

why are skeletal wyverns still agressive toward me after 15 minutes?

These bugs were definitely coded in on purpose. The Corp beast bug went alongside the pest control bug where these bug abusers would create countless accounts and train them indefinitely in pest control where they would bug out the minigame and cause it to never end with portals never losing hp either. They would rock cake down and dh the portals for insane exp n hour to quickly get them ready for corp bug abusing.
---
Anything non-pvp related? I just wanna kill monsters for loot
---
Whats your mage lvl and budget for gear, have you rfd and underground pass done?
---
what stats are we dealing with here? and how much bank value do we have to work with?
---
Mis-click brews, now I have even more health muahahaha
---
So don’t do them? I don’t get why people complain about this...
---
I have different passwords for everything and I appreciate the help thank you
---
looting bag takes 15 minutes of thugs (generous estimate) while rune pouch takes hours of BH or slayer. Once again, totally different and you're missing the point.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
If your stats aren't very good that won't be too efficient
---
Daaamn
---
*distant reeeeeeee-ing*
---
[removed]
---
Sorry if I'm wrong here but isn't this an independent probability , meaning it doesn't matter how many clues you do, the probability of landing the boots is always the same?
---
Chaos ele is absolute trash money
---
The only people who would vote for this are people who don't play on W45. This is a horrible suggestion and is really unfair to the active players who only committed so much time under the impression there would be no reset.
---
No support.
---
If you wanted to make a new world, by all means. But don't touch people's hard work just because a streamer said it'd be neat.
---
I've killed thousands and thousands of green dragons at the central spot, north of the graveyard. Saw like 5 pkers in total, 4 of which I could tele before they even attacked. 
---
Best way to get there is carralangar teleport, either as tablet, house portal or regular spell. I've seen other people use games necklace corp beast teleport, but you have to walk a short while through multi if you use that teleport.
---
You’re delusional if you think someone could bang out a video, everyday of the year and it be top notch content. The effort alone was focused on actually getting a video out everyday. 
---
I’ve had another mate that tried releasing 1 vlog a day and it absolutely destroyed his relationship. Give the man some credit.
---
Damn throws me back to when I took my friend to raids cause he was maxed cb and had a tbow... came w arclight to spec olm lmao
---
Would love to know how you've edited this.
---
But it would be something passive during slayer etc instead of a seperate grind with eclectics because nothing you kill drops mediums anymore...
---
nerfs? konar's profit hasn't been nerfed. The average loot per key is the same as per drop before keys, and the drop rates are the same as they have always been. you cant do a measly 5 tasks and complain about slightly bad rng lol
---
Sweaty fucks.... It's not hard to calculate 50/50
---
And that's why we need 5 copies of the same mechanic for each different skill.
---
You have my sword (and upvote)
---
I’ve done Konar before they changed it to purely keys. I’ve definitely hit her loot table numerous times off of every task I did. That’s not what you call a nerf?
---
Absolutely stunning
---
*how u know where jad spawns*
---
**Notice how two of the same monster turn into a higher level one?**
---
*ya two magers before jad*
---
**Jad spawns where the orange mager spawns, before jad round starts**
---
*oh, how will i know where jad spawns? which one is orange?*
---
**One of the two magers before jad round will be orange. That's where jad spawns**
---
*what prayer should I have on tho, this video says i should have sound on*
---
Story?
---
Something something increased dementia risk
---
No. dont spread misinformation when you don't know what you're talking about.
---
my ban was removed shoutout to u/GodHandFemto 
---
also lmao at the downvotes to my post saying i was banned y'all had NO faith
---
no, its called worse rng. the drop rate for a key is LITERALLY the exact same as hitting the konar table was before keys were added. and the average loot per key is the same as well.
---
Nty
---
Use the rest of your membership to train agility up to 70 (65 minimum if using a summer pie, or 67 min using a 1 dose agility potion on your return voyage).
---
This grants you access to the taverly dungeon shortcut, which makes killing Blue Dragons a really viable money maker (upwards of 500k/hr with a high range lvl). 
---
Once you hit the required agility lvl, all you'll need is a stack of falador tabs, some duel rings to hit clan wars to regenerate, and maybe a range potion to buff kill times.
---
The agility will help massively down the line as well.
---
Resetting the servers is a silly bandaid fix that only hurts long time W45 DMM players. They really need to fix the underlying mechanics of the game mode. All seasonals ever did was kick the can further down the road. All of the rule changes, level caps and content locks simply slowed the inevitable decay inherent to the game structure. 
---
I think an intelligent step in the right direction for DMM would be to incorporate combat brackets like pvp worlds, where the further from the save zones you venture, the greater the range of people who can attack you. So outside a safe zone might be +-10/15 levels, but as you went further away, that bracket would rise like wilderness levels.(imagine a topographic map, with each safe zone being a mountain and the lines radiating out from it would be essentially wilderness levels)
---
I'm sure there are some details to iron out, but this change would introduce a much greater amount of account variety(not just a push to be a max main), and make the game mode playable for a lot of more casual players.
---
I think the smartest approach for Jagex is to continue tweaking seasonals with an aim to eventually create a season that doesn't die off rapidly, but can sustain a respectable active player base. At that point, they could launch a new permanent deadman world.
---
When are you playing? I'm at around 130 kc and I've never seen a team and been pked once, but only because I was being an idiot.
---
Nardah. I also just found out Dorgesh-Kaan has a bank, since it doesn't show up on the world map.
---
You don't need to see it range is the delayed sound to attack, magic sound is before the animation 
---
That's why you always start praying range, when you hear the magic sound you have time to change prays
---
Most banks will dismiss randoms
---
I just did Another Slice of HAM and I *love* Dorgesh-Kaan sooooo much. I really want them to finish that quest line now.
---
I think the players who completed all sigils would be annoyed.

He should've just gambled the tbow. Double or nothing

Interesting way to get rsns and post history lol
---
Leaving for 5 minutes feels like you're missing something in your day.
---
We had bets lmao, add me Stinky Phole
---
It will run out by the time i get that agility it's only 29 right now with like 12 days left I think. Shouldn't I just grind them out and use the extra 2 or 3 minutes running through the dungeon and then worry about that once I'm stable getting bonds? It's only like an extra 2 minutes of running I feel like without the agility.
---
Have you played it now?
---
Potions are 30k a pop
---
Mysterious emblems are 30k a piece
---
so you want people to grind for emblems (for example) just to be able to get a single brew off rng?
---
Free skill that takes for fuckin ever and you have to compete with bots everywhere though
---
Thats what turns Nieve to Steve???
---
Yes sadly. I won’t spoil when where or how though.
---
and youtube doesnt pay as much anymore
---
Graveyard and Enchantment are decently fast. Do telekinetic while you're at work or something. Alchemy made me tear my hair out though.

Careful that old bastard thinks the mm2 reward monkey is a junk item.

Except lunar island bank. However you gotta stay there otherwise the tele will dismiss him

No matter what jagex does will cause clans to happen. Might as well force clans like castle wars style

I dunno what you're saying with "dying with maiden scores you with -4" part but you get -4 points everytime you died. I'm not sure what you're saying?
---
I posted my Nintendo Switch version of the same project a week ago. I want to thank the OSRS subreddit for turning toward the PC version, the capabilities have become a complete game changer. 
---
And this is nothing, the people on the Minecraft subreddit have put together insanely beautiful works of art on a massive scale. 
---
But I do really enjoy mixing two games together.
---
Some cant be arsed to grind for torso

:crab:

you're joking ryt ???

Congrats! That must have felt good

Nice. But then you realize base 80s is roughly like 16% of the way to maxing.

We're always heading for another recession. That's literally how the business cycle works.

Not really, no

Kill wyverns or BBDs if you want afk safespot farming

Dg or stealing creation, something that scales to you and requires no gear and team work I think os is missing.

That's fair enough then

I'll have to look into those. I'm only at 65 slayer currently.

In RuneScape, the plate skirts were always cheaper than the plate legs, by a lot, so I bought them instead.I didn't want to be a man in a dress, so I changed genders, I looked cute! But that was weird, so I stopped! Then I went and did the quest, recruitment drive, where one player has to be a female; I eagerly volunteered "Oh me! I mean like, only if I have to, I guess".
---
Then I just stayed a girl. I liked the attention I got, it was nice. It started to feel like a more genuine version of myself, I started to think of my identity as a metaphysical thing, I thought of it as another version of myself, who I preferred. I wanted to be that person, but I knew I never could, so I started growing a beard out, and tried to be a hipster. Eventually I just shaved off that beard because it just didn't feel right.

I played WoW, and the only reason I was a male on there was because of the pressure to be in voice chat; I abandoned my original girl,night elf,beastmaster hunter, and made a buff looking,orc, enhance shaman, with giant fucking shoulders. It wasn't until a decade later that I got back to WoW and remembered how much I missed that version of myself I made a blood elf, protection paladin. My guild had this running joke of posting haikus in trade chat, mine was
---
"Hey guys look at me, don't you think I'm a hotty? *Has dick IRL".
---
I think my old friends could tell I enjoyed it a little too much.
---
Years after that, I took mushrooms and had this weird out of body experience, I was just floating in the room and forgot I was even human, I was the version of myself that I made up. I just didn't want this side of me to be a secret anymore, so I started treating it more like it was a real thing, "I guess this is what being trans is".
---
I felt so strongly about it that I started considering HRT, which seemed like it was crazy to me. I thought I was out of my mind. Eventually I just had to stop caring whether it was related to my mental illness because otherwise I'd be an anxious mess all the time about it. Apparently it's not something I can really bury, like I tried to so long, I wasn't going to get rid of it, I might as well embrace it.
---
I had a lot of self hatred for a long time over it, and it feels good to just be open about it.
---
Thanks! Also, do you have any tips on pvping? I have been thinking about getting into it, but feel like I might not be able to really do well.

Then you realize your name is GatoradeReptarFetus

I remember walking around Zeah on day 1 thinking “there is literally nothing to do here”.

ay lol prostitution is legal in my nz so they dont get beaten robbed and given sti's
---
This assumes no one died in the raid. Everytime you die, you will be subtracted 4 points from your performance score. Forgot to place a 4 on the minus part ;-;
---
Is that a gilded defender in your inventory?
---
The only reason I do them is the dust drops. I'd have grags blocked entirely if the dust was tradable.
---
Yeah Idk how much engine work they'd have to do to keep pushing updates but at what point would it be best (if ever) to just upgrade to a new engine completely.
---
Slayer staff e will always have a higher max hit on task
---
It’s all relative to what your killing. Sometimes you need more def armor against harder enemies
---
It was mind blowing when it first came out. Like we all thought it was impossible for a short while.
---
Do you think it's time to sell now, or wait and see if it goes higher?
---
In my opinion this seems to be the case where the price will increase too much and then dip back down.
---
Mhmm girl, I know that's right lmao I'm with you on this train girl 💪😎👉
---
yes this was done tile by tile  
---
yes it took me an hour and a half  
---
yes i love my idiot son
---
Have you considered zooming in?
---
Just let it be its own game. We have a great oppurtunity to be the most hardcore game there is, don't ruin it.

I lost my Hc status logging in right there about a month ago
---
I don't got time for this. My man's got two jobs.
---
Vids are always awesome man! And twitch too!
---
Really you think people who've spent hundreds to thousands of hours wouldn't mind LOL???
---
Instructions unclear, dick caught in birdhouse.
---
But we already have so much from RS3 anyways, I'm not saying I want all these new updates but some RS3 content is/was really fun and I'd consider doing that content again if it came to OSRS. 
---
Regardless it was just a hypothetical question, not pushing for it to actually happen :)
---
You doing Skyblock or something. Why is your floor cobble. Grass looks better.
---
Are you gonna keep playing?
---
Will you please shut the fuck up. Looking at your post history the only thing you do is continuously thread hop insulting people. 
---
Such a strong opinions you have calling people morons, retards and idiots when you’re pretty obviously one yourself.  Sit down when you piss, post bullying little bitch.

Archers helm or any god coif.

Bro this thing is gonna blow up

I like it, but there's some really dedicated players on w45 who might be upset they can't play for a month.
---
yeah its skyblock lol. Our Island looks awful.
---
You're in the clear, logging out and in too many times kicks you to protect the servers. 
---
You've broken no rules. Just give it a few minutes and you should be good to go.
---
Damn my RuneScape character is like 400 years old then.
---
i'm in!
---
Hm without the rare drops?
---
My agility must be too fast then
---
You need a fundemental understanding of the runescape economy to do it well. Items flucate day to day, some alot while others not much. Learn some margins then buy and sell. Also when a big crash happens be ready to buyyy some cheeap crap to resell later.

I'm not really mad, just astounded at how I ran into 3 posts in a row where someone can clearly understand English and is fluent in the fundamentals of the language, yet they cannot grasp a simple concept that 99% of people have no issue understanding.
---
Like you. 
---
The 8 starter points are not for supplies. You already get points before the first chest by completing the first room. The 8 points are solely there to incur a punishment if you die before the game would reward you with points. This is presumably because jagex can not/did not want to count into negatives.
---
3 people clarifying and the original infographic and that simple fact is STILL flying over your head. I'm legitimately dumbfounded.
---
As for the other recents: guy is getting out dpsed by a blowpipe while using a rcbow. He claims to make 20+ threads asking what the problem is. Most fucking people with braincells would consider using the weapon the person that is out dpsing them is using. Just maybe.
---
The last one is a pker complaining about the state of pvm and how boring bosses are, WHEN HE LITERALLY ONLY PKS AND KILLS REVS
---
I shouldn't have to explain that one.
---
 Turns out to be pretty good loot with the looting bag despite bh being highly popular for bridding/nh now.  loot tab at the end of video - all kills/deaths are accounted in this video as well  If you like just pking and music, you may enjoy. Thanks
---
Osbuddy exchange
---
Cheers!
---
I think at least it would be harder to feed if it meant sacrificing yourself so your teammate gets an emblem (or an equivalent item). But then again maybe they make it totally self sufficient and killing people would just slow them down and make them lose items
---
The kevin Durant of reddit
---
Bring more pixel art to areas of the game!
---
Where else would be large enough we could do this???
---
The bigger issue is the section of warding v3 talking about the rune pouches as well as allowing purchase of rune pouch with slayer points. The later kinda killed a large amount of the demand for emblems
---
Some dude called me his princess.
---
This guy does not PK.
---
If he replies with it he'll have a hundred messages looking for their share lol
---
That looks more like 13 kc and no zenyte...
---
That's the fuckin' way she goes bud
---
Kinda weird how he talks about the current state of wildy pking too.
---
Personally I’d steer away from begging. Go to wilderness pick up steel plate body sell them, full black d hide ( if completed ds quest, if not chaps and vambs are sufficient) rune c now, broad bolt/ addy bolts. Now two routes you can do is wildy slayer. 2 task and I guarantee a emblem drop or key drop. From their on out purchase gear accordingly.
---
Step two: ???
---
Step three: profit
---
You know I'm some what of a minecrafter myself.
---
What are you praying and what potions are you using?
---
Forthos dungeon is still ages away, it might peak just before it’s released and on the day and then level out. Completely speculation though.
---
to the top u go

Shouldnt have to wait 20mins, its 15 hops during any 5minute interval.
---
Everyone at P1: Guess I'll die
---
have you ever actually done TOB? Is this a joke?
---
Unless you are doing free for alls with actual retards this is not a thing that happens, and if your team has members like this you probably wont even complete TOB at all so the extra damage in your name wont even matter.
---
What is dat
---
O shit 45 finally got a ge imma rejoin
---
sex is great but have you ever got a double item barrows chest?
---
Why not just do this in a new world and keep 45?
---
😂😂😂😂 but for real though
---
This is good stuff. Nice critique on the range-best-for-everything.
---
do you actually carry guam leafs everywhere hoping he shows up
---
Same shit happens with dhcb and still feels good
---
I stole them from a farmer..

but if you see him, u dont need to guess
---
Bell pull gang can’t relate
---
Top post tomorrow.
---
Looks sick bro.
---
Since you get 18 points from Maiden all the way to Verzik and 1 deaths counts as -4, you would have -20 points and you starting points are already 0 since you also died at Maiden and Verzik. Having 6 deaths means -24 points and a fresh cabbage.
---
You should smooth him and paint him
---
I needed this thank you.
---
&gt; Unless you are doing free for alls
---
Obviously this wouldn't happen in a premade group... so Yes I'm talking about FFA where people will 100% try to skew odds in their favour...
---
It absolutely isn't though. Guthans cuts your exp pretty steadily. Obviously it's more expensive but at higher levels you can replace Guthans with just SGS specs.
---
Literally just walked away from my third Jad failure. I’m broken.
---
Wow only at lvl 94 combat nice
---
Could easily be an afk mining alt but i guess that went over your head as a possibility
---
lmao isn't a replacement for a period you know.
---
Dude, you a god
---
Man, I'd give my left nut to have Summoning in OSRS.  I'd love to see Dungeoneering in OSRS as long as it's only a minigame.
---
The hardest part will be getting BIS gear for inferno and actually doing it.  You can easily have an acc stat ready by then.

Me and my 15 gf alts been payin my rent 🤑🤪

And a period isnt a replacement for ur shitty personalityyyyyy

Um excuse me I throw snowballs on long range for maximum velocity impact

Bright side is heavy ballista is pretty food to bring raiding! I went 600 kc before I got my first one so I know the struggle a bit. Judt hated killing them. Good luck bud!

I couldn't agree less with this post. DMM W345 was never meant to reset. The biggest problem I noticed when I recently started playing there was that muleing is pretty much META. And I could see why, but there are some high level players with big loot, but they are really hard to kill. There is a W345 Discord channel with community hosted events and sometimes some screenshots of big loot keys are posted there.
---
DHCB good
---
A
---
I never imagine eating food can get you kinky.
---
Ranger boots, second bis boots for range behind pegasian boots. Only obtainable from medium clue scrolls, average drop rate is 1/400. OP had horrible luck.
---
Well looks like someone finally beat runescape
---
Nice
---
Best you can do is suicide method and bring dinhs, Black d’hide top and bottom, camp protect mage and protect item. On your run to the altar be ready to log if you see trouble ahead.
---
Sounds like its more of an rng thing at that point unfortunately
---
Just bring a whole inventory of bones, switch world when you see any white dots. If you get caught by a barrage or whatever, just pray and use your bones as fast as you can on altar.
---
skip peak hours too
---
Also have you considered that when a tank gets low, they simply step back to switch the aggro? Losing no dps?
---
Well yeah, but not everyone has 113m to throw into a single weapon.
---
Fucking too graphic at the end there.
---
What are you using to play?
---
This just made my day lmao
---
I'm g-not a g-noblin, I'm g-not a g-nelf, I'm a g-nome and you've been gnomed!!!!!!!!!
---
Definitely 52 for smite, unless you're specifically going for less offensive pressure and more defensive buffer as a proselyte pure.
---
Posts like this help me believe that there is a god
---
It's worth if you ever plan on doing master clues.
---
?
---
Thnks you just saved me like 30 seconds per run lol dont know why I hadn't thought of that
---
I repurposed my granite maul pure into a low level revenant killer.
---
It has 89 agility and everything you could ask for in a revenant farmer other than rigour and 1-click tele (possible with Pharoah sceptre)
---
Working on NMZ now to imbue my salve amulets!
---
You're welcome
---
When you reanimate an ensouled Graardor head
---
Get rigour. Your increased range attack and damage will kill him much faster, and your increased range defence will make his ranged hits damage you for less. It's expensive but worth the one-time cost if you can't afford DHCB yet.
---
This changes everything.
---
I don’t like the idea of locking an entire skill behind a spellbook...

Got mine at 61 on iron ore for the 714k rate. Gratz my dude people will hate you forever.

don't know why you're getting downvoted, but this kinda post would be great in r/banktabs tbh, the variety that loot tabs bring is definitely welcome

Easier said than done my guy. Recommendations for how to get the 100 mil I need for that?

Thanks pedant. So mmk should have known where jad would spawn because in 2015 they made not static.....
---
It’s called context, can you give me the definition of it?
---
Antifire shield
---
Average drop rate is 1/283.6 as calculated in the top comments. OP's luck was beyond terrible, especially for a tedious grind like this (have to get the jars, have to catch the implings, have to do the clues, etc.). Killing bosses for drops is a lot faster and more tolerable for many.
---
Gnome in da Zone.
---
Noob
---
They are phishing links lol "Your account ImMoray has been stolen/perma banned". yeah no it hasn't scammers
---
Barrage is less dps than range, and protect prayers don't raise your defense, just cut the damage.
---
So protect from mage isn't gonna prevent you from being frozen, it's just gonna half the damage.
---
So you might as well take away their main way of damaging you while you finish up using the bones on the altar.
---
If you have the same patience you do for the video game then no shit.
---
Nothing is complex here. Research cool new trends, put money into cool trendy thing, it either pays off or it doesn’t. Don’t put it all in one thing.
---
I guess you are right. Some players won't get 60% Arceuus favor, but I never thought of warding as an early game skill. A 60% Arceuus requirement which may even be adapted to be gained alongside training warding as a tutorial seems very intuitive. Herblore is blocked by a quick quest, this can be just the same where the spellbook is actually accessed through a quest tied to the Arceuus house.

Just hop worlds 4head

LuL ppl in ffas leave if not mvp at maiden.

So far im 7 qp away from 175 then i can finally finish rfd
---
Regular void is barely worse, it's not that bad to not use elite lol. 2.5% damage is nothing when you already got 50% from the cbow and salve. And the prayer bonus is literally irrelevant. It's just a little bit of money saved.

Cool story man. Imagine trying to troll on a forum because you're a social reject in real life. Yikes.

Torso is part of a diary anyway so at the end of the day you might as well get it.

I saved a hc here killing a wizard for him he was freaking out lolol. Pay it forward

Might be hard with some of the colours but your right.

Castle wars may also work?
---
Love this game, just getting back into it. Any good clans your aware of? Would love to find an active community again.
---
I want one made lol
---
Thank you!
---
Bcp is only better than torso in the way of defense. There aren't *that* many instances where you actually need that defense

The fun for YOU is the content.

224 kc with no unique drop at all from demonics ;/

The higher your str the higher you can hit. The faster you can train. However it’s worth going 60 attack then 70 str to get into the guild I’d say.
---
Yo wtf remove this
---
To be totally honest, I'm glad the OP is happy but I really don't care about these posts. I feel like these posts are just upvoted as a kindness to the OP moreso than because it's interesting content that makes the sub a better place. I suppose the OP wants validation for some reason but I've never felt the need to post any of my achievements on here
---
wtf dude

I died there within the first hour of making an Ironman (thought I had nothing to lose making a HC). Probably would have died somewhere else anyways but it tought me if I ever make another HC never ever go afk even if you think you're safe
---
You are saying this as most people are dry for stuff. Average is a drop rate not 1800 clues.

Yeah someone put some crabs on this shit. 11 goddamn dollars of my hard earned money every month.

Never played EOC and been clanning since 2004. Clanning is the most exiting part of this game and it needs more intergration so more people can experience the game to the fullest.

I've tried, 1 mil in supplies and I cant even get him down

This is actual gold lololol

Keyring is from the quest One Small Favour. It's not really new, came out over a decade ago. It's super useful and the quest takes like 2 seconds, the guy just asks you for one small favour after all.
---
First off, don't expect much from tinder.

You could same you like backpacking into the wilderness with the bare essentials :P

I'll do 1mil

Training with wip is slow because it is shared xp. Get 70 att, then use a saradomin sword to train str/def

That’s the risk of going into wildly.

No one cares get over it people can be mean move on

When I was getting 94 magic at mm2 caves I got crashed twice, but I ended up making 1 of them leave and then had another guy log in and helped anti crash the 2nd. I would aggro a bunch of the maniacal monkeys and separate them from the group so both of us were getting like half the exp. You just need to make them realize that they're wasting their time, if you care enough to not give up your spot. Especially when they realize you're not going to leave no matter what, they should give up eventually.
---
Fuck I hate ironmen
---
for an experienced player that knows how to join casual ba fun runs it's not bad, but the average player is gonna take 3-5 hours getting it

really not worth when you can just buy an obby plate for like 1.1m

not like you can't sell the obby plate later as well

Taskman better than swampman

these same parents are the ones who had them more out of obligation and treat them more as property than people

I love how it shows in the minimap too! Thats so beautiful!
---
in other words, it's more efficient to wait until you have higher cb stats and can breeze through BA with a competent team
---
not like you're gonna be doing masters or kandy elite at 60 cb
---
A proper clan system (citadels, separation from FCs and CCs, etc.)
---
Your not wrong I just think of myself. I can give up a spot for a new player and do something better you know? I know there’s lots of spots for crabs but there always crowded,
---
There are still a lot of teams that work with a tank for maiden for some reason. They usually mock me when I try to tell them you don't need one whatsoever lol.

Black demon can be done with gorillas?

Check out ruthless PvM. But I gotta ask, why are your eyes yellow lol

I was wondering when Slayer gets actually profitable, or if i'm even doing it properly in the first place. I'm only 36 slayer right now and high 40's to about 50 in combat stats. I have Vannaka as a slayer master too. If there's anything else you need to know to help, just ask me. Thanks in advance!
---
Just hop when a rank 3 fucking tells you to boy
---
Just go kill some Ogre$$ for some gp that will ultimately help you when you get to p2p. Seriously ogress warriors and shaman are super nice for the F2P players! I tend to use firestrike on them anyways.
---
rarely do you ever need a tank chestpiece, tank legs (usually verac) and torso/obby plate are often enough for most slayer tasks until you can afford bandos
---
&gt; For whippers and beginner raids.
---
No.... Beginners are not going to be clocking 30 minutes. Try 40-45.

d bow spec at minimal hits a 16 with d arrows so he got really unlucky with the anti.

50k GP/h killing some level 40-50 monster. Suggested equipment: Twisted Bow/DHCB.

Cheers mate. My eyes are yellow from the cape. It works with all capes its a clipping issue. You get red eyes from the strength cape haha
---
Just keep grinding for it unfortunately :( It took me a bit too and destroyed my bank, but it really does pay itself back very quickly if you plan on grinding Vork out.
---
The diary req is getting max level in each role, not a torso. The hard diary requires you to buy a granite plate, which only takes a single queen kill.
---
Torso is needed for a master clue, but you can put it off for quite a while.
---
Yeh exactly. Death should have more consequences...
---
just depends on how much you value your time. in the 3-4 hours it takes the average player to get a torso they could instead make 3-4m, buy an obby plate, and be 2-3m towards whatever other gear upgrades
---
Mercury poisoning is not a joke. It kills 7/10 hcim

guthan's is a noob trap anyway, so easy to teleport everywhere that it's faster to just bank and grab more supplies
---
I guess you were looking for a smarter comment than just botting/ macroing? Well... not today! He was probably botting/ macroing.
---
Im all for adding another faction (Guthix) but I dont think adding neutral creeps is the way to go, it should be centered around PvP. The reward shop should see a rework and a new ticket system because people have boosted for current items. So totally new rewards and new ticket system, could be 2 tickets for winner, 1 for #2 and 0 for #3.
---
Hey sweet, im about to get into that next year as well, though it wont be in the US sadly. In my final interview i mentioned that i was market making magic logs on runescape and they loved it haha

Congratulations!, the QC is my goal on my current account as well, i've owned it in the past (RS2/RS3) on two different accounts, it does feel empty once you get the cape though in my opinion.

Arma is only +6 over Black Dhide and Karil’s.

A proper continuation of quest lines.

It’s weird not having quests associated with items like spirit shields and D claws.

you know what, since you apologized, we forgive you :)

About 50/50 chance to get it or not within that year.

no, since i bot im able to live a normal life, take care of myself &amp; get girls. I wouldnt be able to do that if i devoted so much time to a game.

How about just use keyring on door...?

Man, there's something in this world that gets me rock hard like nothing else, and then there's phat booty white girls.

The first thing is runescape.
---
She'll (the spider boss) drop a unique that's probably BIS against her, not so much against other mobs. So the price hyping for the bludgeon isn't that justified me thinks.
---
check out RsPeer, newest bot on the market. Some people have botted 24 hours a day for weeks, and never got caught (using free scripts too)
---
All u need for pvp is combat stats. At 3x xp rates 99 att/str/def takes like 120 hours, mage maybe 25, range like 40, so less than 200 hours for a max main. If you cant even spend 200h in a perm server runescape isnt the game for you.
---
once i hit 99, i  stop training it. i really doubt i have any impact on high scores.
---
This was legitimately good

Okay cool, ty bro. This is legit? Like no keylogging and shit? How long you been using it

Wait....... that's not real music?

Whats up

How big was the cash stack

Ah fair enough, currently doing slayer for 100 combat so here's hoping I get some burst tasks

Mith gloves tho

yeah, ive been using it a few months. The good thing is all the scripts are new (made in 2019), compared to other bot clients where scripts are years old &amp; jagex has caught onto it.
---
Yes everyone on reddit has 99 slayer

I'm sorry is this some kind of non DHL with max melee gear I'm too rich to understand?

I ain't got time for this. My man's got two bot farms.

It can but their range is huge. They really only move more than a few tiles if you're hiding and they don't have a line of sight.
---
Haha good answer man!
---
Vorkath and zulrah are much more mechanic-heavy, zulrah especially, but they might be a decent step up depending on your gear. Probably want mid-80 mage and range for zulrah if you've never done it, or mid 80s range at least for vork.

Facts, this post is spewed out every DMM cycle with little to no case for it by the OP suggesting it. DMM has its problem, yes, but it's miles ahead of a competitive CW scene.
---
Introducing more untradeable BIS similar to chaotics sounds like a better idea. Useless to hackers, stakers, and gives less incentive to RWT.
---
I don't see any benefit to 'binding' already tradeable items. People will whine to support to un-bind their items. Just like the blacklisting from DA idea. People will just whine to support to get themselves unbanned from it. And Customer Support is not your psychologist, denying these requests would just be bad for them.
---
Abyssal demons is a fast task to burst as well. Even jellies can be bursted, although a bit more annoying to stack.
---
Is Adorable that man who pretended to be a girl online for years?
---
She has perfect pitch and/or synethesia.
---
Yeah I agree gamblers are gamblers, but i think they can put something in place to prevent u jumping the wildy gap, or leaving corp cape if you have a binded item wouldnt at all be hard. 
---
I personally find if I lost a bil and still had my tbow whilst I wouldnt at all be in a rush to get back to zulrah anytime soon, if I did ever want to come back would be a lot more likely with a tbow there. But I hear ya, how long would it be before you’ve accumulated enough to go back to the arena.
---
I’m not a staker, I havent gone in months and months, but why cant they just put a ban on the arena for players? I dont get it, more bad then good comes out of staking. Keep the duel arena but the betting element is toxic.

It's cool, you left your total xp on so I hacked your account, thanks for the free 99 magic

---
OP: “Hold my tiara”.
---
You burst smoke devils and they're literally the highest exp/hr task in the game. Those have magic defense so you need ancestral or ahrims. You can burst ankou for quick points. You can burst tzharr as well and bloodvelds although velds require like 2 alts to stack them
---
Wait, is that actually a security risk? :/
---
Yep!
---
Id love to see how high up the high scores you manage to get, seems interesting! Whats your RSN?
---
Slayer points are bound to your account, not bound to the slayer master. With tasks there is a nuance. Regular slayer tasks count towards your regular slayer streak (e.g. 12 slayer tasks competed). These do however not count towards wilderness slayer tasks and vice versa.
---
So in short, points are tracked on your account (both points earned from regular and wilderness tasks). For tasks there is only a difference between regular slayer masters ands the wilderness slayer master.
---
Its a stupid equivalency, because you've got cause and effect backwards.
---
Phats aren't expensive because they're a status symbol, they're a status symbol because they're expensive, and expensive because they're discontinued.
---
Pets are considered a status symbol because you need good RNG to get them. With how almost literally anything can give a pet now (which were stupid updates,) almost everyone with 2k+ total will have got lucky *somewhere.* 
---
I don't walk with either of mine because it doesn't show any achievement. It just shows where I happened to get my good RNG. Back when there were only wildy pets, which is how it should have stayed, it was much tougher to get one just by random RNG somewhere, because there were only a few hardly used places to be lucky.
---

---
Can we have a vegan cooking skill please?
---
Y tho
---
You only want to burst nechs and dust devils cause you can get them to stack on to a single square easily in the catacombs. Theres some extras like smoke bursting abby demons and ice bursting smoke devils but theyre much less main stream so forget it right now. The other stuff like black demons you mentioned aren't burst tasks because you can't stack them in multi on a good square. As far as gear goes, you want to maximise mage damage bonus primarily (slayer helm, occult, tormented bracelet, ma2 cape, kodai,  ancestral) then secondarily prayer bonus. The best option being vestment robes which are cheap. Mage bonus is not important, you don't really need to know why but it dictates your chance to hit, except the monsters already have a near certain chance to hit
---
drr drr drr
---
Yeah can definitely see that happening! “My friend binded it” or “i got hacked and someone else binded it” they could put 10 warnings in binding items and people will also still say it was an accident!

Don’t accidentally shift click it

Clearly if you write runescape bots, you don't get girls

I am getting saltpeter right now and I'm watching Theotrix's guide. In the guide there is a bank very close to the saltpeter pile. I don't have this bank though for some reason... I am really confused.

What is the best place to bank your saltpeter? The closest one to me is super far.
---
Where do you go for medium clues?

How's about asking the dude next time, instead of taking  a creep pic and then posting it on reddit
---
Yeah fair enough, I wasn't going to swap helmets anyway though. I'll just have to get used to 5 switches it just always ends up with me flailing around my inventory looking for an amulet or blowpipe :D
---
Whats your safe word?
---
I just did change it. The only reason I asked is because after it happens I check my bank and nothing is missing and I didnt see an increase if levels that was noticable
---
The way if do it is three teams, but only one castle. At each team's camp you can gather supplies and stuff like you can now, and then head to the castle in the centre of the map. The objective is to hold the position at the top, rather than a capture the flag retrieval thing. With three teams, the single team who controls the castle is always outnumbered to prevent them winning easily. The people inside will also not be able to restock on supplies. This will make the castle change hands multiple times during a match rather than letting it get stale.
---
I wouldn't mess with level or gear scaling, but different tiers like at pest control would be a good idea.
---
Yeah and he did wrong like all streamers who accepted donations. So I think he cheated and should be banned, but first jagex need to make rules which apply to everyone, thats just impossible with this community
---
There’s a lot. But you probably can’t do any of them if you can’t think of one lol.

Theoatrix has a great video on this exact topic

Thanks a lot

Op doesn't have 99 slayer? How did they get into the subreddit?!?

I just dropped it and immediately got another from him

Yes, you can drop it and have him make another.

Yeah exactly, I think the dispersion of toxic players is even across the gamemodes, but because of how easy it is to crash iron accs you just see if more often.

Thanks man I'm going to power through till 802 KC and if I haven't got anything by then I'll throw in the towel on this boss

Mod Sween - what assurance can you give us that this is NOT the beginning of a slippery slope towards pay-to-win?

Honestly, I wouldn't even really mind straight up mtx for cosmetics.
---
Going through this rn
---
My main has 28 attack
---
I knew this would encourage that way of thinking, it's why we pressed for the inclusion of:
---
"*We don't want any of you worrying that free cosmetics are in any way a step toward introducing MTX (microtransactions) into Old School – the rest of this blog will outline our commitment to you, and will show you the questions you can expect to see in the poll.*
---
*To be completely clear about this - everyone at Jagex, including the CEO himself, is in agreement that* ***we will not add any MTX to Old School RuneScape****. We understand that doing so would completely contradict the spirit of what has made Old School a success.*"
---
It's natural to be wary. You don't want the Old School you love to change. Neither do we.
---
nah nvm dog i fixed it i was just using the flipping  the email on accisent lmao
---
The game takes time, if you didn’t notice. Not everyone is a hardcore leet gamer that plays 12 hrs a day and there’s a lot of newer players that would’ve had to no life since mobile release to have a late game account.
---
He wouldn't. Ironmen can't pick up their own death pile when they get PK'd, because the drops are in the name of another player.
---
Yes, many people have mentioned the same thing. I have plans for all of these.
---
I'm going to reduce the amount of Birdhouses to 2 and make it so that players must purchase access to one of them using a one-time large payment of Hunter Points.
---
I know the Level 5 boost from Super Hunter is big, but I don't think it is overpowered. Should the Herblore Level be higher? What level do you suggest?
---
I'll include actual numbers in the Hunter Reward Shop for you guys. It will take some balancing and tweaking.
---
I also like the idea of moving the knowledge of the new dishes to the Reward Shop. Maybe this should be the way for most of the new content, while also putting emphasis on Hunter Contracts.
---
Thanks for your feedback! Anything else, please let me know.
---
"Thanks" as an ultimate feels the best

But so far I've only had positive experiences during slayer task

Bonds are way more game disturbing than this.

What is "OSRS advice"?
---
Stupid Dutch wannabe gangsters with their slang..
---
It’s hilarious to think that the playerbase is fit to choose partners. More so that partners are willing to apply based on the premise that the players would choose them. I’m all against mtx and polling updates but business is business.
---
Your first ever comment on this sub and it’s praising jagex for MTX. Some sketchy comments on this post.
---
A partner/affiliate program is something we're very keen on adding. That will inevitably fall under the remit of an incoming Head of Influencer Management  ([https://careers-jagex.icims.com/jobs/1602/head-of-influencer-management/job](https://careers-jagex.icims.com/jobs/1602/head-of-influencer-management/job)).
---
Thanks for the suggestion!
---
I'm in for everything except the colorful body skins! Don't really feel like having people of every color of the rainbow at the GE would really match the osrs vibe.
---
I'm torn on bonds. They're not directly introducing currency or items into the game, and real-world-trading is going to happen either way. I don't see them as that negative of a feature.
---
OSRS are having a partnership with multiple undisclosed companies, as a reward for participating in these partnership (I.E. giving them money) you will be given access to one of these proposed rewards, exclusively, for an undisclosed period of time before they become available ingame through an undisclosed method. 
---
Can you sort out my confusion?
---
Thank you - this thread is really concerning. JAGEX IS INTRODUCING COSMETIC MTX TO OSRS.
---
I feel like I need to sound the alarm, but nobody is listening.
---
whats the problem of having one server then. if its about 1 thousand players. One server like that wouldn't need any updates, and those who prefer the pure nostalgia can actually get it?  
---
IM NOT ASKING TO RESET THE ENTIRE GAME, JUST ADD ONE SERVER. What is the crisis of that\`??
---
Okay, I feel like you’re entirely missing the point of the cosmetics being available to everyone at a later date. That means if someone doesn’t want to spend their money then they are totally free not to, and still receive whatever is in question. Also, they can’t offer much more bank space as it is. I believe Ash made a statement on this already, stating that the servers were almost maxed out on bank space. Correct me if I’m wrong. Also, Jagex knows that adding MTX such as the kind in RS3 would ruin this game. Not just in terms of playability, but their player base would almost instantly vanish into thin air. Not only adding MTX would make the player base vanish, but stating that they will not be adding MTX and then going back on their word, would make it disappear. It’s hard to come back from making a blatant lie to your consumer.

not really. addiction is just a side effect of how perfectly rs resembles real life

Skin colors are cool, but I'd love to see more items, even if purely cosmetic, to make us look like different NPCs. I'm not talking dramatic like making us look like Tz-Haar people, but clothing and weapons that look like human related NPCs. Maybe some more kinds of ornament kits for existing weapons to make them a new style?
---
Just train slayer and stop using wild pies, it will be far less annoying. The odds of getting a good drop are only 3/512 (aka not great), so getting sad every kill isn't a great strat.
---
Not sure what to tell you about mobile though, that does sound terrible!
---
I mean if you actually read the entire blog, that's about as good of assurance they'll give you. What's him stating here that they'll not do MTX gonna do any differently than their blog stating it in bold several times?
---
delet this before the mods see
---
I can only reiterate the assurances in the blog. I understand why you're reluctant to believe us.
---
Here are some bites from the blog:
---
* Everyone at Jagex, including the CEO himself, is in agreement that **we will not add any MTX to Old School RuneScape**. We understand that doing so would completely contradict the spirit of what has made Old School a success. 
---
* Any items offered through partnerships will not be exclusive, and will be **available for all members** at a later date.
---
* Any items that we offer will be made according to the art style of Old School and will truly fit the game's theme.
---
* Any items we offer will not impact your playing experience.
---
* You will be polled on what items are offered.
---
It’s time.
---
Hope it didn't take more time than those damn inferno attempts, nice work, very dank lmao
---
Lmfao mtx incoming bois.
---
Thank you! All over this thread, I see accounts parroting "this isn't MTX!" - YES, IT IS.
---
Jagex, you are pulling one over on us. Please pump the brakes - you are heading down the path towards RS3.
---
...did you read the blog post? They were pretty explicit. If that doesn't convince you, I'm not sure how a Reddit comment from a jmod is going to.
---
You dont see that white girl in front of him?? Jesus christ rs is full of virgins
---
Nah MOBA's are so 2 years ago. I want my OSRS autochess
---
No I didn’t. A friend and his ex ogre is not drama.
---
You virgin ass fuck boys.. If it was a q and a p next to eachother you faggots would all see it
---
ePiC gAmEs BaD! sTeAm GoOd!
---
Also like how they are majorally changing the elves design, it honestly looks like something out of RS3
---
So as a preface , I play alot of Path of Exile. My first question goes to jagex, In POE you can buy cosmetics and essentially bank space. Would the team be open to allowing players to do either of those? And my second goes to the community, would these type of mtx be considered acceptable since they dont affect the base game. Given a player wants different TP animations, or more backspace, do these type of changes harm the game?
---
Thanks man appreciate the help!
---
It can only be applied to your account once.
---
Assumed you could store in POH. If you can't then idk.
---
I upvoted it so it would hit the front page and get more eyes to see it, not because I agree
---
If it's an "entire new game" give it it's own devteam and stop wasting osrs devs on it. Oh wait, it's not.
---
I wouldn't. Which is why I quit, and it seems to my I made the right decision. The game is too modernized and streamlined compared to release osrs for me.
---
My favorite area in the game is Lletya. I go there just to hang, make some planks, cook, etc.
---
To make my POH Lletya themed is actually the first poll question to make my heart race!
---
I must be the only one who actually wanted the old version of the game, and not a new "updated" version of the old game. 
---
I honestly see no problem with having one server up, if they can do it with deadman mode then they could do it with this as well. The community is just too toxic to hear me out. So depressing.
---
should be doing barrows on arches spell book honestly
---
I think you missed the part where I said "if" you're 70 defense :)
---
Not to mention I'm more so talking about first time cape attempts, which usually means no slayer helmet either. Using the v helm/skirt &amp; karil top/blessed top with anguish/pegs/etc just makes it insanely easy. 
---
Suffering I suppose would be decent to use on a lower defense account, but I really don't  know why you'd use it over an archers (i). I mean the whole point is that you pray the whole time lol, only time you'd ever get use out of it would be the little bit of recoil damage on the rangers..which IMO, not worth compared to the added accuracy to have against the mage/melee's &amp; jad himself.
---
My favorite is they don't read it, cry, and call anyone who did read it and thought it was reasonable a shill/bot.
---
Apparently liking something Jagex said makes you a shill.  Only the really woke players spend hundreds of hours on a Jagex product **and** make sure to throw a fit anytime Jagex says anything
---
Just make sure we don't get more hotline bling or gangnam style-like emotes in-game, ty.
---
This seems like a bad idea. Although this isn't a direct microtransaction, some promotional events will most likely require a transaction with a third-party company. There's some definitive privacy concerns attached to that.
---
It seems odd to have certain unlocks vendor-locked in a game like RuneScape.
---
Well everything else you need is free, except the boots... I'm talking elite range void, Salve (ie), Ava's assembler.   
---
So, this would be like section 8 housing.
---
I have a few dozen or hundred of each gem (excluding onyx) in my bank. Is it worth it to cut them all into bolt tips and make enchanted dragon bolts out of them? I have a large surplus of dragon bolts due to Vorkath farming. Is there anything else I should be saving the dragonstones or diamonds for?
---
The wealth flex basically implies they are gonna "reward for kindness"
---
Don't ever touch the duel arena then.
---
Idk, but I've never been able to pick up items I lost when I died in the Wildy.
---
Not necessarily true. Every wintertodt crate has unique metadata, but having a full bank of crates isn't 800 "unique items".
---
Voting yes for all those proposed poll questions at the bottom tho
---
Love the idea but poor timing. I would rather all resources go towards bot busting, account security, (an actual wildy update, Gmaul nef?? dhide nerf?? bulwark nerf??) then random cosmetics.
---
A bit unrelated, but I hope the gods stay mysterious/mighty and don't become YA-novel characters like in RS3 quests
---
He said you can't keep any items on a UIM. But you might be right about protect item.
---
Can you relate to the BA pet gang though?
---
Petition to make Pepsi in-game
---
Yes. The blog also states why they want to do this. I don't understand the problem you have. Cosmetic upgrades that you get a few weeks before everyone else really isn't game changing, and certainly isn't how MTX started on RS. There we got the squeel of fortune, I think for 2 weeks all members got 2 spins for free, and you could find additional spins in-game, and after that you could buy spins. But from the get-go they had "lucky" items (untradeable variants of big ticket items with identical stats and a slightly darker colour), XP lamps, resources, and cosmetics. Here, all members get everything anyway, and it is exclusively cosmetic rewards that will all be polled first, just if you want to get it earlier, you can pay their partners. I don't see the problem here, as a company it makes sense that they find additional ways to advertise the game and gain revenue.
---
Maybe your work IT guy hacked you then deleted evidence of him using your email
---
I'd like to give my opinion and I feel that it will be an unpopular one, but I'd like to put it out there anyway. If I'm going to be completely honest, I am thoroughly shocked that OSRS has lasted as long as it has from a business perspective. The premise of MMOs in general is a fading concept. People these days simply aren't playing MMOs on the scale that they are playing games like Fortnight or Teamfight Tactics. Games that offer some sort of instant gratification are the games that are trending and have been for the last few years. Games which have required you to grind hard for a goal and delay your gratification don't do as well and have been on the decline relative to the other genres of games.
---
For this reason, it's not shocking that the OSRS team is trying different ways to generate revenue. They kind of screwed themselves for the good of the players when they promised that they would never add MTX to the game. For us players, it's freaking sweet, because it means we can enjoy one of the few remaining *vastly successful* MMOs on the market. For Jagex as a company though, it was a terrible business decision to voluntarily give up free money, and I'm sure if they could go back into the past and *not* promise to withhold MTX, they likely would. Not saying the mod team would do this, but the CEO and higher ups definitely would. 
---
So what they've done is shoehorned themselves into a position where they have to make the game profitable without applying cold hard p2w MTX, because the foundation of OSRS is rule 12 of RS2, *your standing in real life shouldn't affect your standing in the game*. And to an extent, this is still true. The introduction of bonds was **smart** because they made it so that they could collect revenue **from an already existing and tapped market**. Gold selling/buying has **always existed**, so Jagex adding bonds is not bad in my opinion, because this was a service that was already happening and in a dangerous way. The fact that they decided to cut out the middle man and add safe avenues for this service that **people would continue to do anyway** was a good decision imo. It is one of the only safe ways to do MTX in OSRS.
---
Beyond bonds, the last way to safely do MTX is cosmetics. I personally despise cosmetics. While they don't directly impact my direct game play, they can sometimes get out of hand and then you end up with things like the recent Easter event's holiday items: terribly gaudy looking items like a bunny mask that are immersion breaking. I would hazard to guess that many other players also share this sentiment. That's why I like the direction they're going with the PoH themes. I will be voting no to the teleport animations and skin colors, since those are things I will actually probably have to see on a regular basis, but I will vote yes to things like a PoH theme, because that's something that I won't see unless I'm going out of my way to specifically visit multiple houses. Things like a PoH theme is also a nice subtle way to give someone that "feel good" moment of seeing something that looks cool to them, without distracting the rest of the game. 
---
So yes, I do agree that this is literally MTX. But I am also not dumb in regards to how a business operates and am actually shocked that this is how they are willing to introduce MTX, because this is the tamest possible way to actually go about something like this without just going back on their promise and introducing p2w MTX. I am NOT going to speak for the majority, but I would assume that if MTX **must come to allow Jagex to remain afloat**, that this type of MTX (cosmetics like PoH themes) would be the type that the players approve of, especially if it means avoiding the P2W MTX that plague and destroyed RS3 for many players. 
---
Sorry this was so long, but I figured I would get my own thoughts out there in case there were others that felt the same.
---
Hey I never said it was a grind, I said I was bored lol. I'm impressed if you've managed more than 20 minutes in there ever without wanting to do runecrafting instead
---
The day Jagex starts selling any in-game content is the day I cancel my membership. 
---
They definitely harm the game. Check out the grand exchange on RS3 and tell me it feels anything like the RuneScape you enjoy.
---
You are a fraud. The person you replied to here is a brand new account with only this comment. You are talking to yourselves, and getting everyone around the office to upvote it.
---
It _should_ be on Elite (on par with killing Thermy, God Wars generals, DKs, Wildy bosses, etc.). I'm honestly not sure why it's on the Hard diary haha.
---
It's definitely possible to get one scuffed kill for the diary though so maybe you could check that out.
---
herblore
---
*ironman btw*
---
Oh right, it's a clue item... lul.
---
Ok well, what if they become peggies though? Then they're not storable anywhere, right? Is that the UIM meta then? Just never upgrading your rangers. D:
---
Im so happy im not the only one doing this. It's so much better!
---
Update: I respect this guy.
---
It's right, these fucking white nights forget there was a point in time where a employee was stealing accounts and gp XD
---
It's the way they're asking them in the polls too that seems snake-ish. Very, very poorly worded to the point the average player will not understand this is essentially a sponsored poll
---
Thanks but I already have a gf:/
---
It's a google account. I made an edit posting their activity information logs. I wish it were just a rogue IT guy lmao.
---
Nerfs for everyone!
---
🙄
---
Too many people on the planet, those who choose not to have kids definitely shouldn’t be criticised for choosing not to.
---
It’s more afk and you can still last like 5 hours
---
Jesus christ. The Jmods are trying to find a way to promote the game via partnerships and are making sure MTX is not brought in to the game, and the spoilt brats in this thread are not even being reasonable. Yes, ideally, these cosmetics would be brought in via an achievement in game, but this isn't your perfect ideal world that your mother creates for you  by letting you grind 15 hours a day while eating tendies. There has to be some level of compromise and quite frankly this is more than fair. Not only that, but these ideas sound fantastic for the most part too. The spoilt wet-behind-the-ear children in this thread need to seriously grow up.
---
I actually made the icon and my brother did the cape. We bought felt strips at a craft store for like 50 cents each and I just looked up an enlarged picture of the skull cape online and cut the shapes out of the felt and hot glued them together and then got glued them to the cape.
---
Would probably just protect this time :d.
---
I get 6 kills/trip without fail. Sounds like you're doing something wrong.
---
You’d have to be an idiot to fall for this.
---
Fucking wolves kept pjing me when I got him in a safe spot
---
A bit of a weird suggestion, but the game could be added to Steam. It would reach a whole new set of players which might have never heard of the game before or don't even know there's an Old School version of the game out and start playing the game, plus there could be some Steam Achievements you unlock for doing certain tasks in game, which might add even more of a "i achieved something" vibe to it. And another suggestion, you could partner with runelite and make it an official client, which would solve the Steam opening up the current official client if it was ever to be added. Other than that, i'm very happy that the game is not going in the same direction as RS3 went, MTX basically ruined the whole "i achieved something" vibe of the game for me.
---
The introduction of cosmetics is a minor issue for me. Sure, it dilute's the game's aesthetic and worldbuilding, but I can live with that.
---
Here's my problem: both Jagex and much of the community are making the following strange claim: "These partner cosmetics are not microtransactions".
---
That statement sounds so dissonant to me that I can't help but speak up.
---
Sure, it's only early access. Sure, it's only cosmetics. But if we can't face the truth that this is **$$** for early cosmetics, then we're going to have to learn a more painful lesson later when they really crank up the MTX.
---
Sometimes I do it in arma because it looks cooler 
---
Shoot me down for the inefficiency
---
Iban blast is much better burnt pages cost too much, I use fire surge with smoke staff and tome for barrows. But Iban blast will beat fire blast
---
I mean left guy looks better, Armadyl is so fucking ugly on male characters.
---
Well you have to pay for Twitch Prime, so it seems pretty obvious. But they did state this in the blog:  
---
* Any additions offered through partnerships will not be exclusive, and will be **available for all members** at a later date.  
---
So I don't think you have to worry about being left out if you either can't or don't want to pay.
---
Should still use rock cake or locator orb with this setup just to save few points
---
You’d have to be an idiot to give a stranger money over the internet and expect something in return.
---
pHySIcaLLy ilL
---
RS3 had lucky items, XP, coins, resources, and cosmetics right off the bat. There was no gentle easing in, in fact Solomon's store (which started off as purely cosmetics but eventually also became the source of bank slots, runemetrics etc) came after the wheel of fortune. It didn't at all follow the order you're suggesting
---
Tell Andrew to not sell his stakes in Jagex
---
Agreed, everyone has a right to choose what they want in life
---
I test the margins and try to stick to items i know are usually traded in large quantities. i.e. shark, some types of leather, etc..
---
to test, I buy one 10-15% higher than the suggested price. If it doesn't buy immediately, abort and go higher. The suggested price isn't always accurate. Then I sell that one item super low so it sells instantly. Then that low price is now my buy price and vice versa.
---
Here's an example with oak logs, buy limit is 15K
---
* buy 1 oak log, set price to 25gp
---
* immediately turn around and sell that oak log at 10gp
---
* now I look at my exchange history, it tells me
---
   * oak log purchased @ 19gp
---
   * oak log sold @ 18gp
---
* Now I buy 14,999 (remember i already bought one) oak logs @ 18gp
---
* after purchase is complete, sell those 14,999 logs @ 19gp
---
* profit = almost 15K
---
Generally its a bad idea to flip items that have 1gp margin, you can usually find higher margins with items that are traded in lower volume, but imo that is more risky. I don't like my orders sitting for more than 24 hrs.
---
I learned by trial and error, 2 years ago I [wrote this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/notncartography/comments/56j5y9/how_to_make_overworld_maps/) that converted GT's guide to the pdn format that you can use
---
Can you poll which partnerships you'd accept? Or are we taking good faith that there would be no partnership with gambling/scammers/etc?
---
How is it soloing with Justiciar? Inventory set up and kills/ per trip!? Ps nice B2B drops :D
---
If you guys are such great Twitch partners, then you need to have them step up on taking down fake phishing streams. With a steady flow of new players coming to the game, these phishing streams are more potent than ever, as new players are going to be less wary, especially when it appears the Jagex staff themselves are the ones streaming.
---
Do a normal rumble with weak bosses (Count Draynor, King Roald, Trapped Soul, Sand Snake, The Kendal) and you won't need to rock cake down to 1 at all, you can just face-tank them and afk for up to 20 minutes at a time. Would actually recommend using d'hide over void as you'll get hit a lot more with void and your absorbs won't last as long
---
I didn't expect this until tomorrow morning. You guys work fast.
---
i see a vorkath tab,clue tab, farming tab, and slayer tab?, and a tab with money stacks. i bet hes got the some gp big money
---
That dude at Zulrah with tbow but he’s using black dhide, glory and snakeskin boots
---
I have those things! I guess I’ll chill on the skills grind and focus on ds2 until after I’m able to get a vork kill.
---
I can’t believe they put one of the top 5 hardest bosses in the game as a hard req lol
---
What irks me is that they’re providing content they should already be providing (house themes) and putting it behind some weird ass paywall that really won’t even entice new players, but just add revenue. 
---
THEN they said the ONLY reason we’re getting these sick house themes is because the dev time is paid for by a third party? It makes sense logically but it’s basically saying our current payments aren’t good enough
---
What can I say, I hear Sea Shanty, I see free karma
---
&gt; and if you really don’t mind rs3
---
I do. I do mind.
---
&gt; Edit: You can do some cool stuff with it
---
Wait... what. How did they all attack one guy and not get skulled?
---
I'm split on this whilst I know these partnerships will help the game grow. It just feels like a slippery slope.
---
So vote no to all of them. They're literally having a poll to see how the players feel lol.
---
Is membership MTX under that logic?
---
In that case you need to be over on /r/RuneScape
---
skippable underground pass? say what now?
---
Jagex should make a buyable crab pet.  They can sell em for 11 dollars.
---
For slayer?
---
When? A year?
---
Vegan locked ironman incoming
---
"Ahh a nice cup of tea."
---
Yes kinda strange. Everyone who seems to disagree gets downvoted.
---
But my character did turn around without me clicking anything else.
---
Ah shes been in your youtube recommended aswell I see
---
Yellow skin for the Simpson's crossover!
---
What is so bad about exclusives on the Epic Games Store? Is it such a big deal having to use another launcher to play a game? It's not like it costs you any extra money to do so.
---
Nice bot lol
---
Who cares what he’s wearing? If you trade 2M for nothing, and you get nothing, you’re an idiot.
---
They don't respawn unless they get jad to full hp.
---
we live in a society!
---
There are enough cosmetics in game at the moment from clue scroll rewards to crack the clue and holiday events for people to be more than happy, I don't see house designs and skin colour changes to be any different really, the thing I care about most is just getting more content into the game, I didn't play for years and then I came back so much had been added it drew me back in harder than I thought it would
---
Link it then buddy
---
Idk I can't see in the future
---
I use normal mode instead of hard so the mobs rarely hit and if they do it isnt much.
---
I’ve been flipping for a while now and still don’t quite understand the mechanics. When I put a high bid on an item, who does the offer go to? Same question for when I sell really low. It always seems like there is a “reasonable price range” that the item gets placed into rather than going to the highest price/lowest offer respectively. If I try to buy a shark for 10k, it will always buy at a price near the GE price. Surely there is someone out there trying to sell a shark for 9k. Why doesn’t my 10k go to him?
---
Got mine over 4k kc. 4 claws. Meh
---
you recon that people dident play osrs during exams bet they were afking or something i dont think a single reson is the fault i think its a number of things never bought the whole summer thing
---
okay this is ebic
---
integrity change
---
You were hacked, hacker used your acc to buy bonds then do a charge back, now you owe 1120
---
Class yo mamma style
---
Some people dont buy membership with bonds believe it or not. It's actually more time efficient for some people to pay with real money. And while I dont actually mind bonds, anything MTX is a slippery slope (theres no real denying any of it is) so we need to stay vigilant
---
U sure it’s not a look alike scam?
---
They are 100% set on partnerships. They don’t want to know if the playerbase is ok with the content coming through partnerships, they just want to know if the playerbase wants to see it in game i assume.
---
Which they recognize, hence the transparency and polls on which cosmetics get added in this fashion, no? They're directly asking "would it be okay if we add a Morytania-themed house decoration?" That sounds reasonable, houses are an extremely low impact way to add these cosmetics. 
---
Certainly you'd vote no if they wanted to add promotional ornament kits. That has way more impact and is very different from a house decoration.
---
Maybe you think house decorations are fine because of the extremely low impact, but you don't like home teleport animations because that has more impact (more people can see it). That's perfectly reasonable, cast that vote.
---
I don't think it's reasonable to expect that a for-profit company wouldn't pursue additional revenue streams. Personally, I appreciate their approach.
---
Not switching again haha
---
Run the base client not runelite you'll get much better performance, I was around 20FPS on my Pi 3B+. Still always nice to see :D
---
Orange skin bad
---
What app/site is this?
---
It didn't pass, don't worry.
---
What's the blue amulet?
---
Now that its confirmed to be not that rare, its probably gonna drop under the 1b mark
---
It's a bit fishy the actual questions don't mention this...
---
Experiments pet from Morytania elites please 😤
---
Buying bonds with gp keeps bond sell prices up in GE so more people will buy bonds with real money.
---
i havent been playing much lately. when was this?
---
Yeah you probably wont get that resolved... that's kinda your own fault
---
Ye i get that, im majorly impatient haha
---
Link and his "odd" brother Lunk
---
I did the inferno with only lazy flicking
---
What's the name of the lvl mod?
---
I like the skin color alternatives and the POH styles are also really cool. A prif style POH would be sick.
---
Gz
---
Salve amulet (ei)
---
You mentioned the partner of twitch being a success. 
---
I see twitch prime membership being one of the biggest reasons bots are swarming the game. 
---
Free membership for new accounts is a big problem. 
---
Botting really needs to be your main priority.
---
Rotten lettuce hair and pink cape in full display.
---
Seriously though, if you see this light come on, it's almost always too late.
---
Jagex has stated that something purely cosmetic like a house rework is hard to justify.
---
As a player, I'm fine the dev time for something purely cosmetic is being funded by a partnership that hasn't proven toxic (provided that the cosmetic is in the spirit of osrs).
---
Is the game going to be shut down without these partnerships? You're probably right that it won't. But as long as we're able to poll the cosmetics and they're available to everyone, I don't actually see the problem with a short time frame of exclusivity.
---
If the nature of these partnerships changes, such as unpolled/immersion breaking cosmetics or long term exclusivity, then feel free to jump ship. But as long as we can trust Jagex (which is permissible with their transparency in this update blog and the polling system), then things are fine imo.
---
It didn’t pass polls. Don’t worry about it
---
That's about what I get, I wonder if it hasn't been updated since the nerf in Nov 2018.
---
\&gt;Jagex says "noone in the company wants mtx"
---
\&gt;offers timed exclusives, presumably \~1 month, but only if the community wants them
---
\&gt;the same as rewriting history and rampant censorship
---
\&gt;wake up sheeple
---
you cant just name shit to sound smart, you troglodyte
---
Are we really not counting massive increase in bots by the tens of thousands over the last 2 months as drama? And Its going to last until about mid August how can you be so dim?
---
This is like EA saying "they're not lootboxes, they're surprise mechanics"...stop adding this useless cosmetic crap that doesn't help the game move forward.
---
Couldn’t agree more with this, I recently revisited RS3 as a player who spent nearly 10 years on that game and didn’t recognise anything which made it all so over whelming, confusing and just uncomfortable. There’s comfort in knowing and consistency through visuals representation of items and animations whatever cosmetics are added should still be easily recognised for what they are.
---
As if I'm gonna spend my time finding it. It's been posted before and I know that.
---
I'm not saying everything here would go into some update, but hopefully the most popular 1 or 2. Just wanted to throw out a list I brainstormed that might gain some traction and start a discussion
---

TRUUUEEEE
---
Not cost effective for slayer, more like for ranging armadyl if you're not solo chinning, vorkath if you're using dhcb, basically any boss you don't want to use blowpipe on
---
Jesus, you're right. All of my critical comments have been instantly swamped with downvotes as well. What is even going on here?
---
I suggest setting up the f keys to swap between inventory/prayer. This will save you loads of time and help you focus more on watching jad
---
Lol, you got lured XD
---
Fucking D A N K !!!
---
oh so the account is fucked?
---
That is not superior fashionscape, just deuchescape! Loaf of bread with a frog mask is superior fashionscape bro come on now!
---
Read what?
---
Sure, but it's still MTX at the end of the day.
---
No, theyre a company with pressure from investors/owners to make as much as money as possible. Right now, the only way to do that without increasing membership or making mtx is to get more players in the game paying for membership or bonds.
---
as far as "mtx" goes it's mostly agreed on that it's fine and has its place. it's up front with what it costs, everyone's entitled to it, and it's tied into other players actually having the GP to buy them in the first place, so it still encourages legitimate methods of earning in game money.
---
Say what again I dare you I double dare u m***...
---
So what is a clan and what does it do?
---
Is this gonna get fixed in a patch? Seems ridiculous
---
I always thought it would be interesting if they made a few bot-only worlds and let people go nuts. It's only unfair to bot if everyone else isn't doing it and I know a fair few people enjoy the process of writing scripts for bots.

People that play Runeacape work and go to school?

If you have this little faith why are you even still playing.

PKER DETECTED
---
Normally you can time the TB, tank, and tele out the second the clock hits 0.  Now, in multi you can basically be re-TB’d at random so it’ll be impossible to time it. This can pretty much go on into infinity.
---
Also it can be abused in a different way. Someone can bring an alt, TB themselves with the alt to make sure clans can’t tb them, and then suicide the alt when it’s time to tele out
---
They're a business, not 'sellouts'. No shit they are trying to make extra money, that's how they survive and improve
---
Also they clearly state they won't ruin the old school look and everything will be polled, so just vote no...
---
Feels like it.
---
This seems like a slippery slope to get on
---
Yup. I consider myself fairly smart when it comes to online scammers, but those twitch phising links are insane. Was watching a top OSRS stream of what I assumed to be a "pro player," who's stream title was that he was quitting. I open chat as he says follow the link to the OSRS forum to see why I'm quitting. Website looked exactly like Runescape so I didn't check the domain, tried to sign in.
---
The lengths these guys go to just to steal 10m from casual players is fucking mindblowing.
---
How exactly do these promotions bring in bots?
---
&gt;Dorgeshuun House Style
---
Yes yes all of this.
---
Nah bro, you get it when you buy one of Legos new osrs mini figs
---
Could you share a screenshot? This sounds nice.
---
I agree. Overall wildy slayer got nerfed with this update. Emblems used to be creeping up on 200k. With T10s trading they're currently ~70k. So even if I'm getting keys at the same rate as emblems (and they seem to be just slightly rarer), I'm making less than I used to with wildy slayer.
---
Isn't this in some way the same as MTX? 
---
People will probably have to pay for the things the partner offers, for example Twitch Prime. Only difference now is that they indirectly purchase cosmetics instead of directly through Jagex..
---
So what about all the people in the beta doing this right now? I have yet to see any serious complaining of the grind even with the current level cap up at 40 and tons of people are at cap doing pvp or whatever.
---
A tip for doing this extremely quickly. 
---
Go into photoshop (if you don't have it but intend on editing photos, download it)
---
Import the meme template. 
---
Press w (This will select your magic wand)
---
Click on the individual rubik's squares. 
---
1 at a time, press backspace deleting each square.
---
Now create a new layer. 
---
Drag the layer under your meme.
---
On this layer you're going to be creating the pattern. 
---
Copy image on google and past into this layer. (Not 100% sure if it copies into this layer or creates a new one, I actually forget but it's redundant, you can delete the layer if it creates a new one.)
---
now press control+T to resize the image. Holding shift+alt allows you to keep the aspect ratio the same.
---
you can create multiple if you don't like 1 flat image behind the meme.
---
This is 1 of a million ways to do this, I just think this is simple for people who don't use the program
---
Twitch phishing streams are a joke and the free membership thing through twitch has caused a major botting issue within the game. No
---
These are from that massive warding file?
---
EZScape NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/oldschoolrs/status/1019633900744839169?lang=en 
---
I mean if this twitter post is anything to go by, we wont be seeing anything like rs3 cosmetics anytime soon even if it fits with the theme of osrs. The only type of cosmetics we will get will be either new treasure hunter rewards or holiday event rewards.
---
Twitch Prime is linked to Amazon Prime, which has a free trial period. Therefore, any free membership offers tied to Twitch Prime is functionally free.
---
That is a problem on Twitch's end though, and from what I can remember, Jagex and twitch have been in talks regarding the issue.
---
The nigga wants dung and summ and you encourage him to play and then tell him to not play lmao
---
I got them on my first med clue :D
---
I'm still a bit apprehensive about the circumstances with the partnerships, but all of those rewards sound great.
---
Elf house please
---
Bonds are already MTX that allow you to buy as much in game gold as you like. You’re ignoring all context just to REEE over a Lanark.
---
So it actually is technically against the rules to share an account. That said, I don’t think Jagex really cracks down on that rule at all, it’s more in place so that people can’t turn to Jagex and say “please unban, friend botted on my account” which brings me back to being unsure as to why you’d be banned if you weren’t botting
---
I don't tank metal dragons. If I were to melee them in low end gear I would either use proselyte and pray or flick with max strength (including torso and obby legs).
---
Mining is a very easy and semi-afk 99 nowadays if you do the motherlode mine.
---
Because you can already do that via RWT, they just made it so that you can support jagex in the process. We're not ignoring it, but **if bonds didn't exist it wouldn't change jack shit, as people would just RWT for that advantage anyways.**
---
There is nothing hypocritical about buying bonds while thinking they are bad for the game. As long as they are part of the game, it would be foolish not to take advantage of them. Think about the GE; some people have their reasons for not liking it, but they use it anyway otherwise they are basically crippled themselves compared to other players. Me refusing to buy bonds is not suddenly going to make Jagex decide not to have bonds in the game.
---
10m from 200 players everyday or 200m from just a couple players adds up quick and for them it's all automatic
---
That would be me! Glad you liked it :) I wasn’t expecting so many people to recognize it.
---
I was in the same boat. I learned solo raids and now I have 0 ambition to ever find a team to raid. Work on learning solo, also join the We Do Raids discord, i think they run beginner/learner raids quite often which can help you get started.
---
How many pts/hr do you get
---
The point of the promos is to make people aware that OSRS exists and check it out having no idea what it was before, not to entice them with the random color/house theme. That's for the existing players to gain something from it...
---
No fedora...sorry not a good rng
---
RIP cock
---
We dem boys!
---
Runecrafting is out dated and needs to be reworked
---
@ ME
---
I genuinely never watch twitch because of this I go on the homepage and don't click on anything because I don't want to be hacked. Shame really as I would use it a lot but just watch YouTube instead.
---
TBH I feel if you did underground pass you shouldn't need to deal with it again for regicide, especially because the RNG on agility shortcuts sucks
---
you may share accounts for like pking but its against the rules to share it and train the account with 2 people.
---
its also against the rules to have other players do stuff like quests and get firecape/infernal cape for you
---
Don't have us vote for these before at least telling us who the partners are.
---
Are you acoustic?
---
Where could I watch this documentary?
---
Thanks man!
---
Came for the shitstorm in the comments, was not disappointed
---
Okay bye, nobody will miss yet another 'slippery slope' tin foil hat loony
---
Totally, it's just crazy how trying to learn about osrs as a new player will most likely turn into getting hacked. Community is destroying itself and Jagex does nothing. Never seen anything like this in any other game.
---
You can pick up anyone's bones after they die.
---
Wtf no rock cake????
---
I haven't really been into the Easter stuff the past two years personally, but I always thought they fit the oldschool reward theme quite well. Easter rewards have always been goofy nonsense, remember the rubber chickens?
---
Is this guy being paid by jagex to pretend there was no drama?
---
Thanks! Many people have expressed concern. I'll be revising that for the second version of this.
---
Join a clan, find people that also want to learn raids
---
Hahaha, that was actually polled?
---
I’ll try to do that with the quests. Did you use the optimal quests wiki to help?
---
Yeah I'd love dungeoneering, Though no way those OP weapons could come into the game without destorying the current BIS, They'd have to find a balance that works for the current eco-system
---
most skills are very easy and at least semi afk
---
the difference is most skills aren’t only 20-40K/hr
---
I dont get how you made 30m . Why would the scammer put 30m in and then accept twice ?
---
Yes
---
This is a business with shareholders. Majority of players can agree if this provides more money to jagex then why not.
---
We will all get their teams at a later date.
---
Not sure how your ignorance is anyone elses problem tbh
---
Surprisingly, nothing really. Crab posts are just business as usual at this point
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/6dmwjl/clan_chats_for_learning_raids/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Could follow the advice from here. Just joining large group raids and learn it but I wouldnt expect to earn alot of gp from it. Learning experience maybe. Or just find a friendly community clan that helps teach raids.
---
77 RCing is when you become a man. A man that has looked into the void and knows the truth of the world: after the grind comes the rest....and the casual afking from 77-99.
---
The History of RuneScape, it's on Youtube, RuneScape official channel.
---
Or broad bolts! they're cheaper than addy
---
I suppose that's a fundamental difference between us, then- and that's okay. I personally don't view anything listed in the dev post as a mtx, much less something to be worried about. But maybe that's just me. 
---
It depends on how you look at it. I personally view it as "pay for/try out a service, and get an in-game reward" rather than "pay for an in-game reward, and get a service as well". I don't think many players are going to buy a subscription to Audible just because you get a cosmetic quill &amp; book a few months earlier than everyone else. I would have a significant problem with all of this if the rewards weren't freely obtainable in game after the promotion ended.
---
I think there's a big difference between "sign up for a free trial of youtube red and get an in-game red skin, otherwise wait 2 months and you get the skin anyways" and "buy the 20,000 RuneBux© package (best value!) And purchase the exclusive Ice Wings accessory!". 
---
You can also earn 1000 RuneBux every month that you're a member. Little timmy has been saving his up, and he has 18,000. He's sick of waiting, so he buys the $3.99 RuneBux package so he can flex in style.
---
Both are cosmetic, neither are p2w, both can be earned without paying a cent, but one is significantly more predatory. It's possible they'll bungle something in regards to the partnerships, but I imagine the team is walking on eggshells because the osrs community is  typically vocal about things we don't approve of. That being said, there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.
---
1.) If you're a member of Amazon Prime you get a home tele animation where you pack yourself into a box with the smile logo on it and get whisked away. (Very wrong)
---
2.) Sign up for a 7 day YT Red trial and watch at least one video on the official osrs channel to get a red skin (in the middle)
---
3.) Watch a 2 minute video and answer a survey about protecting polluted swampland to receive a Morytania theme for your house (best case scenario)
---
Only time will tell, I suppose. I've been wrong before and I'll be wrong again, but I sincerely don't think Jagex will go overboard with this. I do appreciate that we're able to have a collected, non-hostile discussion about this, because you have raised some valid points.
---
interesting. have they ever shown this anywhere or is it just from seeing streamers etc. being banned.
---
Muffins WHERE
---
Anyone with knowledge of the email I used could've hacked me tbh. You can just put the account email and date created (last month) and that's basically enough info to recover... Maybe guess my internet provider too lol
---
May had some drama, but I don't remember what
---
It’s not gonna stop this sub from crying MTX everytime something changes.
---
Selling out - A person/business who compromises their personal values, integrity, talent, or the like, for money or personal advancement.
---
Jagex is valued over half of a billion dollars. That's not an amounted to scoff at. That being said a lot of their revenue comes from from rs3 mtx. And having milked rs3 almost dry, they now need more money from osrs. Keeping a stance of no mtx, they now need money from 3rd party companies. They want to use osrs as a billboard for these companies to throw their branding onto.
---
It's not a partnership as partnerships are joint ownership of a company.
---
hard facts
---
Get eggs. Add shit to eggs. Launch said egg at queen.
---
Man I loved this place starting out on my btw. Got loads of Nature runes, a mith axe and a rune axe safe spotting there for a few hours
---
Interlectual or intellectual?
---
To be fair they have said they would be looking at this sort of content, and as for the Hydra Tail I think its very sad for a piece of content to be dead on release.  Which it was, they proposed changes to it then never polled them or did anything.
---
Same happened to me when I started back two years or so ago.  Luckily, I caught on a few hours later and changed all my info before anyone got into my account.  Really though, they are VERY easy to fall for if you are new to Runescape/Twitch - I think for me I assumed all streams on twitch were safe, since it is such a huge company.
---
I tried looking for similar experiences on this reddit and all I find is people being shouted down for bottoms and commenting “waiting for the jmod smack down” lmfao not feeling too hopeful
---
So it’s cool lol
---
I wanted all my skills to be 50 and over, and this is my last one, and i literally stopped playing LOL
---
Yaaaaay.
---
We did it, reddit!
---
No, OSRS is the main game.  RS3 came from OSRS.  They fucked it up so badly that MORE people play OSRS than RS3.
---
Could you create some sort of a shortcut to TzHaar-Hur for players high in agility and thieving? To clarify, this would be just for the NPC's and not the shop or other parts of the zone.
---
Makes no sense that one of the best ways to acquire gems is blocked from skillers.
---
Saw a post recently about making a Castle Wars tournament. I think it's hard to police things like afking, but sabotaging should be a bit easier. I think creating a list of things you see as sabotages (maybe even screenshots) and reposting to gain community support would be the best bet. It's hard for them to fix things if they don't know exactly what's going on.
---
Even pkers complain about how OP the gmaul is, this would be a good change
---
That’s..... what RS3 looks like?
---
Jesus.
---
try it, all my relationships the past 5 years came from there. some long lasting ones
---
Well, I wasn't banned I just can't log in. I mean who knows i may have a ban but i doubt it. I just can't get past login. I use the correct pw and it just says it's locked. Nobody has been on the account since that day. It says it's for security reasons which is why i believe it was just because i was logging in from different countries.
---
Why you give discord instead of rsn? Seems a bit fishy lol
---
This changes everything (hopefully oil first)
---
Isn't there a mini-game you can watch currently? I'd think they could replicate that bit of the game and rework it for an instance, joined like the house portal (enter their name).
---
Just as a heads up for future security, never follow a link. It doesn't matter who it is from. You can access the intended information by visiting the site manually and won't fall for phishing scams that way.
---
Everyone's an asshole, why does it matter?
---
The poll blog states that this is displayed above the question. I think it is enough to figure out its a twitch prime sorta deal for some time before becoming avaliable to everyone.
---
&gt;"Earlier this week we spoke about growing Old School RuneScape through working with key partners in the gaming world. In this poll you'll be able to vote on a number of cosmetic changes. In the dedicated blog we specified that all items will first be made available alongside a partnership, but will then be made available to all players once the partnership ends. Click here to read the blog."
---
Or just play osrs and don’t use anything new
---
It happens to the best of us. LOL.
---
Can you reduce the duration of the death animation of the Nylocas. At the moment it blocks you from clicking anywhere behind it cause it last for a long time and goes all the way to the roof
---
I have no idea how she does that but that's incredible.
---
This has my undying support. Ecu keys would make Larran's chest worth it.
---
Can someone explain the green pixel thing. As far as I know there has never been a green pixel in the con symbol. I went back to screenshots I have from when oldschool was first released and it is not there either. Was it added at some point later?
---
Hey man look up we do raids discord follow the settings and do a learner raid with other 0kc players!
---
Just get kc lol
---
Nah I’d always keep it on long range
---
I say "halfway" through the quest but that's really only according to the quest guides, you only have the Kruk fight after that, the airship portion (tbf, a large part of it), and the Glough fight. Honestly might as well finish.
---
I remember this day, I was walking through Port Sarim and Rimmington in absolute awe of everything
---
I think this is how the scam works if I understand it correctly.
---
Some guy says he'll trade 100m for dhcb (&gt;100m) + more stuff. You show him 100m, he shows 130m in items in this case. 
---
You're suspicious so you read the 2nd trade screen very carefully, he insta accepts to appear legit, but declines before you can accept, rushing you. 
---
Then he trades with you again, but removes the dhcb really quick before the 2nd screen. He hopes you get greedy and do what he did the first trade.
---
OP made 30 cause he insta accepted the first trade as well. Risky play, but it appears to have paid off.
---
🦀🦀#CrabGang will rise 🦀🦀
---
Fuck bob I’m all about Nieve
---
Yes, ToB and Zulrah already have this feature.
---
Can you make the buttons on mobile or do something to try and combat misckicks. Currently simple things are very difficult like the reporting tab it's hard to pick the correct option. Also things with small teleport buttons such as using an ornate jewellery box it's very easy to teleport to the wrong place by accident.
---
Username checks out.
---
Djtickletits
---
^well adding redwood funiture would be nice
---
they've convinced themselves that what they're doing is far enough from direct mtx that they thought the players could be just as easily manipulated 
---
MatK more than likely gave them an ultimatum and said if they were going through with it he would leave, he has probably seen the full scale plan for it aswell, and is probably aware of the amount of money jagex paid for a mobile games mtx expert to draft a plan
---
this is too familiar with the borderlands 3 "no mtx" bs where their ceo said paid cosmetics arn't mtx
---
I don't doubt they've spent a lot of time in meetings trying to come up with monetization efforts, it's just sad they arn't transparent enough to ask the players for ideas, different tier membership subscriptions with NO EXTRA BENEFITS is a start, maybe try monetizing the forums like /r/fortniteBR is doing
---
but please jagex don't tie sponsorships and partnerships to in game items
---
they need to push merchandise &amp; runefest harder if they are struggling to see expected growth
---
Stop with the fucking diaries
---
That's an item?
---
That’s misleading. It will come to all players at some point. That wording would make people believe you have to pay no matter what. Y’all are overthinking the questions.
---
You aren't addressing Jagex here, none of us can do anything about you having a problem about an item that's worked the same for years.
---
Make the buttons bigger*
---
I finished the eastern edge of the swamp and continued some of the river. Getting closer to where I was when I did this on Nintendo Switch.
---
I love this rendering with the shadows and the almost realistic lighting but it’s not OSRS anymore, hell I don’t even think this is RS3 anymore.
---
Can you zoom out a little more please, I can't quite see Lumbridge.
---
YO THOSE HOME TELE ANIMATIONS WILL BE SICK
---
Wow, I never thought about it but this is the real treasure of the post
---
Normally just use the world switcher to hop but now you can also coat your shift and arrow key in cheeto dust which also sends you to the very next world. Very nicw
---
It definitely scales, doing birdhouse runs on my alt vs on my main is extremely noticeable.
---
Can't definitively answer if the wiki rates are wrong. Might be worth investigating (ask on the wiki Discord for the sources on the birdhouse nest rates).
---
Does it?
---
This exact thing happened to me. Well, I was googling how to do some quests and find some more resources before I stumbled upon the wiki. But I got “hacked” within 3 days, lost my account to “macroing major” and that’s it. If it weren’t for me having a lot of spare time it would have driven me away from the game.
---
But wouldn't that just be a recolor of the Fancy Stone decoration?
---
If you've got a friend on discord who's good at zulrah, just have them go to the telescope, watch your kill and tell you over discord what to switch to and where to stand etc. That's how I got my first kill real easy on the 3rd try
---
They're looking at it, don't expect anything soon
---
True, but then you can just buy it. If you want all BiS items as a btw, you're probably gonna go dry for a long time on at least 1 thing.
---
Credit cards cant buy an fcape
---
Not quite, there's not enough Pandaren and Worgens erotically roleplaying in the tavern basement.
---
I don’t understand everyone’s hate for RC.
---
I wouldn't think this would be hard to implement then!
---
and where was this insinuated? literally no one said anything about race until you decided to mention it yourself, you do realize you’re generalizing black people though by saying i assumed you were black by the way you talked, therefore you’re being racist.
---
Fremmy elite gonna come in rough
---
It’s nice if he turns off your prayer and puts the potion timer down to like 10 seconds so you can re-pot quicker. Other than that yeah it sucks sometimes.
---
I kind of feel warm towards this, but I can never quite shake the distrust I feel when nearly a decade ago Jagex refused to remove the squeal of fortune despite overwhelming  community backlash because “people used it” therefore it was clearly popular.
---
Im also generally against cosmetics in this way since I feel like cosmetics can be a really good way of displaying player achievement, missing out on this opportunity is rather a shame in my eyes.
---
In all, not really mad about it, not too stoked either
---
You're probably not getting replies because this is extremely confusing on 2 points:
---
&gt; - Already had a name forced to make a new one
---
Since when does changing emails cause you to change your display name? I'm not aware of that being the case...
---
&gt; - Go through with tutorial island again on wrong email
---
Why would you go through tutorial island **again**? I'd understand if the name/email change thing was due to some shenaniganry with account info being linked, but *getting rolled back to tutorial island entirely*? Wtf. That doesn't happen. Did you make a *third* account that you're now talking about, or what?
---
Now do some Kush Ups.
---
Bond does not turn off loyal longstanding customers because loyal longstanding customers just don't call them MTX (although maybe reluctantly so). Neither will new forms of MTX turn them off. 
---
The loyal longstanding customers will just lower their standard and tell themselves these new forms of MTX are just not MTX.
---
Just wait until you get kraken every other task. You’ll 100% put em in block
---
I was wondering because of the different level and model of them
---
After doing all the quests that give runecrafting exp you're pretty much maxed.
---
Buy
---
Potato
---
Slayer xp for skillers
---
They should give him a statue in Canifis once he’s done
---
New DMM world would be so nice. It would reset once in a year or something.
---
Thats the fucking point of advertising dude. Twitch got something out of it and Jagex offered an incentive. That's the entire point of this blog and also a fact in the real world.
---
Technically it is. My brother got an old account of mine banned and when I asked if I could get an appeal mod ash said it’s agains the rules to have more than one player on an account. Again, if you read the rest of that thread, it’s not something they really enforce but is more there to cover them in the event of things like that happening.
---
Not gonna lie, I prefer the way osrs turned out and would probably like it more than what the og rs would turn into.
---
yup i hate the purple skin already :/ wish i could toggle it off
---
Keep upvoting
---
Orange men bad. Vote no
---
I think as long as the multi-combat zones do not contain any resource advantages, there is no reason to remove them. I personally like to pk with 2 buddies of mine and I think it would be sad if all multi-combat was removed. However, because clans take multi-pking to a completely different level, you have to remove the resource advantage areas like god wars dungeon and quest areas.
---
i wish i had friends to do BA with cba to pay for teams
---
Having played the beta for classic wow, it's not a tenth as hard as people remember.
---
It's just grindy.
---
Also curious
---
No, I got a later batch. On Friday I noticed the 4GB models were back in stock on The Pi Hut, so I placed an order, and the very next day it arrived. Results seem to vary depending on seller and country.
---
Virgin.
---
Wacky skin colors, lots of the recent holiday outfits, etc.
---
If I imbue my black mask at NMZ and then make it into a slayer helmet will it stay imbued?
---
Exactly. I hate playing Korean MMOs not just because of the cash grabbiness but the cosmetics get overwhelming.
---
You’ll get one eventually. Usually what helps my RNG is complaining out loud. OSRS likes to make a fool out of me directly after. Gl fella
---
Sounds like you've thought a lot about this
---
I just get terribly bored, but mostly because I force myself to pay attention a decent amount with 1t flicking after I lost 5m to dying in the instance many months ago. Plus side is like 50-60 Kill trips
---
my RC is still level one and I’ve been playing for months
---
yup. thats the reason certain fashion scape items are really valuable. id pay millions to get a cooler teleport animation or house. heck id even kill 1000 bosses for it.
---
thanks for ruining the game
---
did he pull that 360 in a circle for no reason or did jad spawn in a different place than the orange 360
---
It's not even against the rules. I'm honestly too lazy to find it now, but when they started banning people for buying inferno capes, they stated that sharing your account is not against the rules and they'll only ban you if someone does something on your account that's against the game integrity. They said infernal capes &amp; quests are such things, fire capes are not.
---
(That being said, I've been questing for people since 2015 and neither my account, nor anyone I've quested for has ever gotten banned for it lol)
---
Why did u quit ?
---
\^yup
---
Kraken is super fast to kill.
---
Can we get a prayer filter? (mobile qol)
---
Some people like to make themselves feel better by hurting others.
---
These are what we like to call bad people.
---
This makes me remember those horrible ads on tinder that runescape used to run
---
This doesn't feel like it's in the spirit of OSRS. Any new content that's exclusive to paying money to some outside source feels exactly like a microtransaction. Even if it's only cosmetic, that's how RS3 started down the path it's going down now.
---
I like new content. However, it should be earned in-game. I'm normally pretty optimistic about trusting devs to do the right thing, but this is a bad sign to me.
---
I do not do it but I'm assuming yes. The entire process can be automated. From making the fake stream, to testing the account information and trading over the money. The only thing not automated is selling the gold to buyers but who would complain about doing that?
---
Because of the HD update.
---
I play now though, because the graphics aren’t the cartoony HD version and I also have the option to use the ‘05 interface with RuneLite.
---
Could we perhaps have an elven hairdresser in Priff that has a couple elven styles?
---
Herblore costs literally 0 if you just buy grimy herbs in bulk and clean them.  Yeah it'll take a metric fuckton of time but it's actually pretty lucrative if you stick with it.
---
Not entirely the same for me, but once HD came out it was so hard to play RuneScape on my family’s “potato”. I still loved the game and played when I could, but I had to give it up :/
---
This update seem to split to community quite a lot. Either you LOVED the new graphics, or HATED them haha. Personally, I loved them!
---
Sounds like the start of a slippery slope.
---
You couldn't turn it all the way off though. Seems like I am in the minority but IMO this update is when RS changed for the worst.
---
Pkers would like to know your location...
---
those are worth actual GP, though. Adding valuable uniques is a direct buff to treasure trails, not just cosmetic
---
i understand when a ghost or lizard is purple. however, i do not understand when a medieval character has to be purple. its not like we are playing any other race or some other bs. 
---
having an option to toggle them off seems justified.
---
For Jagex standards it went smooth but there was a pause in combat at the start of the multi-battle that could have had major implications. 
---
30 or so people died to the fog at once triggering the pause failsafe mechanic.
---
Ok no big deal? Well at least in Falador RoT was taking heavy damage as they just got charged by 200+ people throwing barrages and chins. With the pause they were able to eat food back to full health and prayer as well as change their strategy.
---
It's not a huge deal but if definitely changed that fight.
---
Use turael in burthorpe
---
This was the first time you could also full screen RuneScape no? I can't remember not being able to turn it off but for me it was cool to have HD textures with osrs (not RS3)
---
The purple skin was offered as a promotion. You have the purple skin whether or not you engaged with the promotion in any way. This will apply to all future promotions. What don't you understand?
---
The last fight being thrown doesn’t count as drama?
---
I literally find EOC too confusing. I don’t know why. I’ve played WoW for years, countless other mmo’s, tons of different games. But for some reason I just can’t follow the skills or figure out how to smoothly set it up when I change weapons or whatever. Honestly OSRS is the only Runescape I enjoy
---
Its a slippery slope. RS3 started with cosmetics too.
---
?? The Twitter drama where a player mod got demoted for making a statement regarding jagex poor security and dupport. Happened in June.
---
I /s the /s that you /s'ed my /s that was in retaliation to your /s
---
*tinfoil hat intensifies*
---
The idea is that if you aren't using prayer armor you should always go for max dps. Look at fury vs torture. Torture gives 5 more melee attack and 2 more str. In exchange you lose 10 mage and ranged attack, 15 in all defenses, and 3 prayer. Fury objectively gives "more" stats, but torture is miles better because it gives slightly more dps.
---
You know that is a logical fallacy right?
---
Not gonna say told you so that we shouldn't fuck with the polls, but I fucking told ya do.
---
We're back at 2012 scape where jagex is out of touch with the player base and only adds more shit that breaks the game.
---
No sorry, it is boring for everyone, except a small (very small) percentage of people like lynx titan, do not try tell me that you would actually sit and train woodcutting from 70-99 doing nothing but watch your inv fill then banking and repeat.
---
Its boring, deal with it
---
lol isn't 100 combat still considered mid-level?
---
(note I am only 98 combat)
---
There’s always assholes. The other ironmen who are not, would have hopped and that would not get traction for internet points cause it’s normal behavior. A helmet in front of your name doesn’t make you a piece of shit. It sucks to see so many people think ironmen are shitty people just because a post like this comes up once a week...
---
This pixel art is cancer ^(\*badum-tss\*)
---
okay, ill try to cut things down. I gotta stop talking to much.
---
Lance is okay but the bludgeon is too complex. Runescape has a simple but distinct art style with things like the scimitar or full helm designs being distinctive and iconic without all the extra pizazz
---
Took me 45 ish attempts. Kept dying to triple jads more than zuk and waves If I could take it back and not even bother I would.
---
Cool stuff! Nicely done, OP
---
Insane grats
---
the whole point of the crazy rev drops is that you can get attacked by other players... that's how they balance the game. you could be pking people and making a ton of money too but you probably suck at the game and no one wants you in their clan because you're a whiny bitch.
---
Not true lol. Any iron that hopped in this circumstance wouldn’t have been posted to reddit. This happens weekly and people hop on the fuck ironmen train because a few irrational asshats out there blew up. A helmet in front of the name doesn’t make them bad people. Assholes are just assholes
---
i see a cow kicking someone away. when i first saw it i had no clue what it was and where it came from. only thanks to you ive learned it is a birthday event reward. 
---
i dont think animations like that are nostalgic to returning players. at least not for me.
---
im also in favour of certain skins, but they should be similiar to old school content... id understand your circle being in a different colour or you having a different book in your hand
---
Hmm. Maybe I'll have to check it out. I know wayy too much about this game; might as well be useful.
---
Does Jagex themselves not consider OS bonds to be MTX?
---
I’m shaking right now. This is literally worse than global warming.
---
Different colour skins kind of ruin the immersion of the game, I'd much rather see different models or races instead. I think it would be awesome to play as a goblin or something.
---
Also mabye you could attach some cosmetics to loyalty memberships like 6-12 months.
---
Best era
---
So you wouldn't believe anything Sween would even have to say to your post anyway. You're asking for assurance in bad faith
---
IRONY OVERLOAD. CATASTOPHIC SYSTEM FAILURE.
---
On my grind for 99 I was seriously getting over 600k xp per day
---
He's built like barney
---
Should use dust runes and laws in pouch so you can have an extra shark if needed instead of house tabs!
---
Im sorry, i dont understand assholeish
---
Even though it’s easier since you don’t have to bother flicking
---
If bonds didn't exist more people will just rwt, bonds help the game by reducing the amount of rwts. Most gold selling websites get gp from not farms, so less rwting less demand for bot farms. Plus, bonds allows players the ability to play membership without spending real money, while still funding jagex.
---
Time to dust off the desert robes.
---
&gt;No ornament on fury
---
0/10
---
Doubts
---
Barbarian Fishing is nice on mobile. Also I've been told wintertoldt is pretty easy.
---
Could the auto trim feature on skillcapes be removed? It'd be qol only for fashionscape.
---
Where is stealing creation🦀🦀🦀🦀$11🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
nice
---
Hmmm proper weird you, really defending your crappy (karma farming) calendar. Deciding outright what belongs and doesn’t, with no talking about it. Also assuming I was talking about What ever happened with a-friend
---
I find semi AFK skilling great with mobile. I got myself 99 woodcutting (magics, then redwoods) while at work. Also fishing monkish is pretty relaxed and not bad money. Lately I've been doing blood runecrafting, and the stack of runes I've made is a great motivation to keep training.
---
The problem with OSRS early-mid content is that there's lots of it... just not for every aspect of the game. Fishing, mining, farming, and smithing have gotten minigames and that make the grind from 40-80 more enjoyable. However, other skills like herblore and crafting are still hellish, especially for ironmen. There's no decent resource gathering system except PVM, nor is their a slow-XP by AFK alternative to normal training.
---
Completely free after an undisclosed period of time* by giving money to an undisclosed company. It definitely is dishonest means to not call that MTX.
---
You're definitely part of the target audience then, of people that don't like playing the game but want to progress in it.
---
Insane RNG, but Anti dragon shield &gt; DFS. DFS is giving you a negative range bonus IIRC.
---
Man I really need to get my torso
---
I agree with that. I'm a little less bothered since I now know this content will be available to all players at the end of the promotional period. I'm just cautious because I'm not fond of where RS3 is now and how the game got to that point.
---
Random question, but what should someone with 60 Slayer be grinding?
---
I'd say its pretty plausible if you have nothing else going on in life
---
Do you happen to have a link to the original?
---
Oh, very neat! It doesn't seem to help with performance, but I did manage to tweak it to get RS3 running, which is rather exciting given the limited hardware!
---
Why cant we do anything? Will it still act like we hopped even tho the pker got the hit on us?
---
Lol.   Slayer.
---
what types of things don’t make sense for humans to do?  i’m fairly new myself.
---
&gt;	logging out
---
Look at this fuckin loser wasting xp over here
---
PMing you on an older account. Special service for corporate dick sucking you.
---
Yeah the animations weren't necessarily better but the textures were all significant improvements. Some of the remodeling of items was unnecessary like the scimitars but that version of the game was phenomenal. The distractions and diversions were when the game started to lose its luster for me.
---
Haha yeah fortnite bad am I right???
---
Wah. Cry more
---
Ahhh, well I switched it to the dragonfire ward since I’ve seen most people using it and now that I have the cash for one
---
Damn homie fruit trees are dirt cheap for the xp they give would’ve helped a lot but still gz
---
Default RuneLite plugin. "Interface scaling" I believe
---
They haven't released the names of the partners yet, as the deals I imagine aren't set in stone. That's how business works. 
---
I don't see how me being ok with free cosmetics that don't affect the game makes me the "core" audience. I've been playing since 2004 and quit at EoC. I love playing the game. Mobile lets me grind hours away that I wouldn't normally. No, no you're right. Because I don't think Jagex is being dishonest, I want progress with playing. Get off this trash.
---
I remember logging in this day, so excited to get home from school and play the “new game”. God good times
---
lol they're probably doing r/catfishhq. one of my boys did it in college he was pulling like $2.5k a week
---
Are you dense? Jagex was going to allow it, they wanted to see the code of the client, and the OSHD devs simply refused to show it at all. That was fishy AS FUCK and that's the only reason it wasn't allowed to exist.
---
But sure, keep spewing your ignorant garbage.
---
This is entirely a QoL because I’ve been on the blast furnace grind. 1) could coal back left click empty it when it’s full rather than trying to fill it again and 2) could blast furnace collection of bars be changed so you don’t need to click the bar in the chat box, rather you just click collect and that’s it. Both small changes that don’t hugely effect anything, with 1) making mobile much less inconvenient
---
As long as you're not missing any hits, it should be fine. Strength is generally maxed first, as a higher max hit means more xp/h. If you plan on doing something like GWD, though, you're gonna need more attack.
---
Personally, I had around 80/85 attack by the time I maxed str.
---
Bot farms exploding 1000% seems sort of drama worthy though
---
&gt;I don't think you understand how bots work.
---
No, I do. There's scouting bots that spam discord where you're located. I don't think you understand.
---
I haven't used the vanilla client in years so someone correct me if Im wrong,  but I believe its because runelite adds a keyboard macro to hop worlds, whereas in the vanilla client you would have to click through the menus to hop.
---
Been playing for 15 years and I'm one of the ones not freaking out about this.
---
I am honesty more shocked people here are falling for Jagex's pseudo MTX sham and attempt to ease the community into full MTX.
---
MTX was going to happen, I've always said that it was just a matter of time, just shocked so few people can see what is really happening. 
---
In a few months/year you guys will look back and see this update as the beginning of the end, mark my words.
---
I would love this too, I was really excited to see there were more quests in the series since I didn't remember them from when I played in ~2008. Then I found out those were on RS3 only
---
what I never understood about raspberry is that you still need a monitor to use it right? obviously carrying a monitor around with you totally defeats the purpose but I feel like anywhere you'd go where there's a monitor you can use (such as a library) would have a computer thats better than your raspberry
---
I’m guessing here, but: 
---
The game doesn’t know what to do so you get stuck on the login screen with a “you haven’t logged out of your last session yet”.  
---
Meanwhile the PKer will be killing you as you stand still and you won’t be able to log back in until you idle log from your respawn point.
---
And if they bring in actual MTX that I think that is over the line I will stop playing. I don't care if this can lead to something over the line. Because then I would be mad all the time.
---
And again when ironman came out
---
This feels like it would make a good copypasta.
---
big boy shark
---
&gt;It is a really legitimate question as player feedback should always be welcome whenever players are affected by something.
---
No. Players shouldn't get to vote on everything that affects them clearly, you are wildly overestimating your importance. Every year jagex makes a budget, that budget impacts lots of things about our game. Do you think you get to vote on that? Do you want a vote on new hires at jagex? 
---
Jagex does lots of things which impact the game, but they can be roughly categorized into game updates and business decisions. You get to vote on game updates. You do not get to vote on business decisions. Advertisement and marketing are firmly in the business decision department and free membership trials are a marketing strategy. You don't get a vote on it. 
---
&gt;If you are sure that I'm in the minority, why not just poll it? Prove me wrong.
---
I'm not sure one way or the other, nor does it matter. This isn't the kind of thing we get a vote on.
---
How else would you attract new players
---
Imagine thinking this is why that dude lost pmod. Lmao.
---
"RWT or do whatever!" 
---
Are you a fucking donkey or what.
---
Nope, mostly money. You can get about 70k worth of seeds per contract usually, which can offset the cost of farming.
---
Been this way for 20 years. if you dont like it play a different game 🤔
---
Base 75 cmb I’d grind slayer, I know everybody says to do it. But when you’re making so much money it really is worth grinding past 70 you won’t have to worry about bond money eventually
---
Don’t worry I play the same way ! I love the stats so nicely rounded :)
---
Get out of here with your logic
---
Tbh, I don't mind cosmetic stuff. They said the dev team, and everyone at Jagex, agrees that OSRS will never have cosmetic MTX like RS3 does. I don't really see the harm in stuff like this. OSRS players are just extremely adverse to literally any change that would even resemble RS3.
---
Those are literally the two options when it comes to this game. In the end, you either care about efficiency or you dont.
---
What’s it called?
---
Wait until higher levels. The exp rates slow to a crawl and it's arguably the slowest skill to train.
---
Yes, but this same community continually passes shit like 100k xp / hr active farming or more afk rc with no issue. Then they REEE when it's something as completely unimpactful as allowing us to go through UP for regicide.
---
I’ve been averaging 3ish kills per trip and have to usually drop a couple sharks, I’d rather keep this set up and a guaranteed one click teleport if I ever mess up
---
They hit a high after mobile release and want to return to that.  They know a lot of mobile players are whales who will spend big.  The games currently stagnating in terms of player growth so wouldn't surprise me if they started attempting to milk the community.
---
I see where you're coming from. I've just never noticed or pinned that to bots, since prices of those items have been consistent. 
---
&gt; I could actually make a small amount of money by skilling. Can't do that now, 
---
Coming from WoW, i guess this is just kinda the norm for me. Low level crafting items or commonly obtained items are never worth much in WoW, and thats been consistent with my experience in OSRS. To make profit off skills OSRS (just like WoW), i've had to invest time and gold into them. Alternatively, i could farm my own materials and make some small profit that way. 
---
Maybe i'm an exception in new players (since im not new to MMOs in general), but there's always been a few items to profit off at whatever point in the game i'm at, while general low-mid level skilling is mostly just a money sink until i can craft/kill higher level things.
---
26 days to be exact (from level 62). I did yews 62-90 and Reds from 90-99. I was logged in around 10-16 hours a day lmao. Get up, 40 mins while having a coffee getting in shower etc before work. Do the whole day logged on at work on my phone at my desk, half hour break while a go for a mooch with colleagues. Then same when I got home till I went bed. I was even playing on treadmill when I was at gym aha. Proper hammered it coz I never had a 99 growing up.
---
It's just not a big deal to be revealed spoilers. I don't understand the obsession with spoilers on the internet. Any conversation about a story has to be censored for people who havn't read/ seen/ played it yet. It's overkill.
---
Osrs on the right monitor?
---
I thought I was bad with my one soda can. Holy hell.
---
btw :)
---
Fun fact: the frog will actually jump out when it gets too hot regardless of how slowly you warm it up (unlike the OSRS playerbase)
---
I dislike whoever made that quest. Every single interaction has to be confirmed. "Are you sure you want to try jumping over those short rocks?" Add on the excessive backtracking and it's like they wanted you to hate Legends quest entirely.
---
I'll admit upfront I didn't read all of this, but it sounds like you're thinking Amazon pays Jagex for this partnership. Generally speaking, with these sorts of partnerships the game developers are the ones paying to promote their game. At best, and this is not common, neither company pays the other and they just consider it free cross-promotion. Twitch is definitely the sort of partnership where you have to send them buckets of cash.
---
If I misunderstood you, my bad, but I wanted to clarify that point.
---
just a casual 10-12 hours ya digg?
---
That's a bummer. Thanks anyways :)
---
Probably twitch, steam, nvidia, spotify... that's some of the sponsors I recall from other games, could be similar in runescape
---
Damn that’s crazy! Some hardcore dedicated. Some props to you!!
---
IRON MEN DON'T HAVE MANY OPTIONS STARTING OUT
---
Ya i remember going to wildy with my friend to kill kbd and he rambo specced some polypore nerds at the obelisk
---
And we had no clue wtf was going on xD
---
Fury bruh???!!!!
---
its july though?
---
Bond is in game content which directly gives you in game gp already. It doesn't harm the game.
---
That a blow torch propane can on the floor!?
---
I don't want the game to die, and if it stops growing the game will die.
---
Bruh that forbes articles probably has less views than 1 swampletics video. News sites are not that popular.
---
fuck dude, you’ve just boosted my confidence to do some more wildy shit, had no idea this existed.
---
Unless you misclick or server lags then you wasted food and don't get to do as many trips
---
Bots exist even without free trials. Bots have existed in runescape since day 1.
---
Only if we get to see her with Sandwich Lady.
---
RuneLite+ is just a series of drop-in plugins for RuneLite, which are not malicious. They are, however, largely against the rules and consist of a few plugins that are blacklisted from being added to RuneLite.
---
In short; unethical but the primary risk would be a ban.
---
Addy kite guy is an iron
---
Thank you for the silver, kind stranger 🙏
---
And if you care about both?????
---
Yes. Please. And if Jagex could share the statistics on how many members that took advantage of the membership offer and played, vs the amount that have bottled that would be splendid as well
---
Only some dungeons will have an expandable in-game map. For the ones that don't you can find map on the wiki if you need.
---
Try stretched mode on runelite with it set to "fixed mode" in game. That gives me more of a boost than GPU does.
---
Does the CC only consist of IRL friends?
---
What I don't get is why not have auth delay? There is literally 0 downside and no argument against it.
---
Wow
---
Married with an 8 month old aswell. Still able to feed, change, play and take to bed. My guy hitting a tree on the iPad in the background. Mobile just makes so much easier.
---
how does adding cosmetic stuff affect bots
---
Yes please love snow
---
Nope, you outplayed him. Enjoy the money :)
---
Reminds me of a similar scam in MapleStory back in the days. People buying Steelies for 11m, while they were only around 7m. They put in 11,111,111, accept the trade instantly and close the trade within a millisecond - declining it. You trade again and you know that you have to be fast this time. He put's in 1,111,111 instead and you both accept in time. Rip 6m.
---
WHY IS THE GREEN DOT GONE FROM THE CONSTRUCTION SKILL ICON?!
---
Name &amp; Shame
---
You know they’re not talking about a house portal, right?
---
It just means you can make your walls green in your house.
---
Eh but a vote doesn’t explain *why* I voted no.
---
Some prefer to game like it’s the late 90s and fun/sense of accomplishment is more important than return on time investment
---
Trust trade.
---
If you care about efficiency you will earn real world money and convert it into gp either abiding by the rules through bonds or not through RWT sites. 
---
If you do anything else you are being inefficient at generating gold no matter what you do.
---
Nothing personal have an updoot
---
I don't think the OSRS team is dumb enough to make the mistake of adding anymore MTX. They have first party gold selling(Bonds) and that is all they need. Trying to get anymore MTX would just be a foolish financial move when such a larger amount of the player base is here to avoid the MTX of RuneScape 3.

Can you clean up the mushroom meadow on Fossil Island? It absolutely destroys my FPS on any device (including mobile). I tried doing Herbiboar but I had to stop after like 20 minutes because it made my computer sad. Aesthetically all the tiny mushrooms are messy too.
---
The free membership offers (twitch, 7 days free Google play, etc)
---
Use fire surge like a true Chad.
---
Well the randos probably knew how to play. Op clearly stated that none of them knew how to play.
---
Not necessary for a free player though, right? I noticed at a certain point, every new rune says members only.
---
Not with that attitude... 
---
But House Portal in Bruge De Rot would be fun...
---
you had to have left the area before equipping it, you have to buy it and equip it at ba right then and there
---
Also dont give me hints or answers, I'm doing this with no guide. I dont want to know if this is the wrong solution or anything. I just need to know why the red light isnt functioning.
---
As an ex alcoholic, many people can blow that high and hardly even feel it yet.

Promotional events, such as the twitch prime event that added the cosmetic purple skin, also came with free membership, which botters could utilize for bot farms
---
I hope you have some nats in that rune pouch because u know what to do next
---
That's a fair point.  It's a bigger discussion, but in short I find a difference between a monetary advantage that doesn't provide health to the game (MTX), and monetary advantage that does (bonds).
---
Agreed these would be amazing for fashionscape, and would help osrs get new players again. 
---
I swear this community is never happy with anything xD give them new updates, they whine, dont give them new things they whine lol. Cant please everyone I guess.
---
It's a joke.
---
I usually do on mobile.  But I am sadly broke enough I only have one PC for work and that's it.  I've considered going out to find a cheap laptop or something for osrs, but I am sadly still paycheck to paycheck atm.
---
Ah okay nevermind, he is the only one that grinds.
---
I'm using that! :)
---
Okay, so you're not a vampire then
---
Gotta love the short sightedness to not look at rs3 only being at 20k players and consider what may have caused that
---
Erverg
---
Download Runelite client, it has (among other things) all teleports listed on the map so you can see where you can get teleports. Most accounts use this client when playing on PC
---
Rc is basically useless for f2p. Can't  make any runes of value and you could get runes faster with any ol moneymaker and buying them. For f2p its basically  just a skill to grind out if you're a glutton for punishment  or to have a really neat status symbol. In p2p, its a solid moneymaker that's  just really tedious and monotonous to train until bloods, then you  can choose between afk as fuck or higher exp or a middle road with better profits. It's  never very  fast though, even with lavas
---
I would sell the suffering and lvl mage range first. Then maybe get anguish
---
Any good business knows that you have to use a significant portion of your profit on improving the business. That's how growth happens. I don't think Jagex is blind to this, nor are their investors. You'd hope that a higher profit margin means they can continue expanding the team and assign a bigger budget to content releases. Maybe eventually we'll get a new quest every month again like the old days. 
---
Jagex knows its playerbase has been built up thanks to content releases (for both F2P and members). They also know that MTX would destroy their playerbase. They're not idiots and they've learned from their archaic mistakes. I'll trust them until they give me a reason not to.
---
Im scared, its like they are saving up all the drama for one giant fuck up :(
---
Demonic Gorillas after MM2. You can check my submitted history and I think I posted my drops. I got insanely lucky.
---
I pray this doesn't happen again. Or at least with the option to switch between the current and new.
---
Happy to hear you're not letting this stop you from enjoying the game, and I'm sorry this happened to you. I'm sure you're aware but make sure to update/change everything, run a scan, use a different email, etc.
---
There's plenty of videos out there to watch on rebuilding, and quite honestly rebuilding can be the most fun you have with achievements and increasing value. 
---
That being said you seem like a really chill dude, so if you want add me and I can offer any advice/help you out any way I can. IGN: K0tov
---
Props to you for not giving up because of the assholes in the world.
---
I'm stuck at 93, my motivation to reach 99 is about 0.
---
Unpopular hot take: I actually enjoyed Ratcatchers, mainly because I didn't follow a guide for the guard stuff and they didn't endlessly fuck me. Was a lot of fun figuring out the right pathing for the area imo.
---
Void and salve stack? TIL
---
Nice one, I started an iron man a few weeks ago and I'm really enjoying the little challenges you don't even think about on your main. Every little upgrade feels like an achievement.
---
I mean, the 47 page Warding V3 google doc kicked up quite a stir.
---
Didn't do Bird House runs for tree seeds either?, well anyway job well done, congratulations on your 99 ;)
---
why is it when u hit someone it doesnt always hit them?
---
I'd better happy with this form of HD, not the 2011/2012 HD.  Jagex Pls
---
Why would we ever know this? NOBODY GIVES US A MANUAL! TYSM!
---
You're actually missing the entire point of this nmz strat lmao
---
The majority (4/5) of the mobs selected for this method hit a max of a 3 (Roald, Sand Snake, Count Draynor) or a 4(Trapped Soul), with the Kendal being the outlier maxing a 9. Saving the hit points from these hits is negligible with an inventory almost full of absorptions.
---
The point of this strat is to be able to afk for the maximum amount of time with the least amount of interaction, and most players (from my experience) that use this method profit on points anyways so they never run out of absorptions.
---
Again, you are missing the point of the method.  Least amount of interaction.  Laziness.
---
Have you tried getting vaccinated? I hear there's a small chance it could turn you into a skilling pro
---
I agree that the pmod getting his status revoked was drama, but you're getting downvoted for saying it's the biggest drama in years which it wasn't even remotely close to being.
---
You have to click once for every minute you train, how are you not getting this?
---
I’m seeing way too much “no Mtx, jagex good” and not enough “this is how I feel about 20x cosmetic changes entering the game”
---
I would just skip the task. They're horrible to kill, dragon legs have no use for irons really. And with the time saved you can do blue drags if you really want bones. But you should get ample blue drag tanks anyway
---
Loooool 🤣
---
farming contracts and slayer keys are killing the market, not bots when it comes to tree seeds.
---
Can we get a runelite plugin to add the green pixel back?
---
God damnit. I feel like I'm sitting behind the screen of a box pc screen running Windows 98..
---
If the new owners of Jagex are only interested in profits, then they’ll real most of the money made and only put in what’s required. Jagex aren’t the final deciders of their own investments.
---
Not according to JamFlex. Fuckers and their desire to nerf black dhide.
---
Anytime mate!
---
I have 98 rc. Next closest is 91 hp.

How realistic would it be for Runelite to have this feature? Seems like Jamflex is on good grounds with them, and they've would've been with OSHD as well if it weren't for how sketchy they acted about the whole situation.
---
arma is bis range, ancestrial is bis for magic.
---
swamp man good
---
All feedbacks on EOC was negative then they pulled the bullshit 80% of feedback were positive and released the EOC anyway. Sure didn't look like the remaining amount of players were 80%...
---
did that till 80 but pretty much sold everything to get base 80 buyables skills
---
Yeah I’ve mentioned that a couple times too, for a game where what your wearing is a massive part of the reward and achievement, getting something for buying something IRL is pretty lame.
---
wrong comparison, ds2 and mm2 brought content into the game for continue use after you are done with the quest, warding would just be a how quick to get to 99 to never touch the dead skill again, and never have to use any of the content in it.
---
Gay is not the same thing as trans
---
Level 70 with 60/60/60 will beat a pure? klmao
---
I know you’re being facetious but that sounds dope
---
Whats sad is it kind of almost did. I was expecting it to fail way harder than it did
---
What mid tear content have they added lol?
---
I don't think they will ever go full rs3 mode again with buyable exp.  They'll do a lot of less intrusive things like buyable bank space and cosmetic items.  Like a lot of people have already said though there's already buyable GP in the game that's perfectly acceptable to most players.
---
The only way to sort of instantly buy something is to adjust how much you pay for it.  So say raw chicken is listed at 35gp each, but you can adjust your offer to 500gp. At this point one of two things will happen:
---
1) Someone listed raw chicken for 50gp, and you bought it. You get raw chicken in addition to your money back(450gp in this case)
---
2) No one was selling raw chicken, or if they were, they were trying to sell it for more than 500. Your offer will stay in the grand exchange until you remove it or it goes through
---
Only time i can stand skilling is talking with people, watching something or doing something else on the side
---
Thank youuu 😁😁😁
---
Nah, 2008 was a terrible year for rs. You can't polish the turd of free trade and Wilderness PvP removal.
---
At least the profit makes it a more than worthwhile grind, definitely helps to stay motivated. I got my Hydra pet at 2067 KC, when my main goal was to get the Heads. Didn't get those until somewhere after 2,7k KC (1,9k KC since the heads were added to the table lol..). 
---
Even though the journey was surely rewarding enough of it's own, I know mind-numbingly boring this grind gets after a while. So you deserve proper credit for this feat of persistence, congratz! 
---
Btw, how many uniques have you gotten?
---
Did you relog after enabling it?
---
Everyone keeps playing? You mean like the vast majority of the playerbase that totally didn't quit in response to EoC and MTX?
---
By the way, it may feel good to preach about voting with your wallet and quitting in response to things like this, but when you take into account that things like Treasure Hunter are all about making bank of a small number of big spenders ("whales"), it starts to look a little naive.
---
Did you miss this part?
---
&gt;Any additions offered through partnerships will not be exclusive, and will be available for all members at a later date.
---
What skills do you hate training OP? Or which skills do you find the most boring? 
---
What I like to do is set a skilling goal — a month ago I decided to get 85 herblore for diaries/raids.
---
I calculated how much exp I needed and it was roughly 15m gp. So I grinded slayer until I had enough money to get it. 
---
Today I’m aiming for 81 crafting. That’s about 3m that I needed (once again I did slayer) and now I’m doing battlestaves for good exp.
---
Do PvM until you can afford to burn gp and convert it into decent exp/hr methods. Don’t do the 30k/hr cheap training. Shit gets boring fast
---
Perfect pitch has nothing to do with identifying musical structure. It's a combination of excellent working memory, a mastery of music theory, listening to lots of different types of music, and a bunch of practice.
---
I am level 40 range, and want to do Grand Tree and Monkey Madness, which weapon should I be using for the demons? I understand they can both be safespotted, and the MM demon can be taken down mostly by the gnomes, but what weapon should I be using? Mith cbow? Bone cbow? Yew shortbow? Something else?
---
Dude makes fake tinder account under the guise of "joking around", clearly has quite lengthy conversations with other men (since it got to the point of talking about OSRS) and likely gets some enjoyment out of the male attention, I couldn't imagine anyone doing this stuff for actual fun, as opposed to projecting their own issues or trying to satisfy urges which they may or may not be aware of. The amount of effort required to set up the account with fake pictures + talking to guys just screams closet to me. Might be wrong though, could just be a very lonely person.
---
That’s the first step to a terrible life. Letting things get to you.
---
if you use runelite, there's a plugin that allows you to change shift holding to use. what i do if i cant log out is just continue using bones on the shrine while swapping prayers. i get my exp and it's fun little practice for pvp, plus a fast respawn instead of just mashing the wine on the table
---
Been reading all these comments wondering why people are so hung up about the absorbs, not like its hard to get them and you just stack points after awhile to the point of it not even being close to a problem
---
Who fucking cares, are you mad people will have them for 1-2 months before you do? Jesus man lol
---
Because this is literally exactly how RS3s bloat cosmetic market started, thinking like this.
---
The line “just cosmetics” has been so normalised it’s insane, don’t forget cosmetics are one of the most important aspects of OSRS, and the most expensive.
---
I don’t want bloated cosmetics that undermine actual cosmetics I’ve earned and make them feel meaningless, I don’t want to start the trend of MTXlite (which infuriatingly is proving just how gullible gamers are and how companies like EA can exist, I mean literally the exact company did exactly what players are wary of and people defend Jagex and say, they’d never do that, it’s just x!)
---
This whole situation is infuriating, Jagex has proven it will take an mile if given an inch, even the poll question doesn’t bother to mention it’s a partnership at all.
---
I work in an office where the boss knows what osrs is okay with me playing osrs as long as my productivity isn't suffering so I stay at Motherlode Mine pretty much all day afking the upper level until I get home and I just enjoy mining a lot. Plus the community on W446 mlm is really chill and we chat and say good mornings/afternoons/evenings and pretty much everyone there who has been there knows who I am :)
---
Going back in the not-too-distant past, I seem to recall a lot of people complaining about the lack of lower-level updates, complaining that all that was released was end-game content. Personally I think they have a good balance (aside from PVP updates). I have an end-game main and a mid-lvl iron and am pretty happy with both kinds of updates. Plus, collection log makes a lot of that low-level content exciting again! Something satisfying about getting a useless item like purple gloves off of a crawling hand an seeing that entry checked off in the Log.
---
The features that you're talking about require a very good CPU and a strong PC which I as a casual player don't have. HD could run on my shitty old computer with no problem.
---
Also, your take is not really good because even with all these add-ons, RSHD in its element looks vastly different and less wonky
---
Hi come to mine and we'll also make fun of you ^
---
I wonter how many times we'll see this before it stops getting reposted
---
Because they don’t want people to quit. They want to normalise the idea and slowly introduce more and more MTX or whatever term they want to call it, have you not paid attention to any of the strategies in the gaming industry today, or even employed by Jagex themselves?
---
Wait, so they do care about long term profit?
---
This is posted every week yet nothing is done about it :/
---
You understand that in an MMOs lifetime, a game dying out over 2-3 years is short term, yes?
---
I just cant understand why you dont see this
---
Projecting /prəˈdʒɛktɪŋ/ _(Adjective)_
---
"to wrongly imagine that someone else is feeling a particular emotion or desire when in fact it is you who feels this way"
---
Killing people who have no chance to fight back, good one.
---
if you get hacked you were not careful enough...
---
Theyve done it before. Its to gain exposure for the game, the goal isnt to charge for discontinued cosmetics.
---
Oh you can find that one on the Barb Barcrawl for sure. It's a solid 10% ABV so that's a +7 str but -7atk/-7agi
---
Lmao. I work in Swampletics, i promise you that Swampy boy gets more than 400k views each video, and has peaked at near 800k.
---
I think the with particle effects a little reallly goes a long way.
---
With edge respawn and doing one inventory at the time, PKers are actually the best means of banking
---
was an insane weekend no doubt! whose set was your favorite?
---
It's possible. Older account use usernames instead of e-mails. I more so did it for privacy, though. Not sure if everyone wanted their names posted.
---
If you’re in combat you can go up to 20 I believe, as long as you don’t leave combat. There’s a certain tile you can stand on to always ensure you’ll be in combat
---
Yeah, that sounds about right! I spammed the ironman ccs and the BA world for hours and finally gave up. It's hard to find a team.
---
Oh interesting.
---
'Twas a good Friday night.
---
Not surprised, 90% of helmies are toxic fucks
---
I clicked the trees, that's my 2nd least favorite skill
---
Thanks! It's not as bad with friends, for sure.
---
I don't have an issue with bonds or mtx in general, but the gower brothers stated that runescape will never have mtx. Yet here we are.
---
Adding cosmetics to osrs in return for promotions is a slippery slope towards mtx for cosmetica.
---
Once again, I have no horse in this race; but that's the argument and I think it holds some merit.
---
had 80RC
---
Removing it failed a poll.
---
🦀🦀 Jamflex don't respect poll results. 🦀🦀
---
Nice you hate people because they play the game. Good to see!
---
Why do you seem to think I care about the cosmetics? All I've seen over the years by the community is that they don't want MTX in the game. This is essentially MTX, it's all i'm pointing out.
---
So your prediction is that they will continue to add MTX until the game dies off in 2-3 years?
---
ah yes. free trade removal and no wilderness.
---
truly a golden age. ^^^/s
---
Yeah but you have raggers casting it with water staffs or at best a 50k ancient staff. Why should a 94 lvl spell rip with no risk? I thought pkers lover the risk reward bs
---
the lads
---
Damn, how much have you made?
---
&gt; If you're consistent with the timing you don't ever get hit
---
That is equally true for lazy flicking though. I thought about it some more and the only situation I can think of when you might want to flick every tick (besides, obviously, when you're being attacked every tick) is when you have to deal with very high ping making it too difficult to simply count ticks.
---
Could also possibly get a 4th kill in there since youre dropping sharks if the loots more valuable than the blue dhides, i usually go for 5-6 and leave all the dhides
---
it didint really take a downturn up until eoc. Every update was good until eoc
---
I still cry about how I lost my D defender after a 300 kc. I mean I did get it again after like 15 kills
---
Seriously, can we stop creating doomsday scenarios like as if they're going to poll actual MTX if this passes and calling it a slippery slope?
---
They fucked up on RS3, do you actually think they don't know by now how much we're against actual MTX? Seriously, the average age of the OSRS player is like 22, act like it for fuck sake.
---
Don't pull the argument of 'new players will take over', that will never happen. The core of the osrs players has an average play-time of 8 years of runescape. 8 Fucking years. Majority of is quit when EOC was announced, or hell, quit when they removed our ability to trade or pk in the wild.
---
Riot, rage, make posts WHEN they actually try to introduce MTX. They've even gone out and about to include something like their CEO being against it. They all know it. I am not going to assume they suddenly think "oh they vote yes on this? Bet they want actual mtx too lol lets just poll it". 
---
Use some critical thinking without using a tinfoil hat, please.
---
Fairly sure any kills after the brothers is just maximizing runes 
---
Your armor piece chances are maxed after killing the 6 brothers
---
lmfao you deadbeat min wage tramps get so upset when you get called out for being poverty lowlifes. absolutely pathetic
---
that drawing is amazing - did you draw that?
---
Spend about 30min reviewing all the runelight plug-ins so you can see if you’re missing some awesome QoL that helps your normal play style.
---
Just use 2 attackers and switch to two healers at the queen. Its easy as fuck
---
Man i hated this update, it was cool at first to see how all my items looked different but the novelty soon wore off and i was miserable.
---
I dont smoke weed hahahahaha
---
Some of these boys need to do monkey madness
---
Thanks man, guess I'll remember that and use on a case by case basis. Cheers.
---
I'd hate to see monthly new cosmetics that some people get to brag non stop about and when everyone gets it no one will care anymore. It would be quite demotivating to the existing players who dont take advantage of these deals. Not a fan sorry. Not to mention the hoge amount of bots the twitch prime deal brought in.
---
If I repost this in hydrohomie, will it link only the ggx post or the osrs on top of ggx?
---
they label it separately, no way to tell if more bonds are purchased on osrs or rs3.
---
If we start allowing new home teles could the uri transform emote be used as a home tele for those that have unlocked the emote?
---
Damn dude I literally got both of these items in my iron today too. Got rune c now on 8th crazy archeologists and black mask in like 159th cave horror.
---
Some people are born with superhuman abilities that aren’t quite sci-fi superhero level abilities but definitely are there.
---
No drama? What about the pmods that got their status removed?
---
thanks didn’t ask?
---
Lmfao Jagex release insane profits made ladt yeat
---
You’re a grump
---
Are we really still acting like cosmetics have no effect on the game? Go take a look at RS3 and tell me cosmetics don't affect the game. 
---
Are we also going to act like cosmetics don't have value? Just because they don't give you more xp/hr or a higher max hit doesn't mean they're valueless. Why do you think people buy third-age armor or dragon full helms or ornament kits? These all have value and provide very little or literally no use.
---
_________________
---
&gt;I don't understand the people likening this to MTX since they have also said that all partnership exclusive items will be made available to everyone at an appropriate time.
---
 
---
The fact that everyone gets the item/cosmetic later doesn't make it not mtx, if anything it confirms it. How is paying for something to get earlier access to it not mtx in your eyes?
---
Not to mention the fact that this has all the signs of Jagex just trying to get their foot in the door with mtx. Start small with things like this and soon the game will look just like RS3.
---
If the player base supports this now, the game will be near dead in no time. Two years from now there will be 5,000 players online, all using cosmetic overrides to look like clowns with glowing eyes, wings, and a purple aura they got from Twitch Prime.
---
I don't have dream mentor done so idk if I should do nmz before hand. Working on 99 thieving now
---
This is the RuneScape I'm attached to. Pretty much until 2011.
---
If Rune HD was a graphics option I'd probably stay subscribed instead of subscribing every other 4 months when I need a nostalgia rush
---
It's pronounced "tie-th"
---
woah man, sorry i forgot risking 50k bled the bank. Dats risk boiz
---
Gl on the grind fellow iron brother
---
Hahahahahaha wilderness ass
---
Would you consider ely better than avernic?
---
I have a bank pin. :(
---
Lol, imagine complaining about this and calling it MTX when you can literally buy rsgp (without breaking the rules) through bonds. Literal MTX but everyone is up in arms about this lmao.
---
I think its so that you only have 28 extra inventory spots that need to be tracked. If you had 100 looting bags thats 2800 spots that could be full which wouldnt work, the game would crash.
---
they already set the precedent with forcing through f2p teleblock
---
yeah who gives a shit about a green pixel but expect this to happen more often with things that are a bigger deal
---
Bad thing is that the Tom user folder shouldn't be there.
---
Do you have placeholders?
---
I don’t know if this is a common opinion or not but when this shit dropped I absolutely hated it. I thought it made everything look so clunky and goofy. I much preferred the graphics we have now, especially for things like bronze-rune plate armor sets. It would be cool as a toggle though for those who enjoy the aesthetic more. that’s completely harmless to the game and I’m all for it.
---
Thanks for following up.
---
It's surprising to hear it's faster than the rest. I would have expected firemaking and combat to be faster. Get some strength levels first so you hit harder while you train attack and then defense. 
---
There are combat tutors just north of the castle in lumbridge that can give you some starting gear that should help a lot. 
---
Level 99 in a skill is 13 mil xp and rune rafting is sub 30k xp per hour for a loooong time. By comparison, you can reach up to like 600k xp per hour with construction.
---
Fear mongering.
---
Players: We don't want pay2win in our game.
---
Jagex: Uhh we already released bonds, making it possible for people to purchase oldschool runescape gold with real money 
---
Players: But thats different because we were already buying gold from chinese gold farmers
---
I understand the concern but I find it a rather big leap going from partnerships to actual MTX though. Do you genuine believe they will just implement things such as "get xyz item/bond" from twitch prime just because we voted yes on wallkits, emotes or colour?
---
I get that people are incredibly on the fence with just a mention of anything remotely in the direction of mtx. You have a fair point of partnerships not being polled at all, I honestly don't mind them partnering with things such as twitch prime because it spreads the word more on different platforms. 
---
I fully understand that people are completely against anything that doesn't get polled (integrity changes also fall under this, I think the concern is fully valid too) However, I also believe that the osrs jmod team deserves some credit regarding how they've handled osrs so far. 
---
Yeah I realise that there's been so much drama, I'm not saying we should sweep their fuck ups under the rug, hell no. But can we also take a look at the many things they've done right, owned up to and changed. I have not seen a single mod/dev team be this involved with a community that sometimes can be straight up unreasonable towards the point of being fucking stupid (myself included), the bar is also set incredibly hard for the osrs jmod team (due to previous failings: eoc, sof, etc.) I think the only dev team that is involved with their community off the top of my head is GGG (Path of Exile).
---
tl;dr - I get why people are so on the fence with anything mentioned towards MTX, but let's be real. RS3 is going to die, not this year, but in the close future. If these (so far) harmless partnerships are a way to get more revenue, why the fuck not? We still get to see blog posts, we still get to vote. They will literally lose a vast majority of the playerbase on the introduction of actual mtx. There's no way they will do it.
---
That is how rng works
---
Yeah top tier spell is crap ass gear is still OP. You can't stack a 130 w/o gmaul and an ags right? Means you have to bring an ags while with barrage you just need like 50k in runes. Mage doesn't have the same KO potential as range and melee but barrage can hit hard and has a long ass stun. You argue it takes RNG but doesn't stacking 100+?
---
It's standard procedure to only let people purchase a single instance of items that share their inventory.
---
"You have used your alloted transactions in the grand exchange for the day. Please watch this ad for additional transactions. *Coca-Cola commercial plays*"
---
yup, you can do one hops run and get all the protection u need for them too. instead of buying as theyre \~1k each
---
This was a shit update and made me quit to start playing wow again and private servers. The osrs graphics are a huge part of what make RuneScape, RuneScape.
---
Just did the quest with slayermusiq and it went fine. You must be doing something wrong
---
this is probably what i meant i haven't used it in forever. thank you for clarifying
---
Made me laugh. Thanks.
---
It’s just that you don’t actually lose anything for free Alchs
---
engine work. anything that has to do with item storage is engine work
---
The general strat is to buy a few months and save hard. So you don't perpetuate the sub 10m struggle. I would plan it out so you get enough for two bonds at least. Blast furnace sucks ass but it's always profit. Most of your money will not come from f2p skills is the issue. Try to get a skill 70-80 before you take the free week, that'll get you more to work with.
---
Ahhh I seee
---
The ring of visibility is an item that even when its protected turns to coins in your inv on death
---
No paid cosmetics are acceptable. I don't personally don't think the promise of a rainbow tail is any real incentive to the majority of potential new players.  
---
OSRS has been growing steadily since it started getting quality content updates, MTX assisted growth leads to a playerbase that is more generally complacent with MTX, and the cycle continues from cosmetic to XP.  
---
Whatever it is they are doing now, is either incredibly insidious or genuinely misguided.
---
Oof, last time I read it I thought it wasn't there. Guess I'm just blind
---
which of these are actually rare?
---
They’re cosmetic and one was just for completing the halloween event, what does it matter if they’re rolled out for free
---
