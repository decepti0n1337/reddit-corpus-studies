You can barely stand there and attack?

I don't think dissolving will have as wide a spread or long-term benefit if it was packaged this way. These skills already have training options, and making dissolving compete with already set exp rates will never happen, especially if it involved RC (which is the most logical, really liked the idea tbh)
---

---
Basically, take smithing for example. If you were to stuff smithing into the crafting skill (which is logical in real-world sense), the value of bars/ore wouldn't be as stable since players have plenty of other training options, like bstaves. But then bars/ore fall in price, become new meta, followed by bstaves falling, ect., eventually having the opposite effect of what was originally intended.
---
The problem is there's no indication of such for high level items
---
It's all steel platebodies and robetops in their examples.
---
There's only going to be like 5 types of vis
---
Now they're also saying you can splash for vis, so I really don't know what to believe.
---
Either because they remember playing rs2 before EoC and all the good memories of it, so when EoC came out it ruined a lot of their ideas of the game so they quit keep on thinking its a complete dumpster fire. The warding part is because some osrs players refuse to want things to change for what could be the better, as im guessing youve seen memes and such around the reddit page :)
---
Voting no
---
I have yet to see an actual explanation as to why "warding good vote yes" other than "it sounds epic and I need something new to do in my miserable life"
---
You're literally just repeatedly falling back on the same argument he already addressed.
---
Bwana why you gotta pull out the hard  B
---
It’s not passing
---
put some gp on these games &amp; nobody is complaining
---
weird flex...

[removed]
---
All of them who use ballista's are hypocrites. They just want to hang on to there skillcapes so they can feel better about themselves because they have no friends because they're neckbeards.
---
There are a lot of things that you find out by testing content that just don’t end up being thought of when you look at it from a design sheet. Also a lot of people who might have good ideas that others could rally behind haven’t given it much thought because it doesn’t actually even exist yet.
---
There’s no way that it is as fleshed our now as it could be with 6 months of live play and feedback.
---
Fletching is crafting but to ranged gear
---
Do you wanna keep going down this road because all of RuneScape skills are the same
---
Wait why are people surprised by this? It's a law of math.
---
99+99=198 - 98+1=99
---
198+99=297 - 97+2=99
---
Like of course this keeps going for a while...
---
Umm, more pkers doing LMS means less pkers in wildy.
---
don't be a defeatist youre just making it harder to pass
---
Nice construction pure you got there
---
Don’t do quests and you’ll get one
---
Anyone saying this is a season to vote no is crazy.
---
When’s the poll
---
If you do hespori I would forsure. It cuts off around 12h of growtime so u can fight it daily
---
im voting no LUL
---
He's just doing it for fun, it literally changes nothing. He just can't see his character but everybody else can. If anything, this hinders himself if he messes up a gear switch or something like that it's just harder to notice. I have no idea what you're confused about here..
---
99 warding brings back nieve to be your waifu
---
You speak of acting maturely yet you started your post with an insult. I welcome all criticism and read through it all - I want this to have the best chance it can and that’s only possible by listening to the community. 
---
You may say that a lot of players don’t want the skill, yourself I presume are within that group (sorry if I’m misjudging you), and that if we were to have truly listened, we would have dropped it already and moved on without polling. When have we ever done that? How is that fair to those who do want it?
---
I’m not saying the skill is flawless, otherwise it would have unanimous support and that I don’t believe is possible. Hell, people even voted no to the world map update - what possible reason could someone say no to that? I’m genuinely curious!
---
Regardless, you’ve already come to the assumption that it will fail the poll, which is fair enough. I personally can’t predict the future but I certainly won’t blame anyone if it fails, like you’re accusing me of. I also wasn’t saying that you think attack and strength should be combined, I’m saying the criticism of “Warding doesn’t fit as its own unique skill” isn’t a defined requirement as most skills are not unique as many are quite similar. Like attack and strength or crafting and fletching. Sorry that I wasn’t clearer before.
---
Anyway, I’m sorry you feel like I’m the wrong person for the job. I’ve played runescape since 2004 - I stopped for a while during the dark ages - and my most memorable moments were skill releases as they truly brought the world alive with activity. If my goals are misguided and my work not good enough for you, I can only apologise and promise I’ll keep loving the job and hoping people like my work as I grow and learn from the mistakes.
---
Your not wrong.
---
The community has gone down hill in a big way the last couple years.
---
Originally I think people did to protect their account info but it's become a bit of a meme to excessively block out info on these types of posts.
---
I think the other player can just use the item on the uim and it will transfer into their inventory or onto the ground for them to pick up
---
You can not, also triple jads are imo the easiest part
---
Well the evidence is speaking for itself: I see a way higher percentage toxic language in wilderness than I ever could dream of seeing on the court. You can say "it's not set in stone" - no it is not. But I can see a correlation if not causation. And even a correlative relationship means that toxicity will be reduced if we remove one side of it.
---
Yeah I like this idea, always wondered if there was a tool for this I guess there isn’t
---
Man you wiki guys are awesome!
---
BuT WhY nOt JuSt AdD It To RuNeCrAfTiNg
---
No of course, but I do contribute to the runelite repo and there’s so many eyes on it, given that Adam and the main team manually review all the changes that are pushed into the master branch, it’s so highly unlikely that if someone wanted to write malicious code that it would actually get pushed into the app. Also that’s why you use 2factor auth, even if they get your pass they’ll need your code to login.
---
Why are you playing this game if you think skills suck? This game is kind of mostly about skills
---
TLDR: A lvl 123 in shitty armour comes up to me and starts asking me random questions. We start chatting meanwhile hes dropping items around me to troll the whole time. He starts with a whip and then third age mage bottoms and i log my main under me in another world and sneakily log in to scoop it. He said he had rapier on him and he was gonna drop it next...gg free 20m
---
If that were true they would have forced the skill a long time ago with things too op for the game... At least they're giving you a choice now.
---
Again, how fast do you think it should be? 85 hours is 152k xp/h
---
34 hours is 382k xp/h
---
What is a reasonable xp/h to you, because those seem fine to me
---
Mate, I've been making mills at shades of mort'ton ever since I needed 80 fm for a master clue.
---
Firemaking has a niche, albeit an obscure one.
---
Same but 2277
---
Not really, there are better ones out there, a quick youtube search will provide plenty of methods
---
Why play the game in the first place if skills are shit? No ones forced to play and grind any skill at all
---
Yeah this, gives it a sustainable use and makes sense. I thought it was a great idea since the production skill needed a gathering skill to fuel it, and hunter hadn't been utilized yet save for dead crafting content
---
It's a small team. You can't expect them to put months and months of coding, design and animation work into something just so the community can say no and have to scrap it all.
---
Thanks man, I appreciate it.
---
Cb bracelet and grahzi rapier
---
Juiciest 30k I’ve ever seen
---
That would’ve been great! But sailing failed its poll.
---
Being a skill does not guarantee it will not introduce power creep
---
I really don't like how powercreep has become this death term. It's a required part of any mmo, or the game dies. Compared to rs2 osrs's powercreep is really reel'd.
---
I like niche scape for powercreep reasons.
---
Well I'm all in favour of *just* doing such polls.
---
Honestly I think people are forgetting that with the current attitude we're not only making it impossible to do anything for jagex as company. Worse we're making it so no developer wants to work there: for me as developer the biggest demotivator is when you create something, think about it thoroughly and suddenly it is "well we're not longer doing that".
---
You can only take so many times that before the job becomes "unbearing" and you start quickly looking for a new job. And from experience I know that it's not hard to find better places to work with.
---
So the polling will in the end mean that jagex loses their top devs, and it's not going to be possible to attract good new devs who stick.
---
&gt;this game is mostly about skills
---
Pvm would like a word with you
---
Except you have to be logged in the world when the item is dropped to see it?
---
I’m maxed fam. I dont mind grinding any skill but why add another shit skill and the only point that’s made is “other skills wouldn’t pass a poll”?
---
ikr! its insane, need to work on it though seriously lmfao
---
Username checks out (dudes).
---
How you PvM without using skills? Attack, strength, defence, HP, ranged, prayer?
---
And then people also hate. Osrs quests. But they hate kill and fetch quests too. Everyone Judy hates everything.
---
But new skills devalue my lumbridge-only ironman
---
Your comparison makes no sense to me. Crafting is mundane. Everything in crafting is something I could make in real life. And runes are a very different thing in lore than wizard robes. 
---
Neither of those really fit what warding does, and dumping all the stuff from warding into them would bloat the hell out of crafting.
---
No thanks!  Downvote me ok!
---
Didn't realise skills are the only possible update to RuneScape and the only thing they've ever polled
---
I never played RS3 bro lol Summoning was def in RS2. I stopped playing when they switched to RS3 and only ever came back for the OSRS. I just had to double check but summoning came out in the beginning of 2008. Doesn't matter if you liked the skill or not, I could give a fuck lmao. It was part of the game. So that's probably why you're getting downvoted. Also for intruding on a positive comment thread with nothing positive to say.
---
No I said vote yes you stupid ignorant neckbeard fuck.  Lemme guess you didn't read the 3 development blogs and then you came here to say this, typical maxed osrs player smh
---
any ss of his reaction?
---
Have all streamers experienced the traumatic EoC change? What about OSRS streamers who never suffered the trauma before?
---
Oh we misunderstood eachother, I have no issue with the xp rates/time to 99. My issue is the method essentially being 'making potions' or 'creating battlestaves or d'hide bodies' from 1-99.   
---
I'm not up for that.
---
And now what if quest A requires y xp, gives x. Quest B requires y+a xp, with a less than x? And gives no xp.
---
Sure the minimum can be calculated - it's always possible to do that, but this is not a trivial calculation in all cases. - What about the required combat during quests?
---
Some people just hate doing quests bro
---
Definitely would be better to poll some of the larger 'fixes' separately. How much of the community would support it if it were worked into runecrafting instead? How about if it didn't add any new BIS equipment in f2p? At the very least, it'd give the devs some insight into what the community as a whole likes or dislikes about warding. A straight up fail, especially if it's close, isn't likely to yield much information on what people want changed, or if the skill is salvageable as a whole, and a close pass won't tell the developers whether it's one massive hangup that got 25% of the community skeptical or a bunch of small ones. 
---
If there's 50 percent of the playerbase who absolutely don't want anything to do with warding, that's a very different situation from 10 percent being fundamentally opposed to it and 40 percent liking everything except the dissolving mechanic.
---
Why not higher the standard? You can't justify lack of design because 'other skills have it aswell'. 
---
Jagex should at least add something like cannonballs or arrow tips (something usefull in smithing outside of steel platebodies to high alch). You need the crafting skill for so much more than only crafting dhide sets, I know warding would have cool features too at higher levels but still. 
---
After reading it a third time, I realize maybe the flow-charts just killed it for me, just look how boring it represents a 'new' skill.
---
Artisan was a horribly designed skill in my opinion.    
---
It literally just adds an additional XP bar to skilling. Fuck off with arbitrary tack ons, thanks.    
---
Warding has content that could arguably fit in other skills, but at least it has content.
---
Personally, I think it should be one of those things like ToS Agreements, where you have to scroll to the bottom before you can accept. Make people "read" about warding before voting.
---
warding isnt rs3 but yokay
---
I had safe chat. :3
---
The design blog, maybe you should consider reading it...
---
D
---
What's a good monster to safespot on my iron with 50 mage?  Already got a rune scim (no bank btw)
---
It's Twitter. Who uses it for rs related crap besides those people or streamers?
---
It doesn't give money period, banking redwoods is just a waste of time
---
I'll counter by saying not all items on the ground reflect their actual size. KBD Heads are the most obvious example I could find, where the KBD is huge but its 3 heads all fit on 1 tile, despite being 3 Dragon Heads which each occupy a tile. Elder Maul is another item that when equipped, partially goes into another tile but  when dropped, is only one tile. But those are only cases of items that get smaller when dropped. We can see from [the pestle and mortar](https://i.imgur.com/ykC0Ssk.png) an example of an item that appears to be bigger when dropped compared to when you're holding it up and using it (you'd expect the inverse since the item is higher in elevation when you're using it, and closer to the camera).
---
If RS3 matters to you at all, they portray Runes to be around the size of your palm in that game.
---
There's a pull request for this feature that's been worked on for ages now. Not sure what the current status is though :\
---
I made 17 alts to vote no GET MAD
---
Time to hit those rooftops buddy. F tho... I quit way back when I lost my fire cape lol.
---
No, it isn’t.
---
I’ve seen the arguments that Warding could easily be shared among other skills and that it doesn’t stand alone well enough. Personally I disagree with the idea, which you’ve pointed out is odd as I also believe something similar could be done with Sailing. That’s because I believe sailing functions more like a minigame and not a skill, while Warding I feel shares more similarities with other skills than a minigame. That’s what I was trying to get at, I’m sorry for not being clearer.
---
I didn’t say I’ve spent a lot of time, I said I’d put in as much effort. You said time and you assumed it was loads but to know that you’d need to know the amount of time - I’m sorry if I offended you. Honestly, a fair amount of the work I did at home in my spare time. I’m very lucky that I got to turn my hobby into my job, but it does mean I get to do a lot of work at home. The wider team have also put time into, of course, but we’re certainly not walking away from this with nothing if it fails - we’ve learnt a lot during the process.
---
The reason your brought this up was because if it fails it’ll be a “waste of time and effort”, which is true, but it’s true for literally every update. Skills are at more risk as they are very divisive as everyone is very passionate about exactly what they want from it and to get 75% to agree on that is difficult. This one may have had more time to work on it than most due to that, but the players wanted to know as much about the skill before they cast their vote - this was us listening to the players, I’m sorry if you feel we went about this the wrong way.
---
“Add the mage gear the community (NOT the company) want” - this sounds like you know the exact will of the community even though the votes are yet to be cast. Perhaps if the skill fails but all the content passes, that would mean we could do it the way you’ve suggested. I was just saying we should let the voting system play out before preemptively jumping to conclusions - sorry if I offended you.
---
I agree with you completely with your last point, I’ve noticed the discussions regarding whether it’s enough to base an entire new skill around. As I've already said, I personally disagree with them, otherwise I wouldn’t be supporting the skill. Of course, if the players don’t want it and it fails a poll, we’ll try something else. That’s the way we’ve always done it.
---
You ever heard of ABAB?
---
At the grand exchange
---
? Can you not read lol it clearly says weapon that will be OP
---
Literally shaking rn
---
Yes but like what armor? What’s good armor to buy there?
---
It's democracy, bitch, eat a dick. Don't like it, find another game. No one cares about your minority ass

---
Wow, the face. "good boy cape" Everything.  this is a 10/10 from me. i might go out of my way to silver this bad boy if someone doesn't get to it first.
---
Why didn't artisan pass then? It's pretty much the same thing
---
Such a butthurt loser
---
More like I don't like pineapple pizza so dominos should not offer it on the menu...
---
Rings are the size of a finger yet occupy most of a tile on the ground. It's not reflective of size
---
I'll give you this one, probably my favorite comment haha
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Depressed is not the appropriate word. They make me want to ignore OSRS. While I understand that the majority of people who will comment on my post would say "good riddance," I just hope that people can come to see that pushing everyone else away and being assholes will ultimately not help them either.
---
It is on my posts.  I think....
---
It wouldn't need to be removed from crafting. Smithing makes knives, itd be similar to that. Plus removing battlestaves from crafting would cause major issues with crafting levelling.
---
Weapons could be further expanded on in Runecrafting, though. And Warding could make the armor.
---
people shit on every new idea, yet almost every single piece of content proposed passes 75% threshold. Just look at any recent polls, only the most controversial questions fail.
---
I've been working on my first pking account, a 1def pure.  85 range/mage,  and currently 50 attack / 70 strength.  
---
I have 10 levels to gain in melee, trying to decide between 60/70 and 50/80.  60/70 would let me dds, 50/80 would be a stronger gmaul.  Any thoughts?
---
Id highly recommend pvm/high level bossing in rs3 above all else tho, plus it cant hurt to try out a few boss kills whilst grinding on alts. If anything it will make bossing in osrs seem infinitely easier.
---
would rather have a 2011 server then another osrs server.
---
Welp. Can't wait to try warding now lol.
---
4k is 4k. Ain't no way I'm paying $11 irl when I can get my bonds through gnomeballs
---
I wouldn't mind seeing Riding become a thing. Fuck walking around all the time when you haven't got fairy rings and an inventory full of tele tabs. I want to go explore without needing 20 stamina pots.
---
She's dead for me though
---
2008 here we come.
---
You're talking about a game that is literally just clicking on things and waiting, and bossing is just clicking on things faster.    
---
Then add RNG on top of it and this game doesn't require skill at all. It really just requires knowing what to click and clicking that thing.    
---
I've killed Jad like 4 times and not once did I think it took skill. Fuck, Fight Caves basically is AFK content. You just safespot and autopilot until the last wave where all you do is make sure you installed the 6 brain cells DLC beforehand because that's all you need to prayer switch.     
---
No skill will ever actually require skill lmao.
---
Wrong. Sailing wasn't fleshed out enough from Jagex. If it got the same amount of attention warding is getting, we'd have a sailing skill.
---
If designed properly drugs and gambling are built to make you feel this exactly. So I'd say the sand casino is doing it job as intended.
---
I wish there was more content that included the help of other players. I love osrs I just feel so lonely in the game.
---
No.
---
If you respect a game with buyable experience and in-your-face mtx then your opinion doesn’t count, stick to your dead game please. Cheers.
---
dumb idiot all the new skill are trash
---
Personally, I'd love to see more Support skills (i.e. Thieving, Agility, Slayer). I doubt we'll ever see another Combat Skill and there isn't much room for more of them anyway. There could be Gathering Skills, but there isn't much we're lacking in the gathering department; at least to the point of warranting a new skill. Artisan Skills are already the most common category if I remember right, but some like Warding could fit in well.
---
But for Support Skills, I am very anti-Artisan these days because it just doesn't work as well as it sounds. I'm more included for an Exploration style skill that could do for Areas what Slayer did for Monsters or something more along those lines. Even something like Agility would be neat; not saying run in a circle 2 but some optional side skill that has a good sense of progression and unlocks like Agility.

---
Dubs check em
---
&gt;There will always be a large group of purists and people who don't wanna lose their max cape, but I don't think that means the game should never have any significant change. Jagex has to move the game in some direction in order to attract new players, just the oldest and most committed players are not enough to keep the game alive.
---
The game's had plenty of direction and growth in the last 6 years without needing another skill.  We still get plenty of massive updates with new quests (DS2, MM2, SotE), new areas (Zeah, Fossil Island), new skilling methods, bosses, minigames... I really don't think the game is in danger if any number of skills were to fail polls.
---
&gt;Just seems like we could say no to three skills without acting like a bunch of animals and scaring away players who would contribute to OSRS being able to grow and thrive.
---
Agree completely here.  I wish every mildly controversial update didn't devolve into shit-slinging attacks.  Seems like the sub mods could do a lot to prevent it, but just choose to allow it to happen.
---
But there are new skills in RS3? It's just you lames playing OSRS.
---
I anger
---
You mean like fishing, woodcutting, firemaking, fletching, herblore, crafting, cooking, agility, construction, prayer?
---
It’s a good post.
---
YES YES YES
---
How do I get my character to have tits like that?
---
I don't think it is out of place for Dagon'Hai, in general, to be stronger than Ahrim's. The Warding Level did seem a tad low; perhaps that may change during the beta. But requiring 65 to make a Level 70 Armor isn't that out of place; it is just a bit unusual since most the existing skills are the other way around, which is something a lot of players have issue with (e.g. 99 Smithing for Level 40 Armor and to a lesser extent 80 Fletching for a Level 50 Bow). I could see them being bumped up to 75 Warding instead though, but the bigger factor will be the rarity of the material rather than the level to make.

They would know you used his services. Or at least have an idea. He needs to come visit your laptop so you dont get caught.

There is a very good chance you clicked on a phishing link and gave them everything to keep your account forever. Very nice.
---
Here's the attention you ordered
---
I'd recommend paying for a month to get a headstart if you can because you'll make a ton of progress in members and get to the point where you can buy bonds before long but it will take a long time to get a bond so early on as a f2p player.   
---
  
---
I don't mean to sound patronizing so bear with me if I'm saying stuff you already know, but you can click your defense in your stats menu and it'll show you the armors and their required levels. Check out the wiki at osrs.wiki and you can look up any item and read all about it and how to get it (other than the grand exchange), or anything else such as money making methods and quest guides.
---
Hahahhaha dude i fucking lost it. Maybe the rabbits and dear should stop walking onto firing range and shaking they asses at the scope.
---
Account sharing is not bannable. Just at your own risk.
---
would you let your wife/gf sleep with another man while you watch? how can you not be a fan of something without even having tried it?
---
&gt; The same thing has already happened with every other new skill polled
---
yes, all two of them
---
I remember back when the original warding discussion was happening.
---
Some dude claimed that "he didn't want noobs entering *his* 2200 worlds having it easier with an extra skill"
---
I argued back that having a difference of an average of base lvl 89's to base lvl 92's but having that in more skills was miniscule and is by no means still "noob".
---
His only defence was "come say that to me in a 2200 world LUL"
---
I hate to resort to this, but what a goddamn Hurr-Durr brainlet gatekeeping response to a new skill.
---
Probably legal reasons behind that decision.
---
“I can see how people get addicted but for me i dont see myself doing more than a few grams of heroine every once in a while”
---
100% agree with this.
---
Thanks for being civil and adding to the discussion!
---
huh, I could have sworn it was at least 4k judging by the small icons, thanks brotha
---
Yeah no problem it's a common misconception
---
?? Why would you get loads of fire capes before getting zuk pet lmao
---
What if runes are actually this small...
---
I'M SPOTTED!
---
DOUBLE TIMING IT.
---
FIRE MAKE GOOD, IT COOK SHRIMP
---
Understandable. I still don't want it since I think it'd change the meta/feel of the game too much.
---
Basically OSRS would then become Slayer or Artisan. Already it's sort of a waste to train combat without slayer because you can level two skills at once, and also 15% more effectively. Artisan gets added, all skilling then becomes inefficient unless it's artisan. Tbh just seems like it'd fuel more of the efficiencyscape mentality all around.
---
I read the blog, read what other people think and I still have to go with my gut and say no. 
---
If the warding content was rolled into one with Runecrafting and rename it Magecraft or some such I'd say yes. But as it stands it feels like they've plucked a few things out of Magic, RC, and Crafting and called its own thing, which doesn't rub me the right way. 
---
This is shown with the skilling rings. What's the point of the enchantment spells if you need a whole new skill for some specific items that are practically the same? The same can be said about the elemental tombs. Whats the difference between stuffing elemental magic into a mystical rock and a magic book that both do the same thing?
---
Don't get me wrong, I like most of the content, the new mage gear, repairing rune pouches, (potential) removal of imbues from the NMZ, and the other items are cool and well needed.
---
My answer those that say adding these things to RC would be dead content or OP content is this: Due to the fact there isn't much in the way of mage gear, there's going to be a demand for the new sets and untradable items. Because of this, people will have a reason to train RC. To those that say it would be OP and no one would make runes, then buff the XP from crafting runes to compensate.
---
the "good goy cape" is a more accurate name for it.
---
I remember the only reward I wanted was that spiked shield
---
Well from the sounds of it, he could go ahead and not get any gout tubers
---
I wish us mobile peasants  had access to this amazing tool but i guess we will have to suck it up.
---
Yeah because gambling in a video game every once in a while is the same as doing heroine. Great analogy
---
I dont have any skills maxed, but I dont think this game needs another skill which you train while having the game fill half of the screen and YouTube or Netflix fill the other half. At least give better ways to train runecrafting so it goes by faster. But no, the hivemind goes with "Dont touch runecrafting it devalues their 99" and "Add more skills so people lose their max capes"
---
I struggled on triple jads but cleared Zuk on my second attempt (first attempt I just straight didn't have the supplies for it).
---
Zuk requires far less focus than triple jads. With triple jads you switch prayers every 3ish ticks, while trying to aggro the healers. That alone was far more difficult than the entire zuk fight because it's hellish to try and squeeze in healer aggros while maintaining prayer flicks. There was just so much more to focus on with triple jads.
---
Zuk is just... learn the script by watching videos, know the HP times, and staying in front of the shield is trivially easy when you know the specific safe spots. I found it so simple idk. Different strokes I guess.
---
They do happen, they mostly just get hidden because whoever says they don't like it had their reply hidden within a few minutes since they get so heavily downvoted.
---
A skill shouldn't be added just for the sake of adding a skill. If it doesn't make sense in the current state of the game or isn't well thought out then it shouldn't be added because regardless of "how bad warding is" we are gonna have to deal with it once its in the game if it is released
---
I remember being top 50 and sweating my dick off lol
---
I actually went over varrock in my head when they announced the splashing change, and I thought there weren't really any rats or spiders to splash on? There's the sewers but that's kinda different.
---
Someone correct me if I'm mistaken, i haven't been looking around since the update.

i like bbq sauce but my mommy has been giving me plum sauce recently and i really like it

dhide has more accuracy void has more damage so generally you would use void for training or low defence enemies and dhide for high defence enemies, also void scales with your level because its a % boost so at very high range level 97-99 i forget exactly but void becomes better for most things
---
I dont get his point either.... maybe he pays real money for in game players with skills to do the quests for him?
---
herrr derr we need to stay in 07, stop adding new content, derrr.  How it sounds whenever a new idea is introduced.
---
Not too sure but usually things like this get resolved here on reddit, I upvoted your post. Hopefully you\`ll get your acc back because if I lost my runescape account I\`d probably end it all.
---
why?
---
1k comment woo
---
then just wait until you feel like doing slayer... you even said it yourself defense means almost nothing. i'm giving you advice to maximize your chance of loot and you're flaming me.
---
yes i know you already made billions but by using aggressive you're increasing your chances of more ffa loot.
---
dont flame for a suggestion
---
I just had a thought... What if later on they have a resurrected Nieve as a boss that drops a Jar of bath water
---
Idk, maybe it's just because zuk is more panic inducing. Ranger hitting you down go 40 hp in 2 hits can stress you out and make it super easy to run ahead of/fall behind on the shield. I guess with bad clicks triple jads can be hard, I never really struggled with them after my first attempt at them where my brain just turned off
---
wasnt summoning 2008?
---
still worht a try :P
---
aww keep at it youll get something soon
---
Also Id like to add, it allows new bosses to be added with drops thats dont introduce T90 gear since they can drop rarer warding ingredients. Lessening powercreep. and extending the life of the game
---
get someone to do diango claw spec
---
I understand what you're saying, but even for a new player or a less experienced player, creating a buyable that makes subtier armor set, is a trap. 
---
You spend $$$ to train this skill, unlock the ability to make said armor set,
---
Because the only real use for dungeoneering is to do more dungeoneering.
---
Stop all updates. Dont want people to get lost and confused in the grind
---
I don't listen to dead people.

The phrase is "cannot be assed/arsed" lol

I'm excited for warding. I first played in 2003. It doesn't scare me away. I think it fits well, same sort of mechanics. It's not too esoteric to me. Dont know what the other guy is talking about

---
That person didn't even use sara strike even though he had it.
---
what the fk is Artisan lol
---
You don't bank stand for those... Granted, lots of people do nmz to max, but that is an entirely different issue. 
---
I personally hate bankstanding skills unless they're given a purpose besides quest requirements or diaries, e.g. herblore for raids. 
---
I don't know what I will vote for tbh, I may actually just skip the question and vote for the other questions. Because as is I wouldn't vote Yes, but after years of development the skill may actually be very useful and fun. For example I could see warding being used in the gauntlet for obtaining magic equipment, which could make the game more enjoyable.
---
'it fits' just isn't a good enough excuse.  
---
There are plenty of garbage skills, having another skill fit in the same garbage mold is not a viable reason to add it.
---
All in your name is 4x as rare too
---
Why would you equate a new skill in a video game to putting nails in your hand and feet. So just because you don't like putting nails (a new skill) through your hand (your precious game) means no one else will? Also I don't see how your argument relates to mine. You see I said some people actually like runecrafting (or putting a nail in the hand as you put it) so some people will like warding because it cant be as bad (putting a nail somewhere less painful like an earlobe). What is stupid about your logic is that you got the equivalency of your argument wrong. That's pretty terrible logic. My arguement has a fallacy too which I though would he pretty obvious to you, I said warding cant be worse than runecrafting and there's no way to prove that. That makes my whole argument false to begin with.
---
Did it ever occur to you that it wasnt my intention to be taken seriously?
---
You're probably more likely to get further skills if warding passes mate
---
Neck beard nerd rage over *a video game* 
---
There is literally an active slave trade happening in Libya  and people put way to much time/energy and getting way too upset a video game
---
Lots of people like slayer because it's a cash skill. It isn't fun to do just the bosses
---
Just keep in mind though, that if you don’t want to train it, then great you don’t have to. Just like some people don’t like training crafting or smithing.
---
I agree, same way I feel about slayer. Never should of been a skill.
---
summoning is a good example of how a skill can completely change the game even when the developers don't mean for it to.
---
Shit man this is wholesome. I love it. Kim gonna message you my username. You ever have any questions, let me know. I'm not maxed or super high level or whatever like a lot of people here are but I'll definitely help out.
---
Hey notbad
---
I agree people are taking this way too serious, but this is flawed logic.  By that logic, what the hell kind of right do we have to play videogames when somewhere in our city a charity probably needs volunteers?!1
---
I’d probably train warding
---
thanks i really appreciate you taking the time out to type that to help me out, ill keep all of these in mind!

Did they remove the free membership trial with Twitch Prime?

I have twitch prime, but the only RS offer I see is something called the Umbral Pack.

probably.

I haven’t seen anything official on the date but they usually go 3-4 days
---
Me? Never once called someone a neck beard lol
---
3rd age helm in bag?
---
Imagine saying a buyable bankstanding skill that you train while watching YouTube or Netflix is content.
---
You misspelled mitre (+4 magic, +4 prayer). You aren't really going to be tanking hits, and if you want the def, I guess Neitz (+3 prayer) or Slayer Helm (+3 Mage/Range) would work. But I don't think def has too much merit at Zulrah. But yes, serp helm is waste of gp.
---
Hopping to ososrs if both pass

never getting summoning sorry it breaks the game mechanics
---
Was thinking the same. lol
---
People don’t have to train warding if they don’t want to. There’s a guy with an almost maxed account that has 99 in every skill except level 1 hunter, because he hates the skill.
---
You consented by crossing the ditch bud

I have yet to get any great drops from monsters or bossing. But I got rangers at like 100 mediums so I'm happy with my luck for now.

---
You can choose to be apathetic, it's the American way. Usually I spit on homeless people when they ask for change because I gotta pay $11 a month. I care more about me
---
The thing is, they're doing the beta regardless. If you vote no, they're not going to get all that time back. I understand you may have wanted a different skill or dev time put somewhere else, but now that its been spent this way already, do you think the content is bad enough it needs to be prevented completely? (Maybe you do). Please don't vote no to spite the devs either, because a lot of people do want the skill, and it impacts us too.
---
(For context, I'm one of those weirdos who above all else wishes Jagex would put their resources towards bringing back RS HD. But I'm not gonna vote against Warding because it seems solid enough to me, even if it's not my favorite use of their resources-not even top 3.)

Armor should have its usages at least though i dont really see anything interesting coming in with warding. I for one have no interest in repeatedly making say mystics or something over and over. I wont be using it anyways and for the most part neither would others with things like ahrims and ancestral being accessible.
---
&gt; Dont touch runecrafting it devalues their 99

we don't say this, we say, don't touch runecrafting, its literally fucking fine.

If you need runelite to play runescape you aren't actually playing for fun, just competing with players nonstop.
---
I think there’s an option if you use a different application like RuneLite vs something else. You may have to explore the options but im sure i did this a long time ago
---
Jagex just doesn't have the resources to knock out so many of them unfortunately.
---
No they were basically just slightly better than arma/bandos. I wasn't playing at the time, but I believe the main reason people voted no to them was just because they didn't want gwd to be usurped for BiS body/legs.
---
Lol I feel guilty
---
U sir, are a smart man
---
lore is nice to have but it doesn't warrant the creation of a whole new skill for it. Most of what warding has to offer has already long been in the game or has major overlaps
---
Lies
---
Fuck it, let's just add EoC and MTX. I'm sure you wouldn't mind since it's just a "19 year old point and click computer game", right?
---
you can't say that when your sarcasm is a position that people hold unironically
---
Must have been tiring to say this at the end of every round
---
WARDING IS PRETTY MUCH RECYCLED CONTENT OMEGALUL
---
I first started in 2002, and I absofuckinglutely turn on GPU and smoothing. It's personal preference, and has nothing to do with anything else.
---
k0
---
It lacks integrity would be appropriate. It doesn't stand on its own as a skill, it was isolated from the rest of the game, and didn't reward exp fairly with regards to effort vs speedrunning.
---
So, the sweatiest and most willing to shit themselves person with the best cash stack is going to win fletching then?
---
Training it isn’t needed either, no one is stopping you from being level 1.
---
Got lucky with a hard TT! Actually just sold the 3a as since I can use Barrows now and I have no use for it really.
---
Maybe. But if the server experiences high stress, it will also randomly choose to drop packets to clients which will disconnect you from the game in the same way OP is describing. If u lag, usually the game will stall. If the game goes on around you, then its most likely the server kicking u out /u/wonder143

What exactly are people testing? You buy supplies and sit next to a bank to make something with them?
---
Summoning was fucking broken.  Wasnt around for dungeoneering so no comment, but if your such a neck beard you want the most OP skill in the game back and wont accept anything except that then thats sad.  Summoning would 1.) be a massive workload for the dev team to get back up and running into the engine i assume and 2.) be an absolute nightmare to actually make balanced.
---
Agility to 70, or at least 60, then heavy on slayer

---
RS3 player telling me to grow up
---
Make osrshd also or I will facefuck myself to death on the lawn of Jagex HQ
---
Yes, OSRS lost its perfect nostalgic integrity when it started adding to the game.
---
But without updates the game would not be as popular. Games need updates or they slowly die. As they continually raise interest for players.
---
OSRS is 6 six years itself and still going strong that’s amazing. A rehashed game providing so much is literally unheard in the gaming industry.
---
But items you mention are powercreep. And a issue that’s been targeted multiple times.
---
EoC in 2012 is also way different than EOC today. Not saying it’s perfect but it did add a lot of depth to PVM. Take one look at boss encounters like Telos and the Elite Dungeons and suddenly prayer flicking and tick eating seems like amateur hour.
---
I’ve had a read of all of the blogs and I’ve gotta say I feel giddy like a child waiting to see this come out. It’s gone from something that just looks cobbled together, to being something that should’ve been in the game from the beginning.  I think it’s an excellent addition and fills a real hole in lore and the player skill set. The new armour in particular I think is very important, there were major gaps there. 
---
I’ll be voting Yes to everything except for the Fused Essence Pouch and the expanded Rune Pouches. I feel the former is contradictory to the spirit of Runecrafting, which has always been about compromise and balancing speed against XP and profit. The Fused Pouch seems a bit too “easyscape.” I might be interested however in a lesser variant that combines just the small and medium pouches, not the large and giant.
---
As to the expanded rune pouches, I feel it is over complicating something for no reason. I don’t see the rationale for the Elemental Rune Pouch, and I definitely think it is available at too low a level. I have no problem with the Wilderness Pouch as it won’t be craftable, though I would like to know what the lower cost will be. I can see the need for the Large Rune Pouch, but I feel it should be bumped up from Level 83 to level 90ish. I’m assuming the current Rune Pouch will remain purchasable from Slayer, but if they’re going to make these changes it should probably be moved into Warding, at around level 83, with the larger variant, as I said, around 90.
---
Anyway, I’ll be voting Yes to everything except 15 and 18, which I just feel need some more thought before being put into the game.
---

Propagantastic
---
&gt;People who are voting no to Warding just because it's a new skill and they fear ANY new skill would destory the game are just rediculous, based on the same logic they might as well lock their children in their room for the rest of their life because the small chance they will go out and die crossing the road, blocking progression is killing not helping.
---
This literally makes no sense at all. Where do you even get the idea that everyone uses their votes to prevent the game from dying? It's not even dying atm? Not that it would be a major concern for that many people even if it was. Most people use their votes to make the game more enjoyable for them, not for others.

How are resource gathering skills like woodcutting, mining, and fishing buyable?
---
What do you think are the most useful things? I’m fond of my dramen staff for hunter and a couple of other spots, but there’s gotta be a bunch of other things.
---
You'd be bored in a month.
---
Your right murder is the answer to this problem
---
I like the concept warding presents, my big negative with it is that it doesn't feel like the skill and content were created with the focus on player enjoyment and engagement. It seems more like a band aid skill to try and address the problem of nearly every item being useless in game. We have our best in slot weapons and armors(armours) and then raw materials for skilling. Take the entire bronze category for example, a brand new player can skip it entirely and wear iron but they have to mine and smith at least a few bronze items to train those skills to iron.
---
I feel like warding is just an attempt to bring at least a little value back to all the useless items with no value while also trying to patch the poor original game design that is the magic armor mess.
---
To be fair, there were also a lot less total clues to have to remember back then as well.
---
How does wasd camera work when chatting? Do they still type wasd?...I want to enable the camera but I talk a looot.

That’s what the leap is for, you could embrace for a two year rework or you could be pleasantly surprised.

---
no TLDR, def a neckbeard
---
Runelite  plus has it but don't go use the client I got a macro major ban and only use there client
---
Thanks!
---
you fuckin neckbeard brainlet sit kid
---
In that case this game would've been better off dead. Would it be as popular? Maybe not, but it would've kept away the new Jayden Smith, twitch, fortnite crowd that we see today.

Congrats!

Not really sure how slave trades in Lybia is supposed to be something enjoyable.  Sorry we can't read your mind to surmise something you never said.
---
I'm not sure if you're really bad at expressing yourself or are just trying to bs your way out of a valid criticism, but yeah either way you don't seem to be enjoying yourself here.  Maybe you should go talk about something that is enjoyable?
---
Looks cool, fits with lore, new items that fit a niche. What's the problem nerds?
---
"..no helm [equipped]" is what I think you meant. It wouldn't really make sense for you to claim that no helm is better than serp at Zulrah after you just recommended against it.
---
such a non argument, firemaking is a shit skill but its grandfathered in. just because we already have bad skills in the game, doesnt mean we just accept any bad skill that jagex comes up with.
---
Highest paying as in they actually don’t pay for membership and buy bonds off the GE right... or if they do pay with money then voting power becomes a micro transaction... so whoever pays most has the most say, how dumb. I say forget it to the 75% and let it be a direct vote in that case for warding, no votes shouldn’t have that much power if people are going to cheat the polls with multiple accounts and reeeeeee on twitch about it.
---
Don't like this skill at all and don't want to see it added to the game.  
---
That said, I DO want new skills and it sounds like the devs will be highly reluctant to ever create a new one if this gets rejected.  I really very strongly dislike this skill, but am considering voting Yes just to keep the door open to new skills in the future.
---
So I'm a bit torn on it and haven't made up my mind yet.  Will have to sleep on it.
---
I’d say 99% of people with 8 alts are paying for membership with in game gold. You could very well do the same thing with your gp. If you can’t afford that then maybe you don’t have enough experience on RuneScape to get that option, sorry
---
Okay you got me, you have less than half skills you HAVE to manually train
---
Any combat skill is NMZ afk'able so still buyable
---
Yes it's the "elitist" doing that and not the people who are posting the same memes daily with the same content.
---
If all you took away from it was "new skill does mage armour" you definitely need to actually read it lmao
---
getting around ip restrictions is trivial.
---
PvM being way, way too strong for resource gathering and money making in general is a big problem in this game. It shouldn't be faster to get magic logs killing Zulrah than chopping magic trees.
---
I cant even get a fire cape
---

---
Put it in RC
---
Can you share your gear setup?
---
I just logged in on mobile and I could see the heads. Problem solved
---
Alright alright lemme make the fuckin popcorn quick.
---
As someone who doesnt like skilling i kinda like this idea. Cud be used to have passive xp for other skills if I understood correctly
---
yes purely to dagonhai robes
---
From what i see majority of the mage gear that can be made by warding overlaps with many of the preexisting gear with some slight changes and only the few at the very end levels even compare with gear used now. I aint saying similar gear is a bad thing but this doesnt really bring something drastic enough to need a new skill imo
---
To be honest that's a big issue in the game. It used to not be a massive deal, but it's gotten a lot worse with bossing over time in OSRS.
---
Same !!
---
but im not talking about new servers lol.
---
You ever heard of ABAP?
---
indeed
---
Boo hoo people on the internet will call you a nerd for having a different opinion. Truly oppressed. W
---
thats a specious argument; you still have to put in the time to train the skill. even at 40 hours at its fastest, thats a fuckin work week.
---
also, the potential is all in the blog. all the new gear that has a chance to join the game on release is right there, not even including rewards from the minigame if that passes.
---
Why?
---
Congrats on the cats
---
Yeah the game should be tailored towards people who have played the game a lot longer than others. Why should people with way less game knowledge and experience with content be having an equal vote on future content
---
Except it’s clearly passing
---
I actually hope they do away with polling entirely.
---
Yes please. Or make it a chance for game to roll being a pure, zerkers, med or main builds
---
Bad thing exists that we didn't poll, therefore you should accept slightly less bad thing.
---
Poor logic.

---
Don’t let others make the decision for you, don’t let someone take your power to vote away from you. Vote yes or no for the skill and the potential skill content after doing the reading and decide for yourself.
---
Not a bad idea. Unfortunately just like the collection log it wouldn’t work for any pet obtained before the update.
---
Don't ignore my example. It should make it clear why someone would want to stop a skill they don't like coming into the game. It answers your questions, so don't ignore the answer to your questions.
---
Again, would you vote yes or no to a literal shit-eating skill? And if no, why not? There's your answer (if you say that you would vote yes to this, then we simply can't understand each other).
---
I'm not even against warding, by the way, I'm just pointing out how dumb it is to expect people to vote yes to a skill they don't like "because it doesn't affect them" (and by the way, a new skill will definitely affect pretty much everyone, so that premise is absurd too).
---
Holy moly what are you on about? Ring imbues are not OP, and they are extremely finite content. Herb boxes are definitely not OP. Also, you absolutely cannot afk for less than an hour to get an imbue, and you claiming that just shows you have no idea what you are talking about. Also, "challenging"? Its as about as engaging as 99% of runescape. This thread is literally about proposing a new BUYABLE skill to replace NMZ for imbues. You think a buyable skill is a more challenging way of getting an imbue than doing a point method at NMZ? You're insane.
---
Every other major melee combat training method is still very crowded even with NMZ existing. Thats just fact. I personally dont feel like this MMO would feel less "empty" if I get crashed 10x as often at ammonite crabs. Fuck that.
---
Because afk'ing bandits was hard before rofl
---
Nice ironman
---
There is at least one player who AFKed all of their combat stats in NMZ when you could do it for like 16 hours straight and that same player will vote no to warding because it is a "buyable."
---
It’s curious that I see more people bitching about neckbeards not voting, than the actual neckbeards. The only people I see voting no, give the reason why is they personally don’t think it looks like a good skill.
---
Im literally shaking when logging in

Zenyte necklaces ( anguish or torture) are really good upgrades and are BiS but 13m.  I would focus which ever one you use the most.  Besides that blessed boots are better than snakeskin and not that expensive if you get ancient or guthix and trading your ring in for a Beserker ring and archer ring would be better
---
I mean eternals are made from runecrafting/magic
---
Xericians under crafting. It would make sense if imbuing staves was to be done at runecrafting altars. Rs3 added magic armour creation under crafting and no one complained.
---
Haven’t seen a single good argument against warding.
---
Yes exactly. The game just doesn’t tell you these things, so you have to ask. The game literally says “Items you will lose upon death” and under it are your untradables, so what is one to logically conclude?
---
Re-read my previous comments.  You seem to have skimmed over them
---
found one!
---
It was harder yes.
---
As strange as his analogy is, it still stands. You don't have to try something to *know* if you will enjoy it or not.
---
All the HLC alts have that, mine included. That won't stop people voting yes/no on multiple accounts. If you actually want to limit that (can't stop it entirely) you'd have to limit it to one vote per hardware device.
---
It's probably not going to pass. I think it's going to be split about 50/50
---
Its very attentive in the context of alternative methods for the same skills.
---
Every other major melee combat training method is still very crowded even with NMZ existing because there are tradeoffs. Thats just fact. I personally dont feel like this MMO is less of an MMO because I don't get crashed 10x as often at ammonite crabs. Fuck that.
---
But why can we learn to runecraft but not learn how to make splitbark?
---
We have to bring the items to a wizard that has this unknown skill. LET HIM TEACH US THE WAYS OF WARDING PLS
---
In my clan chat today some dude kept saying how bad warding would be for the game but refused to give ONE legitimate reason as to why it's bad for the game. He just said shit like "they kept updating RS3 and those were bad" and " people aren't educated enough to know what's good for them" I shit you not he said that.
---
How about I don’t like it and don’t want it, find it uninteresting and I don’t think this game needs a new skill made up of already existing content that’s also a buyable .It’s opinion based of course same reason you do like it.
---
wait until they find out about alien chads
---
Nice post, better than the no posts “just because”
---
Yeah I figured as much. I don’t mind telling people, but at a certain point it becomes pretty mundane. :/
---
So more existing content moved into a new skill because? We make staves using magic and crafting. And that makes perfect sense lore wise. Just as making robes and infusing them with magic would also make sense.

I'll just try to respond to you in a single post even though I know there is little point in it, maybe someone reading will enjoy it or something.

Post 1: " It's not the idea that a no new content should be added, just that Jagex had the original player base in mind, and we all aren't ready for a new skill, because many, like me, haven't even had our first 99"
---
Alright you are saying they had the original player base in mind, that's a fine view point for you to have. Not all of the original player base is ready for a new skill, also clearly the case because you exist. The fact that you, and many others have not gained a 99 skill should not be a consideration for adding a new skill, they are not related. Also if you want a 99 go get it, I have already bought all of the supplies for 99 cooking and just need to go through with the cooking and I've been playing seriously for only a month and a half.
---
Post 2: "Okay well let's talk about Classic WoW... It's like "Hey guys, y'all want a new class and expansion???" Uh fuck no we're play Classic WoW for the soul pourpose of the nostalgia factor... We don't want a panda wrecking our raids because some idiots started with them as their main. Which is the reason our Content developers have a 75% poll rate for success so that things specifically like Warding wouldn't take away from the originality of the game "
---
Classic WoW has been around for all of a month I believe. In six years I would be surprised if no updates that people wanted were added to the original experience. In no way would a raid be wrecked because one of your allies in your raid group is a panda. Warding is an incredibly original idea still very much based in the design of runescape, but I can see how you would just see it as a boring unoriginal idea having played this game for so long. It's not boring to me, it fits in, there is a difference.
---
Post 3: " God wars was a success, many did not want it because they were not ready for it. The GE was passed, which took away much of the nostalgia from the original player base. A lot has been passed that original players did not want, so Warding is where we draw the line."
---
I'm sure the reasons people did not want God Wars was more varied than "we are not ready for it" but anyway. The GE is a massive amount of quality of life and I'm sure some people miss standing around saying you are trying to buy something for 14k so your friend can say they are selling it for 12k when it is only worth 500gp. Earlier you said the polls are there to stop the addition of world of warcraft expansions and now you are saying over 75% of the community has voted for things the community doesn't want? or just your idea of who the community should be?
---
Finally, Post 4: " Again. OSRS is for the original player base in mind. Warding will never pass. "
---
So, you seem to think that everything you want is what is best for the game. You seem to think that there is a grand group of people known as "original players" and the 75% pass vote be damned, the game should be made with only you and your imaginary friends in mind.
---
I don't think you care very much about this game at all, I think you just care about YOU, existing within the game. It doesn't sound very healthy.

Sells for 30m but it heals full lp

Thanks man perfect

1600 overall and haven't done it. Have a lot of quests waiting on heroes quest too...im damn lazy
---
Ah,  I have played this game before.  I should have socialized instead...
---
Ehhh. I switched to full time OSRS about a year and a half ago. The cosmetics... The constant barrage of mtx ads when you log in... I've played since 2006.... And it's just unplayable to me. I used to be a stout rs3 is the only osrs person for a while. But man. Games unrecognizable now.
---
I don’t really need the money, just want some KC and chance at pet and collection log.
---
There are plenty of other options that have the same result. Skill/noobiness has never been a factor in having high combats. If you want to tackle that as a whole, specifically targeting NMZ is ignorant.
---
Rename enchant spells to imbue. Then you can name the new skill Enchanting
---
feet pics too
---
I'm not saying it's a solution to all the main games shortcomings, far from it. But if you want efficiencyscape, Ironman mode is what you want. It is the solution to the feeling of disconnectedness the main game has, because the main game isn't *built* to feel connected. In the main game, you can ignore quests, bosses, skills, etc. If you grind enough money to do so. Then you can largely buy the skills that you skipped if you want to Max, or get them to the minimum requirements for the quests you want to do. In the base game you can skip the parts you do like, and buy it off when you get unlucky or bored, but it shatters the weave of quests and skill checkpoints that make the game feel like an RPG. In Ironman mode, you get that feeling like you are a part of the world, and all the skills and quests and bosses flow together, but if you hate a skill, or boss, either you tough it out till you have what you want, or you make the choice to go without. With how the game is inherently set up, you cannot have both.
---
Jmods aren't meant to design the entire skill and then pitch it. That would be a waste of resources. 
---
They've done enough so far to pitch it. People said the same things about sailing.
---
Ahrims isn't anything special and I look forward to them being kicked into touch and becoming a lot cheaper so that primarily, pkers can use them more often.
---
Doubt that would pass a poll.
---
Got a d axe and full set under 30 kills
---
Have some sort of interval where the winner for that period (maybe monthly) has their avatar next to the well? Like on the roof too agil courses, and maybe have a tracker on the examine text like "X has donated the most for 3 months"
---
Lmao guy just tries to help gets negative points this sub sometimes
---
a lot of the fun comes in with just progressing naturally and enjoying things you like. Personally i prefer bossing with friends and clan members which is why im not so big of a fan of more lackluster skills like wardin.
---
The main comment was saying the exact same thing bud. He was bleeding sarcasm.
---
I don't play alts, but go off king.
---
I think it would be fun to learn any new skill and find out new metas.
---
That price *cannot* be a coincidence.
---
Eventually all Bandos Boots will be gone driving the price up since they'll still be the cheapest for awhile and for instance if using up Bandos pieces is the only way to get the item then people will have to resort to using the other pieces once there isn't anymore boots on the market.

I love democracy.

I went afk at the ge once and this was in my inventory. I had never heard it before. I looked it up and saw what it was and then ran around trying to find who threw it at me. No luck. Lol got me a free gnomeball!

Invention was pretty fast if you just camped mobs with agro pots you just had to have money. A lot of the pvmers who got the most out of boss portal did though.
---
It was announced 2 years ago. That is a good portion of the game's life cycle.
---
The devs are not going to create you a fully fleshed out version to try out content, that would halt every update to the game. 
---
Warding contributes just as much as smithing to armor and crafting to ranged. 
---
Everything is already devalued with items from raids and raids 2. By that logic we shouldn't have the infernal cape because it devalues your fire cape. 
---
Sailing could still be implemented, but not at a rate where people refuse to add new skills. Your perspective is vapid and lazy.
---
reminds me more of summoning minus the usefulness tbh.
---
Cleaning herbs can actually profit I think depending on herb but it is very click intensive. You are most likely better off spending some time doing a money maker and then using the money to do herblore faster.
---
Lmao, imagine wishing someone would commit suicide cause you got mad about a shitty computer game. Get some help.
---
Fletching could also literally be crafting? Herblore is basically cooking? Fishing is basically mining.
---
Its RuneScape there isn’t much you can do, and yes it’s “magic” but so is runecrafting by your definition, I don’t understand your association, you are right it’s magic, but why is that an issue?
---
It’s a good way to balance magic armor and a good answer to adding in magic armor, sure you could put it in runecrafting but then there would be a ton of people complaining about it ruining the eco gains, you can’t win. It’s a good answer to what is needed in regards to magic armor, it’s just good game design.
---
Artisan is lazy. Warding has 41 pages of how it is interconnected. Sailing was dope
---
Love when people complain about not getting an item when they haven't even reached the drop rate kill count
---
He swole af Bro don't be a hater

Bruh, you gotta stop dipping.

Fuck him up though
---
You are correct, it got edgier not long after that time
---
Or it could be that there is more support for the skill than you think and the players you talk to just happen to be biased the other way. But the vocal support here is a bit surprising since it used to be vocal dislike before the recent revisions. I also wouldn't say it is a loud minority when it is the majority of the subreddit...
---
You want the devs to spend all their resources on content and not get it passed? You can't even think a layer deeper on how this game operates.
---
Crazy
---
I’ve just completed the ring at 120 kc
---
They kinda become buyable in a sense when you don't have to bank any of the resources to train with and can just drop everything. The production skills are being bought anyway.
---
Ohhhhhhhhhh
---
Thanks haha.
---
Titties speak louder than words
---
People might be praising the improvements that came with the latest patch but the game still isn't in the best of states especially for more hardcore players that are doing high level raiding or pvp.
---
Maybe it’s because I’m a sociopath(maybe?) but I’ve always really enjoyed the element of being able to be anyone I wanted to be in games.
---
I get to role play a paladin but irl, I’d have to play a rogue to get any kills.
---
/h /s pls don’t call the cops
---
I just hit max last week and I wouldn't mind warding.  It's just a buyable so won't take long.
---
Everyones left handed numbskull
---
Eh WDR is mostly fine minus some sweaties who think every random WDR standard should be sub 25 and that you’re literally retarded if you aren’t 4:1’ning like you didn’t join someone that’s a tier 2.

If it's not summoning im not voting yes
---
It helps when a discussion post has a discussion and not just a vague statement...
---
Q
---
No, there really doesn't have to be a reason, who cares if it affects him or not. He just doesn't want it, and that's fine.
---
I had converted before skyboxes...but skyboxes.
---
Going from OSRS being some tiles in a  empty black void, to the slight level of immersion skyboxes provide is gamechanging.
---
That's how skills work in this game or did you just realize this? Attack just let's you equip a better weapon. Defense just let's you wear a better armor. 
---
Imagine trying to change that? Because that's what you're advocating for. Don't like it, go play rs3 where they changed the combat.
---
Combat stats?
---
Dear god what the fuck
---
Try killing other players.
---
Cheaper than alch value? I doubt ahrim's is going to get cheaper than that.
---
That’s not why I said I was against it.
---
Except the pineapple pizza can now affect all the flavors of all the other pizzas, the price of them etc. Its not that simple as "oh just don't train warding if you don't like it xD" when warding can affect the rest of the game.

No, the point was that working on content and taking up developer resources so people like you who haven't even read the blog vote no is wasteful and harmful to the game. Imagine strawmanning someone's position when you don't have an argument.
---
what did you do go around counting heads or what
---
Saw at least 2 twitter users very explicitly claim warding would kill OSRS, which is what inspired me to make this. Spend 5 minutes on the OSRS twitter and you'll probably find more too.
---
cry about it?

Game is addicting when you achieve stuff, I still have much more fun chatting at ge or house parties..

We have historical context and external influence of new acquisition of Jagex to fight off mtx.

New skills have never been a negative on the actual game. Maybe dungeoneering had some valid criticism but it didn't spiral into more dungeoneering.

if you max you deserve to be shit on tbh

Do you ever think about the possibility that this genuinely influences the polls; in which case a single drawing of an OSRS waifu would have had significant impact on the game's development
---
controversial updates in osrs.... Ge, NMZ, BlowPipe, Revs, Ancestral, Zeah, F2P, Bonds, Zulrah as a whole, Ferocious gloves, Spirit shields, twisted bow, hiding poll results. If you want to use slippery slope it started with the first content added to the game which i believe was NMZ
---
It usually goes that way but there are a few things that make this a different case in my opinion.
---
1. This would be the first skill ever added to Old School and that’s a bit more serious an alteration than adding a new quest here or there. 
---
2. This conflict between people who want the game to modernize and people who want the game to remain in 2007 has been present for quite a while now and is bound to boil over eventually and
---
3. I know I said this a ton but there’s a viable alternative to OSRS coming out in a month.

Thanks for shitting on my achievement post

Give me an example of a negative impact warding will have on the game?
---
Yours was the deciding vote too, whatever will we do
---
N
---
or they just don't want a crap skill in the game that's not too hard to think there may be other reasons than only the assumptions alot have read it and still want to say no
---
That's what slippery slope means. You have no evidence of players leaving, rather you have numbers you can reference from previous skill releases throughout runescape history. People never quit because a new skill came out, people quit because eoc and mtx ruined the game. A new skill does not equal either of those things. We actually had a surge of players every time a new skill was released.
---
Why whip?
---
So you’re dressed like this?
---
If I may ask, what's your reason for voting no? It seems like something that'd be an innocuous QoL.
---
typing that over isn't going to make me vote yes i'll be voting no all the way
---
Emote pls facts
---
Voting xp waste
---
So when is NMZ gonna get removed, or at least imbuing rings there
---
Eh. Finding friends was easy for raiding with WDR and. I think that aspect of it would be easier in the current year. The skilling thing less so.
---
It's people trying to speak for everyone, which is always annoying.  
---
I've played since 2004 and I like the idea of Warding, and want a new skill in the game, would be fun.  
---
Shame it's a buyable but I don't really mind at the end of the day.
---
good representation of the kind of people voting yes ones who rarely play and have not much game knowledge and just want to get the next thing in for the sake of it without much thought
---
No warding
---
What balance are you referencing? Invention literally gave trash items value, quite the opposite of unbalanced.

Join the #VoteYes campaign on Discord, we're gonna get it passed:

When it was first announced it was 50/50 then it just seem this reddit has a very one sided voice although it doesn’t represent how everyone feels
---
This was on 309 on the 18/07/19
---
“Tl;dr” is not a very good argument.
---
All skills above 1
---
The leap from Black Dhide to Arma is tremendous. Unimaginably OP.
---
Oh yeah, Classic WoW releases in August. The games aren’t exactly the same but they appeal to the same audience, being MMO players who prefer a less streamlined experience. Not to mention a lot of people who played Runescape back in the day also played WoW.
---
I just dusted an entire unit
---
Vis isn't exclusively for magic armour though, and it is required for consumables, such as Elemental tome pages. Jagex are committed to improving the skill too, and I'm sure more consumables/vis sinks can be introduced if that becomes a problem.
---
That’s pretty much it hey, it’s not so much about the idea itself but more about who or how it’s presented to the people and once it gets traction it’s just constantly regurgitated.
---
People don’t even know why they like or dislike it other than they read comments that other people have said.
---
Ironically that pic was before emotes or skillcapes existed in RuneScape.
---
Rune craft
---
I love that this is a thing
---
We need to breath some fresh air into that sub
---
&gt;why would you vote yes for content you don’t plan to do yourself
---
I really dislike this argument. If it had been “why would you vote on content you don’t care about,” then sure. Fair. But there’s a lot of stuff that are good updates that I will likely never use personally. Like early game stuff, I vote yes for good ideas because it’s healthy for the game. I wasn’t around for it, but I would have voted yes for HCIM despite having no interest in playing one because I know that people want it and it’s a well thought out idea.
---
&gt; Like.. making ranged armor is the point of the skill but it also makes jewelry, and makes combat offhands, but not weapons! Oh and also helps fletching and making staves.
---
So crafting would lose its identity if we add everything warding does to it. And yet we still have smithing for generally melee things. I fail to see how your argument supports voting no to warding. Warding sounds like a fantastic addition to the game.
---
Apples and bananas are both fruit. If I have to choose between eating an apple pie or a banana cream pie then I would choose banana cream because banana cream pies are delicious. That said, Apple pie a la mode is incredible and putting ice cream on a banana cream pie is atrocious. But bananas make up for this by going great with ice cream as a banana split. Apples, however, make really good juice. Oranges make better juice but oranges don't make a good pie. Apples and bananas both equally work well with peanut butter, however, while oranges do not so oranges are undoubtedly inferior to both apples and bananas. Bananas are a superior fruit when consumed with breakfast though an apple a day keeps the doctor unemployed. Apples, however, are a key ingredient in apple sauce. You cannot use bananas to make applesauce. You could try to make banana sauce but then you would have no friends.
---
All in all, the apple is probably the winner in this fruit dispute. Next time, let's compare apples to strawberries.
---
So t doesn’t ruin anything
---
BedtimeBoost OP
---
Sailing got voted no on though
---
Lol clearly the pro warding group cares way more about this than me, as is evidenced by the amount of memes and posts about it.
---
I’m going off of what you said and I’m giving you examples blood magic because it’s a different combat magic book. And gun making as a skill example because that would be new and totally different than anything we have in the game currently.
---
Why do you feel like warding as a skill that is essentially magical crafting feel is unwanted or not needed as a skill, is it because it’s too close to crafting and smithing? But because it’s magic you don’t think it’s needed?
---
Why is better to have this skill? What does it offer?
---
One person posted it? Everyone must think the same
---
Well I guess I have to turn off my vpn before I vote now because obviously I’m not the only person to use it.
---
Yeah because maybe it’s doesn’t need a new skill
---
There is 41 pages of the blog that explain why

I just appreciate a good jerk-off joke.

not really.

Twitter is enormous. Are you kidding? Probably my favourite social media platform tbh

I hope they do rig it just to piss u off

You're whining about a "circlejerk" and "toxicity of this sub", and the other side is memeing
---
Tell me more about how you totally don't care friendo
---
Not to mention free mobile membership + bot created accounts.

Yeah but that’s not how it works. Smithing has an average of more than one unlock for every level, but other than a few things you may even use, it’s pretty lacking.

Because hes a filthy nasty subhuman weeb who can't go 2 minutes without bringing up something anime related

That’s a face on the door

Pmod status incoming for you
---
Mostly because the initial pitch for warding was considered to be mediocre to awful depending on who you asked. It has a lot of content a lot considered inappropriate for old school, battlewards in particular.
---
As far as more recently, the proposal has been refined a good deal and there seems to be more feedback being taken, which is why there is more of a "yes" opinion in general. Also a lot of the heartfelt criticism for warding is being drowned out by a lot of hyperbole, which explains people "hating" on those who say no.
---
Not sure about what streamer is saying what, this is just my take on it from someone who doesn't really care either way.
---
Probably a stretch but was that title meant to be a one shot 2 shot reference?
---
It's part of the timers tab, how did I not realize this hahahaha! Thanks for the reply
---
Holy shit, this has to be one of the worst discussions I've seen in a long time. 
---
Not only has u/hatesranged carefully explained to you how your "point" conveys the same message as the post and thus complaining about it ia hypocritical, but you also ridicule him for not understanding your point without you ever explaining it properly. 
---
Big tip: If somebody does not understand your ideas in a discussion, put them into words. If the only thing you have to say is: "hOw CaN yUo NoT sEe It?", then that doesn't mean you have a point, just that you're too dumb to put it into words.
---
And I know you'll think of me as one those idiots that doesn't understand you, but please, read back your comments, properly formulate your point, compare it to the post (which is about how there is too much complaining on this sub, just so we're on the same page) and say whether your point truly is different and you we're right or that you've been spouting nonsense all this time.
---
Did I hear bust down??
---
Yeah this is pretty much how every reddit goes. Like minded individuals just spew information and everyone takes it as fact and law. I constantly get downvoted on here for simply not agreeing with a lot of it.
---
“Big blog post have big words. Me not know big words.” - village idiots prior to voting “no” without reading the damn blogs. 
---
Seriously: if you read them and genuinely believe this skill isn’t for the game, I disagree but I respect your opinion. 
---
If you read nothing and you’re bandwagoning, your idiot ass is part of the problem.
---
I'm pretty sure this post is sad because people are spending money on bonds to vote multiple times in a poll.
---
Lmao I play both games ya twit, I've just played rs3 more recently
---
Alright. Damn, my tenure is all for nothing. Shucks. You got me too.
---
Just because people keep making memes about beckveards doesn’t make this skill any better.
---
I mean get that sweet sweet karma, but it doesn’t make the skill better.
---
People seem to be obsessed with something new for the sake of it being something new.
---
I am yet to see an decent argument for 'no' apart from 'no'.
---
The Thanos video was right all along.. Thanos did NOTHING wrong.
---
GE doesnt get rid of items, btw. And as others said what you say doesn't make sense. Sinks are not bad for the game. Especially when it keeps growing and growing. Therefor having "too many sinks" is not bad for the future where there are also more ways to get items and gold.
---
Any new skill relives this

I don’t like the word “Warding”.  That is all, I hope you guys have a fun and safe weekend.
---
Have fun with all of your accounts getting hacked. Rune lite doesn’t run RL+
---
Not true
---
Summoning was cancer.
---
Also I have a mid level osrs account that I enjoy playing on with the stats to vote so I should be able to, I shouldn't have to be a sweaty ass neckbeard playing 24/7 to vote for changes I think will be benificial to the game.
---
This, is firemaking actually necesary or fun after winterfodt and bullseye lanterns?
---
When I first played runescape way back in 2005-8 I was a little kid and wanted all the strongest things in the game. I looked at all the guides just so I could get to dragon gear. When I came back in 2016 I actually paid attention to the quests. The lore. The world. MUCH better experience.
---
And here I am being an austist and spending $10 on lunch every day and making like $250 a day at a real job and im too fucking stupid and stubborn to buy membership instead of grinding like 10 hours every 2 weeks to buy membership.
---
I may or may not be retarded and autistic/high functioning aspergers.
---
I feel like you can make those impacts though without a new skill
---
As soon as you're on a spot press and hold to get the menu up (before the spot moves). When the fishing spot moves, just tap on the menu and your guy will auto find it
---
There's a version of runescape where they added tons of new skills. Look how well that went.
---
I write with my claw..... I dont have hands thanks.. 🦀🦀
---
No, it wasn't but it was mainly for my discord members who have help me loads.
---
I've never had issue shuffling money around my mules, or loaning out to friends. 
---
Not that false bans dont happen but rwting in the guise of staking/giveaways is common enough. 
---
GL. Thread might be interesting. 
---
Also I want to point out your story has inconsistencies and a lot of it just comes off as really convenient for you. 
---
Like I said, might be interesting.
---
"Just thought it's a good time to clean the bowl, HUH?!"
---
🦀🦀🦀Repoll sailing 🦀🦀🦀
---
thats implying it has to be voted on which it doesn't. These death mechanics when put in were stated to be temporary. Its an integrity change for the health of the game. Both options cover their butts
---
Yeah I like the idea of changing the icon to a lantern
---
Weaving is already in crafting
---
So you restricted who could enter to a discord?
---
I think he asked nicely in GE and everyone waited their turn to give an answer
---
I voting yes regardless of anything. I liked the base idea of the skill and think something similar to dissolving is necessary for the future of the game.
---
Glories are 14k what the fuck are you doing lol
---
It will never return to what it was. 
---
It will however turn into like rs3 where you have to pay to get your items back.
---
Ah yes, keeping gp on your own level 3 mule, and then trading the level 3 "giveaway winners" uh48uy and xy68ang. 
---
Also, you said you were staking offstream - how did you run a giveaway for viewers if you weren't streaming?
---
Maybe 5 would be better? Would definitely make wilderness gwd more popular for key farming which I think is a good thing.
---
Riding what though? I seem to remember there being a joke during a quest about horses not existing in rs, so I doubt they'd ever add them.
---
Prossy with piety is wayyy better, especially with Slayer helm.
---
Honestly, I don't give a shit one way or the other, both sides are on an endless circlejerk without giving actual real facts as to whether or not the skill should be implemented. "OSRS ShOuLd oNlY bE lIkE iT wAs BaCk In tHe GoOd OlD dAyS!!!!!!!!!" Oh, okay, so Priff should never come out, we should nuke Zeah off the map, massacre all of Glough's gorilla abominations, seal off the Theatre of Blood, slaughter all of the new quest start NPCs so they can't give the quests. Yeah, no. Just... no. New content keeps the game from getting stale.
---
I think I used it all :(
---
Which inconsistencies are you referring to? Also, this is the first time I've had any issues but maybe it was because I was consistently trading 2b+ back and forth between the accounts but I'm not sure.
---
read the description clearly stated not not wanting the old death mechanics back just something please.
---
Hasn't this plug been out for long time? I remember pking in 2016 in a pure clan and some guy had a plug that would tell you where and how much players are risking
---
Terrorbird is shit using scrolls constantly. But b.o.b is too op and makes shit like prayer so much faster
---
Yes, but is it more elegant not to? Not really.
---
Warding serves its purpose well, and therefore has more value than shoving all of its related elements into Crafting, Runecrafting, Hunter, Smithing, and so on haphazardly and calling it an update.
---
Sailing looked fun. Raids is fun. Slayer is fun. Artisan looked fun. Quests are fun. Mini games are fun. Pvp is fun. Bossing is fun. Achieving goals is fun.
---
The list of not fun things is almost everything else. Gathering skills, production skills, agility prayer training. These are things we do in order to do the fun things, or to make the fun things more efficient. Warding looks like another dull skill.
---
Yours doesn't though
---
i mean terror bird just existing will kill staminas just due to the fact that the scrolls are one inventory space
---
Pray pots are expensive but they make the tasks go a lot faster, so you can do other things that make you money to offset it. In the time you save, you could do an herb run, making all the money back, for example. 70 prayer is also super important for bossing. Your stats are good enough to do some bosses, but not having piety will really hurt you. If you plan on doing any melee bosses, you should get 70 pray asap.
---
Obby legs are solid. If you find yourself running out of food at tasks that are far from a teleport, you might not want to use them there. Overall they will increase your dps, though.
---
My phone started doing this as well. Didn't change any power settings from the last time it was working
---
BoB and healing was cancer, the rest not.
---
Since I'm earlier than usual to a SC post, hopefully I'll get more visibility. 
---
SC was played long after it was no longer efficient and efficiency-scape had sent into Runescape 3. The thing that killed it was EoC, not efficieny-scape. Alongside many people not finding EoC fun in general, the game's meta completely changed. C5 dagging became staff maging (no runes necessary), melee and ranged were completely useless, so mage was the only combat style and every moment was just, "Will my dragonbreath (removes pray) hit?".
---
It finally died after the last Combined Cup which I believe was Late Fall 2016, so 4 years after EoC. (Although It's still played during spotlight, even with the removal of castle wars off comp).
---
This game was not solely played for Bonus exp like many people try to point out in many threads when SC is mentioned. No one playing in w45 (dedicated SC world) was playing for bxp or trying to be efficient, because obviously they'd use fast sc. We all wanted to have fun. 
---
At the time of EoC, there were 5 clans of 50+ people that were all just dedicated to playing regular stealing creation (Not even fast sc). SC Elites, Basedin2min, Something Domination, MHY's wack clan which I have no idea what it was called, l2sc from the w164er's, and even more clans that spawned for the combined cup like game  over. 
---
SC was even a motivator to get many people's stats up. Just so they could be better at the minigame. Clan-side SC (which died much earlier) even had an event where we would play like the old times 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2AOR-C243g
---
None of the people in this clip were playing it for the bonus experience. They were playing it for the love of the minigame. 
---
Please, bring back Stealing Creation.
---
My estimate was meant to try and extremely low ball the up front cost for one hour of training. A more reasonable estimate would be that the robes/hr would be around dhide making speed, so 1600/hr. Assuming mystic costs more than its alch price to make, that means you need to have more than 115m in gold just to buy the supplies for one hour of training. Even if you make only half the robes per hour, at 800/hr, you still need 57.5m, which is way more than the approximate 32m you need to do R2H smithing for one hour, which is post 99 and also profitable.
---
I'd be fine spending 10+gp/exp to get good exp rates for warding. I don't want to have to liquidate my bank to be able to train the skill for more than an hour. Also keep in mind that this is for mystic, a level 50 warding armor. So all the armors after it will most likely be even more of an up front cost. 
---
Honestly, I think that the skill would be easier to balance if mystic simply were not in the game, or not included in the skill. By having it, you force all the armors after it to have a higher alch value, or else the armor tiers make no sense. This makes the skill pretty much unapproachable for most people after level 50 due to insane start up costs.
---
Keep it up!  I'd love to read some more of these
---
Please stop posting things that are not going to happen.
---
Official dev statement about new mingames is "we would rather revitalize existing ones instead of bringing back SW, FOG, SC"  Developing new minigame is very time consuming and in result you get minigame dead on release if it does not provide BIS items.
---
Or you can just open minigames tab, choose shield or arrav, join official soa clan chat and find partner easily.
---
&gt; Genuine question, how does new content destroy a game?
---
Devil's advocate, with MAJOR hyperbolic theoretical situations: 
---
They add a new melee twisted bow, that everyone gets from an intermediate quest. They introduce new skilling content, but don't balance the experience rates so skills like RC or mining becomes full 15min afk with 1mil xp/h while giving good money. Add a new skill which tries to do what invention did to the rs3 economy, but didn't forsee something that in the end ends up causing hyperinflation/hyperdeflation. 
---
And things along those lines. All of which are of course not going to happen, but something that takes the game one step down one of those paths are not unheard of. And then another such update and we're another step down the path etc etc
---
No idea, I would imagine maybe level restricted worlds due to high requirements? Not sure.
---
I do agree with your comment here, warding would have a drastic impact on all of the factors you listed, this is not as cut and dry as "adding something to the menu" and should be looked at in a more holistic way.
---
All three of these were legit my favorite minigames of all of RS. Fist of Guthix has so much nostalgia of f2p days 10+ years ago for me. And stealing creation has so many good memories as well as frustration of being barraged to death lmao. If i could have just one of them to bring back i would choose Stealing creation for sure.
---
Exciting....
---
The rewards are exciting but the content looks like yet another chore
---
Also seems very suspect that you suddenly stopped streaming and THEN did all of your trades and giveaways. 
---
Sorry bro too many inconsistencies that all point to someone trying to make a quick buck
---
Cry
---
I have it, not all plugins are turned on by default
---
Voting no on all of my accounts.
---
I'd rather see the existing skills expanded and refined rather than more useless bloat added to the game.
---
Not true this is a better skill than artisan also dungeoneering is not a skill its a minigame summoning is broken without the highlights of the skill and sailing already has most of the proposed content into the game and a lot of current in game content would need to be reworked and locked and revoked to get sailing in
---
The difference is with the new skill that's currently being proposed has been a work in progress since what Runefest last year?
---
And yes it would be too much work. Especially for the current size team they have for OSRS.
---
 Jagex originally brought in help for the original HD update. And don't mention the OSHD client. They literally ripped assets from a private server which was already ripping assets from the original HD update.
---
why not?
---
I was gonna assume 2250
---
I dislike tomatoes. I don't like them in my food. I dislike their taste. Do they harm me? No, they don't. I simply don't like them. 
---
Warding can be the same. It's called an opinion. Someone's opinion doesn't become invalid just because **you** dislike their reason. 
---
So sit down and shut the fuck up, you crying, circle jerking little bitch.
---
It wasn't just for the streaming it was a giveaway I was doing a lot of the giveaways within my discord. I only traded the gold to the username they said to trade into which now that I think about it I realize that was a dumb idea.
---
Agreed. PvP deaths should be the only time other player's gear is lootable
---
It’s literally called black jacking in the plugins of RL+,  just above pick pocketing
---
There's an additional glitch that you're talking about though where you can walk off a fresh freeze totally independent of the timer.
---
That's what I'm saying, why add more of the shit stuff when there's sailing to be added.
---
It's like everyone has Stockholm syndrome at this point honestly
---
Reeeeeeeeeeposterrrr. 
---
Get some original content you karma whore.
---
What's bs then? A ban?
---
slay i full rune and say it's for the nostalgia-scape
---
Reeeeeeeposter. 
---
Damn karma whores.
---
The irony
---
I definitely support the idea of unlocking all your LMS cosmetics through wins + xp. With a lot of variations it would be fun to constantly grind LMS for the different rewards.
---
Reeeeeeeposterrrr
---
Damn karma whore.
---
I saw a bunch of people splashing on seagulls at port sarim. The bear behind varrock castle has always been a popular splash spot as well. Also saw someone safespot splashing an ardy knight at ardy bank, while like 10 other people pickpocketed. I really hope that becomes the new norm, cuz thats a win win for everyone.
---
Unpopular opinion: runecrafting is bad
---
Ye lol
---
I think instead of riding it would have to be some run speed buff. Either that or carpet riding.. but I think people will vote no into oblivion for something like mounts because it would fill the game in a way that would be very noticeably ‘not old school’
---
Ash mentioned considering bumping the 2200 worlds to 2250.
---
What new skill is in song of the elves ?
---
&gt; So how is that mindset different whether warding is in the game or not? You're making my arguments for me.
---
I don't like the implementation of doing things like making me have to train fishing up to 65 in order to get full agility experience in the Seers Village course. I think it's kind of ridiculous that it's set up this way and I would not have voted "Yes" in a poll. However, since the system is set up the way it is and since I love this game, I'm willing to put up with an implementation that I don't like. How is this making your argument for you? Are you saying that if I'm willing to put up with an implementation that I don't like, then I'm obligated to vote for more implementations that I do not like?
---
&gt; You are arguing against warding because you don't want to train it. That's literally what your whole shitpost is about.
---
How do you get from "I don't want to train this skill" to "Players shouldn't train skills"? Only by illiteracy. 
---
&gt; Not to mention if you read the actual 41 page blog post, you'd know that you can buy the skill. Which is not the same as grinding it out.
---
Yes it is. A buyable skill isn't just one that you deposit some GP and instantly have a 99 level skill. It's a skill like crafting where the amount of money that you're willing to invest radically reduces training time. 
---
&gt; Your logic involves getting items you want without actually doing any legwork. This is not the game for you bud.
---
You're illiteracy is getting out of control. I just told you that I have done these grinds and earned these items. This isn't even "logic", it's just something I did and an account of time-expense versus reward. 
---
&gt; Then why do you feel the need to go against new content that doesn't harm the game if you feel like it's not a major change?
---
Again, you misread the text you quoted. I said it wouldn't be a radical shift in the direction of the game, not that there wouldn't be downsides. What I said is that it's no such a radical departure from established game mechanics that we can't use existing game mechanics to make reasonable predictions about it.
---
more daily gp from battlestaves
---
Pros: refreshing content that actually fixes a lot of problems with the game. Cons: some don't like change
---
Im voting no on my 8 accounts too, fk warding
---
No? Where are you guys getting your info from lmfao
---
The colours are great but it will look very out of place vs the other capes....I think the newer items in game all have pastel hues vs the older ones?
---
A buyable skill means that it's a skill like Herblore, prayer, or crafting where the amount of money you put into it drastically affects your training time. It does not mean that there is a deposit button somewhere that just automatically raises you from 1 to 99 if you dump enough gold in there.
---
Posts like these literally don’t do anything but harm for your side, you know that, right? If you’re really on the fence about voting Y/N, why would you accept what the childish side says over the people having reasonable discussions?
---
Because its shit content
---
What virus are they referring to in that blog post from 2007? I played around that time, but don’t remember anything like that.
---
I never said I checked it myself, why would I? I don’t use it.
---
I’m simply pointing out that saying something is open source as an argument that it’s safe and won’t steal your information is not really a valid argument.
---
Someone could very easily just make a website for malicious software and claim it’s open source with the “source” code that omits the malicious parts, then offer downloadable binaries that have the malicious parts included.
---
You can use the same 2fa app for multiple accounts
---
Your wish is my command
---
Forgot we were also talking about people who are so bad they still somehow manage to die in singles with 350+ ranged defence total lol my bad
---
This has been a thing for years, it's just runelite plus now bringing it to more ppl
---
No he didnt but he implied that if you vote no, you have not read the blog...
---
I think you mean solo split
---
Its pretty situational. Like jus depending on what u plan on doing, i'd look up a guide on whatever u plan on doin that is combat related and the mage setup for it.
---
Most people who are up there to kill Revs and also anti pk are bringing a glory and a spec weapon which may or may not be a +1. From my experience at least.
---
It depends on what you're doing, but the most important pieces of magic equipment are an occult necklace, tormented bracelet and a trident of the seas/swamp
---
Then it's fine to vote what you believe in! I just thought this post would be funny :)
---
Looked like west ardy there for a sec
---
Unless they changed it in the most recent post, that's not true. I'm pretty sure they were keeping the 2k and 2.2k worlds, and then adding one more level above that.
---
Where did he imply that? 
---
He just said that he’s seeing a lot of posts from people who have clearly not read the blog.
---
Fuck reading it, I'm voting no just because I dont want new skill in osrs
---
*dont extend game harder to get max jagex stop no.*
---
I'm usually trying to be polite but your acting like a brainlet right now.
---
I hate pyramid plunder, but I do it because it's less tedious than spam clicking an NPC for hours and hours.
---
10/10 you'll fuck up there Mr skilled skillet/pvmer
---
I mean it just tells you what you can see with your eyes? It still doesn’t tell you his plus one or what not...lmao
---
Dude you’re the biggest RL+ advocate in this thread with a brand new account already posting in hacking subs.
---
Wouldn’t surprise me if you’re someone who would take over people’s accounts
---
Need I remind you that there are other things than warding that would have issues? Recall the farming guild/scythe incident?
---
Yes
---
This is a very valid reason.
---
My reasoning is bankstanding buyables aren't good design. Personally I'd be completely fine with all of it if it wasn't that. Definitely can see where the skillers nerds are coming from with it making magic stronger which makes slayer rates even more higher but idc about any of that.
---
Yeah firemaking is the most useless skill ever, imagine if we didn't have WT and we had to sit and burn 53K-100k+ logs clicking the tinderbox every time!
---
You're right. I completely forgot about that tbh.
---
A fully charged helm will last 15 hours of combat. I don’t know the mechanics tho.
---
The title
---
RuneLite isn't fully open source, RuneLite+ is.
---
Scrolling through new. Take an upvote. That's some funny shit.
---
Same
---
I think mystics will look good on you.
---
Lol
---
Fucking loved dungeoneering. It’s the only reason I ever play RS3. It has such simple yet fun progression and it’s easy to play with friends. I remember my friend and I always loved prestiging so we could race our personal bests on the small frozen dungeons. It helps that the rewards are interesting and the exp is really fast, but mostly it was just enjoyable to grind with a mate.
---
Nobody has been hacked for using Runelite+. Lots of people who use Runelite have been hacked, lots of people who use Osbuddy have been hacked.
---
Makeover mage
---
I am not speaking for all players who are maxed, I’m sure there are a shit ton who are for warding. I can only give my opinion while respecting others. If the outcome comes that more then 75% want the skill I will train it, just won’t enjoy it anymore then I have enjoyed training rc.
---
but why? I rarely play osrs and when I do I go stock, I'm not funding for a client I personally don't use.
---
No thanks I don’t get hooked on that easily
---
I've spent the better of 2 weeks training 92 individual accounts to the required voting level (plus an unnamed amount extra total levels, just in case of last minute changes to prevent this) - along with the 11 older accounts i already have possession of that meet the requirements and my main that puts me at a grand total of 104 accounts that i will use as an elaborate ruse to get whomever reads this mad about something that no one else besides 1% of the population will actually do. Thank you for your time.
---
... why? That is how the polls are designed. There is no rule about voting on 2 accounts if you pay for 2 memberships.
---
Grats, hoping for rc pet myself.
---
What about that implies that he’s talking about posts **against** warding? It just mentions posts (presumably) about warding- not specifying for or against.
---
You probably don't have 2fa lmao, and your password is probably used everywhere.
---
If you want an 3rd party clients to get banned keep supporting this... otherwise I would stop.
---
Join our discord awesome community and devs and users answer everything, though we will troll you sometimes!
---
Your art is legit amateur as fuck and I don't understand how this subreddit just eats it up. You should really take the advice about the lessons.
---
Here's a very quick little edit I made ;)
---
https://i.imgur.com/ibuqjHC.jpg
---
Fuck wrong comment
---
I defnitely don't think its inconsistent with the game at all, if anything i think its actually inconsistent with itself. If it wanted to be a catch all "all magical equipment requires warding" fine, but it doesn't. It just wants robes to be included. 
---
My argument was more that the identity of the skill isn't unique feeling enough to warrant being an entirely new skill. Just like i wouldn't want "weapon crafting" or similar to be an offbranch of an existing skill.
---
People's defense of this is often "well skills already exist that suffer from this, look at firemaking or fletching!". And i agree, but they also introduced something entirely new to the game. Firemaking = a portable way to cook food, and fletching was the only way to create ammunition, previously it was just a shop (this one is closer to warding). Warding aims to make robes and imbues, both available from shops, and robes are already planted within the crafting identity and skill itself.
---
What do you mean they won't be able to do anything? Lmao
---
They can just pull out the ban hammer whenever they wish.
---
Man if I was you honestly and had nothing on my computer worth keeping i would just do a hard reset and wipe it clean or system restore it to a time when RuneScape was working. Other than that I’m out of options my man maybe try twitter to contact a mod or the community on there for support maybe someone had the same issue before you.
---
it uses appx. 0.14scales per tick you are in combat
---
Feel free to vote what you want. I did this to mainly spark debate rather than attacking each side like all the other posts seem to do
---
This shit is throwing runelites name in the dirt and is going to end up ruining 3rd party clients for everyone. This is why we can't have nice things.. rip ahk
---
It's a satire account
---
Fucking lol.
---
Made a LOT changes since the last one. The main thing is the removal of battle wards which were seriously op and didn't belong in the game at all
---
Thanks for the help!
---
I can't restore my computer though because I have a lot of important shit from my University and I can't back up everything ://
---
Also this doesn't work on my other computer! Forgot to mention.
---
As some one on my way to untrimmed farming I had this fear cross my mind that combats could easily ruin it. 
---
F
---
I see your discussing and engaging really well!
---
Somehow stumbled across you again by coincidence
---
I want Warding, but can we slow down the circlejerk a little bit?
---
Not everybody who votes no is a sad little neckbeard. Reddit is acting almost exactly like Twitter except in the other direction.
---
    
---
Now it's a different story when we talk about people that say things like  
---
"I don't want Warding therefore the entire community doesn't want it so just don't even poll it Jagex". (Translation: "Shit this might actually pass let's try to bully the jmods into not polling it")  
---
Or 
---
"Hah because of you wanting me to vote yes I'll vote no on my 389 alts" (Translation: "My vote hasn't changed at all but I want others to feel bad for saying they want something I don't want")
---
It's the pkers voting no to anything non pvp as a retaliation to pvpers shitty attitudes to pvp updates
---
You know when you said you get redirected with the no internet sign have you tried to google any other website like YouTube just in case it’s something like your internet? Sounds dumb I know but last idea lol
---
what if osrs secretly only logs one vote pr ip
---
The people streaming it were streaming the Beta
---
Wines are very cheap and heal 11, but if money isn’t a problem sara brews are best
---
RemindMe! 3 days
---
&gt; Sure, the silks may be useful in some regard, but at the end of the day its the Vis that grants them their magical boosting capabilities, nothing else.
---
Then can't we call it something related to Vis? Viswork, Viscrafting, Vis channelling
---
How is Vis different to the runic energy present in the entire game?
---
&gt;I'd honestly take Enchant Level 1-7 and push it into Warding if I could, it makes far more sense there than on the Magic Spell list
---
Same here, just name the skill Enchanting.
---
...
---
But **does OSRS need that.** Yes, it'd make sense. Sure, it'd have fitted if you went back in time. **But is this the thing that we want to change OSRS forever with.**
---
Every other site works perfectly, I can even open league of legends haha

The concept is the same as crafting and smithing. Except in warding you create magical armour instead. This in turn is going to bring more diversity into range armours as you only really have salad robes &gt; mystics &gt; infinity &gt; ahrim's &gt; ancestral which are all (bar salad robes) gained from either monster drops or buying them from a store currently
---
Can't have a internet debate without the moralfag calling us unreasonable for arguing about a hobby most of us clocked hundreds of hours into, can't we?
---
How dare we having a strong opinion on something.
---
Ok ty
---
Lol that’s so strange! Have you ever had RuneScape downloaded before like recently?
---
Dude, it's not.
---
up?
---
45 base melee stats
---
I use brews. Super cheap nowadays
---
BuT cHanGiNg sKiLLs iSnT oLdScHooL
---
I changed ISP's like recently, I don't think that should be a problem but I'll call the fuckers and ask them
---
I mean it's not exactly wrong is it?
---
Holy repost, Batman. Use dark mode too.
---
One person, one vote.
---
The same person who put throwing knives on the giants that drop defenders. Waiting for that black defender like cmon it’s been ages, oh snap I got... oh nvm
---
For me, filling in the disparate gap in magic gear relative to melee/ranged is a good path to take for the future of the game as a whole.
---
Maybe call them up. If not here is a link to one dude on reddit who had a fix apparently good luck my man take care. 
---
https://amp.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/2bzw0e/having_trouble_loading_the_game_here_is_a_simple/
---
No actual reason to justify voting no, next.
---
They can't detect who is using it and who isn't is the thing. Most of the plugins are completely undetectable as well.
---
Its spot on
---
Unfortunately if warding doesn't pass, we probably won't ever get a new skill. Including a redesign of both artisan and sailing that lots of people want.
---
People have different opinions, next.
---
Just to show off really and the aesthetics it looks good. Especially hard to get ones like untrimmed slayer runecrafting farming etc
---
your choice is warding or RC and you're planning to vote? you psycho
---
Thank you for your correct observation.
---
Then you are the one to blame when OSRS dies in 2 years. Enjoy hun
---
You're trying to dictate what criteria people can use to decide on your vote. That's just as bad as telling them what to vote.
---
&gt; stopped streaming because I was tired and had work soon
---
&gt; Few hours later I was forcibly logged out
---
You contradicted your own story in 2 sentences. Yikes.
---
Convoluted skill that easily could have been introduced as a new elvish crafting method using RC and magic, we don't need another skill
---
no, but 3 jads is super easy and it comes naturaly on the first try if you do slayer tasks for jad, jump from 1 jad to 3 isnt that big really.
---
I’m coming around to this view. Where’s the adventure? Why aren’t people required to leave the bank from time to time?
---
That said, I don’t think it invalidates voting yes. If you don’t like the skill, don’t train it. Vote yes so other people can enjoy it, and to help expand the community. 
---
I’m still not a confirmed yes though.
---
Good to know ty
---
This sounds like something is blocking runescape thru your internet. It would explain that you can't get to the website, and runelite can't download cause it can't reach jagex servers thru your internet.
---
Yes it kinda is
---
If it passes, you don't get to not have warding/pineapple pizza in your order/game just because you voted no. Yiu get it in your order whether you like it or not.
---
True, the ISP guy mentioned something about a DNS server which I didn't understand how it's related. Are you familiar with that by any chance?
---
No idea time but it must be according to juggleflox's time right?  
---
Is it already Friday the 19th in UK?
---
it takes 15 minutes to play an alt to where it needs to be to complete soa. I should know.
---
How is warding 'forced'? I see that critique a lot but I'm not sure what it's supposed to mean. It's 'generic' because this is Old-School RuneScape, so they want to make a skill that feels old-school in nature but not outdated in design. 
---
Sailing failed because it was more akin to a mini-game than a skill. Some jmod recently commented that he would be down to revisit sailing but believes it would be best implemented as a mini-game not as a skill.
---
Unfortunately people used the same scare tactic with sailing poll.
---
Celtic explained it pretty well, they can't see which client you're using and if they could you could pretty easily make it look like another one.  If everything is external and not calling menu actions etc, they have no way of telling that you're using it.
---
One or two brews, Redemption and PoH pool between rounds does it for me.
---
Few hours later was about 7 or 8 hours later but yeah as I said I couldn't sleep.
---
A bank standing skill won't change that, the only thing able to kill it will be mtx
---
I will too
---
no, they didnt have to remove free trade or wildy. it was just a bandaid as they were pressured into doing something quick. yet it took them years to bring all of it back.
---
Then they'll have to ban all 3rd party clients.
---
We’ve already rejected Sailing and Artisan, right? Yeah, I reckon if we say no to this then they’re done with pushing a new skill. 
---
Although if it passes, they’ll probably not propose anymore either. 
---
I definitely see it as Warding or nothing at this point.
---
What's interesting to me is you're stating that Google is claiming oldschool.runescape.com is not secure but it's https so something else is communicating with your browsers.
---
So here's a few things for you to check.
---
- Windows Firewall (make sure all clients and websites are added to any exception lists)
---
- Check any anti-virus settings and their firewalls (I would completely turn these off to see if that fixes the issue)
---
- Login in to your router and do a hard reset (factory reset)
---
That's why supporting RL+ is important, it stops people from selling these plugins/clients for hundreds of dollars and usually scamming/hacking their users and eventually might force Jagex to actually take a stance on this shit. The fact that you can autoswitch/use spells/swap prayers etc with hotkeys and not get banned is pretty damn ridiculous.
---
This is some China-tier shilling right here
---
Love this 👍🏼
---
The thrill of crafting at a bank but having a different animation play! Woooooo
---
better than imbeciles voting yes to everything because they think it annoys anyone who would vote no to anything
---
Ironmen can’t buy their way through a skill.
---
OSRS is declining why do you think Jagex is trying so hard to add a new skill? You're ignorant, use your brain
---
S U H D U D E
---
Lol thats a dumb argument, magic is such a varied skill, you can contact NPCs, check farming patches, make planks, teleport to everywhere and craft/enchant shit. Saying it's a 'combat skill' and disregarding all the rest is absurd. You're purposefully misrepresenting the usefulness of magic and how warding could just be a new spellbook integrated with smithing/crafting.
---
I'm currently in the phase of trying to get some tp jewelery on my HCIM. How is it done usually? Just mine the ore, smelt it, enchant it? Or some other source? Especially games and duel rings would be great
---
If I'm on a f2p world, does my agility level affect my run restore rate at all?
---
Forgot we were talking about maxed accounts who need a 4 man group to kill a guy who cant fight back lmao.
---
tbh all the people who hunt me at black chins are pure trash, calling me a retard and shit while not being able to kill me with 4 pairs of claws and toxic staff. You're probably one of em.
---
&gt;They can't detect who is using it and who isn't is the thing. Most of the plugins are completely undetectable as well.
---
I assure you they can tell what client you're using to connect to the game. They could then just blacklist RL+ and auto ban anyone who connects to the game using it
---
It may be that something in your internet has blocked jagex' IP, try doing hard reset to your modem/router. Just press the reset button for 10 secs when it's on, or go thru your internet to the modem/router options and do it through there. Also you can see blocked IP's thru the options.
---
Iirc you need to open command prompt, type: ipconfig, and then look at the local ip, that's something like 192.168.x.x and type it to your browser bar.
---
It'll be later this afternoon (UK time)
---
What happened ??
---
The best solution which I have no idea why it hasn't been done yet is paying Adam, Lotto, etc from RL to implement some of the more core features into the official client and taking a firm stance on 3rd party client usage. People will be able to play just fine without 30 overlays on their screen telling them exactly where to stand, fish, etc. Of course some people are going to continue using these clients but the majority of people don't know how to or care enough to do more than click a download button to use them.
---
When will the warding poll go live?
---
So Warding is a new MTX skill where every cent I spend on Subway equals to 25 Warding XP? Neat!
---
Does no one actually look at this sub before posting???

Another issue is skills like Blacksmithing being virtually useless for their intended purpose(provide players with useful armour and gear).
---
As well as stealing plugins from other runelite forks and copywriting it as their own.
---
The poll will close on Wednesday 24th
---
What the fuck did you just say to me
---
you believe anything a jmod says? you know back then they promised they wouldn't ever bring micro transactions either
---
SC was very cool. SW was pure shit after a while
---
Just make an alt lmao
---
it does look to be more like divination/invention if you read about it
---
You play RS3 so you obviously don't have good taste in video games, which means whatever way you vote will probably end up being bad for our game. That being said you are fully allowed to vote. You're just an asshole for doing so.
---
Imagine if I came over to RS3 and voted on one of your polls ohwaityoudon'tpollcontentonyourgamebecauseit'salltrash
---
Mostly what u/trylim said. Transportation is really useful. I’d add the ectophial to that list, and Ava’s is almost vital for ranged play.
---
thats the best jagex has to offer these days
---
but... they didn't. 
---
like i said, it was only a bandaid, and it didnt have to go on for 2 whole years. 
---
if they took proper care of the game in the first place, bots and rwt would not be a big problem. they spent 2 years doing what they should have done 4-5 years back.
---
You realise RL+ is going to cause the death of 3rd party clients.
---
h
---
you are trying to get a voter by an icon change lol
---
What you described is exactly how it works in rs3. You spawn at death. Ur shit is in a chest and cost a % of what you were wearing to get it back. It forced me to take learning new bosses seriously.
---
Did not see that.:(
---
Just saying that runelite+ is not allowed will make 90% of the ppl using it stop using it. (When they banned ahk for movements nobody really believed that they can see the difference between a wmk jump and a ahk jump and ppl still switched over to wmk for the jumps just to be save)
---
Or no thanks to them for putting so much effort in this while it was obvious most people didn't want it in the game.
---
"Would you rather fewer people cheat and some that do get hacked"
---
Uuuhhm yes? what a fucking dumb argument
---
If you own the client, why does this answer give me unprofessional vibes. That doesn't make me trust you and download it.
---
Vote is tomorrow I belive. Regardless, the voting hasn't started
---
Yeah when I splash I always do it at Ardy to let some thieving training get done with it. You get some tips and some people will even toss you a bond if you’re splashing for eight hours or more.
---
I disagree. It's like how company shares work, the person who inputs the most capital has the largest say.
---
I thought this comment was really funny idk why you’ve got the downvotes
---
Anything not profit snake, money dragon, or raids is pretty shit compared to them
---
no.
---
They're going to have to spend hundreds, maybe thousands of man-hours before it's even in a working format so they can't Beta test it.
---
Im 60 kc in in and i never saw an item
---
Vote for a skill you dont agree with because in the future it "might" be better
---
and they still haven't fixed many simple graphical issues like weeing through items when worn etc and they wana add a new skill are they giving us a sign of suiciding the game or something
---
I haven't seen anyone report being hacked while using it tbh, do you have a link to some reddit threads or something? Must have missed them myself

Except it clearly did. I don't even know how you could argue that the removals aren't the main cause of the original runescape's decline.
---
Having around 20k kc of skulled/unskulled as a solo player....I can say that if you’re a solo player, it’s only worth doing skulled revs off-peak with chainmace OR rcb. If not you’re better off just using craws and bulwark, unskulled. The attention you attract while skulled is very disruptive to your trips and unless you have agility/can tank well/hit the lucky jackpot, the difference won’t be VERY big. Worse still if you’re skulled and using suboptimal gear like MSB, all your kills will be sniped by BPs and craws that you leave with almost nothing lol.
---
RL plugins are reviewed by the main RL guys before they are implemented while nobody knows if the main guys of RL+ are about making a client or getting gp.
---
At first I didn't read past the snakeskin drop and was about to call you out for being a monster, but this is just sad
---
you clearly have no clue and i'll be voting no
---
There’s two settings. One for WASD camera and another for having to hit enter before typing. With both active theres WASD spam in your chat unless you hit enter first!
---
Just don’t feed it after midnight.
---
ofcourse you will be voting yes as a rs3 player, this skill is a mix of divination and invention and if it passes, it will bring so many more rs3 features to osrs like squeal of fortune. Which is the reason why u play rs3
---
Mine is fine.
---
I dislike tomatoes. I don't like them in my food. I dislike their taste. Do they harm me? No, they don't. I simply don't like them. Ergo, my opinion of tomatoes is that they're gross.
---
Warding can be the same. It's called an opinion. Someone's opinion doesn't become invalid just because **you** think it is wrong.
---
lol ye the noobs are bad they can't get total lvls without a new skill
---
Oh no a bunch of cheaters will quit, no one gives a shit
---
im 200 levels from being maxed I don't mind a new skill either.
---
Vote based on whether you want a new skill, not on what reddit says.  Reddit will always complain about everyone and everything and the sooner you stop listening to it the better. (Yes I know this post is ironic)
---
How is that not a valid complaint about Warding?
---
Why is there a sudden demand for beta testing before polling with regards to warding despite that never happening with any new update before. It's never happened with new bosses or quests, so why does it matter all of a sudden to beta test warding?
---
Additionally, there is a bigger reason why this won't happen. Jagex aren't going to sink a lot of dev time into developing content that might not be added to the game due to the possibility of it failing a poll.
---
Thankyou!
---
Lmao arguing with an obvious troll. Do you not value your time?
---
There is no value in a Google account. Now that you've made me think about it, the top two uses seem to be commenting on Youtube and Gmail.
---
When you watch a Youtube video, others will have already seen the video and made your comment ahead of you. This makes commenting pointless. 
---
Gmail is yet another email provider. There are many of them. I had email accounts before Gmail was made public. 
---
If you can help me see value in a Google account, please do. I would like to be proven wrong.
---
We don’t really know if the main RL guys are about getting gp either, we just trust them because so far they’ve acted in good faith. 
---
Given that the stated goal of RL+ is to remove the market for paid third party clients/plugins and scams, there’s no reason they couldn’t attain the same level of trust. 
---
Saying this I won’t use RL+, but that’s just because I feel like the plugins go too far and I’m happy with RL, not because I think they’re going to hack me.
---
yeah nice...
---
in the future....
---
warding is like crafting. no matter how much shit they will add, in the end you will just stand in ge and click away.
---
Even if that is true, it doesn't matter. In the end, JaGeX has to care about their bottom line as a company. There's no way they'll ban something used by more than 50% of playerbase at this point.
---
RuneLite basically acts as a 3rd party extension adding free value to their product. You might even say it directly increases their stock prices.
---
I'm not really sure what my goals are, I just know that I like to make gp. Maybe get my first 99? Have any suggestions?
---
Can someone plese explain "warding" for me.. I haven't played runescape for years and im here only for the memes.
---
I would rather have consistency and game mechanics which cannot be abused. If they see ardy knights as a problem why is splashing ok? Why was NMZ afk methods too op? They were also low xp per hour methods. 
---
There shouldn't be anything in the game that allows you to get xp for hours straight without having to interact once.
---
If all he cares about is not having a new skill that does mage armor, he doesn't need to waste his time reading the blog.
---
Its very aesthetically pleasing for some reason...
---
i feel like in this scenario it’s gonna be people no voting to piss off all the people who are already raging about it on reddit before the poll is even out
---
How soon do you get muted/banned after being reported for offensive language?
---
Can anyone with experience tell me please?
---
Because it gives my nooby friends and my low level iron account ways to get magic armor without it being ‘lul go do slayer/GE’
---
Firemaking is literally only useful for making fires and yet it’s a beloved skill
---
Youre probably still not 99 mining, so im gonna have to doubt on your experience with this game
---
middle mouse button.
---
Who uses was in 2019 like seriously?
---
\&gt;dont understand how warding will ruin the game.  
---
Because it won't. It enhances the game as a whole.
---
Why is bowsette wearing rs hear thoughh
---
Almost 14mil xp.

Yep. Got em at like 90kc too I think.
---
I love the idea of a stealing creation type game but not stealing creation. 
---
A game mode where two teams are released onto a map and are divided by a barrier. You are given a set time to gather resources, create weapons and build up a base. Then the barrier is lowered and both the teams fight to the death
---
Skills are the core of the game. They are non-optional content, excluding the situation where players actively choose to gimp their account for novelty or pking purposes.
---
You're obviously ok with scams where it's the victim's fault.
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand, thats how you get a NO from me...
---
So op should quit the game for a couple years until Jagex finally decide to give a new skill idea a try?
---
&lt;3
---
Because jagex's bot detection is horribly outdated and can only detect f2p mining/fishing/wc bots.
---
Take a look in p2p mining guild, nature alter, skeletal wyverns, Zulrah, farming patches... some which require a more complicated script for botting. But then requires a more complicated detection methods which Jagex lacks.
---
And you're not torvesta, not a chance you're gonna get a fat stack from a clue hunter
---
Not even funny
---
That’s incredibly selfish and dumb
---
Gielinor isnt europe in the 2020 you know
---
Democracy isnt inherently good. And most countries have representative democracy, not direct democracy.
---
Real cons: 
---
1)It's just another crafting/smithing skill. 
---
2)When you read people saying it's good for the economy, that translates to people who can hoard armours that can be disassembled will get to 99 quickly and painlessly. If you have just started out, well, you're fucked, no more cheap armours you could use to level up your slayer/magic or w/e cos everything is gonna cos a butt load of cash.
---
I get that this community is desperate for a skill to pass a poll, and it's only on this premise that I might consider voting for warding, however, I would take a sailing skill over warding any day.
---
Good way to bring on disease damage
---
I’m still undecided on this issue. Can you explain why “no warding”?
---
I love potatoes. Sweet potatoes.
---
It was my introduction to social networking engineering. Fuckin good times.
---
I’m still undecided on this issue. Can you explain why to vote no on warding?
---
Ive been trying the fight caves and getting wrecked by jads healers. I haven’t been using sounds so the best methods for me would be to line the healers up or run through Jad. Does anyone have a video or advice for those methods? Everything I find used sounds to safe spot but I’ve been reliant on animations so I’d prefer to not change my strategy for prayer switches.
---
i like the way you think
---
What did Hitler vote on Warding?
---
im gonna laugh my way to the bank when it doesn't pass, there's your reason
---
If I'm reading this right and you're suggesting people just ignore the skill if they don't like it, that's completely unreasonable, tbh.
---
It's dishonest to feign ignorance about how everything is tied together in runscape. There will be things that must be done if you want to reasonably progress your account. There will eventually be a quest with a warding requirement for instance. It'll have an effect on the economy as well.
---
This guy clearly has no idea how Wall Street makes its money. If this guy was a mod he would remove free trade all over again
---
Read the post - it has some good parts that I like. However, due to the past horrible experiences of Jagex adding new content I can't trust them. Sadly voting no.
---
The only overlays ill want to keep are for agility
---
it’s a start to an item sink though, something that this game will inevitably need
---
Let's be real.
---
Warding isn't going to pass, and it's because the 75% rule is BS
---
Is it? I know that you need to send an action to the game server to keep from hitting the 20 min afk timer, yet a right click on an NPC is not counted against this timer. Meaning I believe its a client side action.
---
It's a fucking joke? You can still be mature and have fun? It's not illegal?
---
Why would your mother name you hcimimn0rth
---
thats online (and tbh even irl, see us elections) strategy to win people over. Being right is nice and all but propaganda, clickbait, celebrities, ad hominems and ''gotcha'' moments in debates is what wins peoples votes
---
Seems fine to me,  just gathering some info, nothing wrong with that.
---
...osrs was locked behind membership before bonds were a thing. Maybe no talk about shit you know nothing about.
---
It's not just this sub that's like that, it's in fact everyone on earth
---
Veracs Skirt us nice armor with bonus prayer, torags is a cheap tank armor (chest legs and could go with helmet) same as Karils chest and legs to tank magehits.
---
Ahrims is good when you wanna mage zulrah and such.
---
Full dharoks to afk nmz or kill giant mole although its geberally better at a max hp of 93 I veliece. Full Ceracs if you wanna kill lots of KQ, Vet'ion or Callisto.
---
Id go for my first paragraph for a starter though
---
Having fun at the expense of others is indeed not be mature.
---
What did he do?
---
There is a difference between having a strong opinion and actively attacking and making fun of the other side. People don’t like the attacking part that seems to be every post on here.
---
I mean, herblore is the same, you pay a guy to make you unfinished potions, just not directly. And construction is the same, but you pay bots, unless you use mahogany planks. At least essence runners are legitimate players.
---
96-99 is a fair bit of xp and can easily be boosted with a garden pie if you want to utilise all of the spirit trees.
---
That is literally how we ended up with RS3.  The fact that you just suggested they remove polling from OSRS and force major updates in an authoritarian fashion, and then mocked the person who said that's how we end up with RS3, and then *got upvoted for it,* really doesn't speak well for the state of this community.
---
Back in the day i just created another account to do it with me, i had 2 sisters who played at the time and we were all black arm gang lol
---
No reason to vote yes
---
Well you don’t need agility but it will give you another option to enter the middle area. Since you’re low in def and hp, getting in as quickly as possible is your priority.   Chances are you’ll be right next to a rock to mine or hole to squeeze into. 
---
You can train on say cows until your lvl 30 in ranged and then whatever you’d like to 40. Then you could at least wear some green dhide. 
---
For time, Id guess a few hours since you’ll be hitting low at first. But the levels will fly compared to rc haha.
---
You lack the most basic logical skills.
---
Dragon axe is like 1/10k from Winterthot
---
But the skills we already have are all components of survival.  Fishing, Woodcutting, Firemaking, Cooking, etc.
---
But what was also mentioned is having it be a totally different interface, so it wont load the items in the secong interface until you click on it, and the items in the fisrt interface will relieved from the system. Making it possiple to do with the current engine limitations. If we compared it to a internet browser, it will be like opening a new window instead of opening another tab.
---
I got it at 30 kc

The greatest joy playing RS as a kid was this. Not knowing fuck all, and enjoying the shit out of discovering things on your own. I remember the first time I decided to go explore the world, as I left Lumbridge toward Draynor and Falador. It was an exciting journey, and quite scary as well at that age (looking at you, Draynor Manor).

Its funny how the reference is of others, but it’s actually subtly covering the fact HE’S the one duped.

I enjoy runecrafting...

Lolll

I love when people try to gain my trust by giving me their items and I just leave afterwards.

will kill merching so no thanks

Running tally for arguments *for* warding: 0
---
Woooo
---
Wow that’s the most selfish thing I’ve seen on this sub
---
That’s because that’s what you’ll make it. You’ll simply buy everything off the exchange and stand in a bank. To each their own, but just because *you* choose to make it a bankstanding skill doesn’t mean everyone has to. You’ll choose to bankstand for efficiency and that’s your own fault.

You could play mobile while on your way to his place so your IP is gradually moving towards his :thinking:
---
Karils top and bottom if you need magic defense somewhere, like Thermy or Kraken
---
Verac's skirt is good defense and prayer. Torag legs are cheap and good def.
---
Veracs, Guthans, and Dharoks sets all have uses. Verac's mostly for wildy bosses, Dharoks for some bosses and training, Guthans for healing.
---
Fuck RL+.
---
There will be a beta world where you can test the skill and give feedback. 
---
Of course they can scrap betas. But they don't want spend time developing something that might not pass.
---
&gt; Main reason I support it is because it's pretty much the only way Jagex will actually crack down on 3rd party clients. Imagine if you could see Runelite in 2013, people would freak the fuck out trying to get that shit stopped. The fact that there are people who can't even play the game without 100 plugins holding their hands is sad as fuck tbh.
---
The RL client is the equivalent to addons in other MMO's. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Imagine an MMO in 2019 that requires you to use its rigid UI with 0 customization.
---
Good morals and making pligins like 1 click blackjacking? Lmfao dude get out of here.
---
All these plug ins are going to force Jagex to do something about them. Some of these plug ins basically play the game for the player
---
Are you illiterate?
---
Definitely op but that should be no surprise, the whole point of that plus is to have all the giga busted plugins runelite had to remove, it's an *actual* cheat client.
---
Yea, i know what invention has done for RS3. But i'm just not sure how extensive the dissolving will be in OSRS. Will it be possible to dismantle items like barrows and bandos? If you can then will there be real benefits to doing so?
---
Yeah, that’s true ;)
---
&gt;t be
---
Hey mod steven I sent the report to a lawcontact jagex but I will send you the in game info. I haven't seen him on in the past few days so it worrisome.
---
You could buy some barrows legs like torags/dharoks for more defence bonus. Other than that barrows year is more situational based on particular things you might be doing.
---
ENDLES IKEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
'Warding' is not a skill, it's a generic word they had to use as an alternative to 'enchanting' or 'crafting' because those things are already in the game;
---
It's another 13 million XP bankstanding buyable skill;
---
It's a shoddy way to fix the issue with mage robe progression.
---
I really think that first point shouldn't be understated.  It isn't meaningful, in a word.  Even the icon is vague -- just some strange portal.  You can say you're a master of 'Strength' or 'Firemaking', a master of 'Agility' or 'Thieving', even 'Slayer'.  But a master of 'warding'?  It carries no meaning whatsoever unless you already know the intricacies of this specific skill in OSRS.  The word 'warding' doesn't suggest what you've actually mastered at all.  It's basically an arbitrary word slapped on a buyable skill they used to glue some disparate components of the game together.
---
Now, I'm not opposed to a new skill, but, critically, **many people voting yes seem to be doing so out of a fear of Jagex not polling any more skills if Warding passes, rather than because they actually consider Warding up-to-par.**  I think voting yes to mediocre content out of fear is a terrible precedent to set for our voting.  I think the community is already too ready to vote yes to any vaguely pleasant sounding addition to the game, without considering how it affects the entire game progression permanently throughout the future, and it's compounded even further when people vote Yes just out of fear.
---
Still hard no.
---
These programs aren't new. Nothing has been done about this for years. I don't think jagex actually cares.
---
this is pretty much the only yes argument I ever see and it's pretty hypocritical coming from someone who apparently has never seen a decent no argument. Voting something in just because it can fit the game regardless of whether you actually like it is stupid. I don't even really have an opinion on the skill and will probably skip the vote but this argument makes no sense to me.
---
No
---
So why do we need to add another one?
---
I'd upgrade to Torag legs in this case. (assuming youre talking about slayer?)
---
A new skill is a priority, people want it.
---
Item sink is good for game longevity but only really fits with a skill like Warding. Also to feel oldschool it can't outrank other processing skills by making top tier armor, making it not very beneficial and rewarding for the end game/rich players. 
---
An adventuring skill like Sailing could be really fun (as long as it's about the actual sailing part and not just go places to kill stuff and solve puzzles, that's what Slayer and questing are for) but how is it justified to be a skill? What does it need to be a requirement for so it doesn't turn out as just a minigame with a skill counter and a reward shop which sells op weapons, making it essential for any endgame pvm and pvp? 
---
Artisan (which I personally think is the coolest of the three so far) offers incentive to do various skills as well as try out lesser known skilling content and allows qol upgrading for skilling tools, however the tradeoff is that players lose freedom to train however they want, punishing power/afk leveling of mostly all skills.
---
If I get to choose, I'd say release all three, but very little at a time. People want new skills, well here are three and each should make some of you happy.
---
Alternatively if all three are scrapped, I think they should be looking at making a stealth skill instead. Not sure how it'd work but a LOT of popular games have stealth mechanics, so why not Rs as well?
---
Nobody is talking about nostalgia i don't know where the arguments of *"keeping OSRS pure"* came from but it seems to be another tactic to generalize people who don't like to stand around doing nothing at their banks.
---
Its not about transportation, but its a form of dungoneering you go on adventures in different locations with your ship.
---
heh
---
ty for pointing out the username, gave me a good chuckle
---
The biggest thing holding you back is going to be inexperience. You will find quickly if you haven't already that the average skill level of pkers has risen dramatically.
---
Id honestly play so much fist of guthix it sounds fun as hell. As for the other two i honestly just like the idea of having them i wouldny rlly play other than its rewards
---
Ok
---
oh I'm sorry, my taste in video games doesn't allow me to play and vote for osrs. Gee I'm terribly sorry that the fact that I'm not an elitist dolt that shits on any game that isn't osrs, but unfortunately I don't spend my own time shit talking other games. Why the hell does it matter if I play rs3 and osrs, if I have the skill level that is required to vote in the game, then that's that. Osrs and rs3 are both fine games and I enjoy them both, but then I guess if rs3 doesn't have a giant community of elitist cock snots then maybe it'd be better for newer players, or maybe players who wouldn't want to be in a toxic ass community.
---
Yeah they definitely seemed to have an agenda at times. Even when they were clueless on the topic. 
---
But yeah what i posted was a rough tldr.

---
It's not boring and tedious, it's simple. It's literally just silk + vis = magic armor, just like Crafting is needle + thread + hides = ranged armor, and hammer + bars = melee armor. Warding already offers some worthwhile rewards if they pass, namely an extra slot in rune pouches and skilling rings, and obviously more can be added once the skill passes. Filling a niche is important because there is currently a large gap in available Magic armors and Warding fixes that. If this wasn't the case the skill would not have a use for any players. I do believe there aren't any great reasons to vote no and I want a new skill. If you do too and you don't have any actually good reasons for voting no other than broad "it has weaknesses" please do us a favor and just vote yes.
---
I've seen it on both sides. People in this game act like children and don't know how to have a conversation
---
You can use the chickens in the champions guild
---
Shamelessly stole the picture from a different sub.
---
Just do it. 
---
You're going to die a lot, so just don't whine and cry about it and understand that some of these players have been doing this for 10+ years and theres no reality where you just log on and beat them. OSRS pking mechanically is pretty simple, just hang in there and you'll be competent and having fun in a month or two.
---
Truer words have never been spoken.
---
I haven’t read much into it (or voted) but this is my main takeaway from warding so far. Wtf is the point of a skill making a bunch of magic armor nobody is gonna use? It’s sounds like smithing for junky robes, and robes are less useful than armor in general
---
But it doesn’t negatively impact the game
---
Then you should vote yes. I wouldn’t enjoy this skill, so I will vote no.
---
Just need 3 more skills after that... 2673!!! 😂😁😉👌
---
They released a video explaining warding, but not actually showing the warding process beginning to end.
---
Voting no.
---
Yeah I know but you gotta start somewhere if I don’t start il never learn and I personally think it’s good for people to have a change over from pvm everyone is always moaning how pvm players always vote no on updates but I’m someone who’s looking to learn pking and have fun and vote yes I always did anyway but still! It’s just a nice breath of fresh air changing it up
---
Why you delete OP
---
There is no gameplay. Warding is just a code name for a new squeal of fortune
---
2 twitter users? stop the presses man this is huge
---
They’re getting rid of a bunch of stuff for Ironman and locking it behind a new skill. Why wouldn’t I want combination runes? Why wouldn’t I want scrolls of redirection from the NMZ? 
---
This is just gay crafting.
---
Problem is that all the neckbeard maxed people have multiple accounts as they have a large amount of GP and they do not want warding in the game cause their max cape will be gone.
---
Voting yes. I wanna see people cry.
---
Sailing got 74% with a joke of a blog that wasn't fleshed out at all. Theyve been pushing this warding swill harder than your neighborhood drug dealer.

Ahhh gotcha

im close to being maxed (2248 total atm) and i am voting Yes as well. Love the concept of the skill.
---
I still can't fix it, called my ISP and did every step suggested by people here and on other forums

What he said is definitely true for f2p i wouldnt know about p2p fog tho

Not necesarely, if you melee hit it at the right time it dies aswell
---
petition to ban this nonsense of a client
---
Rip Dragon2pure, he said my wc was nice...
---
I want new ways to get low level magic armor. I also don’t like warding.
---
Lmao at the downvotes but no replies
---
They probably didn't want to put in enough dev time to get a live demo up before it passes a poll. They made mockups of a few of the features but nothing that could be played live and seamlessly.
---
One guy was doing addons for raids in World of Warcraft. Addons were showing what attack will be next and which tiles are safe, to make bosses easier for inexperienced players. Addons were as that good, this guy get hired in Blizzard team.
---
Ash has mentioned earlier that it is an option, if I remember correctly.
---
Isn't "dry" technically one kc over the rate? If so, hes dry then.
---
Continue whining op, I gotchu.
---
/r/shrekmemes leaking.... Just like onion juice
---
Exactly. I don't want casual players to be pressured into saying yes without hearing both sides of the argument, rather being told "vote yes or your just a kid on the nostalgia spectrum"
---
Looks like I should grind out blackjacking before they ban Runlite +.
---
You don't even need to kill it
---
purple skin is trash l. Right by a landslide
---
Its not about negative impact , its about we just dont need it. Tell me one thing in that blog that cannot be put somewhere else? Its just adding a boring skill just to piss ppl off.
---
That is included under “at least close” sir.
---
Oh hey Oscar Pistorius
---
Smh forking an open-source client and monetizing it...
---
Please do something about the spots where you can't hit your opponent, but your opponent can still hit you.
---
we did have swiftkit and stuff like it, but runelite is a step above them
---
they did start out as basically swiftkits, but evolved into what they are now
---
I think the older age of the player base is making it a lot easier than it used to be. The roles are all pretty simple and I killed the queen on 4/5 games. Only had to play the collector role through two rounds to get the points required. That is to say, only had a bad team for one of the 5 sets of games it took.
---
Oh look more strawman arguments.
---
This is painful to see. I just started the ranger boot grind on my iron and I'm at about 130 clues done and I want to quit. Oof.
---
I few people I know and my self have been using it. None of us have been even hacked and it's been months. A few people I did raid with in WDR have been using it. Is there any proof its RL+? Its the classic sometime came out and threats other clients, time for people to make up shit because they either dont like it or trying to kill competition.
---
It will respawns man... you have to glitch it with cannon
---
I stopped reading at “rs3 player here.” Lmao
---
at 200m xp you should be able to buy it or be given it by the skill master.
---
??? If you want to slay in one specific location why use konar? I really don't see your point
---
Agreed, both look shit get a unicorn head you scrubs
---
Btw.btw
---
Newsflash, some people enjoy playing the game differently and enjoyed spending the time playing sc rather than grinding the same 4 mouse clicks repetitively.
---
$33 for a mouse mat? Is that a joke?
---
Voting Yes, the lack of arguments from people saying no is an argument to vote yes!
---
TIL that armor is irrelevant in pvp
---
Well, I want SC back, but I don't want your innocent goldfish to dissolve to death writhing in your stomach acid, so...?
---
I was dreading getting it for the longest time. Finally bit the bullet and got unlucky the first 3 teams (people left) but after that it was smooth sailing.
---
Shit title
---
They can and did before - right? And then they backtracked after the community went mental about how they banned Runelite but allowed OSBuddy
---
It would reveal materials for the skill and the prices would jump just like every other Q &amp; A
---
Notice how I wasn’t aggressive when I said what I said and you chose to reply with level 40 mage armor that is the highest you can buy without going to the GE and just be an asshole no reason.
---
oh look another reddit hivemind opinion on warding
---
they cant tell specifically which 3rd party client you are using, but they can tell if you are using a 3rd party client vs vanilla from what I understand.
---
Eek
---
Didn't hear about that part, that's awesome! We still have a chance!
---
Its the same pricinple. More people think about their vote than you think. You are just buying into what everyone else says.
---
Did someone say beer? 
---
Sure I’ll take a beer
---
Vote yes = free karma, sad really
---
2k total isn’t even an achievement at this point
---
Remember the silent majority.
---
Thanks my dude this is what I wanted to hear take an upvote maybe even pm me your in game
---
Lol every skill is dull to train, what a weird reason to vote no
---
Are you the 1990s computer, the bag, the bottle of what i reckon is lube or the fat bloke?
---
The "boss" kill doesn't grant any roll. You can only get the pet when opening a crate, with a number of rolls as explained above.
---
we all no non-voters are named chad thundercock and 6'2" 225 lbs 7% body fat multiple girlfriends
---
Ok so you disagree with me, what's your reasoning? Why do you believe people should make uninformed, uneducated, emotion based decisions that affect the entire player base? Why is it such an outlandish idea that I want people to understand what they are voting on before they vote?
---
That's a really good was to summarise it. They could literally just have a small minigame or add a few robes to crafting. There's a lot more reasonable solutions than a new skill
---
Don't feel bad, he didn't get banned.
---
it literally is u peanut
---
Hm.  That explains the sudden upvote bias for a previously hated proposal.
---
it's basic outrage culture.
---
That's for DAMN sure!  😂

OK thanks for the good intent, that email address is for the Police to contact us, to put your mind at rest we have already dealt with this though. For future reference you can report  incidents in game to flag it to us, or if you feel there is a very real and imminent danger then obviously just phone your local Police (who in turn can contact us 24/7 if they need to).

For a monster, Hellhounds are best. Skotizo has 100% to drop a hard clue, but isn't consistently available (need Totems).

If you've got money to burn, Implings are the quickest.
---
this is my swamp now
---
Not in my books, if he goes over 25,000 games without a pet, then he can say is "kind of" dry, even then it's pushing it
---
Im stuff
---
&gt; The argument that the skill name and icon is bad is kinda poor because they can be changed quite easily in terms of dev time.
---
How is 'the current thing is bad but it could hypothetically be good if they changed it' a poor argument against voting for the current thing?  
---
I have no desire to max out my character.  I am not just opposed to the buyable bankstanding grind because it's tedious.  I'm opposed to it because a new skill SHOULD be exciting and compelling, else there's very little reason to add it.
---
Yes I agree that we need an item sink somewhere down the timeline, but do we really need a whole skill just for this? There is many other ways it could be implemented
---
Every skill is "grind" you fucking twat, "grind" is what OSRS is!
---
looool
---
Oh right, I forgot about giant seaweed. I never got around to starting on giant seaweed before I had the pet, so there was never any point.
---
The base chance for magic trees is 1/9368 while the base chance for giant seaweed is 1/7500, making giant seaweed better. At 99, those are reduced to 1/(9386-25*99) = 1/6911 and 1/(7500-25*99) = 5025.
---
It's good for pet, but considering how little xp it gives, I don't think it's that good. It also takes quite a long time to get to compared to most of the other trees. Post-99 xp is pretty nice to have, so I'd just ignore it and go for fruit, calquat, and mahogany, and now redwood too. Unless of course you're 200m farming, at which point you might as well do seaweed.
---
Depending on phrasing dry just means not having the pet. e.g "I'm 50 kills dry on vorkath, still no vorki".
---
"Make an informed decision" is code for "agree with me"
---
Oh I know that part I meant after to repay him back for helping.
---
apparently at least one gower brother has said they liked warding and wish they had added it into the game. i havent seen it but i can entertain that.
---
sure, it could've been added back when the game was young and still making decisions on its design. instead of robes coming from npcs, they couldve added warding instead.
---
but fast forward to even 2007, its already established in the game design and mechanics that robes come from non player sources; to add warding at that stage is a radical change for no good purpose other than unwarranted consistency.
---
at least eoc sought to improve the combat. warding is just meaninglessly shaking up and rearranging the game. the truth is its just a publicity stunt, new skill hype!
---
this is the content I’m here for
---
its okay cheesy &lt;3 ill work on getting it back
---
That isn't the point of GE tax...
---
OP, is that you?
---
maybe not but ive gotten alot better at her since yesterday, still sucked losing it
---
It's not for sale...why should he be professional?
---
Cool story Hansel
---
Inb4 bot upvotes.
---
you got this youll get it
---
If doing warding was like doing werewolf agility it will fail at 30%
---
Slayer and Range are buyable with Cannonballs. The other Combat skills are either trained through Slayer or AFKing for a few weeks at NMZ.
---
Torvesta, Framed, Mr Mammal, Ricecup, C Engineer, Turtletale, Caveman Only, Wildmudkip, Rargh, Linksocarina, Tanzoo, Virtoso, Tedious, KempQ, Fatnooblet, Dicerz, 25 Buttholes,  probably a couple dozen others I'm forgetting about.
---
Ive seen so many people come to me at zulrah on w330 just to say they saw me from reddit lmfao
---
I would rather have those graphics.
---
\&gt;ROT will be hurt and can't extort players as easily
---
WTF??? I love Warding now??! Everyone vote yes?!!
---
My understanding is that Sailing wasn't voted in, in part, because they didn't actually how the moment-to-moment training, they just kind of hyped up rewards for it.  We need to see the specific implementation (as we have with Warding) before we can know whether to vote something in, because even Sailing could be done very badly.
---
To the people downvoting this please elaborate in the comment section. I don't understand what's wrong with giving a hated skill a new perk (which actually would fit the theme of the skill perfectly) instead of creating an entire new skill just for that.
---
Just to clarify, that rate is only achieved after hitting 200m?
---
I adored SC cause i could finally pick pocket playees! They said my 99 thieiving was pointless... hehehehe
---
It's not a reason to add warding specifically, it's that "it's boring so it doesn't belong in OSRS" isn't a valid reason to vote no. Find something else to criticize about it, because it being a tedious grindy time-sink actually fits in perfectly with the rest of the game.
---
Pmods
---
Another generalization ^
---
The phrase is very hive mind.... also I said "I have seen this comment 100 times in the past few days" does not mean I'm seeing it too often. I was just offering a reason as to why people who say that phrase get downvoted. 
---
Also let's say that warding being integrated into the other skills like you suggested passes. The same amount of dev time will be used to achieve that then creating another skill. 
---
So other then being spiteful I don't see your reasoning being all that valid to why it shouldn't be added.
---
Ah yes, let's make runecrafting buyable!
---
The safe option is to not vote at all
---
So you reported someone for botting with no actual proof of them botting. Cool
---
Yes please u want to have to grind a pointless and annoying as fucj skill to get bis weapons.
---
Guess what buddy they wanted higher level stuff for Warding but the community shot them down because "muh BIS".
---
Yes, a new skill will introduce the entire player population to this item sink. If they just arbitrarily add an item sink through some mechanic then only the people that read the patch notes and pay attention enough to understand the significance of an item sink will use it.
---
I'd like to add that you seem to be the one who is angry.
---
Jagex. Just implement things like multicore support, GPU rendering, skyboxes and maybe some rudimentary xp tracker into the official client. After that ban all 3rd party clients. 
---
Or just make RuneLite the official and only allowed client.
---
2k kc  and still no mole. But mole is decent money at least lol.
---
Also waterfall quest.
---
What are the OP tick counters?
---
I'd imagine tick counters are just like a metronome but keeping track of clicks.
---
It’s the Captain America meme from Endgame.
---
Vegan?
---
It should have some changes to it. People are still paying runners to level up their runecrafting. Atleast give the skill another use.
---
We have one useless skill, let’s just add more! Nice argument.
---
Because the crafting skill is already full of fucking content imo, also it's another 99 to obtain.
---
What's runelite +…?
---
But attacking a player gives a skull. And they attacked. 100%working as intended.
---
Heh, good thing I play mobile.
---
They straight up just will not do that. Honestly, can you imagine the outrage? It would be on par with them introducing mtx to the game.
---
Splashing is so low xp and with the 6 hour nerf it’s now a non-issue. I really don’t know why Reddit gets so salty about it sometimes.
---
/u/nwordcountbot /u/ficagamer11

Wow! You're an idiot.

What kind of store sells pot, rather where can i find it
---
I'm not wasting my time disputing a strawman. Your argument is one big logical fallacy. I don't have the time to teach you critical thinking or formal logic, so google "strawman argument" and grow.
---
I think one thing that gets over looked is that implementing warding is as big of a risk to jagex as it is to us, if not more, and they seem to be very aware of that.
---
This poll in itself may seem huge, but if warding passes it will seem like nothing compared to the refinement process that follows.
---
Well I guess that’s just how you determine it, to me it seems different. I look at it seperately to crafting and it does have its own identity but that’s just subjective.
---
How is one click blackjacking different from the menu entry bone swapper that lets people get massive xp ?? How do you draw the line ?
---
'How is 'the current thing is bad but it could hypothetically be good if they changed it' a poor argument against voting for the current thing?' 
---
Because it is an easy thing to adjust while voting 'no' because of that reason is extremely nitpicking. Like imagine they were about to release a skill that you are really hyped about and someone says they gonna vote no because they don't like the logo and skill name. 
---
I agree on the second point. rs needs more fun skills that is fun to train as opposed to another bankstand skill. I think they ran out of good ideas and seeing as they try to release a skill every 2-3 years and this is their champion, i am not hopeful.
---
Fletch
---
I mean they did add prifdinas with basically the same design style as RS3. A lot of updates in osrs are reminiscent of quality updates within that game.
---
MTX got over 30% yes, proving that there's a base of roughly 25-30% of voters who always vote yes.  Other horribly unpopular suggestions also polled around 30%.  Extremely popular suggestions, however, poll upwards of 96%.  So, there is not a significant number of "always no's."
---
Remember, OSRS was created due to massive amounts of people being angry over updates.  It's a fragile community prone to rage quitting over unwanted stuff more than rage quitting over lack of updates.  I think 75% is good, but I wouldn't object to raising it to 80% ;)
---
Read the bloGG you scrubs. Or do you need a quick guide since your attention spans are 5 seconds?
---
Pkis4BigGay
---
Yes, actually. I check each plugin I use.
---
Yes make sure you follow the guide on how to play your open world MMORPG to a T or you will not be successful and therefore not have fun. Remember, if what you're doing is fucking boring and you hate it, you're doing it the right way. Be sure to complain about whatever you're doing on an hourly basis in your cc. Never play the game the way you want to because this is stupid.
---
Her face looks kinda funky
---
No one would ever vote yes to it. It's a fundamental change in an original skill to make it go from hardest skill to train to buyable.
---
That's the fundamental problem with 3rd party clients though- jagex cannot tell what client you are using. We know this with 100% certainty because *bot clients exist*, and yet jagex is still monitoring input sequences to detect bots. If they knew directly what client you were using this wouldn't be an issue. 
---
You either approve of every conceivable 3rd party client feature that could ever be made, or you think 3rd party clients should be banned across the board. There is no other logically consistent opinion and the notion that runelite is the magic sweetspot is nonsensical.
---
Some skills are enjoyable to do and others aren’t. This won’t be a fun grind. Just like runecrafting, crafting, smithing, and others aren’t fun grinds. I do them because they’re already in the game and in order to progress, I need to do them. Why would I advocate for another skill I don’t want to do? 
---
And if you talk to me like that again I’ll fuck your abuela you room temp IQ ape.
---
The line, at the very least, is drawn when the client gives you information you wouldn't otherwise get from just watching your screen, unless the purpose of the content is about the user using his brain (clue puzzles mostly). A third party client should be replaceable by simply paying attention and using your brain. Things like agility course hitboxes, xp drops, fishing spots, timers and spot indicators makes it easier to understand what's happening on the screen. Take the farming timers as an example. They give you the time when your tree will be finished but if there's any changes in the game while you're not there (like it dying) the client won't show it as dead until it's on the screen. 
---
Something like this actively does something and doesn't just give information (if it does what I think it does). Just the automatically posting in discord is a bit too far cause then it automatically does something.
---
There's a lot of things I consider cheat features, but I do believe it's entirely possible to draw a line that differentiates cheating from quality of life and improvements to the game. Or maybe changes that the game devs WISH they could implement to make the game, but has other limitations and reasons as to why they couldn't.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
\&gt; I feel like that’s pretty much what enchanting already is. 
---
It literally is.
---
I don't think they should do much to change Tutorial Island, especially with things like PVP that is going to be overwhelming to brand-new players and annoying for people making skills alts.   
---
I think there should be a separate tutorial area that is optional, but advertised. Maybe at the end of Tutorial island you are told about a "Training Camp" that goes over more complex aspects of the game and that you can "Go when your'e ready"  
---
Maybe add a canoe in Lumbridge river that takes you to said camp?
---
lol they can not ban all third party clients
---
they would kill the game if they did that.
---
at least 25% of the players would quit
---
Maxed and gonna vote yes :) race to 99 will be fun
---
Yeah, it‘s big brain time.
---
voted no
---
Only if accept aid is on right?
---
That acts the same way as the other buyables and feels  a niche? Why not
---
Right, but the people you are buying it from that don't have that kinda money do the dissolving for you. Just because YOU won't do it doesn't mean there wont be a multitude of people that will. I guarantee there will be ways to dissolve certain items to make 1m+ per hour which for you may not be much money. Yet a low/mid level account that can quite a bit.
---
It also future proofs the game, currently so many items sit at or even slightly below their alchemy value. People can potentially buy some of these items to dissolve and make money doing it. Removing these items from the game without creating additional wealth through high alch.
---
So no new crafting skills, period, is what that boils down to.
---
Can confirm
---
Or vote no to every damn new update and let the game begin to decline.
---
why
---
But couldn't you also argue that having some ambiguity in the name would make players curious as to what it is about rather than just voting on the how the name sounds? And Warding is the same situation as Runecrafting where it requires game context to understand, yet you say that is fine for RC and are acting like it is a huge problem for Warding.
---
You do realise we polled to have results hidden? Now that they are everyone seems to have their tin foil hats on.
---
Honestly I miss FOG so much, it was such a cool minigame.
---
ya just add on skills we already have.
---
It is a fork, but that doesn’t mean they can’t add things that are sketchy to it.
---
Have you got hidden access to the polls?
---
Lol... Nexon.
---
I'd like to remind everyone to vote however they feel. But be informed,  read the dev blog and documentation. Then make your own decision. Don't  get influenced by your clanmates, friends, reddit or twitter!
---
Voting yes
---
  I'd like to remind everyone to vote however they feel. But be informed,  read the dev blog and documentation. Then make your own decision. Don't  get influenced by your clanmates, friends, reddit or twitter!
---
Hard no.  It can legit just be added to crafting. No need to make a new skill out of it
---
Also, Mod Sweeney has confirmed that if Warding should pass, multiple betas would be conducted until a final form of Warding that everyone can agreed is made
---
Features that shouldn’t be allowed. 
---
Tbh, Runelite+ is one of the many reasons they should make using third party clients banable
---
Do you really think it'll pass?
---
Sailing was actually a legitimate skill idea? I always thought it was just a meme
---
Lmao what the fuck, do you even know how many twisted bows are in game?
---
Such insults, but I suppose you've also said you're only tough behind a screen, so I guess I won't take it personally.
---
Loved Mountain Daughter.
---
no
---
The amount of pro warding posts were counterproductive for this reason in my opinion.
---
Creating meaningful discussion in an attempt to sway votes is one thing, but spamming the entire subreddit with shitty strawman memes is another.
---
The only similarity that you're drawing is clicking. So by that logic performing any action on a computer screen with a click is the same thing. Brb I'm going to go play CSGO and tell everyone we are doing our taxes because they both require you to click things on the screen.
---
I don't think farming zulrah is monotonous, I don't think doing a demonic gorillas task is monotonous, and I don't think doing raids is monotonous. If you think those things are monotonous just like doing a bank standing skill, maybe *you're* playing the wrong game and should consider quitting if you aren't having fun.
---
Stop spamming this comment everywhere. You aren't doing anyone a service, they're gonna make the same decision with or without your input.
---
Holy shit, this is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!
---
Why would they? They think it is good for the game, and people have expressed their interest for new skills many times. If it doesn't pass then it doesn't pass, Jagex is going to spend that dev time on something else then. 
---
Also keep in mind that all this design stuff they have done is by no means wasted time either, they can use what they have learned in the future.
---
Glad to help :)
---
I started doing this the other day for fun. It’s a pretty good distraction from skilling, and I made a new friend.
---
How does it feel insulting people because they disagree with you over a video game?
---
Charge your fucking phone god damn.
---
Yes please this was the best minigame ever
---
I haven’t been paying all that much attention but from browsing I’ve gathered there seems to be more in favour over these not. Maybe not 75%, but we’ll see.
---
It would be less appealing. Why would they work so hard to make the game less appealing?
---
No, but I know 1b is a lot of gp for the vast majority of the playerbase.
---
Except being something that should get you banned. If you need something to play for you go play a single player RPG on easy.
---
Yep. I quit about a year ago, but I still check this subreddit in hopes of news on a new skill making it in, group ironmen, and/or revamped co-op slayer.
---
16kc ironman Phoenix btw and 26kc Phoenix Hc btw. Dunno what ure on about
---
+1 For the dope color.
---
ALSO
---
Let’s us turn it sideways and put it on a stock so we can fire it like a big two handed crossbow
---
speechless I am, a rare condition for me.
---
Despite what they've said, another skill could always come around; but if warding it gets added, its not like it would ever be removed.
---
Yes or no, your vote is important.
---
What complete spastics like OP doesn't realize is that he is gonna get fucked over by warding more than any maxed player if the skill does come out. Also, maxed player trade secret: Combating shitty polls are the real reason why making alts is beneficial since votes are the one thing redditors can't downvote out of existence.
---
Wasn't it more of a change of their approach to development? Like a separate branch to runescape.
---
It's not even like actual 2007 runescape - for example summoning was added in january 2008 (6 months after the random 2007 backup) but in osrs people decided it doesn't fit.
---
Why'd you press spacebar is the real question
---
you scammed yourself
---
Warding just doesn't fit the game.  They could have just added it to crafting.
---
read it and voted no
---
That’s true. But then your just adding it just to add a skill.
---
you're proving my point, that jagex lied
---
If they really want it, they wouldn't make a poll and just put it into the game.
---
No point in pretending anything.
---
This is the company that still doesn't have GPU rendering for their desktop client 6 years into OSRS.
---
I don't like questing either. The new elf quest looks good though.
---
I'm not gonna waste time reading a fucking runescape blog. I got better things to do.
---
I feel like I should vote no, typing in all caps really doesnt make your side of the argument sound intelligent.
---
any skill that is just assembling and building things could 100% be done at the GE. Sounds like the GE is the problem
---
Fucking hell this is OP, people are going to use this to scout for my spade.
---
Sorry, maybe I should've called you a scumbag and you wouldn't be so offended.
---
How unfortunate.
---
Because you used to have to talk to the elf, now you just left click once and buy a crystal shield with space bar.
---
I feel that if they didn't just push through partnerships they wouldn't do it here either. Just my opinion.
---
This doesn’t even make sense, I enjoy your art but you’re a real dumbass.
---
It isn't, really.
---
I am educated on the topic. My stance is this: I *do NOT* want or need anymore skills in *my* game. I voted *NO* on all of the past skills, warding no *fucking* different. 
---
Protip: *My $11, My GOD DAMN FUCKING VOTE.* I am allowed to vote however educated or uneducated I wish to be, at *ANY* fucking given time. 
---
You want my vote? Pay me $12 a month, and I'll give it to ya, buddy.
---
From the Varrock Museum
---
It will probably be 55-65% in favour.
---
explains the name though doesn't it
---
As someone whose on the fence for voting. I do have to give credit that jagex actually worked hard on this outline of the skill.
---
25 buttholes is pretty funny
---
i fuck with it
---
Shout out to the dude trying to buy a scythe or tbow for 32m. What a baller.
---
You're not trying to log into a free world are you?
---
This poll was almost as easy as the partnership one!
---
Ancients would get a hard no.
---
Just voted no to all questions. :D
---
Again, find where I said specifically the construction cape is overpowered. I simply said that cape bonuses are unbalanced, and you're getting all worked up about it. Why do so many capes have guaranteed bonuses, while slayer cape has a very small chance of you utilizing it. On top of that small chance if you are using konar your chance of getting the full potential is dropped even more. I said the slayer cape is under powered and skillcapes are unbalanced, but never specifically said construction cape needs a change or rebalance. I'm using the bonus of that cape as an example.
---
The majority of the community is educated enough to understand warding is useless. So as long as they vote it will be a hard no.
---
Where is this beauty?
---
SORRY
---
Isnt that what skills are? We add them to do something else we havent done before that has some purpose. 
---
It promotes the game too and could bring back old players and interest new ones. I like the idea of more variety in robes too.
---
that's just way too simple of a calculation to have much weight. There are way too many variables to say the 30 million xp is the same or harder difficulty than the ~8m xp in a new skill.
---
Might as well revert all the updates we've had since the game first released then. This is OLD SCHOOL after all so we'll remove zulrah, the inferno e.t.c. no grand exchange just vanilla 2007. No? That's what I thought.
---
Dungeoneering was my motivation for skilling, hah. RS2 had some beautiful minigames
---
Hmm?  But I told you I wasn't insulted.  And calling me a scumbag would just be a lie, but I guess I wouldn't put it past you to lie to make yourself feel better
---
Bring stamina potions to help with the running. Aside from that, yeah a lot of the quests suck ,especially the older ones. The newer ones or the ones in longer quest lines are usually decent.
---
I'd absolutely love to get rid of all third party clients, but the issue is that jagex have decided to completely outsource QoL updates to them.
---
Playing this game without things like GPU rendering, loot tracker, animation smoothing, left click banking, all the bank features and chat filters just makes it really show its age.
---
That doesn't mean that Jagex shouldnt occasionally pop in and go "btw can you guys stop fucking cheating" as is their fucking jobs.
---
Yeah but still
---
This is absolutely disgusting...
---
It's not like master clues are being farmed at the rates of meds, or that this ornamental kit will drop at 1/10 rates either though... Tbow is niche, but so will this item be.

Wait you can barrage by hotkey sign me the fuck up.

How did they lie? Did they force that content in? Or did it get voted in by 75%+ of the players?

---
I'm commenting on everyones post over warding. It's a skill, and for some reason all you attention whores need to post every few seconds. 
---
When did I ever say warding was good or bad? Try harder next time freak.
---
I think the farming guild as a representation of what skilling tasks should be is a sufficient rebuttal to that argument. If artisan were to be properly implemented, there are far more creative and balanced ways than copying slayer's "kill this thing for a while then kill something else for a while."
---
Not everyone does skilling contracts, but they have the option to and they're solid content. Artisan could theoretically have been just like that.
---
Yeah, the standard ehp rate is lava runes 1+1. Meaning you run essence to yourself on an alt plus paying one person to run you runes. Its possible to get double that rate if you pay for 3 runners rather than one though. Highest sustained rate I've seen was 221k xp/hr over 6 hours.
---
i don't see why you're any more of an authority on this than i am, but thanks for your input, galaxy brain

Always look for wQ4 in the link lol
---
Vote no, so Jamflex can answer those questions WITHOUT having you to agree to put a half assed skill already in game.
---
 I would 100% vote no to it being under rc.
---
You're probably blind then
---
1 click blackjacking, yeah that sounds closer to a bot client than a client with some nice QoL
---
I’m pretty sure you’re doing the same thing, lol
---
can you post a picture of the votes feature on runelite+?
---
Its not the most efficent rate, its only 1+1. So one alt, one runner. It is possible to do 1+3 and get 220k xp/hr, but the CML board decided thats too inaccessible for most people.
---
Z E D
---
Haha... wojak... man im laughing so hard right now....
---
I look out for xQc
---
Drumpf pwnd 😂😂😂😂
---
I really hope so... If they do that before implementing the QoL changes their selves, they better save our stats and don't make us restart again when they release OSOSRS after losing everyone again.
---
I personally voted no because it is just going to be a buyable skill and not an engaging one at all. We need a skill that requires people to get out and train it not sit at the GE and buy the mats to 99.
---
Its just another crafting/smithing skill and could be put in the game not as its own skill but as an update to crafting that has magic requirements.
---
It's their job to do their Jagex work, not to have a presence on social media and get hounded by sacks of shit
---
You say that 90% of t bow owners don't want a white t bow and i say who do you think you are to assume that?
---
&gt;Don't be so selfish and let's vote based on what's best for the game from a long term's perspective.
---
Yeah, for example, something fresh.
---
I read the blog and just genuinely do not like the concept.
---
Give credit.
---
lol post deleted
---
More like college going into special education. As in enrolling.
---
I just hope they filter by ip..
---
I think the "valid" double accounts per ip are dwarved by the alts: so jagex probably gets better results by filtering per ip and only allow a single vote per ip. Or let the "average" of one IP count as a single vote.

Dungeoneering and Summoning when
---
It doesn't play for me though.
---
It is totally separate from the current version, known as Runescape 3. I only joined OSRS a couple years ago but what I understand is there was such a large request from the community several years ago for an older version of the game that Jagex uploaded it and named it Oldschool Runescape, launching in 2013 I think. Membership can be bought, and works for both Runescape 3 and OSRS. The player population is very healthy on OSRS and still growing, generally more populated than RS3 from what I understand. I am sure a more veteran OSRS player can correct me or add much more detail though.
---
Turns out the whole plane is going to runefest
---
Hopefully he protected item on the nuclear codes.
---
Hey aren't you in the ddotgg clan chat
---
4 IQ move
---
ngl i'm definitely willing to accept that i'm probably wrong about this.
---
The nostalgic influenced ignorance is so blinding for you.. all your points are so emotion driven that it's not even about the game. it's about what you want, and why you're going to throw a tantrum if you dont get it. You do understand that this game isnt guaranteed to be available correct? If Jagex decided they wanted to kill the game, they could shut down all their servers and guess what.. you wouldnt have osrs anymore. Just because you voted yes to a poll doesnt mean it has to be available to you. So again, if jagex wasnt so dedicated to the game, you would not have it. The company holds copyrights for the game. If they DID NOT want it out, they could cease and desist every private server and any client recreating it. You're such an entitled crybaby it's actually pitiful and sad. "This is my game and I dont want it to change for the better, I vote no to everything, and any update is garbage and kills the game." it's pathetic.
---
Why do you go on every post and state that you are voting no? Generally curious.
---
2277 total on my iron. Voting yes as well because osrs is 6+ years old and I think its overdue to have something new to train. I was very on the fence with warding until this recent blog. I'm confident it will evolve into a great skill that fits osrs.
---
If it's done client side, it can be intercepted and changed anyway...
---
It is totally separate from the current version, but also made by jagex and completely official. 
---
&gt;Are many people on the old version?
---
You have to use pretty specific language when asking these questions lol, cuz either one could be "the old one". Old school runescape has concurrent players typically in the 60-100k range. Runescape (colloquially RS3) has typically 15-40k concurrent players.
---
It's not so clear if you don't explain at all why
---
Absolute virgin
---
You could just do this walking around the GE then. Once you've opened the door for crazy stalkers hunting down usernames, what does even matter if they're on a list of banned players or the Hiscores table?
---
vote NO
---
Same thing has happened with “no” lol
---
&gt;There's probably a case to be made. Runelite+ needs the original client to function, so you might consider it a derived work for which they have no license from Jagex.
---
And so long as it doesn't contain jagex intellectual property then it has the right to exist. But you're totally right about the deobfuscation, it's a very muddy grey area with that existing within the Runelite repo. If I recall correctly that's what Jagex tried to pin them on last time they tried sicking their teeth into third party clients. Even then, it's difficult to say that it's even illegal or legal to deobfuscate the freely distributed client for the users own purposes. I really don't want to interject my own opinions into the conversation, but the de obfuscation tool itself probably shouldn't be illegal but if Runelite were to distribute the client then of course it would be illegal. And anyone can obtain the client if they want to. Put two and two together and ehhh...
---
By no means are they toothless though you're also right about that. This world strongly favours those with lots of lawyers. They don't even need a case whatsoever to bully the makers of any client to shutdown. It costs a lot to fight for your rights, usually too much for hobbyists making cheat clients, or hobbyists making "legitimate" clients. Especially in a world that doesn't understand the internet, let alone the complexities of codebases and copyright/trademark/intellectual property law when it comes to dealing with these matters. I don't think the loss is that big to them. They were ready to tear down Runelite for providing what osbuddy did for free. The only thing that stopped them was community backlash. Otherwise they would followed through to the end of the clients.
---
Honestly that's a huge point for me and I love it
---
They log mouse speed and if a click is valid.

If someone calls me a noob I delete the game.

Which is why it's weird as fuck, this subreddit suffers from borderline personality disorder.

Quests are an easy way to get some free levels and know more about the game

People are singing warding's praises, but it's just a buyable bankstanding skill.
---
Not everything from a clue can be third age slick, as with anything, bad drops (not that this would be, I could forsee it being 10-30m for a while) have to exist.
---
I find it better because it's not a threat. He's not saying vote yes for warding or im never drawing again
---
To counter your first point about osrs not needing a new skill, I'd like to bring up the fact that in 2004-2007 that 5 skills were added, over 70 quests, loads of bosses, and minigames. Production time for content has drastically slowed down.
---
Voted no on 8 accounts and just collected 16m easiest money ever

Needs way more passive aggressive bitching to be wdr

I trust the devs to make warding a great addition to OSRS.

The post history is golden!
---
The issue with that is it would make RC a 400K per hour buyable... I'm sure some would be okay with that, but it is pretty much the same as letting players buy Agility Exp. Completely changing an existing skill like that is more against "old school" than adding a new skill. Give it less exp and you still make RC buyable. Give it no exp and it would be horribly inconsistent compared to how everything else in the game works. Perhaps some mechanics could work in RC, like repairing Rune Pouches, but the entire Warding skill does not work as part of RC.
---
difference is, that was a genuinely funny joke, you’re just unnecessarily bringing up politics for no real reason.
---
I mean with that argument let's just merge smithing and crafting. Already have a skill called crafting, why do you need a new one specifically to craft metal armor? Oh look I can draw smiley faces like an mlm mom too!! :) :) :) The point of a "skill" in both RS and the meaning of the word, is it's, in part, SPECIFIC. Make it too general and cover too many things and it isn't a skill anymore, but a group of skills. If anything I'd be all for moving some of the crafting bits to warding, like staves
---
I think that the amount of people openly talking about using alts to vote down something devs would clearly like to implement just makes it more likely that Jagex will eventually stop polling every change. If they know people are cheating the system, why would they use that system to determine what they do?
---

Lmao
---
its runelite on the surface yes, but since runelite obfuscated their injected client they couldn't rely on bytecode edits that were needed because of the blocks put in place that would stop a lot of the op plugins. They had to create their own injector using an old version of runelite's along with runestar hooks. They also had to implement any missing raw injectors for new plugins that needed them such as Minimenu and GPU, and fix all the bugs that the old injector had due to using an old tool with the newest revision of RS and support the newer runelite annotations. had, they had to use an old one and add missing functionality to that as Runelite actually stopped hosting those tools at Jagex's request. As of now, Runelite + is actually more open source then Runelite.  The internals of both clients differ.

Tutorial island and tudurial island... you can guess which one is for the PvP'rs

It’s so good at those places that it’s 100% worth selling gear for. Mediocre gear for slayer and a tbow for bosses is way better than max melee. Also endgame is basically just pethunt/raids/slayer and tbow is amazing for all 3

Amidst all this toxicity about warding I found this comment pretty funny
---
What the actual fuck. He was just saying he wanted to protect the nuclear fucking codes you dimwit. 
---
Do you even understand how important they are and how bad it would be in Chairmang Kim had those codes. We’d be toast. Donezo. You moron you’re not a doctor your probably just some snot nose brat PRETENDING to be a doctor over the internet. It’s people like you that MAKE ME SICK. Ironic that you call yourself a doctor huh??
---
I’m so sad and ignorant about a fucking runescape plugin. Listen to yourself
---
This just in, the ditch got 10 ft deeper, more at 9
---
blowpipie is more Op then any chaotic weapon was, scryte too
---
Rigondeaux especially lol, it's not like he's got such a vibrant personality that I'd follow him anywhere.
---
That would be very disappointing. Without new skills I feel the only way they can add meaningful content is by powercreeping the shit out of the game
---

Hey sween, just some feedback for the warding team if they're interested. I went back and forth all week but ended up voting yes. I think that the two main things warding will bring to the game (item sinks and increased variety/viability for magic as a combat style) are both positives, and for me those ultimately outweighed the main negative.
---
The one thing I'm specifically worried about is that the optimal training method isn't going to be very fun or unique. There seems to be a good variety of warding-related activities proposed: collecting silks from moths, breaking down items, actually crafting the finished product, etc. However, the way it looks right now, high-level players won't participate in anything other than the bankstanding aspect. There are enough bankstanding skills in osrs already; I'd rather warding training somehow encourage an optimal player to participate in more parts of the skill.
---
Funny how you call someone illiterate then proceed to spell and compose your sentence like shit.
---
It was  [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rocky](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rocky)  In the Trivia section it confirms it.
---
My big thing is even if you vote no be sure to read and vote on the other questions.  If the skill does pass and you just skipped everything past question 1 you will hate the skill even more than you already did.
---
&gt;Your first post comes across as "even if you dislike the skill, you should vote yes on it because others do like it" &lt;- this only works if the person is impartial and on the fence.
---
That wasn't my intended point to get across, but yes I do see where that's what it sounds like. Thank you for sharing your perspective on it!
---
So glad you made everything dependent on question 1. 
---
The content without the skill could still be good.

God, this guy really got jumped hard. He's fucking delusional if he thinks that anyone would watch him if he didn't play rs. There's no community to take with you, no one really gives a fuck about you.
---
In a post about a poll being manipulated, you're such an idiot lol
---
They should look at any OSRS streamer when they try streaming another game, usually loses 60% - 70% of their usual viewer count.
---
No offense to OSRS streamers, but none of the current streamers other than b0aty are interesting or good enough to have a large following outside of OSRS.
---
Yah, that is fair. I'll agree that for a Level 30 armor, that new monk set is pretty crazy. It is BiS Prayer and BiS against Zamorakian Creatures. Also, it is way better than the Arceuus set, which is also Level 30. So I'd say it is completely justified to be opposed to that set; at least at the level it was given. Once you get to the Level 50 set, then it starts to feel more reasonable to introduce bonus effects.
---
I think this should apply to more skills. As someone who recently went from f2p to p2p as a new player what excited me most about membership wasn't the "new" skills. I had no understanding of herblore bc I had no way of exploring it, but I was excited for all the new things to craft bc I already liked crafting from trying it in f2p. 
---
I understand that it causes inflation of supply, but simple things like low level fletching/agi would make f2p a lot more enjoyable, but also make someone like me more likely to hop to members (which I have done now)
---
Yeah, like crafting ranged armour! Which costs like 8k and is rag gear. Let's make a skill that does that for magic armour!
---
Starts send em back to their country chant... lol
---
Only half true tbh

It does not take long to get to. Maybe 30 seconds with digsite pendant and click boat 3 times.

hoo boy you just fucking owned me on this Old School Runescape subreddit
---
Haha, ive been playing rs in general since 2011/2012 but just got back into osrs after quitting rs3 last summer. osrs has so much nostalgia, i love it
---
You're both wrong.
---
The real solution is a binomial distribution with n = 2 and p = 1/1000. When n and p are small (as is the case here), n\×p is a close approximation. When they are large, that approximation diverges a lot from the real solution.
---
It’s really just a shit throwing contest at this point. People love to hate
---
LMAO Have fun playing that dog shit garbage heap. Nobody will miss you, scumbag.
---
you have no idea
---
Nice looking.
---
I'm sure they will if the poll passes.
---
Warding will win by a landslide, much like when Hillary won the election.
---
Aren’t cheaters already bringing back public shaming, given how often we see posts of them publicly complaining to mods why they were banned?
---
This is so sad, I need to go play Sea Shanty 2 to calm down.
---
Eh most likely vennys not bots
---
Ok, let's brain storm for a minute: what new resources could be added to the game that would be useful in existing skills that wouldn't bloat them?
---
Listed in alphabetical order, here are the resource using skills and my opinion on their ability to use new resources:
---
Cooking: this could probably use new resources without a problem, however I don't see a viable resource gathering skill that could add a new resource for it.
---
Construction: I personally feel like construction is as the edge of being bloated already, and adding new resources for it would push it over the edge.
---
Crafting: pretty much everyone agrees that this skill is already bloated, so adding new resources for it would be a bad idea
---
Farming: this already has seeds and saplings, so I'm not sure what else you could logically plant and grow.  Might could work if Jagex has a brilliant idea.
---
Fletching: not bloated, but would need a brilliant idea to add anything logical
---
Firemaking: this is lacking in almost every sense, so I'd be happy if Jagex added more resources for it.  Things you can set on fire irl but not in OSRS include coal, cloth, oil, other chemical compounds, etc.  Maybe something like Alchemy could be added, where you gather various chemicals/oils throughout the world that could be used in firemaking, herbalore, and maybe cooking.
---
Herbalore: could maybe use an update.  As mentioned before, Alchemy could be added where you gather chemicals/oils that could be used in herbalore.
---
Prayer: kinda a resource using skill.  If Jagex could add a skill where you gather souls/holy relics, those resources could be used as a supplement to burying bones to train prayer.
---
Runescrafting: a skill that many consider tedious, maybe adding a new resource that allows you to craft runes away from altars could fill that niche (however, I'd be worried that people would complain about making RC even more of a buyable skill).
---
Smithing: another skill that's probably good as is.  Jagex would need a miracle to find a new resource that is a logical addition to it
---
What do you think?  What new resource would you add that cannot logically be gathered by an existing skill that would also logically fit into one of the skills listed above?
---
he looks too chill for the dialogue...
---
Just store alchables until you either need money or feel like / want to train warding.
---
Vote no.
---
Changes absolutely nothing
---
That’s the thing, they have no way to tell who is on which client, meaning they have no course of action
---
great, thanks for your help
---
Not a single person using the client has been banned or hacked for usimg the client. Don't spread misinformation just because you don't like something. There are multiple people in the top 5 pages that use it all the time.
---
thank you for your service
---
Ok, and?
---
I truly genuinely miss this.
---
Im not sure whether it’s r/whoosh or you’re just retarded
---
Sober up and vote no.
---
Bigg if true.
---
u/nwordcountbot u/4str0
---
shit now i really want warding to pass
---
do it, no balls
---
Considering 90% of your comment history is you shilling for yes votes to warding maybe you should go take your bias somewhere else too and let people make their own decisions.
---
1800 total voting YES
---
literally no one is saying they don't want warding because they don't want to get another 99. we've already done it 23 times, what's one more? we're saying no because it's a shit concept.
---
I thought I heard it was going to be removed, they're just not going to take away the imbues already out. From Nightmare Zone that is.
---
your """opinion""" makes as much sense as 
---
"Mcdonald's shouldn't add new types of hamburgers because they don't fit the restaurant"
---
every single part of the skills from gathering, to crafting, to production, is EXACTLY like other skills in the game and it fills a missing piece to the magic side of the combat triangle nothing about that is an opinion you actual caveman
---
i swear your head must be so caved in that your eyes don't work because clearly you didn't read the blog. If you had the reading comprehension of a 3rd grader you would know that it objectively fits the game
---
I've had a heated discussion about this last night in my clan, unfortunately a lot of members are like this... It kind of saddens me really.
---
If you buy me a bond, I'll vote yes for you
---
u think rs3 is a good game
---
gl camping wyverns for a tbow and scythe xd
---
This was posted 5 days ago. At least wait a couple of weeks...
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
1. While it's not a direct gold sink, it does prevent additional gold from coming into the game.
---
2. agreed
---
3. PvM chads will never allow a crafting based skill to bring a BiS item into the game. "Why do high level PvM when you can just make BiS" would be the arguement. Even if the material required to create the BiS was an end game pvm drop.
---
4. The idea of a skill being complete on release is asinine. We need to develop a skill with room to grow while still offering high level content.
---
&gt; we'd only release once jmods and players are aligned in thinking that it's ready.
---
And how would they figure that out? A poll?
---
what if it passes the first but not that second poll?
---
I'm giving that purely as an example of a skill that could offer different gameplay than existing skills.
---
Well the graphics aren't ready either so how are you going to accurately determine if it looks fun?
---
Full mystic is 150k, full rune is 130k. Not sure where you got 1.5-2x from.
---
150k *is* a middle tier price. If you can't afford that tbh you have no business pking.
---
So could almost any skill. We wouldn't vote firemaking in now, would we? 2005 was different.
---
Because no one is saying that.
---
Which is why you should vote no. It literally says if it doesn’t pass THEN they will do beta testing. Literally 0 reason to add it. I would 100% rather see it in beta before making a decision. But I will not vote for it until I see how it plays out in game. It’s a no.
---
Not really, I have it. Runescape is runescape. Besides with the way osrs copy and pastes rs3 content they will be the same soon. (prif, gambit, you name it)
---
And it would match with 3rd age.
---
But they didn't...? They are the same xp now as they were before. Just 1 more click every 28 successful pickpockets lol.
---
I've only done Sara once so I might be remembering wrong, but you can kite Zilyana right? Someone else is tanking the minions and OP can just keep running and kill Zilyana on his own.
---
well no shit
---
I blame the polling system and the fact things require 75% of the vote to pass honestly. The playerbase's intense distrust of Jagex has hurt this game in more ways than just not letting a new skill through.
---
lmao under 3000 hours.. I mean if you'd say under 1000 hours I'd say okay, but 3000 is a lot of hours
---
If everyone just voted once in their own self-interest of what they'd enjoy then whats best for the game is what has 75%+ votes because that means that 3/4 of the player base will continue to play.
---
The truth is also that its highly unlikely any new content like this will pass. Max players have a tendency to think content like this is dead(which is it to them) and they have no reason to vote yes other than to lose max cape and spend 40hrs+ on a new skill that wont service them.
---
good riddance
---
Can we get an extended cut where trump builds the wall at the wildy ditch, I think I would die laughing seeing that
---
Imagine 2 games set on the same planet having the same locationssss!!!! Tbh rs3 basically just copied fossil Island from osrs
---
that's gonna be bought with the 500m I stake that I make here lol but no fr I probably won't ever get those
---
I had one live 8 years I think   
---
   
---
RIP Nemo, you unoriginally named bastard
---
Lmfaoooo I have no dogs in this fight but that was good
---
Voted yes because this game is due or a new skill that changes the game in a positive yet OSRS like way :) and the time and effort they’ve spent on this skill makes me happy to have done so
---
wym
---
maxed a good while ago and still voting no. a 40hr buyable is not how u implement an entirely new skill
---
People complained when the set effects were better. What do you want them to do?
---
We do have a patreon, but that's just enough for hosting atm.
---
yeah level 40-50 robes costing more than twice what rune does, no thanks.  
---
I pk at revs where you die instantly from clans and I'm not giving away twice the risk every time I die just to run mystic.
---
Question 1 of the poll.
---
Everyone knows this 
---
122 though, that's a mystery
---
a lot of new players joined after f2p and mobile came out
---
Then increase the level requirement to filter out a lot of the alts?
---
Not that I would ignore warding, but you kind of can't if you want to do diaries. It'll for sure be mixed into current content.
---
Rock caking down and using absorptions will be your best bet.
---
Me too man. I am going to be so upset if it isn’t at least announced.
---
Hot and cold, light box, puzzle, etc etc. it's an insane advantage for clues but it's standard now, so there's nothing to be done about it lol.
---
Well which is it, dumbass? Do you want to play as an iron or play RuneScape with multiple people? Nitpicking faggot
---
Make it panties and we’ll talk.
---
Hopefully this might help you out, but what I did when I went for torso and wasn't confident that I could perform "up to standards" was I would start my own group and advertise asking for people that also didn't really know what they were doing/weren't that great, or simply were lower level.
---
No expectations, I could shit the bed all I wanted, and so could they. Knew going in that it probably wasn't going to be very fast, and expected some frustrations, but our rag tag crews actually managed to get some full runs in without wiping, and towards then end I was actually having fun teaching the newbies how to play the roles that I had already finished(as best as I could teach anyway).
---
Wtf is a ward
---
Well if they aren't, someone else will and they can buy it off the GE from them. Just because pvpers don't use the skill to pvp, doesn't mean they can't use what comes out of the skill from other players
---
no from me dawg
---
Yes, there would be a large amount of Vis in the game. Not only are players able to simply buy it as opposed to dissolving items themselves to obtain it, they would also be able to splash at the rune altars to get it. 
---
However, keep in mind that the rates of the acquisition of Vis from dissolving equipment and splashing, as well as the amount of Vis required to draw wards and channel specific equipment have not been specified at this time. (We only know that there will be a cost reduction for the Vis type that matches the ward type when channeling) If the skill passes, I assume that these figures would be heavily tweaked during the beta stages to avoid the scenario that you are describing above. They've mentioned that the content needs to pass the beta to be added to the real game.
---
Additionaly, Vis will be used in the Mystical Sleuthing minigame as well as a resource to hunt for moths. But, presumably, the largest use of Vis will be to repair the Battle Robe sets (Pado's, Thaumaturge, Thammaron), which I assume they expect will be widely popular, and will degrade in a similar fashion to Barrows but they'll only last for five hours instead of fifteen.
---
I'm voting no because I want Dev time to be spent on a different skill. This skill will be something I'll have to train, instead of something I'll want to train.
---
thats cool why post this
---
It’s the same concept as b0aty’s unofficial ironman before it existed as a game mode. Get a couple friends you trust not to trade with anyone outside the group
---
Fair enough
---
NSFW
---
Starting out, I did the majority of my jewelry through the ham store in like the other guy posted, after a certain point and you've collected enough games necklaces and dueling rings alch the rest for a good profit and personally, I've never had to go back after that point because the majority of my gems and jewellery is coming through slayer at this point now, whereas an awkward time in between I would have to go to the jeweler and Al kharid to buy some emeralds occasionally, but honestly you shouldn't have to do that for long. Once you can make it to the new spider boss, I believe that's where I've been getting my noted emeralds now from. Sapphires will be no problem at all, I have an overabundance of them in my bank.
---
How about a type of skill where if you don't use it the exp drops? More potential for the competition at the top.
---
https://i.imgur.com/sCyAogv.jpg.
---
I dont care either way, the only downside i see is that EVERY new content/quest after warding will 100% have a warding lvl requirement. forcing players to train this rather boring skill if they wish to participate in the new content :/
---
This is what they use on their scout bots in game
---
It was going to be removed in the original warding blog. The updated blog removed that.
---
Couldn’t upvote this hard enough. He’s a right cunt.
---
I completely agree. We won't get any significant updates that aren't PvM-related because a quarter of the playerbase doesn't want dev time put toward anything that isn't PvM.
---
Going to be good when 69% of people vote yes
---
Fuck the send her back guy.
---
Sometimes stuff gets added to the game not everybody likes. Doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be added and certainly not left to be determined by people who don’t want it in the game. That’s exactly why this logic doesn’t make sense.
---
I can't say it often enough how much I wish they'd add summoning.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Original summoning definitely had its issues with certain things being too strong, it could use some nerfs here and there, but what it can do to help balance drop tables across the board is insane.  
---
Think of how many NPCs you killed back then that you'd never have touched if they weren't shard droppers. Think of how many items had value as summoning secondary ingredients that would have otherwise been useless.  
---
Shard/Secondary drops for summoning would be such an improvement over the current drop table balancing strategy of "Increase/Decrease the alchables this thing drops".
---
In a perfect world you would take the members total worlds and their level requirement would increase by the ratio 24/23, but that would give you some ugly numbers so just round them to look nice while mostly preserving the actual skill to get to these levels
---
Add-ons =\= client
---
Get membership bro, unlocks so many things to grind towards. 
---
Also if you get membership, go for barrows gloves. Took me a while but it’s definitely a nice grind to get one of the best in slot gloves.
---
It grows every day without even trying to publicize it. Posts like this actually just get us more users. It's ironic. We've gained about 100 users since this was posted.
---
Wow what a smart troll. He’s so charismatic. I’m gonna go sub to him right now; hilarious banter.
---
I don't really know that the game would have changed that dramatically from sailing, but I wasn't playing at the time.
---
except they've known about those problems for nearly 20 years now.
---
this wasn't some lightbulb moment where jagex suddenly realized we should have a way to make magic armor like you can with melee and range.
---
hell ya brother
---
I feel what you’re saying
---
Doesn't change that they have yet to make plans for it or how dissolving 20m+ items is gonna be worth doing for shit tier armor unless you're an iron man. It would be a somewhat concrete reason to vote yes but it's like they don't even care. Not to mention how they will inevitably fuck up the balancing.
---
&gt; oh, just 1 more skill and 2400 is reasonable, 1 away is pretty soon if oyu ask me.
---
It's already been ~5.5 years since the release of OSRS and we currently have **zero** new skills. Even under the assumption that warding passes, we're probably a fair ways away from another skill.
---
Cons: No yellow text on black background
---
shoutout to all my no voting homies
---
I voted no for all
---
its basically saying do you want the skill in question 1. other questions say if this passes even if you voted no are these items ok with you in a worse case scenario and it passes
---
you can vote no to the first and skip the rest
---
I read the blogs and they actually convinced me that this skill isn't as bad as I thought... I can definitely see the argument for why we need a skill to fill the gap for the creation of mage armors... but I still have to vote no because I don't have a desire to waste millions grinding this skill to 99
---
6 Accs no here xd
---
This is a joke. Rigondeaux is actually really cool. Super addicted to Runescape also.
---
same
---
Damn that’s insane !
---
Hunter2 and hunter3
---
No I mean it breaks then you repair it like with barrows
---
How is the concept of multiple jads at once even a thing in the game? Like how can **2** jads be possible, let alone 3. What if they just decide to do different style attacks at the same time? You can only pray against one, and then what? You get fucked with nothing you could do better? Is the inferno just a big rng-fest where you have to hope they always use the same attack, or don't 1shot you?
---
good on ya son
---
Didn't know grandaddy was a scaper :')
---
They certainly won't be changing the *name* (and likely won't be overhauling the icon entirely) post-release, so it will remain as an ambiguous band-aid for game imbalances rather than an actual compelling, iconic 'skill'.
---
Which is why it's laughable when idiots say you will get banned for it.

Should of just bought out the whole eco rather then chop on 5 accounts imo would of made a lot more
---
good job brotha
---
There’s way more content than the armors, dude. Like I said, doesn’t seem like you read the whole blog. There are so many fixes to the game (ring imbues, teleport scrolls) that are way more fitting to the lore and immersion. 
---
IMO skilling isn’t fun. Never was. It’s grindy and helps unlock more “fun” content- quests, pvm, pking. 
---
You seem to be ripping on the design bc... well, it’s a skill. Helps expand the game and adds new goals to achieve but doesn’t really hold much super engaging content on its own. 
---
Just like every. Other. Skill.

I think runescape is build solely around puns, jokes, and references. And I'm cool with that.
---
Yet you're fine that people level thieving, firemaking and even smithing in minigames. Anyways the definition of minigame in osrs is very lax. Is slayer a minigame? You're doing something and getting points for it, seems like a minigame to me. Is slayer a bad skill then?
---
This isn't rocket science, make the skill, enjoyable and interactive with some form of progression and benefits to your account as a whole. Don't rely on existing resources cos you're just going to create an uneven playing field. Basically warding does none of this.
---
Lol nice job using the same bandwagon term as everyone else
---
it def feels this way when teaching people sometimes lmfao
---
That only happens with barrows gear, or the new Crystal armour coming... I was unaware this was something that happens to the mage gear that's coming...   
---
The dissolving thing is completely optional.
---
Yeah, when someone criticizes the president while being pro-American it's completely fine and to be expected however when someone decides to be anti-American while being all for another country you can't help but ask why don't they just go there?

The latter two floor sets came out legit years after the release. It had high tier rewards but not a whole 1-99 (120) breadth of bosses and challenges.
---
This is awesome lol
---
I don’t think it’s a good idea tbh, the game gets confusing when you can cosmetically enhance things.
---
Like I had no idea what sheild someone had, looked like some insane late game thing, turns out it’s a malediction ward (or) that looks nothing like the original
---
It gets confusing
---
there is a 0% chance they can't tell the effects alts have on the results.
---
One is good spirited and whimsical, the other is bad spirited and negative
---
Which is exactly why there is no issue with it coming into the game WITH the old rewards. Doesn't change the meta, just makes skilling more fun and would ensure this amazing minigame would be populated.
---
Ok, so it had high level content on release. My point was that it didn’t have a ton of content when it first dropped.
---
videogame streamers are the lowest form of life
---
Reddit, welcome.
---
Oh, it'll definitely be more than a year, but, I'd be surprised if Warding didn't take another 3-9 months to be worked on, tested, finished, and released. I'm saying they'd probably have an idea for a new skill to propose maybe a year or two after warding got released.
---
Is this with or without falador elite?
---
That explains a lot.
---
3 people are responsible for doing all the deep back end work for basically 4 games (two ports each of two games), and OSRS probably didn't have its revision control history intact to hint at why parts of the code are the way they are.
---
I have to imagine a lot of their work has been trying to get a properly understand and document of why OSRS is the way it is on the back end so that efforts to add on to it or improve it don't have horribly unpredictable results.
---
I'm poor af, I started doing BF 3 hours a day to buy bonds and fund this whole thing.

A lot of people loved dungeoneering
---
runelite isn't open source though
---
It absolutely is a cheat client, 100%. The people who decide what is cheating and what isn’t are the Jmods, they’re the ones that RuneLite goes to for approval on their more controversial plugins. If the Jmods say it’s too OP, it’s removed. 
---
RuneLite+ contains features that were removed from Runelite, at the request of Jmods, for being too cheaty. That makes it a cheat client.
---
imagine causing so much drama that you inspire half the playerbase to spite vote
---
Working hard on something does not make it quality enough to be added to the game.  You don't vote something in because you feel bad for the people who put time into it.  You should vote strictly based on whether it actually functions as a permanent, long-term improvement to the game.
---
Speaking of angry... hello idiot child! If you had actually read MY post you would understand my comments say that there are actually very few people who both have many alts(or even one alt) and are actually using them to vote. And because we are talking about a population that has variations in its, it is easily described that a good portion of that *specific* population who also balance out both sides(vote yes in the case), ESPECIALLY for a topic as polarizing as this.

Once again I state "stop being reactionary children"

Maybe people are saying for once, 'we've had enough.'

vote no to warding
---
If we vote no to warding they aren't going to make another skill, at least for a while. There just arent any ideas left that fit in with osrs.
---
Well you hit the jackpot man wish I used my head triple bank in a few weeks, is it confirmed this item even has a use for warding ?
---
Warding will fix this, vote yes in the poll!
---
The problem with adding everything from Warding into existing skills is the fact that those skills are already established. If we added magical armors to Crafting, there is absolutely no chance at all that they would be better exp/hr than existing rates like black dragonhide. This means that from the moment the new content is released, most of it will become dead content relatively quickly.
---
People are incredibly unlikely to invest the time and resources into making the lower tiers of magic armor, which is a problem because low levels have the fewest options for magic armor as of right now. This isn't a problem that can simply be solved with adding armors to combat drop tables either, because then we'd be stuck with a situation where end-game players are camping new PvM content and determining the supply of new items.
---
While I agree Warding does seem to have been started from a top-down perspective, reading towards the end of the blog with the talk of a Warding and Runecrafting guild as well as the minigame shows to me that this was a skill developed as a solution to a problem and then actually built up from there.
---
The problem with trying to introduce a new skill that's fun and makes sense in the world is that, technically, that is a contradiction. Most things that make sense in this world are mundane. We're excited by Harry Potter because it's so far out there. With the idea of the skill not being fun, Jagex seems to really have tried to add variety to the skill, even having a minigame that lets you train the skill by warding off demons. That mystical sleuthing actually sounded really neat and is most definitely an organic, unique way of training the skill. But moreso than that, with fun skills, too many people are divided on what that skill should be. We tried to get Sailing, but too many people complained that it was too much like a minigame. That begs the question, what would be a skill that is fun, capable of being seen as an entire skill of its own, and fits the Oldschool design philosophy of simplistic gameplay? When you look at all three of these design obstacles, you immediately realize it's difficult to make a skill that satisfies all three. Smithing is simple and fits as its own skill but is not fun. Slayer is fun and simple but has no reason being its own skill. Hunter isn't simple or fun but is still its own skill for some reason.
---
As far as the skill lacking unique identity goes, that's not entirely true. We can describe Warding as turning silks into armors at wards. When you think about it, Warding is Crafting with extra steps, sure, but we can also say that about Agility and Runecrafting. Agility is a skill where you follow a roughly predetermined route at a specific location to train and Runecrafting is essentially the same gameplay loop with the added step of needing essence to turn into runes. Crafting as a skill is basically a mishmash of mechanics from other skills: you can make jewellery at a furnace just like Smithing, you can stand at the bank and attach orbs to staves similar to how Herblore is trained by adding ingredients into potions ( you just stand there and click them together), or you can use a chisel on gems like using a knife on logs for Fletching. When each concept is boiled down to its most basic form, all uniqueness disappears and that's fine. The strength of this game is simple design and there's only so many ways of making bread before it all turns stale.
---
I 100% agree with you about splashing but I'm not going to vote no only because of splashing. I assume that if Warding passes and we get a beta, people will be able to voice their opinions and ask for changes to further morph the skill because right now it is still only in its baby steps of being a concept.
---
Ultimately, I like the overall idea and theme of this skill. The problem with this poll is that they're polling the overall concept with looks at things that are to come without actually having tested any of it. This makes sense because of development costs, but it does lend itself into making the skill feel inorganic in its current state. However, I do genuinely believe with enough polish, Warding could be a really good addition to the skill roster in OSRS. Feel free to disagree, however.
---
re: smithing (and mining) both need a level squash and then new additions. by the time you can make even low level items like steel and mith you're likely to be extremely beyond needing those items in game. I mean 70+ smithing for adamant items? 99...again...9-9 for rune plates? like......  
---
However, this skill is actually addressing some of your concerns, and the reality is most of the people freaking out about warding are likely to freakout about old skill reworks too.
---
How long did that take, though?  We can't vote stuff that shouldn't be in the game in on the expectation or hope that they'll eventually make it good enough to be in the game.
---
Makes me want to vote yes even more lol
---
Hence why it would be in casual mode. I can understand wanting competitive mode (still free) to be more about PvP skill
---
Nobody needs to know what you voted, do what you think is best
---
Solution:   
---
\-Allow players to merge alts on to a single account.  First character is $11, alts are \~$5 for membership.  If you already have 1 p2p character, alts get \~17 days membership from bonds up from 14.  After logging in there would be a character selection screen.    
---
 This encourages more people to make alts, with pricing set correctly increasing revenue, and decreasing cost of alts so win-win for jagex and community.  Allow up to 2 characters to be logged in at once \*only from the same IP\*.  
---
**-Give people's poll votes weight based off of 2 criteria: Total level of main, and number of alts that have membership.**    
---
**---Minimum total level gives you a vote weight of one, while maximum total level gives your vote a weight of 4.  Having at least 1 alt that is actively p2p can increase vote weight to a maximum of 5.**    
---
Total level of main carries the most weight, but having multiple paid characters can also add some weight.
---
That not entirely true. If it’s extremely rare it’ll hold some value. Yeah it’s like 1/256 from an elite or something there will be a fuck ton of them but if its as rare or rare than 3a, it’ll have value. There will always be some rich fucker who wants to prove he’s richer and is willing to spend for it.
---
Dorgesh-kaan rich chests at 78 is ~260k xp an hour and a lot more chill. You can swap between mobile and PC every ~20 worlds to get around the hop limit.
---
Yet they keep putting time in blog posts and other shit.   They are trying to sell us a new skill that they haven't even dived into yet.   Makes sense, in typical Jagex fashion.
---
thats probably not true. inexperienced players outnumber experienced players, they change the game, then they leave because they still aren't having fun. the experienced players who liked the game already suffer.

Hi, does anyone who plays on a laptop know how to rotate the camera without using the arrow keys, but with the touchpad? I've tried using 2 fingers but that doesn't work. Pinch works to zoom, but I don't know if there's a way to move the camera.

I doubt he uses his hands.  Inject lube into crease then jiggle to completion.

Your words not mine, but I'll settle for self aware pre-teen

They'd take feed back from the beta. Probably poll the changes that get offered by the community, then go from there.

Imagine sailing to what feels like an infinate ammount of islands (due to islands being computer generated) in order to stock up on resources, fight plagues of npcs, ect. Having to actually navigate and defend yourself from krakens on the way. All for awesome rewards.
---
Sounds more like a minigame to me. But it's still better than another bank standing skill.
---
I would rather see a skill fully developed and understood on release, than a completely missed opportunity because people aren't happy with what they see long before trying it out...
---
Whether it's confirmed or not, the price tripled in the last three hours. I'm getting the Bitcoin jitters, I don't know whether to dump or ride the market.
---
Yeah, we have 3 crafting skills. We call them Crafting, Smithing, and Fletching. What's so wrong about wanting a fourth?
---
Or there should be a rune that is all runes combined etc. That can only be used inside the portal
---
good idea but probably engine work tbh
---
1924 here voted yes
---
I'm not sure it works that way. I thought the loot was predetermined.
---
Sit.

Saw this on your channel, I was wondering if you would post this here
---
yeah I'm about that  
---
love seeing people at arceuss essence mine complaining about a new skill like bruh

You know the total level world requirement will go up by about 50 levels right?

absolutely based

Who and who?

what gold sink comes from spending 50 gp to repair bronze armour? who wants to go through that hassle
---
I'm confused, is it impossible not be selfish with 3000 hours played
---
I like this idea.
---
You need to use regular antifire and pray ranged.
---
You're amazing!
---
That was his point.  Training a new skill up to that XP, rather than getting that much more XP spread across many already high-leveled skills, may be much more tedious.
---
Frankly, everything you've said so far just makes it seem like you prefer the mechanics/logic of other (totally unrelated, not-at-all canon) works of fiction to the lore of Runescape.
---
It's all fine and good if things work on way in some other game or book, but none of those rules apply unless the curator(s) of the work decides that they do.
---
I like how it's cool and totally acceptable to encourage yes votes but not no votes.
---
Game integrity update in 3.. 2...
---
Well just commenting "voting no" is unprecedented. Id also downvote somebody who just said "voting yes." Its like okay, but was there a point to saying that? It contributes nothing to the conversation so its gonna have to take my downvotes.
---
Wow thanks for the info. So, if I’m understanding this correctly, runelite just switches the order or priority in which click options populate? So like for example if I right clicked on a person follow could be the first option, listed above “walk here”?
---
I do use runelite. Any other examples of where they do this? Just curious.
---
Orange man bad! Reeeeeeeee! Your wife’s boyfriend would be proud.
---
&gt; but I still have to vote no mostly because I don't have a desire to waste millions grinding this skill to 99
---
So I guess you are quitting the game then? Surely you don't want to spend millions grinding existing skills either?
---
on the otherside of pvp ur gunna have the good pvpers using dagon hai
---
vote no gamers rise up
---
Yeah that Omar cunt is pretty fucking dumb.
---
Oh shit you right
---
Then vote no to dagonhai
---
Most are pretty chill guys
---
You're damn right.
---
There's a reason ironman mode wasn't nearly as popular until the official game mode came out. Theres no competition or bragging about unofficial group ironman mode because it's so easy to cheat.
---
skip the first question and vote no to the rest for the lols
---
TLDR
---
Did you get this from my Twitter
---
&gt;And? Remove functionality that allows them to be plugged in. There's always flags you can disable when adding in plugins.
---
I'm not sure you understand how these clients function.
---
They're Open Source - i.e. anyone can view the source code, copy it, and then change it however they want to. There's no way to 'remove the functionality that allows plugins' when all of the client code is public.
---
Sure, I'm guessing that's why you dropped by then.
---
Did you not read the top comments of this thread? There are actually good arguments against it.
---
NMZ will not be dead content even with no rewards as it is one of best xp/h afk traning.
---
I like your skull idea. I’m not really a fan of changing the meta on cape slots in PvP or the boost to weapons. I was thinking of just having some way to symbolize how much of the mini game you’ve completed with a simple cosmetic item(s).

Yeah at least you got them from playing the game tho.

Oh, you mean Shovel and Ice-Pick-to-the-Head?

---
That's what made sailing so appealing to me. Warding doesn't add any new gameplay really, just the same thing you do with crafting. Bank standing and buying supplies to finish yet another skill doesn't sound that appealing, I can just start new accounts and do crafting again.
---
Would've been funnier if it was the fourth poll D:
---
It says alternative method meaning if you don’t want to ward to imbue your rings then just nmz ?
---
Yes and thats 100% fine, but i dont think its fine for an item this strong coming from a skill itself. After all the skill needs to fix OSRS and be inline with other skills. No other skills flat out give the best gear and i believe that should be the same with Soulbark.  
---
Ofc changes will happen due to the Beta phases of warding if it pass's but i still care for the overal health of the game.
---
Im a non pker vo votes no to pvp polls and hates warding so thanks for the votes
---
I want warding itself to pass but these do seem a bit strong. Even if warding and the armour all passed, I'm sure they would rebalance if the gameplay felt off or the outcry was big enough. Which it probably would be! Thanks for pointing it out though, because the links in the poll aren't very useful without a frame of reference
---
Wow 430 upvotes
---
You are worried about nothing. If you got your 2fa set up there should be no problem, random people using random ip's won't get into your account if you got 2fa on your email and account
---
Even if the majority votes yes let's be real 75% of the playerbase isnt voting yes. I'd love warding mainly for the new mage gear but I highly doubt it passes.
---
Exactly! So it's not just me right? Not sure why it's on the wiki.
---
No problem! My bank has started flagging them as fraud recently too.
---
7gp per xp. Not bad
---
s
---
Agreed!  I can't get behind it because the name and icon are too unfitting and ambiguous/vague, tbh, but I'd be much more open to the skill if they renamed it 'Enchanting' or something similar, which actually has an obvious, immediate compelling nature to master (Ah, you can become a master Enchanter or Enchantress), as well as updating the icon to be something...vaguely recognizable, at least.  (Like an enchanted bolt of cloth, perhaps?)
---
this is why we can't have nice things... and new skills.
---
good thing a majority of people dont farm barrows strictly for resale, most people doing barrows are either mid mains or ironmen.
---
A bond is Jagexs way to combat RWT and allow players to purchase membership with in game currency. Each bond is $7/4M and is good for 2 weeks of membership.
---
should be changed to 2300 then.
---
Yes that is indeed true, but it will lower the base skill cap.... which is a double edged sword.
---
I don't want to have ANOTHER skill that is very similar to other skills that I have to grind all the way to 99...........I actually want to get a max cape one day dude and this is going to be an obstacle in my path
---
FUCK YOU I'M CIVILIZED. VOTE NO ON WARDING CAUSE I DON'T LIKE IT REEE
---
lolwut
---
honestly the devs have been trying to kill nightmare zone for awhile as they mainly in agreement that it was a mistake to add to the game
---
Yea I'd agree. Removal of Wildy and squeel of Fortune were also writings on the wall.
---
Why do people like this always threaten to move to an MMO that has literally fucking nothing to do with RuneScape
---
its an alternative way to imbue equipment
---
go here to see their EXACT detailing on imbue and the skill as a whole. I have a feeling 99% of people voting did not read this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ajsIsDCOkYgiGgfEbNi2E1GTMNGSLu6Y/view
---
the highest level you will need is 69 to imbue the ring of suffering.
---
this sub can't handle that reality, which is why they still vote for easyscape.
---
good player, i think ive only killed you once and you’ve killed me many times. I’ve won 22 games out of probably 150 or 200 played.
---
You said the reason to vote no. It's an unfun, buyable, bank stand. I dont want that.
---
Without because i am a waste of space.
---
as a max cape, if you think the 40hrs to 99 warding worries me at all you arewrong, i have 47m rc exp smh.
---
This is really sweet of you.
---
Imbuing would probably be a better name,
---
So everyone is supposed to know all the games that exist too?
---
3000 is a lot... like a lot lot. I have over 3k hours and I think thats maybe way too much lol
---
i do its called osrs
---
Only once every few years good content is created. Everything thing now is about some stupid swamp man who handicaps him self for “fun” thanking for creating a masterpiece.
---
TriHard 7
---
Have you not considered that more content and skills would be healthy for the game? If not for you, then for other players which also greatly impacts your virtual adventures.
---
I just think it's a boring skill. Do we need another crafting/fletching/herblore?
---
I honestly don't see the point of Astral. I would have expected it to be a better offensive magic set, but instead, it seems pretty outclassed by Bloodbark. Soulbark does seem like a pretty nice set though.
---
Those people are getting phished and giving away their auth/bank pin.
---
pretty sure hes the guy who just never bothered to train slayer lol
---
Rs3 Refugees are all posting these Yes to Warding posts. OP made his first post two weeks ago...
---
Kingdom's pretty catchy. And don't forget In The Pits.
---
Or for nostalgia points, how has nobody mentioned Harmony yet? Or Garden? Medieval? Fanfare? Those were my *childhood*, man.
---
Open Source doesn't mean shit if you don't understand what's going on with the code anyway.
---
Yeah, somewhere between strange and cool.  I do kind of like the idea of it paying tribute to the world expansions of both games at once.  Especially since it was never the world changes that made me dislike RS3, it was EoC, MTX etc.
---
&gt; idc if you release the skill just dont release any of it's content
---
Basically it sounds to me like you don't have many skills in the 90's or play frequently enough to even understand how fucking niche this shill would even be.
---
Does this on my s10. I dont mind though
---
More like -5 IQ move
---
mystic isn't expensive but there's no real reason to risk it because the difference isn't that big.
---
if you run into someone whos ranging with black dhide then your mystics is just as useless as those "salad robes"
---
It's weird but I kinda feel what he's saying.
---
Shareholders is what you're looking for
---
Oh that's cool I didn't know you were a scientist, better leave you to your thoughts then sir.
---
I didnt know that if that game is real or not lol. It very could be. I remember playing one type of LotR mmorpg, so I assumed he meant that game.
---
Takes you to the florist shop
---
Voted yes for the cause
---
it really wont lower the skill cap all that much as most of the skill in pvp is prediction and fast/accurate clicks. If anything it increases the skill cap by weakening rng reliant kills like maul and ags
---
I feel somewhat similar, but the name and icon are just too vague to me.  That's not a minor point.  The skill would do much better to be something like 'Enchanting', despite the overlap with magic.  Becoming a master Enchanter/Enchantress is much more compelling than becoming a master 'warder'.
---
You're not getting it... Normal magic gear is enchanted; that is what makes it magic gear. I don't think there is a single example you can point to of magic gear that has no enchantment or such to it. You are just claiming magic gear isn't magical because you don't understand RuneScape Lore and are assuming it is the same as general fantasy lore; it is not.
---
Hopefully it provides more content than bank standing. Also probably going to be expensive as fuck to just max it out a few days after launch
---
I thought it was very good. 
---
Almost like it's subjective or something
---
This is how our dev team streamline whatever content they want. Like no one asked for a new skill and here we have it, no one asked for Zeah either and we got that too which was mainly unfinished garbage when it was released. I’m not going to let Jagex streamline their own content.
---
Oh wow that’s pretty awesome. Something to save up for then haha
---
A game which has been getting very positive reviews recently.
---
If you don't know the content creator and can't guess their whole back story from a picture of a tweet, you'd have no idea it's sarcastic.
---
If this was the WoW subreddit and a similar tweet was posted but substitute LOTRO with Runescape, it'd be a similar thing.
---
im sure they would rebalance the sets as thats what the beta's are for. And no proplem the reason i made these was so people could have a point of reference because even i needed one.
---
lol. my account is less than a year from 15 year cape woo
---
Just overall it kind of just seems like an unneeded change to me. Idk.

As we speak, I have my 99ers logging in on their alts, processing the votting polls, so are we have 8,230 registered No Votes.

We are currently recuriting new players from rs3, and we are averaging paying about 15k-65k per vote on no to Warding. 
---
See the CC: 99ers, if you want to get paid we are raffling 20 bonds, and dragon claws, by Lynx Titian.
---
The poll is still up for 5 more days and NA hasn’t even gotten off work yet. Plus stop trying to reveal results. Remember everyone screeching for hidden pill results?
---
I'm a max player, only play 1 hour a day max now that IRL has gotten busy, I will lose max cape if this passes but still voted yes because I feel like its important to keep the game growing.
---
and its not my original main account either. lmao.
---
I voted no 8 times ! :D
---
yeah i second questing and diaries. They unlock a lot of cool stuff and areas of the game. I also really enjoy slayer, you get to the point where you can make good profit on tasks.
---
This opinion bothers me as no one wants new training methods to devalue existing ones. I don’t understand how these people want the content added to existing skills.
---
I voted yes.
---
lol agree!!!
---
First frame: Crab puzzle room , probably the longest to explain — in this room, there’s a little device that shoots orbs. Your job is to deflect the orbs to hit certain colored crystals in the room; to achieve this you lure and stun the crabs to help aim, and you use a specific combat style to change the color of said crab, and when the orb hits they crab it will take that color. In the comic, the other party member  had already lined up the crabs and aimed the correct color orb (Red orb -&gt; Cyan crystal) but Prez, while he is trying to help, inadvertently gets in the path of the orb and not only is blocking it, but you will take damage if you, the Player get hit by it.
---
Panel 2: tightrope puzzle room — pretty easy, you just cross a tightrope to get a keystone. You’re supposed to kill the rangers and mages guarding it first though because if you try to tank it, the damage will just stack as the tightrope animation plays, and they hit pretty hard even through prayer so you risk dying. Prez does exactly what you’re not supposed to do.
---
Panel 3: Muttadile room — there’s a lite gator creature called muttadiles, there is a small version and a large version. After the small one is killed you’re supposed to stand by a certain safe spot corner next to the pond for when the bigger one larger comes out, because if you’re in melee range, it will do a shockwave attack that does massive damage. Prez decides to boldly attack it with melee, which...well...isn’t very clever.
---
I’m not *the* most experienced raider as humorously pointed out in the comic, so I may have missed a few things but I hope it’s enough to be clear to follow the panels :)
---
"Voted yes due to freedom of choice"??
---
what kind of title is that rofl
---
At some point yes, but warding is rushed and dumb.
---
they heeded tons of criticism before they finalized the blog and they stated theyre prepared to go through multiple betas until the skill is fine tuned to its best potential for release.
---
what you've said is simply untrue.
---
It was a hard crash. No error,  No login screen.
---
There is no way they will be changing the exp rates, just the last months they have been reducing the exp from several activities because they turned out to be even just slightly higher than polled.
---
And when has the community not passed a new minigame providing great exp and fun? Volcanic mine, blast mine are both two great ways to level mining. Wintertodt is pretty much the goto method for leveling firemaking. Underwater fishing and agility are pretty much the most efficient ways. Herbivores are one of the most popular ways to train hunter. Blood and Soul runecrafting are hugely popular for training runecrafting.
---
The list goes on...
---
go to sleep warding!
---
At your level lobsters start becoming a bit obsolete,m. Consider switching to swordfish (you can use half an inventory of each if you want to save money). 
---
Teleporting is a waste of inventory space unless you go deep wildy. It’s also frowned upon (if you care about that).
---
You mentioned right clicking: make sure to check your settings to always enable left click attacking. 
---
Consider getting your ranged level up, or get even higher str.
---
Nice try, tinder was released in 2012

turns out to have been more like a small loan of more than 400m gp, still small tho

All max cape cucks dont want the skill added xd
---
Remember there are people here that think tanky mage armour is a good thing lmao
---
Not all heroes wear capes, ill be voting no on 7 accounts brother.
---
What the fuck? That’s his vote.
---
Well a skip is basically a skip so I’m fine with that
---
But same actually I think, aren't we sad people
---
LMAO they took it down immediately after you posted it? OK buddy.
---
warding bad

Can you not read or?!

Fuck off back to rs3. We play a medieval children's clicking game and you play a medieval children's treasure chest opening game. You have offered zero insight to anything going on in this community which you are not even a part of.

Well, the wiki link you originally posted was for the old wiki, the new wiki does not have that page, so I wouldn't go off of that page.

Sparcy is that you

Yeah you keep thinking they have no way to detect third party clients...
---
Weird flax but ok
---
soul wars
---
I enjoy combats, slayer, volcanic mine, black chin hunting and wildy alter prayer. I don't mind bank standing skills although I definitely don't enjoy doing them. I'm pretty confident with what I would like from a new (and old) skill. I just want an engaging method I can do with my friends, which is probably why I enjoy the above skills. I just want some kind of boss or activity which is doable with friends OR akin to pvm, as those are the things I enjoy with the game. I wasn't around when sailing was proposed but I probably would've preferred it. Also I'm not opposed to the idea of warding at all, I just want training it to be fun.
---
u obviously dont read reddit.com
---
This hits home
---
Lavas is the best exp from 23 until 99. Although up to level 50 you should really quest/lamp/tears of guthix your way there.
---
When it fails (likely since just 1 "no" cancels 3 "yes" responses) this place is going to get very angry and sad responses. 
---
I don't see any skills ever passing a 75% poll. A new skill, no matter how good, will *always* be too decisive to be added to OSRS. That sucks imo, but that's just they way the polling system works. Maybe the passing %'s could be lowered in the future to like 70 or 65. Who knows

The Gower brothers want this in their game... I think the only way they'll get that is if the polls are 75% yes, or they force it, and they wont force it... This isn't their game anymore.
---
Ok I notice on my first trip I was the only melee, everyone was ranged then 2h. If I want to continue f2p pvp I need to get range I guess?
---
If I switch to p2p pvp how would I best convert this toon to p2p?
---
Tbh I think jagex needs to make this decision on their own. Fuck the polling system. It's fucking up the game growth. Jagex wants to grow their game bit the butthurt community and their "devaluing" accounts so they say no to everything. Fuuuuck. Just let jagex do something to the game so it can fucking grow. Idc what skill they want to add. It'll bring in a lot of new players and old players coming back
---
U r butt.
---
Chymistry or WeDoRaids discord can probably carry you for one kc
---
I added you (:
---
Nah everyone uses it bro, wed know by now if they’re hacking. Change all ur passwords and enable 2FA tho they have your email at least
---
Warding gud
---
Context?
---
It's not a change though, it's a random addition that makes a current annoying process a little bit easier. You can still run to the guy in the abyss
---
no 3rd party client is 100% safe and as such aren't endorsed by jagex
---
Nobody is infallibly logical no matter how much they want to stroke their egos. Feelings inevitably play a role in how people form opinions.
---
Shit
---
Dunno about out of touch. It was a suggested, upvoted suggestion for the same effect to be added to firemaking a while back, apparently.
---
Perhaps I missed some information, but there is no way in hell that 99 any skill is going to be 30 hours. And if it is, it's either absurdly expensive, or it doesn't deserve to be a skill. We don't need another buyable crafting skill, and we certainly don't need one that can be easily obtained in 30 hours.
---
yeah i know what they are i've just never seen this many of them in one world before
---
The reddit salt mines are churning as usual, imagine complaining so hard about such an obvious joke
---
Lol, ok. Whatever you say dipshit. Take your L and go.
---
I like your style.
---
just play a vanilla private server then
---
Rig is a kid who flaunts his parents wealth as his own.  Don’t expect much from him
---
Use any third party client at your own risk. I personally have been using it since launch and nothing has happened to me yet. I suspect you have a virus or have downloaded the wrong runelite version make sure it’s only from runelite.NET nothing else anything else is a fake. If I was you just wipe your computer flat clean and start over with a new account if the account isn’t old and is new with low stats.
---
risking 20x as much as he would if he thought there was a chance he'd die, which was the point fuck head.
---
They gave me a link that is supposed to block the other email from getting my passwords, but guess what? All it did was send the hacker new login information. I will not likely get the account back because I can't sign into it. The only time people get their accounts back is when there's enough public outrage.
---
gonna finish up the few recs left for morytania and kandarin hard, barrows for gp, and finally get a fire cape
---
after that i have zero idea
---
Steaming garbage take.
---
And huge stacks of runes. Like idiots.
---
Seems like salad robes aren't doing much.
---
warding gud
---
&gt; some votes are more valuable
---
I can agree on the premise that certain types of poll questions should have a requirement related to it for a player to even vote on it.
---
Warding
---
Actual facts.
---
Yes, exactly. But it goes further than that - since it's the first menu option you can just left click to execute, in your example 'follow'. 
---
Some other examples I can think of are banking at actual bankers (not just the bank booths which are already one-click), many 'Travel' options with NPCs like Fossil Island and the Rellekka islands, and the Pyramid Plunder mummy to 'Start Minigame'. There are a ton of other menu entry swaps that RL implements but I can't list them all. If you go into the RL settings and search for the MenuEntrySwapper plugin, you should find a decent list of them.
---
This could literally be fucking anything lol.
---
Maybe I did, where are they?
---
You're a dumbass if you think they don't take that into account.
---
You used runelite+ trying to be slick. Serves you well
---
Just keep all they're nats on them.... can make bank sometime
---
No reason to be toxic about it now. I am seeing a similar comment more and more. Its honestly more toxic than the individuals who automatically vote no. Ask and attempt to reason with those you have disagreements with. Don't hive mind like them.
---
Yeah that's only for pickpocketing
---
Because jagex gives about 2 fucks, u can bot for a week straight before u will be even detected or banned.
---
Hell the minow bots and zulrah bots hell even pyramid plunder at this point run for weeks on weeks even months meanwhile more bots are being created in the nightmare zone
---
At this point if jagex ever does a bot nuke like they did back in the day the economy would implode because im confident majority of the supplies and items being brought in are by bots.
---
were more than likely to get some of the content from future updates like when sailing and artisan failed. However there is a very slim chance of it going to rc

I'm afraid I'm hoarding those for the apocalypse. I wish you a wonderful day, and an enjoyable apocalypse!

Yeah I switched low detail on shortly before the update, and thought that might have been the problem. But even when that plug-in is disabled, the roofs still don't appear.

If you've got Iban's blast (or better), Barrows is probably the best mid-level combat money maker.

Trump is literally the embodiment of the dude that started playing OSRS fairly early, got a loan of 400m, bought a PHAT with it because he likes seemingly stupid purchases, gets super lucky they get discontinued and rise up to 2b
---
now he's a "billionaire" who is constantly losing money in other flips (he would be the guy who buys seeds in bulk on release) but can still bankstand and show off his money bc of the phat
---
I hear this a lot, so what... we can't have lore based skills? We have one, it's Runecrafting. It's main purpose is to make the stuff that powers magic... all magic, not just combat spells, every spell in the game. It also sets up what the world of Runescape magic is, and how it works. 
---
So any skill related to Magic in the game, is most likely going to be lore based, because that's how it works in the game. Warding is like Crafting yeah sure it has a lot of elements that fit with crafting... but it's magic based... it takes elements from the lore of the game and applies it to Magic based gear. So what's one more creation skill? There's a lot of things in the game that wouldn't make sense if created in other skills, because it doesn't follow the lore of the game. There are other things the skill offers that wouldn't fit with other skills.
---
"Each poll will run for a duration of one week". Current poll is open 5 days... I wish they were more consistent about the length of Dev Blogs and Polls.
---
I'm voting yes to spite the smug people on Twitter.
---
But Ma always told me to always the truth
---
He said AFK magic experience. Points on herb boxes? Wut.
---
No it certainly should not haha. Example. Let’s says I have 8 personalities. Can I vote with each one? 4 of them are straight up garbage. The other 4 are murderers.

---
Was just looking for something like this the other day. I really like LMS even though I just started and am fucking terrible at it lol. After a couple hours I improved from getting clapped immediately to either winning first round or at least putting up a decent fight
---
You can't compare bursting with NMZ afk. NMZ is so AFK to the point of clicking a few times every 20-25 min.
---
I’m gonna vote yes to it because I’d like a new skill and something new to do, but if y’all want to vote no that’s okay too
---
Can we have the second half of this video have Woox pvm thanos?
---
For real, I voted no because I think it's a stupid idea for a skill. IMO all of the shit we're going to get from warding could just be applied to existing skills, the whole thing seems like they just really want a new skill regardless of how much sense it makes.
---
There are many skills that aren't enjoyable to train for most people, so I don't find that to be a particularly strong argument against it.
---
5.4k KC here for mine, if someone genuinely said that to you, they were probably joking. Phoenix is the rarest skilling pet to get 1-99.

There are no features in it that can get you macro bans
---
thanks posts like these keep the subreddit in check
---
Yeah everybodys jumping to conclusions as to what this is about but its pretty vague. Personally i dont have the slightest idea what this is about
---
I care, and you should vote no.
---
here we have an insta normie stealing reddit content in the wild

Well if the Java update doesn't help on Catalina, I doubt it will make any difference on 10.14.5.

I have found a couple reports of what sounds like the same type of freezing without any mention of OSRS, but it seems very rare outside of ORSS players.
---
Did you ever get a single crash using the Windows client in Parallels? I was thinking about trying the Windows client with WineHQ instead as a possible workaround.
---
The lack of any error logs for diagnoses/reporting coupled with the intermittent nature really make this the absolute worst kind of bug possible. I can't seem to reproduce the crash in any reliable fashion. Two times today I tried watching a Twitch stream while running four clients of OSRS and could not get a freeze, but I've had seven freezes so far and all of them have been with OSRS running plus some sort of video.
---
I absolutely dread having to go back to High Sierra. It will probably take me two days just to reinstall and reconfigure everything. This issue has made me lose almost all of my faith in Apple and I'm really considering ditching my Mac altogether instead of bothering with reverting to an OS that's soon to be two versions outdated.

/u/vreddit_bot
---
Cool name and cool tag. But actually you’re forgetting about the gold sink which is the main reason I voted yes (not max but 2200 total world elite gamer)
---
Wha-
---
Neckbeards are the people who are maxed and therefore have a lot of GP you spastic therefore they will be able to afford to buy multiple bonds to vote on their Alts and the reason they don’t want warding is due to the fact that their max cape will be removed. Now stop wasting me time
---
This made me vote yes.
---
The people voting on their alts spend more money, it doesn't matter if that's in the form of bonds because on Jagex's end those count as subscriptions. 
---
It's like stocks. You have 1 stock in a company your opinion on what choices that company makes is pretty meaningless to them. But you have 10% of all the stocks, now you're important to that company. 
---
People with alts have more stock. Votes for content are business decisions because it determines what Jagex spends money on to develop. The voting system is designed with the players being the shareholders.
---
The ban was literally labelled macro/3rd party client ban
---
Surely you can see that there is limited dev time and providing a full beta on something that may be shot down is a complete waste of time? Surely you noticed that the Devs have taken community feedback and already have made drastic changes to Warding?
---
How the fuck do people think this is serious?
---
And how the fuck do some people not know LOTRO even exists?
---
You could. I guess you can break warding down into a "dissolve" spell that uses runes and obtains essence and an "enchant" spell that uses essence and obtains enchanted armour.
---
who said anything about assuming what you voted my man?
---
Id love to see the reddit vs ingame poll results and how close or far away they are
---
DH helm too :/
---
sounds great implementing it right now
---
That’s the best mentality with these kind of people
---
Even “your account was logged out” would be better lol
---
Yeah I have no idea how people got the idea they're forcing it into the game. If Jagex REALLY wanted to force it into the game, they would just add it in without polling it ever. 
---
But instead are using the polling system that they put in place for it's purpose.
---
i have no strong feelings one way or the other.
---
You do see how that's bad for the game right?
---
Me: Hey what position can I play????
---
Team: left-right-out
---
Well, if you want to maintain old runescape, I'm going to have to ask you to give up raids.  I'm going to have to ask you to give up ever going to kourend again.  I'm going to have to ask you to put down the blowpipe.  No more Dihn's at all.  Bounty Hunter, gone.  Don't even think of going to revs.  No more kraken.  Inferno, better not touch that.
---
This game isn't even *close* to what it was in 2007.  We've gone through so many updates that the game is practically unrecognizable now to someone from 2007.
---
You want to know the last couple skills added to the game before 2007?  Farming and Slayer.  Two of the best skills in the game.  And Slayer was about as garbage as it could get, all you did was literally get told to go kill x monsters.  Remember how MMOs had those quests where you were told to just go kill a bunch of some monster and then come back?  Those quests are pretty shit.  That was Slayer.  That was all it was.  And look at what it is now, a cornerstone of the game.  Would OSRS even be half of what it is without Slayer?
---
But yeah, we totally are going to ruin the game by adding another skill, yeah /s
---
So...you want us to lie?
---
Good riddance, those two are the most obnoxious content creators for this game.
---
Does anyone still goes to that place anymore?
---
Yeah it’s new as of Thursday update
---
Shoutout to docxm
---
Holy shit is this real?
---
What's going on with warding? Seems like reddit was against it last week and now I see memes for it now
---
50 50 50
---
It’s honestly quite sad that people so vocal are that uninformed. Sometimes I really can’t tell if they’re just memeing, or if they legitimately think that a “reddit consensus” on a topic is equivalent to an in game poll result

&gt;why does everyone think reading it will automatically make them vote yes?
---
Lmao. Nothing funnier than two fat asses ruining their countries.
---
Ayeeeee
---
what plugin did you use?  Some plugins literally come with warnings say "use at risk".
---
I dont have a nostalgic online game so I cant really give myself as a example. And ruining? I believe its a much needed gap for Magic armours. Even if it gets rejected I want the mage armour to be added
---
Just wanted to share with my mates on Discord, just linked the YouTube video when the bot didn't work :/
---
Think it was zulrah
---
I'm confused, I thought this was an upgrade to the elemental one - meaning you'd have the rune pouch as well (i.e. 7 runes for 2 inventory slots). Or am I wrong?
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
No I just don't think it's funny
---
Haha 5 rune dragon Alts for max profit. An iron and an hard core plus a noob ultimate for the gigs and 2 pures one med and one 1 def my maxes main plus I’m sure I can make one more and grind it up in time so maybe only 9 but close buddy. Wish it wasn’t just 25% to fail and it was more of a 50/50
---
It’s so founded
---
I feel like a lot of it starts as jokes but then others out of the loop see that and take it as fact. Like I saw something earlier about a content creator saying he'd change games if warding came out, but supposedly he was joking. Yet not everyone who saw that may have realized it was a joke and it might have influenced some votes as a result.

No, I think RuneScape has a good niche as is and if people aren't up for the grind there are myriad other games.  I don't want my experience ruined because a bunch of whiners want everything handed to them
---
I would be 100% in favor of a system that guarantees one vote per player, but that would be almost impossible to achieve. I voted on both of my alts because everyone else will, and "doing the right thing" will disadvantage my position. Unfortunately, it's a consequence of having both player run polls and alts being allowed. You can't blame the players.
---
&gt; Such as the shitty as fuck lost on death interface??? 
---
What's wrong with it?
---
&gt; Or no XP/hr tracker?
---
If you're into EHP or efficiency-scape or whatever, yeah I can see that being a nice feature. I just play for fun and don't really care what my XP per-hour is.
---
&gt; Loot tracking for screenshots?
---
If it's of importance to myself, I just hit Alt + Print Screen. Not really sure why I'd need it to be automated.

He can be funny and he is decent at Pking so he's definitely watchable, plus people like watching him build (and lose) bank in the sand casino.
---
That’s why you put it behind a tree in the clan wars red portal :^) #goodtimes
---
We shall see indeed
---
Correct, but less restricted. So I can maybe set up my personal bank for quickly doing vorkath or something like that, but overall save bank space
---
Well since the current primary argument against warding is that it doesn’t add enough to the game, I’d say that jagged saying they will continue to build on it is pretty relevant.
---
Fun fact: Trump is the first president to step onto North Korean territory, and has done more to gain peace with them than any other US president. 
---
Also, this gfy is very well done and funny as hell.
---
Why is this not on the front page? This is amazing
---
Reading a post and commenting on it = enlightened lol. And source on the lynx comments about warding?
---
If he couldn't secure funding with his party in control of the house, Senate, and executive branch, it's never gonna happen. What policy decisions has he made that have worked exactly?
---
Wrong answer. Voteing
---
Is this a way to combat bots or something? Frankly I can’t remember what it was like before I just know I don’t like it..
---
Yup, you got me. Sorry I am too busy to write a educational book on why. Check out Misplaceditems's website, and compare those details with content launches through the wiki's annual update timeline that links you straight to the OSRS blog.
---
Again, I am currently busy coding out a new bot, and don't have time to hold your hand. Good luck!
---
You dont buy rl+ it is free. It's as free as runelite. The dude you are talking about probably botted zulrah using a paid bot script and used runelite as an excuse. Those bots are caught very frequently.
---
the reason why vampyric vambraces failed is the fact that it would make the blowpipe better than the twisted bow. Also the fact that anything that increases range dps any more than its already at will not pass because of the blowpipe and any content put into the game has to be balanced around this one item with how OP it is
---
Really makes you think, lmao
---
Right on brother. The only thing that matters is vote or die.
---
Bless you if true, although I dont think it is.
---
Looks like a throwaway twitter account anyway, no profile pic.

Seems legit.
---
Gz on long bone
---
Is there a comprehensive guide to brutal black dragons? Like void vs blessed dhide, ruby e vs diamond e bolts? Maybe cost effectiveness of each bolt dragon or regular enchanted bolts?
---
It's a lot stronger then it looks. The moment something would become profitable to disassemble, there would be thousands of people and probably 10x that amount of bots doing it. People were saying the same about RS3's invention skill with a similar mechanic, but that skill did wonders for the economy.
---
Definitely not to foght bots becaus bos can log you back in, seems like a bug
---
Those dont get temp bans either do they?
---
Hang on a sec what if warding genuinely isn’t good for the game? Where’s ya clever Reddit post for that
---
This made me laugh too damn hard. Thanks.
---
This is wardings first poll you downie.
---
This should be bannable
---
Before declaring that explain how it is genuinely bad for the game or good for the game?
---
if grinding skills doesn't entice you why tf you play this game?
---
doing repetitive, monotonous skills IS the game
---
People like you want the game to die.
---
Family Crest requires 59 mage, my man.
---
this shit just never gets old for you toxic little shits does it?
---
Honestly anyone who votes in favor of warding should just go play Runescape 3, it has all the new skills you want and more. Anyone who played Runescape back in 2007 or before knows what happens when new things are added to the game, it can start to take on a new direction it cannot come back from. The game is and was always perfectly fine without warding, still plenty to do for the overwhelming majority of the player base.
---
Apologies, I must have misunderstood you. When you said that warding is going to influence item prices due to the item sink and other factors, it seemed like a negative view on it.
---
To be honest I'm not sure the extent that they're considering the item sink, and yah if it's just basic items it won't be good enough. I'm not sure Warding *should* be an item sink for every type of item - either each crafting skill should have its own use for breaking down items, or Warding should be able to affect gear from the types that it can break down, in some fashion. In this case, Warding would be more in line with Enchanting in other games, really. I don't know if that's good for the game or not though, that may just introduce even more power creep. I just don't see it making much sense being able to break down melee gear to craft magic armor.
---
If Warding *does* go this way, I guess that makes it more in line with Divination from RS3 doesn't it? I never played RS3 so I don't know for sure, but from what I've heard that's the idea. While items like the tentacle whip is a great idea, it doesn't work for everything in the game. I also don't think it's the right choice to make every higher tier item in the game operate this way. With any luck, this section of Warding may see some changes from our feedback. 
---
I don't know that any scaling back they did is set in stone - it seems to have been done more to calm some of the reactionary rage from the previous blog post about it. If it passes and comes to beta, hopefully they'll consider looking at things like that again.
---
Well all banks are personal. I think an armory in the POH is a step in the right direction. Then maybe a medicine cabinet and fridge. Just throwing ideas out there
---
Surprised Trey doesn't have a K-pop or anime avatar.
---
Out of the loop, what is item sink and how can it help the game? I don't think inflation has hit osrs too badly why is it needed?
---
By bad. Still OP :)
---
It's hard for them to not focus on developing it over other content when it's a buyable and therefore creates a direct incentive for whales to pour more money into buying bonds. But even tho the community very evidently doesn't trust Jagex at all no one is talking about how big of an issue that is.
---
u/Vredditdownloader
---
Not often.
---
Ah yes, terrible practice, but circlejerking on Reddit and upvoting posts calling people retard neckbeards for voting "no" is all good :)
---
Everyone has their own agenda about this and you're all trying to influence people to vote your way. Hypocrites.
---
Rig is a douche. Asked him to turn on some lights because he was gana destroy his eyes, dude banned me from his stream. I do not like him and his 12 viewers
---
And I yours. PM me if you want to play with a noob that will be jealous you still have your red helm.
---
It's almost like they're voting no not because they don't want to get 99, but because they think Warding is going to hurt the game.
---
(I disagree that it's going to hurt the game, I voted yes, but I'm just saying that's their reasoning.)
---
?? This post/ title makes no sense
---
Nope. This game was my youth and have been playing it for over 15 years. I only want the best for the future of the game and don't want osrs to have the same fate as rs3.
---
It’s not predetermined. The loot is determined when the casket is opened. If you opened up a casket and then there was a rollback to before you opened it, you would get different loot when you open it a second time.
---
That’s your opinion. This is based on how people have been acting and this is the third skill that they’ve tried to introduce to us. I personally believe the skill is good for the game and I have the mmo experience between being an RS veteran and playing plenty of other MMOS to stand by that opinion. BUT the community has been acting childish and the harassment was a huge line to cross.
---
His def is horrible.
---
Lmfao you're delusional if you actually think he's going to get banned
---
who tf fished for shrimp? questing exists for early levels
---
How hard is it to look one thing up? That's the reason why not to assume... but I'm not the one making assumptions. The title says he's a streamer, but that doesn't mean "everyone knows about them".
---
&gt; A game which has been getting very positive reviews recently.
---
by the 7 people who still play it? &lt;- that's sarcasm by the way there are 657 playing as of right now
---
&gt; If you don't know the content creator and can't guess their whole back story from a picture of a tweet, you'd have no idea it's sarcastic.
---
You can tell by the demeanor alone, ignoring the fact that he's threatening to switch to a dead game.
---
&gt; If this was the WoW subreddit and a similar tweet was posted but substitute LOTRO with Runescape, it'd be a similar thing.
---
You're comparing Lotro to a game that has 128 times its playerbase. But I still doubt /r/wow would fall for such an obvious joke.
---
 [u/vredditdownloader](https://www.reddit.com/u/vredditdownloader/)

that was pure gold. Just amazing
---
I would put money on never.
---
How is that an argument against warding being bad for game integrity? This is practically whataboutism and is also an indictment of ways Jagex has fucked up game balance in the past which is an excellent argument for why warding is a dangerous idea
---
Is it a real thing? I had no idea
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9lxweb/lynx_titans_view_on_the_new_skill
---
There needs to be a skill for creating magic gear akin to fletching and smithing for melee and ranged respectively. For better balance between the triangle we need a reliable way of creating medium level magic gear that isn't tacked on as an afterthought to crafting.
---
ok but what about if in the testing a ton of people decide they actually *don't* want it? Will there be another poll later to confirm that everyone does in fact want it? This is the problem with voting it in now with promises of changes.
---
I voted yes with the hope that we can convince them to turn the skill into something other than a bankstanding buyable. I think the rewards are appropriate, and the non-efficient training gameplay will probably be good (catching moths, breaking down items at wards etc.).
---
Yes.
---
I'm 2061 total and very pissed off about this timing...
---
But, I did vote yes because I think it fits the game thematically.
---
"i jerk off into my own mouth"
---
\-some reddit user named sandyen and assumes the motivations of people who disagree with him
---
Really did make me laugh. Thanks OP
---
It's still pretty big update you can advertise, like Zeah
---
dungeoneering was the most fun ive ever had in RS
---
Smartest post in the thread. Too bad this sub is filled with people who never criticize Jagex because they see them as doing no wrong. They have fallen for the jmods cult of personalities, and have lost sight about how the company destroyed the game before.
---
*1k andy
---
that chin hella thiccccc he tryna get sum 😩
---
Same although it's a buyable I don't see many other negatives.
---
I'm pretty sure the other post had the same title too...
---
feel like from the front page of this subreddit you can tell the pro-warding people are being more petty than the anti-warding people
---
Boy have I got bad news for you about the whole continent of zeah if you don’t want things added.
---
To think people want more of this boring training with Warding
---
lol thats like sayin EOC needs to pass for them to improve it....
---
Found the NPC
---
Stop misrepresenting me you nob, I was just answering people on how I voted and why lmao
---
I hope it won’t pass
---
Landfill
---
&gt;Wait do you also unironically think dems didn’t commit voter fraud via having non-citizens and deceased people vote too?
---
Citation needed, friend :)
---
Preferably not Brietbart
---
Idk we get a situation similar to Brexit, lets see how that ends
---
Enchantment already exists within Magic, though I agree it would be a better name for it.
---
Not possible. If it's 75%, it passes. If it's 74.9999999...%, it fails.
---
 [u/vreddit\_bot](https://www.reddit.com/u/vreddit_bot/)
---
vote yes on something even if you dont think its good, because we will totally make it good before we release it we swear, but since you already voted yes we can actually do whatever we want at that point and still be able to say it was the players choice.
---
Same, when the guy above you quit I really got into it.
---
He isn't there anymore.
---
So ya'll are saying yes because you basically god bored?
---
putting a bank in your house is a very OP mechanic. Youre effectively shaving off 2-5 seconds for for each home tele depending on your house set up and the 2 seconds back to the the edgeville bank. at those minimum time addatives youre looking at an extra 2-3 kills per hour for the average player for vorkath or zulrah. Give that to the extremists for those and ur looking at 5+ kills per hour. at lets say 125k avg per kill youre looking at 10s if not 100s of Mills extra added to the game
---
I stand corrected
---
And that's a problem. People are dumb and don't know what they really want.
---
Post was kind of circlejerky and pointless so I also posted something circlejerky and pointless hah
---
It wasn’t directly at you but, rc does have some depth, there are unlocks fairly often. Multiple runes are dead content for the most part, but every skill has dead content.
---
Fishing only has like 7 pieces of content people actually do. Fly fishing, barb fishing, minnows, karambwans, infernal and sacred eals.
---
Rc has lava, nats, cosmic, zmi, wrath, astral, steam or mud(can be good depending on price). Just because people doesn’t like it doesn’t mean it’s dead.
---
Almost all skills in the game are kind of boring, repetitive and not particularly fun. That’s because as you get to higher levels you require so much xp that you can’t have more content.
---
 No skill in this game really has any content
---
Phenomenal.
---
I cannot breathe
---
Calm down Zanik the manic
---
Don’t forget probable pedophile.
---
Holy fk that’s gold
---
Which is stupid cause most mentors aren't that good lol
---
no they've said if it doesnt pass it will probably be the last time a skill gets preposed for osrs
---
Man, I remember a period of my RS career when I would have a perfect cycle of getting a set of armor, using it to kill green dragons with a dragon longsword then getting a new set when it degraded. A whole summer of doing nothing but that. Probably the peak of my RS experience.
---
I just don’t find him enjoyable to watch. He’s a great pker and player in general (skill-wise) but he’s far too annoying, loud, and immature for me to watch more than 5 minutes.
---
To each their own.
---
They are since 2013 obviously
---
\&gt;maxed
---
\&gt;literally just maxed 5 mins ago, stats still 99
---
yeah you're just as bad as the guy who took 50 attempts at zuk and wanted to ban fire capes instantly (i agree)
---
Weeb
---
Ugh just do whatever comes in your mind it's not hard
---
Thank you for contributing to the problem
---
Why would I watch that piece of shit stream?
---
whole new market will be created if voted in, I am for it.
---
&gt;Every opinion about no is downvoted to oblivion and will only give no voters more reason to vote no. Don't polarize but discuss and respect someone else opinion (even if it's not right in your opinion).
---
This. I mean, that's how Trump became President.
---
If you dont know what to vote, or are confused about the question then skip the question. Doesnt sound like you should be voting at all tbh.
---
reddit is for it, which is enough to convince me that it is a terrible idea.
---
Boy oh boy do I have some news for YOU
---

---
the "wtf I hate ... now" is a meme used typically to make fun of people who flippantly change their minds because of something they watched or read.
---
in this case, I think he's satirizing how people generally love Ash here and someone who hates warding might read his tweet and think "wtf..."
---
When players max out 5 different accounts all with 99's I am sure they get bored of just the other skills in the game so yes.
---
Its interesting how certain games tend to have people only watch that game, and other games people watch for the personality.
---
Take any Runescape streamer, the moment they stop runescape, theyre probably dead in the water. The same thing happens with League of Legends streamers. the moment they quit league their viewerbase plummets.
---
I think its due to these games being addictive compared other games. People dont realize that their entire life is being swallowed by one thing
---
I really don't think we are.
---
Took 5 months? Jesus christ
---
Yeah, like I said, Im not raising a critique of you. Because obviously you will be discussing warding and giving your opinion on it, I think you should continue doing that. All I said was its disingenious to frame one side of this whole pro-warding / anti-warding debacle as being "the side that attempts indirectly or directly to influence its viewers" when it clearly happens on both sides, thats my critique, I dont find what you do problematic. I think its problematic that reddit downvotes every opinion they disagree with and upvote opinions they agree with, it makes it an echo chamber, thats where my genuine critique would be. Not what you do. You just talk about warding and give your opinion on it, thats totally fine.
---
You could care less? As in there's a scenario wherein you could exhibit less care? Doesn't that mean you *do* care, even if it's just a little bit?
---
At this point with all the blatant alt voting, I wouldn't even be mad if Jagex decides "fuck you" and releases warding anyway if it doesn't get to 75%.
---
&gt; - Keybindings on F keys
---
The default keybindings legit freak me out whenever I make a new account. The RS2 era F keys are legit so etched into my muscle memory that I probably couldn't play the game without that toggle.
---
&gt; Calm the fuck down
---
Gonna be a hard no sucking on her nipples. Thems the ones that probs got some real fucked up shit around em.
---
I sincerely hope none of you people play wow classic
---
I feel that i have grown intellectually
---
Can you un-imbue rings? And if so, do you get any points back?
---
Still better than season 8 of GoT.
---
money is just a means to an end
---
He owns the fucking end. hes the potus. the united states is a business and hes the ceo..
---
Didn’t say I ever watch him for more than 5 minutes now xd
---
This is definitely an unpopular opinion. Warding is the most polarized poll. No maybes heck yes, heck no
---
Not everyone! I try to be polite where possible. Be the change you want to be in the world (or some Ghandi some some)
---
I was hoping to see Kim whip Trump, it was still gold.
---
Oh yeah, that was a gamechanger
---
That's a lot of assumptions for no reason at all. Mage gear is drastically more expensive comparatively.
---
Ahrims is the only gear above t40 and even then mystics is like 200k for the set compared to rune which is like 120k.
---
All of magic gear above *t20* is rare drops. Now magic will probably have more decent and affordable options.
---
4m is affordable for me personally, but it shouldn't be magics only t70 gear, and because of that it's the most expensive barrows set in the game
---
Ash said theyd maybe make the 2.2k total require 2,250
---
When the bots are sending their accounts, they are not sending their best.
---
Ok, let's not get ahead of ourselves. This sub criticizes Jagex constantly.
---
Thanks Ditter! This looks really helpful. Maybe I’ll finally figure out how to stop getting dropped by you so hard haha
---
I got 6mil and it is rare that u will catch me using prayer pots, thank god for ranged
---
Agreed or implement a beta to test it out
---
I usually make an alt for shield of arrav then use my main to do heroes. Until I realized I could do this, those quests stressed me out like hell. Always had the nagging worry that I won't be able to find anyone for that quest lol
---
Projection
---
Nice RC cape
---
Don't release Warding it will ruin osrs and turn it into rs3, but lets rework all the skills in-game and turn it into something similar to rs3!
---
If it doesn't seem fun, don't vote it in.
---
My reason for no:
---
If we pass warding and jagex begins to focus their developing efforts on it, then it could be another couple years before we get another skill.
---
Far more interesting skills (artisan and especially sailing) were previously suggested. Warding on the other hand seems very dull. Why should warding be the one that passes?
---
I don’t know if this immediately comes off as really stupid, but what a stupid human being.
---
Sand casino Kappa
---
It's the little victories that count in life.
---
Theres no chance warding gets 75%
---
You are now tagged as "jerks off into own mouth".
---
I find it interesting how he states he’s “bringing his community with him”. Those are idk hundreds of people with their own minds, do you really matter that much to them to get them to entirely abandon the game on your whim? But I mean if they do they’re sheep and I won’t lose sleep if they stopped playing.
---
You can try, although I'm pretty sure most people already have a good stack of redirection scrolls already. If they don't refund pre-stocked scrolls in player banks when they eventually become tradeable, the market might be oversaturated with them. 
---
The blog said they'll use omni vis, papyrus and house tab. So they might be tied to the price of a house tab but idk. Hard to say what kind of price tag they'll get
---
Was common to see posters of Germans bayonetting babies in WW1. Someone could prob do something based on that for people voting no. Though I'd say we are pushing the memeganda too far at that point.
---
Do you have anyway to prove it?
---
Ah yes, and business (much like the presidency) is something you only ever do 4-8 years at a time.
---
I still remember when my dad hit his term limit at my family’s old pizza chain. Hurt to sell the company and all 50 locations, but it’s clearly a 1:1 similarity with the presidency and he’s obviously a good, honest business man
---
Dont be sorry.
---
Looks like Orrville
---
Fishing skill = click on the fishing spot and go to the bathroom.
---
There aren't actually that many fun skills in the game. It's the xp/hr, levels, rewards, and unlocked content that is fun. Nobody in the world thinks Crafting is fun, but nobody has an issue with that skill for some reason.
---
The only truly awful skill is pre-77 RC. As long as Warding isn't like that, then it will be a perfectly acceptable skill.
---
I say that while still seething about the fact the GE was added.
---
I'm actually not a redditor, its okay that you thought that. The average IQ in the world is like 90, which is almost a standard deviation below average. Most people really arent that inventive and you are in the majority, so take solace in that. Us high intelligence people are generally hapy :) to share our knowlege.
---
Keep keeping on, my friend 🍻
---
your friend can fuck right off gz
---
A bit late now, and you were doing it for the clues but...
---
The optimal loot potential is 86.6, not 88. You lost quite a bit of money getting those bolt racks.
---
Yea done, I’ll be *done* with the game after that 😂
---
Make it from warding and I'll vote yes
---
I spend most of my time doing high-level PvM and minigames with IRL friends. If you pay for membership and only play to do "repetitive, monontous skills" then I feel so sorry for you because the game is a lot more than that.
---
He's lost a lot of money though tbh. His connections are probably the only thing holding him up.
---
commenting for commenting
---
Fuck all youtubers and twitchers
---
You’ll lose about 2 mil but gain ~620k crafting xp. It’s a fast way to train so it’s not like it’s better to sell it and do a different method.
---
Honestly I was diehard going to vote no. It was only until I sat back and thought about it, realising that the osrs dev team have much more experience, knowledge and generally are good guys in this case. They want the best for osrs and unlike other game devs they aren't only concerned about money. Otherwise they wouldn't have polled it in the first place. So I voted yes.
---
It's the business plan, make more content, hire more devs, increase the $11. The memes are the only thing keeping this game alive.
---
Just goes to show you've never worked on any amount of serious projects then.
---
I bet there are 10 year olds with better knowledge of group projects than you
---
Just having one sitting there is bound to have people dumping shit in it for the hell of it. Especially if it’s in a few main spaces next to banks.
---
Dungeoneering is a mini game.
---
Nice, man! I congratulate you.
---
They can tell if you are using certain plugins, though.
---
Plenty of new skills to try in rs3 my dude
---
Will she do one trade? 🤔
---
Whilst all the weebs have been yanking it to nieve’s propaganda poster on the front page in anticipation
---
to be fair, I voted but didn't tweet about it!
---
Yeah bro, I’m stupid
---
&gt;You know this is sarcastic right? How the fuck *no one* figure that out?
---
&gt;All you have to do is go to the Twitch page for LOTR online...
---
Boys, I think I solved it.
---
Game has been out 6 years. Nearly everyone is max melee or at least 90+ which lets you do all high end content, on top of that, most max mains like myself have alts that are the “mid level” accounts you are speaking of, so it’s still us.
---
Sea Shanty 2
---
Haha you never played dungeoneering? It was fun.
---
I'm indifferent to warding as a skill, and would not consider it worth the dev time even if I knew that sailing would never pass.
---
SotE and Menaphos are both things that I would want, so even the one I wouldn't prefer I would consider worth the dev time.
---
I maxed it and hated every second of it
---
This reads like a 25 buttholes video
---
Dungeoneering was a minigame not a skill change my mind
---
Careful. Knowing this sub, you don’t want to give someone any ideas
---
Protect range with sound on.
---
You can hear the magic attack in time to switch, but not the other way around.
---
bring back soul wars and stealing creation!!
---
“OSRS needs it” 😂😂
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted, lol. It literally has 2 attacks, essentially. It's also a boss you're 100% invincible against. For whatever reason, Runescape is just a much harder game when it comes to dealing with an enemy's 50/50 attack.
---
You make a great point in regards to the excitement of training current skills. That's why I think going forward "content enjoyment" should be an important consideration of the implementation process whether or not a said skill should pass. I understand that creates a higher level of difficulty but there's really no rush to pass a new skill and who's to say it wouldn't be better to just focus on skilling updates for the currently available skills that make them more engaging and exciting to train
---
If you say so.
---
The improvements from the April post and this one show me that they are committed to making the content feel right! They aren't going to toss some random BS into the game. If something goes wrong, they'll fix it...but we have to give them the chance!
---
A mini game with the best content in runescape hands down.
---
Invalid response. Not what I'm wanting to know.  Try again.
---
Thanks, man! Feels amazing doing stuff I never accomplished as a child.
---
Poll is live now! And it runs until July 24th
---
Someone upvote this man.
---
It was also oh so charming rather than the big Walmart center lol.
---
I have never gotten that far but man that's real good. Hope that you do great things in the game.
---
most polls pass with a huge margin, so go ahead cake boy you wont change anything.
---
Is this some kinda copy pasta or are you genuinely handicapped?
---
Cheers!
---
Ah shit this is some advanced NPC code, this guy sat at at least 2 lectures.
---
Enjoy that motte and bailey of yours though.

gz on the neckbeard

But not a skill.
---
Rig is a mid-sized streamer, he usually has 300-400 viewers, which is pretty for for osrs
---
imagine not having these sexy ass boots as your default naked character boots
---
what are you all doing
---
I fucking love you grande
---
Yeah and it started small which pretty much everyone was okay with because the official client had nothing then got insanely out of control imo.
---
If I'm not mistaken the moving of imbues is already off the table in the updated blog, and it's hard to add a lot of magic gear without retooling magic gear drops.
---
Why should my vote be for anyone else but myself?
---
Ohhhh, okay. Cheers for letting me know.
---
This really seems like it should result in a ban.
---
I have no idea if Jagex can tell if someone is using runelite+ specifically but that client is honestly just dodgy. Wouldn't suprise me if people are being hacked through using it.
---
Osrs could use a skill like invention which I think this is a good step towards
---
pls add me in game to remind me lBambino, gz m8
---
Maxed in Rs3, my guy, games shit.
---
The most realistic way I see a new skill being added is if it starts out as a minigame, or as some other small mechanic, and gets gradually built up until it's something pretty much everyone likes. As is, committing to a skill you haven't tried yet feels like a major risk, both in terms of the game and in terms of the dev hours it would take, which might dissuade a significant number of people.
---
Idk maybe because people like it, the last 2 non buyables failed, it fills a thematic hole, its healthy for the economy, and its holding open betas for people to try it and critique it as they please so that it can be changed in accordance to the players' wishes
---
I tend to agree with you, personally. But, we’ll see
---
q
---
oops 🤣 looks like someone's mad they don't have a max cape!

gotta click ⬇ on your comment
---
gz my boi
---
Don't do it at level 99?
---
Isn’t that the story to bioshock and Infinite, creating false realities to get someone to believe something that isn’t
---
you cant do that. the second hand is defense slot (ex. shield, dragon defender)
---
scamm
---
A lot of streamers really don't understand that the main reason people watch them is for the particular game they are playing not just the person.
---
cause an item sink would be helpful, an interesting item sink you can train/level and rewards you with gear would be even better. If it wasnt "buyable and dead content on arrival" then its either "resource gathering and boring" or "should have just been a minigame"
---
1. This was literally a joke
---
2. Reddit only has a problem with people influencing other peoples votes if they are voting no, its totally fine to draw a cute nieve saying to vote yes or upvoting bad memes that generalise all people who vote no to warding as salty max capers who never wants any new content in the game
---
is that the reason im getting murked? I was thinking about that since pretty much any lvl come attack me
---
Username: StonedMain

Add me, roughly the same stats, would be dope to grind together!

Damn I hope that thing looks better in real life. The pic is definitely not doing it any favors.

It is peak time on a Friday after all

Damn
---
Haha Dongo Trump
---
"competitive"....right.
---
the yes voters are basically Hitler fans ngl
---
you 100% right, and it will become one of the most hated skills to train if allowed in. thats why we take one for the team right now and vote no for the boys
---
Good lord, those were my college years. Most of my play time was in Jr. High, so like 2001-2003 for me.
