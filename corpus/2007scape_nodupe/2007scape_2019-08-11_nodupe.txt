Because bots buy them out
---
---
---
Adamant and Rune items will sell higher in those shops rather than in the general store. Especially useful before the GE.
---
Yeah at max combat you'll in most situations want dps or prayer bonus over anything else. Though prims' str bonus is so small it often won't change your max hit, in which case they are actually pretty trash for their price.
---
what is tmorph and how do i use it to get my infernal cape 0.0
---
Uhh what? How are they different from  normal pot (+preserve)? Have actually done the math to see how much do 3-5 levels boost your dps on average?
---

---
 I can already see that the dps increase is very minimal compared to normal pots. Also you lose 10hp every sip, unlike ovls.
---
I mean... he didn't actually say what he meant to say.
---
When a person uses "them" it refers to what the subjects were previously, which in this case were only wizard and ranger boots.  So what he wrote only referred to those 2 boots (maybe the set of boots, ambiguously), while he meant all medium clue uniques.
---
Oops

L2read dude
---
Just a fyi those rare drops are 1/128 not 1/1024 maybe if it was a unique rare that you were going for.
---
Nah wont happen and I'm glad. Go play private servers.
---
How long did that take? LOL Isn‚Äôt it 5xp every tick?
---
Well calculating the chance of two rolls of the same item in the same drop by multiplying their drop rates isn't how it works either. You're right that previous kills have no effect on future kills, but statistically you have to take them into account when calculating the chance of the drop on that KC.
---
Calculating the drop singularly is statistically inaccurate.
---
Wait wat? I thought Justiciar requires 75 defence. How did you manage that lmao
---
Feel like they'll change it on their own, we did the same thing lol
---
Yes, and the developers already know.
---
They will be deploying a fix for it next week.

I got to wave 41 on fightcaves before i realised i had str potions instead of brews..
---
YouTube maygne
---
It's actually 91.91%
---
Even if it beats the other ones in raw stats, it still comes up as less efficient when it comes to gp/h, which pretty much eliminates it from viability except for a small subgroup of the top pet hunters. 
---
Outside of ToB, of course.
---
People usually just compliment my stats then ask for free stuff and when I say no they flame me lol
---
Glad there's still some positivity out there.
---
Can't do this easily. Requires enginework. This has been confirmed bt devs

He never claimed its 1 in 1m after 53 kills. That drop is still 1 in 1m for ajy specific kill. When you're talking in general, where no one has the same kc, the only relevant statistic is the chance for one specific kill to drop it, nothing else is relevant.
---
There's always a 1Head fucker like you making this argument everytime, and thats just useless and irrelevant pedanticism. OP was right and you're wrong.
---
I do this and I'm 97 thieve now
---
No
---
I use them at DKS. They‚Äôre also really good boots for being like 1/5th the cost of primordials lol
---
Or a UIM, also he mentioned storing in house which doesnt take bank space
---
Got full graceful, sipping stamina potions, got the 3 bags, warping to edgeville via glory.
---
At this point the only problems I run into are PvP brainlets. Luckily no raggers camping my corpse to grief me.
---
No trading.
---
All drops/resources converted to low alch value.
---
Only keep items bought from shops/obtained from NPCs.
---
Hiscores for cash stacks because we need more shit to waste time on.
---
Membership is $22/mo because you're clearly very wealthy.
---
You can definitely get them from the ones in catacombs
---
OP posted that it is a 1 in 1 million drop, which it is. Doesn't matter when he got it.
---
r/gangstalking
---
At least this one doesn't cause me to lie and steal from my family!!!!
---
It's not a 1/1m drop because of when he got after 53 kills.
---
Yet
---
Yeah I am
---
Indova. The jads are really weird though as damage is calculated when a projectile hits rather than on attack. Really annoying but it is still way better than nothing. I paid like $10 to get cash for a blowpipe and some basic gear/supplies.

just wait until you discover Bogla

Never use private servers. U can easily get a virus if there‚Äôs something hidden in the JavaScript.
---
It‚Äôs a joke
---
It's good for ironmen because arma helm is such a pain to get. So nobody really buys it
---
Happy cake day
---
the achievement diary popped up as it was slain but this one last magic projectile hit a 29 on me after it died so yeah :/
---
If we were trying to determine the odds of getting it in 53 kills, that would be a different discussion, but we're not. The OP did not draw attention to that fact, you are. He is presenting an isolated incident of a 1 in 1 million drop that he received.
---
I'm in the same boat and classic seems like a waste of time to me. I have no nostalgic connection to the game so why not start on the fleshed out version with better graphics? 
---
Think about the inverse situation. If I had never played runescape before and my friend presented me with both osrs and rs3 i'd jump on rs3 because it looks better
---
Do Fairytale PT 1 and unlock fairy rings, dumbass.  There's no reason to have level 1 farming. You're playing like it's 2005
---
Yeah on his 53rd kill
---
Didn't sell my cash stack when I was going through active addiction... I think I'll be good üëçüòÅ
---
Heeeey pal... r/woooosh, but on a real note, Drake plays OSRS on the daily!
---
Do mo key madness dor D scim and also do barbarian assault for fighter torso. 2 good upgrades that arent too complicated and cost very little.
---
Haha yeah, took a while to plan the route so as to minimize time but still make it seem like a sort of natural b2b kind of thing
---
On vet boat thats true
---
H
---
And you can *count*, on me, seeing you in the parking lot!
---
Good shit man. Fentanyl's a dirty fkn bitch she wont take care of you like RS will LMAO
---
I work 7 days on and 7 days off. Runescape has definitely helped save me money.
---
That motherfucker definitely didn't commit suicide WHILE on "suicide watch," he probably got smuggled out after paying the majority of his wealth to those holding him.
---
If everything is a waste of time, why are we living?
---
To play RuneScape, duh.
---
Why guys use female avatars
---
Upvote. This kind of stuff is so obvious, you‚Äôd think idiots are running Jagex. Ow8...
---
Damn that sounds like a good deal, what industry do you work in?
---
Me too! It's pretty concentration demanding, if you put it good effort you can get MVP pretty often. I average about 1/3. They nerfed the MVP loot for sure, but it's still a nice gesture.
---
I have been told it‚Äôs best to do till 90 because it‚Äôs way better than fremmy
---
This was a triumph.
---
It's not about him getting it on his 53rd KC. It's about getting the 1 in 1 million drop. The fact that it happened on the 53rd KC which does not need to be factored in at all, unless we're trying to determine those odds.
---
Only if they bring back summon. They were good for crimson charms
---
just take it, only requires 1 thieving for your moms credit card
---
There's "hard"
---
And there's JUST PVM LULZ.
---
Because that's what Jagex turned Ironman into long before they started these "snowflake updates".
---
The meta was literally farm 2000+ Zulrah kills (pre last nerf).
---
Didn't see people like you bitching and standing up for the game mode when that was released, or any of the other completely mode damaging shit either.
---
Lmaoooo I dont like him and I've never seen his videos. What a legend
---
Rev Cave my friend
---
You're dense man. Drop rates arent psuedo random, as in, previous drops are not taken into consideration when rolling for the current drop. It doesnt matter if he killed 53 or 1,000,000 the probability is still 1 in 1,000,000 to get that exact drop on any one kill. 
---
I have 1,500 zulrah KC, but my probability of getting a blow pipe drop next kill is still 1/128 not 1,500/128.
---
I press the thumbs up every time i log out, Its not helping me with drops but i cant stop it now.
---
Yeah I miss SonOnOldSchool too
---
Apparently the camera around the cell ‚Äòweren‚Äôt working‚Äô as well.
---
I just used the Divine potions at Bandos, the damage I take with each sip (Divine Ranging potion and Diving Super Combat potion) causes you significantly more damage than Graardor or the minions do. I take around 20 sips of BOTH Ranging and Super Combat.... that's FOUR HUNDRED extra damage I need to account for with the inventory setup. If you're not using an SGS or bring a Guthan's switch then you are fucked without food drops.
---
It's much better to use the non-Divine potions and keep the Preserve prayer on to extend the time spent at boosted levels.
---
Divine's are probably best used to pre-pot, then Angler up your health, THEN begin a PvM trip with normal potions.
---
It‚Äôs called merching noob, git gud
---
Funniest shit I've seen all day
---
IIRC it's not a 2D sprite, it's literally a model viewer of the item and all they have to do is change some numbers to modify the angle and zoom of the model.
---
Dang that was an amazing drop bro
---
I heard about that too. What the fuck? It's like a scene from James Bond or Mission Impossible lmfao
---
Nice
---
It's a phising email lmao
---
Lol.  Good 1.
---
I would kill myself then get my gf to alch my bones
---
how long did it take?
---
Not 2011 more like 2005-2009 or so
---
Ops name is mildo
---
Probability is the ratio between the number of ways of achieving success and the number of possible outcomes. He had 53 possible ways of achieving the drop out of 1m possible outcomes, the probability of the drop needs to take into account the number of attempts to get it.
---
Nah its just me forgetting to mute the audio of that clip :s
---
thats a legit jagex address but its spoofed so they sent it from another address
---
this is a phising e-mail
---
nah the dude is right

That's not what an instance is.

If you have one inventory space and would get a gathering skill pet (fishing, woodcutting) while already having a follower, do you get the resource first or the pet?

Runelite isn't overheating your pc.

i got mine 3 weeks ago and love it. so accurate and fast for a wireless mouse. beats out any deathadder or steelseries mouse ive ever used
---
Yeah bro. Shit is straight out of a movie. Guy definitely knew a lot of info on some high profile people. Crazy
---
I used venge which was invaluable, but obviously cant help here
---
Are you making sure to fight her in multi? She gets hugely more defense in solo (I believe you can be in solo, so long as she‚Äôs in multi)
---
Is your example of you using them inefficiently supposed to prove a point?
---
Not unless you haven't done mm2, she's alive on my screen!
---
Problem is those skills won't pass because people won;t think they're fun.
---
You‚Äôre allowed to be some people are bitter as hell, still waiting on my first pet!
---
Its sort of a grey area, its not against the rules to share accounts, ive gotten fire capes on my friends pures all the time, but i also pk on them as well so theyre half my accounts. But it is bannable to have someone go on your account and get a cape as well. So theres this thin line between what is bannable and what isnt. Safest way is to have your friend do it on your ip address
---
The first to use 100% of the brain
---
Tragic I‚Äôm not paying money, thanks anyways
---
Jagex said they wont nerf safespots in the wildy because your still in the wilderness risking. They dont want wildy boss to be dead content or else pkers will cry
---
Tell your friend congrats for me.
---
At least I got Mole
---
no, but if your having a server issue then your account will log out on its own after 5 minutes assuming no inpute.
---
Need to learn metallurgy and chemistry first though. You need to Smith yourself the medical steel to craft into the tattoo gun. Then you need to create pigments that are permanent but also non toxic when injected into the lower layer of the dermis. Then you need to build a water wheel to provide the electricity for the set up. The artistry skill that you'd need comes at the very end of the grind.

What has she done these days in particular to get this kind of attention?

Basically his main argument was that it would make math easier. He also thought it would help with measurement in imperial units. I'm not sure why he didn't think that just switching to metric would be better.

---
Did he get the cape?
---
Too stupid and won't have it recorded because he'd do it offline.
---
X log, aka close the client while logged in. If you‚Äôre in combat, make sure to remember the world in case you die.
---
I still believe Ranged is overpowered in OSRS, and it's difficult to voice this opinion because many of the people who hear it are avidly performing 90% of their PvM content with Blowpipe (or TBow) and will pause just to come argue with me that it's fine.  
---
I just think it's way too versatile.
---
I actually looked at the wiki and it says you can use v4 armor for master clues.
---
Fr fr
---
Most items like that gradually fall to alch price. The other guy gave examples of stuff that have a low enough supply that it doesn't go down so quickly, some niche dragon items, master clue stuff etc are other examples.
---
It's at like half the price I bought it for, I knew this would happen eventually but I'm still not happy about it.
---
Lol
---
No summoning was terrible.
---
!remindme 6 days
---
Thanks
---
There goes you‚Äôre RNG for the decade
---
Changed mine for recruitment drive, cba to go back and change it
---
Because 11 merchers in a discord are buying scythe for incredibly low, and are holding a majority of the scythes currently in the game, killing the market activity for it by not selling. They're lowering the price and once it gets low enough it'll readjust and shoot up then they will sell for profit
---
That's a good way to make yourself feel less bad about having no life.
---
If you plan on doing  blast furnace buy a coal bag. As well as ice gloves.
---
Any idea what the xp per hour would be there?
---
Just passed 500 with no rangers yet. I hope I don't share your RNG
---
Lol for real
---
Posting this and/or the map is pretty much instant karma points. I love it. Still have mine.
---
birdhouse runs are great at lower levels especially if you're an ironman
---
fastest exp is red or black chinchompas with tick manipulation. Black chinchompas are more profit and exp but in the wilderness. Herbiboar is decent for ironmen.
---
Raw and thick wedges from a large potato? Nah.
---
If par-boiled, absolutely.
---
Again, you're misunderstanding my idea...
---
It would still only be a mute, not a ban. It would just be a way for pmods to actually PLAY the game while doing their volunteer duties because they wont have to AFK at GE to mute bots and spammers.
---
Gz. Just FYI anti drag shield is better than dfs when ranging.
---
2.6million ticks
---
You‚Äôre condescending and unhelpful as fuck dude.... people like you ruin games like these because of the way you talk to others, and make them not want to associate themselves with you or any of the more experienced crowd that actually wants to help people out in a non condescending way...
---
I activate smite when I kill a boss or open a clue.
---
For Prif it should be around 60K at 90 without shortcuts and 66K with shortcuts. So at 87, you'd probably still fail and get a bit slower exp.
---
I used it on a different computer than my normal account, and don't do anything serious on that computer. Yea certainly something to watch for though.
---
Tbow is a better and more useful weapon which makes it more valuable. The fact that it's stronger than the blowpipe in a lot of cases should tell you how OP it is.
---
How do they ruin it?
---
Same.
---
Yes do that please
---
Dm me world and level and I‚Äôll bring you food and anti poison

Talking about the AVERAGE player. Most average players haven't even done 50 kc.

Obviously when you see the numbers I listed, you aren't talking about the Woox's of the world.

From top to bottom.

Pwople these days

Nice, so u want have more bots
---
Literally yes, mod reach
---
As long as you enjoy the game thats all that matters :)
---
Bond prices say otherwise
---
yes because the clintons have any amount of influence on the world. Epstein is connected to royalty and the sitting president....
---
:) F
---
Bonds are another way to tell besides gold prices, you're exactly right.
---
Definitely gonna need something to fill in the 30 second water breaks after every 2 mobs. OSRS is gonna make leveling bearable lol.
---
And even if they are a small loss, people still alch them for the xp. I‚Äôm pretty sure the only things that are profitable to alch also have very low buy limits
---
Haha yea pretty much. There's so much fool-proof safety equipment incorporated into everything, that all I'm really looking for are alarms on the monitors.
---
I've done 45 keys so far. After seeing a post like this, I will not be opening another key. Not a single unique, and you've lose around 20m potential profit.
---
Not much brainpower you say? Tell that to the pk‚Äôers /s
---
Well ok then, good to know. I swear I wasn't getting hit before for like 50 kills, guess my monkey brain is as flawed as they all are.
---
This is the first time I've ever heard the 99 music... and that's because I play with no audio.

But it's also grossly powerful, the best by far, in PvP, not only due to how strong it is offensively, but because Black D'hide is so disproportionately strong relative to its cost.

Getting gear in classic from my experience on pserver was not that bad at most it took me 3 months to get what i wanted. 
---
I solo bgs till r13, and because i'm a druid tier pieces are free because people on pserver only rolled with 2 druids, and i was lucky enough to get invited to a guild that allow me to play feral. So i was able to get gear for resto, tank, and dps with ease. 
---
Also don't have to worry about my bis being replaced by a titanforge item, a lot of items i got where bis till naxx.
---
decent video, good production.
---
Because then you have to play uim
---
I was confused too but I‚Äôm pretty sure he meant like the years 2004-2006
---
If you have a maxed pure, and a nearly maxed main the obvious choice is a 60 attack med. At 103 combat maxed (70 defense) you'll have an account for basically everyone you find deep. 
---
I'd go with 70 defense because you won't really need an Ely, DFS, Prims, etc if you're PKing deep wild.
---
If you also want to do honor PKing a 60 attack med is still insane because you're going up against maxed 75 attack zerker and such.
---

Great, thank you very much! Definitely need to read up on the updates that happened over the years.
---
hey! i just started my ironman 3 months ago and i currently love it! i currently have 2k total on a 1 def pure and i can honestly say that ironman mode is much more fun than a regular account. BUT, it is much harder than the regular mode, since it requires alot of game knowledge and takes twice as much time.
---
‚ÄúYou accidentally burn the shark‚Äù

.......!&amp;$@
---
I mean they're quite a lot different because you get max boost for 20 minutes per pot. They're not as op as some are suggesting, but they are very good and a definite buff to damage everywhere in the game other than bosses where you stack brews(which there isn't any of at the moment)

you're looking at millions of people playing, if you're not top-tier and playing actual meta classes you're not getting shit sorry lol. most people will probably be mages, all warriors will tank, priests will be healers, etc, etc, etc. besides vanilla raiding was a nightmare. 39 other people on the same page as you, resistance gear, attunements, consumables, world buffs, like i said. 50000x more tedious than osrs. legacy wotlk would be perfect.

Well done! My luck's always been bad, went good on my HCIM and soon as I posted my luck at Zulrah has been through the rickidy roof.
---
add skippy for accounts made years ago =)
---
What a shame I love doing wildy bosses and I‚Äôd duo if you‚Äôre still looking to
---
The odds are yes, someone could tell you.
---
Yeah a lot of the examples for scythe and tbow are raids related, ignoring raids they're very close in terms of bis bosses. 
---
I always scythe maiden personally, I don't really think it's difficult (although the stat drain is frustrating).
---
You're right that scythe is only worth using for pet hunters at a lot of places, although I think ggs is one of the places scythe is worth (over 30% increase in DPS). I find it strange that people who own scythes are really concerned about gp/hr over anything else though. I stopped caring about gp completely around when I got a scythe because ToB prints so much cash it's hard to worry about spending 30m or so every month.
---
If you have a dfs and super antidote you should be praying range ..
---
Is it obligatory to say "only two genders" as soon as the word gender is said? Like, how are you - fine thanks? Gender - only two genders, thanks?
---
Inferno, GWD and hydra all good for tbow, and actually worth killing.  
---
Scythe is only good for some raids bosses, and stuff like KQ which is never worth killing except for pet.
---
Lately I've seen a lot of lvl 75-80cb beggars around the ge, at that point it's easy to make decent cash fairly quick...doesnt make any sense why they wont just make it themselves. Loot a pvp world for a bit, buy some steel balls and afk cannonball. You're doing God's work lmao
---
Lmao this is osrs
---
a pure carnivore only eats meat... a pure carnivore that doesn't eat eat would starve....
---
I have been watching torvesta it feels like his guides can be more suited to later game players though
---
&gt;Implying that I'm not already roleplaying osrs
---
They may not be able to spend much time on per day, and so a month of playing is fewer hours total for them than it would be for you.
---
Please let‚Äôs have a moment to appreciate how nice that pet looks
---
Not only cox, they want tob cox. Not some cheap stuff.
---
Yeah but letting everyone know what they believe is annyoing. Like, you know the ironman btw meme.
---
You have no idea what the situation is surrounding him...
---
retail leveling is a chore but vanilla leveling isnt? would like to see this same narrative after you die because you pulled 2 mobs that were standing 20 yards away from each other; its the other way around.
---
I think the main fact the scythe is crashing is that its a 1/173 drop. Twisted bow in 4+1s is like 1/340 or so, so thats double the rarity. TOb is more effort though, so I think scythe will stabilize around bow price, bit lower maybe.
---
Ahh. I reminds me good old days on f2p, when I used to bring logs and tinderbox to cook my lobsters after I cought them
---
At what point would ai no longer be considerd a bot?  I wonder how advanced ai would play the gam tho

Supplements, vitamins, etc, can be used as a substitute for meat. This is done regularly when the body of a carnivore doesn't produce the proper proteins to digest meat.

...You didn't think I was talking about literally eating nothing at all, did you? As in just go without food at all?

Yeah I mean that's the literal interpretation of what you wrote.

Why do you keep regular str pots in bank?

I have a friend who is flipping for fun but does not understand the game at all. He rarely leaves the ge tho

Check out the wiki too there's a money making guide with clear requirements
---
Jagex rarely acts logically
---
huh, it would be perfect.
---
Synq has a craws bow guide on YouTube. Not with doing without some form of safe spot.
---
it's actually a pretty useless shield lol
---
To be fair at 1100 total due to flipping, pvp etc i could already afford shit like this lol
---
Oof me too
---
Honestly I think this explains so much about your posts.
---
I'm so sorry.
---
No it would be a nice even 13 minutes, 3 * 4 is 12 (in base 10) which is 10 (in base 12).
---
So 13 * 4 in base 12 is 50.
---
13 * 4
---
(10 + 3) * 4
---
4 * 10 + 3 * 4
---
40 + 10
---
50
---
Get a Fighter torso
---
Obsidian armor with zerker necklace and obby Sword is great dps. Great for training and killing. Only problem is you can‚Äôt use it with a black mask/slayer helmet for slayer tasks and your defense is stupidly low so you might need more food if you‚Äôre killing stuff that can actually hurt you.
---
i even did it with a dcb, just stock up on diamond bolts (e). its not really necesarry to have a bp/archer's ring, but it does speed up quite a lot
---
Just do Zalcano lmao. Shit is afk 2/m hour no risk.
---
Berserker ring is always better. Full obby with sword + berserker necklace is op.
---
A good setup for slayer is fighter torso + obby legs because you use slayer helm.
---
Since Jagex support is basically non existent, I think you should find a phishing link, give them your email and password, and they can probably provide you with your account authenticator removed in the matter of an hour. But it will probably cost your whole bank... Just an idea!
---
that being said, i can give you a blowpipe,
---
This is actually brilliant
---
:( it was a joke
---
Yeh i plan on resubbing my zerk pre soon so i'll likely use it as a prescout and possible alt prep.

Gold buyers (buying bonds is the same thing) aka half this sub is really salty about this post. It is not an alt account you are just trash go call pink clay for your fire cape thanks

You definitely take less damage when you get hit, so less pausing to eat. I'm not sure if you get hit less often too.

Just want to leave here a Panic episode i had This morning, i woke up and Saw on my smartphone an e-mail that my registered RuneScape e-mail account had been changed.

Just want to Warn people to not click on any fishing links, i got e-mail spoofing, scary as fuck.

That's more akin to "playing the game" than the leveling in modern. Modern is more about simply putting your time in, so that the $60 character boosts have value enough to be a marketable service to the playerbase.
---
In classic, I guess you could call leveling a chore the same as you could call most of the things in RS chores. They simply are, in a manner of speaking, but they're also more meaningfully woven into the experience than in the modern version.
---
Nice bought account
---
&gt; a helmie or a peasant.
---
So like 50% of the playerbase?
---
Thats what i did when i started. I had 99 buyables before messing with melee stats at all really.

Lower chance of encounter but higher chance of death if encountered

Conveniently

I didn't like the area it was in. That dumb building pretty much connected Barbarian Village and Edgeville and they are already too close to each other.

You think 1mill people will all join a hardcore/semi hardcore raid setup with loot council, that's not going to happen. 
---
What's going to happen is 1mill people will give each server a decent size population at launch that once people start hitting 60 there will be a lot of guilds of different types of setups. Casual, semi hardcore, and hardcore. 
---
It's not reliable to have only have priest healers , all warriors will not be tanks either if you want to see a phase 1 setup here is a picture of the semi hardcore guild i was in, and as you see there is not that many mages it's mostly melee classes  [https://imgur.com/a/pD7aB9D](https://imgur.com/a/pD7aB9D).  You will start seeing less melee/hunters as AQ/Naxx get released. 
---
I've played druid in raiding, and that class is not even considered meta, and most of the time you don't even need them in your raid guild. But yet i was still invited to a semi hardcore guild, and even then had 2 druids which already had every single bis piece so i had 0 competition.
---
 When i had to join  a new guild (NA time+ranking did not work well with EU guild) i decided to roll as a feral druid which meant i had to farm gear for dps, and tank,  guess what i got majority of my BIS items except for drakefang talisman.  Other then that i was really geared, and not even a meta class or spec btw. 
---
Raiding is not that important to rush, and there always be guilds doing old raid content for there alts  or people leave guild ,and you happen to join ect.
---
As for getting attuned, this isn't that hard at all, mostly done during questing to 60, If i  remember MC was just walking in to brd, and going to the MC portal clicking a stone, and then your done. 
---
 Wbuffs are also not that hard you just wait for a warlock to summon you or just fly to dmn, and grab them logout till raid starts, no reason to go for songflower. Could just play osrs while flying to dmn as well.
---
Don't really want to type more then this but imo osrs, and vanilla both are equally tedious in there own.
---
No you absolutely can't. There's a team of us constantly rotating and viewing parameters. As with most plants, we have our regular maintenance to upkeep and a high standard for safety. In a sense, when I'm playing, it just means I'm in between duties. Complacency is a dangerous line to cross into
---

---
The tuna on the ground is a nice touch.
---
I see where you're getting at but the whole thing about quests is you can choose which one you wanna do. Like, at a certain level I can choose if I wanna do DS2, MM2, Regicide, Desert treasure, etc... And I really don't like the idea of having the game bugging me with quest suggestions.
---
Hopefully not. Catastrophic failures happen, but it's our teams job to address issues long before it evolves to that level.
---
I remember back in the RuneScape classic days you could write `@ran@` before your message to have it rainbow-colored. I was feeling clever so I named my character @ran@joe. The @s got stripped out and forever after my character was named "ran joe".

Yep no, been there, done that, now I'm busy playing RuneScape while I'm studying for my second session for exams I need to retake

Yes and no. They're only open part of the time but when they are you have free access to everything you would need.
---
You're projecting bro
---
German servers are best for me. Find the server closest to you geographically.
---
It's perfectly fine where it I right now, not every boss needs to give you 4b an hour. To be completely honest you should make less an hour here, but still have the blade. This is how bosses should be, shit drop table but an amazing item that is worth a fair bit. A very good example of this would be the GWD bosses, Thermy, and Cerb.

Like the other guy said. Wear a chainbody. They're better at absorbing crush attacks. And bring good food. Depending on your defence level youre likely to get hit hard often.
---
lol? What do you think abstraction is? The ability to try different ideas in our minds is what sets us apart from other apes. You come up with a new idea, and think it through, and if it turns out to be a dumb idea,  you forget about it and think up a new idea. When you've got one that you think might work, then you try it in the real world. The benefit to this is that your ideas are on average, better than random because you threw out all the ones which failed the "think it through" stage before trying them in the real world.
---
The difference is that most machine learning isn't abstracted - it literally tries all of the combinations. Humans are better at this, not worse.

In another comment I said I work in a power station, it's about ¬£25/$30 basic ¬£40/$48 overtime. Overtime is available for trash hours that no one wants to work like friday and saturday night shifts and national holidays, which also pay additional bonuses. A Christmas day shift is something like ¬£60/$72 per hour and I'll do that most years. 
---
Other bonus is that these shifts tend to be pretty quiet so I can spend most of it in the break room or hiding up playing on mobile.
---
I've always dreamed of an agility course like this. Prifddinas is nice but it offers nothing in terms of decision-making. The underwater course and the Brimhaven arena remain the only agility courses that are exciting to play.

The difference is way more than that. For example on hydra it's 4 max hits. https://i.imgur.com/loenDGd.png

10 bonds = 40 mil = $69.99 USD.  So more like $70/hr
---
Ok I did the math it‚Äôs like 433.3333333334 hours
---
Gauntlet gp/hr is fine as it is. Not every new content needs to be the best profit per hour. It is fun and provides at least some profit, therefore people will play it.
---
At 75 RC, someone can run astrals for 4m-5m per hour. Not everyone is doing it because its rather boring and there's no accomplishment. I'd much rather do other things for less profit.
---
I will unironically keep watching these if you can do them a bit more frequently.

And a volcano looks like infernal Cape textures, a stick looks like a dragon longsword, etc.

The only thing worse than "it looks like RS" posts are the "look at this old runescape book I found that everyone has seen before" posts.

Say you start an orc, walking to orgrimmar won't take long but once there the only place you can port to is thunder bluff or under city. First off no mage is gonna do it without you throwing some money which you won't have, and even if they do it for free and you go to UC that's at the top of the continent and its gonna be a solid 10 min run to get the first flight path. It's slow getting around in wow especially classic

He didn't die, he just used home teleport.
---
Every skill has methods that are less effective and thus are never used. That doesn't mean we should keep buffing them. The "issue" lies with the players wanting either xp/gp/afk at the highest rate they can get, which is fine. 
---
there's anvil smithing for the afkers, there's profit to be made at BF with higher tier bars for the moneymakers and there's gold ore for those who want experience. Players who go for post-99 can also do rune anvil smithing (2h/legs) for a bit of profit + exp, but the experience will be at a lower rate than BF.
---
Also I agree with some others in this thread, if anything they should nerf BF because it's OP.

Buy feather packs in Port Sarim for 200gp, sell the feathers on the GE for 3gp a piece. They may take a day or two to sell, but they will sell. It's a solid, proven method to getting a good first cash stack. If you were a member I'd say make cannonballs.

That's not a good counter argument, that doesn't explain how it's balanced for the game. How the furnace works is just lore.

Blast furnace's existence makes smelting bars at a regular furnace completely nonviable because not only does it save you time, it saves you money. You lose money making bars at a regular furnace. If one way saved you time (blast furnace) and one way saved you money (regular smelting) then there would be a choice. There isn't any choice right now. 
---
Even following your argument, a modern blast furnace can only reach about [50% fuel efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace). It would make more realistic sense if we were able to get a higher ratio of bars : ore, such as 1.25 : 1, at blast furnace rather than saving on fuel. Putting lore/realism aside for game balance is more important to me I don't care if it's realistic or not.

Well apparently they don't teach you how to spell useless

If training at sandcrabs at 85 range. Should I use a shortbow or runecrossbow? Would the difference be big? Cause I'm short on cash to afford broad bolts.
---
this and resizeable user interfaces for modern resolution screens. That is what will keep/bring in new players, not some new dead content update. Imagine people on a 1920 1080 laptop hearing about OSRS, trying it out and seeing this miniscule game ? They will be turned away immediately. We need game optimization updates more than anything else.

If you can stand it, runecrafting gets to be decent money at mid level and great money at high level.   It's a really slow and repetitive skill though so unless you're really patient it could burn you out.  Farming herbs is pretty good money at a fairly low level, with Ranarr herbs at level 32(?), which is probably what i would recommend.  Mining (Motherload Mine), Smithing (Blast furnace), and Woodcutting can be decent money around level 70ish and above, but the best money in the game is going to come from high level pvm. Most end game bosses give between 1 and 3 mil an hour and raids can be 5m-10m+ an hour depending on luck, and you can make 500k+ and hour 70+ slayer with tasks like wyverns and gargoyles.  Barrows can be done with medium stats and can get you 1m an hour if done efficiently
---
Fair enough, but would it be really hard to implement ? As CoX already tracks completed time afaik (or is that only on 3rd party clients?)
---
R/runescapegonewild
---
If you average around 90k/h then 99 range will take around 145 hours.
---
Ah yes, the blood of my enemies.
---
Depends on the image
---
As someone else replied you can't recoil/veng damage, forgot about that. So in that case it's completely pointless to try and tick eat it :P
---
Since he wants all the elites (91rc for double nats) my advice would be going even further to 77rc. That unlocks blood runecrafting so there is no real need to come back to zmi / lavas. Also no hassle getting a +5
---
Oh I'm sure it wouldn't be hard at all. But like I said, there doesn't seem to be much of a demand on Reddit or Twitter for it so I'm assuming they haven't really thought about it. Maybe raise some hell with some Mods and they'll consider it! Would be a nice update!

You actually start with 32 levels, so there should be 2,245 episodes.

Any tips for Zalcano? I just finished Song of the Elves last night and found that i‚Äôm not getting good drops (usually ranging from 15k-120k). Mining is around 70 and I only have a rune pickaxe. 
---
Is it my equipment/levels? Or is it more likely my skill in it? Is tick manipulation still a thing in there?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
I always type osrs at the beginning

3/4 players at dks is overkill. I wouldnt do then with more then 2 people. And even then with slightly higher stats OP could solo

Try joining the ‚Äúosrs gwd‚Äù clan chat. People look for groups in there all the time. You can find the clan chat directly through the GWD minigame Tab. (Same location as your quest log)

Hey man I got a 70 def 99 range piety account. Gonna make it a main. I‚Äôd love to dou some gwd with you. Tired of zulrah. Just got pet

You dont actually need 3/4 people for dks. A partner would be fine. But if you do want to try group bossing just join a clan chat.
---
How do i know if some of the quest item like orge bellows, snake charm, bonesack, etc can be safety discard? as osrs wiki didn't state some of the quest item can be safety discard.
---
She‚Äôll smite you for your bank. Careful

i got like 20m loot in 100 cor gauntlets, so thats like 1m/hour (assuming no deaths and max concentration). Not counting gp from shards
---
Yup, song of the elves has a section in that room.
---
It‚Äôs your level and your gear.  Tick manipulation is not a thing there anymore.  Get higher levels and a dragon pick and you‚Äôll make more!

Arclight is the most impt piece of gear. Since your stats is not that high to brute force thru the second phase I‚Äôll suggest 1 or 2 stamina pots. Wiki/YouTube should have some easy guides for it.

If it‚Äôs unreported, how confirm it for a statistic?

Thanks for explaining. Definitely a complex topic.
---
I mean there‚Äôs about a 1/17 chance of getting a barrows item on max reward potential. And I believe a dragon med is 1/1012. So yeah RIP to your RNG

Hahahah don‚Äôt let them flame you my g, 
---
I have a level 103 combat 82 slayer with no barrows gloves
---
U karma whores are the worst
---
Grats man :) its a good feeling! Maybe do dragon slayer next for rune plate? Unless its money issues that youre using addy plate. 
---
Ah i remember usin that gear setup on my rune pure back in 2002 on the og RS. R2h/legs/helm and addy plate instead of rune chain if money was low haha. 
---
Now that ya got a d scim, you should set your eyes on barrows gloves and doing recipe for disaster :P its a bit intimidating at first with the reqs for it (175 qp etc) however for newer accounts/lower stats it's a perfect goal since it unlocks mandatory quests you'll need, certain stats will be trained that you'll need, etc. Also the gloves are best in slot basically forever until you do dragon slayer 2 and get tormented bracelet, and thats just melee/mage respectively and b gloves are still BiS for range.

Good luck xd

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that as a beginner it‚Äôs not really necessary to understand things like combo eating. You won‚Äôt really benefit from that until later on in the game and at that point you will understand things better just by playing.

I'm averaging around 100k-110k gp per kill. Average time for me to kill the Corrupted Hunlef is around 11 minutes so that's almost 600k per hour which is worse compared to Zalcano and ToB.

Yup you're the asshole

Yes!!!! WE NEED MORE!!

I love doing hydra though. Tbh its way more enjoyable than vorkath, it does suck having to turael cancel and get them as a task, but its way more fun + I love the chance at a really good drop.

Use nieve or Steve as a slayer master if you‚Äôre going for xp. Block task that take forever. Cannon as many task as possible

Bandos not so much, but ancestral absolutely yes

Like I said, you could always go to to support and ask for the mute to be reconsidered. I am not one who is great with how the whole process goes as Ive never had it happen to me before but its worth a shot to see if it will get appealed.

Yeah your right high alch on mob is cancer
---
I did this and won and still play now it was great
---
It is not a graphics change; it is a performance improvement. Currently, the game only uses CPU but this would allow it to run off GPU as well. Another thing developed for Mobile was Interface Resizing, which was in the works for Desktop with Resizeable Mode but never finished. Both are working on Mobile and they are well worth porting to Desktop when they can.

99% of bikes can outperform their riders. The problem is fear. Your natural instinct is to slow down or get stiff or stare at something when you get scared/unsettled. The problem is, when you‚Äôre on a bike, all of those lead to bad things happening. 
---
If you stare at something, you tend to head towards it. We call this ‚Äútarget fixating‚Äù. So if you‚Äôre riding and you see something on the road and stare at it, you naturally start heading towards it because your body follows your head. I do this a lot on the track (I race motocross); it‚Äôs a hard habit to break. You don‚Äôt want to look at the rut as it‚Äôs coming...you want to look through the turn and towards where you‚Äôre heading. 
---
Another bad thing is getting off the gas. ‚ÄúWhen in doubt, throttle out.‚Äù If you go into a turn too fast on a motorcycle, the last thing you want to do is hit the brakes. Hitting the brakes makes your bike stand up and go straight; you can‚Äôt brake hard and still turn. The best thing you can do is just keep going and give it more gas. The bike will settle down and turn; the bike can always give more than you can.
---
How does one end up with 60 ranged and nearly 85 magic. Where did it go wrong my man
---
But you carried on and did it, gz beast.
---
I didn't think about stuff like that, but it makes sense. Hopefully, their optimizations to the Grand Library will help with that on Desktop since we shouldn't need GPU rendering to play the game comfortably, but it would still be nice to have, especially in those situations.
---
yeah my bad, i was still hyped when i posted this so i wrote it in caps.
---
The jad glitch isn't exclusive to fight caves. For example, if you die the last tick of a pest control game (assuming it wasn't fixed at the same time the fight caves was fixed) you will die on the mainland and lose your status.

I think you‚Äôre looking at it as ‚Äúeither everything made up is okay or none of it is‚Äù. Which is the wrong way to look at it. There‚Äôs a huge difference between the ambience of OSRS and WoW, and if you don‚Äôt see it then brother you‚Äôre in the wrong community.

Also struggles to understand in stores how much is 20% off 1 dollar

Definitely a lowball on that 50%

I think that girl is 12 not 23

I use barrows plate/legs slayer helm (i) infinity boots gloves malediction ward occult ma2 Cape and trident, works well and you dont really have to pray except ahrims and dharok. Then clan wars with Barrows teletabs rinse and repeat
---
Thanks man! Yeah it was pretty spooky
---
No, Obsidian set + Berserker Necklace + Obsidian Sword is the best until Dharok overtakes Obsidian at around 87-92 HP depending on the bosses you use.
---
83
---
If bp and tbow didnt exist, melee would be far superior to range and mage even with rigior. Mage might even be better than range in that situation.
---
you need to look up the definition of the word "optimize"

At the moment, I'm not considering uploading the app somewhere else. I think there are currently some other websites that have the apk file stored where you can download it from. But that's not done by me, so be cautious.
---
On my 1 def build, i did BP at nmz for 75-92, then chinned mm1 tunnels after 92 (since thr exp rates for chinning mm1 suckkkk pre 90 ish range).
---
Took me about 2 weeks or so for 75-92. These rates will increase the more you no life. 
---
My main concern is that you dont intend to do mm2, and rigour/ballista is op af on med lvls. Not sure why you wouldn't want that tbh.
---
Damn gotta hide my girl now
---
Honestly man, they might be nerfing the gmaul soon and it's a real bummer. If I were you, I would quest for mith gloves to get your attack xp.
---
Man I thought I was lucky getting two in 250 kc
---
I would watch this for days
---
virgin
---
Nah, most people don't want buyable pets so it's unlikely unless they add a wintertodt type boss for those skills.
---
Isn't this the equivalent of 5 years gameplay at 100k xp/hr? This person took "Save some pussy for the rest of us" to a whole new level.
---
What‚Äôs the point of this. 
---
It‚Äôs not really an accomplishment, you‚Äôre just making videos of yourself watching a program click stuff.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not used much, cause there are more affective methods. It‚Äôs just a really cool and interesting transportation system. Same with the Eagles
---
Guesting will be bit sketchy
---
Love this suggestion.
---
Elaborate? How was it offensive?
---
Also low detail mode will help a bit
---
86.2% is the amount you do, it avoids bolt racks and gives max runes.
---
He brought a tinderbox but no axe for the trees..? Guess he's burning the whole jungle down for his fire!
---
If you get a few range levels and complete ds2, camping vorkath would probably become viable for easy money. I have 90 slayer and it makes it seem like a waste of time in comparison, if money is the goal.
---
To make sure no one can steal info or hack account. Extra security I would think.
---
He's a pretty chill guy seems like he just likes to play rs a lot
---
D
---
No than it would not be 1 level per episode
---
Wrong again
---
And that dad bod gut model we've all been asking for
---
never done tob have we?
---
Haha as silly as it is, I actually love this!
---
99 ranged when he shoots his huge warm load in your face.
---
why am i having flash backs.. .where have i seen these before.
---
Why is obsidian better?
---
So he is giving almost 1b for finding him an impling that gives him rune cbow?
---
Just get stats for SOE and do zalcano it is over 3m an hour right now probably won‚Äôt be for long though.
---
And when scythe value drops....TOB gp/hr will drop as well, it being a large contributor to TOBs gp/hr as well
---
TBow is very overrated and hardly worth buying, it hits hard but is very slow therefore it is not worth using in a lot of places. Hell most of the time a Bone Crossbow will more than suffice and the superior choice.
---
Yup that's it.
---
Using a vpn hides only your ip literally makes 0 difference for account security
---
Thanks!
---
If your are using any sort of vpn that shares ip it is a huge security issue because if a bot farm is using the same one and they ip ban you are also ip banned with nothing you can do.
---
Well... they kinda fucked up porting it over from rsc to rs2 and it hasnt been changed since
---
Light alooootttttt. But yeah, in terms of top pagers he seems to be pretty cool.
---
Oh. Okay I didn't understand how any of it worked. Nevermind then
---
Blast furnace would still be way better gp/hour cause you could make more bars.
---
Fuck off I‚Äôm over 1000 kills with only 1.....üò´
---
Thata cool I guess, but I just achieved 99 fetching so... who's the real gamer here
---
Hope theres some pussy left for the rest of us after this
---
Where are these raid masses you speak of that put up with that?
---
I could have gotten 24, if it weren't for you meddling kids
---
It is?
---
Karma whore elsewhere.
---
Ahh ty for explanation, downvotes welcome though lmao
---
How many hours did it take lynx titan?
---
&gt;don‚Äôt have to worry about efficiency anymore
---
I think he said he‚Äôll be playing the alt still until he can afford a scythe and then he‚Äôll be doing efficient bossing methods like tanking with the alt. But I‚Äôm sure some grinds will be a lot more relaxed than efficient skilling + alt.
---
Thank you! I've never known where to look
---
when i see some guy pull out the sgs, i think, "wow what a loser. he is so poor eh sacrifice dps for the free heal"

Theyre pretty common from the gauntlet.  Ive gotten 3 elites from regular gauntlet in about 30kc, I've probably gotten stupid lucky with that but still take that fwiw

Some locations on the map are always depicted as night time, just as most of the map is day.  Adding a day night cycle whilst keeping the areas of the map feeling unique could be challenging. Though I'd like to see the results even if it wasn't implemented.

I'm pretty certain there was a shooter threat at Anime Expo just last year. With some venues housing tens of thousands of attendees many take quite a few precautions.

Have you tried it on the same account more than once? I believe I did after seeing the pop up for a free week. It said my account already used it. But this way is how a lot of botters get free 1 week p2p accounts and suicide bot them.

When‚Äôs the auction to buy his gaming chair so I can take a smell?

Gz Jase!!!

If you listen closely you can hear lynx give a slight  reeeee in approval
---
Watch someone put up an angry post because Jagex now acknowledges 200m all ingame, providing incentive to grind it.
---
Not that there‚Äôs incredible value in pets excluding a few. (CM Olm dust, Olmlet, and Zuk) Giving buyable skills a pet in my opinion is just dumb. Plus everything doesn‚Äôt need to include a pet. But at this point I‚Äôm pretty sure everything in the future will.

since hes maxed now he can finally play the game

like u said its relaxed now

Since its inception. [Here is the damage formula](https://twitter.com/JagexEd/status/869168964609429504?s=20) posted over 2 years ago which explicitly includes your FM level as part of the calculation.
---
If you're a real noob and this isn't fake I find it unironically impressive that you managed monkey madness before dragon slayer.
---
Its actually better to stay f2p till at least 50fm because the fire making routes to 50 are the same for f2p and p2p I believe. And it wouldn't be to bad to knock out knights sword as f2p for easy smithing lvls.
---
Shield is only 1/100

Very nice

The mark of grace drop rate is reduced to 20% of its normal rate when you are 20 or more levels higher than the course req.

They already did when Jagex congratulated Lynx Titan the same way.

This shoot was done at Campzone, which is mostly just a LAN party with a cosplay competition. I first wore it to Animecon NL though, and I will be wearing it again to Abunai in 2 weeks.

sure yeah i can do that for you.
---
best resolution I can do is a picture with a Canon EOS700D
---
will have to be tomorrow morning in the sunlight
---
melee on task arclight is best dps, however its only worth if you have a tank. So if you really want to solo wich i wouldnt recommend tbow kiting is the way to go. Other than that get a friend to tanl or use an alt
---
What are you using to heal? Brews/Restores were more than enough for me. The ratio is 3 brews: 1 restore
---
Hey my dude, looks like you‚Äôre getting too much kill potential while down in the catacombs. You should only kill two skeletons and one worm to get 86% kill potential. Any more than that, you actually lower the average value of your chests. Over 86% is when you start getting bolt racks and dragon med helms which actually lower your average value compared to just sticking with runes and barrow armor drops.

Definitely not. It's at the beginning of every search.

It's acknowledged client-side for the person who gets 200m all by a chatbox that says "Congratulations, [Player Name]!" with an image of a beer on the left. 
---
There are also more fireworks (spread out over more tiles than just the player's head) than max, and they last longer. Mod Curse showed this on his screenshot on Twitter. 
---
Lastly if you want to get literal about it, fake XP drops are also an acknowledgement from Jagex of 200m in a skill.
---
Bro, Ironmen? But I agree they should add potions that can‚Äôt be traded like they‚Äôve done in RS3, gives a bigger purpose to mainscape.

It‚Äôs still impressive. I have been playing guitar for 12 years and I‚Äôm probably nowhere near 30,000 hours. 
---
I can play at any hour of the day, but I don‚Äôt have the dedication he has to actually get those numbers. 
---
Have you done one specific thing for 30,000 hours? If not, then why are you even commenting about this?
---
Why do you use a slayer helmet?

I appreciate how long this meme must‚Äôve taken to make.  Have you ever considered doing this full time?

Lol what? You think you can‚Äôt bite through your tongue or break your finger? What a weird first sentence, and ironic too because it seems you don‚Äôt. The brain makes it easier for us to hurt ourselves if we feel like we have to, it protects us the best it can by reducing pain, our natural instinct is to resist but we can just keep going. By reducing pain and adrenaline surging, people can do all sorts of things while horribly injured. Theres that hiker that cut off his arm with a dull pocket knife after being pinned under a rock for 5 days, with 16oz of water, and then hiked back to a city after doing it. Also literally all the people that have powered through their fears and actually committed suicide. Your hand won‚Äôt just freeze if you go to snap one of your fingers, you may be scared of the pain but you can do it.
---
the issues are a lot of skill suggestions are just hybrids of other skills, lots of ideas should be used to enhance current skills.
---
it's hard to think of a skill that would be good in osrs without fucking everything up.
---
summoning is a good example of a new skill but it would fuck a lot of things up if it came in plus I doubt people would want it.
---
idk , the wiki says so
---
Lmao just a second place what a waste of time
---
Nice facism btw
---
No rush, shipping is estimated two weeks, so I wasn't expecting it an any time soon
---
Removing that duct tape won't be pleasant ... ouch
---
They talk about their player retention ideas and its stupid shit like making early game easier, those changes won't make the difference for anyone, it'll just give bots a more optimal route to whatever they're trying to accomplish.
---
This right here though is a real suggestion, anyone playing on a 2560x1440 or a 4k monitor will open the game up, see it takes up about 1/10th of their screen and just close out of it, unless ofcourse they have a friend to tell them about 3rd party clients (sad).
---
Better than "Go outside - love jagex" (This message was seriously in game around 2010 after getting 99 all.
---
This meme use to be osrs mobile in the mirror :)
---
I think it was a fair trade. Emblems are now around 60k about half of what they were at IIRC. The average loot for the new keys is over 100k. Even with slower drop rates they should even out.
---
I think this helps combat emblem farmers as it was a huge problem and they have effectively cut the costs in half while still making wildy slayer profitable.
---
No he hasn't, but he have streamed his achievements the past 3 years.
---
Yea. Healers where what got me. Good luck. You'll get it

7/12s normally &amp; nah not if you work with a good group of people and a good foreman.

Coming from an ex-NEET its hard to even wake up and not sleep 16 hours a day. Wake up. Play game. Maybe edge myself 3-4 hours. Pass out. Wake up. Drink 8 monsters. Feel tired because dehydrated. Go back to sleep. Play game. Lurk reddit / 4chan. I'd trade my family for that life because its no responsibility though. Good 2 years of nothingness 2010-2012.

yea, the mods told us they added a message before lynx got 200m

Did you just call yourself a pedophile

I usually just pray melee and piety and punch the double agent to death. There's an altar right where you do the clue step so you don't need to worry about running out of prayer. With only 70s for combat stats you might prefer to bring along some unfinished darts+feathers, but it isn't necessary at all.
---
In 3, 2, 1..
---
It's already atrocious enough that it had the accuracy bonus of a rapier that comes from the hardest teamwork-oriented content in the game. Zero fucking support. Sounds like your broke ass just wants a cheapshot overpowered weapon that anyone could use tbh.
---
 Thats the thing, i did. Everytime i read carefully what they want and try to provide the stuff they ask but yet again being denied. This is why i have no clue anymore and feeling kinda hopeloess as it feels that they just deny my recovery anyways. As of right now they mentioned:   
---
"When you created the account (MM/YYYY)  
---
If you have moved state/country, (let us know from where to where)  
---
Creation Country (Country + State if you're appealing from the US)  
---
Creation and most recent ISP (Internet Service Provider - for example BT, Virgin, Comcast, SBC etc.)  
---
Any additional information which you cannot enter elsewhere in the form (for example multiple transaction ID numbers for your billing)"  
---
But i already provided them multiple times with different transaction ID's for example.   
---
I provided my old ISP and recent ISP with IP. The ISP the account was created on went under and was bought by another company. I don't know if my IP has changed due that situation, nor do i remember the old one if it has been changed from so many years ago.   
---
I'm still in the same country, same adress, same state. I litterly have a creation e-mail with the exact date inside my mail which i provided the date from.   
---
This is why i have no idea what to do next and i just gave up on the recovery already because it feels pointless. It's also alot of work and time searching everything, going through bank statements, password logs, using my brain to dig old info which is from 9+ years ago while in the meantime i could make a picture of my face holding my own passport if i want to and attach it as a file to proof i'm the actual owner. I mean if a account gets recovered over 4 times with different bunch of information and yet you still deny it. I just don't know what you want from me anymore in that situation, it feels horrible actually. It also makes me that frustrated that i get in a bad mood about it and ruin the peace at home. It's just a anoying headache right now and it doesn't look good unfortunately.
---
Rapier is +94 stab, not slash. It only has +55 slash. So in situations where the enemy has sizeably better stab defence than slash defence, the whip should produce higher DPS than the rapier despite the strength bonus difference.
---
Could also be the OP saying "H" to flag this as humour.
---
he said on stream he has like 700-800m xp on rs3
---
Lynx titan not zezima lmao.
---
Hans Zimmer music too, epic
---
How much would that cost on a ironman?
---
Pretty sure. He went homeless so he could continue to no-life rs3 outside of a library using public wifi. I have a friend who was probably 6th or so to 200m agility, and she told me some pretty cringe things about him.
---
Well, it has about 200 rings, and the ones I could find here were pretty expensive. Filament is pretty cheap so the material costs now are like 10 bucks max. I already have my own 3D printer so that's no issue. Plus, now the plastic itself is immediately the right color. If I had to paint them, they would scuff and lose the color pretty quickly, because of all the rings rubbing together.
---
GWD are much more worth killing than KQ, garg and thermy lol. Using scythe at KQ would be actively losing money, so its not 'better' really. Tbow at GWD only improves it.
---
&gt;If you're going by "worth killing" then only tob is worth doing (all other moneymakers are shit compared), and it just happens so that scythe is huge there.
---
Inferno is more important content, and a tbow is way better there.
---
