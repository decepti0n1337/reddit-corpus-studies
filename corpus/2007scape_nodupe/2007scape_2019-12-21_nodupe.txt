All of the things I listed other than maybe raids are pretty much guaranteed gems. Like every few Sarachnis kills is 30 gems. Brimstone keys are rare but you get them just for slayer and give gems pretty commonly. But I guess if you want a monster just to yourself go ahead.
---
The wilderness is a pvp area. Players that come here are spread over hundreds of different worlds making the wilderness not that dangerous. I propose restricting the wilderness to 20 or 30 worlds.
---
You disagree with the prevailing opinion so the world is ending? boo hoo.
---

---
If you spend time playing a competitive gamemode then it's perfectly reasonable that the acknowlegement of your accomplishment you get isn't going to be just trashed in future by being trivialised.
---
That's got fuck all to do with partnerships.
---
Better help than jagex support PogChamp

Holy shit. Ive killed so many of those back when it was the place to train. And im JUST now realizing that it was a wolf... In sheeps cloathing. Thanks.
---
I'm just curious if anybody changed their mind at all, or if OSRS just became more popular and those new people wanted pets. It's not a bad thing but you can look back at the polls and see the change from pets barely passing polls to bosses being polled specifically with pets and always passing.

Comment about color combo
---
It's a scam. 
---
To check for your self ***MANUALLY*** go to the runescape website and log in, then check the email and communications tab in your account settings.
---
It's too late I'm now 6 kc, need a tome =(

Also back in the day these were common to train on.

Copic!

MooüêÑ

&gt; boo hoo

You need a reward no one else can get to feel justified in playing a piece of entertainment? boo hoo
---
Get out of here with weak ass shit insults as a reply.
---
A competitive game mode can be competitive on the hiscores. Just like **everything else in this game**. Why does this one need an untradeable discontinued trophy except to pander to people like yourself who feel the need to show off in a game you didnt even grind?
---
All of that is fair enough, but if the content creators had played it more they would have just said not to put the update in game as it is basically just points for kills instead of points for emblem risks, meaning it is less risking for bots to farm points. Thus the consensus that it should be reverted now is the same consensus they would have reached if they had played the beta - leave old bh instead of changing it for the worse.
---
Pizza man tried approaching Godex on twitter WITHOUT 50k+ followers and expected results?? Imbecil!

What is the hood two rows below Robin hood hat?

Getting anglers was definitely an experience. I just wish they could make these activites more interactive and enjoyable
---
&gt; Also quit with the new player angle.
---
No. Its a circumstance that will happen very frequently for myself as it does already wearing a max cape and red graceful. Good thing about those items? They're obtainable. 
---
&gt; UNIQUE Untradable trophy 
---
Yes, i read that too. Heres my understanding, it works just like league-to-league rewards which they didn't feel the need to award people 7 versions of an untradeable discontinued item for that.
---
* You place dragon tier in Twisted Leagues. You get to show off the dragon tier cup until the next league ends. Then your trophy changes to what tier you placed in the next league, say Rune.
---
* Its examine / inspect option lists all your past leagues, your tier, and your rank + points. This is for you, and youir accomplishments.
---
That creates a unique untradeable trophy, but doesnt discontinue it. It also allows players who grind a side mode competitively to show off their trophie, and still have a miniscule way to show their past accomplishments (i still think hiscores is a better option here, but they're commited to **deleting** your competitive work in that regard).
---
I'll hope to have my giant shovel soon!

:)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
---
ü¶ÄJMODS WONT RESPOND TO THIS THREADü¶Ä
---
Sorry lol
---
Fair enough but if you are making a pure you just stick it at crabs or nmz and afk it for a few weeks till you are satisfied with its stats and go pk. Sure it's more involved if you want a zerker or a med level, but if you really want to practice pking there is always clan wars and castle wars which are still active enough to find some fights. And tourney worlds are fantastic for testing different builds and gear before you make the plunge and actually make an account.
---
Pures and low levels are some of the most active brackets so to get into starter pking it's pretty simple.
---
So this is where my tax money goes to... Grats.
---
#what the fuck lol
---
That's called hold-out cross validation. E.g TimeSeriesSplit in scikit-learn.
---
What the fuck lol
---
Fire wave pking btw and this is just for fun u don‚Äôt just use one combat type usually it‚Äôs just a fun build
---
I'd like to think that they were shit faced
---
The inner machinations of my switches are an enigma.
---
ghostly robes give better mage bonus, idk if you can get those or not with your build
---
3 zenytes and vork tasks got me the same and I'm closing in on 85. Even the meh ones add up.
---
&gt; It's being anal about literal items ingame.
---
Thats what this entire game is. Grinding for ingame items with no actual purpose. Its a game. Its all being anal about silly unimportant things.
---
&gt; you're not able to get untrimmed capes in 22 skills, and it's possible to permanently lose your untrimmed cape on accident if you meant to keep it
---
Correct and this has been brought up to devs multiple times by said completionists and brushed aside due to it "not working retroactively". Same reason they delayed collection log.
---
&gt; To me the irl inferno cape woox got is not that much different than a subset of unique unobtainable items in runescape's item database
---
Being lazy irl isnt exactly the same as a physically impossible to obtain item without modifying a game (aka. breaking the rules by modifying the game and getting banned).
---
Guys stop hating on Jagex so much, it isn't fair. This could happen to anyone, and besides, any $11 subscription game would make the same mistake. We should just be grateful they at least read the first line. That's progress, right guys?
---
A video is undoubted harder to fake. Had you just posted this when I asked it wouldn't have gone so far. I wouldn't even have second guessed it, but based on your personality and how long it took you to come up with this vid, I still don't believe you. There was no other reason to beat around the bush about it. And I only ever called you a liar which I still believe you are.

Classic case of r/SelfAwareWolves
---
&gt; regurgitated trophies from future leagues.
---
I've made suggestions that don't do this for "competition obsessed" players like yourself.
---
&gt; "rewards only in leagues"
---
I never said i only wanted that. Their is a plethora of tradeable rewards i happily voted yes for.
---
&gt; If a trophy with the years/winner etc engraved on it isnt "nearly the same but different" then what is chofl.
---
Thats exactly what we should use hiscores for "chofl".
---
&gt; Tradable or non-unique trophies
---
Both suggestions i didn't make. The fact you think you can't have unique trophies without them being discontinued only exists because you want to keep your unique trophy FOREVER.
---
&gt; And the playerbase wanted that changed
---
I would accept that if it were polled. I dont care about the trophy itself, I care about the lack of polling in general.
---
Crashbendicootwoah.gif
---
I never stated or implied the mentioned users strictly used Tor in order to commit fraud, that is something you assumed. 
---
More than one piece of robust software and depending on the payment platform, identity documents are required to fool modern security systems into allowing a transaction to take place, and even then one wrong move will doom any attempt at fraud. 
---
Once the details check out, fraudsters buy gold and shift it through multiple accounts before finally reselling it through another account. RSGP is not subject to the same regulatory requirements as FIAT currencies ergo making it harder to link back to the initial fraud. 
---
Cute narrow minded approach, though.
---
Cool story bro.
---
An inspect or examine option could do that... or you know, hiscores. The thing we use to remember the past in everything, and that actually gives detail not just "you placed top 1.3k players".
---
ITT people with robotic style
---
thats okay, most of their takes come down to "youre a loser if you care about anything at all ever" like they made fun of al gore for global warming and their "apology" episode was still smug as all fuck

I‚Äôve seen their apology. It was awesome
---
Ugh, what do you mean I can't go back and compete for the 1952 Olympic gold medal? That's unbelievable, wtf, fricking discontinued items..
---
Dont forget this is also a time where most people are spending time with their families. Just look at destiny 2 the time gating of rewards in that game is so fuckin out of control. Its a slippery slope for sure and im absolutely not cool with it. I would have grinded if 1. I knew they would be discontiuned and 2. I was actually able to play for that 2 week period where the servers went to shit.
---
Do you do birdhouse and farm runs, specifically trees for the xp? Afk NMZ for combat, splash for afk. If you can do some of those at work you'll probably see some nice increases
---
For real, imagine a decade of this bullshit where the people breaking the rules only get more savvy and harder to control.
---
Obby for a lil bit longer then dh check out bitters calc
---
I've heard Obby is better until around 92 HP, at which point doing DH at 1HP with Absorption Pots is better.

there are thousands of goblins in that spot. he should either kill them or get pj'd. sure another goblin can attack but there are time when im quicker. fuck that brew down box shit. aids as fuck.

So ... Your friend got unbanned, so fuck everyone else right?
---
Feel like they're gonna patch this and be a lot more stringent about actual hijacked accounts if this takes off
---
They are going to run out of areas to run leagues in eventually, just make the trophies area themed and make them obtainable again when they rotate back to the old areas.
---
Nah the Christmas event was a newer jmods first small task just like Halloween I believe. Everyone got mad at gee for the elves but people get mad about anything.  Remember how mad people got when a simple t bow spawned?
---
Imbued mage cape is worth the upgrade.
---
one of my favorite comments that really sums up southpark reads as follows: "It‚Äôs a show that teaches its audience to become lazy and self-satisfied, that praises them for being uncritically accepting of their own biases, and that provides them with an endless buffet of thought-terminating cliches suitable for shutting down all manner of challenges to their comfort zones."
---
&gt; buy and trade?
---
This is the opinion of the masses being okay with discontinued items, because they don't understand them.
---
No, no one wants them tradeable. They were never polled as tradeable. They are now being made **discontinued**. Which means they are never obtainable again.
---
The next league will happen and you'll get trophies from that league, but this league trophies will remain unobtainable by any new player, and the dragon trophy by 99% of the playerbase for example.
---
OSRS has a serious issue where the actual combat and gameplay is garbage so the mechanics of their other content suffers for it.
---
DS2 was by no means enjoyable, the fight was basically ok dodge these abilities or get 1 shot, super fun, great quest.
---
As for puzzles and stuff being the enjoyment of the quest, that isn't for me. I will eventually do Song of the Elves but I am in no rush, and when the real comparison is Song of the Elves compared to Plagues End, I really dont expect Song to be anything I remember after I finish it. 
---
Seren looks better in OS than I was expecting her to though, but OSRS is missing far too much of what makes the Runescape lore good to really care about. No Mahjarrat?? Fucking seriously????
---
They charge up to like 40 for premium slot you have torso complete in around 50-60 minutes

Yeah I have heard this? I need to imbue some rings as well as the slayer helm so I might do this I am Base 70 combat is this enough?
---
When could you ever do green dragons in f2p? Not sure what you mean by rune either..
---
I highly doubt you were scammed by BA services. There are lots of scammers that impersonate them, which is why their CC name is "We dont pm". If you were pm'ed and then traded someone your GP, that's not their fault. 
---
They have a huge reputation - there's no reason for them to ruin it by scamming. You probably traded the wrong player. I don't think they're able to reimburse you for that, either.
---
lol fuck the what
---
oh its not like his face was boggled as hell, it's just that his cheek bone and nose bone were... uh... detached
---
he looks 95% fine now, you wouldn't notice if you didn't know
---
he was trying to stop a cow from going a certain direction, and cows are pretty passive so almost every single time they'll run in the opposite direction (unless they have calves they're super protective of), but this one decided to run through him instead
---
Its not something that has ever come up in game
---
&gt; lms and bh changes were balancing changes
---
I'm sorry but how can you call a rework a balancing change? The BH Rework was announced at two RuneFests as a main update. Reworks in the past have been polled so those should have been polled as well.
---
And I would not say that lying to the player base is a laughable distinction. The rewards were polled with the J Mods clearly saying [they would not be discontinuied](https://clips.twitch.tv/CorrectTameElkWoofer). They said this multiple times across livestreams and newsposts, so it wasn't just a slipup. The only place that even suggested they could be discontinued was one small bit of grammar in the poll blog, but it can be interrupted multiple ways. So throwing out everything said in the past and twisting the wording to change the meaning of a poll instead of repolling as they've done in the past when they screwed up the wording is extremely bad and a dangerous precedent to set.
---
It doesn't matter how little you care about the difference between a trophy being discontinued or not. If you just let it slide every time they undermind the polling system, it will come back to bite you when they screw with something that has a larger impact or when it is something you care about. We can't only uphold the rules when we care; every time they go against the polling system is notable and should be a big deal.
---
Omfg i tried this once to get a mute appealed and it worked i forgot about that
---
manually doin barb pots is quicker xp anyway
---
Glad to hear about this, beer man!

i suggest if u want life easy go play https://www.runescape.com/community
---
You werent scammed by ba services and if you were scammed by a rank the admins would cover it
---
This ^  OP do you know the username of the person who scammed you?
---
Very admirable, nice!
---
Fucking lost it.
---
Can anyone else explain? OP‚Äôs account got deleted.
---
*for white people. POC can wear whatever color they want and still look fly as hell, it's amazing and I'm jealous
---
In all honesty, I don't know for sure. I tried both methods and I found running to sire took me too long. Banking takes just a bit longer (maybe 1.5 x the time) than going to the poh and you do it once every 5 kills approx.
---
It's maybe odd, but for smoky, I do the poh method because 2x claw spec and he is at less than half health even though the run to it is long. I find on sire the spec wasn't that useful or necessary with max combat and arclight.
---
I would be interested if someone actually calculates kill per hour with both method. However without someone calculating it, I would go with how I experienced it as better to not use the poh for every kill.
---
Veterans cape for what? OSRS has been out for 6 years
---
Torso is not really viable with randoms on low lv irons/baby zerkers.
---
They dont take payment till you are about to start rounds
---
Ba services is legit. You didn't trade the right people. Sucks though. Be more careful.
---
or alternatively: remove possibility from getting basilisks, costs more? yes, but its free permanent block until you unlock them again.
---
An hour a day with smithing? What are you smithing out of curiosity.
---
Yeah. While green d'hide armour is available in f2p, green dragons are not (as killable monsters that is). Free to play has runite and green dragonhide armour, yew bow and spells up to fire blast (death runes) along with teleblocks and entangles for pvp. There's also a unique item from Obor the hill giant which is called hill giant's club. It's a bis for crush similar to rune 2h is fir slash. To get to obor you need to obtain a giant's key from hill giants. As others have said, you're best off buying bonds and going to p2p

ive seen them on entrana just not the others coz they cut off from gielinor tbh other than alkarid

Sounds like something somebody working for an organization that's trying to cover up a scam would say...

I guess I never really got that style of content creation but recognize that some people enjoy it like sparc Mac. What‚Äôs the appeal? I always just assumed Sparc and Oda‚Äôs viewers were younger but maybe that was a bad assumption

Hey thanks brother ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
you can just go to rev caves or green drags and kill vennies. No one pks with 60 def. Dunno what your stats are but a 60 atk 70 def acc is considered the strongest pking account in the game atm.
---
Did he PM you or did he talk in cc? Was a rank in the cc? They have a Twitter account. Try asking them if he is a member if their cc.
---
Level 3 my ass
---
Scouting raids adds a lot of complexity though. You have to work around certain things like your hp going into vasa/vespula, getting rooms in certain orders, picking up specific boss drops while leaving others, etc. If you make it all random, it won't reward individual strategy nearly as much
---
This though? https://twitter.com/JagexSupport/status/1200736433058832385

The points from player made pots are split between the guy who picks and guy who makes. For ovls its whoever picks nox and whoever adds nox to the 3 combat pots
---
I mean, skill capes arn't really a fair comparison, it would be more like the clue scroll uniques from doing a certain number of clues being different slightly every few months and only the best one for the top 1% for the month... which I would also be fine with...
---
Shaking my smh?
---
(5x people in the raid )+ 5
---
Last 5 decay substantially, the first 5x are full points with a 50% multiplier if you sip pots you did not acquire yourself
---
I mean, if the twisted logo was so important to you... why didn't you play it?
---
I started 12 years ago and haven‚Äôt even come close to this...
---
Don't want to speak for him but the feeling for dailies seems to be it makes people feel "forced" to login. There is a sense of loss if you don't login and do this "free xp" type stuff. As with many things, all comes back to the eternal RS addiction.
---
To be fair, bird nest are almost 5k right now

I can't figure out your accent at all

Theyre fine, maybe a bit useless except for pking practice or just messing around. You can practice pvm on the beta worlds now

I mean we could have shops that sell anything, but I shouldn't be able to go to a shop and buy the champions cape without grinding for it right?

I'm a skiller so I do sharks via minnows and sell magic logs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5lN2JcPhRY with this guide I killed him on first try.
---
They don't track when you first played OSRS, and giving veteran capes based on RS3 playtime is a bad idea, since many people use new accounts for OSRS (old password forgotten/account insecure/didn't matter if it's a new account).

safe spot method is for 3Head's that like being pked, use the southwestern lure method

Yes, I gave up my time in the main game to get something that will show what I gave that time up to. The trade able rewards are not going to be worth shit, they are too cheap point wise, the only thing prestigious is the untradeable trophy.

Playing twisted leagues. Trying to make enough money to buy a rune pick from toothy. My current method is stealing silk and reselling. But is there a better way to go about making money or getting a rune pick in general? Thanks
---
Making cannonballs untradeable would be pretty dumb
---
They've said in the past (or people have speculated, don't remember) that they might be used for something in the future, like a fossil island boss or something. Most people seem to recommend hoarding them for now because they might be more useful in the future.
---
Not for Ironman that‚Äôs it there forever making them üòÇ idc about ge
---
Oh, this is an actual reply? I was thinking someone photoshopped it
---
I‚Äôm just saying leave the slow method in place and tradable but have a non afk slightly faster version but those are untradable ..
---
I'm the first image when I pick the wrong option for Pauline in Livid Farm in pre-EoC RS2.
---
So make 2 different versions of cannonballs then? nah
---
Grinding Wintertodt to 99 Firemaking gives a decent cash stack. You can also get a rune pickaxe from clues.
---
Ya Have the same effect just one is tradable one is not. I mean imo it can‚Äôt hurt anything 98% of cballs in ge are prob botted anyways lol supply isn‚Äôt gonna slow down

That‚Äôs fair. I feel like every single comment on this subreddit could be taken that way. But it was (mostly) praise, lol

It was only a matter of time before someone took advantage of this sub's eagerness to shit on Jagex support to create some fake outrage. Doesn't surprise me at all considering how people don't try to validate anything and just jump to "lol jagex support bad upvotes please üòé".

Does trying to flex by bringing up your ‚Äúemployees‚Äù somehow make you feel better about playing for an absurd amount of time? Sitting or standing, staring at a screen for that long is awful for your eyes and you will regret it later in life. Not only that, you should consider finding additional hobbies. Literally half of your day is spent on this game every day (greater than half if you exclude sleeping).
---
[From the wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rare_fossilised_limbs) They can be used at the mycelium pool to be calcified into a rare enriched bone via a chemical process that uses pyrophosphite and calcite. Once completed, check the rinsing pool to obtain the enriched bones. They are then used on the easternmost strange machine in the House on the Hill for 2,500 Prayer experience.

No what lol

What you literally just posted...?

oh please mister jagex, ironman mode is just so slow and so hard. i know i can‚Äôt buy cannonballs from other players (unless.....), but can it at least be made easier just this one time pretty please? it just makes sense!!

Yeah I remember in the quest at the end I think he was like how could you do that she was so fragile etc

So what basically everything was her doing is the idea

And what she attacks us because we have figured out the wisdom 
---
You know there is a lot of question
---
Learned to brid on them in 2010, spent a lot of time with clan friends on one. Haven't spent time on any since osrs came out, but they're valuable for learning how to pk, though since the best ones are even more optimized for pvp than real osrs, you'll probably still have to adjust to pking on real osrs (e.g. the barrage delay bug in osrs is removed in most rsps lol).

Congrats on the achievement little buddy! It must have been mighty hard playing for 12 hours a day for 8 months! See how ridiculous that sounds? I don‚Äôt mean for you to be taking this the wrong way, but that‚Äôs nothing to be happy about. The achievement sure, but the time frame behind it... not so much.

Yeah my bad I thought that page had the BIS setups but it just lists highest bonuses. [Here are the best F2P setups.](https://i.imgur.com/nfyKIH1.jpg) Strength ammy can be swapped out for power ammy with melee.

Not OP but maybe since they mentioned moving from China they have a different email host there that they would like to stop using and switch to one more widely used in the US.
---
Yes.
---
The real fun is pure nhing. Sliding, hugging, having to nail every pray switch, hitting fakies like your mouse is on PCP. It's way better to learn how to brid on a pure than on an account with def imo. You get punished and lose momentum so hard if you get a pray wrong, whereas on a main its way more lenient.
---
Lol you can put healers with adamant darts I‚Äôm pretty sure, dragon darts are probably overkill

if only the writing was good enough to actually make the play feel a single ounce of emotion for the characters

I guess you‚Äôll always be a hater. I like your googled medical advice. üñï
---
I think it's definitely doable. The top 1% is really doable so long as you go for the right relic choices. All the points are more or less locked behind skilling so it's 100% doable. Lots of TL players are locked out because they went the pvm route which gives no points whatsoever bc jagex balancing

are people actually fuming over a holiday item? i need to see this but i dont have twitter :/
---
Hardly good at all lol. Management team is full of slimelords who'll pay you then chargeback immediately when they're done with you.
---
I think Jagex are botting their Twitter account.
---
What do you do??
---
I think the main reason it isn't too popular is that it only works well if you go all in. RS3 has tried to do some polls over the years since OSRS, but they tend to do some and then stop for a while or if they do stay active, they only poll a fraction of the updates and decisions. While having some say is better than none, at that point it can end up as the devs letting you have a say when it doesn't matter and not letting you vote on things you'd want to vote on.
---
So if other games were to try to poll more like OSRS, they would likely run into an issue when they release an update without a poll and players, even if only a minority, dislike it. At the same time, if they do try to poll everything like OSRS, that can be a large burden since it can slow down development since everything needs to be approved by the community. Then there is also the risk of things failing that the company might want to do for business reasons. This is especially true of games that feature multiple monetization methods; OSRS is pretty simple with just membership which isn't hindered much by polls but in other games with MTX, Expansions, and the like it is harder to work polls around that.
---
Another reason is why OSRS has polls, to begin with, and why the same can't be said of most games. OSRS is a retro-MMO and the polls arose from players not wanting the game to change in ways they disliked from that nostalgic base. While players of most games wouldn't want changes they disliked, chances are most communities aren't as in favor of nothing as the baseline and aren't as concerned of changes that they'd need a 75% supermajority to approve. TBH, you could argue that OSRS has outgrown the current polling system, at least in some aspects, since the original fears that inspired it aren't as prevalent and the recent reaction to increasing unpolled updates can suggest this is the case.
---
So you‚Äôre implying then that it being untradeable equates it to being discontinued? Even if a player could obtain the trophy via trading that still means it‚Äôs a discontinued item. 
---
This also doesn‚Äôt resolve the issue with the question telling you to reference the blog. The blog page is separated by section and in the REWARDS section, it lists the trophy. The question in the FAQ it talks about how ‚ÄúWe will not make discontinued **rewards** with leagues.‚Äù
---
The problem with the poll is that it references the blog and the only thing the blog really states is that they won‚Äôt make discontinued rewards with leagues. It doesn‚Äôt even say twisted league specifically in that last part. 
---
The fact this discussion is even taking place only shows Jagex wasn‚Äôt very clear on it, but I guess it‚Äôs just easy to dismiss the issue as just saying the other side doesn‚Äôt/can‚Äôt read it (not what I‚Äôm saying).
---
Why did bananas spike in price? Almost doubled in price in 2 weeks. Couldn‚Äôt even get orders to go through for 200.
---
Better than current support
---
Possibly... If you are on task, that seems like it would be more than enough. Off task, it might not be as easy. Even if you can out DPS the healers, I'd still suggest trying to get at least some of the healers off Jad. The Blowpipe might be high enough DPS, but it is still easy to get bad RNG and miss a bunch as it heals back up.
---
The point of osrs is that it is isn't changing much from what people already loved. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" strategy. Osrs was already great. 
---
But osrs did not become great using a polling system. A skill like Slayer would never have passed a poll using today's system. Not in a million years.

It's a setting called "Status Bars"

Holy shit you really are just a stereotypical trust fund baby, it‚Äôs actually hilarious. It‚Äôs so incredibly obvious you‚Äôve never had any type of struggle in your life, your parents take care of everything for you. Pathetic. Get off this 20 year old game and actually do something good for the world instead of sucking the teet of your parents money bags and thinking that your actually doing something productive.
---
Absolute mad man, i like it.
---
You think they lock accounts like this mostly because they‚Äôre being played on different devices, or different locations? Idk exactly how VPN‚Äôs work but I‚Äôd imagine the location can only matter so much. I also don‚Äôt know if Jagex can actually see the MAC addresses of the devices being used to play the game
---
If they did, Jagex rations would be like 0.01g and a four loko for $11
---
Also a valid strat. If using BP/rune + darts/anguish etc should easily out dps just a few healers.

Well what do you expect? When was the last time that you personally went to clan wars or castle wars? It would be a damned shame for the devs to waste time on "team based" content if it's just not going to be played. 
---
People often refer to RS2 as the "golden age" of runescape and reminiscence on times gone by. But really, the core of the game has remained the same, it's the player base that changed. People don't enjoy useless activities like castle wars simply because it is considered (perhaps rightfully so) a waste by the vast majority of people.
---
As a last thought, I don't play iron man. I thought it was kind of pointless when it first came out specifically for the reasons you mentioned. To be fair, I slowly did start to see it's appeal later on, even though i still wouldn't personally put myself through the ordeal of grinding out a high level ironman. All that said however, I believe group ironman is going to be their best iteration of the ironman mode.

Isnt that just the perk that triples loot doing its job? I assume it just makes the items you do get appear in 3x the quantity instead of tripling the amount of rolls you do get

---
tl;dr your post reads like: Jagex knows people don't lie on the Internet so they always ask the user if they're allowed to be on their game.
---
Who cares if she does. Complimenting some work in this game isn't white knighting my dude. I've done the same for and against male artists too.

---
hope she sees this bro
---
Odd comparison. Some people aren't #1 in a skill in a hiscore. That doesn't stop them playing the game. However it also doesn't mean they cant obtain a unique cosmetic item with an emote attached to it.
---
So why exactly the reach?
---
So you aren't a completionist and you don't care to have an item, thus everyone else shouldn't care. And its led you to go onto my post and downvote it and comment against it because its also problematic.
---
HWIDs are useless in a security sense lol.

Oh no, I'm not agreeing that all gamers are women haters. Not by any stretch of the imagination.
---
I'm just responding to his comment cause it's perfectly fine to hate how the elves look, but some people really did go above and beyond in a sad, pathetic sort of way.
---
So many people resorting to this argument because they don't have a point. I'm playing it. I'm in dragon leagues. That doesn't mean i can't disagree with discontinued items being added. I'm not on the side of having a 1% flex item in main game from a non-main game mode. Whys that hard to believe for you? Not everyone feels the need to be made special or recognised above others in a game. Why do you?
---
shh no tears, only dreams now
---
618
---
no
---
Okay so i really don't like your view of the game and don't ever want that to be how this game goes. You might enjoy RS3, its got far more designs in that philosophy.
---
Also why is it different? Top 1% to finish the 99 in a skill should get a unique cosmetic. You didn't get there in first 1%? Well you don't **deserve it**. Tough luck, shoulda played early and more competitively. Don't be a baby about it. Its only a game. Any other weak excuse you are using to defend trophies.
---
aggro the small spiders at the sulphur pit and the clouds can't damage you; they count as an npc and it's single way combat so they can't "attack" you while the spider is there

not sure what to say, it's a spanish guy, mostly they're dumb. I once picked up 2k cosmics in edge bank because a vnz guy tried drop trading to another account. needles to say he was angry and threatened to report me for picking up his runes and called me all kinds of names in spanish.
---
I eventually tried trading them back to him since he was a poor vnz working for his food but he refused to trade and insisted I give them back by drop trading. I didn't. he then proceeded to insult me every time we met when making cosmics and I just "huehued" or ignored.

Nah he didn't trade me, I know he was lying because of the runelite KC and loot tracker and me seeing all of the drops on the floor with the bones etc, it just made no sense in my head what his goal was when he was getting no drops and just wasting his time.

---
Maybe if they reduced the amount of shit areas where the hotspots can spawn it would help. In other words only make them spawn at graves, lava tele, lever and maybe even west drags. In other words only places you can tele to or get there fast. Also a hotspot tele would be good, but make it expensive so bots won't use it. Or just delete them, make regular kills against your target worth more and bounties worth morth and make the bounties less shit or just remove bounties too and make regular kills and streaks worth more. Cause right now streaks ain't worth shit unless you are in a hotspot.
---
Or it is the PvPers who are blind. They want BH to be more rewarding, even though any systems like this will be abused hard. The only way to rejuvenate PvP is to make it more accessible, and i don't think updating the wilderness or BH are the answer.

Legendary edit skills, I bet you have 99 Editing.

But I can have it, and will. So what's your actual point?
---
Because they just draw their model from the pet rock lol
---
Fine idea and all but they just need to rebalance mage and add actual mid level magic gear. Right now in pvp you have a choice between a 100k lvl 20 def 40 magic set or a 4m 70 def 70 magic set and nothing in between, and the 4m set is degradable but also has defence bonuses. There is literally no reason for maxed accounts to be running around in pvp with a 40 magic 20 def set of gear, same with ranged but at least black dhide is nearly double the level requirements of mystic, and its equivalent 70 defence gear is only around 2m and has much better magic defence but the same melee stats, in other words dhide needs to be nerfed and we need a magic set similar to it.
---
Luckily since Jagex is at the wheel we are sure to get new magic sets, too bad they will just be more mystic variants, currently there are 6 mystic variants. All the armor between mystic and ahrim's is rare or very time consuming items to get (infinity, 3rd age, dagon'hai). Realistically lunar armor should fill that slot at 65 magic 40 defence but its stats are shit, legit worse magic bonus than xericians and it has -10 range bonus as well (which is 2 worse than ancestral btw).

That‚Äôs not how RNG works.

Train magic to 55 and range to 65 or near that. Finish Dragon Slayer. Get crafting high enough to cut diamonds.

Then go to Corsair Cove, head north west from the bum pirates, talk to the middle eastern guy and tell him you killed dragons and shit. He'll be so impressed he lets you into his secret part of the coast. Go in the cave to get to a dungeon and head to the north room inside. Safe spot ogresses in the bonus dungeon and collect their rune drops, chisel any gems better than Sapphire, and cast high alchemy on any armor drops or cut gems.

You can stay there as long as you still have some kind of ammo, and they also drop more arrows.

It's fucking boring, but the only better way to make bond money in f2p quick is trying to telegrab zamorak wine faster than the boys, and I feel like that's even worse.

You'll probably get to 70 something range level while you're there and some magic levels too.
---
It took me maybe a week doing that a couple hours a day while doing something more engaging to make 5m for my first bond. It is much easier to make that kind of money if you know what you're doing in P2P so look for a money making guide on the wiki that you think you can make money with quickly enough. Now you've unlocked $11ü¶Ä in your real life wallet every month and can spend it on hookers and blow.

Before you commit to any of this kind of shit though, explore whatever you want to see in f2p and enjoy the game.

There are 3 kings. I thought people killed 1 and not the 3 of them at the same time. My b.

You're just asking for convenience for no good reason. "Make this change so the game is easier for me".

No. I only play UIM and I hate changes like this.

it looks like straight outta rs3

There is a whole community on YT that wants to kill baby monkeys...

Be good if they dedicated that time to fixing alot of the games issues and builder better customer support ..

Did you see his name? Maybe life is a challenge for him in more ways than we know. 
---
To the other guy, remember I'm rooting for you. Life IS a challenge, but part of it is overcoming out shortcomings. Hope you find your way!
---
A pker can get you during the switch but it is smart to try and stay in combat like that
---
Jalape√±os are awesome on anything
---
I'd tap that
---
Gratz hopefully you get some reddit karma
---
Depends on your gear setup. I don‚Äôt have maxed melee so I don‚Äôt need it.
---
22 hp food fam
---
Doubt.
---
But if you truly have been false banned Google 'Runescape Ban Appeal' and appeal through that. You can appeal macro major bans.
---
More hp
---
I smell salt
---
Why is there no pvp ladder yet???
---
Thanks for the insight man
---
You know what game has unobtainable items?  Runescape 3.  Its literally 1 step from having unobtainable items to items only obtainable via microtransactions.
---
You also arent considering the larger picture here, if i want to collect everything in game i literally can't now because i have to choose to play leagues OR the main game, and in leagues i have limited time to do things, some of those things that can take weeks to do in normal gameplay.  I work 2 jobs and havnt even played in days other then hopping on to do a 2 minute farming contract.
---
So of course people are upset over this, they will never have something in game, a thing that was promised to never happen.
---
Updoot for jmod smackdown
---
Can he teleblock me while im targeting a monster?
---
Long story as short as possible:
---
He was standing outside the door when I went in for my first set of kills, and also when I returned from my second set.
---
During the first set, he watched me and then just continued to stand there until I returned. I didn‚Äôt know why he was still standing there so I asked something like ‚Äúme going again?‚Äù We previously discussed which prayers we were using based on our gear and, from experience with the boss with both prayers, I knew how much riskier praying melee is vs. praying mage (since Kril‚Äôs spec attack is very accurate and is his max hit, not to mention it causes prayer point issues). All around, have felt much more comfortable and calculated using the pray mage method.
---
He seemed intrigued that I was playing UIM so I figured he was waiting outside the door because he enjoyed watching me kill the boss. To my surprise, however, after asking ‚Äúme going again?‚Äù or whatever I said, he simply said ‚Äúcheck it‚Äù and began putting up. I guess because he saw my previous trip he wanted to prove that his Karil‚Äôs and pray melee setup prompted a similar bossing experience. 
---
And he planked, after getting chanced more than once XD
---
Could be one of those ‚Äúhad to be there‚Äù moments, but I figured you guys would sort of out the pieces together based on the limited context provided within the chat box and the screenshot :p
---
Such wow
---
Ever since that osrs mobile bot vid released false flags over undetectable behavior have happening. If you were playing mega effecient and doing something like fruit stalls thieving and dropping, might be why.
---
What weird time portal did you go through where last night was December fifteenth?
---
Noobs these days never learn!! üòÇüí™
---
WT is super simple - make sure you're wearing 4 pieces of warm clothing like deleteseverything said, bring in a tinderbox, hammer and knife and a few pieces of food based on your hp level. Wines and cakes are popular because they're cheap, and you'll figure out how much you want to bring in with you at a time (there's a bank right outside).
---
A games necklace teleports you straight there, and you can probably minigame teleport too.
---
Go in, light the brazier, then chop logs. The goal is to get at least 500 points. Fletched logs are worth more points, logs are worth more xp. I usually do a fletched inv of logs, and a regular inv of logs. 
---
Hope you enjoy it! Why fletch.
---
Are you implying that he posted it was fixed then deleted that tweet then posted that he didn't get it fixed? You think people would really do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies?
---
This video shows just how bad at developing games they are lol https://youtu.be/CdtMxyX_6UA

The finest specimen Earth has to offer.
---
It‚Äôs so good I‚Äôve actually forced myself to only watch one episode a day to prolong the enjoyment and also feel better about myself.
---
Yo that shit looks good though...
---
Not talking about the pizza btw
---
If you're in single combat no. He can still potentially do it in the moment you kill a monster though.
---
Doubt (X)
---
Easiest ways are to use an occult altar your player owned house (83ish construction I think.)
---
Or you can go to rimmington on world 330 and use somebody else's house's occult altar.
---
Or if you get 99 magic the cape allows you to swap spellbooks anywhere 3 times a day
---
Lmao. For science right? I'm sure you don't want to bot uh huh
---
Nice
---
There are only three pieces of warm clothing available in TL outside of WT drops: clue hunter top, fire staff, and lit bug lantern (33 Slayer req). If you took Endurance and are less than 20 hp, you don't need any warm clothing at all.
---
Hell yeah dude what a girlfriend
---
Lmao at you thinking people posting here slows down jagex.
---
These pop up almost every day and i can't remember when was the last smackdown. Meaning that all of them are actual false bans that jagex handles quietly... wtf is wrong with cheat detection?
---
138kc :)
---
Download the Runelite client its so much better than the regular osrs client
---
lmao
---
If you don't have a Twitter account without a picture of your character wearing a max cape then who the hell cares.
---
That trim is a myth
---
so like when i earn enough points I can redeem for bonds?
---
fuck you, gz. fuck yourself. nice job
---
Open up your good ole app store and type in auto tapper or macro recorder. And with a surprisingly small amount of effort you can automate all kinds of stuff.
---
But.. the loot tracker from runelite says he only got u 470k (65k coins). Explain this please?
---
Amazing stuff man, loved the whole thing

Watched the entire first season yesterday. It‚Äôs fucking incredible I gotta say. I was pretty skeptical at first but it seems a lot people agree since it‚Äôs sitting at a 9.1 rn on IMDB.

---
But that's still not what he's asking, he's asking if there's something that **isn't** just a macro recorder / autoclicker.
---
The guy is such an alpha
---
I know those exist... but those aren‚Äôt bots.

literally just after typing this i went in the dungeon and forgot i need an axe, FML.

Oh we were best buds!.....no you're right  :(

Never said it was 100% correct. But the one to decide is Jagex.

I‚Äôm a somewhat mid-level player who isn‚Äôt that into the pvp scene, and the pvp environment has scared me off ever getting into pvp at all. The only people I found to fight were pures, who I had absolutely no chance against. It doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to get into pvp just to face people who intentionally keep their combat levels low to have an unfair advantage over regular players. It feels to me like pvpers killed pvp.
---
I don't have maxed melee either, but Fighter torso + ferocious gives such a large reduction that I do need to bring it :p
---
Just did it today. Jump in to the wildly at edge with a dds and a 75k totem you buy from the bounty hunter shop. Wait for your target, most likely they will chat with you first. If they try to kill you just skip. When someone runs over, offer to buy the kill for 75k to 125k. Let them bank their gear and run back. Find out where the hotspot is and what the bonus reward is. Might be knights fortress with no necklace equipped. Run out there and kill the dude. You will get 35-45 points. Return to bank, pay the person the agreed price and buy your self 3 rune pouches. It's an absolute joke. If you spend 750 slayer points you're wrong.
---
Never forget the unicorn from Underground Pass. Still gives me nightmares.
---
Logically if someone logs off from a location and then logs in elsewhere after a reasonable amount of time compared to the distance traveled with the same HWID, it should be reasonable to assume they are merely traveling.
---
But do you really trust Jagex's detection systems? You'd be risking quite a bit for one week of travel.
---
Nope
---
Take my award my god I laughed so hard
---
jeez, one year already. How time flies
---
Yep it's amazing although, I will say it's based VERY much on the books... So if you have played the games it won't exactly meet your expectations ( not in a bad way however ).
---
What switches do you have? Been using my K70 Red since 2013 and I have never thought about that.
---
Get a block to raise your pc up. Let it vent properly
---
&gt;admitting they are all getting banned would be bad for business. "Eyy 0% ban rate ! Buy my script!"

having your customers also get banned is bad for business lol
---
bad post
---
aNFL QB, Colin Kappernick was taking a knee during the start of the game which is when we do the pledge to our flag. He wanted to protest about the shootings of black kids from police officers and a lot of inequalities they have in the US
---
Well a lot of people didn‚Äôt like that because ‚Äúmuh respect‚Äù and pretty much drove him out of the league
---
Became more, after with many athletes protesting the same way but have not been in the news for a few years
---
Username checks out!
---
I get there difference you're trying to make, but a bot isn't solely what you're trying to describe it as. Macros, auto clickers, and scripts are all programs. They all compute and interact with computer systems and all interact as if they were the player. They are all bots. You're referring specifically to bot *scripts* which is the ones that have a semblance of decision making unlike macros or auto clickers.

This is the wiki page that scamexaminer is talking about. Doing the quests in the order that is listed helps alot to progress your account naturally and skips all of the slow early level grinds
---
My stats are 93 attack/ 99 strength/ 90 defense. 
---
Should I get 95 attack and then 95 defense or go straight to 99 attack before training defense?
---
I like to PVM
---
No shit he said that and started over, he's not just going to be like oh guys I got banned for botting btw, he's going to lie about it so your image of him isn't changed. 
---
Also runelite does literally nothing that makes it "look like a bot was playing".
---
How is not having a twitter an argument lol
---
Inb4 some faulty logic
---
You obviously weren‚Äôt serious and didn‚Äôt make a real attempt to get into it.   Yeah if you don‚Äôt plan your stats at all and you‚Äôre bad it‚Äôs gonna be a bad time.
---
Its sad that we live in a "everyone gets a participation trophy" society and now its even rolling overs onto our fucking video game communities? Seriously people. ITS A GAME. You are not entitled to every fucking reward that you didnt participate/earn it. I mean this is getting ridiculous. 
---
Why would people NOT want something unique? To me that would be the incentive for actually playing TL. If you could get them whenever, then what would be the point? Sigh.
---
Fuck me he's done so much in a year I feel like a sack of shit.

2k world the dream.

Wait, I was always told high mage defense while praying melee was the way to go, is this not the case?

I heard that DreamWorks got their inspiration for Shrek from this wonderful man.
---
How do I trade at the great exchange?
---
Because he was botting. You don't get banned for no reason 99.999999% of the time. Why is this sub always so gullible lol
---
Might actually be a decent sweater design tbh
---
That's a real currency
---
You might wanna turn the brightness down üòÑ
---
His point is that when you don't know anything about pking you probably won't use 100 hours to make account for only testing if you like pking.
---
Pures and min max build have caused that many players don't want to even try pking, I was one of those players for few years, no when I'm almost max combat I can find fair fights level wise, learning curve is still huge but atleast I don't have to fight people who has 20 more range, mage, str levels.
---
There‚Äôs no better time to start than now my man
---
Well to be fair, the person asking could clearly see these were magic trees, so why ask if OP was chopping magics. And why even ask in the first place, if OP wants to chop magics then let him, as you said: It's only a game so let people do what they want and don't question it
---
&gt;a sack of shit
---
Lmao
---
So he forgot to change the date when he reposted lmao
---
Thanks for the info! While age-wise my account is relatively new, I have been playing a lot since starting in June and it is not a low level (31m overall xp). I just don't want to waste what's left of this bond!
---
No its not.
---
People are getting unbanned. Not because they didnt bot, they did, just because JageX wants to see them back on the game.
---
That's it üòòüòéüòç
---
I could‚Äôve done better in a cave with a box of scraps
---
Sorry, things seem fine on my end.

Try getting 5k upvotes first.
---
You don't know that. You can't accuse someone without facts. That is a whole problem that people just randomly getting banned. It is not the first time when that kind of false bans happen. Imagine yourself in this situation.
---
That would be goals honestly! :P
---
haha apple bad give me karma
---
nice, gratz!
---
My dude I don't give a noodly damn about karma. Apple is bad, those are facts

Bro bonds arent a significant amount of cash to certain players
---
There‚Äôs some good in this world Mr Frodo. And its worth fighting for.
---
The problem is you need a dedicated account JUST to pk.  Most players have 1 account, their main account, and cant pk with 62/67/51 or whatever random assortment of stats most normal accounts have. Also, telling people to 'get gud' doesn't exactly encourage new pkers now does it? If you didnt make your account with the intention to pk on it from the beginning, chances are it's a shit pking account

I feel like video games are one of the few hobbies where people judge you for only playing one thing. My dad was into model trains, and for a long time that was his *only* hobby outside of family and work, but no one questioned his mental health for working on the same model table for two decades. OSRS isn't too different, since it's a goal-oriented game based around long term commitment and investment, just like working on a large model as your hobby. If Settled has found his jam in playing OSRS and editing videos, and as long as he's not neglecting the other aspects of his life (which doesn't seem to be an issue), more power to him.

No but trading extremely large amounts may flag you for RWT. You may get temp banned but it'll be quashed once manually reviewed

Yes, you don‚Äôt need bis gear but it will help though, it just takes practice
---
okay rendi

Thank you :)

I second this. Even if it's a sheet of plywood or a flattened cardboard box, it's better than having it directly on carpet.
---
I hate these kinds of problems and have been affected by them in the past, I can't totally give you a solution that wouldn't involve just finding the email or trying to get support but I will suggest the solution I use to mitigate these kinds of things before they happen. Note that this does not require your phone, which has disadvantages, so you have to weigh if it works well for you. There are programs that can perform the same as a mobile authenticator but on your computer, such as WinAuth, that allow you to make copies/backups of your auth file. This file can be protected by a password, which may not be as strong as keeping your physical phone but it's a tradeoff. You don't want someone else to get their hands on the file. Brute force would be really easy as it's local. But in the end, you're not relying on your phone deciding to end its life overnight and can have as many backups as you want in whatever form you'd like (Ideally on multiple drives/locations). Hope this can perhaps help in the future. Good luck with getting your account back anyway.

I haven't played OSRS since around 2012. Decided to come back recently. I'm interested in making an f2p pure for fun since I had a lot of fun with one back in the day. Are there corrupt dragon weapons in the game still? Can f2p players collect emblems or only p2p? What is the state of f2p pking and is it profitable for pures?
---
*72 but yes
---
Mind telling me the names of the used armor?
---
So fucking true. I just spent a few hours BHing on 550ms for looting bags on my 4 pk accounts. I am having to endure this shit every week now.

it was 300 when I tested it a while ago, but you can put it into a table in excel or similar and random sort it to make it work

‚ÄúGot Bulks‚Äù cc is a cc that helps avoid buy limits if that‚Äôs your thing. And I‚Äôve definitely helped folks who were at buy limits for runes trying to work on their POH Nexus, so yeah I get you sometimes you just need your stuff!
---
When men cried
---
Ooh I got an idea why not make a minigame where you fight other players risk free? That way you can test pvp for free on your account. Oh wait we have that it's called castle wars. Or if you don't like that then try clan wars. And if you want to test a new account build instead of your own, tournament worlds happen every couple months or so and last anywhere from a few days to sometimes a month. The bhv2 beta was literally open for almost a month and you could test any build and gear. Also lms is dead for many reasons but it was the closest to an actual pvp minigame, although with the most difficult kind of pking - nhing.
---
Also who is risking 2m or losing 30m before they get a decent pk? Mostly it's low levels trying to learn to pk, failing and quitting pvp forever. Most people don't start at max combat, and most people I see on bad accounts or in rune gear or anything don't even skull or they 1 item in lumbridge for fun so they don't lose that much.
---
&gt;youtube.com/wunfinator
---
You do realize you're part of the reason why Bh is dead too right? You teleblock, protect melee and sit on 115 hp against edgeville pkers. When someone good actually fights back this is what happens though

That's pretty sweet

Haha nooo. To me, high level combat stats start around 90.
---
Nothing comes from it, so who's fault is that?
---
I don‚Äôt wanna say it but 10m isn‚Äôt a lot, unless you‚Äôre an ironman? Also make sure you aren‚Äôt ratted.
---
Yaaas grats!! I did acb too and it took me almost exactly 80 attempts too. Good job dude celebrate:D
---
50$ is a lot tbh. After a few stakes it‚Äôs gone.
---
probably 20m including all my gear he purposely took out of my bank. Ive spent literal days playing this game and i just had all my work ripped out from under me
---
Fuuuuuuuuu
---
Pretty much. So do *most* pets. Even pet rock has a rainbow party hat on. Cannonballs have snow on them. Falling rocks in mlm have party hats. Kbd and kbd pet have a Santa hat green party hat and purple party hat on its 3 heads. Bunch o stuff like that.

10m was a lot for me, but i get what you are saying. what is ratted
---
Wow. I've been following you from the beginning and honestly whenever I see you reach these milestones it makes me feel proud as a fan.
---
Keep up the great work :)
---
This made me ‚ÄúHe‚Äù out loud
---
To add on to what this guy said, if someone asks you to follow them out from the GE, they're about to try to scam you. If someone tries to get you to "antilure" with them, they're luring you with another person in on it.

Try searching for a Zulrah guide without memorization. It helped me a lot in getting my first kill

My friend got a solo tbow the other day. He doesn‚Äôt even raid much. I‚Äôve never tried raids though because I‚Äôm a closed minded pker.
---
I would assume a semi Ironman is you just don‚Äôt allow yourself to use GE or trade other than the small items that are super annoying to get. 
---
I thought about doing this. Liquidating my bank on main and then start over with a clean bank with Ironman rules. Started an actual Ironman instead. Right call.

I did min/max a pure. 50atk 60 str 70 range all done in the 2 week twitch prime promo. Cannoned my range to keep hp a bit lower, only got 26 prayer for lower combat etc.
---
My issue now is, I either have to put my ‚Äúmain‚Äù (it‚Äôs not maxxed combat only 108 working on 95 slayer, 92 atm) progress on hold as an afk gold farming account at brutal black dragons to earn 12m every 2 weeks for 2 bonds. The range xp from killing them wouldn‚Äôt even be useful because I‚Äôm already 99. So the account would just be gaining gp.
---
If I could use one membership for both accounts I would use my pure to pk every once in a while and actually get some practice pking instead of dying constantly.
---
The pizza in the Uk looks awful
---
I would do everything available in f2p first. I.e all f2p quests, get full rune, etc. Then, if you‚Äôre still interested in playing, then sub. 
---
Rs3 is filled with micro transactions, different combat system, and less of a grind. It‚Äôs also more pvm based , since pking is dead because of the combat system. 
---
Also more people play osrs
---
Ah, so you made a new account to play and began last year. Reasonable thought.
---
I heard the same guy like him gunna love prison if it ever got that far üòÇ
---
Looks like work to me
---
If only it were that simple. I got people in my clan getting gold buying sites to block their cards.... then the next day they be askin people for a new site hahaha. Funny and sad :')
---
Buying gold in general is sad, devalues the game.
---
Mate just one look at his head and you know how fucked he would be in prison haha.
---
This guy has made more progress in a year than I have in 5. Oof
---
after they're combined, i can right click on them in the inventory to separate them again?
---
All this is tempting me to appeal my original accounts perm bot ban. I got banned perm on strike 3 in osrs sometime in March or April 2013 on my 2007 account.
---
Getting fighter torso together.

"Pizza Man" deleted what Support was replying to with the "Glad to hear about this" so he could fake this shit and stir up controversy.  [https://i.imgur.com/TXB14VF.png](https://i.imgur.com/TXB14VF.png)
---
Haha that's be too crazy
---
I mean like if you wana skip someone you just grab a tier 4 out of the bank, skip them, put it back and risk a tier 1
---
I think playing games has much more health consequences compared to other "real life" hobbies. Ofc some hc sports gonna fuck you up even more but most hobbies wont leave you with back pain, worse eye sight etc. You have to actively counter that and dunno how many of "progamers" are that strict with their health coz xp waste
---
sadly nothing the game is very solo-oriented until you reach endgame such as raids which you could duo both cox and tob, or do gwd together, corp, etc. you can probably do wintertodt on the same world or something lol but that's a skilling activity
---
Those wanna be recaro gaming chairs are really uncomfortable. 
---
The best chair I've had has been a leather office chair..

Ok but be honest, did you buy the account?

Lmaoo
---
I saw a graph someone made a few weeks back and over time they were almost identical if I recall right
---
I agree the hot/cold is terrible. Runelite makes it bareable though.
---
Those are fair points, but if you tell someone "yeah I play video games", and you have a large library of games, no one really looks twice. But if you say you only play X, Y, or Z game, people give you a weird look. That's what I was referring to, not necessarily how video games are looked at as a whole.
---

---
do not try it solo lmao. learn in trios or four mans first, then you can downgrade to duos, then you can maybe start trying solos after around 300+ kc. keep in mind most people are still super shit even at around 300+ kc, don't know efficient ways to clear the rooms, don't know how to mage or melee skip at olm, can't run acid or dps through falling crystals without losing any ticks/not taking damage, etc. solo olm is extremely unforgiving because you have to be tick-perfect every single time, or else you ruin the cycle and fuck it all up. mage hand running will take you a while to get the timing but the thing you'll struggle with the most is setting up a 4:1, after you learn 3:1 method. that's the learning curve mostly. if you don't know anything about cox you will literally get demolished in a solo. it will just be very demotivating
---
I‚Äôm also only F2P. The game is what you make of it, and it seems we‚Äôre both having fun without a ton of pressure.
---
15+ years ago, it was entirely possible. Not anymore.
---
Im pretty sure ive never seen nate attack a portal. Just a brawlers to get participation.
---
WEED
---
I actually got that chair in grey and its straight up the most comfortable computer chair I've ever owned. I can't attest to its magical +7 gaming skill though since I play single player games and rarely at that.

Thank you, appreciated!

Rs3 was OG rs until they fucked it up
---
damn that's a bright screen
---
This accurately represents the bad ass feeling of being a pure.
---
This is terrifying and I want it badly.
---
i mean the easiest solution would just to be to add a reclaim to whoever you get max cape from- jagex isnt incapable of solving issues like this lol
---
They look great!
---
Yeah, you gotta mix in some meh pizza every once in awhile to fully appreciate the pizza we have in Chicago.
---
It's a grill
---
Should be able to adopt the dog... that would make a fun quest.
---
how does that even happen lol
---
Yes I did log into desktop versi√≥n, and it still shows up as active  ongoing membership but The acc says im a f2p player. So idk whats going on... Ive been dealing with this all day now...

Because I dont want the subs mods to screech at me for accusing people who are obvious bots

To be fair the tomb that leads to the catacombs changes every time
---
There should be a quest that explained that dog's past and maybe allow you to do that :P
---
whole track hitting my heart like a hammer
---
Eh, if its any consolation burning the logs is slightly more xp/hour I believe
---
Nobody played castle wars in rs2 either (at least in the last 4 or so years before eoc). Everyone just loafed for trimmed comp cape. But team-based things that were worth doing were implemented often. Not to mention that jagex nurtured its clan scene throughout, while osrs has done nothing but inadvertently destroy it. It's not that the playerbase changed, in fact pre-eoc was also extremely competitive for xp rates. But being in a clan and having social events was worth doing
---
Also last time i went to clan wars was like 4 years ago for CWA with my old multiclan lol
---
This is fantastic, I'll work on getting this put up. How did you end up figuring this all out?
---
I'll reference the comment I am responding to for source on the wiki
---
-I just spent 3000 dollars on a gaming computer.
---
-Oh really? What're you gonna use it for?
---
-Oldschool RuneScape...

Upvote for rocket league, finally hit gc last season sorry to flex üí™

he looks like his wife's boyfriend is about to get mad at him

or just let us clean him

Good idea. This type of thing usually gets more attention in the Q&amp;A threads when those come around, though, this probably won't get seen in its own thread.
---
There should be a chance to be dealt an orange disease hitsplat for petting the dog if it stays. it's a flea ridden stray dog after all, you wouldn't pet one in real life. no risk, no reward.
---
Reddit likes to think everyone is as self righteous as they are. "He had a following until..." As if he still doesn't have a big following. Most people dont give a single shit.
---
It‚Äôs possible and definitely doable. But can‚Äôt be reliant on a scim/whip. Your ko potential comes from your spec wep - claws or ags are really your only two options. G maul as well but that takes more skill.
---
This sounds great. Thanks for doing this.

Wait, there are dagon'hai hats ingame now?

It's cute, like you :P
---
Listen man I‚Äôm not here to waste anyone‚Äôs time, I just wanna play again
---
E: no I did not
---
Ayyy lemme know in game who you are :)
---
Do you use runelite or the normal client?
---
Try either. If you have both installed and both give the same error try reinstalling your preffered client.
---
I filled out every field and it still auto denies
---
For real man. I would guess most of us multitask and afk, or have music playing while we play so we dont really play osrs music or sounds while playing anymore.
---
Wow that is some real garbage tier house decor
---
I don‚Äôt understand
---
Vintage!
---
You can go on the wiki and arrange quests by difficulty and see what you can achieve
---
Laran's chest drop. 1/256 I think.
---
vinery in hosidius is the worst
---
Really? Dang. Do you have an idea of how many points you might get?
---
Can we get merch please?
---
woox hatchling
---
Coach me I‚Äôm gold 1
---
Damn dude that crazy
---
your'e not bad, f2p is hard/a grind. its the original "pay to win" but a bit better than modern games. come members, somehow, then earn enough each 14 days to buy a bond to continue it, you'll probs have more fun and you can get yelled at by pkers trying to steal your spaid saying "sit fggt" and you'll feel like someone in torvestas videos
---
About what exactly lmao.
---
I wonder if there's janitor bots around that do this.
---
Lol
---
Dude honestly I would run with u if u wanted to level up, all my friends are in gold and plat so I never really get frustrated playing lower ranks, I have fun leveling ppl up lol
---
Thanks dude and it‚Äôs some sort of rare spine from a fossil nothing special tbh
---
&gt; Why do these kids need more money? 
---
Jagex wants to lower the barrier of entry to pking so people are more likely to make alt accounts = more money for Jagex. That is why they have been pushing pking so much recently and also why they sunk so much resources into trying to promote pking in RS3 even though EoC drove away most of the pkers there.
---
&gt; Pking not profitable enough? To bad? Risk more? 
---
Then noobs will lose even more gp when they die and go bankrupt faster. Jagex wants to subsidize pking for noobs so they don't quit right away.
---
According to your post history it was 10 months ago. Nice achievement nonetheless üëç
---
Not really. 
---
Working a job and playing a pretty afk computer game are very different. 
---
Working for 12-14+ hours every day non-stop would cause significant health and physical problems. 
---
Also depends on the time-frame of how long they've been playing.
---
Maybe don't call random people pathetic for jokes on the internet
---
Nerd
---
Just try to switch it bro, you won‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs too late unless you check
---
*hey bro what are you do...."
---
*HISSSSSSSS*
---
Unfortunately not.
---
Yeah osrs is is basically solo-scape. Only ToB is done predominately in teams
---
I mean here we are three mental jungle gyms away from the original topic, but sure go ahead and use this as validation.
---
Probably botted. GG
---
There‚Äôs some link where you can actually just delete your account but what‚Äôs wrong with starting a new email?
---
Must be going for the 24 hour smithing EHP record
---
It‚Äôs coming, don‚Äôt worry.
---
I want 10m
---
Yah uh Ill have white rice, no beans, yah gimme dat chicken
---
I had a blast actually, i really like the inferno
---
So buying bonds to get GP is frowned upon? Not defending this guy or anything but some people earn things in different ways.
---
What if he has a main
---
I wanted actually footage, not actual footagw
---
I agree osrs is a botters heaven but most low level suicide bots don‚Äôt make 1m+ an hour in raw gp and supplies. A Yew bot is making like 80k gp an hour but anyone that can bot 300 total level and afk for 48 hours can start making bank in bh.

I got 99 Ranged through Slayer with this in mind, I didn't wanna just get it from using chins after MM1/2, took ages but when I got it I felt like I really achieved something.
---
I try to do this for all the skills I enjoy and the ones I don't I'll play minigames or more 'fun' methods.
---
Ah I didn‚Äôt know that, thanks for the heads up.
---
Switch your email, change all passwords associated with your account, run some anti virus software on your computer, clear all cookies and cache from web browsers, and pray.  
---
This happened to me years and years ago, unfortunately my account was stolen, botted on and by the time I recovered it , it was perm banned for macroing.  
---
Best of luck man, be careful next time.
---
Pfff not me.
---
Drop --&gt; Soap
---
Every Swampletics episode is like hitting the k-hole.
---
Maybe a mini quest could let us clean him up? Would be pretty fun. Maybe I‚Äôve been starving for story stuff since finishing the quests though. üòÇ
---
Probably has a main and a new account. 52 prayer with high mage low def makes sense. Stop hating
---
510 √ó 0.18 = 91.8 the math checks out
