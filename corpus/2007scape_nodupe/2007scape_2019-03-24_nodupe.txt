About 7 years ago when I was on Hiatus from Runescape, my account was hacked without my knowledge. I used my recovery questions to get it back. The guy was a youtuber that used my account. I don't account share, I wasn't doxxed, and I don't use teamspeak.

It's just exponential growth

Smelt opal necklaces and make them into dodgy necks. Not sure which part profits more but its like 1m/hour

Dragon Slayer really expanded on RS's lore though. The Duke would tell you a bit about Crandor's history.
---
I think I get what you’re saying, when I die I keep my slay helm, berserker, fury, and whip, Lose guthans chest/legs, and barrows gloves (gear wise). What do you mean about not needing to return tho

I really dislike the idea of having to reach over the screen to click those.   At least the current buttons are out of the way.

That history still wouldn't explain how my auth, pin, and password were breached now.

Rank 2 in the whole game uses medium clues from eclectic imps as a money maker. Not sure I can agree with you here

Thanks! I’m not caught up on the UIM component of it, although it’s even more impressive. I’ll check them out!

What even is this code not even kidding

Keep that shit off of social media.   I mean both of those.

90 cons so I can boost for fairy ring/tree and have the maxed nexus :)

This shouldn't actually be a good thing, but trust me, the kid could have much, much worse situation.

Grats!

Dharok body and torag chest. I also got karils cbow at 5k and an elite clue at 19kc. First kill doesn’t count and I didn’t know what was happening and only killed the brother in the crypt. Pleased with how barrows has gone so far :)

I don't know about random.dat but jagex_cl_oldschool_live.dat just points to the gamefiles. I don't know the reason why it's there but I guess everytime you load a client they are generated anyways, so just leave them be

How has your life changed please go on, do you hit the gym? Have a wife? Or just go out with friends more?

Yes it's really unfortunate. As others have mentioned in this thread, turning private to friends is the only real solution.

It made the community a little more closed off. You can no longer just PM someone from a CC or who said something earlier without asking them to specifically add you first.

I'll do it for 900k

I would not consider date of  account creation, CC info, or DOB "limited information"

It's plausible.

It wouldn't hurt to just create a script that deletes them every hour?

That's not true. Most women who abort don't suffer any ill affects mentally or physically. It's not a traumatic procedure, and even if it does leave some baggage it's nothing compared to spending decades raising a child you never wanted. Irresponsible idiots shouldn't be bringing children in to this world period. It's already enough of a shit show.

condoms are advertised at 98% effective and birth control is 99%

The Jagex client actually writes these, not us. All of our files write to ~/.runelite
---
Not bad but in terms of the whole "maxing an uim" thing UIM Link definitely made better vids of the two IMO. His series where he was doing more unique stuff on his UIM like clues, collecting items, etc are somewhat interesting but hindered by lack of experience. The whole swampletics thing is leagues better than anything he was doing before I think, he was sort of doing his own take on things that had already been done better by people already before it.
---
In math classes, yes. In real maths (maths papers, conferences etc) it is generally log_e if there's no further qualification. I thought the same as you until I finished undergrad and started reading papers. 
---
Yeah, but, whats the point. Only thing that would accomplish, is that your client loads slower
---
Medium clues
---
go to a bounty hunter world and outside of the edgeville bank there'll be people advertising their clan chats that sell mysterious emblems.  
---
the way it works is when you kill someone who has a mysterious emblem, you get the level below the one they dropped. a rune pouch costs 1.2M bounty hunter points which is the same amount a tier 6 emblem gives. so people "trade" you a tier 6 by letting you kill them while they have a tier 7 and it'll usually cost you about 1 mil GP, which is cheaper than buying 24 tier 1 mysterious emblems off the GE (because only tier 1s are tradable) to get the same amount of points.
---
But Swampletics goes there! 
---
If he had gotten some nature runs he would've been able to alch himself!

Damn

Ya love it

Hunter is one of the only interesting skills, cmv

Nice twist of words. He said his channel is dying.

Did he say he was unsuccessful? No. But it’s funny how you have to literally make that up because you can’t logically refute it

Hey bro, the meta is ironically an event rpg till 30str on whatever has 1 def/offense stats. So crabs seagulls or whatever you prefer. Then you go to blast furnace world 19 for an afk 12kstr xp an hour as it's a bit faster than hand training then back to afking. 1-60 Is around 20 hours I think. Not bad if you're levelling a couple accs at once. Plus once it's quested and 55 slayer the builds done basically.

Near as I can tell from the provided citations, the only precedent for "rape by deception" in regards to an agreement of contraception is within English law; *R – v – Assange, where the court concluded that if consent was conditional on the use of the condom during intercourse, and the condition was deliberately disregarded, that was capable of amounting to rape.*
---
Contraceptive usage, or the lack thereof, being grounds for "rape" as defined by the law remains a legal gray area in much of the world, with most cases of "rape by deception" being in regards to the falsification of identity. It's also worth noting that, within the Sexual Offences Act of 2003 (English law), only the usage of condoms, or the lack thereof, is defined, leaving many other form of birth control a legal gray area.
---
In regards to the US, at least, it seems that this sort of thing would be more likely defined as domestic abuse rather than sexual assault, as an issue of [reproductive coercion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_coercion).
---
So... It's actually a pretty complicated issue, and most certainly not immediately definable as rape, at least in terms of the law, in many parts of the world. Hardly worth calling someone a "fucking retard" over, especially when your provided link kind of proves you wrong?
---
You can use addy darts for the entire cave and switch to dragon darts for Jad. 
---
The only difficulty you’ll have is when healers spawn. Don’t panic if they spawn and don’t worry about Jae’s hp going up it’s fine just focus on switching prayer then tag one healer then focus on next prayer and tag the second. 
---
Lining them up isn’t essential unless you’re getting hit hard. You can tank it with your def tbh. 
---
V helm/skirt will help 
---
Complaining about getting killed in the wildy lol
---
I mean the least offence , but its really not hard at all
---
What’s so funny about a rune crossbow?
---
I enjoy the lore is why I like them. Spacebarring and rushing every part of them makes them boring. And just as a tip incase you do it on another account, underground pass is a super easy quest if you train agility 10-15 higher than just the base requirement.

its not a case of it being difficult or not its just if you right click very fast on the circle its rng wether you click the right spot or not

The master clue steps that take you to these remote locations are actual AIDS. IMO the ice path one is on par with that "cliff" in the Kharazi Jungle cave that you go to in the Legends' Quest.

Another really annoying one is the emote clue atop the castle that you go during Darkness of Hallowvale. It's really tedious to get to.

No need for the toxicity, I assumed I was responding to the original comment of this thread. Also, there isn't anything to refute. Of course there are larger personalities out there, yet that doesn't invalidate a smaller one.

Hopefully she trips down the stairs and then the joke is on her

Yea restart and look up sotd pure if u want mage. But gonna take a while to train. If u want something quick do a range 2H pure in F2P. Cause you’ll get smacked around in BH.

This.

Cool, it seems you either get a shitload or you go dry for days, hence the problem with requiring them for contracts.

What would be the difference between

Full ancestral, w spectral, Kodai.

For bursting mm2 monkeys.

I got muted for even mentioning wow on this game more than once. I never played it but I remember disliking it with a passion as a kid. 
---
You keep slay helm, zerker, and fury - your 3 most valueable items.  Then, you keep all untradeables, including your guthans pieces and barrows gloves, as well as your rune pouch and all runes inside, and any quest teleports you happened to have with you.  What items are you wanting to return for?
---
This! Many fake clients around 
---
Which means both of you has completely separated love from sex and sex from love. Now good luck arguing that is healthy.

Maybe. The planks doesn't make sense since your can't enter house in building mode

I don't get how everyone is so sure this is a bot but okay

Nah. Masturbating is completely different. You acting high and mighty on the issue is pretty rich
---
Can someone explain the herb and tar thing to me? I see people doing it but I don't understand the purpose
---
Actually, I prefer this think bracket for wow. Really fun bg's
---
you never do void because you miss out on the extra max hit coming from tormented bracelet. spectral is minimal dps increase because maniacle monkies already have low magic. Basically anything that doesnt give you a max his is negligable so would sell spectral for ancestral pieces
---
I haven’t tried this before because I kinda panic as they spawn. I’ll def try this next time 
---
My friend grinded out 99 mining to try to reach virgin island im time for mudkips maxing party only to realize he needed 99 defence to pass the spikes after you mine the rock :c so it was me and him stuck at the rock watching mudkip sail off to get his virginity cape without us
---
Man I remember farming the trolls in those mines for granite shields back in the day.
---
Why, whats better to do instead then ?
---
Is elder maul useful for ironmen who don't pk?
---
Someone offer to trim this dude's armor
---
they also have darker mode, save your eyes
---
What are your other stats, cant give you advice with just your prayer and combat level.
---
They look like lucky charm marshmallows. Runescape should totally make a cereal. The marshmallows are skill icons and the oats are rune symbols
---
basement should be closer, atleast takes shorter amount of time
---
That’s the saddest shit I’ve heard. 
---
Just a magic pure isn't really suitable for pking in general, unless in f2p it might be pretty good at lower levels. If it's in f2p, it shouldn't be too difficult to just make a new account and start at 1 prayer again. The 45 pray magic buff doesn't increase your max hit with spells; it only increases the chance of landing a hit by 15%, so it's not that useful compared to all of the combat levels that it gives. Typically, a low-combat f2p build consists of having 1 defense, a good range lvl, good str lvl, 40 atk (for rune 2h), and 25/31 prayer (unless you're rich enough to not care about losing rune 2h every death). There are variations with having high range and mage lvls for a blast spell to be a ko weapon instead of a 2h, and that's for low levels.
---
If you're p2p, one fun thing to do is to follow [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-Hm5vuRI9Y) to create a mini-pure that uses mage (god spells and teleblock), range (rune cbow) and granite maul. If that is too much of gp/time investment, then a more simple p2p build would be to make an account with 1 defense, 1 prayer, 50 attack, at least 50 str, and at least 50 range. The higher you get in strength and range, the better. This is the magic shortbow/granite maul build that's very common in bounty hunter.
---
Imagine showing up at gargs with rune legs, torso and a glory with an elder maul lmao.  That would be so funny to see just pop right in
---
But that's a completely different location and entirely irrelevant. This would be for people who, y'know, want to respawn at the Grand Tree.
---
Seriously what was the point of your comment lmao

Thank you :)

Guy runs around with a shit ton of staminas (the technique requires you to always keep run on) while performing a "1.5tick" woodcut action, because when you are running as you cut the tree, it will roll two logs in one chop, as you notice sometimes he gets double by running around like that, but while herb tarring as you would 3tick other skills like fishing/hunting.
---
The way this works is Herb Tar on tick one, run on tick two, and chop on tick three, which apparently because of this combination of actions leads to potentially rolling two logs in a single chop.  What also helps is that there's three closely placed Teak trees that lets this method work so well.

It sounds pretty OP, I think the requirements should be higher.

There are so many worlds and you can only choose a handful of spots and then you have to hop. Of course it’ll be less busy with this many worlds and so many areas to check

I'm not an idiot, I know this. Still feels shitty when you're going for a certain drop and you end up getting something 10x rarer that I didn't want at all. I have a hellpuppy, skotizo pet, and the bandos pet that have been gathering dust in my bank since I got them
---
I agree with your definitions but in all due respect, the Jews lived in Egypt for 400 years and never became Egyptians, you never become part of their nation. You are and will always be a nation on your own. You do not assimilate into any Western country as they are their own nation, their own ethnic group - that you do not belong to.
---
Furthermore I'm well aware your religion mandates it's okay to lie to the gentile so forgive me when I tell you that I am not going to believe any subversive argument you come up with. You are your own nation and not part of mine or any other western nation.

The osrs wiki has weaknesses listed for most NPCs.

Yeah its a meme on this sub to make really bad arguments/math that lead to everything being 50/50 no matter what the actual odds are, or if probability even applies to the situation
---
Gotta agree. It's got a decent amount of content at most levels. In particular Hunter has red chins, black chins, implings, birdhouses, black salamanders, herbiboar all pretty viable for money or xp in the mid-high levels.
---
This... facts

The Arclight wording in particular was on the [fandom wiki](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Hellhound),  the [other wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hellhound) also does not mention anything about silverlight at all either.

It’s becoming more common. Supply and demand.

Also op did ask for how many chins, as they said gp/chins needed
---
Damn I’m gonna have to pay attention next time I die, could’ve sworn I lost my guthans but I must be trippin
---
Also it's not really used much in pretty much any aspect of the game.
---
People who really love to waste time!
---
Tome gives 50% damage boost and I don’t think you’re considering that when you factor in the waste of inv slot. Yes you can use combo runes but you’re losing 20 max hits. 
---
I don’t think you really read my comment and understood it. Good raiders don’t use all their food and like I said if you have a sang staff sacrificing one brew for the tome is worth for the time saved. Seers ring is also an irrelevant to your point because that takes an inv slot as well. Might as well use that taken inv slot for the 50% boost in damage.
---
a mages book is also better offensive bonus than a malediction ward. You just sacrifice def bonuses

Funny part is, Jagex said they would fix it like half a year ago.

Do you not have rfd done? Just use the chest

There is a really cool list of what to buy on the wiki for bursting monkeys.  I believe the order is occult, tormented, kodai, imbued god cape, then full ancestral.  There are exceptions based on magic lvl, but you get a +max hit for each item in that order.
---
The logs are like 50k gold per hour, there's no way it feels bad dropping that.
---
Okay, thank you.
---
I've been playing since 2004 and I've never thought MOBA gameplay was a fundamental piece of gameplay missing from OSRS. You're just talking about reskinning games you already like just with runescape. 
---
Dude thank you so much. Was asking the GE for 30 mins
---
Get this outta here
---
P2P, in F2P is limited the money making methods
---
Just play rs3
---
Castle wars and LMS are not MOBA minigames. Castle wars is PvP only, LMS is basically like Battle Royale (PUBG, Fortnite). Both have no PvM involved. So if they already took the idea from them, why not League of Legends and Dota?
---
It would be similar to Castle wars, but just with lanes, towers and mobs that spawn and attack the opposing side. Would be a very interesting dynamic (obviously why League and Dota are so popular) that would have a lot of room for unique gameplay.
---
The agility shortcut IS the reward... speeds up killing the boss by a massive margin. KQ is fine for what it is (~2m/hr)
---
You chose to restrict yourself
---
So I see you died, I hope you read this post because no one ever talks about the easiest thing to do with Jad.
---
There are two attacks. Range and Mage. Mage has more delay before you need to have the prayer up. Range you have to pray way sooner then the mage attack, not sure on specifically how long you have in between but none the less the range attack requires more reaction speed.
---
Don't randomly switch prayers. That's your mistake. Instead pray range. If he attacks with range your fine. If he attacks with mage you switch to mage, after the attack hits switch back to range pray no matter what. Then if he decided to mage you again only then switch to mage pray.
---
By always praying range you take away half of the problems you'll be having. Use a 75+ dragon dart switch for Jad. AfK on the last mage of wave 62 for 30 seconds or more to calm down, assuming you have the restores to afford it. I used an entire 4 dose potion to afk for 5 minutes at the last Mager of Wave 62 just to calm myself when I did eventually do it.
---
The healers will be difficult in the sense that they make you panicky. With your range level however you will need to kill them. So first before the rangers even spawn do a few switches to get in the rhythm. Once you do then start attacking him, ddarts in a blowpipe will get him to 50% in less than 60 seconds most likely.
---
Once the healers spawn only focus on switches, remember you got him to 50% in less then a minute anyway. Now once you see every healer on your screen and are full health + prayer slowly attack them one by one. Only one healer per prayer switch, don't let jad heal to full but you should be fine as most healers don't get to him right away. 
---
Ideally you then set up the healers in a congo line so you can avoid having to kill them, if not possible just take deep breaths, focus on switch to mage prayer if you need to and just dps 2 or 3. The last one should be fine and once that's done switch back to jad and let out a sigh of relief because now it's only a matter of time until you have the fire cape.
---
Just keep prayer switching and the blowpipe does the rest of the work.
---
TL;DR: Always pray range, mage attack has a delay and allows for a slower reaction time. Seriously read my post though.
---
OP getting trashed by all the Newscape players. They don't understand how devastating someone with aincents used to be in castle wars and theres no way of making them understand. If only we could destroy the GE and make players actually play the game again...
---
Lance easily outshines it, more are coming into game, not a big demand for stab weapons in game atm.

Where are you supposed to loot here? I went to the ge on a pvp world and it was hawked with lvl 3 bots using auto clickers or something. Are there better spots? 
---
Guthans is nice on the iron. I know tellying and getting food at warriors guild is faster, but just being able to stay in place until the task is done is worth imo
---
The people drop trading are the sellers and they do care because their livelihood often depends on it.  
---
I’m not sure how you can make a reddit post but still have now clue how to Goolge something. 
---
I thought you usually had to preface it with "autistic" for that, or back in the old-days it was "Idiot savant"
---
I’d rather ask actual people than rely on search engines idk
---
Sick dude, have fun.  Death mechanics are a lil wonky due to DDOS in the past.  You keep 3 items + all untradeables (literally anything untradeable, even stuff like volcanic whip and amulet of fury(t) ).  Your items stay on the ground for 1 hour, during this time nobody else but you can pick them up.  After 1 hour, they disappear.  (Only half of this is true in the wilderness)  So you can be a little more lax with how you game.  
---
tob being an unsafe death is bad game design however it is very consistent. any time you lose your items it's an unsafe death
---
Lmao
---
'You safely cross to the other side

If it wasn't damaged yet, then that can happen.  Otherwise you should've kept it.

I don't think you know how plan b works.. You take it after having sex within the next 24-72 hours(sooner the better) . You would have no idea if the girl was pregnant. It's more for if you didn't pull out, condom breaks, girlfriend misses a pill, etc.

Unless you skulled you wouldn't be risking anything just take monk robes glory brine sabre and a defender or something

Worst thing I’ve seen posted here in weeks. If you want to play a moba go fucking play league or dota or smite. THIS IS AN MMORPG.

Off the top of my head void is good for:
---
Learning Zulrah
---
Vorkath
---
Theater of blood
---
Learning raids 1
---
Void range is bis for some rooms for raids 1
---
Can use it for barrows
---
Out of those. At your stats I would say vorkath or Zulrah
---
Most aren’t directly intentional. Tick manipulation has been around for a long time so people will always be trying to find exploits.
---
the type of people that are realistically the type of people who would do the method are players that don't need a 10 minute guide of someone holding their dick telling them about the method. watching someone else do it is enough
---
Very true, doesn't change the fact that you're a hypocrite

They should make sure there's a setup link, but they should know the whole dungeon is "secure your account" and requires out of game action.

We've historically gotten out Grand Exchange data from the GE api, but now we scrape the Grand Exchange page on the Old School RuneScape website.

Danger noodle blessing the drops.

Yes, 36 slayer is VERY rare. Don’t see much people over lvl30 these days.

This is the tournament, a one-week event for the top 2k players of the previous season.

The open season starts in 1 week.

So pissed you can’t bank it

Scraping refers to using a program to grab data off of a website. We grab this data from the grand exchange page for each item on the old school RuneScape website. 
---
We’ve peaked boys

do you want an honest opinion?

Btw fuk RC. I would rather 99 firemaking only logs.

Give me some of that! Currently 39m dry on a tome of fire

Is that a trick question or do you genuinely wanna know what's good about it lol

Yeah, considering I posted here publicly and am currently training at Rock Crabs with 96 str. See my previous posts for context. I’m a VERY sentimental user of OSRS who is stuck in his ways to say the absolute least.

Practice switching quickly,preferably clicking while moving your mouse at the same time, to do this easier click one item then the one underneath then move horizontally, its easier to click while moving on a vertical axis than a horizontal one, keep your switches at the top of your inventory so they are in the same place every time.

i learned by not trying to kill it, i went in with just food and armor and tried to survive until i died. i did that until i got the hang of each phase

It is also bad game design for a HCIM to be able to obtain a lot of the best items in the game with zero risk? It effectively makes the point of the mode null at a high-level. 
---
This was honestly a big "culture shock" for me coming back to osrs. I mostly played between 2004-2010. I remember the duel arena being a lot of fun duels with a fair amount of stakes mixed in. Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but I thought the staking was more varied PVP and not so much just just maxxed combat whip v. whip.
---
When I came back to OSRS, I checked out the dual arena world. I wanted to do some fun dumb dharok fights with people. I found the world empty. Turns out, everyone was on world 2 instead. I felt like an idiot trying to just find a old fashioned fun duel. I guess nobody does that anymore.

I used to bank them cause I'm cheap. But then I realized it would only be like 5m of logs all the way to 99. And dropping the logs makes it way easier to not pay attention when doing it.

I got 99 rc while i afked brutal black dragons on my friend's account last summer. That got me like 400m. Then I did vorkath from 94-99 range, made like 220m doing that. Then 92 slayer made me like 180m or so (did cerb from 88 slayer and lots of dks before that). After that I made bank at raids. Until the raids none of my money was from luck lol.

I hope so

we're already way ahead of my knowledge of coding, but couldn't he search for any mention of "fire talisman" or whatever number its coded as, within the monster drop section of the code? or is the code not organised in that way?

Unfortunately the rs3 grand exchange site doesn't provide us with trade volume. The closest thing we have is the average volume of the top100 items sold for the last 7 days, which is mostly useless.

pay 5m to respawn in edge to have the closest respawn to a bank.

---
No, but I do in order to be excited about rune upgrades. Just having the GE available makes getting gp piss-easy 
---
black sallys with all traps is like 120k xp / hr and chins can be even better. so fast xp with no risk or fast xp fat stacks with high risk.
---
Cause playing on multiple accounts can be annoying. Some like to casually play on 1 account and netflix or something

Or make it like nmz herb boxes and bank the loot opening 2-3 packs is rough on space.

In the gaps that swampletics leaves, this series covers it. That's not to discredit this series, it's equally amazing. 
---
i'll never agree with this more than right now. i'm 71 RC currently wanting 77 because blood runes are at least partly AFK. i have use of the giant pouch so xp rates vs amount needed are at their most ass.
---
Funny, I played today and yesterday to get my elite void. 
---
I saw alfie do a Clue only UIM and it sounds really fun because of the hype from just getting an item from easy clue. Will prob do one cause why not. Not really feeling like actually playing an ironman cause my main cant even do end game yet
---

Question in title. Playing with my gf so trying to not level up too quickly and stay balanced with each other, so i'm mostly just increasing secondary skills.

Is galvek like vorkath were I can get my loot back or is it the other instanced type where I die all my gear is gone 
---
Nah but this shit would be great for ironmans 
---
Yeah the guybiaba teaser for the last region in Zeah, Varlamore (Which we know there's a big city in there called Civitas Illa Fortis
---
I wasnt defensive casting for a while just because i wanted 94 mage quicker while staying around my current def (81) because I would like to still do some pking eventually, however this means id need to go burst 94 mage first and ive been incredibly to lazy to go do that. I do have the money for it though, im 82 mage now and probably should. Because I will be defensive casting in future but i wanted to pk while still at a lower CB bracket. 
---
But I'm not that interested in pking, its why i chose to be basically 100% pvm lol. When i came back to the game a few months ago after 12 years ive seen lots of PvP videos and etc and the meta just doesnt interest me. Its all 1 hit mechanics basically reliant on some favorable rng. 
---
Pretty sure it's like Galvek. It is after the quest at least.
---
Autocap strikes again

Please post your updates every day
---
I wanted to say something like this.
---
Then I remembered runescape 3 has world 3. That world's existance makes me feel filthy.
---
Thanks thats what i thought. Runecrafting sucks!  
---
I haven't trained my account since the unwanted XP was gained. This was because I didn't want them to rollback any other wanted xp I had gained since. I know that would have been unlikely but let's be honest it Jagex so it was possible. 
---
 
---
Good move on their behalf, thanks Jagex.
---
On another note I posted in the forums post however I am still awaiting a reset..
---
Who the fuck goes to that one when the basement is quicker to get to?
---
Yes but you buy back your items, just dodge the comets and wait for your ruby e rng to kick in if you dont have s really good start just tab out and retry. 
---
Yeah, well, I am. Miss me with that gay shit, nigga! *dabs on you*

Cool thanks  I was just wondering if I could buy them back like with vorkath  fight

I wish they would update all plateskirts to have shin guards like the 3rd age ones they showed off. Even on girl models the skirts look like trash
---
Literally RT tho I asked someone for his pure's name so I could see it stats and he told me no cuz it could get hacked like that and I laughed at him and he went on a 20 minute rant how I'm an idiot

Noob here. Why would you intentionally lower your hp? Wouldnt that make it easier to die?

" I don't need fcape I have 99 cooking"
---
Do you really think lying and making boring ass videos helps your cause of getting people to watch you? 
---
if you are f2p, I will always suggest gold amulet crafting. you make decent crafting xp and decent profit for your time. smithing is fast to level up but expensive, so maybe you use the crafting profits to fund that?
---
If you look at my quest points this is the only quest I have left.

Rest in peace, bob. I should've read the quest guide more closely.

Runecrafting 
---
Dude i legit just watched this scene 30 seconds ago 
---
I know I'm simplifying this, probably quite a bit, but how can three brothers create a game that's considered revolutionary for its time with god knows how little money but a multi-million dollar company like Jagex can't make a simple ring's hitbox larger?
---
Yes. I know. Spaghetti code. But doesn't it feel like it's about time they fix it so that simple things like this doesn't take a good chunk of their dev time?
---
Micro transactions on the way!
---
you are allowed to trade between your alternate acounts freely as if they were individual players. 
---
Because this is /r/2007scape and that rune came out in 2018. Smh my dude.
---
i need to remember to start doing that now that i've got an occult altar in my house.
---
TBH setting up an authenticator is really annoying for every DMMT acc you have
---
Read his first point which is about enabling/adding adjustable delays.
---
Second point is about adding an - on-press temp button. My post is about enabling or adding that same type of delay theory to the one click drop toggle. Hence why I said that delay (of enabling one click drop) can really throw you off. 
---
You have never done dt?
---
I know that it's a meme but the hate for rs3 is totally undeserved, most of you guys don't even try it. Also, to be good at rs3 you have to learn what certain abilities do etc.
---
The boss fights during the quest were my first real bosses. As soon as I finished I rushed to do Vorkath. By far the most fun I've had in runescape yet.
---

O shit. I don't hide spoilers until Jagex hides polls??

crafting and firemaking would be fastest, smithing platebodies, mining, fishing, woodcut, and obviously rc is rly easy to train just suck it up and pick a f2p method.

I don't know if RS is "fun" but i dont think i find any game "fun"

its more just relaxing and an escape from real life, i can turn my brain off and play it.

Some of us value human life.
---
You don't have the karamja hard done? It gives unlimited teleports to shilo village gem mine, and it's super easy

Why not trade Areas
---
You unlock Demonic Gorillas by completing that quest which are a nice moneymaker.
---
Currently me. Any tips for the burn out? I’m current 1730 total. 
---
Who hurt you?
---
Yikes
---
Hill giants use crush attacks, so players should maximise crush defence. Rune platebody gives 72 crush defence bonus while the chainbody gives 78 crush defence, making it superior.
---
So does this count as /r whoosh ?
---
I’ve swapped over 70b rs3 to osrs and never had a ban, as well as transferring between accounts.
---
Jagex can check trades lol
---
Thank you! That is a pretty nice drop table. Best argument so far.
---
was i the only one who used world 1 Varrock west bank because I was non member?
---
You literally have an option to auto cast abilities. Also there is way too much free xp and microtransactions. You can literally have someone beat your decade old account in a few days if they are richer than you.
---
/r/runescapehentai is coming along nicely 
---
Was just training some magic and this dog got in the way. Didn't know it could block the guards...
---
They almost don't hit you, so it doesn't really matter and it is just a waste of money to buy that one too
---
I got skeletal visage at like 250 kc lol
---
can confirm, it's you that's retarded. never understood mongs like you... maybe try explaining your failed logic?
---
nah you go and use another account you have prepared for just that occasion, what you're looking at is a dumb kid trying to get his main unbanned
---
Except people get in to vorkath
---
I have a team of Venezuelans already recovering your acc. Gf nub
---
Late rs2 was already fucked and transitioning to rs3. Anything after 2010/11 was straight downhill.

You're not gonna get far auto casting abilities when doing a difficult boss. also, people that buy MTX like keys are disliked throughout most of the community.

But we're talking about a members only spawn point.

---
Wow. A few people must actually think someone would actually get violent about graphics. I was exaggerating. Yikes. 
---
To translate: I don't really enjoy the graphics of RS3 because there is no sense of reminiscing the old days. It's too fresh, too clean. I don't sense the comfort I once had in my bliss of being 12. The nostalgia is why I stay playing OSRS.   
---
Im at +80 dry atm, losing my mind lol
---
Who needs bosses when you can just get assloads of money and loot from squeal.
---
Rune chain is cheaper than platebody anyway. They are both at alch price so are perfectly exchangable for gold. If all you're doing is fighting hill giants, you might as well wear a chainbody. The real waste of money would be any amount of food that you use due to taking damage more often.
---
Closest one yet! Seeds and blessed dhide tho?
---
1/32k or error.
---
Smaller variants can drop them as well, just at a rarer rate
---
Monsters with a global table, Eg. Wilderness bosses which can drop other drops on the same table, like a D2H can also count toward it.
---
Why should a game stay looking the same forevermore? Updating only makes sense. Wanting to reminisce is all well and good but calling a game a failure because it doesn't cater to that is just bizarre. 
---
Squel doesn't exist anymore, and no, you don't get shitloads of money with treasure hunter, almost all items you get from treasure hunter are either untradeable or really low lvl cheap stuff. 
---
If you have the defence needed for that you already are a tank against them and if you go out the Edgeville Dungeon, Just cross the bridge and you will probaly find free fish

Hopefully twitch will take notice now though.

Thank you. I feel like no appreciated the grind that went into this. 
---
Barrows armors kinda had their own seperate places aswell. And Phats were at dragon chainmails (and later on over the wall).
---
You'd have to get to 55 magic to even use high alchemy. 
---
Do you lose access to Nieve after MM2?  I am noob.  
---
Either Castle Wars or Soul Wars. Most likely the latter of the two.
---
I didn't call it a failure. I said they failed me. It was also half joking, half serious, because it really doesn't matter. This is how things turned out. People can like RS3 if they want. I personally don't like it.
---
You do know that new quests came out since then, thus new more efficient ways are developed
---
Truthscape.com was such an amazing resource back in the times. The info there was miles ahead of other places and ahead of its time

Chaos ele pet is ridiculousy common compared to others!

hey
---
To do Enlightened Journey you need 20 qp and four skills at 20-36 anyways, so to add 55 magic to the "starting situation" of this uim mode wouldn't be that far fletched
---
zerker ring is definitely better 
---
faster kills = more kills
---
prioritizing str bonus means more kills per hour, if not kills per trip
---
Ok. I can agree with you on that. If it bothers you that much, you could also just not use them! Idk what to tell you mate, I’m not here to convince you to play RS3. It’s just not garbage like everyone here says it is. It’s vastly different, and I’m thankful that we have OSRS to play to get the core RuneScape itch.
---
6 kill trips might be doable, I usually get 4-5 But after that you should bank anyways otherwise you're losing out on a lot of money. 
---
Post the chat log that was sent to you from Jagex

Oh ok. It wasn't a community, but a group of people sharing interests in a specific area in runescape. Another dogshit comment apparantly also sharing the notion of community bad, automation( and QoL/efficiency) good

So yes, I, Adolin Kholin—cousin to the king, heir to the Kholin princedom—have shat myself in my Shardplate. Three times, all on purpose.
---
I must say this made me chuckle 
---
Was this a thing back then? I know it wasn't way back but I didn't come back to OSRS right at the start and just assumed custom clients weren't a big thing until the last 2/3 years?
---
Idk but clear your list they're probably all banned if they were dice bots
---
You’re an idiot if you can’t understand why people prefer OSRS over RS3.
---
I started at 60ish in january, so i would guess 2-4 months, depending on how much you play per day.
---
I was mostly doing blood runes then souls at 96
---
Looks like we need another pride event smh
---
Ah I see.  I started osrs when it came out so I've been excited for every upgrade I've gotten.  Super late game now so its kind of rare but it was a really cool experience.  Might start an ironman
---
so what? just because they (stupidly) broke the rule once doesn't mean the rule stops existing
---
True.
---
I'm not saying that? Im saying that most reason why people "hate" rs3 are stupid
---
Thats how gambling works. You come out on top every single time. don't question me I'm a hardcore gambler and I've never lost.

---
Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father
---
I used to low level stake all the time on weird pures. It was a good time
---
Probably very little unfortunately - I'm really nostalgic about RSC too, but realistically there isn't the same demand as there was for OSRS
---
Probably had that realization of "what will I do with my time if I quit though?"
---
Gorillas are fairly accurate when you miss prayers or when it switches after a melee cycle and you can only guess 50:50 what’s next.
---
You would benefit more from zerk/archer by killing them faster (or killing more/h) compared to being better able to tank.
---
More dps &gt; more defence.
---
Honestly besides treasure hunter it's not that bad, it's all cosmetic which some people might not like but it's all completely optional :/
---
That's why I never use that bank.
---
Thanks, it seemed unfamiliar, don't think it was in the game when I played in 2007.

Behind castle wars there are ogres, past the cannon spot is a nice spot where they are not aggressive and easy to safe spot. Ring of dueling is cheap and takes you there.

That's where I bought my first gmaul 😢

I'll give it a try, thank you.
---
Well I've done most quests at least 2 or 3 times and I know the dialogue for the most part but I just really could not care less about the story. Idk why because I dont feel that way in other games as much 
---
It happened because you thieved. 
---
Nah cause you could just hop to world 1 and try to buy there, if anything it was more stable most prices stayed around the same amount 
---
No, they came out in mid 2006. This is referring to dragonstone bolts.
---
Do y’all mean soccer?
---
Right but using funds from shortselling to buy options is just a slam dunk. Wonder how they would handle margin
---
They Should make a mode without a Grand Exchange. I loved the trading ways
---
They need to Tax the GE like 10 percent for people to sell their items via trades lol, plus extra gold sink
---
This has all ready been done
---
My 5b bank is all from chambers of xeric, not a humble brag but just saying not staking makes money too.
---
I haven't really followed the game since actual-2007, and even then I was mostly ftp, so I'm having trouble following some of the discussions on these threads. What's DHCB? DWH? BGS? I can google full names like Vorkath, but the basket full of common acronyms throws me every time. 
---
That's below drop rate, I'm 1700 kc and same boat
---
This period to me is the golden age of RS, I personally never really did the whole organised trading thing, but I very much enjoyed buying ores and selling them off for far higher from low end miners at lumbridge.
---
This type of exchange sadly cant exist these days, but it was a glory to be a part of
---
Merchers at the time were probably one of the loudest communities to stand against GE when it was announced. We thought that the GE would be the end of merching. 
---
Is brimstone ring bis over seers (i) when bursting smoke devils? 
---
I have both, I use brimstone mostly for dks/raids and was wondering if the passive is worth bringing to burst smokies 
---
Not sure if this still works, but I used to plant flowers where they put their traps by spam clicking the seeds when they picked them up. They dont move to new tiles and they cant set up a trap on the flowers, so it buys you a few minutes of peace. 
---
Cya acc
---
thanks! 
---
PM me bro, my clan and I do just this we share stuff about the game and group up for minigames and wildy bosses and stuff
---
600 dry on bandos if that makes you feel better &lt;3
---
Flipping v-skirts was mine.
---
No it wasnt.
---
It was nostalgic, sure. But it ducked when you just wanted to play the game.
---
As far as I know, While Guthix Sleeps isn't being added to OSRS, so the bears are safe.
---
There weren't nearly as much items being sold at once, so the market was much less monolithic. You could only have 2k people in Falador, meaning that the entire volume of barrows item trading at any given point might be controlled by a couple dozen people. 
---
And buying and selling was less convenient. If you wanted to buy a full Dharok's set, you couldn't just put the order in the GE and come back an hour later for your set. If you didn't want to stand around saying your price or waiting for a good deal to come up, you would have to buy high, or sell low. 
---
A lot more trading just happened in random banks too. If you needed runes, you could walk into any bank in RS and say "buying 1k law runes 250ea", and someone would hit you up. This was also interesting because small volume items sold for a lot more. If you were buying a single law rune it was common to just offer 1k as a courtesy. 
---
Serious nostalgia right here....fairly accurate too from my memory. I would have added Phats to the D chain area too.

---
According to [this link](https://m.tip.it/times/view/28-the-rares-market) santas were already 4.5m by early 2006. I don't think Santa hats were the same price as rune unless you went back to like 2004ish
---
You are overpaying- its 1m no fees from my clan :)
---
Woah that's pretty damn good
---
You know there's a storage next to the camp and pool right?
---
I use to always carry supplies with me to make a fire just so I could feel a bit of acceptance from the community
---
the answer is 42 because 42-0 is 42
---
then you add the 30 coins so 42+30 is 72
---
then you subtract the loaves of bread so 72-10 is 62
---
then your mom needed 20 gp so 62-20 is 42.
---
and boom, the answer is 42.
---
I do not mind cosmetics at all.. I mean whatever people enjoy right.
---
I like how the game looks, graphics wise.
---
I wish there was a HD client for OSRS even.. Like the 2009 rs graphics.

I'll just stick to osrs. 
---
Beautiful

I think they mean kick ball
---
Don’t talk about my life like that 
---
sounds like the perfect time to make an ironman and afk fish while you play on your main. The satisfaction from an ironman will give you a new breath of life for OSRS
---
I just skip it. 
---
So you say 'lets get this bread', but still have no money, so you say 'lets get that bread' but still have no money, so-

post-99 is the best time to act like this since you already got the skill mastery achievement, banned or not the skill was mastered.  currently 97 if I make it to 99 I'm gonna wear that cape with a combat bracelet and shout a simple "hop retard" to everyone I meet on post-99 task hahahahaha
---
I personally wish GE as we know it didn't exist.  We all got played by Jagex.  They polled GE without polling a good version of a Trading House (similar to Vanilla WoW)
---
Used to merch obby shields and furies, can confirm they were right near the tree patch.

Also, where were party hats sold? Never was rich enough for one :( I do recall hweens and Santa’s being sold in the lower value rare area.
---
Didn't x mark the spot have you go X steps right of Bob's axes, then x steps north? Which puts you at the northeast corner of Bob's axes? 
---
There are quests you can do for those early levels
---
Because you hit a point of diminishing returns eventually... on a fresh account you are constantly getting levels, finishing quests and making progress. But on a higher level account you might only get one level a day, or less, and have most of the content already completed.
---
Not until uhhh 2009 maybe?
---
Mostly depends on how many prayer switches you mess up. You probably won't get very long trips, but once you get pretty good at them the only time you should take any damage is when it switches from melee and you guess the wrong prayer.

Eh. The game has changed. I don’t know if it’s for the better, but it’s definitely changed. 
---
As a fresh Ironman, do players genuinely dislike them? I’d rather not start the game off with the whole world against me... seemed like a fun challenge to learn the game.
---
I'm not sure if there are any guides  because quite simply the game is what you want to do with it.  You don't have to do anything in any certain order.  Now there are some things that are suggested like train strength before attack and defence,  and train mage for teleports to major cities. But you can do whatever you want.  But to get a good feel for the game in free to play.  Start killing some cows and collect there hides and bank them.  Get a good amount and sell them to buy your first set of armor.  Look at the quest requirements for the free to play quest that have no requirements and do them.  They don't have to be in a particular order ,  but doing them and getting the rewards and XP rewards could give you a feel of progression. I would recommend keeping your combat stats close together,  like do 10 strength, then 10 attack then 10 defence.  But ultimately you don't need to worry about efficiency in anything,  your just trying to get a feel for the game,  so if something looks interesting,  go do it.  But be warned,  this is a grindy game.

Do you account for the random times a new day starts and ends on the ge page? Sometimes a day only lasts a few hours on there, that's why there are some days with 1/3 of the volume for no apparent reason.
---
Personally I really love getting brimstone key drops tho
---
Didn't that quest have you take X steps east of Bob's axes, then X steps north? Putting you at the northeast corner of Bob's axes? 
---
It was part of the game. 
---
Any private servers with this still alive?
---
I love the idea that konar is throwing keys from the sideline like "I can't believe he's actually doing this task, here you get to look at my box" 
---
Jesus Christ. You mad man, you had the massive balls to risk 100k against a boss that's almost guaranteed a 150k drop. What courage. What bravery. 
---
I also remember basically “waiting in line” to enter world 1 and 2
---
We talking about banks in lumbridge mate
---
I mean there is a bank on the second floor of the Grand Tree just west of the ladder, much faster than the spawn-to-bank run at Lumby and Fally, I think adding a bank chest right by the spawn would be redundant.
---
Just a couple of douchebags, just report them for disruptive behaviour
---
It’s 2.5-3m/hr assuming you hit the drop rate of rangers, which you’re likely to because that’s how drop rates work, if you only do a few then yeah you won’t make much if anything (they generally break even without rangers) but if you do them till you get rangers it’s guaranteed profit and a lot of it
---
there is a limit of 400, but you need to be a member - shown in your picture.
---
Thanks for the tag
---
That's a good shout tbf, I just get pretty bored with vanilla and don't know what mods are good nowadays
---
Then keep doing konar! RuneScape is a game after all. Don't let the hyper efficient crowd spoil your fun! 
---
Could get it from bird nests
---
Some people just like to be jerks and others believe too much of the game’s development has started o revolve around Ironman mode, which puts them off. 
---
All in all I’ve found that most people are pretty pleasant though.

I have fond memories of buying my pink phat for 6.3m. I thought I was rich when I flipped it for 7.3m a week later. Regrets
---
I’m trying my best to make it 1:1 but in some places that’s not possible. But it’s at least 95% 1:1
---
As for something to do, just do all f2p quests and do dragonslayer. by the time youre done with that, you should be much more familiar with the game.
---
This is exactly how I would of put it other than I think Torags armour being the south side of the duck bridge
---
I've seen so many variations that are wrong so its nice too see this. Shame it never took off in OSRS and we resorted to Varrock. 
---
I remember flipping a whip up to full dharok then getting trade screen scammed because I got into a rhythm and had to start all over again but I still had a great time

I feel like in other similar games the quests are the game, or the main storyline.
---
In the runescape, the quests are a means of unlocking things you want to get to be it monsters, areas, equipments, etc 
---
Excuse me,  but "poll results" and "actively hides" - aren't these just buzz words that dumb people use to sound important?

No it's not, all combination runes act the same way, OP is wrong.
---
Christ people are being dicks to you for no reason lol. He needs as many clues as a medium clues have steps. He needs to complete them all in morytania, so most clues are going to be unusable. The only way to get more than one clue is to juggle them since you can’t get more than one clue at a time normally. 
---
how did you decide to make the walls? In RS the walls dont take up the entire square, theyre on the edge of each tile but in MC a block takes up the whole square. Did you choose to make the walls on the inside or outside?

Don't wanna be a debbie downy here, but I'm pretty sure those are like an old model of the regular tree, that also give regular logs?... I know they're on tutorial island, and I've seen them on Zeah too

Nah I've done a bunch without guides for the first time and I think that really just solidified my hatred for them

Yes we are planning on making this public, [here’s the link to the discord where it’s all being organized ](https://discord.gg/A4EGpcr)

This is too niche. In fact, it's kinda poorly executed. I welcome swampletics memes with open arms. But this? This needs to die. 
---
You would be best to stick to the official client or Runelite to be honest, Jagex don't openly encourage 3rd party clients despite using Runelite themselves but there is no guarantee that another 3rd party client will be viewed in the same way.
---
Runelite/Konduit/OSBuddy are the 3 most commonly used 3rd party clients, I'd suggest sticking to them

So many questions.....first off, why are you using the strength prayer?

I’ve tried quartz but not white glass. I’ll give that a go when I hop on today

I remember W2 fally. Good times. Flipped a lot of dh on that little bridge, barrows by set was organized as well.

Zerker is 42-45 Defense. At this level you can make a med Level. 75 defense piety pure. Or just make a max main at that point.

It wasn't a fun part of the game.

I'm really trying to remember what that looked like but its been so long lol
---
Live and learn. If it sounds too good to be true, it's a scam, 100%. That's how it works in this game. Never think otherwise.
---
Différent people find fulfilment from different things. I always found resources gathering a logical part of training, whether is by harvesting them on your own or by trade. I also used to like collecting items, even common things like runes and stuff like that. With the GE, this activity was made useless.
---
That being said, I have about 200k burnt items in my bank back when I was still active in osrs. Collecting those was probably the closest I’ve felt to that sense of achievement that I used to feel in the pre-GE days.
---
I don’t think that Jagex made the wrong decision. The community clearly wants it. I’m just saying that it takes a big part of the fun out of the game for me, personally. That’s all!
---
In some layouts it can be a little better than 3+1s but mostly its just for a change of pace. Some people really like super scaled raids, some dont
---
The ge is the best thing to happen to the game
---
Words of wisdom. Nothing is free. Giveaways are fake. Any osrs link is a phishing site. Use the ge, don’t trade with players. No streamers are quitting.

Oof, that's incredibly offensive to people with OCD. Like joking you have cancer when you cough in public without knowing if someone there has cancer.

south east of the barrows section in the park obsidian armour and weapons
---
I went through google images and was able to find a map, because nothing was there it is tricky to remember 
---
Get that strength and attack up a wee bit more, complete Falador Hard Diaries, and do giant mole.
---
Willing to bet OP is a low level hardcore ironman too scared to go to mage bank.
---
In PVP worlds it’s PVP when you teleport there, when you go up the ladder, all the way to the bank. Hence why Adding a chest or simply turning it into a safezone is fine.
---
It is kinda awesome how that area developed. Like even without being told "you trade X here", most players would realize what goes where. I know I made my own map in paint as a reminder and it was pretty similar for what goes where.
---
It was also really awesome to see the area grow over time. Back when I began to use W2, it was confined more to the Park and the area around the bank. Then as new updates came out, it started to move towards the North Gate and then down over the bridge. It was especially neat when it ended with 3rd Age since that was the most expensive next to some rares.
---
I remember one time when I was browsing around 3rd Age, I saw someone selling a 3rd Age Coif, which was BiS Ranged, for like 9M or something; whatever the price was I had that much money. So I excitably bought it... Then remembered GWD recently came out and the Arma Helm was better (though at the time I think Arma Helm still cost considerably more).

Peculiar boast, but alas

Just read up some more, apparently the max combat level in classic was 123. I guess it is purely coincidental then indeed. Thanks for thinking along you all!

Worst thing ive ever seen...

Im convinced its best money making method
---
This is a tortoise. 
---
This is Runelite ofcourse, The health bars are "Status Bars"
---
Damn, I was so close. The only attack exp that I would get from quests would be for unlocking piety, putting me at 61 attack.
---
That's very true, if an item did lower in value, the news would spread like wildfire as it was highly unusual.
---
The only effort is setting up the emulator. Once you do you only need to click one time on the fishing spot and then on each fish without worrying about shift. Wouldnt even need a keyboard
---
I got my first at 3kc then second at 34kc and now I haven’t seen one in over 200 kc now 
---
Nah man the gym is one of the best places to go if you’re doing a hobby alone, you see someone do a hard move or struggling a little bit and you just start cheering them on and then you have a free in on a conversation with them when they come down. Or just ask a question about something you’re having issues with and a lot of climbers are super friendly and will happily help you out. Especially if you go at the same times on the same days you’ll definitely see the same people there a lot and it quickly becomes a fun community activity! Get out there and climb man! Best thing I ever did
---
I did that rune sudoku for all my runes as a low lvl hc, cosmics, laws, even deaths before is started cat farming and barrows.
---
Yeah, I already did Stronghold of Security and bought some scimitars as the YTB guide adviced, I even did 20+ woodcutting and 25+ firemaking as some comment adviced and tbh, I enjoyed it a bit, because I have 2 monitors and I was just chatting w/ my friends etc. I've seen somebody advising not to level up combat stats except Magic in f2p, idk why tho :D
---
Haven't played In a while, but from what I remember is that jagex became money hungry, and made exp way too easy to obtain, and even p2w with loot crates essentially that dropped high amounts of exp. Pretty sure A Friend did a video about him spending some thousands to buy a 99 essentially. They just made far too many changes far too quickly without consulting the community. At least that's what I understand.
---
U can't invest time better don't play. Or afk WC till 200m

I was a scrub killing blue dragons in taverly dungeon when a guy died to dragon fire. I look over and see a beautiful Robin Hood hat sitting on his bones. Selling them in fally park was the first time I had over a 1m cash stack.

Yeah true, if you have a low budget that’ll be the smarter option

Real men bought their whips in Seers Village for 11m

Barrows isnt all that hard. Proselyte has a great prayer bonus, you'll be fine aslong as you have prayer 
---
use cocoa beans on it to turn it brown
---
Yeah pking on high levels is pretty lame. You basically attempt your 1 hit kill then leave if it doesn't work because there's no point continuing. No one dies Without being stacked for 90+
---
Use cocoa beans on it to turn it brown
---
Used to but nature runes by the hundred of thousands into millions on forums and would sit in w2 selling them all. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Oh I misread
---
If they didn't add ironmen in the same update the game would have died.

Seeds and unids are definitely there, couldn't say about the dhides

I was at Sand crabs yesterday, hopping worlds until i found one thats empty. 15 minutes later, some kid comes back and says " i was taking a shit, this is my spot!" And trys to argue that this world is his because he spents 5 hours training here. Sorry bud, you leave for 15 mins its fair game. 
---
Honestly if you don't have a main account just level this one up as high as you can for bossing etc and make a new account for pking in the future.
---
That was playing the game.

the real efficiencyscape

OSRS is mobile now, there’s always time
---
Maintaining what? Membsm
---
They have been up for like 2? 3? months now. In the past they have always only been up for a couple weeks. In the past the biggest concern was that they would kill PVP activity, but it turns out that isn't really happening.
---
&gt;things like bosses, raids and especially the inferno could be practised  for without costing the player anything which removes the point of them  even being considered challenges in the first place. 
---
oh god who cares lmao
---
Convenience is not always a good thing.
---
Lol fair enough, I guess it was the “yo retard” that made me think of Chad 
---
Most people call them harambes
---
Would hasta be better than range at 75 attack 99 strength?
---
to real
---
Yes you will, might be difficult but it is doable. Use a rune crossbow with diamond bolt e and your best ranged gear.
---
UIM use this shop too pre-wizard guild and it's the best store to sell runes for GP.
---
There are still people who aren't max and don't have 10b+ banks? TIL
---
This is why i couldn't ever buy stuff before ge. l00000000l
---
I thought this was the case too, but i feel like if the ge wasn't introduced then someone would just make a fansite equivalent that would essentially be the same for players that knew about it while leaving noobs to fend for themselves.
---
I'm not saying there aren't story lines. I'm saying the point of the game isn't the quests.
---
Even mm2, a lot of people only decide to do it to access demonic gorilla's. Ds2, people do for the weapons and vorky and so on
---
so not american.....

 \- The MTX
---
 \- The constant barrage of exclusive items
---
 \- The events that never end and the dailies/weeklies/monthlies that keep you from doing anything else
---
 \- EOC is a thing sure you can use legacy but that's a complete joke by comparison
---
 \- All the high end gear degrades to dust with a ton of upkeep cost severely limiting training options
---
 \- OSRS has a more in depth skilling scene (take construction as example) as well as a more enjoyable combat scene
---
 \- All the updates that aren't MTX cater towards the high end community with bossing and slayer making it difficult for new players to find enjoyment
---
&gt; The game just sends you lumbridge without any direction. 
---
RS is really the most existential game
---
I have 3 tomes in 500 kc, feels badman.
---
What was KC of your first pet?
---
How much FM xp are you on?
---
I bought a d med for **900k** right next to the pond in 05-06, after mining coal for what seemed like a loooong fucking time. In reality I was probably only at like 65 mining, but I'd been toiling away in the mining guild day after day and it felt like I'd finally *made* it when I bought that thing. A d med, full rune, probably a d long. A true cute noob on his way to glory. The culmination of my first couple years playing runescape.
---
Oh god please take me back
---
Honestly, I'd be satisfied with it mouse-droiding around on the ground if that's what it took to get this in the game.
---
Seems pretty broken for wildy
---
And in context this is still from scratch, the bank is starting from the very beginning without relying on any previous work for assistance.  I will repeat this it is not nor has it ever been about the account it is about the bank and obtaining one gear set. 
---
Haha, no.
---
why even have the "i"?
---
Shame pink phats never existed.
---
I did a task of these hoping for a shard. When i didn't get one i decided to stay there until i got one. Im over 1900kc dry of a shard right now, its so frustrating
---
I've been wanting to play again for some time, but the thing putting me off is that the game seems to have changed so much since I last played. I have no idea what to do. I have about 5-10m in the bank I think in items.
---
Where do I even begin?
---
Couldn’t you convert skirts for legs in rsc, oh wait they had female plate armour too I remember now 
---
Total level my dude
---
Yeah I searched all monsters and it looks like the case. I hope with all quick quests they will add one more easy boss to fill the list of 5 and perfect the NMZ method
---
Yes. Standing around and trading took up so much time and finding niche items required way more effort. Its was just bots and scammers. Being able to buy bulk items in 10 seconds without getting ripped off is the best thing that ever happened to this game and people only reminisce because it reminds them of when they were kids lol
---
I was one of the rich heads in the p hat section with r2pleasent and Duke freedom. Fuck I wish I was wealthy still..
---
I'm not walking around with a cosmetic 1 mil risk unless I know I won't die. My pets stay uninsured in my POH for the majority of the time.
---
Just barely passed 100m at 1700 total
---
Take your rational thinking off of Reddit
---
I remember the guy planned to cannon to 99 range and then range till 99 hp. I think he fucked up tho and got an hp level before he got 99 range so maybe he's restarting lol
---
That triple primordial post made me so sad, took me 1894 kc to get prims.
---
Don't mean to be rude, but I use the same password for damn near everything but even I'm not that big of a retard to not use a different email password. It's common sense. If they get your email, you might as well not have a password at all.
---
those people are a lucky minority and aren't representative of the average person killing vorkath, so you have nothing to ree about brother
---
I feel like that highly depends on your skill level with PvM. It takes some people not even 10 deaths to get to Warden.
---
This photo is actually from a private server as you can see in the lower left corner. 
---
Cool story
---
I wasn’t that smart back then 
---
Old revs couldn't tb you could they? Whenever I got attacked by one I would just immediately tele.
---
I have no idea, the only thing I can think of is people started selling in one spot and the popular items/consumables were around the bank as that is where most people typically are in Falador then players began spreading out so their messages could be seen clearer.
---
You would get 1 person selling Rune armour which would then naturally bring another person who wanted to buy the rune armour into that zone then the cycle continues.
---
Just a guess.
---
Badger
---
Yeah true, it's almost as if he intentionally posted it to this subreddit rather than others
---
Clue. Scrolls. Treasure trails are so much fun to do, even the easy ones. Currently working on a master clue and I need 75 FM to continue, so I've been grinding for a while :)
---
Fairly accurate. Also, Unid herbs were traded out front of the bank a lot as well. Also, party hats and masks always seemed to be traded on the other side of the wall from where you have d chains noted. Good map though!
---
I fell for guthans/leaf spear here and never went back
---
Just rebuild your xp on green drags, sell the bones and and enjoy your new pk gear
---
I've always found the diaries to be really fun and satisfying. It's nice to collect everything you need and bang out a bunch of tasks. Plus, you get some pretty neat rewards from the harder chapters.
---
Umm why do I need to put in my pin, don't you guys recognize me?

No bitch we're a major branch of xyz bank

I am in a clan, solely for the new and returning players! We have a good balance between new and veteran players. Check out g0 flames g0 (zeroes, not o's)!

Go to the stronghold of security, there you'll be informed about keeping your account safe.

Also, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

Oh, and never click random links and also make sure the page you're accessing is the official rs page.

I firmly believe there are rangers under there.

I mean scrubs who use the wiki, yea. But I wouldn’t know about that.....

Idk maybe i'm remembering it wrong, I thought the ones that used to roam the wilderness would TB you.

Lmao there's an entire section for Rune Boots and Cavaliers

Chances are people gonna 1 item rag him and he has no content lol
---
Definitely not with that much traffic. Most PS's I've .....*seen others play*...... have the grand exchange.
---
Chad shares the kills. Sure he gets the loot because of his fat DEEPS, but he is willing to split the xp.
---
Though he is kind of a dick when he slaps his fat cannon wherever he wants.
---
Sorry you need to finish regular mememan mode first.
---
What's your PK gear? Bone cbow with full studded and lobsters? Green drags are slow money and high risk.
---
Btw
---
Nice.

I mean if he’s iron he’s gotta put it in herby that’s the rule. If not, good point.

I suggest looking into getting the Rogue Outfit. You literally can't have anything in your inventory when you're getting it, including pieces of the Rogue Outfit... You'll have to suicide after each piece, although using the 'quick route' it is possible to do it fast enough that you can just drop/pick up the pieces. You can only store the outfit when you've got the full set. The Rogue Outfit is great for GP from Knights or Seeds from Master Farmers. 
---
lmao

That would tske too long. I have to get stuff done the fastest wsy

I mean it was one of those 'part-time' jobs ran by guys yknow like in their mid 40's that're constantly on their phones but their policy is like super strict on any other employees over literally everything?
---
What content in the game do you find interesting
---
D
---
How is it limited to 400 but my max items are in the millions, I have 1 million gp
---
Start doing some quests to get barrows gloves.
---
  
---
Do the pest control and barbarian assault grind for void and fighters torso.
---
Do some diaries
---
If you like skilling over PvM, afk some fishing and cooking, and head over to wintertodt.
---
If you like pvm, do a bunch of slayer tasks to reach better money making tasks.
---
Remember to do your farming runs and birdhouse runs.
---
I bought a tab A for osrs and have had no problems at all. I cap GPS at 30 and get 20 hours+ per charge. Definitely recommend, stylus helps with fat fingering too
---
Wooooosh
---
that I can live with. In Canada minimum is 14, which is totally doable *IF* you can actually get in enough hours at a place, which you can't, because it's 14.
---
Hey thanks for the response! I think that’s probably how it came about. Really fascinating to think about.

You didn't censor the important things though.  Your private messages are set to "friends" and I've already discovered 3 people from your friends list and I'm recovering your account (and theirs) as I type this right now.  Thanks for the gold, scrub.
---
Typically do the highest for your combat level. If you want to get skater helm fast then do lower slayer master but every 10th, 50th, etc go to the highest slayer master for quick points.
---
If you're serious, ToB, efficient 4+1 CoX with prescouts. Otherwise stake

I would fish lobbies for hours at the local library with my friends. This is too nostalgic

I gave him some bones for helping me out, can't believe there are monsters out there shoo-ing him away all the time :(
---
I have the s10+ and I'm loving it, I hope you love the s10 too they're so nice
---
Zulrah. Vorkath. Hydra. Any boss I can just non stop farm. I like mostly all other content but I don’t like how they set up Cox
---
Congrats mudkip! Looking forward to the post-max content buddy. 
---
I'd buy prayer pots on the forums and flip them in Fally
---
I read that pest control gives full do now so yeah why not, perfect stats to start. If you are going to melee it and want to procrastinate more, get b gloves, fighter torso and fire cape first if you haven’t already 
---
To the right of the entrance of the park was also Dragon Bones/Other bones iirc
---
Yeah most likely lol
---
Yet my bank app doesnt need a second third party app to keep me secure....

More than that, wasn't it 600k vs 2m?
---
It's possible, but highly improbable that it's an item from the mourning's end questline (can't remember which specifically) where you need to shoot painted toads at sheep using something that looks like that. As most people have said though, it's likely the event rpg, which just increases your attack speed whilst you kick enemies. Django sells it.
---
No bro sorry no once cares
---
Honestly, when you're at nylo and you have to do a 5-6 way switch every 2 attacks shit gets fucked in your invent very fast. Same for solo raids at olm but more because of having to take off my avernic and prims when going from melee to mage hand and back. Things just get kinda screwy when swapping that many items without losing ticks.
---
I know I'll get down-voted for being a party pooper, but the map is wrong. Upper left was cosmetic items like scrafs/masks/etc.
---
It means women don't need to earn as much to buy leg protection
---
So the rest of the quests i can do except those to not get defense
---
Makes luring harder? We can't have that in osrs
---
Missed these legendary days because my parents refused to pay for p2p for me (even if I gave them money)
---
Sad sad 
---
People are great. 
---
I was at a sand crab spot for 3 hours, and all of a sudden this massive chad comes by and stands exactly where I am and starts attacking everything. I ask him politely to hop and his response is “nty” and then he proceeds to call me a garbage can and crybaby. 
---
Like huh. I just hopped after that and found another world. He was just wasting my time and his. 
---
Yeah I have dragon gloves atm, need a few more quest points before I can get the barrows. And I just did my first two attempts at a fire cape the other night and wanted to switch it up a bit so I was maybe thinking pest haha. I did a couple rounds and was getting pretty good xp actually so that's a good point. Need to do some combat training anyways 
---
0/24 so far...
---
What about kraken pet? Or chaos ele pet
---
Just range or melee too?

I mean, why are temporary skill boosts applicable for the achievement diary in other cases then, but not this one?
---
did u never play wow? how do u not like pets?!?!
---
Worst one I've seen so far 
---
It just adds to the spam. It's not even good, view botting to counter view botting isn't really the best solution. The best solution would be twitch giving people permission to take down somebody's channel for 12 hours so twitch staff can further review it.
---
No, "Snowflakes" are custom restricted accounts, which are usually still ironman accounts.
---
(Karamja only, Caveman only, Swampletics, etc)
---
There is no reason to use a Craw's bow because the passive effect that makes the bow good only works in the wilderness.

Obligatory dog tax?

Been doing farm runs only for 2 weeks now. My gf has asked if I am almost done. I normally say just a few more etc to plant. Yesterday she asked me if I was playing Farmville. I said I think I am. 
---
It has unlimited dragon arrows so I thought it would be good for something. Yes, I know the stats are equal to MSB(i).
---
Art!
---
Just unacceptable.  I once had a round that took almost 4 minutes.  I can’t imagine needing to do that again for a clue.
---
To be the devil's advocate here, he's probably been crashed many times and he'said now snapped become toxic, especially since he won't get any loot if you do damage.
---
I am the same man. It is always on friends only. I don't know how or why it was turned on but I'm glad it was. Even had a nice convo afterwards.
---
Yes it was.
---
3rd Age was released on June 12th 2014.

I normally just try to not be stubborn and hpp whether I'm somewhere first, or I've hopped and someone is there. Could call it beta, I just don't see the point in arguing with someone over a spot. 
---
was always a tense 30 seconds or so waiting to see if the drop would appear or someone already took it somehow
---
i actually did intercept someone's drop trade once accidentally
---
Jagex can’t so much, and the streams are already taken down within minutes, they just make new ones just as fast as they get banned.

I hope they put the wrath rune up there so I can stop seeing this same exact post

Gracias man. I hope so, too. XD Told my buddy at work and he's like "Wow, 60kc for your first decent drop? That fuckin suckkkkkks"

Eating food at ardy knight Is xp waste. You save ticks suiciding and teleporting back

I really enjoyed getting those achievements, all the perks you unlock on the way are awesome as well.
---
Or just read the message like a normal person

Most of them are questionable, but I'd say grinding through that was worth it. +1 friend and my first 99 on osrs. 
---
Thank you! 
---
Is this supposed to be Tom? It's hard to tell
---
Was there YouTube app on the treadmill?
---
All these are correct!! I love it!! 
---
Yes :(
---
How close are you to elites? I've got about 20 levels to go(8rc and 8 fishing rip) but max seems legit unattainable for me.
---
It seems like most people that max really like going for post 99 xp goals, pvm goals, or they just make a new account entirely
---
Have you completed the Dragon Slayer quest? If you haven't, try to complete that quest so you can wear the green d'hide body. Max out your gear as often as you can :)
---
&gt; My eyesight is very poor if you haven’t been able to tell.
---
Ahh, so this is Where the Truth Lies..
---
Isn’t it about it looking like an RPG? The weapon. It can also shoot at other people. 
---
Actually flax is a different problem. Stuff that was insanely easy to bot (essence, flax) was intentionally price nuked by sticking it onto droptables simply because they can't reliably stop people from suicide botting those resources
---
i got a smouldering stone from a hellhound task once 
---
Nice goals, I started to enjoy agility as it was so relaxing at the Ardounge course, but doing it on other courses was a numbing grind for me.
---
Ftp is the real Ironman experience
---
Cool story. 
---
How you gonna train prayer? With the remains of the thousands of innocents that were slaughtered by your hand?
---
I can't speak for the RuneScape Wiki Admins but the Warframe Wiki on Fandom has had constant issues with Fandom adding autoplay videos to articles without permission. The videos usually showed out of date info from old YouTube videos. The mobile site is also badly optimised and the volume of ads that load with every page makes navigation arduous. Fandom is doing a good thing, providing free wiki hosting as they are, but there's too many downsides. 
---
I used to merch Elegant pieces, little me thought I was top shit when I got my first 500k.
---
Ancient repost
---
i got the bucket on my first kill, still no pet tho
---
Demonic harambes
---
Furry? 
---
And also any weapon steel+ doesn't exist in real life so combats gonna be a bitch
---
I was speechless when I finally got rangers after grinding meds for so long, it's worth it though, so satisfying. Also all the other loot and the occasional Master clue that popped up was always a treat.  
---
Nice those perks from the diaries are well worth it. I remember me and my friend's first 99 was cooking and we were racing. I used to tell him good night, then turn my private chat off, switch worlds and keep cooking later into the night because I was so desperate to win. Have fun while the wife is away, sounds like a nice time.
---
Okay.
---
Plenty of people do revs in PVP worlds. Giving them a way to instantly teleport to safety below 30 wild kinda defeats the point of a PVP world.
---
Exactly
---
The actual thing hes assigned to kill are big dragon like things in the karuulm slayer dungeon. They share a name so it makes it funny 
---
Autism is a real life disorder, so how are you going to play? 
---
Nice, you learn something new every day.
---
I guess it's neat his account is maxed but don't really get this kind of playstyle. I skimmed through the video and it looked like he doesn't even have any high level gear. Not even any zenyte jewelry so his best gear is probably the zulrah stuff. Maybe it's just that I like seeing completionist stuff but I can't help but think this was all just mindless xp grind not even doing quests/diaries and not even some random event emotes  
---
What’s your range lvl ? 
---
Read up here: https://runescape.wiki/w/Forum:Leaving_Wikia.
---
no you shut up
---
How polite of you. 
---
Drakes are an actual slayer monster, this duck is just coincidentally also named a drake
---
What solo gear do I need for Bandos and is it doable?  
---
I’ve watched a video from mr mammal from 2015, I figured it would be outdated, but not too much since Bandos never changed(?)  
---
I’ve heard of a new solo strat recently, but I CBA. I don’t care too much about efficiency. I have a 35 kc slayer task.  
---
88 att, 90 str, 87 def, 90 ranged.  
---
If you're only interested in melee training then nazastarool is fine. Most people exclude him because you have to effectively kill three monsters to get nmz points from him which isn't worth it.
---
It's not unlimited dragon arrows. each shot fired uses a revenant ether as a charge whether or not or hits or misses.  
---
dragon arrows are 860 gp each but the ava's devices pick them up for you and the best version, the assembler picks up 80% while only 20% break upon impact meaning an arrow will last on average 5 shots, so a dragon arrow's price is more like a 5th of the GE price, or 172 gp, which is currently slightly cheaper than revenant ethers and also doesn't require you an initial 30m investment.
---
the kendall, king roald, me, traus dayth are all good picks for 1x1 monsters. 
---
Is the dps calculator taking the brimstone ring passive into consideration? If you put a monster like Zilyana in it still says the seer's ring is better.
---
Hey bud. I think ur graphic card doesn't support the opengl. Spec wise may seem fine and play better games. But if u look at the req of version of opengl. Yours may not meet.
---
I had a radeon hd6770 and only when I checked the full specs of it. It doesn't run 4.3 or higher. 
---
well thats why 3rd party clients needs to be perm bannable
---
Goddamn wasn't expecting Stormlight in my runescape subreddit today. 
---
Fuck Moash btw
---
how about no to both warding and sailing, both are shit ideas.
---
Oh, i forgot naza has 3 forms. 
---
Where that alliteration tho
---
With the new accumulators saving 80% of your ammo the ether that the bow uses makes it almost identical in cost to just using dragon arrows.
---
I'm curious what's your in game play time?:) 
---
Well, it was pretty difficult but after hours of training and persistence, after enduring blood, sweat and tears, I can finally say: I jerked off to this.
---
sounds about right for back then
---
Fishing and woodcutting are def the most afkable skills out there just drop your stuff right where u stand. Personally i enjoy fishing
---
I won't beg. Ive set up an authenticater right after I saw that someone stole my stuff. :) 
---
Add a rebalanced warbands
---
To wait for the ability to keep your first skill cape untrimmed and then go for 99rc
---
So much better than ge 
---
That's why I vote no on PVM content because of people like you
---
Yeah I've always just done 4 kill trips even with lance or DHCB so I don't leave drops on the ground.
---
I just said basically the same thing and realized that there are only 3 bows in the game that can use dragon arrows, maybe that is what hes getting at.
---
His goal when he created the account was to max, and he got the necessary gear to do it. He does have zenyte jewelry as well. He even did some raids but he said he didn’t want to do them because his goal is maxing and raids are a waste of time.

I would be suprised if Bitterkoekje made a mistake, I think if he wasn't confident that the equations for the brimstone ring weren't correct he wouldn't have added them. Maybe though.

Exactly! and thank you, i'll be using those.

What if he thought that the person that pm'd was trying to phish his account.

I'm not spite voting anyone, but I will agree that I'm happier that my wilderness expeditions have a higher success rate

It is not at all hard to tell..... I’m not sure if you’re seeing what I’m seeing tho

:(

These were the days..

&gt; It's not unlimited dragon arrows.

[The UNCHARGED Craw's Bow has a +60 ranged strength bonus.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Craw%27s_bow#Uncharged) 
---
[Dragon arrows give +60 ranged strength.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_arrow)
---
The Craw's Bow does not need ammunition to fire similar to the Crystal Bow. Unlike the Crystal Bow, however, Craw's Bow does not degrade.
---
The Wilderness effect you're referring to increases the damage and accuracy of Craw's Bow when it is charged with Revenant Ether. You **DO NOT** need to charge the bow in order to take advantage of it's passive MSB(i) w/dragon arrows effect.
---
This is the osrs experience the game is missing, what would osrs be like now without g.e? I only regret not playing before they added it

Short reply: thanks

Long reply: thank you

training on flesh crawlers in stronghold of security
---
70 defense and attack is needed for barrows gear so id say once you hit 70 in each you could just focus on strength  
---
You know what? I think I have a torso but I forgot all about pest control and void, and I’ve only got half of RfD completed.
---
Sounds like a good list of goals to start with, thanks!
---
you havent even made the series yet and you've already given yourself like a hundred exceptions and workarounds. This does not make for an engaging series, I'd recommend you don't continue with this.
---
Which is the 10% of content I was referring to. The grand majority of the time revolution would work perfectly fine. 
---
Get the easy damage boost items too like assembler and imbued god caps
---
G-maul flipping was my go-to strategy.
---
I dont think you understood my point.
---
Op isnt risking items hes only risking hp. He prolly didnt have wealth and the pker was just looking for an easy kill. I get the wild is risky. I dont have a problem with that. 
---
My problem is qith the pker talking shit after such an easy pk like he was hot shit. Thats what is toxic. Not the wildy itself.
---
The wild is a magical place where adrenaline meets dopamine.
---
There is a decent guide on the [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/General_Graardor/Strategies#Basic%20Tank) you would be trying to follow the basic tank setup

Wait, people actually read quest dialogue? That wasn't part of slayermusiq1's guides..

---
Dragons aren't real and neither are their bones.
---
All I did was flip in w2 fally. My best was selling over the forums for significantly higher than what the going price was in w2. 
---
Combat RPG doesn't exist in real life. 
---
Yeah I agree. I got so bored with the series because it was just "alright we're going to do 50 hours of agility. Alright we're done with 50 hours of agility and btw we got 99 mining lol" it was just mindless safe xp gain until he was maxed
---
I might need some advice from you.
---
I tried doing that with the f2p/telegrab method many years ago and managed to mess it up haha, I was annoyed and was so looking forward to keeping it. On the q&amp;a they have discussed it many times but I am not sure if they are going to offer that due to the previous player base not having tracked their first 99.
---
Safespot with a cbow and diamond bolts, dragon would probably help
---
&gt;You can't get 99 Runecrafting from Tears of Guthix
---
What would you suggest I change to make it more engaging/challenging? Not being able to obtain the IRL items? Legit question.
---
yup its like a second or two faster
---
Can't fool me Michael Jackson
---
Ohh man I need to finish my own fishing God help me 
---
But you never have to restock arrows or worry about ground pick ups with Craw's Bow. 80% arrow recovery is good, not having to worry about arrows at all is better.
---
The forums ruled. I had a post that was essentially a shop. I'd edit it to update what I was currently buying/selling.
---
I was playing the game a lot a few months ago, and then I asked myself this exact question. Why am I doing this? While getting rare drops is fun, the process of doing that, the never ending multiplicative requirements and grinds (skills, quests, diaries, more skills,etc.) , thinking about all that just wore me out and I couldn't think of it as enjoyable. 
---
Logged in back a few days ago to see my entire friends list (148 people) pretty much dead apart from 2-3 people. Wasn't particularly surprised, I think a lot of people play for stretched and then go on a hiatus/burn out. 
---
The addictive hook this game has is real though. Remember people, gaming addiction is a thing (gone through it on a different game), and can mess your life up, but also is easily treatable at your local psychologist. 
---
I do enjoy pking content and stuff like swampletics, but when I do barrows runs it just isn't the same.
---
pls no
---
That's the joke 
---
what do you suggest?
---
I just wish there was a disable option for it. I really enjoyed what I played of my RS3 HCIM but after getting to Priff and seeing everyone with particle effect maelstroms, stupid Naruto run animations, dumb jig idle animations, and everyone and their nan having a huge fuck off dragon following them, I just didn't want to play anymore. Yeah it's all just cosmetic but after a while the playerbase becomes an eyesore. 
---
I'd probably play again if there was something like the hide other players option in Runelite. 
---
Seems to be full of ancient maces these days tbh.
---
Whoops, I was reading the text in the wiki page that says 2.4 per arrow.
---
QC is easier than a large amount of elite reqs also.
---
I’m not sure. It’s pretty likely that it’s a mobile-only feature
---
Yikes. I hope I never get that mindset. You may as well be playing a mindless cookie clicker game if all you care about is seeing a number go up.
---
This changes everything

Not that I know of. Could ask in the runelite discord or github for that option to be added to the menu entry swapper
---
You’re ducked m8*
---
Sucks to suck my guy cause there are a lot more pvmers than pvpers
---
This was how my childhood playing runescape went.
---
No?
---
You're just filling the bow with ether instead of arrows, the new accumulators break all the arrows that they don't save so you aren't picking up anything.
---
Rip you just got that guy hacked

Actually clue scroll rewards roll the moment they're opened not when the clue is received, so you waited til the exact right game tick to open that clue!
---
Does this not when you report a player? I report dicer bots all the time and never see this
---
if you want to insinuate that I just copied your comment, mine came before yours.  
---
I was under the assumption that he was under the mistaken belief that once he bought it, it would have unlimited (and therefore free) ammo.  
---
the "advantage" of the craws bow being able to fire pseudo-dragon arrows is negated by it's high cost.  
---
sure there aren't better alternatives if you specifically want to compare it to things that fire dragon arrows (dbow is worse, 3rd aged and tbow are significantly more expensive), but that piece of knowledge is pointless when only raw dps numbers matter.
---
There was empty space to the right of the entrance INSIDE the city.
---
Quuuerr
---
Is that what it is!?
---
Thanks for proving my point. Telling people to use their brain just because YOU didn't immediately understand the reasoning just sounds stupid.
---
You don’t think he would’ve tried anything else? Lol
---
I would flip whips. I could buy them at around 3.3m and sell em at like 3.5m It took like 20-40 mins of me spamming at a time but it was honest work

Early on I used to hangout where people power mined iron. They'd just drop them since they wanted xp. I just spent hours grabbing their ore and running to a bank. 
---
So lonely, where's your 99 party friends?
---
He's a fucking Jmod dude, he has ways to tell if you're botting. Don't be stupid.
---
check discord
---
Where was the spot we bought GF's at
---
Yea, it's basically an android tablet, just got the same ones at my gym
---
weird how pure clans have been grouping up to fight at the same time every weekend for over a decade and people are still surprised when they see a clan in ge or edgeville
---
If you put in brimstone vs unimbued seers it shows that the brimstone is ever so slightly better. Maybe the effect just sucks?
---
The calculator isn't perfect, but Bitterkoekje puts a lot of work into it I would be surprised if it was off by much.

Theres a cake stall nearby u can thieve for food and it still gives u thieving xp and free food

As a hcim does it take triple time to max than regular account? I stay away from that mode like its cooties but always wonder the intensity of progression
---
My name is now MagnumDick69. Thanks
---
Exactly how i remember it in rs2. Good times
---
That's probably how they got the 100m in the first place. Nobody is proficient enough to grind out that much cash and also dumb enough to fall for one of these scams
---
Good memories. Back in the day, on my 99 Hunter grind, sold red chins there next to the moat. Trade worlds were always a lot of fun to spend time just taking in the atmosphere. 
---
I wonder how long it will take you ti get hydra claw with that rng. 
---
Usually see them at edgeville, mostly posting for the conga 😂 
---
Honestly if you can miss the money just pay 11$/month for a pure. If you don't want to aim for zulrah/vork for active money and get 72/75 slayer to afk wyverns or gargs, respectively. 
---
Once you get 90 ish combat stats and some decent gear rune dragons become insane semi-afk gp to do while training your pking account. 
---
Did I miss the spot for barrows, it used to be where the fury section is in original w2 also whips were traded there too.
---
Just imagine right, in about a year or so, when you have done a whole lot of the map and you can share the world.
---
I would pay for a map like that in Minecraft. 
---
explain for pleb, what is suicide botting?
---
Yo, can I have my 20m back? It's Michael
---
Go for 80 - 85 combats to make good money at gorillas, shouldn't take very long and it's a huge improvement 
---
Immeasurably high iq move 
---
Yea I mean as a kid I had more time to stand around and and trade, but I don't think I ever encountered or was ripped off by a bot in the bank. I see WAAAYYY more bots now than I ever had back then, it's kind of depressing lol
---
This could have been a good meme but you failed
---
that's incorrect, I posted a video in the comment chain above.
---
Yes i bought 12b. Checks out
---
Friendship ended with Joel from Skype
---
Now its Michael on Discord
---
i saw ur mining xp get ready to ddos'd
---
obtains tho

It's worth fetching if you're an Ironman and want the uniques
---
cant you kill zombies below entrana for a bronze axe?
---
Anyone got the numbers for allotment patch yields? Just looking for the averages of various crops with magic secutars and various composts.
---
Thanks!
---
I’m out of the loop and haven’t played in a few years. Whats the GE update?
---
Right so nothing can ever give content that “devalues” it even a little. With that kind of logic the game should just stop being updated
---
Me trying to solve captchas
---
You're telling me Jegex_Twat isn't going to make me a pmod and give me double xp?
---
Average players can't afford to fletch darts to 99 and most players prefer the more afk bow stringing method. Plus it can be very useful for ironmen to fletch because more points = more rewards = more useful supplies for the account that don't have to be grinded through other more tedious methods.
---
Never is a bit of a stretch
---
Basically bots used to be sorta complex with ways of avoiding bans, but that's effort. Nowadays most farm bots you see are just throwaway accounts that gather, trade to another account every so often and just get banned the moment they're spotted. Main issue there is that it's not even gold selling sites doing it, it's done by actual players simply to make GP on the side.
---
I always afk osrs while playing CS:GO
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Agreed, except that if he wants to go very afk at the expense of xp rates normal is pretty worth it. By very afk I mean 10-20+ minutes of not touching your PC at all. If you're only gone for a few minutes yeah I agree completely.
---
You suck Vio
---
Can't seem to find an angle to flinch Ankous. Probably going to be the hardest thing to do.
---
The entire game is a grind tho and some people enjoy mindless grinding. It's like vanilla WoW is so popular it's a mindless grind most of the time.
---
True
---
You are getting wooshed congratulations.
---
People that freak out like that typically hop in under 5 minutes of you not leaving.
---
I've played since 2005 f2p but banks especially Varrock West Bank and the field to the east of the West Bank we're the most popular trading spots I remember.  I remember learning to google what price I should be paying for something, I think adding the grand exchange actually took a lot away from the RuneScape.
---
Just realising this but bots must really saturate the playercount
---
Am I the only one who just used the trade forums for everything? Trying to get into trade worlds and then get noticed was a nightmare. 
---
You're literally playing RS and that's the main aspect of the game lmao
---
they've got better things to do with dev time than cater towards slayer and ironmeme content.
---
Running up the right side stairs to top bank is faster than running to the basement chest. Being an afk fuck that cant click stairs doesnt make it slower. 
---
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. 
---
 Nice blanket statement, you’d actually  be surprised. 
---
Stop right there, criminal scum! Nobody breaks rng on my watch!
---
Hand over your ill gotten gains to the druids in Taverley and pay your fine!
---
That is some insane luck, have fun with what you are going to buy with it. :)
---
You actually burn more karambwan cooking there than normal ranges when tick cooking
---

I remember those days. north and west of the western varrock bank was the good shit (santa hats, phats, trimmed rune armor). while the east and inside was for the plebs.

I'm pretty sure they'll be able to tell if I log out of Runescape using a computer in Buttfuck Kansas and then suddenly log in 2 minutes later using a computer in Ratfuck China.
---
Wow that’s some good luck bro. Yeah I’ll get it soon an I think I deserve an axe too ;p

It’s actually $3.92, closer to $4. If you’re making minimum wage in Poland, you’re not able to afford electric and internet, you’re going to be scraping for food and necessities. And $2 an hour over the minimum is not **insane**
---
I'd buy daggers for 30k from fairies and buy super poison for 15k from players. Then put them together and sell dds for 60k in Seers bank.
---
You're awesome man! Have a great day
---
Not only was this 3 days ago, but you’re assumption is false. Let it go snowflake 
---
Because, as we all know, jmods never jump to conclusions. Jagex, after all, has primo bot detection.
---
Yeah, it hurts to watch a 3k prayer pot stack dwindle away into nothing.
---

Ik but whether a meme is years old or months old I start to hate both of them. Old is old. A circlejerk is a circlejerk. I think the more annoying part is the “runecraft bad” thing isn’t even creative or funny. It’s just trying to make fun of the sub in a Meta way. Which I mean was kinda funny the first couple times I saw it. But when people keep repeating it with no variation in timing or content it gets extremely stale.
---
Well he started this account right after maxing his normal account. The dude is a grinding machine...
---
Yeah, but you can easily make more than minimal wage per hour. That's what I tried to prove.

Nice, I got mine from my first clue on my ironman

On KC 66 I got Prims.. on KC 77 I got the pet lol
---
The best thing to happen to rs knowledge since mod Ash's Twitter.
---
Ya it's not the best ever, but still manageable. 
---
why answer
---
Im colourblind which makes it difficult to distinguish between many items at a glance. In raids all my shit ends up everywhere in my inv because I havent spent 16 hours a day doing raids since its release.
---
Understand now?
---
I'm maxing.. I want those Ironman only capes that was suggested... Should have just enough time to get maxed before they actually get released. 
---
I miss Classic era when skirts went to the ground. They actually looked kinda sick with the full kit.
---
thanks, would full void or red dhide be better for ranged?
---
ash already talked about this in a live stream once, it would require every single account in the game cycling code over and over checking every single account name just incase they are banned, its too much work.
---
most people fletch for phoenix

How much exp is this?
---
I did astral runes and just did 100k xp a day, so I didn't hate myself for it.
---
I wanted to actually make money from RC. At the time I did it Wraths didn't exist, and the quest cape and fairy rings weren't buffed yet so astrals were better money and xp than Natures
---
idk maybe people didn't know it was more points
---
where are yall gettin these rates from?
---
895 kc here 5 pegs 2 eternal 1 prim no pet or jar of souls but I just got 93 slayer and got smoke devil pet at 76 kc so I can’t complain sorry about your horrible rng hope it turns around 
---
I had made my first 10 mil merching dragon med helms and bowstrings.  I miss merching. Damn the ge. 
---
675 is too clean, its always like 348 or something
---
100% get 43 prayer. That’s a necessity for the game in general. Questing is also a great way to get stats up early game. So definitely start questing ASAP. Your melee stats are fine at the moment. 
---
Monkey madness is not only a great quest and super fun but also the benefit from the scim is worth it to 70 base melees. Even after 70 most Ironman accounts will use a dragon scim until 90 base combats. 
---

I feel that at 2k total

Nope. They're still very fast xp though.

Soon enough, we’ll relieve Ash of having to look up drop rates for people, and he’ll just refer them to the Wiki!
---
There's a plugin on runelite that reports your drop data to the wiki. Don't remember where it is off the top of my head
---
Huh, didn't know pmods can too. Thanks.
---
bukkake party time
---
It’s not really a problem in the sense of being a bug. iOS devices just won’t let the app run and remain connected in the background for long. Generally I can swap apps for like 15 seconds before I get kicked to login.
---
That being said I have a the new generation of standard iPad and it runs OSRS just fine. Hours and hours if I reduce to 15fps.
---
=w=;
---
Awww :)
---
These are sourced from 50 million kills worth of anonymous RuneLite drop logs.
---
you grossly overestimate the intelligence of the devs...
---
I think once a week is fine.
---
That's a 100% drop, since Sire is a single parent.
---
Hello guys,
---
My account was banned a few months ago for botting, which I don't deny doing. I only had the one account, and I was pretty bummed to have it banned. In hindsight botting was a stupid idea, which I regret doing. I haven't played since then, for I don't see myself starting over and putting all of that time back into a new character (especially re-doing quests). My question is this: is there any way for me to get my account un-banned? I wasn't doing anything that gave me an unfair advantage over my fellow 'scaper or trying to make any money off of my account. I'd just like to be able to play again without having to start over (which I don't think I'd be willing to do). It goes without mentioning that I won't ever bot again.
---
Thanks,
---
Alazurin
---
neat
---
So they can add CEngineer's hcim and go PK him for the cash?
---
I pay them, but it's your call
---
64 here, fruit patch in catherby
---
More points
---
You can pay with noted stuff.
---
I mostly end up just using compost myself unless the payment is real cheap; it's just way less annoying and you can resurrect dead crops a lot of the time anyway.
---
Where was this announced?
---
That’s rough! I just got Torag’s plate on chest 7. My pace is about a chest every 30 mins cause I’m using shades or Morton tele but hey slow and steady haha 
---
Literally *literally* unplayable
---
That's like saying mining with a D pick you didn't get as a drop makes it a buyable 
---
Is this guy a retard?
---
You can't.
---
Ah the ol whooshed whoosher
---
Can Superior monsters from "Bigger and Badder" show up when I'm killing versions in the Catacombs of Kourend?
---
Like can Vitreous Jelly show up when I'm killing Warped Jellies?
---
Exactly. It's even better is your name doesn't show that you're an iron (FE, Iron) and just say nothing, let them flame and they probably aren't smart enough to look through the rage to see you are one and assume you aren't.
---
That’s rough! I just got Torag’s plate on chest 7. My pace is about a chest every 30 mins cause I’m using Shades of Morton tele but hey slow and steady haha

How so?

Unfortunately, you get a !message saying you would have been followed, you don't get a second :(

You can put a fairy ring in your house, you can't put a nieve shrine anywhere.

Why it should lol

this will do....

Wanna trade anyway

Sand Casino :D
---
Quality content from the sub 
---
I wonder if it was a cover to real world trade. “OMG a hacker took my account and sold all my gold!! Jam flex please give back!”
---
Meanwhile the hacker was a friend who sold the gold and gave the money to OP. Therefore, OP real world traded with no repercussions.
---
you could have all the romantic life in the world and all the personal accomplishments however without getting in touch with the ultimate source that will never bring true fulfillment. Identifying with temporary goals, accomplishments, romantic life, etc will never get you there whether its real or virtual. you aren't supposed to use accomplishments as a measure of your self worth. THATS what causes depression not the behaviors themselves.
---
Yea
---
I'm a professional transcriptionist because of RuneScape, I type close to 100wpm because of it. I get to play osrs in my downtime too :)
---
Sadly no...
---
Cool, another militant duck feminist on reddit...drakes are ducks too, despite your experiences with them
---
why you gotta do this
---
Are you compiling average kill rates per hour? This could be so good for gp/hr averages on every monster. Very excited either way 
---
How much time would a dragon pick save me from 63-72 mining?
---
The only RNG is the CoX layout, which you can scout, and if you don’t like the layout for fear of death as a HCIM you could just leave? Skilling and prepping is no excuse for a safe death, if you don’t manage to get enough potions just leave. You can also solo the raid efficiently unlike ToB, so no fault of your teammates. 
---
wonder what the rates are like and if its worth the grind for swapping.
---
*This is a Swampletics approved big brain play*
---
Upvoting for just the sheer work into finding an oversight from the rs1 to rs2 update. God damn respect my main. 
---
Are you actually stupid or what? 
---
How do you download play store apps?
---
damn thats awesome haha. All i can do at work is cannon balls and sand crabs everything else seems too click intensive 
---
I don't mind seeing it as much as the glory hole one because this one at least gets me in the mood to crank one out u know
---
Boo
---
We use the same machines at my gym. Village?
---
No clue why people have to be such jerks - on the flip side though, I love when people are polite about it! I misclicked and mined the same ore vein as some other dude, so I clicked off it and said "oops sorry". His response was "no problem dude, I'm pretty sure you were here first anyway!" I was pleasantly surprised and we ended up chatting for a while afterwards.
---
In the entire grind of void n elite void on vet boat only i think i got priority level 2 once
---
Because it would be 0 gp/hp
---
Correct, forgot that jagex thought adding drakes to duradel table was a good idea.
---
Rake lot, compost, plant stuff, it grows, you harvest it when it's done and repeat
---
So many cheese capes 
---
NEEEEEEEEEEEINNNNNN??????
---
r/suddenlygay
---
You used to be able to bring an axe head and other half of the item and attach them.
---
I can't tell you if it works on CC
---
The way it works is it takes a line and if that line corresponds with something in a chat message they filter out the complete message.
---
so if someone goes: "Selling Fire cape &amp; accounts with twisted bows" then you won't see that message. Or if someone puts "11:15:06" it filters that out too.
---
I got the filter input from the runelite changelog
---
https://runelite.net/blog/show/2019-03-21-1.5.17-Release/
---
Oh, that update was in rs3 some months ago, so I was thinking does osrs have it too.
---
Thx.
---
 haven't done any clues in my osrs acc.
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be.
---
Isn't mandatory to post a first fire cape on Reddit? I'm just following the rules.
---
Thanks for letting me know. Although I don't want to doubt Mod Ash, it seems that there are many other possible solutions for this. You don't need to cycle over and over again? Isn't it as easy as once an account is banned remove it from the ignore list, just like they do with highscores? No need to check accounts over and over again, just a one time function when someone gets banned?
---
nmz was the best thing that happened to me during my grind to base 80s, no more toxic sand crab people
---
That's it? I'm really just over thinking it?
---
I don't have to pay the farmers to watch over it? What's the pros of paying the farmers? Cons?
---
For slash, yes.
---
Hahaha must feel good to swear on a keyboard when Mom's not watching, right kid? Thanks for the ''helpful'' answer! Don't play past your bedtime tonight!
---
Seems incredibly tough to pull out of the drop data.
---
However, once they have a pretty reliable expected value per kill it might be possible for runelite to tell you your expected gp/hour based on how many you're killing per hour.
---
Lmao? So u prefer a boring shit boss like vorkath over raids... smh
---
Props to the devs for working with that, I imagine 90 percent of their work is refactoring. 
---
He’s obv just shit at the game and is scared ppl will laugh at hin

---
i remember buying a bgs for 52m lol!
---
Oh yeah that sounds like the ideal way to do it. Hopefully someone can pull that together for runelite one the wiki is finished. I’d find it interesting to see how quick some random monsters can make money for any level of player. 
---
Someone was talking about pmods and this was around the time that "Nerf Olm" was all over this sub for saying it in game, and I referenced it. 
---
It's shelved in rs3, but I have no idea about osrs.
---
Rake patches three time to be able to plant seeds. You can use compost on them to decrease chance they become diseased and die, while also increasing the yield of the patch. Each type of patch such as herb, allotment, flower, tree, fruit tree, etc. have set lengths of time until they become harvestable. Herbs and allotments are about an hour to fully grow, while trees take 6hr, fruit tree take 16hrs, and so on. Trees are your go to when training farming as they are the most efficient exp/hr. This includes fruit trees, hardwood trees, spirit trees, celastrus tree, and calquat trees,

I wish they had a game mode where you could play the game without being able to use the GE but still be able to trade with people in the same game mode. I miss pre GE trading. It used to be an activity.

I've gotta ask, and this is purely out of curiosity but, do you ever jerk off to your own artwork? As a musician, when I compose something, I listen to it over and over for a couple days. I love it even more than other music because it has the added bonus of being created by me.
---
So that's why I ask the question, because if I created a big tiddy anime girl, fuck other hentai I'm jerking off to my own shit.
---
I don't know the exact numbers, but there is no reason not to buy it, use it then sell it again

You can just show people your bank you know, instead of asking for ironmen to have easier-to-complete collection logs than other accounts
---
Lol. NOt trying to be mean. I just see a lot of people brushing off sand casino gambling as "its just GP". But the reality is they are gambling with coins worth thousands or tens of thousands of dollars and use that excuse to minimize the negative repercussions of losing.
---
Thanks a lot! I'll try not to disappoint you!
---
I had no idea there was designated places as a young teen. I just stood at the front of whatever bank it was i was at and spammed away.

ALL IRONS FTW
---
Talking about dura
---
yea, its crazy how non of this doubling/dicing/etc wasn't a thing back then (pre-ge days). All of these people would be drowned out in the messages of people trading. 
---
Trade me your fury and see what happens
---
Oh fuck Thank god 
---
As long as a pattern in what I gave you shows up in their message it gets filtered out.
---
BUT you have to select "Remove message" in the Chat Filter options from runelite. You can also just censor that part of the text but that's kinda pointless.
---
And post the filter text I gave you into the Regex field

restrict yourself to mortytania

Hi there! The aim for these non-commentary videos is to give newer players a quick guide that can help them out in the OSRS world. I try to keep them as short as possible, but with enough detail to not make them feel confused.

All feedback is greatly appreciated! :)

---
Have you got fairy rings? Fairy ring BKR, a little bit South East of the fairy ring is a boat that takes you to the little bridge you cross to get to barrows (don't need to do any quests to use it) then when you loot the chest ring of dueling to clan wars, go into the portal, ardy Cape to monastery, head to the fairy ring and repeat.
---
Well 5 minutes still better than nothing. Wdym by prayer setup?
---
Attack speed is king in almost all osrs scenarios and scims have higher speed than longswords (and higher str bonus than swords with equal speed)
---
Nah yeah I knew you weren't haha.
---
And yeah you're right it's a lot of money. And the it's just gp excuse isn't always great. But Atleast for me when I stake, I know I will most likely lose out on a lot each time, and I'm ok with that but that generally because I have no other intentions with the gp. So it usually doesn't matter. Unless I tilt then that never ends well.

i got scammed like this, bought a pile of unids for like 600 ea and thought i was about to make bank but they were all low tier herbs that nobody would buy :(

Incels, is just an insult for involuntary celibates, and there are a lot of people who fit that description from 4chan and 8chan who play our game. 
---
Tell you what mate
---
I meeded those for a clue the other day and had to run all the way tp the graveyard. Sigh. At least desert treasure is happening soon on my acc. 
---
The clothes do not match the lore nor the theme of the quest. Why purple? Just cause it's a purple staff?
---
She ain’t wrong. Facts right there.
---
Why are people down voting this guy for asking a simple question?
---
That’s the weebs mating call
---
Just don't sic Mr. Buttpiss on me

Event RPG is the name you're looking for.

Is that Gavin Mcinnes!? 😂
---
Haha no way u are doing 40 a trip lmao get outta here
---
Can Rs still be played on laptop. And will all my Items be lost And levs be gone .. or Am I good??

By using a max [prayer bonus](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Armour/Prayer_armour), or at least one that allows you to keep melee prayer and piety up for 5 mins without having to drink a potion, while also maxing your str bonus.
---
You pray melee and/or piety, and drink overload every 5 minutes
---
General store buy price is low alch price
---
Specific store price (item is usually in stock) is high alch price
---
slayer is amazing money at higher levels
---
I haven't played for 8 yrs..
---
Gotcha, thank you!
---
Sports rite guys
---
Haha. Maybe it's because I'm used to piano lessons from when I was a kid, but repeatedly pressing my 5 key to get the left click on the Prayer orb for 1-ticking isn't too bad for me. I just find 3-ticking (Mining, Fishing, etc.) really tedious since it involves a lot of clicks :/
---
One day I will learn it! Yea the reason I prefer 1-ticking combat is because it conserves a lot of food and prayer potions. I only bring them to Jad tasks now. But this also means my Fishing has lagged behind, since I haven't had a reason to train it D:
---
Ahh I wasn’t aware my bad.
---
Fishing/cooking karambwan could be good. Not much combat oriented stuff will get you 750/hr. I’d look at doing afk stuff while playing another account. Or have another account do some afk money makers while doing slayer on your main. Mix it up, but two account helps negate the boring aspects of the grind.
---
True, he's still a bitch though lol
---
When does this start? I wanna get In on this swappage 
---
It's all made up lol. There was no 'Second evolution of combat'

This can be toggled as seen [in this gif](https://i.imgur.com/BeROpty.gifv).

y not

Get to the copper head ass

Used this to 99 and have a few friends that can vouch for it too
---
After you do that, make sure to come back here and post a thread about a supa hacka is the only way you could have lost your account /s

What's your cash stack looking like Atm ?    Since your combat level is quite low you might try for a risky method such as revenants you have a decent enough range level for the lower level monsters there and chance your arm for an emblem drop 
---
But then he'll have to spend at least a few hours calming himself down from that 3:59 hour session of hyping himself up.
---
54m is sadly not even on rate for pet if you do tree runs. I’m ~70m dry and I don’t think I’m on rate yet either. Gl on tangleroot :)
---
I like risks.
---
Hey that’s funny - MICHAEL!
---
No but serious why, what are your goals? 
---
Are you planning on doing more of the map than Varrock?
---
You heard the man, /u/JagexAsh. Let's get this poll going.
---
Varrock today, the world tomorrow

Slayer, Slayer, and Slayer.

Why did I read Specimen as Spiceman.

Yes, there’s a discord where we’re gonna collectively work on it

Because Settled has already won.

Yes it will work at Kril 
---
Nope
---
Pretty sure one of the old stronghold of security messages actually says that jagex only users the message centre to contact players.
---
Im not sure if I can trust this. I mean you did lie to them about being Michael.
---
I miss these days. Was so much harder to buy and sell things but prices were so much more stable because of it.
---
Bloody GE destroyed prices with its ease of use. 
---
The longer you go the more likely you are to hit that 10-loss streak. Eventually you will hit it and lose everything. It is a bad idea.
---
A better more reliable way is to find someone poorer than you and just stake them repeatedly. They can't afford to lose as much as you and eventually they will end up cleaned. This is basically how the duel arena mafias work and how they clean streamers, unless the streamer is retardedly rich or they know the streamer can get big loans, because they do the same thing.
---
Basically, you're still poor and should stay away from the duel arena.

promptly calls him a retard
---
Well people are definitely checking now you posted on Reddit, c u later bb.
---
pfft long time nice agility level
---
You could say ‘into something else’, or you could say ‘somewhere else’. To say ‘into somewhere else’ is bad English.

TLDR; Shouldn’t throw stones if you live in a glass house.

The discord invite is invalid for me :(
---
No, that's not correct. JMods can pm even if you put them on ignore. PMods cannot PM if you put them on ignore. Funny story, I actually ignored Mod Craddock on FunOrb once, and he sent a snarky response back lol.
---
The other person claimed they were “unreliable” though, which is my point, so by your logic they’re incorrect too. 
---
Except, there is legitimate evidence that they ban tens of thousands of players per their claim. You can easily just add bots that you see in-game and you’ll notice them eventually get banned. 
---
Karamja is so much easier than the other diaries though.  Like compare karamja medium to kandarin medium.
---
Just so you know, and I'm not sure if you were implying this, you can't lose your streak. You can cancel tasks and get tasks from other slayer masters and the streak will continue.
---
Why was everyone there? Did they just all happen to search for digsite amulet at the same time?
---
Never said I wasn't one
---
Bots will typically move around. So if some dude is just walking around while doing whatever and not responding to a jmod pm, he's most likely botting. 
---
Where do people go for middlemen to facilitate the swap, if at all? Also what’s the best way to make some money on DMM for someone who hasn’t tried it before? Lol
---
Dude this isn't anything new. For damn near everything that has both a free and a paid version, the paid provides perks. Its how it is and always will be idk why your so offended by this. 
---
I wouldn't say lazy, I'd say cheap ass. I want to spend less on house teleports and redirect scrolls by using the spirit tree instead. This route would probably take longer to run than house tele.
---
This map is a very large part of the reason that I type 160wpm.
---
Because people over exaggerate. If you spent 2 hours to buy a set of rune it's cause you're a cheap fuck
---
ITS MICHAEL FROM DISCORD

Im in. I currently have a working redstone puzzle for the earnest the chicken room in draynor manor basement i can bring to the table come time. Ill be joining the discord.

Was someone else using that account the whole time? And had recovered it back? 
---
Slayer for a long-term investment. You don't really start making money from Slayer until 70+.
---
Farming is good since you can do herb runs for safe profit. Most people will advise that you do ranarrs but avantoe is more consistent profit at lower farming levels since you usually end up breaking even or losing money on ranarrs below 75ish farming.
---
At 75 hunter you already have access to black chinchompas which are super good profit provided that you don't get PK'd. Red chinchompas are a safer alternative if you don't like going into the wildy
---
I personally would not recommend Barrows as a moneymaker until after you finish the mory hard diary
---
well rune lite could have a dps calculator in it fairly easily 
---
I love raids, probably my favorite content in the game. I enjoy duo/trio/4man etc. However I started learning solos recently and the feel is 100% different. They are mad fun. I'd suggest giving them a try. Suiciding to olm while learning is annoyingish but well worth it when you get it down.
---
Tbf, scammers, bots and the like still existed in the trading banks back un the day.
---
I think i used the wrong word lmao, i meant adding a herb to water
---
and then they gave the account back to the guy again lol
---
But if you do your fruit tree first then run there takes same amount of time 
---
Not a matter of belief, there are industries where there is a gap in pay between genders for the same position.
---
Facts do not care about your feelings.
---
No. Password was same. Never changed. And when i was making sure I still had access i logged into rs3 mobile just because i was curious of where i left it and it hadn't logged in, in a very long time. Dont remember exact day amount. 
---
True but I generally only plant the two trees in the stronghold
---
my ign is just my mains with a space in it. There's no clue :D

It's not a spoiler, it's a warning.

Looks like I was the wooshed I didn't see the "2nd" part of EoC. Guess I've been memed. 
---
The delay for enabling 1 click drop is server confirmation I think. It's not a client side button so Im pretty sure they can't change the delay on that.

 you've been here for a year

With no thought about cost, you can use this gear:
---
\- Ghrazi rapier
---
\- avernic defender
---
\- bandos chestplate
---
\-bandos tassets
---
\- dragon boots
---
\- berserker ring (i)
---
\- barrows gloves
---
\- amulet of torture
---
\- serpentine helm (costs scales)
---
\- fire cape
---
I would insult you, but I see you’re active on the RS3 subreddit, I’m sorry you are disabled 😢
---
Primordials and a torso or  Torags chest
---
That’s look really nice! Do you plan on expanding?
---
Ddosing with ice barrage is the new meta apparently

Its drops were either resource dumps or things that were used to skill and create alchables
