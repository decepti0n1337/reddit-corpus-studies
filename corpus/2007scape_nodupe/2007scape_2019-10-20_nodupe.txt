well thats to mutch leaked infortmation gl with that acc sit pls
---
---
---
thats gotta be it cuz i dont remember doing that, thought i remembered reading that i just needed to finish the quest. thanks
---
Just avoid confrontation at all cost. If someone does choose to fight you go all in don't run. Focus more on trying to out last them. Leave auto retaliate on and focus on prayer switches and eating. Slowly work in attacking then back after eating. Then slowly work in switching from melee to range when he switched his gear and prayer flicks. If you can deal damage to them they'll have to eat and do less damage to you. 
---

---
If you can make it to the top 3 you get points if I remember correctly. I don't think there is a good method besides waiting until it's late at night when mostly only bots play
---
Tbh I'd rather have cosmetics than nothing and this is the only thing people might vote in
---
How are they scumbags for participating in content they enjoy.
---
So, I can spend at least a few hours making my place presentable, manscaping, and probably a date or two, for 2 minutes of sex which will be great (for me at least), or I can spend all that time enjoying myself playing OSRS, and not have to pay for drinks. 
---
Also that's not even factoring in that she would probably want to sleep here. That's an entire night and morning of wasted xp. I could probably get an entire RC level in that time.
---
What skill is in that 50-60 lvl range? If it's combat, you could kill chaos druids or safespot blue dragons. 
---
Training cooking/fletching/runecrafting is profitable from any level as well
---
is there footage of this ordeal because wtf imagine shitting yourself over pixels in a kids medieval gardening simulator
---
it massively hurt rs3 when they started changing iconic game items and this could be equally as hurtful
---
Haha not me this was in r/all 
---
I spend time watching others get laid instead
---
Lmao
---
fuuuck bruh
---
Yeah no prob. It‚Äôs in the room past the rune and addy dragons. It‚Äôs like a ‚Äústrange machine‚Äù or some shit like that
---
To "splash" is to fail to do damage with a spell. Some people will purposefully get REALLY low magic accuracy so that they constantly splash, and autocast a cheap spell on something weak.
---
You get some magic xp for splashing and because you're in combat (so you don't autolog as fast) and neither of you really do damage, it's VERY afk mage xp.
---
Toxic Blowpipe. It's extremely useful in many, many scenarios. But it also can be relatively expensive to use. 160gp a shot in scales or something like that.
---
What‚Äôs the point of changing them. Fine as they are
---
Just make a toggle-able runelite feature and everyone is happy
---
I don't PvP either, and I'm not interested in it because I'm pretty bad at it and a sore loser, but I don't like the idea of PvP stuff not getting polled if it still affects me, for instance when I would engage in wildy activities. I don't want PKers to have an easier time killing me when I do black chins or venenatis, so it's only natural I would vote against PvP weapons is it not?
---
Unfortunately it has been posted every few months since mobile launched.
---
I am upset you would slander gentle mod Ash like this.
---
This thread needs more attention just for this comment.
---
No, you can cure plant on lunar spellbook though
---
yeah, i just find it interesting that people think broad bolts are sometimes better dps. Usually the comparisons use broad bolts since they're so cheap
---
our player is a psychopath who manipulates, steals, lies, kills, and will sit for days on end chopping down a tree for fun
---
Toxic blowpipe is probably the best ranged weapon in the game and "only" costs about 4m, but the ammo is expensive. It's probably your next major upgrade for a ranged weapon.
---
Its fat, it will spread the pressure evenly all over his body and probably even on the floor.
---
Is there any precautions I should know about when it comes using Runelite? As far as I can tell it‚Äôs safe to use but maybe there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not thinking about that I need to watch out for?
---
I haven't changed my password in atleast 12 years and I use the same one everywhere pretty much.. never been hacked.
---
whts the point of splashing if youre already 99 magic tho?
---
morbidly interested, can you link me?
---
I like it
---
&gt; I was also afk barbarian fishing and would switch clients to drop fish
---
but why switch clients just to drop fish? this is odd as hell.
---
Well a lot of us quit because of EOC. Partly because we didn't recognise anything in our banks, amongst the more obvious reasons.
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about getting all the achievements done. I had quest cape. Just been afk fishing forever. Got 96 yesterday
---
Pair of hockey globes
---
[removed]
---
Great to hear :D
---
every day is Archie's birthday, you silly goose
---
Maybe I worded it weird, I had 2 RuneLite apps open and would stop agility on the one to drop fish on the other.
---
Change all except d boots
---
assuming the pker is in a group they could probably cash it in right away
---
I mean I didn‚Äôt quit for only that reason but I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt change the overall vibe of the game for me.
---
Also, Steven 5D0C is black.
---
Lucky bastard.
---
Told yall it's been like that since release lol
---
Do not change the D boots!!
---
Just got this done today too, childhood goals achieved. Nice job!
---
I think he was advocating for DPS with the cbow and frugality with the broads.
---
This is shit advice. You would only need to change your password if you use the same one on a website that was compromised. You should have different passwords for everything.
---
This is the osrs I wanted

I can multitask now that mobile is outüî•ü§ôüèΩüòú

Jagex: Your account is actually still our property and if you fuck it up, you're gonna lose the right to pay us $11 to use it.

I chill in 'Only trails' cc. Hes a smaller osrs YTer and the cc is super welcoming, we'd love to have you join.
---
Ill pay you back immediately, i get that its alot of trust in just a random stranger but im not here to take money i just want to play the game with mems
---
You need jesus
---
I‚Äôm not sure I get a vote but aye
---
Bots devalue skilling, that‚Äôs why SlayerScape is such a big deal. 3m/hr at Vorkath requiring base 80 combats or 1.5m/hr crafting Wrath runes at 95 RC. Which sounds more attractive?
---
I'd say the odds are better that you downloaded runelite off one of the numerous fake sites.
---
I figured id give it a shot, cant really hurt to try
---
I never understood how people could use a sock for that, like, isn't that shit rough?
---
Toxic because I was called petty for not liking the changes in the art style? Blow me.
---
You too eh?
---
Also Falador? And farming guild
---
We all like it, but we all know it wont pass the pool because then "the game wont be old school".
---
You‚Äôre right, this is an unpopular opinion... and a bad one.
---
Did you censor your name in chat but then not sensor it on the bottoms left?
---
Repost #372. Congratulations you're dumber than the 371 reposters before you.
---
Good to hear, was gonna say also the full melee setup should have some thick armor too for melee attacks
---
It's not Settled levels of Dopamine but it's still lovely! :)
---
I‚Äôm doing chompos right now at 90 range in elite void and half the time it still takes 3-4 shots. Rip me.
---
He‚Äôs number 2
---
Really??
---
advice: find somewhere else to make money. revs is probably the biggest pk hotspot rn and no matter what you're wearing you will be targeted because you might have phat rev lewtz.
---
I'm game for it. Itll hurt my nostalgia a little bit but at least itll be easier to see everything in my bank/inventory. As long as the models on character stay the same I'm good
---
The way the game looked made it so it was no longer fun to me. It was no longer the game I enjoyed playing. How does that make me petty? You're daft.
---
.... dont tell him guys
---
I live in Florida. I've never seen a basement, either. We can't have them here.
---
Aah. The wiki says 2013 I didn't realize that was when they came out on old school, not rs2.
---
I quit playing in 04 back in the day anyway lol
---
I‚Äôll help u

I think they mean penis

not so sure this is original

Joke's on you I haven't played in over a year.

I just come to this sub sometimes because the memes and community are funny af.

.....but I still never get laid.
---
Yeah how fucking petty, he chose to spend his time on something he enjoyed instead of being forced to play something!
---
Thanks I will re-evaluate my life decisions now
---
If an account recovery is denied it means there's insufficient information to determine that you are the original owner. If I remember right, I think they'll send you suggestions of what information will help.

it means blowjob

I mean, just don‚Äôt shit your pants for a video game
---
Progression is slowing at mid 20s? I got some bad news for you man
---
Oh, where is "Top" common? I have not heard that before
---
I made this Reddit account long before getting hacked and it is in no way a reference to getting hacked.
---
No
---
I was cool with the HD because you could turn it off, but maybe I‚Äôm just remembering wrong. 
---
The Evolution of Combat update is when RS2 became unrecognizable.
---
as long as it uses charges 1:1 and consumes jewelry there's really no downside to this that i can think of.
---
That‚Äôs dope
---
The parrot?
---
Nice jad pet
---
I feel for ya, but it's super shady and I feel like most people should be smart enough to liquidate before their mems runs out
---
Why use dclaws when white claws exist in the game?
---
This is some phenomenal work dawg keep up the good work
---
No I get it mate. You do you. I know you understand no one's going to believe you.
---
proof?
---
It was against a custom npc with zero defence. Against gargoyles, the extra accuracy of abby dagger makes it better by about 5% dps
---
Whats your IGN bro? I just started 2 weeks ago and am always looking for friends to play with.
---
If it was Mod Husky he would talk over someone because he heard one word he understand and therefor we need to hear his opinion.
---
you say that like you know it for a fact, but you dont
---
the fact is jagex said that its a bad look, especially in f2p where literally every rat was taken. thats the reason
---
Don‚Äôt poo poo OP bad boi
---
If you can wear barrows your def aint that low.  Realistically, slayer involves a lot of prayer or safe spotting with range.
---
Idk I haven't seen poll results yet
---
Other people dislike it? The fools...
---
You don't get the point? 
---
You must be kinda slow, let me explain.
---
The drop is 1/1500 chance, I got it on my 23rd try. 
---
The title is in reference to the trump/Kanye tweet (thank you Kanye, very cool!) So, unless you live under a rock you should see this post isn't because my mind is fucking blown over a d-pick, rather it was a nice random but of RNG. 
---
tl:dr 
---
You aren't very bright, I got lucky.
---
people downvote for much less
---
its just a click of a button, and really holds no value.
---
No the NPC will despawn after a secound
---
...looks like you got hacked. Did ya lig into a fishing site?
---
sick meme
---
Exactly how I feel
---
I made an RSMV in 2010 and it has over 1,100 views so I definitely qualify for an interview :)
---
I mean, it makes sense so why not
---
I still have some quests to do even after all these years. I guess we take my time :)
---
Try a credit card
---
I know I'll catch some hate, but imo, the way to retain the maximum sanity without spending IRL money is probably crafting gold necklaces or rings to like 80 crafting.
---
AFK as fuck, this is like f2p cannonballs.
---
Fucking EZ scape
---
Back in my days we had to hurt our eyes looking at some sprites
---
Yeah this was so much worse for me.
---
I still fucks with it üëå
---
Aww what a shame. Imagine the cheese that could happen...
---
yeah homie
---
Attack on titan vibe
---
That's insane, congrats!
---
Yikes sounds like I'd instantly die in a member's world, thanks for sharing your experience :P
---
Torso takes 2 hours with a good team and 4 hours with a shitty one
---
Well done!
---
I think they go down into the mm2 tunnels and get the agro of the monkeys and move them for you so you can just sit there and non stop barrage them
---
Correct I actually started the whole partner slayer vibe back 3 years ago when I was a nobody lol, but his version is pretty detailed beyond that.
---
This is incredible
---
no there was the "HD" update(720p) and the whole style shift that happened.
---
you couldnt go between them, and if they did that for osrs it would basically be double the art work for every update.
---
I dunno about OP but I have a terrible mindset when it comes to school where videogame progress &gt; grades, so being able to AKF in RS basically saved me lol. With out it I end up rushing through it to get it done quicker to get back to playing games. At least when I'm AFKing I can get some XP gains while working so I don't feel like I have to rush to get back into it.
---
Go one spice at a time.
---
nicepetjad
---
I like the idea of a consistent angle on icons. Maybe for even more than just boots.
---
Being hit by a pure on a normal account is as annoying as being ragged because their equipment is even worse so they hardly hit unless they're in max or you're missing switches. In singles at least.
---
Oh yea I would want player trading for sure. The interesting part would be what conversion rates end up being for different consumables. I have a feeling law runes would be really important since they are used for teleports and if alchemy is disabled people could use them to train magic too.
---
I'm scared
---
100% a slippery slope into EOC v2
---
Dang you shoulda used white claws :o
---
Pvmer begging for off, resorts to sucking off the kings of the wilderness. Still doesn't stop the warrior.
---
Don't bother with bonds at your level. Just try level up, P2P is the easiest and quickest way to level up sp ypu can do money making. There is no way you can retain your sanity and continue to be able to make bonds at your level.
---
#GO BACK TO RS3
---
The game is written in Java.
---
Just auto-click it. Use a randomized timer (5-8 minutes) and randomized location (within like 5 pixels of your target).
---
You will literally never get caught or banned as long as you limit your splashing to like 6 hours/day, or something like that.
---
Lol same pc it began on with me
---
The set is 260 marks, and recolouring the whole set costs an additional 90. You also have to have 100% favour in the city of great kourend
---
alching it is 60% less money
---
Deep wildly pking and having pvmers be bait is vital to pvping health overall. It's where people go to practice, and dudes messing around go to kill helpless people. I get that people have lost faith in being bait to pkers but deep wilderness is pking. It's raw pking. There's no pures that are going to vote no on a new range weapon because it's going to outplace them on their zerker pure.
---
There's no confusing rules on when you need to eat so that the other person can still kill you. Deep wildly pking is no rules raw pking which is a normal pvp experience in any other game. You use everything in your arsenal to get the kill or escape.
---
There's a clear distinction between wildly pking, and the honor fights and no one cares to seperate the two in their mind. People who don't pk believe all the pking updates must go to bounty Hunter or the Pvp world's.
---
I'm just going to say it, emblems where a bad idea from the start. They weren't appreciated back then, and they certainly aren't now. People are now bitching that they're making them worse because jagex is trying to make a update that fixes the emblem farm bots that this update created, while also telling people it's a improvement for Pvp.
---
I think the only thing that's going to fix Pvp is a fundamental shift in the way people think about other players, rather then resorting to this two party system of pkers vs pvmers. It's nonsense to reduce all of these complex issues into something as dumb as "he voted different from us, get him!" It's entitled nonsense and only shows people that if they don't like how other people think that there is a group they can join to show much they dislike them for it.
---
How much do you play? As a kid I never did because I had no money.
---
Problem is bots are gonna use it for... something, they always do
---
No one is going to say it? The Dragon boots look like shit with different/mismatched spike sizes. Even them out.
---
The Legendary 3 blacked out brews. Congrats on the cape!
---
The old boot designs look like salt &amp; pepper shakers.
---
Floods and bugs.
---
It‚Äôs pretty accessible in the terms of actually getting there. But I do see how having a questlocked mini game can get rid of people. And yeah the stuff is in a desperate need of a buff
---
Not anymore. Soon with the full release of BH rework there should be other ways of getting it, though that may take a few weeks to a few months.
---
Why would you assume I'm mad
---
Yeah. Real shame that this mini game is dead. I would have really liked to play it. I want the cosmetics they look good.
---
This is something that honestly should've been thought of by jagex on release.  LMS is a battle royale and these type of cosmetics are super common.
---
Are topaz amulets easy to come by in the GE? I'm wanting to get into string jewelry magic training since its pretty afk and want to confirm if I can actually make money with it
---
Honestly if you stop thinking about nooblet you're a bad person
---
I'd be more impressed when people dont use the BIS gear
---
Are there any plugins on RuneLite that could potentially get users banned so I know to not use them? The last that I want to do is have to ask after it‚Äôs too late because I‚Äôll just end up accused of macroing/botting.
---
Pking was a lot more entertaining when honor pking was a thing. that‚Äôs my opinion, being smited actually meant something more.. or being called a teletubbie even getting asked how that def pot tastes.
---
Where did the Black Forest go?
---
imo, obtaining barrow gloves and completing hard diaries
---
Recipe for disaster for barrows gloves is your vest place to start. If you get bored of that shake it up with the Varrock, lumbridge, falador, kandarin and ardougne easy and medium diaries. In no order btw except Varrock is HIGHLY valuable for the free staves. 
---
Unlock fossil island for birdhouses and get fairy rings and Magic secateurs to start farming!
---
When I was in the early levels I would buy 100-200 of an item to test and see if profit could be made and note the prices bought/sold. Do this then if you're getting profit start doing it.
---
On avg ~8k topaz amulets are sold per day
---
No, RuneLite will (and has already) removed certain features that are not allowed, its safe to use.
---
Idk man I killed 117 crazy arch on w319 bh and got 32 emblems. So maybe they are fucked up.
---
We can kill gnome children already, it's time Jagex.
---
All shit answers. Fuck the runescape mafia, Im not giving them a cent. Scumbags tbh
---
shufflers are 2 alts that follow eachother next to you in the cave, making all the maniacal monkeys stack so you hit the max of 9 monkeys with every hit everytime, also making it completely afk. it more than doubles your xp, you can get up to a mil xp an hour with shufflers. it makes a 99 go from a couple days to just a day.
---
great space heater
---
Idk, it would devalue my front-facing-only ironman
---
Sick credit card
---
If he's Australia's #1 PVMer, I'm Jesus Christ himself.
---
yep :P
---
Ill drop you in ironman gear. Don't bring the vultures
---
Michigan basments are spooky.  They're essentially root cellars
---
What are we looking at
---
This is actually unreal man, it matches the artstyle of the ingame paintings flawlessly. We need this hahaha neieve iives on in our hearts haha
---
No quest cape? To trim the achievement diary cape?
---
Don't see any reason why it should be changed tbh
---
I did this when I was a kid. Get bored, make a pure. Don't commit, make another pure. It really stifled my progress (GP and time-wise) and I think it's what led to me ultimately quitting the game.
---
Now I'm all about my one account. When I run out of goals I take a break until I'm inspired to do something new, or finish something I started a while ago.
---
Fuck 12
---
Need authentic materials. Cant make bandos colored paint with grinding up bandos equipment as a base. You thought my suggestion was enough for a sculpture? Friend, youd need 100x the materials for that!
---
Aren't we all nooblets, somehow..?
---
All is right in the world now
---
Change everything but d boots
---
Honestly you'll be fine at PC with a D Scim and base 60s. Your stats restore automatically every round and you can die without consequence so you don't need supplies.
---
I always did like that feature. Free telly to lumby too
---
Forgot to mention I was speccing with dds++
---
Na looking up the npc names isn't cheating. You playing the game right dawg.
---
If those people are too hard to locate, I believe another person who made popular RSMVs was sladeakakevin. I believe he still uses reddit pretty frequently under the username u/sladeakakevin
---
Best of luck!
---
First idea I had, there are ten skills highlighted, (like for a member vs ftp) you can only gain xp in those skills, when you gain a level the highlight moves to a new skill.
---
One thing leagues allow for in path of exile is trial balancing, I would love to see leagues where we try out tweaks to combat both small and large (like the save 80% of runes relic they teased). 
---
I'm honestly just excited to play this game without run energy being a thing so I just hope every league has a starter relic for unlimited stamina.
---
They only spoil edible things
---
Make sure you've done all the F2P quests and work on the requirements for as many members quests as possible. Going for base 50s in all your skills will get you the reqs for enough quests to complete Recipe for Disaster, which unlocks Barrows Gloves which are something you'll keep using forever. Getting your fire cape by completing the fight caves is a good challenge to work towards towards as well.   
---
Once you've done lots of quests and gotten your skills up, check your diaries in the quest menu, you'll have the requirements for mediums and can easily go for hard diaries, they provide lots of great benefits.
---
Who's trying to up the population?
---
how many points to do those trade in for
---
I dont kill him with the 4 specs I can get off. What should I do
---
&gt; If you don't enjoy just don't play.
---
I do enjoy, tho? I love playing Runescape. 
---
I just don't love a single one of the boring-ass mindless grinds you have to do. 
---
I'm fine with doing Slayer for melee stats. Range I train the same way. It's actually engaging and fun. 
---
Magic, though, *shrug.* The best ways to train are boring and mindless as hell. When I play the game, I actually want to be having fun. 
---
Setting my account to splash for 6 hours a day while I sleep... yeah, that works for me.
---
As someone who doesn't actually play the game it makes it much easier to tell these are boots
---
K
---
No you're right they want it to die
---
Grats, Glad you got a BBD
---
I'd rather do 1-99 thieving on men than stepping my foot inside of a BA round.
---
D scim to finish
---
You think that is you. But we've became an amalgamation - collected together within the hive and our will is strong. **You are us and we are you.**
---
I feel like this is who should be guarding the tears of guthix, i like it man
---
$11+2.95 shipping and handling
---
Thanks for the input! :)
---
Did it? I always thought of it as a standard tool to measure the markets value. You where able to rent it out with the item lending system. It was a GREAT way to store value in a economy where everyday someone else progressses, the value of your gold depeciates by a sliver.
---
5 higher total level than me and 50m less exp
---
Crafting, I'm a happy man with 80 pray and 99 crafting. Unlimited tele that's almost always in my inventory cuz I'm a dumb ass and always forget stuff it also saves me so much time. As for actual usefulness just any activities that requires a lot of banking such as RC or rune dragons it's a huge time save.
---
jad ez lol
---
You found it on Facebook, we found it on reddit last year.
---
I eagerly await your rune crossbow green dhide and mystics cape
---
one of my favs so far!
---
Respect
---
That is true, but it matters less as your defense level gets higher. You just want your damage intake to be equal or less than your heal rate. And if not, you have food.
---
Isn't it the rough equivalent of the Heavy ballista?
---
That's hilarious! Thanks for sharing
---
This happened to me when I was playing eoc before osrs came out. Setup a cannon in legacy mode, and using a weapon in the strength setting. They changed cannons in a way that you get the same experience as chosen in your settings. So since I was on strength (top right option) I got ranged and defence exp since the top right option is controlled when you wield a ranged weapon.
---
This is 10000% how they should be.  Thanks for putting the time into changing them!
---
I wouldn't have known those were boots. So of course it's better.
---
Is runelite still safe to use?
---
Krita. Thank you!
---
i got that from the diary cape page, it's probably inaccurate then.
---
i hadn't gone to any other site, using my account. the emails regarding password change was to notify that my pw was changed after changing it through the official website
---
Ohh I thought it was on the quest point cape. You are correct then it is inaccurate. I should go fix that.
---
How to get dragon scimmy mouse
---
Plz no hack or virus
---
Look into wiki, now type boots, scroll to bottom click show at boots and it shows that 90% of the boots in osrs is similar to leather boots and points to left, 6% points towards and 4% points to right.

Nice
---
To be fair rcb is game changing when you first get it
---
 i hadn't gone to any other site, using my account. the emails regarding password change was to notify that my pw was changed after changing it through the official website
---
edit; i changed my pw through the official site, then it notified me through my email that its a unavailable name, i try to login using my email and it was a level 3 account. my account is from 2005 so i use my username to login, but obviously i couldnt bc its associated with a new email now.
---
It's a fantasy game....
---
Yeah it is. Not for slayer but it is great in many other situations.
---
I did and it made no difference. I still get 4 kills per ppot regardless.
---
They explicitly explained the reason for all of the rewards (sans trophy) are tradeable so you can play on an alt in the league and not lose progress on your main. And yeah that doesn't work for ironman main accounts.
---
Not the best reason but it's good enough imo
---
I think the biggest reason is actually the simplest one, which is cost. In most areas of Texas, the frost line depth is less than a foot. In the North and other colder environments, they have to dig much deeper to reach the frost line which is where the foundation needs to be laid otherwise the freezing and expanding of water will damage the foundation and pipes. Digging further than necessary is just an added cost, and since the ground in Texas is pretty much all clay (which also expands and contracts) with a limestone bedrock (which is costlier to dig out than dirt), it's not really worth it. In the north where the frost line depth is much deeper, if you've already dug down 5 or 6 feet to lay the foundation, you might as well make use of the space.
---
Not original commenter but i used to play a lot and I enjoy following how the game has evolved. I may eventually pick it back up. Also swampletics
---
The ones who dont complain are auto clicking just so you know lmao, every one that complains is just doing it wrong and thats why they whine. Cannoning is actually low exp and costly. Should only be done if you are making a low HP pure or auto clicking frankly
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I've found the rooms being full to be more of an issue than actually getting Pk'd
---
you may as well just splash if you're looking for best afkability, long before getting to the point where you're using black d'hide and maging bandits
---
thanks
---
just checked again and the pictures are right there in the runefest general newspost, don't know how i messed em lol
---
claws are quite effective to have in inv, i have got a kill here and there by equipping them after they attack me
---
Too late addiction setting in.

dude I'm in the same boat. I'm still hunting a BP at 1030kc
---
Aesthetically appealing

I will flag this one to Ash on Monday morning and gather his thoughts thanks!

Sorry to hear that.

I mean they look like the upgraded versions. (Prims/pegs/eternal) so idk why people wouldnt like this.

Pure fucking genius

Love to see the gains though!

It's nice until you get a notification for a snapdragon seed drop while cannoning dagannoths and now you have to long tap 382905 loot piles.

I like all of them but kinda wanna keep the original dboots look. Anyone else agree?

Parents got me this in the 2nd grade... little did they know what they started...
---
Nice congrats! I got KQ pet last night at 27 kc. Was my first time trying KQ, figured I'd do it since I had a task and had never tried it before.
---
Agree on the cost/return part and that theres a skill gap, but a ranking system would never work with how many players currently pvp you already have to wait and look for people.
---
Simple answer for this, do the ‚Äúask your SO‚Äù challenge we do for skills, but see if they can tell wtf these sprites are before and after
---
agree, skilling is a catch-22 case.
---
It isn't profitable enough compared to PvM, and gathering resources is too slow to be worthwhile. If resources were more expensive, it would just force players to do undesirable tasks, hence bots fill this niche.
---
Keep up the awesome work.
---
This post right here is the best answer to his question imo.
---
Removal of free tradeand the butchering of the wild is what started it and EoC finished it off.
---
Rune maybe do some barrows for fun see what you get
---
People have already told you about quests but what helped me was starting with slayermusiqs optimal quest guide. It‚Äôs an excel sheet with which quests to do in order and link to slayermusiqs quest guide videos. I started with that and it‚Äôs super helpful. What helped me the most was setting long term goals and short term goals. An ideal long term goal for starting out is barrows gloves. This will get you a lot of quest and level requirements done. Short term goals are something like 50 strength or fairy rings, something you can get done in one day.
---
I‚Äôm very out of the loop ‚Äî I thought you had to create a new OSRS account. Can you log in with your RS3 account but start with a fresh new OSRS character, too?
---
Tile Indicators, check the box that says "Highlight destination tile"
---
Do whatever the fuck you want
---
Right on! LOL
---
Nobody gives a fuck that you got a drop that's like 10 times more common than an imbued heart
---
I like this and think it's a good idea. Still looks like something straight from 2007, but means the boot icons would finally all be consistent.
---
It was definitely the hardest thing I have done in osrs, but I think that for multiple reasons. One being the time required for a single run, the knowledge of how ticks work, knowledge of Inferno itself, variety of spawns, and falling motivation. Bis gear did definitely help, but after getting the cape, it seems reasonable with lower tier gear, just a bit slower.
---
Yep its a good change imo
---
I did look at one but it just seemed off. According to the wiki you can potentially string 1700 per hour, and profit 400gp+ each. Unless I‚Äôm missing something...
---
You get 1 point per kill, 1 point for surviving a certain amount, and it was 1 point for winning (not completely sure on the last one)
---
There is literally nothing aesthetic about splashing
---
77 to boost for master clue, 91 (?) to boost for mory elite
---
Hey Kay! Congratulations on 99!!! I remember u from runecrafting at the 2k total lvl world (watched u get 98), glad u finally made it :D
---
Wait don't we have this? You can make flatpacks, it's just slow af because of the animations of having to get on/off the chair.
---
I remember they changed the death mechanics at one point so dh helm would be lost and it shot up in price
---
Hmm, if it is purely for gold, I am unsure if it is still a thing, but running was at ZMI was good coin a few months ago...
---
You can run rune essence for like 3m/hr and need some rc levels....if you use the rc cc. Or you can run essence for me or dragon bones for 1m/hr. No hoops to jump through. But if you jump those hoops from the cc‚Äôs you can make much more.  Lmk, pm me if interested.
---
Go kill a gnome and pretend it's him.. closest you'll ever get
---
I just realized this fire making amor exists, I have killed 67 without one, how rare are they?
---
don't care to for bh just need more people in general in the wild/deep wild getting 500k am average kill in mystics is decent loot sometimes u get lucky and get way more, need something to attract players to do the wilderness tbh, and restore the food chain
---
 people estimate 1/800
---
First time I played Runescape was in 2017 so not true
---
RS helps with my depression :(
---
IDK how it should be done but BH should probably make minimum ~1m hp/hr provided you're actively engaging with the content. 
---
People don't like hearing it, but new people to PVP probably need to come close to breaking even/a small profit just so they can keep learning and improve, and skilled players getting 1m gp/hr + loot isn't insane while rune drags etc exist. Also doesn't really effect ironman/people who don't want to PVP at all.
---
Not sure how you do it to reward activity but also just not produce a bot farm.
---
I had the same one except no floppy drive... I thought "man we reeeeallly need that drive" and 6 months later it's almost as if floppies never existed....
---
Ya I know a guy I work with that plays RS. I mainly do deep wildy pking and he does afk woodcutting/mining so we've never interacted in game.
---
I'm not sure if you're the person who made the video or if this is satire, but a few tips from a nonpersonal standpoint.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1) "Altching" and "Aulking". Both versions of the word were spoken, only one is correct (the kuh sound) and should've been used for consistency. 
---
2) Instead of using fire runes, just use a fire staff instead. Using an air staff is pointless because alchemy doesn't require any air runes, and although the cost is minimal, every bit helps.
---
3)  Right-clicking on the alchemy spell gives you the option to disable the high value warning, if you're doing that sort of thing. Saves a lot of time.
---
4) For a 'tip' video, the facecam is rather unnecessary and pointless.
---
5) Cut your footage and do a little time skipping, rather than having others watch in silence as you do the same thing over and over, with the alching and calculating. The process isn't as vital to the viewer as the results are.
---
Truthfully, I don't see the video as very useful. "Buy items lower than the value you can high alch them for and you make money." It's not exactly new or gamebreaking, and although I haven't seen the 2016 version or whatever, I have a feeling it's not very different in terms of method.
---
An attempt was made. Sorry to be the harsh one here, but it could've been done quite a bit better.
---
Honestly, not trying to be a jerk but nothing will really drop anything remotely worth the time to loot with those stats.
---
Give me all your fuckin shit
---
Ultra IQ? That‚Äôs definitely an understatement.
---
He did it on a lvl 3 with only a shortbow and leather boots. Not even any arrows. Get on his level m8.
---
Yeah but when you look at it it‚Äôs only boost timers and hp and prayer bar.
---
thats a max cape, and you can use avas, or imbued gods cape with max cape
---
umm go fuck urself!$@%#&amp;_#%
---
Congrats.
---
You don‚Äôt even play the game so makes no difference to you
---
You can do it on the normal range cape too.

---
No reason to be so condescending. Sure, there are people that do it with lesser gear and even no supplies, but all of those people have already gotten many kills and attempts before doing that. 
---
I don't see any problem at all with doing your first inferno kills with BIS gear, and I am definitely impressed that he/she completed it since it's still such a huge barrier to get over even after several years.
---
The good ole HP.. Very first PC I played Runescape on.  Parents blamed Runescape when it started getting slow and crashed..

Which mods here can i contact regarding a banned or compromised account? my brother  has not played in a long time. he tried to come back, but he got a macroing major. he says he has 2FA and his email is safe. regardless, 
---
1. how do we go about appealing this
---
2. aren't there some JMODS on this sub that we can contact and they look into these things? thanks
---
depending on your range lvl, elite void range is often better than armadyl yes. Get it if you plan on doing vork or raids soon
---
He's rude, yes, but without it I wouldn't have understood.

This is deep

My first computer was that exact computer and I destroyed it many of times doing many na√Øve installs as well.
---
probably saw framed's video and was thinking to himself. "reddit post for attention."
---
Could've boosted with a pie at 91 :\^)
---
Yeah all it really does is give you the increased ammo retention.
---
It's wild that people think the being annoyed at losing items comes from OSRS. Did you guys not play when the Abyss was added, 'spade' has just replaced 'glory'.
---
Also, no one lost any real value PVMing back in the day. The big one was GWD, and you did it with friends who just gave you back your stuff if you died.
---
They‚Äôre pretty rare to see. I‚Äôve only seen 3 raids morph pets in game.
---
Why...
---
im 100% convinced it exists just so kids could buy membs without permission lol
---
why else would it really exist
---
Do it man, xerics amulet is very useful for kourend slayer tasks/clues. 
---
Hosidius patch is free real estate with 100% favour. 
---
Blast mine is good for getting rune ore ten levels before you are able to and gives you massive xp drops if you stick with it. 
---
Lizardmen.

Woodcutting guild. 
---
Arceuus spell book for ensouled heads. 
---
I did it as soon as I was able and its been really useful.
---
I think you missed the point. Use the mage arena 2 cape on the magic cape. You have to get the bis cape first.
---
Just memeing.

Stick to those barrows gloves.

It is hard to name something PVP when it contain of AFKing for hour and then 10 second matach against friend.

________________________________
---
From my perspective it is failed design for PVP content to:
---
-  make "EP system" that best way to use it is to hide from other players (in MMO game) and do nothing and is will be hard to balance while players still can lose progress if someone find them. 
---
instead of:
---
-  making actual system the encourage player interaction and make balancing reward much easier.
---
Please no. The dragon and bandos boots looks so satisfying when it's in your inv. But yeah not really no. I just said that because it's nostalgic and comforting.
---
Lol I remember when this was posted on twitter
---
Lots of drama and salt from some people, like they'd quit if some boots' icons were change on a video game
---
The more realistic answer is to just know people and suck up to them. Most of the pmods I've seen nowadays get it were basically just people who knew jmods and sucked up to them enough. As a consequence most of the pmods I ever run into are complete and utter specimens. They also had some weird pmod waves, like when a year or so ago they just shoved pmod on a bunch of aussies specifically.
---
Back 10-15 years ago it was different and imo a lot better but still wasn't like you just report a couple people and get pmod lol. Don't be snitchin on your fellow players it ain't getting you a virtual crown
---
I believe we should receive cash drops for emblems that are pked. Values could be 1/2 or even 1/4 shop value based on tier. I also believe the emblem upgrade system needs changed, it leads to players having to bank often to swap tiers based on what their opponent has. Upgrades should be based on 1) if the player is skulled, and 2) if the player has an emblem or not. There should also be more variety of bounty tasks, based on weaponry, special attacks, and uses of other gear or other equipment.
---
In the current beta, it is difficult to find an opponent risking anything more than a tier 1, or even t2. This makes getting passed t3 nearly impossible....
---
I just checked mine and it‚Äôs the same! Hello fellow scaper who started same day.
---
thriving when they're afking :D
---
That's like saying thriving when u see a bot farm
---
Don't start slayer just yet, it's terribly inefficient with low stats and you'll want to skip using vannaka as a master and go to chealdar/nieve when you get the appropriate  combat level. Chaos druids are excellent at low levels and you'll make a fair bit of money there. Especially from the ranarr drops.
---
I may be the only one, but I actually like this meme.
---
Oh interesting I shall watch this later thank you :)
---
A scroll wheel is a button. It is an input. Argue all you want but until you provide some links from the official team, myself and a lot of top pagers are going by official posts, not rumors. And if they were to clarify, it would be an official post warning people not to use certain software for remapping and then.
---
 Even if it was a foot pedal as long as it's 1:1 I dont see a problem. I have no problem discontinuing binds if an official statement is made. Its pretty black and white. Third party client features I can understand after their vague statement but this has been okay and used by top tiers for years.
---
Sorry muff daddy
---
&gt; I could probably get an entire RC level in that time.
---
Lets not get ahead of ourselfes here. Also, you forgot to take into account the rng it requires to get a date. Rare drop!
---
This was reposted last week.
---
Lol it's all good
---
You can't.
---
Isn't there nothing to prevent people from removing the PIN and waiting til its gone to wipe you anyway? If you havent been online ofcourse.
---
Someone actually got into my account recently, took some $ from my inventory and removed the bank PIN but I secured my account before they came back to wipe me. Had no idea my PIN was removed during those 3 days I was offline.
---
(I had authenticator but removed it for a while when my phone was broken and I need it to play but its back on now)
---
Indeed he is. Rather chill streamer.

I‚Äôm off work today with horrific diahorrea. I can totally relate to this dragon
---
Wow huge change ::Kappa::
---
especially the community that has 2k total worlds locked down and generate hundreds of mills a day. also the ironmen community that pay for protection to farm there, ruining the spirit of ironmen.
---
No price check=useless post......
---
You have 3 main areas of required response (passwords, billing information and account creation details). You need atleast 1 correct section to bypass the automatic replies. You are also more likely to bypass the system if you make the appeal with (more or less) the same IP adress as the one you made your account with.
---
I guess that's the perspective difference between people wanting to do PvP for the fighting aspects, the tactics involved, but on the other hand some people get enjoyment out of taking the GP from others and earning money that way. It's a hard balance to get both parties involved.
---
In that case, at 75 you'll probably want to get a tome of fire and staff of the dead &gt; smoke battlestaff and use fire wave until around 81-2 mage.
---
Adam and Nieve, you mean

ahhhhh dang. thank you so much. Hmmmm maybe  I should look for a different money maker haha

Just make dart tips and AFK a bit. Takes a little while, but shouldn't cost you a thing. Very mobile-friendly activity as well.
---
Lumbridge, then fremmy.
---
You'll have unlocked vorkath by the time you do lumb, and fremmy unlocks the fastest teleport to vorkath and rel in general.
---
The only thing I dislike is that the spike on the right dragon boot looks weird. It doesn't even look like a spike. That aside though, I wouldn't mind the change.
---
You still need java
---
to be fair, its harder going even in kills loot than braindeadly doing vorkath in void for way more gp.
---
I started about a week ago. Did some chaos druids untill 40 atk, 50 str and lava dragons with 8 magic + untill 50 magic.
---
Did 2 slayer tasks for 18 slayer and went for animal magnetism quest and ranged on chaos druids untill 50 range.
---
Had enough money for starter gear and bought some dragon bones to get 43 prayer with gilded altar.
---
Do some quests and get knowledge and train all skills a little. Money will come.
---
DPS calcs are gonna be your friend (I'd recommend [bitterkoekje's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit#gid=158500257)). For niche questions like this dealing with specific bank limitations and specific gear sets, you'll get a better answer checking different setups for yourself. I'd prioritize your mage setup over your range setup - you use mage for 2 of the colors, range for only 1.
---
You‚Äôre literally beating the shit out of them.
---
Those people aren‚Äôt making much money. The best money makers require a well-rounded account and are locked behind quests.
---
Think you're more likely to keep playing if they do it?  Or are you ok with how it is?
---
Nah in 2007 F2P, anyone with dragon armor had serious clout. Can't speak for the members worlds, since I didn't get membership til 2009, but dragon armor was for the cool kids in F2P.
---
Personally i really like the old school, simple art style we have now.
---
I think risk is a good thing most of the time. It adds excitement. The problem is counterplay. When its a boss its generally skill based. Sure you could dc but in 99% of scenarios it depends on your actions if you die or not.
---
The issue with counterplay in the wilderness is that there is no counterplay. You could take gear and supplies but that makes training any skill inefficient.
---
13 prayer.
---
I mean if people didnt PK in like 50k worth of risk they'd maybe make more money..? They obviously are more than likely to make less money off of a PvMer with his known 3 items or a clue runner with a spade than a fellow PKer
---
I'm very on and off atm anyway. I couldn't say for certain but I do think there is a need to improve the graphics.
---
If you play a retro game, do you play the original version or the remaster?
---
Just bring in eoc so I can fucking quit again

Group ironman is just a benefit of a new clan system, which is an important thing
---
We mustn't let them evolve
---
They didn‚Äôt make it impossible to trade at other altars, just smile because it was making Xp rates way higher than originally polled. They know essence running is part of the game.
---
Well if the original still has players then ill play that. Cod4 for example
---
I used to see people asking for the graphics update get shut down because no one wanted it.  Now I see people get shut down because the team has basically said it's impossible. The files are gone, working with the 3rd party HD people failed. Recreating the files would take too much work, require contractors, and would double work on the graphical portion of every update here on out.
---
H EU thanks guys for the quick reply‚Äôs I‚Äôll been getting them crystals in no time
---
That‚Äôs sick is like a will wonka but with a bong cause smoking weed!
---
HD just looks plain trash to me. The current graphics are more interesting, even most of the new stuff being added I hate stylistically.
---
I‚Äôm at 139 with just a dinhs and torn prayer scrolls

I farmed 1700 of these on task post nerf in  3 weeks.  Maxed combat btw. Got jaw. locked them forever
---
Holy shit I remember the Mr Roboto video! That was up there with Tyvak519 in terms of legendary status!
---
There is something that happens when you lower fidelity in a visual art medium, you start representing things and ideas of varying complexity as simple and basic concepts - sometimes to hit a certain aesthetic, sometimes as a self imposed challenge, but for games it's usually hardware/software dependent. This has a tendency to require a certain agency from the player - in terms of video games - to use their imagination which given the possibilities of the human imagination can result in an incredibly immersive experience. 
---
If you're an avid reader you probably have entire worlds, planets, castles, lands or houses detailed through imagination in a quasi-nebulas state whilst only ever been handed small amounts of critical information (That of low relatable complexity, e.g. *The barren grey walls upon which the keep sat*) from the author.
---
In much the same way i prefer games that have reduced visual clutter as i prefer agency-driven game-play instead of passive experiences, that is to say games that leave little the imagination in lieu of highly detailed worlds and scapes.
---
Isn't that kind of the same situation?  New people play the remaster, the retro get progressively less players.  I think a graphical update might be necessary for Old School to grow for more than a few years.  Personal opinion obviously.
---
Texas Renaissance?
---
Join "D W D"
---
As large as Old School is compared to RS3, this might be worth the investment in my opinion.  Maybe they could do a player poll to decide what graphics work, rather than the one people didn't like anyways.
---
Yeah bro, what a fuckin' discovery! 
---
Some people don't enjoy all aspects of a game! Some people only like Pking and Slayer, and hate Questing! 
---
Some people only like Skilling and PvM, and hate Pking!
---
Some people only like Slayer, Pking, Questing, and hate training Magic!
---
Holy fucking shit! Who knew something like that was possible??
---
Lmfao
---
I agree with the message but holy shit this is a horrendous meme attempt
---
What are you complaining about? I got my first drop on my 138th kc, all raids done in 4-6 man teams.
---
Ditto.
---
I put on my robe and wizard hat..
---
10/10 Would heart pray again
---
Seeing the proper shadows and textures was the best thing about the update.  The spirit updates weren't that great, but anything that maintains the old style with additional features looks amazing to me!
---
It is just me or are bot farms getting crazier out there?
---
In the long run it'd probably be easier.  One of the other comments pointed out how new content looks pretty different from existing.  I wonder how much work it is to make those areas look so different, while keeping the existing areas the same.
---
ahh bug abuse, I see..
---
Well we dont know if it's a bug. So if we dont talk about it, its okay
---
Omg you still don‚Äôt get it. YOU BOTH FUCKING SAID ‚Äúgo up‚Äù.
---
Delet
---
Making gp through pking has been the same the last 18 years, your reward is the loot your opponent drops when you kill them. NOBODY complained about it for over a decade and a half, yet now we have whiny pvpers citing pvm money makers as an excuse to be gifted rsps-esque "pk points" for extra rewards. It seems the better reward system would be going back to the EP system and requiring people to risk more than 72k in gear/coins.
---
Nice!
---
an unintended game mechanic is a bug so I think this qualifies as a bug
---
Do you know that it is unintended?
---
Yup very serious. Just as part of a minigame. Like the tournament worlds.
---
Osrs passwords arent case sentive?
---
It's too late now
---
Your opinion instantly became Jack shit to everyone when you started dissing this person's. Why? Because it's a fucking opinion and everyone is entitled to one. Accept that it's his opinion and reply with yours in a friendly manner.
---
If i'm right, arent those boot models the same from + 08' era? idk why but they seem sosimilar from what i remember
---
Thanks to this i was able to get it in time thanks.
---
I'm pro-HD. On one hand I'm not arsed why if it stays like it is now but on the other, if a poll came out for HD I'd definitely vote in favour.
---
It did have its flaws but that's the beauty of a polling system, and us being the ones who decide. We can decide what comes into the game and what doesnt. Those goes damn scimitars where a disgrace:L
---
Do you understand what net loss is?
---
Summon the PKs
---
Doesn‚Äôt mention tehnoobshow. Wtf...
---
Imagine Jed gettin your email password too
---
No it just feels like me and OP are playing different games
---
Who actually gives a shit whether it's BIS or not?
---
Like seriously, compare their drop table to demonic gorillas. Basilisks have ONE good drop, that's it, nothing else. Unless you get a jaw you are actually losing money by doing basilisks.
---
Gorillas have many useful drops, one gorilla is worth around 25k in loot on average, compared to a basilisk's 3-4k (max).
---
They also don't need to be done on a slayer task, whereas basilisk knights do. Jaw droprate is ~8x more rare than a shard off-task.
---
Arguments regarding whether the helm is bis or not are stupid. These monsters need to either be faster to kill or have a better drop table, or they will become dead content that people will put off doing because the extra +1 strength isn't worth the time invested.
---
Tax the GE is the only "gold sink"
---
&gt; IMO it is failed design for PVP content to:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; make "EP system" that best way to use it is to hide from other players (in MMO game) and do nothing and is will be hard to balance while players
---
Make it so you gain ep when you kill other players, sure it can also be abused, but that's much more effort. Slap a decent-ish req onto gaining ep so people don't mass farm on lvl 20's again and should be fine.

Just get the hard diary, it‚Äôs so worth it. It also unlocks the bone crusher for you.

Yeah and i can't accept it just because you are taking accounting 101 and spouting bullshit statistics
---
I'm sure they've came out and said its possible but there would be a lack of big updates for a long while.
---
I dont believe a thing jagex says after they came out and said a "older version" of runescape wouldnt be possible because they dont have a backup.
---
Fast forward a few months and jagex shitting themselves from a decrease in players and they just happen to stumble across a 2007 backup.
---
Edit: also, if runelite can bring out a graphical update with their small team then jagex can bloody do it
---
‚ÄúVery rare‚Äù

Id swap out body and legs for barrows armor or blessed rune armor with same mage bonus boots/ring/occult necklace. You can easily tank torag and guthans (sharks are way cheaper than ppot) then bring dhide and msb(I) and only switch for ahrims. Also learn the safespot for the ladder rooms in the crypt and spam click doors to force brother to spawn

I take it you don't have a college degree. Or if you do, you've completely missed the point of a college education

I don't need hd but I'd appreciate the option to have it, and seeing how many people want it makes me wonder why Jagex refuse to make it and put an additional fee to get it. It'd be something completely fair to pay for imo, not mtx trash.

Nope :P

Holy shit you‚Äôre alive?! Your ‚ÄúTribute‚Äù video was my absolute favorite of all time!

Being case sensitive has absolutely nothing to do with the encryption, hashing, and storage. I built 3 clan forums in osrs and could set the forum user and or password to be case insensitive, but there was no way at all for me to see the password.
---
Even if I pulled up the technical details it wouldn't even show me the password and even if you decompiled the database and all that to see the password hashes it was a 200 character string of random uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols to represent the password.
---
QPs aren't skills, but I did forget about DS2 for ferocious gloves, but that also gives you assembler (68 mining, 70 smithing), which still means the bulk of your skills could be 50s-60s

Don't put that in your looting bag...

Keep iconic boots like dragon and bandos the same, new icons make them look private server-y

I know there are some gaps but I thought that the monsters that had droptables provided by Jagex were supposed to be completely correct.

What is you IGN? If you're available now I could prob 1+1 leech you a raid.

Correct. Ohio!

To me the low polycount, choppy animation &amp; single color aesthetic is both nostalgic and unique. The main thing I disliked about HD was its obsession of putting the same "grimy" detail texture on everything. I find it pleasing to look at simple scenery, plus it's a bit easier to tell where the tiles are (detail textures make them flow together a little too well - which is cool if you want a natural look but works against mechanics that require special positioning)
---
By the way, if you hate jagged edges, you might want to try Runelite's GPU plugin as it has an antialiasing option.
---
You joined at a bad time then.  Yes, we are a small clan, but we have quite a lot of people online in the cc at peak times of the day.

Thought I had someone scam me doin this yesterday, was helping out some noobs in f2p when some guy asks me to get him a bond and he‚Äôd pay me back. Obviously I‚Äôm not doing this for some random guy , but then he offers a down payment of 3m and an archers ring when he gets into a members world. Now at this point I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a scam but if I lose 2m it‚Äôs not the end of the world so I tell him to trade me the 3m first then I‚Äôll buy the bond, you know you trust me and I‚Äôll trust you typa deal, and now it‚Äôs getting intense cause he‚Äôs probably thinking I‚Äôm about to scam him and it‚Äôs like who‚Äôs scamming who here. So I buy the bond and give it to this guy and now I‚Äôm down 2m so I hop to the members world he told me to hop to for the archers and I‚Äôm sweating now like why would I trust some random guy I probably just lost 2m but then he runs up gives me an archers ring and I made something like 2m and a new friend. Long story short some people in rs aren‚Äôt scumbags and it restored my faith in the community. Definitely won‚Äôt be trusting other people though as getting scammed was probably 100 times more likely to happen than actually having someone stick to their word.

Not sure if everyone else sees it the way I do, but personally I think Varrock‚Äôs Medium diary is worth it seeing how easy the requirements are. It allows you to choose either Varrock Square or the GE as your Varrock teleport location which greatly reduces your ring of wealth uses. I also realize that having an ornate jewelry box gives unlimited GE teles but this requires you to drop a lot of GP into construction where as the Varrock Medium is very little, if any, GP dropped in.
---
Yeah, it's the whole point of it, and OP made proper use of how it's SUPPOSED to be. Yet here we are, people still complaining about players fighting in the wild. I think this past couple years the player base has begun to stray very far from the original mindset we originally saw in RS years ago.
---
Jesus fuck that's an average of one pair of boots every 60 clue scrolls that's insane. Just to make it sting more if all 25 of those boots were rangers they'd be worth basically 750mil. Obviously you're a BTW so you would have stopped grinding after getting them but yea.

First things first! Just have fun man. Others have already commented very useful insights. I'll just say welcome to the game and this subreddit! Ask ask ask and ask some more. The oldschool wiki is your best friend as well
---
it doesnt help that skilling isn't rewarding and PKers would make money if they'd fight people that had stuff to lose. Instead they all circle jerk 3 steps off GE wearing 12k in loot risk, killing each other just to pay for their repairs; resulting in an overall loss for all involved.
---
And rightfully so haha. Their security is mediocre for a tiny non-established company, at best.

Is there no customer service line to just call?

followed by laugh emote then cry emote shortly after
---
You forced a shitty meme with your alt account into this screenshot so i'm not sure if I even should say gz tbh.
---
It is a good meme because in reality Jagex's recovery system is the worst security system that exists in the entire MMO world. ESPECIALLY considering they have no customer service.
---
I've heard before that people got flagged for using certain wireless mouses. This sounds like your case, make an appeal and hope for the best
---
Not bandos boots or dragon but the rest sure
---
That's just like, your opinion man

it just shows the ignorance of anyone believing the meme and thinking the player is the problem instead of the broken security system
---
Looks super clean. I enjoy nostalgia but those dboots look sexiiii
---
I quite literally do not, I haven‚Äôt even done client of kourend on any account I have. Nor have I done bone voyage or DS2 or really any of that content.
---
The game does not have to have new stuff. It does not have to be endless, there‚Äôs a point where the game can be ‚Äúover‚Äù, and that point used to be basically lvl 75‚Äôs with GWD. That was a reasonable point for content to become endgame, and in some ways that content is still endgame. Content after that started to lose artistic consistency and slowly started to power creep.
---
SnC OSRS pretty nice one :)

I was figuring there was a spot around the lair that was multi, the cave itself wouldnt be a good idea since the person would see "10 adventurers inside". Now im just wondering what the spot would be.

I'm aware that entering the wild does not come without risk, and it's a risk I'm willing to take, but that doesn't mean I have to vote yes to stuff that makes me easier to kill lmao... If I vote no against PvP weapons it's not out of spite, but because I don't want to lose the loot I just got as a drop or the chins I just spend an hour catching.

Make steel bars at blast furnace:
---
400k/h without coal bag from motherlode mine.
---
Coal bag takes about 10 hours of highly afk-able mining to get, turning profit into 700k+ /h. Very worthwhile investment. Smithing levels gained eventually puts you at mith/addy bars increasing profit further.

If you actually had an understanding of the situation you would know that venezuelan IP's are heavily targeted and banned for RWT (automated bans outside office hours)
---
Jagex got some really disturbing business ethics towards venezuelan players. If they didn't the game would die very quickly.
---
It‚Äôs a 50/50 chance though? You must be very unlucky.
---
what? bringing 100m in gear to pvp doesn‚Äôt mean the other people are magically gonna risk more for you. and if you go deep wild trying to kill pvmers for more money there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll just be logged in on.

Rng is "random" just cause u get one random lucky drop doesnt mean youre not gonna get another one soon.

Well you're definitely going on that list now...shouldn't have said that

This movie was boring af when I watched it
---
Only exception they've had for these clues not being the listed ones are infernal cape instead of firecape. They really like to stroke the ego of people who have those capes, and I have one, so I'm perfectly fine with it.
---
And?
---
And it still retains basically the same look and feel with how simple it is. Just because they added smooth lighting and texture multi layering doesn‚Äôt mean that the graphics of the game have drastically improved or that those changes were needed to make the game look any better.
---
Minecraft has always looked like... Minecraft. It is not graphically impressive regardless of what they change over time, and it doesn‚Äôt have to be, since the looks being high quality or realistic or detailed really aren‚Äôt important at all. Minecraft‚Äôs visuals are meant to be simple and easy to navigate your eyes through.
---
In a very similar way OSRS‚Äôs current art style is very important to what the game is. Minecraft may have added new graphical features but under some basic shadows and lighting is still the same brightly colored textures, simple objects, and visually identifiable mobs and structures and biomes.
---
When runescape got the HD update it took away the visual ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù that the game had and put a layer of paint over it that kinda blurred everything together. Things were not as identifiable, nothing stood out, transitions between textures were blurred and excessive quantities of decoration blocked view of the basic, square and boxy nature of the game.

Oh god the sounds.

Make a mental note of how many items you should have in your inventory for your runs. When banking, count the items in your inventory. If you're short an item, you know you missed something.
---
Bird house runs require 8 items from example. 4 logs, two tools, seeds, digsite pendant. If I ever have less than 8 items I know I forgot something.

I love RS3's mix of old ass 2008 textures with modern looking faces.

---
You're awful, Quiz Mast-er.
---
Did you ever end up killing it?
---
The grand exchange is what killed the game imo. Obviously it lasted a lot longer than that, but, the core of the game was lost. You no longer had to interact with people. You didn't have to work to find that item you wanted at the price you knew it was worth instead of instant gratification.
---
I've reread this 100 times and I still can't figure out what you're trying to say..

I agree with cooking. I went from about 80 to 99 because it was fairly afk and I made 4 or 5m. Fast, easy and profitable 99 right there

Yes, it needs to be hardcoded in to check variances of different states of an object.  The clue is looking for a specific object id's, in this case are for all normal glory from 0 to 6 charges.

I think these are roughly right, I made them for my wife who plays osrs with me! They are made to the taste she likes. Also it was one for me and one for the potion so measurements may be a little off.
---
We also made a super combat (basically an green dyed pina colada) but the flask had a crack so we had to put it in something more boring.
---
I heard fally course isn‚Äôt as good for grace as canifis course is quicker to manoeuvre around which leads to more marks p/h?
---
Bro you don't go to the duel arena to "PK" just the same as you don't go to lava drags to "pvp" people. They're two different activities that happen to have similar underlying principles, just like regular bossing vs raids. Both PVM but NOT the same thing. Different expectations for both, same with PVP/PK. It's always been like that.
---
You must not have been around from the start, runescape was based on PVP! I've played on and off since 2005/06 and when the wildy was released, PVP transitioned there, and then PKing was born when PVM/non PVP was introduced to the wildy.
---
Ya but you shouldn't be in that dire need of graceful outfit anyways , my personal opinion would be to prioritize exp with a skill like agility.
---
200 IQ me realised they've essentially become discontinued until the beta ends. Profited 14m in one trade.
---
Trash IQ me realised this on release but only acted on friday, had the cash to buy 2k of them but ended up buying less than 50
---
Green boater, purple elegant skirt, and pink elegant blouse
---
For myself, I would stay at Canifis until 60.  But that‚Äôs because I am not fond of maintaining a stat boost.  If I had all the Marks that I wanted, I would probably move to Fally.  There are a fair number of failures in the low 60s on the Seers course, after all.
---
Boosting from 55 will make for a lot of pie eating as the boost begins to lower.  I could maybe see it from 58.
---
Good job! I'm six tries in!
---
Untrimmed I might add. Straight mad lad
---
Wouldn't wanna do that to her
---
Just a goal of mine tbh
---
This had actually happened to me a lot and it's not because I'm scamming. I have a couple different account, the main one being an ironman. If I want to play another account that ran out of membership, 9 times out of 10 theres no gp on it and all the money is tied up in members items. 
---
That being said I dont ask random people lol, I usually ask some clan mates and they'll bond me and then I pay them back.
---
Lol gl
---
My thoughts are Yes.
---
It takes just one person to break pking for the entire community, because an i9 9900k is capable of running **300** OSRS bots. I'm sure that some people must have thought of using level 3s to scout the wilderness back in 2007, but the original design for the wilderness did not take into account that future CPUs would be much more powerful, allowing a single person to scan the entirety of the wilderness.

Player Killing (PKing) is a subset activity of PvP in general, that doesn't mean it's an entirely different entity to it.
---
- Bounty Hunter is a "minigame" (really a D&amp;D) that has PKing incorporated in it due to you literally attacking and killing other players.
---
- Castle Wars is a minigame that has PKing incorporated in it due to you literally attacking and killing other players.
---
- Clan Wars is a "minigame" (really a D&amp;D) that has PKing incorporated in it due to you literally attacking and killing other players.
---
- Duel Arena is a "minigame" (really a D&amp;D) that has PKing incorporated in it due to you literally attacking and killing other players.
---
- Mage Arena is a "minigame" (miniquest really) that is an anomaly mainly because it is placed in the wilderness for most of the combat parts. Anything outside of PvM that occurs there is still PKing and thus PvP oriented.
---
- TzHaar Fight pit is a minigame that has PKing incorporated into it due to you literally attacking and killing other players.
---
- Last Man Standing is a minigame that has PKing incorporated into it due to you literally attacking and killing other players.
---
The only way you can participate in minigames with PK-centric mechanics is to kill other players or be killed yourself. Short of teleporting/leaving the minigame before you die you are participating in PKing/PvP. There's only 7 minigames that actually incorporate PvP into them and all of them result in you either dying or killing other players.
---
Meme i think originating from people being super dry on getting a draconic visage, which is so rare that youre likely to go super dry. Because oziach is a big part in dragon slayer and can combine a visage to make a dfs, people would say that you had to speak to him for a chance to get a visage drop, making someones thousands of dragon kills essentially for nothing.
---
What 99 shall I go for next?
---
Fishing? Cooking? Farming? Mining? Smithing? Fletching? Thieving? Hunter? Prayer? Construction?
---
u miswrote word sleep unfortunately
---
I've pked since 2001 lol. PvP is the scenario/situation, PKing is the subset activity of it. Bossing and raids are the same damn thing, it is activities of PLAYERS VERSUS MONSTERS. It seems you are not understanding some verbiage used.

How the fuck has he got a gf and I havent, obviously need to work on my cape making skills
---
Absolutely agree. The pvm droptables I think will be part of the (eventual) death of the game. I'm not being all melodramatic, but if we look at the droptables for post osrs bosses vs earlier ones, you see the issue.
---
It killed skilling for anything but 99s, it killed Pvp.
---
The new loot tables are getting rid of what made osrs (well, actual 2004-8 Runescape) unique from every other mmo that's just kill one of 5 monsters, get loot, repeat. Except in games like wow, the combat system is at least much more fleshed out so it's more forgivable.

It looks way better and makes so much more sense and makes the game overall look a lot tidier, but will it pass? Not because nostalgia always wins, i would have that people need to accept change but without nostalgia we wouldn't of gotten osrs in the first place
---
Are rune knives really that good at basilisk knights? they have a ton of defense so I figured something with high attack bonus+ diamond bolts E chance to ignore defense would be better then something like knives.

I've not logged on in about 3 months, if that's the prices of bonds now, that's crazy! Is everything else going up too then or not? (I.e. Whips, abby dagger etc.)
---
why is this being downvoted?!
---
You're looking at high enrage Telos and 5 man AoD which is ToB+ difficulty.
---
Problem is that in order to get that 75-100m/hr you have to be insanely good at Telos and your kill speeds are based off Aura CDs unless you have a bunch of saved up refreshers.
---
Also those figures are probably a bit outdated, as telos uniques have dropped in value over time as well as some common items on the drop table becoming worthless.
---
That looks hilarious!  I would love to see you randomly in a bar hahaha
---
The point of a bank pin is redundancy, it's not supposed to do anything and it doesn't, the moment someone is in you're compromised permanently anyway.
---
Adding more redundancy on top of that is just paranoia

A teleport out is what I would add.

Yeah there's two paths for the end game ultimate from what I know is the bossing and the maxing path. Maxing path would have a lot of herbs and other supplies in the looting bag whilst the bossing path might have a lot of gear stored. You wouldn't really want to be going and doing the high level wildy stuff after you get your rune pouch, seed box and what not since it would be lost after lvl 20 wildy. Also the benefit to dividing in edgeville is that it's so close to the wildy and to thugs which are just right down the ladder. Most of the time they do have more than 28 or at least close to 28 items but its not a huge deal since looting bags are so easy to get. Not to mention that you can store a lot of things in the POH and stash units so if a high level UIM did get wiped and didnt make it back in time to retrieve the items they would have to rebuild yes, but they would already have things like the ornate pool, occult altar, and whip stash unit which makes it a little bit easier. As well as having full void which is the easiest for them since they are limited on space for gear swaps/supplies.
---
I feel like I kind of rambled there so not sure how much sense that made.

Edit2: I just searched u/NotAugite, he is a legend who actually stands for what he believes, upvote him pls, even if he disagrees with some beliefs, he's the kind of person this sub needs.

MTX is like heroin for Jagex. It‚Äôll all feel better and worth it short term, but things will go to shit quicker, nor is it the right solution for a long term solution
---
So what? Not everything has to be profitable. Do we need to add monetary rewards to castle wars too?
---
You got it bro!! If I can you can

Did this really go over your head?

Thats actually really really close to what i have. I'm around 74atk, 73 str 70 def 56 pray, 79 range and 78 hp. You can do it, just watch a few vids and go for it

Looks better and more consistent with other boots.

Then he can go for b2b pets :)

I would prefer 2008 hd over 2011. I hated the updated scimitar models and new attack animations after the july 2009 update.

Bludgeon at gargoyles unless you want to pray in dharoks. Dharoks starts being better than obsidian at 92hp if youre training in nmz.
---
I started doing gargs at 80/80/80. You should also slay to get your stats up as you go since you need 75 slayer anyways
---
Don't think that'll be coming anytime soon with his Bernie Sanders problem
---
Eh, sure we perceive it differently if the loot calculation uses a subtable vs not, but either way the chances are the same.
---
i hope it gives agility xp
---
Yeah also thinking about trying for my first fire cape.. care to post your stats?

Don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôve done that many clues without going to Varrock range shop and talking to Lowe, select the 4th option ‚Äúdo you know of an upgrade to these snakeskin boots?‚Äù

I think majority of rs3 still doesn't quit because they might feel like they wasted their money if they already spent to much on it

ok buddy

Don‚Äòt we already have MTX? You can buy bonds with money and sell them for gp. Thats MTX for me.
---
Not to mention that the exp in the 90s is higher than at Ardougne.
---
Is this bait
---
I do agree that it's odd that it's split I cant tell you how often I have hesitate to find the tab I need which potential causes a lot of problems. It would be nice if you could filter it like the spellbook

It's reddit.

I get flashbacks to 'nam

Redditor with too much time on his hands posts facebook drama including personal info on reddit, gets called out instead, gets banned. Classic.

Go pking duh

They've said on stream recently that they would look into lowering the slayer point cost, but who knows when that might happen?  Something to consider.
---
I like your $11 signature, cool art.

I learned vetion since I got a slayer task (just did a 3 vetion task) I was naked with a slayer helm, bludgeon, and slave ammy. I got pked about 6 times all by different people. Took me 35min. So I salute you and you luck and that kc. That place is literal aids.
---
What would even be the end goal of that account? A big part of the reason Swampletics (and, to a lesser extent, Verf's Karamja locked UIM) is so popular is because he's working towards one of the most difficult pieces of PVM content in the game. With the desert, there's basically nothing to do there, so a desert locked UIM would just be working towards what, killing the Kalphite Queen? That's not nearly as interesting as someone working towards TOB or the Inferno.
---
It's "making friends with my arm" btw unlocked during the boss fight. I'm pretty confident you were searching for the track for the clue
---
There is an Arceuus spell that lets you teleport to your respawn point. He was fairly clearly asking if there was a way to make tele tabs for this spell. There isn't.
---
summer is right, a Ring of returning does what you want, but no, you can't make tele tabs for the spell.

i would hate working at this gym

Why are you so obsessed with cannoning shit
---
How exactly would it be possible to make pking a consistent money make for all pkers of all pvp skill levels without being botted or boosted by gold farmers like BH and LMS is right now? In pvming, Jagex can do this because they have total control over how hard the boss is. In pvp, Jagex cannot guarantee a minimum level of difficulty a pker has against another pker. One of them can just take a dive to the other.

The more inputs are split between thumbs the better the experience. It would be more like F keys if they were split like this.

First of all, I was not being all too serious in my post.

That out of the way tho. KQ with desert only, sounds like a challenge tbh, not too many good items come to mind in the area. Like maybe a miniseries level of challenge.

Even if it was just an ocean border that went into the abyss it would be fine with me...

That or an endless desert... you keep moving further and further in... but you dont go anywhere, or it gets hotter and hotter drying up your water skins and damaging you...

You could go out there... but you would definately die quickly

Yes. Just look up a beginners guide on youtube.

Wow, and you imagine being the first person in OSRS history to return to Tutorial Island?

I think BH should have skill brackets of some sort, maybe based on K/D or total BH kills.

More Die Hard memes please

Oldschool is more successful than even Jagex or anyone else was expecting it to be. And if you watched the very short clip from MatK, you‚Äôd know *why* Jagex ‚Äúshut down‚Äù 2006scape‚Äîwhat they were doing was illegal.

Some people have to experience being scammed ourselves, to learn about it. It's like when our parents tell us not to eat too many sweets or cake because it will make you hyper, or fat, or bad teeth etc.. some life lessons we have to experience before we can learn. I know it's hard to stand by and watch, you can try and help give guidance, but some people just need to learn through the experience to have a memory and emotion attached to it. Learning about liars and manipulation via a game is a good way to get them more cautious IRL.  
---
Do your best to help them, but some people only learn through experiencing it themselves.
---
Go into multi parts of the wild on any Saturday or Sunday. There are clan battles in the wild every weekend.

If you're dumb enough to fall for any scam then you deserve it. I wish there were more scammers in the game tbh

Indeed. Subtables are completely irrelevant when it comes to independent probability.

what if i wanted to buy over the ge limit?

Two hours? That‚Äôs adorable. I think you meant two decade, 8 hour daily  marathon premiere of a guy chopping trees. You get to the slightly more colorful trees in day 1 tho, so enjoy the other nineteen years, 364 days of chopping the same tree.

Oh god what have I done with my life

after a certain time you cant stack any more resources, and the npcs tell you 'the storage rooms are full and ready to be collected. so its the max loot.

Keep going brother. PKing was always a dream for me when I started.

Got into pking... would lose 10 fights before I won 1.

My advice would be dong be afraid to safe a little. I‚Äôm. Not saying eat to full, but just work on timing of eating and don‚Äôt hesitate because you might go a little over the ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù And just keep fighting my guy.

Don't worry,  I'm fully aware that there isn't a separate boot table. Just an unavoidable/irrational feeling of disappointment when you get the wrong ones lol. Also kinda ironic how out of all the uniques, sandals happen to be the one I have the most of. Big ol' kick in the balls

I get what you‚Äôre trying to say, but the probabilities of those scenarios are not the same.

Getting a 1/5000 drop on kc 5001:

(1/5000)*(4999/5000)^5000 = 0.00736%

Getting a 1/10000 drop on kc 10001:
---
(1/10000)*(9999/10000)^10000 = 0.00368%

The formula is (drop rate)*(odds of not getting the drop)^kc ^dry

13 sandals in log 14 in inventory

Hmmmmmmm

They are not the same thing.  Player vs Player means that the two players are fighting each other.  Both are engaged in the activity.  Player Killing means that one player is killing other players whether they do anything about it or not.
---
That's like saying that the school bully is the equivalent of a street fighter.  They'll beat up the weak kids for lunch money, but they're not there to actually fight anyone who fights back.  They're only there to leech off of anything they can without risking anything at all.
---
And yeah, PKers are nothing but a bunch of bullies who never grew the fuck up.  No skills and no brains, but sure as hell want to feel like they're superior to others.  PKers should not be rewarded.

Jagex tends to pay attention to feedback, and a lot of people feel the same way. Hopefully next year we get a desert expansion, maybe with some new minigames, dungeons, bosses, or even raids 3.

just wait to kill him for his next ring or pick

What drugs you on bud
---
Dooe name btw
---
Yeh but you'll find some people only complaint "ugh that could have been ranger boots!" When they roll any of the other boots. When in fact if you roll *any* unique, it "could have been" rangers. Everything is the same rate, but every item bar one isn't what you're looking for. So you got a 250/251 chance to be disappointed and say "could have been".
---
Nothing, I see wrong in non purely cosmetic, enhancing a game mode, the rewards offered here give both damage and prayer bonuses over your opponent. 
---
Even if it is purely cosmetic, it‚Äôs only in a dead minigame. This won‚Äôt bring people back to it.
---
We‚Äôre talking about a runescape account and a reddit account username. With both of those you are more likely to have your account compromised in the case of a data breach on anything that which shares either your reddit name or rs username.

Then they can potentially find your email and if you have used passwords multiple times they can get into your email and log in to various places it‚Äôs used

If you know how Have I been pwned works then you‚Äôll understand.

Desert is so dead, we need that

It's still pretty fascinating the huge disparity in what boots you've rolled. Like comparing your rangers luck to your other boots.. pretty shitty but not unreal. Comparing it to your sandals? Holy!

Same with the dragon defender step on master clues. I only had an avernic so I had to spend 2 hours killing cyclopes for a duplicate defender just for one clue step.
---
I was considering making a pure but then after using the beta worlds I realized that pure edge pking with the msb/AGS/gmaul combo is basically staking with a bit of skill lol. Who ever sees a big ranged xp drop first then goes for the ags will win most of the time.. Or you just stand there combo eating constantly while getting hit for constant 10-15s against someone with d knives and then you just send a hailmary ags/gmaul and can end up htting 90+ damage lol

Maybe flesh crawlers in the stronghold?

Why is he only watching when he can give me a hand?

Congratz mate !

I have both bedsheet colours stored in my bank just because
---
Okay, romeo.
---
I mean... No it isn't. There isn't a single cosmetic override in this game.
---
There are ornament kits, definitely. And that can be a little bit confusing for certain jewelery pieces and such. But for armour and weapons it's often just a golden trim etc. Very much within old-school realm as rune(g) and similar exists.
---
The only worry in this regard I have at all is that by this time next year there's going to be 3 recolours for max game armour, multiple slayer helm recolours, different teleport animations and more all coming from a tradeable cosmetic shop that only generates items by playing a time limited season mode.
---
4 item with protect item, and then budget gear to make up the rest.
---
could try gargoyles with row
---
70 def 65 defense?
---
Market or north gate.  There's an altar and bank right next to them so it's pretty chill
---
You underestimate how many people quit from Mtx riddling RS3. The game itself is quite alright, especially with the rollbacks from full EOC combat. It's less grindy than osrs for sure but has a different vision than that. But the fact that if you play anything but ironman there's just buyable XP and angel wings and particle effects everywhere definitely deters.
---
Looks like something they‚Äôd do in RS3
---
Herbs &gt; GP on an ironman. Even if not the most efficient, its better than having that much gp and no herbs. P
---
I've gotten a few bonds via Google Rewards, or whatever it's called. Pretty neat
---
Depends what you're fighting. Probably dhide/karils depending whether you need pray bonus and melee def or mage def
---
Except the only reason Swampman made a region locked Ironman in Morytania is because they added a Taste of Hope which was a continuation of the Myreque quest series and a Theater of Blood.
---
They clearly had planned to finish off the Vampyre quest series before Swampman made an extremely popular Youtube series, they aren't going to stop just because he doesn't want content. That's why the next quest will once more follow the same steps as RS3's Branches of Darkmeyer just as a Taste of Hope was similar to Legacy of Seergaze.
---
I don't think that was the point I was addressing....

You realize pkers have killed green dragon killers, agility trainers, and clue hunters the entire existence of the wild right? People just have a platform to cry about it where they won‚Äôt get ridiculed like you would have on Zybez.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm waiting for a task before i give them an honest attempt. Funny enough i had black demons task when i did the quest but from Konar. So i got the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre at the wrong place‚Äù message when i killed them

Block highest weighted tasks you hate doing ?

gonna incorporate this line into foreplay from now on

You're not hitting the 4 hour limit, right?

It‚Äôs funny how it‚Äôs non-pvpers always saying PvP is in a bad state lmao. Like we get it you can‚Äôt pk, move along.

Not every skill *has* to be fast. And to answer OP's question, RC was way worse to begin with when people didn't have the luxury of glories being dirt cheap like they are now and when stamina's didn't exist.

That‚Äôs because mobile supports 60+ FPS while the actual game caps at 50fps
---
inflation in osrs isnt a real issue
---
Looks like I deserve an addy kite
---
That's actually hilarious considering they probably just sat on their hands at Zeah to 99. Meanwhile the actual meta for training the skill is lava runners which is absolute cancer imo, due to the insane cost and the hassle of organizing runners. I'd welcome new methods that make training the skill solo actually viable and at least competitive with duo lavas.
---
Solid effort, nice commitment to the costume!
---
It does
---
In all honesty, what ruined pking for the majority isn‚Äôt the rewards ect, it‚Äôs that you basically need a specialised account or maxed combat to be anywhere near competitive. 
---
No one likes to play to constantly lose when there is still no reward for losing. 
---
Back in the day everyone would just pk and special builds were not really a thing.
---
Denver actually.
---
Gz @@@@@@@@@@@@
---
It's really not, the majority of my old clan used Exilient, and a ton of solo pkers on my friends list do as well.
---
If you want to have any chance at high stakes pvp or clan pvp, it's pretty much necessary to use it right now. 
---
Gotta fight fire with fire, unfortunately.

nah there's been 2 so far

2014 and 2017 so maybe in 2020

Who really does guardians though when gargoyles are better. Unless you're hunting uniques or pet.
---
Grats man! I talked to you a bit in seers back a few weeks back, you still considering learning TOB?
---
The only MTX I would consider allowing would be armour recolour but that's it.
---
It was an estimate based off of the clan chats I'm in, but I was actually being conservative. If you consider the amount of people that lie about whether or not they use it, it's probably higher.
---
It's a free cheat client that isn't being banned. Obviously people are using it.

No thanks. I actually like very much the way BCP currently looks on female characters.

RS3 without crazy MTX = 40k players. (Jan 2013)
---
RS3 with crazy MTX = 17k players. (today)
---
20% (RS3 players) of subs = 14% of their revenue compared to the 30% that's brought in through MTX. Almost half the money made is from RS3/MTX and the MTX makes the RS3 revenue triple of what it would be without it. 
---
Losing half the income on one source to make it back double on another method? No brainer.

Well there are shot glasses so...

You probably don‚Äôt have barrows gloves.

the fact he baited when it was actually armadyl dhide is hilarious
---
&gt; The pvm droptables I think will be part of the (eventual) death of the game.
---
This needs to be balanced out with item sinks, like what RS3 has with Invention. Yet we voted against them.
---
No it doesn't any longer. It has an updated model,  [https://runescape.wiki/w/File:Black\_Knight\_Titan\_(updated).png](https://runescape.wiki/w/File:Black_Knight_Titan_(updated).png) 
---
It was the ancient osrs model for a long time though.
---
Way more gold comes into the game than is removed by the duel arena tax. Jmods confirmed this. The value of gold is still slowly decreasing as a result of inflation.

If you had a dollar, would you spend 50 cents to immediately make back another dollar?

Getting poisoned on the way to charge earth orbs.

I know that you can do airs at 66 but I've been running earths in the meantime and it sucks.
---
Thanks man!
---
I completely agree. I remember back in the day, when the first person ever to make Rune 2h's got the level requirement, they were selling them for 700k. That amount back then I would say is equivalent to buying d claws today. A second person came along and started selling them for 400k, then Zezima came in to save us and only asked 100k each. Eventually more and more people got the level requirement and now they sit at alch value.
---
Also, if you needed something specific like 10k feathers to do some fly fishing, well your ass had to go kill chickens for a few hours because no one stood around selling feathers. Or you would make a post on the forums and hope whoever selling them wasnt asking something like 20gp each.

Why does Jagex never address these pvp issues? Are they catering to pvp clans now?
---
They definietly do
---
I wasn't talking about money
---
There's a few reasons this could happen, but they all boil down to someone's greed taking precedence over the game's well-being. 
---
When a strategy looks like "cashing out", it probably is. Executives could believe that a product is on its last legs and that they may as well milk it before it dies, introducing MTX to really wring dry a game in its death throes. Alternatively, it might be the exit strategy of one or a few individuals - got a cushy executive job one or two levels below CEO? Suggest a "revolutionary" alternative revenue model, collect a fat bonus when your strategy "works", and then retire or jump ship to a new company before it all goes to shit.
---
There's also the problem of unnecessary redesigns, frequently seen in rhe software world and I still firmly believe that's the bucket EOC falls into.
---
Have you ever opened an app or website you're used to using only to discover that the UI is *totally* different and fucked beyond recognition? Example, Hulu's current user interface. These happen because some busybody in an executive or managerial role is looking to make a name for themselves. They pitch this "awesome" redesign/overhaul that sounds great on paper and lead the whole project, moving to a different/higher position in the company or to another company entirely afterwards. The reality of the situation is that the work was unnecessary and stupid, but that doesn't affect them. They get to have a nice little bullet point on their resume and their LinkedIn about how they "brought an app's old UI into the modern age" or "pioneered a redesign of the outdated user experience".
---
I don't have any proof of it, but I really do think there's a group of awfully bourgeois busybodies at Jagex or elsewhere in the UK who are *still* reaping the career benefits of throwing RS2 in the trashcan.
---
Then pay $11 and quit your bitching.
---
Sure like I said after a while people will quit. I started in 02 and stopped after they removed free trade. It's going to take a while before it crashes though.
---
RS3, or HD OSRS
---
Found the salty one
---
Just hide attack options and pick the stack up. Drop anything you don't want elsewhere.
---
It's not fun but it works.
---
You're right I do not. I wear Ferocious gloves instead.
---
This doesn‚Äôt show anything apart from your kc?
---
As someone who took dead on 3200kc to get a whip, they will come... eventually.
---
I think it‚Äôs just the history of the skill. It wasn‚Äôt in the original line up of skills and rune supply became way less saturated for the player base than it was used to with classic. When it came out with RS2 being able to make runes was quite powerful. I think it‚Äôs xp gain was tailored to that. Sure, runes are way easier to obtain now but it‚Äôs historically a slow skill and because of that a very prestigious one. Personally even tho I‚Äôd love to have it be faster, I‚Äôd rather it stayed in it‚Äôs gruelling form.
---
I'm wearing a ring of wealth, so the nature talisman should have been a slightly lower drop rate than the mask..
---
Money, people, same thing to Jagex. They don't care if people leave if the people that stay pay more than what the people that left paid.
---
i‚Äôm talking about all the other stuff. this could not have come from the collection log because the collection log does not track normal drops. you‚Äôre being an ass for no reason
---
Osrs is way more community-driven
---
For ranged and bossing too? Flex.
---
I did fight caves on the beta world to mess around with tbow, and got baby jad on 1 kc ;(
---
Yes they are

So what you‚Äôre saying is... I can do heroine to help me get thru short term projects but should stay away from it if it involves anything long term?
---
You ever sell them for uhhh.. favors...? 
---
Asking for a friend

TBH I still don't really get it. Killing 150 Dagganoth is no different from killing 150 trolls/ankou/hellhounds/etc. The monster has a different name, but it's the same thing. At that point, you can just say switch up zmi with zeah, combo runes, or abyss rc for just as much variety, while making more money and getting better xp/h, and also actually doing what you want instead of having to report to a slayer master and move locations every 15 minutes, interrupting your training.
---
The only variety in slayer is boss slayer, but at that point you're getting minimal XP/h so you might as well just go and kill the bosses you want to kill off-task...
---
It‚Äôs full of minerals.
---
F2P accounts
---
No, its a fox.
---
Because if they tried to make it any faster everyone would complain easyscape and vote no to (pvp) updates
---
Changing death mechanics is something that would be terrible for the game, and especially for Ironmen.
---
With the stats I figured he'd bond one to play, it isn't a f2p pure
---
And revenue would increase far more than that. I doubt it would be as high as 25%. They won't start with buying advantages.
---
It's 2019 can you swear like a normal human being?
---
I don't know why architects do this kind of stuff sometimes.
---
I've gotten double Wrath drops twice while under 100kc reeeeeeeeeee
---
Killing bosses off task is like 25% lower dps though. It's really all subjective anyway so it doesn't matter.  I hate rc because I constantly have to bank, I'm chugging my limited staminas, and it's bad xp/hr. I don't mind slayer, even regular melee slayer, because at the same time I am getting drops (some of which can be valuable/useful) and a lot of cb xp.
---
It‚Äôs 2019 being gay is acceptable... it‚Äôs okay buddy
---
Haven‚Äôt you spent enough time with the rocks?
---
Bank your items.
---
Iv gambled 40+ and no pet all task
---
I mean.. it isn't.
---
Back in my days, I was making flax runs in Camelot making 300k an hour. Obby capes were 250k, whips were 4.5M, all that flax running paid off. Now it‚Äôs a joke.
---
Yes it is...
---
How about this, instead we buy jagex from china and when we are all shareholders, we get that fairy ring.
---
No I‚Äôm not. Praying mage ONLY PROTECTS FROM THE REGULAR DRAGONFIRE FROM KBD. Since you aren‚Äôt aware, kbd has 4 different types of fire; ice, poison, shock and regular. Antifire potions and praying magic can protect you full from the regular, but not the other 3. Praying mage does nothing, even with super anti fires. Antifire shield helps reduced the damage from shock, ice and poison, but not fully. That‚Äôs why you still get hit 15‚Äôs when it uses those breathes.
---
But please, don‚Äôt take my word for it though, please go and test it out! There‚Äôs a big big reason why people don‚Äôt blowpipe kbd. Go and try it with praying mage, I‚Äôm just trying to save people‚Äôs time.

Zaros gang rise up

Are there any vpns or rerouting services that work for OSRS to optimise ping? I know of stuff like exist but i think it only supports rs3
---
Lol get fucked OP
---
It's not though. Slayer easily exceeds 70k/hr on many of the good tasks, with some going much higher. And to maintain 70k/hr on RC long term is painful.
---
Didnt ask
---
You‚Äôll soon learn to blank out EVERYTHING in sight üòã
---
imo 2008 models looked more hd than the overpolished eoc models
---
As some have figured out yea it's from a discord bot and not real items
---
Yes on some tasks. Overall unless you had unlimited points, slayer averages out to around 50k an hour.
---
Google the name and click the link to join the discord server.
---
&gt;No file by this name exists.
---
oh nevermind the parenthesis just fuck up reddits link, my god that's hideous
---
I find the lag in the dungeon to be so annoying
