Gonna piggyback on this - what are people's block list for duradel? Got all my points saved to block but hearing differing things from different people.
---
---
---
that youtube link is dead. what was it?
---
I was given 300 lobsters and mithral gear and some advice on where to farm and get food. I'm gonna stay away from getting too far ahead too early because that's not any fun.
---
I heard Mr Beast is the stripper for Mod Ash’s bachelor party
---
So knowing someone who's banned is a bannable offense now?

1143 kc 6 cores no pet
---
Very clean family
---
I was there when Anyless got his firecape
---
Nice
---
I'm good with the amount of time I've already dumped into this account lol. Dont have the time for a new account. Never gonna catch me grinding quests/stats again son
---
WHat about the Construction skillcape?
---
I think it's to hide his dent.
---
That a dds cursor? Nice. Do they still come with free viruses?
---
If you don’t play anymore, then how do you know what the clowns are doing
---
&gt;	I’m not asking you to do that though, I’m trying to convince you (and anyone reading this) to push for more balancing for the official client.
---

---
Do you really not think that everyone would encourage jagex to improve their client? People have been asking for years lmao, and there’s literally no way you could’ve made that connection out of your first few posts. Jagex isn’t going to improve their client while free alternatives are out that keep players around. 
---
&gt;	Have you tried raiding extensively on mobile for example? Have you tried one ticking bones on mobile or the official client? have you tried 3 tick+drop on mobile? If you have, youd know there's clear issues between the vanille, mobile and runelite.
---
No and why would I? I know it isn’t feasible and there’s only so many people who strictly play mobile only. If you’re playing on mobile your connection is going to be a bigger issue. I’m sure people can 1/3t on mobile if they want to but if you’re that serious about OSRS you’re probably going to play more on a desktop or laptop, with access to runelite.
---
Na
---
I'm not sure if I believe your story
---
Yea someone did this to me once as a kid.  I sold it lmao ez 30k
---
This. So much sarcasm
---
lmfao this sub man
---
Presuming guilt based on association isn’t silly bud.
---
If you wanna flex on noobs, give them bonds not free items.
---
Yeah what you have right there will last till you need gear upgrades into adamant and eventually rune. But if you decide to ever bite the bullet and go members there is so much variety in things to do its nearly impossible to get too far ahead too soon
---
Just get 99s in NMZ and do bgloves whenever you need it. Will be easy and take you 2-3 months
---
This is funny and all but this dude watermarked a fucking meme LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
I literally just got a pet at 66 agility a few days ago. Congrats!
---
I was vanilla you until about last week when the whole connection issue thing was happening. I downloaded RL because it connected when vanilla wouldn’t.
---
Honestly the best things about RL to me is the map icons (shows teleports/quest icons change depending on status/etc) and the smooth animation options. The clue solver is nice but I could 100% live without it. Jagex wouldn’t have to do much in my opinion to pull their client up far enough to make a vast majority of users happy.
---
? Wut
---
I got that one Same kc too!
---
Yep!
---
Someone giving away cabbages at GE in W393 yesterday. Everyone surrounded him calling scam. He didn’t want to see anything in your inv, didn’t care what level or gear. Just a simple free cabbage.
---
Nobody was talking about using Konar though.
---
Because raids are the most challenging content. It makes sense they have the best rewards.
---
Inflation with all these bots. Gold prices has been steadily dropping that's why you see bonds have been going up. Pretty much doubled since I started playing again. Jagex releasing all these things that are being exploited by bots. Zalcano, bh2, Rev caves and Lms are being botted.
---
Mol
---
It took me 1400. I suddenly down feel so bad
---
I have government health insurance in the United States. i think its pretty good. Much better than any private plan I've paid for.
---
why shouldn't people be able to choose between a public or private option?
---
Its always given you a chat box dialogue asking you to re log in to fulfill bonds...
---
i'm actually looking for help in this quest.... In game name is 'Ded not Dead'
---
LF a Phienix Gang member
---
any help would be appreciated.
---
this hurts..
---
Because they've been doing the exact same shit for over 10 years.
---
Don't even have neck noob
---
I usually take 200-300k during peak times into F2P and hand out 5-10k so some newer players that are still learning. A little GP boost to them but nothing major to anybody else. Only ever had 1 person get angry and demand more. Some even ask advice on how to best spend the newly acquired gp best for their stats and plans.
---
Nah they change it up every couple of years
---
Nope, that one was changed. Finished the questline a couple months ago and was relieved when I saw the Wiki mention that.
---
&gt;  I along with everyone else who works for their insurance like having choice and not relying on the government to decide what healthcare that my family gets.
---
In universal healthcare you know you can still pay for treatment right?  And yes, it is the "daddy governments" responsibility to take care its citizens.   Glad you are well off, but that doesnt mean everyone is and you dont seem to give a shit, but some people do.
---
Those heads and seeds tho
---
Was the first thing I found online for working on attack lmao, I've done about 25 quests though and I'm progressing pretty well. It's not my first MMO so I have a rough idea of what to do.
---
Probably because if you're on the public option, you don't make enough money to have the choice anyways, so someone else is footing the bill
---
I mean, I gave this about 5 seconds of thought before posting, but you just get tele'd to a random part of wildy singles with a timed window of safety.
---
Sounds about right
---
If you roll 6 red die or 1 of each red, blue, green, orange, yellow, and purple die you're equally likely to get any given number.
---
once you get things figured out and get a decent baseline there's a membership trial going on, once you get that going I always like to start with getting all the Recipe For Disaster quest requirements complete and that'll have your account at a really nice start 
---
THEN GET RIGOUR AND BLOWPIPE AND WIN THE GAME
---
I think the fact that the community eagerly awaits ”smack-down” threads implies that there is broad recognition of this tactic. Have a little faith in the community.
---
I've already got a membership, games pretty fun and I've been working on quests for the past few days inbetween afk farming rock crabs while doing homework. Ty for the advice tho
---
Fuck I think I’m Phoenix gang? I need to get it done too.  Are you on?
---
Came with it trimmed already haha. I think he wanted to give me a small gp boost for when I probably sell it, gonna keep the shield tho as a souvenir.
---
Thats not true. I'm eligible for other reasons. 
---
But i think we've found the problem. You don't like any forms of welfare, not just healthcare. 
---
There is no reason a private and public option can't compete in the same market.
---
Call the cops you dense fuck. At least they’ll be stopped.
---
If you do even half of your boss tasks to 99 slayer you are going to make 100s of mils while never having to worry about getting pked. Normal slayer is definitely better
---
How dare you insult baby Yoda by comparing him to that ugly ass pale sob.
---
Awesome thank you! 
---
How many points would you say for that?
---
eat my shit
---
Ooh okay, I'll be sure not to give out my tinfoil armor lol
---
If you have varrock diaries done, save your battle staves. Good crafting xp, even after selling or alching the air battlestaff you still make a small profit because the battlestaves have a good discount
---
Totally agree it looks disgusting
---
During slayer it's better considering pray will block out all dmg for most tasks anyways.
---
For a good amount of pvm content it is better especially if you have good defense elsewhere (ring of suffering, bis armor, etc)
---
You won't get banned if you aren't doing anything wrong. :)
---
The next league won't be twisted league Again
---
Yeah right 1m isn’t going to ruin anyone’s fun, if anything it will get him excited to play.  Not everyone has burned the game out so hard they need to start a btw and pretend any help from other players is a bad thing, guarantee 95% of people would be very excited and be more inspired to play.
---
This. If you wear a ring of wealth the chance is greatly lowered, if not zero.
---
Pshh, u dirty duper.
---
The new weapons and armour don't appear on the calcs
---
If you include the time it takes to run to the obelisk it's not really fantastic gp or xp. Great early game for some cash but no real point later unless you have 80 agility for the shortcut.
---
No I think you have to use a keepsake token on it or whatever before you hit your 2nd 99
---
If you know their stats you can manually add them
---
Thanks, I see how they did it now. Although it's pretty stupid that they have it in one format on the website and a different format in the game. You can see how it would look like everything failed at first glance.
---
Very cute, yeah
---
oldschool.runescape.wiki
---
Your viewpoint and evidence for it are both wrong though. The issues with third party clients have gone back years, and jagex spoke with the runelite developer over a year ago to get the client restructured to make it jagex approved. So while silence isnt permission, speaking with the dev and saying "okay the clients good now for public use" is permission to use it.
---
Gz bro
---
I’d take em off your hands for free😅
---
As long as we're giving out unsolicited advice,  the Cardinal rule is to always be on your guard when dealing with other players. People have perfected the art of scamming on this game. If something seems too good to be true, it 100% is.
---
Happy to have you in the game! 
---
I’d say iverall the community is pretty good. Ignore the shut heads trying to give you a hard time about anything.
---
Don’t worry about being the most efficient methods. Just have fun and enjoy it
---
This is the way.
---
there is nothing funny about Mr.Mammal's clan killing me :/
---
Congrats brotha
---
that's like level 40 content like i just said tho (38 is similar to 40) and he'd have to start from scratch because as i understand he is a non member
---
I'm laughing at you. You're the one with the low IQ to stI'll being posting 2005 pictures in the current year. excuse yourself from the gene pool please LOL
---
I haven't logged in, in a while, but i think i have something like.. 128k light orbs in my bank. Forever waiting for the day when they're made stackable and tradeable so i can sell them all to a general store.
---
That was myfault im not good at spelling lol
---
The couple times I have had to deal with support it has worked fine for me.
---
being in combat you will still log out if you don't have any inputs.. this is exactly why splashing will afk log you now instead of 6 hours of splashing...
---
Have nothing better to do bud? That’s fine I’ll entertain
---
How the shit do you get 2.5m gp though.
---
They might - if they choose to lock themselves out of having melee as an attack style, I am fine with that.  Currently they don't have to.  Thank you for illustrating why an attack requirement is limiting.
---
They are unnotable, am I wrong? Otherwise I would chuck em in the GE.
---
I do use runelite. How can I check?
---
Completely disagree with you there. Zalcano is most definitely crowded and finding an open group is not always easy, the boss is flooded with gold farmers. And if you try to join as a 5th you get flamed to high hell.
---
Baby Yoda has seen some better days
---
By the looks of those bananas; I don't blame you.
---
I mean you literally do spend your life on this subreddit to the point that you remember names and have this weird 'gollum gollum' attachment to people so this is hardly a deflection that works for you.
---
Yes. Orbs don't cost much at all if you sell them. Battlestaves aren't much more expensive to do than rubies, but they take a lot of capital.
---
Have I ever seen a 99 attack 1 strength account type in pvp? No, and you haven't either.
---
Because not giving evidence as a blanket for all bans does not teach people lessons and cause them to change it just causes then to create new accounts and break rules more because it doesn't matter anymore. Specific cases are totally understandable but that doesn't seem to be the norm for companies nowadays. This is probably an understandable case but it's an important detail that is left out of view. First thing I would do with a perma ban is bot and sell gold. There are consequences for a company's actions that you don't see and it needs to be mentioned. Bans  without evidence are relevant 100% of the time.
---
No way I got it super early. Not even triple rate!
---
I gotten permed before cause i had "shady friends", just pming them and trading them constitute enough for a perm ban. Well, at least in eoc servers.
---
Maybe same applies in this 07 scape ?

probably something something spaghetti.
---
a junkie? thats pretty fucked up dude.
---
Yeah the only thing that puts me off of orbs is having to do 60k of them from 81-90 lol.
---
Thank you! I’ve watched so many people come and go. Feels good to be off the island for a change :)
---
Actually I did orbs to 85 and then cut amethyst to 90. I forgot.

Re-watch it again, he just moved from the left to the right, he didn’t fall.. that’s a chair.

I was looking Into that to, 85-90 was 34k arrow tips. But one amethyst is 3.3k.
---
You also have no prnt scrn button

lol +55 slash and no offhand? hope those cows don't put up a fight

your name is accurate based on your comments, welcome to the internet

Any TL walkers take the clue scroll relic for their t4? I'm not sure if I should take it or the konar relic.

Yeah shame on op for sharing as much information as possible
---
Woox showed that raids can be soloed in the shittiest gear and stats. Personally, I find Zulrah more challenging than olm or any of the room bosses in CoX.
---
Bootz
---
No even for ironmen this stuff is not a grind and almost all of it is passively gained and unlocked
---
is he also the guy that says hell change his name legally to rendi if he hits 1m subs? lol ty for that reply btw funny to see him do that
---
Is there a way to get rid of those faster or am I just stuck with 25k+ light bulbs in my bank forever?
---
Just login with the credentials you made on your phone it's the same account
---
Any reason to why Zulrah is more popular than Vorkath when it is way harder, less money, requires more gear?
---
nja?
---
Yep. It’s devices older than the 6s. 6s is probably next iPhone launch. But Apple will start more rapidly stop supporting phones because people aren’t upgrading enough
---
If I recall correctly, it was one dude who was particularly ass at his job and essentially just accumulated a year+ of prize failures. Acorn seems to be coming into these threads now and always solves it in a day. She seems to be acing her role as community manager.
---
What kind of summer camp did you go to....
---
The guy was also super chill with this response he was like yeah makes sense now
---
I mean he’s already on the subreddit so I assume he can use the wiki too it’s not like he’s a random noob in game just exploring the world
---
ILM really upping their CG budget here

Try on pc. Easy fix

Eh idk man, all of their phones seem to be supported for at least 5 years, which is awesome to me as I’m someone who holds onto a phone for a while
---
Cuz I spent $100 on a game that I've played for 15 years one time? K
---
Hmm I’m doing amethyst arrow tips to 99. Currently almost 92. To 99 I’m not losing that much money and it’s about 140-150k an hour
---
Used to be a "cat vs laser pointer" simulator ..
---
jagex has some of the worst management of any company ever
---
Doing it straight after would be a terrible idea. Most people who went hard will be burnt out and want to get back to their goals in the main game. Also, people watching content on YT / Twitch are already starting to get bored with TL. I can't see why you'd want to rush straight in to another season; I personally hope it's done once every 6-12 months. If it's too frequent then there's no way I'd engage with it that much, because it takes away from the main game too much.
---
Hey Jagex I volunteer to take a plane to Jagex HQ and drop the prize off at the nearest post office for you. You guys clearly have a lot on your hands so it's the least I could do. Heck, I'll even put the prize *IN* the box.

---
Big ups to Jesus
---
Skr8 up*
---
This is a game not a courtroom. Jagex is not obligated to show you.
---
umm... did you bring your own box?
---
This reminds me, have those people who expected the canvas bag from fallout 76 gotten their actual canvas bag yet? They got a nylon one which sparked a ton of outrage and I think I remember hearing Bethesda say that they pretty much bit the bullet and started making the canvas bags anyway even though they were "too expensive" and last I heard it was months after they had said that not a single person had gotten the canvas bag yet (except the influencers from before the games launch that is)
---
I would change their hue and lower their stats to zero. Same with the pets.
---
Gz, solo?
---
One-off tasks just sound like diaries, which are aids to do and inefficient, running back and forth, getting the items over and over, just so you can do 1 thing and leave. No grind, just pure endurance gang content... On second thought, endurance GANG, support. It'll be funny to see all the walkers, even if it'll be boring.
---
WHOLESOME.
---
/u/JagexAcorn hire me to be the prize sending dude please. Intern pay, and the entirety of my job is making sure contest winners get their prizes.
---
That was good. Ya almost had it at 5 but that random "lol" messed it up
---
Why does it sound like that?
---
Runelite virtual levels don't count.
---
They're also a developing country with all the issues that implies. The US being comparable to them in any way is a disaster.
---
Next time tag your arrows

1/741,600 Same chance as when you started mining copper and tin at lvl 1. Gz bro.

Hey I’ve been chillin in TL why the fuck is scythe 600M

I'll give you an upvote so I can see this jmod smackdown

Quest cape is a good short term goal. It will get you progression in just about every skill and give you access to useful transportation/money making/training methods.
---
I wish I would have started twisted on an alt. But now im a few thousand league points in and dont really want to start again this late.
---
i'm new to the game.  hi everyone!  someone gave my buddy (who's also new) 250k coins and a full set of rune stuff :o  that happens often?  is 250 alot?  someone gave me 5k! thanks for the generosity
---
How do you do the heart emoji?
---
Yeah, pretty sure they got them this summer. It's funny and depressing that Bethesda is better at sending out prizes to hundreds of people than jagex is at sending to just one person.
---
I have the puzzle solver disabled because i enjoy doing slide puzzles. Anagram clues are also fun, wish i could disable the helper for those and the cryptic ones. 
---
That being said coordinate clues are cancer so i keep it on.
---
11$ btw
---
lmao ridiculous
---
Precisely
---
&lt;3
---
I mean sure but comparing prossy to like monk robes is less than a 1% difference just as an example.
---
Your bad gear is holding them back way more than you being a pure.
---
Wouldn’t the better conspiracy be that the owners of Jagex have bots in game to sell the gold for more profit and too make player numbers seem higher, to then in turn make it look better to investors?
---
Sween replied on twitter apologizing and saying this wont happen again.
---

---
What should my stat goals be if I want to learn to do Zulrah?
---
spit on the false queen
---
I'm pickpocketing HAM people on my Ironman for Rusted Swords.
---
Do you need to sneak up on them and be behind them or does that not matter?
---
GG’s were the first ‘boss’ I ever actually killed that had a mechanic that wasn’t more complicated than ‘turn on prayer’.
---
I only have 500+ kills now and I fucking hate them, why does every kill have to take so long? I was going to go for pet, but I have 4 cores in those just over 500 kills. I gave up, now just do gargoyles when I get the task. Such a shame, because lots of the other bosses are too much for me, can’t get my head around zulrah, or be bothered to quest to vork.
---
lol I saw a cutie there a few hours ago selling feathers for 3gp each. had to admire his hustle.
---
And the prize
---
Being entitled is fine when you're actually entitled to something. You were promised something, you had every right to claim it.
---
Just finished this a few days ago. Good quest. 3 to go.
---
Funny from someone kept so in the dark.  There are clients that offer benefits outside of botting.
---
Any suggestions besides tbow/rapier? Anything else I can afford most likely
---
*cough* Stone *cough*

You are an android user because i see a dot in the middle of your sentence

yes, the yoke of employment and the daily grind do feel inescapable, don't they?
---
how dare you finish in november
---
It might be hard to find serious people to raid with. I imagine most of the people you find are people who don't care or do it casually and are more entertained with the idea of raiding with a pure rather than how well you do.
---
And to answer the question, yes you are holding them back but that's only a problem if they see it the same way.
---
How is this power creep, theres already a way to boost any stat
---
Buy a DHL over a rapier and then a dhcb loaded with Ruby dragon bolts e
---
Get collection log from varrock museum NPC.
---
probably should have had that on the post
---
Belittle him lol? It’s not like plenty of people have acted innocent and gotten proved heavily wrong here and elsewhere with these bans.
---
The most common drops will always be consumables. It is the same at ToB. You would be making all of the other items more common by reducing the scrolls.

Runefest was October 4th and 5th. Which almost certainly looks like the first 'spike', right to the left of your green spike. That's when the new Morty 'raids' content was teased/released. 
---
Entirely possible that the rise of the most sought out defensive shield is in anticipation for the new raids. It has had the same increase prior to Raids 2 and Raids 1.
---
Stone chests with chisel and string/needle for xeric robes is 50k/h at regular 5x xp. Gathering flax for bowstrings is also good exp and I think better than silver mining. Unless u have 3x gather I'd stone chest to 99 thieving for the 1.3m crafting exp.
---
Oh my, imagine Ash doing a perp walk... like a boss.
---
You know Runelite is used by almost everyone playing right? If we're at 80k people online it's easy to say atleast 70k are playing through runelite probably more.
---
99.9% of these threads the person definitely left out some key information. There's so many active bots out there false positives are pretty much a meme for internet points.
---
I saw the Michael video actually but hadn't considered that but I also feel like exploiting save states isn't really new information to the gaming community beyond OSRS. I wasn't trying to say that I think Rendi discovered the possibility for a dupe so much as he did publicize it.
---
However, the link between the Oct 3rd video and the beginning of the price gap forming is definitely one of the weaker points above. Regardless, I'm interested as to what you think causes the price gap to form in the first place if you have any guesses.
---
There aren’t many bug exploit bans handed out often. A MAJOR bug exploit was just fixed and all the other people performing/trying it just got banned as well but go ahead, defend him as much as you want. Each points goes right in line with everyone else.
---
Yeah idk how to do raids.. I've never done them and trying to learn from reading online is just confusing for me lmao idk
---
Is it really that hard to believe you got it?
---
Oi bugger off dik ed
---
Not sure I agree about either example. The way magic fang is attachable, uniques can be broken down, and scales are expensive makes a lot of sense to me. Further, the drops match the content really well (like lore wise and visually). I do agree though that we should spread them out.
---
And just to be blunt... This game would be ass without powerful items... 
---
Precedent of good bosses are: armor from bandos and kree while weapons from other two and chance at shards from all... Then shield, vial, and sigil from Corp... BIS rings and other stuff like d pick/axe from wildy bosses and DKs. Maybe have staff and mace or mace and armor.
---
The best thing I can say about this is that I can tell you worked really hard on it

Isn't it pretty much the same as the hand Cannon in rs2? I don't recall that being useful for pvm either but I quit around or before it came out
---
that's not the problem. the problem is getting an overload. you might not get the drop and obviously your teammates can't split it to you. olm itself is 4 brews at the VERY max and what.. 2 restores? there's no problem on that end

are you fucking kidding me?! ca we get some F's for my plague city only ironman. Worthless now....

This was without exploiting any unintended bugs.

You join a cc that you're ranked in, then go to the boards in front of the chambers. One of them has a button on the bottom to create a group, then you head into the chambers. You can figure it out from there
---
&gt;zeah has literally everything
---
Except agility courses
---
Samuel Biederman 🙊
---
It's good gp early game, but overall its not the best gp or xp per hour. If you like charging the orbs then go for it, but it's more efficient to train crafting and magic through other methods, and get gp through slayer, or other way faster ways.
---
Try Cerb or Sara. They'll will make you a better player. Jist do her till you get her. Theres 0 risk when you die. Id get tired of any boss if its the only boss i do.
---
Please keep the vanilla client and allow RuneLite to continue existing alongside it.
---
The vanilla client  has the single best UI for anyone starting the game for the first time. It only gives you the absolute base necessities to play the game and never gets in your way.
---
Having Jagex add additional options that are automatically toggled off will not accomplish the same thing as never having those options at all, nor will developing a second, "advanced" client. 
---
The first thing most if us ever do when we play a new game for the first time is fiddle with the options, and things like tile markers and entry-menu swappers may hinder a player's learning experience because these are options entirely different from any other MMO out there.
---
An advanced client will have the same problems stated above except Jagex will also need to spend additional time on updates to make both clients compatible, similar to how RuneLite has patches for new updates.
---
5? Fuck I do 4.
---
Waterfall quest will make
---
Is the amulet of fury actually worth it?
---
It doesn't ruin anything.
---
Yeah, you're probably right. I used the hc a ton in eoc, it was really fun actually
---
too op
---
W2 Brimhaven BAG
---
2k points lmfao
---
Just Take It
---
I will take your advice as soon as I can get back to playing! Taken a bit of a break - still paying for mems, cause the day I cancel that is the day I don’t come back!
---
Stolen joke from Bruce almighty
---
Honestly how hard is it to mail an excel spreadsheet with the information of each winner, what prize they won, if and when the prize was sent out. Seeing these posts are just mind boggling honestly.
---
Freaky forester's teleport was (I believe) removed, idk about bee man though.  Those teleports can just shatter artefacts on exit though.
---
If the instances would be removed, only 2 players can play Tithe farm each world. Now in the Twisted League, that will end in even more chaos.
---
You’re confusing the cabinet department called “Dept. of Homeland Security” with the broad umbrella term “the government” I think.
---
Must have taken you sooooooo long.
---
Yeah doesn't really matter what the nature of the punishment is, they still replied..
---
heh sucks to be you. Only took 1998 kc. Took a wee while though with bout 68 range and bone cbow.
---
Potential reward from the new nightmare boss that is not in the game yet. The rewards are being beta tested on the tournament worlds currently.
---
wasnt this known literally way before any of this? this all started cus of ice poseidon drop party liek 15 years ago
---
for the culture
---
it's coke bro
---
thanks ill finally get into swampletics land now
---
If there were no instances, just 2 players can play the Tithe farm game in each world, making it very hard to even play the game.
---
same :?
---
Do you want an animal revolution, because this is how we get an animal revolution
---
Okay but *how can he talk!?*
---
You get points for obtaining one, not FOR already having one.
---
You only use a scythe for TOB and all of us who do it are now playing TL.
---
if you don't win golden gnome i'll macro abuse major myself
---
Cus it was a long time ago and your memory of it is bad because of that.
---
Also, with runelite you can disable a lot of entry models. So when I’m fletching at the GE I’ll do that so it’s not constantly lagging or I misclick on someone instead of the bank. I usually have public turned off too. So the small majority like myself might seem like bots but really we just don’t want to be annoyed lol.
---
You're not. This staff will probably end up being ~100m 1 year after release.
---
You need 99 range and a craws bow, shooting 200gp ea ether for range to be good there. You can go for a quest, Family Crest, that increases max hit of bolt spells by 3. And then if you get 70 magic an occult necklace for 10% magic damage boost.
---
During monkey madness 2 or dragon slayer 2 I guessed what items I'd need, there were no quest guides yet. I got blamed by the NPC for reading quest guides. I felt sad and falsely accused...
---
I think everyone, including you, that is being suffering from this guy's action should collect proof and then email them to responsible individuals. Not devs, but others.
---
Fun fact if you die with an insured pet but dont claim it yet, rolling the pet again would result in the pet following you again.
---
I work in health care. Police aren't social workers. They're not trained properly to handle people in crisis situations. I've watched it happen.
---
So your opinion is cool and all but it's flat out wrong. I'm not surprised people (and children obviously) in this sub fail to have critical thinking capable of problem solving an actual life or death situation.
---
If you have a Samsung you can have two clients on one phone open at the same time fyi
---
Lol. Yeah letting ironmen be completely immune from crashing, while regular players have to do with it still totally makes sense for the "harder" game mode. 
---
In this scenario, a regular player is fighting in a multi zone and an Ironman lays down a cannon. Now the regular player cannot attack anything that has been hit by the Ironmans cannon ball, or by the Ironmans barrage. Yeah makes total sense.
---
Fun fact: last hit got the loot briefly in classic.
---
those teleport scrolls
---
chambers of xeric is a prime example. they need to split up the rewards there, like make it range based items and take ancestral, kodai etc to other/new content
---
No I’m pretty sure what he means is if he was a streamer, it wouldn’t have taken 2 YEARS to get his prize.
---
Wow its mr big bot OSRS expert. Please enlighten the community on all the bots and your magic statistics you’ve gathered by years of playing.
---
There are a lot of temporarily pets in f2p worlds. They are human btw.
---
Ah right yes the classic 'attack the person not the argument'.
---
Should I take this that you dont know other places where its BIS then? And dont say the mage hand person in CoX masses, that's far too niche
---
What client is this? It looks hidious
---
Double mega rare drop, u just got oof’d big time mah boy/girl
---
If op is right and did edit the video. Then op made a mistake. It was also part of the deal to get the interview. Get an interview and promote the bot which he never mentioned.
---
I sell cocaine and cocaine accessories
---
Jagex use Zendesk
---
Mostly convenience of not running out of charges and saving inventory space/bank space
---
Also means a house tab/cape can get you pretty much anywhere in the game, rather than having to think about where exactly you want to go beforehand.
---
tbh it's probably not cheaper in the long run unless you teleport like 2 million times, but convenience is great
---
You can kill normal hydras for the hard task, but only the boss-variant Alchemical Hydra for the medium one.
---
Id only raid with a pure if he was a friend or if it was in ffa personally, but mostly because most of the pures I've raided with die at some point and lose us points.
---
There's also 'Get 80 Thieving' in hard while 'Steal from a Gem Stall (req 75 thieving)' is in elite.
---
Even the *Preamble* to the Constitution addresses more than just national security. Maybe you just had selective hearing in 8th grade history class. What you’re saying is simply wrong.
---
Ash is used to make ultra compost
---
Wtf, I never knew Smoke Staff had a passive... I don't see why they had to made it different from the other 5 combo staves.
---
Classic Jigfl0x
---
nice
---
Also, you can read something called "timezones". When some people are wake up, other people are sleeping.
---
just tell the god damn name so i can flame him wtf
---
A point to take into consideration, GE tracker pulls its data from OSBuddy **as far as I'm aware** and OSB devs can technically edit the prices on their GE pages to make things seem as their not; for their own benefits.
---
Nice!
---
Lol even trippier I didn't see your name but we had a really pointless argument yesterday or the day before. Sorry man having a shit week, didn't mean to take it out on you in particular, have a good one
---
Im doing ardy
---
Its low enough intensity where you can play another account at the same time or play another game like bloons.
---
If you want more intensity to it you can alch/fletch at the same time to get some zero time xp for those
---
Even tho it is slow money it still makes you some.
---
On Runelite (which is complete allowed now) right click your inventory icon and click customisable shift click, then right click on each pot and click use, then reclick on inventory icon and click save.
---
worth doing on ironman?
---
Exactly bro! Why does corp drop all 3 bis shields?! It’s so OP!!!!!
---
initially i thought you meant stackable like blue reward boxes but on reading then yes i agree
---
bro this happens every single competition that jagex has lmao
---
Thanks a ton

Yeah, I mean the "Mimic" casket you get after clicking the reward casket.

177 reviews on Glassdoor for a small company barely anyone but the limited population of people who play Runescape know about that also sound like every criticism on reddit?

Best unlock, increases xp and gp/hr. Just pray against em

Nice, keep going man! The pet might be next trip!
---
I've never had a superior that has really been any more difficult. Maybe if you get caught towards the end of a trip with only a few supplies left, but generally i spend my whole tasks *hoping* for a superior
---
1. who gives a fuck about max hits on slayer
---
2. that way you can just get stronger without having to do anything right? think about that for a second. when IN YOUR LIFE have you seen a game dev release an update that just straight buffs an existing  content piece for no real reason? yes magic buffs are obviously part of the update but theyre also looking to keep players interested and potentially draw new players. "hey that prayer u had unlocked is a little better now" is your suggestion? sit the FOOK down you dont know what youre talking about
---
F2P is a demo. More aimed at children because anyone who can’t afford membership is a child, furthermore that would just extend the usefulness of free play, something jagex won’t make money off of.
---
Did mummy forget to hug you when you were little
---
Rune script is not it’s own programming language, and you seem to be acting as though it is.
---
Sounds fishy. I mailed them fucking cash in 2007 coins included and it worked lmao.
---
It will come. Will it be your first pet?
---
I was speaking more in regards to salary data, I could care less about the review comments
---
My question is... why would you omit the scammer's name?
---
the plugins in that discussion were not approved by jagex nor runelite plugins.
---
That was one of my first slayer point unlocks. I’ve never gotten anything good but the slayer xp is nice when you kill one.
---
My Arm’s Big Adventure in bed
---
Probably alts.  The ash doubles the price of a super compost when making ultra so I’m guessing each ash is 300-500gp.  On my phone or I’d check but that is decent afk gp.
---
good boot

That's why you don't skip leg day

Whats that suspicious looking white powder in that jar there?

Jesus man, paranoid much? Not everyone is on a fake account lmao.

At least you realise your mistake now

66% chance to hit on vetion, so yes, really...
---
You can turn that off
---
Just buy it on PC. In fact, never buy anything on mobile or the app store will take a cut. We want our $11 going to jagex not apple/Google

---
Lighten up
---
Short answer: yes, you are holding them back. 
---
Longer answer: yes, but it may not matter. Vast majority of players raiding are doing like 30 minute trios- very inefficient, bad gp/hour. And they either don't know or don't care that you're holding them back as long as you don't die.
---
3 imbued hearts says yes

you mean i need to do the quest?

havn't done that yet but i can start it right away if thats the case

You don't have to wait for the full planting or watering animation before moving to the next one,  especially not the full watering animation,  which takes the most time. Just try out doing 4 lots plus 1 or 2 extra plants,  then move to 4 when you're comfortable.  You'll see how much time is left by how much down time you have when watering.
---
Power creep is necessary for the game unless you want end game content to be stagnant
---
Reminds me of the threeaddictedbros days
---
Pretty sure it’s one of the easiest pets to get.  Still nice rng, gz
---
It definitely looses on efficient time, but remember this is a game people play for fun. Also, it's probably less than 450k experience.
---
I like this staff, I can't imagine tolerating it in PvP thought.. it's a 25% dps buff to pker's magic. Too much of an upgrade, scary stuff if used by good trybriders
---
It only really affects pures to be fair. It still isnt worth splashing on most accounts
---
damn, i've been funny for about 2 years now, too bad I've always been a joke
---
???
---
Oh how the turn tables have turned.
---
This post is gonna bang
---
Jesus dude
---
Man I miss Ayiza. He was so dedicated to the game and community.
---
Fucking lol. “MMO”. Dumb as fuckkkk get lured
---
What about both?
---
The official forums are for people who like preserving the old ways of the game; it's always been that way.  Redditers are extremely, radically pro-change everything about the game, and be lax on the rules (especially concerning 3PC).
---
The two platforms do not represent the same groups, so it really isn't irony.
---
 master clue item now
---
Void ranged is still useful and BIS for the elite version at TOB and some rotations for COX. Melee/mage void isn't BIS anywhere and not worth getting unless you're super new to PvM and sacrifice your DPS for being a food pack yak
---
That's so odd, I saw someone trying to do that at turoths as well about a week ago. He was talking to a dude in full obby.
---
So I typed "you walked to the middle of the rellekka slayer cave to look for help for someone to teleport you? Why not ask while at the bank?"
---
I think that set off the other guy's internal alarms because it sounded like he was going along with it.
---
Dis is da wae
---
hey its me ur brother
---
U keep replying lool
---
hey man skotizo is rare when you consider the time it takes to get 65 totems on average. as good as any other of the easier pets and one of the best looking
---
I don't know why you're trying to make a point here. They haven't discussed how g ironmen would even be able to pvp yet.
---
11 hp?!
---
Bloating with MTX is fairly common among mmos as well, just saying
---
11 hp?
---
It's not the players fault. This is a jagex problem. This has been a long standing issue where players essentially use other players as luring alts for slayer mobs and hop from world to world to get the best xp they can without an alt of their own.
---
Fit is crazy
---
What happened, you never learned how to screenshot???
---
becoming pure doesnt limit your account. it allows you to pk. having a shitter account below cb 100 with main stats limits your account
---
True! Well now I’m even more hype after realizing I only used 3 totems.
---
You do bounty hunter.
---
200 dry of any drop here and only 3 items in 100 Barrows chests..
---
Very cool. I’ve never had a pet.
---
Thought this was twisted leagues, less impressed now but still cool
---
Wrong way to say it. Fire burns. It burns other things and it itself burns.
---
actually praying melee is better in that situation, if you get frozen - you die, but mage pray doesnt affect freeze rate. better bait pker to use mage which he has huge defence against, compared to melee.
---
Didn't you just get upset about this post? Lol.
---
That's just the free for all portal. Actual clan wars is with set rules clan vs clan in purple portal. 
---
What the bots are up to is not my business, I can't ban them. If anything it bothers me they give clan wars a bad name.
---
I don't think I'm gonna be THAT lucky!
---
I'm still not 100% sure how to deal with a Nechryarch when bursting, other than running out every time he spawns those hell spawns, with it taking 2 mins to kill
---
Yeah start by throwing your MB out the nearest window and buy a PC.

For real tho, idk if Swiftkit still does anything for osrs. It’s an ancient client but my cousin always used it for Mac.

Why does our favorite Video Game company act like some sort of heroin addicted Willy Wonka, full of promise and nostalgia but riddled with laziness, steeped in unprofessionalism, and worst of all seemingly unaware of their genuinely sad descent down the corporate ladder of respectability.

as a noob, what’s special about it?
---
Bullshit comparison and you know it, how many times have you pked someone for 5 billion gold? Yea thats what i thought.
---
Ah I see you confused the great Ash's conquest over the 12 universes with some heretic(yes it is).
---
When Ash was invited to the Tournament of Power the gods of destruction watched as he went to SSGMUI within an instance. Jiren, Goku, and even the gods of destruction were no match for this absolute unit. Zeno had no choice but to bow to his power and give him free reign over the universe.
---
Does that answer your question?
---
Sweet. I got it at 82 bro!!

At least read up on how the dupe was performed before crafting these wild fan-theories, it will save you time and effort in future.

This prayer scroll unlocks the ability for you to use the best magic prayer
---
I'm old enough to remember Elysian being worth over a bil (until mod audi crashed it) and the Elysian didn't make the game babyscape.
---
Also blowpipe is a terrible benchmark considering its a broken piece of shit as well, seriously the 2-5m straw is better damage than every weapon that isn't tbow, and like you said alot of times it is better than tbow.
---
Theres 2 prayer scrolls that you can consume to unlock the last tier of prayer for mage and range, the dextrous one, is insanely good because rigour(range) increases both accuracy and damage significantly, whereas the arcane scroll unlocks augury(mage), which is rather useless to most things, as it does not increase damage, only accuracy. Most things you use mage against does not have very high magic defense, hence its rather useless in most situations.
---
Oakdice is irrelevant though. He has next to no subs. And keen would bother because extra views = equal money. He doesn't need to do a Jagex fuck up history. Just a "he won 2 years ago and they scammed him".
---
Osbuddy act has gpu support unlike runelite on Mac so sometimes if I don’t want the fans to start freaking I’ll use it
---
LMAO (yes it does)
---
You can safespot + cannon Greaters in the Chasm of Fire, giving them pseudo-multi-combat status. The cannon is also in the safespot, so they can never hit you.
---
Im not even attacking you calm down kid. Its useful in more than 2 places otherwise it wouldn't be 800m. Try gwd for starters like kril and bandos. Use ur brain a little, you obviously have one.
---
I dont need to change your mind. Change my mind.
---
Dks are super easy to flick at, but I def wouldn’t at hydra
---
Dense arnt you? Large scale you dont think high risk pking doesnt happen, theres a world dedicated to it? Or that Kids arnt getting clapped for elys? Or for like 500m gear? Shit large scale I dont even want to think of of the amount of gear getting dropped every second. 
---
All of staking? One world. Maybe 1000-1500 stakes online max at any given time maybe close to 2000 when oda is streaming. 
---
Guaranteed over 2000 pkers at all times, every day.
---
Lol my IQ must be in the minuses
---
Of course plenty of people have. I'm well aware of that. But there's also people who have been correct and got unbanned.

Actually thought he abandoned his reward for the content, I was speechless.

Are you complaining about not being able to do pvm in wilderness? I think thats just unlucky, i have 200 wildy tasks completed and hasnt been a bother tbh.

It literally says bug abuse major. That's not botting.

Theres no debate here, the numbers say youre wrong

Grasp it firmly

Jeez go cry a river some where else sad kid.

I just hate that people get money from duel arena and then dont appreciate the value of it in the game. Most of big clan pkers have got big portion of their bank from duel arena i believe. Also the RWTers are huge problem in this game and big source of their money is from duel arena.
---
Why would you splash on p2p?
---
See my previous comment
---
congrats, now you never have to do that shit boss again
---
&gt;you only need to pray mage when you hear a barrage, run 7 levels and tele out   
---
Yeah, no
---
you ARE entitled, in the most real definition of the word. You won a prize, you are entitled to receiving it.
---
But it just isn't that easy for some. There's a reason you can call your banks to block your cards if you use them for gambling purposes.
---
Same applies here.
---
Max effiency banking/looting Vorkath is up to 30-35 kills an hour with woox walking fireball stage. Gives an average of ~1.20-1.30 kill times. 25 kills is my average with no wooxwalk required and is pretty doable whilst watching Netflix for me at least
---
:)
---
It’ll be interesting to see how it does when paired with realistic gear and going against realistic gear. 
---
Tourney worlds aren’t an accurate representation of real game application, as everyone is running around in max with goofy invent setups.
---
Game changing plugins are banned
---
Cool
---
I would rather them just keep adding to the map in osrs but not change the style of the game or add new skills
---
This guy is level 99 bitch made
---
Higher rate of xp and free runes if utilizing the BA method
---
too soon
---
It doesn't mean that he is 91. He could just buy a stack of natures to pay with
---
Oh awesome. Thank you
---
That logic is more flawed than paying runnners with runes haha
---
I can't really agree to that either because about half your GP/hr is tied up in Dragon Pick + Tyrannical Ring and when you're building bank, relying on uniques isn't ideal until you at least get a decent gear setup. For that purpose, something like Zalcano or Revenants, maybe even some of the higher tier mobs like Rune Drags and Brutal Blacks would be better for getting a basic setup to then do Zulrah. There's a reason why Zulrah is the go-to boss when people talk about OP droptables.
---

---
Sorry..
---
Right, that's why I said 82-87 :)
---
1. Bounty hunter generates billions of gp into the game everyday,
---
2. The duel arena while it does move a lot, does not generate any gp.
---
3.  wealth being moved around in "nefarious" ways like the duel arena are just as if not more likely to happen in the wild.
---
4. While the average stake is mils, and hundreds there is 3-4-5 pker to every staker. Go to the duel arena , any other world its empty, while most of the wild is empty in other worlds, there are several worlds dedicated to it and generally quite a few people in every world especially in locations like rev caves, druids, dragons etc etc. 
---
5. For every staking bot there is close to 10 green dragon bots/blackchinchompa bot/other wild bots
---
Ahhh yeah it dies tend to get like that when you add competitive element to the game... Well i guess you could try to outplay them or tag mobs yourself, try to hog resources. Or yeah save yourself peace of mind and just go back to regular game hah
---
Well it's good that op left his rsn and we can check that he has 47 rc.
---
If gold is duped and afterwards you wanted an item to buy in bulk ely is good. Not as many coming into game as bows and scythes but commonly traded more than 3rd age

I have chainmace and use it for slayer. But there's some problems i find with chainmace on Callisto:
---
1. Since i almost exclusively do Callisto while afking its not worth to use prayer cause then the costs on ppots would go too high (cause i cant prayer flick while afk). So then accuracy of chainmace is significatible reduced if not on Piety, while Verac's is almost unaffected since most of his accuracy comes from the set effect.
---
2. Chaince is A LOT more costly (ether) than Verac's, which cuts my profits.
---
3. Im not maxed, only 82 attack. While this is an issue on chainmace on Verac's is almost whatever.
---
4. Chainmace implies bringing a defender and proselite set which also reduces how much risk i can bring and is much lower defence than Verac's against pkers.

Not an argument lol.
---
 accounts being banned for buying gold? lol no
---
Okay that makes sense, thanks!
---
You're*
---
Buying weeb vibes 2k ea - kevinkage
---
&gt;Also the RWTers are huge problem in this game and big source of their money is from duel arena.
---
We should put a trade limit or a staking limit to stop that
---
😂 the b0aty numeral
---
I guess that would be cheaper than a stamina pot use as well then 🤔
---
typical scam where they close the trade window instantly hoping you spam click it and not pay attention to the wildy warning. Not sure if it actually works at all anymore since I thought most wildy tabs became right click only
---
I admitted it in like the first reply to you lol yet you kept going on, why are you still talking to me?
---
Actually, he died because he was praying range when in actuality, the magic bullet would’ve been stopped by praying protect from magic
---
You hate to see it
---
I’ve never once met a human on this earth who, with dirty hands, told me to hold on while they plugged in their mouse LMAO.
---
Okay lol I wasn’t belittling him though, at least use the word correctly.
---
well maybe they will get their shit together then.
---
This is appalling how Jagex treats RS content creators.
---
I’m pretty new to the game; can someone explain to me what the scammer was trying to do?
---
so what? gameplay is the same as a pure as it is as a main. from a logical standpoint the inputs are different but the end result is the same. if you want to pvm/skill/pk on a pure you can. if you want to pvm/skill/pk on a non dedicated pvp build you cannot
---
I agree
---
At least on the Callisto area for every 10 pkers that come only 1 is on standart spellbook and to be fair its the same thing almost. You either tank for 2.5 minutes which is totally doable or you get to green dragons and draw aggro from them and then you punch untill tb expires. If i have brews left i just drop my stats to around 20 and escape easily.
---
Nah that's just propaganda from anti SBS leftists trying to take away our right to tb and freeze in the same fight
---
But people with touch screen laptops can do that now?
---
I've log accepted they aren't going too, doesn't mean I can't advocate for it and provide information.
---
Nah that guy would be fine, they'll shoot the guy who's barely conscious after drinking bleach, let's be honest
---
It's a game you dork
---
Just relax. Your gear will differ depending on your task. At that point just use what affects your monsters best. Typically abby dagger is very good but I've taken to the elder maul when I can.
---
Ash replied to a Michael tweet long ago where he confirmed this is how server crashes work.
---
Touchscreen laptops flopped so hard hardly anybody uses them outside of a workplace environment. There may be those few people who do use a touchscreen laptop but why open the option up to a large portion of players to abuse?
---
Why should your lack of self control limit others?
---
Yup try it out. The game feels fun from start to finish and will keep you busy for years. The goal is to max your skills but in no way is it necessary to enjoy the game. There's a wide variety of content from start to finish. What i like is that the entire world stays relevant instead of most MMOs with leveling zones that become useless once you out level them.
---
Gold may have been duped, but people oftentimes try to buy items in case of a rollback or gold removed from the account. It's like money laundering. They get less for it, but it's a more secure long term way to hold the gold.
---
&gt;I was ALSO contacted by someone called @OficialJagex, where the account was just made this month, and it says on the account "no affiliation with Jagex" when I made this tweet to try and get them to look at my account, and they told me to DM them. When I did, they asked for my Recovery questions, and after giving them the right answers (I figure at this point, I know they're sus, but the account's banned, my credit card has since been removed, they can't really do anything with it even if somehow they get it unbanned with JUST those answers so I might as well see if they actually can help me) they said they couldn't help me. (not surprised).
---
Jesus fucking Christ dude
---
Seems to be alot of people's opinion though, that's why it keeps coming up.
---
For someone who keeps acting thoughtful you don't seem to do that much yourself.
---
For all we know, this was just a merch clan that all use OSB and they decided to have a field day for a month of Ely prices.
---
Not doing that
---
Its magic it's way more expensive than ranged.
---
So for training... That's kind of a tricky question. 80 defense is really nice for ferocious gloves and the ability to equip all armor, but if you don't have fero gloves or better armor then it'd be kind of a waste to train right now. I'd say get your defense up to 70, just so you can equip barrows armor, then consider going for 80/80/80 if you plan on getting fero gloves. Generally tho you wanna keep your str \~ 5-10 levels higher than attack, and 99 atk+str before leveling defense past equip requirements (So for example, if your attack was 80, you should have 85-90 strength, and w/e defense lets you equip your best strength bonus gear). Do with that information what you will, but I'd definitely recommend getting defense to 70 first with whip then getting the saradomin blessed sword or abby dagger for strength training. The blessed sara sword is better if you don't need an offhand and don't mind spending \~ 800k for every 10k attacks (\~80gp/hit), dagger if you need an offhand or want stab instead of slash or just don't wanna deal with degrading weaponry.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Full obby is only good if you're using FULL obby, obby necklace, AND an obby weapon. Since you're going to be on task, the mask alone breaks that setup (And it's worth using mask + a better weapon over the obby bonuses), so you'd be better off with fighter torso + obby legs + mask + glory/fury etc.
---
sit
---
Because a video game that was made to be played on PC and was ported to mobile doesn’t have mouse support, I’m not thoughtful? Interesting take.
---
Atleast it's a human not a bot.
---
On a serious note, if you are 91+ skip urns with snakes in 81 room so you can get all the experience in the 91 room. Timing works out nice too
---
Not everyone is an iron 1. And 2. Not everyone prefers the easier method. Some people want the faster method aka, burning logs.
---
Those names do sounds familiar, good luck to you too dude!
---
It doesn’t at all
---
You have a better gpu than I do and the game runs well for me. Check the gpu plugin and smooting plugin.
---
If that's why you think I said that, seems I'm correct.
---
I’d go for graceful in your situation
---
Nah if it was real his health bar would be 46, for his age. Not 73 which I bet he is glitching.
---
Galaxy Cape.
---
Yeah, I have a couple pieces. Just, agility kinda sucks haha. But I agree, it's super important. I will honestly probably prioritize that over anything else right now.
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Except Ardy 2 doesn’t have purple or black in it?
---
It's a purple and black theme. He probably doesnt have much that fits better
---
The hell
---
It wouldnt you would have to choose to activate it. Thanks for actually reading my comment before responding.
---
And the cape is green and gray and red. It doesn’t match
---
It's a dark dark blue and gray which fits better than fire cape by far
---
Zuhaar is #1.
---
i dont understand how everyone is clueless about training str xp on a 60 atk pure with savle ei at multi ankuo legit 180k str xp an hour. someone needs to make a video on that
---
abby dagger till you can afford better(bludgeon/rapier), assuming you have a dragon defender. keep your str about 10-15 lvs over attack. whip for attack training, burst on defensive for defense or whip for defense as well.
---
Much appreciated!
---
I really enjoy trading as well but I think you're right. There have been games that I enjoyed but because everything revolved around gold, it put me in a mentality where I needed to be the most gold efficient as possible and often that leads to burn out before you can even enjoy the game.
---
Thank you for the heads up! My only concern is that as a completely new player, would playing ironman be a daunting task? I love the idea but is it realistic?
---
Unlocking basilisk knights would be one of the worst decisions to make at his levels
---
Can you really call yourself a Runescape player without at least 99 runecraft? I mean the skill has the word rune which is in the game yourself. I always judge someone by their RC level and anything less than 99 is a filthy casual imo and is looked down upon.

Paraphrasing from the [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Magic)
---
(player's Magic level \* 0.7 + player's Defence level \* 0.3 + 8) \* (64 + equipment bonus) = Defence roll
---
This seems to indicate that the "defence" that accounts for 30% is not the defence bonus of your equipment, but you actual defence level.
---
Edit: your attack roll is calculated as follows:
---
(visible level \* prayer effects + 8) \* (64 + equipment bonus) = Attack roll
---
What does that even mean
---
is it even possible for both of them?
---
Ok I guess I'll just continue to pray melee, sucks how long they take to kill its eatinf thru my pots
---
Good luck getting that through a community vote lol

He had to get to 2hp, he had numerous chances to switch prayers. I think some of you are misunderstanding mage pray in pvp. Although mage pray won’t stop him from being frozen, the damage is less. 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Protect_from_Magic
---
&gt;	 Protect from Magic grants players 100% resistance to almost all NPC magic attacks, and 40% resistance to magic attacks dealt by players. With a prayer bonus of 0, It depletes prayer at a rate of 1 point per 3 seconds (or 5 game ticks). 
---
&gt;	When Protect from Magic is activated, the duration of Teleblock is halved.
---
&gt;	It should be noted that Protect from Magic does NOT affect splash chance in PvP situations, and it only mitigates damage dealt. A consequence of this is that Protect from Magic does not make it less likely that Ice spells or Bind/Snare/Entangle will hit, but will make any damage dealt lower.[1]
---
Wait how to know what tire I am in rn

to be fair you actually (literally) can't die to chickens and maybe he got the two mixed up

Congrats!! Definitely a cool pet and it’s hilarious how loud he is when walking around.

started a ironman and i'm using oziris guide for ironman. started 74 fishing grind at 70 fishing atm after this i have to do rogues minigame then get 84 thievin so that's going to be fun but i'll stick to it and probably not do the 99 thieving part
---
when they're both grey, DEUTERANOPIA GAMERS RISE UP

Also ironic is the protest against free trade removal and ironman mode.
---
This aged well
---
After doing the quest desert treasure you unlock a new spellbook which has 4 burst spells and 4 barrage spells that hit in 3x3 grids like chinning. Ice burst at 70 magic and ice barrage at 94 magic are the preffered spells to cast.
---
Dust devils and nechreyals can be killed in the catacombs of kourend by using something like a dart to aggro all of the spawns in a room then running in a corner to stack them all up and kill them. There are plenty of guides for this method on youtube. I personally think it's kinda fun and it is good exp per hour.
---
Try low detail mode on runelite, might help a bit, or not
---
Yeah, I've done tithe farm before. I do 4 plots and replant as I harvest so it's not all bad. I just found I'd lose one or two when I did 5, so I do 4 plots 3 times, then one lot of 4 with fertilizer, then another 3 lots of 4 to finish.
---
Ricecup fails again:(
---
Dont worry. 49 is halfway
---
I was hoping to see Lyndon B Johnson’s Johnson
---
It wasn't so bad, but I really only did that when I was learning. What I learned is that if shit hits the fan and you're fucking up the pray switches, just stop trying and eat, and you'll usually live.
---
Yeah, if this gets released - bandos will crash so hard, You have no idea.
---
Oh yeah, it's actually more intuitive to play IM since quests, leveling many skills instead of a single one to 99 and a whole bunch of other usually unoptimal things you end up doing intuitivelly make a lot more sense on IM. Also you can turn your IM into a normal account any time, you just can't switch back to IM later.
---
He didn't cheat*, proven by the fact that he was paid the reward money.
---
Funny thing is he specifically didn't tick eat and just used combo food to make sure he wasn't even glitching. He also asked them b4 hand if it was ok they said yes, he did it, then they said no after he did it.
---
Just finished it last night, was pretty great even with it being so long.

Can anyone explain blast furnace fees for below 60 smithing? Im over here wasting my money not understanding how this work.

I dont think u know the drop rates mate. I’d even say you have good rng tbh haha.

You know what? Honestly if you take the role of community manager for an online game OSRS is nothing special in a good or bad way when it comes to how bad or toxic a community is. If this scares someone or gets to them they need to find a new line of work. I've been on the internet and playing games to see how these communities function for a little over 20 years now and sensitive people who actually care about our feedback and comments on an emotional level aren't really cut out for that kind of work. You need to be able to understand and facilitate communication between both devs and the community without taking anything to heart some mean person on the internet says. At the end of the day none of us should mean anything on a personal level in a way that someone can just drop a drive by nasty comment and get any sort of reaction whatsoever from someone simply facilitating discussion as a job. I recognize everyone isn't capable of maintaining that distance but if you can't then a job like that isn't one that's meant for you
---
Why times 4? Its 12 xp per chicken in combat and 4 xp for hp
---
oh yea that makes sense... so the farming patch was just a good place to throw a party then.
---
Ahh okay makes sense. Yeah I'll check gem more often from now. Thanks.
---
Got the pet at like 470 which is kinda annoying because now I have no motivation to do this task ,and I seem to get it all the time, becasue all I need is the jar and fuck the jars lol
---
Makes sense to be honest, thanks for the heads up.
---
Ye I brought up the splashing thing because it's the same formula (just with attack variables subbed out for defence variables) so I thought it would be a good comparison for people to understand the logic behind.
---
Yeah I'm very average for my rank
---
I’m not saying he’s excused by any means. I’m just explaining why it being bad before him slightly explains why it was bad with him. Acorn is a perfect example of how someone doing the right thing can change a workplace culture.

+65 magic bonus is not the opposite of the -65 magic bonus explained in the post.

You don't gain 100% accuracy for having +65 bonus, lol. That'd be insanely broken.

This is going to the top.

really appreciate the advice on both ends! I'll try to do some research on what ironman might entail. either way it seems like there's plenty of fun to be had in this game. looking forward to dive in!
---
Maybe it's a fancy way of saying 99 farming?
---
glad you liked it. Yeah there’s such a lack of good mobile skill training guides and it’s shitty because mobile is excellent for low to mid effort training methods or really mindless AFK such as cutting yews and blood rune crafting. And even really high effort efficient training like lavas, 2 ticking teaks and blackjacking. So many possibilities.
---
The creators of the only good emulator on Android stole code, and it's very poorly made so I was curious if throwing raw PC power at it would actually let you play. As mobile processors came long and got more powerful we slowly got a few more games each good jump in performance.

Also shout out to the Linux Master race.

It is what it is

No problem. Glad I could help :)

You could try running runelite from terminal with hardware acceleration off

Yea. I’ve accomplished a lot and don’t mind the wasted xp because of being able to play literally wherever
---
thanks, does this mean when i die ill lose him no matter what? i cant use the bank so i cant put him away :(
---
So I’m looking at about 82k per hour to use this?
---
Might just make more sense for me to just get my smithing to 60 sheesh
---
I was at EdgeVille bank doing some Classic Bank Standing wearing some random ass armor
---
And this guy kept bugging me trying to go the wilderness to see this new bug he found
---
So I just put everything in the bank
---
And followed him and let him kill me with nothing on me except a feather
---
Just so he could shit the fuck up
---
Or you could have a gold ring and a cheap blessing (prevent rada's blessing tele) as 2 of the items you show to begin with, equip them and trade again with 25 items, cash stack, and 2 spots available before the stake starts. But I still don't know how this would be secure, cause the losing individual could just run away, and out of the wilderness. Also: you have to be able to guarantee people start on the same tick which would probably result in many "do-overs".
---
My main concern was getting 66 for morytania hard diary.
---
Oh, I didn't see you were an Ultimate. Unfortunately, yes - You will lose him if you die. I don't know of any other way to protect a pet.

30 exp for herblore
---
not botting anymore eh?

you can insure him with [probita](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Probita) in Ardougne, in between the general store and house seller. It costs 500k though, but when you die with him, he will be stored with her and can be reclaimed for 1m gp.
---
I liked the length a lot, made it feel like you got a complete story.

What?
---
This lol always blows my mind how many people do this in game thinking they're really smart for it. BRB 11 dollars a month on a game giving you probably 10-20 hours a week entertainment. You probably waste 11$ every other day on a pizza or coffee at a gas station that lasts for 15 minutes

easy fruit trees are the worst and I dont think they should exist at all. 16hrs is not an easy task since time is difficulty in rs really.

Honestly, I was completely burnt out on my main decided to start an Ironman, but got convinced by a friend to try HCIM and see how far I get - so I started with the initial thought of when I die, I'll continue as a normal Ironman, but I'll try to get as far as I can regardless. It's been a blast, my HCIM now has higher stats than my main and I don't even log into my main anymore. I've felt a little burn out, but that has mainly been from grinding a skill too hard and me just needing a break/to switch things up.
---
lol that's great, snapped it really quick because everyone was about to move. Plus you cant hide the hud even if you wanted to.

HalalSnakbar leveling spreadsheets - I can put my name inside w/o competing with other players and it could be much more detailed/dynamic with more steps (Osbuddy has just a few) and calculated profit/loss/is_or_is_not worth it.

As pointed out by someone else, I mixed up the I in his name for an L, odd coincidence theres another high level account named Tzjal-Zuk
---
Yeah, it's really hard to keep at arm's length. I think I am getting better at moderating it. For some people, they are not able to keep it under control. I wonder if we are subconsciously chasing some kind of dragon: most of us started gaming when we were children, and every time we log on, we want to have that feeling we had the first time we played? That phrase comes from heroin users - chasing the dragon is when every time you use, you are trying to get that high you got the first time you used.
---
At least for myself, I'm trying to make what used to be a problem and source of depression for me - video games - into something that I can be proud of, a career. I'm going to school for video game design. I have had people telling me that me doing that is no different than an alcoholic opening up a liquor store, but that's about as far as they got with that criticism. Again, if you can keep it under control, then you're not addicted, and it's not a problem, and you need not feel bad about doing it.
---
I mean, how many OSRS YouTubers struggled with addiction to OSRS for more than 5 years? Probably all of them. But they have transformed their problem into something positive. That's what I'm trying to do.
---
If you know that it's too hard to keep yourself from going back into a negative cycle with gaming, then stay quit. I gotta tell ya, it is incredibly difficult. I mean, I have been clean off a certain popular substance for more than two years now, and I still fantasize about using it again.
---
I can only hope :')
---
Seconded.
---
Learn of all them because it won't be efficient to farm just one rotation. You don't need both Battlemage + Bastion but definitely Battlemage + Ranging or Magic + Bastion (whichever combo is cheaper) but I never did Zulrah with a Magic potion so I'm not if it's even worth taking, would depend on how long it gives you max hits for IMO, like if it gives you a max for 3 levels then I'd take it but otherwise I wouldn't (check Trident's wiki page to see when you get new max hits).
---
Mantas are fine for Zulrah, a lot of more budget players use Sharks though but I like using Mantas. Your gear is definitely enough, no need for Rigour or Augury.
---
Eh just join theoatrix clan chat we are happy to help new players if you have any questions

About as useful as Thammaron's sceptre. Maybe even less.

it is beautiful

LESS likely to kill the dragon you’re boxing

problem with niche items are they are way to limited.  best content to use scythe at is the content that drops scythe, anywhere else you either dont make money or you barely break a profit.

I mean who is Georgia

Okay?

It would respawn in a different part of the same zone...and there would be over a hundred resources per region its not like those terrible quests where you have to search 50 bushes to find one item.
---
D med + d chain combo is always so fresh
---
Not sure, I don't play it. I just figured people enjoyed it outside of the tournament because of pvp, it seemed to me the leagues was just the same thing, xp multiplier but without the pvp and you compete for xp. But I've played nethier modes. If I'm wrong I guess I'll be enlightened
---
I'm addicted af. I usually play from the time I get up to the time I go to bed. Maybe a hour or two break. I just don't care to be honest. My life is depressing and I'm depressed.
---
(I saw someone mention it happened on f2p, but even then..)
---
It would make zero sense to dupe with Ely. Say you dupe 1b, and lose the Ely, you've made 400-200m or so. All you need to do is spend a bit of time and gp on figuring out what better item to use to make each dupe worth 700m more.
---
Remove wildy and make battlegrounds. 
---
Lol aka give me all the wildy content without risk and put the already dead pvp into a matchmaking system that will be doa
---
No
---
I remember getting pulled at the ge and going along with it because I had nothing better to do.
---
I also forgot about the 10m I had in my inventory because I was trading. Years of experienced reduced to getting owned because I’m a shitbag who didn’t put the money away before going for a scam.
---
I don’t get it
---
There's a prototype in the works at the moment. Probably expected to come out early 2020.
---
I would really like to do the skilling XP rates thing, but unfortunately a lot of it is based on data we don't have. We might be able to pester the relevant people or crowdsource it enough, but skilling success rates can be kind of a nightmare (for example, every &lt;tree, axe&gt; combo has a separate interpolation for success rate between 1 and 99).
---
If I still played this game I would be outraged. The duel arena was the best part.
---
You’re spawning a lot of shitty memes
---
Updoots for you
---
It was my favourite skill back in the day but it's too overpowered so I wouldn't like it to come back.
---
Peak addiction
---
Why would it be doa? If they removed the wilderness and gave a ton of PvP alternatives with amazing rewards, why wouldn't people who PvP in the wilderness now play those alternatives?
---
&gt;give me all the wildy content without risk
---
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm arguing. When I played WoW I loved both PvP and PvM, because I didn't need to risk hours worth of work every time I wanted to PvP. I just hopped into an arena with a friend and had a blast; if we won then I got to upgrade my PvP gear and moved up in rank and it felt awesome, and if I lost then no harm done. In this game I'm not touching wilderness PvP with a 10 foot pole because I don't play anywhere near enough to want to risk losing a ton of gp if I lose. I played LMS though and had  a blast because I could PvP without that risk. Why do you think risk is necessary for PvP to be any good?

RS3 MTX makes insane profits, saw a post that said it was more than half for them. If RS3 does die there's no sacrificial lamb for MTX anymore.

It should be included in some sorts in the prototype dps calculator in the work. Bear in mind that any non-standard attack from a monster is essentially individually hardcoded, which can lead to many special quirks that may not be accounted for in any general calculator, especially because it's impractical to ask jmods about every exception or to even know where all the exceptions are.

Fair enough 👍

Clearly he rock caked a 99

Grats. What's with the inventory though? I thought at first it was some drops from your journey to 99, but Robinhood hats are indeed not from Slayer lol.

thank you for the detailed and helpful reply! while I like the idea of ironman, I don't feel like I would fully appreciate it and be able to excel at it as a brand nee player. I feel like I should start a normal account first so that I can learn the ins and out of the game and then dive into ironman whenever I feel ready. I think I would fully appreciate it then

Really cool! Are you planning to keep to post updates as the league continues?
---
It's still around and people still play it. It's not as popular as osrs though.
---
i'm totally on board!
---
I do birdhouses. They're pretty darn quick if a bit annoying, but there's no compelling reason not to.

&gt; gave a ton of PvP alternatives with amazing rewards

lol

you mean runescape classic? it was shut down last year because not enough people played it to justify jagex keeping the servers alive

r/runescape

05-07 was far from the "golden era" Did you even play from 07-12?
---
everything I'm hearing is getting me really excited about starting! going to try and dive right in
---
Not yet. I have the requirements, just haven't sat through it.
---
Idk if that means you think the username is good or you hate it so bad you would pay me to change it.

I'm maxed and this is about the same gear I train with
