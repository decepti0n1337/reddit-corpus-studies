Sometimes. I took a break from the game for a about 1.5 years and came back to multiple of my accounts hacked. I recovered both of them and they were both perm banned for botting. Appealed both of them and only one of them got a response unbanning it. I never even got a response on the other account. I’m assuming it’s because the hijacker attempted to appeal it himself...no clue

---
A piece of shit for picking up an item that another dude had to miss for an entire 60 seconds because he was killing a gorilla and not finishing the one he started?
---

---
Seems like a just reward to me lmao
---
Thanks man xd
---
Wishful thinking haha. It hurts thinking if i hit drop rates id have 210m+ more. So now im in a position where its like ok..itll sort of even out eventually right? :( 
---
I think my hydra rng is just broken and the coding for a claw drop is actually 1/1500000. Hell i even got rune javs the other week (rarest item can get from hydra). 
---
The rough life..

---
Reddit's hive Mind is horribly misportraying the support of this game.
---
It's by no means the best in its class but it's easily acceptable quality. 
---
People sometimes compare it to blizz which is hilarious to me. Just compare the companies profits and say they should have anywhere near equal resources.
---
thank mr skeltal
---
Odd one out event
---
I'd like one please!
---
**I am a mole and I'm digging a hole...**
---
I made the picture in photoshop, the cup vendor is Tervis.
---
When you buy an account, someone else can recover it. That person is most likely the one who “hacked” the account. This situation would make absolutely no sense if he was the account seller. 
---
He only needs to show Jagex exchanges and proof he’s played this game from start to finish. Idk where you’re getting that he needs to show personal info, that’s absolutely ridiculous. He could show that he’s paid for membership throughout his accounts history using only dates and all sensitive information redacted, but there’s no need to when he can just show shots of him as a lvl 3 or gaining low levels. 
---
You yourself have it backwards and wrote a giant wall of text to explain it. Fucking stupid. “LOL”
---
For money, it's mostly gem mining and amethyst mining. For training it's iron at lower levels, and then motherlode for somewhat afk training.
---
Guess you had the same idea as me hahah
---
Thepoint.meme
---
Why does it matter what the slayer level of the monster is? It drops a bis item that boosts dps more than any other helmet, so its going to be expensive. If people thought it was too expensive, it would go down in price.
---
So if you sell gold on one account they should just assume you wont on the other?
---
Clearly he pushed the rules as a kid. He likely didn't really think about it, cos he was a kid, but a mute stops further incorrect behaviour while allowing you to play.
---
Quest cape 
---
99 Agility

99 Magic
---
At the moment I'm just rotating training all combat and magic while tanning cowhides and mining. I also go to the dudes who are powerskilling and just take their stuff.
---
The billing ones are the most common legit ones I've seen. But they're also the ones always resolved. So what's your point?
---
I can only get away with super super afk stuff since I am away from the game for 5-15 minutes at a time, so I usually just stick to sand crabs
---
I'd like one please
---
I killed 1555 rune dragons on my iron going for the dcb. People tagging and teleporting out was a big annoyance. if I noticed it had been tagged I just walked under it but I didn't catch it every time. Probably 50-100 kills I didn't get the loot.
---
easy. he has 30 fletching.
---
Lmao right op probably had a RAT on his computer when he was recovering his previously keylogged account
---
The patience is real
---
Yes, they make you pay for each account separately so they should be treated as such.
---
Getting one account permabanned for botting also doesn't mean the other account should be touched.
---
We all play the game differently and just because you play different from me doesn’t mean I can hate on how you play. So good luck getting back your account dude
---
Does this run decently? This might be a cheap way to tablet for me.
---
But why did someone pay their actual money for it to show up as an ad is what I’m wondering lol, it’s not THAT deep, I know how it works bud.
---
Hundreds of threads... Of liars trying to game the system and then they waste time. People say support is slow, it's because this community now expects them to respond and investigate every banned person who goes "nuh uh I didn't do it" without using the actual appeal process (because *they know they don't have info or a valid point to stand on*).
---
Outside of Jed scenario, I've seen less than 10 legit cases where someone was perma'd and couldn't get support but it turned out to be a false positive. And those got resolved. I've had 3 issues in 5 years that I've needed support on. And 3/3 times I got it within 24 hrs of submitting my ticket.
---
So there's definitely a minority of players with a legit reason to distrust support. But for the majority it does it's job.
---
29 here, hardly ever play without smoking
---
what age category would your gf consider autistic people in their mid-20s?
---
Do whatever you enjoy! That’s the most important thing with OSRS.
---
Congrats, not the biggest fan of hunter myself, sounds pretty painful
---
I think it happens because you can't die ontop of an obstacle. So instead of killing you inside the rope block it heals you. I've seen people taking lethal damage from the floor in Mount korrum survive like this too.
---
&gt; not trying to shit on your parade op
---
Doubt
---
The honest response is that they have a customer service. Their ticketing system works okay, specially for billing issues. It just has a few cracks and is a bit of a mess to navigate, so the meme kinda was born.
---
Obviously it could and has to be much better, but it's not like people are just left to their own devices
---
Because a mid lvl slayer monster with a good drop should be profitably farmable by mid lvl players. At the original difficulty and assuming jaw leveled out around 10m, a mid lvl player could still prob profit 500k/h or so in the long term and would still make some money if they never saw a jaw drop. Now, even for max players, doing basilisks is a gp loss until you get a jaw and when you do you prob averaged like 750k/h, maybe 1m/h. They're just a terrible slayer task for anyone at any lvl now. Pre-nerf they were something everyone could do for some profit.
---
I mean in terms of difficulty/length of kills. I’ve killed plenty of demonics but never killed a basilisk knight, what makes them so horrible to fight?
---
You can prevent that issue by submitting a ticket stating your changing address. I've done so myself.
---
It also doesn't get banned simply from playing from a different location. If he was moving around every few weeks, that would trigger it 
---
Source: I play in Aus and I've played while in Japan and Europe. Never got banned because they live in 2019 too where planes exist and people go on holidays.
---
But if my IP was changing countries rapidly it can seem like the account is hiding it's IP / location and probably is hijacked / sold.
---
Same reason most people play runescape, clicking same shit for 1000s of hours, cos why not 
---
&gt;I know how it works bud. 
---
Yeah, now you do, you’re welcome for the knowledge i give you :).
---
I feel you bro this is therapeutic for me, smoke a joint and play RuneScape before bed after work

You're about a month late on this man. Been posted here thousands of times lately

Anyone know why the hiscores are down?

I need 30 points to cancel, as far as I can tell.
---
It is your fault, but it's also the database owners fault. Be glad that GDPR-like laws exist.
---
Use different passwords for different sites. Dont answer recovery answers truthfully.
---
Your naivety and lack of action has caused you to be taken advantage of though. Yeah, it's not all your fault... but that doesn't mean you couldn't have prevented it from affecting you.
---
Yeah then that mute was for no reason.
---
You can censor the sensitive information still.
---
Check my post history if you want to cry lol. Congratulations on setting a goal and achieving it though!
---
can stand out of range with tbow at sotetseg as well
---
Get familiar with emotes bro. My mains been permamuted on rs3 since 06.
---
Coming back after nearly a year off, how vital is SotE to do on a main ~115 combat, ~1700 total? 
---
I'm mainly planning on doing DS2 and getting back to the slayer grind (90atm)
---
Any other new content I should be getting done?
---
If your security measures you take as a company are moot for the majority of the population, your company is not very secure. Hence the constant complaints on all forms of social media. There are additional precautions that companies can implement that work for more people. 
---
Obviously people can be more secure. If you try hard enough you'll never get hacked even without 2fa. There's nothing wrong with the community trying to get additional security options for their accounts.
---
Im happy i get all this gear and rigour for free
---
I can’t believe the recovery system in this game is still so neglected..
---
Clicked the gif without seeing it was in the 2007 sub, couldn't figure out wtf they were doing lol
---
I don't have to complain about any of those, not once have I. Canada's far better than pretty much anywhere :) I am genuinely sorry for you living in such a bubble and being such a hateful person. If new zealand was so great you'd probably be a bit happier and spend less time trying to be toxic on the internet, or wishing death on people. I truly hope your life take's a turn for the better one day and become much less of a shitbag
---
Blizzard asks you for ID too unfortunately, though you can just scan and email it.
---
If you go onto the RuneScape website In the account management tab I believe it's under status it will show your standings as if you click show proof it will show you the chat log of what you said...
---
You had to of really said something stupid to get a perm mute.
---
Jesus fucking christ, I'm sorry that you lost so much to gambling addiction. People like to trivialize it when video games are involved (CS:GO knife skin shit, RS duel arena, buying sexy naked girl big boobs fortnite skins, etc.) but it's still an addiction and it can still be life destroying either way. Very scummy of Jagex to not have deleted duel arena already
---
Lumby medium has a 52 hunter requirement though. That's kind of steep given how awful hunter is.

I mean most people who zammy pet hunt atleast duo it. I myself am going for kq pet. Even with diaries done i can only do about 125 of my task before i burn out. Thats what the point of the game is set goals and achieve those goals everyone has different standards.

3 attempts is pretty good for someone who has never done it before, gj
---
Why aren’t you using barrows gloves
---
Being a low level HCIM currnetly. I’d still say no, it’s almost like taking a prestige away from risking the account. I’ve gotten to 87 mining this far with a rune pick and if I wanna risk my account at KBD or Callisto, it’s on me.
---
Wouldn't it take close to that amount of time to get a decent pk account going anyway. You trying to pk as a level 3?
---
Damn man, that sucks. Aww, I'm a shitbag :(. At least I'm not a shitbag in NA though LUL,haha lmfao holy shit
---
Think there’s 16 full days left as of today

Even without diamonds in your inventory? also did it keep happening after you logged out from completling the quest, and lets say logged back in the next day?
---
What you are looking for is instant gratification with no effort.
---
Thanks man. Really appreciate it. I definitely miss the old days. Killing dragons and eating cheese itz. Haha. Man... Time sure as hell flies...
---
I think ZMI to bloods is in the realm of 400-450 hours efficiently. I know bloods alone are around 330 hours of that. the most profitable path would see you do Nature, Death, Blood and would probably take 500 hours. At the end of the day it is a 99 that is basically no risk and nets you at least 150 mil profit.

Should I buy a bond or the membership? Bond looks cheaper.

I appreciate it, will for sure just that out here in about 20~ min

it depends, iron is significantly more grindy, but much more enjoyable. i started my iron a year ago cause i was close to maxing my main, now all i play is my iron and its almost 2k total after a year

Let’s add boomerangs to range and fletch slightly regular log + bronze bar, oak+ iron. And so on. Dragon attachment for magic boomerang added to drop table of a new demi boss in wild. Maybe a crocodile, kangaroo, or Steve Erwin type guy. Range method without need for ammo. Same speed as longsword
---
Most are, yeah but some aren't. The issue is that you have to go through a fucking customer support maze to get to the option of messaging them directly. At least it was like that about a year or so ago.

Yeah, it's against the RS rules to buy gold!

I was guilty of doing this back when Wyverns were one of the best GP methods in game. I'd purposefully half kill like 3 of them at the end of a trip so that when I got back from banking my loot would be waiting for me.

It's possible I saw a vid about training combat in NMZ where it is advisable to use melee punching bags and got it mixed up with what is best for points. I guess now I have to go farm some more quests as I'm at nearly enough for RFD and have like 12 bosses unlocked. I'll give it a go after this mining grind and see what happens. Appreciate your help!

Actually it was +/-2 hours a day, every day, for half a year. Then +/-14 hours a day, every day, for half a year. Had a lot of fun in the grind.

That's not really important at all. The odds of getting back to back of that drop is 1/262,144 ^2. The chance of rolling a 6 twice in a row on a die is 1/36 not 1/6.

Can we start a no friends clan chat
---
"Some people like it"... Like people who rent accounts and rwt? People who beg for gp on stream like fucking obnoxious children? The .001% of people who want to stake 10m at a time for fun? Are you really that determined to not let those people down? Really? Put down the die hard rs libertarian shit and be honest
---
Just the fact that it's a means of gambling isn't the only reason either. There's a ton of botting and rwting going on because of and IN the duel arena, and that's not to mention the shit content that gets made around it. It's a plague on the game and there's no defense you can make for it in good faith. It's just a barely legal shit smear on the game
---
I will probably try ranging them next time.  They are quite a long task either way.  I obviously made the op in exaggeration to be funny but I understand that the avg gp/kill does roughly equate to that, I am just salty haha.  Either way, I think it really comes down to preference on this task, some people are just gonna hate it, even if they do get lots of jaws and vice versa.

In RS3, if a non-boss monster leaves combat for a 10 seconds, it heals back to full HP. Would it be a good thing if OSRS get this as well?
---
&gt; gour is the "staple" item of Chambers of Xeric. If rigour falls in price less and less people do raids until the demand for rigour gets low enough that it goes back up. Then people do more and more raids until it goes back down and the cycle repeats. If you remove rigour from the equation the entire thing breaks. The same phenomenon happens with Theater of Blood and the Avernic Hilt.
---
You can absolutely remove the prayer scrolls from Chambers of Xeric as well as the Avernic Hilt from Theatre of Blood. Both do not belong there.
---
Raids 1 has the twisted bow, ancestral robes, d claws etc.
---
Raids 2 has the Scythe, Rapier, Justiciar. 
---
You act like they will become dead content.
---
&gt; Entire pvp accounts are built around rigour.
---
Irrelevant. It should not be catered to pures.
---
Eh, I'd say that is reading a bit too much into "your". It could have been other words like "a" but even as your it can be used without implying familiarity.
---
I'm just glad it was Zulrah I'm going dry on. Better to have a ton of ammo for the eventual blowpipe than to go 500 dry on something like sara...  
---
Either way I'm not sure if I have awful luck or amazing luck here
---
Yep. I’m 17 levels to max, and I expect it to take another several months, likely longer because the vast majority of the reminding grind is in agility and runecrafting. I worked out the time left a few days ago and I think I’ve got roughly another 300 hours for those 17 levels.

The bit about collecting on an alt IM while playing a main really piqued my intrest. 
---
What do you suggest? Ive always loved these types of modes in games (self found etc) but being a newish returning player I dont even know most quests or most items I see. I plan to keep on my main for awhile still but can start collecting useful stuff / grinding low f2p on IM whilist doing so.
---
Something very AFK, my first thought that comes to mind is fishing shrimps, stockpiling oak logs, not really into f2p mining (loads of bank running)
---
Wow it actually happened. Looking forward to the video.

Theoatrix has some videos that are great for new players.   YouTube theoatrix videos and you'll find stuff.

The bar isn’t that high.
---
Or an average of 8 hours a day, everyday, for a year
---
I'm 99% sure this is kempq
---
Imagine telling the devs responsible for designing the Fight Caves back in 05 that it's beatable on a level 4.
---
could be the same 4k people got bored and did it again. Two more times each.
---
uh, no, it's not item dupe, charges are not lost nor gained, they're just transferred. If it didn't work that way, there would be potential for charge duping.
---
It uses the remaining charges to charge the suffering. It's not item duping it's just a mechanic. All recoils have a shared amount of charges per account, and the noted ones do get used.
---
So some bugs are ok then? What he's doing is a PvM achievement, it's not affecting anyone, while tick eating and pray flicking can be used in PvP scenarios where not everyone can do tick perfect consistent bug abuses
---
It has come up before and it was something the OSRS Team was considering. But the reason against was would it provide much value to F2P? Like would it be a skill they'd want to train or just another skill for the sake of another F2P skill?
---
Solution to what?
---
It doesnt need a solution lmfao.
---
Its not being abused for anything game breaking and until a time or place where it has a negative impact on the game as a whole, should just be ignored.
---
Its a hell of an achievement and the discussion is whether its a 'bug' or not.
---
It is. No question.
---
The ROS has a 75 hp req for a reason.
---
Otherwise Recoils would be allowed to stack in the first place.
---

Damn bro they made the hairdressers in runescape into a real thing
---
Just tell them that trading the bots can get them banned as well.

As a PKer I'm insulted. Where's my book of darkness? I also need the zamorak staff since I'm on standard book for teleblock.

The rest looks good. Thumbs up.

gf or gp, only two options

I was hacked today and lost everything but they can’t recover anything.... fucking worthless

Fucking shitty ass titty fuck yes. That’s what runescape is about baby. Fuck you and your 99 runecrafting, I’m gonna go spread Charlie the tramps cheeks motherfucking fuck yeah, this is some hell yeah kind of shit
---
It's such a shame, I love maces in other games but if you ever decide to use one even for fun, people shit on you cause you ain't using the scimmy
---
He’s got 4 defense
---
next step: bot until jagex admins manually lower you hp level to 1, then do the fire cape at level 1.
---
CAPTAIN bwana rendi
---
wtf
---
It won't be kemp.
---
Man, and I thought that I made mountains out of mole hills.
---
It is a bug. 
---
Its using an item intended for 75HP accounts at lower hp than is supposed to be required.
---
Its not a gamebreaking bug or one that will do major harm like the cash duping but is a bug none the less.
---
Doesnt take away what an achievement this truly is though.
---
Ahh

i know this is a hot fucking take but seeing someone lose an absurd amount of money is the only way bank standers will think "gee, i think this may be rigged"

They don't exist in this version of the game
---
Is that my most likely bet? I know it’s entirely possible I could grind out 2 weeks of pet hunting and come up short so I’m looking for the highest probable pet.
---
It's effectively creating an unnoted item out of a noted item without the use of a bank, something that is not possible in the game. It's not a dupe, fine, but it's still an exploit that's going to be fixed.
---
LEVEL 3 WHEN
---
obligatory sarcastic comment
---
Because it's not their fault that your credentials were compromised and you did not setup 2FA. 2FA would have prevented the hack in this scenario.
---
I think I just jizzed
---
Useless question.
---
Any way to "snap" to another camera angle other than north? Kinda odd but I enjoy playing the game with east pointing up on the compass. Client only supports north as far as I'm aware. Any way to have it default east or at least just make it snap whenever you click on the compass? Maybe there's a runelite feature that I'm not aren't aware of?
---
You're transferring charges from a noted item to an unnoted one that is not meant to have them. It's an exploit, pure and simple. Fine, not a dupe. It doesn't really matter. A single item that is *intended* to be broken after 40 uses is no longer breaking, which is why I said it's effectively a dupe.
---
I'm not saying they do too much. I'm saying people shouldn't feel entitled to having a 24/7 manned customer support line when 99% of the customer problems are self inflicted.
---
But he isn't. All recoils are identical. He just stores the character attribute recoil charges left into the suffering.
---
that's the power of C H E S T B R A H
---
Except its bot a dupe and it's entirely how the mechanic was invented. I'm sorry ur a sweaty boy without a Cape.at 120
---
This game is so easy.
---
Definitely worthwhile, the change of pace and how you level make it even the more satisfying, watching YouTubers or reading guides tends to be still ((efficiency scape))
---
So if like me and don't care about that it's amazing
---
..91 Slayer and have gotten 70 crafting from the gem and dhide drops just to give a example /goals haha
---
When’s the lvl 2 combat fire cape Rendi?
---
I’ll support the game when they start having actual customer support
---
Unlike many suggestions....i dont hate this one.
---
It really doesnt sound to bad at all.
---
When is a good time to buy membership meaning account progression wise? I play mobile a lot but my account is f2p as of right now, is there any sales on membership also?

Feedback:

1. Put the Guild in Zeah. Don't wanna ruin the mainland nostalgia.
---
2. Construction outfit should give 2.5% exp boost.
---
I got over 300 regular KC and am now starting to get into the corrupts having around 75 right now. I enjoy the content just wish more came from it the blade is only really used as a cheaper scythe TOB option and the armor is useless
---
Maybe for someone who can use the ring, feels like an exploit to be using its effect despite not having stats for the actual ring, question really is if they'll take the capes away when they fix it or not
---
Since when can "poor" people afford a conventional coffin burial?
---
He isn't actually using what? The ROS? or tick manipulation? Because everything I've seen anyone say about this including Rendi has been that that's what he's doing. Tick eating and ROS recoil refilling. And you should take note that I specifically didn't state my personal opinion on tick manipulation.
---
the long hair works really well with that outfit but I think with others the short hair will be waay better
---
Think about it this way then: in an update back int 2015 they added an option to destroy a recoil to make your next one 40 charges again. What they're doing with the suffering is that exact same thing except adding the charges you would have lost by breaking the ring into the suffering. Also put into perspective if you have only 1 recoil. If it has 28 charges, why should the suffering add a flat 40 if it's a used ring?
---
Don't jinx it now.
---
/r/soccer pasta originally I believe.
---
50/50
---
Yo that would actually be an epic account.
---
For group ironmeme to come out before I’m fucking dead.
---
There is a major difference between an oversight by jagex and exploiting a game bug
---
IMO this is what happens when you add stuff on to shoddy coding. It's long been known that all the rings share the same charge, and that's weird. So adding an item into the game in such a way seems like it could only be intended at that point. That's the argument for it not being a bug anyways.
---
Argument for it being a bug would be like the developers didn't thoroughly investigate the impact that adding such an item into the game would make coupled with the fact all the lesser items (recoils) share the same charge might give it some funky, unintended mechanics.
---
Really having effectively a pool that subtracts an item every x amount of damage is just irresponsible IMO. So I really couldn't personally decide if it's intended or not. Also there would be the debate of "what's considered a bug?", but at least that argument is easier than the speedrun community decisions, because it's more "what does Jagex consider a bug?".
---
Naive question, but why was 4 the goal and not 3?
---
what the shit
---
Is this unique to recoil? Or would it work with a wealth, or a glory neck
---
Nice
---
it’s an intended game mechanic to allow you to use noted rings to charge the suffering. it is specifically allowed to work like that, that’s not an exploit
---
I watched a vid that recommended Rocky. Gem stall respawn times were too slow for me, but I'm at 98 rc with no pet, so we'll see about thieving....
---
I expected Dexter’s ending to be trash though. You can only recycle the same theme/formula so many times.
---
Solid post.
---
Ok, so as far as I've seen you're the only person who has a problem with all this. If Jagex has a problem with it, they would have at least addressed it by now since in your eyes this is just as sacrilegious as the OSB incident
---
How much do you have to hate yourself to go through all this shit for a meaningless cape? Crazy
---
I don’t get it
---
New Mace coming out gonna be really good.
---
I was here.
---
Nah it definitely came from /r/nfl first
---
Incredible or pathetic?
---
Watch his last guide, it explains the mechanics
---
The justice is under there
---
did you rail a line of meth before writing this?
---
Haha, yes! It’s so nice that I don’t have to sift shampoo and conditioner through my hair for 30 minutes every time I need to wash it.
---
Taking bets for when lvl 3 happens.
---
83 because stew stacks with saw
---
Jesus Christ
---
I am beyond confused.
---
Well we’re obviously talking civil court here. You’re not going to get a judge to award damages for a banned runescape account even if Jagex unfairly banned you.  It just wouldn’t happen.  I’m sure the TOS outlines that your account isn’t even your property and in that regard I’m sure the court would uphold the TOS as a declaration of what you’re buying when you pay for membership.
---
I don't claim to know the original pasta recipe but it does show up in NFL all the time.
---
You're using an item with a 75hp requirement without 75hp. You are converting noted items to unnoted (effectively) without the use of a bank. You are causing a degradable item to last endlessly. How are none of these exploits, let alone not all of them?
---
&gt;it's extremely unlikely to be fixed or for punishments to be given.
---
Nest box in inferno was fixed even though it was basically a detriment to even do. I don't expect punishments because the fault is Jagex's shoddy code, not any actual gamebreaking mechanics (like the world crash dupe from a few weeks ago).
---
I'm 69

---
I’d love to cop a bond, ran out of mems long ago and never made enough to renew
---
Calm down.
---
https://youtu.be/_iILSZhZoeA?t=263
---
The only part of this that could be considered an exploit is that you can add charges to the ring of suffering below 75 hitpoints.
---
The charges on the recoil is shared between each one. A future interaction similar to the recoil and suffering one this wouldn’t be possible with a glory
---
Fake. Sailing never passed the polls!
---
This is the way
---
Love to get one, membership  is a pain to keep
---
Using entity hider to prevent accidentally using fire runes on players instead of the altar. And zoom speed at 225 to be able to zoom in and out quickly. Scrolling two steps in to runecraft and one step back out to click on the bank, etc.
---
No, you still get them
---
Did he use obor kp method?
---
No, you poison the healers so you don't have to worry about them healing. That's where the extra exp comes from.
---
Just letting everyone know. I play a uim (btw)
---
That means I cant bank
---
Ir trade other players
---
By the way
---
Something like that could be neat. Originally Raids 2 was going to have an armor set for each style with special buffs inside the Raids but weaker outside the Raid.
---
Personally, I'd like to see the next tier of Armor be a bit weaker than current BiS, but if you wear the set (Helm, Body, and Legs) it gets an effect that makes it a bit better DPS than the current tier. That way Bandos, Armadyl, and Ancestral would all still be BiS with the Slayer Helm, but the new armor would be BiS without if you can use all 3 pieces (e.g. you can't swap the body to mix defences or such).

You have no experience with programming, do you?
---
It's obvious that the current implementation was a conscious choice, and is more complex than the alternative I proposed. It's probably better in most ways, but if you wanted to avoid people getting infinite recoils in fight caves then it has drawbacks.
---
We’re going to tell our grandkids about this shit.

If you're talking about an actual house party where people are just messing around in somebody's nice POH, then it's just for fun.  I didn't know people ever even did that anymore.
---
If you're talking about what actually goes on in the "House Party" world, which is that people open their maxed house for others to actually use for grinding such as for prayer, tele tabs, spellbook switching, or what have you, then apparently the reason people do that is because you can make an absolute killing from people tipping you.  I'm talking like 10m an hour and you're literally just standing there doing nothing.  Now I have no idea why the hell you'd tip a host since it's totally optional and the person is clearly already rich, but then again I also can't understand why anyone donates to twitch streamers for the same reason so I guess I'm just not on that wavelength.

This is so cool, thinking back to when the fire cape first came out and it being the best cape with such a challenge to achieve it; that only the elite accounts could obtain it. Now we have brand new accounts being able to obtain the cape with such simplicity. It’s makes you wonder how much longer it’ll be before we see something similar with the inferno cape. This game has truly changed over the years, amazing.
---

"better customer service" is a bold statement, it insinuates there is customer support right now

I think OP is insinuating that it would be more worthwhile to add fletching over agility, as it would require less devtime to implement
---
woooosh
---
Many players have trouble with getting their fire cape at 100+ cb just for reference.
---
missing the point
---
It’s actually the same, the 3rd tier prayers have a drain rate of 20 and augury rigour and piety have a rate of 40. So eagle eye + steel skin will drain 40 as well
---
No they don’t have to, and they don’t in practice either.  Not for cheating anyway.  You can argue that it isn’t fair but they aren’t required by law to do so.
---
We need someone with some movie magic to make a video about this with some epic level music showing xzact vs rendi vs woox.
---
Jagex should throw down on this too, first to level 3 firecape gets a statue near the fight caves dedicated to them.
---
Confirmation he’s just a clout chaser. Why go the effort of saying you won’t go lower then go back on your word?

I bet all the lvl4 posts put a fire under his arse as he realised he will be forgotten when the dust settles on this

saying the way ~~a disabled person~~ anyone chooses to use their time in a way that makes them happy is "sad", is, well .... *sad*

Maybe there is another way. Maybe they could hire more engire dev's. Maybe they can train other staff to work with the engine. Maybe they can outsource engine work. Maybe they can move past the current engine. Or infine other maybies.

I gambled my only 100k as a noob - doubled it then got up to 700k. Helped me a lot in the start. I seen people placing 20-50m bets one night though - the bot didnt pay out the 50m and poofed

If you actually broke a rule like cheating on the specific account that was banned, obviously not.

It doesn't have to is the point. There are decent arm based Android laptops out there, or weird 2 in 1's. The game performs better on Android too. I see more people who just play on mobile and don't have the actual hardware or the budget for a PC, but they have like a galaxy 10 because it's only like 20 bucks more a month to rent it under contract. 
---
I don't get why people say "that's not the point" as if they're the person that gets to decide how people use their phones, and it's some big deal when the only thing jagex has to do is stop disabling the ability to use the mouse, it's not like it's a hard project they just don't want people to have that access. They want them to use third party apps like octopus which can be used to essentially create bot like rebinds instead. 
---
It would be nice to have fkeys too. Just simple accessability features not some giant job to add mouse support. It's a native features on Android.
---
Flesh out an idea, not flush fyi

This was posted on his youtube in the community section : [https://i.imgur.com/7rEtNQx.png](https://i.imgur.com/7rEtNQx.png) Take it how you want though. He said something similar months ago. We'll have to wait and see.
---
He looks like someone who would dedicate so much time for this
---
Tutorial island to 2100 total took me about the same amount of time as 2100-2277. Many hundreds of hours difference in those last 77 levels...
---
steel scimmy &lt; d scimmy, noob ;)
---
These guys have way too much free time
---
No he's saying the interface means the record is from earlier than 2007. It's like mid 2006.
---
I actually saw UAEX back in the day. He was pretty well-known for his fire cape records.
---
2015-2025 is a decade too but yeah, you're kinda right. The 21st century started in 2001 so the 203rd decade starts in 2021, but the 2020s start tomorrow.
---
this is an avengers level threat
---
There seriously needs to be one ready to go ASAP. Love this mode. Need to have many leagues like this lined up similar to how diablo 3 has themed seasons. So much freshness and nuanse to this playstyle. I can see so much potential for this... start discussing jagex...
---
Drives me crazy that people post such insane collections with no price check
---
yeah 10/10 would be cooler restored than spray painted.

Have you ever done any farming irl lol? I can assure you it isn’t

[Lombardi] Rendi on who can get the lowest cb firecape: Him or xzact. “I don’t compare myself with anybody,” Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of himself. “I’ll let you interpret that however you want,” Rendi said.
---
I’m f2p now, got it while p2p
---
I think that he has to poison the melee monsters as they have a heal mechanic when you stand next to them. Defense gives the least combat so it is prefered over attack and strength.
---
You ever had level 1 farming irl and needed 59 to do a quest?
---
in all seriousness, I plan on sanding it down as it's pretty pitted and giving it a proper restore

Only the lowest Cmb gets the memorial

I'm in there, great people &amp; always helpful :)
---
The length on 1 task is a bit to long. Alltho you get great XP from the boss XP multiplier. 
---
Personally I would like the kills u need to complete a task halved, but then the droprates should have been changed slightly aswell to cope for less kills total.
---
&gt;first to level 3 firecape gets a statue near the fight caves dedicated to them.
---
That's nonsense, this has been far too much of a group effort to justify a statue only foe the final push, **especially** if that ends up being Woox, who's done hardly any of the theorizing for this whole thing.
---
1/2100 if the monster's level is actually set to 0

That's dope man ignore all the other haters. Great work!

i like to think its part of the flex, like "no price check because i dont care to ever sell it, only add to it"
---
Honestly 3 kill trips isn't bad.
---
There is no limit on how much of them you can kill, enjoy the xp. You just need a gargoyle slayer task to fight them. I'm doing them myself at the moment too.
---
I get up to 6 kill trips with tent whip, blow pipe and crystal halberd for spec. It's usually about 4, though.

Sorry I don’t play but love this community can someone explain why this is awesome?

is that not the difference?
---
with 4 you can just poison them
---
..i mean given the current method you need a ring of suffering to do the recoil method. So while you dont need to wear it as a hcim youd need the stats to be able to kill demonic gorillas for a zenyte. Cant really say what the lowest possible level would be.

Is that technically bug abuse then?

Agree it doesn't make sense that it doesn't have any damage % boost at all on it. But I think with all the other items it would be kinda broken if they added it now so they would have to change the items

I mean 140k in alchs on a cannon task isn't bad

in 2008 I had a lvl 70 or somewhere around it... Got to like wave 2 and noped tf out... still the furthest I'll ever get.

Quick tip! You can do the Ardougne Diary at 65 Farming if you're willing to grind out a +5 stew boost. Poison ivy bushes never die so you don't have to worry about it dying, either. If you don't want to grind out a stew boost, a garden pie will give you a guaranteed +3 Farming boost and let you complete the diary at 67 Farming. Also, you only need 70 Farming to plant the seed.

How hard is it to get on a normal account (about level 70)? I keep meaning to try it but tried years ago and failed miserably
---
Well no need to wait anynore...
---
Trudent lol. Absolutely no offense here saying this, but you might struggle a bit with something like zulrah if you are unaware of what a trident is/does. Not sure what your stats are, but zulrah can be a little rough to learn at first especially if youre not 80+ range/mage with good defense.

If Rigour is your entire cash stack, I sincerely advise you not to buy it unless you're actively experienced with high level bossing and explicitly going to use it for bossing scenarios. The guy who posted this is very likely merching Dextrous prayer scrolls and will probably tell you anything to get you to buy them like a sleezy used car salesman who doesn't care about your current situation.
---
This post fails to mention that Rigour uses up twice the prayer points Eagle Eye does. If you're using Eagle Eye for slayer already, Rigour will require double the upkeep meaning double the prayer potions. If you're using a Divine Ranging Potion in both scenarios, the ranged DPS increase is only roughly 2% while using 50% more prayer points per minute. Rigour also requires 74 Prayer, meaning you'd have to get the prayer levels for it if you only have 70.

Ahh the armchair reddit pvmers come in with flawless logic once again. Gear prices fluctuate, you make more gp/hr using rigour than using arma, the armor can easily dip 1-2M in a day and then you’re stuck, consistently buying and selling gear loses money or you’re just sitting with it when you don’t need it. (Still losing you money) I surely hope your comment was intended as bait.

Wouldn’t be possible though since you can’t get Ring of Suffering at cmb lvl 4
---
Very nice! Thoose seeds are looking good :)  
---
You still not interested in selling me the bronze? :D
---
Lmfao. Arma’s defensive stats are essentially fuck all. The mage prayer defense over black dhide is pretty much irrelevant because in any scenario you’re already praying mage over anything else (Inferno). The melee/range defense differences are legit fuck all. Please elaborate how it’s even remotely busted.
---
That and maul rushing were kind of his thing.
---
Its already been done randi
---
I have completed it I'll give that a shot.
---
Shades of Morton rework for construction would be awesome.
---
How did you get the milk? Im still stuck at that point
---
It's still closer than 1/10000. Most players are med levels and most high level players are pretty bad at pvm.

no balls

Anything but the sand casino
---
You can chin at the spiders in the temple under zeah, not sure what its exactly called but the dungeon where sarachnis is
---
Lmfao.
---
Tfw you come back to the sub 8 hours after level 4 firecape and theres no level 3 firecape yet
---
Does the DHL have the same DPS as the hasta on non-dragons since it’s literally made from one? Thinking of Corp specifically.

The relevant items were traded over.

Depends on what you do to earn gp

This has been amazing to witness

I remember when RuneScape didn't have a client yet, we had to play on the RuneScape website.
---
Are you feeling it now, Bwana Krabs?
---
very cool I love all these fire cape posts! 😎
---
Lol that’s what I was thinking
---
That's not going to be faster than a blowpipe
---
Lol. Fight caves would have been faster and easier with atleast decent combat stats. All im seeing is a random guy not willing to invest the time nor effort for basic combat training. And everyone is losing their minds lmfaooooo
---
I firmly believe the WC guild should be changed to something like "Woodworking Guild". Aren't all other guilds the place where the respective cape is purchased? Not WC or Farming.... Thanks Zeah..
---
We could add your idea and fletching capabilities/shops in the current WC guild and not move any skill masters.
---
You are wrong, but good point, this post is misleading
---
19 fire cape waiting room.
---
What are you loling about I was right
---
I tried it there, it's not very effective with all the stuff blocking the spiders. Very tedious to setup for lackluster xp.
---
Level 3 is worse than level 4 so. Its worse
---
Man your opinions are just wrong. Games are built for the players. A change like this would disrupt and make a majority of the people who play this game angry and create a frustrating atmosphere.
---
You're so concerned with your perceived continuity that you completely misunderstand the purpose of video games and their relationship with the people that play them.
---
Zezima is my dad.
---
The whole point of the shit they're doing is to see who can do it at the lowest possible level. At higher levels anyone with 2 brain cells can kill jad.

Im level 122. Do you have any idea how long did it take to train my stats? Killing experiments, burying bones and crafting my own nats for alching. Why does this low level dude get so much attention yet everyone else hates me even im superior to a level 4 lol? Seriously
---
Your hair creates oil, when you shampoo and condition the oil gets removed from your hair, so your hair creates more to compensate. Keep doing this and your hair is producing massive amounts of oil so then you don't shower 1 day and your hair becomes incredibly greasy
---
Added you

That's why I wrote it lel
---
Slater rip off
---
Wouldn't and couldn't are not the same word.
---
120 combat is still a lot better than some level 4 dude lmfaoooo
---
Ah yes, you can really tell what those 3 pixels are supposed to be, my bad.
---
Minus few mil when it dips (not if)
---
It's healthier for your hair to only use shampoo on your hair a few times a week. Water while you're showering is fine but over cleaning your hair with soaps dries it out and can make it brittle.
---
Source: I'm a dude who has been growing out my hair for nearly 5 years.
---
what's that weapon?
---
Let me fucking grind my skiller and play my own game? Fucking hell
---
Yeah if you're aiming to stake s couple mil at a time. I'm talking 50/100m minimums
---
Happens alot on runelites resizeable fixed mode. Just make your window larger and then resize it back to original.
---
What is the best way to protect myself in the Wildy? I want to start grinding out my Dragon pick on my ironman, but I'm worried about pkers coming along and ruining my day.
---
Yep. We don’t know if they’re included in the mean, there’s no reason to exclude them from the median. Plus, Ironmen are usually poor AF for a long time.
---
We've done it. 
---
We achieved our peak, it's all downhill from here
---
Gave it a view for you but not a pvp fan myself - is there anything new ish? Or just people one hitting eachother?

Last time i tried pvp was when korasi was released.

Fire cape without rs account

You can log in to the official runescape website (runescape.com) and log in on the account tab on the top right. After logging in  go to email and communication preferences, and there you should be able to set up an email if you haven't.
---
Get 83 construction, for about 23m~
---
[This](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360001528005) is their resolution. It gives me no option to link an email however via the client.

I remember when everyone just accepted that like some mid 30s was the lowest possible back in like 08
---
20k gp +20k key for ecu (alches for 75kgp) is retarded
---
second order effect: incentive to use ALL keys instead of chests into the altar for printing gp at high gp/h untill crystal key reaches 55k, also would perma kill chest opening
---
low iq

Torfinn lol
---
Hey I was there
---
It's not a bug because it's intentionally like that so you don't end up with multiple recoils of different charges. It is unexpected use of an intended feature though maybe
---
Holy shit
---
So for this method, I’m assuming I don’t use overloads and dharoks? Just pray piety and best melee gear?
---
Why? I agree with that comment entirely.
---
Yes, Rigour is extremely strong. But it is 50m that you'll NEVER get back. Where as any armor you buy, no matter what, you can always resell it and get your money back (more or less).
---
The fire cape space race of 2019, great way to end the decade!
---
24 here, 25 in a month. 
---
Daily smoker, daily scaper.
---
RS3 has it, it's called Magic Notepaper. It works pretty well because they're 1k a pop so it cuts into profit considerably. I don't think OSRS needs it though, I can't think of anywhere they'd even be used. Plus it wouldn't be voted in because it's very ezscape and promotes lazy gameplay.
---
guy in the video had his stats reset for botting, so when he got the fire cape he wasn't lvl 4
---
[lvl 3 fire cape has been done before via PAFT into jad wave to skip the first 62](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWMmQSq1ADA)
---
People still play computer games lmfaooooo dead rn
---
Why is he lvl 4 and not 3 what did getting the account to 4 do that he needed that he couldn’t do at 3?
---
Yeah that's my experience so far.
---
Can you kill thermy off task?
---
Congratz!
---
Which strategy did you use?
---
Agreed, though for me its about flipping, which is my main source of gp. I have about 200m, but if I bought a dex scroll, that reduces my ability to flip items by 25%.
---
Use expeditious bracelet
---
is that a bee
---
Pretty sure you cant touch anything in the cave off task
---
Only way I see this working is 1 spell turns one single item into a note. Not like bones to peaches where the whole inventory is impacted
---
I track my ips just for this reason so I can recover any hacked account. Work smart not hard my friend
---
Nobody likes you when your levelll 3
---
Drumgun has the highest playtime afaik. He afked outside some random bank at fally for years after he entirely maxed out simply to increase his total playtime. Crazy.
---
Bringing Titan fans joy.
---
Sit around the firecape and sing the firecape song. F-I-R-E-C-A-P-E S-O-N-G song!
---
I can’t login without an email.
---
Awesome, glad you were able to find it! Good luck!
---
How much crafting xp for that?
---
I mean he could literally just stop before getting a cb level
---
How did you login in the first place? Also, is your account before 2010? If not, this is pretty damn weird lol
---
The fire cape can only be obtained by defeating Jad, one of the highest level monster in the game (and actually was the highest for quite some time). It's a really good cape in terms of stats, but it is also a bit of a status symbol that can't be bought.
---
(Well, technically you can pay somebody to beat Jad for you, but that's account sharing and frowned upon by Jagex)
---
Beating Jad alone can be a challenge, even at higher levels. However to make things worse, players have to beat dozens of waves in non-stop combat just to face him, without any chance to restock on supplies or leave without resetting your progress. Even with excellent stats and supplies, players will typically spend hours learning and practicing and attempting the challenge before finally managing to win.
---
For a level 4 player to obtain it is just insane. It means it was done without prayer to nullify the massive amount of damage taken, and with only the bare minimum of combat experience gained. It would have required an intense amount of time and effort to complete. But also an incredibly detailed understanding of how the game works at a very low level, along with hundreds - if not thousands - of extremely precise actions without room for more than 1 or 2 small mistakes, likely over the course of several hours. I imagine even a bot would have trouble doing this perfectly and consistently.
---
I may be overexaggerating how insane of a feat this was, since I had never beat Jad myself (died against him, and didn't want to spend another hour fighting my way back up to him). But I don't think I am that much.
---
For reference, the minimum combat required has been getting lower and lower for the entire past year. New tricks discovered and better execution of them brought the record down from ~35 to just 4 combat over the course of a year or so, with attempts from various others.
---
It is just absolutely incredible.
---
&gt; Using the intended function of a 75hp ring.
---
Using the intended function of the ring of recoils.
---
He is using a 75hp ring in his inventory as a gimmick to convert noted rings into recoil charges on the unnoted rings.
---
Do you think prayer flicking is a bug? Getting infinite prayer points was never an intended mechanic either. This is *less* of a bug because he's not using a single mechanic jagex didn't intend to be possible.

Congratz! Nice skill for your first 99 :)

Alright I’ll post a video soon kms

Congrats

Countdowns are cringe, though

It came out early 2013. It hasn't been 7 years yet, so saying  it came out 6 years ago is completely justifiable.

I'm like 102 with 80 prayer and I still can't keep my cool long enough to kill Jad, nor do I have the patience to attempt FC more than once in a night because of how damn long it takes.

Kudos to this fucking madlad for proving yet again that I'm just a bitch.
---
And here I thought it was a....maul

Yeah I realized after I typed that that 39k is honestly not that high for what I’ve seen in this sub Reddit
---
Lichurally chaunced
---
They will prioritize healing other enemies over themselves if other enemies near them are under 50%, and they will alternate between healing and regular attacks. So you can recoil a blob next to them to skip them healing themselves and recoil the full kill.
---
Xzact did it on a twitch vod iirc
---
I'm obsessed with Summoning Salt's docs. I dont even play most of these games but he makes the videos so engaging I dont think twice of watching an hour long documentary on the history of Castlevania speedruns.

Bit late.

Don't we all?
---
That's awesome. Also love your presearing tab a man of culture I see
---
Which makes very little sense since an attempting account is going to be level 3. Either he has just recently failed (while being really far into the caves) or he's just trolling.
---
I got my pet on tutorial island, ez
---
Your math is... wildly off. Straight off the bat I can tell you're not using the optimal xp pathing of 2 attack/def/ranged. 43 hits with ranged and 107 hits with melee just does not produce anything like the numbers you just said.
---
Got a source on that percentage?
---
I'm not downplaying the difficulty of that at all, and I'm not forgetting anything. I'm just pointing out that what's already been done is harder than what's left to do.
---
Trying to balance metal weapons is pointless. I don't understand why people like OP even make these threads complaining. What do they want? DMace gets buffed and is still not used due to having lower dps than DScim? DMace gets buffed and becomes better dps than DScim, rendering the later useless?
---
RS3 is only now trying to fix this problem by acentuating differences in weapons types, and they have much more to work with since their combat system isn't barebones as fuck
---
If it’s so game breaking, go do it and get past wave 3
---
lvl 3 with firecape and lunars, nice
---
Yeah I mean you can get pretty consistent quick kills at Zulrah. My buddy I'm referencing is Venezuelan as well so I'm sure he had external incentives to camp Zulrah ;)
---
Not possible as of yet. The current strategy for killing the 180s requires another monster be alive for them to waste heals on, and right now there's at least 2 waves that can't be beaten with this method.
---
Pretty lit vid. Love the Pure Crew shoutout, used to chill in there a while back and haven’t enjoyed PvP much with my 95combat account.
---
I can’t even do it on my main yet lol
---
I normally do slayer but this time around I wanted to start at a higher combat lvl to make it a little less suicide enducing.
---
Thank You!
---
He had pizza
---
Raids r something I thought I'd never see in runescape.
---
Correct, I've said that in a comment higher in this comment chain. Makes the method even better, I guess.
---
They need to rebalance some monster weaknesses so that crush, stab, and slash defense aren't the same for so many monsters. Adds more variety.
---
Good Job! You should get yourself a main weapon though as godswords are typically only used as spec weapons!
---
Got to 70+ cb and completed heroes quest within lile 8months of playong OSRS on or off thid year.

Took me like 2 or 3 years first time around in 2006.

Sell it for a whip

That’s probably what he meant. I don’t believe the crabs on fossil island would be any better xp though just possibly less crowded and you can pick up fossils there
---
Just get used to typing "osrs \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" into google.
---
I'm CB 93 and I still suck to much to get one lol
---
I'd go even further and say that's the facial expression of a guy that has 2 accounts: one "buying" a spinach roll for 1m, and one on the other side of the bank selling one for 400k.
---
it literally translates to boss/master
---
It's weird but tested: ranged poison only does 1 "4" hitsplat on the 180 and then continues 3-3-3-3-3-2-2-2-2-2-1-1-1-1-1. But for melee poison, it DOES start with 6, 5 times in a row. 
---
2 poisonings can be enough if recoiling the 180 to half hp first though. But then I'd count that as a recoiled 180.
---
I just turned virtual levels on runelite, it's not the exact ame, but it's something
---
You look like an experiment
---
Don't you mean OUR computer screen?
---
This would have been 1000x easier to fake if he just ::renderself while standing on someone else who *did* have a firecape
---
Find a way to gain no exp while dealing damage and it will be possible.
---
How do you figure? Once and osrs account always a oldschool right? Did they move them all over to rs3 when it was made? I had a classic account too I remember I could play rs1 and 2 on that same account
---
Are fossils good money? Or what is their use?
---
It seems odd to me to pay money so you don't have to play the game you're paying to play.
---
Level 4 infernal cape now
---
It's extremely unlikely that the ranger hits two 0s on 1 Def, but even if it were to happen it attacks every 4 ticks so you have more than enough time to rock cake twice and then begin tick eating.
---
Well the second method isn’t really afk cause you gotta flick rapid heal every couple minutes to stay at 1hp, right? Or am I missing something?
---
It took a century to beat the 4 minute mile in track. Once one person did it then everyone started beating it.
---
It's vastly easier to recoil one to half hp than it is to fully recoil one to death entirely. You skip the entire lengthy part of the process and don't have to jump in and out of the 180's range several dozen times.
---
Mage only kills

I got to about 600 total level before joining members. I enjoy the early f2p grind and once you get to the 500 total f2p world it is basically a ghost town. My goal was to get to 750 f2p total level but I was burning out and decided to get members.
---
In hindsight, if you know you enjoy the game and can afford members, just do it. I enjoyed the early f2p grind, but it really does just waste time if you're gonna become a member anyways.
---
But if worked for me because I was returning to the game for the first time and had only played f2p as a kid, so it was nostalgic. Members would have likely overwhelmed me since I could hardly remember anything I did let alone the infinite members content I never did.
---
Gotcha, haha. Thanks man.
---
They are better exp at a higher level. I kill 3 sand crabs so fast that sometimes my char will sit there and not attack for a short time. That's wasted exp.
---
I actually did Sand Crabs until 65-70 Attack, Strength, Defense.
---
It entirely depends on your time commitment to the game. I quested out of the gate and got mid 40s cb (quest if you haven't finished them all). Then just get BIS and sit there about 30-40 hours per skill. You'll be mid 60s at least.
---
I want to say it took me roughly 2 weeks from start to finish to be around 70 in all melee and I left to start Slayer and quest grind.
---
the impact on pure builds are temporary and short term.
---
long term outcome is in the player interest by making rigour/augury more fair to obtain.
---
items rise and crash all the time, this is objectively no different than buying a BiS item for 500mil and seeing it crash to 200mil next year.
---
Is there a video??
---
That's... not a lot, all thing considered. 
---
I would have thought having half the country on fire would be more deadly than this. The cold damage we take from winter kill easily as many people every week, with extra casualty caused by snow fall attack and temperature drop caused by unlit brazier.
---
In any case, I refuse to abandon my dark humor as long as the kc is under three digits.
---
Looks beautiful, but how does it feel?

Also, what is the escape key?

It's over. He's done it. Put himself down in history. Nobody can top this.

You can always use the runelite function to bind any key as an F key.

My laptop doesn't have f keys either and it's absolutely crucial for pvp.
---
Thank you runelite for making the game playable 😁.
---
Hmm
---
I’m here from the FP, can you explain why this is so groundbreaking? Ty
---
It's unnecessary.

This is all a psyop by big purple sweet

After combat 3 it'll be minimal XP fire capes

Oh well. Still funny :)

Hah this is cute

---
Lovin the split bottoms d med look. Sexy bastard.
---
I have never beaten the fight caves and am very impressed you did this on mobile, but i must say that it was very brave of you to post your achievement only a few hours after the level 4 fire cape. Congratulations again on your achievement
---
Must've been tuff. Did you take breaks in between? 
---
How is this even possible? 
---
Can you list your daily schedule?
---
I'd personally do the vene safespot. Can safespot it on spawn with a kbow.
---
Go to Jagex suppor.... PHAHAHA.
---
OT: try twitter maybe with a Jmod, hopefully someone will get back too you.
---
The amount of people I've seen post this same exact situation up here is surprising to me...mostly because it was exactly what happened to me. Started fresh on OSRS with basically no friends left playing besides the one that got me back in it, and immediately went for and got my untrimmed farming cape because I thought it would be fairly unique. Guess not lol
---
Rc
---
.
---
^slow
---
Yeah I can tell by the way it says "Adam Sandler" on the front
---
Yea but I am pretty sure combat is 20 min afk timer, someone can correct me.
---
I usually never log out in the 10 min aggressive window for Sand Crabs.
---
Am I the only one utterly sick of these posts when they're real? I feel like the scrooge of rs

Congrats!

The people I tank for, give the tank boots drops so it could be worse.
---
I dont think my gear is too bad, I have a 34 prayer bonus, and dragon boots only add def boost, which isn't useful with prayer
---
Jesus, they don't want people getting max combat fast do they? Sucks you can't haha.
---
Can I get unbanned?
---
Yep. OSRS gold goes for about $0.47/m now and RS3 gold goes for $0.10/m on RWT websites so 1:4.2 sounds about right considering they have about a 10-15% profit margin on swaps.
---
This is the way.
---
25  currently as well my boy, FDB!
---
Damn, this dude really did it, wow
---
It is just a game and he can do whatever he wants on it. At the end of the day you're playing to have fun, not compare stats and gear to other people.  If he finds staking fun so be it. You're so far up your ass it's kind of funny.  If the dude is spending irl $$$ buying GP then yea, he may have an issue.  Just because he likes to chunk his bank doesn't make him a gambling addict.
---
The only reason i mentioned that was I assumed he saw the level 4 post. Idk what difference it would make asking about a hcim and the "lowest" level possible if just doing regular methods. And you don't need 43 prayer now either so -_- I had it in my head about the Ros method for some reason so i applied it here. Dunno why.

No limits to humans. Just like Kipchoge
---
i would recommend to sart slayer with base 50 or 60.
---
Get your d scimm soon and then buy a blackmask. Very good combat xp, a lot of different tasks, good gp/h. You also learn a lot about runescape since every task is a new monster to kill in usually another regoin :)
---
Way to hit it the second time, pussy
---
bruh look in settings on the osrs app
---
the boss has the annoying lightning mechanic that i don't like and the total hp is too high for a mid-level boss. 
---
But that aside, my only advice is ditch the blowpipe as that cuts into your profits. Crossbow + amethyst bolt &amp; Whip is better imo.
---
Wow, that's awesome! How many years did that take you?
---
It takes the average person with good gear 45 min to an hour + on high level accounts to complete the challenge that grants you this Fire Cape. 
---
Through game mechanic manipulation and intense concentration and perfect execution (and God knows how much time until he releases the video, but I'm guessing 100 hours or something crazy), someone managed to get the cape on a noob account (level 4) when the lowest combat to ever get it not too long ago was 18 or so (an impressive feat nonetheless.)
---
Do you still carry around your cash stack like this
---
my advice is to not bring a blowpipe. Crossbow and broad bolts works fine.
---
If it doesn't fix it, then it's a pointless waste of time. It's not impossible to have weapons of different attack speeds be viable. Not everything needs to have the same attack speed tier.
---
I always wanted to do mobile at work, but I'm afraid of my phone accidentally connecting to work wifi and me getting yelled at by IT.
---
Calling fake due to the increase in rc levels nice progress tho
---
How is it a terrible take? Rigour undeniably uses more supplies and cannot be resold. If Rigour is your first upgrade you most likely are buying it with your entire bank, which is a problem because Eagle Eye is good enough and doesn't require committing 50m you can never get back. There are a lot of people who have bought Rigour and regretted it because it eats up too many resources.
---
The truth is that not every player has the money to camp Rigour everywhere. Not every player has the ping to flick Rigour perpetually, either. Just because Rigour is the most powerful prayer doesn't mean it's the magical one-size-fits-all upgrade for every player everywhere.
---
Demand time played screen
---
It's a runelite spellbook recolour, and holy sandals havent had a prayer requirement for 2 momths now.
---
If only my 4th grade self knew how to take screenshots back in 04/05. :(
---
What?
---
&gt; That’s more money than you can make doing anything else in OSRS.
---
The top streamers get more than $50k

Can you still get 2 hp in dmm?

Looks like aq p w lol

I see controls and in top right it just has toggle function button.

I think rendi held records in rs2 as well?

no one tell Arlind
---
The things I can make out in the top two rows are warrior helm, ah skirt/staff/hood, and coins. Notes are too blurry.
---
Edit: two notes on the fourth row look like broken guthans pieces. And then logs in fifth row.

That is a fantastic idea, thank you!

Do you mean bad religion

I never bot check ppl with stats. I just wanted to point it out that they’re super weird at the cooking guild bank.Why do they not get the cooking cape? They must have to leave the guild at some point unless they literally bought all the yew logs and bow strings for 200m fletching at once. 
---
Are all the account at green dragons with rune chain bodies, dragon swords and games necklaces are just peoples afk green dragon alts?
---
8.1/10 for an adam sandler movie??!!!??!!
---
Dude live your life and only play when you feel like it. Don’t listen to the people who literally take more pride of their runescape account than their real life social life and what not.
---
Haha my husky mix does this as well
---
I don't know about dmm but didn't tourney worlds have that thing where you could change your skills? So maybe there...
---
Buuut dmm doesn't exist anymore so there's that.
---
Got bored and decided to screw around in the cooking guild like I used to as a kid spent about 2 hours getting flour and making pies, cakes, and pizzas.
---
Top right corner you see two symbols:
---
Ear: What you have to listen to. Other people call what you need to do.
---
Mouth: What you have to call for others to do. &lt;--- This is what you asked for.
---
If time is money then why are you wasting your time playing runescape? And then trying to high horse someone who plays it differently than you?
---
&gt; If it doesn't fix it, then it's a pointless waste of time.
---
it does fix it. what needed fixing is the slow attack speed. making it whip speed fixed it, therefore it's fixes it and is not pointless.
---
&gt; Not everything needs to have the same attack speed tier.
---
Strawman fallacy. where did i say 2h swords need to be whip speed?
---
Wow great post
---
Perfect 10's don't exist
---
1 hp accounts were botted account that had their stats all set back to 0 exp including hp
---
Dragon boots..fucking cancer boots holy fuck
---
Use d
---
Think you answered your own question bud
---
Well....username definitely checks out
---
I was getting my biggest hits ever with the godsword was doing 36-41s with it whip only gets me 28s
---
Is this why there's shit all over the grand exchange??
---
Prayer can be used for many things, but in the fight cave the most used ones are, protect from missiles and protect from magic. When used, these prayers can negate damage from the corresponding attacks. To fight the main boss TzTok Jad, or just Jad, the majority of players will require these overheads. Jad switches between those two attack styles and the player must use the correct prayer to survive the attack. If the prayer is not activated in time, Jad can hit up to a 97, enough to kill all but the highest level players (max hitpoints level is 99).
---
Hope this helps
---
But how did he even kill any of them and still have low combat skills?
---
Don't think you buy rune pouch with slayer points homie.  You have to go kill ppl in the new bh
---
We’ll find you no matter the cost
---
&gt;Arma is shit compared to Rigour.
---
With or without Rigour Arma is still BIS for Ranged though
---
Doubled?
---
im not doing it because it makes me cool and unique, im doing it because this sub is plagued with fcape "achievement" posts and have continued it into the rendi v xzact competition as a joke.
---
No. Karil and Ahrim don't count. Ranging and maging are girly, and Verac and Guthan wear skirts so they don't count either. Torag counts for two because he's so thicc, and Dharok counts for two because of his Chad stride and massive gonads.
---
Yeah, the "exploit" is useless in all applications except low level fire capes. You can't get an inferno cape with it due to lack of safespots, you don't use recoils in CoX or ToB, and there's literally no reason to do this in PvP. Leaving it in breaks nothing and keeps the game awesome.
---
Which *could* further indicate it's an alt and it's being afk'd.  Or Venezuelan.
---
I'm chopping redwoods while I shit at work right now baby. Screw your IT department get gains.
---
its called 2007scape for a reason.
---
You answered your own question. Grind out another 750 pts and get both
---
Just came here to downvote all the Kemp q comments.
---
they're 750 slayer points
---
Bullshit. Please do not spread lies on this sub.
---
Link pls, i have a osrs themed wall goin and want more stuff
---
BIRDNESTA, BIRDNESTA, HE SMITED FOR YOUR HASTA
---
Can someone tell me how he stored all those recoils without a ring of suffering?
---
Rune pouch is definitely more important but it might be easier for you to get 15 bounty hunter points instead of spending 750 slayer points
---
In osrs, yes. 
---
Late RS2 added a 7th brother that was a mage/melee hybrid with guthan effect but for prayer.
---
So how did this guy successfully defeat the boss without enough prayers? Is he just that fucking good— did he dodge them?
---
Imagine being this used to cheating that you don't even realize that you're cheating.
---
nothing gets past this guy
---
Can confirm, I came back without actually knowing anyone.  I got 99 farming in 4 months, my next highest level is 77 Slayer (not including combats)
---
The pleasure is all mine
---
Tbh it's just easier to kill the healers..
---
Sometimes they’ll offer incentives like “I’ll pay u 2m to help me get these items for my collection”
---
Not if it's a high volume item like dart tips or logs.  Can't really manipulate an item that's traded millions of times a day.
---
If it's some weird shit like black knives (p+), it's definitely a scam though.
---
BA is not pvp or team vs team, it's vs NPCs. So it helps his point.
---
Also BA provides a BIS item so, you know.
---
Yeah, I'll DM you the link.
---
Ah haven't done those in years forgot to check rewards from quest itself.
---
Soon
---
You're a sick, sick man. Find help please, we're all worried about you!
---
I got RC pet the day after my B day this year because I was drunk and logged on with a friend who was hunting pet post 99 RC and I did one run of bloods and got it; hopefully you have similar luck in your endeavors!
---
You are literally the size of Odablock.
---
Me fucking too, I cried myself to sleep cause 11 year old me was gonna buy full zammy and after getting scammed I only had 150k left. Never forget.
---
rendi is honestly insane
---
I actually do with they would buff it. This game would be more fun if there were more viable weapons. 
---
Of course, you’re free to use whatever weapon you want. But you’re at a disadvantage in most cases. Especially PvP.
---
Just turn off your WiFi completely
---
idk about you but i lag so badly in 330 that i built my house up because im too lazy to constantly hop to and from it
---
How was it questionable in RS2 at the time?
---
I need it 😬😬
---
Swamp lettuce good.
---
 I'd like one please :)
---
60xp is only half of level 2.
---
That is some terrible spelling, holy shit.
---
18 here. Played osrs when I was 13 and played reg RuneScape when I was 7. My brother's got me into it.
---
Doubt. Its pretty rare for jagex to just purge accounts like that
---
Idea open to targeted abuse.
---
wants an adult  and non-toxic community but was dumb enough to gamble away his money staking
---
Like other guy said 1 and 13 prayer pures are pretty much dead unless you are okay with risking 500k each time. 31 the new meta for gmaulers
---
1year of hard work, PS I hate RC to I get the point of this picture and this is basicly me when I set myself goals on grinding RC I quit after half way of a lvl
---
Good idea but how would you know if people werent just reporting for the hell of it
---
Also 9/10 people who trade at the GE are scammers so just never trade
---
When your friend says on new year's eve: See you next year!
---
Probably in college if they were 6 in 2005
---
Buying tbow for max cash btw
---
They hated him because he told them the truth
---
Unless you’re a pure who doesn’t want Hp xp there’s absolutely no reason you should consider alching as a way to actually train mage
---
If you get scammed in 2019 it's your fault. We aren't kids anymore.
---
 Congratz! Like i do to most people that keep posting saying they have no friends, feel
---
Free to join the clan im in. Cc is gwd fury, we are always chilling and helping others.
---
"This would be worth more cut"
---
Gz on rc progress
---
You talking about condescending manners is pretty hypocritical if I’m being honest. You don’t know his GF, and for someone who like doesn’t play many or any games at all, it’s not hard to see why they might find them childish. Different people live different lives and hence have vastly different views on everything, so I wouldn’t be so quick to say she’s being condescending when you literally have no clue what she’s like as a person
---
I'm assuming you'd really want (Avg no. of herbs harvested per patch \* X) - Price of seed and the largest value from that (or assume largest negative from original) for best profit? No pre-built calculator or guide for this I suppose?
---
I didn't see the "pvp world" specific part. Thought this was just in general. But still, Just dont trade people on pvp worlds and you wont accidentally be pulled out of safety?
---
Players will always use whatever means they can to take advantage of other players, and no matter hard Jagex tries to prevent this it will still happen. 
---
Adding wilderness ditch won't keep people from geting lured, GE won't prevent players from getting scammed. Jagex can't protect people from their own stupidity, the best way is to learn from experience.
---
If people keep asking Jagex to fix it on their end we end up with things like removed free trade and removed wilderness.
---
You want them to stream them breaking the rules by getting capes for other people? How clever of you.
---
You said "more than anything else", whereas it's clearly not. Being Boaty, Sick Nerd, etc will net you more than 1k a week, so it's not more than anything else
---
It's ~5 hours a day of Runecrafting. Yeah, that's unbearable to some but then there's also people out there that sit on their computer for 16 hours a day
---
1/1012. GL next kill
---
imagine killing zulrah 39,000 times without augury
---
Adam Sandy bad, Dwayne Rockman gud
---
They do not. 9HP is a thing because you used to start with 1,000 experience in HP back in Classic. When RS2 came out and you were able to transfer your character over, it was level 9. 
---
Oldschool is a separate game than RS3. It never had a connection to RSC or RS3 and therefore nobody has 9HP on it.
---
This message brought to you by the #1 9HP account on RS3 (or I used to be anyway, until I leveled it and maxed my account and moved to OSRS)
---
Hmmm is this better than mutagen at 6kc?  Idk what drop rates are
---
Dumb argument, I’m opposed to 120 for what some other guy stated but “PlAy rS3 ThEn” is beyond stupid
---
not his usual kind of movie. I normally hate adam sandler but he did a really good job in this one, honestly one of my new favorite films.
---
Yeah it probably would be much better as a minigame
---
Csgo skins are straight playing stocks though, i profited $1400 over 4 years on them lol it’s how i paid for all my games as a kid
---
Calling Jan 7th, 2020 will be the date of the 3 combat fire cape.
---
I doubt everyone has been in this situation, subreddit is full of pre eoc players. 
---
We aren't in 2006 or 2013 anymore, Ge exists, almost nobody trades random people who aren't scammers
---
So what's the best pures atm and what stats they got I've been out of the game for a while and want to make a ok char ... and is void pure still a thing?
---
I'm at 1054 now without them. Got another eternal though so I cant complain since it's not a pegasian.
---
Knighted by saradomin himself😂😂
---
The problem is they should take a few months off to work on the engine, security and all that but players would prefer new content
---
Ah I see. From just the post alone it’s hard to tell. The user could’ve been black for all I know.
---
So I keep seeing pog on this subreddit. And I’m not sure what it means. In the military it means “person other than grunt” what does it mean in runescape??
---
This is genius!
---
There is a guy with close to 80k Vorkath kills, Vork takes significantly longer to kill and is far less AFK. 39K pales in comparison.
---
id love to have a look :)
---
Arent we all?
---
Why tf do you call it a rune xbow, cbow is literally the same amount of characters, more accurate, and you don't have to reach your finger as far.
---
Scammed
---
I feel like this could be abused tho. But it’s a good idea nonetheless
---
What's your secret?
---
I understand your point, although I cannot come up with situation where that would make harm to someone legit player
---
What makes me dumb? Black people use that term all the time. From this pic alone, how can you come to the conclusion that the user isn’t black?
---
Just out of curiosity, does the success rate of your skills increase with experience or does it increse with levels?
---
For example: I am leveling woodcutting. Everytime i get 1 log and get xp, do I get better at it right away? Or do I get better only when I level up?
---
Don't feel bad 2 of the 3 borderlands items were wrong
---
Nah, pking is fun and there's no place in the game like the wilderness.  It's definitely not for everyone but I personally enjoy it from both perspectives, I enjoy being the pker hunting for kills and I also enjoy being the skiller/clue scroller dashing around out there hoping to survive.
---
Would like a rework that added variety to skills, like you said fm you have 2 choices. Burn logs or wintertodt. Would like more skilling minigames or interactive ways to skill. All the bank standing skills are the same, withdraw 14 of x item and 14 of y item and combine them.
---
Getting scammed in 2020 is a minor league darwin award.
---
Wouldnt be as funny that way
---
I think older items always have that Gower brothers charm. 
---
Just like I have a theory they made goblin mail give the examine text in order to teach noobs to look at chat.
---
Fake news
---
Crazy how many people disagree. Sandler played his role well but I didn’t really find the character that interesting.. as stressful as the movie was I just kinda thought it was boring.
---
Getting the fire cape (seen in the picture) used to be one of the most challenging things in the game. Not so much now, but the impressive part is level at which two players, Rendi and Xzact, are achieving them. They have been in a “Cold War” with each other. One will upload a video of them getting the fire cape at level 10, the other will upload a level 9 getting it. So on and so forth down to level 4. You START the game at level 3. For them to get the cape at these levels has been thought nearly impossible for years, yet here we are. Also please note this is a friendly competition. Both dudes are just having fun seeing how low they can go.
---
You must mean bad religion. Funnily enough, I do remember my parents took us to church from 4th to 6th grade and kids on RS were always trying to push atheism on me in game.
---
Bruh literally, learned to type, grammar, bargaining etc. The list goes on. I give a lot of credit to rs making me smarter as a kid lmao
---
At 62 woodcutting, in the guild with dragon axe what tree should I be cutting? I've been doing willows because I feel like I chop them way faster.  When should i move on to maple/yews? I dont care about profit, just xp.
---
*prayer flicks “Protect from HR”*
---
You see, the ring of suffering is wieldable at 75 hitpoints, so I just killed all the monsters with relative ease because I didn't have to time my clicks perfectly within a 0.6 second time frame for 100+ hours. I kinda just afked in the middle with prayer on until the jad fight.
---
thanks
---
dont you dare touch my spade
---
Or a Lance. With a Lance I get 4 kills per trip. Could honestly probably do 6-7 but the inventory usually fills up too quickly.
---
Making apple pies there was my favourite thing to do. Back in the day I got angry at my school friend for stealing all the pie dish spawns, called him gay and got reported. Good times
---
But a lot of people do trade, hence scammers.
---
I see how it could be abused, ruin someone's day especially newer players. I also don't think it will effectively help players from being scammed.
---
Scammers should just get banned. Discourages those players from engaging in such behaviour, doesn't try tackle the impossible task of making players aware they could be scammed.
---
Veteran friend of mine got scammed a tbow. Hes usually a smart guy, played for years. I don't think a red overlay would have helped.
---
He just said this 10 minutes ago. “Hi everyone. Saddened that I won’t be able to upload the video as my dog chewed the piece of paper which had my password on for the account and then stepped on my keyboard resulting in deleting the clips for the video. Apologies”
---
In my opinion, the post was a troll.
---
&gt;not nsfw
---
Nnsfw
---
Bad luck
---
Woah.
---
no fucking way, he did it!!!!! Hype!
---
Yeah this is way too old and buried to get anything! Especially gold!
---
Should have just botted it
---
And yet you have no rebuttal.
---
Or just don’t be a dipshit and don’t fall for scamming... 🤗
---
When you have to tickeat for like 30 hours, you kinda get used to not making mistakes lol
---
Stick with the videogames, meth is one hell of a drug.
---
teaks then sulliusceps at 65 are the best xp without tick manipulation, at 90 you can do redwoods which are more afk but not as good xp
---
They're faster than 1+1 lava dragons? Im still at thr point where I use passive elites
---
Option to turn them on/off then
---
You need to change your name twice on the first account for it to become available
---
When it's a 4CB firecape I sure as hell do
---
Edgeville is still a blast to this day. Theres at least 2 pkers there shit talking each other every time I go. It reminds me of the old days.
---
“mage only is generally bots” /= “only mage is all bots”
---
No, they said it's already increased on task so other increases aren't necessary. Dumb reason but it's the one they gave lol
---
All joking aside it's a bigger problem then people think, I took up mountain biking to get me out of the house and off the games and I lost 6 stone and have a much better life for it, I'm no longer camera shy and much more confident. I will add I still play RuneScape almost daily it's all about moderation.

I've been using the same 2 online profile names since my days playing AAA (Alien Adoption Agency) and RaceWarKingdoms, so over 20 years now.

It took you a year to walk from clan wars to ge?!?!
---
Why do you feel as though it's a competition?
---
congratz!! :D I’m trying for it too, but only at 77 so far ^^’
---
Just keep practicing. Not sure what level or gear youre at, but it took me 5 attempts to finally get it on the fifth. It may have been that I upgraded from full ancient (used for prayer bonus) to full void on my last attempt. But the fact remains that I got to Jad every time, and each time I learned something and got better.
---
Mah mutagen is 1/5k. But serp helm is best first drop if going for bp/helm/magic fang because you are immune to venom then
---
What do you mean bro he’s in raids fighting olm lol
---
New year, new day,  new decade... all arbitrary. Quit when you dont enjoy the game anymore. Or when mtx finally comes to osrs. With leagues on the rise, this is the most fun and contemporary rs has ever been while still maintaining that osrs feel. If you wanna use the new decade as an excuse to quit, then my guess is your heart is with moving on.
---
But we'll see you back here for ososrs
---
takes time to hand out those punishments the advantage in this is it show be automatic

Literally playing 2007 Scape..

Everytime someone has started telling me about a pyramid scheme and I call them out they pivot to "I know it's a scan but I can make money if I xyz". Lol
---
yes. and...
---
The scroll shouldn't be a "loot" from CoX. It should be a unlock from somewhere else more accessible to obtain.
---
This is awesome.
---
What clue step is it
---
Been playing off and on since 2006 now. 
---
My first MMO and only really. Could never get into WoW etc even though i enjoyed exploring.

Made some online friends a long time and they all left. Started a new account this year and it still gives me the feels.
---
lmfao

rendi looks like 29 what u mean 18
---
Can you cook other (non-servery) foods on the clay ovens in the Hosidius mess hall? If so, do they get the reduced burn rate as well?
---
That's a BS argument mate. Theoretically nothing stops people from reporting people just to be dicks, but realistically, almost no one does that outside of some actual feuds between clans maybe. It might be an issue for some famous "personas" such as streamers/youtubers, but for 99,99% players it won't. 
---
There's a similar situation in WoW actually - you get muted automatically after a certain amount of reports is sent about you. Overall it's a system that works fine. Some misguided individuals, mostly "influencers" cry how that can be abused, but in reality it almost never is.

This game helped me meet people from all around the world. It’s crazy how without games like these, you would never form those friendships.
---
Yeah I dont want to be a dick head but I feel like little kids were just smarter back then. Or at least they are willing to try things to learn. My 6 year old nephew cant even work a mouse or controller , I've tried to teach him but he just doesnt get it. Same thing for my friends 7 year old boy. They try to play games but they are bad, and not just little kid bad but like can barely do anything at all bad. They both constantly ask how to do the simplest things over and over like walk in minecraft. They are completely unwilling to just push buttons to figure stuff out. They are afraid to make a mistake and want to be told over and over how to do every single thing.  We tell them to just try stuff, to experiment and push buttons to see what happens but they wanna say the games too hard and just stop playing. Back when I was 6 I had NO ONE to teach me anything so I just messed with it until I figured everything out. It was hard but there are literally no down sides to trying and failing. IDK I kinda ranted here. Hopefully this small sample size doesnt represent most kids these days.
---
Making some minor stat changes so that weapons like mace, d scim, etc have similar DPS but with different styles (crush vs slash etc) and then rebalancing some NPC stats to make them less even across the board isn’t nearly as much work as you’re making it out to be. At most it’s like a tedious afternoon of changing around some numbers.
---
F in the chat for all the kings without their crowns.

Cant afford a bp or the scales

Enjoy runescape and have fun man
---
I hate getting pkd, but you're well within your right to do so, we all know how the wildy works and the risks we take. I have one question about your time in revs though, how often are you finding people farming revs skulled up?
---
Congrats bro
---
Uhh I think the account build is what's suspect.
---
Thanks!
---
Looking through is posts it looks like he’s an iron so no he likely doesn’t have dragon darts and a bp without a fire cape.
---
Just stop being shit at Reddit tbh
---
yeah, you could make a plugin that would hide the ge clicks.
---
but you could also just not use the GE. not like this plugin would stop you from cheating in your group ironman mode.
---
Well the comparison with the z spear matters more. Also the hits are limited to 50 so the spec isn't as good as it should be
---
Anyone in the wilderness should be prepared to get pked I like pking and the updates and this is coming from someone who only does pvm its dangerous to go to the wilderness thats what makes it fun tbh
---
Runescape has added a nice balance to my life. I’ve been unemployed for the last few months and coming back to Runescape really helped stave off the depression that came with not having a sustainable income. The small grinds were much better than just sitting around the house waiting on phone calls back from potential employers. Now I’m in a better spot, both mentally and financially, and Runescape is responsible for part of that. It kept me motivated to not just give up.
---
Username checks out.

You were not hacked, you gave your information without any resistance😅
---
Runescape has been an interesting journey. As a kid in 2005, I was hacked because I was a kid and gullible. I played on and off then, but recently got back into it. They were very generous people who helped me along the way and I started pking, something I've always wanted to do. Through pking I've made pking buddies and we'd protect each other from pjs and not eat at 16 to troll each other. Last night I was given 9m randomly at edgeville and it made my month. It's not about the 9m, but the kindness and understandingness of the struggle. This active month experience reverted me back into a child - gullible. I was then baited by a giveaway on youtube and clicked on a link and, was again - hacked. LOOOL. Honestly I'm not tooooo mad about it. Just wow. Surprising I was caught by a scam.

I remember when I sliced off all my hair that weirdest part was feeling the air/wind on my ears again.

Also enjoy being able to dry your hair in like 2 minutes.

Im in an area with no snow, grass, pets or children and I cant get a job.
---
In a development that doesnt allow lawns, no one has pets, and any family with children is an hour away.
---
its just one guy, he literally made a fresh reddit account to spam more kob jokes
---
Not undervalued at all, it’s just that supply is so high because it’s the most common drop (tied with augury I guess) so that means that too many are coming in, and an account only ever needs 1.
---
The comment on the D Plate was separate from the one about locking behind Grandmaster Quests. The RS2 D Plate wasn't done poorly, but like I said it wasn't done as well as in OSRS. Creating a Dragon Platebody from 3 pieces of a Demon is just weird compared to reforging it from a broken lump and a chainbody. Also, the whole Blast Fusion Hammer was strange.
---
Also, you are thinking of the [Dragon Staff](https://runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_staff, not the [Dragon Battlestaff](https://runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_battlestaff). The Dragon Staff was a cosmetic Mystic Fire Staff while the Dragon Battlestaff was a Dragon Tier (Level 60) Magic Weapon locked behind a Grandmaster Quest that needed Level 80s. That quest also unlocked Dragon Warhammer and Dragon Throwing Axes; it was into RS3 and not RS2 but that is when Dragon really went downhill.
---
Another one I didn't mention in the previous post was the Dragon Kiteshield, which was added in RS2. Apart from my gripes with QBD and KK, while a Queen Dragon is a fitting place, I think they kinda missed the point of Dragon Armor. Full Dragon Armor was never going to be good so slapping it on high level bosses is out of place. It is the same issue players had with the Dragon Platebody coming from Raids 1. So by having a boss drop a Level 80 Weapon but also a Dragon Kiteshield 1 in 128, it felt like a waste; if they at least made it very rare like the DFH then maybe it would have worked better. But like I said, RS2 felt like it started throwing Dragon Items onto content for the sake of finishing it with the items themselves being trash while OSRS managed to finish the set while making the remaining items either useful or reasonable valuable, which better lives up the legacy of what dragon was.
---
But we in 2019 😭😭
---
That was his plan all along–December 31st 11:59 pm PST he releases a screenshot with a level 3 firecape.
---
How would he implement this? Are the reports public or something? I find it hard to believe that this feature is possible to implement without access to the Jagex database.
---
No invite :(

well for it to make gold farmers lives easier it would have to be faster to note via mage than it would to actually go bank, which I cant really really think of many scenarios where that would be the case anyways. The only real use i can think of is just not having to alch items on slayer tasks like gargs/hydra etc for the people who like to save everything and build up a slayer tab full of items? but like at the end of the day who cares about that

Look this is headed in the right direction but it doesn't quite make it. What would more sustainable is if they are disciplined for scamming then you can publicly see their history. I know this would not circumvent just making a new accounts but it would be a deterrent and we should at least be doing small things here and there that could shave off scams here and there wins are wins even I'd they aren't giant sweeping ones and sometimes that's how a war is won one battle at a time.
