I have actually and the ones I've seen look normal. I bet you haven't though.
---
---
---
I agree, seems like people want some out of this world shit, like i said, it is what it is, even if it was dog shit we would end up having to deal with it if we decided to play the game,
---

---
 idk why i got so many downvotes tho, but its cool, id rather speak what comes to my head freely, then to restrict my thoughts for an upvote from some sweaty runescape fuck.
---
These aren't bananas from Karamja... Smh.

Perhaps a little vendor gnome we carry in our inventory and can set up anywhere.

Great, now how am I gonna hack your account?

It has nothing to do with the price of the food, lol. It shortens your trip because you have less food, which results in less gp/hr overall. When you compare the gp/hr of modern bosses (2m+) to the food cost per hour (&lt;200k), food is essentially free. 
---
To each their own, but I learned to juggle and not lose ticks back in the day at Bandos, and now it's completely second nature. I can see
---
Nice.
---
Or maybe just report rule breaking as you see it, to be a useful person and help the game that you spend so much time playing. 
---
Not directed at you OP, just people in general
---
The GPU plugin is great, but Fossil Island (in some areas) is an exception. If I'm not zoomed in, my fps drops to 10-15 and it affects all OTHER programs that use the same GPU. It's the only place where that happens.
---
Isn't that only low alch
---
Still just seems like a huge hassle to do it on the reg. I do it sometimes to extend a kraken task so I don't have to go back as much but otherwise I usually cba.
---
This
---
But it asked for an NPC in WEISS!

Aka 72 mining 67 agility or something

Two terrible terrible stats combined
---
&gt;agex saying you can't get banned for using OSB
---
is not approval.
---
&gt;The mods have been caught using RuneLite during the occasional QA streams as well
---
&gt;https://twitter.com/runeliteclient/status/997551276027195392?lang=en
---
is in the context of "jagex is no longer taking legal action to stop us from shutting down"
---
Elite diary makes it high alchs
---
This would be a great april fools from jagex
---
Yeah I always report but it just seems futile after a point , when you see the same exact accounts back the next day or next week :( I feel like a few others would agree. But lots of people just don’t you’re right too for sure
---
It’s profitable about 90gp per bracelet. More xp and better margin than high alching
---
these were designed by a woman tho so it's all good
---
Yeah, I can see that. For a boss like Kraken, each kill is about a minute and drops stay for 3 minutes. I just drop at the start of every kill and pick up at the end. As long as I'm not losing ticks, it doesn't bother me, and the time spent in between kills is dead time anyway.
---
well I agree with him and with you. this design is bad and machete like but OP's design ain't elf-ish.
---
He streams for fun but he left because he got another job offer, not to pursue streaming
---
Did you sign up for some recurrent monthly payment? Did you use something like Twitch prime free month?
---
Lol not even maxed.
---
jk gz
---
It would be an alternative to speccing the def down, but it would do no such thing to devalue it. The DWH would just be an alternative for using different weapons. DWH is mainly for Corp and raids anyways, it does not have its value because of Bandos
---
I'm a super casual player anyway. I don't even care about losing ticks or anything, Sometimes Ill just reddit in between kills since im instanced and know no one will show up lol.
---
and due to the diaries it would be -5% original
---
Only took 4 hours for you to come through. Exactly what I explained in my post, nice
---
Probably no more than a few 100k.
---
They look fine to me.
---
Guys I’m a dude and I have to confess something... I’m actually lesbian because I’m also attracted to females!!!!
---
Unfortunately, it wouldn't be a very effective offer if newcomers were required to complete x to receive y. You claim "new players aren't jumping straight into membership"... well, yeah, they are if they use this offer. That's why it's attractive.
---
As far as the botting, it is worsened by the free trials, but if there isn't an offer like this running, you can see the same shit on F2P. The solution is dealing with the bots, not gimping real players because bots are taking advantage where they see opportunity. Easier said than done, eh?
---
I just joined the wiki suggested clan chat. I think it’s OSRS SOA. I found someone for Shield a few weeks ago and Hero today with no issue.
---
You post in r/slammywhammies , no wonder you can't handle csgo lul
---
Bots can do things like quests too.
---
Are you wearing no boots?
---
haha I feel you on that, thanks man. you can do it too!
---
Surprising to no one, people like gambling. This isn't a solution in any way lol
---
no its definitely not that small. max hits for blowpipe go a very long way.
---
for zulrah for example rune darts over addy is around 2.5 minutes saved per hour at the cost of around 12m an hour -&gt; only worth for tob, arguably solo raids. 
---
whereas with mithril you spend around 52k to save 84 seconds -&gt; 2.2m an hour for this to be efficient. Hydra is definitely more than 2.2- youd really only use mithril for slayer, nmz etc.
---
Oh yeah I know, Im probably gunna buy dragon gloves so I can be a little lazy with quests for a minute. I'm currently at 119 quest points and still need to save 2 more people for rfd. Rocking adant gloves atm.
---
  
---
I literally busted out like 10 quests yesterday for some access to things and finishing up rfd. Probably gunna finally do monkey madness later today and get rune gloves.
---
Its the Armageddon for hcim
---
Yup, that’s exactly what happens. I’ve reported the guy for months and nothing has happened to him. It works exactly like me and you said, he shows a certain gp number and since it identifies the owner from the trade, it pretends to roll that gp amount and insta win. Or the owner manually inputs the value when the trade screen is up.

Awesome, thank you so much :) I'm excited to finally get this milestone done.

I'm at 97 combat and 1600btotal with no Barrows gloves or fire cape yet, I need to step up my game.

Big enough that we always have a good number of people online, but not so big that you don't know any of them very well.

[here's a not tiny as shit picture](https://i.imgur.com/hoFvCc0.png)

I mean yeah if your not a pker and have no plans to be one herb boxes are for sure the way to go. But off track kinda imbues shouldn’t even be at nightmare zone, nightmare zone is cheesy private server shit, and the fact so many best in slot shit comes from there just makes literally no sense at all.

Are you ok?

Honestly no 3rd party client is technically safe to use. You always run the risk of ur account being hijacked or being banned for a recent client update that registers as bitting software due to jagex only looking at the clients post update and not before hand

Thanks man give me an hour

"Equivalent Exchange"

Nope, jossik can give you as many free copies of each book that you want. Complete with full pages, so you can get an inventory of each at a time and bank them.

If you want one in a hurry, perdu charges a small fee to get one back.

Anyways, there's plenty of proof that they pay, just google it. Here's the first youtube vid i saw https://youtu.be/IoLgEgP-FvE

I had to contain my excitement

100%. Ive pked insane amounts of money, nothing would get me on the level of hype as dropping a high total level HCIM
---
Why ANOTHER 75 attack weapon?
---
Yes but most people dont want to wait 2-3 days for a 15$ stand. They also want a stand that was designed to look nice with the monitor. So when the 6 people who can afford the fucking monitor walk in, you can bet your ass they will walk out with the $1k stand rather than go home and let it lie on a shelf for a few days or go to another store right after buying their product. It’s shitty design by Apple but its preying on the dumbasses who would unironically buy a $5k monitor from Apple.
---
&gt;Running constant polls is their way of interacting with the criticisms which is a fair thing to do
---
No, no it's not. DMM finals have been an absolute failure. Prizes haven't been given out years after they've been won. You have to get a massively upvoted reddit thread or contact endless jmods on TWITTER fucking twitter jesus christ, before you'll get a response.
---
Jagex is actually a bad company, the gower brothers have made a great game and the programmers have done good but the direction and management is dogshit. Ex-Jagex employees say this constantly when they leave the company.

Jagex has to change their poor ways, but they wont.

How’s your xp/hr doing Arceuus Library? Do you have a good guide you used?
---
For one kill? Wildy diary is what’s impressive here
---
I didn't have to restart my client, I just picked a different world and it worked :\
---
Yo that's some damn fine art
---
Your username is incredibly based.
---
A game thats based completely on RNG, is gonna attract the most gamblers!
---
Your combat level is 96, ranged-based. For level 97, you need one of:
---
    4 Hitpoints or Defence levels,
---
    7 Prayer levels,
---
    13 Attack or Strength levels,
---
    11 Magic levels,
---
    2 Ranged levels.
---
Don’t forgot grotesque guardians!
---
The banking method with imps in a box was nerfed you can still do it normally without banking. I did it a bit while grinding out 77 it was about 30k xp an hour with full graceful and staminas for me in the high 60’s level. Your xp per hour goes up the higher level you are as the amount of xp the books give you is based off your level. Ultimately it seems to usually be about 2-3k xp per hour behind ZMI with medium+large essence pouch and I assume it falls even further behind once you get the giant pouch but all in all it’s not a bad way to vary up your RC training while trying to hit 77.
---
Ye wut LUL
---
Whats your exp rates like?
---
Honestly the XP is not very great, 30k/hr if focused, reality around 22.5k/hr. When I was doing lava runes bfore I was getting 40k/hr but the library is much more chill/afk so I prefer it. The runelite plugin is a must-have and I don't really follow a guide, just take all the books you see and turn in until you get a request you dont have in inventory and get the book, every now and then I'll ask biblia for a manuscript location if as long as it isn't out of my way to do so. I also bring home tp runes for run regen at pool then I use fairy ring back to library, only alternatives would be stam pots or a lot of walking. Someone else mentioned woox's guide but it is outdated as it required banking the books which you can no longer do.
---
Ring of life.
---
I like the idea of a curved sword but not so curved as the current design
---
How did u get this ?
---
Not embarrassing, you're an addy daddy 😍
---
To add to the others - just start chopping wood and breath. It can be a tad overwhelming at first. While you're chopping, click around your interface and read everything. Right click on everything, interface stuff, characters, doors, etc.. 
---
Know that the reason there are so many places is because there is a lot to do and no central "path" for players to take. You kind of just do what you choose to, and there are quests/skills/items to progress you more in the game. 
---
I highly recommend you also get a small goal in mind - get your combat stats up to 10+ and find a way to get steel armor/weapons.
---
Woox's method of catching imps no longer works as you can't bank more than one copy of any book as of 2 updates ago.
---
It warms my heart to see the slaying community coming together to help each other, but he really out to be safespotting the velds that are next to the fire giants.
---
Looks much better imo. I really hope they're gonna change or at least polish their design, because it looks like garbage now. It's basically a machete.
---
So how would you go about doing it as im gonna grind arceus favor soon? Do you collect most books in your invent then go ask the librarian guy for more favor ? Or just ask him and go search for it
---
It "barely even utilising" the GPU is exactly the problem. In today's world, PC's (especially budget ones) aren't designed for single-core performance.
---
Its about 30-45k exp per hour depending on your level, I wouldn't do this method until 50 RC. Basically all you do is (using the runelite plugin) collect any book you happen to run by while turning in requested books. You always want to be picking up books you pass so you can have the best chance at instantly turning in a requested book. It's not complicated, and its about as click intensive as regular RC just without having to do bank management. It does feel good to get those consecutive exp drops, and is a nice break from Ourania.
---
lmfao is this real? Could be...

Its pretty much the only way for him to get cb lvs at this point. Hes only able to get 3 more cb lvs from range and 1 from mage if that.

Lol. 100kea. You wish. More like 8kea.
---
Thanks for the reply. It's a relief to know that it's just a login server issue, and that nothing nefarious is going on.
---
As for the GPU, if Runelite won't cause gfx card issues, then I'll have to look into how well my card is holding up physically. I didn't mention this in the first post, but I've been having issues recently with my graphics card. 
---
Yesterday, I had an issue with my System Event Notification Service bugging out, and I fixed it by updating my graphics drivers. Also, I've been rarely getting this weird display glitch where there would be slight fuzzyness as well as light-red lines all across my display, intersecting to make small,faint, and blurry boxes. This only happened when running Runelite with the gpu plugin enabled, so that's why I thought it had something to do with the problem.
---
I know this isn't really the place to ask for help for that kind of issue, but I felt that I should explain the reason why I asked my question in the first place.
---
Who grabbed a screen shot?
---
That's an Ely on the ground not a elemental shield.

Or falador lol

Now I’m crying
---
They might be okay-ish if they don't require a dozen staminas and a dozen prayer pots like MEP2
---
I mean it's usually to make extra money, if not to fulfill different roles like PKing or ironman.
---
A lot of people do it for extra GP to fund bonds or items on the main.
---
If your account isn’t ready for it then don’t hesitate to drop.
---
For me, If it’s only one quest I need to solve it then I generally do the quest, but if you’re far behind then it’s probably easier to drop it and grab a new one.
---
It's pretty easy to brute force if you're max combat.
---
One of my friends who only pked before got a handful of kills without realizing theres a pattern and a jad phase (he had tbow tho but still).
---
We don’t deserve ash in old school rs he is too pure

I disagree with this post for two reasons.  Lorewise the other sibling has no intrest in ruling the kingdom.  The male sibling only wanted to be a bard and the female thiught she mught but her father disapproved because she was an archer.  Either way your claim to the kingdom is secure unless you propose expanding to other islands.  
---
Secondly I am concerned with the effect of putting so mucg effort into this small area would have on the game.  Everyone would be there late game if it needed so much attention and focus pulling people away from other areas.
---
Just do something else
---
Or make a UIM

Getting chaotic long-sword vibes from this.

Meanwhile Randy/Rian Johnson/Etc: Don't like it you little manbaby? Go somewhere else! This fandom is NOT for you! BLOCKED!

If only more Developers/Directors/Leaders in general were like Mod Ash tbh
---
Smithing is already used to make godswords, and crafting is already used to make bis jewellery. Smithing and crafting already have a persistent use where smtihing makes ammo (and cash through alching) and crafting makes consumable jewellery, while warding's persistent use seems to be to sink items, there isn't much of a reason to do that without some benefit at the end.
---
Also, BiS mage gear wouldn't have to be directly made from warding, it could be in the form of temporary dyes or enchantments that improve existing robes to make them even better, with a usage cost.

Runelite screenshots all your level ups, that might help
---
Let me know what to skill next if thats what i should be trying to do
---
Sounds about as worthy of an integrity change as anything they've done in the past TBH but yeah some people would be outraged if this ultimate EZscape feature were taken away
---
I’m mostly looking forward to the blade of saeldor being bis for tob rather than whip, 4 tick should stay
---
Ardy knights to 99 thieving but if I were you I’d just rush slayer
---
Have it give equal experience to runecraft when you burn a log.
---
Depending on the boss def levels, this could still be better DPS, I haven’t done ToB though so I don’t know whether the 4 tick attack speed is important in certain rooms or what.

---
Well, I have a bad luck and a bad connection, so no thank you
---
This game oddly attracts the worst people ever. Nazis, racists, misogynists, incels, alt-right, extremely toxic and hateful people, scammers, etc. I don’t know why the game attracts such a diverse cesspool of people. It’s unlike any other game in that regard, every game has the group of people I listed above, but this game is by far the worst. However on the flip you have some of the nicest and friendliest people you’ll get to meet. I made a lot of great friendships through the game, it’s extremely weird lol. I don’t know why it does though.
---
Hcim do zulrah bc they get one free death a day. The problem is you need to kill zulrah once to get it
---
Shut up forever
---
Are you okay, bro? Do you wanna talk about it?
---
What slayer lv should i go for?
---
The "ring of life" effect most hcim use is the perk of the defence skillcape. The diary reward is a free resurrection once per day, and it also pauses the instance(meaning you don't get attacked) until you try to act, making it almost impossible to die if you get disconnected.
---
i'll have to try that out! im 74 ranged and ive been using void ranged/mage for the easy swap but i'll give your method a go next time.
---
I may or may not be completely bias as I’m getting 99 str at NMZ while I type this, but I completely understand you’re point. It’s some of the best (the best?) afk Melle exp in the game, so the imbues on top of that really kinda compound how broken OP for a mini game it is.
---
Honestly the scrolls of redirection and herb boxes themselves could be a good enough incentive to use NMZ outside of just getting zip without the imbues on top of that.
---
https://imgur.com/a/SEE8UvZ  Here ya go man!
---
jagex actually did this to fight the max gear hopping worlds to crash nechs/dusts
---
That makes sense. I don’t PK nor do I really ever plan on it, but if I were going to I could see the advantages of having another layer of confirmation on top of visual, especially when split second decisions count
---
Matter of fact my pure is in NMZ as we speak while I’m watching this game, never said I didn’t use it, and I don’t mind it as a training method, but I’m just not a fan of the best in slot items being rewards from there
---
So you're saying it has less appeal than the bludgeon and serpentine helm? I'd say even a 1 pixel width sword would look better than those convoluted items.
---
Why so aggressively negative about an item and gold sink that will save the economy in the long term
---
Yo when did Steve get so juicy?
---
Yeah that’s how I’ve been doing it personally, and I only use pray pot sips if I get dharok in the tunnel and can’t safe spot, or sometimes if I get karil in the tunnel and he’s wrecking me, but I’m also 70 prayer. But usually I can tank ahrim quite well in black dhide/Karils, and then use barrows armor to tank the remaining melee bros.
---
That’s fair I can see the argument against it 8 never quite thought about it too much, and honestly I’m not particularly bothered by it one way or another
---
Verziks range attacks are aoe are on a 4 tick rotation and is weak to slash, it would be a direct upgrade from whip which is what most non scythe use
---
Gotcha, makes sense. Is the tent whip not sufficient though? This would be just barely better, like +4 and +3 accuracy and strength?
---
I mean its a swamp I'm sure everything is slightly damp.  You could also pretend the ghosts in the area like messing with people by knocking them off the agility course.
---
Most people who play this game I would imagine fall into the age range of about mid to late 20's which makes them for the most part Millennials. As a demographic this generation don't seem to have a problem with people being different since the Millennials were and are still pushing for acceptance of others (and apparently killing every industry on the planet) although there would of course be acceptions to this. 
---
I can't read minds here but if I had to guess people are just sick of hearing about gay people and how you need to accept them because they already do. Kinda like that feeling of annoyance you get when somebody tells you the exact thing over and over again or when somebody tells you they're vegan. From that initial annoyance it escalated until a full blown flame war insued.

---
Osb is shady af and always has been, look up the history of osb
---
This is propaganda for Jamflex to implement new player updates
---
I think it's a vocal minority. I might be make some generalizations but few games are like Runescape in that people have such a sunk cost mentality about it (myself included in the past). So when you have a large percentage of the game being veterans who have played for years the are more likely to voice their opinion and this being reddit and the osrs subreddit you're going to get a lot arguing.
---
I also believe than if you look for toxic players you'll find them. Every game has a toxic part of its player base. Even games like warframe have some toxic people which is akin to being toxic in like tetris or pacman. 
---
Also don't read controversial comments ;p
---
Honestly that just sounds like your GPU is bricking it.

This is not true, you are mis-informed. Jagex put out a very clear statement that any form oh ahk usage is now bannable

---
This brings my nostalgia to a different level. Very well done
---
Saradomin and Armadyl godwars unless you farmed ecumenical keys, which would become necessary if this is how it worked. 
---
However, people would still ddos worlds to grief particular players and there would be a lot of people caught in the crossfire.

It’s just the nature of the more toxic side to this community.

Yes they are. I know someone who made one, it's designed to let you win with small bets, but always lose on big bets. The ones who win on big bets, are the actual owners of the bot. They'll deny it, but it's the sad truth.

its okay to be anti white here on this sub, the mods even said so.

How does one join?

yep, make sure you're playing on your proper coastal servers

The lore bit was really just a halfassed throw for a reason to allow upgrades or more to do with miscellania. I don't really care how its done, i just want some more kingdom management and gold sink.

it's so funny to me that people dont know the bot owners are the only ones who win large amounts hahahah alts etc hahaha
---
&gt; I think it would be the perfect middle ground if others still couldn't see your items but you got five minutes of logged in time to get your shit back. No incentive to ddos others, item protection from shitty servers,

No, ppl would literally ddos worlds to make you lose your shit.

Of course it isn’t relevant to the mind that is not capable of comprehending basic stuff like forming a sentence in a foreign language might sometimes be grammatically incorrect. I don’t blame you, don’t worry.
---
I have been, it doesn’t really seem to matter what world I’m on though. I went through the whole list of worlds and tried to play on the one that I had the lowest ping on and I still have the same problems, albeit lesser.
---
Uniform looks....really good!

Alright let's get started!

I failed 4 or 5 times. You'll relax and be patient watching his animations soon enough.
---
Aye, nice dude. Better get a menagerie for it :)
---
Nice
---
fyi if you decide to boost it, do the clue in the circle of gold rocks north of karamja for an elite task too
---
Thanks homie :) Rushing right in again after my first attempt was probably a poor decision, I’ll most likely try again tomorrow and log out before Jad to cool off.
---
Have you been having the world hop lag at all?
---
Slayer! I usually do slayer until I get two or three clue scrolls, and take a short break to do the clue scrolls. Or you can buy bonds. Whatever floats your boat
---
If you’re bursting on task you should use slaughter bracelets to extend the task over tormented bracelet. If off task then tormented bracelet is the way to go.
---
Who needs a q p

                            when you have kraken.
---
I dropped the 77 RC master clue requirement years ago and it was sad lol. Haven’t dropped one since cause I have no life and maxed
---
Oh, thanks for the heads up! I didn't even know that was a task.
---
Do slayer and it won’t take long. You can cannon most tasks and there really aren’t many tasks you can’t range. Even tasks that are more suited for melee; like Gargoyles, I have ranged: the blowpipe is just so good and at around 80, slayer you start to profit well.
---
So, who took over Mat’s JMod spot?
---
Think this is bad? Try dmm
---
Nice, have you gotten your angler gloves yet?
---
Next to your friend list theres a button with 2 faces. Click on it and then click on "join clan" and type in "theoslounge".
---
Thanks g. The waves up to Jad are so easy but a huge time sink, I’ll log out next time at Jad and relax. I think the build up is what’s killing me.
---
I blew 10M on herblore levels for a 400k casket, AMA.

Could be ironmen? They’re more lucrative bots then 56 gp an inventory every trip
---
Nobody spams their clan when you  pile 1 guy lmao. Nobody is complaining about pking. Read my comment again more slowly.  obviously  you are a rot member so you will only reply “but itzzz da wildaness!!!”.
---
Use the runelite client. There is a plugin were you can change it to wasd from arrow keys.
---
Did you even check the wiki? It's a relatively common drop
---
Pretty hard to kill a level 80 as a level 3
---
Sounds like what i had, the msaa i think it is on runelite bugs with rx amd cards did it on my pc with an rx 460 but not on any of my nvidia pcs, simply turning it off fixed it for me.
---
&gt; love
---
Never seen anyone bother with it outside kbd

Didnt know you were level 3 :)

99 WC was the first 99 I got on my ironman skiller too.

Without hesitation he gave it to me and didn’t ask for anything in return.

We do not deserve him.

In March they were in the 200s... It's rough, man

Could you do a design for the existing blade with your hilt design?
---
Thanks man helps out a lot :)
---
I was just poking fun at the awkward grammar
---
Dont remind me of that mini-game... 
---
Got Torso - OUT
---
What was your criticism, OP?
---
I wouldn't recommend it.
---
The angler outfit saves maybe 200-300k of xp grind out of 99 grind
---
Unless you are going for 200m the angler outfit is pointless
---
9 hours of monkfish is 310k xp
---
6-7 hrs of shilo village is 300k
---
3 hrs of tick fishing is 300k xp
---
The people you saw running were mainly bots because it was botted to hell.  Regular ess was not 100 each lol, nowhere close
---
God so many days on rs are flying through my head right now. This isn’t only such a nostalgic piece but a beautiful one at that. I can’t help but remember so many days where Varrock was the epicenter of luring, trading, chilling, plank making, rune essence running, pking, smithing at v west.... damn. Those days are far behind us but it still feels like yesterday sometimes because of pics like these.
---
Make a trade limit and GE requirment for everyone until all f2p quest are completed, would help out with the economy out from bots
---
This is what ruined the game back in the day for all of us. We were so focused on fighting the bot and RWT problem we cut free trade and killed the wilderness. Are we really trying to go down that same path again?

Cheesewiz627, I was not a creative child

---
I like the idea of prestige but I feel like this is encouraging an unhealthy  amount of play-time
---
CoD prestiges took maybe like a week or 2 of solid daily play iirc, but maxing on osrs requires hundreds of hours...
---
Again, I like the idea but Jagex might think this is pushing players to spend too much time in the game. Not that Jagex shouldn't care or be your "mom" but they've said they wouldn't want to encourage unhealthy playing habits; which is why LynxTitan^*(probably)* won't get any in-game commemoration for 200m/xp in all skills.
---
Lol I know hes a real streamer but I'm just shocked he would ever be that petty... but actually after having sat through like 2 hours of his steams nah, thats him... YAHOOOOOOOOO
---
I was trying to make sense of this picture (not a huge Twitch user so didn't understand the "Stream Bar" reference) and when I saw it... Holy shit.
---
But then how will they complain about jagex?
---
Behead yourself
---
Nice RNG, I'm only 82 farming.
---
Simple fact of life is most people don't pay attention to detail enough to formulate constructive responses and debate reasonably back and forth. It's sad and to stop the cycle sometimes you gotta just sit back and think about the issue before you talk. Yelling an incoherent and nonconstructive rant does little if anything at all.
---
This looks awesome.
---
Another bonus for the bottomless compost bucket that I didn't know about until I got it, every bucket of compost you add to it counts as two uses worth you get out of it. If you add a hundred ultracomposts you get two hundred uses out of the bucket until you have to add more, effectively halving the price of compost that you buy for your crops. Eventually that bucket ends up paying for itself, depending on how much you use it.
---
Why more detail?

Too many swords? are you kidding me? Level 70+ consists of Whips Bludgeons 2h Swords Rapiers Spears Scythes Hastas Flails Hammers Mauls and Axes. Unless you want to count the extremely situational Arclight we don't have a single longsword.
---
Not very true actually. I have helped over five people who have started and them asking ‘what should I do next’ was more a way of asking how to progress efficiently so they don’t waste time.

Idk man, looking at master tasks I’d say 88 smithing, 85 slayer, 85 mining, 87 fishing, and 90 woodcutting are all tougher requirements than 77 rc

I use ahrims top and bottoms, smoke bstaff, malediction ward, farseer helm, god cape, mystic boots, chaos gauntlets, seers ring. If i had the money id prob swap out farseer for anc hat and boots for eternal boots. I have used mystic for no repair costs but ahrims allows me to afk more as they hit a lot less. Bosses i use Roald, Count, Me, Warlord, Tree spirit.
---
Not in this game tho. It was need for speed most wanted. Trying to finish all challenges. I must add it was a bad life period where i was addicted to amfetamine
---
Just say no to e girls!
---
Their design looks like elf swords out of lord of the rings. I like jagcunts design
---
It also doesn't require pure essence, but that only matters for btw's.
---
Failing the caves "fails" the task (doesn't affect your streaks, but you do have to go get a new task)
---
This is excellent. I shall try it later on then. Miss having a members account on osrs and I've done pretty much all I can on f2p

Dewit

Top 5 imo are kree&gt;kq&gt;Corp&gt;zuk&gt;kril
---
Your toxic.
---
Wow okay I'll buy one today, was thinking it wasn't so useful without something like that
---
The main reason for this is because all of the best money making methods in f2p don't have an requirements and are very easy to bot. And the players like me who actually try to play the game legitimately don't actually benefit from quests and skilling because there aren't any better money making methods in f2p for players with high levels.

Yes

Get a fire cape.

If you look at the top donator, then the most recent donator that's half the story.

Harassment towards Emily was quickly punished but it was mainly because they were harassing and people could see it ^(actually MMK deserves to stay in Falador because he's such a white Knight)

Same here... I don't play anymore but I used to love this game so much. I don't know why even osrs isn't the same anymore. sometimes i wonder if i'm depressed and that's why I no longer enjoy gaming..
---
thanks for the nostalgia op :)
---
He did nothing wrong.

Well, I'll be making them? I do have some more OSRS art on my twitter and instagram (@dagnadraws) in the meantime :)

Just do it off task if you still haven’t got your first fcape.

Holy shit have you always been able to use compost on tiny herb spot after planting?   I'm millions of exp past 99 and didnt know this.

Yea man I pooped my pants

Not very nice to spoil quest storylines bro...
---
Providing some type of benefit/effect/difference for burning different tier logs would be great. It doesn't need to be like a combat buff or something like proposed in warding, but hp, stat or run energy restoration while resting is a common suggestion.
---
Crosstraining methods would be nice to make it a less isolated skill. 
---
Flametreating some construction material for new furniture or a mingame would be cool.
---
Maybe a beacon agility course/arson playground that has the player lighting fires and maneuvering through a course.
---
Maybe make smoking traps relevant or use fm in a clever way for hunter. Making fire could be a bait or mechanic for an elemental creature.
---
A farming minigame could incorporate other skills, including firemaking. Something like slash and burn as part of a task of the minigame.
---
Whats that like 90+ runecrafting? :D
---
Been there, died twice
---
🦀mods wont work in fast food🦀
---
They're two completely different games whose playerbases don't seem to overlap very much in my experience. It's like asking if EVE Online will die when the next diablo comes out.
---
I'm unsure if it's their reasoning but the crystals falling hit in a 3x3 area so standing against a wall means you have 1 side less crystals can hit you from

Please stop pushing the game back down the route of 'the player experience is less important than getting rid of bots' like RS3 did with the removal of free trade &amp; the wilderness

If you watch the video you see the screenshot showing his name on the runescape website
---
Died once cause i didnt bring pray pot the first time i went training pray from 23, and lost 80k, now people cant even take half of my food before i hit 30. Could make them even saltier by bringing my alt every time and tagging them in one way combat while walking away. The only ones carrying huge amounts of bones will be maxed def tank gear mains. I understand theres fun in pking but at chaos altar its a waste of time lol. I bring 50 dbones and half inv of food. Always survive to 30 even on non stop barrages.

Nope you are wrong.

Funny how you think anyone you politically agree with are the "worst people", maybe you should just leave politics out of it and you'll enjoy yourself more

Even better idea: Phones in RuneScape so we can play mobile on our computer

Glad to see teleblock introduced this week f2p.
---
Damn, was expecting more updates PvPwise, guess they're not ready yet :)
---
I don't give a shit, I give a nice. Nice!
---
Just kill 350 chompys
---
Those stats are quite normal.  Played with a quite casual/efficent-esque attitude in the past months and easily reached similar stats.
---
Just go MLM anyway, it'll be more afk.

Is Imp box death content now or does it have any uses left?

I love this guy so much.

Yeah I just calculated it, I get 50m more in mlm

lmfao stop being so offended you weeb. Of course it LOOKS similar. However the reference of the OP is to the "Me and the boys" meme, which is not related AT ALL to One Piece.

Calm yourself, lmfao.

Ye, that sounds interesting and fitting

Valubles

Happy national day.
---
Requiring inferno cape**. Remove melee capes that arent bis to access the ge, its time.
---
It's by far the best change imo
---
You literally couldn't damage anyone in f2p pvp if they spam teleport since all damage is nullified on teleportation.
---
It's beyond me why it got polled in the first place X_x
---
Even after failing a poll 3 times, fuck it lets just add it anyway!
---
I understand why you don't want people to use Imp Boxes in PvP worlds, but in the wilderness they make sense to be allowed. 
---
You're unable to use them over level 30 wilderness or if you're teleblocked. Any situation where you could have used an imp box in the wilderness you could have just teleported to safety. Because of this they weren't really used to bank valuables before a player was pk'd.
---
If someone has some more perspective on this I'm missing let me know.
---
Yes, why not lol
---
They have so many other great songs (and an entire genre of music) I never would've heard of had RS not introduced me to that band.
---
F2p teleblock so you can pk in the ENTIRE wild, problem solved.
---
They could cancel the tb if you leave the loaded map square I guess
---
New gear/new spec weapons? How is that going to help exactly? You can't really add anything that is more powerful than existing items. So you would just get something like Dclaws v2, or AGS v2.
---
black dragon hide
---
Not really digging the diaper or fake bcp look. Colors are nice but I think helm could be less bland.
---
I'm not arguing that F2P teleblock is a bad idea, I'm just offering a solution for people who were getting butthurt about teletubbies.
---
Nope, WoW killed itself.
---
Wow, commenting on an old thread for that comment. Sad bastard....
---
Lok Tar!
---
I dont see how turning gmaul into a +1 would make PvP better. 
---
Force low lvl pures to get levels (which means more time required to create an entry level acc build), means that people who dont want to die in veng fights are much less likely to die and every rusher/nher in pvp will still use a gmaul because they dont care about that extra risk.
---
As you can see ive spent my time on mining,lumber,fishing and agility. Ive not made any Gold except a few hundred thousands.
---
What would you guys spend time leveling? I prefer skills i dont have to pay so much attention on. And maybe viable on phone.
---
Thanks in advance
---
Only re-releasing existing content feels like it wont keep the game alive in the same way new content in OSRS has.
---
[deleted]
---
yes i followed exact that guide. Just overwhelming for me
---
You mean get rid of the duel arena.. I can name AT LEAST 4 staking streamers who 100% RWT but it doesn't matter because Jagex won't do anything
---
But nobody is gonna do that. If you get a wildy step after a step that skulls you (and there are several, like a master emote step at the death altar), you'll be forced to wait 10 minutes.
---
Haha I thought of this outfit when I first saw this meme.
---
Bro you know the saying, scuffed equals stuff. Keep it up you'll get ur drops
---
Just got mine today too! And then my account got hacked a few hours later..
---
What in gielnor is a fite kiln
---
Yep, everything RS related shut down \~6 minutes before the update. I still can't access the website or any clients, from London UK.
---
Milky Way Record*
---
&gt; not that hard I think?
---
famous last words
---
those Nats aren't gonna craft themselves
---
When you say this
---
 &gt;Jagex put out a very clear statement that any form oh ahk usage is now bannable
---
it is just straight not true. Maybe you should read the link you've posted 3 times.
---
Fire cape?
---
You could try mining at the motherlode mine, or carry on fishing, you'll start to make some money once you get to better fish.
---
ill smash some arama with ya, im: empty\_goonbag   oce server btw
---
Said every def ever :P
---
Im not sure, but thats why im not the content creator, and for me just nerf the maul and im fine with pvp, its just stupid that you can just RNG spec anyone from like 110hp no matter what gear.
---
No worried about the lost gear, just pixels.
---
Meh, he was always a stuck up prick anyways. Happy he got what he deserved
---
It has a rx580.
---
was this what came of the streamers going to jagex for ideas on pvp? because this is ridiculous when pvm and ironmen are getting catered for in more or less every update. a few more of these and pvp will be who can pvm the fastest...
---
with the exceptions that katanas are pretty shitty at cutting cause of their thickness

Dude where is my guam?

What is the point of removing being able to lose your skull at clan wars?

Try doing some quests! Reallly helps jumpstart your account!

Ezscape
---
F2P Teleblock fucking finally, been wanting this for 5-6 years now
---
DJ Qunt to you
---
Obscure, nicely done lol
---
Why was the change made to all max cape variants? The regular max cape I understand, but the other variants offer no additional bonuses.
---
Can you get on yet? The websites and all clients are still down for me, I disconnected 6minutes before update.
---
Just don't like cunts
---
These bots are super easy to setup, free scripts and don't require members.
---
They don't make much per bot, but you can run like a thousand bots with no issues, compared to like hunter bots who would get banned and lose their membership constantly.
---
For example the AGS + Gmaul combo. Currently you can run it easily with AGS as your +1. But let's say the gmaul is now 5m, you would have to decide if you want to actually risk 5m or not.
---
abby dagger
---
&gt;You still risk the chins you're catching
---
you can literally just quickly walk half a screen south every few minutes and you never end up risking more than 100k in chins.
---
Maybe bots at blue dragons or Smth similar
---
Yeah only requirement is getting a bow that you shouldn't ever try to get without getting blowpipe first
---
These updates are what passed the poll
---
Shouldn't the crystal enemies be translucent?
---
Fuck me for critisising Jagex I guess, the part that bothers people is Jagex implementing this without thinking about it.
---
The problem they created is not the problem.
---
Can the PK skull update be updated to only affect bounty hunter/PvP worlds? It’s going to be really annoying and time consuming now to do clue scrolls where you have to go to the abyss, then immediately get a wildy step afterwards. This just hurts casual players who don’t even engage in PvP.
---
Why the /s?
---
What a shit comment
---
We do raids discord will sort you out, although I do suggest learning them cos they are a fun piece of content
---
Damn thats a good idea
---
Fuck up dickhead
---
Death, death will always work. 
---
Hello Corp, I’ll take one swift death please!
---
Good thing its 2 uses per imp box
---
HCIMs do Zulrah on max account?
---
Yes 1 f cape per attempt
---
Yeah 2200 world is only useful for non boss diary tasks, which quite a lot of them are
---
80, but i got the squirrel at 78 haha
---
You still only make &lt;150k per hour with magic logs...
---
Haha holy moly. Those would have to take so much time.
---
What's the summer promotion?
---
pharaoh sceptre
---
All still down for me since the update, Scotland, UK.
---
Just my opinion
---
Theres always one
---
Direct teleports to any location from all spellbooks. I use the teleport .. nexus? To go straight to kourend, ardy, catherby, and use jewelry box to go to draynor. Definitely use POH for farm runs.
---
does it ever work?
---
Just something I care about man and felt the title was kinda shitty that’s all.
---
Wow, what a convincing counter-argument! You *almost* changed my mind!
---
I'll send you a d pic for free
---
im happy you have an opinion that you are free to voice.
---
Once you enter you shouldnt be able to leave, afterall how is it a risk if you can just hop one trenchy boi to safety
---
Its abused on regular worlds as well.
---
I will eventually but I got other goals atm, thank you man!
---
If you lose the regular capes in deep wild you don't pay 50/100k you need to get a new one. This update does actually make sense.
---
I feel like you are missing the point of my original statement. 
---
I like the elven fantasy aesthetic of the original. 
---
And the statement about medieval type swords covers all levels.
---
Basically fight caves 2, akin to the Inferno now, it came out in 2012 pre-eoc for the tokhaar-kal (basically the original infernal cape). You had to kill like 7 jads and a double jad wave and the boss was a complete pushover. But it was a nice challenge in the start, got figured out pretty quickly though.
---
Smelt the bars. Much better profit if that’s the route you want to take.

---

---
not trying to be a pain but when is the gmaul going to under go changes/have the changes discussed?
---
My bday is 6/6/96 I think this happening on my bday is cooler than D-Day
---
Even the younglings?
---
Think they said it's coming out after the weekend
---
Google the falador massacre
---
because there's no good reason for it to be a part of f2p, it doesn't add anything to f2p pk.  Why stop at teleblock? Why not let them use ancients while you're at it...
---
It’s basically an update for PvP and BH worlds where people would fight the same person over and over again without getting a skull since they already attacked that person recently.
---
It is absurdly easy to get stacked out with PvM from full health. If HCIM could out-eat that damage they would, if they can't, they tele or die. Stopping teleporting from mitigating that damage is just shortsighted.
---
If you zoom in, both islands are on this map and just have a lot more (much needed) space between them.
---
They're called gen z, or centennials. But I get what you mean, millennials sounds like it should be for people born in the new millenia, and it is the go-to term to describe the younger generation
---
damn it's crazy how the 200m skill at a time guy has only 3 skills done and double the total xp LMFAO
---
The feels
---
It's just a one-time payment.  Having to do Fight Caves again every time you fail the Inferno would be fucking terrible lol
---

&gt;Solution: don't wait until the last possible second to teleport from a dangerous situation on an HCIM.
---
This would all but completely cut off hardcores from Corp and theatre of blood.
---
Right - better go around being an asshole to everyone and making them feel like shit just to make sure they have 'thick skin', yeah?
---
Good to know, there is an arceuus spell that ressurect dead crops.
---
Oh well you’re just wrong to do that.
---
Cooler*
---
Yea eoc made a lot of previous content far easier, when it was released the jads were basically stronger versions of osrs jad but with the combat triangle restriction
---
Add the Bounty Hunter crater just like back in the day. It will lower the amount of looting bots dramatically.
---
Iron and coal, steel bars are very profitable. Especially if doing blast furnace. You will have to complete a quest though.
---
Cursed You was the first player to achieve 99 con, so he hosted a massive house party that crashed the world and caused everyone to get kicked from the poh. All the players that were inside Cursed You’s combat ring at the time, one of those players being Durial 321, were still able to fight other players after getting kicked (this was the major bug).
---
That's absolutely how it works, it's an open source project so people could submit fake requests. Ask them yourself, they've stated that this is the reason many times.
---
Magic secateurs are wieldable secateurs from fairy tale part 1 quest

Thanks!

Not max yet smh

I’m gonna make another video talking about this video and how this guy is claiming to be durial when really I’m the real durial. 
---
You have to believe me cause I made the video.
---
it does allow f2p pkers to not tele away.
---
teleblock used to be f2p btw.
---
nice
---
Yeah just surprised to see people using it since it only gives 18 mage def
---
More like 6 hours at the current state of scripters in osrs
---
would be cool if we could get #FaladorMassacre trending on twitter or something lol
---
Thanks for this source :)
---
I agree that there's overall a lot of swords, but how often will you see people use one? Do any of them actually count? That's what I meant by my retort. In f2p the scimitar is simply better so that discards every metal longsword and in p2p what options do you have? That's what I meant by lack of swords; there aren't any swords that almost anyone would consider remotely viable so you won't see longswords unless the user in question simply doesn't know what they're doing. 
---
They can't seem to create a viable high level melee weapon without feeling the need to add some odd twist to it and the original looks just like that to me. This could have been the solution, but instead it's just another weird looking machete / scimitar just to put a spin on what people perceive to be an oversaturation while in fact the highest tiers of weapons consist of everything except longswords. That's what I meant by my response.
---
Funny how it happend on 666. LULW
---
Damn I remember this in some form of way, either hearing about it while playing or the YouTube video that I’ve seen so much. I wonder if it could ever happen again
---
Forinthry bracelet
---
Nope... In the patch notes it says that it was changed to a "Key Mapping plugin"
---
Wilderness ditch should be removed too

There was a 10 year event, which was pretty much a unrestricted world were u can fight in fally and sometimes a durial npc would spawn. You can read more on the wiki:
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/World_666_event
---
The humor is from the absurdity of it.
---
I can go to bandos in full ganodermic and camp there for weeks with soulsplit
---
Is there a ingame event today?
---
What do you think that big ole green thing is?
---
&gt; This update does actually make sense.
---
How does it make sense to be the case on ALL max cape variants though? a max infernal/fire cape is EXACTLY the same as a regular infernal/fire cape in terms of stats, so it should be treated like that.
---
Probably a very weird couple of questions, but here goes;
---
Why do I constantly see people wearing red robe hood/top with black d'hide &amp; wizard boots? I'm confused as to why this setup is viable. 
---
Similarly wearing a rune/Verac helm with full d'hide, why?
---
Also, Is Blast Furnace (Iron, Steel, Addy &amp; Rune) a viable monkey maker/XP? Thanks
---
I have had to unskull using the clanwars portal in order to do the wildy step that I got next at least a few times. Idk I guess you don't do much clues, but it does happen.*"You obviously didn't look into it* LMAO.
---
You're right that it's only a mild inconvenience, but again, my main point of criticism is that this was short sighted. 
---
&gt;Please don't post again, your opinions are bad.
---
Oh ok I guess only opininons you agree with are valid. Go fuck yourself lmao
---
I can imagine the looting bots will be gone
---
I have all but 1, mining, and I got it the other day. I was triggered lol.
---
I find it funny how people are suggesting the same fixes for the same problems that we’re faced 10 years ago
---
Can confirm this is inaccurate.
---
Several times, I’ve gotten a key and then twenty seconds later I’ve gotten another one.
---
Where were you on 06/06/2006
---
Hmm could be anything then 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
very cool
---
You’ve got my support!
---
I have a huge issue with the fact f2p tb was added even though it failed *multiple* times. This is a crock of shit.
---
They'll probly add one when the elf expansion comes out tbh. 98 agility and prif elite diary required, of course.
---
ok, thats actually super dank. can now make the F keys regular 1-9
---
Outside game issues shouldn’t affect in game stuff imo. The onus would be on twitch to end her streaming “””career””” but she’s an e-girl so twitch would never do that.
---
Every fan art or concept is better then their artists by miles, should really rethink their hire. not trying to be a dick.
---
Word hop &gt; Lose skull &gt; world hop
---
Wouldn't work, at least unless you would be unable to log into a PvP/BH world for, say 10 minutes, after losing skull in a such way. Still, I doubt it would work properly. Corp deaths are a thing either way.
---
A mod showed up and became another dragon imp. And then it was taken by another player. The mod also turned into jad lmao. Epic post. Thanks Jmod!
---
If you reach this in a couple months you are past normal.
---
Need a talk?
---
lol
---
you can also use overhead prayers in edgeville and level 1. should i ruin my 1 def 1 prayer pure to rag these tbers now?
---
She really should put out another player count for the pets, been like a year or so.
---
haha yep!
---
A wild jad appeared
---
I love the Zaryte bow. Really hope it comes to osrs.
---
Angler please
---
Don’t worry, Legion was amazing for casuals and hardcore players alike
---
Meh, it's really hard to pk in f2p tbh, it will give a bit more chance to get killed as you have to walk 20 lvls if you're tbed but I don't see it as a big thing
---
I actually really miss the silent part of Runescape. I loved being able to listen to music/watch tv/ etc while doing something like Woodcutting, and still being able to chat with friends all the time.
---
Now that I play voice multiplayer games, I always have to mute myself for stupid shit or else people complain. I miss Runescape.
---
god ass
---
Really?? Just right on the island? No additional requirements?? Ezscape.
---
Who decided adding Tele Block to f2p was a good idea?
---
Preventing it's use to scam people sounds dumb for you?
---
That would make PKing too easy at lower levels methinks
---
I think the original design should be lengthened and the curve stick out a little bit more. [I drew what i have in mind as best as I could.](https://imgur.com/S4Jk5p8)

Lmao

I’d say about an hour. It’s afk so it’s all good

I'm not made of money, can you imagine how expensive a tailored suit for someone of his magnitude would be?
---
On the subject of library grinding - is there a way to force the RuneLite plugin to re-update the locations of the books when they shuffle around?
---
If you forget to use an abyssal bracelet, go to corp and suicide.  Its inconvenient to you as you only do it once but a massive burden to troll pkers who drain spec attack then tab to reset their skull so they don't have to risk.  If they want to do this they need to de-gear, die to corp, then re-gear.  
---
This will make anti-rushing these guys MUCH more viable since they will probably be lazy and skulled.  You dont need to wait for them to skull first you can hit them a little earlier, or just teleblock them on another acc or something. 
---
Sorry but its a decent update.
---
I gave my reasons, you're just choosing to ignore them. I'm not usually that critical of osrs updates, this one just seems like bad patching. This was aimed at pvp, like it said in the update post. If I am to believe that post, I can only assume it was not intended to have an effect on anything else. That's why I think it was shortsighted.
---
Triple Oof
---
Wow you really obliterated the imp boxes. I used them at black chins, Venenatis, Vet'ion, and Ecumenical keys. If you wanted to stop their use for scamming in risk fights, you should've disabled them in pvp worlds rather than areas
---
Wow calm down fella
---
&gt;A wild jad appeared
---
post the ss haha
---
Ill def try it out
---
magic, duh
---
Probably higher than most people expect, make a strawpoll?
---
There was a time period where botting was incredibly easy (2010-2011?) and completely free. I imagine a lot of people experimented with it at that time for smaller scale things. Like for example my friend who botted up a low level F2P pker.
---
It wasn't that bad, maybe I was lucky getting good teams.
---
Probably Konar, but emblem prices have gone up to 180-190k a pop and a lot of the wildy tasks are cannonable. 
---
So might be something to consider if Konar gives you shit tasks and you have no luck with the keys.
---
It's well known that the general population hates PvP and will vote no to polls. Add that it's a f2p update so people will vote no to that anyway and you've got a recipe for disaster.
---
The only way for PvP updates to get implemented is just doing it.
---
She just wanted to give you monsters to kill smh
---
It's definitely a feminine dude.
---
Well yes but actually no
---
Stamina potions are your best friend if you're questing on a non-ironman account. They're kinda pricey but if you have the gp to spare, 100% worth it. When I first started playing osrs I just thought they were special energy potions, but they actually reduce your run energy consumption by 80% for two minutes in addition to giving you 20 run energy, essentially each 4 dose potion gives you unlimited run for 8 minutes.
---
Wait that's how pvm death works now in this game?
---
Fuck even RS3 makes you pay to get your shit back if you don't wanna run to your grave
---
If that's what you're into, more power to ya.
---
Tbh they should make a weaker version for f2p since it’s currently scaled for p2p tankability.
---
I’m going to start saying this after sex
---
LOL
---
Why is it that anytime you mention this or talk about it, people act like they were in the world? I mean lol. Bitch you were like 3 then.
---
F2P HCIM burying bones in the wild
---
Too cheap, up it to 2m so they think it is high quality.
---
The gap is larger than you think and sometimes you just don't jump hard enough
---
&gt; Wasn't this polled like 3 or 4 times and they all failed?
---
Also very concerned about this. The "it has no downsides" argument is absolute trash, I don't give a fuck whether its a good or bad update, people voted no to it. It doesn't come into the game. Simple.
---
RIP my man.
---
Just like he killed runescape players in 666, jagex decided to kill runescape in 2007 aswell.
---
Or just add fist of guthix to the game
---
Shit comment tbh
---
Can anybody tell me why this old "move the ge" meme has sprouted up again?
---
Please sell your art or have it available for printing :) this is awesome
---
Anyone think it’s unfair to perm ban the guy? Jagex fucked up, not him, who knows what I would do with that power
---
I actually got back into WoW a couple months ago and have been really enjoying it. Haven't played since Cataclysm and I appreciate a lot of the game changes. What do people dislike about BfA? Genuinely curious, maybe I'll agree with their complaints.

It just won't let you down it.

I swapped to magics around level 82. If you are using clients like runelite  you can try doing a couple inventories of each and see the average xp/hr and go off that.

That’s awesome!

Alternately to this you could get the Abby dagger and torture, train up your strength a bit, then resell. While you MAY lose some money, if you kill something with good loot this would be negated and you could then have strength trained and get the cons level later on
---
Its still just a game.
---
Not to mention the fun of the bug and the entertainment it gave everyone more than made up for the minor inconvenience of anyone that got killed.
---
Give me 50 mil and I’ll make it go away.
---
By farm do you mean herb patch or tithe farm? For herb patch use Xeric's talisman, for tithe farm use the minigame teleport
---
House teleport (if your house is in Hosidius) is really close to the Hosidius farm as well now. Think it's like 10 tiles or so (it's just out of vision range from the house portal, compared to the slightly long run from before).
---
Your username checks out though
---
It’s our month btw
---
They are semi rare
---
I think even though f2p teleblock shouldn’t have been polled, ultimately it was a good idea because it showed evidence of spite voting against pvp updates.
---
ps: wants to be roasted for not having a firecape by reddit

Feels like I'm losing hope...
---
Legion had really strong class development and you felt powerful playing your class.  In BFA you felt like you class got weaker as you leveled up and they just felt like a shell of what they were in legion.  They also removed class sets so grinding to full mythic gear just didn’t feel worth it after the first raid
---
He didn't die though???
---
It's going great, just keep doing whatever you feel like doing!

Time to get that 40 ranged

Since when are black d'hide and Bulwark the only protection PVM'ers have against pkers?

If you use rune lite then the teleports are displayed in the map

If you have hard wildy diary done you can teleport to chins in less than 10 seconds from house.
---
Last episode of game of thrones meme? Thats a paddlin'

You hopped I assume
---
That's such a stupid argument and shows how little you know about PKing. People go to deep wilderness because they want bridding to actually be about bridding rather then the same big spec bullshit that plagues every other form of PKing.
---
Deep wild you're on brews, getting your prayers matter and you can actually KO people by just working them hard and hitting off pray. That's impossible when everycunt angler-brews each time their HP goes below 90, and so the entire experience becomes about getting a big magic-spec stack and that's boring as fuck.
---
It does because ur concerned about shit that has happened since 2015. Like what u concerned about now instead of yesterday.
---
Was pretty cool, during the Golden Age of rs.
---
I'm sorry you got attacked in a dangerous PvP area man what can I say.
---
yh, let alone on elves( i feel they are light quick motherfuckers), didn't rlly thought much of elves just how it will look on a player. Also pernix from rs2 was bulky than again you can see it was made from some special fabric and hard leather.
---
what is your agility level? just 30 agility will make your run come back so much faster
---
Literally wouldn’t have even noticed if you didn’t say anything. Thank you bröther

yh went to big with the shoulder pads

Congrats thatguydead :)

I been blocking the people who post any sort of move the GE to format

Well thats new. Legacy is teleing away then dying once u hit ur new place because of the damage taken. There was *lag* glitches that caused what u described but it happened so rarely. 999/1000 times u died at ur teleport destination.

Read my reply again, you missunderstood.

Can anyone tell me what the point of the unskull update is? Previously people could unskull at Clan wars etc with little to no effort. Now they will unskull themselves with a rock cake/locator orb and poison karambwan for a little bit more effort. What point does this extra bit of annoyance of having to regear accomplish?

He had another account called azn boi 763 that someone gave to him and he was in the clans 3v0lution x and then Reign of Terror.

its not possible to ddoss the servers like it was back then and 2 of the groups that did this have moved on now.
---
i can almost guarantee that a world ddos will not happen, especially not for a 100m loot from a pvmer
---
I like it personally
---
Except they absolutely fucked PKing with God Spells about a year ago under the same pretext. They had an animation delay too and you could dance while using them. It literally wasn't possible to use God Spells to animation delay lure, they had no reason to nerf it. But so few people PK on the terrible standard spellbook that it went basically unnoticed.
---
Take a break
---
true, but ever player rs2 when pernix came out? Pernix was some what bulky and its looked cool af! But yh i can see how this isn't set for range.
---
Not called a massacre for nothing
---
tell him he owes me 200m from 2007. I will accept 100m if he wipes away your debt.

Just use abyss 4head

When the solution to a dead wildy became pushing pvmers to the wildy there's no way anyone could have thought that would be a permanent solution. pvmers aren't geared to fight pvpers and the mechanics and difficulty of PvP is entirely different than pvm so it's understandable that the wildy will die when pvmers are eventually forced out.
---
Why does the "scammer" have to be black??
---
How a pker made you feel after taking your spade should have nothing to do with meaningful pvp updates. If words hurt turn off public.

That's only for people who buy bonds on the wrong game by accident with real money, doesn't apply to bonds purchased with GP.

The general idea shouldn't be to force pvmers into PvP content anyways.

---
im not saying rework the deathsystem. im saying put back the proper deathsystem and the big items are the least problem osrs is facing currently
---
you have to be pretty rigorous to notice something like that.
---
Yeah, it’s sad. If you watch the video, you hear someone warning him to run well before the mob arrives.. He didn’t listen and kept on burying bones. Hard to know what I would have done if I was in his shoes TBH. 
---
After he dies he takes it like a champ tho. Still, feel bad for him.
---
I think it’s pretty messed up that people junped him like that. Not funny IMO. 
---
Makes for great artwork though
---
As a paper salesman
---
How well does it perform in pvm? I tried it and didn't like it, but maybe I just wasn't used to it
---
It seems that you didn't include death, soul and blood altar. And masters have triple step clues too (3 clues per step)
---
Did you just finish the desert elite diaries off a kurask head?

Proudmoore's? more like proudNomoore's

Just a couple more play sessions of solely woodcutting for a couple hours and then I'll have the requirements done for desert treasure.  People hate on mining and runecrafting, but at least they are active skills where you have to move around a lot. I'm at 5k maple logs at level 71 woodcutting.  I should probably move to yews in the woodcutting guild at some point.  
---
My next 'longer' grinds are hunter (36-60), Agility (56-68), Smithing (60-70), and crafting (55-70).  I'm not sure how long this will take.  I know it's nothing like a 99, but I feel so close to the quest cape, yet so far.
---
Some textbooks will use “right right” or “left left”, so it’s not too odd I assure you
---
Thats probably it lmao
---
The task was abby demons in the Abyss, I came very close to skipping it because I'm not ready for Sire and killing abby demons in the abyss is STINKY. Abyssal head is 1/6000 drop rate, and Abyssal Dagger is 1/32,768 drop rate. Happy days though would rather of had this luck on summat else ngl

Dude not every suggestion has to be countered with 'go play RS3'.

And there's a 1/10k chance it sends you to Corp cave instead.
---
I just don’t understand why that was his gear of choice. No amulet even.
---
D2H is kinda weird in NMZ, it's only really worth it if you pick only 1x1 bosses then stack them up with an alt. Otherwise the DPS is too low compared to Claws/GMaul.
---
You're chinning at 74 ranged?
---
Lol I thought zandalar was GM island from classic WoW
---
Shoud be less massive imo
---
misswrote, akward
---
It's just the fact that EoC is fun for PVM but doesn't feel good at all when fighting other players. You don't get the same satisfaction from high xp drops and hits you get on OSRS.
---
poor choice, a teleblock rework is kind of needed since 5 mins is insanely long and most encounters are fast.
---
 as for the teleblock tab putting at attack spell which this is  into a tab will just lead to 1 magic pures and makes lures even easier.
---
also runs pouch needs to be cheaper.
---
Might as well go for 68, you need it for dragon slayer 2. I'm on the same grind currently and it sucks
---
don't smelt the bar yourself though, just keep mining, get to 72, buy upper lvl, and go from there. After lvl 70 mining you'll make 200k+ per hour at Motherlode, and up to like 300-400k at 85+

Those all come from pvm, not pvp. Barrows, gorillas, slayer, godwars, raids, etc. 
---
And what are you even saying lmao. Do I really need to tell you that new players with 70 range can’t afford arma so they use black dhide? Dh is used for nmz, rune cbow is used for a billion things, dbow used for zulrah, dragon knives used for cerb, dds is 2nd bis burst damage for stuff like thermy or cerb if no claws, mystic is used for stuff like zulrah, claws are used for tob, cm cox, and a few bosses with poh method, torags is common def gear for slayer.
---
Ags and d bolts are the only ones I can’t think of a use for, which is why they’re stupidly cheap right now.
---
incourage*
---
The bait model isn't sustainable. I don't actually think the wildy should be a place for pvm or skilling and think they should bring back the items dropping on death when you are killed pvming wherever you are. People complain about how dead the wildy is and swear up and down that they want to fight other pkers but when the suggestion is to encourage pvper vs pvper instead of pushing pvmers to be easy targets they lose their minds.
---
~29m from 15 if I did that right
---
Lol same
---
What? There is no spite. Literally 99% of pvp updates are just putting pvm in the wilderness.
---
Why the fuck would anyone vote yes to those?
---
This is great advice. In matter of merely a few short years, you might be ready for Zulrah. Probably not, but maybe
---
I've had this before, I just relogged and it was back
---
There is no way mystic robes would have 2100 defense. Other than that nice job
---
Don't you need to do challenge mode and get the dust for that one?
---
I like the ancient mace to boost up prayer, if you're using that method.
---
You get xp from tithe farm as well so i think its worth it. And if you only do it during the downtime you get while plants are growing its for sure worth.
---
I feel like instead of moving the GE this sub just moved to the GE itself...
---
So the infernal max cape? Once you have that, the time and effort investment into getting a diary/music/quest cape is pretty minimal.
---
Exactly. It is worth a subreddit.
---
Wait I thought you had to complete cape once to unlock jad tasks...
---
But it’s inside of the inferno now🤔
---
I miss my warrior hair. Used to wear it all the fucking time
---
Green goblin is in Lumbridge, the vulture is in the desert, but I’m not sure where the rhinos is.
---
Already tried that haha, sadly enough no result
---
“Slug daddy” na server, I only play arams too boys count me in
---
I'm sure they will, and I hope they bring back something like the Chaos Dwarf Battlefield
---
Because mage is utterly dependent on teleblock in order to fuction correctly, even in members, hence why singles always has a tber tagging along with them. It is **built**  around it's utility and if that's taken away, it simply doesn't work. TB should've been f2p from the very start.
---
Auto clicked my range tank to 99 mage in 07. Didn’t get caught but I never risked it again
---
Oof, then gl mr. Crow tit
---
This really looks like something out of RS3, the design feels overcomplicated.
---
Fandom bad
---
We've gotten to the point in the meme cycle where we shit on the meme format that we were all jerking each others' dicks over for a fucking month. Can't wait for people to start reposting those boomer memes in a month and then start shitting all over them
---
So are overhead prayers are not changing to 60% from 40 now?
---
Nope. He had it right the first time.
---
1. Grind your way to get \~5k gp, change your gender to female and go to the hairdresser in Fally and visit Thessalia in Varrock
---
2. Become an ethot
---
3. ????
---
4. PROFIT
---
With these easy steps, you can make a bond in a day with low to mid-level stats. Otherwise, you'll have to struggle against bots at the methods that are remotely viable (100k+ gp per hour) or grind your Mining level up to like at least 70+ Mining so you can mine Gold or Adamant ore. Beginner clue unique rewards are also prolly your best bet until the market gets flooded with them.  The best way to get a membership is to bite the bullet and pay the $11 for the 30 days worth of membership.   
---
All the good money makers that can sustain a bond are basically available past 1500+ Total level or once you reach 85+ in a given skill.
---
What hat is this
---
I’d give you gold if I could because of that comment lol
---
Doing tithe gives farming XP so it shouldn't be unefficient in the long run. It also takes just a couple of hours to get...

Seriously

Can you remove the humour flair please?

Apparently Steve Buscemi was also a first responder in the falador massacre.

When you realize this was 13 years ago and you’ve lived more of you’re life with runescape than without it by a decent margin

That is hilarious.

Nah, I think you just need an infernal cape for Zuk tasks.

I know about the sunshine law.. but from my time vacationing in florida people are just more crazy, including the drivers.

Pretty sure they scrapped prif diary

Personally it likes me
---
It's a mechanic that rushers use; I'd be pissed if they fixed it entirely and I don't even rush.
---
True, I just think that there are better goals to go for first if you're trying to clean up your farm run inventory / have greater convenience during farm runs. Rune pouch, bottomless bucket, and good teleports are better imo.
---
Alright, keep contributed nothing to the discussion then and making grossly misleading statements. It isn't a massive xp waste. It is a single minute. If you are switching to and from your angler that often then you aren't as efficient of a player as you think.
---
No need to get butthurt at being wrong man. It happens to all of us, accept it, change your view, and move on.
---
Can someone fill me in on this?
---
Idea jumps straight to people catching black chins instead of high risk fights, where it’s much more common, people will use their special attacks and imp box the high risk item, making there death 0 risk
---
new blowpipe idea?
---
It's more like people won't let you climb through the window unless you've proven yourself a skilled adventurer. Although you'd think saving the Prince would be enough for that one, specifically.
---
Either will be abusable rag gear or useless, there is no room for it in the game, unless you want something stronger than arma
---
The drivers are intense here, I 100% agree with that. I'm a Florida transplant and have adapted to the driving here... whenever I go to my home state and drive somewhere I find myself driving extremely aggressively and need to calm myself down.
---
ur fault
---
Disagree, you do rely on uniques over time to make it worth while. 
---
With his stats he’ll average probably 10 kills/hr (maybe if we are being realistic) and nowadays without uniques you’re looking at sub 750K/hr without subtracting supplies.
---
The supposed attitude of the party that benefits most from a proposed update shouldn't be the deciding factor on how other people vote for that update. It's hard to imagine how many adults are voting like this lol.
---
You don’t keep your bounty hunter target if you suicide plus it’s a shitload more work to bank everything, die, and regear than to just pop into a portal.
---
You could stop being a selfish fuck and throw the PvP community a bone tho by taking the 0.3 seconds to equip a “fucking bracelet” once every week at most when you have an abyss clue.
---
Yikers.  I'm messy but it's really just clothes in random places it shouldn't be.  I don't get how people live like that and are ok with it
---
if thats what youre into, thats all good. for me i like to play just to relax, and its more like work having to pay attention/click two screens rather than just chill with one...doesnt seem worth it for an extra 400k/hour to me
---
You lose stackable/noted items and guess what? They are majority of profit you get from revs
---
This is probably less important to people who play OSRS, but in addition to what people have already said, a lot of WoW fans were really unhappy with the storyline of the xpac, for a few reasons:
---
* Legion ended with a really decisive, final moment in killing a planet-sized supergod, and sealing away the main big bad of the entire franchise, but with BFA they decided to just do the exact same reused conflict of "Oh now the Alliance and Horde are mad at each other again".
---
* It's almost certain that they're going to reuse the plot device of a greater evil forcing the Alliance/Horde to stop fighting and work together (It's going to be the old gods/void lords now, since that's sort of the only "big bad" left in Warcraft lore, and there have been  many incredibly obvious hints towards that).
---
* They totally butchered a fan favorite character, Sylvanas. Sylvanas was a morally grey character in the Warcraft lore, and basically operated a side faction to the Alliance and Horde (though they were officially allied with the Horde). For whatever reason, they recently decided to make her the leader of the Horde, and from that point onward she basically became pointlessly evil, like cartoon villain level, pretty much singlehandedly starting the new faction war and putting the Horde 100% in the wrong.

Most people on the 2007scape Reddit don't PK, and those that do, don't f2p pk. 
---
As someone that does both p2p and f2p pking, teleblock in f2p is a terrible idea. 
---
Right now the highest level magic available to f2p is fireblast at LVL 59. Now all of a sudden f2p has access to a level 85 magic spell that blocks teleporting in worlds where nobody has run energy (no agility or Stam pots), no gear, potions, etc. to tank, and therefore **zero** protection against clans.
---
This update has effectively killed the very limited solo f2p pking that's available past lvl 5 wilderness in favour of clanmanmode.
---
Someone needs to make a “do it for her” Simpson’s meme with runecrafting and that face. I would but I don’t have the talent or time.

I mean. Objectively he's just as nerdy as anyone. But he on fleek and yea sweatpants man.. The guy is magic 😄🇸🇪
---
In 4th year of medical school here, aspiring future psychiatrist and OSRS player here. Short answer to your question is both Yes and No. 
---
Here goes the long answer. I’m on break and have too much free time... here I go.. 
---
For the “yes” part: For Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Psychiatrists often prescribe SSRIs - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. That’s fancy medical terminology for a medicine that blocks serotonin from being taken back-up into the neuron. This allows serotonin to hang out longer in the synaptic cleft. Therefore it is able to exert its serotonergic (happy 😀) effects for a longer duration. This is largely oversimplified, there’s a lot more going on with SSRIs; however, it will do. 
---
For the “no” part: the exact pathophysiology of depression is still unknown. However, many smart doctors and researchers believe there is a lot more going on with depression than just low levels of serotonin. So, other medications are given, besides those that deal with serotonin, for depression. We can give medications that modulate norepinephrine. We use Electroconvulsive therapy for treatment resistant depression where we literally induce a seizure to help cure depression (it’s actually really effective). Even ketamine infusions are being proposed.

Wear better mage bonus gear

Anyone know the hp threshold its advised to stay below while afking at NMZ using absorptions? 6-8hp? I'd prefer to afk 10 mins at a time but I suspect 10hp is too high

People solo pk deep in f2p?

Pretty sure washing is a members skill

I've alchee a dark totem bottom while bursting nechs. Oof.

Profit in pking?
---
UMMM Do you know how much supplies cost. Are you just creating a huge money pit for PcPers
---
I fixed it apparently i had side panels selected except it wasn't updating for me in real time so I didn't think it did anything but its fixed now .
---
Since nobody is giving you a real answer, refer to my other comment:
---
This means there is **no** reason for a solo pker to level magic up, as they'd gain combat levels for no reason, but it's **perfect** for clans who run a few mage pures.
---
Your comparison makes no fucking sense. Neither does your logic. 
---
If you go to the R6S sub, for example, there are me ea aplenty. Lots of content unrelated to memes as well. Good stuff right?
---
The subreddit isn't dominated by the love for a single YouTuber or developer. I don't care if you enjoy those things or post them here. It's the fact half this subreddit has turned into those things, and anyone who remotely steps out of line and says they don't enjoy them is attacked immediately by a crowd and downvoted. 
---
See here. 
---
I'm also not continuing this conversation lmao, when you start calling someone's opinion retarded, you already lost the conversation.  I shouldn't have 5 defend why I dislike something, but the fact I do proves my point that the sub is obsessed. Anywhere else people just move on. Here, redditors act personally attacked, which is pathetic.

Jagex just posted record profits for the 3rd year in a row.  They literally could pay 20 highschool kids min wage to just mute and ban these lvl 3 advertising bots on 5 worlds each.

Better than firemaking or fletching

agreed that it could be a waste of bank space, but id also only use it for a few items like runes, cash stack, and maybe a few other things.

Yes it does because Teleblock exists.

98 agility req, chance of success decreases from 90% starting at lv 1 agility by 1% per level

I’m in the same situation man. I find myself logging in and then I just can’t do anything. The only thing that’s giving me interest is the idea of making a pure. I do want to do raids but still seems like a ways off to grind.

It looks unfinished, like after the wall/lava its just black void

yeah but it shouldnt be an either or
---
community engagement and good customer service (or just any customer service) should not be mutually exclusive. i cant really think of any other situation where this is the case.
---
If this was a free game then yeah, we would be in r/choosingbeggars territory. But i have given jagex easily over $1000, probably more if i were to actually sit down and do the math. while i personally have never had any issues with my account, i hear far too many stories for all of them to be made up.
---
tl;dr - jagex is a company. a good company on 2019 both engages with customers and offers good support. it isnt one or the other
---
So Mod Ash then
---
Remove pvp from f2p. Tbs should have come out 2 years ago. These days, pking at varrock to the hill giant place and around that is dead because of pvp making tbs useless.
---
Toolbelt is a much more massive change than this, this is a tiny interface QoL that will literally change no methods.

It's not a bad idea perhaps you can purchase xp/resources from there using the currency from the mingame rather then having to create new items that may shift the meta/ upset people's nostalgia.

No.

They came together to devise an evil plan called Runecraft..

This is purely from an outside perspective but couldnt the lack of fights be solved by PvP clan leaders working together to create "hybrid hotspots" so theres always a location to go when you want to fight instead of ddosing / doxing each other and wondering why you cant find a fight?
---
Wow! That’s fucked
---
I never played wow, and I'm not planning to start, so for me at least it won't.
---
Says It all bit of a clusterfuck

imp box is bad change.

we said no to f2p teleblock

when did polls started getting ignored so much?

It's a damn animalistic creature for heaven's sake!

Significantly? It’s two extra clicks. I’d rather have those 2 clicks than spend 30+ million. To each his own though.
---
Personally, I think it symbolizes black people in society. What does a dragon represent? Chaos, death, destruction. All things a black society faces.
---
I can deal with the other reasons, but 1 falls into 3 a lot. Can't tell you how many times I've been pking on my pure and halfway through a fight while I'm winning, they call their team. on a fucking pure risking 100k, 180k if smited usually fighting a nearly maxed pure as a base 90s pure. They need to atleast add some sort of PJ timer, if you're fighting back. Nothing as frustrating as getting 10 manned as a pure by kids you've never once seen show up to edge pvp bc they're trash at bridding. Or let protection prayers add extra damage % or accuracy if you're praying off pray. Can't wait for the dhide nerf so people can't camp pray range in double dhide.
---
That's why actually solo pking is dying off in the wildy. No sense in actually fighting someone when 90% of the time they're bait to call a team on you.
---
It looks like someone is having a big party

Ah ok these are some pretty big issues. I definitely agree with your first one listed

Of course you can't trust them, you've giving your money away to someone that actively wants to steal it. I never said anything about that. All I said it there is a percent change that you can win money from a dice bot, which has been proven by countless youtube videos from countless people.

Making barrows tabs is the perfect afk thing to do. I made like 300 of them and I was so happy I did lmao.

Well yeah, I dont think it is either, but the first kill still isnt safe and probably one of the the bigger 'risks' a HC has to take in his journey

I think he asked what movie not which installment, love when people answer like that barely answering. I believe it's from how to train your dragon: the hidden world (aka the third one)

This allows someone to teleblock, then barrage u at same time, max cape let’s u switch now but only a few times a day, this would really fk pkig up. I mean it would be nice for me while I kill ppl at revs but terrible for me when I’m getting pked at revs lol. Rather leave it the way it is

Why not just take a rune pouch and cast barrows tele instead of making tabs if you have the mage lvl?

Wow fuck, rip the Vengeance stall 2006-2019

That’s what I did once I had the mage level for the tele, but for a long time I had to boost. Also, switching soellbooks sucks dick if you don’t have the altar in your POH.

But it's okay for them to call me names because they're on your side of the fence, right?
---
Eh I'm done. It's obvious you have nothing of value to day
---
Wilderness bosses and revenants could literally drop a 10m stack of coins as a common drops and I still wouldn't go do it because the risk is still not balanced with reward. Pkers have several massive advantages over pvmers right now. This shit right here, these comments and this mentality, is what kills the wilderness. Spite voting is just a symptom.
---
Perfect time to go Massacre
---
It's absolutely a sustainable way of making PvP survive and has been a basic part of Runescape since it was first released even before the wilderness was implemented. More skillers/pvmers in wild = more pkers in the wild, you can all of these types of players.  
---
If you look at the rune rocks, greater demons, axe hut, pirate hall, agility course, etc... all those were added to reward people for going to the wilderness by being the best exp/hr or gp/hr for specific skills. There used to be people at these places on every world, the only reason people stopped going there is because Jagex didn't maintain the reward:risk ratio they once had which was basically way higher reward and way lower risk. It was actually a nice reward for not botting back in the day that you could get way more gold/exp in the wild than botting anywhere else. 
---
Do I believe Jagex could really revitalize the wilderness today? probably not as you are right that there's just so many issues like skillers stand no chance, the fact that multi-combat is insta-death yet single combat an alt can splash on you, nor would they be able to poll the types of changes that are needed. 
---
But I do think they'd have more success at fixing up the wilderness than they'll have at turning runescape into an esport.
---
Yeah men can wear Crop tops too that or they just didn't have his size

I see durial’s back for his yearly post

Train your magic honestly. Once you get to 45, you will be able to teleport to most of the main cities and this will help you all around.
---
obviusly using the dragon def + super anti...
---
Maybe said PvMers could benefit from learning to 3-4 item anti pking.  I'm sorry but complaining that people aren't suited for PvP when they knowingly are entering a PvP zone is downright ridiculous.
---
Yes I get that certain content like clues and Mage Arena are in the wilderness and that's annoying and I don't disagree. But almost ALL other wilderness content is at will or high risk high reward content.  I just can't understand or complain about PvMer vs PKer interaction in content that is designed for that specific purpose.  
---
Just learn to veng anti PK.  You'd be surprised at how many bad PKers there are.  I've died to veng claws/AGS Gmaul more times that I'd like to admit.
---
what a steal
---
thanks man!
---
Just the beginning. The guildmaster will give you some notes that you need to enter the jungle, then you just hack your way through the brush with a machete and axe. Once you're in the jungle, just head south to the beach and grab a few vanilla pods.
---
need to get that special attack orb to 78 before i'm impressed
---
Ya we been asking for updates for the past 2-3 years now. But jagex has continued to ignore the pvp community till recently. Even the recent updates/ideas they've had are surface level changes that won't be enough. They'll continue to push small half-assed updates for a short time then go back to ignoring us. I agree having pvm be a big draw to the wildy isn't the best idea, but people have given ideas for updates but again ignored for years now.
---
Thanks, I think I'll do that!
---
Just the start basically
---
Wow I came back to a lot of salt. Dude, it's just a joke. People can do whatever they want I don't care. It's just banter
---
You should be asking the RS3 players considering they are way more alike..
---
defender :\
---
Yeah that's the one. He had it but I'm more wondering how it left my hands and ended up there in the first place. Never had an item go missing like that.
---
Yes, actually.
---
in my opinion there is an objective amount of evidence that points towards you having a small brain
---
omg I thought this was a joke about normandy or something until I realized it actually is 6/6 today
---
Seems kinda idiotic but o well
---
It's just banter, dude. This sub can get pretty salty about jokes
---
You probably did that yourself
---
I think you can keep your boost if you logout every 10s or so.
---
I wouldn't necessarily say it's been brought back into relevance. It's probably useful to have for a clue scroll here or there but it degrades only after 5 uses, which is way too frequent to be useful for runecrafting. Maybe suggest a boost in the charges to 10 or even more to *actually* make it viable to bring along. Even then, since it would replace graceful gloves and therefore ruin the set effect, it might not be useful.

Why not? It's already incredibly hard to die at black chins assuming you have a real inventory setup and aren't trying to cheese by risking absolutely nothing. Bulwark double hides and some other +1 tank items if you're sure you won't get skull tricked along with some brews and you're practically immune from death short of a max team falling in on you and trading specs which realistically never happens.
---
I could seeing it have happened like 2 or 3 years maybe 5 years afterwards. But 13?

If you are consistently afking 10+mins at a time I recommend doing easy rumble rather than hard then you barely take damage even at higher hp.

Glad I'm not the only petty motherfucker out there.

I disagree.

What? Can't tell what you're trying to show

Summoning /u/JagexGambit or /u/JagexHuskey with the new update "Clue scrolls and related items now give a warning when alchemy spells are cast on them, even if the player's alchemy warning settings would otherwise not apply to these items."
---
This also is taking effect in the mage training arena in the alchemist room on trying to alch any of the items. (I have sent a in game bug report as well) 
---
"That item cannot be traded here. Really cast High Alchemy on it?"
---
It depends on what your view of elven is. This strikes me as very tolkein inspired and I haven't seen anything similar in osrs (I haven't spent loads of time in the elven lands so I could've missed an NPC with one), whilst all the other elven weaponry doesn't have that aesthetic, so it almost seems a bit out of place to me. I also think it'll look pretty meh with any decent armour sets.
---
And I actually meant the guard specifically haha.. the hilt is actually made up of the guard, grip and pommel.

I agree, you’re usually stamina’d up though but my big point is it’s useful primarily for clues more so than runecrafting. Just wanted to outline to people who runecraft and may not know about the item itself since it was pretty dead content. People who may wanna bring along a d-pick. I do think it should get a buff though, so far it’s only good for alching.
---
1) as someone that farms papayas, yes
---
I mean the topic was about using someone else’s POH, but I have 1800 total with zero diaries done. I’m an old school player who wrote off diaries off as unimportant lol. I’ve also written off zeah :/ I need to do my research.
---
I think also the prayers make life difficult for that game plan as well
---
Each individual kill is still a 1 in 2.5m chance even if you have 5m kills. The title is exactly correct and not misleading.  That drop is a 1 in 2.5m.
---
barrows isnt really reliable money even with hard diary so do zulrah
---
for zulrah you want to get bgloves (vambs are dogshit at zulrah coz minus magic) +fury+serp helm so you can do 2 less switches while having def. if you have rotations down by memory you should be getting more killd per trip
---
those don't count but also what were they

It's a PVP only area?  When will the quest content (Curse of the Empty Lord and Family Crest) be moved out then?  The PVM and skilling content could stay since there are other alternatives to get that experience/those drops, but there's no non-wildy alternatives for completing those quests.
---
Lol "petty arguments" from someone who got upset over a Runescape meme post. As much as you want this to be a safe space, if you're going to be a bitch, don't be surprised when people call you out for being a bitch.

Yeah I considered something like Fighter Torso as a new item from CWs but think it would shift up the game too much. Maybe make an item (if something like FT was created) PVM only? XP is an interesting idea as well. It would have to be significant enough to get people to play it again, but can't be game-breaking. Its difficult for a casual player like myself to figure out what would work!
---
Nah, I still love it. Keep it up boys
---
commenting so I can find this thread easily later and I'm not sure how to save it on this app
---
Saying jokes is a meme of a meme is the meme of itself a joke that memes over the concept of memes being jokes that we discuss in threads about memes.
---
I didnt say PvP only area. And I doubt anyone camps the quest spots either. I wouldnt mind either way
---
But its legal to swap. He still has that green phat which is over max cash rs3. So bare minimum 300m osrs.
---
There's no way to prove that i didn't do it, i would have thought the same tho. I cant blame you 🤣
---
Could you rebuttal my comment and let me know how exactly it pertains to the gameplay currently ?

Why should something as fun as hunting clues for potential 3rd age items be no risk? Get real. I hate people with your attitude, "I need to not enter the wildy it's not fair" and I hate people on the other end "I love killing weak PvMers" just respect that the clue spot is craters for a reason and get on with it.
---
If it's that scary drop it and move on don't come here complaining about the wilderness.
---
How?
---
u mad
---
Thank you so much
---
True. Instead of making a game that you want to play all day, they made a game where you had to play all day. Big difference, but no difference to them I guess.
---
Mate. The tip it source was made up. I dont known if the reference vid was fake but iirc almost every tipit interview was confirmed fake.
---
I've seen the picture before and I thought it was adorable but this is the first time I've noticed the "MAGA". I thought OP added that, so that's why I mentioned it
---
The odds of getting something at least once by drop rate is around 65% fluctuates slightly as odds rise but stay close i forget the exact formula
---
I think you’d be surprised. As someone who both pks at chins and chins himself I rarely see it. Honestly it’s probably because you lose more time catching the imps than you save banking. Occasionally people do it but the majority of the time it’s not worth the struggle

Yeah so  before you start boosting with stews drop an extra ess on the ground so you can pick it up after you drop your pouch.

A quicker answer than Google? Are you being serious?
---
Being on a console is understandable, you would have to get up and go to the computer to check (assuming b4 cellphones were common) which would interupt your gameplay session. Plus if you are on console with a friend you are most likely on voice chat as well. That is a way different situation than being on the machine that has your answer, alt tabbing past Google to type out the question to someone in disc.
---
Yes, I just wanted to point out a typo for the mods ;)
---
He wasn't banned for this though? He was banned for RWT'ing.
---
bröther?
---
Tyvm :) Means a lot!
---
Doesn't it depend on the log type or is that only RS3? Well, in RS3 at least it's +15 per tier of log type.
---
He has an army protecting him though
---
&gt; You never add the total amount of attempts in probabilities unless explicitly stated.
---
To actually answer this: Sure, the probability of exactly hilt and pet in a single try is 1/2540000, but say OP posted this no matter his KC. What if he tried to get this drop for 10m kills? You can't just exclude all the failed attempts.
---
Yes, however, I think you're referring to arrow shafts. I mean the process of making the headless arrows (arrow shafts + feathers)
---
For your solution to work, it would have ot be disabled on w65 as well (high risk world). Need two different worlds due to ping issues.
---
Seems like a job for Moonman.
---
I grab it from the GE.
---
Bröther?
---
Ohh, yeah, arrow shafts. Damn mixups.
---
Just because you asked, I’m gonna downvote them now. I don’t want a video I don’t like to be in my liked videos playlist just because I feel bad the creator doesn’t have enough likes? Participation trophies do nothing for content.

You can cancel the animation same way you can cancel venge antimation. Will not work for risk fighters.

If you already have discord open it's much faster.

Woah!
---
BP is pretty bad for training range IMO, the high cost of Scales/hr really makes the cost not worth it, and you're better off training with Grey Chins at that rate.
---
Lmao it's a like. I knew I'd get comments saying this. But I don't understand people who like videos to save them it's just lazy 😂
---
That picture is just legendary.
---
D hide is broken, not only in PvP but in PvM as well. It's stats are retarded and a nerf is warranted.
---
I disagree with nerfing bulwark though. It only has one use afaik (tanking in PvP) and imo, it shouldn't be nerfed
---
Obviously I know my stats are low lol, I’m just asking for some direction.
---
And it's not for content on YT. It's to get OSRS videos more popularity thus increasing game populace.
---
Ehh you could RWT the gold for dragon imps but that would be expensive as hell I can’t even imagine. Also I don’t think you can get the tools from elites but still would get you close.
---
It was just honestly a relief to be able to register after publishing my thesis

For Pest Control, I recall having a bad time with 40 Att/Str trying to maintain green activity with a Rune longsword, but this was before the latest pest control changes (apparently they made activity easier?). I'd go with 42 att/str at a minimal.
---
More like a week off, wintertodt grind!
---
yeah you cant use them at dks anymore at all basically
---
I was in the Woody once with 200m like an idiot. A guy came and tried to kill me, before he could I told him I’d give him the 200m because I didn’t want to loose an “ancient shard” that I thought was rare. I gave it to him, he left, someone else came and killed me, and I found out those shards are next to useless.
---
More useful than runecrafting
---
I would love this idea
---
Serious question, how does everyone get to this city. Currently I take the ship to the port and run across the freaking terrible woods. I must be missing something.

Question on farming. Recently started using Ultra Compost for magic tree's after checking out the wiki's, financially a better option than coconuts. My question is if anyone knows the general success rate for magic trees? I saw that magics were  8/128 per growth stage and Ultra Compost was (chance \* 1/7) per Jmod and read on that tweet's comment that it's been updated to (chance \* 1/10) per another Jmod. They had also mentioned the chance to fail is always rounded down. 
---
So 8/128 \* 1/10 = to a .625% of dying per stage which gets rounded down to 0. I know this isn't true because the fail rate for me has been noticeably high, last batch I had 2/6 tree's die.  My issue is even if Ultra Compost was still 1/7, it's still a .89% chance to die which should be rounded down to 0. So which number is wrong? Did the mods update something that I missed?
---
tldr: What is a Magic tree + Ultra compost death rate?
---
It has better melee defence than karils along with similar range defence. No other t40 defensive item is comparable to its t70 counterpart.
---
In a market with near perfect information, arbitrage is incredibly difficult.

I guess I rolled off on people as an arrogant bastard after I got my rc cape... gained some harsh critics whenever I brought up my rc level... I feel like I'm internally good though, not meaning to put people down or be overly annoying... though I felt it hard to connect.
---
TPB/OSRS memes are the best
---
Downvote for shitty repost
---
yeah dks your constantly in combat
---
but they can be used in combat right now, that hasnt been changed?
---
I saw the post about the other hcim getting his diary cape and I thought "what if..."
---
Same! Ha
---
You got unlucky, I don't remember the exact number but it was something less than 2%.
---
Agreed did it recently on my 60 agility IM fell maybe 5 times.
---
So what you're saying is that runecrafting has something to do with spells?
---
Exactly my thoughts
---
WEED
---
Elf teleport crystal. Kill some elves to get a tiny crystal then pay Islywynn (might be a different elf) to enchant it for teleport charges.
---
&gt;Stop adding arbitrary exceptions to gameplay and just balance the fucking mechanic around both pvp and pvm at the same time.
---
Wow, I really could not disagree with this more. It's hard enough to design balanced content for one of the two as it is, where something gets legit use and isn't overpowered. Being able to completely separate what a weapon or gearset does vs players and monsters should be the standard. 
---
&gt;Such a shitty precedent to make changes to the game that people didn't want, and claim it's needed for the game. 
---
F2p is an advertisement for the game. I'm fine with true f2p players not getting a say in what happens to the trial version of the game. Jagex owes those players nothing. It should be 100% within their right to design the trial version in whatever way they think will maximize f2p-&gt;p2p conversion. Considering literally every person who *actually* f2p pks wanted this, and *only* people who don't play it at all voted no, I couldn't care less that this was implemented.

We should experiment. Post your discord and people can ask you questions and we will see if you respond faster with the correct answer than Google.

Fuck em’ then! Honestly I love the guys in my clan and I haven’t had any toxicity. If someone hates, let them. It won’t stop me. They can find another clan, you know? We need more genuine communities and you can build one (:

Was to stop gambling iirc

No. Get out.

Why not wait a week before reposting next time?
---
theyre only really usefull with stackables, and if your not in the wilderness theres really no need to bank said stackables
---
the thing with the wild is that theres a risk you could lose whats in your invy so you want to bank. outside of the wild this isnt a risk, so theyre basically worthless.

Woke up to a cleaned bank, should have setup authenticator sooner...

Can I just use Chins to finish fight? Or switch back to BP?

Alright, gonna work my way towards some base stats and start with hunter then!

"Legal" directly refers to the law. I get where you're coming from but breaking rules that were created by a private entity for their own product would not be considered "illegal", unless those rules are somehow backed by the law.

Won’t ever work because 70% of the game is constantly burnt out until the next content comes out and they complain until it happens again. Bossscape
---
Eehm sorry? 1 rc means im a real scaper
---
&gt;This game existed for close to 15 years where this wasn't much of an issue. 
---
The game and content of years past that you are describing was much simpler, and there was no endgame content. Balancing a rune scimitar is easy. The majority of players today expect higher level, actually engaging content and *new* things coming out to keep the game fresh. But adding new content and rewards for it that is neither dead on arrival nor considered powercreep is a very, very delicate balance. 
---
&gt; you shouldn't arbitrarily pick and choose where it can be used
---
It's not arbitrary. The split is very distinct. PvM vs PvP. Very simple.
---
&gt;If trident is overpowered, it shouldn't have been released that way, not arbitrarily prevented from being used in the wildy.
---
Why do you find it impossible for something to be balanced in a PvM context but unbalanced in a PvP context? PvMers overwhelmingly want the meta to develop, it's what allowed us to have much more engaging content like raids and inferno that has totally revitalized the endgame. PKers, on the other hand, don't feel the need for new weapon/gear content in the same way, because the mechanics of fighting other players don't really change with different gear. 
---
&gt;"Game balance is hard" isn't a valid excuse when there are several million people paying $11/month for this crap.
---
OSRS does not have several million active subscribers. It's ran by a small team that's paid well below market rates. How about you point to examples of suggestions or existing gear that's come out post OSRS release that you think is balanced well? Shitting on everything that's come out without an alternative is pissing in the wind. They're not going to stop updating the game.
---
Hmmph, i May have underestimated you, sir. Carry on.
---
I kill clue scroll pvmers in the wild because it means less clue items come into the game, so my items go down less in price

Thank god ive been loving this series so much. Thanks tedious

Isn't that an rs3 thing...

He gave the phat to a friend before the account was banned. The friend took it and told him to fuck off. His account has nothing of value on it.

The stats aren't good anymore, only the name would be worth anything.

Amazing diagnosis. This bot must be sentient
---
You're right. He's got that perfectly chiseled jaw.
---
He means the stats aren't worth shit, they were good back in the day but being maxed now in rs3 isn't hard. His highest skill is like 94 range or some shit. That honestly wouldn't even be worth much in osrs.
---
His items have like no value in rs3. Whips are alch price, they're low tier. Ahrims isn't worth anything either. He doesn't have the phat anymore, as he gave that to a friend before his account got banned and the friend told him to fuck off. Theres probably nothing of value on that account, only the name would be worth anything.
---
I’m pretty sure that you can imagine that that is crazy OP.
---
The goal of wildy bosses was high risk, high reward. The bosses don’t have an entry barrier too. So bypassing the high risk part.. was not good.

Inside the woodcutting guild both the visible and invisible boosts apply. Outside they do not.
