Abyssal accumulator is a noob trap
---
Most bots are quick to get back up and running. Also there is gold farmefs farm that aren't botting, but actually playing to sell the gold. Jagex is doing quite a good job already, i just hope they can do better!
---
Xeric's Focus. You can see it in his game at the bottom left.
---
yes, jagex released an official statement that runelite is currently in full compliance with their rules. 
---
so nothing pn runelite carries any risk of ban. 
---
i mean false bans are always possible but u get my point, nothing you can do w runelite is breaking the rules.
---
Probably not, he's rather introverted
---
#he
---
Except my username ofc
---
Well, you could always safespot the head guards, until they drop one. I was thinking of doing that with some knives.
---
People think picking endurance is all fun and games until you gotta manually bury those bones
---
Litteraly
---
My apologies, I understand now a month later what you meant LOL
---
Herb isnt slow? You can get like 200k/ hour with potions. 
---

---
And tithe farm + anything else can be over 100k, so not horrible. Slayer and runecraft would be the slowest definitely. The hard part is I dont know of any runecrafting altars in zeah besides crafting blood and soul, which is level 77 dependent. So y we yeah
---
Downvotes don‚Äôt matter and don‚Äôt do shit... if you think this is nearly as good as what he usually produces then you‚Äôre delusional
---
In addition to what other people said he literally said himself that he is a nazi. He also used to have a different comic where he was even more anti semitic and so on.
---
I appreciate this.
---
i'm not doing other skills, that's the point
---
1/512 chance seems like it'd take a lot longer to get than other methods, good ranging xp tho I guess.
---
This editing looks like it came out of a 2006 runescape music video. None of this shit looks difficult to make - I could literally make this level of video. I have never thought that before about any of his previous edits; it‚Äôs bad.
---
I think that‚Äôs projection; that doesn‚Äôt seem like Woox‚Äôs scene.
---
You know how much money you can make doing herbs and battlestaves? Zulrah is what per kill with a pool. 80k per kill? Vorkath a little more? You can make a bond in a day easy with just those.
---
Wanna know too
---
‚ù§Ô∏è Yeah it was my bad. 
---
In my brain I was thinking the next like was phonetic, like "chicka baw baw chicka chicka baow boww"
---
Great, now go lay in it.
---
Post gmaul nerf though you will want protect item, unless you want to risk the 500k ornate maul handle on your gmaul every fight. I am in the process of making a gmaul pure too, (50atk, 58 str 63 range 55hp and 26 prayer going to get 31 soon though). Add my pure rsn "illsit420" (decided to save the pker typing sit cos ik ill be dying a lot! lol) if you want to practice at clan wars or whatever.
---
Congrats!!!
---
Walkers out
---
Except the Hosidius ploughs. Otherwise great! Wish there were a few more world be CA use of bottle-necked resources, but overall not too bad after hopping worlds a couple times to get what you want.
---
He sucks against the elite four though.
---
Ok Ben Shapiro. Don't you have some college students to debate or something?
---
air orb bots being banned -&gt; air orbs go up in price -&gt; air battlestaves are tied to alch price so vanilla battlestaves drop
---
Prolly like 150-200 in bonds
---
It‚Äôs the eye patches. No one would ever expect you to be a boy in those things.
---
Dust devils drop rune arrows
---
Glad the game doesn't revolve around niche game modes like uim.
---
For about a month, maybe, it would be cool and a nostalgia hit.
---
Then everyone would remember how annoying it is and it just becomes a day where you don't trade.
---
Support
---
yes
---
Yeah, unless you get noted drops. But the 5x is probably better anyway.
---
Get overheads (dark altar gang rise up) and kill whatever monster drop them.
---
Honestly one of the best things about rl
---
If Joey Gatewood‚Äôs dad played at auburn they‚Äôd win this game
---
cost like 700gp for 48 minutes of dragonfire protection my dude
---
we need great orb project for people like you
---
Multi tick training maybe?
---
Were all pretty close so it gives a super chill vibe!  
---
But yeah thats dope man! Glad to have you!
---
I chime in with a haven't you people ever heard of
---
mining the goddamn ore?
---
Lmao yes they do. You can't really go to the original /leftypol/ anymore, but there are definitely discords used to do this shit
---
RareWoox
---
Having good hygiene and grooming is different than assessing someones employment capability based on their bmi.
---
What in the world does that have to do with the comment you‚Äôre replying to
---
It‚Äôs almost like making a joke of nazis desensitizes you to them
---
Damn this guy gets it. My only thing is i don‚Äôt let myself drink alone so i‚Äôd have to think of a workaround haha.
---
won't be bringing falador shield, SGS yes but won't be camping it.
---
I'm guessing around 15-16 pots?
---
Yeah it was kind of neat. There's no reason to buy a bank sale now.
---
&gt;And tithe farm + anything else can be over 100k
---
Yea but tithing does what to get you enough herbs to get 99 herb? 
---
It's like saying you can bank 99 mage from doing library for runecrafting xp
---
Nah, I'm fine with some content not being usable, it's meant to be a restricted game mode after all. Clues should not be the justification for an item being catered to - Rune Plates can come into Zeah/Leagues through Hydra, Brimstone Chest, Sarachnis, Skotizo, etc, as well as various clues (and they are much more common than d scims from clues). 
---
D scims can only get in through masters as far as I'm aware? So catering to a tiny amount of people for no real reason
---
This makes too much sense not to implement.
---
well for example, i recently got a blue dragons task and i really like it because it‚Äôs around 400k an hour and i can safespot, so it‚Äôs easy to do.
---
Now thats one i havent seen before
---
Try doing just the runecrafting or stuff like tithe farm without stams &amp; graceful
---
I'm pretty sure the lava cape is made of actual lava while the smithing cape is just an image of an anvil.
---
Love the clan, great people!
---
Holy lmao
---
On the subject of obtaining quest items after the quest, I'd really like to add the Golden pot, Golden candle, Golden feather, Golden needle, Golden tinderbox and Golden hammer of the quest Priest in Peril to the list. Maybe a good time to make them usable as well. :)
---
People can already burn food 100% of the time. Just used cooked food on a range.
---
How slow is 99 agility vs how fast it is to simultaneously train combats and bank bones for an alter that's 350% and another 5x xp. 
---
One of these things is not like the other.
---
That's how it is to play an area-restricted ironman, you must to work with what you have. If we made countless exceptions like this then kinda the whole point with this league is gone.
---
What's your favorite mandy dose? Do you supplement?
---
Why do you need to know what they are playing? By the way they are talking it's pretty obvious..
---
Oooooooh
---
If you goal is to go for the CoX solo times, or solos in general, you‚Äôll absolutely want the endurance. You won‚Äôt be able to reliably get enough stams otherwise for either the VTV or VSV scour that will be required (at least for any reasonable number of attempts. You could opt to use purple sweets at risk of losing combat ticks but that‚Äôd require clues which would undoubtedly be inefficient without endurance and any time farming Harrlanders is wasted time (imo). 
---
If you don‚Äôt plan on soloing, you can get by without the endurance but you will still *likely* have to avoid stamina-dependent rooms being Vasa, Vespula, and Shamans (assuming they‚Äôre not safespotted). Meaning you‚Äôd probably best avoid CM raids and have to go with generally slow scouts.
---
I‚Äôll be posting a full comprehensive list of all BIS league gear dps in raids for each room (in comparison to max in the regular gamemode) as well as what I believe will be the optimal setup in order to achieve the sub12 run or the CM time(idr this off the top of my head) when I finish it *possibly* tonight. 
---
Also - a single stamina dose is better than one full energy potion(4); so please don‚Äôt suggest that as an alternative lol.
---
What kind of business doesn't value their security?
---
Runecrafting sucks. Tithe isn't needed much if your goal is max total tbh.
---
You actually look at peoples post history... what a dong
---
Boys get a load of this shape shifting ball shaping shat hahahahaha
---
Wow
---
He eat the web
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Always deserved
---
I mean, besides the quests that clearly show completed in the list, every content behind quests is locked
---
God forbid we know whats in your rune pouch
---
Nechryaels (7/128) and steel dragons (2/128).
---
Eventually you can get 60 woodcutting and 75% hosidius favour and buy one from the WC Guild, costs 41k gp. Or get lucky from a hard clue.
---
Strong woman
---
If zezima is god, woox is jesus
---
ok thanks! I knew about nechryaels but was hoping there was a lower level NPC
---
I know!! It's really fun. I wish I had more time to play. I love how there is no established meta - makes it much more enjoyable to watch.
---
Not the first, as this tweet was from 24 hours ago, but gratz  https://twitter.com/DeadBotting/status/1195492589249675264
---
The wiki page tells you, via the twisted league icon: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rune_axe
---
* Nechryael
---
* Steel dragon
---
* Woodcutting guild shop
---
I have the same relics and I‚Äôll probably pick artisan for tier 3 to speed up smithing by a lot
---
Got you?? Bro I‚Äôm just agreeing. Nazi‚Äôs are quantifiably 100000000000000000x worse than communists. Communism has literally never killed anyone!!!!!
---
bro üòéüí™
---
I'm self-conscious about what's in there
---
What level is your hitpoints?
---
Downvote because RS3
---
Glad I‚Äôve chosen the same relics as him so far. I must be doing something right.
---
you're literally just strawmanning
---
if your only deflection from "nazis are bad" is calling the other person a communist, you look real fuckin fishy
---
Even if I got to 75 range, a blowpipe isn't in my price range, I think im gonna stick to the cbow but next time im taking less brews and more restores
---
Well now I know what I'm getting
---
&gt; it would be slower skilling xp/h in exchange for greater variety and artisan xp
---
Which is why you would have to always train it otherwise you are wasting your time which is the exact same problem as slayer. If artisan isn't completely dead content on arrival nobody is going want to waste their time skilling off task when you could just skilling on task and you don't need to be an EHP slave to realize that.
---
Use dragon diamond (e) bolts, otherwise no point with the dragon cbow lol
---
lol literally all of your posts so far are just accusing people of being communists with no basis, this is just getting pathetic dude
---
Maybe, juuuust maybe the sarcasm means communism isn‚Äôt really good and had literally nothing the fuck to do with nazism you idiot?
---
Or whatever, just pull that logic from as far up your ass as you can reach lmfao
---
Oh look, another one.
---
I love this.
---
It's quite literally a political opinion.
---
r/cutenoobs
---
Nice alt commie bitch
---
Well, it doesnt have to be the same but the new content Jagex brought out for magic is just :/ ... 'fire surge' people pray mage and it makes it useless.  Something strong like Armadyl storm, with requirements etc would create ton of new content like:
---
New quest to unlock
---
New account builts
---
More people can PK on normal spellbook wildy/deep wildy
---
and more... haha
---
The funniest thing is that I've seen so many people getting uniques and rangers, etc that I'm almost certainly sure that it is rigged lmal
---
he said on his stream that the 2x multiplier is better for points but he wants to solo raids. just full info related to his build
---
Whats faster in your opinion? Sorcerers garden or herbi for herbs? My gf has a level 3 iron and has been doing sorcerers garden.
---
Shes also a bit scared of doing some of the quests for fossil island and messing up her cb stats
---
#accumulatorgang
---
Agreed
---
Please, please help. This was. 6 year account and not even that high of a level. I'll never be able to have the time again
---
oh shoot!
---
Thanks a lot this is exactly what I was looking for!
---
I think it‚Äôs because woox has normally been very quiet and didn‚Äôt really use to show much emotion on stream.
---
&gt;Someone kill me
---
Don't worry, I'm sure Jad will.
---
I got the dragon crossbow as a gift, that's why im using it, but will try your suggestion
---
If another person requires from you, anything other than a simple 10 second trade - for you to earn anything. It's a scam.
---
You‚Äôre literally just strawmanning
---
If your only deflection from ‚Äúcommunists are bad‚Äù is calling the other person a nazi, you look real fuckin fishy
---
We should start a cc for gambling on fights with gp
---
They basically made it so the gmaul uses 60% spec (so its usless pretty much), unless you add an 'ornate maul handle' which you can buy on the GE for around 500k which makes it exactly like the old gmaul.The spec is back to 50% (so you can double maul) if you die without the maul being protected it will drop 375k coins to the pker. It was basically to increase risk of the huge combos (like ags gmaul, claws gmaul etc) so higher level players had to risk more than 150k to be able to hit over 120 damage combos. It basically just effects low prayer 50 atk pures cos everyone else just gets atleast 25 prayer for protect item now.
---
When you say a phrase and use sarcasm during that phrase it's not a jump in logic to say the entire phrase was sarcasm.
---
If you talk about nazis in a sentence you shouldn't be surprised if someone points that out.
---
Though to be fair I didnt expect much from you. That is seeing as your are someone going around this thread calling ppl commies and retards.
---
Stop camping eagle eye
---
People are eat at 99 so wont even have a place except for trolling.
---
Definitely not. Their defence is pretty low and you don't really miss often on them (using regular whip). Halving their hp doesn't really solve the problem. The issue is kill time and this is created due to the crazy amount of animations they need to go through. Jagex has already talked about plans to rework thia boss.
---
Osrs.wiki
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs definitely 2 sides of the same coin. Personally I‚Äôm of the opinion that we should pretend they don‚Äôt exist and stamp out their little larp bullshit when they decide to make some noise(like beating people with bike lock‚Äôs in public). But I definitely see the merit in what you‚Äôre saying. I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be totally against it, but it‚Äôs damn near impossible for me to listen to them, they‚Äôre so unbelievably vile and inhumane.
---
[Montage from the Team America Soundtrack](https://youtube.com/watch?v=vK4gv11PTI8)
---
Because the opponent could ballista spec or ags spec u a 70 the same tick. Tho its still gunna be dead content cuz people eat at 99 and dps isnt good enough to get someone below 50.
---
100 dev hours wouldn't even put a dent in it.
---
I still have this
---
That's an odd way to spell Guthix
---
Dude I had 5 I bought for 500k, they were bis for a while and were massively useful for rcing.  Used them make nats all day
---
They literally can't because this works even with vengeance and it has something to do with how the 18 year old jagex spaghetti-engine handles these types of animations.
---
Bots help the economy as much as people hate to admit it. Banning them all instantly would hurt the basic items that mains take for granted like vials, feathers etc.
---
Not that they should stay, but people seem to think it's good only because they're sharks will increase 20gp.
---
Share I tbed
---
Nice
---
Struggling with 2005 boss mechanics in 2019, imagine being so unintelligible you can't flick between two attacks. No wonder this game is being held back when you have these TikTok watching, Low IQ, Zoomers who can't figure out basic 15 year old game mechanics
---
It shows discipline, which is one of the most important character traits.
---
You can't buy or inherit a toned physique, you lose it when you slack off, and only hard effort over a long period of time makes it possible.
---
Lol imagine being offended by people calling atone toss a nazi
---
I feel like the necromancy thing is already covered by Arceuus Spellbook - but an expansion to the Arceuus book that adds utility reanimations/servants could be very interesting! It does almost nothing at the moment besides prayer training and niche ports. Add new Ensouled Heads or change some existing ones to utility servants etc.
---
I like how we can have a political conversation about platforming tankies and nazis in the forums of a 20 year old game. Nice sorting out our misunderstandments.
---
Gotta be quick on the logout/ fast at spamming bones on alter if you dont
---
Did anybody ever play suspicious cop or bug on a wire? Wouldn‚Äôt have found rsc without playing those shitty games during school.
---
I don't use eagle eye
---
Yeah bursting Nechs back to back to back would be like 300k+slay exp
---
Stone toss is a nazi
---
The hell are minnows lol I just meant like swordfish and stuff :)
---
Someone grinds The Office while motherload mining
---
I've had a busy few months and haven't kept up with the game or news. The only thing I've seen is that third-party clients like RuneLite are not okay anymore? Can anyone update me on how that ended up resolving?
---
 What do you want to be that none of the qa at jagex knoe how to 1t flick.
---
Total xp and date of screenshot showing? Gf nerd, thanks for the rent money
---
Haha you‚Äôre good dude, I was joking :P
---
Would it though? I have it in my bank as well, but if anyone could just get it back easily, I would probably drop it.  The only reason any of us care about it is *because* it's difficult to own.
---
*laughs in Spanish*
---
ah yes, make them untradable so even less people play it and it turns into the dead content dmm became.
---
fuk u man i've done like 500 and i don't even have the full pyromancer set
---
It's quite literally impossible unless Sparc Mac bails him out or he gets lucky staking. It would take over 21,000 hours of hyper efficiency maxed Vorkath to earn that much cash.
---
If you want to downvote and argue fine, but we will see what hits all 99s first.
---
That's cool but he's talking about casuals
---
No plz my mom's gunna ground me
---
Wish we could re-roll Twisted League accounts. I regret picking accumulator.
---
Use a lamp from Client of Kourend for 15 hunter (Twisted League)
---
Your smartphone is an incredibly advanced and powerful device, but it‚Äôs also expensive and fragile. It can end up freezing or slowing down, and in other cases, it can break for a variety of reasons.
---
You can take a few measures to ensure this doesn‚Äôt happen and even if it does, all is not lost.
---
Your phone slows down/freezes
---
Cause: A few things. The most common cause is an unresponsive app which is taking up more memory than expected. Another possible reason is the age of your phone‚Äôs hardware. The older it is, the more likely it will slow down as it copes with more advanced OS and apps.
---
Ways to help: There are a few things you can do. If an app is the cause of the problem, closing it ‚Äì bringing up recent apps by double pressing the home button or pressing recent button ‚Äì can help free up some memory.
---
Clearing your phone‚Äôs cache and memory data can also help.
---
If your phone is practically unusable, Android devices have a safe mode option ‚Äì hold down the power button and then hold down on turn off phone when it appears on screen ‚Äì which can help you remove any apps that are causing it.
---
If that doesn‚Äôt work, force-reset your phone by holding down the power button and home button/volume up button.
---
In the worst case scenario, you could perform a factory reset which will restore your phone to its original settings, but make sure you have your data backed up first before progressing.
---
How to prevent: No technology is perfect and even new devices might end up freezing every now and again. The only thing is to keep an eye on is if one specific app or a few are causing the problem ‚Äì removing them or other unimportant apps can help matters.
---
Raccoon

Slayer is by far the most popular skill so this really just sounds like a you issue. Sorry some of us like some variety in our gameplay lmao. Also your math agrees with mine so idk why you wrote all that out .
---
This. LMS Is great for practicing pvp. You get a loadout and stats.
---
im 590 kc no pet or tome on my hcim :(
---
It totally did make a difference with the elf votes.  That's how we ended up with an ugly Elena chathead even with the whole community raging over it.  They polled it like this, labelled one option "compromise," and naturally it won.  It also doesn't help that you can't see the options in the in-game poll, but that's not their fault I suppose.
---
Respect
---
Literally 99 agility is nothing compared to unlimited run. That was what your statement was talking about. At 99 agility it takes 4.3 seconds to recover 1 run energy. That's 7 minutes to recover full run energy at 99 agility. You know how long it takes to recover unlimited run energy? None.
---
I‚Äôm fine with it, I‚Äôm saving for the slayer helm for personal use.
---
I got 13 quests left, I'll be joining you soon brother
---
I just hope all leagues are iron man mode, I feel like streamers getting fed stuff would really ruin the competition
---
Did you expect anything else?
---
i have used oakdice to swap over 3b rs3 to osrs and haven't been scammed yet!
---
Splashing is efficient if you would otherwise be getting 0 xp/hour.
---
Yo! I just did a simile grind over the past 3 days. 51 - 66. You work remotely too or just staying at home to raise your kiddo currently?
---
You're taking this way too personally, my dude.
---
I'm gonna take a gamble and say that this is satire, I don't know how I'd take it if it wasn't
---
There's silver jewelry that uses opal/jade/topaz, but those effects are for members. I guess we could add the ability to make silver jewelry using sapphire/emerald/ruby/diamond too, if we can come up with useful effects for them.
---
Can you also add the Ardougne knight platelegs back as well?
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ardougne_knight_platelegs
---
so if i'm not misunderstanding something. Altar + Resilience = never needing prayer pots because your points restore faster than they drain. (assuming only overheads).
---
What was the original 4th panel?
---
Please see yourself out with this brainlet argument. Pet content is about doing things yourself, not about making Clue Scrolls more profitable. People like you see an ironman flair and turn your brain off, it's insane.
---
How vague can you fucking be
---
Jesus, if Jesus surpassed god and became the new god of the realm.
---
At the time I would come home from work at 4:30pm and afk cballs until about 10pm daily lol took about a week but it made me a decent profit for barely having to play lol
---
Yah wtf you might accidentally lose your virginity with those rookie numbers
---
Im looking for people to spend time making them, if you dont have the time, no point in replying.
---
mayb actually quest instead of bankstand  üòé
---
Try chins man! Helps me get through healers quick
---
Lol
---
It's really only the "reset" animation in between phases. Having to watch dusk cross the room for 1500+ kc from the safe spot is several seconds twice per kill that doesn't need to be there.
---
Hyayayayayayayayhaha wow.
---
I just completed my first fcape today and this was me.
---
It depends. If resources that can be gathered at lower levels are useful for higher level crafting, then lower levels can have access to fairly decent money making methods.
---
For instance, iron ore is 70gp each on OSRS, and 390gp each on RS3 (and this is with the mining update making afk mining possible.)
---
This doesn't really help the case of vendor items, but resources that are in demand for crafting skills will never drop down to alch price, and players of any level can make money that way.
---
idk about you, but since when has locking content resulted in more ppl participating... thats literally just unfeasible. Just like if you lock something exclusively to the wilderness, its done less than it would if it werent in wildy.
---
The irony here is thicc
---
Impossible to tell right now considering we're not even a week into the league.
---
umm yes they can they already patched multiple items that enable this including vengenance veng only works in pvp now not non pvp.
---
I dont think it's a children's game, but a lot of us were children when we first played it.
---
The internet gives people the courage to act like dickheads, just look at twitter.
---
I don‚Äôt want to play mobile though. I rather download the client that has mouse support
---
This. Everybody thinks I'm doing it to be nice, but in reality is just the easiest points possible
---
Ya him too
---
My point is that if even an old smartphone can run OSRS, where the client isn't downgraded much or at all in terms of processing requirements, that basically any laptop you'll be able to find on the market in 2019 will be able to run it.
---
Yes that's true, but you can't use them
---
Probably shouldn't have picked a relic that didn't give infinite run then :))
---
the top 1% will undoubtedly be worth a lot, especially the slay helm. However, why should ppl play a 2 month grind for cosmetics and waste hundreds of hours...... the only reason that ppl play league is cause you gain stuff for your main game. They already have trophies, is that not enough untradables for you?
---
Wtffff
---
Ok thanks I‚Äôm gonna buy the laptop and posted. It should work. Appreciate it
---
Welp don‚Äôt bring expensive gear that you‚Äôre not willing to lose. Plus 4m = maybe a hour
---
Correct, it doesn't count
---
I'm replying to what you wrote, you keep changing the subject because your ego is too big to admit you got proven wrong. Grow up please.
---
Have fun, champ.
---
Easy to tell how mature you are
---
Well, I didn't know about shop refreshing 1 chocolate per minute and by the time of starting haven't seen any info about upcoming relics.
---
Anyways, I assume, it won't be as bad with all the teleports unlocked. Couldn't get a xerics talisman yet with 150 kills and around 450 chests.
---
Clues are fun
---
Ahh got the harvester relic I see... Worth it?
---
You too brother üëä
---
True lol. Didn‚Äôt see the instanced warning so I thought it was fine. Still hilarious to me either way
---
I got him on my 4th attempt
---
Well i'm certainly not *angry* that i found this.
---
well, if you dont wanna get stuck with a blue drag task, go for it, in other words, if slayer isnt your peiority dont buy it
---
‚ÄúUnintelligible‚Äù yeah that word doesn‚Äôt apply here bud
---
damn
---
HA value of 60,003
---
You don't need java to run the OSRS client
---
Buy bitcoin
---
Ye saying this content sucks is the same as tryna act tough. Only thing that‚Äôs thicc is how dense u r
---
O
---
Nobody gives a shit poor kid try not being trash next time
---
Haven't played OSRS in years but getting back in the game... just read the wiki about this fight the other day
---
My 70atk / 70str / 70def / 76mage / 53 range main isn't ready for this fight yet lol
---
That's what did it for me, after I did my 1 action I'd hold my cursor over the other prayer and focus on if he was doing the opposing animation.
---
Lucky! I just did 10 of my first runs today and came up dry
---
I'm not sure what you're struggling to say but peace be with you, my friend. Bathe in the light on Saradomin.
---
What
---

Very, I got 6 magic seeds in 1 crate and a total of 12 Yew seeds, about 2k farm xp, also got a bunch of 9 ranarrs out of one witch is now 180 4 dose ppots

Love this
---
Does that include generating cash, buying/selling materials, doing the necessary quests etc?
---
Yes, the shaking hands...

Like what? And if you think me posting about /r/Charlotte in /r/drama me being a nazi...the bait is working.
---
Click pixel make me happy
---
Protip: With Eye of the Artisan, and Xerics Wisdom and 99 FMing you should be getting around 400k FMing exp PER KILL if the math is correct. 49.5k bonus exp if you get enough for a crate at 99 with just the 5x rate. Then you double it with artisan. The you double it again with wisdom for nearly 200k exp. And the amount of exp you get during the kill depends on your speed but if you just do 750 points average you should match it. Meaning that in the same amount of kills that it would take to get 99 FMing in the main game, you can get 200M Firemaking in Twisted League.
---
Well you can choose, thieving xp or a bunch of herbs
---
4th club replying
---
I'm not entirely sure.
---
Just keep shaking trees so birds nests will fall out of the tree at lightning speed. Teak seed in no time.
---
Every +4 Str bonus is a guaranteed max hit, so a berserker ring provides that (2max hits imbued). 
---
At 1 attack, warrior ring may be better though but I‚Äôm not sure and cba to calc it
---
Yeah you‚Äôre probably right. After thinking about it more.
---
With the quest being out for as long as it has I seriously doubt noones had this issue before. She's somewhere dude. Probably at the camp right next to the boss fight because I'm pretty sure she was helping during the quest
---
it would say x3 instead of 3 separate x1
---
Well said, lovely perspective on life.
---
God damn the memes are so good already
---
If we get a green icon can we get a random grey pixel on it
---
Ive placed since late 2001, i used tip.it and zybez. didnt even know there was a paper guide
---
The +4 str only applies at 99 str fully potted lol. Its not a linear curve either. At 1 str, idk what it is but its like really high, like 50. Tho hes potted up so like 30 maybe
---
I always did the opposite. I camp pray mage because I feel like his range animation takes longer so as soon as I seen his feet stomp I switch to range then immediately back to mage
---
You'll hate it when you'll want to afk Barb fish
---
No one actually gives a fuck about the fact you can't cook on a fire clearly made as a cosmetic, it's just a meme.
---
Im on my 10th try and i still cant do it. Those healers always get me
---
Eggs, first of all, what's up dude. Second of all, it's nice to still see you around. C:
---
Isn't it instanced? I've been entering and leaving a few times and I get an instance with five open patches.
---
Who‚Äôs oda and how many bills is he in the hole
---
You're on about 5 government watch lists kid, 
---
You honestly give off weirdo pedo vibes.  
---
If you can make me feel this uncomfortable through a computer screen, God help people who unfortunately know you in real life.
---
You‚Äôre dumb
---
I'm having fun with how different the game is. I would 100% be playing even if there were no rewards tied to leagues.
---
Those ain't secrets, few bother with price arbitration.
---
Fun fact never knew kid was meant for people who are 34. Yes I am on 5 government watch lists because I downloaded a chrome add on to delete comments and play games to the full potential.
---
Meh they‚Äôre 50/50. Either you get them or you don‚Äôt.
---
How many solo though?
---
it's okay the sword fell off, fondant sucks
---
Did this just shatter your whole view of 3rd party clients? Runelite is Jagex approved btw.
---
well to be honest i think most people who buy these accounts (and gp) are self entitled douches that don't feel it is necessary to contribute a fair effort into the game to get the results. there is no innocent noobs just stumbling upon rwt because they aren't good at the game yet.
---
ROFLMFAO!!!!!!!
---
It's instanced, I'm not sure how it works exactly but if you just hop world's a couple times or leave the room and reenter you'll find space. I did tithe a few times today throughout the day and never spent more than 30 seconds finding an open instance
---
Sorry you spend your time on trying to bring others down
---
Well i for one think that it's fair that everyone who buys an account deserves to lose it. "don't support this massive scam" LOL! How about play stupid games win stupid prizes. It isn't a scam, it's black market dummy, you get what you pay for.
---
what are our feelings on swamp pk man?
---
You unlock up to tier 5 as you earn points by doing stuff. Can only choose 1 from each tier

This is great idea, should be asked at the official Q&amp;A
---
I used sound for my first cape, and you have loads of time after his mage sound, but barely any time after the range sound.
---
Assuming ppl prioritize a cosplay over a buch of millions.
---
No most don't.
---
This is skill not luck
---
How about we add PvP to majority of the areas of the map and a fog that kills as it closes in towards the end of the event? 
---
Wait...
---
That‚Äôs weird af than. Jamflox fix
---
they made a permanent deadman, so i dont see why they wouldnt make a perm twisted league. maybe they might wait a season to polish it, but im sure it'll come
---
Tbow is all you need
---
you are my savior, thank you!!
---
Ely is, like ranger boots, one of the few SoV assets in the game because forgeability costs are not attractive even if the prices jump 20% over current prices.
---
Corp is still below 2'5m/h at 850m ely
---
Med clues are still below 1.5m/h at 35m boots
---
No. 
---
It has been solidly rising for over a year now. Look at any long term graph for it's price history.
---
Hmmm... perhaps
---
Bots don't get banned but my hc with 3 hrs of gameplay which I've never botted on does
---
Remove wildy and free trade too, freedom is awful I hate it. Remove all skills except rc too as the others seem a little problematic to me
---
No stats unless its offered in the area.  Why give everyone bis cape for grinding wintertodt that they basically have to grind anyway.
---
99 rc already, time to quit or go for 200m as the pet grind was completed at 82
---
Wait so ur getting 15 xp from a big bone when using it on an altar? lmfao
---
A good variety is what's fun!
---
To make for some interesting combos?
---
Yup, that's definitely what I'm saying should happen. Because I don't like the people spewing nazi propaganda it means I want *all* of the bad things to happen. I'm just a sjw feminazi on a rampage coming to emasculate gamers.
---
Watch yo dicks cause I'm comin' for 'em.
---
Sure, I'm with you on that. There's so many options for relics depending on what kind of league we'll get which is something that gets me very exited at least.
---
Ok that made me chuckle
---
I like to think the broken sword adds character to it. Like a sword is used to slay things so it's going to get damaged.
---
Literally the most boring thing ever, nobody would play. And I'm legit serious.
---
they already have the seed vault, they could almost reuse the whole thing but with potions.
---
the potion icon in banks is a QOL feature but a simple new right click option is i hope not a huge task that may breaks somethings and make the falador ducks aggressive
---
Yes you do.
---
who cars
---
He‚Äôs on about the animation
---
No you do not.
---
yeah its been real fun. its nice they put it on zeah because a lot of people have no idea where everything is so its just like being new again. defs captured my attention to give the game a decent play instead of afking stuff in the background while i do other things on normal osrs
---
there was same suggestion with monkey, the reply was the monkey has to get all 99s first
---
Weird persecution complex bro
---
In RuneLite under "World Hopper" you can check mark the "Display current ping" option and it'll get on ya screen for you, and tyty.
---
No. Definitely.
---
If you need higher than +3 youll have to use a spicey stew max boost is +5 unless doing construction which is a +5 but the crystal saw allows you to +3 on top
---
Omg, thank you
---
I agree, it‚Äôs like starting in Lumbridge again. No idea where everything is apart from like Wintertodt and other stuff. But stuff like where do I fish first? Where do I mine first? Had to figure that stuff out and what to do next.
---
I've had a double tome box before
---
But those crates cant roll uniques.
---
Pretty sad its never gonna get released

Just let the plebs think they found a pro strat, you'll never convince them healing the pyros is a waste of time.
---
3hrs later and the prices are balanced
---
correction, you have no time after the range sound.
---
the ranged sound indicates when the damage is already calculated and if you don't have your prayer up you're getting hit. for example, this is useful in no pray fcapes, because you can tick eat every time you hear the ranged sound with no worries, whereas for the magic attack you need the visual cue of the fireball being shot at you.

---
I dont get how it could be hard to implement
---
Where is the guy that does the math on the drop rate for this to happen?
---
If you have unlimited run it‚Äôs not that bad and effectively speeds up your artisan skills, but if barbarian fishing was on your to do list it‚Äôll probably be a pain in the ass

They should bring it backüòî
---
what for? you're on drop rate for everything lol
---
Still hoping that it comes back one day!
---
if you can only trade other players then a final goal isn't as important imo. the interactions would be enough to carry the series
---
good thing i didnt say that.
---
OP: why is ely "skyrocketing" - a subjective term
---
me: there is a price rise directly correlating to the introduction of bh v.2 which brought in a lot of gp.
---
Lol no, it's the people supporting this who are being ridiculous.
---
They lack the ability to socially engage other actual players in game chat and CC's, so without saying "ty, np" to trade bots and Zybez scammers, they have a void that needs filling for social interaction. Since players are no longer forced to do this, they lose their social interaction, and now they want to force everyone back into the old playstyle so they can once again interact with some yellow text.
---
Or, they actually think trading other players was legitimately a challenge that other people couldn't figure out rather than a waste of time, and think that right clicking and trading a merch bot requires talent. This would go along with thinking that a wilderness ditch is a major issue in the game, despite it being something that doesn't even matter.

LEGGO 4TH TIME BOIS
---
i like the basis of the idea but doubling the drop rate could have some nasty effects. perhaps add in a pvp world special boss drop unique for all bosses that gives you access to some pvp world-only bossing uniques?
---
Yeah people always try to do multiple actions between one Jad hit. Just do one prayer flick, then one additional action, then wait for one more prayer flick, then the next, etc.
---
by staking ofc
---
don't worry and just keep grinding barrows kc, you'll get them eventually
---
+4 prayer bonus tho
---
Is this when HD mode was relased in like 2009? Edit. I just saw that the NPC man was greeting the player.  I clearly remember this to.

Like the Rare Drop Table?
---
Interesting read I‚Äôve never heard of that lol
---
DO NOT GOOGLE "USS LIBERTY"
---
You're the first person here to suggest a reward for trading rather than a punishment for the GE.
---
It seems like people aren't satisfied with a GE change unless it's actively ripping something from other players' hands.

is your hp full lol

It's not moba it's arts rrreeeeee

I think you‚Äôre underestimating how many people would make SW prods.  Was extremely popular back then for that reason and would be now.

Sure there‚Äôs other methods right now to make profs, but they‚Äôre a lot slower compared to what SW would do.

missing out on the easy points for base stats lul

&gt; Just because people want something doesnt mean its good for the game. This should be obvious to anyone with common sense.

Kinda disturbing tbh

I bet he let you put it in his bum after that.

The grind is real. I recently started again and I‚Äôm missing my Abby whip. Only another 20 attack levels.....
---

---
Ya, but the drop rate is so low to begin with.
---
How brave, posting this as "humor".
---
not asking for clans to be deleted but like, if you are going to do something like this shops should be instanced, and if they arent players taking part in these things should get a short suspension to let others have a chance of getting what they need, a 24 hour suspension if you get mass reported and its confirmed you are talking in cc coordinating buying things out isnt impossible, though the simple solution is just to make shops in leagues be locked to the player
---
Depends if you are in the hotspot, if you are you get their current tier also

I did most of my 99 fishing at the fishing guild.

I say do both tho! Barb for that good exp, guild for nice afk or if you want to chit chat with people. Most guys at the guild go to the same worlds every time so you can make friends.

If you are an iron and do fishing guild then you also get food to cook!

South coast near sand crabs and furnace seems to the the hotspot for them. 8 and no lockpick yet :/

hard and elite cluews can be completed even at early game without overheads, a small pool of steps, most just challenge questions. Lots of common gear thats got a good alch value like rune, dhide, dragon weapons from elites  
---
masters have only like 5 possible steps on zeah, as long as u have like base 50s and overheads for the ancient trio, easy to do early on.
---
Woox is more of a nerd than zezima

Oh that's really useful to know! I didn't know anyone else who picked it so was unaware

Nice I got mine at 57 while 10 marks from full grace.  I‚Äôve seen a lot of people get this pet around lvl 50-60.  Supposed to be one of the longest skill pet grinds but idk.  Got it in canifis too which is terrible odds.  Where you get yours?

gotta +1 that item incase he kills you bro
---
Firemake yourself
---
Exactly what I was thinking
---
Ironic.
---
Then I'm uncertain what could be causing it. I'll try to tag some jmods in the leagues discord to help bring it to attention
---
GUH
---
Just a nicety to show what skills people have dedicated to in a restricted area. It doesn‚Äôt go against ‚Äúthe entire idea‚Äù else we wouldn‚Äôt have pestle and mortars, anti fire shields or barbarian fishing rods - obviously those things are pretty major but the point is things can be added for enhancement.
---
Oh my bad! Yeah that would be cool to see but I know that most of the design mods are on the main projects for the slepe quest and the other boss thing coming out
---
Great suggestions, i'll be sure to vote when i have the time!
---
But... could it be possible to make the rune pouches have the "empty" option once they're filled be in the left click? I am aware that all you have to do is shift-click to have the option but it sometimes can get a little tedious and can led to missclick if you don't like to focus 100% when doing RC, specially with the little delay you have once you craft the runes at the altar.
---
I don't think this is anything groundbreaking, just a little QoL update to make RC training a little bit less... annoying.
---
You gotta let it go. The fun is in the temporal nature of it and what you can accomplish in the time given to you. Just like real life :D
---
You‚Äôre a fucking loser.
---
I'm glad it's not just me, there's nothing more irritating when you go through 2 whole phases hitting constant 0s then seeing the ruby bolt spec damage right as the damn undead chicken freezes you
---
I swear this game just wants me to stay broke
---
[deleted]
---
I'm not sure :/
---
It depends on how they do it. There could be a league with the full map or without ironman but other unique mechanics and challenges. But I doubt we'll just get a full map league will full exp rates and a bunch of strong relics without any catches.
---
It's too fun, I got work that I should be doing...
---
oh well I guess I'll continue playing with the looming threat of exams around the corner lol
---
Total nub here, which runes are worth holding onto? Are any way more expensive than the rest?
---
is this even fucking english
---
Finally! People praise it so much but I never liked the HD update. The textures looked so fake yet everyone loved it
---
By making everything about efficiency
---
They never said that.
---
The fact that they're not loans, if you give a friend/family member $2000 dollars with no legally binding agreement that it is in fact a loan. They have no obligation to pay you back just like with oda's debt.

Seek actual help perhaps? Try talking to a school counselor or see if your parents would get you a therapist.
---
The moment *of truth*
---
No idea. I'd just not log in again at that point.
---
What makes you say that? The bank limit isn‚Äôt a case of doing some work and adding more space. It wouldn‚Äôt be hard for them at all to raise the cap, it‚Äôs capable of being a few hundred more but the system tends to fail with the large calculations when many banks of 1000 items are accessed at the same time. To save people not losing items if it fails they have to keep it to a safe limit to where it won‚Äôt ever run into that issue. Mod Ash explained it on a q and a but I can‚Äôt remember which one exactly. 
---
If the bank space really is an issue then sure, but even on my iron man I‚Äôve never had any space issues just by managing what I do and don‚Äôt need anymore often and not keeping items that are just worth too little xp to bother.

3rd party clients honestly destroyed the game that we once loved. Dont get me wrong I still players every day but it was a simpler time when we thought the battle axes were good weapons:)

I woox walk but not max efficiency since i'm a scaredy cat still. I might take a few extra steps to make sure im in a safe spot and i wont fuck up, or timing wise, so probably 3/4 hits per fireball phase

U ok?
---
&gt; man a scythe would be such a bad combat weapon
---
  Because it is. An inwardly curved and heavy blade on the end of a long polearm is a pretty impractical weapon. Scythes saw a lot of use in battle throughout history, but mainly as a peasant weapon since conscripted peasants would just bring whatever farming equipment looked sharp with them into battle and not because they were actually any good for fighting with. Honestly if you were considering carrying a scythe into battle you'd be better off just taking the blade off and sharpening the end of the pole into a spear.
---
Yeah go imbue your ring and get your range up and then you‚Äôre solid
---
Whats a lower value reward than this? A coif is 3 coins and i know that because this is fake
---
Imagine having harvester with that too and end up with 11 torches
---
No, do oak til 60wc buy rune axe then do willow
---
Plz let me know if you make this a thing
---
It seems like you get this message whenever your loot is worth only 1 coin. Ive seen many posts about people only getting the Cowl, but its always been at 2 coins thus they didn't get this message i think. I got Vambraces right after this one and they were worth only 3 coins, but i didn't get this message.
---
If you go to your worn items screen, there‚Äôs a little money bag button that you can click and then it will show you the price of items that you have. Bloods, natures, and laws are generally the most expensive I believe.
---
Nah actually sounds like a jagex problem. Customers can‚Äôt access their accounts due to something as common as a phone change.

Why would you be allowed to transfer random specific items?

My best friend on rs was Dutch. Walked me through dragon slayer. Will never forget. Roughly 10+years ago
---
i know that the person with the zgs is an experienced player and he would close the rocks on me if i tried to run straight over them, so i had to time my zammy hasta special to stun him and give me enough time to blow the rocks and run over, then using the ladder to reset the barrage and run away to safety. i find these games the most fun sometimes, because we are the 'underdogs' going against the better team and it's a good challenge. world 334 if you want to play!
---
Is there some way to get a zamorak hasta on zeah in the league?
---
How could you ever be on board with that train? His W was very controversial, he shot for that takedown against Masvidal like an amateur and every time he took Damien down he was threatened with multiple submission attempts

i was curious what the ironman value for this clue was- 1,335 coins.

I would be ecstatic if I could go back to that time just before nex. Was my favorite time to play rs.

This is a list of awesome ideas. There is however one thing that irks me: The use of "=" in [this](https://i.imgur.com/6BKj18e.png) interface. I know it is nitpicky, but an item is not literally equal to its cost. Simply writing "for" or "cost(s)" would in my opinion be more suitable. I often help with teaching mathematics, and one of the most common issues among people who struggle with algebra in particular is the misconception that the equality sign means some sort of exchange. In fact, it means literal equality, ie. there is no difference between what's on the left and right sides of the sign.

Does immunity to ROT also cover DDOS?

40 players piling stun effects on you is skillless and braindead no matter what group it is, so "can't be frozen" is just an upgrade.
---
I'm dont have a single stat higher then you lol
---
Hopefully Jagex realizes how much publicity stuff like this is getting and gives up trying to champion PVP around. Maybe then they might stop trying to force through objectively trash PVP updates and focus more on stuff like this that's actually fun for a significantly greater number of players.
---
No it's because they just ddos the server and nobody can click
---
:joy:
---
Most people on reddit don't know how to raid so they don't understand that solo raiding is actually pretty easy with Endless Endurance. That being said, it's still a pretty big milestone in the League, especially considering the progress Woox had to do to prepare raids and the huge supply drain it takes.

Man, that‚Äôs gonna be such a treat.... I went 256 kills on Rex before I got my first d axe (still no b ring though :( )

Possibly a scam?

Wait when did they add snare?

You mean why are there silverware in the pancake drawer? WUTHUH
---
Thank you
---
A big part of it is cause it's woox, best pvmer ever and just kinda cool to see him do it time and time again. Also he solo raided with pretty trash stats and completely trash gear, which ain't easy.
---
I bonded my alt just to get the rewards for my main as I assume they‚Äôll be quite expensive.
---
After the first two days I really don‚Äôt care about rewards I love the mode just for fun. Plus it‚Äôs easy to grind RC on the main at the same time.
---
Excited for future leagues for sure
---
Immune to rot wouldnt work as they'd change clans to by pass it.
---
Exactly I went to areas I‚Äôve never been before just to unlock them
---
The way she goes
---
I love them, they just train around and say choochoo

If you mean gear, then probably get venge and try void/ballista dragon thrown axe range pking. Easy enough to learn and a very strong combo if you can pull it off.

Prayer completely negates damage!

\&gt;like I care what people on reddit think.  
---
It seems like you do care, otherwise you wouldn't have posted this to begin with. You clearly wanted Reddit to make fun of him.  
---
\&gt;how serious people get on here  
---
That may be because you wanted to put that player down by shaming him here.
---
That‚Äôs a very good 60 attack void build. Get full void range, glory, avas, rune boots or snakeskin boots, a rune kiteshield or arma book and dragon knives, if you have DS2 done use a heavy ballista, if not the light ballista or dbow is a good option.
---
Chuck knives at them until they have low hp then use a dbow or ballista switch and spec. Switch back if you fail, repeat. If you run out of spec the dbow or ballista regular hits are still good.
---
Might be worth learning how to use the dbow or ballista into dragon thrownaxes, or the dragon throwing knife specs into a ballista hit. Basic combos make for impressive kills.
---
You could also void hybrid and go range into dds, gmaul or whatever. Or main void melee with a dragon scimitar, though your ko potential would be kinda limited to claws, dds, or a ranged switch.
---
If you don‚Äôt have ds2, get that done. It‚Äôs worth it for the heavy ballista. If you don‚Äôt have void elite then work towards that.
---
If you want to just do a lower risk but less successful style of fighting then try out the extension of F2p PvP, msb imbued into d2h smack. Just like maple shortbow r2h pures in f2p. Very easy to learn, though you‚Äôll probably die a lot it can be a lot of fun. You will want to always risk the d2h, that‚Äôs how you will find a lot of fights like that, they‚Äôre only like 120k I think. I‚Äôve seen both zerkers and pures that do those fights often.
---
As far as I‚Äôve seen, the bounty hunter update was really very fun for a lot of people (except for that whole 1b /hr farm thing)
---
Already has
---
I dont know what twisted leagues is, but since woox did something it's probably impressive
---
Woox attempting solo raids in league?  I think you mean league raid attempting to solo woox...
---
Agree on that, I was thinking about giving him a lance or a spear, or even a flail but for some reason I went with the scythe lol.
---
You can get them quickly by cannoning goblins in lumbridge

Alch it coward.

Fucking seriously my children and i read reddit threads together and when we come accross a sinful, profane, dare I say heinous comment like his i start to question whether the internet is really a safe place
---
The true legend
---
The game mode called twisted league. Region locked with boosted Xp for two months with tiered sets of challenges with rewards unlocked at each level. It‚Äôs special because he geared up for, and trained for a solo raid starting Thursday without leaving Zeah.
---
Hey there, it looks like you're a little dumb for asking a question with an obvious answer. Clearly this guys favorite number is 76 (which is apparent because you can tell he owns a motorcycle) and that's why he has 1:16 in his flair. Only a *complete moron* would guess it's related to runescape, and there's absolutely no direct link to sea shanty 2 whatsoever
---
Shit looks ugly .. but that's just me i guess.
---
Just when full bike my woox?

This raid is done during a special game mode called Twisted League, where players are restricted to Zeah only as iron men. This mode runs for two months. Exp is gained at a rate of 5x and performing tasks in the game gives you points. Points will unlock a tier of relics from which you can choose one to help make your gameplay better in a specific way, with relics such as unlimited run, customizable slayer tasks and faster attacks. 
---
Woox was the first to earn the highest tier relics yesterday. Today he solo‚Äôd a raid with very basic stats and gear. The game mode has only run for 5 days.
---
The slowest suicide is dying of old age.

I should set up some low buy offers

Not just 6 jads at the same time, he also did it without looking at the game. Had his screen blacked out.

I do pk at rune rocks btw

So excited for this chaos rune drops

I think he was trying to sell it for 100.5m

Switch from addy to rune after wave 60. I'm paranoid , so I bring 100. Never used more than 30.

But if it really be like that its 40

Awp‚Äôs toolbags are actually really tough, just thought I‚Äôd let you know. Mine has lasted for 7 years since I bought it, and just now I am starting to think about a new one. (Finish carpenter btw)

That happened to me once the other day on TL.

damnit I got Vorki at KC 42 why couldn't I have gotten that instead!!!

Is there a delay on prayer flicks? The sound is delayed, but I don‚Äôt know if I need to plan for the delay of the song or if I can flick on and off right before I hit.

This is some anime level teamwork
---
That‚Äôs the most ridiculous take on the subject I‚Äôve ever heard. Outside of novelty (i.e. swampman), pking videos on YouTube provide the most publicity for runescape.... by FAR. This mode has been out for less than a week, so of course current activity is high. Like the other guy said, there needs to be both equal amounts of PvP, PvM, and PvE updates. They‚Äôre equally as important to the health of the game long-term. PvM updates only help in the short term, since people master them so quickly. PvP provides actual end-game content, as it allows you to expend what you‚Äôve learned through runescape to have fun and master the hardest obstacle: killing other players.
---
he can't use a screenshot cuz he's got that curved monitor, it would look all wrong! /s
---
You're one special human being.
---
There isn't too many things to remember so you don't really need a guide up while you're doing it. Just watch some videos on it then give it a try, you'll get it down pretty quickly (at least the prep stage). The boss is quite difficult though. Just aim to get a tier 1 armour set and t3 weapons

Maybe you should try opening your eyes https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Logava_Gricoller%27s_Cooking_Supplies

That's just a shitty aspect in a lot of big twitch channels.

It‚Äôs easy if he stomps then pray range you get a split second to switch prayer. If he stands on his back legs with his front legs in the air protect mage
---
I don‚Äôt use sounds
---
Reduce the fucking store stock times!!!! Shit is ridiculous, there's literally thousands of people playing and 10 instances of the gear shops! I just want a fucking mith scimmy or adamant sword without having to hop to every single world and  then still having to end up waiting 20 min to try to snipe a restock, so fucking annoying.
---
More =/= better
---
Just pretend he stole that extremely rare scythe from that castle and is carrying his loot like that lol.
---
Couldn't have been anyone else
---
once you hit 60? favour in arceus, you can talk to the mage next to the dark altar to swap to the arceus spellbook, which gives different teles and lets you reanimate ensouled heads for prayer xp
---
&gt;jagex please fix your shit
---
What can they do? Just disable an authenticer? He needs to take it off his old phone. It's the simplest solution.

lmfaooo got his ass

What pvp related changes would make it more viable in pvp?
---
But we are not askimg this of Jagex, we are asking this of the content development team, the people specifically hired to develop content

I think brutal black dragons are probably the best of those options.

I can agree with this

Ooo you‚Äôre mad lmao

No one is acknowleding the fact that you got matched with another dude on tinder....
---
And with flowers
---
Blowpipe gives me stress. I can't stop thinking about the cost of using it and the short range makes it harder to deal with healers. If you can't do it with an rcb a blowpipe will only allow you to get faster to jad, but it wont help you with jad.
---
And in game in Runescape as well sadly...
---
I HIGHLY DOUBT that potential new players are being drawn in by any pvp videos or streamers. Just think about it. . . if you have no idea what this game is or you played 10 years ago, what is interesting at all about a PK vid? You don't even know whats going on or care because pk looks dull af when you aren't aware of what goes into it. Im sure some people fit that description but not nearly as much as those who tune in for new content, achievements, pvm content creators etc. . . 
---
All the PK content creators just have recurrent viewers who more than likely pk themselves. His "ridiculous take" is way more valid than yours.
---
Do you get to keep the relics outside of the mode?
---
I will never understand how someone can be so good at a game. Blows my mind. I can‚Äôt even get one Fire cape.

Damn you are actually dumb as fuck lol
---
I think I've also had issues with this. 
---
I did a bit of mess hall for my Hosi favor and didn't complete a single task for it. And I know that I turned in a fair amount of stew and meat pies.
---
Wait at least until I finally finish off inferno before that nerf lol.
---
I've been dashing myself against the healers unsuccessfully for a while now. I keep either misclicking out of the shield or just running out of supplies so that either the healers or the final set kills me.
---
BP nerf would make T-bow-less inferno *extremely* difficult for people getting their first cape though. While BP did makes caves a joke, its basically what makes first-cape inferno doable without tbow.
---
I could definitely get behind making BP require 90 range though. It wouldn't really fix anything but would help a bit.
---
I think they had this in the game at some point, I don't know if it was RS3 or late RS2
---
Hey I feel ya man
---
You can still make that into a pretty solid 75atk zerk tbh
---
Obviously he read it moron? like why respond with just a pointless comment.. he knows the positive of the relic he is just saying since he turned it on why cant he turn it off. DONT BOTHER IF ITS UNHELPFUL

Eh, I think you're overplaying it. My first attempt I used karils cbow and made it to jad in 1.5 hours. Every attempt after that I used a blow pipe and made it to jad in \~1 hour (for each of the 6 more attempts it took me), but a large part of that increased time was that I went extra slow on the first go to get used to spawns and how to approach each wave. I think I would have still killed jad in 7 attempts because even after attempts with a blow pipe I felt pretty drained and waited a day or two to try again.
---
4 i think

I think because it wouldn‚Äôt pass a poll otherwise

Just have to keep whatever is being alched noted!

Does he really? That's dope!

I think he may workout and it‚Äôs from the stretching of the skin I have them on my biceps from high school when I used to workout all the time for football.

Sorry, never realized it was a game mechanic to set up box traps faster by continually trying to train herblore. How silly of me.
---
Are you aware of the Wise Old Man‚Äôs function to remove useless quest items?
---
Not a bad time for first run
---
No, he is saying that they are safe spaces for toxic people. In normal life, toxic people get called out for the asshole behavior. But in certain places on internet, those toxic people are not called out by decent people (hence they are safe spaces for toxicity) and so they act like assholes with impunity

Thought I was unlucky with 6/26

ok, ty

thanks for answering :D

Looks so good. Olds cool style, but looks clean af
---
Tick manipulation works because the developers chose to reuse timers on a lot of different actions. Two actions that share the same timer are making herb tar, and fishing. Because you makes the herb tar you are now on a 3 tick timer, but you are catching a fish using that timer. The result of tick manipulation was probably unintended, but it only works because the game is working as intended. The developers chose, and continue to choose to use the current timer system.
---
Hard to believe
---
Mod Ash: " The toggle you described is indeed beyond the team's current scope - but the team's bigger than it was even a year ago, and I imagine it'll be bigger again in future, so things we can't undertake now might become possible." While not entirely confirmed, it's also definitely not dismissed. And he basically just said other updates have higher priority at the moment.
---
I don't see much of an issue with this. For one, the difficulty of skills can be quite different in leagues than in the main game; I'd say FM and RC are much more comparable than some of the other skills (e.g. Agility and Herblore). It also depends on which relics you picked; FM is way faster if pick Artisan but other skills may rival it closer if you pick Gatherer or Fighter.
---
So while they did tier some tasks based on how hard they are to do instead of their requirements, for skills I think it does work to keep them all in the same tiers for the same levels. Not every task of a tier is meant to be perfectly equal and you will always find some tasks way easier than others. For example, steal from a Gem Stall which needs 75 Thieving is way easier than obtaining 99 Thieving, yet they are the same tier.
---
I think it is fine for some tasks to be a bit easier than others in their tier and, as seen with the Master Tier, some tasks are there not because you're supposed to complete them but to reward players if they happen to achieve them. A similar situation can apply to skills where it may be better points to go for the easier skills, but if you are going a RC route, you will still get rewarded, even if it might not be as high of a reward as the effort you put in might justify.
---
Woox said on stream that he regrets taking endurance though.
---
Yea I remember Lumbridge
---
Jfc
---
It can detect twitch streams
---
Lord forgive me for what I'm bout to do
---
This is osrs reddit we're talking about, they don't really get that concept.
---
Imagine actually having ppl message u on discord. üò≠üò≠
---
Is it really killing the game though? They run the economy and they're the reason a lot of bulk items are cheap. It does have a bad image for newcomers but it's not like they prevent you from killing bosses or gather resources.
---
Inb4 fine print - only applicable to new accounts less than 8 minutes old.
---
It's fun but it needs better rewards to justify playing it alot.
---
It's been 4 days and someone already has over 6k. Realistically if you aren't iron and have the ability to make 2m+ p/h in the main game you're better off spending your time money making and buying the rewards you want post league instead of investing time on an account that will be wiped in 2 months.
---
Also 2 months is way too long. Two weeks would have been better.
---
With that hairline I can see why he is good at a computer game
---
Hardstyle! Now hopefully Woox will attend the next Qlimax or Defqon for some quality raving!
---
Is there a link explaining the twisted league? I don't fully understand it, just know that I restart trying to do tasks. Does it help me in any way after the two months end?
---
And do I need a membership to play on the servers?
---
yea youre right, its just my type of humour. twitch community especially osrs has a long history with this type of shit, alot didnt change since then. i can totally understand why alot of people hate it aswell
---
It completes with the highest buy offer not the lowest
---
I've enjoyed it so far, its far less tedious than actual osrs so things like runecrafting, fishing, mining etc are so much faster it doesn't bother me to grind them.
---
it surpassed them because I thought it was going to be meh.
---
the only things is change would be everyone starts with 20% favour, because there is only one house worth choosing off the bat, which is pisc.
---
if also like to see a very hard late game unlock that gives you all relics so you're effectively a god, our choices should matter untill were atleast maxed
---
one more thing is I think pets you earn should transfer, or atleast a twisted version or a me them buyable with points for the main game
---
He means offer
---
LOOOOOL
---
Not fully 1st person though
---
The best part is how they just ignore you. I got hijacked and banned for macroing, and they have never sent a response because I sent a ban appeal when I woke up and noticed it.  I got them to tweet at me because they thought I didnt hear back from my ban appeal. They sent a link just saying to wait longer. I tweeted back that that wasn't what I asked, and they just ignored it, along with six other tweets on two accounts. What a great company.
---
Why didn't you just say that in the first place instead of wasting peoples time...
---
I\`m with you, I prefer the current graphics and animations, all it needs for me is better Anti-aliasing which is provided by already by third party clients

Garden pie dude.

I'm pleased to be hear that I've helped broaden your horizon on the particular subject. I'm hoping you will absorb the information from the video I've linked as I went to great lengths to assure that you hear the neutral opinion of somebody who never played the game. Thanks and a good day to you too.
---
50% in the sense that you get 2 game modes for the price of 1.
---
ahh thanks
---
Also offered to trim their farm
---
Toxic ironmen smfh
---
I wouldn't go that far. This isn't much different to a super long, super inefficient solo. It's definitely impressive as a whole (managing time on a macro level to get there first), but I don't think it's that crazy compared to stuff like his first inferno clear.
---
HAHA FUNNY NUMBER
---
You need to position your screen to where when you right click your build or remove box borders the edge of the screen. This makes it where every time you right click it will already be on top of build or remove. Look up a YouTube vid on making oak doors if this is confusing haha

It may be 14 days. Will have to check on that

The wiki has a guide for Twisted League, that might be useful for you.

Start an adventure into the great, vast unknown. The gate north of Falador will now be unlocked, and there's word around Varrock that King Roald is seeking an adventurer's hand in saving a priest on the River Salve. If neither of those options appeal, you could also venture to a warmer locale.  Southeast of the Al Kharidian palace, Shantay will now be more inclined to let you through his desert pass. For the right price, that is.
---
The most important thing is to do the things you enjoy. OSRS is a game about personal goals and finding the determination to complete them. Some of us enjoy skilling, some of us enjoy slaying (monsters and players alike!). Some of us rejoice with company, others find solace in the rewards of the solo grind. 
---
So when you press confirm, you will have many roads before you. The sheer number of possibilities can be daunting. However, with a pinch of perseverance and curiosity as your guide, a new adventure lies on your horizons, waiting to explored.
