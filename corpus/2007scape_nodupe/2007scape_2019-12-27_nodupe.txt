Ive done around 2000 zulrah, 800 cerb, 500 DKs, 600 hydras, etc etc on my iPad (actually catching minnows in splitscreen while im typing this comment). Sure, you might lose a tick here or there because of a misclick, but two big advantages are 1) having two hands is awesome: can use one to move,one to use the menu: this helps a lot for zulrah and cerb for example, in their aoe attacks that pop up while you also really wanna eat or switch prayer; and 2) being able to do it anywhere, with anything in splitscreen. I take a train to/from work, where i nearly always watch youtube/netflix while playing RS; its nice for on the couch/in bed, etc. Would definitely recommend trying it out with an open mind if you have a tablet.

Sooka (Cyka) means bitch, byoolot is how they say fuck I think
---
If its in runelite, its allowed. Runelite has entirely complied with jagex law, per jagex.
---
Boooooo
---
I'm guessing its other people like me who quit because of the game changes and are coming back when they find out they can basically get the og game experience again plus some new content

The idea behind boss pets is to show an achievement of earning a pet right? All six of the brothers do not even wear shoes, let alone boots lol.. the relevance isn‚Äôt there. Barrows pet idea has been tossed around so much.. the best response from this sub was a chest that followed you
---
I've been trying to get Jad as a task for ages now. 30+ tasks skipped and completed yet no Jad task...
---
Only if they got 8.25s
---
Thank you and the entire team for the fantastic content, looks like 2020 will be just as great, and u/JagexSween thank you especially‚Äî you get too much hate but a few of us genuinely appreciate all your work and candor
---
Wilcum to de swump
---
Knife and hammer are classic items of the game. This is a slippery slope towards toolbelts.
---
&gt; people love it because it's fun
---

---
A bit disingenuous because to a lot of the community, fun just means they don't have to interact with the game. It's really obvious when you check the high scores and all the top skills are just the fastest, most AFKable skills, with combat skills at the top because most people care more about PvM.
---
They continue to update it based off what the community wants, add the players voting for what comes into the game it‚Äôs extremely player friendly
---
Correct, but xzact was showing off an actual way to tick eat melee attacks earlier which allows 0xp meleer kills.
---
can you please do everyone a favor and delete this before the front page is flooded with pun posts for a week
---
You‚Äôd get duplicate sire pieces
---
There's a 50/50 chance to get barrows gloves from barrows if you talk to Oziach.
---
Pretty sure if they can get level 4 then they can get level 3 now. This is crazy stuff.
---
That‚Äôs very exciting. Does he stream?
---
&gt; The truth that no one‚Äôll admit is that PvM has gotten out of hand and drop tables need drastic roll backs to 2007 era
---
A lot of players admit this, even the JMods admitted this, it was either Wolf or Ayiza I think who were pretty clear on Q&amp;As that they think that they overbuffed PvM droptables when they did the Slayer buffs back before I even started playing.
---
Those lemon stealing whores
---
Why the fuck do people get so worked up about what random strangers equip their fantasy game avatar with? I never once have given the slightest shit about what player around me were wearing.
---
Feedback welcome :)
---
Lol, bots can 100% perform tick perfect actions. With ease. It's not even a sweat.
---
Fuck.
---
Got'me.

Question about high alching when hunting chins. During the reset box trap animation, after you pick up the box trap, your able to perform a high alch without disrupting the rest of the reset. So it'll go &gt;reset box trap &gt;it gets picked up &gt; then you can high alch &gt; and then it gets set back up during the high alch animation. Curious if this is a bug, hoping it's intended because it's easier then waiting until after you do the reset animation to alch which is what I've been doing out of fear it is a bug.
---
meow
---
I know i'm going to get so much heat in this thread, but I need the advice lol. I've tried nothing and i'm all out of ideas!!
---
Second this, always kill of the melee hand first
---
Worth?
---
Not if you alch battlestaffs, and you can also buy them in great numbers. Plus people make them while leveling up their crafting skill.
---
Eh the shirt is definitely a slimmer fit but may still be comfortable depending on the material.. those pants on the other hand look damn near skin-tight and there's no way they're comfortable
---
I feel like pushing the blame for RC being boring to PvM is really stupid.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Saying the game around it, pointing mainly at PvM as the issue, is stupid because it's also not the same game or community from all those years ago. Back in the day, seeing someone with a 99 cape was a big deal you'd see dozens of people following someone with the 99 cooking cape all saying, "mote plox" people would stand around a lot and just have fun talking to people doing their own thing, people would spend weeks doing whatever skills to afford a rune set.
---
For skilling to be enjoyed again it needs to actually be made enjoyable. People do bloods at 77 because it's AFK and the want/need the levels for something, not because of the profit or the XP. Few people actually ENJOY the process of doing RC and those people do more profitable runes and the people who care about EHP do things such as lava runes. Just about every instance of skilling is the same where people are not doing the activity because they LIKE the activity they like the results.
---
Hell you can even look at RS3 if you wanted to, supposedly from a post on the RS3 reddit, Natures can be about 10m+ an hour and a comment in that thread says mud runes are 20m+/hr. The only PvM that really beats that as far as I can recall is high end PvM as in the bosses where you need a team that makes few if any mistakes OR a solo boss where if you fuck up just about at all you are likely going to die and lose millions on repairs and such. I've told multiple people that I know who play RS3 about these methods and even though they aren't into that end game PvM they don't want to jump onto doing RC for these pretty high gp/hr rates.
---
To make a long story short, you could butcher PvM's drops as hard as you could ever want. It will NOT solve the issue of people disliking certain skills. You could make the only source of runes come from RC making it better GP/hr then any PvM and sure a lot of people would do it, but that does NOT mean people would like it. At the end of the day the community has simply grown past mundane tasks. A lot of people do things for the results, not for the activity. When the activity sucks, the activity sucks. You could make double natures 10m gp/hr but it wouldn't be any more fun it would just be much more rewarding.
---
Nooooo but this has been my excuse for putting off magical winterboi
---
na i meant because if my name xD i read thru after my smoke and try to give tips
---
It was, but he was saying it was 2-2.5m an hr, which it never was until summoning.
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt it, there are 3rd party apps for many games
---
Respect the MS Paint, nicely done.
---
Now that I have it, yes lok
---
When he stands up straight he's 7'4" so he posts up wide and low as to not intimidate others üò§üôè
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just us, but I love those posts. The fact that there are still people experiencing older content for the first time and feeling the sense of accomplishment we had years ago makes me smile.
---
I was going through the same thing, I started my jar grind for the first time this weekend, on and off it took me around 9 attempts until I got it today. 
---
The healers kept getting me too, and what I did today was just take one healer on at a time (while prayer switching) the remaining ones got him back to full health and I just kept taking one out at a time until none were left. Then I focused on him. It takes time, just don‚Äôt panic, even when I finished I was shaking still. But it takes time, don‚Äôt give up or get frustrated. It is hard, it is a game, don‚Äôt let it get to you too much, take breaks and go in with a positive attitude and you‚Äôll get it eventually. Best of luck dude, let me know if you have anymore questions and  if course let me know when you get it! 
---
GL!
---
Sweet man I appriciate it, didn't notice the name lmao
---
Can‚Äôt watch the vod. They found a way to recoil 180s without them healing?
---
He is also extremely toxic on league of legends
---
Where do you get chaos Druid robes? The lighter shade red ones? Not looking for elder chaos Druid robes
---
Fr. I got my fire cape a few months ago for the first time ever and shit was crazy. I was so happy for ages about it cus it made me finally not feel like a noob anymore. There‚Äôs no need to shit on people‚Äôs accomplishments in the game just because you‚Äôve already done it.
---
just tag healers while watching jad one by one, dont try to tag hide tag hide. Just tag 1 by 1 each healers while watching jad. If thats too much, you can have jad attack, pray against it, then tag 1 and then wait a couple more seconds before his next attack, itll give you soem time to reassemble.
---
&gt; small improvements on the experience
---
How would doubling or tripling xp gains be a "small improvement?" More importantly, making RC training faster would mean that more people would be willing to do it, meaning rune prices will tank. And most importantly (for the sweaty neckbeards that play the game), you're invalidating the grinding that people did before this change. The change will never be implemented, the best thing you can hope for is a runecrafting minigame that's less painful to play than the actual skill, like Wintertodt is for firemaking.
---
Going on a three hour car trip tomorrow to visit my grandparents, was planning on playing some mobile on the trip. How much data would it take up to play for a couple hours?
---
I‚Äôm not hating on them. I still remember my joy at getting my first fire cape. It‚Äôs just funny how the posts always sound exactly the same.
---
That should be the actual maximum networth a person can have
---
This method isn't new, rendi has been doing it in lower the better for a  long time. He just hasn't used it in fight caves.
---
F
---
I had two really good friends on here, we would do gwd, corp, dungeoneering, etc. together for hours. One of them owns a coffee shop and is married, we still skill from time to time. The other one overdosed on medication a few years ago and died. 
---
Time is a weird thing...
---
[removed]
---
Thanks for the advice my dude! So you kill the healers then? Don't they respawn if Jad is at full HP? Maybe Ill leave the last one just in case!
---
Thats how i got into it. i always saw the videos on youtube and when my xbox broke i started playing myself and haven't stoped yet.
---
Nah i get you, and yeah they do all sound the same. The whole experience is just dope when you haven‚Äôt done it before, getting so mad when you die 6 times at Jad, dying on the healers, and then finally getting it. I think it‚Äôs one of the things in game that‚Äôs a major milestone and it‚Äôs cool to see when people get there :)
---
Why play like that at only 1600ish total? Like I get playing really safe if you‚Äôre like 2.1k and just wanna max first, but 1600 seems low.
---
For sure, that sounds great. RSN: Anxiea
---
If you are rich, i.e. you have a main or RWT, then you just alch either battlestaffs or onyx bolts for break even or small profit. But if you're poor I guess you just alch dstone bolt tips or gold necklaces or something like that and even then you're hardly losing much per alch.
---
I 100% agree that skilling needs an update. Yeah, I like killing stuff and it‚Äôs fun, and good drops are great, and I think that PvM and bossing should still be viable ways to make money, but skilling should be equally as viable.
---
You can swap your blowpipe to longrange, or bow switch idea is fine. Just make sure to focus on your prayer switches, and once you have all 4 tagged, run in a line so it becomes OXXXX with only one beside you attacking you. Easy tank. NOTE THAT JAD HEAL ANIMATION WILL CONTINUE WHILE TAGGED, despite Jad not actually being healed.
---
I thought they would have, But they didn‚Äôt respawn for me. I might have left one there haha, I was so nervous, but even with the last one he shouldn‚Äôt be able to heal faster then your damage. Oh yeah, keep the blowpipe!! Use rapid too
---
wow look at the neckbeards on these guys! they definitely play runescape! probably ironmen...
---
The best way I've found to deal with crashers is to just have everyone leave and 1 person follow him.  Duoing already takes a huge amount of supplies so making him solo while taking full damage + splash damage that is targeted at me damage him even more.
---
Idk about guys doing 0 stats corp tho.
---
That's because it wasn't possible to use on the 180's in fight caves because they out heal the recoil damage, but xzact was showing a method to bypass that today.
---
&gt; obby legs are almost not even worth the +1 str over the def you lose
---
except that def bonuses are almost completely irrelevant in low/med lvl pvm
---
yeah, besides somebody who transfers from rs3 to osrs could probably see ooh they have dwarven army axe here, im gonna get it before i start train cooking. For those who don't know, rs3 version adds 3 exp to multiple low tier skilling when the axe is wielded or at inventory, such as cutting normal trees, burning logs and oaks,adding bronze/iron arrowtips 
---
but the most game breaking thing that this gives is: +3 exp in cooking to anything except **cheese***.* 
---
I have no idea why it doesn't work on cheese, but it works on everything that you can cook. shrimps? yes, sharks? yes, wines? yes.
---
Are tbows worth 705mil now?
---
True and there are those that are good at digital art, but not so much Traditional.
---
Good bot.
---
you forgot the Adidas full tracksuit.
---
The question unasked is why is PvM the only real choice? You used to be able to make enough money for whatever literally AFK mining pure essence and the gathering skills weren't all just there for 99s. PvM is the only viable content because it hasn't been botted to death. This is the same reason Slayer was the gigantic moneymaker in late RS2: It was harder to bot.
---
I hate these fucking posts and they should just be deleted on site. Report the player and chuck them on ignore. It‚Äôs the internet and people are shitty.
---
Implying there's anything to fix in the first place.
---
Just saying if menu stalling is the problem, it can be done without it.
---
I got the same shirt from my brother, but it black. Wear it with pride, king
---
That‚Äôs why I said I quit my main, I meant that I never get the urge to play my main these days and just play Ironman when I get the urge
---
What were you doing on the main?
---
I thought Netflix hadn't turned a profit since 2009... Are those numbers just bullshit?
---
They also created an environment where you started to feel the weight of having set tasks you had to do every day/week. It became overwhelming.
---
Well these drop table methods were implemented to counter the bots. Jagex would rather have legit players flooding the market than bots
---
*Laughs in ranarr*
---
Agility at seers
---
Dude, you're on runelite which has a built in screenshot feature
---
5-10MB
---
15-30 not 30 guaranteed no?
---
I wonder how may people there are with 67 rc, 85 prayer,
---
Divine PvM once you reach max combats, 123+ 1750 total req as well as some specific gear reqs
---
30 is guaranteed if you‚Äôre the one that started the vein out.
---
You did the clue involving gnome ball didn‚Äôt you? You also teleported from there vs exiting via the game. The game had it registered as you still holding a gnome ball.
---
Ah battle staffs were a net loss back when I got mage. Forgot the Eco is in the gutter now
---
Oh I'd love to see more risk as well. But they offer a system that can better handle disconnects and bad servers, we should at least be in favor of that.
---
OMG YES. Thank you so much! It was driving me nuts.
---
No
---
looks like he touches kids tbh
---
What is more cost efficient for range training,
---
cannoning on task or chinning (reds probably)?
---
Memes aside, isn‚Äôt that something Kemp was talking about when first working on his 19cb one?
---
Which relics are you using?
---
A lot of the skills don't improve over the years because the hardcore neckbeards elitists grinded through it and don't want others to get 99. So they reject any improvements that will make the skill easier to train, even if ut makes complete sense.
---
And Stoli instead of Smirfnoff
---
Far behind from other accounts? The whole point is they stand alone, doesn't matter what anyone else is up to. Would reccomend ironman, I think it's a lot of fun.
---
Yeah I think I'm gonna end up finishing at the rune trophy. Currently at 10090 points
---
Funny enough... I managed to flip the Chaps u see in the screen. I gave up on the Ward... sold it for a 30k loss and the twisted bow now has an updated price in hopes of a slip up lmao..  unfortunately i got depressed thought Id have better luck buying a krak tent, whip and hitting the sand casino but... i got jipped for 1.6m by an eater... go figure.
---
damn i get jelous looking at those drops meanwhile i got to kill jellies with problems :( 
---
happy about nurse thing tho! üëçüòÄ
---
Yes because one ironmen is all ironmen...
---
Adorable. Farm guild redwood is best redwood.
---
They should pay their fair share of taxes now lol
---
I was just curious I haven't done corp of ToB. Ba is the only place I've seen it used.
---
Multiple runes for more exp should have been thing at the first place. Even if like only +50% more xp from multiple runes and scaling down after that.
---
because designing the actual merch is a lot more work than just the concept art.
---
they will have to  go through merch ideas, design the good ones, get test items made, get them back revise and repeat, etc. 
---
then they will have to do deal with support / complaints if people get bad quality merch etc 
---
after they deal with all that lets say they sell 1,000 hoodies at 50$ each, thats probably only going to get them 10,000$ after merch company takes their cut, then they have to pay tax on that, pay atleast 1-2 employees who were working on the merch project, etc
---
they might make a tiny bit, but its not enough to justify the work even if it is 'low hanging fruit'
---
Mole was here
---
Those are rookie numbers man
---
I remember being new to msn messenger back in the day and a friend always saying ‚Äúwhat up sk8er‚Äù and ‚Äúcya l8er‚Äù I could never figure out what he meant by 18er until I realized it was an L and not a 1

Flexing a dragon trophy could he pretty dope tho

best way is probably finding people playing the game in f2p, at least you know they're not just trying to get the money
---
Meth is bad ok.
---
Just doing the hive minds bidding I see.
---
I assume I‚Äôm missing something obvious but, can someone explain to me how this is possible without overheads, won‚Äôt you just get one shot by any monster that can hit 10 or higher ?
---
I dont want dailys on osrs and I'd prefer if they removed dailies from diaries.
---
I used the same soundfont as OSRS did when the pieces were written, and I tried to imitate the style, form, and musical language of the classic soundtrack.

I ranged wyrms for about 2k kills then blocked them, would reccomend.
---
Run, escape, get yourself away from this game!
---

---
That was my RuneScape song growing up, it‚Äôs simple but wise.
---
Imagine the hat not being straight lines, yikes lol
---
Only if I get to torture your anus.
---
I would recommend a regular account. There is some fun to be had as an ironman, but it's mostly drudgery and spending hundreds of hours on mundane stuff you can just skip on a regular account without much effort. Ironmen sound fun in theory and look entertaining when you're watching them on youtube, but when you actually have to play one yourself, you quickly realize how painful it is.
---
Not sure what you mean about being behind other accounts. You're never going to seriously compete with the top players in this game if you're starting now, and if you can't devote 15 hours a day to it. There are too many people playing RS as a job basically, and who actually know perfectly what to do and have the option to play it all the time. I'd suggest forgetting about being competitive completely because it's just not a factor at this point. 
---
Think what you will enjoy the most instead, but yeah, IMO go for the regular account.
---
Fire cape no inventory.

The Chinese make great cheap android devices. Many of which have 4-6 gigs of ram, and a semi recent snapdragon (700 or so) usually for like 200 bucks less. Though honestly if you have a decent phone you can just use usb c to a external tablet screen and usually your phone is has better performance then the average tablet for you would spend 300 bucks on by a long shot. I wouldn't advise on buying a tablet, but a decent phone with the ability to cast out via hdmi, or usb c, wifi, whatever. Saves you some money, and it's essentially the same thing. That way you don't have to buy a new tablet, and a new phone every year. If all you want is larger screen space there are options to help fix that.  
---
The thing with tablets to me is it's more of an accessory. Phones are required in modern society, and we all kind of accepted that and moved on. Tablets don't necessarily have that much functionality for some of the crazy price points, you could buy a nice standard desktop for the same price and start toying around on blender for once or make some nice high quality memes on photoshop. Hell you could probably pick up streaming any game you wanted to. There is some utility to it, it acts as a potential investment with room to add on, or improve performance without having to throw out the whole thing once it becomes old.   
---
There are some cool tablets out there that act as computers, and if you are a enthusiast for the ARM scene anyways then by all means get the fun toys you want. But if you're someone just looking to spend money on a tablet only to play osrs I would maybe consider other options first. Like if you have android 10 use the desktop mode with your monitor, and use a bluetooth mouse.
---
Wheres my 8.5 gang at
---
To be honest, that's my least favorite part of playing an ironman. Non slayer things are just so shit compared to slayer things, and I know I personally didn't make a BTW just to be a walking collection log.
---
he probably goes to school too and then spend his whole free time playing
---
it does when i do it, maybe its beacuse i have sharex installed, but i dont actually open the program anymore
---
I want to get a blow pipe, and then  DWH and finally do raids!
---
Some people are just toxic I guess
---
Nice drop tho and congrats on getting that number ;) Hope it works out for you! :)
---
fr though, lvl 112 and just got it a few days ago after like 6 tries over the span of a year
---
&gt; You don't actually have to kill abyssal demons to obtain a whip unless you have restricted yourself to doing so. That item is tradeable.

So are runes. Now shut up.

i have over 50m rc exp....

Be careful there‚Äôs a bunch of dumb cunts out there

I bought full prospectors, did the diary task, then sold back the top and bottom to buy the 2nd floor. No regrets. The 2nd floor is way more afk

Single handedly insuring you never get a date
---
It isn't really for competent companies
---
Which is funny considering you can buy bonds and nobody blinks an eye, but sell money back and your the devil. Never understood that logic tbh.
---
I actually never liked the combat in Runescape that much even back when I played from 2004 -&gt; 2007. Most of my time was spent chopping magic trees or fishing at the fishing guild. The parts of the game I enjoyed were talking to people while doing AFK skills. Something else that isn't even close to possible now since no one talks in public chat anymore.
---
&gt; rigid anchor systems break way more shit than they help.
---
Yes yes. If we had rigid anchor systems we would all be playing non-eoc RS2. So I guess rigid anchor systems are bad.
---
Do people really still hate Kemp because he RWT‚Äôd? I feel like it‚Äôs more of people just hating other things about him not because of that.
---
I've spoken with many of the big streamers on Twitch about 2XP and all have said they would quit immediately. I believe them as three of them play simply because there isn't currently mass MTX.

&gt; Why does it matter if an already casual skill becomes more casual?
---
Is this a real question? If u do that, it becomes diluted. Where is max cape at now? Diluted. 5 digit people almost have it. It doesnt say anything, it doesnt mean anything. Its only a functional item for pvmers, not a symbolic item.

For what exactly?

Mass mtx? Idk what that means man please inform me?

P.S they wouldn‚Äôt quit lolol. They say that but they wouldn‚Äôt.

It would be beneficial in a lot of aspects, runescape 3 does double xp sometimes.
---
Nty. I can‚Äôt stand dailyscape and I don‚Äôt want it in OSRS
---
Seeing as this banned 5 of u/Antimen01 accounts, I really don't recommend it.
---
Hail to the iron fist, Comrade!
---
Yes!
---
Well done.  You have an awesome account.  I was on your stream when you did that fire cape.
---
but there literally is? it's not hard to program a bot to run the abyss for runes over and over again. a fresh account can do the miniquest and then flood the market with a ton of runes. it's far easier to program a bot to run the same route over and over than it is to get a bot to do all the things necessary to unlock vorkath and then fight him.
---
you say there is nothing harder ahout pvm in terms of botting, but then you bring up low vs high reqs. and i would argue that having good money makers locked behind high reqs is what makes it hard.

Single handedly IS his date.

It's because the minute you can extract money from the game instead of just put money into it, you open a huge market for bots.

I really hope this gets fixed, i really want to be able to play on my PC aswell.

I'm going to be straight up honest, reading this comment was a fucking challenge.  You might want to try typing in a way that other people can understand what you're saying.

You should rock some birdhouse runs. They're super easy and really good xp and you can do them with your farm runs if you want. And then once you get 80 herbiboar is pretty fun too

He was also super over-dramatic about the recent duping scandal, making it out to seem like he knew ages before anyone else (including Jagex) and despite his many attempts to contact Jagex that they ignored him for the most part. In reality they knew and were trying to keep a lid on it, and Rendi was out for drama and views.
---
Listen here you stupid, ugly motherfuckin idiot retards
---
Wooosh is a synonym for "that's the joke", as you know.
---
No one thinks they are doing comedy by saying wooosh, just like no one says "that's the joke" for the sake of comedy. 
---
People who have a problem with the term are the epitome of a Gumdrop. You all are a bunch of little tiny small penis'd crust cutters who fabricated an annoyance.
---
&gt; The fact that rendi says his videos were only 2 minutes long as if it took smokey no effort is plain disrespectful, and I'm glad settled called him out on that bs.
---
Yeah, I will concede that is kind of a shitty comment to make, but Rendi only said that after being baited by Settled. I don't begrudge Rendi a little gripping after his lose. However, I feel like it was shitty of Settled to taunt Rendi, given that he had just won and Rendi hadn't. Settled came across as a really poor loser.

honestly the ring of suffering strategy isn't really an exploit/bug, it's using the intended mechanic. that coupled with it being a niche use makes it unlikely IMO that they will 'fix' it.

\&gt;  Why should I have to kill abyssal demons to obtain a whip I dont wanna get to 85 slayer before I can kill them, make aby demons 10 slayer 
---
This is an argument against making slayer faster to level. The big problem with comparing it in any way to runecrafting is that slayer unlocks content, that is used in other gameplay. People level up slayer, a skill that is much slower than runecrafting, because it actually gives you a reason to level it up.
---
[https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Skill\_mastery](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Skill_mastery)  As of the 1st, there were 16k+ accounts with 99 Runecrafting, but 45k accounts with 99 slayer.
---
Slayer is a much more difficult skill to get to 99, yet it has almost triple the amount of capes. Why is this? Are people given more incentive to go for the slayer cape because it carries so much prestige? Or is it because slayer actually unlocks very important items, very profitable monsters, and actual legitimate content like MM2?
---
The problem isn't how easy it is to get 99 runecrafting (it's certainly faster than other skills like Slayer and Agility.) it's that it's fucking useless.
---
Used to lure bots there in 2013 when players still dropped their items on death for other players.

Poisoning lvl 180s requires you to hit.
---
I always get so defensive when they call it boring. Like just wait until you spent get those stats from grinding the same thing for weeks straight. Sounding like a straight psychopath
---
It really is unfortunately. And the builds I said are true. 50 atk no honor(everyone agrees this is the build to learn to NH), 75 atk ags prod stack 100+, or low prayer obby-60 atk.
---
Wait is this for really happening or is it just a meme?
---
Not wrong but I don‚Äôt like your tone lol
---
Damn no forlorn homestead. That's my personal fave. I'd be getting in my feelings in fally park to that
---
Part of the reason I loved Stealing Creation was because you could diversify the way you trained a skill without actually accelerating how fast you leveled it (while also, possibly, saving some money.)  For example - you might have made 50k xp an hour training a skill, or 25k bonus xp from a 30 minute round of SC (although I don't think they were that long), and then go train at a doubled 25k XP rate for the other 30 minutes.
---
Still 50k XP an hour, but now you got to convert half of that grind into Stealing Creation gameplay, which was very fun.
---
Further, for some skills, you'd save money because even though the xp rate stayed the same, you only had to use half as many resources.

How do you post memes? You cant post pictures in RS.

A meme is a picture with jokes on it. A meme isnt a new word for a joke.
---
Almost forgot that your skill levels in other skills effect the quality of your rewards. Someone should do this, but with 99 in all the skills that effect the rewards from todt and see how 50-99 from that compares
---
I think I might have
---
Yes
---
Love how i got downvoted for this and its currently being done lol
---
Yes new account
---
I know it would make solo/duo absurd because they're already absurd? Duo tob is literally meta right now, it's how I made most of my bank. If you reduce the bosses health by half for duo or solo you'll make them like 30+% faster which is just crazy talk. I don't see how you could possibly argue that it wouldn't be faster lol.
---
And I'm not sure why you're saying players won't bother doing it because they literally already do do it. In CoX it's the literal *best* way to do the content (solo), in ToB it's the second best only to duo.

Yebat means fuck, blyat means whore. Are you seriously trying to say blyat is a verb? Because that's what fuck is... Does blyat mean "to have sex"? Because that's what fuck means. It in no way means "fuck". It's blurted out similarly to how an english speaker would blurt out "fuck", but that's where the similarities end. And no, you're wrong about "yebat" not being used anymore. Quit bullshitting!

Yeah double nats were never 2m/h much less 2.5m. When rc released, theres no abyss, theres no pouches. Then later on pure ess cost 100gp and nats are still 300each. Nat gp/h is higher now than it ever was pre 2008.

I don't see why shooting star needs a unique reward. It would just be a mining activity; a lot of those just give exp and ores with no other rewards. As for the exp, it would be nice if it were competitive compared to other methods, like perhaps a bit below Volcanic Mine since it would be a fair bit easier and it would offer more rewards. Though if it were high exp I wouldn't expect it to be much more than say 400K or so per hour and that would be from multiple stars.

That's definitely saved me doing a task before

Though weird thing is, when I log into RS3 my stats were lvl 1-20... so it seems they were reset. Was there ever a time when they would reset my stats? However, looking at my bank I see 2 of each quest item (Blurite Sword, Silverlight, etc) which is something I did back then as a collector. I also do vaguely remember having to start over in RS3...  
---
Logging into OSRS with the account reveals that the botting happened there... apparently I was used as a fish bot at Karamja haha.

It depends. I don‚Äôt disagree with you for the most part...but wilderness content that effects exp rates (looking at you wildy altar) has a massive impact on players. So I mean it passed but saying that most don‚Äôt effect players isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Also rev weapons for pvmers who pet hunt. Rev caves for GP, but if you‚Äôre talking about like BH updates yeah those mostly don‚Äôt effect anyone but pvpers. Unfortunate people can‚Äôt just vote for what‚Äôs going to actually impact them and not simply spite vote or blindly vote without knowing how it affects the players who actually participate in said content. I wish there was a way to better balance polling especially for this. Like assume I‚Äôm not a Bh pker, theres no reason I should have any say in shit like target mechanics or something. Idc to be excluded. It‚Äôs not part of the game for me.

Gotta say my first try didn't work out so well, what equipment/inventory did you use? I don't care about time or points honestly but I tried to do it the other day and the first room seemed literally impossible since tekton would outheal any sort of damage I'd do to him 65att/85str/67def/95range/84magic obviously I need to work on stats and equipment still since Ihave no whip or dwh yet but It's kinda frustrating since that can be a matter of rng.
---
I can't even be fricked
---
Another problem with runes is that water runes use to be 25 gp each because so many people used them with ancients and shops were bought out, but instead of letting people runecraft them to normalize the price, in 2014 they released rune packs of 100 which means elemental runes will always be like 5gp each regardless of the demand.

95. That isn't a start up cost, that's a level requirement. By start up cost I mean the amount you need to spend on gear/supplies to do the method. For wrath runes you need an anti dragon shield, myths cape, teleports to a bank, a wrath tiara, staminas, and essence. If you have a 50k bank you can afford this stuff. If you try to do efficient raids with a 50k bank you aren't going to do very well. My point is that if I can make more crafting wrath runes or some other skilling method than doing efficient raids, there is no point in me buying raid gear. Instead, I should use that money to flip while I continue to do the skilling method for money.
---
You would spend less time getting 95 rc than you would maxing all your combat stats for efficient raids as well. Most people just choose to spend their time training combat skills instead.

I'd recommend going to the BH world with black dhide top bottom, msb and glory, and try to one bang looters
---
You can safespot them with a crossbow, as well as shortbows if you're really careful. Their attack range is 5 while crossbows/shortbows have a range of 6.
---
You want fun!? This is runescape.

There was a guy in full dragon at pest control and honestly I was a lil jealous. I mean I‚Äôm not gay but I wanted to kiss him? I dunno man

Well I'm 92 rc atm and next 99 will be rc so that's why I picked that
---
To address your second part. I started playing 3 weeks ago and the only skill I‚Äôve been working on is melee and slayer. Just got a cannon the other day and that‚Äôs where all my range has come from. How do people get their combat up if not for slayer?
---
saying people can function fine and then giving trump as an exampe, the dude is mentaly ill
---
eternal glory 2 hmm
---
Sure, I don‚Äôt disagree. However I think we should try to make skilling more entertaining, and even if we can‚Äôt, they doesn‚Äôt mean we need to go in this direction. If pvm is as fun as you say, why can‚Äôt that enjoyment be it‚Äôs own reward?
---
I said it in another comment but I think having to skill and do boring content to get the resources to then do fun content is a pretty good gameplay loop that‚Äôll make you value the fun content more.
---
Either way, they can still focus all their development on pvm and make it even funnier, just cut its profits to 2007 levels so that the other 80% of the game is playable and viable.
---
Also, I think that perhaps is there wasn‚Äôt such an efficient way of just getting everything and players needed to do a more wide variety of skills, they may be more open minded to do things that aren‚Äôt as efficient, like maybe mini games. I could be wrong, but I think that when it‚Äôs so easy to just do one aspect of the game because it‚Äôs the funnest and most rewarding, it‚Äôs hard to ever switch focuses.
---
Even that.. fishing without idle notifications is a pain.
---
sote he can just tick eat, At crab boss he can walk under before it attacks, not sure if thats how he does it, but thats one way to do it
---
Woah, it's almost like there is no lvl 3s called UndercoverQ (fun reference to KempQ's failure) at fire cave entrance unless he is attempting something
---
great just let kempq take the records and no one else
---
That wouldn‚Äôt address the fundamental problem, but yes reworking drop tables is definitely the fix here.
---
I think lms would work if jagex made official bots to fill in the gaps sometimes.
---
Definitely allowing smaller or private hosting would be a nice solution too.
---
It's be cool if it could be put into the clan wars system, maybe some sort of clan staking system to go along with it so you can have buy one, or some one hosts the winning chest and makes them play specific game modes/maps for the prize including castle wars, or that weird tzhar one you barely remember doing.
---
he wont do lvl 4 firecape stupid trying
---
You could still make money afking gathering, but if you want to afk and make money, pvm still offers the highest afk money makers in the game, easily 2-3x more profitable than skilling afk activities
---
I never used it I just tank healers and switch prayers, that's how I got it on my 7th attempt
---
Well, now I am:)
---
I remember someone arguing with me that "Cerb pools are much more devastating than GG pools since you cannot predict them" while I've been constantly dodging them with the technique you are showcasing.

I have no memory of any of these lmao. When were these added in RS3?

Well atleast you have this photo
---
But how do you get YouTube money by waiting to release content until you have done your best?
---
That's true. But it's also a system that makes it easier again. I wish they handled their underlying problem. Which is fixing their infrastructure, so random people can't just ddos a server for profit.
---
Agil can generate some money from marks of grace. Not insane amounts and it's still an aids skill ofc but the gp does add up for sure
---
There is a discord called ‚Äòwe do raids‚Äô. They help people to learn how raids work etc.
---
Who hurt you? Why do you have to be so rude to legitimate criticism.Also, you have to be kind of special to think that runecrafting is interesting and relevant skill 2019
---
Lol I guess people assumed sarcasm which is strange for reddit but I genuinely meant it's a shame
---
Feel ya pain.
---
That piece of information is quite important lol
---
There are legit people out there who think that 6 hours per day is a lot of time spent on playing. I remember back in school there was this teacher who kept shitting on me in front of the whole class for being bad at sports etc. and among other things, she kept saying that I probably play those PC games like 4 HOURS A DAY. You could hear the horror in her tone whenever she uttered the number, as if that's basically the whole time in the world.
---
Needless to say I never attempted to tell her the truth, but me and my mates who actually got me into RS back then always had a good laugh afterwards during the break. Of course I rarely played as little as 4 hours, because school usually ended at like 2 pm, and I went to sleep around Midnight, so do the math yourselves.
---
The CC is pure crew. I believe it is open to all. The majority of its members have 1 defense but not all. Very supportive and helpful group
---
I remember making gp lending out bgs and as back in the day. Felt like such a business man.
---
added, thank you!
---
I will join the clan chat as soon as I hit 150 lvl too! :)
---
Never. My goal is to get maxed pure 99 stats and hydra pet. Then I‚Äôll focus on getting better at pking and bossing/raids. The only skill I intentionally go higher than 99 is farming and hunter. I really enjoy how easy and profitable contracts and birdhouses are. Also I‚Äôd like the groot pet.
---
No u
---
COD Zombies!
---
I appreciate the comment. It is definitely a grind but having a job that allows me to do afk skills easily at the same time is the key. I do not prefer click intensive activities and will only do them in very short bursts. This game is addicting though haha.
---
The handle is lost in both cases.

You‚Äôre not a burden you look like a really decent dude who‚Äôs delved a bit too deep into decadence. This guy is right, you need to cut that shit out of your life before it‚Äôs too late.  100% should unsub from those subreddits. Maybe just concentrate purely on runescape? It‚Äôs a good substitute drug.

Saw your post about your pain condition. I have fibromyalgia, I know what that's like. Completely unrelated, I know. But ay for what it's worth, if I was going to fake a text then I would've at least spelled "game" right. Poor Connor; he literally has dyslexia. Anyway, have a good day.

Bad bots just run back to where they were.

Good bots just interact with them as intended.
---
It doesn't help.
---
They are commonly used in "Honor" pking builds. 13 prayer gives super human strength at the cost of less than 2 combat levels, and 31 prayer gives ultimate strength at the cost of under 4, as well as protect item.
---
Neither prayer level grants overheads so players often build accs with these levels as a form of novelty or challenge.
---
I did agility first because I hate it, best choice I‚Äôve made
---
Gz m8! 4k kc still no puppy..:c
---
Yes. It also takes 2 rounds of poisoning to kill. Even with that it's still quite a bit better to give up the 2 melee hits and get the 23 extra range hits this path gives
---
Don‚Äôt have enough money to or I would have done that in the first place mate. I‚Äôve scanned my PC with multiple AV‚Äôs, with no results of malicious software. Never clicked a phishing link. However I have checked haveibeenpwned &amp; apparently I have, from a 2013 data breach of the streaming software XSplit, so could it be this?

I think that's too Oldschool for osrs, I don't see it happening
---
yeah the lunar landing was one of the most incredible works on cgi in the 60's. lol.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm in the minority but to me PVM is the reason to play Runescape. All the skilling, questing, and other activities are just accessories to PVMing. I‚Äôm very happy that I can PVM to fund my account, rather than have to do mind numbing skilling to get to the actual content.
---
Gold is much less valuable in rs3, but the Invention skill is a pretty solid item sink and gold sink at the same time. It's quite ridiculous how expensive it can get, but that's exactly the point. Rs3's market is also way more inflated by the fact the game is way older than 07, and the fact that the game will never recover from certain infamous dupes and the botting era that plagued it between 09 and 12ish. Joon the King made a pretty interesting \[\[video\]\]( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH9JpI630zM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH9JpI630zM)) about it.
---
Blowpipe, trident of the swamp, fury/occult. Regen, elder chaos robes. Should be less than 20m to go with that setup.
---
You don't need anything expensive. I bought a ¬£270 laptop for chill use on the sofa and it runs it fine.
---
Rune cbow is real jad material, blowpipe stats make it so easy
---
only have 71 ranged :)

Oldschool.runescape.wiki
---
Use the quick guides
---
Depend son what weapons you have available. I only had rcb available for sote (melee dps too bad to use), so I flinched it form 7-11 tiles away, which acoids most the orbs form sote. And dd as normal. I take more damage than usual but that limits it to 2-3 brews. If I need to them I can tick eat the initial orb from 10+ tiles, or tick eat the ball (often preferable since dding gives me a tonne of orbs to tank too).
---
Crab room is pretty normal, I take a bit more damage int he waves and sometimes need to brew a  couple times, for the boss I flinch melee and tick eat magic/range attacks when they target me with potatoes. It's the only room where I rly need to tick eat.

I don't think there is, but I am not betting against Woox.

Not sure why no one commented but that‚Äôs not really a combo people do anymore.

Well done lad! First 99 is a major achievement.
---
I once had a stretch back in the day during summer vaycay where i was going for 99 fletching. I did 93-99 on yew longbows, stringing them (pre-eoc so i was typing in 14 for every transaction). 
---
I think one of the days i did 94-97 in 1 sitting. Started at 8 am and went until 3 am, only breaking for food. Oh, and i was doing that for 4 days straight.
---
Rookie numbers.
---
And those other games give no emphasis on paying attention to the details provided in this game. This game has a learning curve, it requires some dedication, and a bit of open-mindedness. Other games are just easy to learn, that doesn't mean this game is trash...
---
Lmao way to concede the point bub!
---
My HC RoL'ed from the Agility Pyramid because I forgot to log out
---
Strike while the iron is hot. Go do corp and got ely your first trip.
---
While not necessary, something with a dedicated GPU would be a good idea since Runelite's GPU plugin makes the game look a whole lot nicer. I haven't had any luck getting it working on "integrated" graphics.
---
yes, i have a disease. i have a problem with meth. anything else you'd like to point out that hasn't already degraded me more than i already degrade myself? people are so desperate to vilify addicts, like oops! humanity machine broke!!
---
WC definitely not the worst, used to be my highest skill back on rs2. There‚Äôs just something I hate about the fact that the fastest way to get xp is to drop all the items you‚Äôve just collected.
---
Because Ironmen have less access to raw gp and couldn't just drop 100m a death to reclaim their items.
---
Right I can‚Äôt play fortnite for an hour much less 6

but why

I noticed girls usually play male characters

People get defensive about a game they care a lot about. They know RWT is the sole reason for bot infestation.
---
Probably works by changing the numbers on the screen on your client, but not changing them on the RS servers, meaning they don't actually change.
---
Ah good to know, just tryin to think of ways to minimize levels gained
---

---
In my view, you are now really drawing an arbitrary distinction between what you like and what you dont like. Jagex put it back in, because they thought it was better for the players and for the game - if they were to remove prayer flicking, similar outrage would likely happen. 
---
With them putting it back in and as such explicating that they want the boss fight to be ‚Äòexploited‚Äô like this, combined with the fight - again, in my opinion, but also that of a bunch of other people - being fun and engaging, i really do not see the harm done. Additionally, this gives a proper use that isnt ‚Äòcheese the skill to 99‚Äô to chins, and causes more value for traoning non-combat skills (something often seen as an underdeveloped part of the game). 
---
But I guess our disagreement boils down to whether we like the fight. That‚Äôs a completely normal thing to disagree on - i just think the way you‚Äôre driving your view is a bit flawed.
---
I don't recall one involving Regedit, but there have been similar ideas with tools like "Cheat engine". Tools like this are "memory editors", meaning, they can search your computer's memory for a certain value and replace it with another value. If you find where in memory the game has stored, for example, how many coins you have in a stack in your inventory, you can change that number to another and the client will display it.
---
This doesn't actually give you more money because Runescape is a client and server game. Meaning, your client just sends commands to the Jagex-owned server which processes them and in turn tells your client what to display.
---
In other words, you can edit the client to say anything locally, but it has no affect on the actual state of the game on the game server./
---
Its fucking trash lmaooo
---
It costs 1 blood and 1 soul per charge and holds 1000 charges. Of course if he has inventory space dont use it, that wasnt the intention of the post, but merely a, your QOL can improve slighty with this device. At least 2 people benefitted from me bringing it up.

A joke? Can you explain this, or link the video. Heavily interested.

thank you kind sir

I really use to enjoy the vibe of people while doing evil trees.

definitely quite a bit easier, there's only one real mechanic which is the insta-death windup attack

same 0kc and no pet hopefully i get it soon tho been grinding hard

I would be so happy if deaths, bloods, chaos, and nats at least were much less frequent from monsters. It would make iron way more porning but rc could make some cash

Memes aside, how long WOULD it take to lvl rc 1 to 2 using the slowest method possible? The slowest method being rcing air runes 1 essence at a time using the furthest bank from the alter, while walking?

Few skills in rs3 changed to actual 120, herblore farm slayer
---
I think the problem is mainly that some people have already done the RC grind and so they'd be butthurt if the skill got a buff.
---
That being said there could be a compromise where multiple times crafted could give quite diminished experience like 1/4th that of the previous. It would be a minor buff but some improvements could be made.

Lmfao

This is pretty much what the max guild on RS3 is like.

Try rebooting and blowing on the cartridge.
---
Make sure it‚Äôs from runelite.net, pretty sure there was a similarly named bot client which is no good. I‚Äôm guessing early game will be more of a grind compared to rs3, but it won‚Äôt hold your hand as much or push MTX on you at every step.

Also, if you looking for an idea of content to prioritize. Read through the OzirisRS ironman guide. It doesn't have some of the newest content, but it will help you get a good idea on what content to prioritize. In a max efficiency format as well, if that matters to you.   
---
I've loosely followed it, and honestly getting 99 firemaking before diving into content (through Wintertodt) has helped set the foundation on my ironman for a good base on other skills.
---
Thanks for the breakdown, looks like it'll be worth it for the slayer exp to cannon then (depending on the monster) thank you
---
Eternal gem is useless. Just make 1k slayer rings. Lifetime supply, and you can alch the (1) for profit.
---
Haha loved it! Thanks for sharing!
---
What? I never said alching wasn't profitable. I've been saying it's not realistic. I forgot people enjoy wasting their time though. I don't understand the Reddit hive mind sometimes.
---
Piss off.
---
Yes I know who you‚Äôre talking about, that‚Äôs one of my leaders. Called recruiting, not looking to just inflating the cc. We‚Äôre trying to get people to actually join a clan. It‚Äôs not for everyone, I just say give it a shot.

Haha love the reference! She was a stray so.... üòâ

Her mouth is the anti poison. Her butt is the super anti poison.

Ex account hijacker here. To hack the common player, it's pretty easy to just launch a backdoor VPS transfer using SSH to hijack the session or spoof one. You don't even really need the password, just session authentication, which is actually much easier to get than the passwords. Still, though, the servers only store player passwords using salted hashes, which are honestly pretty easy to bypass if you have a program that can reverse them using Euler's totient function and some other stuff. These aren't hard to come by today if you know basic coding in Python, which everyone does. Additionally, the primary server (i.e. the "mainframe") acts as a puppet server after a simple WPA 3-way handshake with SQL attack strings.
---
I think the general consensus tends to be that Xzact is better at perfecting execution and woox is better at discovering mechanics. Usually.
---
What level did woox do it at
---
Yeah, you can. That's for inferno.
---
You‚Äôre fuckin shittin me mate
---
The boss is actually called General Graador. He is located in the God Wars Dungeon (not the wilderness version). You should be able to find a guide about what gear and items to bring on the wiki.
---
Yeah you can. I did all my fc attempts on task.
---
Clickbait
---
Then you have to recoil 20 damage on it which is no good
---
Yeah, one of my favorite money makers is killing ents in the wildy, and with the wilderness medium diary you get insane amounts of logs. It‚Äôs just yew prices have halved over the years, which is my favorite thing to chop when I don‚Äôt have a bond activated

Highly recommend.

U opened the crates with lvl 1 stats? Lmao

Yeah for sure not the worst, but it‚Äôs not as good as I remember, when I played years ago

Thank you my friend!

False. You can get a Tzhaar task as long as you have unlocked it with points from a Slayer Master. When you get the task you can choose to kill either normal Tzhaars or Jad, regardless of your Jad kc.

I just need to vent. Trying to be nice to a noob, just killing some wyrms for slayer and he asks for help. I‚Äôm half asleep and talking with my sick grandma at home for the holidays, don‚Äôt even pay any attention or really think and get tp‚Äôd to wild and lose 60 mil worth of gear, defender and fire cape. I know it‚Äôs my fault for not really looking at what I‚Äôm doing, but fuck man I was just trying to help a noob.

How
---
Yea it wanders the entire morytania area since tob release. No further known info
---
I am actually 12 already, but my mom had me tested and she says I'm extremely artistic
---
I‚Äôm coming close to 1k dry on a shard
---
farming 1 too clean bro but u need the herblore one too !!! or agility‚Ä¶. even construction would be cool
---
418 kc at Cerberus and have never seen a crystal drop before
---
What the fuck is going on? The drop rate is 1/128
---
A true power move right there.
---
The addition of bonds (which are in RS3 and in OSRS) is if u think ab out the stars alignment a contradictment to ur statement.
---
It makes sense if you don't think about it

much thanks. i went to the alley and the baker was gone, found the trap door.
---
All that time dedicated for nothing lmao but atleast woox can take a few tips from this vid so don‚Äôt feel discouraged
---
Just Google kob and Google woox. I'm pretty sure woox is much better known due to so many achievements over such a long time.
---

&gt; You clearly never played Classic.
---
Good one buttercup.
---
&gt; Oldschool is oldschool, but Classic in terms of gameplay, graphics, xp rates, everything, goes waaaay beyond that. And when we're talking about what the Gower Brothers intended, we are talking about Classic, not Oldschool.
---
Classic is intended to be "oldschool" it was their design. Lmao.

No my point was that any device you play on has a CPU. So you made it for me! Thanks
---
thank you kindly. this helped me finish the event.
---
Shiit i wish
---
Old 07 lmao
---
I'm with you. Though I'm in the (probably somewhat rare) boat of having over 10x as much smithing experience as mining.
---
Ore is cheap and I've done a ton of superheat metal to level my magic and a bunch of smithing for profit.
---
Learn English and come back to me and we can have a civilized conversation. I'm not in the business of translating broken language.
---
Statistics. You are the 3.8%.
---
Probably the most popular opinion I've seen here lmao
---
Fun? Debatable.
---
Hits my dopamine receptors when I see numbers go up? Hell yeah.
---
It's actually a random value between 0 and max hit.
---
sorry but i dont play this game 6 hours a day!
---
I forgot to turn on prayer at dharok üôÉ
---
I think i have it too
---
Why do people edit about downvoted? Just looks like whinging.
---
How far behind is normal void?
---
Tough choice. I‚Äôll hold them for you till you make the right decision. It‚Äôs what friends do.
---
I found the solution in another thread. there is a trapdoor south of the apothecary you can interact with and get a new shield.
---
Remember when woox did the no armor no weapon one prayer no food jad kill back in the day? Only woox can make woox look like a noob
---
Equipping mind shield is an animation stall, and if you click any locked prayer during an anim stall it will queue an interface to pop up after the stall ends, up to twice per stall. You can use this to tickeat melee because it delays damage; you normally can't tickeat melee because melee damage is instantaneous between when its calculated and when it's hit, so adding a tick of stalling damage makes it act like range/mage and therefore become tickeatable. The challenge with this method is that prayer si's will only queue if you have a prayer point and bats drain prayer, so he needs one ppot sip per meleer.
---
The forums are where most active clans advertise, check the oldschool clans section
---
If I am specifically looking for an elite clue scroll from barrows, should i go for 100% loot or stick to 75-80% like you are supposed to maximize gp?
---
At these proportions, KempQ would be offscreen
---
I saw it near the farming patch east of Canifis, it hella confused me
---
Correct, I enjoy grinding for pets when I'm not working on slayer or towards a particular goal. With a lot of bosses a spec weapon can come in handy. I just knocked out Fally hard diaries and a BGS would be pretty useful for my upcoming giant mole grind.
---
Reddit loves to shit on people who didn't understand something instead of helping them understand.
---
Did you see that?  His RNG just fucking flew out the window...
---
But when osrs was just rs there wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúp++‚Äù poison, there was poison and super poison.

After existential crisis 4 they all kinda feel the same

Now you can burst in style...

MrMole73, is that you?

That doesn't disregard the fact that –±–ª—è—Ç—å is used as fuck which is the whole argument here
---
If this gains enough participation ill be more than happy to do this regularly, minus the payouts from my personal wallet lol, i dont think i can sustain anything afyer this one
---
Ah, I see where things went wrong. You didn't use your wind strike spell.
---
Then the lvl 4 fire cape is just a matter of time now
---
a friend made this version https://youtu.be/QGtGn98stzk
---
Was not expecting a shloob reference on this sub lmao
---
If you look up the solo guides, you kinda of do a variation of that to make the game last longer, ending it at 13k points to finish with the max amount of points
---
Well I mean, the odds are probably smaller. Everything had to happen the exact way it happened in order for you to have been born when you were. Imagine if your mom sneezed and your dad didn't pipe up saying "bless you", you could still be oblivion.
---
This feature specifically is actually in the vanilla client, you have to configure shift click and set it to use
---
&gt;People underestimate the power of ~~nostalgia~~ addiction
---
Nice.
---
It was a toughie! 
---
Only have 71 range! Ancient armour, rune crossbow and broad bolts. 
---
My best armour was probably my barrows gloves
---
Weed good
---
50m is not high end gear
---
It happens to the best of us
---
Just killing hydra over and over like always lol
---
Aside from the continent of Zeah the early game is very similar to what would have been in the RS2 days.
---
If you are considering making an Ironman then I think Zeah would be your home for a while with Wintertodt (a Firemaking boss exclusive to OSRS) so you can get some start up resources and gp.
---
There hasn‚Äôt been good news since the government replaced all the birds with drones.
---
The clicking accuracy required for this is insane
---
Keep your head up King.
---
you have a point, but it's far harder to actually get the account to said boss. it's why i said vork was harder than zulrah. a zulrah ready account can be made in the span of a day or two, and then the script can be ran on it. a vorkath ready bot account would take far longer to make, and is much easier to spot because botters typically hit the bare minimum for stats and quest reqs. as such there are less vork bosses. compare that to a skilling bot which can be programmed to walk to a fishing spot and get to work.
---
i think we just aren't on the same page but ultimately agree with each other
---
There is also still a bad stereotype for the game too. Then there is having to spend hours of research just to even understand what is happening in even a basic way and minimal low-level and mid-level content doesn't help either.
---
That‚Äôs pretty damn good, more skill than myself. I had full Kharils rcb anguish pegs the whole works. Just lacked skill at the time. I feel like jad is one of those bosses that you can down one time, and get it down every time after. Anytime I get a jad task I can one shot the caves. But yeah man, congrats!
---
At that point your gear doesn't even matter. You're not going to struggle getting to jad, and if you panic you'll die either way.
---
Yeah maybe 547 quintillienths lmao
---
You shouldn't need to do anything but change prayer with that gear, you can out damage the healers. You could also try to overheal before the fight for a chance to survive a mistake.
---
largely a lot of people just use discord
---
Gz m8! 8k kc still no puppy..:c

Sounds like everyone I ask a question on a cc

I died 2 times to Marble Gargoyles before someone told me to avoid the range attacks lmao

How do you get league points from clues?
---
I love the people clowning about the 19cb Fire cape because it‚Äôs an insane amount of work that, while incredibly unique, was beaten by something that requires less time to do. 
---
I hope he pushes through with it, if only because the account would be interesting
---
Well, thats just sharing my emotions on the subject of good RNG
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Could you make a phone version?
---
Hitpoints
---
What monster are you killing where this really even matters
---
Yea me and my friend were duoing it and got crashed by the same guy in 4 different worlds. It‚Äôs so lame, I don‚Äôt even do Corp anymore because of it tbh.
---
Is it better to do this with a team than solo?
---
My HC died during tourist trap. I was dumb, can't deny. I started the quest at 10hp. I ran out of waterskins. I pulled the guards around the captain, thinking I could safe spot him by out of ranging him with magic. Animation starts playing, they tie me up and kidnap me (among other things) and drop me off in the desert. I spawn in to a level 40 something camel attacking me. I get two shot, one from desert heat, the other from the camel. Had no control, because I was stuck in the animation.
---
I'm dumb.
---
Lmfao. Please clap
---
I wonder if PK-ers collect spades as like, a trophy.
---
That‚Äôd be interesting.

Had this happen to me before, I have no idea how they got the current password. Not like they recovered the account. They knew the password which is very strange

Where do people usually locate their houses? What makes the most sense?

Either a mega bondlet or RWT‚Äôer

That seems like a fair cost for dying with a tbow, imo.

‚ÄúY‚Äôall flirting with death I be winking through the scope‚Äù - jay z, quoting woox.
---
I just did every single slayer task with a blowpipe or msb i when I wanted to save a bit of cash, used cannon as well on every task and safespotted npcs like bloodvelds in Nieves cave to hit them all with the cannon. 
---
Also chinned a bit on task at nechs and dust devils before getting too impatient and chinning some skeletal monkies on ape atoll. 99 range was my first one as well.
---
Woah is this a person of interest meme?
---
You can't say getting runners is a training method. I mean you can't be serious. 60k/hr for one of the most click intensive methods in the game is shit. Not to mention if you're gonna sit there and tell me runners are a viable training method you're full of shit. Training methods and exp should be balanced off of doing it alone, not counting on others to help you.
---
I got bank slapped a year ago. Didn‚Äôt lose nearly as much gp as you but did lose a blowpipe and some of stuff I worked hard for. Haven‚Äôt gone without an Authenticator since. I know it sucks balls man and can you one consider quitting. Just gotta bounce back man and take steps to prevent it happen again. There‚Äôs no love in these savage RS streets.
---
Hosidius is good for herb runs if you like that
---
Rimmington is convenient bc its next to the general store for that unnoting guy if you need to build something that requires a lot of materials you need to unnote
---
Some people put it in Relleka for Vorkath, I'm not sure why though, maybe they're too lazy to build the Lunar Island portal.
---
Are you questioning Woox because someone got a faster time in an RNG competition?
---
Ive been creating a baby pure to do gmauling because im brand new to pking. I went to the wildy for the first time with a gmaul and rune darts. I tried speccing without realizing that you need an ornate handle now to reduce spec cost to 50% on a gmaul... i panic'd and tried to eat because i left myself low during the spec attempt. I accidentally clicked on a super combat pot instead of a shark and died to a dragon scim
---
It's a niche application of an intended mechanic: if using a recoil on a suffering didn't reset charges, they'd need to make it so every recoil used on a suffering added 40 charges regardless of charges left on the recoil; this would let you get 79 charges out of a single ring by using 39 then putting it in a suffering to get another free 40. In order to avoid effectively giving recoils 79 charges each with the release of suffering, this was really the only other option; it's understandable knowing jagex that they didn't think to put a 75 hp req to load the ring.

Thanks for organizing this. I just became a member again yesterday and this will be so fun.

This is a dude

Same I wasn‚Äôt paying attention during the acid phase and thought he was done and just attacked him and got like 2 shotted

What is tick-eating and can pkers do it to stay alive forever?
---
My slayer is 91 I don't know if that makes it better or worse, I get a LOT of comments on my Ardy 3 cape...

Whys there a cleaning/hacking post every day? Is this the new meta

You‚Äôll get it in the next 60 KC
---
Are you fat shaming my block of text
---
What will change?
---
I'm assuming the number in the OP is just randomly chosen small number but if not - yeah this is very difficult to calculate because it depends on so many factors. 
---
Of the 8 billion alive today, 3 billion are impoverished, meaning they probably don't even have time or resources to chop some yews.
---
So just by selecting one random person alive today, there's almost a 40% chance that they wouldn't ever be able to access runescape within their lifetime, what a scary thought.
---
Can you make one for iPhone?

Can you explain how you

Know when to run from the Grrr, or are you just doing that for every hit? After the ghosts ofc

Yea I canceled my membership It's going to take me awhile to want to play again
---
And I thought getting a blue wizard hat (g) worth like 150k was a good reward from my first ever clue smh.
---
70m is literally nothing.
---
I have to do something to *his eyes*
---
&gt; 60k/hr for one of the most click intensive methods in the game is shit. 
---
Solo Lavas is not "one of the most click intensive methods".
---
&gt;Not to mention if you're gonna sit there and tell me runners are a viable training method you're full of shit
---
"I want this skill to be faster but I don't want to do the faster way!".  
---
What are you on about?
---
&gt;Training methods and exp should be balanced off of doing it alone, not counting on others to help you.
---
Exp rates should not go up just because you think it's "one of the most click intensive methods in the game".
---
Yes, they do. Many pkers keep item stacks especially of common items like dds, d boots, barrows sets, but most importantly is the spade stack
---
Haha jad scares me
---
Q
---
If you got 70m legit you would know how to protect it. 70m is still alot.
---
I died to a Zamorak wizard from a clue the other day.
---
So cool!
---
I love how woox wasnt even involved for most of the time and just eventually got tired of waiting for them and was like fuck ill do it myself
---
Okay but Twitter and forums isn't a legitimate means of support you're missing my point.   The price has consistently been raised and there has been little improvement to an actual support method besides forums and hoping you get noticed on a Tweet.
---
An $11 15+ year old game and there is nothing in place like a ticket system or phone support number.
---
Pic of his tablet, the madlaf
---
Saw a figure the other day that Torfinn removed 136bil (I think) from the game in a year, I like that.
---
Right but he was curious about the longest possible, even mentioning bringing one ess at a time. It's a hypothetical, not what is actually occuring/efficient.
---
Elitist
---
If 70m is nothing, then pm me your username and give me 20m. I‚Äôll put that shit to good use
---
I tried my best to held in my laughing while in game message tells ya to take a break

Honestly worth it

It all depends on how you do it. It can be profitable at level 1 if you want it to be.
---

---
Feel free to chat. I am f2p only, by the way.
---
Coupe of things first: 
---
-Another setting is hiding NPC attack options. 
---
-Also make sure you are on an appropriate server so there is no lag.
---
Okay. I had this issue early on also. The key is to make sure you get a successful knockout before pickpocketing.
---
My steps:
---
&gt; Press knockout.
---
&gt; Immediately tap the NPC again to get ready to pickpocket or knockout.
---
&gt; if a message pops up in the chat box straight away, then knockout again (it was unsuccessful).
---
&gt; if there is a delay in the chat box from when you press knockout to when you hit the NPC with the blackjack, then it was successful and you will see the NPC fall to the ground.
---
&gt; as soon as you hit the NPC on the head you need to press pickpocket.
---
&gt; just before your character goes down to do the first pickpocket, you need to press pickpocket again (this will result in a second pickpocket if done correctly, which can be seen through a second pickpocket xp drop).
---
&gt; after the second xp drop you can knockout again, making sure to keep an eye on the chat box to see if it failed or not.
---
Make sure to focus on pressing pickpocket on the tick before the bandit falls to the ground, otherwise you may be too slow for a second pickpocket. If you know you are too slow, just knockout and try again.
---
Getting a successful knockout can take anywhere from 0-5 tries, be patient.
---
Expect to be attacked multiple times still, you can never have a completely perfect blackjacking session.
---
Hope this helps,
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt be afraid to look up guides if you need help with quests.
---
Give them an attempt without guides though, they're pretty funny and pretty well written for the most part
---
Magic isnt only used for combat tho,which makes it more valuable over any other combat skill
---
Scan your pc with RogueKiller. Sounds like a RAT or they wouldn't have gotten through your pin. This happened to me once and I had to flash my bios and reformat my hard drives as none of my antivirus could pick up the malware.
---
Mining is the worst dude , but good shit haha
---
I still don't get why they changed that... I think the reason at the time was because all the (s) and such on items was confusing since it used to be Torn Page (s) for Saradomin and Dragon Dagger (s) for Super Poison. But the same update that changed (s) poison to (p++) also changed Torn Pages (s) to Saradomin Page... I mean I suppose (s) is still not as clear that it is an upgrade to (p) then (p++), but nothing else in RS tiers like that so it seems a bit odd.
---
Will hit level that sweet sweet 99 number soon.
---
i dont know why their support is bashed so constantly. there are two places they have very poor support: macro ban appeals where you were fully in control of your account, and instances where you get hacked.
---
for all other issues they do just fine.
---
Nah, I think hes just making up a story for the internet, thus it doesnt add up.
---
Lunar diplomacy and dream mentor, desert treasure
---
whoa! me too yesterday
---
Just buy it? U aint ironman anyway
---
He would redeem himself
---
nostalgia has nothing to do with it
---
I'm saying people said the same thing when he took hold of the current record before being beaten.
---
Yeahh, but i still like doing it.
---
lol
---
This is the kind of RNG post i wanna see, not little Timmy's ranger boots on his 7th medium clue
---
It's in the video it's true. That's how these thread work.
---
Hey man that‚Äôs your cup of tea! No shame in the game. I wish I could do it like you do.
---
He edited his comment later...
---
The forum support is usually more of pinned threads that link to places to appeal or such. And I am not sure if I'd say that an official support Twitter account can never be a legitimate means of support; it is just that the Jagex one is not very good.
---
Lol at the random ass reply to your comment.
---
Its not about the ease, its about the experience. Runecrafting is terrible xp compared to the effort and attention that you have to put into it. It just feels bad to train. No skill in Runescape actually takes "skill".
---
Lol doesn't matter it's not the same
---
If someone got it on drop rate they wouldn‚Äôt talk about it
---
not a single comment about it but the past part is the audible mouse clicks
---
92-99 honestly isn‚Äôt as bad as 1-92, because xp rates do go up with each level, it just isn‚Äôt as gratifying as watching levels fly by in the early game.
---
That's nice if you have the money but those 100k fees during DS2 hit my bank fairly hard. Had to sell my d pick to finish the quest
---
Oh true my bad
---
I bet you already max out on others skill. I just play for fun. Bring back old memories.
---
There are plenty of rpgs that don‚Äôt punish you for dying or punish you very little and are the opposite of lame.  Most modern ones, really.  Even the dark souls series only takes your liquid currency upon death (which if you‚Äôre playing correctly should be close to nothing).
---
If your video game resembles a video game, death should already be a setback due to lost progress through whatever activity you were doing.  If that‚Äôs not relevant, maybe focus on putting more game in your game than putting less fun into your game.
---
Okay but isn't being hacked a major instance on where customer support should be exemplary?  I mean that causes you to lose all your time investment.  
---
There support isn't bashed it's criticized because the game has consistently become more expensive with no plans or notice of an actual legitimate support feature.  Twitter is not customer suppprt.  I don't know why people are taking this personally.   There are many games around the same price that have dedicated support.  That shouldn't be a taboo issue to bring up.
---
Haven't there been numerous cases of streamers with bills who have no account security and get hacked?
---
Just because you know how to protect it doesn't mean you do. The game has a shit tonne of people playing, some of them are bound to either not know or not care about their account safety thinking "It'll never happen to me"
---
Agility is pretty chill, sure, but nowhere near as AFK as Bloods.
---
I just miss random events killing people
---
Yeah most of my skills are 99, except mining ofc. I know there is a lot of money to be made from it though.
---
How can you hate enchant, it's so fast. I think I got enough enchant pts for boots and all wands in like 45 minutes. Tele theater is absolute cancer, takes like 5-10x longer at least
---
Who cares tbh
---
I spent 1.1mil on galvek attempts during DS2 to be fair. Once you learn vork you're making it back pretty quick though
---
Fastest if you got the cash.
---
Cheating
---
&gt;witter is not customer support. 
---
correct, which is why you dont use twitter unless you have an abnormal issue.
---
&gt; There are many games around the same price that have dedicated support. 
---
rs has dedicated support.
---
You should absolutely poop in the walkway to the building for what they‚Äôve put us through
---
You don't need to fight the Hydra, just go into his lair.
---
Okay and did woox do it yet or is he preparing?
---
no trickery, this will go down in history
---
But again, it doesn't \_need\_ to be a best in slot money maker, it's a skill that if you do it, you'll make some pretty decent money, if you don't do it, then you won't make money from the skill, it's not as though you must do rc because it makes money, I feel like it's a weak point to say "yeah but I can't make as much rcing as some pvm content", how does that even get fixed? Ruin money from pvm? Like some things fundamentally are more profitable than others.  
---
Aside from that, my main point was to say pvm isn't the sole thing that lowered profits from rcing, the market demand for nats being lower combined with more people able to make double nats is a far more likely culprit for the decline of nat prices, getting 99 slayer I cannot say I made an astronomical amount of money on nats, infact, blood runes were by and large the thing I got the most of, yet you don't see blood rcing not being a viable thing, even though the barrier to entry is low combined with high amounts of them coming from pvm, because the demand for blood runes is higher than nats, because nats are no longer the best way to train magic, back in the day, everyone used nats to train magic though so they were highly sought after because bank standing was far more valued back in the day.  
---
I'm just saying, to pin this problem as pvm being the issue is extremely tunnel visioned.
---
Where is your crab costume?
---
&gt; with no plans or notice of an actual legitimate support feature.
---
Sorry to keep interjecting, but I saw this after replying to your reply to me. Anyway, you do realize they've been release Support Blogs over the past year and are working on improvements, right? It is hard to claim no plans or notice when they've at least done that.
---
The game is literally from 2001. If your computer is able to turn on, then it's good enough for rs
---
Casually has nearly a bil worth of sweets on a pvp world
---
People always cite $11 and don't realize the support system also applies to f2p players.  I have no idea how the ticket queue works but I've never seen that p2p issues are prioritized over f2p.  
---
I have to imagine the amount of f2p bot ban appeals are overwhelming.  Pure subscription models like WoW don't have to deal with that.
---
I agree that the current state of player support is unacceptable, but the $11 argument doesn't hold much water. If it was an easy fix it would be done already.
---
I agree with you. But the adrenalin rush after each level hit. Just make you want it more. üòÖ
---
A lot of people on this game seem to believe in imaginary "RNG" mechanics where "luck" is a depleteable resource here and if you get a really rare drop, the chance of getting other rares is lowered. So when they get the "wrong rare drop", they flip out/get depressed/etc.
---
Sorry friend, I need that 70m. And another 8 70m's in order to buy what I want. 
---
Spend 30 minutes making money every day. You'll have 20m in less than a month.
---
Hey now, now you're the one with the random ass comments! Someone already answered you you phony!
---
You try mlm? It‚Äôs decently afk
---
Screw rs3
---
Thank you. I knew that. I thought you were unnoting them in the boss room. I'm sorry.
---
You got a positive attitude, a dd-ace and full prospectors, the sky is the limit. God speed!
---
You're a bloody Muppet.
---
You realize your previous comments remain unedited right? 
---
You're the one getting serious, hostile &amp; negative &amp; It's here for everyone to see yet you still attempt to twist words &amp; play mental gymnastics over a metaphorical osrs remark that's not meant literally. Then you think me asking a genuine question to gauge your reaction means I'm mad? Hahaha, nobody is getting mad here but you. 
---
Just do yourself a favor &amp; move along you silly cunt lol
---
If you typed your bank pin on reddit to prove a point I think I'm gonna blame you for this account being compromised.
---
&gt; So, why is the game worse if 6 digit people have access to content in the game?
---
So you don't care if the game is worse? Or alternatively if the game is better.
---
I‚Äôll take ‚ÄúThings my uncle said when I threatened to tell mom and dad about our special play time‚Äù for 500

Nuh uh cuz its excasctsas so xzact is way shorter

it's probably w365, it's high risk (so no prot item) but not a pvp world.
---
Nice! Message me in game when you see me online... currently at work.

One kill pays for death at Vorkath. Thats not really a big punishment. 100k is nothing these days.

You got a tbow, did you get an infernal cape? Did you get tired of not being able to buy dragon arrows?

Watchtower. Just do like novice difficulty/short quests ( you can find list on runewiki) took me like 3-4 hours last night to get from 157qp to 175qp

Explanation to the picture: Was doing medium clues so teleported with slayer ring to do my step. A level 63 with a robin hood hat came up and asked me my magic level, I said 99 and he said he had a "teleother teleport" which doesn't exist nor the wildy crabs. I am helpful but never trustful so banked everything and he instantly logged out. 
---
\*I could be wrong about the lure but it just seems very like one, and I hadn't seen one in that location in a while. I didn't trade but I'm assuming it was just a ghorrock teleport or something.
---
So how much is your average? Assuming you dont use alts to scout new raids for u, and you just dont stop raiding after 1-2 raids and actually go for multiple hours at once.
---
/old
---
No.  I‚Äôm never unlocking that wretched task again.
---
I wont spiral like that, but that's the gist haha
---
It clearly says medium efficiency is 30 kills/hour, while max efficiency 34.
---
You also have to take into account how long it takes to scout without alts and include that in the raiding time.
---
"if you roleplay as a girl you're trans" that's a yikes from me. I'm trans and played as guys to not have people think I was weird lmao.

Too bad there's Barrow's which is more efficient than that for mid level players

Thanks for proving my point that this supposed method isn't meta for moneymaking.

Honestly

you won't have to. with my suggestion the jaw prices will be cheap enough to buy and replace.

now i'ma be forced to watch overatedletics i mean swampletics for my dose of UIM, fuk this i'm done lol
---
Nats were great money. Not better than high-level pvm with BiS gear.
---
You‚Äôre wrong dude.
---
I'm sad now.
---
100k is nothing to people like me and you who probably don‚Äôt die at Vork anyways.
---
Also, I‚Äôd say -1 kill for a failed death is a fair penalty.  Not only do you lose the time and supply investment for the kill if you die, the next successful kill would just offset your debt, effectively doubling the cost of failure.  I really can‚Äôt see how a harsher penalty would make sense.
---
Why does he have to use the protect item interface? Wouldn't any other interface like the skills menu work?
---
I forgot to bank my rune pouch before I went to kbd, telled to lava maze and lost it along with 4K nats...
---
I don't get it. Why is he doing that? Don't people normally go for fire cape when they have a t least protection prayers and decent range level?
---
Until u reach therm? Lmao
---
Dont bother, go bossing or runecraft for gp
---
Sounds good bc 50 runes just suck, thats why i dont do wilderness diary. Unlocked the sword will do the obelisk  one day but 50 runes just suck
---
what a dummy, imagine not looking after your account when it has months of progress on it haha. guess it shows how much the account and his channel means to him if he just throws it all away like that by being careless lool
---
This we can all agree on.
---
Paying for more than one.
---
That's what I get for being lazy and not editing the GIF I guess, lol.
---
Ouch
---
It really be like that. Most of my friends played it at some point, but it was mainly just me for years...quitting and coming back repeatedly. Last year a random college roommate was really into it and convinced me to start up an OSRS account after a 5-6 year break. Then we went and convinced another of my friends who was a former scaper. And here we are 15 years later rebuilding our accounts in what's about to be 2020. Shits crazy. The nostalgia and the addiction to the grind is hard to escape..and easy to relapse back into.
---
are you his gf? how much is kob paying you
---
Since RL removed their plugin I have been scared of going back to gorillas. Are they as bad as I make them to be?
---
But the fact that death has has no reprecussions is a pretty broken system. In fact it gets absued regularly.
---
yes lmao, the most ull get from killing slayer monsters is like 800k an hour at gargs, i dont count cerb, hydra as those are bosses and vorkath and zulrah are more gp than both of those and both take far less time to unlock
---
kob is my friend and a guy
---
Wow he was close to having all the items he wanted too. Homie spent bills on lucky imps too big F
---
Slayerhelm, range pots, cut brews

So is it at 10am est or 12?

---
It doesn't work on cheese cause cheese is op
---
Think they are joking the handwriting looks like 52 instead of 47
---
Yeah I‚Äôm 77 and feel the whole slayer for money thing is soo overrated. Only got up to here to unlock brutal blacks, skelly wyvs and garbs.
---
also keep in mind u cant consistently make money like you can with other skills, ur not gonna get the same task over and over so technically your making far less than your best gp maker unlike others skills u can do consistently
---
because people would way rather do pvm for money and supplies lol who the fuck actually wants to go chop wood or mine or rc for profit, almost no one. game would be even more dead than now if that was the case.
---
No fuckin way, that is devastating. It can happen to anyone and this is really unfortunate
---
Gratz dude
---
Yeah, imagine making a mistake, am I right? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
now you gotta get the adrenaline rush that comes from consistently getting 90K+/hr at volc mine
---
I‚Äôd be cool with him obtaining his previous gear on the main land before he returns. At least some of it. But at the same time, it was his fault, not a server DC or anything, so idk
---
Less brews, keep the anguish. Otherwise it‚Äôs easy man especially with your stats. All you need to really do is figure out where Jad will spawn, in the early waves. Then use italy rock to safespot. U should honestly never run out of supplies with that setup
---
afking just shows he doesn't care
---
Yes, yes and kinda but not entirely lol.
---
Wonder how long it will take to rebuild after losing all those items
---
The biggest **F** is deserved here
---
But the current death mechanics are horribly broken?
---
i remember pking back in 2006/7 and when i killed someone i would type u 8 2 l8 m8
---
It's not "fixing" ddos, all that needs to be done is a system to detect it, and change the game state in a way that mitigates the worst effects on the players of that ddos

Just full obsidian armor, sword, and necklace would take hundreds of hours since he'd have shit gear to range them with.
---
Make one yourself! Then the next person who is fascinated by this can look at your diagram and know all of this
---
Looks fake
---
While it's sad to see that amount of progress lost to his error, it seems really irresponsible to leave the account after *that much* time was put into it.
---
But I can't hold that to him or anyone, we're all capable of making mistakes.
---
Yeah doesnt really do much :(
---
Yea I realized after I made it that I‚Äôm not that smart
---
Hey I used your low level galvek video to help me kill galvek, thanks
---
If you're planning on doing more barrows, sell this ahrim's skirt and buy a trident+occult. It will speed up your kills significantly.
---
You can charge the trident with runes you get from barrows runs too
---
Haha making fun of people is so funny!!
---
The trident attacks faster than Iban's staff, meaning your kills should speed up by about 20%, so you'll be using less prayer per kill too. It is quite worthwhile getting yes. Perhaps you can use the necklace until you can use the trident?
---
You can also make decent money as a low - medium level in the wildly, the trident is extremely handy for that as it contains the charges, also if you get attacked you'll still keep it all if it is a protected item (though I guess that might also be the case for Iban's? Forgot exactly how it works)
---
Vorkath has added more than 10x that in raw alchables to the economy, you just aren't immediately privy to that info. Do you still like that?
---
Oh my god this makes me so happy
---
Nice! I live no more than 10 minutes north of you. What‚Äôs your IGN?
---
Yeah I drew it out on paper. Might take some time for me to find some time to infographic it though.
---
After, with abyssal rcing and the Ourania altar.
---
Who's Kob?
---
Old thread but they actually drop *less* herbs for some reason.
---
Isn't it only relevant for a single fight in that one quest? Hardly a massive waste.
---
Glad to hear that getting teamed didn't discourage you! If you wanna try out pking with less risk, definitely check out last man standing
---
One thing I don't get are his items kept. He should have kept his 3 most expensive items which would have been Fury, Zerk Neck, and Regen Brace, as well as any untradeables, but it looks like somehow the fire cape and D spear protected over the other 2 pieces which should be impossible unless I'm completely wrong about something.
---
Struggling to believe he got 81 Crystals and 8 jars in 7.8k kc...
---
Cue the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme
---
Just go back and pick up your items....? 
---
Why is this shit even posted?
---
Struggling to believe he got 81 crystals and 8 jars in 7.9k kc

Karma
---
Items won't be leaving the game with old death mechanics to overcome market saturation. People simply don't die that frequently for top tier items, and they boss all the time.
---
maybe? not dying to fire giants unless you have a stroke at your monitor or some shit.
---
Firemaking super useful and very profitable skill
---
Uim lose everything on death except untradeables.
---
Toxic SoTD does the same thing except it can't autocast.
---
I was gonna suggest Kodai wand but it's powerful enough.
---
What else is there?
---
I mean they *look* like the kind of guy that would share a girl with 3 other guys and not mind
---
Honestly he should just deiron and trade the stuff over. At least poll his viewers
---
Swampletics would never

Pvpers tend to level to a certain relative standard, last I knew it was like 120 in DS3. For a one-time playthrough, most people probably won‚Äôt get there unless they decide to grind out some levels for a boss or something. In my experience, typically an average leveling playthrough (i.e. using your souls for upgrades and levels when you have enough) will probably get you around 90ish if I remember correctly. 
---
Now, it‚Äôs a hugely popular thing for you tubers and streamers to level as little as possible just for the sake of an entertaining challenge to watch. They will likely take a weapon gained early on with few requirements and blast through the game like the pros they are. So in that regard, it‚Äôs popular among the viewable internet. But I‚Äôd wager (though I‚Äôm really just making an educated guess) most people level on a relatively normal curve.
---
thank u for the spoiler tag
---
It‚Äôs funny because that isn‚Äôt the most unlikely thing I‚Äôve ever heard of.
---
Not relevent to situation above
---
Gold sellers are now sourcing their GP with reddit scams now?
---
Poor guy.

I wonder if he at least got the chance to say a racial or homophobic slur to the firegiant before it killed him?
---
Still won‚Äôt be the same
---
Everyone here is acting like they have never walked out of the room while doing slayer and forgotten they were logged in.
---
I'm assuming you're against STASH units, seed vault, looting bag, all sorts of POH features, Diango, looting/coal/gem/bolt/rune/herb pouches or bags, key ring, master scroll book, and other methods of storage as well?
---
lol ive fallen asleep at my chair at kraken *twice* for a 50m death. Told myself im never doing that task again if im tired.
---
Dam, good luck. I took a huge break with mine..
---
If you're training slayer for xp, it's never very profitable to do the good xp tasks. If you're training for money, doing boss variants will be good gp but terrible xp/hr.
---
Jesus is that how long he‚Äôs been working on that account already?
---
Hardly better than the medium reward which is 30 free runes I think.  I Occasionally claim them when ever I have to go to mage bank and often I just drop the 30 body runes I get given.
---
Go for it. Jamflex as much as I hate them has taken me for hundreds of dollars (if not thousands) in RuneScape membership and even bonds (GP BOOOOST) over the years
---
same
---
paying someone gp to do anything in game is not against the rule above
---
Agility more bad

Bandos boots and Dragon gloves, lol such such an alpha.

You calling that guy a unit whilst you're wearing guthans with bandos boots? Ironic
---
Hey man.. I'm getting there.. Don't come at me with this. I still have desert treasure to knock out lol
---
I believe xzact, who's pretty much objectively the best player at inferno, has tried some attempts with verf's dream gear setup. Not sure if he succeeded
---
They should add a new ftp item called a bond
---
Name one funny joke
---
if you're at the point where you're trying to use a teleother tab and not looking at the item's name, you'll probably just click right through the warning tbh
---
&gt;its still some. Better than nothing.
---
I don't understand this mentality at all. Your entire motivation is to keep GE prices stable, with the sole goal of creating enjoyment for merchers and PvMers, and to do so you want to implement mechanics that actively take away enjoyment from people that die. Here's another item sink suggestion: just randomly delete items from people's banks. Is it an item sink? Of course! Is it fun? Who cares, it's better than nothing!
---
Huge F. Damn.
---
Wow my cat looks just like yours. Russian blue?
---
Are you trolling? How do you think phishing actually works? Of course it would say the exact same thing as the actual Jagex emails they are replicating. That's the point, so you don't automatically realize the email is a fake. You should always be skeptical when an email provides you the link to take care of account recovery instead of just saying to go to the website and do it there.

What if I just bought 1 bond on the rs3 account to change the name to whatever. Then I can change my name for free on my osrs account since it's a member and has never changed the name right?

I'm not worried about the name getting taken as nobody has ever taken my name before and I doubt in the short time it will be free somebody will randomly decide to make a new account and steal my name

Prayer flicking is an unintended mechanic in the first place. If someone is good enough to be able to use it, they can do that, but it shouldn't be made any easier than it is now.
---
And no, no one is "forced" to prayer flick, you can just...not do a slayer task that requires overheads if you don't have prayer potions. 
---
Also, slayer has basically been the main focus of this game for many, many years. We don't really need updates to make slayer more enjoyable. Making anything other than slayer more enjoyable instead would be a better idea.
---
You one of the four?
---
This is a pretty average semi-late game amount. My bank is worth more than that (though not by much tbh we have similar sized banks I guess) the embarrassing part is you begging for gp on Reddit.

why u gotta do us like that... gz btw :)!
---
I play ironman, if you have the wildy elites done you've probably already spent countless mils of skills. 63k is laughing money. And a shit ton of people still use battle staffs. Ironmen and mains alike. If you have the varrock diaries done and aren't utalising the staffs, you're just wasting free cash thrown at you every day.
