Probably because jagex hasn’t changed the price of bonds in relation to the dropped value of the Pound.  Buy them in Mexico though where bonds are $4 usd.
---
Someone should make a live action scene of this
---
Kills me a majority of the time.
---
hmm isnt there a thing where you can join a cc from the minigame tab? maybe u could try that to help find a group. good luck friend! 
---
I much prefer elo or red Dot over acog. 
---
So true
---
For sure, I meant for some reason my mind got so warped on playing just to make money, I couldn’t justify skilling or slaying for smaller amounts of money instead of doing what’s “max efficient” when it comes to making gp. Not efficiency for the sake of maxing my total. 
---
Isn't $4 times 5 bonds still $20
---
give kiss to pet
---
Oof. Goodluck on recovery then, maybe head to twitter :(
---
You really think people who are dumb enough to click on the streams, then the links, then enter in their account info are going to be able to understand that the date in the background means when it was filmed?  Even if you put "Filmed on XX/XX/XXXX" its not going to register to these people that it's a phishing stream.

Definitely, I actually tried storing some of these things in the toy box, was surprised you can't.

Turns out it's running Windows 10 Long Term Support Branch from 2016 but has the latest security updates. With very little to no bloatware. It's called the Subor Z+? It's got a Ryzen based processor with Vega graphics, so it's an APU.  Apparently they plan to release their modified Windows IoT(Internet of Things) version with 4 exclusives, sometime Q1 2019. Linus (from what I saw) didn't really run any games to really test how capable it is for gaming.

If you can get 2 coal for less than 655 (more like 440 at current prices) you profit.
---
It's also very good for wyverns. I've gotten two of them through Konar, and this thing rips.
---
i quit my main for a btw for a month just to see what it was like, when i was getting so much joy from small goals and milestones, like getting a certain drop like a rune scim, or talisman for RC (at very low level) everything seems so much more rewarding.  
---
long story short my main hasnt had sub since.
---
I think I replied to the wrong post here, don't even remember reading yours tbh
---
But to answer your question, bots can efficiently accomplish almost any repetitive task you want, whether its resource gathering or turning resource X into item Y. This inflates the supply of both and therefore reduces the reward for genuine players who do the same activity.

Bandos boots

True. Pre ge times were so different, glad I got to experience it

Okie dokie silly okio I'm an idiot!

Arceuus spellbook. Resurrect plant.

I’m mid level and got that exact task too. I struggled big time just killing one dragon. Luckily I had enough points to skip. I went back to Nieve and she gave me ~90 Ankous to kill which is so much faster. I probably won’t go back to Konar unless I’m much higher in cmb level.
---
Pics or didn't happen
---
Or like, just the regular timer he has in this same app
---
Yeah but in that case, having you bottomless compost bucket would take you 65 farming AND luck. It's a drop after all... Every other skilling upgrade has a predictable time to get (it was like 2 days of motherlode mine or me to get the coal bag for example) But in this case you can't predict when will you get it. But of course, I get what you mean, it's strange that it doesn't have any explanation of why it can hold so many compost. Also I don't think that 1 compost giving it 2 charges is okay
---

Jeez I've not been lucky then, just went through my 2000th token and I'm still stuck on iron. Fml

If you do the dynamite route, it's not that bad. Just have to wait for the charcoal.
---
I always do nechs single in slayer tower.  Their drops are better than the ones in the catacombs. And I like to make money while I slay. Bursting barely makes money and is very click intensive. Melee slaying is chill.
---
Still think about you JazzTheRabbitnumberiforgot.
---
This took effort. I am so sorry
---
Kill it
---
It is.....9,000,000iq
---
&gt; also "might affect pvp" yeah no shit its going to affect pvp it can use dragon arrows
---
granted
---
&gt; this will also bring new fletching meta into the game
---
no it wont. darts too op, and you can already fletch redwood anyway.

I currently have a 500m bank and own neither bandos nor armadyl. They are very marginal upgrades- I don't see myself buying either for quite a while honestly, they are super low priority.

Dark mode on the new wiki competes

That's true, but you can unlock all blocks without doing DS2. I agree that "being penalized" might sound a bit too extreme, but it is silly that you unlock tasks you might not want by doing certain quests.

That's what I thought. The only other reason that a name would be rejected is that it's offensive but the names Vecna so that's not either.
---
Yeah, I've witnessed first hand the result of maximum abuse of this scenario prior to Jagex's new ruling. I'm not sure if you know him or not, but there used to be a streamer and well known real world trader by the name of BTCs. He used to host Sub-Only giveaways many times a week. This player would do Sub-Only rolls for roughly 9-10 Elysian Spirit Shields at a time when they were around 600M. I've seen him accumulate over 200-300 subscribers within a couple minutes at times, because the thought of donating $10 for multiple chances at a 600M item was extremely tempting to everyone watching. Sparc Mac's recent giveaway was reminding me of this event to which I felt the need to report it.

The law runes for 1k were only when someone needed just one for a tell and wanted it now. I think they were only 300ish gp each for the most part. At least once law running was a thing.

Yes, when they inventory is red like in this photo you ‘drop’ becomes the default option.

You can drop while inventory in about 10 seconds tops.

---
oh you're right.  but does that app have functionality to repeatedly send a timer so you don't have to continuously start/stop?
---
Also, the rs3 highscores removes inactive (f2p) players. So it's possible someone still owns the name but is not on the rs3 highscores cause he/she is inactive and not on osrs cause he/she doesn't play osrs.
---
Your best bet is to try and get it when jagex does another name clean up. That's when they remove old inactive account names (usually not banned names though). Which has happened twice so far.

Can we get a continuation on this storyline?

Bro idk I just got my 3th hydra task after 10 tasks since release 
---
That’s what /r/oldschoolrs tried to be
---
Jagex has evaluated (correctly) that making minigames is a waste of time. People do not play minigames that don't have bis rewards (pest control, ba) because they don't advance your account and are a waste of time. 
---
So the options are either give them bis rewards (0% chance passing poll) or don't and nobody plays them after first week. It's just a losing proposition. 
---
Agility xp* but I’ll definitely take it. 
---
You can definitely get 300 in no time. But I'm just trying to voice that there are players who exist that deserve to vote and will be excluded if the level cap is raised too high.
---
I'm just pointing it out to raise awareness while everything is being considered. Just want everyone to know all parts of the impact of their choice.

I definitely don't want passive RC. That was one of my main reasons for quitting RS2. I spent forever getting to 98 RC, closing in on 99... And then they release a 200k/hour afk method.
---
Engaging, methods with lower xp rates but are more fun would be welcomed however. Passive training on the other hand isn't suitable for everything.
---
Preach bröther.
---
wait what
---
I understand how weighted tasks work, but you can still get the same amount of block slots by avoiding certain quests, such as regicide and DS2 and also not have to waste points skipping them.

And eh. I need 70 before occult. Also why would i need torture? Or do you mean tormented bracelet or whatever? I just want to hit 70 so i can start bursting tasks now that i imbued my slayer helm. Plus I need to get mage up anyway.

I've gotten three in two tasks (one before the task count change and one after, for a total around 270) consisting of 34 uncut diamonds, 5k fire runes, and 2 magic seeds.

It does, but bludgeon is worse imo

Usually I tp to my house and use it for the fairy ring and teleport, and I just restore my stamina there.

Ayiza was the one who was starting to make statements of taking actions against streamers who do this, i doubt it will be done anytime soon now since he left. 
---
No, since I strongly believe that this should be once again enforced, and I refuse to directly interact with people who use loot accounts. It is *MY* code.

Buy berserker/archer rings and imbue them. Next get barrow gloves. Then work on zenytes. Switch d legs for obsidian

This has nothing to do with you. Literally. Play your game. Fuck others

Kinda wish that Wyrms/Drakes etc. were unlocks/toggleable on Nieve/Duradel's task list instead of being assigned by default.

Would it still be profitable/break even?
---
What? How is Sparc Mac representative of the rest of the community? Pretty much all streamers do ironman so it's really fucking obvious if they rwt. Besides why would people who get paid to play the game risk their image on rwt?
---
yeah, all the rooms are way too easy, to get anything resembling a solo in terms of difficulty and points you basically have to have an equal number of alts to players.

If you look at the vod's of the streams you'll notice that theres big chunks of them being completely quiet. That is because the live streams cannot be enforced but the vod's can.

It could have even been called Divining, if it also included the making of prayer equipment, Charming, because you're making magical charms, or Warding, because you're adding magic protection to armor

Audio wires without *proper* insulation will always reduce quality a lot. (Bad insulation will lead to "reflection" of the signal). But basic rewiring of any data cable (so long as it is it is not analog) is simple with just some soldering.

I believe players can have their name removed like that while playing if it was reported as offensive. That would result in the player running around with "#" in their name until they log out and have to pick a new name.

Don't make a redwood shortbow or longbow. Just have it be a redwood bow.
---
Alching wood be a huge problem with these if every log gave a guaranteed weapon with higher HA worth than magic longbows. Make it so that something like 1/15 logs can make a redwood bow, or require a drop from either some other kind of skilling (maybe farming) or some monster drop. Maybe even improve the ranging guild to trade in tickets for a tool to make 1 redwood bow out of logs.
---
Have it require 95 fletching to make. I'm honestly fine with dragon arrows, it can't be any worse for PVP or PvM than some of the existing weapons, though I think the ranged lvl req should be 65 or 70.

Add it to the list!

4,943 days for me. I started playing a few days after my 14th birthday. It’s such a great nostalgic feeling playing the game again. Too bad we have to level back up though. 
---
Check the quest guide. If you PM me your username I'll look you up and be able to recommend better. You just pray mage (37 prayer) and attack with melee or ranged. I did it with roughly 70/70/70 but it was pretty easy for me so you could definitely do it with lower (just boost stats and have good food and the best armor you can get)

Look up RSBuddy prices for it

Later on in the game, you will be needing that valuable space.
---
Still doesn't make it honest work. 
---
i was just waiting for the brainlet. well done delivering content that doesnt involve spade memes
---
Many would say this is op, but the thing is, a lot of us just bury them when we're killing those creatures. Make room for the loot we can't do anything with on the spot. It could help give us a choice between burying quickly and getting back to things or taking the time to store the bones and sell/use them later.
---
Bro it's gonna speed you up big time, you need high ranged for most bossing anyways, just do it to 75 and get an eaay FC with a blowpipe. Anyone can do it and the str bonus is effectively going to save you time in the long run doing slayer.

Pvp worlds are usually more risk yes, it’s because you can pick your fights, whereas in BH you’re pretty much forced to fight a random target, who could just be a looter/ragger

Dhcb was 30m and useless before it was buffed

Or if you're talking more traditional methods, it's just PVM.

ToB &gt; CoX &gt; vorkath, revs, zulrah, hydra, everything else.

Agreed. Fanboys will downvote you into oblivion tho lol
---
I really appreciate the support! More videos to come! Maybe see you in game? :)
---
Perhaps it is fitting instead of ironic. Not like any1 really cares tho lol
---
Thanks friend. 
---
*gets donated 40 mil*

Or am I mistaken?

Sounds like that was in the RS Classic days. I was luckily able to remember the username and pass to my old account.

On the 13.37th day, mod ash made god. 
---
I’ve done it on PC 5 times now and the next task I get I’m doing it on mobile. Jad only tho. Fuck the tedious 62 waves on mobile lol
---
Have you tried not autoclicking?
---
To add on, look at that happens when anything that involves RS3 comes up. It’s either making fun of it or shitting on it.
---
I like people like him. Allows me to be a member for free
---
Is it even useful as a mid level weapon though?
---
Shout out to kevbp5 if you’re out there
---
From berzerk149
---
You really rellied to the comment the same way I replied to you but you called it weird? Thats so weird.
---
So it make sense for the bonecrusher to not crush bones?
---
These aren't noted bones either. Of course you can't crush bank notes because they're paper.
---
Smh the gender pay gap continues
---
How much wood could your wood cut if your wood could cut wood?
---
This will be fucking broken for pvp. I don’t pk, but no thanks to this
---
I tried this once, thought it worked, but later realize jagex charged me the correct amount in USD lol
---
its a basic function lol
---
Are there any plans to give the Fish Sack from molch island an effect? Or will it forever stay a cosmetic?
---
Oh my God you're fucking stupid. It's weird because when I didn't respond you went through 5 hours later and commented again. 
---
What are you not getting you dumb fucking melon, they aren't guaranteed bone drops, it's how it was intended. Everyone's telling you that's how its supposed to be but You're not listening.
---
took me 6 hours. just listen to music while doing it. 
---
Just keep using Steve or Nieve. You'll be 100 in no time
---
if the fountain was a small island and you had to go through the undergeound pass to get to it i would bankstand there.
---
it had its niche of being an extremely OP PK spec that eventually got nerfed.
---
as a training weapon it is not useful for anyone. It's an extremely poor ironman's corp weapon and if they are using Dspear to kill corp they are more retarded than poor.
---
as a note, zamorakian spear is dropped by zamorak gwd and has a second effect of becoming a hasta.

If you have SGS then just use prayer gear for every melee task.

Lmao😂
---
&gt;a firecape doesnt take more than 45 mins

Wtf are you talking about? That may be your pr but a first timer DEFINITELY needs hours upon hours of preperation, learning, and failing multiple times.
---
Petition to give 1xp cooking pet inventory lol
---
North Korea only HCIM
---
Patient is basically braindead*
---
So how does them not being guaranteed correlate with the bonecrusher not crushing bones?
---
How does the bonecrusher know which bones to crush and which ones not to?
---
The wiki says the bonecrusher crushes all dropped bones if it's in your inventory. How does the bonecrusher magically crush one set of bones but not the others? They're still coming from the exact same place.
---
Was hiding during construction
---
They're literally the last thing you buy for melee, unless you count sgs as worth buying which nobody should anymore 
---
me 2 so 92/99
---
Not necessarily. Where do those big bones come from? They're not the bones of the bloodveld or they would drop Everytime, correct? 
---
Congrats!! This is what I'm going for as my first 99. I'm curious as to what you did to get there?
---
Currently at 91 doing papayas, mahagonys, calquats, torstols and dwarf weed. Any suggestions to get there sooner that's not too expensive?
---
Range is definitely op, no argument needed. BP is insanely strong for a 5M weapon and sure its upkeep is slightly expensive, but it kills shit so fast it’s always worth using over everything else. Twisted bow is basically a fucking grenade launcher and is only balanced because it’s like 1B. DHCB makes vork a cash cow (or dragon ig) as well as olm head, brutal blacks and KBD.
---
Range doesn’t need anything else, and if it does get something I think the best would be to go with a helmet because aside from arma helmet the best thing is archers I believe and that’s like 42 def. so it goes 42-75 with nothing in between or after.
---
Explain
---
What's the name of the account? lemme see those stats my dude
---
You're lucky you had inventory space! I spend half my time there juggling bones, peaches and food.
---
Are you the gnome?
---
Show me your bank, ill give it right back i promise...
---
There is a feature that makes it where you can logout for a couple minutes and not have to re-enter your pin. Talk to the banker in game about it I believe 
---
6000 iq p

Woah Wtf??? Bonds are $6.99 in USD. That's bs how they're cheaper for Europe when the majority of players are American. 
---
I'd drop flowers off by the smashed unicorn, personally.

No where in my post did I state it was a Sub-Only giveaway. He then said the plan would be that followers could enter. The first roll he did for followers. Afterwards, he asked everyone if Sub-Only giveaways were allowed and hundreds of people said "no". He then ignored everyone's warnings and put the chat in Sub-Only Mode. Immediately after he posted !prime. This behavior suggested that the next 2 rolls were going to be for subs only. He collected a decent amount of subscribers, around 20 or so, before he took the chat off of Sub-Only Mode and went back to the original plan after his mods kept saying he might get banned if he keeps this up. 
---
Where is a good place to check out clans? The forums are outdated. 
---
all monsters
---
Did you know that the Rune Plateskirt is 0.9kg lighter than the Rune Platelegs, meaning that f2p bis gear is female-only? Wake up, Jamflex!
---
Someone else, not me of course, should start "a discussion" about this game. You couldn't be less useful if you tried. Start it yourself then Socrates. Shall we feed you grapes while you criticize everything else on this sub and never contribute anything of your own? Fuck me the internet is unreal sometimes. 
---
To add on to that you could just :
---
Win + Shift + S
---
122 combat. HP cape, rune gloves. I'll probably max combat, range, mage and have 99 slayer before a fire cape or barrows gloves. Don't care to spend an hour paying attention to a game, but can AFK for hours easy.
---
Any tips for someone still struggling? I’m always good until I have to kill/reposition the healers.
---
It’s not working then weird 
---
lol
---
Learned this the hard way and lost like 60% shayzien favour when I completed the hosidius house. The worst thing about the current system imo is that once you've started to gain favour with a house, you're pretty much locked out from doing a lot of things Zeah has to offer until you've reached 100% and locked in the favour. That's bad game design, especially from what was new content at the time. It discouraged you from testing new stuff.
---
Are there any news from Lynx Titan after he got 200m EXP all? 
---
What is he currently doing? 
---
I feel you 
---
imagine playing the game to have fun?!
---
His behavior and actions suggested that the next 2 rolls were going to be subscriber only. After the first follower roll, he ignored the hundreds of people saying sub only rolls were not allowed and he put the chat into sub only mode. Then he posted !prime which was a sign that the next few rolls were going to be sub only. It wasn't until 15 minutes or so of collecting over a dozen new subs that he finally decided to take off sub only mode after his mods kept stating there's a good chance he's going to be banned if he goes through with it. They messaged him multiple warnings when it was in sub only mode.
---
100% yes for BRRRRRRTTTT
---
TIL 80%+ of people with smartphones are neckbeards
---
i think you have to kill it first then let it respawn then it will show next time when you kill it
---
Be careful using names like that, soon you’ll have a ton of fuckbois screeching at your that it’s open source and can’t have a security breach-when in reality/online anything can be leaked or broken into.
---
so you're upset that he put his chat in sub mode? i don't see the problem

---
&gt; No other skilling upgrade this useful has been made tradeable, that I know of.
---
It's more QoL than a useful upgrade bc you have essentially infinite compost from the lepers and lunar spell anyways.
---
I find myself having most fun and efficiency when having a solid goal. Like rn I need elite void, I raid a lot and use regular void (112 KC still no elite lol). So I had to get graceful(lost graceful on mobile release with the tap to drop thingy), to do tithe farms+hunter, so I grinded graceful out in like 3 days and got 60-73 agil, and just got 60-66 hunter tonight also.

It's runecraft, not runecrafting.

At least 5k people hit the upvote button.

I remember when I first started OSRS I tried selling a law for 1k and I got laughed at so bad
---
Fuck em. The common denominator is runelite. Unless there is some fucking expert level hacker installing keyloggers on everyone's computer and stealing their banks. That's multiple people running 2 step auth with bank pins that have been cleaned. It honestly should be next to impossible for that to happen.
---
I fought healers one at a time and just took my time honestly
---
Until you realize that you have 50k in the bank and a sgs mortgage to pay. 
---
*^^thud ^^thud ^^thud*
---
I use prayer gear in catacombs, but prossy vs Drakes sounds really bad since they use two styles and Abby Demons+Kurasks don't do that much damage (can do a whole task with 10 sharks and SGS, no prayers besides protect from melee a bit so SGS doesn't restore 0 prayer every time) 
---
&gt;Lets just make tbow and scythe the only weapons in the game and screw everyone else right?
---
Except that isn't how it is or would be. pipe, rapier, maul, bludgeon all compete with scythe and tbow in a lot of different places.
---
&gt;lmfao I mean you're the one getting downvoted from what I can see but alright homie..
---
Yeah everyone wants blowpipe v2 where they get stupid op weapons for super cheap.
---
I love this style
---
Depends. What kind of music were you playing?
---
Lol “illegal” 
---
That's good on you man. To me, the best thing about Runescape is it has always been a single player game which you play with other people (for the most part). There's no way you HAVE TO go about things. Just play your own game and enjoy yourself.
---
What in the fuck is going on here?
---
Genius he is!
---
It's going to be cosmetic forever 
---
Not really, no.
---
So i trident dharok then guthan with mystic on and the book. I know mage bonus doesnt matter but does it increase my accuracy or max hit or anything?  
---
Then karil, ahrim, verac and torag. I use range to get the kc 86 percent.  
---
Am i wasting my time with magic robes switch?
---
lol bots
---
How much Tokyo did that give?
---
Ahh, buying 77k Herrings, a fellow man of culture i see

You sure are putting a lot of effort into something that only really affects you by you not getting access to the giveaway. You wouldn’t benefit with Sparc Mac’s banning, you’d only see someone brought down. You’re pursuing something out of spite. Imagine if you had replied “lol you know what I mean” or nothing at all. We wouldn’t have gotten hear, but at least you wouldn’t be wrong right now. Btw I’m the emotional one lol

No plz very good suggestion but no, ty
---
You can train afk really easily while playing on a main, doesn't even take that long to get to this guy's point combat-wise.
---
He also could've done it at 17 combat but I think he got 1 or 2 too many hp levels (my 40 def account is 17 combat)
---
I think it does increase your hit chance, but by very minimal amounts that it's not really worth bringing, you could go get a mage arena 2 cape for the bonus damage though

He served the good cause. F.
---
Have you tried magic shortbow(i) with amethyst arrows? I'm pretty sure that's higher DPS than rune crossbow. Swap bandos boots for godhide/snakeskin boots unless you feel defence bonus is necessary.
---
You can swap neitiznot to god coif or tank helm since you're not meleeing. In general try to optimize your gear around melee defence/range accuracy. Magic accuracy makes negligible difference.

That circle was very useful, right guys

Give me some tendies pleas.

Same thing happened to me. Lost my full zammy to some weird wilderness trick and that crushed me. Stopped playing because of that all these years until mobile was released again 
---
Law runes weren't 1k each, it was more that 1k was the given price when you really needed one law rune for a teleport.
---
Yeah I think he’s just implying it was too fast (exaggerating is not the word idk) but also that’s fortnite and time to kill is longer than most cause the guns aren’t very accurate by design
---
My best friend and I always were RuneScape buddies. He ended up committing suicide. All he ever wanted was 99 fishing from fishing sharks. He was 96. I had his password and emailed Jagex and asked if they could give me the account so I could finish it for him. They perma banned it :( not sure why I even still play after that.
---
That doesn’t make any sense.
---
Sparc Mac has always been a slimy piece of shit, using fans to tank bosses for him back in restricted trade and trying to direct his fans to crash for him if you pissed him off by successfully crashing him, he's a little baby
---
Yes it is
---
Yeah calced it out earlier, loss is 140m +
---
No. 
---
I mean, 83 rc in 3 years, holy fuck
---
You're just totally wrong on that. People day trade all the time. You can trade with margin (multiply gains and losses) and also short (make money when a stock goes down). Lots of people day trade for a living.

I did it with 78 range, 53 prayer, and 60 defense. It’s definitely doable. I had 4 left over p pots and plenty of brews. I got 60 defense so I could just tank the healers vice luring/killing them.

Youre right, but most hastaes have a longsword speed, whereas zammy and dragon have the scimitar speed. Pretty dumb that hastaes have negative defensive bonuses.

Back when skills were serious bank too, because the odds of you being in the same bank at the same time with someone with 1k noted magic logs was rare, and you really want those logs and this is a rare chance to get a bunch of them, seller set the price and you either paid it, waited around for another person selling them or wasted your weekend getting 1k magic logs.

Sell your sgs and buy a berserker ring, prime and then tassets if you have the cash. The sgs is just a luxury prayer potion and those items will help melee slayer more.

dude tried to contact a tribe known to be aggressive to outsiders in order to spread jesus and got killed. More importantly, the tribe itself would very likely be highly susceptible to contracting diseases they have no immunity to, so a recovery of the body ensued. People were pissed at the dude who died because he knew not to contact these people and he knew contact could potentially lead to the deaths of tribe members.

The upgraded maul could be tradeable, though.

all the giveaways he did were open for everyone and none of them were subscriber only.
---
phrom da norf mista

i had this runescape friend back in 2006-07 named The Owners. hasnt logged in since then but his name still remains in my friends list :’) same goes for Fire Eye97
---
Which he didn’t do an OP admitted it himself all giveaways where done for followers and subs making it fully legal. 
---
That's it bitch I got the knife 
---
yeah im thinking mage all but BP ahrim and just leave melee behind. Something like Kodai, ancestral hat, god robes, book of darkness, holy sandals, imbue god cape, seers ring I, bp and anguish swap for ahrim, barrows and house tabs, emergency stamina and spot, combat potion, ice barrage. Its a two item switch, quick dps runs and anything extra would just be a waste because I won't need excess defense or swaps. Does that sound about right? mort hard done also read to do 88% reward.
---
Unfortunately it disappears if you perform another action or if you get attacked so if your not expecting the level or if your in combat its easy to miss, which sucks because finding out what stuff you've unlocked is always satisfying, and going into the skill guide to see just isn't the same :o
---
ok, i get the poison and stand under part, but how do you stand under without kbd just walking bavkwards to atk you....

Everyone who does giveaways or advertises giveaways, for subs or not. I won’t watch, it’s fucking boring.

Comparing it to the drug trade is blowing it out of proportion. On one end you have a sometimes dangerous job that’s illegal and can put you away for a long time depending on how big you get, and then we have a video game who’s rules say you can’t sell items, and the repercussions are you get banned and just make a new account.

She has a very strong magic attack, and drains your prayer if you're not standing next to her. I'd recommend using Melee gear, with Protect from Magic, and make sure you stand next to her. She's not very difficult if you do that.

If you can explain how it's a 'good game', I'm happy to listen.

If not, then I guess I'm right.

Agreed, maby just a faint glow or a highlight.

The only thing worse than flashing icons was placing a map marker by accident every time you went to view the world map haha
---
There’s actually a ton of different clans dedicated to PVM I’d check out the forums from the osrs website.  Some have requirement like gear or combat lvl but there’s also plenty of lower tier ones that will teach you bossing just look for the one you think will fit your account best
---
yes
---
Yes
---
yeah well it's true... idgaf how you and your cat live and when you're able to teach it or not all I'm saying is teach your pet not to do it and it's fine. 3 paragraphs from your diary won't change that tardo
---
Get over yourselves.

Nothing to see here.. this game doesn't have a bot problem

Nice

Have someone block all internet connection from your PC to the world ip and have them not tell you how they managed to do it

Banned for account sharing
---
Love it. New wallpaper dope asf
---
Sorry I didn’t phrase that correctly. What I meant is the case for people that got the quest before ds2 came out.
---
Crap you were faster
---
Yeah, although a potential new player wouldn't have a clue.
---
Surely you're using dhcb for 5-6 kill trips though? 
---
Casual ba cc
---
&gt;they shouldn't be immune to punishment. Why should they, because they're starving? 
---
I never expressed an opinion on whether they should be immune to punishment or not. 
---
&gt;All over the world people are starving, even in first world countries and yet they aren't given the right to ignore rules set before them.
---
I agree that that is the case.
---
&gt;Besides, it's always fun watching socialist shitholes burn. Maybe one day people will learn that the only thing socialism is good at is killing millions.
---
I’m not a believer of the functionality of socialism but the Venezuelan crisis is a lot more complex than than you seem to make it out to be. Similar to how the great depression couldn’t be summarized as “lol capitalism sucks”. 
---
Also it’s sad to see your humanity fail you as you seem ecstatic with the further suffering of humans that aren’t you simply because they were born into the wrong piece of land. I hope you can turn your mindset around.
---
Lekker pik!
---
What
---
Yup thats right but i used to use bp and though the timing might be slightly slower, i got 3-4 kills a trip. Taking into account no mistakes that could shorten the trip. Plus, you could also learn woox walking to cut down the timing more to reduce damage taken

1-2 kill trips with bp bgs is pretty standard, especially at 84 range no rigour. Without a dhcb I I would recommend doing zulrah for money instead once you get assembler
---
You saw it in RS3, why again?
---
ahh, sorry man, i let you down.
---
Me too
---
Yes, without the /s
---
HGH also gives you a timely death lol
---
Back in the days where platelegs were like 65k,platebodies 70k..2h 65k..
---
Rune set was 250k or so
---
That's just what happens when you tell the computer to roll 1/100. The odds aren't 1/100. You have to do alot more coding to get your program to run an actual 1/100 value.
---
Nice obby cape
---
Oh. Maybe the rats pluck it out and it’s just to lazy to fight back. 
---
/r/iamverysmart/
---
I quite like it.
---
That's what peak performance looks like.
---
People just like throwing high numbers when its about exp/h. Take it with a grain of salt.
---
They should make terror dogs count as dogs task
---
ya but this is a game. it wasnt made to be a lifeline and source of income
---
Better suggestion.. Bring back HD graphics but add the option to play both OLD and HD.

Range tanks don't have very high melee stats if I remember right, like 75/75 at most. Range tanks are fairly viable, and no you're not going to be risking a lot unless you wanna bring something like an anguish/ely. 
---
&gt;The dream account is one that can teleblock + stun/ice barrage and then use range and not risk a super crazy amount where I wouldn't wanna skull. 
---
99 range and mage and you got this. And you're not gonna be doing this in a BH world, everyone's going to leave on you and no one will fight you. And yes, you're either going to end up skulling in the wildy or risking ~1mil to offset your advantage.
---
Fruit baskets.
---
I run a social/pvm clan with an active discord willing to teach raids etc. Pm me on Reddit if you’re interested and I’ll give you some more details 
---
How about, get this, you have a choice between 3 days, 7 days, or 14 days after Authenticator has been removed. Delay is not a shit way of handling a compromised account. 
---
Not a good idea for raids lul
---
They're bis fire making xp, they don't need a buff.
---
Nigga be looking like the warriors guild doorman
---
Oo good to know.
---
So a range tank it is!
---
And why would people leave lol? I would skull by starting off a teleblock? 
---
Or is a range tank just annoying to fight against lol?
---
Agree 120%. Miss this so much, TBH.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Me three
---
This is where the coin pouches were brought in to force you to open the pouches before you can continue pickpocketing. Only thing before that stopping you pickpocketing was taking too much damage but as the levels go up you take less damage.
---
you're supposed to say "no, i don't have access to this email" though.  That's how you even get to the recovery page.
---
Not in the slightest, some are toggling run, I assume they are all just tut island speedrunners 
---
Or you just roll on a death rune drop twice
---
Gaming mode on my phone. Completely blocks notifications and calls 😁
---
I couldn’t do it without protection from magic but I’m sure there’s some maniac out there that has.

---
That free trade / wilderness removal situation was appalling. I can't believe I forgot about that.
---
As a uim. I support, tho even without this I would eventually go for the brim ring anyway
---
Honestly some level of this kind of behaviour is actually beneficial to the game. Imagine how expensive prayer XP would be without dragon bone farmers, or how expensive resources like logs would be without bots keeping prices down.
---
Does the cat have a friend? That'll calm him/her down.
---
lots of cunts
---
He's no Jesus.
---
No
---
Barrows would be good for your level 
---
Shouldn't have done dragon slayer, that's my current start to not get dragon tasks
---
i killed like 350 of them on my ironman without a blowpipe, it was pretty good
---
Yeah tbow is only expensive  because of the hype as well. Lots of hype 
---
The main complaint is, pets should be rare and not rewards from a 30min quest. Gertrude has her cat quest already, no need for rats. 
---
Fast and easy task for fast xp, they can drop rannar seeds ad well
---
so ur saying adding a reward to this quest incentivises people to do said quest? right got ya
---
Old repost
---
Client side alteration. I think this one might be too far. Good for dmm pking and for streamers but can be used for deception and scamming. 
---
I'll remove it :)
---
This was on the front page like a week ago...
---
the anti-phone screenshot circlejerk is real
---
should I trust a person willing to double my gp in 2 trades?
---
I'm oblivious. What's the difference between this and 'old' wiki? Thanks !
---
While we're doing that, lets get an new necklace that consumes the Torture, Anguish and Occult.
---
Might as well do a Scythe Bow that uses a Tbow + Scythe together. 
---
24/7 render self. Like it. Thumbnail vids under people who have pets lol.

why care

Ez pz. Use range. Itll be a little slow but it's your safest and best bet.

Petition to show Fan Farts on the Television
---
Expensive compared to what it normally is, maybe, but its bis at hydra, lance is only good at rune dragons and is  bis at olm for people who cant afford a scythe.
---
Well the keyboard is the joke
---
Nice projecting mr self secure
---
Try the pest control world brother
---
Why, though? You can literally turn the lights off. Plus nothing looks quite as good as a Dutch flag keyboard
---
they should just nerf the blowpipe. and when everyone complains that certain things are now undoable without the blowpipe we can adjust them accordingly
---
Not gonna lie, wasn't even my intention. 
---
Rune crossbow with diamond bolts is probably best but they are expensive though. 
---
My mouse now has 12 side buttons and RGB too
---
James Bonds 
---
Oh my gawd! 500k pk! 
---
If you have the slayer level to do gargs, im sure your combat is fine
---
It would also free up bank space for those who can afford the ring. This is a rewarding reason to camp hydra aside from the Lance and pet for people that already own a Scythe and have no need to use the Lance anywhere (as lance is not BIS anywhere)
---
Now get kbd pet as 18cb hcim. If u get 19cb make a new account
---
Done the diary
---
Pretty much base 80’s atm, I know I’d be fine for regular Gargs but wasn’t sure about bosses
---
this could be fun, think of the things you can and can't do
---
Jal-Yeet

Xp/hr?
---
Faster than bloodvelds, greater demons?
---
this is an average day training thieving in the ardy bank
---
I dont like to brag about it but... I got Jad pet on 3kc :D
---
I was wondering the same thing. Sometimes all these acronyms can be a lot for people coming back to the game
---
Not sure, but the comic is part of a series called Poorly Drawn Lines. Definitely check them out. 
---
ALIEN HUNTING ALIEN HUNTING
---
Do you use dragon darts the whole cave or something? I normally just about lose money on tasks.
---
If the degradation required additional ring sets, and in creating the ring it became untradeable?
---
This would be a high gp/ hour ring to use (you wouldn’t think it would be used for normal slayer etc) and would be a continuous ring sink.
---
Even so, doubt it would ever pass a poll.
---
Much more than 50m. Not sure exactly how much off top of my head
---
Barrows is very affordable, unless you intended to stay at 60Def.
---
If youre doing slayer, fighter torso if you can be bothered to grind barbarian assault. Otherwise rock dragon platelegs and a rune plate, or obsidian plate if you can afford it. 
---
Or just wear monk robes/unlock proselyte and throw an overhead on. 70Def should be a goal though if you're on a main. Torags armour is cheap as hell and offers some of the best defence in the game
---
Nothing happens, same for if you teleport with it out
---
why dont we have both.jpg
---
Go do the Barbarian Assault minigame for the Fighter Torso.
---
Yes this would perfect! 100% support
---
lit
---
Shamans you can do your task in like 1.5h id reckon, probs make like 1.5m aswell without the dwh so i think its worth it for the 70k orso range xp/h
---
At least 100k
---
I believe you can since you can also do darts or bolts
---
I was actually flippin quite a few bonds for 200k profit ea 
---
I love this
---
I support this x2007 times!
---
Cat just turned your wired mouse into wireless mouse. Don't see a problem. 
---
That's a lot of blast furnace worlds
---
Well it sure as hell isn't "honest work" as far as the context of the meme goes. 
---
I'll grab the legs right away then and work towards the torso. Does that mean that the strength bonus from the torso is better than the added defense from the chainbody?
---
Wow a picture of a ranger boots drop. Thank you for sharing this I had never seen anything like it posted on this sub ever before
---
&gt; Animation Snapping
---
&gt; While 3 tick fishing, players previously used a snapping animation to assist with their timing which was removed with the release of equippable fishing rods. This has been re-implemented.
---
God fucking bless thank you time to get back to 200m fish, rest of the updates are also decent gj. 
---
Konar has boobs. 
---
/u/JagexGambit still no notification on recieving Golden Tench? pls :(
---
You can if you're retarded. Either that or you're a psychopath.

Still wanna see a safe zone implemented around house portals.

Kebos Graphical Changes and Other Fixes
---
January 17 2019
---
This week's game update sees the release of multiple changes and fixes following feedback from the release of the Kebos Lowlands. In the meantime, we are still collecting feedback from the recent poll blog and will use it to write a revised version expected to be live on Friday before polling the suggestions in game, this blog will include proposed changes to Konar's loot table.
---
￼ 
---
Graphical Changes
---
Brimstone Boots 
---
The Brimstone Boots have been updated to look more like boots! 
---
Ferocious Gloves 
---
The Ferocious Gloves now cover the players' hands and the inventory model has been updated to show this. 
---
Seed Boxes 
---
The graphic for seed boxes given with contracts in the Farming Guild has been updated. 
---
Fishing and the Golden Tench
---
￼Golden Tench Nerf 
---
The negative stats that all fun weapons usually have were added to the Golden tench to ensure safe slapping all around. 
---
Animation Snapping 
---
While 3 tick fishing, players previously used a snapping animation to assist with their timing which was removed with the release of equippable fishing rods. This has been re-implemented. 
---
High Alch Values
---
High alch value shouldn't dictate the value of an item unless it is specifically used as a 'high alch' drop (rune platebodies, platelegs etc...) on a drop table. Avoiding this prevents excess gold coming into the game. 
---
For new items, we'd prefer to focus our efforts on improving them to be worth a value above their alch value. This is why we are exploring options with the Drake tail. The other items we believe already offer more value than the alch values below. As a result, the following items have had their High Alchemy values reduced:
---
Broken dragon hasta to 37,440
---
Dragon hasta 37,440
---
Dragon hunter lance to 180k
---
Drake claw to 60k
---
Hydra claw to 90k
---
Hydra heart to 60k
---
Hydra eye to 60k
---
Hydra fang to 60k
---
Hydra leather to 60k
---
Ferocious gloves to 60k
---

---
Just curious u/JagexGambit I've seen a lot of discussion about buffing or nerfing things - was there ever any discussion about why the Hydra was balanced so that Range is the only required style to defeat it?
---
It always seemed like it was going to be a tough tribrd boss, similar to Zulrah - but requiring all 3: melee, magic and range.
---
That would give value and another good use of the Dragon Hunter Lance, and well as not having the Blowpipe / Tbow dominate everything. 
---
Yeah fair point, but I’m just saying why it looks like that and why the design isn’t as ridiculous as a lot of people say, if it was any more refined and bland everyone would complain that its too underwhelming and boring etc
---
Exactly. Skilling is only such dead content because bots drive all the prices down 
---
My first ever clue scroll
---
Nothing in the notes about fixing the farming guild doors? Was said to be fixed in q&amp;a
---
Nothing about Konar btw
---
thats why email is also a valid option for this. steam does text email AND steam app for verif codes. in all of these cases with shitty delay, youd be fucked regardless because 14 days max with no access to text or email.
---
text code verification is infinitely better than delayed removal. you literally cannot change my mind because its basic security.
---
i hope you are never let anywhere close to an account security teams code.
---
I’ve rustled some jimmies on the way I play runescape lol, good luck in the game.
---
Btw most of that is afk nmz 
---
IM is cool, but UIM is mostly not fun to play( non stop suicide mechanic, unnoting and taking only noted stuff), fun to watch tho.
---
West ardy folk eat cats how convenient
---
That'll all come in the revised poll blog tomorrow btw :) 
---
Fuck up you fat mongo
---
Fuck efficiency just play the game and relax. Don't make playing the game a job or a chore
---
From what base lvl... 30m-350m what are we working with
---
Footage of a whale
---
longing for the day when no bucket is required
---
Do Fremennik Trials and get the Archer helm as an upgrade tp the bandana.  I personally use a rune x-bow with broad bolts.  
---
Its nerfed in todays update
---
Dont nerf konars drop table with 30%... this is what hade her fun.
---
Instead just replace the skilling supplies with seeds/alchs. 
---
Please lissten to us!
---
Best regards A loyal OSRS Player.
---
AHH YOU REPLIED ok I only have one chance don't fuck this up strobelobe...

I want to sex you Gambit

FUCK

Yep i just high-alched my Hydra's eye &amp; Hydra's fang for 1.8m, thanks for the warning lmao
---
Cerberus is not “far more difficult” than hydra

level 3 level cap my dude
---
Make it tiered and buildable through construction!

This is actually quite clever, a bit of tape and you're there.

Clues raids slayer bosses regular bosses is what I do.  
---
Raids are fun with friends.  
---
Or you can become a deliverer in deliveritems, that's something that pulled me out of the no-goal zone.
---
Do the The Ascent of Arceuus quest, Enter the Abyss miniquest and once you reach 46 magic and 45 woodcutting do The Eyes of Glouphrie. These three will get you up to level 24 without much effort.
---
Is buffing the dhunter stick going to be polled?
---
Censors run speed, doesn't censor name. Nice meme.
---
To answer your question, no. I have no statistical proof except for world count which as you mentioned isn't proof.
---
Yesterday mod ash stated that the bounty hunter update that was meant for last December, has been postponed to mid 2019.
---
Why are pvp updates always pushed back and given the least priority?
---
Ignoring a portion of your player base inevitably leads them to becoming a minority. 
---
Wilderness pvp is going to completely die if jagex keeps this up.
---
Whoops! I'll add that in - this was included in today's changes.
---
Yah, that is my opinion. 
---
Me myself  i personally use full blessed d hide with d hide boots + fury + dhide coif with book of darkness, occult, sara mage cape (i) and trident. I also take ice barrage in rune pouch with me because ice barrage is op af dont use any pray. Afterthat basically bp everything in the tunnels and loot chest.
---
Everyone will get the lamp, whether you complete the quest after the update or not. You'll probably just have to talk to the reward giver for the lamp.
---
They will forever be remembered
---
robin boots, tunic, hat, fury since range level 1 lul
---
You say Scythe Bow sarcastically, but now I'm hoping for it so I could finally get a fire cape
---
Creeper? I think you looking at the wrong game
---
:(
---
Probably because of how inverted &amp; rigidly-selective the Reddit community is.
---
Nah
---
anti fun police.
---
Ahhh. Interesting. 
---
Me too! Did you see that video of the 7 year old beating the 2nd to last boss on Dark Souls 3? was insane! I'll have to link you it sometime.
---
They did it in the new update. 
---
I'm sure they randomly hacked u for 300k lmfao
---
We'll discuss that among the team today, in preparation for the revised poll blog tomorrow. 
---
well luckily the majority will vote it in so w/e
---
This. #obbyrealm baby 
---
Makes it easier to fap
---
The pathing to the south fally shortcut is an undervalued update, you have my thanks sir
---
Support!!
---
Why do that on a pvp world specifically though 
---
Osrs is the tits. It’s gonna suck you back in hard though. Proceed with caution 
---
True, but I haven't completed enough quests to use the NMZ yet :(
---
Looked like vambraces before lol
---
So playing the game LESS  is more sweaty than playing the game MORE?
---
Not really understanding the logic there mate, seems to be an illogical insult for no reason.
---
We pay we say
---
I mean, you’re not wrong 
---
Negligible increase on the rings
---
Why have a pet that does shit like that? Never understood the appeal of cats cos they all just seem like destructive thugs xD
---
proselyte
---
OMG u must be the first to ever get this I have NEVER seen this before not sure if photoshopped or not this is UNREAL thank so much for sharing ranger boots first clue OMFG jagex confirm this is real please????

You could try.
---
Get your main to veng you, bring recoils. Have main/friend bring food etc to resupply you etc. 
---
Traps are gay
---
When did they fuck up hp btw? That was the last time i played before 2007scape. Thought the new graphics and all were crap.
---
PVP worlds have a bank right at the Lumbridge spawn, next to the fountain. You can see the chest in the top right of OP's image.
---
Playing a new character at the moment and this is something I miss every time I level up.
---
then go tell him about the right/left sides. if he still doesnt see it, he might be retarded
---
whats with the removal of the golden tench as a weapon? event RPG is still in the game you are just needlessly removing diversity.
---
For the cat or the mouse?
---
No fix to zuk attacking early?
---
If there is a potential for buffing the lance, please consider giving it an str option (giving an extra max hit) and allowing pures/zerks/med levels to use it.
---
Any further percentage damage/accuracy buff would be too much imo.
---
Did you know? His first ever clue scroll. 
---
"The negative stats that all fun weapons usually have were added to the Golden tench to ensure safe slapping all around." ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
If this passed, please make sure pets have priority for inventory space. It would be upsetting to not get a pet bc of a level up.
---
What medium is this? Also what's the line coming from the lads head?
---
It isnt BIS. It was just a dofferent item to use with a zamorak book other than carrying a rpg on your shoulder. The RPG is used by every single obby, is free, amd isnt negative stats. It's a purely cosmetic item, where as the fish is also but they nerfed it. It was fine with neutral stats 
---
Shortest distance to bank
---
If you're willing to take on the risk of playing a game that is likely to be addicting, do it.
---
are we going to be seing a buff with konar's drop table to make her non-dead content? will we also see xp improvements at Aerial fishing?
---
Its a dude literally stealing content and editing it together...what more did you expect
---
&gt; Aren't they filling jugs? You know to create wine
---
I know? I was pointing out that they 99% most likely are filling jugs for people to create wine with. 200M cooking here fella don't worry :)
---
Ah shit
---
Not true.  Event RPG is a cosmetic used in PvP that has all neutral stats.
---
Great for new players, bring a necessary amount of guidance and piques curiosity to level up skills further.
---
Only learnt about this recently, anyone got a pk vid with it?
---
If you guys gonna implement the seed vault idea the seed box should be the key to open it, so it doesn't get devalued 
---
Thank you for fixing the gloves! I still see a problem with the huge stats reqs to wear them. 80 defence AND 80 attack? It's a huge jump from barrows gloves and primordial boots. I think removing the defence requirement (since they give 0 defence bonuses) and lowering the attack level to 75 (with DS2) will make them more valuable and they would be used by more people. 
---
Hey, thank you for the suggestion. We've been discussing this with the Live Production team, and are assessing our options. There are issues with some solutions (date overlays may obscure certain parts of streams, such as reveals; watermarks won't make a difference as phishers just rehash our streams anyway; and dates on-screen can be obscured by heads/aren't always in-shot, adding dates to the sides of screens can be cropped out). I'm going to investigate getting a flip calendar we can put on the table which may help and seems to be perhaps the best option as it's fairly central on-screen. 
---
However, I think most of the issue is that a lot of the people who get phished are new to Twitch, or Old School, and are thus unfamiliar with our/our content creators' streams in the first place. They see 'DOUBLE XP NOW LIVE!' or 'QUITTING! 2BN GIVEAWAY!', 2000+ people watching, and view the stream without paying attention to the content. We are speaking to Twitch, and they have provided us a DMCA takedown tool, but given the viewbotted streams are live for about 20 minutes before being banned anyway, it's not really a proper solution (not to mention the out-of-hours coverage). We plan to speak to an agency about providing out-of-hours coverage, but again it's a sticking plaster over the real issue.
---
We are pushing for additional support from Twitch, but it's proving difficult. I would ask to please share it among your communities - RS YouTuber TheRSGuy has made [a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZbNI8-E2ec) about phishing streams it'd be great to share - and spread awareness, particularly among new players or those returning after some time away. Thanks in advance.
---
Spot on. Some things from that era were good but most don't belong in 07.
---
Roughly 100m using oaks or teaks (myth capes) iirc.

Low dose mushroom simulatot
---
I actually agree but the guy is complaining about losing efficiency from doing a quest so I'm suggesting he skips it and I showed with some quik mafs in a different comment(which maaaay have some errors) that even skipping it saves points in the end if you unlock a block slot.

Swap the brews out for stam pots, and  replace the super restores with soft clay. Otherwise looks pretty good.
---
Keep it short and sweet here otherwise people will assume you are being sarcastic lol. Sometimes a statement needs a tone along with it.
---
You can't get rune gloves?  Other than that, looks ok.
---
Depends on how far back. I remember when r2h and green p hats were both 500k, everyone bought rune longs from the champs guild and didnt wear shields to look rich (rsc).
---
Smh my head crow...
---
When already at level 99 what is the cost of supplies for those items in your house
---
Seems like a good time to merchant from this?
---
My go to would be magic shortbow (i) with rune arrows. They only costs 5gp more than adamant arrows
---
Rgb EVERYTHING
---
Yeah idk what reason that is because it wasnt part of 2007.
---
For starting out might be worth it to bring tank shield, spirit shields aren't super expensive and have no negative mage bonus. 
---
I wouldn't bring an Ava's switch, camp the mage cape.
---
Leaf bladed battle axe for a melee camp.
---
Good luck, get barrows gloves, and if you're very new download exilent to get a hang of freeze timers. When they're unfrozen and in 3 second immunity, it's safe bet to pray melee. 
---
This happens every content release. Makes me wish  I could short sell on the ge

I just did the Arc library without banking. use Runelite's plugin to highlight the book locations , do a run to get an idea where a book is and collect one of every book you find and just run between two people seeking help on the ground floor getting books and handing them in

I can finally get those last 2 wildy pets I’ve been chasing 
---
Meanwhile Aerial fishing receives no love, it remains 0 GP/H - and with each PvM related update skilling is devalued even more. History repeating itself... 
---
I don’t not like it
---
He'll be back there in a month
---
Why do pvpers always need an incentive?
---
Back in the day they had nothing yet you could always watch fight in edgeville, or at the mage bank, or clans fighting at GDZ. Hell even north of Varrock was full of noobs mage pking.
---
Why can't people who want to pvp, just go out together and fight like they used to, what changed?
---
bring more brews 5 or 6 perhaps? also be VERY careful with your AGS, maybe start off with a gmaul or dds because losing that will destroy your motivation
---

My mom would whup my ass if I seriously thought I could get her to spend $20 on a game for me as a kid, let alone 3k
---
You best be setting up that bank pin chief
---
Speak for your self... No leather or claw or tail in 400 kills.
---
This is the real answer. The community was nearly 3x as large as it is today, meaning we had 3x more PvPers back then.
---
It fucked up prayer flicking since prayer also went from 99 to 990
---
Because a shit ton of hastas/spears exist already in game. The same isn't true for the claw to make the lance.
---
Spear from krill is 1/128. It was obvious it was going to crash hard. 
---
Gottem 
---
No shit 
---
For you in sorry :(
---
Lol. You guys are cucks for trolling him. Gratz on the boots brotha.
---
BP max hit with a spec is 0 anyway so this wouldn't be a buff
---
make a pure or other type of pking account
---
Probably because torstols are the rarest herb. They are now dropped by alot more monsters. I've been buying them in past few days though. We'll see where it goes.
---
&gt; Both Ankous and Shadow Warriors drop weapon poison.
---
Both not viable for that account. Shadow warriors you can't access, ankous you can't really kill with those stats.
---
The only real way is to get a weapon poison (+) from ninja implings (which op has done as he has 74 hunter) or to pickpocket a poisoned iron dagger from rogues in deep wilderness.
---
Will we get an apology for the unpolled addition of the mystic recolour? The entire point of oldschool is that no updates will be added in unpolled. This was part of balancing content but never has new content been added without a poll.
---
This is a troubling view of Jagex’s opinion on the integrity of the polling system.
---

---
What is the program that shows the drops and value in the above picture? 
---
hey thanks
---
Sweet, thanks.
---
Hydra boss drops them pretty often and the konar drop tabled used to drop them. Likely just them dropping from a rush of new supply.
---
No, because the Dragon Thrownaxe was introduced with CoX on jan 5th, 2017. They were just more expensive since they weren't as common before the Kebos release, now that Hydras, Wyrms etc. drop them they drop in price.
---
Its not going back anywhere near 20m mate. It already readjusted itself, im surprised its still above 10m tbh. 
---
You kidding? It looks sick! With justiciar on and a big shield like DFS my character is a fucking *unit*
---
Wanna explain for us people who don't care for twitter?
---
no idea why they changed this, yea there was a problem on a first day, but since then it wasn't an issue at all.
---
It's still not ideal, there's some sort of invisible barrier and it stops your character from running until you click to move again. Can we have a proper fix?
---
Yes. They are outclassed by 60 atk piety builds anyway
---
+ when you come back after a break and you miss an update it’s useful to easily enjoy the new content without having to search out exactly what you can do at your level 
---

A text message authentication meathod would be nice too. Surely that would be more secure than email.
---
Can confirm. I don't chew cables anymore.
---

---
Hydra does not use venom, lots of people using super antivenoms (req torstol) are no longer using them because they moved from Zulrah / Vork to hydra.
---
Also farming guild has more people farming them. 
---
We scapers are stuck in time. Time goes by, years pass. But deep down we feel that it was only yesterday that some dude flexing his full Sara at the edge yews got attacked by the evil chicken and everyone united against him. Our mission? To keep that fucking door shut, hoping to pick up his glorious helm, axe and power ammy.
---
Thus making less switches, opening more inventory space, resulting in longer trips, resulting in more GP coming into the game. You're too focused on a single aspect, not on the whole picture, same as people who vote for buffs or nerfs without thinking about the consequences it might lead to.
---
I’m not supportive of the shortcut but instead of moving the death chest, however this statement is retarded. NMZ to 99’s but also 95 slayer for hydra?
---

Imo prayer flicking is a bug and fixing it isn't wrong. I don't want them to fix it, but it should be
---
Dont give in next week, brother.
---
Well of course that 20M won't be reachable but if it reaches 14M and I have 10 of em then I'd punch those numbers into my calculator and it would make a happy face
---
Yes!!
---
Loved his reaction to it too lol
---
Beautiful 
---
If you 3 tick properly there is this moment when the rod "snaps" to you fishing. The new rods that came out didn't have that animation which made it more difficult to time the ticks.
---
That's why everyone turned their 60 atk zerk to a 60atk piety, or just built one...
---
What is your point exactly? That the prices of the runes crashed? Blood rune were around this price at the start of last year, same for death runes. Yes the hydra drops alot of blood/death runes but both runes have seen a meteoric rise in the last year, their price wasn't really sustainable to begin with. The hydra is new content, people are camping it before the uniques stabilize at a lower price and that results in lower prices for the common drops. In the end the price will most likely rebound a bit and stabilize between the prices of last year and the prices before the update. Also 3m+ GP/H for a 95 slayer req isn't unheard off, adding the noted bones wouldn't even add much to the gp per hour, it's more for a little more convience inventory wise and maybe for ironman prayer training. In the end, representing prices like the way you do (on a very short time frame) is misleading and just plain wrong, looking at the big picture its clear that both runes have been overpriced for a while and bringing their price down isn't the worst thing in the world. 
---
Dumbass, the 300 total level requirements is used to prevent massive waves of new bots to influence polls

I just logged to post this! Holy! The middle finger cracks me up

Meanwhile my master wants me to get 85 slayer

ayiza can hate whoever he wants and he's not a mod anymore. just because you work/worked with someone doesn't mean you have to be cool and friends with them. also just because they don't agree on something doesn't mean they hate each other.
---
If somebody else has to spell out the flip for you, you ain’t gunna make it as a flipper lol
---
Not in the UK. It's £7 cheaper to buy premier or £4.59 a month which isn't too bad at all honestly. 
---
nah bro im not trying to scam anyone, still getting 500k margins on elder mauls check out ge-tracker or osbuddy, im merching them right now
---
I’m sorry you’re new 
---
The majority of people I know who started the game back up again want to do some sort of PvP content. They usually watch Torvesta even if they're brand new, want to know what to do about the defense and prayer etc. on a fresh main account. Most people remember the Wilderness pretty fondly - PvP draws a ton of players in, let's try not to kill it.
---
Same.
---
I don't play as much as before, but fuck if they brought back the 2008-2010 aesthetic, I would play more.
---
Michael RS in his video analyzes the Jmod post about this,
---
I'm just using windows default settings about controlling the mouse with keys. No scripts and shit. Every input is a keystroke.
---
I'm doing around 30 keystrokes per second, this is not comfy at all, it's more effort tbh
---
I know its not konars table, but please take bloods out of hydra table. Bloods dropped so much in price, its not even worth doing bloods anymore despite of how afk it is. Also why let slayer people get more bloods, but take out 10% boost in bloods from diary?
---
Definitely was still really annoying on higher population worlds. They should have just done the stronghold style doors.
---
Lol I’ve yet to see something that exciting 
---
r/woosh
---
Depends on your budget and playstyle.
---
Keep in mind you can always sell arma/ang/pegs. 
---
I couldn't get a hydra task (3k points in skips and 10+ konar tasks) so I've been doing zulrah instead. Scales are currently 220 each so I'm making a fortune
---
Why don’t ya go on and tell me how I’m raising my cat wrong like it fucking matters how you raise a cat. Does your cat speak English too and does your high school English papers for you too? 
---
No wonder you’re an illiterate etard, train yourself better instead of your cat :) 
---
Which is why ferocious gloves would be fine on a zerker. The difference in power level is great enough that even an 80 attack zerker would still be multiple max hits behind an equivalent 60 atk piety build.
---
Eheheheheheh slowly going into rs3
---
Welcome to power creep.
---
surely you jest
---
Bright side is my infernal attempts are getting cheaper every day.

I'm excited to find out.  The DK rings can maintain a higher than alch value price because you imbue them into BIS rings. But who knows!

I just didn't find him entertaining and his attitude toward new content (that he'd not even tried) ticked me off. That's just me though, if you like his stuff that's great.
---
Ah that makes sense
---
As someone who hates skilling I don't feel your pain but I can imagine if they didn't release new pvm content I'd hate it.  So in that light I'm sorry my friend.
---
so there's big risk for him in everything yes
---
So the unique weapon from a level 95 task only Slayer boss is only allowed to be BIS in two places? It's laughably bad against dragons when compared to the DHCB or even Twisted Bow, which was supposed to be it's entire purpose.
---
I dont want to sound completely ignorant but how does ball cancer kill you
---
For mining in general it increases the chance of finding gems. 
---
When gem mining specifically it drastically increases the speed that you mine the rocks. 
---
I support this update. 
---
Nice!
---
bet you're too retarded to do 1 vork kill
---
Yep, late 2007/early 2008 was when I started. I was just a little boy getting sucked into an addiction that I didn't even know existed. 
---
You need to use ultracompost. 
---
Increased chance of getting uncut gems up to diamond (1/256 to 1/86). And drastically faster mining of gem rocks.
---
If only we had more grils to check for us
---
love you enjoy the hammer
---
I've been following the optimal quest guide for like 3 months and just finished legends quest and doing the easy diaries... but to be fair I play 1-3 hours a day.
---
I'd say a MINIMUM of a dozen discussion threads are created daily. You probably just browse the first page of hot though. Get your life together and quit bemoaning non issues. 
---
Wow there are still people out there using osbuddy lmao
---
Spreads to vital organs.
---
the bastards
---
This would be fantastic to see.
---
or you know, it could be because he showed an awful lot of gratitude while thanking someone for taking their time when said someone only used a few words
---
Used it for 5 years, still no reason to switch. Plus runelite hacks users 😂
---
"Free mouse auto clicker" bake em away toys 
---
Exactly, they don't want improved security just more notifications about being hacked. Like wtf.
---
Should I not care about the integrity of the game? Should I just forget that the whole reason oldschool exists is because we don’t trust the jmods to make the correct decisions (see rs3)?
---
Too OP, please try again.
---
Thanks!
---
nice idea full support
---
Not really. I calculated the chance to get a pet and it was just about the average drop rate. That's because I don't do standard tree runs where there is a much ratio between the chance for pet and the XP you get. Standard tree runs also skew the numbers massively because you can do them much more often than fruit trees, calquat, and hardwood. If you do that, you end up in the scenario where the 50% chance for pet lies around double what it took me.
---
I did a combined daily run consisting of papaya, calquat, and herbs, as well as mahogany every 4 days. I was very consistent and I don't think I missed more than a total of 10-15 days. Assuming no deaths, which is not correct, but not too far off as I protected the papaya trees, my chance to get a pet within a year was:
---
From Calquat: 9.45%
---
From fruit trees (all fruit trees have the same chance for pet): 23.53%
---
From hardwood (teak and mahogany also have the same chance): 8.58%
---
Added together, the chances are 36.70%
---
For two years, that figure is increased to 59.99%
---
I cannot guarantee that my maths was correct; statistics was never my strongest suit. However, I do believe I did the calculations correctly. Unfortunately, I only saved the results and not the actual calculations, and I'm too lazy to go back and redo them.
---
I also calculated them for 5 years and 10 years. That showed up as 89.84% and 98.97%, respectively. 10 years would get you very close to 200m as well. I think it would take about 12 years, so this method basically guarantees pet before 200m, which you definitely cannot say for standard tree runs.
---
The same way most cancers do?
---
Or if each finger represented a head
---
Make it so the skill flashes when you get lvl and you get this scroll when clicking it 
---
I also dont know how most cancers do.

you can buy water filled vials in packs already so i don’t think it’d be very profitable. jugs would be though 
---
Could also just use an overlay to hide that, since the camera position is static.
---
Seems like a great idea until soneone starts spamming you with recovery attempts.
---
Any other ideas then? 
---
That could work but think the details would be so small wouldn't look so clear and probably blurred 
---
God forbid people actually play the game.

Are you 2b bank? You got 16m slayer XP? No?

Waay too op, only thing i agree with is the last part
---
There is alot of us here in the Obby Community that feel you guys have slapped us in the face, we finally get something we can grind for &amp; you take it away &amp; you constantly give ridiculous items to other pvp builds to pk with why take away a fish that did 0 harm to the community. We are literally asking for a +0 Attack fish back...some of us spend 10+ hours trying to get it.

It metastasizes, spreads from your balls to everywhere else.

I support but Konars drop table is pretty chill rn. I wish I played the first night when values were insane. I love the idea of the Slayer equipment but the passives r a little op I think. Any thoughts on a nerf? Cool idea man
---
pack up boys
---
Not sure if itd work but have you tried using filtered game chat?
---
I think theres a filter for that
---
I don't get it. Send help.
---
Some initial feedback: This feels really bad gameplay wise. You click in an area that's behind one of these invisible barriers and either path into a wall or are unexpectedly stopped on the other side of the open doors. Any player who hasn't read the patch notes/complaints pre-patch will find this really unintuitive.
---
I'm definitely not. I got two other accounts I'd like to do it on and would love to knock some hunter out at the same time. 
---
Right click "game" chat and select "filter".
---
Grats man I should hit 99 this upcoming Monday 
---
Cheers mate, done it now :)

Daily reminder broke Bois without tbow complain about range meta

Why would you want to make it again ?
---
Do you know the e-mail that is was registered to?
---
Good thing you found a post on reddit to tell you
---
Not gonna lie. 
---
Cost of turning it into planks 
---
Well, those 2 rooms have farming level reqs to them, so the invisble barriers check for that before you can move through
---
What is the best way to improve my magic stats?
---
Blowpipe, I did it with 43 prayer exactly. Look up the spawn rotations and you can save a ton of prayer with proper planning, Id get to Jad with at least 4 super restores left each time I made it there. What gear are you using?

Wait I've had my Asus for about 5 and a half years and he's still chugging along pretty well, please don't tell me his time near :'(

Jagex should consider selling Jad clocks as merch. This is pretty neat.

I would make a pure to pk on, easy to train, and alot of guides on then. You can even start pking on it within the first 2 days!
---
Shit I was wondering why I was getting so many gems when I was mining iron lol
---
Doubtful. It's not very good to begin with and now it's fairly common.
---
no unfortunatly not, I always logged in with my usernames.
---
Where would u expect it to settle? 
---
They fired Jed already, there should be nothing else in the way...
---
The q and a literally said the exact opposite. They said they will wait and see.
---
&gt; The Golden Tench can be stored in the Magic Wardrobe.
---
...I don't know what to make on this. It is kinda nice you can store it somewhere, but why does a fish go in the Magic Wardrobe? Magic Robes goes in the Armor Case, Fish go in the Magic Wardrobe, and nothing is added to the Fancy Dress Box; the Costume Room makes no sense anymore...
---
The lance defo needs a buff.
---
the dhcb is better at most places because of its 10% more dmg and acc amd plus you can use bolts which take down 20% of the life points.
---
defo needs a buff, they made a poll to see what people think and 56% said buff it so its clear what the people of rs wants.
---
the people saying it doesnt need a buff are the same people who only use it at raids and want a nice cheap wep to kill olm hand with if they try and use it anywhere else apart from rune drags they will see the dhcb shits on the lance.
---
hmm interesting I will try it now! thanks.
---
Now with a single droplet of water on your screen, you’ll be able to mine without tapping!
---
Same. Was 7 years old.
---
U arent supposed to click this far
---
200, maybe 300k. The only reason I don't think it'll drop lower than that is because it has no quest requirements and I think it is a bit better than a d long.
---
Jmod just confirmed it was true that someone hijacked the account through email 
---
1 kc jad pet checking in! 
---
It's hard to say for sure but I would guess that it was somehow leaked, along with his email and the password for that email account.
---
stupid ape lmao
---
How do you forget your slayer helm? You spawn with it after you die 
---
4100+ kills and No Pet.. This hurts 
---
Use ultracompost, my dude. I get 7 ranarrs minimum at 55 farming, and sometimes as much as 13.
---
The door is closed for you. 
---
I'm disgusted you don't already have one. I usually get mine at 85 combat, 70/70/70 melee, 40 pray, and I'm sure there's one guy who got one at 13 combat or something silly.
---
#BuildTheWall!
---
Using ancient magic to burst and barrage is a common tactic at high levels. 
---
In super early levels, though, a lot of people "splash" combat spells for afk experience. Splashing curse instead is really good experience early, but it's really click intensive. After that people generally go to superheat and alching. 
---
Spamming Camelot teleport is a common way to train and, if you want to make some money for reduced experience, you can always make teleport tablets in someone's PoH in Rimmington.
---
I really enjoyed osbuddy pro when I paid for it and used it, a few bugs here and there but no big deal. However, since switching to runelite there have been less bugs, more features, and great weekly updates.
---
I highly recommend you bite the bullet, try out runelite. I'm not saying osbuddy has wronged you or ever will wrong you, but I think you'd enjoy runelite more.
---
If you ever try it, lmk i'll recommend you some of the best plugins.

---
Consider nerfing the blowpipe so other weapons are used? Buff ranged def on a lot of mobs even by a bit so melee is better? A lot of end game mobs will tribrid you when you melee versus 2 styles when ranging, and when you add the blowpipe or even tbow in the mix you just range everything.
---
Killing Vorkath with the Lance requires you to stutter-step constantly so you can force it to not melee, it's so much more effort and more dangerous than ranging.

Would be cool, but now I can't claim someone is botting.
---
so your only argument is that you collect them? do you see how self centered that is? did you expect nothing to ever come to replace the small amount of blessing? not even just another blessing, anything that goes in the slot that gives you a slightly better use would replace it and make the price crash, you want them to stop introducing items in that slot so your collection doesn't lose value? are you serious?
---
I'm not a pvper so he is what I know about the mechanics and why this would be a great addition to obby Mauler pvpp. The golden tench had a speed of 3 which is an attack every 1.8 seconds. A 4 speed weapon such as the the Slayer staff which is commonly used by obby maulers attacks every 2.4 seconds. The strength and attack stats of the Slayer staff and much higher than the golden tench and event rpg maker, but the stats are neglible since it is out dps'd by the speed of a 3 attack weapon. The obby maul is used to finish a pvper while the event rpg maker/golden tench are to lower the health of an opponent to range of the obby maul. Please correct me if I am wrong.

Here's ~~Ryan Reynolds~~ Deadpool to explain how to check yourself

---
Imagine the xp drop from an ice barrage or chin.....could max in no time. That’s how they could truly contribute
---
Nice idea, I am always a little sad when I get the level up popup and it disappears right away cause I was clicking still.
---
I refuse to believe this is OP’s. I have the rift guardian and that recolor is for blood runes, which he doesn’t even have high enough RC for.
---
People would assume that color is for fire runes, but the red is much brighter.
---
That's not an issue with the lance, that's an issue with the fact that range is OP
---
And 2010 Graphics. 
---
What who said that? Not me
---
F is for flash you monster. D is for damage
---
You sir, Have been absolutely fucking destroyed by our community. Good day.

In the two highest gp/hr pvm activities, raids 1 (7.5m/hr) and raids 2 (11-13m/hr), this item suggestion wouldn't have any of the problems you've listed.
---
In Raids 1, the ring would mean you can take more brews in but if you're competent at raids, you'll normally only use 2-3 brews per olm. In Raids 2, the ring would replace the berserker ring and you'd keep the same number of switches. As there's no noticeable dps difference, the raids would take roughly the same amount of time. Any other activity than these would be less efficient in making money for a person in pvm. At Vorkath, this ring wouldn't be any different to an archers ring. At zulrah this ring would be more beneficial than a seers ring, but many people would only use a suffering. At hydra, ring of the gods is BIS for kills/hr. This ring would likely mean less kills/hr = less gp/hr. For other slayer bosses, their gp/hr is already so insignificant that this ring would have no any impact on their gp/hr. There's no other PvM activity to note that generates as much gp as I've mentioned above, where again, the ring would have little to no effect and certainly wouldn't validate the claims you've made.
---
In fact, it would be more beneficial for the game to have this ring exist. This is considering the amount of DKS/wilderness rings there are in game which would be deleted, making those activities more profitable than they are now; while also removing gp from the game as a cost to use this item.
---
Nah, he can use a normal rock hammer. There are are Rock Thrownhammers which might work in this case
---
No balls you won’t ?
---
Found the non-American
---
I'm not and I didn't know this
---
I don't think it's intended to shame them really, more like pointing out something odd/unique/rare. It's not the 'right' way to do it but it's still people having fun so I like seeing these posts. Reminds me of when I was a noob and didn't know anything, but still had a blast :p
---
Fuck that! This is OSRS
---
Uh
---
They tried this on a design steam a while ago and the reason it’s not like that is because they thought it looked too much like sock puppets.
---
I’m not a fan of the current design, but I’m also not sure how to improve it tbh
---
Besides the people who were hacked via jed. 99% of the time it’s the players fault. Usually I’d say 100% but after seeing the Nelsi thread people will go a long extent. Your friend was probably ratted. If his email password was leaked I’m fairly sure a lot of his other info was too. Probably including another password that had his 4 digit pin. Your friend most likely didn’t have 2fa on his email which makes it somewhat his fault. But then again there should be a Authenticator delay.

I had an awkward time picturing this at work, fucking hell 
---
Not that, the tutorial island guy
---
Ive had a varicocele in my left nut since 5+ years ago so it feels like all of these checks all the time but it's not testicular cancer.  Depending what I'm doing and on the temperature my left can be way bigger in size and I can even feel my heart beat in my sack when I lay down sometimes. 
---
I just used melee defense gear myself because only one brother can hit you and hes melee, I dont believe any of them have magic defense aside from the ranger maybe. I used mage on all and range on the mage. Theres a lot of guides that have gear recommendations that would probably be better, that worked for me but I'm sure there are better choices 
---
No they can't ya dingus. 
---
It's got the same -50 crush bonus as all other fun weapons. 
---
They made that mistake before and they aren't going to make it again. 
---
Yes! And also the flashing/flickering skill icons if they've leveled up.
---
It's not common. Data gathered by PvM clans indicates that it's probably a 1/1000 drop.
---
I would actually expect the price to go up, as the flow of claws into the game will slow down a hell of a lot as people use up the slayer points that they banked before the update.
---
*fondles testicles for 5 hours*
---
i still don't know if i have ball cancer or not
---
i think you'd probably lose a bit but for getting magic exp, i think it's a small price to pay
---
This is his 3rd time going through cancer treatment. He had cancerous tumors through his chest a few years after his first testicle was removed. And now this? Man, fuck cancer. 
---
Was surprised I hadn’t seen any other comments saying the same. Almost completely invalidates prayer gear or p pots on 98% of tasks.
---
why isn't jad level 720 if they double every time?
---
The quest guide was not much help, atleast from what i could see. It tells you the stats you need to start the quest but doesn't really mention the combat stats that are needed. i will PM you my in game name now.

Because being under the drop rate isnt really a good comprehension of how it works. 
---
I looked up what RFD gives you for rewards too. Across all eight sub-quests and the final battle you get:
---
* 9 Quest Points
---
* 28,000 cooking XP
---
* 27,000 other XP (10k of which is Agility)
---
* a lamp for 20,000 XP in any skill of your choice 
---
* Access to absolutely top-tier gloves (Barrows Gloves) 
---
* Access to some lesser-tier gloves like Rune Gloves useful for PKing
---
* Some other rewards (like teleport to Ape Atoll spell)
---
The reward for completing Architectural Alliance is.....
---
* A teleport on a talisman. 
---
pfft noob
---
Looks good, when was this around anyways? I don’t remember anything like this.
---
Too bad that's blocked on my wifi.
---
Took it with my phone 
---
The tree wasn’t meant for you, William.
---
Oh dude this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for, thanks a lot! I appreciate you getting this to me:) If you happened to have followed this guide how long do you think it took you from start to finish?
---
Runelite is free..?
---
Wow, I never knew it was so complex an equation!  Thanks for the explanation.
---
im membs with over 2B lol
---
pple often fail to realize that better f2p content means the game is (more) accessible and attractive to new players
---
Only a 2k+ kill count with none of them as drops, and that much time spent watching others rarely get them.
---
i did enjoy this back in the day. 
---
My only confusing with checking yourself is that it's really hard to tell in the area that has all those veins connecting to each nut. Like how do I know that little area is ok.....
---
I bought rigour at 115m and don't regret it one bit
---
The trade window showed something like 7m on my side and something like 9m on their side, I just thought ez 2m 
---
YES YES YES
---
Woodcutting, fletching, crafting, thieving, fishing, cooking, mining, bursting/chinning, NMZ combat training
---
Thanks for pointing this out - there are more items than I could think of off the top of my head. 
---
Just want to note that for many of these, there is cost involved. For some ornament kits, i.e. steam staff and I believe malediction/odium wards, you lose the kit. For tentacle / SS, you lose something too. For zamorakian hasta, you revert for free but have to pay 300k to turn it back into a hasta. For imbued rings, you lose a % of the nmz points.
---
I'd never planted one before I got a contract to so I just thought this was normal.
---
Forgot this existed, yes please
---
If it seems to good to be true, it usually is.
---
I moved to Telegram, it looks less nice but has true multi device, open source and add free, and super nice features like being able to share files up to 1.5GB
---
The menu function free on osb too. 
---
you had to pay for these in osbuddy i believe
---
Back in the day it was nice when you leveled up, missed the scroll because you were doing a function, but could still click and see the scroll because your level blinked. 
---
No way. Poor guy, I thought losing one was enough but both now? I feel bad for him. 
---
That area is what I was questioning. Thanks.
---
demonic gorillas aren't a boss
---
I'll check it out, thank you! 
---
Hey this was me :)
---
They called it a neerf but it was a buff.  you can use it to box now.
---
This screenshot hurts my brain
---
The fact of the matter is he probably did. He didn’t have his email secured with 2fa  on a maxed account. It’s his fault not anyone else’s. 2fa on email is much more secure cuz it’s done through texts and can’t be disabled as easily. All tho it would be nice for a delay kids shouldn’t be crying to much when there is a huge vital step they didn’t take into securing there account 
---
The top image was 10 years ago.
---
don't worry, the guy you saw in the stream didn't come up with the idea aswell
---
cute, 95% you say alright that means you still have 5% space to play around thats 40 items for you to play around.
---
Ah right. Kind of forget that osb still exists lol
---
Probs cause Demonics aren't a boss, but I agree that none should be allowed.
---
when i see this much blanked out it makes me think this person botting hard as fuck lmao
---
Community of communist autists? Damn man you guys got me beat. How will I ever recover?
---
Just hop to the world after you get to kbd
---
Welp, everyone get out your Rich level 3 skillers and let's go max slayer! Golden Crush Fish 2K19
---
Now I'm stuck with no ward, no fury and no money to get them again 😂 
---
I don't watch anime, what's that?
---
You need to hang on. We’re talking about jagex. Don’t assume anything 
---
spectres are a great task once you get a herb sack though
---
I wish I was that cave crawler 
---
Absolutely, agreed
---
This post did not age well.
---
I have a main too. Just a thought is that it should just be buyable. 
---
&gt;dying is the biggest XP waste of all.
---
🐠 🐠 🐠 
---
Ah, gotcha! I did get BIS mage gear to try and do it that way from tries 10-30. I even did Mage arena 2 :P I felt like I wasn't doing enough damage some times and a lot some other times. I eventually got frustrated and decided to swap to ranged, which is a little higher level (85 as to 81). I used dragon darts the last time which really helped my dps. 
---
Definitely still a nerf. 
---
Ketchup packet. That’ll balance it out. 
---
G.E is gonna look like a game of musical chairs.
---
Did you do Dragon Slayer to enable pet drops?
---
I became a master farmer because of this guild, i'm only level 68 farming but I will get 99 because of this place
---
Would idd be a real shame if they left aerial fishing to die. Aerial fishing is a great example of a fun, high-effort method that also has a little bit of decision making added into it. That's the kind of content OSRS needs more of imo and having it be undesirable simply because it's not super appealing to the average OSRS player sucks.
---
Is it actually better than tyranical for accuracy? I don't know a lot about it
---
Learn how to count
---
I didn't know people cared that much about something so miniscule.
---
Started in 2008, I know what you mean. 
---
I think it would be neat if they could still hear it while in the house.
---
The point is moot though since it's just going to be Sea Shanty 2 on repeat
---
I thought he was compensating me for it not being a gold trade, and aye I am
---
This is far from the worst scam I fell for back in the day
---
Lol. Rip.
---
The mystic recolor is also basically a graphical change.
---
If you go to his past broadcasts he has done many subscriber only giveaways, this is nothing new. 
---
Sid the kid baby, fuck the caps 
---
Maybe they could change it back to the doors being locked until you have the appropriate farming level to enter that area and after you open them they are permanently open?
---
It doesn't make sense gameplay wise nor lore wise, you would be locked to whatever house you choose so you can't do it (unless you want to spend 30m-1h to get favour back) rendering 4 out of 5 houses already more dead content than it already is .
---
Then wouldn't it be better to suggest changing the respawn location for house deaths? 
---
Or a pj timer after tp to account for load times so you're not immediately banged out.
---
*gets pm from random person
---
“Hey to unlock the sleeping emote you have to go to the double xp stream on twitch and sign in”

Makes sense now when he said this is a good thing. We all know its a very bad thing to DC, but what a chap for seeing the positive side!

Q
---
Please stop
---
Slayer rewards for unlocking mithril dragons, red dragons, and lizardmen do not list Konar as a possible master.
---
Imagine balancing new gear requirements around pures. This will only affect pures since most people who will consider buying ferocious gloves will already have the defense level, and changing requirements because of pures sets a bad precedent when it comes to future updates.
---
If lost, you can make a new one by buying a Sample bottle from the General Store in Canifis, obtaining a Thin snail and using it with a Pestle and mortar, combining the Blamish snail slime with a Harralander potion(unf) to make Blamish oil then use it on a Fishing rod.
---
I'd assume the fact that there's only one of the strong monster makes it a boss, right? Kraken, GWD, Cerb, Hydra are all standalone compared to a dungeon full of gorillas
---
Now he can pk in  no balls mode 
---
This was never in OSRS - it came to the main game after 2007 so OSRS didn't start with it, and it hasn't been polled since.
---
Get her up in the 70s or 80s and you should be set. Shouldn’t take too long tbh
---
Great ideas, would love to be able to get slayer masters equipment. However the prayer effects are insanely powerful. Even if they don’t stack the shield alone could break the game beyond belief.
---
People don't want bis content everytime a new update comes out. Excessive powercreep isn't good.
---
i'll try it on my suicide only HCIM 
---
Honestly no, the "eye towers" take forever to kill without one. I'd just get the extra shard and save yourself time and supplies
---
r/itswooooshwith4Os
---
lmao xp waste nerd just do slayer and farm bosses like everyone else 
---
It's super afk and they drop hard clues frequently. They're some of my favorite tasks post herb sack. Rock full prayer and just afk for 5 minutes at a time. No idea why this guy doesn't like them.
---
It's called common sense lmfao if I ask u for you bank account information because I'm gonna give u a few grand would you give it? Of course not, unless you are retarded which people falling for these scams obviously are so it's no big deal if they get scammed, they deserved it. Ain't nobody gonna fucking give u anything especially not sparkm4cliiiive56 I'm sorry dude but if you or anyone else falls for these scams I have no pity. It's all dumb greedy fuckers who get scammed.
---
Well now you know.  In-game values can only move up or down 5% a day so the recommended value isn't always accurate.
---
Give us the option to turn it off, but have it on by default and i would vote yes. I remember this feature as just annoying but im sure new players would like it
---
That's what I was thinking, thanks!
---
They save automatically.
---
idk he probably made a ton of money during the journey to 63 fletching.
---
Furious pete also takes joy in killing animals and admits so himself. He is a psychopath. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb7sirpr6Uo
---
Also his cancer is directly caused by his diet.
---
Needs to be other ways to incentivize pking. this isn't it. Perhaps more tournaments that offer gp/xp (not better than the best rates - but still fairly decent) weekly or monthly. Something but not this. 
---
Basically because jagex doesnt want to. Mod ash said it would hurt his pride to do updates that way. 
---
Those are only 80k now?
---
lets just do what atlas did. whenever anyone logs off they leave a sleeping body behind that takes up a spot on the server and acts as an entity. Now we can see everyone whos offline in an mmo and places like lumby castle wont be laggy at all /s
---
Yo shout out to this guy! Everyone check your monkey nuts STAT!
---
If you look at the 6 month, its still above what it was prior to this update hype. I can see it falling back to those prices. I'd be tempted to sell now before losing even more.
---
i feel like he was being sarcastic and pointing out that it was a newer feature than 2007
---
There's a lizardman task that you can do anywhere. The molch specific task is for lizardman shamans, and can only be the ones in the temple.
---
Do the north east shamans in the temple not count for that task? Or were you confused? 
---
Wait, I'm not against osb. I'm saying I never see posts about new players downloading the osb client then posting here to reddit saying they got hacked, and all they did was download the client. Osb used to be a damn bot, I do not doubt people have been hacked from it in the past. But I dont see it happening or none is complaining about it here. 
---
Make it so that the animation doesn't work in the Wilderness or on PVP worlds then?
---
Was it this? https://imgur.com/gallery/dDYYr
---
/u/JagexGambit I'd like to hear your thoughts on this if possible.
---
Does the text for the item move or does it stay in the same place? Wish I had this when I was chinning and bursting in mm2 caves. 
---
I'm a new mobile player. Very few people enjoy mtx
---
Unique idea (monsters that move locations), I like it.
---
Y
---
This was never in OSRS. Very few features that came to the main game after 2007 have made it back into old school.
---
Yeah
---
I agree, fuck the caps but you can’t hate Ovi man. Glad he finally got his cup.
---
a basic crossbow with bronze bolts? Please make a f2p char and try that. You would need ridiculously higher stats then the expected 40s, if its even possible given the defensive gear and food available to f2ps. (Also remember that prayer gets drained quickly during the fight)
---
Wasted so many pendant charges forgetting seeds...
---
Why would it matter what weapon they use?
---
How does Kob have barrows gloves
---
This doofus frequents The_Donald lol. That explains it.
---
Every time I get a gargoyle task, I sit there auto attacking my first kill at 1 hp for 2 minutes until I relapse I forgot my hammer.
---
Why is this shit allowed and Jagex does nothing. If you waarent going to ban 3rd parties at least give us QOL updates like this. Smfh 
---
Yeah that’s what I was talking about. I haven’t seen the clip but adding RNG to shooting means people get lucky sometimes and get lasered. Guys probably complaining about nothing
---
To be fair, Architectual Alliance also gives all the benefit house favour gives. Definitely don't mind a free 10k rc xp though.
---
My 2008 dreams were to have a fire cape and a godsword. I've accomplished both on osrs main, now working toward godsword on ironman :')
---
Thanks!!
---
Yup you gotta wait 1 month
---
\&gt; I have no plans to play members content until I play through a lot of the f2p stuff. 
---
The fun starts here. gl :)
---
He is 
---
Maybe the doors can be there until you unlock the level to enter then pay 5k gp to unlock that section of the guild (removing the door completely once it’s unlocked)
---
It was a post about why he was quitting. Kids would fall for that no problem. Your mindset is from someone who knows better which makes you sound retarded. Of course people like you and me know it’s a scam. Impressionable kids who don’t know better might need to be told. Again take the stick out of your ass and chill out. There was no reason for you comment on this post the way you did besides look like a tool who wants to flaunt his giant brain at not following for something adults wouldn’t fall for.  
---
Not everyone is from the same country as you are, mate. It's common to use periods to separate places and commas to serve as a decimal point in many Spanish-speaking countries. How are you going to tell someone how to write numbers just because your system says it's done a particular way?
---
Way to OP. 
---
love it
---
Konar is suppose to be more Gp/hr with the special drop table, but decreases exp an hour with the sub-optimal locations that are required to slay in.
---
So if going for GP Konar is best.
---
Best of luck homie, you got this
---
It's almost as if... by gosh some people play the game for fun! The nerve of them hey! 
---
do you have experience selling stolen info or what? why would your knowledge be relevant? 
---
people have been using database leaks for years to steal rs accounts, clearly its profitable enough for them to continue to do it.
---
Fair. Like most peoples desk. I thought I was missing something
---
There were people using diangos claws, smite, and like 15 people throwing snowballs lol it was chaos. My friend Lipalow who we focused on started using that item that drains your hp to make it look like they were hurting him lol it was quite the experience. 
---
Was expecting spear pole dancing, but this is nice too.
---
Me and my mates have been checking each others for years
---
&gt;I believe white lillies wither and die after a certain period?
---
really? other flowers don't, where did you hear this
---
&gt;white lillies end up saving the 10% (iirc) of herbs thatd die in non protected patches w/ a standard ultracompost. Unless you are farming expensive herbs then saving the herb hardly matters.
---
flowers only protect allotment patches not herb patches right?

You can reduce the framerate in one of the in game tabs, maybe try that and see if it helps?
---
It is no different then the fact you have been able to download mods for WOW for ages and no one has a problem with that. Sure blizzard implaments QOL just like jagex but these companys have to much going on to make 1000 little changes and updates that sometimes require many hours to get working correctly and that some players dont want. Runelite is basically just a mod pack for osrs, it gives some players an advantage in certain scenarios but everyone has the ability to gain those advantages. Not to mention if jagex started throwing in highlightable boxes and changing how a lot of the UI and interface work there would be non stop complaining on this sub.
---
Third? I must be behind on the times. 
---
Get out of NMZ
---
Yeah, you can TP inside but if your house is shit, then...
---
Yes, I know you can logout and go to 330 or 318 or whatever, but the amount of time that takes vs. being able to enter someone else's house (for me, that's my main...what's the point in spending 40M again for 83 con) is shitty if you're looking to get back into the fight.
---
It's a risk for sure, but it's pretty much a 100% chance of 'you're fucked', considering that they can unload specs on you nonstop the moment they see you. You can't even fight them either, as after they dump specs they just go into their own house to do it all over again.
---
I don’t think the OSRS depiction of redwoods is entirely accurate lol
---
I'll pass your thanks onto Mod Munro
---
I don’t do them on my main because it takes too much extra time for such a small gp increase. Do em on my iron tho..
---
I just meant why he grew fast
---
In the options there's a setting for fps capping. You might be capped at a low number. Being uncapped fps will kill your battery fast though. 
---
Diversity in account builds is what keeps this game alive.  This fish was perfectly “balanced” and had its niche.  It sucks to see it go.  Now it’s 100% dead content.
---
You are the same with 1 as 2; I had my first removed and then the 2nd a year later and didn't need to start hormone therapy until the 2nd one came out.
---
'Chynistry' cc you can also ask him on his twitch channel
---
8 new blast furnace worlds? Was there really that much of a need for them?
---
bf needs to git gud and use all fingers one hand to osrs and other hand for this girl
---
Is it the wrench icon with 15, 20, 30, and Max? If it is, I was running at Max 
---
The client itself doesn't have any value, anyone can work on it
---
white lillies protect the entire area.
---
&gt;really? other flowers don't, where did you hear this
---
someone mentioned it on discord, however i haven't had any drops yet and its not mentioned on the wiki so idk maybe that isnt correct.
---
I can take a loot pic when I get home but I've used up a good amount of them 
---
I still don't like how the gloves look. Weird color scheme IMO. 
---
People on the official client are dwindling compared to Runelite. People have long wanted Jagex to release an official osb/rl type of client, but it will likely never happen. It's like playing ironman mode, but with your client.  
---
You should at least be able to build three subwoofers in each room.
---
Fewer
---
i still say "uhh" when thinking out loud in a foreign language, some things are innate, ive had eastern euro profs do their weird quotation marks but i leave em be cos who cares, they afford me the same allowances
---
This devalues all the content creators who time up their level up clips.
---
I guess she never misses huh. 
---
Casually mistook your sarcasm and tried to help- you don’t have to be a cunt about it
---
Gargs are 3x gp/hr of spectres you moron, bursting nechs is even money. You're a fucking cry baby, wahhh i dedicate all my time to this game and i still have no idea what im talking about so ill flame anyone more knowledgeable than me. Enjoy they 1500 worlds shitter.
---
Konar is only better gp/hr on tasks that wouldn't make you any realistic profit (example: hellhounds) otherwise due to being able to knock out tasks more efficiently you'll typically make better profit/hr doing Duradel at the moment.
---
Agreed. It really hits those reward centers in my noggin
---
No. Wrong game. 
---
No. Wrong game.
---
Man I forgot how crazy it was excitedly hoping that a rich guy would die to the evil chicken only to watch them mercilessly slaughter it 
---
now that you say it, its very obvious this should be the the case. Also would allow me to do slayer with a fish in my hand which is enough to make me go do some aerial fishing
---
So what does that mean? Is it cancerous/harmful, what is the treatment.
---
It does feel like a small pointy bump. When I looked at diagrams, the epididmysis does start with a small pointy bump at the bottom.
---
Imo Konar can suck ass, e.g. hellhounds in taverly dunge or blue drags in Kourend or black demons in taverly dunge - can't even do gorilla demons.
---
And for a drop rate of value like average 80k once in like 100, not worth it.
---
As someone who just bought a herb sack I'd have to say no to that haha
---
I agree :) 
---
Incorrect new gen playing osrs
---
Poor mark simeone, he's gone full retard
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeee! Why does everyone hate quests?!
---
In fact, after our little conversation, I've decided to be true to my flair and start completing the ones that I've been too scared or too lazy to do to get my quest cape back. I did the Arceus house quest today, then I just need to finish a couple of the other house quests, a tale of hope, making friends with my arm and then finally man up and finish Dragon Slayer 2.

200 IQ I lien this, but also make the LVL 85 bank unusable till LVL 85 
---
Realscape LOL
---
I’m reporting you for being a noob
---
Flowers always have protected only the allotments. White lilies are no different (my herbs still die even in its presence)
---
Elves are in the game.
---
Lmao, you're flaming me you shit. I literally said abereants aren't bad which they aren't. You just took that shit personally. Nice bait m8
---
On my ironman I got dragon gloves in 1-2 weeks while persuing other goals. The requirements are surprisingly low for most of it. 
---
I'm sad to see that you didn't do anything about the "You're stunned." message I get spammed with 10 times every hydra fight when it starts flame phase. It's an eye sore and really clutters up the chat box unnecessarily.
---
Ferocious gloves looks nice now
---
Realistically they should just buy the rl client for however much it costs, would they sell for 200K euro?
---
You can do this right now with an insanely overpowered glitch. If you go to your equipment screen you can click your weapon and it will unequip your weapon to your inventory and it won't show up on your character. Please don't tell anyone about this because I don't want to be banned for major exploit abuse.
---
&gt;white lillies protect the entire area.
---
are you 100% sure? where are you getting this from? wiki says, and common sense would suggest (due to effect of other flowers) that they only protect allotments
---
if they protected herb patches as well that would be op as fuck as you'd get another 3 on top of the already existing 3 disease free herb patches just for keeping a lily planted there
---
Engine rework

---
should have done the hard clues. made 3m off my last hound task, not including konar drops
---
Based on my friend's yield increase it seems to be anywhere from 0%-100%.
---
People in 365/420 might let you +1. You probably have to have the combat lvl to keep them above the 115 average tho 
---
Im not upset about it, its just a weird double standard
---
How?
---
Or just a female with a messy background bruuh. Doesn’t this say more about you than about me?:)
---
&gt; Curse of the empty lord literally gives a 10k xp lamp and other miniquests have xp rewards. I have no clue what you're talking about.
---
No it doesnt. Stop making stuff up. Youre clueless.
---
&gt; But it's not for no reason, which has already been explained to you by multiple people. It's being added as one of the rewards has been added as a base effect, and the rewards weren't that great in the first place.
---
Yes it is for no reason. You can just claim that it is for a reason but that reason is terrible. "I want XP lamps to be dropped from PVM so I dont have to skill, hellhounds have terrible drops so why not!!" thats a reason as well, and a better reason than what you suggested, yet, its a terrible reason and I will therefore completely dismiss it.
---
&gt; Gear did not provide dps back then, so defensive bonuses were as good as it got.
---
Incorrect again.
---
&gt; You're being intentionally obtuse; stop.
---
You're being intentionally ignorant and uninformed; stop.
---
Maybe a persistent emote? 
---
Yeah the real game 
---
lmao
---
No I’m not starting anything I’m trying to raise awareness. 
---
Cry more.
---
Think about it. You enter all your rs information while the 3rd party program is running. 
---
It was 14m for a while before it hit 19mill I assumed that was it’s normal price... 
---
Now if only the Abbysal Dagger or bludgeon would drop a bit...
---
They drop hard clues
---
If it's a standard dagannoth task the quickest way is to cannon under the lighthouse. If you're locked to kourend from Konar then yeah, bursting is effective.
---
Dungeoneering the skill was the most fun update they had done in years. Too bad the rewards absolutely fucked the game and that's all anyone thinks about anymore 
---
You should be good, a good starter set up would be as follows:
---
Melee:
---
Whip
---
Defender
---
Torso
---
Veracs plateskirt
---
Dragon boots 
---
Fury, fury if you don't have 
---
B-ring 
---
Fire cape 
---
Range:
---
Blesaes dhide top bottom and boots 
---
Blowpipe
---
Anguish, fury if you don't have
---
Best Ava's device 
---
And as always bring your Slayer helm, barrows gloves, and blessing and do full switches between phases at around base 80's your kills should be just under 3 minutes 
---
And? You got it? 
---
Runelite Dude. Free GPU plugin with tiledraw extender. Makes the game look so much more alive with a 3x higher draw distance. 
---
Playing for fun and being informed arent mutually exclusive, imagine that.
---
Wolves are basically dogs and I don’t want to kill dogs:(
---
I don't care lmao. I'm giving a suggestion to the person who said that this would be "abused by PKers". Personally I don't think anybody is going to be using something like this to PK unless they're trying to do something niche. Just rushing someone works more often.
---
I care
---
If you have the stats for them, being able to do Vorkath, Cerb and Demonics would make Duradel the better choice for gp. 
---
imagine looters in pvp worlds.........
---
Imagine paying for osb in 2019
---
Could they make a RuneLite plug-in for this??
---
How long would this take
---
Yea that's fair.
---
Anyone can work on wiki, if it wasn't a foundation and they sold it, it would be worth billions. 
---
The rods are technically not cosmetic as they save an invent space 
---
Meh... 
---
I love job

Started playing in ‘05 when I was in 4th grade. Stuff like this is what got me through.

tf is the green sack looking things in invo

feed it through the lithkren machine to toggle it's handedness 
---
I love Kob 
---
I think the brimstone ring should just be imbued via the NMZ.
---
The other rings should have a way to be combined into one as well, but into a separate ring. The Brimstone would have the passive effect and the other "one ring" would have the +8 Prayer bonus.
---
The "One Ring" should require a grandmaster quest to be able to combine or something like that.
---
I've done similar. Forgot my rock smasher for gargoyles, went back, grabbed a stamina dose, got all the way back and fought one before realizing, teleported back....got another stamina dose... Got halfway back again before realizing I'm disabled.
---
You went with swipe when you could have selected pound. The real reason. Failed meme 
---
Imagine not having 2 step authentication on your account and email lmao.
---
No idea. I've used different emails, different passwords, different locations, different ISPs, different devices. I've always lost my accounts somehow. The times I did recover I couldn't log in anyway because the toon was perma banned with no appeal for botting from whoever got access to it.
---
I care about efficiency for a couple reasons;
---
One being that I will be using a bond to become a member and want to be able to make the money back for it while also making money to actually do things in members.
---
Two being that I simply like efficiency. It is enjoyable for me knowing that I am efficiently using my time with whatever it is that I'm doing. If I ran around clueless I would feel lost and annoyed, thus watching tons of YT vids, reading up on the wiki, and asking other people what works for them.
---
2% usage, you need a new computer bud, also, blow it out every now and then. I imagine the inside of your computer probably looks like a long hair cat laying on a shag rug.
---
"Giving 10% of what you show in trade". I put up 36m, he puts up 3.6m. I accepted. Fuck.
---
just get menagrie in poh and put in there till u got 500k in future
---
If you get your nut(s) removed, can you still have kids?
---
My guess is people freaked out about Konar’s drop table saying it was OP and people were worried the items it drops would lower in price so people panic sold which caused the prices to lower and caused more people to panic sell whatever they had in their bank. I think they’ll rise and stabilize out at about what they were before release. 
---
&gt; Jagex can't shrug off responsibility if people get hacked from using a 3rd party client.
---
Typo? Because they sure can, and do. 
---
Yup, only salamanders until you can do falconry. Salamanders are just more afk, and that's what most people are about nowadays. 
---
"ima tired.  nighty nighty. ah spaghetti. ah ravioli. ah mama mia."

Thinking that more rare the better isnt everyone idea of good looking either

250k/h, happy?

not today i said, 3rd time. try again tomorro

Just use super, imo.

It picks up one at a time, will reduce the number to 9 and so forth

Back in 2006 I gave my password to a guy in exchange for 20 cooked lobsters. Unsure if it was a scam, or a genius salesman. 
---
It really depends.  Using ultracompost increases the yield, so you get more farming exp, but watermelons are worthless.  So you could either make a buck and sell that ultra compost, or use it for the extra exp.  I wouldn't use ultra compost on anything outside of herbs, or if the price goes down.  If you really want exp you should probably just do tree runs, willows are decently cheap as are most fruit trees
---
Probably merching 
---
Left doesn't even need to exist lets be honest. 
---
Motherload mine?
---
Didnt think about this yet since I was focussed on hydra changes. I will vote no now on because of it probably
---
Not when the X-Men movies came out?
---
Nah worlds 1 and 2 you're only allowed to trade, worlds 7 and 12 are only wintertodt world 18 is only trouble brewing (why do you think that world is always so dead) /s 
---
why fletch?
---
Exactly. A lot of people can afford lance, so it will still devalue it. It adds an upgrade on the way to rapier.
---
Smite him to take his +1
---
Make it toggleable, I liked it for the information but hated that it stopped my action.
---
Those 175 quest points are so rough to get though. Maybe I just hate grinding out quests endlessly!
---
I give $2 myself as well! For the value and time that it saves me, it's WELL worth that. If I were forced to go back to using the official client I probably wouldn't play the game tbh.
---
Long answer yes, short answer yes
---
Go to Zezima's chat. It's a nightmare.
---
Dan moest je het testament van gravin Groenvijver maar niet stelen pikkedoos. Wel een leuk non-fictie verhaaltje hoor ik beoordeel een dikke 9/10. grts van je zuiderburen

It's the colour of the last form of the hydra 
---
For farming?
---
Motherlode mine. But look into miscellania as well
---
No reqs? I will pray for you guys
---
The day you get banged for RuneLite is the day OSRS dies.
---
Hydra took half my bank in the divorce 
---
Oh yeah. Derpp. 
---
Fuckin ur mom lmaoooo
---
Think about it like this, WoW charges you 15 dollars to change the name of a character and that doesn’t even include the 15 dollar membership fee for the month.... if you don’t want to wait the whole month you could always buy a bond (with ingame gp or real money) and get 14 days of membership and an instant name change. 
---
But... slayer helm is untradable and would stay with you...?
---
I believe he meant all 3
---
Has nothing to do with rarity. Solid colors can attribute to an outfit better than 2 clashing colors can.
---
I mean runelite had it weeks ago if you install the plugin yourself
---
It's all 3 mate. Swipe, pound then block.
---
High pop locations DO lag more. Rendering hundreds of players can cause area specific lag. I don’t see an issue with more blast furnace worlds because it just adds the NPCs to run it. It affects nothing.
---
Seems mines in collection 1.
---
Goodluck to them.
---
Was at a high school football game once when someone punched a dude in the balls. They had to call in an ambulance and be almost lost his testicles because of it. Shits no joke.
---
Flash2: Iron man btw
---
Mined all of his own essence.
---
The amount of support these suggestions are getting worries me. People come to this game for nostalgia. They might be tiny but too many of these adjustments will be the end of that.
---
I’m going to try to get torso tonight!:D 
---
I think the joke is that all three are applicable in that order. Swipe, pound, block.
---
The selected thing is not the focus of the entire post
---
It was announced as a possible new update in 2019. Kebos Lowlands, new Elf Quest, and warding all got some spotlight, and they're all polled separately. Should come to the polls later in the year, probably with some tweaking from the first announcement.
---
1 yes, 2 no.
---
Yeah, was just correcting, no need to get salty, nerd 
---
Yeah I use this sometimes when I go to WT but my Computer still struggles even with it on. Just simple animations of like trying to run in a different direction too quickly will make it stutter.
---
 For a brand new computer, it was clearly not designed for a 20 something year old autism simulator.  
---
It's only cos of the massive amounts of bots otherwise itd be a non issue
---
I had been playing the game non stop for about 3 years up until that point and the day after I immediately quit. Such a shit update lol
---
*thinks the game need more bank space*
---
*UIM mode exists*
---
Oh
---
The joke
---
Your head
---
OSB is pretty shady so I'd avoid it.  
---
Runelite is above the table and safe to use [www.runelite.net](https://www.runelite.net) only use this link others are fake copys made by scammers.
---
Gz
---
Do you mind sharing how you do your thigh injections and what size pin you use? I do glute injections but it's starting to become a pain in the ass (no pun intended) 
---
Thank you for your comment. Please let me know why you think this potential content wouldn't be used :)
---
r/whoosh
---
I’d say they’re more of a thighs and ass kinda person 
---
Attention whore, i hope u are female in rl.
---
correct i had them mixed up with dusk mystic
---
3 by 3 square aoe attacks, can hit multiple times (up to 9), damage based on total HP with no cap
---
Like letting Jad hit for Veng.
---
You are new
---
Plz upload progress vids to YT
---
Wait that’s so smart 
---
who tha midget heh
---
One big problem I see with this is it would either have to be rng when it switches meaning switches would kinda be pointless or it would have a set rotation making it not too much different than other bosses. I could be very wrong though.
---
Becky lemme smash
---
And that right there is why jagex let's runelite exist
---
Skill necklace from GE

hey me too

Im 140 IQ, top of my class, owner of a company worth ~$3,000,000 give or take, and I support Trump. Go fuck yourself commie.
---
Okay but in my post I said herblore
---
&gt; personal attack
---
My god you need help, I don't give a fuck if your ass is fapping to underaged drawn cartoons but then don't pretend it's frawned upon and actually banned in allot of corperations and class it as a fucking personal attack
---
Y'all got 30 hp or something?
---
hmm I tried that and it did press the 5 key but its not activating the windows mousekey like pressing 5 on num pad does, I tried \~::Numpad5 still not working. Any ideas?
---
If multiple people are spam clicking the same pile, taking from the bottom is better.
---
I honestly can’t understand your comment?
---
Are you trying to say “inexistent” as in there are not many obby purrs? Because it’s actually a pretty popular build. It’s not like they are draynor village only ironmen or something 
---
If your home internet sucks and your 4G is good, just tethering your phone to your PC would be a lot easier for things like fight caves than trying to do it on mobile.
---
Lol wut
---
Did you wear mage gear? She's got v low magic defense but hits hard so you wanna wear melee armour. Mid-70s combat should be doable, depends on magic level a lot though 
---
I'm sorry, but you're a terrible source of information and are really proving nothing. Not that mine is really much better, but this statement means nothing.
---
I also agree to reverting this nerf that happened this morning. The golden tench offered a mere 1-handed version of the rpg that is commonly used with obby maul pure builds (1 attack 99 strength). The fish gave incentive for many to grind the new aerial fishing content. Aerial fishing is already known to not have the best rewards and very low exp per hour despite its brutally click-intensive training as it is. I was excited for the golden tench on release because it gave new content to these unique builds, and the builds would have to skill in order to obtain it. 
---
Please revert the nerf, as this was a pointless debunk in a mediocre weapon used for unique accounts. I am sure the rpg was not intended to have matched speed to the magic shortbow either, and yet after 3 whole years it has not even been nerfed. I feel that since many have already grinded the golden tench, we were teased with a mediocre weapon that slightly enhanced our play, and then it was taken away without due warning. Please look back at this from a community perspective, Jagex.
---
apart from the free aspect, what does runelite have that osb doesn't?
---
It's a lot easier to commit to something when you enjoy the game AND have a YouTube channel that pays you to play. 
---
Yeah that's my point, you dont ever leave that much behind at vork, but you do at hydra considering you take at the most like 30 damage if you get unlucky on the first attack and that's it.
---
Quest locked, fairly common, becomes untradeable.
---
Rapier is pretty rare from Raids 2, one of the hardest things in the game. It can also be sold back if you need the money to buy somethign else. The Avernic Defender is much more common than it and gives a similar bonus (+5 atk, +2 str over d defender) and still costs 100m. 
---
Prims are fairly common from a not hard boss but aren't quest locked and can be sold back if you need the money.
---
If you use runelite. Right click the inventory pouch icon. Then select shift click options. Then left click an item you want to make the shift click option to be use for and select use. Then right click inventory icon again and save shift click settings.  If you don't use runelite then sorry there is no way to do that. Also be sure to switch it back later on.
---
Haha balls !
---
Mod Reach was bug abusing and rwting the spoils of it, it was different
---
He is also very handsome. 
---
If you get to around 50 agility, you can do [agility pyramid](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Agility_Pyramid) for 10k gpper lap. Also the waterfall quest, tree gnome village, and the grand tree quests will boost your early combat levels greatly 
---
Anyone else remember when you could toggle rest (right click on run) and it would do this animation?
---
Shouldn't be polled.
---
Nah. It was more a suggestion to stop talking because your ideas are dumb. 
---
&gt; ~70 ranges with rune crossbow and it only took ~45 minutes 
---
I call bullshit. Fight caves is totally doable with 70 range and a rune crossbow, but it will take well over an hour in my experience.
---
TBH I would pay for these, but I'm glad that I don't have to.
---
Ohh my b havnt had the opportunity to play it no console:(
---
Yeah I call bullshit, i had about -% increase in herb farming with attas planted.
---
In all honestly i'm not joking I had still the average of 8  herbs a patch.
---
yes i can
---
Surprised someone remember this old thing! Glad you enjoyed it :)
---
Time to log off Reddit for awhile.
---
I did that part while I was super tired, so it took me forever and I was actually getting dumber as I tried more because of sleep lol. When I got it I remember being so tired I just passed out in my chair shortly after.
---
Better farming yields because of the update + panic selling because of konar etc..
---
truth
---
Pssshhh no need for gf. Rs mobile one hand, flesh light in other hand. Jajaja
---
they are varicoceles, if it doesn't hurt then it shouldn't be a major issue. if you have infertility issues you might wanna get it checked out. apparently 15-20% of males have varicoceles and it's usually always on the left nut. i got 'em too haha
---
its meant as a training method but its a very ineffecient training method given the effeciency of barb fishing and the xp+gp rates of chins. Combine that with the fact its insanely click intensive and the rewards are mediocre, and you got yourself a recipe for some hot steaming dead content.
---
Pretty sure its surely for ping and mobile benefit. Less players crammed in an area, the better the game will run for players that are on mobile
---
He's just pointing out that rsbuddy has had this feature for a long time. So if it wasn't a problem back then, then it is no problem now that runelite had it. Stop being rsbuddy shill.
---
Question
---
22 \* 2 = 44
---
This is what i was looking forward to most
---
Sounds pretty arrogant of ya but that's okay. 
---
To lighten the mood a little here I have a good story 
---
Back when I played hockey in junior, we had 4 guys that moved out my way for school and joined a squad that had been together for years. As hockey (or most locker rooms) go, the talk can get raunchy. It was only a few games into the season and were getting used to the new guys, and sex talk comes up. Ryan brought up that our new goalie has a monster nut. Casey was obviously hella embarrassed and wouldn't show the boys. The whole locker room started chanting "show the nut" and he eventually did. Thing was the size of a softball and his other nut was perfectly fine. He assured us it looks normal when he gets a bone, and it had been tested multiple times with nothing wrong. I hope his nut is still okay, I'm actually gonna check in on him because of this post.
---
Be careful boys, check your nuts. 
---
Now runelite had it too :)
---
Fuck toggleable make this permanent. Change digsite necklace too
---
🐟 UNBENCH THE TENCH 🐟
---
So with crystal saw + a gilded tea
---
I could build something 6 levels higher?
---
Are you sure, usually invisible boosts don’t work like that? Or is crystal saw the exception
---
What a whore.
---
I mean I haven't done the math but I think it is more gp/hr as the blowpipe yes or extremely close if for some reason it isn't better. The only counter argument I can think of is that during each kill ruby bolts can deal \~30-40 damage to you with decent procs so do take more damage than using a bp and effectively get less kills per hour. Bringing a bp spec for heal does mitigate most of the damage taken tho so I'm not sure how big of a difference it really is.
---
please get it checked out
---
There isn't enough stuff to fill the scroll when you level. In OSRS you unlock like one or two things (if that) per level.
---
*What* axes? *Where?*
---
Lol nvm just had to do \`::Lbutton  
---
You still have to pick them up 1 by 1.
---
Now runelite does it for me automatically too
---
Lucky
---
Imagine spending your time writing comments like that lol
---
I understand but how long did 88k take? So you spending 13-14m an hour? Why not just do lavas?
---
My ingame name is Jvh, feel free to look up if you doubt haha
---
Catspeak amulet(e) needs new use just reskin it. #ripBOB
---
That’s weird, that’s not much slower than my account with 97 range, blowpipe, anguish on task with slayer helm and most other bis range gear. What’s your secret? 
---
D
---
Nice I’m 275+ and still crossing my fingers 
---
96!!
---
Slayer tablets - like the idea, but what about monsters you can kill everywhere? 
---
Love the idea of a bone sack
---
Love the idea of the Kalith's supplies, suggest making them disintegrate after you leave the area? 
---
I don't get the weapon/armour though. If you're praying then why would you take damage? 
---
I know your pain im just above 6k kc and still no pet, but keep at it, cant be unlucky forever
---
I only brought one arrow and fell on the rope part.  
---
Yanillian hops, giant seaweed, limpwurt roots, cactus spines, and possibly poison ivy if it effects that (not sure)
---
Neci
---
K
---
Not entirely true if you open the keyboard and type “K” for example you’ll end up at the grand exchange. Also if you hold down on a teleport itll bring up a right click to confirm option 
---
don't worry it's been this way for a few years now. Just lay low and never let anyone know anything about you. Especially the username (login email) to your account.
---
The crystal saw will work off of a temporary boost.  So for example, if you drink an orange stew and get +5, the game will treat it as +8 total with the crystal saw
---
whoops i mixed up ticks with seconds. but I was wrong regardless, the seconds would be 1.8, or 3 tick
---
Sounds a little like some. RS3 shit no? 
---
thanks my dude ill look into those :)
---
Im sorry you cant afford the 3$ my dude 
---
Lmao my time may be off I haven’t been in fight caves since I got it like 2017 :P not sure how to check it.
---
But my secret is 100 sit ups, 100 push ups, and a 10 km run everyday 
---
Thank you for replying to them weath. 
---
That's not a vial of bloody water now is it?
---
Good job my man!!!
---
1 in 7.5k, not as rare as it seems
---
Konar isn't a boss slayer master, she is an area based slayer master.  She doesn't assign tasks that don't have a non-boss monster in the same area.  She also doesn't assign wildy tasks, which rules out KBD
---
Why 72 agility.  Cerberus requires 80.  KQ requires 85.  Hydra require 90?
---
sounds like a RAT to me... they can view your screen so they more than likely saw him enter his PIN/Pass/email etc.
---
Very Nice
---
What kind of tasks do you plan on using it for?
---
Firemaking, check out Wintertodt in Kourend
---
What?
---
What have they done?
---
I was just about to say, this seems more fitting to add to Hunter
---
lacks defence, but offensive should be same
---
Best answer: the diary tele, but you only get 1 per day for hard. Unlimited for elite. 
---
Technically not an answer, but second best regardless: npc contact. 
---
Third best: fairy ring cir, agility shortcut (72 I believe)
---
From here it drops waaaaay the fuck off so just get 1 of these 3. 
---
&gt;Theres no reason to check farm lvl everytime you go through a door. You cant lose levels, once you can enter a new guild area, you always will be able to.
---
Yes i did read your comment, that you are now trying to waffle out of. You are literally speaking of something that you CAN boost to get through. You didnt know that though, and are trying to pretend like you arent a moron. 
---
Could anyone explain what "redemption cheese" is? O:
---
Oh right, for some reason I thought you could only have one  totem at a time. Thanks!
---
Support
---
what a wonderful kind of day... 
---
I've sat in NMZ for at least an hour or so with auto retaliate off. No joke failed at the most vegetative content in the game.
---
Vorkath is weak to ranged.
---
I did mine around 50, the extra prayer levels give you like ~1 4 dose restore of extra room, you really just need protect range/mage.
---
It's a cool detail but I don't think it's actually helpful. You still have to 50/50 the first one and from then on it's set in stone if you just keep count. 
---
elite void with pegs for range vorkath
---
Fair point.
---
I avoid twitch at all costs lmao
---
I think he’s saying he wishes we had the option to turn this feature on or off in the settings.
---
Alternatively, what does osb have that runelite doesn't? Runelite doesn't have to be better to be worth using, it simply has to be as good as osb.
---
Funny cause all other builds hype up for dragon knives making them more op. and is obbys hype for a fish that slaps at same speed as rpg and they nerf it.
---

do it like steam and use email for verification as well. steam does mobile app and sends an email
---
No. OP posted it here for awareness due to the demographic of RS. 
---
glad the vegan was smart enough to put retarded in his username 
---
The client isn’t pulling the playerbase, people would still play without Runelite
---
It was in runelite first, just not merged with the main branch. Runelite did it first.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but this hasn't been changed since Old school release when f2p wasnt a thing. 
---
Ah but you need to use a saw for it to be effective, what I’m building doesn’t need a saw

I thought his name was "SwampLettuce" and was actually dissappointed when I found out what it actually was.
---
What an amazing achievement! Huge congratulations man!
---
.. your new series is awesome too dude. 
---
All I do is YouTube and osrs, would like to try OpenGL so why I want the 2g video card. 
---
Yesss it would feel more rewarding

Nah. Some people say that all the radio waves and radistion can cause cancer but they're just exaggerating. Technically there's radiation coming from your phone but it won't make any difference. No study or scientifically respectable source has made any case for this being true. Your phone being in your pocket isn't gonna do anything negative, you're perfectly safe.
---
Depends on what kind of 2step you have, Reddit got hacked a couple years back because their 2nd step was a text message, and apparently that can be tricked to deliver to another phone if you know the number it's going to.

they should be more rare as should the lance

lol why are helmies always such assholes

Didn’t know that. I have one. Just sold my Kodai for a 10 mil loss cause it dropped so much recently. Thank you

Because you need it there for the instances

Hahahahhahaha omg so funny :)

:( that's a much better name

did you have to telegrab it?

Jagex nerfed the tench

it was a quick fix to address the problem, its not perfect but its definitely better than waiting a month for a better fix.

No you can get more than one different type.

i down voted you

As long as its 1:1 your fine.

Not surprised a bodybuilder with ballcancer. Seems to be quite common in that culture. Roids or shit.

Wall mounted flesh light master race coming through. Now I can max two accounts, one phone on each hand.

Hey, noones getting hurt.
---
I did the same but forgot my summer pies twice in a row. At least the bridge is early on, I went through the whole pass an extra two times. My agility was only 54.... 
---
Obviously you know the answer is no, why are you posting here asking...have fun going dry for the next 50.
---
Updooted
---
&gt;on mobile
---
I get where you’re coming from, but range outputs a horrific amount of damage as is, it definitely doesn’t need any more.
---
broken how tho, if i take one dose of anti ven and bank it im free for 12 min and lost nothing but time, and 3 extra clicks, bank booth, pot,,  pot up. (smashvial), so whats the difference if i paid an extra mill to not do that everytime? 
---
Mad cuz bad.
---
Who cares about playtime, just play how you want
---
Max security isn't just a pin with auth on RS. Max security is:
---
Recovery Email different than login email, (or using user name to log in for old accounts)
---
Email not used for anything else, or if it is, unrelated passwords for those websites/services
---
Email MUST have 2FA
---
Strong RS Password, unique from ANY other websites/services.
---
2FA on RS
---
Bank Pin with 7 day delay that isn't just your birthday, birthday, or address.
---
If you're going for strong RS security, you need VERY strong e-mail security. Most database leaks are going after e-mails as it can easily be used to recovery a whole mass of accounts. Most of them aren't trying to get into a runescape account, but once that list starts making it's way around, there will eventually be someone who focuses on Runescape accounts and has free access to that e-mail and can perform recovery on the e-mail if enough data is leaked, or may just be able to plainly log right on if the password hasn't changed and there's no 2FA on it.

Went with the obby mace and the b neck, it's been working wonderfully tbh, almost to 65 attack, stopped at 59 str, if i was going for str i think i would have gone with the obby sword
---
You are insane man! Good job and keep up the work! 
---
Tbh I was about to quit because those hills weren't smooth. I'm really glad they fixed or I'd be out of here.
---
*visafe

visit some fishy leak website = get your shit leaked and hacked.
---
Thanks for the help, still gotta get that fire cape and finish ds2 lol
---
Dude, that’s the first 50 runs I’ve done. I was legitimately curious on the rates. No need for that. 
---
hey, you can find me on artstation as Leander Kiers
---
I havnt posted too much, but it would be as closest to a portfolio :)
---
Tbf I don't think many people know about it since most people switched to RL, but the majority of OSB plug-ins are available in the free version now (including this menu collapser). Only notable plug-ins behind a paywall now are OpenGL and screen markers, then I believe there are about 10 or so other not so useful plug-ins behind the paywall. 
---
Runelite obviously has a significant amount more plug-ins in general than OSB, however. 
---
Did you see the thread that killed it lol? Funny shit
---
Just head to the graveyard in like 15 Wildy. Free big bones and regular bones.
---
You can,  but imo it will be boring. Alot of 0s
---
Great graphics , pking is a high skill set , updated content and tons to do
---
But that means PVPers have to skill
---
whats taking the mick? not sure what that means,
---
Most cancers are caused by a gene mutation that happen randomly in the body an by ionizing radiation.
---
You don't have to worry about your phone since just about every device that works on electricity only emits non-ionizing radiation caused by electromagnetic fields. This non-ionizing radiation is much less powerfull than ionizing radiation, and cannot cause direct damage to the DNA.
---
This is big. Should be pinned 
---
Maybe if you weren't so shit in the sack he wouldn't pump it out and want to hop back on rs so fast. 
---
Why fletch?
---
range level?
---
Yeah, I see that. The recharge time is really slow, especially without Agility levels, so it would be nice to log in with it refreshed. If I'm logging out for the night or going out the house and don't have full run energy I set my computer to shut down after five minutes. Feels a bit silly resorting to being completely AFK for run energy. Or if I'm just taking a break (over five minutes but not all that long - a meal for instance) I leave the game open rather than closing it.
---
Aww cute no actual reply to my comment. 
---
How's it there in the 1st place doe
---
I still play the game, I use fire cape for clan wars, pvp Wildy, and some slayer. I just didn’t wanna spend 2 hours trying to get with the chance of failing just to do it again, I can make that 3m back faster than the 2 hours it’d take me to get cape. So meh. 
---
61 days 1760 total

This is why I like Reddit, comments like yours get downvoted into oblivion. It’s like a retard filter.

if you have the elite diary which a small percentage of people have done, that's not going to crash the price nearly that much

chop chop

Can you imagine having this be the way you get called out for not satisfying your lady?
---
&gt; pking is a high skill set
---
I read this. Then I think of the guys who camp chaos altar that received about 120 dbones total from my unarmed body.
---
Nawww 74 HP in robes against an unfrozen target without pray melee on. 
---
If you're risking that much you should never put yourself in that situation.
---
They work well for very high effort, you can melee hydra and miss no ticks disregarding specials if you're tick perfect. They should make melee high effort, high reward. 
---
Put auth on email and account. Not one or another
---
Ok then how about you remove that pool from your house and go to your bank every time and start potting up instead from now on. 
---
nice whats your ign
---
The lore. It strikes a nice interesting and captivating quests all and not taking itself to seriously. 
---
Its not tho you get way more negative mage bonus with less pieces when using justiciar
---
One big reason why prims are 29m is because the rest of the boots don't hold as much value. If pegs didn't require ranger boots for example the crystal would be worth a lot more but prims as a result would be worth less. By the same logic, the hydra has the lance which is carrying much of the unique value right now.
---
thats a logical explanation, i will take that as a reason, a good reason for why it doesnt work they way i think it should, but like i said before even a 3min timer would be cool if the 12min is to op.
---
If they werent all dropped at literally the same time, yes. 
---
unlock auto smash when possible
---
Just some examples, haven't checked what they charge to ship to Canada.
---
He could have done better for sure, but he still would have been dead even at 102 HP!
---
lol i bet youre one of them
---
Ya I bet you do like reddit so you can talk to people and act cool. Since we all know your prob a big loser in real life 
---
No, it's the extra rooms and the extra levels that increase the load times. The most optimized layout would be a 3x3 layout. 
---
Probably the wind blew it off a maple tree in the near distance is my best gusss
---
On average you get one item every 17 chests, so this is more than normal but nothing particularly surprising for such a small sample size.
---
I was fortunate and managed to find a small lump on my ball really early on and get it checked out. It was a tumour and luckily, because it was so early, I was able to just have the lump removed and not the whole ball. Check your nuts boys
---
What’s the point if I’m always going to have the lights off? idk, it’s just weird and distracting to me. Probably I’m too old-fashioned.
---
At least you took it like a man and didn’t delete it
---
Jesus christ! Now that i notice i cant play runescape anymore! Thanks
---
I got mine this week as well. How many times you have to try? 
---
Gratz! 
---
Up your splash game, I wish they would let cats catch spiders
---
Pass. That looks like something straight out of RS3
---
70 prayer for piety is a must and will be bigger than any single gear upgrade.
---
From there zenyte jewelry is the biggest boost to your melee and ranged set ups.
---
Why would you post a video crying telling the world...would you not want to just be near family/close friends and deal with it in private like everyone else
---
There's no real finish to the game. The only goals you set are your own and for me, that's enough to keep me motivated. Always something new to learn and/or do in the game to expand your skills.
---
The only advantage would be me fighting lv 90's. It sounds like just maxing the account is the best thing to do
---
It's pretty chill.
---
y'all making this more and more complicated is why it'll never happen 
---
I'd say it depends what is the global ratio for the runes acquisition -- RC vs drops. I mean you make more bloods/h, but you need high RC, and few people have it; you can make less bloods/h by e.g. killing bloodvelds, but it only needs medium slayer level and a lot of people are slaying those. 
---
should give you vengeance, overload, anglerfish to 121, and give +5 spicy stew boosts to all skills

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

this is the effect of runelite playing god. there are things we werent meant to see. terrible things

huh

Rename 'The G.E' to 'The Z'. No poll.
---
The variety of content that's available and sense of accomplishment. Busy couple of months? Just afk fish or woodcut in the background. Want to grind for rewards? Go boss or other high level content. Want to pvp? Go learn to PK with all the various builds. Endless content with a sense of accomplishment by attaining small goals.

Tough scene

Engine work sorry

That's why text message MFA is fucking stone age tech.

I’m sure OP means which hand your weapon is and which your offhand is

I have dual monitors and have legitimately done both at the same time.

Hey guys just want to let you all know to checm out "keepass", ive been using it quite for a while since i used to reuse passwords a few years ago

Its not complex, and it helps a lot, since you can store quite the amount of data in them. Also it has a very customizable password randomizer so that helps too
---
Its free btw!

If you really cared you would create a clan to cast humidify on jugs to crash the market.

No idea but there is some wierd magic that attracts me to runescape than other games.

Why is this a problem? I've never used him on my meme yet

Yep.

I mean it's possible if you drop your bones in pest control, right?

The cake doesn’t look appealing, it’s been carelessly thrown together in a filthy glass dish and because I make a simple observation I’m a terrible person?

OP posted it online and I’m completely entitled to have an opinion, whether it be positive or negative.  
---
 You also need to learn the difference between fiancé and fiancée, mate.
---
To add here, I was confused when I was young because I felt a small lump.  See my doc and basically tells me I have a third testicle and it's actually just a cyst chillin in there.  Apparently not a problem until it becomes a problem or something.  But also I've passed 13 kidney stones before that problem got solved so here's to hoping I don't die, yet.
---
This is a really cool PSA, thanks
---
Can a skiller unlock all of the teleports for it?
---
what’s your money maker?
---
All jokes aside I found a hard bump described in the post about a month ago while in the shower. How serious should I take this. Also can’t it also just be a small cyst?

---
For each slayer monster killed with this sword it will restore 5 prayer points.
---
So for every positive prayer bonus the drain rate of your prayer is reduced by 3.33%.   
---
A prayer bonus of 30 is required to halve the drain rate of any given prayer. 
---
A common relatively cheap slayer set up consists of:
---
Slayer helm ---
---
Amulet of Fury (+5 Prayer bonus) 
---
Proselyte Hauberk (+8 Prayer bonus) 
---
Proselyte Tasset ( +6 Prayer bonus) 
---
Dragon boots/Boots of stone ----
---
Skill cape or Ardy cape 2 (+4 Prayer bonus) 
---
God blessing (+1 prayer bonus)
---
Weapon - Lets say Mazchnas Sword (+3 prayer bonus)
---
Offhand - Dragon defender or God book (+5 prayer bonus)
---
Barrows Gloves/Mith gloves/Combat bracelet/Slayer Bracelets ---
---
Explorers Ring 1 (+1 prayer bonus.)
---
For a Total prayer bonus of +28 - +33 (Depending on whether you use God book or not, other items with greater bonus can be substituted in this is just a cheap easy to obtain example)
---
We'll assume +28 for arguments sake. 
---
With a +28 prayer bonus Protect from melee range or magic drains prayer points at a rate of 1 point every 5.8 seconds. 
---
So if every time I killed a creature on task with Mazchna's sword I gain 5 prayer points then its equivalent to 29 more seconds of protect from prayers. 
---
Even players with low stats slay monsters quicker than 1 every 29 seconds. 
---
This would render players invincible essentially and make no need for prayer potions or supplies. Very Overpowered. 
---
Probably scrap the passive effects, cool ideas for uniques! Just very overpowered.
---
^(Also yes, Konar has better tits.) 
---
Rip super combats 
---
Torstol is very useful, but not as an unfinished pot to make zammy brews. It's added to super sets to make super combat. Making unfinished torstol pots wastes them all
---
Disable it in non PvP locations, problem solved

Anybody wanna do Heroes quest with me? Username: Matteryd (i'm pheonix)

I meant what hand your weapon is in and which your offhand is.

I mean she was dancing to it so it was aight.

This.
---
He was number 1!

Yea exactly.
---
Oh okay I see. Thanks for explaining

Ah. Must be a normie IRL.

Yea meant what hand the character carries the weapon in.

If there was a week long delay to remove the authenticator and no other way to remove it besides using the phone it's attached to, then that would. 
---
I jist saw this today when reading about the boots of brimstone
---
true that
---
All im sayin is, if RS3 has this, why dont we...
---
Imagine caring about upvotes in 2019
---
Unfinished torstol potions can only be used to make zammy brews which are completely useless. 
---
You can not undo the process so all of those torstols are wasted. 
---
And torstols are relatively rare and valuable for an ironman. 
---
“Mark of grace my fucking words”
---
Lmao
---
rate is 1/17.42
---
So the odds of getting 5 items in exactly 50 chest is 9.23%
---
Typically 50/17.42 would net you about 2.87 items.  so you are close to twice the drop rate. 
---
Now, is it typical? not really. Is it that much of a turn of luck? eh... not really either getting 5 items + out of 50 chest is 15.8%. Therefore, if you were to repeat 50 chest an infinite amount of time, you could expect 5 or MORE items once every 6.329 times. 
---
tl;dr:  good RNG, but nothing special.

need something with aggro

Oh no it’s the rest animation from “rs3”!!!!!

You are wrong, because temp stat boosts are a thing, the guild doors look for them, and you can lose levels because of them. 
---
Honestly worth every minute getting mort hard done if you are going to do barrows, most of your profit (nearly doubles) will be coming from runes and then some rng based gains as well from barrows items.

Yep, skillers can complete architectural alliance to get the Xeric's Heart teleport. The Xeric's Honour teleport will require leeching some raids though skillers probably wouldn't need that teleport anyway.
---
Don’t know about the guy you’re replying to but it takes about 1500 hours to max if you play as efficiently as possible. Almost nobody plays 100% efficiently though and that also assumes money costs no time, I’d say at least 2000 hours for most people.

It's a two player quest--- you need help from someone

I was rocking the myth cape when I beat ds2, but when I finally got a jad kc on 1/1/2019 I got the pet at the same time.
---
and yes that was my combat level with 97 ranged xd

Yep. You start with all of them besides Honour, the Raids 1 teleport that comes from the tablet. You can get the tablet if you have a team that will let you leech/skill for them.

I've been playing since 2004 and didn't know this.

While it may not be anything, people have gotten a Dragon Warhammer on their first kill. I just told my parents about an inconsistency on my left but and you should tell someone too.
---
56, urs?

I bought one over a year ago for like 6.5m :/. Meh

Dragon bones dropped like 400 each also. Went ahead and pumped some money to get from 82 to 85 for the diary in the future.

No need to panic if your email provider hasnt been hacked and you dont reuse the password for your email anywhere else.
---
Just because you had to signed up for some random tech forum to ask a question once and used a password like "qwerty" doesnt mean that your email is compromised when that info gets leaked.
---
so which is it, are people allowed to joke about whatever they want on the internet because free speech or whatever, or does that not include women making jokes about sex that you don't like?

I was SO happy when he got snails, allowing him to keep the purity of the account

When I first started playing in 2004 (I was 9 at the time) I had just gotten my first set of mithril and I was in varrock one day and a guy came up to me asking if I wanted my armor trimmed. Not even realizing that I had never even seen trimmed mithril or heard of people being able to trim armor, I traded him all my armor and watched as he ran down the street with what was basically all my gold at the time. 
---
Uh what about this weird tube thing I feel on one of my balls 
---
HoW dId YoU bReAk tHe GaMe???!
---
I wouldn't quit, but I probably would login less - this is assuming all third party clients were shut down, for the record. I'd go back to Konduit if Runelite was canned.
---
Hey thanks for this served as good motivation for "hey let's take 15 minutes to change a bunch of my passwords"
---
I cri
---
Yeah he could have been ratted
---
Most contracts are under 2 hrs but if he had to plant many fruit trees it could've taken a while
---
This is one of my favourite hobbies
---
I think the whole point was to not make it overpowered for everything... melee is supposed to be weak against magic (see the combat triangle), so it makes no sense for justiciar to be resistant to magic
---
Around 10 times over the span of 1 year.

"I will be kicking Jad to death"

Absolute legend gz
---
gp is nothing to me, i buy like 100m every other week. 
---
Yup, I actualy would not play without it. Everytime i do someting on mobile im so conufsed, like where is the slayer count. Where are my drops...
---
Same here probably, and thanks for the clarification, I went ahead and edited my post.
---
probably because its not an actual antivenom itself it just cures it but one other thing you could also argue is why doesn't it give you the stamina boost because you use one making it it only regens run energy
---
Yeah its pretty worrying you dont know that the songs called 3 little birds
---
Dog
---
and most total level worlds are clear too
---
Rs3 scape
---
I mean, the Craw's Bow and Chainmace are holding value pretty well and they are cost per hit weapons. So I'm not sure what uniques your referring to, but the concept of on-task items isn't that bad of an idea and the right items could be very useful.
---
Yeah must suck still getting allowance from mommy am I right 
---
Probably vanilla, the filthy casual

Upvoted for... visibility? Somehow seems odd to be upvoting this!

Solution: don't Runecraft

:D

:/

Or they are just lazy fucks

Why don't we just hold their hands the entire way then if we're going to get rid of any risk of them dying?
---
For example looks at heavy casket (reward for completing 200 clue scrolls).  A cosmetic items but has same stats as iron war hammer.  Holy this is way to op!!!! It’s a cosmetic fun item!!!!!!

stop uploading this

The varicocele can cause infertility aswell!

Anyone else notice the time would be 4:20pm by the hour hand's position?
---
You don't have to click on this new 'portal' though. You can just walk through it if you have the farming req. 
---
eeeeesh. 
---
Also possibly important for rune prices, people were going mad trying to get 95 slayer in preperation fir hydra. There's probably a lot less people doing slayer in general now, and especially burst tasks
---
Just quoting the god himself
---
At least it wasn't a tbow
---
Yeaaaah I don't know if anyone thought that out lol.
---
buy an infernal then ya dumdum

Varicoceles can cause infertility

&gt;do if you hit with your whole two hands the keyboard you can get to 10k keystrokes per minute super easy?

But why? I have a stack of like 100k potato seeds. Just make a seed vault, full stop.

I think there is a clan to help people with the other side of this quest. Soa osrs or osrs soa I believe.

Miss me with that gay shit

They used a flawed polling method to poll whether or not they should use a flawed polling method... that’s really some jagex level autism lmao
---
We should have a poll to see if it should be polled.
---
They're specifically going against the established rules set by the governing power, which is Jagex in this case. 
---
It doesn't matter whether or not it's just a game. Disobeying the rules set by a higher power than you is always a dishonorable action. They should either figure out a way to make their money legally and respectfully, or they should stop being craven and fix their worthless cowpat of a country.

I guess you aren't 'fearless' after all

I agree that cheating is never appropriate, but if a girl is single-- why does it matter how many people she's sleeping with? or if she's flirting, or posting scandalous photos. even in a relationship, I think that posting things like that (and the post itself,) is okay.

i know I'm preaching at this point, but ditching the "hoe" mentality will help a lot in life. women make up around half the population of people, and when they hear dudes dropping "hoe," "slut," "whore," they will avoid that person because it reveals their perception of a woman's role in society. to be hot, but not too hot to attract *too much* attention, to only have the *right amount* of sex appeal. if you say that shit you're basically letting girls know you believe in a nearly impossible standard that you expect women to adhere to. it's not a good way to interact with the world.

Have you ever thought to transitioning to different injection sites such as VG/Medial Delt/Chest to reduce scar tissue. Also Test Cyps biological half life is ~4 days and your injection time is every 2 weeks. I do my TRT shots E3.5D with 62.5mg of Test to keep my hormones stable
---
That never happened.

Got em!

thanks chief

This is the most important thing ever posted on Reddit.

Ok we get it, you find joy in rushing and minmaxing.

I mean I was assuming she meant it as a joke, if she’s serious then yeah it’s kinda bad

What he said. Nats are pretty shit too because they’ve crashed— better than they were seven months ago (they were steady ~200 gp for months), they’re marginally better. Double deaths and nats are a 1-1.2m/hr method right now, down like 300-500k. Less incentive to dedicate the time. I think Law rune crafting is your best bet, but the whole Entrana gimmick is enough to make that shit like passing a kidney stone. Smartest thing right now is to give into the peer pressure and hop on the slayer train, it seems.

It is random, it's not accurately random. The value you try to get hardly represents the value the computer rolls for.

Not bad, keep working at it.

But what about my positive attitude ironman??

Thank you stranger, for the gold!
---
Pretty sure at least a couple have done it already lol
---
I have 910 kc no unique at all :(
---
I found it a bit surprising too. I got a pair for 11M the other day because I really didn't expect them to drop more and think it is well worth the price.
---
My guess is it the requirements. Dragon Slayer 2 is not an easy quest so while they may be better than Prims, it is easier to get the reqs for Prims. Also, rarity is the other reason. A lot of players have been camping Hydra and a lot of gloves have come into the game. Perhaps in the future when that initial rush of Hydra Leathers is used up the price may rise back some, but it may just be easier to get than stuff like Prims or the Rapier.

Most Accurate thing ive ever seen JamFlex Please Add Draven into OSRS

Newsflash. Magic is a combat skill. Most people still do combat when they're maxed, whether it's bossing or slayer. Besides, this is quite obviously a merch attempt.
---
There are certain pvp accounts that use RPG as a main weapon, so basically the tench would be a new bis for that specific build.

He clicks 1 square away in this video...

Pitter patter boys.

I love thinking about this. Yup, you’re right. Way more blood runes come in from slayer than RCing right now across the board, surely. You’d be lucky to see 10 people crafting blood runes on any world at any given time; RC is the skill with the least 99s for a reason.
---
Good point and post overall.  
---
Knock on wood I haven't been hacked on any of my accounts but I've noticed that accounts not associated with emails at all seem less likely to get hacked.  I've never had any security on any of my original pre eoc accounts.  Granted if it ever did happen it would be unlikely that I would be able to get these accounts back.  
---
Not from the side that matters
---
Doubling money.
---
It is probably better to compared to Torture since that also losses defence. Though it seems that both arn't far off in value.
---
Congratz!!!
---
Hey that's like 300k, nice
---
In all seriousness though go watch any NH bridder on YouTube like Manked or Ditter and you'll realize thay deep wild PKing actually has a high skill cap
---
Maybe not very worried, but concerned. Maybe even more concerned if you want kids because it can lead to infertility, but dont forget you do have two testicles just because one stops working doesnt mean the other will aswell, but if its painful which they can cause pain, and also if its a bad varicocele youll need surgery to correct it, but just remember this, when it doubt get checked out!
---
No dragon boots?
---
This is really really neat idea and it does not effect any core gameplay so i dont see people having an issue with it. Really no cons to this one
---
But the Farming Guild is indoors! /s
---
What happened to dragon boots?

I wish this was a thing on mobile.

My accounts so old you cant use an email to access it username only that I made in 2005 when I was in elementary school

It's the animation for the lunar spell so it'd be misleading to have it used for both things.
---
Yeah thia guys bitter, i made about 5m on my first 15. Hit an ahrims top on 7kc
---
I find it strange that many don't. I check regularly. Felt a weird hump on one my balls a half year ago and got kinda nervous. They put gel on my balls and echo'd it just like they would on a pregnant belly. Luckily it was only a cysts.
---
Just finished getting auto weed, never going back 😩
---
Hey man, thanks for your message. Just more about varicoceles, good to know what's up. I'm from Lithuania and studying in UK right now. Hope that is enough information and appreciate your help!
---
Can you? Yes, but you’ll hate the game forever. You might as well get 56 for the next quest.
---
Lmfao I read it as that too and was 300 confused

You've unlocked:

Nothing of value

Why is this meme resurfacing again in a lot of places? I ain't complaining tho. You got me.

Lmao 240 and u bitching gtfo my first shard was 430 second like 900 n third was 1400 i jkilled 1700-1800

Method for agility or runecrafting? For Lava runes it was fire tiara with graceful and ring of dueling. Inventory of just an earth talisman, fire runes, and all essence. Tele to duel arena, slightly north enter the fire altar, use the earth talisman on the altar inside, teleport to castlewars, bank, repeat. All that for maybe 40k an hour not including the times I misclicked and just made fire runes like a dumbass. 
---
Fishy as fuck lmao, not gonna go that site
---
Well that depends
---
What happens if an Ironman and a regular player drop something on the same spot. How does the game differentiate between what the Ironman can and can't take?
---
They're both a slog, but I try and keep the silver lining in mind for both. For RC I know I'm making a shit ton of money, and for agility I know it's such a helpful high level skill for basically every area of the game. 
---
Between the two, I think agility is easier to mindlessly grind for hours, and the monkey part of my brain learns to get hyped when I find a mark of grace, so that's neat.
---
So only player 1 would be able to pick up any sharks?
---
Hmm I’d like to know the story behind girlfriend/step sister. 
---
/r/noisygifs
---
Literally my thought as well. 
---
You don't have to go in defenseless. If you want to rag vetion in monk robes and not put up a fight back thats fine.  
---
Generally people who think people who think the wild should be risk free played after they removed it. 
---
Jagex "encouraging" people to go into the wild is a scapegoat argument. Content should never be balanced for ironmemes. Nobody needs to kill these bosses. They can just buy a d pick if they want one so bad. 
---
The aspect of getting pked is what makes these bosses exciting, it's what makes the wilderness exciting. Could you imagine if callisto wasnt in deep wild?  Shit would be fucking stupid. 
---
Do you think green dragons should be safe? 
---
Because it makes those skills a combat skill

OSRS memes give me life

Quick, drown him in memes

No, agility.

Tile skipping the fire wall shouldn't be needed in most cases, just when rng is against you.

Pettition to bring back the removal of the wilderness

I smell some juicy sadcringe up in here
---
Reeee that's like. All I can feel though other than balls. I dont know what I'm looking for.
---
Can you come do it for me? No homo ;)
---
I don’t play RuneScape a lot just if I have a few hours my character is always the same as I left it and I don’t have to worry about being out of touch with the meta and I can do whatever I want to do.. 
---
I found the image in r/teenagers and cropped out the text above
---
You have to kinda fumble it around. On top of your nuts are 
---
epididymis so you shouldn't worry about those unless they hurt, and around your balls there can be a lot of vens deferens. Sometimes i think shit that's a hump on my nut, only to feel it's just the vas deferens kinda being in the way. What you should worry about is if you feel things on the side of your nuts.
---
Sadly rng can go both ways. 
---
61 magic, the guide I had just said wear Ahrims which with 51 defence cant happen lol. I'll try it with Splitbark I guess? I can do Mystic if that's better but I cant afford Infinity. 
---
pretty awful to be honest

You say that, he's only number 16

Who uses a mith grapple? LOL

Wow so new and original

Inexcusable

New skills should be introduced that make left or right handed characters more powerful for certain tasks, maybe dual wielding could be introduced but limited by your strength skill, 15-24 daggers, 25-34 swords, 35-44 long swords and maces, 45-54 warhammers and battleaxes, 55-64 scimitars. 65+ 2h weapons able to be wielded in only your main hand and the ability to equip a sq shield in the offhand. Etc
---
I'm thinking weapons would suffer a power and speed deficit of 12.5% each making dual wielding 75% faster attack speed overall with a 25% power reduction making dual wielding 50% more powerful than single wielding while also suffering the loss of a shield. Maybe lock the skill behind a quest requiring a bunch of stuff that's kinda hard or a skill that needs to be leveled above the Varrock castle with the guards or something.
---
Idk, someone smarter than me could flesh it out better.
---
Valv... Jagex, please fix.
---
Should have more upvotes 
---
This man speaks the truth and I gotta say I’m grateful to people like Settled that condense 40+hours of grind in a single high quality video.
---
Really? Thought it did. My bad. Not sure where I got bad info from then.
---
I mean if it just outright beats the rapier and competes with scythe for time at cox it’s not just a dboot-&gt;prim boot increase in dps 
---

Back in the early days of RSMV's, had a couple plebs ask me to help them with a video. They were attacking each other in the wilderness. Nbd. One starts dying, asks me to help out, BOOM skulled, RIP the 5k I had at the time. 
---
Good guide but a small little correction:
---
&gt;If their account has 2fa on it, then simply insta-disable it, since the e-mail is now registered to yours.
---
If you recover an account, the 2fa is disabled.  The 2fa should be disabled by step 9 of your guide.   A successful recovery request disables 2fa instantly, no email required.  
---
Jagex have had way worse bugs than a simple enemy not showing up and they're still doing fine
---

Glad to hear it man thank you &lt;3

I mean, if your employer requires you to use it I get you. If not then whatever program you're using likely has an adequate program to do the same thing on Windows is all I'm saying.
---
yellow on yellow :/
---
That wildy one could even go up to like 96 range/str/agi
---
Maybe needs some level tweaks but good post overall! Hope you get more votes so this gets seen by more people! 
---
And they should also be a little bit squeezable. Very hard balls aren't a good sign.
