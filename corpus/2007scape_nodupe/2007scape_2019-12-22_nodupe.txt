Unfortunately not.

Yeah osrs is is basically solo-scape. Only ToB is done predominately in teams
---
I mean here we are three mental jungle gyms away from the original topic, but sure go ahead and use this as validation.
---
Probably botted. GG
---
There’s some link where you can actually just delete your account but what’s wrong with starting a new email?
---
Must be going for the 24 hour smithing EHP record
---
It’s coming, don’t worry.
---
I want 10m
---
Yah uh Ill have white rice, no beans, yah gimme dat chicken
---
I had a blast actually, i really like the inferno
---
So buying bonds to get GP is frowned upon? Not defending this guy or anything but some people earn things in different ways.
---
What if he has a main
---
I wanted actually footage, not actual footagw
---
I agree osrs is a botters heaven but most low level suicide bots don’t make 1m+ an hour in raw gp and supplies. A Yew bot is making like 80k gp an hour but anyone that can bot 300 total level and afk for 48 hours can start making bank in bh.

I got 99 Ranged through Slayer with this in mind, I didn't wanna just get it from using chins after MM1/2, took ages but when I got it I felt like I really achieved something.
---
I try to do this for all the skills I enjoy and the ones I don't I'll play minigames or more 'fun' methods.
---
Ah I didn’t know that, thanks for the heads up.
---
Switch your email, change all passwords associated with your account, run some anti virus software on your computer, clear all cookies and cache from web browsers, and pray.  
---
This happened to me years and years ago, unfortunately my account was stolen, botted on and by the time I recovered it , it was perm banned for macroing.  
---
Best of luck man, be careful next time.
---
Pfff not me.

Every Swampletics episode is like hitting the k-hole.

Maybe a mini quest could let us clean him up? Would be pretty fun. Maybe I’ve been starving for story stuff since finishing the quests though. 😂
---
Probably has a main and a new account. 52 prayer with high mage low def makes sense. Stop hating
---
510 × 0.18 = 91.8 the math checks out
---
edgy af you sure seem like 1 of the guys on that world and you seem so mad?
---
That dad looks like Jerry from totally spies lmfao
---
Here, take my upvote.
---
and this post shows how toxic they are, they all flocked too it as soon as they heard i posted it
---
Personally, I feel like swampman makes better videos out of the content than others that I've seen. I didn't play RS when I first saw them, but I still understood what he was doing in the quests. Verf and the other locked accounts don't do that for me.
---
B ring and ranger boots from the same clue, dang thats sick! Gz!
---
Don't hurt your knees sitting cross-legged in front of that shit. My knees are shit from it, take my word, get a desk soon fam! Lol

Oh hekk yes thats perfect! Thank you :D That'll be very helpful til I can get a dragon fireshield and the bearhead is unexpected! Thank you thank you

I’ve been told that too, but almost always get smacked around like a rag doll. Must be cus praying mage is better lol

oh sweet thank you! perfect! hehehe :D

anythign to make teleblock and spells land les sis worth while &lt;3

When they do that they can straight up scam you. EBay has no policy on added free stuff
---
No
---
bit out of my price range but thank you I dind't know that :D
---
Work towards vengeance or build a pure? Both options can be fairly cheap. Don't collect all your experience  watching other people play. Go out and try pking with out veng.
---
Mate i dont even play twisted league get over yourself
---
PVM has the highest amount of points attached to it, they're just late game and only reasonable to aim for if you didn't take the skilling relics.
---
DAMN level 87 assembler
---
but yet your here complaining and being toxic af for what?
---
did you just drop your visafe
---
Lol what are you talking about 12-14 hours a day non stop would be bad for your health? I run on 4 hours of sleep and am working at least 12 hours a day and I’m fine
---
Not 2200 total but I've heard the wildy in those worlds are run by clans.
---
I think that would mainly refer to other gamers. 
---
I tell ppl I game osrs a lot - they don't rly question it 
---
But when I tell ppl who play a lot of games they kind of raise their eye brows - "but there's so many  better games"
---
13%
---
Yeah but completing the collection log can be important to people, plus he still needs to get to 99 fm
---
Don't ruin the game for him just so you can flex a bit of wealth. At most he could use a bond.
---
this is a runescape subreddit
---
not league
---
Correct terminology. FUPA Also known as Fat Upper Pussy Area is something the grinch cannot have.
---
Nice switch Abdar
---
all i was saying is that you dont have to have an account on said email to recieve these phishing mails, ive never said that it wasnt a phish?
---
Pkers check the total worlds first, you're better off using random non-total worlds.
---
Nah
---
And yet there you are on his stream
---
You're off by like 40 years my dude lol
---
You're thinking of 2k and 2.2k rev caves
---
Jagex support is a well known JOKE.
---
First you have to get the communities attention before Jagex support helps you with your problem.
---
Buy real pizza you bum
---
Try going to the website and putting it on the original account. Hopefully it will let you add it back. Just in case it wasn't actually taken.
---
And this comment
---
You probably did a lot more interesting IRL stuff than he did this year tho 
---
But if you didn’t there’s no hope left for you
---
Fair enough yeah I haven’t even tried hunting black chins on 2k total yet, good to know it’s not too bad though. Thanks for the response.
---
&gt; You're advocating for the trophy being obtainable should leagues be discontinued. Therefore you're arguing that the trophy should be obtainable without competing in the leagues should leagues be discontinued.
---
I'm not even discussing the premise of leagues ceasing to exist as that isnt the issue at hand. A trophy doesn't have to be discontinued, thats what im arguing.
---
Yeah okay the people comparing Runescape achievements to the guy who probably plays 15-18 hours a day are social creatures
---
Social creatures
---
Okay
---
NOT A WASTE OF TIME
---
first things first, If your acc is 10+ years old then IF you recover it your old acc stats n shit is on RS3, osrs you got to Start fresh
---
But i for one had luck, stating an approximate date of first membership+ which clan i was, who was in my friendslist and which quests are 100% done or active atm.
---
i also wrote my approximate stats and prefered activites. few hours later i had my acc back :D
---
so write every little detail that helps but state where you are not sure.
---
hope you get your acc back
---
There are guides for pretty much all types of account builds, really depends on what kind of account you want to pursue
---
It does stack, and the tome still uses charges.
---
I'll buy a bond and try now.
---
For sure, just since I’d seen a fairly noticeable drop in pkers at 2k total at chaos hut/wildly bosses, etc, I wondered if the difference would be more dramatic at 2.2k totals.
---
Not if you use brews champ
---
Don't need a bond to do it on the website if you're going back to an old name.
---
LOL hope this cretin gets his head bashed in
---
this is what runescape has come to
---
How can you smell his sentence when there’s a smog of stank surrounding you and your chair?
---
Who the fuck said im upset
---
A bot is still run by a person so his point still stands.
---
i feel that app would dilute ingame clue caskets
---
Make an ironman
---
Burnt*
---
Are we going to pretend it was ever funny
---
You seem to be confused. The tweet is referencing two questions: A should the trophy be unique? and B Should the trophy be obtainable via an alternative route if leagues as a whole are discontinued?
---
Absolutely possible and doable 
---
But you my as well unlock it honestly then
---
Pick your style 
---
You don't need veng as much if at all if you wanna rush because youre going for a 1 hit combo they won't have time to veng you
---
But if you're looking to 1v1 risk fight someone 
---
Then you my as well just get veng first cause mad people will have that advantage over you and will anti stack your specs.
---
Naw bra he was watching porn
---
Gz bro, got mine at 9 Kc, awsome pet to have
---
It didn't work =\\ It still says the name is taken.
---
LOL ur account amounts to trying to offend people on the internet, let’s trade lives, yours seems class?
---
Lmfao- omg you’re right!!11!1!
---
Just like how you can look up online that fountain drinks taste entirely different than the bottles... that aren’t available everywhere. 10/10 for your one google/ YouTube research. I love Baja blast, bust despise the bottled version. I don’t drink pop/soda- but I will make an exception for Baja blast. 
---
How about looking it up online for yourself?????
---
Not really, the claw is actually on the drop table
---
Dumb af right here
---
Oh no your bought account got locked so sad
---
Bloodveld tasks in TL are 130-180 kills unextended, you were mistaken on your initial task amount and runelite was tracking the wrong value
---
Disappointed you aren't in your POH
---
Alright i can take anything over a joke but don’t be a dick.
---
I just don’t like them and I’m asking y’all for reasons to use them. Simple as that
---
Thanks I want to give this a go, looks much more laid back than switching between range and mage
---
well thats the thing if you do a lot of cox or tob its always worth using sang/scythe because  you make ridiculous amounts of money anyways.
---
you're*
---
better than giving money to charlie
---
HAHA i knew the participation awards for the victim olympics would arrive for OSRS, just like they did irl. Way to undermine the accomplishments of the few by bringing everyone down with the losers.
---
All 45 Democrats in the Senate voted "not guilty" on both charges, as did five Republicans; they were joined by five additional Republicans in voting "not guilty" on the perjury charge.
---
Whereas with Trump, votes against Impeachment were cast by Republicans, and a handful of D's and I's. 
---
Votes to Impeach were 100% Democrat. Literally not a drop of bipartisan agreement.
---
How tf do you pk on mobile?!?!!?

and also his career

Did you actually check it on your gem? or did you just look at the indiciators on Runelite? They get bugged out all the time.

Someone threw the ball to you

Yes

Max cash =/= max cash *number*

everyone told me to post on her and twitter for customer support. I have appealed my ban on the website saying its a mistake.
---
I'm the guy in full steel in the picture, he actually did not attempt to hop and continued arguing and shit-talking everyone for a number of minutes, pretty much my entire Hill Giants task.
---
Gone girl is one of the best movies, hadn't seen it since it came out and some people in my clan said they hadn't seen it yet so had to watch it with them, don't know why im getting down voted tho.
---
It said it was removed so i posted it again a few days later when i checked to see how the post was doing.
---
Exactly but thats fair enough because youre not there looking to fight people, high risk high reward and all that
---
I made 500k begging at the ge in 10 minutes once. I see why people do it lol. Another time I made 20m just backing some random dude up on an argument he was in at the ge lol
---
I mean that's why it's called rs3, to separate it from rs2. 
---
Really the change from rs2 to rs3 is nothing compared to the change from rs1 (classic) to rs2. So its a community thing more than anything.
---
he's so pissed about being tagged off
---
He’s in position to get a new Smithing EHP record
---
And sometimes that doesn't work.
---
Someones miserable around the holidays and is trying to take it out on someone else.
---
Hop off him. 
---
You're wrong and your example is bad and you should feel bad. Deal with it.
---
Enjoy your holidays!

Weebs.

Man you can see the desk right there, the cords are even coming from it.

---
With qp cape I can get 200 on a good day. The runelite plugin helps get a few extra tears each time
---
Well count me in mate.
---
I fully respect your opinion and your stance, and its why my main alternative suggestion has been for the trophy to be league-to-league style.
---
So when you place dragon tier you get a dragon emblem / title (we aren't sure what yet exactly) and can access dragon tier worlds in the next league. If you don't place dragon in that league, you lose those. I thought trophies could be a main game solution for that, with a generic one simply being the "collector" side of it. You achieved this once, here you go. Just like all other things in RS, even ones tied to competitive leaderboards. Get enough BH kills, you get this reward unlocked. Get enough minigame points, same deal. You won't be the top player but you've reached enough to have the account get the unlock.
---
So a inbetween league flex with an icon to show everyone "hey look i was top 1% of the last league". But that doesn't last forever. Possibly unlocks a permanent unlock, which everyone can earn by playing any league. The only reason people want unique trophies forever is to forever flex unobtainable items.
---
FOR LORD DAGON
---
As a owner of a maxed 75 attack pure, this is accurate.
---
Then a 60 attack med pops up and destroys my ass like Piper Perri in that meme with the big black fellers.
---
Its more about how shitty osrs is than the laptop
---
The Complete lack of gpu support from osrs doesn't help, so if your beefy graphics card literally does jack shit.
---
Cardinal 7s and the oreo 6s
---
Its kind of ironic 
---
Fossil island has the worst(mushroom valley) and best place for fps(island bank chest)
---
Or buy it from someone willing to sell it but isn't putting it up on the GE and offer a little bit higher than market value.
---
If you’re having trouble with your switches the answer isn’t to cheat and get banned the answer is to practice with less switches and gradually increase as you get more comfortable. It’s not worth losing your account
---
Well its your fault if your account isn't worth all of that, stop bankstanding so much!
---
Them zerkers and ranged tanks can really put a hurting on pures
---
I'm sorry you don't like my views, I didn't think they were that controversial. I actually started with runescape 3 last year and had a good bit of fun, a few of their systems are really great, like the death mechanics and item sink through invention. I left because OSRS didn't have the micro transactions and no Dungeoneering, Summoning, or Divination all of which I disliked.
---
They are different comparisons because the dragon cup is not awarded to the first 1% of people to reach something (a number that would ever expand, adding new members the more that eventually got the 99) it is awarded to the top 1% of players at the end of the league, which people will compete to stay in until the last moments and will then be a locked group of people that wont change for that league.
---
I don't know why you are so adamant that not deserving a trophy you did not earn is a bad thing. Do you care to further explain your aversion to trophies? Is there another metric you would like the trophies based on? I'm a little confused by that point in particular, clearly.
---
At the end there are you declaring the entire idea of trophies as undefendable or only in this game as a unique item for each league? Would you be alright if every trophy was the same league to league? 
---
I'm not really sure what you want other than the item removed and not given out, which I would find to be a shame, I want those that worked hard to be able to collect them if they want to.
---
in the future anything can happen to anything.
---
The cape is only +1 max hit over the pizza cape, it's more of a cosmetic show-off than a actual necessity. 
---
I have one and i just leave it in my PoH cape rack cause i don't want to lose it and have to re-obtain it again.
---
Its not really ever funny
---
Its more "hey I too get that!" Or at the most t makes you breath air out of your nose really fast, but not lsugh.
---
Your account has been recovered by someone (not you). You need to use the option "Recover without access to email" and pick a new email to recover to.
---
Elon Musk does it unironically
---
Wrong sub m8

While we're on the topic, does anyone know how he gets the TTS? I've tried a few websites but none of them produce the proper HYAHYAHYAHYAHYAHAHAHA WOW

---
this is already the best xp/hr course in the game does it really need buffs
---
With 60 def, you can only be a main or a piety pure. Piety pures stop at 70 def, mains go to 99.
---
Tbh Id make a simple pure like framed (or is it torvesta?) Has in their beginner "making a pure" series instead, but I get that that might not be a good option
---
Wait what?
---
integrity

Finally  somebody  that agrees with me

I’m sure

Crazy. 2 years ago this was me with jad. Now this is me with zuk. My brain turns to mush as soon as zuk spawns. 9 zuk attempts with no end in sight.
---
Hey man to be honest idk what game center is but I get it...
---
Try logging into your RuneScape account on the RuneScape website 
---
Go into the account tab
---
Go to the email tab
---
Change your email, check all your emails for the link to change it and if it goes to none, contact jagex support about it
---
As a player since day 1, I suggest you only play RuneScape locally meaning by their client etc. 
---
Once you get it back, change your password for good keeping and, put authenticator on.
---
Gl.
---
For some reason a lot of people on this sub dont know how the automated system works and the solutions to different problems, thinking a locked account is the end.
---
Please make it a short ftp quest.
---
Remember zuk is rather easy, it's the jads and other monsters that are what make you fail.
---
This will be what brings me back

Ever played rs3 at least it isn't so slow to do everything

God damn that look fuckin nice I’m sorry but ima have to copy you, what’s the top?

Thank you guys for all the suggestions!! This is what I'm ending with! Cape of Skulls and/or Team Cape X are 2 items I may switch into and maybe Black Satchel but I don't know yet! :)

!remindme 2 days
---
Multiple times in [Q&amp;As](https://clips.twitch.tv/CorrectTameElkWoofer) they mentioned that they have no intention of creating discontinued items. That one was about 2 hours before they announced the change lol. It was stated in the Oct 2nd [blog](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/old-school-runescape-twisted-league?oldschool=1) with the poll questions as well, concerning both tradeable and untradeable rewards:
---
&gt;Q: If I don't compete in this league will I still be able to get the Twisted League rewards in the next league?
---
&gt;A:  ... We will not make discontinued rewards with leagues.
---
They admitted in a [Q&amp;A](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e6o1ci/old_school_developer_qa_transcript_05122019/) two weeks ago that, "... **we had not considered whether or not they'd become effectively discontinued and whether they'd be different between leagues**. We fail to agree on what the best approach may be...".
---
It was always clear they'd be untradeable, but that doesn't mean discontinued. Even the devs weren't decided yet on whether they'd be the same from league to league. So it in fact was not polled to never be obtainable again, and the poll blog was very clear everywhere that they wouldn't make discontinued items - *effectively* discontinued or otherwise.
---
The people throwing tantrums are probably upset that the devs are going back on their word which they repeated many times, that the very first discontinued items are being added without a poll, and that the community is somehow so sure they were always meant to be discontinued that it feels a little gaslight-y. It's not the end of the world, but they have some reason to be confused and upset.

No they don’t lmao. If you believe that then I have a gorgeous bridge to sell you.

Try zezima cc. Quite a friendly and helpful bunch.

Its tradeable?! Alright I'll just keep grinding out profit snake instead

Actually the Team Cape X is bright blue on the inside so it throws it all off

Have fun taking it easy, being medicated, and scapin :)

nah, that's the KOTH/pepto bismol/blue drink shit on the left

hey man, I literally just recovered one of my older accounts that I didn't know much about(last signed in over 5000 days ago)[https://imgur.com/a/lNrn36S]. It's possible, I basically just guessed on the recoveries but gave them friend info in the comment box and POTENTIAL ISP info+location of where the account was made
---
That’s super banging
---
What hat is that
---
Yep, had 3 offers in. Selling sultan scales for 270ea, the B ring, and some seeds for birdhouses. Rip
---
Hope this isn’t me soon, almost 95 slay
---
Hey that’s actually not a bad idea
---
I feel that pain.. I went 3554 on my HC. Least you got it now!
---
Found a whip once in catacombs, didn’t feel bad
---
I wonder how many hours he's got.  If he's only been playing for a year, he's done way more with a gimped character than I have in the entire time I've been playing since Ironman became a thing.
---
I love democracy
---
How much more/less complicated are the bosses/raids in osrs compared to other mmos?
---
Lucky for sure to get 3. The rings army super rare though. I've had probably 20+ rings in 1000 kills or so. (Off the top of my head)
---
 I love fashionscape. I love helping people with fashionscape. And I love sharing my ideas. But I hate it when people try to pass off great ideas and outfits that they just stole from other people as their own.
---
I made the original version of that outfit Tuesday last week. [https://imgur.com/a/JmsOr92](https://imgur.com/a/JmsOr92) (Dated below image)
---
I posted the the outfit in to the RuneScape fashionscape discord last Wednesday [https://imgur.com/a/s0JXVzL](https://imgur.com/a/s0JXVzL) (Dated in image)

And here is a picture I have of it from last Thursday ingame.

If you're going to flat out copy someone's style because you've seen it in game or online, please at least credit them before trying to pass it off as your own. All this person has done is copy the base of my outfit and substitute in cheaper items.
---
Can’t splash in Lumbridge anymore
---
is your ego that big to just not let it slide and instead just bash on the person? do you really need to belittle someone just so you feel good? this post is unnecessary and seems like just a egotistic post
---
Dude no one cares
---
God bless
---
Ur not gunna find much luck until u get 94 magic for veng. Long term just get high str and high magic and keep 70 def and dont go higher than 75 atk. Stay 60 if u can tolerate it. 
---
Ur still best off making a f2p pure. 40 atk 40 str 50 range.
---
I love this so so so much? (If given the choice, what color are your character’s eyes?)
---
literally just video editing. and (no offense) he gets some help with that
---
Its not worth because ull hit 99 range way before 99 slay hence “waste xp”
---
Thank you!!
---
yes its dagon'hai
---
Gotcha cheers for the help decided to just cannon to 60 so hp will end a bit higher, I’ll add you when I get on so expect a message from sensive and hopefully we can pk together once I’m ready :)

ikr :P

 So here take this... :D

This is awesome

I play on roughly the same ping as you and I'm wondering how did you adjust to it? At this point, I can't imagine doing triple jads and/or prayer flicking the waves with my current ping
---
How is saying "I'm sorry, it was inappropriate" what you would describe as doubling down? GTFO
---
Can definitely relate.

The chair squeaking while clapping really sold your enthusiasm. Keep up the great work!

so the chances of 0 to 100 attack against a 0 to 50 defense roll is the same as a 0 to 50 attack against a 0 to 25 defense roll? I assumed it was non-linear since it seems like the higher your stats or lower their defenses, the more of a difference it makes, like exponential or polynomial difference.

I havent decided if i want one or not, a friend has them all so ill ask her to borrow and test first! but ty

It's a 50/50 drop. You either get it or you dont. So just get it.

Interesting, so there might be a little hope after all... thanks for your input!

O well that shits bound to happen;
---
It’s kinda pathetic though that we can’t even contact customer support via email; 
---
With out a ticket from the automated system that is a bitch to navigate. 
---
Whoever came up with that idea at Jagex is a complete oxymoron.
---
Very rarely, sometimes barely, but the experience is always exceptionary....ly
---
\*gives internet points
---
Lol, I'm exactly lvl 90 combat but I refuse to enter wild xD
---
You’re kinda not lying; 3 cores in less than 400 kills, a granite hammer too!
---
Back to playing «normal» games like cs and league with friends leaves little time osrs which I enjoy more(as in the gane itself, guess playing a game with friends is more about having fun with friends and not the game you play). Members ran out and since its christmas and I barely have time to play anyways ill let it rest in f2p for a week.
---
I agree, it's stupid that we can't send a simple email or have a ticket. I'd be about 100x happier with the state of Jagex customer support if I could send an email with some guarantee that a human that works at Jagex and knows the game would look at it and give me a response *eventually*. I understand that allowing something like that would have alot of the same volume issues that a live chat would, but I don't care if it takes you a month to get back to me, just don't be **completely unreachable**, and have a real person look at my shit.
---
Wow, people really missed the sarcasm of this comment? That surprises me, usually this sub is good at detecting it
---
Tbh I’d just make a fresh account if this is the case
---
Instead of gear pray switches on offense/defense, I just have to aggro each acc correctly, its kinda fun but got neck pain from that lol

That was amazingly edited and well done. Congrats on the 99!

Literally.

Think how many people out there spend 40 hours a week watching tv, something that is considered socially acceptable. Yet playing a game is not?

If you change your name, your previous name gets locked out for a few months to prevent anyone sniping it.

I can't remember exactly how long but I know someone who switched between 2 names every few months just to keep them to himself.

I'd like to ask for your help in making some fashion scape for my character sometime, if you're interested. You have a great sense of taste.

Might as well leak the name since it got stolen.
---
I would love the music cape, but i think Im quite a few quests off from having them all. Since the first post a lot of people have said it would match and i really want to grind it out!
---
Gz on level 92
---
I wouldn’t prioritize rs, or any other game for that matter, over your family/friends and personal responsibilities. I used to play for hours on end, maybe 6-8 a day, which I know for some isn’t a lot, but that was while balancing a 50 hr a week job as well. It was slowly burning me out not making time for anything else except the constant in-game and irl grind. I’ve got a wife and kid now, still working 40-50hrs a week, so I can only set aside maybe an hour or so a day to play, if that. But honestly, it’s so much more rewarding to spend time with my family than to attain levels or gp. My only regret is not realizing this sooner.
---
Definitely does help having osrs mobile so you’re not stuck only being able to play from a pc or laptop so I can get a farm run in at least if I can’t dedicate any more time to the grind. Anyways, hope you can find your balance, OP. Happy ‘scaping!

The name is already taken by another player, a level 3 with no stats. I double name changed so I could transfer the name.

Is there a way I can loan a bond? I have 4.6m before the price hiked. I have enough hunter level to hunt dragon imps and can make around a mil an hour. Made me regret using money to level my skills tbh.

JMod's please help I know no one will believe me, but I have played since 2007 and I never used a bot nor an auto-clicker. 2 days after I got my TBow my account got hacked and they did steal all my stuff. As a result my account has a perma-ban.

JMod:
---
This account got banned because of the clear evidence we found, which said that it was involved into RWT.
---
P.s. Next time use a better VPN that doesn't suffer from connection loss all the time and switches back to ypur own IP. If you will intend to make 1K at least invest a few bucks into a solid VPN LMAO

I already tried changing it on the website, and in game. It is stolen.
---
osrs-next-diary is better
---
My name IS koop. How dare you
---
Honest question: Why do you HOPE for this? Like not suspect, or have a theory, but you WANT this to be true? Is it because hes popular and you just hate popular things?
---
I've added the name in game, it's taken by another player, except now the characters are lower cased.
---
I see what you did there. Nice.
---
Kiwi icons, good bunch of guys
---
And 22,000 you can pet the pet dog
---
Unfortunately, this means it will never pass, just like warding. Why add fresh content that will improve the game for everyone when some sweaty asshat doesn't want his maxed bankstanding account, that he only logs into to flex on people who dare to question his main's stats, as he 3 tick fishes on his barb village locked UIM because the game stopped being fun so long ago that the only way he can get enjoyment is by making the game arbitrarily more difficult for himself, all the while ignoring his abundantly clear deteriorating mental state. 
---
"A new skill wouldn't be 3 tick fishing, and is therefore exp waste, so it is my duty to vote no in order to protect the integrity of the 2007 spirit!" He says as he delivers the final blow to Vorkath on his 4th account he is playing simultaneously (ironman, btw) with his Dragonhunter Xbow. "Ahh, nostalgia! This is exactly like it was in 2007!"
---
Looks fun ngl
---
Interesting. People always just say this never happens.
---
Im 88kc dry on my Main :(
---
They should make it a grandmaster quest. Requires all of the cat quests to do, maybe more. A dog is living on the street, you walk by him every day. Why not give him a home? He practically thinks your his master already because he follows you around everywhere. Adventures with the Old dog off Varrock.
---
Gertrude says she was walking her cat. The dog kept following her and barking at her. She wants you to investigate why the dog follows people all the time.
---
You follow the dog who leads you into the Varrock sewer. In the sewer he goes into a drain hole. You climb through and follow him, after a long winding cave you think you are underground Morytania because you find vampires down there. You don’t think much of it, you’re down here following a dog. You discover the a second female dog, they sniff butts, then lead you to PUPPIES!!! You decide to take them all to the surface fearing the vampires might suck their blood.
---
You find a latter with a manhole at the top. You climb it and push it open(*new manhole unlocked leading to vampire sewer*)
---
You realize you are in Varrock, you saw the Vampires digging. There headed straight for the castle! 
---
You bring the puppies back to Gertrude and the female dog stays with.
---
You report to King Roland about the Vampires beneath Varrock.
---
King Roland tells you they are violating a treaty, and that you should run to the library and grab the treaty book.
---
You get and read it and bring it to him.
---
He tells you that we have to attack.
---
(Using vampires because of the Morytania expansion coming soon, however another monster could be used instead if the quest is already mostly developed).
---
The attack and rest of the quest are up Jagex. Use my idea, hire me, or dislike into oblivion.
---
Frickin lady pulled out right in front of me on my motorcycle on my way home from work. Broke my tibia and fibula pretty bad had surgery to put a rod in my leg. They got me on pain meds and a bunch of other stuff. The meds I take at night make me real drowsy combined with the pain meds lol.

Maybe 90 con to build it a little dog house or something

Actually i went and tested. it DOESNT work (anymore?). Turns out that the zammy wizard instantly ignores you if you get attacked by a other player and refuses to attack you... maan I thought it would have been a funny way to slap a middle finger on pker but apparently it was maybe instantly figured out.. :/

Yeah I'm fine, why do you ask? I wasn't saying that I held any of those views, just that some people do. Although I am stating facts about feminists that try to ruin games just because they have women that are attractive within the games. But I don't hate them, because it doesn't get you anywhere if you hate a stupid person for their stupidity.

Congrats! Really cool to see. Can you share your inventory/gear?

soi soi soi soi soi soi soi soi soi soi soi soi soi soi soi soi
---
The whole reason clue rewards are so rare in OSRS is because 1)  clues are a pretty rare drop and 2) completing clues is a relatively tedious and drawn out processes.
---
Meanwhile on Twisted League, theres literally a perk that gives you guaranteed clue rewards, and there is only a fraction of steps available compared to the game as a whole.
---
This has nothing to do with “stock rebuttals”, but your blatant ignorance of basic supply and demand principles.

Now this is some quality content right here,  buzzing to see what the gnome stuff turns out like

You can....

---
My guy, you're the one who is wrong. There is nothing in the game that is fully AFK. What he did in this video fits the traditional definition of 'AFK' in the main game - you can do X (usually it's dropping, here it's cutting) and then wait until your inventory is full. 
---
So take your L and move on.

It’s not like this is the only Christmas drop party, lots of them happen mate and you could easily earn the money back from high alching or flipping.

That was actually probably a bug. Iirc there was a song that caused a "memory leak" I'm not gonna act like I know what that means though.

Maybe man, I don’t know of him doing that, just remember them ranked in the emblem cc’s and know they’re a notorious spec tabber

But are we grateful? No.

Use the lunar isle portal in your nexus to bank, then talk to one of the other two bankers to kick yourself off of the island and right next to the boat for Vorkath. Saves you an inventory spot so you can bring more food.

Probably the same people who keep buying all the lemons. I sold 40k units of lemons (only the most premium kind, I don't deal in Tesco brand shit) over the last week. Normally I barely shift a few hundred. Needless to say, Jamal and the other boys at the plantation are eating food tonight. My customers vary wildly but they pay a premium for premium. Pretty sure most of them are closet fiddler's though, they're always hanging around gnomes tryna do some Uber Eats shit but I've seen them slipping alcoholic lemon drinks on the down low. Absolute weapons. We keep it simple in this trade, they don't ask about Jamal's "wage" and I don't ask about their gnome diddling. One fella got gnomes on booty call though I swear, one of my best customers so I won't disrespect him him but my god it's fucked. Last I heard the bloke got horny killing zuk, pulled out his phone mushroom thing, then bam!! Five seconds later the lad was getting sucked off by a gnome while zuk watched!!! Zuk, more like cuk!!

Your original account is in rs3. Os is completly new servers, everyone started from beginning
---
!remind me 3 days
---
Your account is on rs3. Everyone restarted in osrs
---
no to all of them you can see im logged in lumbridge - the account is old school 100% as i have a friends list on there also..
---
Some things are direct Microsoft sam.  Others are spliced together and edited...like the hahAhahaohwow thing.

This is old school runescape, if you played this account on rs3 it doesn't transfer over to osrs. Everyone had to start fresh

No. His account is in rs3

Afk is not low actions per minute, low clicks per minute is click intensity...
---
Afk is how frequenly you need to do said actions. If you have to click once every 30 seconds thats verry low click intensity but it's not afk, yet its less clicks per minute than my fishing which is more afk even with extra clicks because you only need to do it every 3 or so minutes.

Worst: GWD and everything after it

Best: Runelite
---
My god. Instantly closed my client, shut off my computer and lit it on fire. Miss me with that straight shit.
---
How do you know another character has it if you can't see them on the high scores?
---
Definitely not worth on a normal account, debatable on an iron long term but i also prefer it because the kill times are way faster on avg and have a way better chance of the sub 50 kill.
---
Thanks I got it in tutorial island
---
allow us to turn him into warm clothing for Wintertodt

OP made sure to tag this post with ‘humour’ to not get perma banned lmao
---
Hi!
---
If you're not enjoying grinding anymore. just take a break and find another game :) I'll see you on OSRS in 6 months ;)
---
Because I added the name in game and now assigned to someone and lower cased
---
hahah so true
---
Osrs is a brand new game that came out in 2013 that share the same login info and friends list as your runescape account but you had to start back at tutorial island since it was a brand new game. Did you start over sometime after 2013 or are you just thinking of the account you used to play before 2013?
---
Tbow rebuild is where it’s at
---
Your friends list with your old rs3 account is shared
---
Why not just keep the same throphies for all leages, there would be a read option on the throphy telling you what seasons you got said throphy in.
---
Im imagining you being able to put on display somewhere in your house, so the if you want the dragon throphie you can get it in later leagues but the read option on it only show what seasons you got dragon in.
---
I'm just trying to get a mods attention brotha. I appreciate the communities help as they've given great advice, but only a mod can fix this. It honestly should be an easy fix.
---
Are you asking for the best or worse or both? I haven't followed it closely enough to say if it is the worst or not, but the BH Rework likely makes the shortlist. I mean it was announced at 2 RuneFests only to get delayed years. Then when they finally release it, it was rush and unpolled while leaving a lot of PvPers unhappy and preferring the old system.
---
For updates that have been around longer and that I know a bit better, it is hard to pick a worst since most are just eh and not downright terrible. I'd probably go with Mage Arena 2. On release, it was very lackluster using recolored demons. It has been improved, but it is still a fairly lackluster and disappointing way to earn a new BiS Magic Cape when players were hoping for something closer to an Inferno for the new Magic and Ranged Capes. At least Ranged was locked behind a Grandmaster Quest and a decently hard boss.
---
Ok, but how is that relevant?
---
Alright thank you I appreciate it :)
---
I personally just go on the website on my phone and pay. I've never had to use google pay with it.
---
Can you just buy membership on the website? Usually there's a "full site" option and it should work like a pc
---
Buy a google play card at the store voila
---
We know
---
Op this would also work well lol

Bro are you saying you used to drug your parents with sleeping pills UNKNOWINGLY as a child, in order to play rs all night?
---
its almost like the game isnt built around Ironmen!
---
For some reason cant login there, says my password or login iš incorrect, while I can connect through app using same login and psw
---
You mean you didn't?
---
Go to the osrs website on mobile and purchase it there.
---
Lol. Sound logic.
---
What happened?
---
As a pker bh2 was the worst for pking overall.
---
One thing to mention regarding your project, be careful with osrs ge data as it is capped in terms of daily prices changes. 
---
This means that huge price rises like Arcane 140M &gt; 110M &gt; 130M are not captured. 
---
I did a stock prediction one using this. Gotta change the data pull to Yahoo. He didnt add volume in to his stack but he has a good example of how you scale two series into one stack (the 3/6 day moving average)

went into the pit with my level 9 main and lost can someone plz explain what im doing wrong
---
Thanks I'm donating 20 dollars to venuzalean aid as discussed in 25 buttholes lasted vid (it's a serious vid) but you can continue arguing with people and telling them their wrong lmao
---
No but I’ve also played since 04 and my only achievement cape is fire. Guess I was doing it wrong all those years as a kid.
---
Still do
---
Nothing to do with running on java lmfao, it's just how it's coded.
---
If newer code would handle this differently than older code that would be even WORSE spaghetti code btw. Spaghetti code is usually caused by bad documentation/not planning ahead. Like when people think "hey I want to make this", and create their own implementation, with their own bugs and specifics, while 20 people before them did the same. Unspaghetti-ing code is creating one (modular) implementation so everything is the same everywhere and you don't have to worry about 100 things doing the same thing in different ways.
---
Kind of a ramble, but what I'm trying to say is adding yet another way to do things only adds to the pile of spaghetti, even though it may handle some things better.
---
We all live the same life
---
Wait why are you talking about DHCB, kinda lost on what youre on about there but the numbers in that first comment 31 and 27 are both melee numbers. I have no idea on what the EHB is with dhcb since its not really worth it on an iron imo.
---
EHB is actually 32 kills per hour with camping lance (normal method max gear)
---
They managed to clean up some bot farms. Zulrah bots for example seem to be dealt with if I recall correctly. This script is fairly simple I imagine so maybe a heads up will be enough for them to take action. Or so I'm hoping at least.
---
Just double checked again, can login to the app with email and psw, cant to osrs site to buy bonds or membership. Wtf?????
---
Cant login there, neither using email or nick name. But Can login to the osrs app with same details
---
I'm at 1k kc without so its not as bad, but i feel you man. Goodluck getting that claw soon!
---
Legal issues
---
At least you can teleport

Yeah no wonder that's your biggest achievement. You lack dedication.

---
Them level 90 mains will cause some real trouble if theres 3 or more in black dhide lol.
---
Nice.
---
Agreed it added an accent colour. Most people's fashionscape goes way too hard into one/two colours where having accents like the blue hair matching the top stands out.
---
Thanks I’ll try
---
????? What? How would it be legal issues if jagex owns the symbols. (or at least i think they do. They may also be so common images that they can't be copyrighted)
---
Ad money is ad money bro, how much have you donated to the site to keep is running?
---
You absolute dork lmao get a grip
---
?????
---
Frog legs taste almost exactly like chicken wings. (Like blind taste test you probably couldn’t tell, maybe even not blind cuz they look pretty similar too)
---
So frog legs in situations where chicken would be good would taste excellent, like a burger or fries on their own. But imagine chocolate covered chicken wings, nasty.
---
!RemindMe 2 days

Brother in law, what are you doing
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Game_updates
---
Its not really a secret that people who play osrs all day are often involved in RWTing. 
---
What do you actually think where all the loot from maxed pethunters goes lol
---
Nice bro, is your horse feeling better now?
---
Realistically, I would recommend going for barrows gloves before anything else. Quests are a lot more important than barrows pieces early on. There's nothing your account requires money for in its current state. Do every quest you can that has little to no requirements and this will open up doors to new quests. This is a lot more efficient than low level barrows.
---
What?? You literally just need to take a different Amy out when you melee. That has nothing to do with being casual lmao
---
You got it, king. Push through.
---
As long as you have the 2nd pool upgrade you’re fine, it  replenishes run energy &amp; spec so just have an altar in your house too. Eat food on water birth bank before getting kicked off island.

Can you livestream the keg of beer next

Yeah I’m just upset that I can’t recover my old main account and I don’t feel like developing another main nor do I want to prioritize it over say hitting the gym or working on my side hustles.

I just wish I could get my 2006/07 main back
---
I just used to bring a 4 dose of anti, with the variety of bosses he would spawn ever so often anyway
---
nice how bye matches up with the jump of joy
---
I just saw this episode.
---
You can efficiently start zulrah with as little as a regular trident, blowpipe, a fury, and elite void mage/range. 75 mage and range req for weapons, 40 prayer req for the fight. Higher is better for mage, range, defence, prayer, and hp.
---
Don't even play osrs anymore but I stick around on this subreddit for content like this. I swear nothing makes me laugh harder than most of the posts I see on here like this.
---
Hey i cant argue with that tbh runescape is a game and if ur not making money off it just have fun! Fuck what others think lol
---
They said they are looking at around 1 leagues per year ish
---
Stamina potions and start questing your ass off.
---
My guess is that herb runs didn't pay for the OP inventory, which was the implied question
---
It's like others have said, osrs requires a creation of a brand new character. Characters from rs3 cannot be migrated over. My friend has had the same exact experience and I had to explain this whole thing to him.
---
lmao so this
---
&gt;How’s it not relevant?
---
I didn't know, so i asked.
---
Agree on the hair, it adds a nice contrast. This kind of gets into monochrome blur territory. It all looks great, just needs that little accent pop.
---
My next post will be a petition to have "Happy Jads" added as the new BIS boot option for all combat styles
---
Mobile is best for me. Worst? I wouldn't call them worst. I just don't partake in them. But bh2 is probably up there judging the community's response.
---
Gnome cocktails please

No it was off it was a bot I am 100% sure about it

Hey dude. Awesome to see a newer player enjoying the game and not letting lower levels hold you back! Hit me up in game some time soon and I'll hook you up with some equipment that will last you a really long time at your current level.
---
I'm k_unit
---
And if you aren't already in one I'd like to invite you to join our clan, theoslounge. We have a lot of really active players both high level and just starting out and we mainly just chat and help each other and give advice plus some occasional bossing and clan events.
---
Reply with your ign so I know who I'll be talking to though!

😂😂😂😂😂🙌🙌🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙊🙊😾💨
---
Ge standing in good gear asking for money is a good afk money maker
---
Its basically scamming cuz they tend to imply your generosity would be rewarded
---
ur last 2 comments on reddit have both been toxic! I hope you have a better week starting monday seems this week has been pretty stressful for you :)
---
No OSRS is the normal weenie hut. Runescape classic is the salty spitoon
---
I mean if bots could intercept names that easily name trading wouldnt be viable. Someone had to know a banned account name got unbanned.
---
Mr bug advertised like a 5b drop party, but didn't plan ahead and buy items to drop. He clearly underestimated just how much money he had, cuz he was buying like rune sets to drop. Several hours in, he had only gotten rid of a couple bil. His chat was complaining that the world was full, and his stream was on a huge delay, so he would hop to a world, drop stuff, then realize he hadn't told people which world, so he would say it after the drop, but by the time people got to that world, the drops were gone.
---
He then decided to give half of it away on f2p for some reason, which took even longer, so he had people buy items for him and trade him them so he could pay market value and increase his effective buy limit. Naturally, a bunch of people scammed him and sold him un-combined items, which tend to have advertised GE prices way above their actual value (for example, selling him a wyvern visage for 50m, despite the ancient wyvern shield only being 25m)
---
It was a combination of a lack of experience, a lack of planning, and a lack of perspective on how popular a several bil drop party would be.
---
Further inspection indicates it's indeed an elysian.
---
Ah thanks, my eyes are bad
---
That or, "silnthntr, stop playing your game! I'm waiting on a phonecall." Oh the dial-up days...
---
Hey remember when you said you were leaving then got baited back by a generic comment?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Why are you screaming at me at the top of your lungs at how much of a pathetic hypocrite you are?  I knew that as soon as you tried shittalking reddit after immediately resorting to usual reddit condescending trash lul.
---
\&gt;Not a single one of your comments in this thread is above 1 comment karma, whereas all of mine that relate to the original topic are.
---
....I hate to break it to you but most of my argument-related comments in this thread are at above 1 karma.  Facts literally do not care about your feelings.
---
\&gt;Any further concerns can be addressed by comparing our comment histories, I'll leave that to you.
---
Sure.  You seem to take downvotes/upvotes as an indication of anything (because you're a fucking child pretending to be anything else lul), so let's see.
---
Using redective....
---
The account hatesranged (me) has a karma per comment ratio of 11.4.  The account RockTheRaccoon (you) has... between 5 and 6.  Wanna know why that is?  Because I'll be upvoted tomorrow, but you'll be braindead forever.
---
I guess that's it.  I've hoisted you by your own fucking petard.  How did you say it?  Oh right.  Sit kid.
---
EDIT: I love how even the subreddit found your other comment so pathetic that it removed it to save you the embarrassment.  You're free to check it in incognito to see.  I like how you admitted you're the one embarrassed by your behavior, and decided to see what would happen if you kept saying embarrassing stuff.

Omg!!!!!

Besides you not reading his reply, everything you said came straight from your ass on your idea of him

You know osrs and rs3 are different right? As in you have to start fresh regardless if your old main was banned.

U can boost it ? U need 82

You (almost) never get hacked by someone “figuring” out your password, either you clicked a wrong website or smt or somehow downloaded a keylogger.

I needed ahrims top and bottom did four slayer tasks had enough to to buy it myself
---
can we talk about how poor of an attempt that A qp was tho
---
assuming you have enough for a dhcb and not enough for a tbow, vorkath is way better, you can easily half-heartedly afk vork with no issues. you dont worry about switches or anything, you can use slayer staff to autocast as well so u never touch your spellbook. Although the average gp for zulrah is like 10k above what vorks average gp is, zulrah kills tend to be a lot longer anyhow. For me, i am 98 ranfe and have no less than 5 kill trips even with my garbage 80def and 80 mage. In an hour i get ~25kills which totals to around 3m/h
---
You finally sold your regen brace because you knew it would never go back above 2m, let alone 3m? I know the feeling. Grats on b gloves though.
---
I’m honestly super curious to see what the odds are of a lv20 Dark Wizard killing a maxed player with no armor, weapons, prayer, or food in a fight to the death.  
---
For anyone willing enough to do the math, the relevant stats of a lv20 Dark Wizard are 24HP, Level 6 Magic (casting a spell with a max hit of 6 and a speed of 2.4s or 4 ticks), and Level 5 Defence.
---
I doubt you need to search for "buy/sell gold" for google to register you might be interested.

How do you know what 12 year old girls text like mate

Do I have a cult for you. I’m the sole proprietor of the first church of RuneScape. Daily, we tithe superior dragon bones to the stray do in Varrock. Hit me up if you would like your first set of bones courtesy of the church.

It really does cleanse your soul and provide a great gold sink.

Thanks for ruining my money making method

Glad I could help

thanks. I changed my Pw but still doesnt let me login

Very possible. I cant say I've ever had one on either my computer or phone though.

there already is banner ads/donation links.

Thanks! I tried it earlier and it worked! Got the account back, I'm stoked!
---
Well that’s messed up no wonder RS is dying
---
Its a world wide tradition to indulge in blantant consumerism in christmas
---
So some of that spending craze is going to buying gp the legitimate way.
---
making a habit of being a mongo here eh?
---
correct! Got the account back, but when I logged in to osrs it was a lvl 3 on tutorial island.
---
In RS3 I have everything I used to have, which is nice. But I think I'm sticking with osrs, to be honest.

Dumb question, but does f2p have access to the collection log? I just started playing osrs after like a four or five year hiatus, and I'm interested in seeing all the new items and such.
---
It worked exactly like you said, but much quicker: got my account back after 30 minutes!

I'm glad I asked it here, when I saw the permanent ban I thought that was it..

Can you share a screenshot of your loadout— I’m curious on how you do this.  Is BGS faster than claws with this method?
---
Barrows gloves are more important than a torso, well at least like rune gloves if hes that strapped for cash
---
Or using an NPC to clean them for you instead of selling them on GE?
---
If you go higher than 86-87% you start getting bolt racks, which absolutely tank your profit vs runes.
---
I thought about it, but i'm quite disorganised with preperation idk if it would turn into a good video
---
The only thing that should be available to everyone is the slayer helm reskin because it augments an item that is already in the game. The rest of it should be untradeable because it is unique to twisted league. That's my opinion.
---
Tim Allen boys
---
Pk never gets updates and that's the only updates I care about. All updates this year have made pvp worse. Non tradeable runepouches &amp; looting bags, BH and LMS not having any good rewards or being fun. Still no 30-second pj timer. But hey, at least ironmen got sand place
---
Yeah they will be included i'll just do 1 along with another piece of gnome food
---
Patience and time
---
Depends on the dose. Low dose feels like being drunk, except kinda funny to move around cause it feels like you're moving all your limbs individually. Good for rolling around on the floor laughing with your mates (or by yourself).
---
Higher dose you just close your eyes and float. Lose all sense of direction and space, you know you're stationary in your room but it feels like you're spinning in zero-g. Combine with the right music and you're in for a treat and some very nice closed eye visuals. 
---
Never taken a super high dose so can't comment on that, but it's one of the comfiest recreational drugs you can do tbh.

You can send the owners runescape name to Jagex if you want him banned.

Other than that what do you expect? It's a 3rd party website so he is free to sell his add spaces to a RWT site.

You do know that incognito still saves your ad data and stuff in cookies... incognito just prevents history nowadays. You can search something on your phone then go incognito on your laptop and you'll see ads for it.

I mean you can just buy cheese potatoes from the warriors guild which I think does the same as monk fish iirc. I always fished the monk fish anyways because I just hate hopping world's and shop buying.
---
Think of all the time you spend watching Netflix or scrolling through social media and replace that with RS. Also playing at work on mobile.
---
Nope from level 1.

It’s so ridiculous that people are butthurt over this. Why would you ever in a million years expect to be able to get a trophy for a league you did not participate in? Out of everything this is real ezscape whining about “not being able to obtain everything”. Here’s an idea, not everything should able to be obtained by everyone (especially retroactively). You don’t play the league, why the hell would you get the rewards? People need to stop crying about participation trophies and not having any discontinued items. I actually miss the rares (phat, mask, Santa) and the prestige that came along with obtaining those items (because of their rarity and the fact that they were discontinued). Why would you be complaining that you can’t obtain an item if you chose not to do the content, or put in the work? Not to mention they do not effect game play in anyway and are completely useless cosmetic items - not even wearable just for your fucking PoH.
---
Of course Zulu whining in the comments like he always does about everything.
---
yes. but karams are superior unless you want more afk, as karams you catch so many/hr  you have to bank constantly.
---
you can also buy a shit ton of low tier food (lob and tuna) at jatizo, and post glory+karamja hard diary you can buy around 2k karams an hour using parcel service at tai bwo village.

Allow us to force the stray dog to eat Evil Dave’s rats, which will turn him into a hellhound and then we fight and kill him.

You’re supposed to do it with mory hard diary. Most of the money comes from runes
---
Easy loot
---
If you’re making up for the cost of your runs, you’re doing absolutely fine. Especially with your stats. Just continue and eventually the big drops will come
---
That’s one way to foreplay pre orgy
---
This idea is basically a item sink for chaos rune.
---
that's probably going to sell for 20-30 gp more in a few months. 300k x 20 gp = profit
---
Dude, wow. Cookbook when?
---
Yup, leave it to the shitty reddit "cancel culture" fuckers to whine about every little thing
---
That isn't what I asked. You said Afk means "as low actions per minute as possible" and that's simply not true. In "osrs sense" or not, that isn't what afk means. I think everybody on this thread has established you really don't know what you are talking about.
---
24, Two Kids, Wife, Two part time jobs (25 hrs per week each) and my own business. Also going to school full time (4 classes per semester.)
---
I play at night for ~30 minutes 3/5 of the week days. I also try to get in ~2-3 hours on the weekend. Sometimes as much as 6 hrs. 
---
My wife understands that playing video games is my escape. She understands that I don't have time for an active social life so my discord friends are really important to me. 
---
I also have access to mobile - if I'm having a rough day- sometimes I'll stay up till 10 or so playing on my phone.
---
I DON'T have social media. I DON'T go out to bars. I DON'T watch TV (except for like Sofia the First and Super Monsters w/ my kids.) We don't even have cable. My life is centered around my family and my ability to provide for them. OSRS (or video games in general) are my escape, my drug, my stabilizer.
---
Things I let slip:
---
-I don't walk my dogs as much as I should.
---
-I am knowingly lazy when it comes to chores. I take care of all the pets but my wife does pretty much everything else.
---
-Sometimes I'm too interested in my games and it can cause me to miss things that I should emphasis in my kids lives. Sometimes they come home with crafts or learn new things at school and they want to share it but I can be closed off when I'm on my games.
---
-I don't go to the gym. I'm not obese but I'm pretty big - I've gained alllllot of weight since I came into my kids' life. I'm 6'6" and 280lbs.
---
-I only have sex maybe 2-3 times a month. This can be bothersome to my wife if she's in the mood and I'm not.
---
It's not easy. Sometimes I wake up feeling just as exhausted as I was when I went to bed. I do have my fair share of zombie days.
---
Also make is so we can trade him food, but no accept trade button.
---
lmao wtf, how can he play like that? no hand on F1-F4? casual

Can you explain this?

Saw this on YouTube a few days ago and now I see you on here ayee
---
This is not a google ad, the image is stored on their server and is directly in the source code, not served from an ad server like Adsense. They chose this ad.
---
Guess we're mad about Crystalmathlabs now.
---
Either its coded into the page, or its adsense. Either way, I dont care and neither should you.
---
My parents just gave up on trying to force me to have a bed time.
---
This is my gaming phone. I only have games and never click any links in games. I don’t even browse the web on this phone.
---
Not in this situation, this is not a google ad.
---
It isn't even from an advertising service, they chose this ad directly.
---
Yep
---
You’re stepping into shady territory if you bring any risk. Be careful if you add clan members on discord, there’s ways to get your ip.
---
Why don't you go on the site and find the exact same ad? Because you will find it, regardless of your search history. This has nothing to do with cookies.
---
Nah, i did have to order them from vietnam though because i got a spider at the same time
---
Awesome!
---
uh you shouldn't need both ad blockers. just stick with Ublock Origin
---
Ah yes, the feet guy
---
You can go far, there’s tons of end game content, and an active player base. You can find a clan if you want to do some bossing with other people. Alternatively, have you checked out Ironman mode?
---
Yeah I don’t do any of that. I literally only use this phone for reddit, YouTube and random games that are trusted such as Pubg and Call of duty.
---
How much is all this?
---
I dont disagree you shouldn’t do it, but people do dumb stuff. My entire point is if theres no mutual benefit to you irl via rwt or gaining gp to use for your main I don’t see why all your accounts need to be banned. Perm ban the account with the offense and move on.
---
I mean where else do you get garlic? can u farm it?
---
Selling BCP for a Torture means he can have Fury and Torture so your example doesn't make sense. Then again I doubt OP has done, or plans on doing, BA for a Torso.
---
not use the website? I can use runeclan.... or max cape. (not sure if maxcape supports osrs though)
---
🙃
---
Yes and no if you have around 4 people that can tele block and click their spec wep of choice you'll get kills most of the time
---
Bruh that doesn’t mean stooping low as fuck and hard coding an rwt site ad into your site, that’s like saying it’s ok to rob someone cause “it costs money to live”
---
How hard is it to say congrats and move on? Or even say nothing and move on? And even if you want to give your opinion... you gave it. That's it. That's the end. If he doesn't want to use your advice, that's his problem. Time to move on.
---
Couple of spice stores have it I believe and maybe a few other random spawns but you don’t get much.

* Menu Entry Swapper

* Status Bars

How hard is it to accept that people are just trying to help and there's very little in the way of aggressiveness from these people? From the comments I can see 90% of them are friendly and just offering advice to OP that will make his progress faster/easier.

---
Contact your bank and ask them to block transactions from jagex Ltd. You'd just have to prove your standard banking information to them such as name and social (if you're in the US anyway)
---
Then if you ever wanted to start membership back up, you'd have to contact the bank again to unblock them.
---
Alternatively, if you know your email that you used to create the account you can log in with that. Reset password if you can't remember it, then cancel the membership via the website.
---
Hopefully either of those works for you.
---
man i just don't get how does missing out on a cosmetic trophy that you didn't even or can't even compete for is bothering you? if i couldn't get it i wouldn't be this mad, come on man people want to have fun and be rewarded for it, how does this affect you in any way? please tell me
---
Are you talking about me ?
---
Samurai boots are bis iirc
---
Or one of those piece is pretty good
---
“Ultimate cc” too
---
Non stackable bait fills inventory so you can only collect 1 fish per catch average instead of 3, so you get the basic afk time of 1x fishing, with a slightly longer cut time than the normal dropping is
---
To start bring 20 feathers, fill inv with fish, cut to roe drop feathers and offcuts when full of roe and use roe as bait till ur full, repeat
---
You have to have no stackable bait for this to work which is why only bring 20 feathers or so to fill first inv then drop bait
---
Sure, and it also depends on whether you're potted/praying etc, the intent with my post was just to point out that fury is actively worse in many cases than a 1200 gp amulet. I'm far from a hyper-efficient player myself, I just like to see people educated about their decisions and making the best use of their money.
---
finally Kob has done it, the long awaited 8 cb cape! he has been assuring me he could do it and he have finally proved it to the world!

I train fast clicking on them, every now and then I just hop like 20 worlds and report all gambling and yt video bots
---
It also works best if you can fish sturgeon as they have a 100% cut rate, same as salmon if you have 80+ cooking
---
If he can't figure it out, he shouldn't be accepted into the clan
---
You can also report them,takes like 2 ticks after training
---
Fingers
---
&gt; There’s no reason to have it changed outside the fact you don’t like having to do it
---
So there is another reason then, a lot of people dislike it. The reason we have polls is to let community vote on what they like and want to be changed, so yeah, there is need to be continually changed.

this but just less scales being used because fewer pkers are consuming scales. nothing to do with dismantling in my opinion

that kind of change so quickly is just random market fluctuation id say

Bullshit, its Zezima. He's fucking back Baby!!!
---
you cant unless you change your ip permanently, your ip will always be associated
---
He's got a point though - this community abuses "afk." I've seen minnows and ardy agility be called afk here.
---
I also agree with him- having to click ~50 times every three minutes is not afk.
---
Cooking is afk, you click like 4 times between loads.
---
Redwoods are afk, cause you can chop until you get 5 minute logged.
---
Nmz is afk, because you reup absorbs and ovls every five minutes.
---
are you an iron? Doesn’t seem worth to skip just for hydra if you’re a main

He'd say that because it's a win win, and he knows it. If he doesn't do it again nothing changes, and if he does people will all be like "OMG HE DID IT"
---
You're a drama whore, you have no value and find meaning in life through obsessive documentation of others shortcomings. Rendi said 1 thing which he promptly apologized for and you're STILL obsessing over it. Pathetic.

Yeah I saw a yt video of him deleting the screenshot in discord, but he already deleted the video.
---
This sounds like a good idea to me but I pretty much guarantee that the champions challenge code is spaghetti and old as shit. I bet this would be a bigger job that expected, for very little payoff
---
I love the first girls reaction “yay? 🤷‍♀️” hahaha
---
Nah not an iron. 99 slayer already and enjoy farming hydra lol started doing it to rebuild and now i prefer it over vorkath and I'm stubborn cause my rng is blah. Cancelled my 500 streak a while back when i first started hydra cause i wasted 2k points without getting them as a task. This way its much easier i can just pick what tasks i want to do really. And if i ever need points again I could just boost pretty fast anyways. I dont need points anymore tho anyways.

That's how my main osrs account is. I wish I could just bring my dude back from rs3. So many quests and shit I never want to do again
---
This game has made me look at the world differently. 
---
Everything you do in runescape can be measured in gp per hour.
---
So I took that and now I'm applying it to the real world, every action has a monetary value whether its gardening or making pan flutes out of the vast bamboo forest in my yard.
---
This is literally posted every single low lvl fire cape thread...
---
Look I dont wanna be rude dude, but it's a rare drop table roll. It's not that big of a deal man
---
Settle down, Rendi.
---
My uncle has a bamboo forest in his back yard. Could make lots of cool things out of that.
---
I grinded the 77 rc for fremmy elite and tbh its a fun &amp; relaxing grind
---
Cool! Watched the rangers game today, Kreider out there not wasting xp today.
---
Blessed account
---
Little dude wants a few pieces of candy
---
How about a yak pak. A yak that follows you and has an extra inventory, the downside you cannot run.
---
i think the likelihood of getting a barrows piece is about 1/17. if you want to make money keep doing what you're doing but some good goals at this level of the game are getting a fighter torso (which you can do for free), getting a helm of neitiznot by completing the fremenik isles quest, and getting barrows gloves (or rune gloves at least) by doing recipe for disaster.

At level 22 he could have 5,624 xp - 6,291 xp. Silk stalls give 24 xp/theive so ~250 theives to this level. Rate of pet is 1/68,926 so chance of not getting pet in 250 is (68,925/68,926)^250 or 0.9999854917. Subtract 1 gives the chance of getting at least one rocky in 250 silk stall steals (~level 22) which is 0.0000145083 or 0.00145%.

Tried to buy a girlfriend in the town square. Ended up in jail for a few nights. 0/10 would not recommend.
---
Just give me the lvl 3 one already
---
&gt;fandom
---
Lmao
---
A little less but still afkable
---
I stopped doing the guardians after I got pinned in dusk's prison 3 times in a row.
---
yeah use burp suite to intercept the udp packets and get ida pro to decompile the html to pass it into adptool which will list you all the ads on the site
---
Yes it is. Of you want to kill the game for a quick few bucks. The sooner the gamemode dies the better off the future of rs will be.
---
Step 1: stop botting
---
Step 2: dont use your accounts on the same IP
---
Step 3: stop botting 
---
Step 4: play the game legit
---
Yep lay in bed playing my brand new GameBoy SP till they both go to bed. Then slowly creep downstairs to turn on my dad’s laptop and game all night.
---
I even remember downloading battlefield 2 on my mom’s computer so I could play that at night... till the day my dad caught me. Him Being a Master Sergeant at the time, to say the least my dad was furious and retired my RuneScape career.
---
It really is luck. I got the RC pet while getting fremenik exiles prereqs too. 
---
That being said, fuck the sand casino.
---
&gt;cause I KNOW it *isnt* fake
---
There's no way to get one in Twisted League.
---

---
Oh yeah def just rng lol. And out of thousands ofc some are gonna get luckier than others haha.
---
I'd recommend switching to tank gear, obsidian only has the stats of adamant iirc
---
"didn't have WiFi"
---

---

---
