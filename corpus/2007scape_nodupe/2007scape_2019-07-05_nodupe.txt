Some people seem to genuinely like RS3 for some things like the quests and bosses (never did the bosses outside the dungeoneering ones, so I have no opinion on those), but there are many more who seem to play RS3 only because of the time sink on their accounts.

&gt; It only takes bot makers a short amount of time to rewrite a script to get around stuff so yeah it would slow them down but only for a short time while real players would always be effected
---
But how? How do you write a script that can identify a specifc random object in a fluid pool of random objects that change colors, scale and dimension? 
---
You'd need machine learning AI to do that, and even then it wouldn't be flawless.
---
Thats not how those surveys work. Unless you're typing your info into them or MAYBE they have your email address and someone matches that to a database dump. Other than that they can't just get your account info from that shit.

Idk about your level demographic projection for these anti-mtx but I'm relatively low level (85) but its irrelevant since I've been past level 40 a few times since 2004. For accuracy you should go around saying "This is how you can tell anti-MTXers have played for like 30 hours tops"
---
Its only slightly off peak population count right now and I just hopped at mole until the limit and 8/22 of the worlds were taken. That means you have a 75% chance of finding a free world on the your first try. I think you guys might be being a bit dramatic.

A cape like this but with all in-game god symbols and RS instead of LV would be pretty neat as a parody cape you can wear in-game lol.

Still, could have left it at Nieves cousin.
---
why are you talking about osrs? I've been talking about runescape as a whole.
---
They solved the random event that already exists with the rotation objects so it is likely. The problem is the random has to be something that can also be coded into the game so it can't be too random or crazy of images.
---
OP is just a small indie-memer trying to get funded.

Runescape is dying right? That's why it's been steadily growing for quite some time. No wonder you're getting downvoted

Jagex investors wish they were that cup

Unpopular Fact: People will buy gold regardless of the existence of Bonds.
---
I only mentioned that because people thought I didn't take any and also they were collage classes I took through high school.
---
I don't know shit about business, so I would like an explanation.
---
These changes, yeah, that might be able to bring in a lot of extra short term profit.
---
But isn't it obvious that long term profit will plummet so much that the game shuts down? It won't be soon, but this game will eventually become less and less popular until even whales couldn't support the game.
---
Isn't this just the beginning of a drawn out suicide by Jagex? What are they thinking?
---
So the answer is to add more? I wish bonds would get deleted but that's never happening

D defender. Barrows gloves. Fire cape. 70 prayer.

Can Anyone explain What mtx is? Out of The loop here
---
Currently the plan is, if your hit chance with a spell is always 0, ie splash only, and you're in that Lumbridge area it will not prodive xp, but the way they worded it it seems they plan on taking it out completely down the line.
---
they didn't poll it
---
It's probably not worth doing day 1.
---
Uhh it’s MTX.
---
Dont worry guys. All is forgiven due to the bank rework.
---
 **Microtransactions** (sometimes abbreviated as MTX) are a business model where users can purchase virtual goods with micropayments. **Microtransactions**are often used in free-to-play games to provide a revenue source for the developers.
---
Either way, y'all are super worked up about fuckin red skin on runescape
---
People went to lumby because there is a high abundance of rats and a large group of people. Makes you feel like part of the community or something.
---
Same reason most people afk hangout at the GE
---
Beneath the surface each object has a unique ID. OSRS being a Java game means bots can hook into the client and "see" what all the IDs are.  There isn't any way to visually block those, the shape shifting randoms are around from when color-based bots were used (which can not access object IDs).  
---
The "null zone" idea was done in RS Classic 15 years ago, (look up the "disk of returning")  
---
In RS2 randoms were changed to teleport your player to a random area but the randoms are no longer effective at stopping bots which is why you are allowed to dismiss them nowadays.
---
Fortunately you can now listen to creepy monster stories on Audible while playing!

Just use the URL extension /MTXScape

hey, in their defense, they replaced Squeal of Fortune with Alice. Which is definitely not the same thing. Alice has boobs.
---
My favourite so far
---
K thanks for the clarification. Didn't think it was all about a fear that JAGEX manipulates the result at a crucial time and not the fact that people follow a herd.
---
Mtx stands for micro transactions which are one of the things credited with ruining rs3. Its basically pay to win system where real money will get you bonuses in game.
---
I am, finally after losing my accounts to countless double exp ads I can now safely play at the weekends with this long awaited boost. I am excited.
---
as great as these ideas are, the blog post did specifically mention a desire to attract more players, not simply make more money. sponsored esports probably wouldn't attract as many NEW players as the twitch prime promotion did. just speculation ofc
---
not since they made 366 a 1500 world, we need all people to riot
---
Yeah, then all the bots will take their place.
---
Dude if you played back in the day you might really enjoy playing as an ironman. Oh and for sure get members, the game is amazing.
---
Its pretty easy to make money with it eventually. A pain early but useful as all hell. You can also use wines for training mage/range to lower cost. They are mass produced so they are only 3 or 4 gp ea but heal 11. They do however lower melee stats. I've helped a fair few switch to osrs in the past.
---
we've been fighting since 2010

So fucking accurate

bonds were bundled with free to play.

my banks gone empty im wondering why

For a single comment? Nope
---
I can definitely agree that WoW is more engaging than RS, but I've found its combat flow is often very repetitive and mind numbing for the levelling experience. Not as much as RS for sure, but just enough to me that it's not an engaging combat game while also not being a Zen grindy game. Ive definitely enjoyed it though, so don't take that as a criticism.
---
Personally the two skills you listed as your fun engaged skills are some of the skills I like because they're such repetitive patterns that it relaxes me and I can enjoy a show or YouTube videos at the same time. I often find myself catching up on podcasts or youtubers while playing rs and I think that's a serious plus side to the grind design of the game. It's engaging enough that it's not literally a "click the same spot a million times" kinda grind but also easy enough that if you want to "afk" you can.
---
Wows failure there, especially in classic, is that the "afk" side of the grind can often result in you being overwhelmed by simple trash mobs because you didn't strictly follow your classes rotation etc. So it's more demanding and engaging in that regards, while at the same time essentially being a "rinse and repeat" rotational combat that to me isn't engaging *enough* to be enjoyable.
---
It's this weird middle ground that I actually found later expansions solved a bit by simply making your class much stronger against trash mobs, and littering in elites or congested areas to add that difficulty elsewhere. Classic you have to take like 60% of the mobs seriously or they'll woop your ass until you're much deeper into the game.
---
In 2 years we'll finally be able to level runecraft
---
I need this
---
Which is funny because a large amount of loot is untradeable, versus that idea being comparable to ironman mode in osrs.
---
That said, the games are so wildly different. Their engines, quest and leveling systems, raid lockouts, etc all make them hard to compare. I will say, however, that I trust Blizzard less than Jagex. Current WoW is Blizzard's RS3, except Bliz,ard communicates with and listens to the playerbase *less* than Jagex, and Blizzard is on hard times by their standards atm.
---
Classic WoW could easily be ruined after the standard release cycle, but only time will tell.
---
What the commenter above likely means is that youtubers get to pick the type of ad,as in:"Unskipable,skipable,a bar at the bottom,a square outside of the video next to the recommended videos"

Nike told me I need to spend at least 500$ for the full set, and that’s exactly what I did :)

Aside from the cudgel, the prices of drops should stay the same
---
I liked his Stake it til you make it series until he started trying to make it so much safer for him to not lose the gold he made
---
Just solo it for more drops, requires druidic ritual which means you need a cannon to get meat and that requires cash which you can easily get from agility pyramid after lvl 70, so you max take 8 dmg. Inv for agility pyramid : 1 coinstack, 3 cakes, 1 shanty pass and rest full waterskin.
---
You’ll be able to use most shortcuts after that, not to mention the extra wt bonus
---
You get 10-15% more drops
---
67-71 construction minimum which saves you a couple mill.
---
Green Drags will probably be the best for you. A couple slayer level will unlock some good alternatives
---
I had a player trade me the essence and dropped everything when I got the boost
---
Jagex is literally owned by a company who can tell them to do whatever they want lmao
---
It all boils down to the last paragraph
---
Lol okay this ones accurate. Finding a quality meme thats actually funny right now on this sub is a fuckin needle in the haystack.
---
I reaaaaally want to imbue my slayer helm but I suck at nmz. What bosses should I have unlocked for most efficient points? And are my stats too weak? On hard mode I take a long time to kill bosses. Currently 71 att/str, 70 def, 73 range/mage. I’ve done desert treasure, monkey madness, haven’t quite finished rfd... it’s just taking so long to get points

I want 4

So basically RSPS in a nutshell.

This, I never played classic WoW, just from TBC onwards but even then the levelling felt like a big part of the game, whereas now, or at least the last time I played during Warlords of Draenor with all the heirlooms and heirloom mount and BGs giving exp with dungeon finder being a thing, level 1-100 took like a month or 2 and that was at a casual pace.
---
exactly!
---
poh are kind of useless until you chuck a good amount of money into them, money which noobs certainly do not have

are you seriously comparing jagex and dictatorships? lmao

This will probably get released when Jagex does a partnership with Hot Topic.

So youre saying that its better for a dev to literally throw their career away than to listen to what their boss tells them to do? youre so delusional if you believe that, 100% you dont give those kinds of fucks for your job if you happen to have one.

Interesting, I hadn't heard that. This is what is said in the [dev blog](https://imgur.com/a/QbEg1Ep):
---
&gt; A new spider boss offers a more fitting and engaging way of acquiring this resource, at a lower average rate than one gets from the Tower of Life.
---
I'm not sure what they said on the dev stream but this was the final rollout blog so I imagine this is kosher? Some high-level players have been saying that the drop rate on the sac is uncommon too, so I'm imagining something like 1/64 or 1/128. Tower of Life for 100 eggs will definitely be faster than 64 or 128 Sarachnis kills (on average) I think.
---
Plot twist: they log you into RS3.
---
Nobody tosses an iron man!
---
Damn I haven’t really been updated on this new boss? I have a lower level iron man that I’m grinding on (Lvl 80) so I’m not really connected to all the talk about this boss.

I’m assuming it’s newer ?

You're right man I want add anything.. I'll simply state facts

Jagex is offering cosmetics that you can get by paying real world money to their partners. Aka MTX.

I always click log out, was spamming it for my 10 second combat timer to go away

This whole shift click to drop is new to me. Gonna start the fly fishing grind on a new account - when is the best time to drop fish? Does doing it while fishing cause any interruptions to catching fish?

I agree but only after buying the sraracha cosmetic.
---
Every year since osrs came out, the game has grown.  Jagex profited over 90m last year...
---
You clearly have no fucking clue what you're talking about, that's why you're downvoted.

Yeah this sub was highly against the past poll for easyscape questing and they all got 70-74%  yes.
---
Well I'm out of ideas then
---
Thanks, the more I wear it the more it grows on me lol
---
Wow, weird. Maybe the unplantable tiles are the tiles that get acid on them
---
problem is that people really think this is what jagex meant with the blog, stupid people
---
Cmon guys we are just tryna do the floss and where cool skins
---
Yeah because it's killing the hype. So happy they made the smart move to end it in a week. Hype and withdrawels will be back just in time.
---
I think if you’re streaming and get killed by the same people repetitively it’s your own fault. If you keep going out in the wildy with loot and advertise it to the world you’re asking to get pked over and over again.

Lion king live action hentai takes my cake.

You replied to someone with Ironman flair. 81 herblore isn’t really mid game for Ironman.
---
Doing it does interrupt catching fish. Therefore it doesn't really matter much when you're dropping it. I personally drop everything once my inventory becomes full.
---
i saw him get 10k upvotes in 3-4hours, then a jmod commented saying the ban is derseved as he ragged and harrased players for days. they also said he had a history of really inappropriate language. he then proceed to flame the shit out of people on the thread saying he will make another account and never change his ways
---
I may sound a bit salty but if MTX is added imma quit, I don’t want to lose all progress again like I did with RS3 :|

imagine being banned in a game for what you said to a random person on discord

Gotcha thanks man

Umm..huh? There are PLENTY of free to play MMOs out there that are quality games and arent mtx driven to be able to do content. I dont even know what you're talking about. Even the MMOs a decade ago looked way better than rs3 lmao and not just ones that were monthly subscriptions. Which btw..rs3 is a monthly subscription game too? What are you talking about play the game entirely after paying once? Did they change something i dont know about in rs3 lmao? 
---
WoW isn't the only other MMO out there btw.. There's literally dozens of f2p mmos on steam that dump on rs3 in every aspect, and they aren't content locked by mtx or super long grinds without mtx. Not sure wtf youre talking about honestly.

I've tried most different mining methods, and the only one I've been able to handle for extended periods of time is MLM. Unfortunately, it's slow as shit, but it's significantly more afk than anything else (especially when you get to the point where you can use the upper level)

I tried BFA in prep for classic. Basically the best way to level is to stand in a city and spam LFG. If you’re a dps only class you quest a little until your que finishes.

1. The most popular party client (and legit one, approved by jagex) is open sourced. Meaning, anyone can see the code so nothing fishy is going on.
---
2. If you are using a shady client, u deserved to be banned.
---
3. Making the client vote the opposite of your choice is counter-productive. What if it's a vote that the developer himself wants passed? Is he gonna update the code every poll? Sounds like a lot of work!
---
Cosmetics attract me and I’ve been playing since 2005. The shit is tight. They will never put these house skins as a reward for achievement diaries ect. Just let it happen. I don’t see how this shit harms anybody at all. Just a bunch of sweaty nerd boys who don’t want cool features added to the game. Everyone is tripping and Reddit shouldn’t be the source of communication between j mods and players for shit like this. You can only have a post seen if it’s upvoted on here so the people who are against any of these people bitching about this shit, will never get their posts seen by players or mods because they all get downvoted. The whole system is fucked and the nerds who don’t want this are getting the Reddit karma while anyone who does want this shit is getting downvoted to oblivion. Why does it concern you if someone has orange skin or a cool house design. Let them. This shit sounds a lot like gay marriage or abortion debates. It does nothing to you if I stunt with a cool skin color and a house because I have twitch prime. Everyone will literally get the skin in a few months anyways. Why the fuck do you care if Jagex gets paid. It’s not like you are buying levels lmao fuck
---
do you guys have any tips to optimize the ggs fight? i'm starting the pet grind and i'd like to think i have the fight down, it's just little tiny things i have to learn now. i'm averaging at about 7-8 kills per trip at ~2 minutes a kill. 87/89/93 att/str/ranged using tent whip and bp. i can post pics of my setup i guess but i dont think that'd be necessary.
---
Let the man live. Who cares if he bought bonds or rwted it

use dclaw spec if you have, worked well for me

That does sound fairly appealing to me honestly, I don’t have a ton of patience in learning super complex technique that being said I was building a SOTD pure, so fairly one trick pony.

Well what person over 20 years old would have friendships with 15 year olds. Also the 17 year could also have been due to social psychology or something
---
I know starting over sucks but it's worth it. I wasted alot of time on rs3 even after osrs came out because it was hard for me to justify giving up over 1000 days ingame playtime, former top 500 overall and another maxed alt but there's no fun to be had on rs3 anymore. I'd rather play 07 as a noob than rs3 as a 16 year vet

When it's used to continue what you were muted for doing in game, I guess so. "LOL"
---
In all seriousness, though, the idea of Jagex taking things posted outside of Runescape into account when banning someone from Runescape at least warrants discussion. Really, you might've been better off starting with that instead of trying to tell people they might get banned for killing people just because their twitch streamers. It just isn't a good look when you misrepresent things to make a point and jump to a different argument to make the same point when you're called out on it. That said, we don't even know if that was part of his ban - [the Jagex reply to the post he's since deleted](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/c90471/just_got_permabanned_for_no_reason_serious/ess8g5u/) only really mentions continued harassment. Could be he took it beyond the wilderness and was just flat-out following people around finding ways to be a pain in the neck. Sure, he might say that totally wasn't the case, but given he's the sort of attention whore who tries to troll people with racist crap, claims of being some sort of ultra badass hacker who has ties to deep web assassins, and chases fame by shoving himself into various streams, I don't think his hypothetical word is worth much.

They made a promise that they intend to keep just like DMM being on separate servers and the ironman game mode being a side thing not to receive any catering. And let's not forget about how $11 wasn't enough and theyt had to hold F2P hostage with bonds back then.

You'd 1 hit everything and never take damage.

Ah thank you I've found it!

You don’t have to be friends with them. I’ve just noticed that people are generally rude towards the younger people
---
While I agree with you, I didn’t play RS much when I was younger and recently noticing the mobile release brought me into the game. Though I’m PC gamer so a lot of my time is now spent on the PC version when I play but mobile is so nice for just doing stuff when I can’t afford a lot of attention to the game.

You people should inform yourselves as to how bonds work before attempting to defend them.
---
And they all hit 30
---
Mmk was the one pushing for mtx behind the scenes tho??
---
I assumed you were meaning the deep wildy spot, not the goblin village one where the spawn is LITERALLY ONCE EVERY 30 SECONDS.  But feel free to explain to me how you'll get 23 wines from there in 2 minutes.  For someone who started with that outrageous statement you're talking mad shit about being informed.
---
Regardless, it should be locked behind something that is a little more rewarding like "do x number of morytania quests"
---
Rings, gloves, shield, and weapon slot all empty?  Not sure what to tell you, try logging
---
&gt; How well does classic WoW compare to RS.
---
It doesn't. I just tried WoW recently and it's one of the worst MMOs I've ever played. I was repeatedly shocked with how bad nearly every aspect of the game was. Also WoW Classic looks identical to the current WoW, because it looks like they haven't updated their game for 15 years. Current WoW doesn't even come near OSRS, the game is a joke.
---
i don't get why all the maxes are camping it, its shit money per hour compared to other things they could be doing at their level,  the pet is just a shittier version of the venenatis pet and they can just buy the jar and weapon of the ge :/
---
“P2W” MTX already exists in the form of bonds
---
implying that WoW classic has no shared market with OSRS is absurd
---
Hmm.... 1 slayer enemies in a midgame dungeon, or 80 slayer enemies.  I don't see a difference /s
---
Funny bit of it is its true, ive seen them download the client to do just this.
---
Option #🇮🇱
---
That's... literally how MMOs work when they work correctly.
---
If this was raids 3 that was released without intances, you'd be bawling bloody murder.
---
I'll explain it to you, and it's also why your first comment reply was that. Zulrah botters will often start a main account and prep it like normal, then start botting on a proxy and emulate an account getting stolen. That way down the road they can claim it was taken by someone since the proxy would be a different location, and possibly get their account back even though it wasn't stolen. 
---
Someone that was botting and scared their account may still be in hot water could post something like this to further clean the accounts name for future use/sale/etc 
---
again, this initially was just trolling/joking around but it is something that happens just like explained.
---
They got a cape?!
---
Duriel did nothing wrong.
---
The "J"-mods secretly control all of runescape.
---
Little known fact the dye that they use to color black graceful is actually pressed during the weaving process when they mix in a thin paste made from a sultry blend of ignorance, entropy, and an empty black space where their soul should be.
---
O man at first i was opposed to mtx but now that i see it in osrs style graphics... im sold
---
a lot of credit to the osrs community for being vehemently against this, i play rs3 almost exclusively and that community has absolutely no fight in them to oppose the ridiculous MTX in the game (probably because its proven pointless and more importantly the fighters all left for this game lol)
---
Original dragon ball z was slow as hell, that's where all the "next week on dragon ball z" memes come from
---
Check out the dragon ball z kai update that smooths it out a bit. And although I wasn't a fan of dragon ball super initially (dropped it 20 episodes in) it really comes into its own when the character in this post makes a return
---
no, getting crashed by someone should be a bannable offense
---
Makes sense. I dont think the OC was joking, however.
---
You're right to an extent, someone who buys bonds will always have an advantage over the people who pay with GP. Suggesting OSRS is pay to win because of that is misguided IMO because having a lot of gold isn't the end-game. (you didn't say that but I'm just making a point)
---
Hypothetically, if Jagex were to give me the choice to keep bonds in the game or to remove them due to their similarity to MTX, I would obviously keep them. I don't have to pay a cent of real life cash and I've been a member for over a year, it's an option we never had as kids.
---
Breezewood homies stand up
---
well, regardless if he was or wasn't, now you're that much the wiser!
---
I go through a bottle every 1-3 weeks depending on how often I eat at home. It's pretty messed up that every bite of a sandwich I'll just douse at this point.
---
Use pouches to fill with more essence, bring a couple stews and the spices. Make one stew, fill the rest of the inventory with essence and pouches. Drop the amount of essence on the ground that matches each inventory slot that is not essence. Once you get the correct boost, drop the bowl empty a pouch again, drop the pouches and pick up the runes you had on the ground for a full inventory.
---
You should try doing Vorkath before you give advice.
---
sure. it won't take that long.
---
I dont care about votes tbh just another way of saying youre a sore loser.
---
I did dragon slayer. Same thing really. Just use antifire potions
---
Isn't kicking monks in the dick better? Or is booting seagulls the new meta
---
I'd buy it if I could leap into battle and do a special attack with a max hit of 100,000.
---
Rushing has never been so easy.
---
I voted yes cuz fuck the reddit circlejerk
---
Incoming RuneLite ez vorkath plug-in
---
Fair enough good argument I suppose. Are you suggesting max combat in this game isn't just an afk grind at a relatively quick pace?
---
I could Max combat an RS account before 1-60 in WOW classic... *While playing wow at the same time*
---
Exactly.
---
It’s not that serious
---
Nice
---
So what is MTX, sorry i havent been able to keep up between work and school
---
My best moment was a b2b unsired ;)
---
You're gonna be so salty when bonus xp comes out
---
You can always read some posts to find out
---
Why bring up karma in the first place then, when you know I don't give a shit about it? Logic just ain't your strong suit is it?
---
They’re not. Reddit is just full of assholes that stretch the truth for the sake of funny memes on reddit
---
Out of pity I took it back. Just don't care or read into it lol you made a buzzkill comment so you deserved to go down was all
---
Fucking bunch of noobs is what they are. I would hate for the game (that was recreated for this exact reason) get re-ruined
---
Nice username / shtick

I don't even play this game I was meming. Idek what a zulrah is.
---
Allow me to introduce: https://i.imgur.com/DeBdmEm.png
---
Cool motive, still the real start of the slippery slope of MTX.
---
I personally don't care either way.  I like bonds.  But that doesn't mean that they aren't the start of the problem.  I also like more cosmetics in the game.  I like a lot of things.  But it's important to recognize where the line already is.
---
What purpose do you need to do that quest on a lvl 3 serve for?
---
My wife asks if the game has a rocket launcher or not... it’s a deal breaker for her. 
---
Event rpg wasn’t close enough for her... but she did enjoy shooting sheep
---
dog it's a joke lol
---
Nice fat Activision sticker there too lmao
---
So cool
---
You can take your downvote and L with you friend.
---
I really hope we can find Slayer Papa tbh
---
I stand corrected. Thanks for that.
---
Oh man Gee in Yoga Pants tho. That’s probly why they avoid it. Awkward Work Boners
---
At least there are private servers.  ;)
---
You are dumb as a rock
---
where??? got a link ?
---
real brothers protect their brothers
---
No, run these fucking clowns through the ringer. If you can’t handle the heat get out of the MTX kitchen.
---
The Jmod said he was continually harassing the same person for multiple days. 
---
That's been against the rules for years. The wilderness has nothing to do with it. He was intentionally following someone around. Stop ignoring that.
---
Micro transactions, example cosmetics for in game character or even Pay to win stuff
---
whats left on it?
---
Honestly, there is too much campaigning against it at this point. This poll has basically become like mobilization for war in terms of voting. 
---
If it passes it is way too obvious that Jagex rigged the results. 
---
However, this isn't the last time we will hear about MTXs being potentially added to OSRS.
---
Not everyone wants to risk literally everything in case of death
---
WHY ARE YOU LOSERS SO UPSET ABOUT COSMETICS THAT LITERALLY DO NOTHING
---
because your post to post +- tells a lot about a person, not the big number on the side, and all I saw was you shit posting and trying to start shit left and right, sorry your big brain logic was having trouble deducing that.
---
Lmfao the fucking crabs
---
That sounds like some Chinese mobile game shit.
---
&gt; free to play MMOs out there that are quality games and arent mtx driven
---
so what are they driven by then? MMO as a genre has a much bigger infrastructure upkeep cost, and I doubt someone would do it for free from good will
---
It literally hasn't though. Group instances exist.  Instances exist.  Instances paralell to non instances exist.  What.
---
damn you want someone to punch you in the dick? Hey, if it's your thing..
---
But then people pitched a hissy fit about catering to ironmen, so here we are. Good job guys.
---
Jagex ruining RS two times in a row?  Haha woo..
---
*sad gamer noises*
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
You are dumb as a fucking rock my friend

Sunk cost fallacy fam

Imagine if we got to the point of RS3 MTXs where it is basically shoved down their throat on login.

You're not alone man if they fuck up I'm ready to quit once and for all.

I found Waldo in there

Thanks for confirming your further lack of information.  Turbohopping means you'll just be outcompeted by people and bots with the same idea, that is until you rapidly hit the hop limit and get booted.

Support venezuelans brother they need our help

It's called a downvote, brainlet.
---
EA being thieving LMAO

Its not really about the time-gated cosmetics (for some people it is).
---
If they get away with partnerships, what comes next is the problem.
---
Wing capes would be so sick 😭🔥🔥
---
Hope you enjoy your body dysmorphia must be a blast
---
Duh its against the rules to pvp in a pvp area if the pkiee is a streamer, smh old news
---
What's your kc? Cause I disagree on both of your statements, they suck ass and are easy as shit.
---
When the polls are not hidden, any organized atrempt to statistically detect fraud would bust them in a few days time. Even when the polls are hidden, if we see the final result, there's plenty of methods for determining false results. Would require repolling on reddit though.
---
Not an argument
---
You're just assuming they were trying to be deceitful, when they could very well just have not realized that. Even originally there was a header above the questions that explained they were for partnerships.
---
Reminds me more of a Corpser
---
We didn't know that until it was leaked.
---
At the least, completion of priest in peril.
---
Or $11,690,072 for a ring that doesn't one shot, but has 100% recoil on it. Only 200 charges tho.
---
In processes as of July 2nd, which is why I doubt Jagex would just go along and start pushing extreme marketing changes like MTX while the state of their ownership is pending. This situation still gives us a nice show to watch though.
---
Many thanks, you have a very pretty game
---
Its a completely different game, but Classic WoW in particular will make you feel really good. There was something known as "the WoW feeling". Idk how to really describe it. When I played on a Classic private server a couple years ago, I experienced the exact same feeling. The game itself is just a perfect accident. The devs barely knew what they were doing when they made the game, but they made pure gold.
---
If mmorpg's are something you are interested in, Classic WoW is a must play. Even if you just want to level up to 60 and log off forever, it will still be an amazing experience.
---
That’s every company though, not just sp00ky China
---
An old friend of mine recently asked me how Runescape is doing and if free trade and wilderness is still removed. 
---
I told him we got everything back to how it was, but now they are releasing microtransactions into the game. 
---
He was deeply saddened by the news.
---
Yes
---
I know its ok, I hope you get laid someday.
---
Only boss I can do is Hespori.......
---
Pretty ironic to admit that in a post complaining about jagex trying to make more money, lmao
---
Top tier kek
---
Okay, but if you don't already have that service, which is the case for a lot of people otherwise they wouldn't even bother doing it, it boils down to time gated MTX, pretty clean and clear.
---
Trusting Blizzard less than Jagex is just dumb imo. Jagex has failed with every single game they've ever tried to launch besides runescape. Blizzard has a large portfolio of successful games. Yeah lately they've been doing more money grabbing shit, but that's just about every company nowadays.
---
His chatlog alone was ban worthy, he decided to keep harrasing people via discord after he got muted permanently and the ragging of a streamer was the cherry on top.
---
whats the precedent here? if you are going to be a complete asshole that break the rules dont complain when they are enforced and get you banned.
---
About the streamer favouritism it have been a thing from the begining and with good reason. They are the ones who expose the game and represent jagex. Imagine what a new player would think if they saw those messages and that guy being a total dick for the duration of the stream. What kind of person would like to play the game after seeing that?
---
Didn’t hide the Nike level YIKES thanks for the bank dumbfuck
---
Stop making good branded content damn it, I wanna flex on noobs at the GE in my LV cape
---
No, no, NO, NOOOOOOOOOO
---
I'd lock it behind the "Finale Quest" of each region.
---
Someone on reddit has made a Lego barrows set with a 3d printer. Can't remember the name it was tzharr something. Nows your time to shine!(would pay good money for a set btw)
---
The memes on 2007scape are above any other memes I've seen.
---
Was going to give gold, but it appears you prefer to stand alone.
---
Ngl, I dig the wings
---
Why not just buy bonds? 
---
26 bonds (at 4m per bond) for a whole year = 104m.
---
You can make that in a few days at TOB lol being unlucky with drops.
---
It would be super tricky to implement anything into Classic WoW. They can't add any mounts because of how valuable they are. They can't add transmog items since there is no transmog. They can't add anything that gives a player a competitive edge.
---
Basically the only thing they could add are pets, but pets in Classic are pretty much just a wasted bag/bank slot.
---
More like Jagoffs
---
At least someone who got bored at vork did something awesome, this is hilarious lol 
---
I got bored and vork and tried a full f2p setup aside from anti pots. What I learned:
---
1. Rune scimmy woox walking always hits 0s
---
2. You lose money
---
Black arc ain't that bad. It could be Buu.
---
Why the fuck does it have wings
---
I created a new account to vote no just because of your comment.
---
Used to? Still do
---
Just because you'll get it at an unspecified time later doesn't make it any less of a microtransaction. You can argue the morality of it, that's perfectly acceptable, and likely you won't have that much of an opinion of it if you take Jagex's word seriously. Likey we could take these promotions at face value, that being they're harmless. But Jagex is, and has been a flawed company in terms of integrity. I prefer the line drawn in the sand and not crossed whatsoever personally.
---
i think you can move that interface with runelite's alt drag components thing, maybe you moved it accidentally or it just bugged out
---
&gt; no one complained about that for example.
---
Is your memory really that short? Tons of people complained about the Twitch Prime thing. Tons of people are still complaining about it.
---
I think I'll give wow a try or just go back to league when they release mtx
---
Haha I agreed with everything you said besides the voting part, so that’s what I voiced my opinion on because it differed from yours. As I said before, it’s the player’s responsibility to educate themselves before they vote on an update. Do you just go to the poll booths on election years and decide who you will vote for on the spot without doing any research? That would be irresponsible as your vote could impact a large population. The same is the case in the poll booths in osrs, though not nearly as important or impactful.
---
Gamers unironically need to rise up
---
Gower hasn't been apart of jagex since 2011, nor was he the CEO
---
Kinda starting to feel the same tbh :/
---
Game releases have really dropped of to nearly nothing noteworthy.
---
Bring a rune pouch w essence. What I did was bring the biggest pouch full w essence, a super rest an already made stew plus enough for 3 more stews dropped it all on the ground dropped some essence drank stew picked up essence and if I got the level I hit the alter
---
i feel for ya
---
I can't believe you think doing blackbody is at all appropriate.
---
Y'all giving Jamflex too many ideas ffs
---
It's funny they all cry MTX but there's absolutely no value to any of these things, it's purely cosmetic that will even so be released soon after for all, and it's a harmless promotion to get new players to the game. It's in no way a sign that they'll look to do actual MTX in the future either since it's irrelevant to what this is.
---
Runescape is not a dating website
---
Doing it wrong god damn. Using the new years special I paid a years membership in bonds for only 62m
---
I meant it a little more lighthearted but yes I agree!
---
And why would i try to date on runescape when there is something called real life
---
&gt; Bonds are MTX
---
Yes they are
---
&gt; worse than cosmetics 
---
Not even close.  Bonds good.  Cosmetics bad.
---
&gt; you literally defend it as a "necessary evil" even though it didn't stop botting or RWTing
---
Nothing is going to stop botting, and I don't think RWT from player to player is a bad thing necessarily.
---
Lmao. It's like when you bought a brand new game but your big bro grabs the controller and plays all night instead while you sit and watch
---
Get a raw shark, as a kid I always wanted the fishing level to catch a shark.
---
you should ask this in /r/uniqueironmen i think youll get more attention
---
maybe jagex is polling mtx because they know this place makes some pretty solid memes and needs fuel to burn
---
They’ve been fuckin off with their security for
---
Quite some time. From a customer perspective I don’t really feel all that protected as opppsed to a game like WoW. Yet the prices are similar when paying for these products. Also there’s a lack of live customer support or even 24/7 but it’s a global game with servers in every time zone. As well as if you get hacked for items it’s just a “lol sucks for you” from jagex as opposed to the other 90% big brand MMOs who actually help you. This game tho? 2k+ hours in the game and if you lose your stuff they just kinda five ya the bird.
---
I'm ok with the emotes cause I miss them but everything else I dislike
---
Oof, I'm so hurt.
---
Someone's calling me a virgin on the osrs subreddit because I support human rights.
---
I was gonna ask you the same thing honestly. 
---
Jagex making record profits, has membership with a bunch of content, do they really need to have cosmetics? It leads to eventual greed and adding trash like exp buying happened to rs3 so why not osrs
---
hit him with flowers then recoil, the flowers have -100 attack bonus so u should hit 0
---
Classic WoW.
---
holy shit it's not just me?? It wasn't Slugma for me it was a teddybear but yeah!
---
Did you like earning your upgrades? Then you'll LOVE buying them!
---
Don't want to buy them? Don't worry, they'll be available soon to literally everyone for no in-game cost at all!
---
yes!! me too!
---
can a jmod seriously come help. i want this cursed bond gone
---
seen this one a few times, are people not aware that WoWs classic will come with MTX right out of the box?
---
I dun get it.
---
As much as I would like them to directly address more things on front page posts, Jagex has already given their reply to MTX/Partnerships on the QA weekly. I wouldn't imagine that they would go back and respond to all of the threads on the same topic in favor of answering the same question to something they've answered stream.
---
wtf are you on about?
---
Missed opportunity
---
Bet a bond you won't hit 1500 total.
---
Hell yes!
---
Seems like a lot of it was about the community.
---
Surely that won't be the same 15 years on?
---
&gt;Being BM in game via chat doesn’t make a case to perma ban him.
---
Why would you even say that then? Nobody said that's why he was permabanned. If you were agreeing you wouldn't try to argue that the ban wasn't justified.
---
Sorry you don't know what the words you're typing mean?
---
post
---
Now you can start playing the game
---
Yes and until the sale has been finalized both new and old owner aren't able to do anything. Selling a company doesn't take a couple of hours you know.
---
About time we got breds in osrs
---
 Blows my mind how many sheep have already started munching down this clearly deceptive rhetoric Jagex is feeding them. “Omg swamp man house?!! Yasssss” “dude it’s not mtx! They clearly said it’s not mtx so it’s not!”
---
What's the easiest way to obtain fossils for the museum for kudos? I have read that chopping sulliuscep mushrooms is a good source but as I am only 60 combat I do not know if I can survive running around the swamp with the tar monsters. I am working on 153 kudos for the Varrock Hard Diary and wanted to do it quicker than finishing off the last few quests.
---
Is power mining iron the quickest way to level mining? I'm currently 50 mining and need 61 for Lunar Diplomacy.
---
Came here to say this hahaha. Glad I wasn't alone
---
Gz, working on 99 str right now. It will be my first 99 in any RuneScape ever
---
Wish gowers would just buy jagex again and keep it great.
---
(please excuse my shitty camera work/editing)
---
Ok so this took me about a week to put together, I (F24) play OSRS occasionally but I’m definitely still a noob, but my bf (M23) is damn near maxed. SO, I set up stops/clues/gifts with correlating skills icons (Ex: Attack = a new knife, Fishing = a new fish shaped bottle opener) Each stop had a small gift with the main one being the Reward Casket (hockey tickets) I set these up all over our apartment, outside, in our mailbox and the last and final step being the trunk of my car, inside was the Casket w/ the hockey tickets, and my ~conveniently~ placed proposal. I had fun putting it all together and he was definitely stoked.
---
Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, just like us.

Konar gives good assignments and also has the chance to drop keys on her assignments giving you potentially more money.  I’ve gotten like 1 mil from 11 keys so far

I’d love to see yours

I'll take the Nike black graceful thanks g
---
Everyone is freaking about the no splashing but not MTX Vote no nerds
---
Some people actually do believe in integrity over money, just because you would sell your beliefs to highest bidder doesn't mean others would as well.
---
Do you guys use runlite or osbuddy ?
---
I dont particularly care if people think I'm stupid for being poorer than the average player. It's not permanent and I play for me not them Haha.

Forthos Dungeon - https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Forthos_Dungeon
---
Bunch of babys, LETS GO MTX UPDATE. Excited for new things
---
No it won’t lol if osrs fails then the player base is done along with jagex. What are you even saying
---
I see, that's fairly interesting to know for RS's history. WoW has a similar "recruit a friend" option which gives you exclusive mounts and exp boosts. I wouldn't be surprised if they got the idea from that.
---
Floating e?
---
Hold on, contest winners and their prizes is still a problem??
---
Come on, Jagex
---
Watch abridged. Just started and it’s way better than the og
---
Real gangsters complain about multiple magic attacks
---
First they came for the player owned houses, and I did not speak out—
---
because I have 30 construction.
---
Then they came for the fashionscape, and I did not speak out—
---
because I wear graceful everywhere.
---
Then they came for me— and there was no one left to speak for me.
---
A game truely dictated by the minority!
---
Calm down guys. It is never going to pass. When I logged in after the update there was a friendly neighbourhood ironman telling me to vote no.
---
Use runelite, but do not get runelite plus!
---
New meme template plz

So only people who remember a time when rune equipment was BiS?
---
I plan on cancelling my citizenship for america this upcoming election too for the same purpose, that'll show them!

But Goku was in every episode of Super

2001scape plz

Except all this shit happened under them.
---
Done. Couldn’t specify MTX so I just said unhappy with recent update.
---
Not real advantage ? I am a rs3 player just finally jumping into osrs
---
Because we had already told them not to take it away
---
I know mole had it's respawn time shortened at one point.  Possibly kbd as well.  I think they will look at it again a couple weeks from now and see what the meta is
---
Your wife should look up Woox to learn how to wear those headphones.
---
NO i wasn't, jesus you do NOT understand whats happening.
---
I WAS NOT HACKED. I cannot get into email because email recovery once you have 2FA REQUIRES the code, your phone number is NOT enough to recover the email. So I'm locked out of email (which makes it hard to get the authenticator turned off on the osrs account), so once my osrs requests auth code, I cannot play anymore. 
---
Nothing was hacked, I REALLY would like you to explain what I said that may have made you believe I was hacked? Like there's nothing to confusing here:
---
Google authenticator for osrs + email on phone.
---
break phone, cannot access to SHUT OFF authenticator. 
---
New phone, same phone number. 
---
Cannot access email. 
---
Can access game, support, I know my bank pin, I bought the 3 month summer promotion a month ago, etc, but ONCE MY AUTH CODE is requested again, I cannot play every again unless jagex helps paying customers.
---
Fletching,  like,  the skill,  is a dialy??  Wtf??
---
&gt;Hey Jagex, I'm playing on my mobile, dare me to drive?
---
I'm fucking dead
---
Use rl, download it from the Twitter so you don't get a fake one.
---
Unless the higher-ups demand it. Being a dev is different than being the owner.
---
thats Bwana graceful to you
---
Juiy
---
The reason why I wanted to make money was because I wanted to get rune and all I have is the rune sword while rocking iron/steel armor. Lol.
---
On mobile it isn't there. Not sure if it was before, but it isn't there now. 
---
Reeeeee
---
When did I say that I want a free bond? Playing f2p for so long was a personal challenge for me to earn everything in game by myself.
---
This will be entry level raid gear
---
Nah, a med is an account with 60/75 att, 70/75 def, 77 pray, 99 str, range, hp. It's called a maxed med
---
i bet you only take it for pron ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Meet Makcrag, my Primark locked ultimate ironman. After recently maxing my ultimate ironman I decided to up the ante, to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking. No trading. But this time I can't leave Primark, all leading up to eventually taking on one of runescapes biggest challenges... Owning a piece of designer clothing.
---
no it isn’t
---
Almost. First letter is different
---
Yes officer, this post right here.

7 days ago jagex was sold to platinum fortune LP

Dude that's not funny.

Hahahaha osrs is the best PvP game wow is dead game

You definitely can get shadow banned for specific subs.

Can non members vote and is the poll still going? Havent been a member in a while but I'd get on to vote no
---
Phase 4 worries me man
---
What new content is this a reference to?

I completely forgot until I saw someone else's comment but even before this the membership store cards offered cosmetics. Remember the flaming skulls and katana? I remember really wanting those but had no money myself to buy the cards thankfully. :D
---
The difference is that bots destroy the economy of the game and interfere with the average player (by taking away spots to train/make money) while bonds do not. Also bots give no advantage to non-bot users, while bonds do give advantage to people that don't buy bonds off of Jagex
---
And again, I think you miss the biggest point here: bonds do not GENERATE anything. The gp just switches posession. Completely different to bots.
---
Don’t forget the 2% cash back on everyday purchases but 5% on all runescape purchases. And the ability to redeem your cash back straight into membership/bonds/keys!
---
Welcome to the party! Better late than neven ;)
---
You pay membership, why should you pay extra for things that used to be in game
---
People are so biased against pkers lmao. It is pretty insane.
---
I never played wow, but I’m gunna give it a shot if this happens?
---
Interested in how you think of doing this? 
---
Perhaps a bot a world at each booth but even then you don’t know who’s just looking or missclicked or even voted. Seems the numbers could be skewed to easily
---
And?
---
Splashing curse
---
&gt; What happens when your mates decide to stop or if someone wants to join at a later date?
---
The "assumed" stance is that you have to lock in the group at a set point and then can't change it after that. Any other way breaks the integrity of a "group" ironman as you could just include other already made ironmen.
---
They havnt put it ingame just polled and people think if this is added it will be a slippery slope which leads to microtransactions
---
I would pay 20$ if they didn't add mtx... altough I never pay real money for a game lol, bonds are the way to go.
---
Nah
---
Content shouldn't be added that you can obtain without working for it. If this poll went through that means you can change your house style without needed to have worked on your construction while you need level 1,10, 20,25, 30,40 and 50 for the other styles that already exist in the game. As for the other cosmetic stuff, personally i don't care at all for cosmetic stuff or pets or whatever, it's all junk for me but i understand and respect that others think otherwise, i would generally have no objections to the skin colours and home teleportation styles but we don't want another RS3 that was bloated with meaningless cosmetic stuff (aura and so on) which eventually led to MTX, i don't trust Jagex, or rather i don't trust their owner, i voted no on all the poll questions.
---
i guess its probably intentional to limit the gp/hr
---
Opening and navigating menus doesn’t send input but right and left click does, so they can see you are blackjackig without right clicking to open the navigation menu.
---
Isn’t that shady as fuck
---
Free 50k loot os nice lool... rushers are little girls that do t risk and dont know how to pk
---
You still can. They're making it so you dont get any XP for casting a spell that you'll guaranteed to hit a zero in Lumbridge or areas close by.
---
Dibs on reposting this for whatever is gonna happen in August
---
We love you, even though we never make it seem like we do
---
In other words, some people still shill for millionaire companies
---
THE HOTTEST MERCH IN ALL OF GIELINOR 🔥🔥
---
Not for classic.
---
dope
---
I absolutely suggesting taking the blog with a grain of salt. Things change and companies demands change. But give in to a little MTX and it’ll eventually open the gate.
---
Not really. Since i played a game called perfect world international i was able to adapt to rs3 quickly.
---
mtx didnt interest me. always did my daily spins and didnt bother further with it. that way it never influenced my gameplay in any way.
---
to this day i really enjoy rs3 alongside with osrs. but after comping on rs3 it got kinda dull so i went to osrs to have the thrill of level ups again and a new grind...
---
Might aswell implement it now that OP did all the work.
---
If partnerships pass, then future content and items which effect game play can be locked behind a paywall without it being technically classified as "MTX". 
---
And even though you pay a subscription fee to Jagex, you still won't have access to these items.
---
Yes they are currently not big ticket items, and the previous "partnership" was obtainable from something with a "free trial" but in future i don't want to see expensive deals from companies to unlock something in OSRS that i can't unlock by playing the game and achieving it.
---
Eoc then mtx dealt the final blow
---
Lock it behind 16k temple treks.
---
It's called Ironman, it's made for single play.
---
Instancing the world like WoW has done, will only worsen the game
---
Classic WoW will have paid mounts, pets, MTX, gold selling (tokens) and paid level 60 boost as well soon. It's what Blizzard does. If you don't believe that, you **really** haven't been paying attention to how Blizzard makes their money.
---
/r/boringdystopia
---
Tell me what you find :)
---
No lol pets r meant to be rare
---
&gt; but I have absolutely no incentive to lie
---
Except for getting your rs account back, the entire point of this post?
---
Takes one look at the title
---
"HE BUT A BOY, GUYS. SPARE HIM!"
---
*capitalist overlords
---
Ooh got it, thanks. I've never used it myself, nor do I see a lot of people use it so I didn't think about it :)
---
Death threath aint no joke
---
Don’t believe everything you read. We’ve been told this before.
---
It hurts me too lol. I'll probably work on getting 90 construction next, then start going for base 90s on everything else.
---
120 cb with 72 slayer... ouch
---
Yes but it completely ruins the money making for low levels when people with scythe comes and shreds the boss.
---
Do pvm -&gt; buy xp -&gt; get highscores.
---
MTX facilitates the 'buy xp' part of it.
---
This teen obviously has been watching too many TV series for his own good.  
---
I read some of these comments and genuinely doubt any of the people who say anything even remotely close to "I/shareholder/employee wouldn't fire the worker who uses an official media account to basically do extremely bad PR for the company" has worked a single day in their lives.   
---
That's not how adult world works people. You do shit, you get shat on, as simple as it gets, there is no SJW bs going in real world.  
---
There's contracts you're obliged to follow and many and most of them  have extra clauses which state that you cannot disclose company secrets (plans for MTX could and would be a huge secret all things considered) to the general public, or any public for that matter.
---
Ok but then dont complain the wilderness is dead.
---
Right okay
---
Makes me happy you got 8 of each item to make exactly 8 rings. 
---
Keep it going man!
---
I can't wait for x20 xp boosters. 99s for everyone!!! For the low low price of $69.99
---
EOC and MTX was salt in the wound.
---
It’s a stupid mechanic. Lots of ways to make money and have fun outside of the wilderness. Just let the wildy be empty.
---
Or you know just wait for the hype to calm down? The content has only just come out.
---
Thanks for the reply. 
---
I will have a look into the safe spots, but may just need to do the quests instead for kudos as sole safe spots are a pain to try and do properly on mobile!
---
I was hoping there would be a better method, but I will stick with power mining. It's not fun but at least its relatively fast, especially with the Varrock armour.
---
Fire
---
yeah did alot of afk nmz while studying
---
A maxed mid (usual term is maxed med) is a pvp build that is generally 60 attack 70-75 defence and 74-77 prayer (for piety/rigour/augury)  and 99 in all combat stats. They max around 106-109 combat
---
The girl that twerks on Alfie's stream has such an amazing ass
---
they said they love the person, not the game. we can love people who play rs3 but still think the game is a heap of shit.
---
I actually lmao'd when he thought he could threaten you with the fucking dark web hitmen. He about to get scammed 600k IRL.
---
They aren't actually polling partnerships though, they're polling what we want added through it. It's likely that they will understand we don't want partnerships if we say no to all the items, but they aren't actually asking us is we want it or not.
---
raids 1 isn't that hard, but i agree with you
---
was 2.9k 2's 2.4k 3's awarr in wotlk, 70+ binds or so, can't do inferno on this basic game lol.
---
Do you think that literally all of those people are only missing that pet? Why do you think they'll ignore every other bit of content that gives pets just for this specific pet?
---
It's fucking day 1 of the update dude. Wait a week for it to not be brand new content and then bitch.
---
&gt; Did you forget RS3's history? From them being adamant MTX was only for cosmetics to real items to actually buying exp.
---
Yeah, because we have EoC too right? This logic doesn't follow. This isn't just an opportunity to repeat the mistakes of the past, it's also a chance to fix them.
---
&gt; That's why it's not all of a sudden. MTX doesn't start with buying exp it starts with cosmetics then little by little expands.
---
Or, it gets polled, and all future MTX gets polled, and the community doesn't freak out over literal nothing.
---
&gt; What this subreddit is fighting for is not letting ANY kind of payment other than membership &amp; bonds. All other things should be earned in-game.
---
Why though? You should be fighting against bad MTX, not ALL MTX.
---
Not all MTX is bad.
---
You do know that it's possible for people to dislike things about a game they like, right?
---
You know I didn’t think about that, and that sounds about right. Nice.
---
Sorry, I couldn’t hear you over my farm of pets in my maxed POH.
---
Yea, I’d pay $30 for it
---
Yes, everyone is overreacting, but these are partnerships they’re trying to get, they’re not just stuffing in shitty MTX. PARTNERSHIPS with another company, like Twitch.
---
All I have to go on is what you said, which is that they should add a new room to the boss so that the rare drops will maintain value. Where am I wrong?
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
Figured there would be more to the story yesterday than just him 'rushing'
---
Obviously a justified ban which is the better option for every party involved, never understood why people like this care so much about their pixels and enjoyment out of targeted harassment, overall toxicity and racism
---
almost no one is saying they dont want mory house themes or anything, but why would you want it to come from a mtx promo instead of from actual gameplay?
---
&gt; only gets used for vr porn lmao, and even then its like twice a month because its just too much effort.
---
Really? I always imagined it must be amazing
---
Whose Walter?
---
uh, no. As someone who played in the pre GE era, that's one of the changes I wholeheartedly support. Not everyone wants to play an ironman, which is kind of what it was like. Nor was standing in W2 varock west spamming "Selling X" for hours on end an interesting experience.
---
Not everyone's concept of the game is defeating bosses. People have invested hundreds of hours for getting purely cosmetic pets for example...
---
Looks lonely.
---
It's principle, Look what happened to RS3. No fucking thankyou, I KNOW cosmetics wont pass and that makes me happy.
---
If they do It's completely rigged, Imagine removing poll results then saying "cosmetic MTX passed btw", We know that 75% of the playerbase arent voting yes, Can't wait for the results, Ty wangflex.
---
Hijacking top comment to call OP out for his bullshit.
---
&gt; Well if you believe they are such insignificant changes that "noone will notice" then why have the impulsive urge to poll them so quickly? Here's my guess: more money
---
Like, how can you even call Jagex out for this lmao? If they ARE such insignificant changes, then wouldn't it help the game if they brung in more money? They're a fucking business, of course they're gonna take the chance to grab extra cash, especially when you admit yourself that they're insignificant changes.
---
You're getting mad at them wanting to make money. If they want to make money and not ruin the integrity of this game, that's fine with me... Because that sounds exactly like what they're doing.
---
I'm done, if you don't want to try, why even argue?
---
Then YOU are disseminating misinformation by labeling it with YOUR opinion instead of what it actually is and letting others derive their own opinions from that. 
---
Worse imo.
---
"Jagex needs money to make the game yah?"
---
Which is what the monthly fee exists for...
---
Konar but IMO really not worth it. So many really awkward, terrible tasks with either low xp or gp, end up spending buckets of points on skips.
---
That said I did have a 3m, 9 key gargoyle task...
---
Then I got like 4 stronghold bloodveld tasks with 0 keys.
---
Kinda don’t recommend the trade off
---
Ultracompost pls
---
No trust me, this time their crystal balls are working!
---
You could get lucky chaotics
---
Lol sure just skirt the question. You’re hilarious bro, but if you’re done you’re done I’ll ttyl
---
You had me at the stackable bankstand
---
Imagine following 50 gaming subs AND LSF to get your fill of internet drama and then calling others neck beards....the lack of self awareness.
---
There is crossover yes but to say it will kill osrs is laughable. After the initial launch hype over Classic the player drop off will be huge when people realise just how 'hardcore' Classic was/is. Retail WoW's playerbase will take a big hit for sure I imagine, but we won't know the true outcome until about 6 months down the line.
---
He's also from my clan lolz. He said he'd remember us now that he's famous.
---
skill cape perks were (are) an awful update. the capes with stupid good perks, con,crafting etc should be nerfed rather than buffing any other capes. the only cape with anything close to a 'bad perk' is wc and maybe fm, but the fm perk is pretty useful in the max cape
---
that green mossy bow Rhok'delar and you're friend is a champ :D the quest start is a drop from the first raid it turns into one of the best quest chains that has been in the game maybe even the best.
---
Rookie numbers.
---
I’ll pay for a year once they release mtx
---
I'm sorry but no, it couldn't,
---
First one then the other.
---
EOC slashed the player base, but when many of us returned after legacy and evolution combat was implemented, I couldn’t stand the cosmetic spam, it’s extremely overwhelming
---
You don't want to discuss the issue you want to score "debate points". So I don't see any point in discussing it.
---
You have a right to be cautious because it’s not made by the RL devs, but it’s safe to use in that the devs seem to trustworthy and the code (which is all open-source) is clean. 
---
From what I’ve gathered from a podcast with one of the RL+ devs is that their vision is to make all underground paid plugins free, to stop monetisation for clients, while keeping the client truly customisable (which RL claims to be but decides to have boundaries).
---
You're willfully ignoring very specific parts of the story if you are actually going to say he "got banned for pking".
---
This guy repeatedly broke the rules. He was already past his "first strike".
---
He targeted specific players, and only those specific players, for multiple days. You will literally never do this unintentionally.
---
Whether or not he was pking had absolutely nothing to do with it.
---
I don't think so, Mod Ash made a post expressing that he was actually surprised by Matt Ks response. 
---
But I don't really know tbh.
---
Because (in this specific example), I get a new house theme, Jagex gets more money and as a result, everyone is happy.  
---
If other people get it a week or two sooner by paying for it, fine by me.
---
Ge turned a lot of skills into trivial buyable skills, but that's neither here nor there
---
By all means, if I'm spreading misinformation, then please feel free to correct me instead of just saying that I'm misinforming people.
---
The texture is off. I thought it was some kind of weird slime creature.
---
Awesome sub, thank.
---
500m rs3 which would equate to 90m osrs. It was a regular polypore stake, I was 17 back then.
---
I play rs3 everyday and love the game, I don't like mtx and wouldn't wish it upon osrs though. So yeah I'll log on to old school and vote no next time I'm on. 
---
Just because I play rs3 doesn't mean I like mtx. What a stupid comment.
---
It didn't slip under the radar. This is OSRS, MTX have been a big deal and known about for years thanks to RS3. People just don't mind bonds i guess, it is effectively free membership for many players.
---
Mmm no I’m disputing your claims, which you cried straw man, and then when I tried to clarify your argument you avoided the question. I’m happy to discuss but clearly you aren’t getting your points across very clearly
---
I’m not really sure I see why, con and crafting are basically the same as carrying either house or Camelot teleports, teleporting nearer to the bank is nice but I really don’t think after 100m+ and a lot of hours being like 10 tiles closer to a bank is game breaking.
---
Most every skill in the game serves little purpose, none really gain you gp anywhere close to what AFK combat can achieve, I personally would like some reward outside of a cape with little to no usage, but that’s just me
---
Oh my fucking god, just quit the game and find something else to sperg about already.
---
This would be a partnership done right!
---
That's fair, my response has been edited.
---
That's silly. By seeing people splashing in lumby i initially found out about splashing. When i splashed in f2p near ge (near hill giants on goblins) and some person started thinking that i was a bot or somehow killing the damned goblin.
---
Not to mention its going to break the consistency. You better have some mage in lumby tell that 'oh we got some ward over lumby', otherwise people will be confused why it doesn't work inside lumby. And no having it in changelog doesn't count, unless people follow it, and people who stop playing for a while certaintly won't.
---
If i had such bucket..
---
Some advice though, never use the two mentioned in this post
---
You’re hilarious. Enjoy your 4 upvotes.
---
Sure but if there was a character called cola or coke and it had something to do with their character like being a coke head then its not a big issue. 
---
Selling skins on the other hand is fucking disgusting.
---
Tri poloski set incoming
---
Try the [Crabclaw Caves](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crabclaw_Caves). You can can also unlock the music track there.
---
Tbf this sub begged for hidden poll results. I'm worried as well though
---
99% of statistics are made up. See where I’m coming from?
---
Oh I didn't even notice the + on runelite+, I thought the op was talking about regular runelite
---
Its called opinion u capitalist zombie
---
You're talking about the guy who literally told someone he's sending a killer to burn them with acid right?
---
Imagine being so elite you don’t want anyone else to do content
---
My family broke down in breezewood on a 12 hour road trip, 6 hours away from family. So it became and 18 hour trip (waited for family to come pick us up, then went to their house.)
---
&gt; Woosh
---
Which client?
---
what?
---
I wouldn't say all of us. I feel like people think everyone who played OSRS as a kid played WoW. I never touched the game. I've seen friends play, but I've never personally. I have no desire to leave RS for a game I've never played before, and I'm definitely not the only one. And at $15 a month, I don't think people are just going to drop their RS accounts they've been working on for years and switch over. I'm sure WoW will pull in people here and there, but I don't think anyones going to give up RS completely for WoW like everyone thinks.
---
Ye quick cover ur name or someone's gonna hack u for that red dhide
---
“Integrity updates” calling it now.
---
Not my fault that yo are poor and can't afford nice items to lose. Stop being poor you filthy fucking noobs.

You can use timeline runelite to highlight the hit box, and it makes it 10x easier to click.

Just have the scheme have the equivalent of a pet drop from treks

---
I came from the future to vote for the boys
---
No, I hear some rs3 players just like the combat system and the improved game mechanics (used for bosses and quests for example) and shit but don't like the mtx aspect of it
---
That sounds like something a keylogger client advertiser would say.
---
idk what this is. i just googled some pics of cheating clients.
---
Guildwars 2 does have a mtx shop that has items that benefit game play and aren't cosmetics.
---
I've never played lineage but I am quite confident that if I looked into it, it would have intrusive mtx or not be free.
---
The only game I can think of are some of the mobas (league of legends) but even those have loot boxes
---
I’m considering rwt. No idea how to even do it. Would only get like 100 quid but fuck it. Could buy half oz with that.
---
Jesus. This is perfectly dark and horrifying.
---
Lets all screenshot our No votes for karma
---
Haven’t voted on anything in MONTHS but did my part. You can too!!!
---
If you do boss tasks, Duradel blows Konar out of the water in terms of profit. Basically do demonic gorillas for your black demons task and Vork for your blue dragons task. If you still want more, you can do DKs for your daggonoth tasks, and Cerb for your hellhounds tasks when you unlock it. If that's not enough, you can do his lower gp/hr tasks as well like gargs, kurasks, and skeletal wyverns.
---
  
---
Konar is only good profit at 95 slayer when you can spam hydra tasks.
---
You're right. Ban graphical overlay plugins. Particularly the inferno one.
---
Aren't Zulrah / bossing plug ins a big no-no though? I'm pretty sure Jagex doesn't allow them to be used by 3rd party clients and that 99% of the community doesn't use them anyway
---
No need to use the whole client if it's open source. Just take the addon out and build it in to your own RL client after checking the code out to verify it.
---
Eyyyyy
---
7 years since you laughed? Have you been in a concentration camp or just getting 94 RC?
---
thing is, we're tryna prevent it from happening to begin with
---
It's certainly a ton more involved than Wii games, as the Wiimote could be thought of as a laser pointer with a gyro/accelerator. All you had to do to convince a game you were playing ball was to get the sensors flying around and the pointer moving, none of which take effort to fool the game.
---
What you will see if you watch videos of VR being played is that the tracking accuracy of your controllers is very, very fine by comparison. So fine that it was the first thing that blew my mind about VR, it wasn't a gimmick like the Wiimote was, it was real.
---
How games use that is usually case-by-case. There's the obvious differences like Pavlov's generous weapon-handling, the vague handwave you can do to pull a magazine out of the 'general' area of your pocket, and load it in the general area each magazine should go. It 100% suits the game, as a fast-paced CS-inspired shooter. On the other hand H3 expects pretty high accuracy in terms of slotting magazines properly onto the rails, hooks, belt, grabbing and pulling the bolt to the right distance, at the right angle and what have you. More or less, mimicking the real handling of a weapon as it would be in real life, you have to make the same movements.
---
Movement style is just as important, and another per-case kind of thing. A lot of games support multiple movement options ranging from teleportation, to classic analog-stick style movement, to having to make a convincing running motion with your arms to move. Obviously in a game like Minecraft you (could) but probably wouldn't want to wiggle your arms around 24/7 to walk across the vast space but in other places it would be more appropriate. You might want to swing your sword, like a sword, but maybe not have to row the oars to the boats.
---
Thankfully, customization and options are usually pretty expansive so it's often up to you how things work. It's way past the point of being a gimmick so I crave more good quality stuff, now that I have it. There just needs to be a bigger userbase to justify companies spending money to make games for the platform.
---
I think that's why you hear about headsets gathering dust, people get them, there's a honeymoon period but the content runs dry and it gets put down for a long time.
---
Depends on the rest of your equipment too. Use rune lite to get your personal xp/HR which will slightly increase as you level. Will be quicker to get d long or mm for d scim tho
---
Did not track that - that's pretty fucked up.
---
sounds about right for the osrs community
---
Longer than if you used a Dragon one.
---
Had rs3 main and osrs acc hacked (auth delay when??) and used my 3 accounts to all vote no before I quit for good. Good luck guys
---
I have maybe it was the everyone can do tob comment. I dunno u kinda seem like a stuck up ass who prolly votes no to every poll.
---
It'll be interesting to see whether people opt for the faster method or the boss method. I'd probably be more inclined to do a bossing method compared to tower of life. I heard someone mention that venenatis might be the best method as it drops 500 noted at approximately 1/43 rate.
---
Oh wow, no I didn't know that.
---
I guess it's a self-fulfilling cycle: users want to wait until there's more content but developers need the users &amp;c, &amp;c. I certainly look forward to VR really hitting the mainstream; maybe in 20 years time when we have infinity treadmills and full body haptic suits haha.
---
You're very talented, keep that art rolling in.
---
I'd been more then fine to vote yes on these things if you could somehow unlock them by playing the game, but this Partnership debacle is terrible and I really hope Jagex does not go further in this direction. I don't think I can stand Runescape breaking my heart a second time.
---
It’s out go vote no to every question
---
I wouldn't mind paying 10m for bonds. My point is osrs is becoming so greedy, which is what happened to rs3
---
you just needa find a game you like for it, Im a big car nerd so I play like an hour of Asetto Corsa every night (racing simulator) and it feels so real dude. I have a nice steering wheel and a Vive and its gotten almost 800 hours this year. I also drift irl and have dreams to drive an f1 car so it satisfies that lol
---
You can literally rn go and get the purple skin you do not have to pay for anything. If you’re that upset over an orange skin that I doubt the majority of everyone crying would even use you have bigger issues to deal with. And you do not play osrs for nastalgia the game is nothing like it used to be
---
You will passively get a lot of mage xp, while 99 is good you're fine leaving it
---
I sold mine once I played some of the best games for it.
---
Half life 2 and Elite:Dangerous were my favorites.
---
The same way they have been for the past 6 years?  Game's been growing just fine simply with the addition of good quality content, no corporate shilling or wallet sucking required.
---
Karma...
---
You and this series are part of the reason I got back into osrs
---
It really annoys me how much this subs plays into the whole thing though, when I saw the thread I assumed it would get a few hundred up votes then just die away, but it ended up getting 15k? I just don't understand why people love wasting jmods time tbh
---
Oh sorry, it’s basically a type of pking account.
---
I’m 70 defense, 75 attack, 99 range/mage/strength/HP, with 74 prayer. At 108 combat.
---
Technically I’m not completely maxed as I can get 77 prayer and Augarywithout a combat level. But as I don’t tribrid much I haven’t done that yet. I also don’t PVM much so I don’t find the need for it as well
---
It's game changing to have that magic skillcape perk. I've had the maxed spellbook altar in my house for over a year and have never used it because of my skillcape; it's just so good.
---
Sorry if i’m confusing things here but to my understanding the wilderness is a PVP area
---
If you broadcast yourself at a certain location in the wilderness wouldn’t that put a target on your back?
---
Oof, watch out guys he's a scary boi.
---
Glad to hear you found something that works. I just kept 70 attack and defense then rushed 90 str then after did 90 attack then 90 def then 90 range
---
okay but if you know theres a bot busting stream and you dress up as a bot and go do bot things... that's like natural selection or something
---
Someone make a backup for the client
---
There's a big difference between a company adding microtransactions into a game in order to squeeze money out of their players and general quality of life improvements offered by some 3rd party clients.
---
I agree that cheating clients shouldnt be allowed, but another player using a 3rd party client doesnt actually make your gameplay experience worse, whereas microtransactions usually lead to unhealthy mechanics that are used to attempt to force players to buy them.
---
What was his IGN I'll have your "Free T-Bow" I totally trust all strangers on the internet 😂
---
A lot of people (including me) are voting yes on the partnership polls. Reddit isn't the majority of the playerbase; don't get surprised if this actually passes.
---
It's definitely going to take a long time to get points with that list of quests done. You probably need RFD and Dream Mentor done to get points quickly. The Dream Mentor bosses, especially The Inadequacy give a lot of points and the RFD bosses are mandatory for getting close to the maximum points per boss. 
---
You can do some easy bosses and you'll get the points you need eventually, but it's way slower. With those important quest bosses unlocked you can probably pull close to a million points an hour. Just get those quests done and you'll be king of the NMZ in no time!
---
oh cool thanks, game wasn't alerting me of an available poll for some reason
---
The new episode that just came out
---
It’s because simple-minded players assume that the company wants to take their most profitable game and take the same route that ruined their OTHER game by implementing MTX weapons/armors/xp boosts WHICH would literally be a braindead marketing strategy hence why I don’t think they’ll go that route. 
---
However doing the partnerships thing like they did with twitch, and eventually giving this those items for FREE which they STATED, and being purely only cosmetics and animations to help encourage new players? Then that’s literally not a marketing, the ONLY thing, is that they mentioned the cosmetics can be purchased “pre-ordered more like” and it set the subreddit into ALPHA OMEGA Butthurt mode. 
---
That’s why I and more people than this sub-reddit thinks “mainly in-game “ voted yes. 
---
The game is fucking out-dated and can be ran on a toaster and has 2-3x more competition than they had in the 2000’s. Most new players don’t leave tutorial island before giving up on the game “Also has been stated before”
---
I welcome any new ploy “As long as it’s not MTX armors/weapons/xp” to invite new players. 
---
People on this subreddit are just simpletons and don’t understand the marketing scheme they’re going by.
---
Yeah Venenatis is definitely the best option but it's high risk high reward due to its dangerous location. It's a PK hotspot.
---
The thing is that unlike other bosses that drop supplies (such as Zulrah), there isn't as much value in killing Sarachnis because the only drop you're looking for as an ironman is the giant egg sac (whereas Zulrah has tons of things, including uniques that are important). So why would you spend prayer potions killing a boss solo just to get red spider eggs to make super restores later on? Tower of Life is "free restores" by comparison. It's just sort of a situation that doesn't make sense for ironmen -- you're just trading prayer potions for super restores potions but there exists a different way to get those super restores without trading in your prayer potions (which is actually faster).
---
It wouldn't even be a big deal except for the fact that both ranarr seeds and snapdragon seeds are somewhat rarer than the other ones, so wasting their products doesn't seem worthwhile.
---
Then please explain why during twitch prime offers botting gets a lot worse. Remember all the emblem and master farmer suicide bots? Those were a result of the loop hole. I'm not entirely sure how exactly they do it, but they do. Just look at the seed prices recently lol.
---
1 i will be qutting i started playing this game around 09 era and now i have only came back in OSRS in 2018 and now if mtx happens i think everyone will quit
---
Sorry for being so confrontational. I think I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today... First thing I saw this morning was some cheating rl+ crap and then just got ANGERY and started arguing with everyone I could find to reply to me on Reddit... I'm gonna log out for a bit. Have a good day.
---
I personally don’t think it should take over two years to put in a new security system. If we’re talking about stuff that doesn’t make sense from a security expert’s perspective. Security is lax as shit and does not seem to be a priority on their end, in all honesty. Sure they’ll throw a line or two in every couple blogs about how “they hear us and understand us.” It’s a blanket statement to silence us for a little. I equate it to a small slap in the face / flick on the nose to a dog. We’re barking asking for help and security and they come by- smack our nose so we’re quiet a bit- then go about their days.

looking at this image literally makes my neck tense

What I don't understand is are these partnerships to invite new players? If so why the hell would someone care about a different teleport animation, or house theme when they don't even know what they are?
---
Nice argument lmao. OSRS has more randomness than a majority of other MMOs. Yeah obviously it has a large skill portion but your hits are a literal dice roll.
---
If OSRS PvP was that competitive and skill intense, OSRS as an ESport wouldn't be the complete meme thst it currently is.
---
Can't wait for these clients with custom plugins to pick up steam, gonna be a shitshow.

I have never noticed that it was so heavy, and now that you drew my attention to it I am quite perturbed.  What materials are used to make this thing?

I love the total fear mongering by the reddit, simmer down it was just some cosmetic stuff, nothing is going to happen.
---
Your name is literally Trump.
---
Lmao there will always be bots no matter what, jagex gives all of them 1 week of membership. If this is your only point for why partnerships are bad I don’t know what else to say. And from the looks of it they aren’t offering membership with every promotion.
---
buy bonds noob
---
If you're using Absorbs, the most efficient way is AFKable for 1 min (flicking Rapid Heal). You can go AFK for up to 5 mintues (Overload timer), but you lose a lot of the value of your Absorb pots.
---
If you're doing the prayer method, you can AFK for a decently long time (not sure how long, but more than the efficient Absorb method), but obviously it costs way more.
---

Why does anyone other than swampletics bother?

Thank You Good Sir :) if i could give you gold i would

 Because of the nature of our community, of course they cant actually offer enticing things like xp or items that actually would interest a new player, so how will this even be effective lol

Im really hungover and i thought this was a melted zoidberg at first glance
---
Why? This is very humorous
---
Well I'll be doing what you did then chief!
---
its a lvl 68 called "loadimg", im sure he has multiple accounts tho.
---
I don’t like assholes, but people need to stop being crybabies. It’s up to Jagex at the end of the day what they do to his account, but he really didn’t break any in game rules. He may be a cunt, but I don’t think he deserves perm ban, especially if he couldn’t even talk in game...
---
That was the whole point, he was just proving despite Jagex stating the accounts are actually somehow monitored they were not. Things are most likely different at that time but that was totally important thing to bring up.
---
Anyone could check his post history and instantly see he’s a loser.  The first comment I saw was him calling someone a f*g
---
It would be too debatable what would qualify for it so can see why they aren’t implementing it
---
Good thing they hid poll results not too long ago....
---
The coins need to be behind a tree or they can just telegrab them

---
not if u have a slayer staff of staff of the dead equipped with crumble undead set to autocast. u can spam click all around the spawn cus u cant move and any click on the spawn will fire off the spell
---
that's convenient, for sure.
---
How can you possibly blame jagex for this..? They have a wilderness ditch you have to jump over and a warning pops up explaining what the wilderness is. 
---
Not much more they can do.
---
K you clearly don’t understand the point of the partnerships, the cosmetics don’t mean shit. Like with twitch prime the stupid purple skin didn’t mean anything it was just an extra thing given to people to try the game out. The partnerships are to increase exposure. It’s not a cop out you are clearly delusional. Have a nice day.
---
Okay but the team writing the code, as well as the CEO who pays them, say they don't want it.
---
I agree with OP because they’re worded carefully and most people only read the “do you want a Swampletics themed house” and not the rest of the question. Also pisses me off they tried to use Swampletics player base to vote yes on the VERY first question, scumbags tbh
---
Really? That’s funny. People like you are the we are getting MTX and Softer rules in the first place
---
I am considering to start playing again so I can quit when they add MTX.
---
The reason why there's 23 questions is because they wanted to poll each addition individually. The partnership phrase was only added to the polls because some people told Jagex that the questions weren't clear about there being a partnership involved. If anything, this made the questions more unclear. It was explained quite well beforehand.
---
The question whether we were okay with adding cosmetics through a partnership was never a poll question - this already happened, and will probably continue to happen. They're just going to poll each item individually, like they have always done.
---
Mhm, it's even weirder because all of these will be available for free afterwards
---
I mean OSRS completely died within a year without updates. If classic wow doesnt add updates like OSRS did it will die too.
---
Just realized chinchompas are named as such cuz they're like chinchillas...
---
Thanks for the feedback! :)
---
Same just happened to me, I think it may have been.
---
lmfao
---
Ranarr*
---
This is what is so sketchy to me. They didn't poll doing partnerships, they polled a bunch and said they all need to fail for them to not do it. So if one slips through like I don't know, the morytania one, then they will just continue to try and push this shit.
---
I bursted the spiders near the entrance for all the pages
---
Recommend doing that if you’re still looking for them
---
It contained proper spelling and grammar which is already above average for Jagex.
---
I just got this as well. If you head to results, they're visible and it mentions that it was cancelled today.
---
Yes exactly, the guy I was replying to was asking why you would use it. Imo it's not a big advantage, but yes, with a staff you won't have to reselect the spell manually.
---
I've started taking a break from the game. It as after i checked my days played it informed me I've played 62 days. Thats over like 12 or 13 years off and on, but it was definitely.an eye opener.

Probably the skeletal wyvern drop table buff. It set a precedent that all drop tables need to be packed with alchables and supplies, look at what we have now.
---
Lol those quests arent really going to help much they give like 1500xp between them.
---
The outrage is only this big now because people feel like this is the beginning of it becoming much worse. They're polling to add 23 new items through partnerships, instead of that (seemingly) one-time deal with Twitch Prime. Basically, everyone's worried what this will mean: are we talking about a year's worth of content additions through a partnership with one company? Are we talking about 23 individual partnerships here? And so on. Which is why everyone's making these memes with famous brands in OSRS.
---
🦀we can put the crabs away for now boys🦀 
---
Even though you guys got meme'd to all hell and alot was highly exaggerated, at least you guys arent afraid to admit where you went wrong.
---
They think your glorious art is a sin, carry on, brother. Spread the art, and the cheeks a bit more...
---
This is great to see. Deep down the staff at Jagex mean well, we just have to make sure we protect against them creeping up
---
It's 1/5000
---
What gets me is,
---
We ALREADY have MTX, are we going to pretend bonds aren’t a thing? That noobs sell them for quick mills?
---
We already had a partnership that nobody cared about because they HAVE subscriptions with them “Twitch” already. So it was free stuff.  Other than the free membership which spiked the bot usage up in-game. STILL. No controversy or a bunch of grown men crying. 
---
However if they suggest doing it again and STILL only use cosmetics that we are going to get for FREE after a while, what is the big deal?
---
It’s free stuff that doesn’t change ANYTHING with the game besides cosmetics AND it helps sponsor our declining game to help our numbers spike back up like they did during mobile launch.
---
Yes, read the news post
---
🐸🐸🐸 No to MTX 🐸🐸🐸

Please see the following blog that Mod Sween just made a Reddit thread for:  [https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/an-update-on-partnerships-and-old-school?oldschool=1](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/an-update-on-partnerships-and-old-school?oldschool=1)
---
Can you elaborate a bit? That is standard $13.50 AUD a month membership prices. I have 2 accounts, one I use a lot of bonds on instead.
---
You don't know how much I earn or my spending habits either dude.
---
To the frontpage? No, not really. The very few legit ones get "lol you sold your account" and "good luck" and Jagex's customer support.  The delegitimized  ones get to the front page for a smackdown.

I like this post. At first I thought it was something else, but i got a couple lines in and I agree with your sentiment. I would think from a business standpoint, the higher ups would recognize that the OSRS team has done fabulous work.
---
Also this is an idea I didnt have when writing the post, but if they really wanted to boost profit, I think a better idea would be releasing group iron man or HCUIM, think about what happened with HCIM, not only did a bunch more accounts be made with membership, but these modes qre so competitive that it would keep people playing and subscribing. We live in the age of runescape where people have multiple accounts, easily 4 per person (personally i got a main, an alt, a pure, and an ironman) with atleast 1 or 2 having membership on it at a time.
---
Right, now that you mention I think I did hear about him getting involved with RWT stuff. Thanks for clearing that up, I was unclear about whether he'd really gotten banned I guess.

The flax and essence drops were to intentionally crash the price and prevent botters from easily collecting and selling them.
---
I don’t think what they are being fully honest with you about that. A Lot of passionate people on here think similar. 
---
A conversation at jagex started with “how can we get...”  And the recent “partnerships” are what they have come out with. This isn’t coming from a good place.
---
Glad JaGeX listened to the community on this one. What bugged me the most about the proposed rewards was that they didn't feel like they needed to be locked behind partnerships. Why would we ever need a partnership reward to make our houses Morytania themed? Hopefully we can get the proposed rewards in a normal game update.

---
The most important thing here, regardless of how you feel about these MTX, is that they honored the poll results. They also reaffirmed that this stuff will get polled. That's a good sign.
---
Must be Alabama
---
&gt;  The results were so one-sided that the outcome of the poll could not change
---
Good job lads, proud of you all.
---
ez clear 1-0 dont try it again
---
This post is good to see, thank you. I think it’s hard for many of us to trust partnerships after similar with RS3 with no MTX were promised, but came out anyway. But osrs is different and our j mods have our back
---
Wait, but I thought the evil Chinese Overlords did everything wrong and the good old innocent always good US company will do no wrong? that doesn't fit with the subs raging hatred of CHinese people as sole ruinors of my precious kid MMO's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

They just closed the poll early because it was overwhelmingly negative.

Kinda a shitty title considering for this picture to have any context on this subreddit you needed to add words to it lmfso

hahahahhahahah good one, they will sneak it in as a footnote for the next quest you will vote for

Are you seriously this fucking dumb? Like I can't believe how painful this is. How hard is it to understand that people are worried about what this could bring on further down the line? This is the same company that is killing RS3 players for everything they've got. You are just clueless and I'm done wasting my time on you.
---
I'm done wasting my time as you're clearly a lost cause having looked through your recent comments. Yes I'm delusional for looking at the their track record and how bad mtx is on the original game. I've seen you put stupid shit like "they could change". Well clearly they haven't as they are suggesting MTX 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I love being called brainlet by brain dead people 😂

---
Wait, are you trying convince me to vote yes?
---
This. They managed the twitch sponsoring fairly well (besides the free membership) so I believe if they take the time to approach this carefully instead of ham-fisted and all at once, while being VERY CLEAR on their wording, they can still make this work for them while maintaining the integrity of this game.
---
Aren't VR systems pretty pricey? 
---
Especially if you need a expensive PC with it
---
I dont have one, but if iirc they're too rich for my blood. That's most likely the problem with a lot of people. It's too much money to dump into something that's not being developed fully yet
---
Yes. Knowing it will be implemented in the game makes me not want to grind the game knowing I'll hate it down the road. Players say to just live in the moment, fuck that.
---
They closed the poll. We're safe.
---
okay this is epic

Push your partnership system to RS3, when the people that come over to check it out realize its so bad they'll check out OSRS before they go and then get pulled into the real game.
---
Those don't really bring new players into the game though, they just make them more money. They explicitly stated multiple times including in this blog, that their intention with the partnerships was to bring in new players by advertising on the partner's website/products etc. A company sponsoring an event doesn't bring in people who aren't already at the event
---

I'd really like to see these cosmetic ideas added to things like achievement diaries. For example, the Wilderness POH theme could be a reward from the medium Wilderness diary.

Why would players be any more motivated to play castle wars if they’re wearing purple. Castle wars is dead for the majority of the player base due to a lack of rewards,  not because it isn’t fun.

---
Props to Jagex for honouring the poll, and I'm glad they aren't blind enough to see the impact this proposal had.
---
However this update seems to read more like "we're sorry you don't see it our way, next time we'll think of a better plan to introduce partnerships" rather than just "we're sorry and we hear you-this is not something you want!"
---
There are free worlds already...

Uh. I’ve been playing since 2003 my guy. Once again.. it’s not MTX if they give it to you for free. 
---
Fear is what’s going to ruin the future of this game. 
---
It takes 5-30 minutes to understand the marketing scheme they were going by. 
---
They even cleared it up after they closed the polls early and explained it. 
---
Literally everything they explained is basically what I’ve been telling everyone since yesterday.
---
That's why I upvoted. Unfortunately the jmods are on a temporary vacation from Reddit.
---
Repeated targeting of the same player with rag gear I guess?
---
I believe he used imps for that. But yes I saw that. I don't think he got a pickaxe from them though.

Add an uncommon drop to normal boss, consumed to fight a stronger version with better drops. Keeps mid and high level players separate there.

TELL ME HOW THIS IS ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE COW HOME TELEPORT THAT YOU UNLOCK FROM RUNEFEST

They've stated that they don't have the dev time to dedicate to a huge undertaking like new house t hemes, so they wanted to use the partnerships as an executive reason for making those cosmetic only updates

Tar monsters typically hit you 1-3 times, usually between trees 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, and sometimes 4/5 but that's uncommon.  Between 5/6 and 6/1 you're 100% safe.  Sometimes vine thing will wack you for a 10 when running to tree #2 (and poison) so keep that in mind.
---
Check your max hp, check their max hit and try to bring wines/brews accordingly.  You could also tele out after every tree 6 and replenish hp and bank.  It's not super dangerous, and if you die you can just run back with digsite pendant tele to house, then mushroom tele.  I die all the time either afking or for instant full heal. (Don't afk with a tar monsters hitting you lol..)

Good call. I’m all for partnerships, but I’m not a fan of content not being earned. Surely most of the PoH could be worked into achievement diary’s for example.
---
He went straight on Twitter to continue to harass aoaatube and brag about making another acc to rag him lol.
---
I feel like this subreddit doesn't understand what ragging is and how it is griefing.
---
To me, this doesn't make sense. All this potential content is all for "incentivizing new players to start, and old players to return" but the incentive should be the game itself. That's what osrs has always been, the reward is the content. Grinding to a level to unlock a new faster method, or to unlock some new gear, or to unlock a new quest that in turn unlocks a new area...
---
The whole 'give noobs shiny things' is an initiative I don't think I'd ever get behind.
---
I was still not ok with it, Jagex have been more and more profitable every year last year was a record year but the price for things goes up and up with the content on a slow trickel, Now they want us to to pay more money to a third party also? Its not on. When you are doing well you dont punish your players.
---
For now. Read closer
---
Least favorite part of the poll, having to say no to 19 questions that could've been consolidated into 2.
---
Yea well I hope so i wanna get 99 con might use rl+
---
Firstly, its tricky on reddit to find that lol. 
---
I agree though with you. Like they mentioned in the live stream, they did put thought into these 'rewards' as something that doesn't effect any one besides yourself. The POH skins would be awesome, they are only for you, or who ever you invite into your house. The skin is almost always covered by armor. The emotes i wasn't totally on board with, just because i feel we are getting pretty saturated with emotes. 
---
I just think this was their goal to give us something in return. We've had partnerships in the past. I really like the twitch ones. I'm down for some free memberships. Techincally in return for the partnerships with Google and Apple, we got Mobile. Which is the best thing thats ever happened to osrs imo.
---
Jagex have banned players from stuff on Reddit/Twitter before I'm pretty sure. It's not without precedent and they're well within their rights to not want a certain type of person on their game
---
No pal.
---
Create drama - then get praise for dealing with something you created in the first place?
---
Poll to change the cons icon had a lower pass rate than MTX. What 2 years does to a community
---
It was never polled to be instanced. So why would they poll that?
---
They're saying that if it's free for everyone, it won't be an achievement-based cosmetic like champions cape, so it won't hold a special place and will just be a fun thing, so as to not make some players upset or ruin fashionscape metas etc
---
I just don't like that they had initially planned to make it instanced, and then changed it based on a small group of people complaining that instances cater to ironmen. Would have liked to see it polled.
---
This is the cutest shit i've ever seen and i love it
---
But only if the merchants guild deems it profitable!
---
Holy shit the max cape emote should have fireworks going out like mad
---
In a vacuum the sentence doesn't make sense, but they've talked about why they chose those rewards at length and its quite obvious that's what they mean in context
---
HoW cAn YoU rAg SoMeOnE iF yOu ArE mUtEd?
---
Literally one of the higher upvoted posts in response to it.. ragging is literally harassment/griefing with in game actions
---
But it's not though, it's just even more exclusive partnerships.
---
Yes, we did win.
---
We are not fighting the OSRS team, like you said, they are on our side. We beat the company owners.
---
99% chance that if a scroll were to drop, it gets jammed instead, destroying it when you attempt to pull it out.
---
Oh SHIT, thought this was clickbait! Lets gooooo!
---
The further you scroll down, the less votes for Yes. Goes to show you the attention span and fucks given about the game by those who are  willing to purchase in-game content.
---
Clean it up
---
well i voted yes on the poll. why?
---
because partnerships are not mtx as all content will be released later on so you dont gain any bonus or speed up by using that.
---
and secondly jagex state in the blog, and i just assume the following, most people didnt even spend a second reading.
---
it was stated and in fat that they will refrain from adding any form of MTX to osrs.
---
plus i really wanted a house in other, fresh looks... would have loved a prif styled home....
---
Why’s he getting flamed when his stated multiple times that he doesn’t want his account back, he just wants to help jagex if something has happend
---
I hate this post
---
That is what I thought too but I can't find the post saying that now. 
---
They are definitely backpedaling. I'm surprised more people haven't noticed.
---
Jegex the guy and osrs is the fork
---
dumb af imo tbh
---
Wow. Absolute train wreck.
---
valid point except there is something we can do about it. strike, not like osrs fally strikes. but dwindling playercount strikes. after what ive seen on reddit with the last poll im certain everone would be onboard.

They weren't after money, as they state many times including in this blog. The idea was to promote the game on the partner's websites and products, so that people who wouldn't see it otherwise check out the game, and the game grows.
---
Do you have brain worms
---
You lost our trust long ago Jagex. Even if this was a legit opportunity your community does not trust you.
---
LOL. 
---
&gt;Shit all over the players 
---
Meanwhile they end the poll early due to overwhelming negativity and reaffirm their position on monetization. You're responding extremely aggressively to a very fair situation. In a world where microtransactions are expected in new games, you're upset that Jagex gave players the right to shut down extremely minimal cosmetics as the result of a partnership.
---
Grow the fuck up.
---
so brave
---
Oh for sure. btw you don't need the if before iirc, that's like saying PIN number or ATM machine
---
Getting Shelob vibes from LOTR, very nice!
---
to the 30% that voted yes: go play rs3
---
We know twitch ain’t bringing in any MTX, it’s purely for membership. If you would like to complain about how twitch prime promotes a lot of bots in this game, then yeah I’ll be okay with getting rid of it
---
*puts on tinfoil hat*
---
Is it something someone else can work towards? No? Then its a benifit. Fashionscape is the entire game to some people.
---
Interesting take, but even in that world yes I think a company should be praised for admitting a mistake and listening to their players. Most gaming companies would not do that.
---
I voted yes because new players and partnerships with other gaming companies would be good for the game
---
Average age of the game is 21, returning players are good medium-term. But it’s in Jagex best interest to attract *new* players. If you love the game and want it to flourish in the future we are going to have to accept that non-intrusive partnerships are healthy for the game. Then, if Jagex keep to their word (which I personally think they will), and this isn’t just a stepping stone to MTX, then that’s great. But if they don’t, then we can come down on them and tell them we are unhappy.
---
Well damn I also apologize. I realize I might have been confrontational as well. Like mentioned I do understand your frustration and it's for a good reason. Clients like these shouldn't be allowed. I merely wanted to point out that MTX and 3rd party clients are two separate topics and should not be compared. Both however pose a problem (Talking about clients such as RL+ and Lyzardite before anyone starts raging)
---
The official posts put out by the dev team do not suggest this.
---
Actually, in this case, yeah
---
People love to shit on Jagex but can you think of another company that responds so well to the actual wants of it's fanbase? Just look at Pokemon right now.
---
I knew it was fake and people on this sub IMMEADIATELY jumped on the jagex hate bandwagon again...
---
No cosmetics, No cash shop.
---
Fuck off.
---
regardless of their condecension they are honoring the results of the polls. If they add this suggested partnership and use it to springboard into more invasive MTX then the game's already dead and they're just hooking up the life-support. 
---
If they don't and they poll the more invasive MTX and respect the polls when it gets smacked down then we still have OSRS without invasive MTX, maybe some minigames get revived, and jagex gets partnership money, a win-win-win.
---
Yes and this is their first failed attempt. There will be more
---
What about putting one skin in a poll for halloween? Wouldnt that be fine like the other ones that were polled in the previous holiday events?

If it was instanced you would have to solo it. Making it too strong of a boss for mid levels anyways. They cant do a group instance until the engine team finishes the clan system. 
---
Which leaves the only other option which is multi
---
less about being brave on the internet as in stating my opinion.
---
Look at bad it is talking about shit you know nothing of
---
How hard are the fight caves?  I've never done them before, and want to do them on my ironman account.  I have 72 range, 70 defense, and 56 prayer.  I cannot make super restores or brews, or bastion potions like the wiki suggests.  I do have a rune crossbow and broad bolts. I'm comfortable lazy flicking single creatures, but have trouble in multi.  Should I wait on a higher range level, better gear, or give it a go?
---
We did it boys
---
Voting yes is sort of retarded tbh. These are all cosmetic rewards that are unlocked through promotions outside the game. Players typically enjoy rewards when they are earned inside a game through their own effort. Nobody likes the cancerous "Pre-order at gamestop to unlock the X reward" garbage.
---
They mentioned partnering with Google and Apple for mobile. The reward for that was the game itself. If they stamped a banner on their mobile ads that said "Unlock the Morytania House theme by downloading this app right now and giving it 5 stars!!", the game would look and feel less attractive overall. Nobody with any self-respect would use any of those cosmetic skins either, because using them only encourages those shitty business tactics.
---
Man, buying all this xp sure is some hard work
---
I’ve never done it myself but given what we know about how recoils work, in theory it makes perfect sense.
---
Maybe try having a bigger dev team and you wont lose 15% of your player base in a month.
---
Promise better events instead of "Dmm #1110", "We use to make good quests #3" and "slayer update 3521"
---
you are very talented artist, my friend.
---
i don’t really like this since it would feel very out of place to see “MOUNTAIN DEW
---
Calm down.
---
The tone of the post is that because you are all confused and overreacting. This past few days has been infuriating for me on this sub. Watching people blow this partnership thing out of proportion and attack it for being something that it wasn't made this sub unusable the last few days.
---
I doubt this poll and overreaction to it will have any effect on future partnerships or the possibility of mtx in the game. If it does have an effect I'd expect it to make actual mtx more likely or increase sub costs as they'll have to find ways of making money other than increasing the player base.
---
Top bants lads.
---
Nice argument buddy.
---
Extraction of Currency
---
Fair point.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but I was under the impression it "only" had cosmetics and expansion packs (in the earlier pre 2010 versions at least)?
---
I have stopped playing since the poll, yes. But I guess I'll come back in a day or two - because the poll has been cancelled, and Jagex has reaffirmed its promise not to do MTX again (let's see for how long).
---
This and that black nike graceful fit actually are fire, but I won’t pay a cent for a MTX no matter what.
---
Probably better all-around stats even though berserker ring (i) has the +4 strength on it. The brimstone ring has the benefits of the unimbued berserker ring while also giving you +4 crush bonus so it's a nice balance between strength (which is good for DPS) and crush (which is good because Sarachnis is weak to it).
---
Basically you can think of it as an analogy: the brimstone ring is to the amulet of fury as the berserker ring is to the amulet of torture.
---
I meant that Jagex might be innocent in this regard. I was thinking about clarifying it in the original post but decided that everyone has the simple reading comprehension skills required to determine what I meant. Clearly I was wrong.
---
Can you please do this, but with the normal girl still in it. Link It too
---
Wow you're a cornball
---
Didn’t they release a sims game that you had to pay for a dlc before you could even play it properly? Maybe I’m wrong but I remember something about that years ago.
---
/u/JagexSween this blog post comes across incredibly snide.  
---
It really feels like you're all stomping your feet while saying "it's the player's fault! They did this! They just don't get it!"  
---
If the players really "don't get it" then that's a problem with the previous blog, the poll questions, or the communication from Jagex on this topic.  
---
I really really feel that the author of this blog(and those that may have approved it) missed the point with some things. For example:  
---
&gt; We heard that you wear your cosmetic accomplishments with a feeling of pride. **That's why we promised** that the content we were offering would become freely available to all players once the partnership ended.  
---
That second sentence... You just said that you heard we wear our "cosmetic accomplishments with a feeling of pride." then immediately contradict yourself by suggesting a free cosmetic with no requirements could be worn with an equal feeling of pride and accomplishment.  
---
There's a lot more that rubs me the wrong way with this blog but I don't think there's a need for me to go through point by point.
---
Your entire game looks like Disney fucked Warcraft and aborted the baby after 6 months
---
I mean, so far I agree. I tried lastnight, but obviously it was gonna be busy, but didn't see anyone with combat less than 110. Tried again this morning and hit hop limit twice n when I finally got a world, I was crashed before I even reached 50% hp.
---
Its certainly a mid teir boss tho, mechanics are easy enough to understand, but are a little more than just camping one pray which I enjoy.
---
I think the max mains will move on soon, so it's not all doom and gloom 😁 dw man, I think this boss will be good for mid tier players come next week.
---
What if they introduced this poll knowing that it would receive negative feedback. This way they could “pretend” like they honor poll results, 
---
Now they are gearing up for a bigger poll which they will rig towards their favor.
---
it’s probably the truth as far as ash knows, but he knows ultimately he has no power with these decisions
---
Well the choice between either getting content and allowing them to make even more revenue or receive nothing for the revenue we already give is just wrong. We do pay a monthly membership so that updates and maintenance are possible. Our 11$ isn't just for updates that increase revenue for Jagex.
---
Dude idk what to tell you. Rs2 never gave a shit about player feedback they always kept the ball rolling no matter how the updates were received. I don't feel like i need to explain this to you you can do your own research if you never played rs2.
---
Lol I’m in Italy right now and was so confused.
---
Again I think they would have said if these were going to be free from the get go, I refuse to believe jagex are that incompetent that they forgot to add that its a benifit to everyone involved with no downside to anyone. If they are then they need to fire their entire marketing team.
---
Too high quality for this sub

---
They can say all they want about that sort of thing *never* happening in osrs. The cancer that is rs3 says otherwise
---
They could have rigged the polls just as easily while they were visible.
---
I had recovered an old account, set the password to something I had used in the past. Was f2p, didn't have much on it in terms of money. I didn't log on for like 3 weeks because I wasn't really playing rs.
---
When I tried to log in next time it was perm banned for macroing. Probably because the old account info (from like 2009 or so) was compromised, saved in some database, w/e. 
---
Took me 3 days to get the account unbanned.

Yeah you were REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
It’s too late for me little buddy. I’ll take one for the team and eat two happy meals at a time so you can get your figurines without taking the risk.

But dont need more money. They made $49M in profit last year. That is after all dev and staff expenses.

If anything they should be hiring more devs to thin out the work

Why do you like democracy? There's a old saying that goes "Democracy is 2 wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner." Democracy is mob rule, the majority gets to stomp out the rights of the minority. Hence why America is a constitutional republic, not a democracy.

Nice! I just hit 600kc - no claw, no jar, no leather, and only the first piece of the brim key. And what makes me a little bitter is that I have 3 tail drops that are the same rate as the 6.5m leather -_- but I can't be too mad since I got the pet at kc 364
---
It's kind if unnerving how well made picture this is. Like it literally could have come straight out of 2020 OSRS.
---

---
Shut the actual fuck up Jamflex. Lmfao what a load of fucking shit.
---
Well, boys, we did it. MTX is no more.
---
Good luck wasting thousands on your mums cc
---
Not to derail your excitement, but did you read the blog post? Whoever wrote it was extremely passive aggressive and the whole post had an underlying tone of "you all just don't understand that these were going to be free for everyone and you don't understand how important these are."
---
All the mod posts I've been seeing looked like they were mad at the opposition to partnerships.
---
Whether that's because they wanted to them to pass, or knowing if they they fail, more aggressive measures would take their place. I don't know, but this isn't over.
---
Thanks Mr aspergers
---
I really like this idea, helps our boys at Jagex out and doesn’t add rewards, it’s just fun for players. The difficulty is it can delve into a slippery slope and everyone is scared of MTX creeping up on us, but in situations like this we do have to trust the staffs word about fpolling anything real-world related. If this idea passed a poll I would be 100% in support of it
---
Who is Jim Jung Yung
---
Truthfully as a kid i loved the idea of MTX. When it was first added I was too young to be able to afford it and my parents barely were even okay with subscriptions.  
---
But as I've grown up I've learned why they are wrong and now disagree with the current situation in the video game world with the plague of content locked behind DLCs and the influx of pay to win and obscenely obnoxious cosmetics(looking at you WoW mounts).  
---
However you're partially right about me not playing RS2. I did play it, but I was much too young to understand exactly what MTX was when it was added, I just saw it as another part of the game.  
---
I'm curious what you think playing RS2 changes about someone's opinion on this poll
---
Honestly at that time i was like 12 so I probably just misunderstood
---
Make absolute sure to be doing the Hard version. Otherwise you get shit points.
---
Desert Treasure + Dream Mentor bosses give a fucking massive amount of points.
---
Here are my tips for points: When going for points, you do not AFK. Checking the screen every minute to see which bosses spawned is fine, you don't need to play more actively than that. 
---
When a DT/DM boss spawns, prioritize that. 
---
Use the powerups Zapper and Recurrent damage. Make sure to move around so Zapper actually hits the enemies. When Zapper is active, don't hit the enemies with high defense (the shell and big guy from DM). When Recurrent damage is active you can either use it to more easily kill the high defense guys, or to quickly kill the low defense guys.
---
If using the DT bosses, flashing protect from magic IIRC teleports you to Kamil. That's way easier than running to him when he barrages you.
---
&gt; only 62m
---
*cries in skillscape*
---
Ah yes. I could never imagine a world where Runescape’s dev team said “we’ll never add MTX” and then slowly began to add them
---
It's there, at least in the greyed out non-member sprite.
---
&gt;Yeah man. For me it started with the wildi removal and free trade.
---
Yup.  Wilderness was like 80% of the reason I played.  I quit the day that happened and pretty much forgot about Runescape until I heard about OSRS in like 2015.
---
I almost kind of feel bad for these lads at Jagex, it seems like they really want it but at the same time they're not going full Donald Trump on our asses and actually honoring the results.
---
literally just got claw on 4499 kc holy shit feels unreal man
---
Well tbh i only ever played wow for pvp and pvp in vanilla was pretty terrible lol
---
Every expansion had its flaws though, you are right.
---
This actually looks really fucking good
---
11/10 amazing job
---
The state of RS3 and the small playerbase is them constantly breaking their promises. 
---
I play mostly RS3, we dont trust shit they say anymore.

I’m not sure what part of “zero MTX” is hard to grasp
---

I must be missing something... r/woooosh ?

I wasn't aware of that website until long after Runescape had taken a hold of me and my friends. I have heard about it since but I am guessing it wasn't predatory.
---
This is my favorite picture of your's so far. Thanks!
---
They just never learn, smh
---
Right so they planned on charging for it via a third party until X time had passed I doubt it would have been 1 or 2 months I think closer to 2-3 years but they never mentioned how long the time would be which is another reason the reaction ended up as it did, They could have held the content behind a third party pay wall for 50 years before releasing it to us plebs who knows.
---
Lol I voted no on the poll as well. Doesn't mean I care about this idiot spamming irrelevant shit on the sub. No one has any idea what these new hires are going to contribute to Jagex, they may make the game better for all we know. This post is a prime example of reddit hive mind shit that achieves nothing.
---
100% agree!!
---
Twitch prime users will get early access to the poll results.
---
Make a basic game a new one. It’s like a survival mod on Skyrim or fallout new Vegas. It makes the stale go unstale. That’s what got me into it. Just wanted fire cape and barrow gloves. Not chase the best gp/hr. Also passed old main recently at 1850 total and only 2 easy diaries done lol. 
---
Osrs is one of the few games that you can put hundreds of hours in. And still have thousands to go. I finished bloodborne started making a bunch of pvp accounts. That’s when I realized I had an osrs withdraw
---
You honestly think they would add unpolled mtx into the game? This subreddit would collectively lose its mind.
---
This art style is awesome, great job!
---
Well we were discussing Jagex, so am slightly confused why you made the distinction between Jagex proper and the current OSRS team.  Surely you realise that the team responsible for OSRS is beholden to Jagex?  Thus the precedent set by Jagex prior to this also applies to OSRS.
---
LMAO
---
No need to be so rude my man. I guess I'm just not gamer enough to hate all the people that work in my favorite game.
---
&gt;...for any game to continuously grow and attract new players there is a need for strong partnerships
---
Now come on. We both know that isn't true, Jagex. Other MMOs are doing stellar without shit from 'partnerships.'

What if we voted “no” but In jagex eyes “No” means “Yes”?

The reward system would work same as in the game. You get a stamp on your coupon for slaying a meal. You can get an item with 1 stamp but you have a better chance of getting an item with multiple stamps, up to 6 stamps. Getting multiple items with one coupon is possible but there’s also a chance you get none.
---
If you think someone would be fired on the spot for that you’re just clueless.
---
&gt;At the end of the day, the mods you know and love and who genuinely care about the game aren’t the top of the chain of command at Jagex.  
---
Which is exactly why I believe that adding something like these partnerships is the best way forward. The higher ups most likely wont listen when Jmods say the community will hate MTX and will leave the game. But they won't try to push these things if Jagex continues increasing revenue (by adding partnerships).  
---
I see two possible futures being most likely.  
---
A. Jagex manages to do partnerships and increase their revenue, higher ups see increased profits and are happy.  
---
B. Jagex doesn't add partnerships. Revenue plateaus and higher ups demand MTX be added to increase revenue.  
---
Granted there is the possiblity of  
---
C. Partnership is added, higher ups see increased revenue and want even more, thus forcing MTX(unlikely IMO, higher ups from my experience are less likely to force things when the game is growing)  
---
D. Partnership isn't added, higher ups listen when Jmods say that players will riot and quit if MTX is added (unlikely, when do higher ups ever actually listen to lower employees, especially in game companies.)
---
I mean to say splashing hubs. Lumbridge was a hub because it was easy to access and a lot of targets to splash
---
Ash is a good dude. He'll do his best to keep the game's integrity intact, and memberbase satisfied, even if part of that unfortunately includes making promises about others that he can't keep.
---
Even though your intentions were well, doesn't mean that us accepting partnerships now would mean that the next generation of mods wouldn't buckle in a few years, hence this strong response i suppose. 
---
Too many games where this went wrong, and rs3 itself is a prime example of how any company tiptoes over the grey areas to see how far they can go.
---
I read it as more of a guilt trip. Like "well we tried doing a bunch of cool stuff for you guys, but you're obviously ungrateful brats"
---
tbh i didnt knew thesw were micro transactions when i voted yes. sorry guys 😅
---
This sub is desperate for controversy, so they basically just extend the definition of MTX as far as they possibly can until anything that possibly could involve money that isn't a sub or, ironically, a bond, is now considered MTX.
---
It truly has no place in this game. I saw one comment saying something along the lines  of compare the difference of the twitch prime skin recolour and reolouring your graceful set. Which is more satisfying?
---
It’s the grind that’s rewarding.
---
If you used a little more thinking you'd realize mtx is the most common trend in monetising videogames. And jagex fucked up once. Why are you so convinced it'd work? And I'd love if it osrs could grow more but absolutely not like that. Don't be one of those numb headed dipshits that wants to go against the current just for the fuck of it
---
This was me as well. I don't think jagex is stupid enough to ruin osrs. And I honestly thought the proposed cosmetics sounded pretty cool and tame. It's a slippery slope, but I'm confident jagex has good footing.
---
I would've trusted jagex if this was the first time they wanted to start on this slope. Unfortunately this is their *second* time, and RS3 is the result of their first attempt. I have absolutely 0 trust that if these baby steps got started that Jagex wouldn't start clenching down the ratchet.
---
No means no #MTXtoo
---
SO much XP waste now that its been cancelled..
---
The battle is won, but the war rages on
---
You think we're "conspiracy theorists" because you don't understand. I don't blame you, at the end of the day it's just a game.
---
The only reason bonds passed in the first place was due to Jagex's manipulation. Go back and read the poll question.
---
&gt;Should we add a full and permanent F2P service **alongside** Membership Bonds?
---
The majority of naive players saw "F2P" and had no further questions. Many who voted had no clue what a "bond" even was.
---
If Jagex had any shred of integrity they would've at the very least separated the questions:
---
&gt; 1. Should we add Bonds, a way to buy in-game gp with real world money? Bonds can also be used to buy membership with in-game gp.
---
&gt; 2. If the above passes, should we add F2P?
---
Hell, even the concept of a bond is manipulative at its core. Once again, if Jagex had any integrity they would've polled bonds like this:
---
&gt;1. Should players be able to buy membership with in-game gp.
---
&gt;2. If the above passes, should players be able to buy in-game gp with real world money?
---
I've obviously spent the time breaking it down for you, but naturally I can't do this for every single naysayer who believes they're above the angry mob. I hope you can see why you're wrong in suggesting that the backlash is simply superficial.
---
Yeah thanks, just sold my Elder Maul, made a nice 4m profit. Might just try with my whip once it gets less crowded. For now I just upgraded the rest of my gear.
---
You're honestly telling me that different POH skins takes enough dev time for partnerships to be required.
---
I check the sub everyday, yet hardly ever post/comment. I agree, I think the subreddit reaches farther than some estimate
---
So you think mtx cosmetics are not an issue. You pay money for a cosmetics... no issue got it. Maybe you should go back to rs3 with that mentality osrs does not want that.
---
Not really a surprise. The Jmod response literally said the dude had been perm muted for being toxic af.
---
of course they are unhappy, bet that they're missing out on a lot of profit. businesses and money man
---
it's only worth it if you're really wealthy and can pick risk fights to your advantage and just win more than you lose with consistency and better gear. 
---
But overall, it does feel not worth it, and that's why it's pretty dry out there. 
---
yeah though, that was my favorite part of nr, you could seriously just get rich off being good at pking, and not at a horrible pace either, there was also risk fights available at so many cash levels too, fuck it was so nice....
---
Elite void actually looks like a sick anime outfit
---
Jagex will always pursue sponsorships. It's how you bring new players into the game. People thinking this poll would stop sponsorships forever are delusional. And tbh jagex has a right to be a bit condescending because most people think partnerships = mtx. Jagex has already done multiple partnerships and the twitch one even had cosmetics. I never heard anyone complain about it until this poll. Jagex is right that most people completely misunderstood what the poll was even about. So many people in my cc were talking about voting to stop partnerships. That's not what the vote was about. Jagex clearly said before, and again in the new blog, that partnerships will not stop. And I agree with them.
---
I think it was the principle of why he was banned, not that he was banned. It I recall correctly it wasnt due to his toxic language, but targeting specific streamers who were pking in the wildy.
---
Which was a good concern. Where's the line for how many times you can target a streamer in the wildy? Once? Twice? I think a lot of people got worried that they may get banned themselves for doing something similar, or perhaps without even knowing. We shall never know
---
Lol this was totally stolen from my comment

Fuck whoever wrote this blog post.

U can turn in void tops for 200m in all 7 cmb skills. Store xp lamps too for any other skill.

Or if we talking about cml records, you can store wine cooking xp and get a near 200m drop then do the above but it would take longer than 24hours but it would show up as getting 199m xp in one log in.

It's just a prank bro
---
Behind all the memes that's what we want. In game content to be the hook, that was enough for us, and we don't want it to change.
---
Not necessarily, if it leads to long term revenue drops due to depleting population. Ultimately, the owners (stockholder is not precise, for jagex) should care more about asset value than yearly dividends.

For real butthurt bitches

many people were on his side too... just fantastic judge of character

Delete post
---
Bit late bud, the poll went through and the mtx was halted.. good try tho.
---
This is where a lot of the community is still divided, I'm not even talking about future mtx. I DONT WANT THIS BECAUSE THIS IS MTX.
---
Well isn’t WoW $15 a month plus the expansions? And they obviously wouldn’t release more than one a year
---
Yeah, and it makes sense. It's a good tripwire if it's advertised on other platforms, but it's not a great update if it's just released to us and advertised normally.
---
If it's something on discord like "get nitro and unlock elven house style!" not only makes people think it's a cool cosmetic update, but also think "sick, I can have my own house in this game"

A Facebook ad or newspost doesn't have the same enticement

Blows my mind too! We now have freesymc and gsync monitors that can all absolutely sync to 120hz just like the old 3d TVs could, yet its no longer a thing!! So many people now have the monitor and GPU for 3D stuff, but no one cares any more. :/
---
\*looking at you Tedious, GenerateTask series\*

Alexa define passive-aggressive
---
The thing is they can still bring in MTX, in another way if they truly wanted. Hopefully if they do it doesn't ruin the game at all. Only time will tell.

Ya know what would make me play a minigame less, an advertisement reskin
---
Which is still 8 minutes more than getting to Falador.
---
You’re on the sub so that makes it real hard
---
This is what I worry about too
---
Can we not just have a medieval fantasy game that’s set in a medieval fantasy?
---
Slippery slope isn’t a fallacy if there’s evidence that the consequences may occur. We have that evidence directly in front of us with rs3.
---
If you really think stupid shit like skin colors or POH themes would retain new players who simply don’t like the grindy nature of a game like osrs, you’re brain dead.
---
Cosmetic reward from partnerships is an indirect MTX. Instead of the standard model (pay a micropayment to the company for an in game item) we have an indirect one (pay a third party company, who then pays Jagex). The start and end result is the same. They are not separate. Secondly, do you really, genuinely, sincerely believe that Jagex (or rather their chinese corporate overlords, not the devs) don't want MTX in OSRS? Even though it is insanely profitable, basically every other online multiplayer game in the world right now has some form of it, and Jagex themselves has it in RS3? Considering the immense profitability of MTX, Jagex' parent company would literally be failing in their sole and only purpose as a publically traded company (increase shareholder value) if they didn't try as they could to implement it.
---
&gt; Whilst we do believe that partnerships can be used for the growth of Old School RuneScape, we're going to work with you to see what you would be happy with. Again, we welcome your feedback on this and rest assured, no in-game content for partnerships will be added without a poll.
---
This post to me basically reads "we're still gonna do the partnerships, and we're either gonna keep polling stuff until you relent (or quit) or we'll keep giving away free membership to ruin the economy, either way it's a payday to us" 
---
I'm not entirely sure that the team have managed to use this to show the higher ups that are pushing for this that we are voting no to the MTX aspect instead of voting no to the content
---
thats the joke.
---
Totally agree, mtx are fine in certain circumstances. The bad part is Jagex has lost our trust in that regard, only reason everyone voted no.
---
Its not about MTX so no upvotes
---
This. They will try again in the future with more concrete plans instead of abstract terms.
---
I thinkbthey saying 72m of assets, is trash.
---
Ill leave it to you to decide what that trash is....
---
*cough rs3 cough*.
---
That paragraph is so important because its exactly where they contradict themselves and use a careful choice of words to make it seem like they aren’t.  It’s literally like PR stunts companies come out with when they mess up.
---
When the staff has to dumb-down to explain simple marketing to the community you really have to question the community. 
---
Reddit is currently the cancer of the game.
---
That last one is the biggest factor for me not playing more VR. Minecraft VR was so much funm I just get pulled out when my neck or face starts to hurt and its a hassle to get back in.
---
Did you just take people’s memes that they made themselves from this sub and make it into a video? I’m not watching that. Create your own content you wank
---
Mtx is mtx
---
The poll failed tho..?
---
Lol
---
Very difficult. I just hopped around asking groups of 3 or less very nicely if I could do 1 solo. 33Kc prob took 13hrs
---
As if that wasnt exactly the problem, putting shit behind a time gated paywall
---
You can't be this dumb, right?
---
And we will call it private server scape!
---
Jfc is this a meme or actual tin foil hat material?
---
It's mtx
---
We are getting stuff, though. We get updates pretty much every week. It just makes more sense to work on something else that might bring other players in than releasing poh styles in a void.
---
As I've said, making a partnership tripwire would justify the dev time spent on something that would otherwise not be much worth it.
---
At least that's what I understood from their explanation, I'm not exactly sure how thing go over there
---
I suppose it "can" be done, but collecting the resources by hopping worlds for planks I'd say is a bad intro to the game. World hopping is an endearing "feature" to old players, but more of an annoyance/bug to new players.
---
Also does not solve the fact that construction is hands down the worst skill to train on mobile imo. With so much of the player base joining because of mobile (I did) it is probably bad to force this content on them if you want to retain them.
---
So is buying membership Mtx?
---
what entitlement
---
Has anyone ever used the undead spell? I don’t think I’ve ever used it in my 20 years of RuneScape lol
---
Let’s be honest, we won the battle but the war is still uphill. Jagex knows why we’re pissed, it’s because they were trying to get us on MTX by packaging it up in (admittedly cool) cosmetics, and saying we would get it for free eventually. 
---
They want to turn up the heat to cook the frog. They learned they need to start from a lower temperature.
---
You captured their cuteness perfectly
---
Do dhide bodies for crafting not uncut gems
---
Remind me when I said MTX cosmetics?
---
Iirc, they've said pure cosmetics are hard to justify.  And especially house skins.  Someone on a QA asked about Priff skins based on the models they showed and the artist said something about POH skins being a lot of extra work.  They couldn't just copy paste the existing assets onto a house frame.
---
Well, yeah. Priest in Peril tells a story, has some minor challenges involving combat, and introduces and unlocks the entire region of Morytania. The quest is easy, but I don’t think that it’s a good experience for a player’s first encounter with a distinct kind of architecture or symbolism to be in their own POH. In my opinion, it’s important that those themes are presented in their intended context first so that the player character’s story follows a consistent progression, the player knows how those themes fit into the world, and so that when you see those themes in game, you always know that they are there for a reason tied to the game world.
---
&gt; Maybe you don't understand how companies are only after profits. Out of 30-40% of players ok with something like that, they only need 5% of those to be 'whales' for it to make financial sense
---
Oh I understand that companies are profit oriented. But if people are angry and stop playing because mtx are added, then Jagex will lose money. They know this, and I doubt the risk/reward potential for adding mtx makes it worth it for them.
---
You feel bad for people who make a ton of money getting upset that their players aren't happy with them wanting even more money? Bro... Don't defend corporations, they will piss on your corpse at the prospect of $5 extra.
---
You sound like a dumb asshole my friend
---
Nah I wanted to show people the extent that the community was freaking out via reddit and the sick memes that were made. Don't take everything so seriously my dude, this is all for fun and discussion.
---
For me, the only video that has ever taken priority over By Release has been the 532 hour climb. But that isn't a fight a mortal can win tbh
---
Fair but they've set precedence for ignoring poll results and doing it anyway. Sometimes even flying it in under the radar, never even mentioning implementation. Small stuff, fairly insignificant really. But the fact is, they've proved they're willing to defy poll results, and that scares me.
---
It would have if it notified him in game. The auth doesnt protect u from recovery, but it could. Hence why the sub wants a delay. A delay that cant be removed would have prevented most of the jed hackings.
---
Maybe higher combats have to pay a high fee to enter or something
---
&gt; the voting so far has sent a clear message – and as such, we've made the decision to end the poll early. The results were so one-sided that the outcome of the poll could not change. 
---
This made me smile. There’s definitely been some blunders in the past, but today I’m proud of this community.
---
I was really comparing the cost if given the same amount of prep time as the void method. But yeah, you're right.
---
Yh, we has great respect for you guys, get doing what you guys do.
---
Hell yea. Going from::train to pking with a lime whip in no time at all!
---
Those kinds of updates aren't getting dev time if they aren't making more money. They're trying to give us cool cosmetics that we want but can't justify spending time on. I thought introducing them with partnerships was a good idea. It lets them spend dev time on cool cosmetics that people want because it's being used in a promo to draw in new players.
---
I believe the petition was made to appease to all of those unhappy with the EoC
---
Alexa, play despacito.
---
that's what we wanted, for sure.
---
A $100 player on a mobile sports game.... That makes the $60 charecters look like a screamin' deal.
---
The sad part is that people will pay for it and companies will cater to that demographic....
---
Surprise! Not everyone comes to this sub and not everyone is as invested in the game. There's a lot of people who have no idea what any of it means and just vote yes to everything because they like new things.
---
What if he was actually secretly fired so they could move the plan forward lol
---
Definitely.
---
Though I am curious what job you have to make the $121 for membership in 2.5 hours. That's about 50 bucks an hour. Good for you, man.
---
This aged well :)
---
ITT: idiots who think phishing links somehow lets them get access to ones email. They cant remove ur auth just by u giving them ur username, pass, and current auth code.
---
Fish it, you get LVL/5 worth each catch now
---
Go see a doctor, you seem pretty angry.
---
It's just PR and trying to save face. I don't think a single person at Jagex or person who wrote the post truly believes that the player base isn't going to interpret their partnership BS as testing the waters with MTX.   
---
If you have to justify/explain why it's not MTX, it probably is MTX lol
---
Lol!
---
Sween wrote it, what do you expect? He's got a record of being passive-aggresive to the community before and it's a shame he's still acting that way
---
Prove it.
---
It's been a while, but those blog posts honestly don't really sound like Jagex.
---
Seeing as EA has been hired, you guys are going to be relentlessly attacked with MTX as time goes on. EA destroys everything it touches.
---
&gt;prom queen
---
High school sweetheart maybe more appropriate
---
You can also interpret that as 30% of the voting playerbase that trusts Jagex.
---
I can (almost) assure you that people don't mind partnerships with cosmetics that become available at a later date. Twitch prime was pretty darn successful in that aspect and people rarely complain about the skin colors.
---
*However* a large portion of the playerbase very clearly doesn't trust Jagex that the partnership cosmetics would be the end of it. More than likely, that 70% 'no' vote represents people who fear OSRS will follow the path of RS3, and doesn't necessarily mind the partnerships themselves.
---
No, i agree that their client needs to get better, but i do not want clients like runelite (+) that shows you every step of the game, or have anything that can be unlocked by achievements.
---
&gt; so you need to go to where the potential players are to get them on board.
---
But what are you going to market this game with? Free cosmetics? That's insanity for a game like this lol
---
I trained magic using non combat methods and now I have really low HP, am I fucked?
---
they're after the pet/completionist stuff friend. and to test it out. The gp the scythe squads are getting there is pocket change compaired to what they can make most other places.
---
slippery slope: OSRS's favorite term this past week. yet another opinion you pulled from others.
---
Cute newb in mystics, this is so well done, I will never not think of this image every time I hear the phrase cute noob.

You out here making rs3 players bad talmbout “fases” LOL
---
You're so clever, try &amp; speak their language
---
one of the largest mobile apps? that is very wrong, not trying to me negative but some mobile games have millions of players
---
Your lack of knowledge from previous rs history is your own fault, go research yourself. If history is ignored or erased it will repeat itself.
---
This comment didn’t age well
---
Seriously troubling that over a quarter of the community was okay with this.
---
I do 86.2%, which is obtained by killing all the brothers plus 2 skeletons and a blood worm. I’ve done 40 runs now and have gotten veracs skirt and karils crossbow.
---
Define sketchy partnership ?
---
If they don't browse outside the game they likely don't vote in polls.  Couple that with this subreddit having over 300k subscribers while most polls get 40-60k votes don't buy that there's a massive base of casuals who were waiting for the weekend
---
No, that's not what he said. He said 'dumb'.
---
I was pro partnership, because Jagex is clearly looking to ramp up advertising and isn't dumb enough to introduce anything permanent, super visible or important as MTX. If they don't have a way to get free advertising (partnerships), they'll spend money and we get $12.
---
Sub time could work, but only so often. Unless it's behind a paywall (not including Amazon because it's so common), expect most of the informed community to claim it - they're losing that much sub time worth of money existing players would have paid anyway, and that can get much more expensive than just ads.
---
This is pretty much what it should have said 😂
---
This was my opinion at first but then I thought back to what happened with RS3 and just voted no for that reason. RS3 it started small, harmless, and was 'good for the game' and it very quickly shifted into Squeel of Fortune, then into P2W squeel of fortune, then more OP promotions...etc. It happened so fast and I just don't want the same thing to happen to this game. Better safe than sorry.
---
Guess thisll never get resolved nice
---
Comment of the year for me, holy shit
---
Its a dude
---
Good job man
---
I imagine a little give and take. Jagex promotes partners from their platform through events and cosmetics, Twitch promotes RS streams off their platform, Apple or Google promotes the mobile app off their platforms, Nike sells rainbow boots irl.
---
&gt;As a community of frogs that have been boiled before, they realize we know when to hop out when it gets too hot.
---
Exactly! And the time is when Jagex adds time-gated cosmetics.
---
Like what, Squeal of fortune and loyalty on RS3? Or the Partnership that HAS ALREADY TAKEN PLACE IN OSRS with cosmetic rewards? Okay buddy.
---
Yeah, read my post history. I've tried to explain it, but it went as far as people going through my post history to downvote everything I said.
---
People in the sub are fucking retarded with very low concept of reality. Most people spend their time reaching for virtual achievements instead of the ones in real life, a lot of people don't and the realize what's going on but anyone that belongs to that category most likely doesn't care enough to voice their opinion
---
Yeah most companies would go out of business if *everyone* stopped buying what they were selling, but you're not gonna waltz up to EA and tell them you own them because you "fund their company."
---
If you left, hell, if 500 of us left, OSRS would still be there and Jagex would still be developing it. If Jagex left, that's the end of the game for everybody. 
---
So it's cool that they account for what players want. If they passed more updates without polling them, I bet the number of players that actually leave over it would be negligible. And I think Jagex deserves credit for the attitude they've taken on the subject, but it seems to me like a lot of people really take it for granted here.
---
It can be beneficial for a few things, mainly pking or wintertodt. And your hp level will rise with ranged and meele skills, no worries
---
Wow. You're optimistic giving it two summers. I'll give it till the new year.
---
What is the important part I’m leaving out? You can literally get all content
---
&gt; No company is stupid enough to shoot itself in the same foot twice. 
---
You don't know much about the games industry, do you? It's full of short-sighted decisions pushed by investors who demand constant corporate growth. You'd think Jagex would understand that overmonetization is killing RS3, yet not too long ago they tried to add a battlepass-like system on top of everything else. You'd think they'd back down from weekly treasure hunter promotions after outrage drove them to make a public statement apologizing for it and saying they'd back off, but they only did so for a while before ramping right back up. The trouble with investors is that they're often out of touch with the company.
---
&gt;There's no way in hell that Jagex wouldn't have used at least one of the cosmetic rewards for charity work in OSRS.
---
Let me be clear - nobody gives a damn who you think they might've partnered with. The only reason you're saying they might've partnered with SpecialEffects is so you could say anyone who opposes this idea is opposed to charity causes (which, again, is extremely disingenuous).
---
I don't even play, I just watch content and lurk reddit.
---
I feel like they know MTX will nuke the core playerbase, and are trying to grow profit through numbers, and numbers with more large ad pushes.
---
Without partnerships and their free advertising, $12 is coming.
---

Released free spins then added paid spins months later. The literal start of MTX in RS3 was untrustworthy as hell.

I completely agree with that, but I'm sure there are ways to integrate a partnership without implementing changes to the actual game. My main concern is that jagex can promise to poll things like this or mtx til they are blue in the face but once they sign a contract with a partner they are legally obligated to uphold their end of the contract and if that contract gives the partner enough power 2 impact changes that are implemented into the game then it could very well segue into MTX. If they polled a partnership that offered an extra week on to the free trial, a discounted membership, or even a free hat or some shit I might vote Yes, but I just cannot vote in favor of a partnership that gives any control over when or what is implemented into the game. That power should stay in their hands and their hands alone otherwise we will be up to our necks in shark fists and chrome glasses. Just my honest opinion.
---
The boss was designed for 100combats. It is definitely doable solo.
---
We don't deserve the quality of this art.
---
Meanwhile at RS3 we keep suffering for.you guys :(
---
I think what you mean to say is "A company trying to make more money NOW by sacrificing the integrity of their game and harming future profits by driving people away from the community." Why do you think they even listened to us and cancelled the poll? It's because they know it's less of a loss to just cut the partnerships now rather than upsetting 70% of the community and making them weary of every update to come.
---
You're right in principle, but I do think in the end you have to factor in if the owners/shareholders are looking for long term or short term profit. If they were to do what you claim then they would make more money in the short term but that would dry out and kill the game quickly, so they would overall make less money than if they were to try to make profits in other means that is healthy for the longevity of the game.
---
A sizable number of players just vote Yes on any new content.
---
Makes sense
---
Guthans bod pog
---
Why should we care about the most mild of things? It's a sign up bonus we get for free later, it's the sissiest tier of in-game marketing reward you could possibly have. It's absolutely not a big deal in the slightest, calling that "hot" is ridiculous.

Pray melee and stand in middle of room. Attack boss with crush. 
---
Boss will "hiss" and web you frozen for 3 seconds. When this happens prayer range and spam click boss.
---
You should be able to run right over to the boss, only praying against 1 range attack. Before reaching boss, protect melee because it will insta hit you when you run over to it after being webbed.

Minions spawn, pray range and go D scim (fast weapon) the blue mage, don't worry about melee.

I dont know. I dont think free cosmetics are the way forward. But I also dont think that OSRS will grow the playerbase by any substantial amount by simply "being good" and "making good updates"
---
https://i.imgur.com/nY9mBu0.jpg
---
I’d like to start off by saying if 4 years ago they introduced this very same poll. 90% +/-voting yes and 10% +/- on no would have been the result. 
---
We all know that osrs has been growing, but if you really think about it. We are the voice, the community majority... at the moment at least. As the population grows, our voice will be snuffed out by the majority that’s yet to come. The fact that almost 33% of the population voted yes just shows that we grew as a community and new players / “kids” don’t care about “nostalgia “ or have a history with jagex. 
---
I think if osrs keeps growing, eventually the numbers would be reversed and we would become to 33% as opposed to being the majority at the moment.
---
Its inevitable if the game grows. The game itself is built surrounding the community and if the communitys voice changes... then the game changes
---
Araxxi is a solo boss.
---
Its gonna be rs3 account if you do
---
I didn't want to admit it, but same...
---
For reference, I’m 109 combat and only 80 attack and 70 defense haha
---
Lol, Straightforward writing on the internet = angry, gotcha
---
Lol, ending the poll because of an extreme one-sided outcome, that's hilarious. I wanna see the results now. It'll look good and be a decent reference frame for future scenarios.
---
If I have to pay money to a partner of the game I like in order to access minor content in a game I already pay for, it is MTX, it just has more steps and a sly wording
---
Welp guess runescape is going to be fucking ruined as soon as I get back into it. I dont touch the game for 10 fucking years and come back to this.
---
They'll only listen if it confirms their uninformed bias.
---
I mean i have the third sensor and a huge space to play in. All the games just get boring after a while when you start to see the flaws.
---
Its ok to be angry but you gotta chill man
---
I should revise to just ironmen

Honestly I resubbed to osrs to prepare for AFK methods to play along side Classic. I dont think wow will hurt osrs to much

he pay more he say more

Dont you bgs vork then switch helmets?? (Never done it idk)
---
Are you a pker or?
---
b-b-b-but RS3 have instance boss fights and RS3 bad &gt;:(
---
No worries friend
---
do you really think the game isn't a better one without a player who makes actual death threats?
---
Not a native english speaker, i do believe most people got my intentions.
---
Go grab the collection log from Varrock Museum - that will keep you busy for basically an endless amount of time
---
Not really. A lot of people use the purple skin and I don't think "oh that's twitch prime right there!"
---
It's a timed exclusive that will be given for free shortly after. You guys are really stretching this out to be something it's not. Use your brain.
---
It's good that they're canceling the promotions and MTX for now, but I don't feel particularly good about any of this. This post is very passive aggressive.
---
Something strange is going on at Jagex. Mod Mat K leaves all of a sudden after working for the company for, what, 13 years? There's all this talk about changing the experience for new players so that the game becomes more accessible, even though every single player today learned things through the current systems in place.
---
Then there's the talk about Promotions and it just doesn't sit well with me. We may have won the battle, but not the war. Something is brewing behind the scenes.
---
I trust that they'll stick to what they say. Frankly I believe that the partnerships would've stayed just partnerships. I don't really buy that this is all a slippery slope toward MTX, but I trust that some RS3 players know what's going down better than I do.
---
Cosmetics or not, its still mtx
---
That wasn't their message though. They did listen, and state that they heard the message from the community - but they were also disappointed that nobody voted based on the content of the poll, but rather the fear of some sort of "slope" of microtransactions. 
---
It's a victory against those microtransactions entering the game, but the polling system takes a huge hit because if the community doesn't believe Jagex when they say they promise X content won't enter the game, then the entire polling system is defunct because polled content stems from trust that X content will enter the game if polled, and as polled. So by the same regards, Jagex probably just lost a huge interest in using polls for certain content if they can't get actual feedback on the polled content.
---
Good. While they have the best intentions, this is one of those steps that creates a path to going into everything that made RS3 terrible. Respect on them for keeping their word on the poll and for people voting against it.
---
Strange, considering the partnerships had no content locked behind anything - since it would eventually be released to all players. And cosmetics are not pay to win.
---
This does not sound like what Jagex is presenting us though, Jagex clearly has a desire to keep the game running.
---
RuneScape GO

You:

"YOU ARE A FUCKING PUSSY AND NEED YOUR FUCKING ASS BEAT BECAUSE MTX!"

Also you:

"Omg I cant believe how mad you are.. go get laid"

You may very well be the dumbest person I have ever spoken to in this community.

They didn’t succumb to anything. It would be impossible to pass at this point so that’s why they closed it - which is good.

They definitely could've restructured XP gains in early runescape to make it expansion friendly.  WOW forces you to buy expansions to get higher lvl by locking the xp.

You don't know the words you are saying.

Well... I don't know.

Honestly, make the membership $15 and fuck off with MTX and partnerships :D
---
I liked some of the ideas like POH themes but think they should be locked behind elite diaries for their respective regions etc.
---
&gt;Why should we care about the most mild of things?
---
Because it's the beginning.
---
It started with 1 purple skin, now they want 20+ more things. It'll only keep spiraling from there.
---
Burnt out rn. Enjoy the game! Spongebob memes are always good
---
Jagex added more and more mtx to rs3 gradually. It all starts with the little things.
---
It could be instanced without a fee to collect items. Even if you die now.. you don't lose anything, lol. You go back and pick it up.
---
Agree fully. 
---
I support the twitch prime membership promotion so much. A bunch of my friends got into the game because of that, so I would love to see more of it.
---
The prices are dropping because of the recent wildly slayer update and the large number of people doing wildly slayer. They won’t rise to what they were originally but they’ll level out before bottoming out as less people are checking out the new update.

comcast uses reddit for support as one of their avenues, and everything the client does is handled through reddit pms. i've used it. my power company can handle support strictly through twitter dms. verizon uses twitter dms for support too. blizzard has cs through twitter, and in some cases reddit. even the company i work at uses twitter dms for customer support, alongside other methods.

LMAO at you people saying you quit but yet you're still here browsing this sub. You haven't quit, you may not be playing right now, but you'll get sucked back in eventually. You don't simply quit RS.
---
Literally every single remaster in existence should fall under that, no?
---
Unless you specifically mean MMO, in which case classic WoW is the only one that was remotely substantially ever asked for, and it is being delivered. People asking for it to 'go back to the way it was' for a game that is still getting live updates is a sign of a very bad problem, not something you should praise companies for.
---
That's a pretty stupid response and doesn't encourage any discussion on the matter.
---
Always afking what i can due to work scheduale, rarely get desktop time player lol

because it takes time and resources-- something they're not willing to invest without monetary incentive// aka more important things to work on

Jagex is an example to what you just said, not an exception.
---
I love how in the Blogpost they underline "We promise". 
---
Bro, your promises don't mean shit after you destroyed the first version of this game and told us bonds would be the only form MTX like content in the game.
---
Hey bud. Did the player base vote those things in? Or did they do it because they could?
---
Probably because 90% of the people against it were uninformed, still are, and just follow the trend of the subreddit. The blog post today made it clear that they weren’t trying to do what everyone was accusing them of.
---
seems legit
---
You’re unfortunately probably right. I’m pulling for myself, though.
---
What gets me is that they do partnerships for advertising and whatnot all the time, and they already know we're adverse to'excusivity' like with holiday items. Release new PoH wallkits in celebration of an Ikea sponsorship for all I care, just don't timegate them behind a paywall.
---
What do you mean? They said they still want partnerships.
---
Or (hear me out here) keep that stuff in RS3?
---
OSRS doesn't need it at all. It's their most active and popular game and if they legitimately do NOTHING involving OSRS in any sort of promotions/MTX/cosmetics w/e you want to call it, the game will continue to just passively give respectable income. They're kicking a hornet's nest for some reason and don't need to be doing that. This was their most profitable year literally ever. Why try and scramble for more when it's unnecessary?
---
Those games have two vastly different communities though, and those players spend their time on completely different things.
---
If nobody currently wants to play castle wars, nobody is going to suddenly want to play castle wars - even with your ideas of unique variances to the gamemodes and what-not. The majority of players on this game play new content and efficient content. They would have to do the event starting with new content (IE. Release of a minigame, first week is sponsored). 
---
Also that does not net advertisers any guarantee of any sort of CTA - so there isn't really an interest by them. If a company sponsored a castle wars event, people would play it for a day maybe, but nobody is going to really care who the sponsor is, thus netting them low profits or user interest from the event itself.

I dont want this for Andrew and Paul. They should be wished good luck in their future endeavours. I hope Ian gets well rewarded for his work too.
---
Make it so that players are Ironmen or implement a trade limit (never thought that system would be good for something), so that players can't trade expensive gear.
---
Arguably if there is content you can’t get without paying for it, then that’s part of the full game too.
---
Not saying OSRS needs MTX but just arguing for the sake of argument
---
Big of you to admit. That’s nice to see. :)
---
I prefer the Runecape design actually. While Runescape still has a ton of "dead content" (Which is inevitable after 12 years of consistent updates), Runescape is still alot more varied in what you can do compared to something like WoW.
---
If anything I would prefer if anything, that they would increase the subscription fee with a promise of new content, hire a dedicated team to create larger content drops while another team works on smaller updates to keep people playing.
---
Though raising cost with the promise of future updates isnt exactly sustainable either, as alot of people will probably not be willing to pay upfront for something they get later
---
Capes don’t have sizes at all though ...?
---
YES! This is something that EVERYONE would be a fan of. Screw Mt. Drew brews in game I want a real life Sara brew
---
Just because the subreddit is important doesn't mean the majority of users use it?
---
Of course the people who care the most and are most active are on the subreddit, that doesn't mean that everyone does
---
As long as they get paid, and we don’t have to pay anything. Free items good.

Wasnt being rude, just being real. The devs are just a mouth piece, they didnt write this. Sween was told what to write and he did as he was told. When you praise this post you aren't showing support for the devs we love, you are reaffirming the owners of the company that their community will suck any kind of shit they feed us then and thank them for it. Support the devs on their twitters, we are in the midst of a P.R. war right now
---
So you think all the partnerships would free just like the twitch one?
---
Cosmetics should show that you have accomplished something in game not subscribed to some company and then become completely free to every one because then it’s pointless.
---
wut. he has a tortue and dboots. the rest of his armor is free. what makes him rich?
---
Lets not argue the fact of whether or not these are mtx or not. Lets talk about how voting no to this encourages them to try and make money elsewhere. Meaning they might increase membership or say fuck the playerbase and add harmful mtx. 
---
Voting yes to this would have allowed jagex to make money in harmless ways meaning that they wouldnt look for harmful ways to make money like they did in rs3.
---
And make more bots? Yeah hard pass.
---
Bonds are more expensive than membership and people already purchase them with mommy's credit card. Bonds make them more money
---
That interrupts the DAE EA BAD posting, though
---
Just to clarify jagex doesn’t want to add mtx that affect gameplay at all(: this subreddit responds like trump supporters to a liberal
---
If the concept of the game is the same, altering small changes to the minigame that way wouldn’t drive a lot of people to the minigame. Rewards are usually what motivates people in playing minigames majority of the time. Look at all the minigames in games that lack rewards compared to minigames that don’t (e.g. pest control, barb assault, bh, barrows vs castlewars, lms, trouble brewing)
---
I was only mentioning MTX as that was the main source of panic throughout the subreddit, as if they were on the cusp of being added. I still think the exact definition of it is a little bit of a grey area as well, with your given definition seeming to be the one Jagex is using.
---
Uhm sry im not that up to date with this as im currently on vacation, but can some1 send a link to the jegex post? thanks
---
It’s your vote but don’t have a tiff cause you didn’t get your way.
---
The Chinese bought jagex for 350m, and there is something like 150k active players, if we get 100k to invest 3.5k average. we could get it.
---
So...... LETS BUY JAGEX

This might come as a surprise, but some people leave companies because they don't like the way things are run, and want to be in a position to do things differently. Company culture doesn't always follow the employee.
---

---
I was wondering if others got that vibe too
---
I can feel the pain in this comment
---
Honestly, they know that Ash is one of the only mods as a community we collective trust. That is mostly because of his dedication and passion for the game. 
---
However, that being said a lot Mods who were against MTXs were let go recently.
---
&gt;Along side this note if you managed to catch player A every time but B/C teleport away without you getting a chance to attack where does this lie? 
---
I don't think this is even a realistic enough scenario to even consider to be honest. It would be virtually impossible for everyone but one person to consistently teleport away every time. I'm sure jagex would be able to tell that this is happening. It might happen once or twice, but not repeatedly over many days.
---
&gt;Little side question as well if we turn the tables: with 2k total worlds they’re locked down, if I log into them start attacking the revs and then cowkiller1337 (#rot) logs in and kills me. Okay fair enough, I go back maybe onto a different 2k total world and rinse repeat..
---
For one, you wouldn't be attacked by just one player. In this case it's pretty obvious they're attacking basically everyone. In the same sense that they don't attack their clanmates, they can choose to not attack protected players.
---
AFAIK these players that pay for protection get put into a clan chat. It's not as if they're ignoring random people in the eyes of jagex. Because of this, there's realistically only so many players that can be protected at once. You will not be the only player they are killing. That means it is not targeted.
---
Locking down rev world's requires by definition killing everyone that is not a part of your clan/paid for protection. It would be very clear that there is not 1 sole person they are targeting.
---
but she has ancestral..
---
How are you still perusing the matter? STOP IT. STOP. WE'RE NOT INTERESTED. STOP.
---
Kieren even said you guys would drop it. if the polls failed. They failed. Now stop.
---
Btw did you realize we want you to stop? Just in case you didn't notice.
---
Stop.
---
Jagex didn’t have to listen because their intentions did not change after the backlash. They had to take the time out of their day to explain to this dense subreddit that they’re not turning this game into rs3. This community is full of people who have anxiety because they spend 8 hours a day on this game lol
---
I was thinking about making some drawings of pop figures!
---
Literally just sold off my pk accounts lol
---
That's no one's fault. It's called RISK VS REWARD. No one forced you to fight wilderness bosses.
---
go take a look at wow and how 'juuuust cosmeeeetix' MTX completely devalued the actual time and effort people sunk into mount or achievement farming that distinguished them from other people. This is what you want for osrs.
---
Except you can buy bonds from Jagex for real money, and resell to other players, so you can buy gp with real money...
---
I quit RS2 not long after dungeoneering first launched, so I never saw the MTX slippery slope and I was planning to vote yes to all of it. Until I saw the posts showing how RS3 devs were literally stating MTX would never be added. Then they would only be cosmetic. Then they just said fuck it and went all in. Maybe the OSRS team was being sincere and really wouldn't add anything beyond this, but why take the chances really.
---
Bboomer Clap

RIP bro i feel you
---
Credit where credit is due, well done team
---
Anyone else feel the saltiness of this post? They're still set with partnerships which annoy the heck out of me. They tone they used is so defensive, bolding and underlining "This is why we promised" as if they've not broken their fucking promises before. Take the L, Jagex, nobody wants your stupid partnerships.
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Gonna preface this with sorry if this is illegible or seems to run all over. 
---
Well, I'd agree with you if osrs was in terrible shape but it's not. The players ultimately decide if the game is going to die or not. As community driven as osrs is it would honestly be a bad move to put something in that wasn't polled because they knew it wouldn't pass. 
---
Fukong no longer owns Jagex. They turned over $100 million in revenue last year, 99.5% of Fukong's entire revenue for the year itself. A year-to-year profit increase of 51%! The game is in amazing shape. Turning record high yearly profits over the past few years back to back.
---
Tldr; Jagex isn't stupid and doesn't want to fuck up their cash cow. Don't be afraid of partnerships.
---
obviously golden pegasus
---
You obviously didn't either because they didn't say they removed partnership stuff, just that it won't be ever added without a poll.
---
Because I don't want the game feeling like an advertisement. With these things, the game feels less and less pure, like it did back when we were kids. I know that the game obviously needs to change in order to survive, but this ain't it chief.
---
We paid.
---
We say'd.
---
And they obeyed!!!
---
Checking in. I would much rather do Vorkath which is much easier.
---
Theres nothing wrong with changing stuff that failed to try and get it to pass. Just keep voting no on anything that scares you. Its not about never adding mtx, its about never adding it without player permission through polls.
---

Well if you based your thoughts on this subreddit you'd probably think only like 10-20% would've voted yes, but all of the people who wanted it or didn't care either kept silent or were downvoted.  
---
*If* things were exactly as they discussed in the blog, then I think it could've possibly passed - there's nothing wrong with what's been proposed.  But it's a slippery slope, and we've already seen things go south fast on RS3 so of course we're going to be on the safe side and vote no.
---
RS3 and OSRS are run by different teams, I guess Jagex treats them both as 2 different projects. RS3 is older and already has MTX, so my guess is  it remains the guinea pig for MTX...
---
Bad bot
---
Yeah worry about yourself, Jagex was up to there shady bullshit again.
---
This is a big part of it.. I don't play as much as I'd like but I still saw people making off hand comments about the poll multiple times.
---
They’re trying to make profit for the investors. They can only do that by bringing in new subs, or mtx.
---
We just want the status quo (organic users from making a good game).
---
I don't think I'd really mind jagex working on partnerships to help bring in new players I think they should just be more clear about what it would mean for the game in the future. I'd definitely like them to try again with some form of partnership that wouldn't give mtx style stuff.
---
Hit the nail on the head, exactly bro
---
With 80m u can invest in new stuff. 80m can become 500m+ fast if you invest well. Money makes money
---
It's also the fact that they're shitty rewards. Nobody wants to do some grandmaster quest and have one of the rewards be an elf themed home teleport that they will never use, or an elf themed house that nobody will see but themselves.
---
Damn this is good
---
The memes were good, but this is much better.
---
Jagex, thank you &lt;3
---
Like when you say “don’t touch my mustache” or “eat a duck we must” in place of Japanese.. I think the first is your welcome and the second is like a “let’s eat” they say before group meals.

---
and by that logic, you can argue that you can buy membership from Jagex for real money, and use that to buy herb boxes and battlestaves; ergo,
---
buying gp with real money
---
swapping a membership token with another player for GP is not the same as buying GP directly from Jagex
---
Completely unplayable
---
They're looking for something they can include in marketing materials. Have you ever watched a youtube video sponsored by a game, where they're like "download it now and use promocode {youtuber name} to get a thousand gold and unlock {thing}"? It's a limited or bonus *something* that they can offer to motivate people to take action. 
---
It's like how they offered free membership on Twitch Prime. I personally hadn't played RS in years, but when I saw a free month of membership, I was like "oh cool, I'll see if I can still log in!" and somehow Jagex got a year of membership out of me.
---
The type of partnership they're talking about is where OSRS is advertised on other platforms. Do you think "play a twitch themed minigame for no rewards" is going to entice you to try out a game anywhere near as much as "get free/exclusive stuff"?
---
That said, I would have voted no on all questions this weekend when I read "at a later date" because what if I want to make a Swampletics clone and need my house to be moritainia themed, and three months after it got released, I can't pick it up on the new account?
---

I'll look it over. Good to know the company is doing well though overall. I just hope they don't expect that kind of growth constantly.
---
Breaking the game yet again
---
Jojos is lit as fuck you’re wack man
---
So suppose they create great new content but propose it locked behind a partnership. “New BIS off hand” or whatever used solely to try and sway the community to agree on partnerships. You think that this is a generally healthy practice for developer-player relations? They said it’s the most miserably failed poll ever why devote time and resources to passing it in the future anyway?

You wouldn't *need* to pay microtransactions as a current osrs player, you'd need to wait a month. They'll probably keep doing promos anyways, but just give out some membership time. The free cosmetic was to look more tempting.
---
&gt; to what they could have genuinely viewed as non-MTX deals
---
  I'm not sure how they could have failed to anticipate that "buy shit from our sponsors (ahem, "partners") and get early access to content" wouldn't flop horribly with the community as a paper-thin disguise for MTX. I'm really hoping that this whole idea came down from the higher ups because if anyone from the primary mod team thought this was a good idea it means the mods are horribly out of touch with their players.
---
Absolutely correct, partners with timed exclusives? Hmmmmm no

I for one would love to buy a swampletics action figure as a collectible item.

---
All those focus groups they held were specifically for discussing mtx and partnerships it seems
---
They're just a chatroom in this game, there's no tangible benefit to joining one in this game like you might expect in other MMOs. They're mainly a social hangout for players with similar goals like PvPing/Raiding/Socializing and lets players find other people to play with.
---
That's what I meant, harmless. If they were giving out free "new item" that hits 40s, that would be hatmful
---
Not wanting does not mean incapable of separating, I appreciate the concern however I assure you I am not looking for sympathy. Simply explaining my perspective and many others than did vote no. I suggest looking up the dictionary meaning for want/yearning and comparing it to "incapable of separating feelings about something if it might come to pass". Here's a clue, one suggests dislike of something, while the other is an inability to make a distinction between two things.
---
Hope that helped.
---
you don't think they'd broadcast when an event will start? i mean the goal is to get as much exposure as possible right, they're ads. it's absolute nonsense to pay 11$ for a game a month and still walk around in ads. what is this? old school black mirror?
---
are those cooking gauntlets? you misogynistic pig
---
No I don’t want any MTX/ads in the game. But jagex is gonna add this shit in regardless so mine as well try and come up with something that is decent
---
She probably goes to a different school
---
I know what it means, I just don't agree with it.
---
those items cost money, and they dont even make shit off of the stuff they do have.  Like i would buy a hoodie with my rsn on it (like the one rswillmissit has but they dont do that shit unless you are a streamer invited to runefest) even if it cost $100, but the profit margins on that are slim every all the hassle to make it.
---
More RuneScape meme related clothing would be nice. I have no shame and would totally be a walking billboard in public for them.

Buying an item to trade for in-game currency.

---
How the fuck do you miss the point this badly? I'm saying cosmetics are *supposed* to be prestigious. This poll is the opposite of that.
---
Unlike most, I read through a lot of the cosmetics upgrades and, honestly, some were cool. Maybe we can open a discussion on adding some more ornament kits and pet opportunities? I know these were polled content questions, but the idea intrigues me. RS3 gets tons of well deserved criticism for MTX. Let's not go there. BUT I do love earnable cosmetic content? Maybe those partners want to sponsor content development, such as raids 3, and so you make a post saying "Amazon would like to sponsor the introduction of raids 3. Thus, if you complete 1k raids, you can now get an amazonian ornament kit for the new top tier drops from raids 3". No money spent on it, no MTX, but kind of a win for everyone?
---
They don't even fit, I got em cuz they look cool
---
which do you earn? the daily herb boxes, the points that you AFK for, or the free teleports to the rewards chest?
---
What? You have no idea what you're talking about...
---
It's literally a dieing game.
---
Yeah, because ads are revolutionary and do not exist elsewhere.
---
Also, advertising your own product is mandatory. What the fuck did you expect? And that $11 won't be enough to cover operating costs soon.
---
i feel like a learned something about jagex with this post. And i dont feel good about it. "Sry you nerds didnt like the poll we'll try again in a few months with different words"

Nah just drunk ranting

---
Pretty much everyone that got twitch prime for the purple skin got it for free
---
Certain toys or collectibles can be made in China for cheap AF and sold at very very high profit margins. The point is to expand their merch store which currently is absolute shit.
---
Yeah, you can't really negotiate with a poll, and you'll be hard pressed to get cynical voters to give free reign to a negotiator. And nobody wants to negotiate with someone who doesn't have the authority to follow through.
---
funny enough you do get usually 2 super rare cosmetics youd never get otherwise. the twitch things give purely cosmetics and free membership
---
“Even as much as people hated EoC, it passed a poll to be implemented” 
---
I asked to see the poll, and you linked a survey about players that mentioned eoc was already scheduled to release. Where is the fucking player poll bro? I DONT SEE IT.

Not sure what you're referring to, I mean OSRS team hasnt screwed us over. I cant the same for Jagex as a whole

They can do partnerships with out offering in game content.

Partnerships with membership is fine. Time it with the release of new earnable cosmetics or new updates or whatever but don't lock stuff behind the partnership even if it's temporary.

im guessin u watched that episode last night too
---
Let me lead with everytime I'm going to reference 'devs', I mean 'most devs', and I mean, from my experience... Devs are passionate, and they know how to make the game better, and they know what they would do to make the game better in a vacuum, but they don't live or work in that environment. They do what they have to get a paycheck. Devs that get too passionate about a project work terribly in teams, extremely overwork themselves, and don't get personal reward from it. Devs get tasks, they do the tasks. Higher devs make and approve low-risk tasks, and higher ups make demands and tell devs to 'make something work'. 
---
It's a job. Sure, it's a job about a topic that they like, but the chance you get a job on the game you specifically want to work on, are good at it, are passionate, and given the opportunity to actually make impactful decisions is extremely rare and far between.
---
Honestly, this should be given more time. Of course people reacted strongly, this seemed like the start of something big and bad. We only really saw the negative opinions on this, and so I, too, voted no. Now, though, I'm not so sure, and perhaps even regret my quick decision. As the partnership rewards would only be temporary AND cosmetic, it honestly wouldn't make my life any different. As long as partnerships stay benign like this, I could gladly live with them.
---
So.. what do you think the purpose of getting more players into the game is?

&gt;Eoc was never polled, it was only given beta testings to the community.
---
If you read the link I so kindly sent you, you will see that it was indeed polled and in that poll it passed with 80% positivity. They planned on reverting the change if it didn't have support.
---
Again, you are an idiot.
---
&gt;Again, you failed to say the “player made content” and you failed to link the “eoc poll”. You’re an angry shill who doesn’t want to be wrong. I at least admitted the possibility of being wrong about the eoc poll, you’re just a intellectually dishonest inbred

&gt;Besides just for the lols to show how dishonest you are, the shit you linked me starts off by saying there’s already a launch date for eoc. So they’re clearly not polling if when its already being added you dumb fuck LMAOOOOOOOOO
---
There's a launch date since that was the **2nd** beta that got positive feedback. 
---
I said it a few times, but I'll reiterate. You are *legitimately* retarded. You can't read simple sources I send you and even worse is that you act like an authority on things that you **didn't even participate in**. You are without a shadow of a doubt the worst type of player and a truly stupid person down to a genetic level. Quit the game, you are only a danger to it.
---
Cerb lurker here. What's wrong with c hally? I have hit a 99 and I've only been there for 100 kills. What gives that dds is better.
---
I thought ‘yellow skin’ was blatantly offensive, even though Jagex probably didn’t realize how problematic that skin color would be and how players could abuse that to make fun of or discriminate against a race or make stereotypes.
---
My favourite kind especially about those Estonians coming here and taking our cocktail sausages and pesto chicken bites. Makes me want to puke up several crustaceans from the paleolithic era.

Poopoo homo Obama penis
---
Sounds like something an MTX apologist would say
---
That level 60 will still have to deal with whatever is polled in the future in the same way a maxed character will have to deal with low-level content if they ever start another account. Why should something that WILL affect them be something they can't vote for or against?
---
Actually you do have a say, if they feel that the players don't mind this kind of thing they're more inclined to implement more aggressive forms of MTX.  If they realize a sizeable majority of players firmly don't want even the most innocent form of MTX, they'll think twice about trying to add anything else.

Huh thank you so much for that, I never saw that. Thank you.

If the double XP is bought by jagex, it is an ingame benefit you get by paying jagex extra real life money. This makes it an MTX without a doubt. If the double XP is bought as a token, which could be traded with other players, this is indeed still MTX. 
---
If the twisted bow was spawned by jagex for you when you bought it, yes absolutely, that is MTX. If you are buying "something" from jagex, which then can be traded for another players twisted bow, this is not necessarily MTX. This depends on what youre buying from jagex, and then trading. If it´s an "actual item" in game, then its mtx. If it´s just a membership token, then the item is basically "real money", and therefore it would be "jagex fascilitated RWT". The key difference here is no "item" is being spawned by jagex, but rather tradeable membership(IRL money).
---
No that is not my logic.. A MTX is when you pay money to jagex, which directly spawns an actual "ingame item" for you. With an actual IN GAME use. (Look at bonds, their "actual use" is not in game, but rather redeem for real monitary value)
---
For what? Killing additional community growth over a partnership that you guys don't understand?
---
Nowhere did I imply that they have never done/will never add things without polling them, but I'd rather not have you miss the point a third time so I'm done trying. Bye lol
---
sick health problem gains. you probably look like my nutsacc on a really cold day
---
What are your combat stats?
---
Makes sense, i used to like the cb system and solo bossing there but i got turned off when too many mtx started coming and when they changed the graphics of every items in game for idk how many times they changed it
---
Lots of people enjoy rs3 because it is easyscape and that you can "pay to win" in some ways but they wont say it out loud
---
They didnt poll the players on the issue in rs3 and the consequence was a massive drop in players. Hopefully theyve learned to not be as aggressive and dismissive of the players
---
There are shareholders that will happily squeeze a company for short term profit and then quickly sell their stocks. Not sure if Jagex is owned by these types, but they exist.
---
This has more mechanics than some higher level content. Would also favor max mains over mid levels because of the very punishing mechanics (though the point of barrows is the be mid level...). Would not make sense. Your suggestion is interesting, but feels over the top. 
---
Nice rune crossbow tho
---
Lol, do you know what your username is?
---
Like you fucking idiots would actually quit.
---
If I didn’t read the blog about partnerships I probably would’ve voted yes.
---
I'm talking about player growth, not content growth
---
this sounds worst then just offering a timegate cosmetic.  Partnership dont last forever, so are you saying to have time limited quests?  I could only imagine the crying on here from that.  Also no partner is going to go near DMM or any other pvp content, its not what people on osrs care about, DMM doesnt pull shit for views and it only pulls views of current players, the aim is to attract a new pool of people to keep new players coming into the game.
---
Once they decide it's not enough they will find worse ways to make money as you saw in rs3.... 
---
Interestingly specific attack. Does that maybe resemble your life and you're upset about it? Lmao
---
Were you this upset over twitch partnership and the cosmetics it introduced? Or are you just spouting off what everyone else in this circle jerk is saying
---
You’re killing more in the tunnels than you should, you’re getting bolt racks
---
And Reddit time traveled to future so they know these partnerships will lead to Treasure hunter and Solomon's store getting added?
---
im only friendly to people that make content that's something other than meme sound effects
---
You must have not read the original post by Jagex. The stated that these sponsors wouldn’t be “Wal-Mart and Pepsi” or in your example, Mountain Dew. I also think Jagex is far more creative than NBA2k in this aspect. Sure, they’ll have a nod to the sponsor, but, at least imo, in a far more creative way than logo dropping on their beautiful game.
---
To be honest this would only be needed for Bloat which has stupid high magic defence. So you still wouldn't use it against Bloat. 10% of hp as max hit would mean you hit an average of 5%, which degrades as you kill the target. Doesn't sound all that op tbh.
---
They didn't poll it because obviously it wasn't to pass a poll. They did it because they don't care
---
Luck
---
I'm assuming you're making use of the slippery slope argument, right? Because that seems a very dramatic speech over orange skins and swamp houses
---
This. 
---
There was outcry on Reddit to vote no by people who think MTX was going to come from this. The ignorant people who dont understand what it even is all flock to the polls to vote no.
---
Guarantee more than 50% of the no's didn't even read the blog, or understand partnerships. 
---
You like mobile? That was because of a partnership.
---
Are you serious? The entire post was a defensive rant on why we voted badly. Not falling for that shit again lol.
---
You do understand they can add whatever the fuck they want to the game regardless of what we say, correct? I.E. Twitch partnership/bonds
---
There is literally no way that Jagex would stop there, they would add more and more, and the cosmetics would become increasingly unacceptable. Honestly mate, the EXACT same thing happened with RS3, the exact same promises that it wouldn’t ever be more than just this one event, it would just be cosmetic, etc.
---
What, 13 (I think) cosmetics for one promotional event? Something even Sween said wasn’t an appropriate use of development time outside of a promotional.
---
Im not saying scythes GP value would decrease because an item looked cooler than it, I’m saying the entire sense of achievement from having it would be devalued
---
I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be a.runescape not e.runescape
---
Yes no new players should have access to anything cool until they have put hundreds of hours into the game. That's exactly how you draw new players
---
Lol. You fucking people are pathetic.
---
I finally got around to taking WoW seriously during Warlords of Draenor, and I got my first max level character in 100 or so hours. Not sure how long it takes to max a skill, but it feels a lot longer in RS.
---
This actually made me want to cry a little bit. It just goes to show how this company truly cares about its player base. Take note EA.
---
I dont get it.
---
Thank you jagex. Thank you.
---
Anti-crashing your alt using granite cballs is big flex
---
I actually laughed. Thank you for this
---
Agreed. Why force in rewards.
---
wat u mean?
---
Depends on your opponents defense. Most training monsters have very low defense so accuracy isn't much concern.
---
Accuracy decides if you will 'hit' or 'miss'. A 'miss' is a 0. A 'hit' is a random number between 0-max hit. If your opponent has 0 defense then you will very rarely get a 'miss' no matter your attack level, so raising your attack is not as beneficial as raising your max hit.
---
All my monthly progress is e. which is why I assumed it was legit =)
---
Yeah, don’t think anyone using this meme format actually cares about the reality of stock holdings.
---
Of course the easyscape lovers wont just come out loud and yell on the roofs about it but instead they stay hidden in the closet
---
But i see the points of many of them that they like the combat system and bossing. Cant just put everyone in the same boat
---
A summary of your response... "If players are strongly against mtx they won't add it"
---
Which is just wrong.
---
I dont. People characterized it that way and meme'd it out of hatred. 
---
They did state they were disapointed though, which is not the same.

Jokes on Chad. Got catfished by a dude.

---
The problem I have with these solutions is it could make certain parts of the game feel like a bunch of big advertisements. Normally people do not like seeing things advertised in a piece of media they're already paying for (in the case of paying members).
---
After all, half of the reason I hate MTX in rs3 is just the fact that it's advertised everywhere. Advertising partnered companies would be even worse.
---
...At what point did they say there will be a level requirement? You're simply assuming that, in receiving the benefits of the partnership, you won't automatically have access to it in game. Thats not how Jagex operates. Other than the purple skin cosmetics are tied to actual content in game. The house skins have had no mention of having a construction/quest requirement. 
---
You are assuming that there will be a construction requirement with no basis for that assumption. The purple skin and rs3 chests were immediately available. I recieved an ahrims hood from one chest without the defense level to wear it and I have never done barrows on the account. Before you say "oh thats just rs3" its the same company, same investors and they've already snuck mtx into oldschool in the form of bonds. 
---
They just changed owners last month and immediately we are met with an mtx push. The last partnership was with twitch last summer I believe and it did have a negative effect. It led to this recent blog. They only saw a minor blowback from the twitch partnership and saw the oppourtunity to sneak more mtx in through other partners.
---
No matter what your stance on the mtx is we should be pressuring Jagex to be as transparent as possible so we know exactly what the partnerships entail. The blog was poorly written and didn't describe the situation very well. The poll questions were so bad they had to add extra clarifications 2 days into the poll.
---
Umbral chest is just a guaranteed maximum rarity treasure hunter. Usually it's a "lucky" item (untradable version of mid/high tier weapon or armor, like godswords or chaotics), but sometimes it's 200m or something else.
---
Everyone knows you can get your toy only after you finish eating!
---
/u/jagexsween $11 a month and we cant even get the right got damn green pixel?????
---
Spawning a direct item is only one type of MTX, fool. 
---
If you’re buying bonds for currency you’re doing nothing any different from any game people refer to as plagued by MTX where you can buy both the best items and buy currency so that you literally don’t have to do anything to have the best items. 
---
If it grants you the damned ability to gain millions of gold “which most people buy them for” it’s literally NO different. 
---
End of discussion.
---
&gt;Why would we ever need a partnership reward to make our houses Morytania themed? 
---
With all the popularity of Swampletics on YouTube bringing in new or returning players, Jagex thought, "It's a perfect time, ride the hype wave, let players feel like they're a part of the most popular RS series on YouTube - Morytania house skin. And make it tied to partnerships so we profit off it." In all honesty, if partnerships were ever introduced, it is Settled himself that should take 20% of whatever profit is made from people signing up for third party services, not Jagex.
---
Twitch promo also happened on osrs, my dude. One free month of membership and purple skin.
---
Winners*
---
Goddamn, this is good shit. Stellar work!
---
Thanks for the input. Sounds like I need to focus on slayer for a little while (68 right now). May also burst dust devils off task just to expedite magic a bit.
---
These people all just crave validation from their peers. Jumping on the bandwagon and saying things like "We did it!@@! we did it!@" gives them a false sense of accomplishment. 
---
They're clueless. I have not seen one decent argument against partnerships. Just a bunch of assumptions, conspiracy theories and paranoia.
---
RS3 makes me want to puke.
---
Ah, that would explain why its a staple of so many different bosses that are weak to crush
---
I believe several pets have that feature
---
Not necessarily an infinite bank, but it can send a limited number of items to bank and loot things off the ground, among other things
---
Kc?
---
Agreed. Poor wording.
---
It's not disingenuous because a lot of people do it, and it's important to note that the Troll task does work on the NMZ trolls because there's also a lot of people who don't know about that. 
---
I didn't mention Dharok because it wasn't mentioned in your comment either so I didn't feel like bringing it up, also I'm honestly not sure how Dharok compares vs. BiS melees. I'm not too sure but I think BiS melee is about the same as Dharok or slightly better but Dharok is better than BiS melee if you swap styles bc one of the troll bosses is weak to crush and/or if you bring BiS melee for Claw specs.
---
How tf did I end up in r/gaming?
---
It's the highest rarity of a treasure hunter reward. It's only guaranteed when you use an umbral chest, that you get from the promo
---
Is your attack vs their defense directly correlated with the frequency of landing a hit? 
---
As in a 99 att vs 99 def would hit at the same rate as a 1 att vs 1 def?
---
This is the best crossover meme ever
---
Yeah, that partnership was great because it basically gave free membership to a lot of people who already had Amazon prime, thus bringing in tons of people who wouldn't have hopped on otherwise.  
---
I'm completely Ok with sponsorships that give members in exchange for buying some other service (should be significantly more expensive to discourage botters from abusing it).  Sponsorships that give cosmetics are not okay.
---
Might not be "the point", but it is a fact.
---
You were not right.
---
Purple skin was exclusive to twitch prime users for a number of months.
---
But why even settle on that? They're making record profits as is and we pay monthly subscriptions

Yah dude I cry, glad you atleast got some lulz out of it. Like I said I was tired and in a thousand years I wouldn't have thought some one was trying to lure in such a manner and hoping that some one would go into the wildy of the same combat level without food or teleport. The stars aligned and sure they got a couple of mil this time but I rather would have lost double the money and kept my helmet.

---
That explains what the hoop snakes are for! I've never actually ventured into the swamp before, so I had no idea. 
---
I will have to take a look into how to do this, thanks. I am not too fussed about lowered xp or fossils per hour, if it means I don't die!
---
Alright, bring out the crabs boys
---
Before you start making blanket accusations. I did not state my opinion yet. I just asked a question. But I'm glad you cleared that up. 
---
"I would rather osrs die then see monetization come to it's shores"
---
Without increase revenue for the game, the game wont have anywhere to grow. No new Jmods will come to the team because there is no funding for them, they already dont get paid much, they do it for the clout and because they enjoy the game and want to have an impact on that. No partnerships means no exposure. While I stand firm saying game-impacting MTX is bad. There are other ways to increase revenue and thus grow the game, its supporters and the people behind it. Not to mention MTX was not the sole reason RS3 "died". EOC was a huge part of it, hence how old school was founded.
---
Which is why I ask the question. "How do you suggest OSRS further monetizes itself to help grow and support itself"
---
It's fake bud, I know...
---
...
---
F.
---
Well you lost already, the poll is closed and it lost by a landslide :P
---
No I’m proposing full length quests, with shout outs to potential long term sponsors. Some sponsorships / partnerships do last for ever.... that’s why they are called partnerships that an advertisement. 
---
Also DMM brings in tons of views. Maybe not new viewers, because the way old school is designed it’s hard to attract a new audience with a poorly designed tournament. The DMM tournament I guess was a bad idea, as I didn’t think of its impact on gaining new players rather than the views it actually pulls in.
---
Partnerships already exist. Does purple skin really bother you that much in game?
---
🦀🦀Jamflex does something not horrible for once🦀🦀

Parallel universes?
---
They should offer starter kits as an ingame reward to twitch prime users, or whatever. They've offered membership through this which has ingame value via bonds. Including 200k in common items (d long, berserker helm, rune plate, etc.) would get new players started and working towards a goal. You could make them untradable for 12 hours of playtime if that's a concern (but this would only be given to players subscribed to something else, so it isn't unlimited).
---
Thing is mate just from what you're saying I can tell you've likely never set foot in rs3. The mtx isn't all that much "in your face" people like to exaggerate. 
---
As for encouraging them I don't see what you mean? I play the game and dont spend irl cash. It's really not that hard if you have more than half a brain cell. Now, please go back to the primordial soup where you belong.
---
To much characters to be an RSN, exposed buddy.
---
That’s why I’m proposing it could be an incentive for Jagex to create desired content as a tradeoff for us allowing them to take partnerships.
---
Don't use them or buy them with irl money so yes.
---
Shit quality.

The problem is we have no idea what kind of partnerships are going to happen. We don't want paywalls with more steps. The Twitch Partnerships are viewed differently because they are so intricately linked with gaming. Although even they have had negative impacts on the game because giving free membership has boosted the power of people who are trying to cheat.
---
It's amazing to me that you guys still think they were opening an MTX shop where you can spend money.
---
Maybe.
---
no. blessed dhide and ahrims is better in most cases
---
I always dreamed about having my own set of barrows  action figurines.
---
Jagex pls
---
Yep. That might have been his best episode to date. In my opinion at least. I watched it a second time last night and just beyond fucked how far off in the deep end some of these companies have gone. Then you have that Matt Bilbey guy who "struggles with the perception that EA are the bad guys". I bet the CEO at Jagex struggles to understand how he wasn't able to sell us his mediocre grade bullshit.
---
Okay?
---
People have been asking for this for years, it is just an unfortunate timing
---
It requires less attention
---
at the very least bonds dont generate gold into the economy. they actually sink coins when players make them tradeable.
---
No more than I already said the concept of paying money for cosmetics already does. I am not up in arms with rage over its existence, I simply do not like it and if it was polled I would've voted against it like I voted against the options just polled.
---
I find it hilarious that they even *want* to introduce MTX. Like do they not understand why OSRS is the more popular game? 
---
They pretty much just said, "Hey players, do you want to ruin the game yet so we can profit more?" Like fuck off.
---
I'm sorry you didn't get your swampletics house at the cost of starting down a slippery slope of microtransactions
---
Give us OSRS lego!
---
So just the AFKness to it, especially the 2nd floor?
---
do I just suck at combat? I stopped doing hard+ clues because I die to both of them...
---
its not like i like your infernal cape or anything! b..baka!
---
It's not about what you individually would pay, it's about the community as a whole. Current subs are used to grandfathering, new subs aren't invested enough for full price considering general perception of the game.
---
When will weebs all migrate to Japan? TRUMP, GET ON IT!
---
The cosmetics that were polled were all free. I would vote no if they polled ones behind a paywall
---
Compared to candy crush and clash of clans that'd really freaking pathetic
---
Yea basically. AFKness vs reward is a major balancing factor for a lot of content
---
&gt; do you mean that they were not clear enough that the cosmetic items would be tied to paid services on other sites?
---
  That's exactly what people are most upset about. They just said that it was early access to cosmetic content tied through their partners. What they conveniently left out in the poll questions is that *accessing that content involves purchasing products or services through those partners*. The word for that isn't "partners". The word for that is **"sponsors"**. Passing MTX through a 3rd party doesn't make it not MTX. Paywalling content that exists in game but is only accessible by paying for it IS introducing microtransactions, no matter how they try to sanitize it.
---
I agree. I think house designs based on all of the kourend houses would be really easy to implement with further storyline quests. The entire continent could still use a fair bit of content. The elven design would be really nice to get with ASotE as well.
---
I couldn't care less about the skins and I'm pretty indifferent to the home tele animations. Id probably still use the cow anyway.
---
Basically yes. Bottom floor ore despawns with resources, top floor despawns with time. Much more afk
---
You asked me a question, and I gave you an answer. If you aren't happy with that, I don't know what I can do for you beyond this.
---
How are partnerships a slippery slope? Were you this outraged at the twitch partnership and purple skin?
---
I will dissect what I dislike about the news post so you may see that I'm not whining to whine. I dislike anything that compromises a games identity or integrity, and JaGeX's current idea of partnerships is misguided compared to RuneScape's original vision.
---
&gt;If the content passed it would not have led to more invasive forms of advertising or monetisation but would have enabled us to do exciting things for our players with partners such as Twitch, Discord, and more. 
---
My opinion is that the purple skin was invasive, JaGeX doesn't agree.
---
&gt;Our motivation for the poll stems from our belief that by tying the partnership to content that we think you would honestly like to see in-game, our partners would then be more inclined to help us with activity that’s good for all players.
---
No content should ever be tied to something outside of the game. I don't care if I like the content or not, don't link the game with the outside universe.
---
&gt;**That's why we promised** that the content we were offering would become freely available to all players once the partnership ended. 
---
That doesn't matter, content should never be excluded from players based on where they came from. Players are given equal standing from the day they start on tutorial island, that should not change simply because JaGeX wants to be associated with Apple and Twitch. 
---
&gt;We are disappointed that the reception to the blog has focused around monetisation in-game –something that is not in any of our plans – although we can understand your trepidation. 
---
The reception is that money and videogames should not be directly linked. We pay for subscription already to support the game, but that doesn't mean that if I paid more or allowed JaGeX to make more money that I am entitled to change what the game is or how items are acquired.
---
If they want to add a purple or orange skin, it should be because of a quest, a mini quest, a new city, or something within the game's universe. People should not be encouraged to associate with third parties to be part of a new exclusive club. Cosmetics like this encourage elitism and exlusive behavior rather than being part of a group of players together.

I legit cant be fucked...
---
I hate this 'gamers are entitled' attitude. You wouldn't get it in any other consumer industry. I might not own the company, but I'm a paying customer. If the game changes in a way I don't like, I will stop giving them my money. If the company says they might change in the future I have every right to express my discontent. If the company LITERALLY ASKS MY OPINION, I am not entitled for talking about how much I hate the idea of adding microtransactions. 
---
Of course it's in their rights to do whatever the fuck they want to the game. That doesn't mean I'm supposed to shut up and keep shoveling my 11 dollars into the fire. I get to get mad. I get to hate microtransactions. I get to be an unsatisfied customer. I get to make crab memes.

I don't understand what you even want. Should we just be happy with whatever Jagex allows since we don't own the game and never express an opinion? If we did that OSRS literally would not exist. This game is only here because we demanded a return to form after RS3. End of the day they might own the game. But we are the customers, and 'the customer is always right'.
---
Couple years back they had these God-themed flat brims... Some sold out in less that 48 hours and needed a double restock if the blog posts from that time are to be believed. I still rock my Zaros one. Would pay double for my boy Guthix...
---
bonds do nothing for jagex... are you serious?
---
&gt;It's that high because the proposed changes were fine themselves. It just sets a precedent. If you didn't think beyond this singular poll, you'd probably vote yes as well.
---
Exactly; if this poll was being conducted by a more trustworthy company than Jagex and/or if we didn't know what had happened with RS3, then there would be a much higher ratio of Yes votes.
---
i agree that exp lamps and eoc was bad, how does cosmetic equal that?
---
That's exactly what profit means tho. Profit=total revenue-expenses. The 41m is how much they had leftover after covering all costs
---
Question, assuming he was doing elder chaos druids, how in the hell did he manage to get pked? Its under 20 wild so surely you hover over a tele at all times or do pkers log in and insta teleblock or something?
---
Yes there is. They're like $40
---
nope it's still there
---
It's never enough for MBAs. They corrupt everything they touch.
---
dude where is the TL:DR at?
---
How about you shut the fuck up? You didnt play runescape back in 04 05, 06, 07 and onwards up until they ruined the game alot of us had sunk the better part of our youth grinding out skills and memories. It's obvious that you didnt play back then because you were fucking dumb enough to type the shit you did. This is in no way an overreaction from the LOYAL playerbase, this is us standing our ground and holding jagex to its promises that they made when we got enough votes to get our tiny fucking dev team to make OSRS a thing. Osrs wasnt given the time of day when it passed a poll, it was treated as a joke by jagex, they gave us barely enough devs to keep the bugs at bay. And now after all these years of putting our time and love into THE SAME game that they fucked up before, they try to pull the same shit, but this time we can fight back against it. 
---
So take a second before typing your MTX sympathizing bullshit, you have no idea the pride we take in our game. You probably jump between games weekly, we stay for years and years most of us logging in daily to see our friends and play this game we love. Join us in guarding this garden of eden or shut the fuck up and be thankful somone else had the balls to do it for you.
---
I think everyone just used all their memes they had saved for years. Now when the real MTX poll comes we have no OC to use against it
---
The original poll questions didn't mention that the cosmetics would be earned through partnership deals.
---
They were simply listed like "Do you want X to be in the game?"
---
I wish, I have some of the same issues? But this is the community that laughed at the idea of a “drop all” function in the inventory (mods even ridiculed the idea on q&amp;a) and would be upset that “well I had to drop a million fish 1 by 1, fucking ezscape babies ruining the game” and so on and so on.  I wouldn’t hold out much hope.
---
Not a fan of scuffed venenatis?
---
it does, everything is still mostly the same as it was 15 years ago
---
Lockheed Martin, British Petroleum, S.P.E.C.T.R.E, Peoples Republic Of China, etc.
---
Standard fare really
---
Dude my source is myself you could sign up for a Twitch Prime trial and link it to OSRS and acquire the purple skin all for paying $0, so next time instead of downvoting me because you're an idiot you should know what you're talking about.
---
How about the vanilla client? That sounds like a block on the network. Firewall settings changed?
---
Nah bro, I just don't like racists. No matter what color their skin is.
---
Oh i understand companies want to make more money at whatever the cost. Doesnt mean we should let them.
---
Facts
---
I have, you just don't like the answer. It is my opinion that partnerships are a slippery slope leading to mtx
---
Good bot.
---
They literally just tried to...
---
41million doesnt include whatever the chinese overlord take away from Jagex.
---
Mom said it’s my turn to repost this
---
Guilty by association
---
I didn't look at the figures myself, but usually they include rs3 subs, osrs subs, as well as a number for mtx. Mtx also includes bonds from osrs, so the numbers aren't completely representative of how much each makes.
---
Can we get a pol to get the EA guys fired?
---
This year's report sinply split income between osrs and rs3 not anymore sub vs mtx
---
Personally I've been playing a fair amount of other games recently just because of burnout from bring dry on my dwh grind. The played time doesn't really justify 11$ but I have more than enough gold stocked up to buy a bond whenever I do feel like playing.
---
When classic wow comes out theres no way I'd play enough to sub outside of bonds.
---
Thanks. I saw in another post that its a real jagex address. Looks so fake tho.
---
🦀 🦀 JMODS WONT RESPOND TO THIS 🦀 🦀
---
I mean, the purple skin was unpolled content iirc, i see no reason why they wouldnt try something similar again.
---
"Disruptive Behavior"
---
That's a bunch of lies, now excuse me while I complain on reddit how this marks the start of MTX and will kill the game
---
I've been away for a couple months. Can someone bring me up to speed on what's going on?
---
Why the fuck would you be okay with product placement in quests in a game you PAY a monthly subscription for lmao?
---
Ya with that release looming it’s easier to leave RuneScape for another nostalgic MMO. Or I’ll just go back to the games I was playing before hoping on OSRS.
---
This is when a 9 year old tries to act smart.
---
No, every question were very clear about the partnership part. See below.
---
*Question #1:
---
Should we add a new player-owned-house house style decoration, themed on the Morytania region? It would be added as described in the blog - first released with a partnership, before being released to all players at a later date.*
---
No. It's different in OSRS than in RS3. We can poll for all MTX while RS3 cannot. We can just vote no for all MTX that crosses the line instead of overreacting with a zero MTX tolerance policy.
---
100%. Almost as if they’re like “we know you want what we’ve offered and we know better than you”. Or making out that not accepting partnerships is baffling and we’ve “misunderstood”. Lmao.
---
- Prospector outfit is a requirement along with 60 mining for the Falador hard diary
---
- Gem bag is handy for slayer and mining
---
- Coal bag is handy for smithing and mining
---
That analogy doesn't make sense
---
Scrolled to bottom couldn't find one so I'll add it. TL:DR: This is a rant no one bothered to read and will probably forget about before they finish reading this comment.
---
It seems to actually be a legit email this time but I think it's safer to just literally ignore every runescape related email or atleast never click a link from one. It's always best to just check the message centre on the official site by manually going to it and logging in yourself.
---
August Drama Calendar: "We have decided that seeking parterships classifies as an integrity change, but we appreciate your input in last month's poll."
---
&gt; The original poll questions
---
Originally they were not phrased as such. It was only after people complained about how misleading they were that they were changed.
---
Yeah I feel bad for Settled not getting his referral code partnership out of this haha
---
As a way for them to accept a partnership while having an incentive for new content for us.
---
Track record of another dev team and another ceo. Actually, I think the only person that's working today on osrs that also was back then is mod ash.
---
I trust this dev team way more than the rs2 team, so I don't quite buy it, myself. I respect people wary of it though.
---
CEO's making too much doesn't mean the same thing as devs getting mistreated. And you need to realize, devs cost a company a ton more than their salary. The overhead for the benefits, office space, equipment, software, etc, can be way more than the cost of their salary. And more devs means more HR, IT, and so on.
---
Knowledge is power. Read.
---
Jagex isnt worth billion dollars. Maybe half a billion.
---
Jagex: 30% of players support MTX!
---
Investors: It's free real estate!
---
I want to earn cosmetics. I dont understand why it would be cool to get them through partnerships. Devalues cosmetics gained by clues and also makes future content harder to make due to potential rewards being taken die partnerships deals
---
That’s actually good to know, I’ll try that next time.
