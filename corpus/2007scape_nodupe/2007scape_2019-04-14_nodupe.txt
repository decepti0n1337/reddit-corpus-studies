Eh, depends how you define "up there". It's harder than, let's say, bandos with a group but for example it's in no way comparable to the inferno. I definitely see where you're coming from though.

 Get all your untrables. Barrows gloves, fire cape, elite void, fighters torso. That should cost you almost nothing. For traonign, finish your obby set. Get the sword and zerker necklace

I think arcane is one of the last upgrades you want, ancestral pieces give dmg bonus. Maybe learn with sanguinesti staff, cheaper than arcane and heals you but expensive to use.. I would use a serp helm to learn. It helps a lot to learn the 2 melee rotations first, If green ranger or blue mager comes 2nd phase just log out. Do 100 kills or so like this until you‚Äôre comfortable. After awhile you‚Äôll catch on to how many attacks you can do on each phase and be ready with your switches, prayers, moving spots etc.

Okay thank you, also I'm currently doing the 1:0 method for the melee hand.. should I learn the 3:1 or the 4:1 or just keep practicing with the 1:0 until I can do it without dying?
---
The only thing not allowed is using such programs to move your cursor or to perform more than one action per key press. If all you‚Äôre doing is remapping one key to another then that‚Äôs fine.

You have any rough idea of what you might have said? Sounds like you got lucky and they used some discretion on you. No previous offences I'm guessing?

1. Make a bit of money (Cow hides/leather sell for like 150gp each), do some quests (need 7 quest points to sell cow hides), train stats. If you get a [clue scroll](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Clue_scroll_(beginner\)) (Goblins and men drop them, I think) do it. They can have some decent rewards. Once you have some armor and a bit of food, go do the Stronghold of Security. It'll give you some decent boots and 10k cash. You need to set up 2-factor authentication to do it though.
---

---
2. If you're unskulled you lose every tradeable item except your 3 most valuable. You won't lose untradeables. If you're skulled (Usually through attacking another player) you lose everything tradeable. If you're past level 20 wilderness you lose untradeables. Unless you're in an instanced area (Some quest bosses, for example), you have an hour to go grab your stuff.
---
Right now the easter event is going on. I'd go do that to pick up the event items. They're mostly just untradeable fashionscape items but the easter eggs are tradeable and heal 14 if you eat them. They're only going for about 1k each right now but early on that's a free 2k  to get you started.
---
1) Make an alt to pre-scout raids with. Seriously. You can bring much more efficient setups this way.
---
2) 3 staminas is enough. 1 for the raid, 2 for olm. Once you get better you can even drop this down to 2 staminas (1-2 douses for the raid, the rest for olm).
---
3) 2 restores is enough, only bring 4 if you have vespula without muttadiles/tekton before hand (which would drop a prayer enhance for you).
---
4) I'd ditch Kharils for god d'hide. The defensive bonus from Kharils makes minimal difference, but the prayer bonus from blessed d'hide can be nice.
---
5) Swap serp for neitz. Serp has negative bonuses for range and mage, so it's just one more thing you have to worry about un-equipping when you're maging/ranging. Neitz does not have these penalties. Also, neitz doesn't waste scales. Really wouldn't recommend serp unless you're going for a WR and doing things like skipping rope (Where the defense bonus is clutch).
---
6) Ditch the sanfew unless you have Shamans late into the raid and aren't confident you can make it there in time. Otherwise, just sip an antidote ++ before going in.
---
7) Only bring Hasta if you have Vasa. Otherwise, you'd be better off with a tent whip.
---
8) Bring more swaps. Torm brace, fire cape, prims, torture would be my recommendations.
---
9) Alch that pick and buy a dragon pickaxe.
---
10) Consider bringing in a DCB/ACB. Doing 2:0 on the head phase of Olm with a crossbow + blowpipe is easier when you're first learning than just blowpipe walking the whole thing. It can also come in handy for Shamen if you're having issues getting the rhythm down for blowpipe (especially if both get aggro'd onto you simultaneously), and a hit or two to see if you can get a ruby bolt to proc at large mutta never hurts.

It's a mystery.

Yes but we also love expensive clue scroll rewards. Remember money talks.

I'm still learning myself. Just passing on what people have told me but learning 3:1 or 4:1 would really help you take less damage. I guess it depends how often you mess up doing 1:0

if it is just to kill a regular hydra and not the boss it probably does not require a task but tbh idk about hydra or the diary specifically so, look there.

So you ARE allowed to map keys to mouse movement? I remember a while ago they didn't like OSbuddy (I think) allowing mouse movements for fast dropping. Was the policy on this changed with the addition of shift-dropping?

If it took 20 years by the calendar, it's the same percentage of time of average human lifespan, or conscious time to average conscious human lifespan (assuming 8sleep:16awake).
---
Over 20 years, you're assumed to sleep for 6.667, and be awake for 13.333, if we go 8:16 as above. Assuming the average lifespan is ~75 years (for nice round numbers) then 20 years of that is 26.67%
---
Assuming the observed time for that same lifespan, we get 50. 13.33 observed years of 50 observed lifespan is still 26.666%

The alt-tab thing is the only instance where I am remapping anything for runescape, but thank you for the concern.
---
May I ask where you are getting your information/what you are basing your response on when saying that the alt-tab will be bannable since it is 2:1? I only ask because everyone else is telling me that I will be fine and that it isn't bannable. I do appreciate the response though, as I would hate to be banned over something I do to save half of a second of effort.

Try castle wars

Thank you! I do not know for sure whether this was the exact spot or not, since I gave up and dropped it all, but I really appreciate the help! What threw me off, if the desert was the location, was that moving south (right on the north-side of theal Kharid desert fence) made the orb colder so I figured it was over the fence.

Why are you complaining about getting a puppy in 700 kills and only going slightly dry on the prims (25% of not getting it in 714 kills)?  If you have that attitude on ironman mode, you probably should kill yourself (ingame).

Blowpipe is already too fucking powerful for what it costs, we don't need more blowpipes.

There's a reason for it. Currently they actually have no way to check when a track ends, so no way to determine when to play the next track.

If they made something for that, we could have shuffle and also playlists.
---
In what situations should you turn on the ring of suffering recoil effect? The ring itself is obviously useful for its defensive stats at places like DKs, demonic gorillas, etc., and for the recoil at zulrah, but I'm not sure whether it's worth it to leave the recoil effect on in every single situation. It doesn't seem like the upkeep cost would be an insane amount of money, but I don't know where the cost outweighs the benefits.

My first time I tried fighting a pure with 4 combat levels higher than my main (didn't know how much of a difference that made). When I saw I did 4 damage over 4 hits and he hit all 8-9s I decided to run and he followed me over the ditch and called me a pussy for about 5 minutes (I told him he won and it was my first time so I didn't know what I was doing). Then I felt bad so i went back in and fought him. I healed whenever i dropped below half but made sure not to eat to full and he called me a pussy safer and decimated me. Overall it was a pretty great experience and I'm glad to be apart of this community.

Hes probs used his email and the same password for other games and stuff. Those companies get hacked/sell that info and hackers use this since people have emails not usernames. They can also check whether the email is on jagex and if yes they sent fake emails

Nah. The packaging requires all 4 buttons to be compressed at the same time for the lid to come off.

fuck every time

Was thinking h the same thing ! So this meme is fake
---
You definitely fell for something or had malware or used an exact replica of a previous email address and password combo
---
They probably had some backups post-2007, but it may not have been a full backup with the engine and everything like the 2007 backup was. Also, I think they were intentionally going for an older backup not just to avoid rivaling RS2, but because the demand for OSRS arose from a 2006 private server and players were asking for earlier RS2 and not just pre-EoC. That said, given how many other things Jagex has done questionable for a company of their size/status, it honestly wouldn't surprise me if they didn't keep that many backups.

What doesn't make sense about it. It's an agreement and they are using an example they don't approve of to support the idea. Players don't like the idea of making bosses instanced only for ironmen.

Because the community doesn't want it and has said so many times.

It‚Äôs possible I have malware., I‚Äôm pretty carful though. I made a designated email and password for this account. I just changed everything but I‚Äôm tempted to just stop playing already. It still won‚Äôt let me set up the Authenticator.
---
I'm think the recent update you might be talking about was that they removed 'preloaded' gmaul specs where you could double click the spec, but switch back to another weapon, and then insta spec from any weapon, for example dh axe, which wouldn't otherwise be possible.
---
It wasn't widely used though, and the standard msb/gmaul style insta spec hasn't changed in a long time as far as i know.
---
To do what about it? I like the gmail.

When people say bis in this cape when it's a +4 prayer bonus I have to laugh. That boost is no miniscule it doesn't matter. It doesn't effect damage in any way at all so it's pretty much irrelevant.

Yeah I think the quick guides are so good. Because if youre watching a video you have to see the steps he takes through a dialogue and then replicate that, with a guide you see 3 ‚ö¨ 1 and then you just press that on a keyboard.

Imagine being this upset by some words on the Internet that weren‚Äôt even directed at you. I hope you have a wonderful night there pal.

There‚Äôs a video of Zezima turning his private to ‚Äúon‚Äù  in like 2006 and him getting so many messages it crashed his game I think.

It would have been hard for him to have meaningful interactions with fans I think
---
&gt;I am writing this because I feel my account has been wrongly permanently muted.
---
Alright let's look into this:
---
&gt;A few weeks ago I got a temporary 48 hr mute by a player mod for using an auto-typer in game, and while I understand this was a rule, I didn't know it was enforced after seeing world 2 spammers. 
---
Well, it's a rule, so of course it is enforced when a mod catches someone breaking it
---
&gt;This permanent mute came out of nowhere 
---
Wait, what?
---
&gt;I know I didn't break any of the rules of runescape. 
---
But you just said you did break one
---
&gt;I have been playing since 2004 and never gotten any account banned or permanently muted.
---
That's irrelevant
---
&gt;When I checked to see the evidence of any rule breaking it says: JAGEX MODERATOR COMMENT. 
---
They are referring to the usage of an auto-typer when you received the temporary mute
---
&gt;There is no evidence of any rule breaking and I have no understanding of what rule was broken? 
---
Yes there was and yes you do
---
&gt;Why is this so shady. 
---
It isn't
---
&gt;I need answers and would like someone at jagex to look into this personally.
---
They did, that's why you're muted
---
&gt;I have submitted an appeal which was basically auto-denied with no follow up of any specific rule that was broken.
---
JAGEX MODERATOR COMM NT
---
&gt;Please if any jagex member could message me and provide some information and possibly talk to me about what happened and if it actually deserved a permanent mute I would greatly appreciate it. This is mind-blowing to me
---
Good luck with that part.
---
Does it really have to be over a decade?

---
Occasionally the people don't split well and you don't get enough hard hitters to kill the portal quick enough even on vet boost
---
IANAL but the court can ask you to give a sample and if you're innocent I'd say its definitly worth it to give one.  I think under certain circumstances you might be required to give saliva or a hair sample or something though.
---
if you mean relative to just being 99 everything, yeah the advantage is combat level. Max combat is always the strongest build but at 126 combat you can't hit a lot of pking builds (eg. pures, zerks would be too low level) at places like black chins or graves, whereas with a ~110 cb build you can hit pretty much any pure, any zerk, midlevel and main. 
---
PKing builds are basically about minmaxing, getting the most potential damage possible for a certain combat level so that you can beat other people in your "bracket."
---
If my job was accounting, I would prefer to stare at the wall instead.

I think your artist forgot which kneecap you said to tattoo above

Yup! Just look up runescape

I was doing DUO with a clannie. We both used Black D‚Äôhide barrow gloves, Ava‚Äôs accumulator, Guthix coif. We used Ruby Bolt (e) along with Diamond (e) then of course glory and your choice of ring.
---
Talk to the guy in varrock museum
---
Why use an auto typer when there‚Äôs one in game? You didn‚Äôt even show any screenshots of the offense which makes you look worse tbh
---
I've been playing for 16 and still no 99. If I ever get a 99 it means I've played too much Runescape
---
cute
---
Dude it looks great, it's a fun little runescape tattoo, people be obsessing over every stupid fucking detail about what a rune should look like
---
I do agree with everything you said, have my upvote!
---
Why are you even doing NMZ if you‚Äôre an iron. Isn‚Äôt there a million drops you need to grind out before maxed anyway?
---
I agree it is probably bugged but only for you and your specific recently updated client and none of the other 100,000+ clients that players use daily
---
Can‚Äôt believe this guy is actually Joji lmao
---
I propose a petition to change the rune cost of Varrock teleport to 1 air rune and 3 fire runes.
---
zerkers are fun. they're not as good as they used to be (ever since rigour + claws came out and 60 att meds took over) but they're still not the worst. 
---
55 pray if you want to hybrid/tribrid since spirit shield is really good, 52 pray if you're just going to do bounty hunter and still want to be able to enjoy slayer and stuff since you get overheads. don't recommend 31 pray unless you only use it for venge pking.
---
60 att on zerks has been really good ever since claws came out, and at lower combats (between 87 - 91) you can kill a lot of pures. 75 if you want ags or plan on doing pvm etc.
---
the only issue with those max 75 att zerks (99 cb 75/99/45/55) is that your combat ends up kind of high so trying to pk anywhere you basically get hit by meds all day it's actually annoying. i mean with ags you can still get kills but you're basically tank testing every fight against a legion of 60 att meds with rigour and claws til you hit the rambo.

Hello, I have a medium farming contract for [Jangerberries](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Jangerberry_seed) but I'm unable to complete it, I grow twice the bush and everytime I check health nothing happen. Have anyone else encounter this issue, or am I missing something ? Thanks :)
---
Not a bank, wonko.  Shop in game
---
Raids requires quite a few non combat skills to be pretty high, and all endgame PvM requires high combat skills (obviously...)
---
It‚Äôs killing me mate, I can kill maybe 4 before I have to teleport out. This is going to take me forever
---
Then downvote it and move on. Everyone gets a vote. If things pop up on the front page, that means people want to see it. You aren't special and not everything needs to be 100% catered to you.
---
Somewhat true as I've pked extensively it all zerk brackets and had 6 or 7 zerks total. However these days even a low level zerk with prayer gets picked on by meds. People are making 60-85-70-99-70-99 meds and keeping lowish hp and still putting the hurting on zerks.
---
And actually 16/31 pray zerks are probably one of the only builds I'd still use as far as zerks goes. Risk is low (fcape and torso) and can deal decent damage.
---
6 years? Currently at 1400 kc and just got my first unique 5 kills ago with d bone necklace.

You aren‚Äôt wrong about the first part. But for the second part, it‚Äôs so extremely low impact to anyone‚Äôs life, as well as subjective, that I just can‚Äôt find it in myself to find a reason to be bothered by it.
---
It‚Äôs like a child‚Äôs first steps. Yes, all the adults around the kid can obviously walk, but that‚Äôs that kid‚Äôs first time doing it. I‚Äôm not gonna brush it off because I‚Äôve been walking for years; it‚Äôs cool you achieved those steps, homeboy. I‚Äôm proud of you. Same thing applies for me here. It may be a trivial accomplishment relative to what you or I have done, but for the person sharing it, it‚Äôs their accomplishment. Maybe it‚Äôs a goal they‚Äôve worked at for weeks or months. My status or anyone else‚Äôs status doesn‚Äôt change the fact they‚Äôve met a goal for themselves, and I‚Äôll be just as proud for them.

Now, in the realistic vain of things, I just scroll past and don‚Äôt upvote or downvote, but just making the case of why it isn‚Äôt so bad.

I'm on 75 ranged now (don't have a blowpipe tho, but karils/rune cb if thats okay), 75 mage and 65 defence)

I saw some guides where people said void is minimum, some say barrows eq is minimum but whats really necessary. I've seen many things about the rotations but the equipment varies quite heavily each time.

People generally stop at 83. There's no real reason to train it higher unless you're going for the 99

You either get 83 or 99. Since 83 u can get the best house. And at 99 u get the teleport of the cape.

Total sound scape rehaul has been on my mind for a long time. I'm talking new sound levels that actually work, filtering area sounds to just your own and the music player update.

Haha can‚Äôt wait to read it! Maybe involve the Wise Old Man and call it like, ‚ÄúThe Last Great Heist of Gielinor‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know haha just an idea! 
---
Another thing I‚Äôve thought about, is if it had super low requirements, it would give another option for DMM players to rush instead of Stronghold if Security. 
---
Or, if it had super high requirements, it could reward more money, like 100k or so and have an option at the end where you can split or steal it from the Wise Old Man. If you try to steal it, he‚Äôll find out and somehow and that can be a boss fight. If you don‚Äôt, he‚Äôll try to and then you‚Äôll find out and fight him? Idk haha just a couple ideas!

Safing isn't really an RSC term. It's an RS2 term derived from people now having the ability to eat inside of combat.

---
depends if its 1 tick stack or not. only way to get a 1tick stack is to stack a ranged/magic hit with melee or if using melee to begin with, a pidswap.
---
if it's not a 1tick stack, you can out eat it. if it's a 1tick stack, then if you're 99 hp and brew up you can only go to 115 hp and if the damage is more than that there's nothing you could've done.
---
Does crystal saw actually works with fairy rings? I think I've red somewhere that it doesn't
---
I agree, maybe make it low scale kills wise just because of the drop table, and if someone doesn‚Äôt have the requirements for the pet/already has it there wouldn‚Äôt be a point killing it.
---
That‚Äôs what his in game character looked like
---
I do the same thing, running around closing doors staying on the inside of the enclosure, and running through the middle killing anything that got through, they don't give points for closing doors though, so landing hits and killing stuff is more important than the doors.

Strictly speaking, training at nmz is zero time, since you can literally do it at any time, unless you are sleeping, so from an full efficiency standpoint it will always be better to get max melee before going for 99 slayer.

The fact that you bought it with actual money doesn't mean anything either, because your money wasn't stolen. 
---
If you want to try and talk to them, there's probably a section on the forum, or 'Jagex Support' on Twitter. But I'd brace yourself for being told they won't do anything.
---
So wrecked and fat wrecked are two different guys.
---
Of course it will :) You'll amount 500k in no time when you get to making money. 
---
I'm not an ironman myself so I don't know the best money-making methods, but at monsters such as gargoyles even I commonly make over 400k just from alching.
---
If you do 500ish, and then spend what you make at Wintertodt on Redwoods, they'll be at a much higher XP rate and you'll be around 97/98 and you can get hammer out the last levels quicker.
---
Love Slayer, and I love Runecrafting. Agility can go fuck itself lol
---
Ironmen try for ages to get those beads, lucky man
---
A seven year old playing at my house can‚Äôt log in to the game. He doesn‚Äôt have my credentials because I logged him in. Also, that is on my account that is fine and has the majority of my wealth, I made the account in question literally a day agO
---
Oof
---
Whats the chance to proc an enchanted bolt without Kandarin Hard diary? I can't find it and I want to know if the 10% boost is cumulative (normal proc is 1% +10%=11) or multiplicative on its regular chance (normal proc is 10+10√ó10%=11)
---
Well then you have about a 30%~ chance to pass per attempt and the quest requries you to go there like twice. So it would have taken like 6-7 tries on average.
---
I'd rather hold off. There's plenty of other things to do
---
As others have said in the thread its not to stop rapists, its to stop false rape claims.
---
This option would be so nice...
---
lol bro how is that lvl 1 fashionscape level treating you
---
This is some RS3 content gtfo
---
Nah I'm more than capable of doing godwars. I just prefer to dictate when. Also, you sound toxic as fuck

I can safely confirm it is an incredible feeling. Doing beginners now then might dabble with easy clues after. A man needs his slippers..

No but they released a recolour dude

Thanks gamer, have a good day.

My bank has my back if all else fails.

Exactly, that'd be a perfect start for a design.

and it would attract more player to the game, but what do I know

I think you're willfully missing the point in order to pretend that attention whoring doesn't exist. Meaningful to the collective doesn't mean meaningful to every single member of a collective. 
---
Not everybody is valid just because they feel good about themselves. Yes there can be hypothetical situations where those posts can be genuine, but those situations are so rare that frankly it's dishonest to represent those posts as such, and so clueless that they should be criticised anyway. 
---
It is a serious problem both for perceptions and mental health to be giving constant attention and positive feedback. Social media addiction is a big problem because of how you suggest people conduct themselves, instead of trying to keep social media remotely grounded and workable.
---
Hmm, that's a good point indeed. I'll keep that in mind

Thank you so much! Any idea on the exp tracker thingy?

I can't use Tinder as far as I know. I don't have a smartphone.

Nice!

Since I was 11 years old I've wanted to rob a bank, like right click on a banker and select "rob" and if u unsuccessful no more bank for you for 30 minutes
---
Well opinions are generally not right or wrong because it's an opinion so you are not wrong. Also I am not a pvper but I also understand that anyone with a decent understanding of the game can tank a tb with no issue. I'm sorry you got tbed and lost your 40k bank, as you progress I hope you learn more about the game and are willing to change your opinion accordingly not just blatantly argue everyone that says anything to you. Best of luck.

Honestly the best thing to do here is to skip that task.

You realize that what I listed are verbs and actual words and runecrafting would also make sense but for some odd reason they went with runecraft
---
Dying a bunch at zulrah :)
---
I'd say get your agility up, do quests which gives a lot of xp and get som teleports (games neck, duel ring, ardy cape 1, fairy rings). If you want a great dps weapon outside d scim consider getting iban's staff from underground pass.
---
Huh?
---
https://i.imgur.com/JMpRYhW.png I saw him at the fishing guild once, first time I saw a famous player. Didn't expect him to talk to me since I always heard Zezima never said anything. He was responding to everyone, was really cool. Never spotted him in rs2.
---
the man was asking for cheap training methods, I provided one.
---
Love that game, still play sometimes just to collect seasonal rares.
---
Sure. Would i wear it? Absolutely not.
---
I miss it :'(
---
You should just get max strength and use claws or a crystal halberd. Your spec will often be enough to kill thermi alone, and even if it doesn't a couple whip slaps kills him.
---
I got it on my regular account, good for cheap or even profitable xp.
---
Your defence level is irritating me.
---
waddup homos
---
Left: Human head wih big chin
---
Right: Pulled down pants with exposed ding-dong
---
Time for sucky sucky
---
Black dragons have high defense, usually only use DHCB on em.
---
Nothing that i can think of, best bet is to train slayer until your stats are significantly higher, best of luck.
---
I saw him killing zombies in varrock sewer wearing black dhide, nez hem and a d scim, there were like 10 people just stood there watching him
---
That was in like 2005/6 when I was 11. It must have been a big moment because I still remember it well

thank you Mod Ash

Welcome to /r/2007scape
---
PVMIMG IS USELESS FOR PKERS REMOVE FROM GAME PLZ THX 
---
Imagine being so narrow minded. If you don‚Äôt enjoy the content, don‚Äôt indulge. The wilderness is the way it is because that‚Äôs how it was meant to be. Seasoned pkers enjoy it for what it is. Go play rs3 and you won‚Äôt have to worry about PvP. ü§£
---
You don't, by the way - bush contracts are check-health.
---
Does anyone actually legitimately come across this shit whilst just swiping? Reuse to believe this is actually a thing.
---
I played it when I was at the library and they blocked RuneScape.
---
Can‚Äôt believe I have to go sell this 36m drop now, ugh....
---
I would follow the gmaul pure quest guides. Takes no time to make, you have a lot of killing fun.
---
There's no PVM you can really do just yet in terms of good money.
---
If you're not an efficiency nut, you should start doing some slayer. It'll expose you to more monsters in your level and potentially make money.
---
If you're okay with a little bit of risk, you can do wilderness slayer. All her monsters have a small chance to drop an emblem which is about 100k so you can make some decent money while collecting points.
---
If you decide to do so, you should watch a video on YouTube about it!
---
You can set it to fully hide the message.

Almost 2k kc 3 tails 1 leather 5 ring pieces that's it.. reee

Also why not just use a different brand of condom

I was in Fat's circle of friends when he passed. It was a sad day for everyone. https://youtu.be/Hczn1IFW7fE
---
I use it to not waste prayer pots on the last ghosts.
---
True.
---
You make a lot of assumptions about me. I've been playing for a long time. My opinion is formed from my years of experience with this game.
---
Thank you! I stopped doing slayer because I didn't have the quest done to get points
---
wtf it takes a few hours. waste of points if this was a thing
---
[nice](https://i.imgur.com/94oMzRB.png)
---
I mean I swiped right on her but the odds aren't looking in my favour at this point, will keep you posted on the level of rejection I receive
---
Ughhh why are so many people against this...
---
Years of experience but you don't know there are multiple ways to teleport out of 30+ wild? Ok.
---
Damn adventure quest was my shit
---
Im sure.
---
Considering the fact that hellpuppy took me 6700 kc on my main.
---
Just like kbd skotizo kalphite queen vorkath right
---
Thank you, Mod Ash
---
I thought the same thing after getting a hydra's claw at 275 kc, but then i got another at 675kc.
---
Tis truly a magical thing making money in runescape :)
---
Gl sir
---
Yeah
---
I'm not saying remove pvp. Just remove teleblock or fix it because it is a retarded spell that attempts to make up for the deficiencies in combat.
---
Parental permission
---
Jesus I have a maxed clanning zerk WITH 45 DEF and have tanked down a half tb from 50 wild to 30...
---
I'd vote yes if unlockable. Don't make me waste skip points on these tasks
---
just use void
---
It has a love heart on it, why is this? Are you feeling romantic ;)

Even with DHCB it's all rng. Usually 1:20 kills as well but sometimes it can take over 2:30-3:00 and this is with 99 range, bis except dragonfire ward, rigour, while never missing any hits or ticks and fucking woox walking as well.
---
Thanks God Ash
---
Most aids suggestion I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Chaos Fanatic is much less of a pain in the ass, not sure if I‚Äôd consider it worth the difference in drop rate though, especially since fanatic doesn‚Äôt drop d pick
---
I know there are teleports out of the wild past 20, but most teleports are not those, and not everyone has access to them.
---
Bro he's base 70 combat. You think he can casually pull out BIS 100m gear?
---
What bet did you lose to have to get this? And I thought evscapes forfeit tattoo looked shit.
---
The real big brain.
---
What quest?
---
Right and that's fine, but these "No friends but..." posts don't deserve 1k upvotes and shouldn't be on the front page all the time in my opinion. I'd like to have other content because these posts feel like reposts. Not that I can dictate what r/2007scape is supposed to be, these are just my personal preferences.
---
Was looking for this, I'm trying to get to the damn portal in the first 10 seconds stop insta closing the damn door when its opened....give me like 2 seconds to step tbrough.

thank you mod ash
---
Warding shouldnt exist
---
this song is so familiar, what game is it from
---
Get about atleast 45-50 range and kill green dragons, use ranging pot for boost and dorg bow with bone bolts or addy crossbow with mith bolts.
---
You‚Äôll make good money off them, you don‚Äôt need very high combat stats for green dragons since you‚Äôll be safe spotting them, bring a glory for teleport when you see pkers around your level,memorise the level range that can Attack you around green dragons so you‚Äôre always ready to TP.
---
This is an old topic and has been discussed several times. Jagex is not going to modify their bot detection system to accomodate people using OSHD. So, due to the way graphical retexturing works on 3rd party clients, the bot detection picks it up as a bot overlay. As such, ModMatK warned us that using the client would cause your account to be flagged and banned for macroing. Jagex doesn't want to ban innocent players but cannot modify the way the bot detection works because that would compromise the effectiveness of bot detection.
---
If jagex were to provide their own version of HD toggle, it would more than double the amount of graphical and animation work needed to be done for every current and future piece of content. From a business standpoint, it simply isn't possible. It very likely would not bring in nearly enough players to justify doubling the graphics work and redoing every existing model and animation in game. 
---
Trust me, I want OSHD too. But reality is what it is. It's unfortunate and we have to appreciate that we at least have the 2007 version to play still. Imagine playing rs3 instead...oh god.

I got 2 in my first 90 kills. Sorry for yoinking them
---
This gear isn't bad, it's just a new account... Someone using a dharoks axe with a void helm and d chain is post worthy.
---
Range would be MSB I... although I can‚Äôt recommend it as chinning/blowpipe is just so much better.
---
And at those stats it would probably be best for addy dagger until higher strength... or it Sharon‚Äôs is better it‚Äôs marginal at that level and probably not worth the hassle until 85+ strength
---
left is a jew, right is twin towers with a qp on the tail of the plane.
---
Did it happend the same way as mine? Without logging out of RL and not changing device? Have you found a solution already? Such a shame :/
---
For what?

Thank you mod ash

It's Osama on the left I think, all of the #'s represent his beard. But yeah twin towers on the right.

I am 1000% in favor of this

Go and get all medium achievement diaries.

They have quest requirements and skill requirements which will give you something to strive towards.

1 combat level isn't the end of the world lol. You'll still basically get all the same fights

Why do all tattoos have to have a dead set meaning?
---
One clue scroll. 32 mil. You sir. Can die. 
---
In the friendliest of ways.
---
Level up your stats to 61 ranged (for rune crossbow), 60 attack/str/def (for dragon gear), ~60 magic (for using Ibans blast from 50 magic) and 43 prayer (for using protection prayers). Then try out doing some Barrows. That‚Äôs the way into PvM for a brand new player I‚Äôd say!
---
You mean constructing and hunting
---
Then don't make dumb suggestions. :D
---
Almost 1.3k is higher than around 1k last I checked. Unless something has changed in the last 24 hours but my maths could be wrong..
---
: never represents division. / can mean ratio depending on context, yes.

thank you Mod Ash.
---
People were talking about a bug with attas seeds and the bottomless bucket a while ago. Not sure if it ever got fixed. I just don‚Äôt risk it.
---
Yeah he did, he also got fired from jagex cause of it and removed himself from the game
---
Broooo Adventure quest!! Damn that‚Äôs a blast from the past.
---
How so?
---
I played this with a friend at his house when we were 9. We faced a group of pirhanas and each piranha had to attack before it was our turn again. Each of the pirhanas attackanimation lasted for like 10 seconds and there was like 15-20 of them :( I think the fight is still not over
---
I spent about 15m to max out the nexus, 10m for the occult altar, 4m (2m each) for 2 rejuvenation pools, maybe 2m on various stuff in the achievement gallery, a black mask for the combat dummy, and maybe 5-10m on some other cosmetic stuff that isn‚Äôt necessary. I think that‚Äôs about everything
---
fun &gt; slayer

if ur life consists of playing runescape all day i guess it's true

I disconnected too, died but wa able to loggin.
---
what was your mistake
---
Maybe that‚Äôs where he spent a lot of time in game? I‚Äôm not trying to justify it, I have plenty of tattoos that people would probably shit on. The placement could work well with other future tattoos he has planned. I agree that, yeah, Varrock isn‚Äôt the god damn hub and home of runescape but it‚Äôs pretty damn iconic I‚Äôd say. Idk all in all they definitely could have at least made it like the Lumby tele or something. I‚Äôm not completely disagreeing with you but obviously he got it for SOME reason.
---
And jagex will always challenge that, whichever account you bought the bonds on will be locked until you pay what you owe jagex.

Oh I never knew this was actually a person making quest guides, always seen his name being mentioned but had no idea, i assumed he was that guy that made the rs techno music. Hes like the goingcrazy201 of 2007scape?
---
if you want to avoid skulling I suggest that you turn player attack options off completely.   
---
if you get pk'd you get pk'd but you are only risking what you're willing to anyway so as long as you don't skull you are safe.

good luck going forward.

Thank you mod Ash
---
you only skull when you attack someone first yes.
---
there are ways people like to trick you, like attacking with one account and having another with a very similar name.

if you have no intention of pking then just hide player attack options and only rely on auto retaliate.

Contrary to popular belief, maccroing bans are not thrown around willy nilly.
---
In the rare cases bans are applied to accounts that were hijacked by botters / scammers etc, the likelihood is that the owner didn't secure it properly.
---
There are systems in place to prevent account theft. And steps you can take to prevent this from happening, so there is no economical sense in setting up systems to deal with these rare cases.

Sergio Busquets may be very skinny but his legs are still 3x the size of this guy's. Everybody can gain weight, it may be harder for some people but high metabolism is mostly a myth with little truth behind it. It's just more likely that he isn't very healthy.
---
I guess, just looking at the last few months of value this is a massive change
---
I expected a lot worse actually.

i'm almost 34.8m hunter xp. still don't have chin :( gzz btw

Thank you mod Ash üôèüèª

tfw he says you haven't achieved anything on an ironman and that youre just generic when there are a considerably greater amount of regular players doing the same thing as him PepeLaugh
---
That sounds pretty awesome
---
I feel like any case such as this is easily proven. Allow me to provide appropriate details about the account and IP and such. Don't see any harm in this.
---
What happens if you do it at 0.5 or 0.7 second intervals? I assume anymore than 0.6s your prayer will drain. But what about if you do it faster?
---
Oh fuck
---
I think it‚Äôs price manipulation by merchant clans who are dumping them.

What do you mean how is a limit good? A limit helps the system run smooth. If you have something out of spec, things can and will go wrong.

Yes.

Buddy got banned for "botting" even tho he hasn't played in over a year and wanted to get back into the game. Contacted support they saw it was suspicious and checked the ips. Matched it to a good farmer and unbanned the acc. He logged back on and it was at greendrags chillin
---
i mean more why has it been stable for a few months and in the past 2 days dropped nearly 50 million, to me anyway it doesn't make sense if that's the reason

You can store full sets of armor like rune trimmed in your poh. If you can stack caskets like this and unlock them all at once you have a higher chance of being able to Complete a set.

Depends how you want to play your account but main accounts tend to turn into vork simulator, if you need a staff of the dead you aren't going to go zammy to get it, you are going to go vorkath and buy it. The process more or less breaks down into; is this better gp than vork? no, then do vork. Skilling? I need 99 crafting, do i blowglass or do I do battlestaffs and use the time saved to do vork? etc.
---
What the hell I forgot that game existed and you should‚Äôve too
---
I don't think we're saying, "make these an additional option" we're saying, "change the slayer helmets to look like this."
---
Yeah I know. I‚Äôve been doing a little research. I should like base 70‚Äôs in combat before some real bossing.
---
Not really the point. You can still get the gear yourself if you really want.
---
Soup made this
---
Use overloads lol
---
obviously i was talking about the hydra slayer helm...
---
Im calling it, OP is a 10hp ironman

Cant think of any othe reason why youd want 5 x 5hp + energy restore in the game
---
200 int, a true Brainchad.
---
Ahh okay. So at 93 hp I should switch?
---
why?
---
Lmao
---
Theyve said it's something they'd like to make but its not in active development. Dont expect it anytime soon.
---
I mean they could do a poll to find out if the player base wants it, rather than just SAYING, some of the players would prefer them how try are now. It is kinda the whole reason we have polling in the game.
---
Well what's the point of completing legends quest when you can just charge glories on the heroes guild which is really easy to access

Well, it depends on how capable you are of making 50m every single day for 200 days.

??? The Legends' Guild was added to the game in 2003. It was iconic back in the day, but there has been plenty added to the game that addresses your concerns since. For a 16 year old piece of content I think it's okay if it's not meta defining anymore.
---
Yea my friend who just started tattooing a few months ago did it, definitely could‚Äôve been better but knew the risks with letting him do it lol. Atleast it was cheap and could be touched up to look better in the future

---
Most efficient masters however are elite clue from dragon imps, with hard medium and easy from other clues. drag imps alone are like 400k so yeah.

Until someone says "can't you just force it open" and your whole defence crumbles...

If the ornament kit is untradeable and super rare then ok
---
I wish I had a job where all I had to say was a two word excuse to not have to do hard work.
---
I would recommend using a zerker ring at demonics
---
well then if the hydra helm can have extra prongs without extra polygons, so can these.
---
your friend lied to you, and then make you look like a dumbass by posting on his behalf because he knows he lied to you
---
Inefficient bruh

Have a plan to kill everyone you meet.

you do have to imagine that they were just regular people and players being given a somewhat overwhelming amount of attention. the old nite was a nice older man so he was in a good spot mentally i think to be able to thrive and be a positive influence on people and the community when given a little bit of that attention. i know he was a big influence on me and how i treated other people as a bit of a shithead kid, especially being pretty high level so having people ask me questions about the game and stuff semi-frequently.
---
you have to understand the perspective of zezima where you have to get friends to even do trades for you, can't really meet people without them building up some weird idea of you in their head, etc. just trying to play the game and you have a flash mob forming around going crazy would get old really fast changing how you can play a game and interact with a community that was a big part of your life. i remember him being around gladz a few times and him not being happy when people randomly killed him for no reason because omg itz zezima or some dumb kid thing.
---
the community, especially among the "high level community" was a lot different and a lot better and it makes me sad to see how far we've degraded over time. this pic made me happy &amp; brought back some precious childhood memories

You need prayer for it so you can‚Äôt stay lvl 3

I recently came back after like 8 months, what hats are you referring to?
---
what happened? Did you miss one trawler and decide to come and bitch on reddit? I can assure you my ping is way worse than yours, and I never have this problem. Just get in position and spam click. As long as you begin fixing it before it has been fixed, you will get the the activity.
---
 Not creepy at all lmfao
---
good riddance to bad rubbish
---
The same.

this
---
A nice reminder he is a human too
---
No preference really.
---
Would be pretty cool if the helm would morph into this style as soon as you drink a potion or something similar.
---
What the fuck were they thinking with the elite reqs? The only reason ill never have the elite done.
---
Nah, almost all of their games are updated rather regularly. DF and AQW receive weekly updates.
---
I think the prayer xp earned from the other quests you have to do, doesnt allow you to stay level 3
---
What‚Äôs a MA2 cape?

They're working on porting their games over to mobile iirc. AQW Mobile is in active development, AQ3D is cross platform currently, and I believe mobile DF and AQ are things they have planned for the future.

He took credit for something that he really did very little to accomplish. The real reason we have OSRS servers is because the private servers were booming and jagex was trying to protect and cash in on their intellectual property. The idea that they did it because some racist rando youtuber made a moderately successful video and petition is laughable.

I don‚Äôt know about the 3rd rune, but I would at least bring nats and fires, since pretty much every slayer task you get drops alchables once you get to a decent level. Maybe save the 3rd spot for rune drops to save an extra space
---
Do thugs no longer drop clue scrolls? I have ring of wealth i and didn‚Äôt get one clue in over 200 kills
---
Must be nice, some of us miss almost every click if we are not paying attention. Luckily I find agility to be fun.

Just get the skills you need for the quests. It's not really that complicated.

Open the legit RS website and set up 2 factor authentication instantly. Also set it up for your email if you haven't already. Then get a bank pin in the game.

Not until jegflox upgrades their ancient archaic servers. Maybe in a few years they will write a newspost considering upgrading it and then never following through.

That's gleam giveaways for you in a nutshell
---
Or that women are just manipulative. I think woman don't understand the concept of consent and that you can't revoke it after the fact. As in if he's nutted and left the house and you suddenly regret you had sex that's not rape. That's a bad life decision.
---
And hard and above require a PvM fight
---
So if it‚Äôs not about cost, you made a post just to complain that you thought you had a day remaining but you don‚Äôt?
---
nah, it'll encourage people to skill and quest. Sounds good to me
---
An $11 meme*

If you look at a picture of Sergio, his legs are pretty much identical to this, except for more muscle tone. And yes, everyone can gain weight if they stuff themselves with a McDonald's supreme 3x a day. However, most people aren't eating 2500+ calories a day and doing jack shit. Most people eat under that and do little to moderate exercise. Now, depending on your bodies metabolic rate, you may gain weight or you may not. Now, I see you mentioned that metabolism is mostly a myth? Did you read a Vox article? Metabolism is the inorganic/organic chemical processes and or mechanisms that occur within the body. One of the procceses is how your body burns (converts to energy) fat and calories. Some people convert it quickly and some do not. The faster you can convert it, the less fat and calories in your body. That metabolism can play a crucial role in weight gain. Now, another factor (this is a genetic factor for muscle growth) is your myostatin level. This protein limits myogenesis in the body, which means some people can cap out and have an extremely hard time building muscle. Although studies show consistent weight lifting overtime can reduce the levels, for a skinny guy with a high level of myostatin, this can take a fuck load of time to actually get muscular. Before I write a thesis, you cannot just say someone is unhealthy because they are skinny, that's not how any of this works.
---
I just want an ornament kit which gets rid the the spines on the top. I love my Black Slayer Helm but dislike the grey spines
---
Yep, they count as a potion rather than a piece of food so you don't lose a game tick, similar to supers and prayer pots
---
I refreshed the wrong tab lol nice try though bud
---
Bring the pain jamflex
---
Thank you, Mod Ash!

Ended up taking like 450-470 kills so it's even worse than that
---
I'd say Hard Clues are around Master Quest level. Both are rather mid-game as far as requirements go. But MEP2 specifically probably could have been Elite or Master. Still, Hard Clues require you to go to Ape Atoll, Piscatoris, Isafdar, and Kharazi Jungle, all of which are part of or locked behind Master Quests. So having one Cecilia clue require a Master Quest with the rest being lower tier seems pretty consistent.
---
You can do that it's just not user friendly.
---
More like 700% cost efficiency. Gilded is better xp/h
---
yeah she turns to look at you then returns to that position lol
---
It's simply not worth for just the visage. DFS is such a useless item tbh. Very niche. The supplies you get during the grind are the good part, but even then it's MOSTLY just gp that you're gunna use for gold bar smithing.
---
Yep!
---
I'm not the one crying that the front page isn't perfectly catered to me
---
E
---
O
---
The quest difficulties are extremely outdated. MEP2 is not a hard quest. I‚Äôm sure it was before guides, but provided you have the skill and quest requirements already its a 30-45 minute quest. 
---
That being said, I don‚Äôt see any issues with it being a hard clue req.
---
If you talk someone into sex and they consent that's not rape.  Kinda like if a car salesman gets you to buy a car and you weren't really into it, its still on you.  The argument you just made wouldn't fly in any court or legal proceeding.

See which style you can get the highest accuracy bonus with your gear, cannons accuracy isn‚Äôt just always based off ranged bonus. It‚Äôs based of your highest offensive bonus.

All that to say that a warriors ring (I) might end up helping more than the archers, but idk what hear you have access to
---
Cant tell without you telling us your stats or character name

---
The scammer changes the amount and clicks accept both in the same tick that the victim presses accept so it instantly switches to the second screen.
---
This could be avoided if Jagex added a 2tick delay (a little over 1 second) before you can accept a trade after a change but that's not gonna happen.

If you have fally shield 4, replace coins with that. If not, I'd take another bastion potion for waves 55 and up.

People clearly aren't able to avoid these scams effectively, otherwise the scammers would stop trying.
---
Saying "lol get smarter" is great until 95% of the playerbase doesn't use this subreddit and never reads it.

Jagex can build systems that limit scamming and have minimal impact -- almost no one spec trades, and *as I said before* it's worth it to prevent scams -- on other aspects of the game.
---
when you make a meme on reddit and you can't be assed to slap it into paint tool to crop it
---
The scammer uses AHK so it‚Äôs tick perfect, their are various YouTube videos on scrips for AHK scamming.
---
He deliberately puts up more cash than what was advertised so OP expects him to change it thus it will be blinking read anyway. The AHK works in that it changes it twice, every quickly so that the timing is the same as when OP clicks accept when he acknowledges the advertised price is shown.

Pretty good reward IMO....

Look up what skills/quests you need and do them.

This is the case for a lot of items, like clue scrolls, where you can only have 1 at once. It‚Äôs likely that they store information based on that item and wouldn‚Äôt be possible to have a placeholder for it.

So you're saying it's bad for it to be a challenge for players? You either grind out your actual tasks at a normal rate and feel proud af of it when you get it, or you go spam 1-9s and hammer out your 10th for good points.

Yes, I completely agree.

Not really. Now I'm not saying that any skill is particularly hard, I'm just saying fire cape isn't much of an achievement anyways. I wouldn't say theres any development in doing it. Not trying to offend you or anyone. That's like saying theres development in doing hunter for clicking on a box trap because it's caught something. Congrats, you can click on something when you need to. Fight caves really only takes an hour and pretty much most people have a firecape.

you can try them both and see which you like better.

As other have said, do slayer and train up your stats for bosses. That is where the money is.
---
But that will only train your combat stats. You need to have a well rounded account to really make money. That's where clue scrolls come in. Do as many clue scrolls as you can. If you don't have the requirements for a step, get that requirement. This will train all of your other stats, along with giving many chances of good loot.

Friendly reminder no one wants HD graphics and that the graphics of OSRS are what give the game its charming appeal.

Are you talking about Mattis? The quote was taken from a period during his command in Iraq durig the post invasion insurgency. Essentially, he was telling his marines to remain professional but have a plan in case of ambush.  It was taken out of context and became a meme.  From everything Ive seen about Mattis, he seems like the opposite of a "psychopath" - he cared about his people first.

You mean import into a program that would generate it in-game for you

This is probably why I'm never going to be hardcore into pking. I don't want to have to worry about keeping a certain combination of stats for x, y, or z build or combat level, and I don't want to make a second account just to play that part of the game.

yes, you can use the viggoras chainmace at 60 attack and has the same stats and speed as a dragon scimmy outta wildy without any quest requirements.  you don't need ether in it to swing it like a bbc at your ex either =) hope that helps. its also bis 60 attack crush training for crabs

GGs already drop granite gloves, so combining them with power of the holy wraps unleashes their imbued Saradominist power that's been latent in the area since Saradomin took control of Morytania. Perhaps a better name would have been "devout gloves/gauntlets" to

go with the boots.

You're gonna get my ip and contact my isp? Lmfao.

Ok, thanks for the reply. Whip is just a little bit out of my price range atm but the sara sword is in my reach. Should I just go for it?
---
Just becuase they cant obtain an inferno cape doesn't make the fire cape BiS for them. Inferno cape is still BiS even for people who can't obtain it

Why would Prayer Armor upgrade to Tank Armor? It is like saying Holy Sandals should turn into Guardian Boots... But I wouldn't mind a Holy Wrap upgrade to bring on par with Devout Boots and I would like to see some Tank Gloves to counterpart Guardian Boots, but those are separate things.

Discusting

TL;DR, you think Mattis is a psychopath, from things you've inferred from pieces of his personality. 
---
I'm going to assume you haven't met the man, and don't know many Marines. I'll also take a big guess and say that you are very unclear of the culture within the Marine Corps, seeing as you have such "disdain". If I'm wrong, so be it.
---
Generals and officers often don't care about their individuals to the degree Mattis did. Many of the Marines operating under him enjoyed his command, which is pretty rare. Also, if you do have an inkling about combat, I'd assume you'd have better context in regards to his words.
---
I'd also like to understand what you're referring to in regards to "biggest tragedies". 
---
And in regards to most of his kind.. That's a broad sweeping stroke if I've ever seen one. Gonna assume you're anti-military in general as well. 
---
Also, in closing, having actually met the man, I think he's a great guy, from the conversations he had with us, he definitely fills out the educated warrior piece extremely well. So, I think you're talking out of your ass.
---
Meh I'm fine with them as they are now, I've unlocked all 6 about a mill and a half past 99 slayer.
---
Ah, weird..
---
Thank you God Ash
---
Holy wraps = prayer armour
---
Granite gloves = "tank" armour
---
Holy wraps + granite gloves = prayer/tank armour
---
Christ, no offense, but the stingers on the Kalphite Queen slayer helmet make me not want to get it at all. Make this toggleable at least.
---
This would be super against the rules these days. Essentially any script that moves your mouse, rather than rebinding a button, can get you in trouble
---
I also think there are too many memes, but at least these are entertaining.

How many scoviles?
---
Yup. One chin is all you need. Throw it once they‚Äôve all arrived and it should Agro them all. They have a really far range too.
---
Correct. My attorney issued the subpoena to reddit today that includes requests for identifying information and any data they may have that has been publicly deleted. You have slandered me publicly and it has been a detriment to my brand.
---
okayy cool! thank you! :)
---
That's my point though, if you get a task of say 50 or 120 or whatever you're going to want to do them a lot more than hundreds on hundreds at a time
---
50/50
---
Absolutely tell him. The steel halberd is a terrible weapon.
---
But I fucking love anchovies, especially on pizza
---
go view my post before yours on the thread lol... gz
---
Anyone got tips for learning how to do raids 1 without any knowledge at all? Can I find ffa/mass raids so I can learn without being a complete burden to the team? Thanks
---
Plenty of people do novice, just depends on the time you're doing it.
---
If some people here join you, awesome. Otherwise try 6 PM GMT
---
Lmao okay
---
Technically speaking yeah. ‚ÄúAttainable BiS‚Äù and BiS are two different things though.
---
He spared my life once at the rune rocks back in Classic when my brother and I were pking on our alts. Such a humble guy may he rest in peace
---
Chaos is better XP with noted bones, especially if not using your own house.
---
Dragon claws or dragon dagger for damage
---
SGS if you need sustain 
---
Bgs or dwh if fighting a high defence boss

#sub70 pray...
---
Sorry you cant all buy 70 prayer on an ironman...
---
Has that ever stopped this sub before?
---
I'm UK based and because its a high ping world for me I really suffered. You're probably clicking relatively fast, just being beaten to it by the natives. Try a less popular time.
---
Upvoted
---
If you consider Granite Gloves Tank Armor, you have pretty low standards. And wrapping some holy cloth around rocks doesn't make it Justiciar... Nor does it make it a good idea for the reason I outlined in the previous post.
---
Very true. Op never mentioned attainable though.
---
Imagine complaining about clicking on a game that's literally all clicking. Go play A different game
---
Check out the We Do Raids discord, they have mentors there that will teach you (for free, and split any drops where a split would be &gt; 1m)
---
yeah, the obscure areas
---
Tough
---
I was banned...
---
Same here dude, more than 100m though I think. I went from 75-99 range there, didn't get visage. Gave up, got it on task randomly weeks later.
---
People say it's not worth the grind, but those supplies you get are godly.
---
Yup, buy an SS now and sell it when you can afford a whip imo
---
Incorrect, they locked the account permanently at the request of his family. No one can ever log onto it again.
---
Do something impressive like get a darklight
---
Nothing interesting happens...
---
Love it
---
you just took all the xp?
---
honk!
---
If you haven't already, look into mage only. It is easier on the resources and easier for multiple kills in my opinion. There are plenty of guides out there, a quick Google should be able to set you up for success.
---
I can get 3 to 4 kills with toxic trident and decent mage gear.
---
Very easily
---
I like how people create memes like this, and once Jagex does something they want, they create another meme about something else. The community can't be happy and just play the game. It's sad that OSRS has become a game of bitching instead of a nostalgic game that we play for fun.
---
thank you my dude
---
Thank You Mod Ash
---
&gt;Tench is much more common than the joint, joint is much more rare and harder to get, there are only few in a game, the price is also way bigger, as obby you're already risking way more than your combat levels, add the joint and the new manacles and your risk increases even more, i'd say it's a fair thing, i even think it should be easier to obtain, as easy as a tench, not as hard as it is rn.
---
Nice idea, yeah I know chompies are aids as hell, so they would a nice as hell quality of life
---
Justiciar is incredibly shit at mage defence so idk why you gave em +8 mage def when the other items give negative bonuses.
---
344.
---
nice
---
It's flexscape
---
Switch your varrock tele to take you direct to GE, you'll never go back
---
Also have a portal in my house closet to the ornate pool and entrance portal
---
haha me too! search when I look for anything lol
---
#100k #happy #fuckoff
---
World 344, never not gotten a game
---
Alright, was just a bit worried that the 3 d scims were just as rare as some other item, akin to the 3 cabbages being as rare as the 3rd age table. Thanks.
---
Guthans are a life saver. You dont have to worry about wasting and saving brews for the later waves. 70 pray you'll be good man just remember when jad does a tall stomp its mage and a quick stomp its range. Dont go by the sounds, it makes so much harder
---
Suicide to lumbridge then walk to GE
---
Yeah, I also stopped typing while trading and stuff. So all they did was see me type it a bit and muted me, wasn't reasonable by any means. It is kind of shady though that someone can shadow mute you, without reason, or notification.
---
Is it bugged though? I have done hundreds of runs on attas and I tend to get 9-12 herbs per seed. (99 farm, max Cape, and all herb-boosting diaries)
---
Oh shit. Fixed.
---
Restores restore more prayer and are cheaper until about 50 prayer and even after that they are just marginally more expensive.

We have chosen to run this giveaway as a give back to the users and subscribers of the website as a celebration for our 3 year anniversary, and as a thank you to those that have supported us.
---
We are not aware of this breaching RWT and we ensure that we, and by extension, our Discord community, do not break official game rules. If you can find an official post stating that this is against the rules, then we will remove the premium element of the giveaway, and refund users that have subbed and immediately entered into the raffle.

*The fact that you've made this post, yet chosen to enter is frankly quite pathetic.*

I use ddp and God's word, I switch

Dude what do you even mean ham is tradable while tench is not.
---
This ones kinda trash sorry bud
---
If you are a pure use a dscim, if you are a main stop doing crabs
---
I've done over 1500 and never had Sandals... what an item to go dry on
---
Spend lamps on RC. Herblore is also meta for ironmen.
---
Someone in my clan chat said stupid, but I agree. I was a very bad guy buying all that ess. :(
---
You ever get rug burn?  Shit feels better when they‚Äôre clean shaved its not even a question.  I dont mind a little landing strip on top but anything thats gonna affect my stroke gotta go

Too early to post this. Wait for a fuck up first THEN you post crab rave

Ah shit, here we go again

East is now west

People sold their shit to flex frog slippers at the g.e,

Killed over 4k goblins and all I got was like 50 begginer clues. Was trying to farm easy clues... I dont think they drop them anymore. Just one more way for jagex to waste hours of my life.
---
I like to use both sound and visual. It the sound starts when he lifts, it mage, if it‚Äôs quiet when he lifts its range.
---
I‚Äôd bring a few more range pots
---
Because God Ash said so in a tweet
---
Let us know how your first attempt at a screenshot goes, brother!

This is what I use to barrows with:
---
Armor: Dragon chainmail, dragon plate legs, neitiznot, dragon boots, glory, combat bracelet, god cape
---
Weapons: Iban staff, rune crossbow with Broad bolts. Scimmy for normal mobs
---
Varrock Diary &gt; Rune Pouch, combination runes.

    Real-world trading is the term used for activities which occur outside of the game environment which result in the real-world sale or purchase of items, GP or services with the intention of supplying or advancing a Jagex in-game character other than by the means that are incorporated into the game.  
---
  
---
It is clear that a real-world purchace of a subscription to ge-tracker results in advancing an in-game character, namely providing them with a large amount of in-game currency or an expensive item.  
---
The fact that the purchase only results in a chance at the item, and not the item itself, is not enough to get around this rule. For instance, what if a RWT site sold a 99% chance at getting 1m, for a 10% discount on their normal price? This would clearly still be against the rules.  
---
The fact that the giveaway can be accessed for free also does not bypass the rule. For instance, what if a RWT site gave away 1m to someone for every 100m they sold on their website? Or gave away 1m for free to a random person who signs up, but gave people 1000x the chance of winning for a small fee. This would clearly still be against the rules.
