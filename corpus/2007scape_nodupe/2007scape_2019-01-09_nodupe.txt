&gt;Yes. Where do you think melee gear from bronze to rune comes from?

---
Slayer drops.

iloveash6969

That's a fair opinion I can accept

First time I killed jad was on task. I got the 25k slayer exp but died to the healers.. No firecape. 
---
Holy shit

Same üòÇ

I've found the best way to casually get levels up is to plant herbs for farming and use those to make potions. You make a profit with prayer pots, which you can start doing at exactly your level.

Called shit posting. You new to the runescape community?
---
I have a broken right hand currently which means RuneScape is literally all I can do, it‚Äôs great 
---
Figured out what it was.... there is an anvil where I specified in rs3. When they made osrs they pulled from an earlier time then they added the anvil. So there was one... in another time. God I've played this game too long

It isn't a job.

Really cool method. Thanks for sharing :)

By that logic if you ever trade anyone not through the GE you can be banned.
---
For this reason I eventually invented another version using "q p" as a kid, which works the same way with one space less. It never caught on.
---
Log into the same place in rs3 lol it's there. That's why I remembered it. Came in a 2010 update which is why it is not in osrs
---
You're right, it's not a job but a career.  Thanks for clarifying that for me.  People use it as their primary income source which makes it much more than a hobby. 
---
Or just pay for sex.

why do people bitch when they get lucky drop....be thankful goblin boy

This is what I did, i get stupidly high stats before questing because i hated questing. Doing the quests felt really easy and fun when you over-leveled.

It was ‚Äúni plus gger‚Äù before

Sounds pretty delicious if you ask me
---
Awesome

no
---
That was a comment
---
It's about every seven levels the xp required doubles, same thing, but easier to do in your head I think.
---
106 = 26m xp (about)
---
113 = 52m xp
---
120 = 104m xp
---
127 = 208m xp

They basically did a roll back of the gsme updates in 2013 all the way back to 2007, and have updated parts since then.

So graphics that were part of RS2 (what you remember) aren't all here, but we have new stuff. When RS3 came out other changes to the game happened that people didn't like but that's where everyone's old account is.

I'm not sure you are aware but usually people censor their own user names not the other users. This is mostly a meme but you might accidently have leaked personal recovery information. The point is to not link your runescape account with your reddit account. Other users have no such risk.

Is it possible to get an untrimmed slayer cape?

Wow. 1st world homelessness sounds like an enigma in that case.

Your original account is most likely a RuneScape 3 account if it‚Äôs the one you played from your childhood. This version of the game, although old, is actually relatively new. You will need to restart from scratch.

How much money do you have? Bursting is such insane xp/hour that using preserve and boosting your level to cast burst would let you get from 66-70 in probably less than an hour. If you have cash, buy an imbued heart to do the boosting. Either way, use preserve prayer.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you don't want to do that, remember that you can alch while doing combat or agility or hunter or a bunch of other things, so it breaks the monotony of both bank alching and the monotony of those other skills. 
---
Then you'd just mute your phone? 
---
Hi, I just recorded [this](https://youtu.be/ziLqqVdAF_c) video, should show that it works decently. I'll just say that the bag etc icons can be a bit fiddly due to how small they are but it's not too bad for me. 
---
100% agree with world hopping point, however the duel arena is one of my favourite clues. I love that it's in the arena, such an interesting touch! Clues shouldn't just be easy locations. E.g another favourite clue is to wear a black d hide on Entrana, but the only way to do that is with high enough crafting to make your own since you can't bring armour to the island. Clever placements like that are great!

Nobody says a friend. Good.

Yesss please would be so much nicer

its stupid not to

I surely preferred the old style.  I don't really give a damn what the location is, but I do kind of wish they would've preserved that style of the game.  I'd say that what we have today is objectively a higher-skill iteration of it, but for me it just doesn't feel as fun.  I was an absolute fiend for edgeville pking in 2007.  If they would've just left it roughly like that and maybe just found some way to "codify" the idea of not safing, I'd have been a happy man.

First off imagine using Facebook in 2019. "Nerd war" what? There are posts on here all the time about people having their name changed. Congratulations on your small amount of attention bud. Glad you got your fix LOL seems like you really need it.

You are an obnoxious person. I hope you're proud of yourself, as I can't imagine someone else to be.

Yes forcing people. There is no reason pvp should be involved in clues. Nothing about going on a hunt to dig up treasure makes me think of killing other players. Telling people they have to go kill a player before finishing a step is exactly that.

 You're out of range at the start, i'd find that weird to not be intended but whatever. I'm saying it because without that you couldn't dodge the head as easily and you'd have to lose a lot of dps.

But i agree there's no real abusing going on. The moving of olm head was't supposed to make people invulnerable but more to not attack the whole team at a time but still moving to where most people are.

I always took it as also a testament to inducing innocent people who don't know the know to ask what's a q p? And then you dastardly get them with the aligning the W just like back in 2004, some things never change, and probably never should.

Been playing runescape for about 15 years now and maybe I can answer some questions you may have. When it comes to quest it depends on what your goals are. For example, if you want to cook I would recommend working towards completing the quest Family Crest to get the Cooking Gauntlets. For me I dove straight into combat/slayer, so I did some quest to boost up my combat stats a bit, completed Lost City and Monkey Madness to unlock some dragon weaponry. A good quest to work towards would be Recipe for Disaster to unlock the BIS gloves. List goes on and on.

People still used f keys and bridded back in the day, switching was just broken back then. It was in early osrs too, but they fixed it.

at that point, your channel should not rely on small tutorials like that as their source of income, but as additional content that makes their channel grow.
---
be honest, if you just want to know how to get to a clue when you can't figure it out from the wiki, do you want to sit through some dude sitting there for 12 minutes blabbering on about bullshit or do you want someone to just show you how to do the clue?
---
Those accounts could be alt accounts. Alot of people make new level 3s and just afk smith cannonballs with mats from their mains.

That, or entangle or an ice spell and a bit of food. You'll only get hit once by the melee brothers when they first appear, so you won't take that much damage if you pray against Karil and Ahrim. Definitely doable as a pure.

If you make a f2p account for f2p pking your at a massive dis advantage.

I recently went pking on my mates account who made it purely in f2p and 9/10 people you fight have trained there account on members which allows them to cannon there range and use other method for strength training which gives them no hp exp. Making them much higher stats for the same combat lvl.

Good a calculator, tell you everything youneed to know , GE prices, gp per xp , profit/loss margins

Ok so you enabled tap to drop, dropped some gear you wanted to equip and then didn‚Äôt notice the gear was on the ground or not on your character? Being unaware of your actions isn‚Äôt the games fault.

perhaps u were brewed down to 0 stats and u didnt actually kill a cyclops and u just wasted 3k tokens inside

ayy I got one today too. Feels good
---
Shut up, Serene. 
---
Aw man you're so close. Keep going dude :D to be honest I did efficient quests, basically the ones that helped me with stats and stuff first. So I trained a bunch of like thieving, agility, anything that was really good EXP or had little requirements + gave exp I did those just because they boosted stats really high from level 1. Then I just went with all the quests that were the shortest/easiest, and I used the quick guides from the wiki. It was actually really easy. Surprisingly too, I didn't have many difficult quests or a hard time doing RFD even at level 70. My melee stats sucked, as did my range &amp; mage lol. 
---
The most annoying quest surely had to be underground pass..and that one just sucks ass regardless. Oh btw, make sure to choose quests you'll need in the future too. It's worth doing quests that you know you'll need down the road as well, cause then it feels like 2 birds with 1 stone. So make sure to do all of those, and then what's left over just find any novice/short ones left :P.

Also have thought this. Sounds more like a runelite plugin though

But that's the same thing as pking at ge!

but why blow it on torsos instead of gambles

Dude that quest dialog was actually so enjoyable. The part where you're getting on the boat was fucking hilarious. 
---
Because that's what pking at GE is for
---
You can kill kbd, but it'll suck and you won't really make money
---
you spam until level 5 then just place food on the traps and afk 
---
Look for stuff with high buy limits, around 10k.  Darts, bolts, arrows, raw materials like ores or dhides.  Find something with a few gp margin.  Margins go up on higher priced items that need more capitol investment, so move to higher priced items when you have more cash.
---
I can usually get a 5+ gp margin if I leave it in for a little while.  Optimally you can make 50k on a mil investment every 4 hours and do that with a couple different items.  Look at the percent you are making on the flip as well as the margin.  You can get 25% flipping fire runes but like 1% flipping zulrah scales.  With only 11m you will need to prioritize high percent over high margin.
---
Dude didnt even say his name right
---
I grind if it will help pk. Like hard wilderness diary and kandarin. Along with 86 agility for rev shortcut. But deep wild pking, i use rune gloves cause its cheaper so i dont have a huge incentive to get b gloves. But I will

I think I used somewhere around 150 pies, so it was only about 6 banking trips and didn't factor too much into the time.
---
For me, I found Ardougne much faster than Rellekka. I could get around 58k xp an hour without paying much attention. It also seemed like I failed a lot less at Ardougne
---
Seers probably would have been best, but I didn't feel like doing BA for the hard requirement
---
Splashing is a very slow but very AFK way to train magic. 
---
The principal is that if you intentional lower your magic equipment bonus you will never hit your opponent, you will "splash" every attack.
---
Doing this allows you to not kill your target, and thus stay in combat for a very long time, up to 20 minutes. 
---
If you want details on how to do it look up a guide on youtube. 
---
There's bots for quests as well just saying
---
Wow!! Blast from the past! 
---
No clans are already op at revs
---
You seem triggered by it
---
Better that way than rs3, all bankers all worlds yelling "60m drop party at falador party room world X!"

---
This photo has a musky basement smell to it.
---
Tard. Just pick it back up
---
Awesome are you going to paint it?
---
What's that thing on the right, Avocado = 6? 
---
You get xp from casting spells even if you don't hit, so if you don't hit and attack an enemy that never hits you you can AFK basically forever.
---
To never hit you need -65 magic attack bonus. That means full metal with a kiteshield and goblin staff. Goblin staff gives +0 magic bonus but lets you autocast. At 40 range you can use d'hide vambraces which give -10 magic bonus so you can use elemental staves.
---
Plot twist, this was actually written in 2018 and OP was in a grad program.

This needs to be polled

Ouch. Just got 99 wc and no pet, hope it doesn't take to 80m exp for me too. Gratz dude

I was so excited about it as a kid, and so heartbroken when jagex never got back to me lol

youre both losers

I was 8 when I started playing Runescape.
---
I didn't know what high or low detail was so I thought I was picking whether or not I wanted to play as a human or a skeleton. 
---
And for some bizarre reason I thought the "MHz CPU" was your starting HP. So I thought skeleton was just better than human starting with 200 more HP. 
---
These kind of things where normal back in the day
---
I was so excited about this as a kid, and so heartbroken when jagex never got back to me. Thinking of it now, my mom probably never sent it to them. Lol

Alright, thanks.

I don't think someone with the name fuckyourmumcunt2 making a very trolly comment is someone you try and engage with.

Well when did you start playing? I know for a fact that F keys weren't in the game when I started playing 2004/5. I do remember them coming out later on but since they were only for function keys I never used them.

Why would you high alch? 1-click drop or 0-time cooking xp for using a knife on leaping fish, which also reduces the # of items to drop. Either way it‚Äôs much faster than alching fish.
---
Wasn't that simple, sadly. I was at work, ran in game to where I was going to train and logged out until I could get back on, and didn't realize until I logged back in later.

RAM is meant to be utilized. Chrome "eats" it to be faster. It's instantly freed up the instant its needed.

Sure. But It seems to me like a couple of gigs is a lot of caching relative to what's going on. I'm sure it has something to do with js sandboxing and loading a new copy of the js engine for every tab but it just screams inneficient.

Impressive. My fifth grade self knew that the only way I was going to get free stuff from people was pretending to be a girl. My name was Kukene. All the boys would say ‚Äúhey kukene‚Äù. My boyfriend at the time decked me out in full bronze, And I felt like I was on top of the world. 200 K is a lot of money, especially back then. I remember one of my fifth-grade friends had 456K and we had a conversation for about an hour at one of our sleepovers if he should buy mystic armor. Then me, him, and his brother proceeded to play caatlewars until the early am. And I still remember the feeling of seeing my friends brother with a dragon longsword and being fucking amazed how far he had progressed into the game. Oh man, it was such a simpler time.
---
Is that a üêù?
---
I don't own ranger
---
All you're talking about is xp rates and not how afk it actually is. I specifically said I agree that the xp rates are much higher on rs3 and that I'm talking about pure afk-ability of these skills. 
---
When I mean afk-ability I meant actually not having to do anything for x amount of time in a row. Having to do any clicking doesn't count as afk anymore. Using an inv of fish for cooking takes like 30 seconds, right? That's 30 seconds of afk. It doesn't matter if it takes 2 seconds to refill the inv and keep going. That's shit I have to do and it means it's not afk. I can't just leave the screen to go make a sandwich or whatever, because it'll stop doing that shit. The term afk stands for away from keyboard. If I can't be away from the keyboard for more than 1,5 minutes, it's not really that afk for shit.
---
&gt;crystalize acadia trees to 94 which involves clicking every minute

Also this part...how do you click every minute when crystalize lasts 30 seconds? lol

One of the bigger wastes of my time today and I trained runecrafting earlier
---
Tbow is under 1.1 
---
I'd support this tbh.
---
It's not a spell. The description sounds like the special attack of the dark bow, a ranged weapon. 
---
I start around first weeks jan 2001, towards end of 2000 there was a social chat site called chathou\*\*\*.com blurred out some of the text not sure if adverstising here is  .   
---
I was around 12-13 age my friend on there said there is this game thats launched called runescape and when I first got on I had no idea what the spells/skills did.  
---
 I logged off after about 20 mins or so ingame. Didnt login for about 1 week then I started again made some friends specially with The Sabre clan. Then I got addicted to the game lol  
---
I remember just making Ranger accounts which had lvl 10 ranged I think to start with and arrows and a bow. while Adventurer started with Axe,tinderbox etc. Not sure what the melee was called Warrior or something but they started out with bronze long and wooden shield. while magic started out with runes.  
---
I made multiple accounts of each just to stack pile all their loot into 1 account took many hours but I had over 500 arrows and enough runes for some combat time.  
---
Little did I know you could be attacked anywhere, I died and lost everything so I made around 200 arrows (20 accounts) this time and logged off when I see someone or if someone attacked me.  
---
After they implented Lumbridge only safe zone. and you couldnt log off in combat anymore which sucked I really liked it lol.  
---
Good times so many memories but will be a massive wall of text :P
---
I dont use runelite. Not sure what the benefit is, but for all bosses they always give you a kc and drop in the chat. I also wish every monster had it. As a F2P this prob the best spot to use all my rng lmao. My goal is to beat F2P as an iron, meaning getting every possible drop. At least the drops that matter, then quests, and mace gear for each discipline of fighting, then I'm going members. I'm pretty close atm. 
---
Give him Reddit Silver then, c'mon man
---
collection log you can get it from a npc in varrock musieum

Thanks!
---
I remember I once received 500k in needles in one drop. Who collects that many needles??
---
That happened later on for me and my school. I remember thinking i was so cool with 60 str and an obby maul in 5th grade. I wore a black snelm helmet and full black armor. Few years later I was getting made fun of for playing, but fuck it I'm still playing pretty much 10 yrs later
---
It's funny that the pro-MTX argument (that is even made and upvoted on this subreddit) usually is that "i don't have the time I used to have us a kid so I wan't to buy my way to success". But you are in that situation and dislike MTX so thats cool.Nice to see you enjoying the game.

Yes
---
I recommend trying it out. If you want to be efficient and sink a lot of time into slayer, I recommend waiting until later.
---
I personally barely touched it until I had 65 ranged and a cannon. Then I got to 55 slayer for broad bolts.
---
Now I'm saving up about 20m and unlocking ancient magic. I plan to use a cannon or ice burst on every task I can and blow money until I unlock a few decent slayer monsters.

Scythe is not useful in the inferno in any way. The melee inferno was just an additional challenge, and in no ways efficient or even easy

I don't look at another stat on non iron accounts, if you're 100+ combat chatting shit to me with 50 con get the fuck outta my face

Essentially why the blowpipe isn't 50m as well. I honestly think they should nerf standard gmaul and add an enchantment type drop to GGs. Spices up pvp, adds value to dead content, devalues gmaul only skulltrick iron men (/s). No downsides.

I do like that you keep a log of your activities/thoughts. I hope that you still do this when you play

Pick flax

you probably dont want to do zulrah below like 85 magic on a pure.
---
you *can* do it earlier, you can do it as early as ibans but itll be exceptionally slow and if you dont have a lot of zulrah kc youll have a pretty shit time.
---
Start birdhouses they beat low lvl hunter xp 
---
Neat idea but does clicking on the item picks them all together or one by one? 
---
It doesn't have to be about pride. It makes the game easier and allows people who suck to have an easier time on challenging content, thereby increasing the number of rare items in game and decreasing the prices for people who actually play legit.
---
Not to mention that it removes some of the accomplishment of achieving something when others could have achieved the same thing but with a modded client. It's like paying to get an achievement, except the payment is the use of a non-official client that exists in a grey state of the OSRS rules.
---
so what are you going to investigate exactly?
---
What spell do I unlock at 80?  Also I‚Äôm thinking of transferring my pure into a main (I just got back into the game) once I level my ranged from 76-85

Well when i wanna buy a 30 gp red cape and it doesnt go through after upping the price 10√ó whats normal i just say eff it and offer 100k for a red cape
---
Every main with 200m fm and no phoenix is crying right now
---
the trident is unlocked at level 75 and has a built in attack. however it gets max hits as your magic level goes up so its considerably more effective the higher magic you are.
---
&gt;I cancelled the buying and did not receive the other 124 willow shields it purchased and lost the 4980 coins from the ones I did not receive. Definitely a bug.

you probably withdrew half of them at some point and put them in your bank. the ge didnt steal your stuff.

Came back to the game after Vork so I missed the very cheap days of the DHCB. But I bought for 118mill, smashed out over 1000 kills at Vork and got the pet. Sold for 173mill. Can't wait to buy one back after the crash.

Praying mage doesn't help prevent getting tbed or lowering the chance of the tb landing, it only cuts the time of the tb in half. Assuming he's at west dragons and can't tank it to the ditch, a half tb probably won't make a difference.

How much of this did you grind straight through?  How many breaks did you take to do other stuff? Gz btw.

If you haven't insured it yet you should toss a coin and either insure it or alch it.

It was a test trip, first 2 kills failed, forgot ancients (no blood barrage), off task, forgot def pots, no imbued heart,... I did an off-task trip after and ended on 25 kc with an inv full of food. Was out of prayer because I didn't get any super restores from zammy and I didn't try to save my prayer enough while killing minions.

You're thanking people for ruining the game for you. Also double exp will never be a thing.

Run is fast enough to not need eating sweets. I guess there's always that very small chance you do need that, in that case you can eat 1 sweet instead of doing an attack, or 2 if doing during the 6t delay. But never eat one instead of the west side attack, otherwise zammy wouldn't be flinched and you'd get hit.

Did you restart the game?

I gave up after getting 100% favour there and still not receiving one. Waiting for the diaries to come for better drop rate on them.

Lots of member quests give some very nice starting xp, you can find which quests do give melee xp from wiki but usually its like 10k xp each, sometimes into multiple skills. In members you really wanna get ava's (its a cape slot item) from a quest named animal magnetism, it boosts ur range dmg and saves ur arrows/darts/knives/etc in range combat, you do still lose them but you can save around 50-80% of them depending on which tier ava's you use (theres 3 of them)

Are you

1. looking at the correct game? OSRS does not have chat time stamps, you may be playing the main game which does.
---
2. Using the Runelite client for OSRS? In which case, then you can disable it in the plugin section. its called Chat Timetamps.
---
However it shouldn't be giving you the incorrect time. If your system clock could be wrong, or there might be a bug! If you think its a bug, please send it as bug report on the Github, or in the discord channel.
---
Please no. I can't stand RS3's graphics.  It feels so busy and hard to focus on anything when I load into it.

the rs3 version doesn't even follow the same notes, its rearranged ;/

I know this is an unpopular opinion but those were the good days. It was astronomically harder to be a whale and anything good had to be earned yourself through skilling or bossing. Felt like there was a greater passion in sharing experiences rather than just giving each other shit that is missing in the game.

Just use sticky keys

since we are telling our 2004 stories heres mine: i focused mostly on mining and then I farmed coal until I could get a cannon. then I went and killed rock crabs near freminik village. then I traded my cannon for g trimmed black armor not realizing that shit was worth only like 1/3rd or 1/6th of a cannon and then I quit.

The osrs wiki is the best place for players new and old. If you need any info, look it up there. It's updated often and gives good quest guides.
---
For quests, there is an optimal quest guide order you can follow on wiki. Some notable ones off the bat and were suggested in the guide you brought up include:
---
Priest in peril (unlocks the morytania region) and ghosts ahoy (unlocks the ectophial, an infinite teleport to port phasmatys)
---
Plague city and biohazard (unlocks the ardougne teleport spell) 
---
Tree gnome village (unlocks spirit trees. With a spirit tree at the grand exchange and many more scattered around the world it's a good thing to unlock early on) 
---
Lost city (unlocks the dragon longsword and the fairy city of zanaris) 
---
Fight arena (gives a good deal of attack and thieving XP) 
---
For training options I'm going to refer you to the wiki once again: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pay-to-play_melee_training
---
You'll notice crabs are popular. They have low defence, don't hit often, and have decent hp. Basically walking punching bags. They also don't have any drops. If you want other options, Moss giants and ogres are ok for lower levels with rune equipment.

Also reported you to jagex for RWT.

I think you need to kill the on task hydra for the diary to count. Since u can‚Äôt boost to get the slayer task I don‚Äôt think u will be able to do it.

Could be very wrong about this aswell.

Are you mentally deficient??? That Skotizo was protecting the route to Zeah! Without it we could be in severe peril of attack!

You cant boost to get the task and this is a task only boss. They said no.

You're also capped at 20 characters; the login system just ignores any extra text.

Shit's pretty scuffed, not gonna lie.

Definitely not asap. You SHOULD get superiors, blocklist, task extensions and unlocks beforehand. As that guy said, difference between black mask and slayer helm is marginal at best because it only matters for dust devils, smoke devils and aberrant specters (the latter of which you can just use a salve ammy - if you even do them)
---
Nah. Shilo Village being an absolute cunt to get inside is one of it's most defining features.

It's just a standard hydra you need to kill

Everything shouldn't be changed to left clicks just becuase of mobile. If an npc has a talk option, left click talk to is pretty standard. As far as moving gardeners, polled and failed.

Hi A Friend,

It sucks a bit that you will take all the spotlight for putting this idea on YouTube. And I know multiple people can do the same idea, just bad timing for me..

herblore's a money sink sorry bruthah
---
That is correct. To start adding emblems to the game via pvp one must already have an emblem. In addition wilderness slayer, wilderness monsters in the bounty hunter world also have a chance to drop emblems, even when not on a slayer task.
---
That looks like a chocolat bar?
---
first of all no she doesn't, second of all I'd I'd rather see one.

Weird flex but okay..

Woah, hes alive
---
Yep. Kind of sad since the change was meant to hinder emblem farming, but I guess wilderness slayer was the way jagex intended for ironmen to get bounty hunter rewards.
---
In case you were unaware, the rune pouch can now be bought from the slayer reward shop, so if you don't mind waiting a long time (because it costs 1250 slayer points) you can obtain it that way. As a result, the only thing you really need emblems for is the magic shortbow scroll.

You boost in your house instead of at the clan wars portal. So you‚Äôre right next to whatever it is you‚Äôre looking to build. Boost, don‚Äôt get +5 use pool, boost again. Repeat. Using runelite with the boost timers on just stop boosting when you‚Äôre under like 30 seconds remaining and wait for the next 60 second interval. Might be the pool before ornate, whichever one clears stat debuffs is the one you need.

Because some people stocked up because they wanted people to buy them for a high price now, but it flooded the market.

&gt;OSRS isn‚Äôt the game for it.
---
It's literally the only game for it. It's how Runescape has **always** worked.
---
&gt;There is no other MMO that I have played or even heard of that takes as many hours to obtain high level gear as OSRS does. Ripping away hours and hours of work due to a DC, DDoS, or Jagex‚Äôs incompetence? No thanks. It‚Äôs just not the game for it. 
---
Don't risk your expensive gear in unsafe locations then. They're called 'unsafe' for a reason. 
---
&gt;The old engine, the way osrs plays, it‚Äôs just not the right game for it. Losing everything on death doesn‚Äôt make people ‚Äúhave that sense of risk‚Äù or ‚Äútake lower tiered gear out of fear‚Äù it makes people just avoid the content. The way modern games are styled aren‚Äôt ‚Äúlose everything‚Äù games because game developers have seen that the market doesn‚Äôt WANT that.
---
The market does want it, which is why this game is twice as popular as RS3. 
---
&gt;OSRS is not designed to be a ‚Äúhardcore game.‚Äù And sure, you can say that back in 2007 it was a ‚Äúlose everything‚Äù game, and was still wildly popular, but I‚Äôd argue that the only reason it stayed like it did for awhile because a large portion of the community was too young and didn‚Äôt voice their opinion.
---
No, it stayed like it did because that was better design and Jagex didn't listen to the vocal whiners complaining about everything like they do today.
---
&gt;Jagex realized after awhile that the death system wasn‚Äôt working and added the gravestone system we saw back pre-rs3. They realized that runescape can have risk vs. reward WITHOUT being a ‚Äòlose everything‚Äô game.
---
They did that to appeal to vocal whiners and ended up killing the game by adding easy mode mechanics to everything, which makes the game incredibly boring.
---
heh
---
I got stuck in Draynor as well. Ended up getting my brother to come to Draynor to help me, he came in and also got stuck. He wasn't as retarded as me and found the door out pretty quickly though.

1. Bot is way too smarter than jagex bot detection system
---
2. Legit players...

But he didn't

Maybe don't stupidly take huge amounts of value somewhere that's unsafe then whine when you die...

What's your problem, swine?

The game grew far faster back in the day when death was way more punishing than it is now.

That's an absolutely awful system. What the game needs is the death mechanic it had back in 2006.

Yeah this sounds right. It was slightly south west of edgeville but not as far as barb village.

big exp boost lol, it's 5x and it's basically ironman mode where if you die you lose half your exp.

Don't forget to push the "turbo" button for that extra 10 mhz :)

Probably a tech limitation on why they can't make it show more.

That's not Runescape. Runescape's mechanic is that you lose all your shit if you die.

It's a reference to something Zuhaar has said in the past you absolute incompetent "person". Jesus christ. If anybody else said it, it'd have been embraced.

Yeah rofl. Who uses book of ancients and glory
---
All I can see is Foxy Di :\^)
---
This is it! So it‚Äôs not in OSRS this saddens me greatly :(
---
&gt;In 2007 the best gear took 10-15 hours to get, assuming you had 85 slayer. 
---
And as a result the game was **much** better than it is now.
---
Get lost, swine.

I lived in the ghetto and couldn't afford a computer as a kid. So I discovered RS being played by some gangster in the library and that's how I got introduced to it. I wasn't playing when I said gangster either, the guy was ina gang, was into guns, drugs and even runecrafting. I mean, what kinda psycho runecrafts. The library was the only place I could play games.

The best kind of alt are herb farmers. You only log on them every hour or so and play on them for 5 mins and logout. good money, but you'll have to grind for a lot of stuff like secateurs, teleports and quests for all patches

Is this like a digital drawing pad? This pic was made digitally

I mean there were spirit shields which were like 1b gp each for the best ones (can't remember the name).
---
Also a lot less money, which is something people should take into account. 50-72 Mining in MLM is like what, 10-15k  ores? So a few mil.
---
Unless you do like Ardy Monastery iron nodes and teleport bank you'll have to drop them so zero profit. Iron Ore is also fairly click intensive compared to MLM, especially if you add 3tick. It really just depends on what your goal is, how afk you want it to be, ect. Like I personally would not enjoy the 8 hours or so you'd need to bang out 45-70 mining on iron ore, I can only do about 60-90 minutes before I'm like get me the fuck off bird house island.

Why risk it if your going to be at your computer anyway?

Without those two? You don‚Äôt.

Really stoked for the update tomorrow. Fossil Island was my first release after returning, and I really enjoy the content that brought, and I've just been enjoying mobile a lot in general - I was only f2p back in my squeaker days and it's like a whole new game now. I love farm runs on mobile and can't wait to play around in the new farming guild!
---
Best teleport to farming guild is skills necklace, right?
---
I mean, the description applies to most people with these sort of banks. BA-enthusiasts.

If you‚Äôre down to keep training up combat skills slayer would be the way to go. It‚Äôs a slow process but make decent coin along the way , or possibly mining ? Making iron bars works out ok for myself or canon balls.

The worlds arent that populated though. It's not as easy as 5x xp but it's not as bad as you make it sound

&gt; You do know how easy it is to repair a wheel? 
---
In the end, this is still a huge time waster. Adds up gradually. So refraining from ever repairing the wheel if you've got the possibility to do so, is desirable.
---
It‚Äôs just fun slaying down bots for the luls. Even if they don‚Äôt necessarily have bank on em. 
---
Huge waste of time 
---
it took you an entire weekend to kill 100 cows? even if you're 9 years old that seems like a long time
---
You should go member solely because the xp rates in f2p are bad.  The best xp rates you are going to get will be in clan wars trainin on an alt of yours.  
---
You are better off going members. Questing 40 atk(in case you want to go 50 or 60 later), training strength at crabs or blast furnace or barb fishing, cannoning at (ogres, zeah hill giants, or mossies under varrock), and then splashing/alching/teleing for magic.

I used stams there. If on task you'd need on average 1 sweet/kill if not using stams. You can make the method a bit more difficult by adding 6 ticks of walking, which results in a net average profit in run energy if not running after zammy is dead. But sometimes you don't have a lot of time left to pick up drops/go to altar while walking, and you can have b2b2b long kills for example due to rng. So sweets would still be nice to have, and actually better than stams.
---
My 4:34 1st Zulrah kill agrees with you. It took me almost two cycles.  I'd memorized the 6 spots and weaseled myself a kill. 
---
If you're close after the first just remember those 6 spots and improvise.  If he's over 25% or so I'd tp out.
---
You can still afk with dharoks for 5 minutes

The time it takes for the paydirt to process should be used running to the bank or Mining new rocks.

So, in general, you really shouldn't encourage people to *find* anyone on the internet. Doxxing has a pretty negative impact on people's lives. Especially, ya know, professional female gamers.

Totally doesn't seem like something that may have been done on rs3...
---
I'm pretty sure he was lying
---
only about 40m of it.
---
isn't w450 EU
---
These memes are getting a bit out of hand 
---
Because RS3 bonds are worth more on Rs3 than old school bonds are worth on OSRS
---
call soros
---
Do you want a game with better updates and community, but the game itself is much grindier and harder to "get good" at, or do you want to stick with Rs3 where everything is more laxed, exp is basically free, the gp/hour rates are *much* higher, with an inflated economy, and significantly less players and community input into the game, where they shelf updates people waited on forever (The bank rework) even though they were promising it for years?
---
Id sooner play that than shitty club penguin üêß 
---
if it's so easy maybe you should play and do bosses and swap out :O most drops are 10x+ the price they are on OSRS. Free money for you man it's so easy and fast to get gear+stats and theres no one ever trying to kill you
---
Your stats on RS3 that probably took months, maybe even years to grind back then, are most likely easily available to get now in a couple months at absolute MAX.  99's mean nothing on that game now and with hugely boosted experience rates of 500k+ upwards in many skills at basic levels, and the ability to buy experience with $, I don't see why you'd want to continue playing.
---
Niceee
---
&gt; what is it for
---
A quick breakdown of what each house offers:
---
Hosideus - Tithe Farm minigame (good Farming xp, Farmer's Outfit, Seed Box), Hosideus Kitches (reduced burn rates), a farming patch (becomes disease free at %50 favor, Allotment + Herb), and the Woodcutting Guild
---
Arceuus - Arceuus Spellboook (Ensouled Heads for pray XP, ressurect plant, ect.), Dark Essence (Arceuus Spellbook teletabs, Blood/Soul Runecrafting)
---
Lovakengj - Blast Mine
---
Piscarillius - Anglerfish fishing spots
---
Shayzien - Lizardmen Shamans (DWH drop)
---
Each of these opens up at various % favor with each house, like the other comment stated, it's best to focus fire favor with out house to %100 so you can lock it in, as you will lose favor by serving other houses if you don't.
---
There's also the Catacombs in the center, which offers a plethora of Slayer Monsters with new unique drops, one to fight the boss Skotizo, and another to create the sword Arclight.  A few monsters in here also have boosted levels and better drops than their normal counterparts.
---
Lastly, Raids I is located here.
---
This isn't EVERYTHING to do in Zeah, but this is the majority of the relevant content, at least for today.  Tomorrow we get a bunch more.

Rate is 1:8 or something like that. A lot of rs3 gold for a little osrs gold.

You would be safer buying osrs bonds instead of transferring rs3 bonds to osrs.

been doing barrows with staff of iban in my 50's mage levels. it's insane fast. 
---
hope he changes name to sereneh8er
---
They were 100 gp ea actually.
---
The markets are completely different in both games. That‚Äôs why bonds are so much more expensive in RS3. Because it‚Äôs easier to make money. 
---
rc slow :D:D
---
This is going to sound dumb, but please don't bully me :(
---
How do you know your prof. browses here? No where in the image nor title did I see something that said they do infact come here. All I saw was a photo of a character in the game. Unless you mean that by playing the game, it is implied they browse here. 
---
You truly are, and I'm happy for you man. Hope you're doing okay.

Meanwhile one of my teachers ran after me and threw me down on the floor bruising my entire body, that was fun.

Hahahaha I think that's what it does to some people, I used to play in high school, it's basically just a giant multiplayer sandbox, you can create anything and they have their own scripting language to code your own stuff.

Where do I ‚Äúmisquote memes‚Äù lmao. I swear the autism thing isn‚Äôt a joke on this subreddit. I‚Äôve never seen a group of people get riled up over what a meme is called.

If you ever went on 4chan you would know that ‚Äúgreen texting‚Äù had numerous names with meme arrows being another popular one. I guess I can‚Äôt expect people who only know about 4chan from Reddit to know that though.

I'm not defending it.  It's up to jagex to take care of these things. Not a bunch of kids running around tattling on people. If jagex didn't know then that's there problem for not paying attention.

Nah i just transferred there last semester as a junior. I love it there.

not too sure, i did about 30 minerals a day. Was getting between 55-57k exp per hour tho.  Didn't have access to a d pic or varock armor either.

The quest "Client of Kourend" is the intro quest/guide to Zeah, but it's not necessary to go there or get started on any of this.  And there are several quests that take place in Zeah, I can't recall them all off the top of my head, but Tales of the Righteous and Queen of Thieves are among them, and a couple quests have small parts in Zeah, like Dragon Slayer II.
---
If you wanted to, you could just jump into Zeah without any introduction, though.
---
I don't know exactly what is coming, I haven't been super following, but I believe we're expected to have another couple quests, at least, for Zeah tomorrow with the Kebow Lowlands update.

There is literally nothing you can do. It‚Äôs unappealable, they don‚Äôt care about your story at all. They‚Äôve heard it millions of times, whether it‚Äôs true or not. You can tweet them to reach them but no one at jagex is going to unban you.

Lavas are cheaper than fire or earth runes because of all the people who craft them for XP. They can't be used to charge your downside, however.

I agree with this. I've met a lot of people and some are just socially awkward. No need to single them out. Just got to be humble. 
---
They do a few features I really like the RL lacks but the nail in the coffin for me was the GPU rendering, whenever I turn it off I just question how I was able to play without it for so long.

Your response is still lazy, uninsightful, and altogether disingenuous. If the post or suggestion doesn't pertain to you and you don't like it down vote and move on. The way you are talking is akin to a American having a say in the European Union law making. If you are not an Ironman and as such don't play the game mode (as it is a "Game Mode" and as such is entitled to balancing and QOL changes) Then please feel free "sink your teeth" into a proper response.

Serene, your comments that I've seen recently have been less terrible. Good job.

I seem to remember a sort of rogue-like dungeon in osrs but I forgot what it is called and if it still is in the game. This was around 6 years ago and I really enjoyed it.
---
Is there anyone who knows more about this?
---
This is my dream 
---
LOL reddit recruiting nice

I feel like there's probably a 3rd party plugin for that, and that smaller plugins like that will probably inevitably be added anyway when there's less big updates they're working on.

Blocking license plates is dumb in the first place. They're public domain and you cant obtain any personal info from them without access to the police database.

Go read that thread at the top of r/AskReddit right now about not-so-obvious must have life skills. One of them is knowing the time and place to say certain things. I obviously don't go around calling my coworkers retards lol.

My guess would be Rogue's den. It's darker (no blue) but with broken walls and a minigame. Not really sure without knowing what it was used for.
---
Buying GF - 10k!
---
Yes you make a profit if you buy the runes. You can get up to ~130k mage xp per hour from it. GP/hour is over 500k I believe. Red d'hide is currently the best profit per hide right now if you get all materials at market price. You can get [the full list here.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tan_Leather)
---
Just remember that tan leather does sets of 5 hides, so do inventories of 25 so you don't accidentally tan 1 hide with a cast.

No but it‚Äôs just s humorous comparison as the devs always chalk this type up to engine work

So your older brother literally trained two of the most useless skills in the game while he mooched food and armor/weapons off of you and the youngest? Sounds like my older brother lmao.
---
I agree it is extremely flawed, and I'm not suggesting this change will make the game "popular" - I am only suggesting that this minor change would allow for the game to be played by a small amount of the playerbase as opposed to literally no one right now since getting 24 other players is actually impossible aside from a big streamer hosting an event or something similar.

You can click the pile and afk collect them for 20 minutes if a rat is attacking you. 140 efficient hours would take 140 hours and could literally require 420 mouse clicks in total. Still a good waste of time

Because, in typical Apple fashion, MacOS no longer supports current versions of the graphics library that RuneLite uses and has opted to switch to a proprietary alternative.

Making it work would require rewriting a significant portion of the code into something that MacOS supports.

But as others said you're at a pretty low level, maybe invest some into smithing for blast furnace steel bars? I just do slayer and at 95 a couple days of slayer easily gets me a bond, with shit like gargoyles 500k/hr.

I'd just pay the irl monies and use bonds when you're a higher level.

Correct.

They aren't tho, it's a low level dairy and it gives newer players a reason to use that fairy ring code to explore a new area. It fit's perfectly. 
---
tfw im watching the osrs livestream from work
---
Just give us RuneScape HD again
---
I'm Dr. Janice and I approve this post.
---
I‚Äôm dying lmao
---
You should get your money back for that class. Professor is clearly mentally challenged if he‚Äôs on this sub. 
---
I'm aware it's not the only one. The others somewhat make sense, though. You don't just need fairy rings for the Relleka diary, you also need Cold War, which is a local task.
---
Yeah shut the fuck up
---
Agreed, this devalues my Zeah only no fairy ring full Shayien armor vegetarian ironman. Frankly I don''t even know what they're thinking over at Jagex anymore.
---
Doesn't really take nerdiness to install Windows on a Mac, just Google 
---
Do you do waterfiends if you get them for example? Those are an insta-skip for 99% of people
---
Rs isn't the smoothest of games and there's a bit of input lag between player controls and actions, some people get really good and queue up the next action 1-2 ticks prior some people arent so good. Also the boss is really difficult in terms of managing health prayer and positioning, some people still need help killing Jad.
---
Yes but they do not use dragonfire. Similar to how on Olm the DHCB works.
---
got mine at level 60
---
Because people prefer OSRS for the gameplay, not necessarily the graphics.
---
WAH
---
Thank you

It was on their livestream when they were showcasing a new soundtrack.

You should try avoid saying it at all than to not say it sometimes. It's a mindset that people reserve and it becomes a part of their lifestyle. 
---
Look at /pol/ or some shithole. "Look at us, we're neo-nazis LMAO!!", then they live the meme so long that they can't differentiate if they're joking or serious.
---
This shit is on a close level of being ridiculous on the internet. 
---
Ring of suffering, thats what the 19 cmb is there for.  Hp lvls to use the ring
---
I don't think I'm the salty one here
---
Funnily enough I haven‚Äôt had any waterfiend tasks, they hit 2 types of damage don‚Äôt they? Yeah they are a pain in the ass but I did used to do them when I got 100 slay on rs3, I used to wear magic defense armour with a good shield and the slayer helm, try and get a good balance across range and magic.
---
Although I guess on osrs they can just be prayer flicked through can‚Äôt they? 
---
I did used to skip Acheron mammoths, camel warriors, ripper demons because they required too much attention (moving out the way of aoe etc). But I rarely got them.

To be fair runecrafting is a kind of sickness

&gt;I cant imagine a world where toxic people do well on streaming platforms.
---
Do we exist in the same reality?
---
MSB (i) and rune arrows for sure. Not sure about the monsters, but 5/6 should be fine.
---
you‚Äôr mom gay
---
Definitely a sweet addition, but its unfortunate that updates like these have to come from a third party developer instead of Jagex. Hopefully they get around to adding some of the RL features to the official game/client. 
---
&gt; Should we remove every requirement that is inconvenient or inaccessible to your account build?
---
No, and I never asked for that.
---
&gt; Where do you draw the line?
---
There's no line. Good game development is about balance and sense, this has neither.
---
&gt; Isn't the point of a skiller or pure to provide more of a challenge?
---
And in this case the challenge is... not being able to do it at all? It's already a challenge to be a pure, and the rewards wouldn't help one bit. This is just *content* we don't get access to, again, for no reason.
---
&gt; If we go about removing all of these requirements to satisfy your account build(s), are you really that different from a main account?
---
No, and once again, never asked for it.
---
&gt; If the rewards are far from gamebreaking, surely it won't be the end of the world for you to be without them, no?
---
No, it won't. And if it did, it would make sense to prevent pures and skillers from accessing them. Can you believe some people enjoy this game and are annoyed when they're being kept away from parts of it just because? I don't have time to make myself a main account, and chose to play as a pure only (and that's entirely on me) - but does that mean I can't open my mouth to propose reasonable alternatives to locking me out of a diary that doesn't even give me any kind of competitive edge? Are we that divided of a community that we need to pick sides whenever a tiny issue like this comes up instead of looking at things objectively?
---
Still a low quality post kid, can‚Äôt debate facts 
---
For the love of god, please fix your gems.
---
Just imagine this guy getting permanently muted. He wouldn't be able to tell anyone he's a btw
---
Depends on your point of view, I wouldn't care for it though
---
I hope to be there
---
Guessing so he doesn't have to go get another one in the event he dies with it. Or do you keep it always?
---
I never understood why jagex didnt use their old hd models to create hd version again, even after claiming they dont have them anymore, they exist in 3rd party databases and its their intellectual property. If 3rd party like oshd had them they could just take them and make an hd version of the game without wasting years recreating them
---
You don't need Cold War for any Relleka task. 
---
Ardougne diary has a task to use the unicorn pen fairy ring. Kandarin has a task to enter McGruber woods with a fairy ring. Lumby has one to use the Wizard Tower fairy ring. They're all medium tasks.
---
No can do. I of course don't say it often, not out of respect for not disrespecting others (I couldn't give a shit how you feel), but because the word doesn't need to be used. If my buddy accidentally scrapes the bumper of his car on the parking spot thingy, I'm going to call him a retard. If I find something off or incorrect, I typically won't say "that's retarded".  
---
It's all about the context. And in this context, OSRS, retard is synonymous to N word in the black community. It's almost meaningless.
---
Thank you. I have not played in a long time and came back when mobile came out. I‚Äôll look into this next time I get gargoyles as a task!

Gargoyles are more consistent gp/hr if you get lucky abby demons can be better due to whips though, but you might get unlucky and make nothing.

It's not close to the same profit at all, you should be averaging 8 herbs per patch it's only close if you Get 6 herbs per patch.

Cave horrors drop black masks. You‚Äôll need to complete the cabin fever quest to unlock their location first. They are found in the mos le‚Äô harmless caves but you‚Äôll need a light source to go inside. You can overhead protect from melee but if you plan on not praying the whole time you are fighting them, bring a witchwood icon to minimize their damage dealt. 
---
Cause apparently my 2017 laptop with an i5 isn't powerful enough to play Runescape on anything but vanilla client..
---
Shut up Serene ( ò‚Äø ò‚úø)
---
&gt;id a whole bunch of wizardry and said "run around to get the hang of it"
---
no, he explains how you do the two run methods. Yeah, you gotta practice. Solo olm requires you to not be missing attack ticks and attack at specific times relative to olms attack from specific positions. Solos take a long time to get good at even if youve done hundreds of team raids.
---
You can do solo olm without running the head. Just prep a full inv of pots and suicide them in olm. ofc this lowers your chance of loot pretty substantially and your olm will be like 20 minutes compared to 10-11 and youll have to spend way more time prepping so you want to learn to do olm properly
---
Very true. I have been neglecting range so I'm going to go up that with slayer. I'm on the grind to 99 mage but I need to take some breaks so I don't dread it so much.

This is awesome man! I actually went to one of your learner raids earlier this week. Good stuff!
---
They're botted views. These streams last for 5 minutes before a new one takes it's place. This entire post is just beating a dead horse at this point.
---
The consensus is that buying the slayer helm perk isn't worth it as the first thing, for it gives little extra over just a black mask. Much more useful perk is the slayer rings, though you do need 70-71 crafting.
---
can get inspiration from r/banktabs (or something like that i forget), it‚Äôs well worth the time spent to organize it 
---
its more effective to stagger them.
---
theyll still reduce defense properly if they are all hit on the same tick, however say 4 people dwh on the first game tick, theyre all rolling their spec on the full defense boss. If you stagger specs slightly, eg 2 people on game tick 1, 2 people on game tick 2 you have an overall better chance of hitting more hammers because the second 2 hammers might be hitting a lower defense boss so theyd be more likely to land.

I downloaded runelite.... one of my favorite things about osbuddy is for example when u go to "view guide prices" on you equipped item tabs. It tells u the current g.e. price, and the osbuddy/actively traded for price.... I don't see anything like this on runelite. Is there a setting I can turn on for something similar in runelite

Is this just a 1 day thing or maybe somewhere down the road you'll do this as well? Asking for a friend....or myself. Lol.
---
I have an account that I solely camp Abby demons with. It's great for something afk to do while bossing. Not the best go/hr as it's heavily rng based. I like it because I'd rather see a big drop than a bunch of small ones(like gargs). I wouldn't suggest it unless it's an alt doing it or you are watching a movie/want to be semi afk. If you do end up doing and want to be afk, camp them in guthans
---
I caught my first break right off the bat around lvl 60 when I intercepted 5mil worth of cabbages, potatoes, raw chickens, and raw beef someone was drop trading. I sold ~30k cabbages in 2 days. Helped me get my account going so much faster.
---

It‚Äôs possible a nearby player dropped 4 earth runes and they appeared to your friend at the exact time and grid square as he killed the cow. There are plenty of similar explanations.

It is not possible for an NPC to drop something not on its drop table.

Good point. I hate that I can't complete the easy Rellekka Diary on my no woodcutting alt. I'm role-playing as a character whose parents were killed by a psycho lumberjack, and Jagex has to punish me for that? I don't get why limiting what skills I train has to limit what I can do in the game.

Yeah I was planning to do that tomorrow. Can you name some quests that I should definitely do?

I figured as much which explains why there was no info on it besides that challenge run.
---
I don't think I'll be doing it until I get further with my bank. I'm a very long way from being able to afford the full setup anyway, so I might as well wait until I get closer. That keeps it fresher in memory and maybe there will be better gear for it by then.

Skill of the Week is a skilling competition hosted here on [/r/2007scape](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/). Participants will compete in getting the most experience in a chosen skill. We will use the site [crystalmathlabs.com](http://www.crystalmathlabs.com/tracker/) to measure our experience gains. Rewards include a various set of [flairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/wiki/flairguide) here on the subreddit, which you can see examples of on the sidebar.

Rendering != graphics.
---
You can have old school graphics with a modern graphical renderer. It looks the same (ideally) but performs and renders a lot better. Turn on light banding in RL and you won't even notice the difference besides the longer draw distance and max fps.
---
I can't remember any off the top of my head, but if you google "quest xp rewards osrs" the link to the wiki should pop up. It'll list all the skills and any quest that gives xp in that skill. 
---
Hi I'm looking for the rsn "3a" have you seen it?

There's also zero point in cheating on a test, it's a test for a reason. smh
---
&gt; Why exactly wouldn't that be possible
---
Like, if we want to dive deep, it's possible. Cosmic rays can cause small changes in memory:
---
&gt; Studies by IBM in the 1990s suggest that computers typically experience about one cosmic-ray-induced error per 256 megabytes of RAM per month
---
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray#Effect_on_electronics)
---
If the items are constructed by using a factory method from their id, flipping one of the id's bits (especially if the id are integers and not strings) right after rolling the drop and allocating the memory for the id, but before the factory call is made, could indeed result in getting a drop that does not exist on the drop table.
---
-----
---
Ofcourse, practically the chance is pretty much zero
---
It's not HD but you should be able to read it I think 
---
1. Since when do flairs show up on mobile

2. Why is it only ur pk skull flair

try volcanic mine instead

Trident of the seas or swamp for Kraken boss. If not, when is Swamp better?

From what I can tell, Toxic trident only provides like 2 more max hits than regular trident, which doesn't seem worth it for the increased cost. What am I missing?

To be fair, Serene has been doing fine the past couple of days. Not even close to perfect, but so far it's been an improvement compared to the last weeks/months.
---
But yeah, this one was shit.
---
See I used to do some dirty rs shit at the library. I would play runescape and whenever someone would walk by and comment I would strike up conversation and have them log in for me to show me their account. Little did they know I would pre-install a keylogger every time for the lootations. My runescape library days were some of my darkest.
---
why
---
I used to do the same thing except id keylog my computer and ask them to log in to show me their accounts. God I feel bad for my misdeeds
---
Exact same thing happened to me on my 3rd kill about a month ago! 
---
Could be from a different country
---
Imagine playing 2 versions of the same game and accidentally mixing them up, only to be called retarded when you realize and correct yourself.

If you're on Runelite, go to Runelite Plugins and find "Screenshots". Enable it, edit the plugin settings to include "Display Date" to include the Day/Month/Year in the screenshot.  Enabling either "Boss Kills" or "Valuable Drops" will automatically screenshot and save to your .runelite/screenshots/\*PROFILE NAME\* folder as well. The Runelite Plugin "Chat Timestamps" can also be enabled for exact minute timestamps of chat text for further verification of drops. If you don't have screenshots set to automatic you can quickly say anything in game before taking your screenshot and it'll also include that chat timestamp in your screenshot for further verification.    
---
    
---
With that being said, good luck on both competitions this week :)  
---
Is it good xps?
---
Hi! Dr. Janice!

imagine playing the old version of a game but then augmenting it with third parties and plugins to make it something completely foreign 
---
This would be way more convenient than my dumb excel spreadsheet. +1 support.

Thanks for the reply! I am aware that I will not get to keep my stats and items, purely doing this for the nostalgia of playing under the same username as I did as a kid. Will continue spamming Jagex with request, thanks for the advice!

This might get me back into runescape üëÄ

There is a common misconception about run energy it only matters if it is at 69; henceforth this doesn‚Äôt help the dedicated team to taking this account and flipping it to post RSgold.gov. Also if we can see the herblore logo you‚Äôve locked in the hijack.

---
This is touched on in a different comment thread so you may not have seen it. Sure this can be done for certain areas, or maybe even most of the current map, the textures exist in some backup from 201x for jagex. The issue then is going forward, that every new update like Zeah, theater of blood, Kebos, all need to have both a default and HD graphics model created. The OSRS dev team already only has like 1-2 graphic designers and graphics are basically the choke point of them developing content, so an while 99% of the community would approve of an HD toggle, it doesn‚Äôt have the resources to be viable
---
I like your thinking. But, I think it'd be easier to have these low-level Slayer bosses added to the already existing Boss Slayer list, assigned in hard mode/higher quantities. :)
---
It supposed to be 1/250. Probably you just got unlucky... My first xeric was in some 400 kc. My second one in about 100. Favour isn't important, you need just like about 5% in Shazyen to be aboe to kill lizardmen.
---
Where are you doing this? Kill them in the pit to the east from the fairy ring, where Shaizyen soldiers are fighting them. This is where I've got both of my xeric's. There are also lizardmen in the swamp between Kuorend and Mount Quadrimorte - not sure if they drop it too...

This guys‚Äô post history tho..

They knew OP's prayer and RC level so somebody hacked him ;(

ikr
---
The poison/venom ticks appear to be going off on server side intervals all the time from what I've gathered, so every 18 server ticks it hits, meaning if you apply venom on the 17th tick it'll hurt them on the very next tick.
---
Go see your general doc maybe? Like not even talking about mental illness -- things like simple vitamin deficiency can really fuck your happiness up. 
---
Nice try lmfao trying to keep the double exp to yourself well i wont believe you gunna get 99 prayer and cons rn with this double exp.

They send you a message to your reddit inbox explaining how to add a flair. You just need to comment a letter on the post, for example comment H if it is humor, A if it is achievement, ect. Like i said they drop a message in your reddit inbox explaining.

Brother, i've had 5 d boots and 5 ecumenical keys in 128 spiritual mage kc. Corp pet at 10 kc, agility pet at lvl 53. Amongst many other things. You have not come remotely close to even fondling your rng.
---
How long did it take for u to get to Zuk?
---
just ask EV scape to solo olm for everybody loool.
---
Also yes the only xp gains I've made since December 13th (i think that's when the event came at) have been from lamp randoms. I just started doing minnows again yesterday. 
---
Is there a copy of this without the character blocking the handsome hydra? 
---
Torvesta has a series building a range tank that is super good(I think its still going but hes grinding the stats for the next video which takes a while)
---
Mr. Mammal has his Iron series which is long but i like watching it a like
---
UIM Verf has a series much like Settled's. Karajma only UIM. He is trying to do Inferno through Karajma only
---
DitterBitter has a new series out that should be great, its started well
---
I assume you are watching B0atys new HCIM series. It is quite fantastic
---
I hate being the devil's advocate for serene but I simply prefer the vanilla client. I don't think I'll ever use any third party client and that's just my preference 
---
Highly recommend joining a clan, a good active one. Also, like the person above me said, make an Ironman account, maybe even two. Do something you‚Äôve never done before, such as Pking, etc. 
---
youre a goddamn legend of this sub's comment section
---
Got mine at 2 kc... there goes all my rng for the next 3 years
---
I'm on PC and it doesn't look like that for me at all... I use old.reddit.com so not sure if that makes a difference
---
I hate the trawler so much
---
That was me last month! Got first limbs at 1100 kc on christmas day x.x
---
Basically the way the game is ran by default is using the native java library's functions. OpenGL allows for more efficient rendering (for example using GPU instead of the CPU like Jagex does) which is why it looks better, can see farther, while also having a better frame rate.
---
But when you switch from std lib to OpenGL, you'll notice that things look a lot better. They look much cleaner. While normally you'd think this is better, it actually loses the art style of the game. I'm not sure what OSB did but I'm guessing they just did the bare minimum to make the OpenGL renderer work. Whereas RL did some extra customizations to keep intact the feel of RS
---
Also they knew he was total level 700 something ):
---
I don't see how. There's the official client and there's the game. The official client runs the game. RL runs the game. OSB runs the game.
---
3rd party clients do modify the game, but the official client isn't used any.
---
This is probably the stupidest compliant/question ever, but during the Rune Mysteries Quest I promised to keep the rune essence and how to make runes a secret...but then in Enter the Abyss I go and tell the Mage of Zamorak about runecrafting and I'm supposed to take him to the rune essence mines....that just seems really rude...
---
If it says Invalid password now, Try resetting password request Jagex will always send an email asking for confirmation before proceeding password change.  
---
If hackers have access to your email I suggest you first change your email password and back it up with either mobile auth or another email auth.  
---
They can keep going into your email and changing password this then, then I suggest you changing your osrs password aswell from a safe device.  
---
scan you computer if nothing found, Id still do a clean install of Windows/Mac  
---
GL
---
No it isnt. Why is everyone that kills them so braindead. Spectres use way more resources to kill and they take far longer more importantly. Money/task is completely useless metric.
---
I have the flu and read this and started laughing and pooped a little diarrhea in my undies. Thanks
---
You‚Äôre a legend dude &lt;3
---
My parents bought a beefy computer originally and it ran rs pretty well. It was a pentium 4 and i only ran into issues once i started trying to play WoW late TBC to early WOTLK
---
Thanks for the tips man, I still have a ways to go before my stats are even good enough to try it but thats the goal im working towards
---
Imagine complaining about your drops on Reddit 
---
OMG THIS IS AMAZING
---
Grats! Now just get 11 more RC levels so you can make Nature runes and then you can alch yourself.
---
i just use asgarnian hop seeds
---
Use the cheapest seeds. They provide different "charges", with a Ranarr and up providing 2 charges over a Guam's 1 (or any hops seed, so on).
---
Came here to comment this.
---
Lmaoooo
---
Go hard man! No slack! 
---
Okay, very good to know. So what purpose does being mage based or melee based serve?
---
r/3redditors1cup
---
*out of place laugh track*
---
Thought about that but 6m in cash left, so cant arrord the bare minimums
---
I tried playing it once and got kick for inactivity because so many people were playing I couldn't even help out.
---
Not postworthy
---
Imma try the Slayer thing
---
Lmao what. Ok sure if you want 100% efficient raids you need 2,5b in gear and 99 combats, 99 range, 99 mage, 99 prayer, 99 agility, 99 farming, 99 thieving, 99 mining, and 90 herblore.
---
Now how the fuck is that relevant advice to give to somebody who is just asking to get started jfc, how socially inept can you be.
---
Will definitely be getting slayer staff before I continue training STR.
---
I just want o learn as much as I can, what quests and NMZ method are you talking about?
---
Ew, he mixes potions up and runes together.
---
Level 62 slayer. Spent all my points recently on the slayer helm. What should my next purchase(s) be?
---
I specifically remember doing the Death Plateau quest while playing on the local library PC back in the day.
---
Seems to mainly be spread by U.S./UK users, although it's frequently used in the wrong context which makes the whole term redundant. 
---
Never salty about dying in wildy, only issue is when toxic people say racial or homophobic slurs as you die. Like if 8/10 of my experiences wasn't that, I'd be happy voting yes to a PVP poll.
---
Maybe its part of RES? (Reddit Enhancement Suite) 
---
Do slayer slow n cheap with broad bolts and a rune cbow. I also always, always, always reccomend birdhouses and farm runs. I use BP and cannon as often as I can with slayer yet my bank value keeps going up 
---
Nej, Serene. 
---
Afk means away from keyboard. Something being an afk method means that there‚Äôs time between clicks that you don‚Äôt need to interact with the game, such as redwoods where you need to click only 3-4 times per 5 minutes.
---
Thank you for proving my point. 
---
far too much effort 
---
Hi! I'm a combat level 67 with a range level I can boost to 72. What's a good place to train range? Possibility with some profit?Attack 68 Strength 65, Defence level is 48 magic 52.
---
If available I'd love to rehome them
---
Doesn't every gal look at that lad like that?
---
r/titlegore. 
---
I can totally see it. An angle shot of farm equipment and a monologue about hard work of sorts. Nice cutscene
---
Oh god, do you actually think that soy boy is anything other then a laughably sad insult?
---
Can i join the Agility Competition?  RSN:   oHoriizon
---
WG_CC (wilderness guardians clan). We do daily PvM/PvP/Mini-Games/Skilling Events +F2P stuff! Feel free to join us to find some friends
---
yeah it's much better and loads faster. There's even a dark mode and reader mode you can toggle on the moon icon on the very top of the page
---
Skip to 5:50. You're welcome :)
---
IDK, you seem pretty worked up over this. Maybe calm down and get some thicker skin?
---
Seems slightly orchestrated and artificial tbh, especially after Ed thoroughly commented about it. They know what they're doing.
---
At this point I hope is rsn is the same as his ign so I can find him. 
---
It's against the rules to buy gold.
---
How many people on this subreddit have taken the same class? Lol
---
Redman fan?
---
:( stopppp
---
Looks like the rest of its body is not visible because of the fog in the artwork.

Do you have superiors yet? If not, definitely those.

First you so pkers do it for fun not the loot. And now ur implying it's for free loot. U sound retarded. Plz shake my thread

You risk being banned by purchasing gold from 3rd party websites.

And serene fucking ruins everything in their comments still
---
Looks like secondlife a.k.a furry sex simulator
---
Real world trade is a bannable offense, no idea why you thought you would get advice on this in the main subreddit lol
---
It doesn't feel real right now, and I'm so grateful to have been given the opportunity to have my work shown to the community that I hold so dear to me. This is an absolute honor, and I can't wait to continue creating content to provide some laughs for those who need it.
---
I hope Jagex holds more of these for the future to promote more content creation, and bring people out of their creative shells. Thank you everyone for the support during the livestream today. I'll remember this one forever. 
---
You shouldn't be cheating the educational system, that's lazy and screams incompetence. Will bite yo back.
---
its actually Keyring
---
If you do go back to it, pay attention to how much it changes art mediums.  (like digital animation, pencil drawing, watercolor, etc.) It can be really creative and artistic, its particularly known for that.
---
F. I've seen the rare post or 2 of the twisted bow going to the +1 or the leech. Definitely dont want that one to happen lol. 
---
Truth be told I would have recommended you spend your points on other things first. There's not a whole lot of tangible benefit to having the helm over a black mask for most tasks.
---
My personal preference is Blocks&gt;Superior slayer monsters&gt;Slayer Ring&gt;Extensions&gt;Slayer Helm&gt;Other perks.
---
You can sprinkle in some of the other perks like gargoyle smasher if you'd like, though.
---
Nih!
---
I mean this isnt actually connected to the official  runescape website is it...
---
Since you‚Äôre a dick I‚Äôm gonna give you a notification for no reason. 
---
I do not. Thanks!
---
Lol
---
Also why doesn‚Äôt slayer helm just include range and magic. 
---
You know how people have a motive to do stuff? Like idk, killing players for fun? You know how that stuff gets even better when you, idk, add free gp on top of it? I know this might be hard to wrap your botting head around but there is no reason to spare you. 
---
At what slayer level would you consider the herb bag essential?
---
sElLiNg BlAcK sCoRpIoN
---
If you get slayer helm benefits then itd never pass a poll or get support.
---
It‚Äôs actually a code for meth, people see this on rs then they go to that persons in game name on a dark web forum and purchase their product. It‚Äôs typically used to let customers know they‚Äôve ‚Äúre upped‚Äù
---
Having a girlfriend isn't as uncommon as your personal experience might lead you to believe
---
Wrong sub?
---
&gt; Merchers just don't want to be caught out if it turns out tbow is bis or something so they dump their items at a safe price.
---
Which starts a cascade as suddenly people who where still buying notice multiple buy offers completing quickly and people still holding see the price is dipping so they rush to sell everything they have.
---
Investing in items for updates is always risky, the purple sweets one is a good example they went to 3 or 4x their original value when inferno was coming up to release then a few weeks before the update someone brought up tick eating during a dev Q&amp;A and they mentioned purple sweets wouldn't work. Instant drop to near half their original price.
---
Hard diary reqs take like a week to get. Just get the gloves...
---
#I KNEW IT
---
Makes me sad they likely aren't allowed to make a mobile client.
---
Thats a mandatory class for first years in one of some of the most popular progeans at a large school
---
imagine training a gathering skill but you have nothing to show for it because you dropped everything
---
Can‚Äôt relate but good meme
---
Just did some rough math. If you save as little as 30 seconds from using the tab, you are getting about a half a run extra per hour (up to 7 runs per hour from 6.6). You will spend about 25k on those tabs from that hour, so as long as that extra run gets you at least 50k (or 25k for a half run, which isn‚Äôt possible), the tabs are more cost efficient. Plus, you get an extra chance every hour for a Barrows item. Not sure the average GP/chest, but using tabs seems like it would be worth it to me. 
---
Your a skilled pker. Would love to see some commentarys:)
---
Is it greedy or a smart investment of resources?  Jagex is going to have a finite amount of resources and this allows them to use them on the game while the third party clients handle quality of life on the client.
---
Yes, but then 1. Those artists can‚Äôt do any major graphics work for anything else, which means no big updates can be worked on while they‚Äôre catching up, and 2. Any future updates will need to be graphically designed twice.
---
Even the kids??
---
Considering I boost all my skills to meet the diary reqs, leeching for 1kc seems fitting :) 
---
i said "pkers" not actual pkers. They call themselves pkers but they are really just edgelord brats. Not people who just enjoys the pvp aspect of runescape, but have a weird need to trashtalk and be toxic for no given reason.

When boosting to plant trees for farming, do I need to boost just when I plant it in the pot? Or also for when I plant it in the ground?
---
usually if someone asks me for help i give them reccomendations instead of giving them money

I did this quest yesterday.

I could have read the entire Dev blog in half the time of this video...

For sure? Played Gw1 for yeaaars and dont recognise this at all?
---
What profession is it? And where? If you can tell.
---
Souls Bane?
---
Hey can you give me a list of the quests you have done please as I've made a similar build I'm making a mage/range tank with 1/1 str atk 
---
yup
---
There are very few dailies at all in OSRS, and the ones that do exist are quick and only have minor benefits. Here's all of them: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Repeatable_events
---
Even if you choose to do every single daily possible (which no one does) it would take less than 5 minutes a day. 
---
I suppose you could consider the whole farming skill sort of a daily activity, but I'm  not sure that would be fair. 
---
Bring an emergency tele and give it a go, won‚Äôt know till you try 
---
The INS bless y‚Äôall 
---
How long did it take you?
---
I had to recover my account, google shows no suspicious activity on my account. I have 2 step authentication on my email account as well. Email wasn't changed on my account but the password was change and authenticator disabled.
---
Remindme! 24 hours
---
Is that what it is? 
---
Take a ring of recoil or 2. Elvarg basically defeats herself at that point. Members only tho..
---
Is there a minimum level required for the 10k experience reward of shadow of the storm ? Wiki doesn't mention anything. Wanted to skip the low ranged lvls on iron man.
---
Oh yes lol
---
in modern times we just make alt-accounts and complete events and then crash the value of those rare items 
---
reading this title gave me cancer
---
Gp increase is fine. No need for XP increased 
---
And jad what!
---
no because no one plays with sound on
---
And tob?
---
And just to be fair, you can force pvm deaths in pvp at all times.  Tob and other instance pvm are the only times punishment is guaranteed.
---
The annoying thing is we don‚Äôt call them shrimp. It‚Äôs fucking prawns!
---
I think his luck is spent at this point. He should have bought a lottery ticket and then skipped the task.
---
On a decent team probably an hour and a half to two hours 
---
Source: I like ba :)
---
i have an extra ectophial i used to check. i looked everywhere. even went further than I could possibly go at the spot I afked at. None of this makes any sense to me. My auto-retaliate was off too so I shouldn't have moved. sigh....guess ill restart 
---
~4 hours probably? No point though because it requires 40 defense to wear. 
---
Reads like satire.
---
If you are legit, everyone had to restart for osrs, not just you. 
---
I plan on learning, but this is very kind of you in the meantime, thank you.
---
Damn

i stream everyday except thursdays (i'm making an exception for tommorow)

HAHAHHAHAH those inferno streams were so fun and the "lessons" were even better

Now that I think of it, is there any area in rs where it‚Äôs raining?  Would people like a weather system in osrs?

Okay, this is epic

You arent the first to think of this go home

If I had 5x xp I might actually train runecrafting.
---
I used to sell them for 1k ea and made bank back in da day. 
---
Good thing I connected to my work WiFi and was able to watch the stream via VPN.
---
That room looks familiar. Is that DWE? 
---
Rarely have I ever read through 200+ comments on a thread looking for just a single response. I truly hope your professor says something clever when they find this. It would make my day. Please let us know if they confirm seeing this thread at the very least. 
---
I don't know if I believe that the drop rate is truly 1/50. I killed like 5 million of those fucking cyclops
---
Yeah, I was curious why both times I was able to run back to safety rather than just dying from a follow up hit. 
---
I want that bow lol, if I'm at 40 attack and strength with full addy armor, a rune scimitar, and a whole bunch of lobster, do you think I could take someone wielding one?
---
you're an ironman so you need to join the ironman raiding discord. go to google and type in "ironscape discord"

Also curious
---
Hahaha it's nice to see that I'm in the screenshot!
---
  
---
stop wasting time. do it soon ok?
---
It's super easy. I leeched for my music cape. They just clear the room ahead of you and you follow them through. Then when it gets to chamber of olm, you don't have to actually go in to the room with him. There's a room right next to it you can spectate and be safe and still unlock the track.
---
thank you!
---
Nice.
---
chymisRage
---
Fairy rings changed the game for me
---
If the email wasnt changed but the password was, doesn't that mean they have access to your email? 
---
TIL some women are spawned from their mothers.
---
Does anyone know if you've already completed a raid it counts for the diary? I leeched one for the music cape and don't feel like doing it again lol
---
It's all about rng. Abby demons drop whips 1 per 512. I've killed about... 3k? Of them and have only gotten one abby head and 1 elite clue. Just all luck based. I have a hard time believing a lot of drop rate numbers.
---
there is end game content that could take an hour or two to complete (with several mechanics you must learn, several bosses, and several puzzles) and instead of making them learn that i am allowing them to just sit still and look pretty.
---
they dont want to learn the content they just want to get their diary done.
---
I definitely will 
---
its gone now :)
---

Lmao

---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm not at UWaterloo... would‚Äôve been crazy though 
---
anyone
---
I really like the first suggestion but the suggestion immediately after conflicts with it. I could understand decreasing the time of the mini game so players wouldn‚Äôt have to wait so long for a new one one to start. But with the other update making it so where multiple games can be played per world there‚Äôs no point in decreasing the time of the game.
---
In order for an update to be QoL it can‚Äôt make anything faster otherwise it would be a buff. So by halfing the time it takes to do the game the drop rate of the angler pieces would have to be doubled. So the time to get angler would remain the same but now you have to enter twice as many games.
---
I don‚Äôt see the point. It should be one or the other but not both. 
---
nailed it.
---
Osbuddy is closed source, so could sign the requests as valid. With open source you can sign the api calls as valid even if they're not valid 
---
I listen while I work , also i play while i work lol
---
you can die to stuff like misclicking on a mushroom while doin herbivore, die at wintertodt, etc.
---
what can I say? Im really lazy.
---
Fantastic, I'll be looking forward to it. I enjoy watching these situations play out. It's amazing how far runescapes reach has become. A few of my coworkers started playing. None of them had any clue I played let alone for almost 15 yrs. Was great having noobs to share the history of the game with
---
What would the point be when you can't wear it at lvl 3?
---
gonna tell people somehow. thanks for supporting it
---
that'd be content. especially if they hand it over!!
---
No, I did :)
---
Track pads aren't the absolute worst. Have you played on a Mac? 
---
Do you know a team that would be willing to carry me to get one p:? I have 46 defense and that's it
---
Also, #WDR
---
1200 sweets will be more than enough you‚Äôll end up using 300 or so :) take 8 brews and see how you go! I was thinking maybe with lower stats killing the 360s will take a bit longer and you‚Äôd end up using more prayer. Good luck mate!
---
Any good text guides for "beginners"(played back in the day, but there's a lot of new stuff)
---
the great thing about raids is that even if you're average you can do it alone. don't you not have any friends? i'll be your friend.
---
Give him enough time and I'm sure that madman will lmao.
---
1.7k dry making wild pies... I can imagine. Killing Chompies is enough to drive you mad.
---
I agree! I like getting 40k xp/hr or doing a level 30 method for a cap of 70k xp/hr, really brings the skill together and makes it fun for every player!
---
For real, fuck off with this shit. Nothing wrong with increasing xp rates by 15k/hr, to an amount still lower than your max efficiency rcing. 
---
Prayer because im a noob.
---
dude you can get 1000 points/hour
---
you don't have to fight olm you just have to be there. theres a door right before you fight him.
---
i'll see you there
---
It's not spent, I did a hard clue after this task and got Arma d hide boots, easy 1.7m.

I‚Äôm going for all pets as well. Congrats on your pet luck 
---
stop exposing me
---
lets hope so but knowing jagex? i doubt it
---
Cool account
---
i'll teach you anyday other than tomorrow!
---
Ironmen will cry harrasment even if the other person is oblivious. I didn't notice an Ironman one time and he instantly started going at me like that. I apologized, said I didn't notice because I was pretty afk, and he didn't care. I just reported, made sure he was on ignore, and left.
---
There's absolutely zero reason to be a racist piece of shit because your jimmies got rustled, and to think you're hot shit because you have 190 viewers on twitch is just a massive power trip. Those are the kind of people we don't need, pretty much in general. 
---
When I get done with work this is what I'm doing lol.

5 whip in 1 task im at 10k+ kc havent seen more than 1 drop at a time yet nice

I miss skyboxes from RS3 so I'm glad to see these come back. Ty runelite!

Ive asked this on so many other posts, and maybe this one will have an answer.

Does *ANYONE* have any idea why my GPU plugin just *will not* work?
---
I over-exceed the recommended specs for it. (4690k/1080ti)
---
Ive done all the recommended steps to try to make it work, turn off hardware acceleration, add it to nvidia programs, run as admin ect, *NOTHING* works.
---
I dont understand how my moms toaster of a hp notebook can run the thing, but my decent build cant.

Will you be letting anyone in who needs the task done or is it a first come first serve kinda thing? If so, where do I sign up lol 
---
What‚Äôre you talking about? I said 500k not 500!
---
No minimum level req
---
Looks easy tbh, but i'm a pretty athletic guy

You'll never guess what isn't getting out of OP's hand ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

The video is really nice at 1.5x speed.
---
Wheres the best place to get up to date Kebos Lowlands info? There's a lot of videos out but on the update posts page the last one was middle of December.
---
Does not excuse blatant racism and the inability to handle even the slightest bit of adversity.
---
Also we've had a large influx of new players due to mobile. Not everyone knows what an Iron man is, especially if they're a mobile casual. Spouting stuff like that is not the right way to go about things. 
---
"...Guys Im on Lunars..."
---
damn he guessed it, fletching cape.
---
How osbuddy works is that it sends all the information to an api call anyone can access, but they also send an identifying key. You can observe the traffic get the key (which usually doesn't change) and send whatever you want to the api endpoints. It's pretty easy to do and being closed source doesn't stop anything in this situation. As I said it has already happened before.

Back in the day cow hides weren't too bad before the bots hit. Probably would take me like a hour or two max on even an account with 20 in melee stats. 
---
But realistically at that age it'd take me all weekend with two friends to not do what ever I did to be so inefficient. I understood how to pick flax, and do the grunt work, I could of had basic essentials easily. I just didn't do it.
---
Because woman are pussies and prone to pickpocketing because they were handbags with long straps.
---
wouldn't recommend torso, you want lots of defense bonus.
---
Monkfishing/barb fishing, very afk for both, quick bank on monks and tap to drop is v helpful for barb. Got to 99 (6mish xp) fishing at barb on mobile.
---
Looks much nicer than the OP's image in my opinion (aside from the arrows / chins)
---
Ahh the weekly gender inequality H.A.M. Member post. 
---
Because otherwise it‚Äôs just you guys being assholes. You would have more challenge fighting a goblin in lumbridge than you would trying to pk an abyss runecrafter or clue hunter. I get that to pkers it‚Äôs fun but your fun is literally just annoying people who have no interest in fighting back. You can have just as much fun pking people who have loot and might actually fight back, if not more, than you would someone with no interest or loot. 
---
Phoenix gang is the coolest one
---
its easier to get than acb, plus u get a decent bit of alchs, its worth going for if you don't wanna kill sara yet. The ability to use dragon bolts on sara helps that grind a ton as well.

Yo.

Gratz dude! Also, what happened to your runecrafting pet, it looks kinda odd
---
make it with cheese cape so i can use pls
---
If you have an RSN that can be misconstrued to be offensive, it should be a name change.
---
If you have an RSN like "BlkSkinH8er", you should just be perm banned. We don't want people like that in our community.
---
all i remember is leeching with the cc who made calls what team was gonna win
---
If you have any luck left would you be willing to share? My luck isn‚Äôt great lately.
---
I would never trust a 3rd party no matter what all people say, if you got rat it will record send screenshot of your activity, and he can gain admin control of your pc and download stuff on to it.  
---
I would suggest you do a clean install of windows wiping every single thing. if its a rootkit it might be harder
---
Just wait till you get to those Elite Diaries.
---
I can't math
---
&gt;I was in Lumby bank with 3 cleaning clothes in my inventory
---
fuckin lol

Imagine not being able to watch streams while u work OMEGALUL

Mmm.. try posting this at peak time! Might be a good one, sir!

Wait meaning i cant do the diary kc with you tomorrow?

Yeah here you go ‚òòÔ∏è

The one thing I think OSBuddy does better is their Clue Scroll helper.
---
We just were careful with a set of pliers
---
You need runes to cast crumble undead when fighting Vorkath. 
---
Mine reused a test from the previous year and reported the class for cheating because we had the (unchanged) test from last year through friends. Because studying with previous tests is cheating now. None of us expected him to do something so dumb beforehand.
---
Upset that I'm working but I have time to watch people do it and learn, and a few hours shouldn't ruin chances of big bank too much I hope. 
---
Your misunderstanding - I don't go looking for defenseless people its just you can go a very long time some days without finding another solo pker while wondering around the wild so I and many others just attack any white dots we see. I get its annoying sometimes, I have an iron who gets killed in the wildy for nothing very often, but its a part of the game.

SOLVED. I checked Runelite's screenshot because it saves deaths. It was a vampire that killed me. Still my stuff is nowhere to be found, unfortunately. I hopped to every world. 
---
I hope they all melt tomorrow. 
---
It bugged out when I used a log on it instead of a nature rune :(
---
The team has responded before that their ads are tried and true for attracting new players. They might work for you, but you're already playing the game :P.  
---
Also, memes already sort of work as ads. Very often do I see this subreddit leak into others and get top comments. My friend who has never played osrs knows about it because of the thurgo pie memes and is thinking about playing it! 
---
Password was changed without them having access to my email and my bank pin was random.
---
Wonder how many chins he got off that 2nd kill
---
Holy shit does he play RuneScape 
---
That's the thing though, if they have your login it's usually from your email. That's what they go after. If you set 2FA on your email that'll cover your ass.
---
\&gt;acting like this is 4chan
---
No no no, 2k. No one greifs you.

Didn‚Äôt know you can cook B0aty at 28 cooking.
---
Mhmmm...
---
lookin good homie
---
Dumb question here but did you make sure it applied the changes? Mine didn‚Äôt apply to work off nvidia right away
---
Thought this was fantastic, reminded me of some older RS youtube skits. 
---
I doubt it, main audience of runelite are people who either have dummy in their poh or already know the max hit
---
This kid just merched 2m off obby capes in one weekend.
---
Fucking send that boy genius to space.
---
nice, is this cannon?
---
I'm at a major US University, our bio building is officially too contaminated to be used for science and the taps are nonpotable. Quite a few buildings leak. You're not proving much.
---
I can't be the only person to play it with sound! Lol
---
repost

Mine was a lot more discreet. We had our own dividers for more privacy, which helped a lot since i was insecure af.
---
Is it just me, or do some of the Hydra head look like they've been smoking the best weed ever?
---
Imagine complaining about someone complaining about money, you a loser a or something?
---
Suuuure.
---
Gz, you can talk shit to tbow capers now.

you should be ok, people could camp it all day and get nothing and you might login and get it on first task RnG

You are probably just too used to the timing and range of the rcb.  If you had rapid and 100% time on target BP should win every time.
---
you make teletabs on them
---
I see you, too, like Agility.
---
and its gonna be removed from raids table tommorow :P 
---
Is using 3rd party clients such as OSBuddy or RuneLite safe? I‚Äôve heard people get banned sometimes for no reason while using them?
---
Monkfish, usually. 
---
rc is bad but honestly with zeah rc it actually isnt TOO bad.
---
Does that room count as lobby and after everything is cleared I can just run to that room? 
---
Is that okay /u/Chymistry ? 
---
You legit look like the kid from the MAD magazines.

I thought the giants log was a spell the champ was casting

A man of taste

&gt; Ironmen will cry harrasment even if the other person is oblivious. I didn't notice an Ironman one time and he instantly started going at me like that. I apologized, said I didn't notice because I was pretty afk, and he didn't care. I just reported, made sure he was on ignore, and left.
---
This is called bias. Just because you met someone that was bad isn't reason to extrapolate that experience onto others. 
---
&gt; There's absolutely zero reason to be a racist piece of shit because your jimmies got rustled, and to think you're hot shit because you have 190 viewers on twitch is just a massive power trip. Those are the kind of people we don't need, pretty much in general. 
---
100% agree. Guy should be perma banned and OP should be muted for anti-semitism. 
---
WDR senpai
---
trout since i safespot most of the monsters
---
Ahhh! He said it! 
---
unless you are a ironman it does not matter 
---
no its not.
---
It's not a runelite setting it's an ingame one. Not sure exactly which but just mess around with the settings/advanced settings.
---
Does a hooded box actually work for you? Maybe my cat is special.
---
You try shaving hundreds of wild boars without any accidents
---
how is it a shit minigame though? It's great combat xp. And before you say hurdur slayer will max my combat! No it won't. Slayer will max your mage and range maybe but never your melees.
---
Autobot wants to delete how do I tag? Thanks jamflextape
---
I don't know for skillets, but my friends fry daddy got his in 4 hours.
---
&gt;I actually want to play the game not afk
---
U picked the wrong game my friend.
---
One of my buddies guided me through an entire run while I shared my screen on Discord. He explained the mechanics, spawns, strategies, how to handle certain situation etc. That has helped me A TON (got the cape in only 7 attempts). So having an experienced friend willing to help you like that is very beneficial. Also, pause before Zuk (final boss) and start a timer so you know when the ranger+magers spawn.  
---
   
---
Short explanation of how the spawns work during Zuk:  
---
Timer starts at **0:00** at start of kill  
---
First set spawns at **0:45**  
---
Timer pauses when Zuk is **599** hp and unpauses when Zuk is **479** hp  
---
2nd set spawns at **6:00**  
---
3rd set spawns at **9:30**  
---
4th set spawns at **13:00**   
---
cheese potato
---
Imagine using Reddit enough to care about a suite for it :p
---
&gt; Does not excuse blatant racism and the inability to handle even the slightest bit of adversity.
---
100% agree. Crying when 1 mob gets hit is on the IM, crying on repeat crashes is on the guy crashing. Racism isn't okay at all. 
---
I mean, I didn't say all ironmen. I should probably edit it to say some ironmen. I've met plenty of totally fine and pleasant ironmen, but you can't deny that there is a vocal minority that likes to pull the targeted harrasment card.
---
Again, I used broad terms when I shouldn't have. 
---
I thought making party hats worthless was good thing
---
They actually removed it in rs3 cause it was so bad 
---
Jagex is aware of this issue, as it does seem lazily thrown in as a reward.
---
If Warding passes and eventually enters the game as a new skill, ring imbues will be moved to that. If it doesn't pass, I believe they said they'll still eventually move ring imbues to something more relevant.
---
Might depend on the monster you're fighting. I think the 3 times may be because of 3 different drop tables being called at once. It could happen from the regular drop table, clue scroll, and ensouled head triggering simultaneously.
---
The fuck
---
until like 75+ slayer i used potato with cheese from warriors guild for 12gp each
---
Whoah, that must be rare as fk :o

I‚Äôm in! What exactly is -4 GMT? For a North American

There's already zamorak banner, which can be bought from castle wars.

aah alright, I missed today's one, thanks!

Calm down there nightmarerh

I will never be that guy

Thanks for the video, good summarization :) 
---
I'd be down for this! I'd like to try not to leech but I've only "done" one raid on my main for music cape, so I have some learning to do. I mostly want to see if my ironman has good enough gear for raids. Anyway, username: Reckless Lad
---
Max melee with 97 range and 95 magic, just a tad off 99 Slayer. Say again?
---
Thats adwaam im pretty sure thats insane
---
To fight Zulrah on mobile? Probably not if you haven‚Äôt gotten used to it on pc. Also try setting up your f keys so you can switch between your invent and prayer tab faster 
---
God i miss the days of going to the Telecenter in town after school in 2005 to play Runescape with my friends.
---
I skull tricked one of my friends for his Iron warhammer and he still hasn't forgiven me 14 years later. 
---
Oh you are right, I completely forgot about it. Thanks!
---
I haven't done fishing trawler yet so I can't comment on how necessary these buffs are, but I can say with absolute certainty that they are exactly that, buffs, not QoL.  This would make the mini game massively easier and literally double xp/hr on it.  This sub has a big problem with not understanding what QoL means, but this is one of the worst cases of it I've seen.
---
Manta
---
 And poh banners made on banner easel,  and you can have Sara zammy or guthix as your family crest
---
Not even fully 100% efficient, you need tick perfect clicks to get that
---
Depends on the subject too. I'm begging that, for example, computer science has a lot more rs players than art history.
---
Truth, preach it!
---
Hope it's like my cerb luck. Completed with 3 prims and smoldering stones, 2 jars in 750 kills. Will eventually go back for the pet. 
---
The only way to train rc
---
There's no need for a RC buff. Just deal with it. It got buffed with RC on zeah
---
Then you've got noone but yourself to blame
---
beautiful
---
4206 huh. Nice pin.
---
Bruh, wtf, that was what I dealt with back in high school. We literally studied old exams and quizzes and then got threatened with expulsion for cheating because the teacher was too lazy to change things up. That shit is fucking stupid. Hope you got out of it okay because it required multiple law suits for us to get our grade.

Shrimp and prawns are different creatures.
---
Monks, but since I'm working towards 99 cooking atm, I'll probably save some karambawans/sharks and use those.
