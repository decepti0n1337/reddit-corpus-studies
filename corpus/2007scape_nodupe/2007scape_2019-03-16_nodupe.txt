Hahaha nah Im not interested in 99s. I play casually because I actually have things going for me outside of osrs lol
---
No not anymore
---
Would of traded out the snek for a mutagen tbh
---
Doesn’t look shopped to me I’m no expert tho 
---
Oh, but it actually is. 
---
Support. RS3 actually has a quest in the dwarf questline that require to dodge and take cover from cannon fire.

*cough* bank rework *cough*

Every step he gets has to be in morytania because he can't leave.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong but this series started in June of 2018, Swampletics started in December of 2018. So how is this a copycat?
---
Yeah  verf was first

The models for the female char and these armours were made YEARS ago with no regard for trying to sexualize the female characters, 
---

---
I highly doubt Andrew or Ian Gower decided to “show a little skin” for female chars to “turn on” the pre pubescent kids that played runescape 2 back in 2002.
---
I doubt initial graphic design in 2000 carried any sort of malicious intent to overly sexualise the female character and its respective armour components.
---
What you shouldn’t do is over react to a couple of pixels that were formed in the basement of the Gower residences which didn’t plan for future repercussions for showing off a little pixel skin,it was probably just to differentiate the genders and make it appealing for females to have their own char in a game dominated by males.
---
I’m sorry to hear your Wife is being constantly harassed on RuneScape, it is something that should be stamped out of society by educating young men, but the inevitable will happen, there will be guys who have never talked to women or never comfortable with them either harassing them, calling them names such as sluts etc.
---
I have NEVER looked at the female armours or the female character as something sexual in my entire 15 odd years of playing RuneScape, I doubt many others here have worked up a fetish from slight pixel skin, maybe a horny teenager going through puberty might have ripped one in honour of it but no reasonable adult is going to get off that.
---
Since you are married, you need to understand the demographics of the user base, there are going to be immature, desperate young guys who will jump at the opportunity to constantly talk to a RuneScape Friend especially if it is indeed a female.
---
If in game reports do not suffice, take screenshots of harassment and email them to jagex. Also a very good way to cut out toxic chat is to set your public chats and Friends chat to private so you only chat with people you want to, it’s not like guys on this game haven’t been harassed by toxic keyboard warriors, just add them to the ignore list and get on with your life.
---
Maz is horrible at her job. Findings cleaning did not need a buff as it was one of the small boring 'grinds' of the game. I think this game, being a 2007 game in it's core, should have more content like that, unfortunately, they ruined it.
---
Does OSRS also have the same problem as RS3 with protection prayers not reducing damage from attacks after the boss dies?
---
I bet it gets really hot in that sub
---
Should be on the wiki, might have to do a little math
---
No I'm not doing anything for you. I'm just maintaining the moron bit until something to the contrary happens. 
---
I'm baffled that you went out of your way to take the original post completely at face value.  
---
  
---
Every idea posted in this subreddit is nothing more than 'pay-dirt' that you have to put through the MLM water-wheel machine that is Reddit, to get the actual ore (so to speak).   
---
Some of it is coal, some of it is runite ore.  
---
   
---
The assumption you just made on my behalf assumes that this idea would be added to the game EXACTLY as it was typed. Which has essentially never happened in the entire history of OSRS. All ideas have been tweaked and modified to some extent. 
---
"Just because you like the idea doesn't make it good, creative, or original."   
---
Again you're putting words in my mouth.  
---
Read my original comment. Not ONCE did I say it was "good". I said it was creative and original. And it is. To argue against that is literally dumb AF. There was no idea, and then *poof* there was a new idea that nobody has ever thought before. That's literally what those words mean.  
---
RAW creative 'pay-dirt' ideas are absolutely what churns this Subreddit. I have not yet seen a single Reddit post that ever got it right on the first try. In fact, majority of the time the real idea is in the comments section. 
---
      
---
And please if you're going to reply, read this before you put more words in my mouth:

---
max efficiency it's not much more than an hour.
---
The posters above say a clue step from any clue of the same difficulty counts towards the step count, so from my limited understanding you would just need 4 clues with the initial step in mory. 
---
How exactly am I  getting supplied with cannonballs when I play on ironmode only?
---
I edited my post and gave you an example. Are you happy? 
---
Is this real?
---
&gt; Why is it most suggestions come from Jmods tho?
---
It's literally part of their job? If jagex just wanted coding slaves they'd fire literally the entire current dev team. Having devs with ideas/thoughts of their own is a good thing, they may see areas of improvement/good ideas that the community hasn't thought of.
---
One thing RS3 did recently for their Comp Cape poll was split it into two identical polls: one for everyone and one for players who currently owned a Comp Cape. I think something like that may be helpful in OSRS so they can see what the overall community wants and what the subcommunity wants. The issue is how they use that information; for example, if it passed the general poll but failed the subcommunity poll, does it get added and how do they decide? Also, it is not always easy to define subcommunities. Like if you are polling a Hydra change, you could make the subcommunity poll require Hydra KC but if it is something broader like a PvP change, how do you count a PvPer? Especially since some PvP changes aren't just limited to Wilderness, BH, and PvP worlds and they could impact Clan Wars, Castle Wars, and other forms of PvP.

Did he think the twitter support account would give him a different answer? Maybe he needs some help with read comprehension?
---
Apparently, I'm honestly shocked. I had no idea this sub and game were so infested with incel losers. It's honestly really sad.
---
yes thats correct, sorry my wording was bad. He has to get 3-5 complete-able steps, spread out across multiple clues, to have a chance at getting a casket. Doesn't matter if the next step isn't in morytania as long as he has enough to get to that threshold
---
I JUST did the museum cleaning right before they updated it T\_T
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It was terrible.  I spent hours Picking up rock. cleaning rock, picking up rock, cleaning rock.  It just went on and on and on.
---
On top of that, it rewards no xp, gives you a bunch of pointless junk, and is all RNG so has no sense of progression, even after you do get a worthwhile item.  It's a piece of content that just feels like a bully that spits on you and calls you a little bitch,  but you can't do anything about it.
---
Although this update fixes none of these problems, at least it takes out the worst part of the task- straight tedium.

Oh shit we found the femenist

Can’t say this is why 100%, but from just my experience coming back four days ago I have gotten like 8k just from maybe 10-12 Konar tasks.   So multiply that by how many people are doing Konar and selling their pess.

I thought you meant elemental ones I think.

Does anyone want to be wake up buddies? I want to get up at 6am every day and exercise, but I can never motivate myself, but knowing that I will be letting you down each day if I don't do it, might encourage me. It's worth a try anyway.

Thanks for the tea m8. Would have scrolled past that lol-fest had your comment not alerted me. A gracious updoot should suffice. Good day.

And have to get back, hop and all that? Also need an alt same cb level so thats probably high ranged so you'd need defence or brews.

That sounds annoying to me

Are you the one ruining my Tarromin buys?

Also I feel you I’ve been doing the same thing. Currently at like 43 herb
---
Alternatively keep the staff of air and sell the others, as you should virtually never melee with a staff which is the only benefit, and you could sell the battlestaves for some extra gp.
---
Can someone explain to me what this lure is and how it works. I'm 100% confused. Why would someone step next to two skulled guys wearing BIS melee with claws in a PVP zone? 
---
I'm perm muted and i agree
---
Sell gf?
---
You were right until the last sentence 
---
in my opinion having a novelty account is pretty silly if you arent using it to pk. Unless you really love playing a diversified version of the game that requires planning in order to not "ruin" the account then by all means more power to you. You can aleays try it until you get bored of it which is also an option.
---
But saying a locked ironman is the off brand of swampletics makes no sense. Neither of them were the first of their kind, but they both make enjoyable content.

I will never return

I was doing harralander. Got from 32 to 43 before my hand hurt too much to continue.
---
I use ToG to level hunter instead of rc. Don't know what it is but I just don't want to do it. Only thing I've hunted was a lizard for morytania diary. 
---
No it’s definitely rune in the picture
---
Who would craft their own staves? You can buy any of them from Zaff and crafting them would be inefficient xp/gp-wise.
---
C
---
I kept trying to do Harralander but the buys were to infrequent to not make me go mad. We can own the cleaning herb market together in peace
---
I left when I got mine because I had people leave on me for 5 runs in a row. Also someone who said they were gonna come back so we were sittin in the waiting room for mad long and he never came back.
---
Imagine filling in all those checkboxes as a person.
---
You are correct. But by playing some mental gymnastics dec 2018 came first therfore swampletics has been a locked uim since before Einstein could walk.
---
Agility level?
---
ff14 sort of. Combos are normally 1-2-3-4 but are 1-1-1 in pvp. As in, you still go true thrust vorpal thrust full thrust, but do so by hitting 1 three times instead of hitting 1-2-3
---
the first kc is the most brutal so you would have to take initiative and find people willing to teach you, normally I would direct you to the we do raids discord but they have recently made it a requirement for you to at least make it to VerZik before you can be taken to a learner raid.

Nah he says something like “now a 73” like directly after that I just watched the clip

how can you honestly think this is a good idea?

I played RS2 in 2004-06, I tried to play RS3 last year but it was way too confusing, I really want to start it as there is soo much content, lore quests and stuff, but god, I have never been so lost and confused in my life when I logged onto my account after 12 years lmao
---
Wrong. 
---
Yeah, I hadn't even considered that Incestral Bottoms could be a *place*
---
If you look at the price trend the last couple months... They actually went up after the celastrus trees came out.... And I are now dropping hard. I've been banking mine lately instead of selling asap, since hopefully like all items, they will eventually go up again. Just how the market is sometimes

I don't have the link, but there is an official place to go to appeal some 'unappealable' bans. You have to answer a few questions, and they say they'll reply within 28 days. I just did it somewhat recently and got my ironman unbanned. Took them maybe a week to reply.
---
Saw the link on some thread about someone else getting hacked and banned, sorry I can't provide it directly.

Can magic boosts allow me to equip items at a higher lvl requirement? I need to equip a black salamander for an elite clue, and want to know if I can just boost for it.

Walked into the room and got Bronze Def on my first kill and Iron on my second. Mithril took me something like 360 kills though

WHY ARE WE YELLING

How can you honestly not?

I had the same problem when I went back to rs3 just to see the new updates; only saw a couple other players the entire day I was logged in and they were maxed level. It felt so empty without players everywhere doing random silly shit.

During the 2013 birthday event it’s confirmed that Kree’arra is male.

I agree except for pures. I may be a bit ignorant about it, but from my perspective, the whole point of a pure is to fuck with normal players who want to play normally. The game gives you basically 0 information on the usefulness of defense, but since the entire game revolves around leveling up, you are very likely to train the skill as a noob. Any normal player has no idea how much defense influences combat level, and it isn't even an important consideration for early players. Then you go to the wilderness and get destroyed by someone you thought was close to your combat level, but actually has a huge strength and attack advantage. The wilderness is a cool idea of risk/reward, but the risk isnt fun when it consists of people looking up guides to abuse the combat level formula to easily kill normal players. Im not gonna say "fuck you" every time I see a pure in the game, but I just dont think its a harmless account type like ironmen, area restricted meme, ect

Welcome back

Yep he’s entirely at fault. Very naive. Tough lesson to learn.

Can ironmen not just get the levels required for these items without boosts...?

Damn, he said “Hi &lt;3”, a friend would’ve told you to go fuck yourself.

Revs are a great example of why PVM content in a PVP area is bad. It gets immediately taken over by the big team of assholes.

Most certainly.  He seems like quite a friendly guy. Tbh I’ve never seen his series and only recognized the name from browsing this subreddit.  I just started watching it tonight and it’s pretty great.
---
Everything pre EOC was peak RuneScape change my mind
---
I’ll never forget when they undid mine. Apparently I was botting back in like 2014 or something? (Hadn’t played since 08). Thx Jagex!!
---
I always have my email and password saved in the client, but when I tried to log in it said "invalid credentials" so I tried multiple mails I have used and different passwords.
---
I know my in-game name and the password I always have used to that account but I can not for my life remember my email. How can I solve this?? This is really depressing.
---
If u can manually type friends name into your list, you can add any codes you want.
---
The content entering the game is suppose to be community driven, that’s what they say is so good about this game. However that’s not the case when Jmods streamline their own content. 
---
Tbh it doesn't get any better idk why I play :( 
---
Well the point of the minigame is to make cannonball smelting faster, so if players are forced to reset without any second chances then it somewhat defeats the purpose.
---
They don’t suggest improvements though, they suggest expansions to the game. Why did they want to add warding for example? Because announcing the new skill would result in more players, at least in their own eyes.
---
;oh shit you're right. Thanks

I have a quest cape, if i'm that concerned about a few points then i'd wear that

You're not really "risking" anything when you just attack 3-iteming pvmers.

I respect that man. I’m on my grind a little bit at a time as well. I pretty much only get to play on mobile these days.

Guess you could say I’m a mobileman haha.

Feel free to add me in game if you’d like! I’m always up for making new friends.

I mean its not like the tier of weapon is even a little repevant right now, so ofc. They could make bow scythe lance dhcb t90 weapons and nothing would change.

Level to wear isnt a useful factor for the weapons strength outside pvp

I more meant that only putting your gold-selling bank on a 3 year hiatus for your gold selling/botting is a lot better than those items getting deleted.

Lmao what is this sentence

On that champion scroll grind huh? Gl it took me about 15k kills to get one.
---
oof no champion scroll.
---
Do you have a source for that?

Bank it before you lose it

Idk, dwarf cannon quest + 50 agil and smith are low requirements so suicide bots likely will be doing this. Look how heavily blast furnace is botted.

I see you are a man of culture as well

Great, I'm glad they did. It turned out perfect
---
Are you going around and begging for gold wtf, what do you mean 24m free

Yeah I bought the mahogany costume room flatpacks right when I unlocked the costume room just so I'd always have max space available. Paid like 15k/piece or something but it was worth it.

IM HEADING THAT WAY NOW BOYOS

So you then didnt also start a new account???
---
Jagex should include evidence of any offense as far as mutes go. I think it’s fucking ridiculous you can be banned and it just says “Moderator comment”... thanks.

Is that a real thing........where can i get in on that

I just assume statements like that are to get a response from people like you and u/bicke_chutt because they know it will and i guess they don't get attention anywhere else in their life, i don't believe people are that willfully ignorant

Nope random dudes just come up to me...I gotta sext for about 10 mins but I’ve had 2 different ppl just toss me 10m and a few others equaling 4m lol  I’ll take it :)

Maybe if jagex actually polled good pvp updates theyd pass but they seem to be a little lost and the pvp community doesnt seem to really be offering any suggestions or is even more split
---
Depends on the method you use.
---
&gt;fletching
---
If you fletch longbows for example you don't lose any money but you don't really profit much either. 
---
&gt;cooking
---
Cooking you actually profit, just cook the highest level food you can that can't burn (you need to work this out by checking the wiki for burn rates) and you will make a couple of mil profit to 99.
---
I find the most important thing is to have a house with only the ground floor and 3x3 or 4x4, to reduce loading lag. I have tree/ring/pool to the north, nexus to the right, achievement gallery to the left (crafting cape, altar and jewelry box) and costume room to the south. I don't ever feel the need for anything else PvM-wise, so feel free to play around.

🦀Microtransactions are only a matter of time🦀

I've heard that sometimes Jmods will make small changes to tutorial island without announcing them to purposefully mess up crappy bots, this could be that happening.

Yep, most services score the email way down if the rdns doesn't match, the domain doesn't point to the originator, or the originator isn't on the list of authorized senders.

It's otherwise a wild west out there. Works out pretty well.

In RS3 I can’t type anything at all, a message just appears in the chat box telling me I’m permanently muted. In OSRS I can type and it’ll appear, but no one else can see it, whether it’s public chat, private chat or clan chat.

Bro you didn't even play yet.

Stay strong Jagex, remember, this was polled and over 1/3rd of the player base including myself voted "No" to hiding poll results. Don't let a small vocal minority deter you.

There’s little boxes on the bottom right corner of your bank that should say 1 , 5 , 10 , X , All. Once you withdraw something a X amount of times you can just click that X in your bank and once your click something in your bank it withdraws however many X was before :) hope I helped lol

parameter
---
totally. it's not as if people kill ironmen all the time or people just doing clue scrolls. they're 100% just getting bested by a better player where the only skill involved is clicking the special attack button and who's spent hundreds of hours to make an account specific to kill other players so they can pick on low levels.
---

Never heard of these areas,  were they polled? If so i havnt seen the results to make my own decision to vote what everyone else already voted for.

Generally, yeah. It's nice to have the digsite and xeric's amulets right near the poh entrance, plus I use at least 4-5 of the nexus' teles somewhat often (b staves, tree runs, slayer locations) so it's not bad at all.

Plus, it’s a middle name. It’ll create nick names or never do anything. It’ll be up to him if it’s ever used. As a 28 year old, I’ve never used my middle name for anything. Only those closest to me even knows what it is. I would never make it a first name because I’m sure that would be means for bullying, but as a middle name it serves no negative possibilities. ☺️

You could also try right clicking! This makes it so if you miss you don’t lose the spell and saves you and inventory space from the slayer staff. Also I’ve found that if right clicking has a more forgiving hit box as well.

No? Its mind numbingly slow to train skills at lowers levels with MTX. It's far more efficient to actually play the game (Complete quests, train the actual skill, do D&amp;D's) than it is to purchase keys.

Yeah it’s still about 200k a hour without the equipment drops. Run time is pretty important to. At least 7 runs a hour will put you in some profit. Any less then that and you will be better off doing another money making method.

These are the stats of a blue dragon. I'm trying to figure out what style combat it would be weakest to. In my understanding you add the monsters base defence lvl + their defensive stats in the style you use. But magic would be the monsters base magic lvl + their defensive stat in magic.
---
So range would be 95+50, stab 95+50, slash 95+70, crush 95+70
---
and magic would be 1+60
---
Is this accurate? Wouldn't that make them much weaker to magic than any other style?
---
" Well for all the players that worked hard and got 99 mining the “old way” would feel like they wasted their time being that they changed it. " - I don't think this is a problem since rune ore mining is absolutley horrible xp. This would not really be a good way of training mining just a way of reciving runite ore without the world hopping content  
---
" and this change would change the market. " - This is actually false I think. Rune ore prices are actally protected by high alchemy. So I am 99% certain the price of runite ore would stay almost exactly the same! The same way rune plate legs would not drop in price if there was something that brought more of them into the game!  
---
" I mean, this isn’t “EasyScape”, right? " - Yes you are right! It's really important for me that this content would not be overpowered!  
---
I hear you and I appreciate your feedback! Thanks! :)

Ahaha yeah it was so dumb. I got muted for saying "you're welcome" to someone cause the word welcome has the word com in it so it thought I was advertising a website.

It did take me 3 tries before I finally did it. But after I got my rhythm, it was an absolute breeze. So much so, I immediately added it as a slayer task. Now that thing I was so worked up about, is nothing more than great slayer xp.

You are every bit of pathetic imaginable. Luckily I can block and move on. But you're actually a fucking tool, and you must seriously have some home life issues or a serious inferiority complex. Thats the only way to describe literally every comment you make. Trying way to hard to make yourself feel better i suppose on the internet.

The flicks are easy. It's when the healers come out that everyone gets a bit flustered. Personally, I keep my prayer on range and switch to mage only during the mage attacks, then immediately back to range before the next attack. If he does 3 mage attacks in a row, it feels a bit dumb, but it makes it only having to pay attention to one attack, instead of two. For *me*, that was the game changer. Made jad absolutely trivial. You may have to find your own method. But you'll get it.
---
The length doesn't bother you as much as you may think. Especially for the first time, you're so hyperfocused on what you're doing, you don't even realize that 75 minutes passed. Then you start getting it down to an hour or less. Just give it a shot. If you give up after the first try, so be it. You tried. Eventually you'll try again, and again, and finally get it because you know what to expect.

Obviously. I don't disagree....

void, salve ei, dhide boots, blowpipe with rune/addy darts, archer ring, melee helm, bgs, warrior ring.  I use warrior &gt; berserker since I only have 75 attack.  rest is rune pouch, dueling ring, 3 super restores, 2 brews, range pot, super combat, antifire, antivenom, mantas

i didnt get 4 kills every time.  you have to judge if you can go for 4th based on how much food you have left.  some really unlucky trips or if i messed up i got 2 kills

Every time Jagex tries to do something, a very large number of the 'PVP community' start screaming bloody murder and Jagex has to back the heck off.
---
And then, simultaneously these people complain about the lack of PVP updates, how Jagex betrayed them by not bringing a promised BH rework and so on. 
---
Not to mention actual content (not content disguised as integrity changes) actually has to pass a poll - and the PVP community have made themselves thoroughly disliked by a large part of the playerbase who vote no.
---
Also PVP issues (such as loot keys) do inherently affect the game for non PVPers, so there are additional hurdles to pass with polls. 
---
Roflmao. This is great!

yes

There are other ways of making money lmao. I make 500k / day from farming, done ds2, but not even close to half the slayer req for mm2. I also make millions from hunter, have decent combat stats and don’t have any plans to train cb outside of nmz.

I don’t buy gold/bonds.

i dont believe for a second he made 1.3b off of farm runs and having less than 69 slayer. You are completely ignorant if you think anyone in this game has a 1b+ bank without doing a lot of pvm. Whether it be zulrah, vork, cerb, cox, tob, etc.

They spoke about it on a livestream once and made a kinda fair point, they said theyre a bit hamstrung because any changes they make aren’t fair to the small but very passionate communities that still play CWars, and they’d rather just make a whole new minigame than change something that had a passionate following
---
If the majority uses adblock then a few people not doing so makes no difference. These days, a lot of people view from mobile, TV and console, so no adblock. 
---
Years back people didn't even make money from this shit, or do it as a job. These days the people who do make money and are full time content creators, are not that creative. It's a lot of forced pumped out content because that's how you make ad revenue. Those who are worth their salt find success on Patreon and Twitch to help. Those models work far better than traditional ads.

It says "you have obtained 0 rock golem" yet there's a rock golem in the inventory...

Looks like OP has one in his inventory but the collection log doesn't reflect that. Took me a minute since it's on the edge of the screen.

It's used as tank gear on alts and we are getting crystal here soon. 
---
He probs got it before the collection call.

Triggered, no. Disappointed no one has has anything to rebut my statement, yes. Is a few back and fourths so much to ask? Grinding is boring on both games so I looked here for a lil entertainment. Guess it's just a bunch of pretentious Rs3 fans. Weird they don't stick to their own reddit, maybe cause their game sucks.

Totally thought that was a lantern when i first saw it.

Dude anything related to blackjacking or the mage training arena is poison to me, I've done it on my main and not ever going to come close to that again
---
No problem. Adding on to what I said before with the MM2 bosses, if you do it right you'll only be hit once or twice by each of the bosses during the fight before you can flinch or safespot them, probably a few more times by the gorillas. BUT you will be hit by Gloughs final phase every time you attack since you will be drawn within range of his attacks. Kruk, gorillas, and Glough fights are all instanced but are easily done with budget gear and a trusty one click teleport out for ease of mind.
---
You got this. Grats on the quest cape in advanced!

\*bug, and I said the *main* issue. From this comment I'm inferring that you mean knowledge of how the scam works has no impact on the number of people susceptible to it, which is false.
---
Toxicity and negativity don't help, man. Should I have gone? No. If I had known how the scam worked, would I have fallen for it? No. It's a dark day when people have to be inherently distrustful of one another; maybe you're already there, but I'm not even after this. Try giving some more insightful opinions than pure insults please.
---
Agreed. I've said it before. It killed mercantilism and replaced it with some stock market bullshit. Everything used to be so organic. The world felt alive and was an escape for me in my youth. Now the game feels dead to me. I had relationships developed with suppliers and buyers of goods and you could actually make a profit on items. Now I never interact with other players and skills feel like either a grind just to level or a grind to hit a quest requirement.The GE removed a necessary part of the medieval experience, the marketplace.

How do I join a fun clan? I just returned to OSRS after a while and decided to go member. I'm having a blast but I am constantly paranoid about the player base declining (the drama on this subreddit does not help). I know the player base is actually growing right now and I want to take advantage of this. I just want to erase the feeling that I am grinding alone and by the time I get to the endgame, everybody will be gone. Advice would be appreciated. 
---
I am a level 63 combat  50x52x50 att x strx def 50 range and 67 mage. I love osrs because of the economy and pking, but I love skilling and PvM as well. I just love the game. Please note that I am a noob.

April 2nd: "We can't figure out how to undo what we did"
---
But Jordan Peterson would.
---
Is it Wednesday yet?
---
I once got a warning for saying "I know Andrew Gower". Jagex used to be strict as hell. You could be muted for saying "noob". Also there was no way to disable the filter. I guess they know that their main players are 20-30+ now.
---
Definitely not... Tennyson is dope as fuck.
---
Viewing his post history makes me sad for him.

FIRMLY GRASP IT

We should wait until the economy is ruined to fix it?
---
Check out the unrestricted worlds (like US 443) you still have to do the whole cave but in max gear it’s like 40 minutes then you can practice pray switched when you get to jad, also if you F up you get an extra life to try again at jad.
---
I still remember this tosh.o web redemption.  Classic.
---
What’s that then?
---
Seers village was just so alive back then with the people picking flax making bowstrings or cutting maples/yew/magics.
---
It's still alive as an agility spot at least
---
God has left us
---
Everything this dude says is a joke 
---
Literally at Seer’s right now cutting down Maples.
---
My IGN is Unholy Moley. Mole pet is all that I've ever longed for.
---
Imagine being this lazy oh my lord haha
---
I remember crying for being muted when I was like 10 but there isn't a mute on my history.
---
Whale is just someone who risks more in pvp than they should at the skill level they are at. IE I'm a semi decent pker but not the best so if I walked around in ancestrals id be a whale. 
---
Doesn't matter if it's purely cosmetic. It shouldn't be locked behind the wilderness period. Clans will camp there for a loooong time, black graceful is honestly one of old schools more anticipated items.

Runescape is much like one piece... There is an End goal of maxing. But it's the journey that counts. People should not sacrifice the journey

oh wait this isn't karamja only

The days of having to say "wdf" instead of "wtf" as well.

Now you can make your username IDRINKCUM

It just happened again lol https://clips.twitch.tv/FrozenFreezingClintCoolCat

This happened when they changed gloves a little while ago, its been reported. Not a priority it seems.
---
Well that's settled then, folks.

Had a popped appendix in my gut for a week.  Liquid for the past 3 years.  I now get exercise though.  A lot of Cardio and strength training.  Shit has its advantages.

So you think more than 370 people have grinded a completely dead minigame for 60 hours to get an item nobody would recognize or care about?
---
Hell, since TB is a group minigame, *could* you even do it if you wanted to without tricking all your friends into doing it? Is there a community for it?
---
I have the glowing dagger! I thought it was neat so I held onto it.

Ayy, don't listen to the other people on here. They're just trolls trying to incite a reaction, or salty they got scammed in a similar way and taking it out on you. You didn't know, nothin wrong with that. Hope it doesn't get ya too down or make want to quit.
---
True but the longer you’re in the cave, the higher the odds of you running out of supplies are. I can usually finish with addy darts with about 3 restores and 6-7 sara brews left
---
Kc 6 here haha. Now we just need 1, 2 and 3!
---
Is that not rs?
---
I think many of us do appreciate them. We make memes about how God ash is a god and people love the game. But criticism has to be made. Keep in mind to some of these criticisms you're hearing non stop now are criticisms that WERE steadily given before and it didn't work. That's why it's amped up now. People have wanted actual customer support for years. People have complained about contest winners not getting their prizes the first time it happened. But nothing changed when the sub was tame about it. So now every meme is a crab rave cause that's what it takes to get even a real response.
---
If we make it to baby #3 that’ll be the most likely one I could convince her to go with Guthix. 
---
Get telegrab and do wines of zammy, Or if you wanna world hop you could buy gems for cheap and sell em for alot more profit at the g.e.
---
This is confusing.

I don’t even know either of those yet. I guess I know the maiden name, but really everyone does in the FB group for osrs lol. 
---

I wouldn't say Yanille is a close teleport. At least not an easy one. 
---
There wasn't a diary toggle for Watchtower teleport yet and no nmz either. I think the fastest would've been just the POH teleport near Bert's shack.
---
For that reason it felt a little more exclusive than the other banks for me.
---
Ok I mean, I love this kind of content. Couple thoughts tho.
---
1. Black borders are extremely disturbing. You may want to resize your client or fit the client into the video properly.
---
2. Background noise is instant turnoff.
---
3. Cutting content straight from livestream seems lazy. Maybe a bit effort on top of just taking clips from your own stream or explain what you are doing.
---
For ds2, get your ranged up as far as you can. I did it at 114 combat with only 78 ranged and had to resort to using full invents of brews to outlast the two dragon bosses. As for the Robert Boss, he's very strong vs. ranged so you will need a second combat style vs him. You're not going to get killed by the bosses so much as you will run out of supplies during the fights, especially with only 70 ranged.

Blocking Mat K won't protect you from the wrath of all the knights of Falador castle

I really dont understand how it happened. I didnt use any external sites that require me to login with my rs info, any atlernative launchers, nothing. It just happened and im not sure. My pc is a pile of dog doo so osbuddy and the other launchers with the skilling calculators, and merching etc use too much cpu. So hence why i never used em'. Cant run anything but the old jagex launcher. 
---
 First thing i did was run a malware scan on my pc when i saw the ban for botting. And nothing. Only thing i can think is it was bruteforced. Or my email got compirimised ( which is why i unlinked all remembered devices and only kept my laptop and phone, then added additonal security measures.)
---
However it happened, your guess is good as mine dude. Cause im clueless. 
---
farming is brainless, figuring out what seeds you need and in what order you do your runs is the only maybe difficult thing
---
sad reacts only
---
I’m learning solo raids after completing 7 team raids like a year ago, and god damn I feel this. Two completed so far, first one I went through 80 god damn brews at olm. My second attempt I managed in a measly 30 brews.
---
Yikes mate, cool it
---
Made this joke with my username :^)
---
Try to change it back to the brown colour?
---
Thank you, someone gets it
---
It's a attempt on a log-in skulltrick. He attacks you, starts to fumble an escape until he's on a spot where he can log-out/log-in on a different account with a similar setup.
---
He or someone like him tried to same while i was doing fire giants yesterday. Either don't chase or bring something to kill them quickly.
---
I got baited and got skulled for black mask archers ring and blowpipe and suddenly his 'main' in max mage got on me. He was not able to kill me while I only had 8 sharks, 2 ppots and was in black hides. 
---
skull-trick
---
yep, it's a fairly straight forward move. I got greedy at fire giants yesterday but they failed miserably.
---
Fixing the nets in piscarillius was dumb af. The rest of it was fine though.

you won't be muted for things that the filter catches
---
it's only when something gets past the filter or is obviously offensive in context then you can get muted
---
Added, thank you! 😊

Is there a way to force myself to get the task besides just spending all my points?

To be fair this is a game integrity switch that should’ve happened ages ago. It took me around 618 hours to receive one dig site pendant, which is actually pretty ridiculous.

Loool. I remember grinding green drags non stop for about two weeks to get £14m for my first whip (I was maxed combat at the time). Nowadays that would take me a few hours of slayer or PVM. 
---
It’s weird how things have changed in gp terms, but I guess the most expensive items now probably take even longer to get. 
---
Adding you now hun xx

Sounds like a typical VB drinker.

---
This is so sad, Alexa please play Crab Rave
---
Yeah, that would be better. But I'm also thinking of how many bots are going to be farming these clues. I wanted a normal f2p player to be able to get a really good drop every now and then. That way they can get a bond if thats what they want, or they can use it for skilling if that's what they desire.
---
The best olm fights are the ones when p1 and p2 ya drink just 1 brew and on P3 and head get the team passing brews around to not die
---
I don't think he reported me, at least I hope not. There were at least 3 very obvious bots on our world that were all running the same script. I watched them for a few inventories and they all stopped on the exact same tiles for the exact same amount of time every single pass. 
---
I usually don't report people sitting idle because I feel like the bots never stop. Seeing a player standing still and wasting xp usually indicates a real player in my eyes. I could be wrong though.
---
I’m 11k dry atm (:
---
I dont get it, if there is a boss in wildy. No one is forcing u to farm it. Either take the risk or don't enter the wilderness. I swear ppl will go somewhwre just to cry about the negatives..
---
That is not why they did it, /u/GOODMORNINGGODDAMNIT ... this guy is very wrong lol.
---
They did it so that they could force players to stake exact amounts (to stop X'ing, which was often used by RWTers and scripters) and so that they could tax absolutely everything.
---
If people staked items still, they could get around the tax by staking items that have weird grand exchange values and other shenanigans. 
---
Stakers  buying and holding valuable items was never a reason to begin with, this guy is full of shit.

Why has no one mentioned using a guthix rest on another type of npc? Isnt it the vyres or something? Maybe if you convert it to a feral vampyre you get more xp when you kill it or herb xp like broodoos work? Im completely speculating and dont know anything about it but i havent seen this theory suggested at all.
---
Not true. In the case of Canada legal weed is insanely expensive for its price. Its 12$ a G for a 15% thc strain. Meanwhile you could get the same quality bud for 5$ a G from a dealer.

What a classic response, this is amazing.
---
One of the best ideas yet. Completely catered to F2P yet still isn’t something useless or lackluster.

Also I like 1/100 rate you mentioned. I could see them only being like 10k gp a piece, which would honestly be fine. Great suggestion!

I don't think he reported me, at least I hope not. There were at least 3 very obvious bots on our world that were all running the same script. I watched them for a few inventories and they all stopped on the exact same tiles for the exact same amount of time every single pass. Could be a coincidence, but I'm 95% sure they were bots on the same script.

I’m missing the joke on the 73 part.
---
Legit question, why would anyone care about something being better in a third-party client when it has 0 effects on you?
---
Outside of the very top of the rankings and pvp, what difference does it make that somebody doesn't have to press one extra click.
---
That’s the knee from the back 
---
around 93 gp each kill, wew

---
Initiate pures were my favorite pures from back in the day! now they are total obsolete. I might have seen 1 in my entire time on osrs. I guess with zerkers they are just outclassed. 
---
&gt;so they can see it's always been a terrible game 
---
which rock have you been living under lol, wow has definitely not always been terrible, I'd say WoD and BfA are its low points, but don't forget about EoC/RS3 either.  
---
It had 0 ho when it hit the 30
---
I have full armadyl, slayer helmet, blow pipe (Addy darts and dragon for had). It's all max gear except for pegasians and twisted bow

But that’s just it. It’s a game and if you put in the effort yourself you take pride in that.

Go for it lol

Here's a link to a support page that might answer your question but also has a link to contact the billing team to get help with it

---
What does it matter what others think? If you know you put the effort in then you can pride yourself on that no matter what others say.
---
Part of the RuneScape experience is climbing the highscores
---
But if you put the effort in yourself then you can take pride in it despite what others think it’s your account and only you give it value.
---
It goes both ways, really.
---
Yeah just add a whole new team of employees we aren’t asking for much.  The sad thing is the Jmods have nothing to do with such decisions by the community, like yourself, thinks there is some magical “obtain CS team” button. The authenticator delay is a legit thing that I don’t think anybody doesn’t want, I’ll give you that. Idk why it isn’t added. Probably because we have too many idiots concerned about stupid shit like hiding poll results, which failed a fucking poll. 
---
I came to osrs about two months ago. I am a maxed rs3 player and I've dived into osrs hard. I already have quite a few 90+ combat stats and barrows gloves. You have made the right decision. This game is where the passion is. There are complaints with both games, obviously the front page has been memeing a lot lately about quite a few different topics, but it doesn't near the laundry list of problems in rs3. It genuinely feels like the rs3 devs don't care about the players. Osrs is where the passion is.
---
Maybe you can’t 
---
Erm it was catherby bank 
---
I’ve never once checked the high scores and they don’t matter to me so I would say that’s not really true I play the game to have fun and take pride in my own accomplishment. Despite what others think of my high score standings.
---
If you were an rs3 player you'd know that you guys aren't any where near that. However, I understand you need to be constantly afraid of it to prevent it from happening.
---
only 1 clue scroll?

Always bots there, most get banned before they reach the top deck fortunately. Nothing to worry about though. You won't get banned if you're a legit player even if you're reported for botting :)

We were kids then. You can't get your childhood back

I’d like to be clear that I’m not talking about 2 or 3 ticking trees the way people have done it for awhile. I’m talking about literally just being under attack while chopping. Most of my research is saying this should not affect xp rates, but I am noticing a slight difference, and that’s what sparks curiosity.
---
Yes, but you're from the game where the highscores don't mean anything :p
---
WC guild essentially killed all other Wcing locations.
---
What a joke
---
Double D was also a literal genius. So I’d be fine with that. However, Rolf would be the ideal child. 
---
Yeah I'm having a hard time believing RS3's devs removed the option to play on fixed mode.
---
Mine was ~1.5k :) but it's hard to complain going dry on goblins... They're like 2k kills an hour 
---
I put the 4 rotations on my background, then dragged my client to align with the phase it was on. Still took me 5 tries, but once you get like 30 kills you'll start doing it automatically. :) Best tip I got was log out if the second phase is the mage and go back in.
---
You must have never used Bootcamp.
---
Took me 7 tries but I got it at 70 range and 90 combat, just get some YouTube tutorials and learn how to deal with the healers and you are sweet ❤️

There’s an update one for 2017’s data and the rarest items on that list are Kegs, Cup of milky nettle tea, and Greenmans ale (all at 1)

3/10 - Too much hair.
---
Idk that would be a ton of extra work for swords people are going to be using for 20 min or an hour before they level up o the next tier. 
---
I would say just do it for rune, or maybe rune and addy. That way people will actually get a reward they can use for a decent amount of time.
---
11 years old btw
---
??? I can think of maybe two place where using this is a big advantage and that's prayer training and charter ships. Compare that to stuff like tile markers and the gorilla plugin.

Typical pkers. Training countless of hours. Spending millions of gp just to go and pk spades...

That also depends on your rg lv

Double Teamed

What makes you think people voting no in polls are the same people using runelite..?
---
You type this but i guarantee you play on a third party client as well. 
---
Chance based...Basically lootboxes. Whilst not a great addition, it's not as gamebreaking or generous in XP. You still get 2 keys a day as mem and are able to get more without paying a dime.
---
Instead of switching out of the rs app to the text app, when you see the text come through the notification, pull down on it and you can answer it without leaving your current app. 
---
I honestly don't understand the point of your comment. You practically just repeated yourself. Black desert is an Asian MMO, many games there are designed with MTX in mind. Most people get into that knowing full well that it is or learn pretty quickly that it is. I don't know anything about archage so I can't say anything about that. 
---
As for your second sentence, please reread my first paragraph. 
---
Botters are a completely different discussion I’m not willing to get into right now honestly. But as for high scores they really don’t affect me as I really don’t ever actually check them and I understand some people get competitive with RS high scores.
---
But.
---
 It’s really just about taking pride in the account you take time to build up yourself if someone else buys into it that doesn’t affect you whatsoever. But maybe Ithats just me.
---
The idea is that if you got it early in your combat levelling (before addy/rune) then you could unattach it from your old weapon and put it on your new one. 
---
It's also supposed to be an appealing fashionscape item - for example, I could see people putting a red hilt on a black scim and rocking the Slayer cape in the GE. 
---
Is that the connection interrupted message in the top left?
---
MTX are already in OSRS anyway. Want full Bandos? You could whip out your wallet and buy some bonds. 99 construction? Money for planks. But most disregard this because some good comes out of it, a handful of players who don’t want to pay an hours work at a job per month for some reason can get membership. 
---
Phone Authenticator = needs email to log in from any phone. Hacker has your email = hacked. 
---
It can’t be THAT hard to understand, right?
---
Keeps going up because of merchers. Its used to make crystal pickaxe after the new quest that was just polled
---
yes if a program is buggy the only thing you've left to do is buy new computer /s
---
I think a polling system is good and the community is smart, and then I remembered that most didn't want to remove free 99 in combat stats.
---
How would seeing the current state of the game show that the game has always been terrible?
---
Thank you for the feedback! Appreciated. 
---
[The fucking world record is 24 minutes flat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/5ybder/2400_new_fight_cave_record/) No fucking one EVER has done 20 flat. Normal players do not get that fast, ESPECIALLY not on the first try, even if they're in max. You're one hell of a delusional fucker.
---
What was his speed run time for that top?
---
Alright well just like in the OG days you would ask the group chopping yews with you, “wc lvls?” You did that to gage where everyone else is with the skill and you felt pride if you were one of the highest lvls there and if you weren’t then you would want to work harder to be up there.  
---
Fucking wow dude. That's dark. Careful you don't cut someone with that edge. 
---
Jesus Christ sorry for making a mistake. Who hurt you?
---
You could also try bandits but they're pretty crowded too. There's also Flesh Crawlers, which on members is pretty OK money.
---
I have no strong feelings on irremovable vs removable. My logic was just so that lower-leveled accounts that got it early could unattach it from their weaker weapons and put it on their stronger ones as they upgraded. Gilded rarity sounds fine if they can think of no better cosmetics at Beginner tier. 
---
Can you let me know when you next go into the wildy? You look like a pretty free spade
---
^(Technically they're 5 different items from tradeable to 25%)

Thanks for the positive feedback!

What did you expect lol

Ok wow

If you want to do a timer they reset every 10 minutes.

What do you do about the ice barrage one, do you keep him on and range
---
The employees are already there though. They are just making them work on stuff they shouldn't be working on. The MTX team alone for rs3 is bigger than the entire osrs team combined
---
Go buy a lottery ticket too
---
I read you’re first paragraph and chose to ignore it. 
---
Actually I chose to ignore most of it cause it’s the same argument I get thousands of times over. Especially when you linked the sense of pride and accomplishment comment. 
---
It’s that easy. 
---
There a now thousands of games with MTX in them and yet somehow all those people who ignore them are nobodies that don’t count at all. 
---

it was out of date and the way it worked was out of date, it wasn't "buffed" it still takes the same amount of time, it just requires a little less clicking. (which it should)
---
The fancy boots got me. Lmao 
---
Bro ur getting ripped, most dealers I know charge $2 a gram for 20% stuff. 
---
Idk how to attach pics but I got some showing 17m cash being traded and they accepted...it’s not that hard to do tbh...I can’t do it anymore really cause I got 70 prayer and what not so I been levelling up 
---
This is what i'll do.
---
Username checks out, I guess :') 
---
I feel like instead of having one set of hilts for each weapon/metal type but instead have just the 6 hilts that could be attached to all the weapons so there isn't all those hilts in the game.
---
You quit because...you couldn't use fixed screen..? 
---
It's not much of a secret, the ghostly robe mini quest talks about him in detail and Desert Treasure ends in you talking to a guy who literally worships him and I'm sure the Ancient Book mentions him though that's just a guess and not something I know for sure.
---
They would have to recolor so many new items. I'm sure the client could do this without actually implementing new item models, but I'm willing to bet item models are static so They would still be able to use the same models, but would have to create new item placeholders for each color and weapon type.
---
It's due to the large influx of NORMIES
---
Add to daggers also
---
epic
---
Haha oh no I've been baited!
---
now I don't have to constantly tell people that I only listen to _Fireflies_ by Owl City on repeat, they'll just know!
---
But I'll probably still tell them anyways
---
Why FTp2?
---
is that on android pie on a oneplus phone?
---
do you do RFD bosses too?
---
You are able to change them through settings. 
---
Nooby
---
&gt;Alright you win that’s the rarest item
---
I'd wager that the banner is more rare because it's locked behind very dead content most players can't even access.
---
Also, a friend of mine has a champ cape on two separate accounts, pence queen pet, and several other rare "off-the-wall" non tradables/pets... but I don't think even he has 20 hours of trouble brewing under his belt.
---
Not a popular opinion, the game is getting older we should welcome new ideas from players with a fresh perspective.
---
 Also just because someone suggests an idea doesn’t mean it will make it to the live game.
---
Cuz this mans got an 11 inch dic. Like he said he’s a ladies man 
---
Whenever I complain about the gmaul spec I get told by 'veterans' that it has always been this way.     
---
    
---
No, it fucking hasn't.
---
What stops them from taking your payment and still killing you?
---
Its amazing that he managed to do that, I didn't know the spec was that good
---
I like the idea!
---
Not with turmoil
---
Ah, then you shouldn't believe them. :) Jagex can check the logs and if they decline the appeal it's not for nothing.
---
You physically can't. 
---
You can't attach tabs to the bottom of interfaces. 
---
You can't overlay information on top of your minimap. 
---
You can't hide the ribbon. 
---
You can't have everything accessible easily without having to dig through sub menus or a scroll bar.
---
etc.
---
Sure you can make a functional interface that doesn't have everything readily available like fixed would, but then it's not really fixed, is it?
---
I completely agree and think anyone who has the audacity to suggest NEW content for OLD SCHOOL runescape should be punished severely for their hubris.   
---
Hide poll results. 
---
I was pondering this actually, I always play with sound off, and the visual cues seemed easy enough to follow. 
---
Actually, yeah. how do we poll boot helm?
---
Bring back the ballista from 2010scape so low level
---
Players can actually make a difference
---
It took him forever cause he had to sot around waiting for spec to regen.  probably added 15-20minutes 
---
blah blah blah idc about your feelings liberal, didnt ask
---
Fun fact: YouTube's search algorithm considers your previous searches
---
Not sure but I'd say they probably arent supposed to talk about it
---
Thanks :D And happy cake day!
---
Then your character is on RS3. Old School is technically a new game.
---
Love it! 
---
Well then theyd miss out on your return business lol. You can pay by the day, week or month.
---
I started with the day now I just do weeks.
---
Idk, Tal-us-man.
---
That’s what I’m sayin lmao
---
See, I dont know man.
---
I feel like when you first watch him you're like: "The fuck is up with this weirdo?"
---
Then after a few streams you're like "Oh I get it, it's a bit."
---
Then after another few streams you start to realize "This isn't an act. Josh is actually a psycho."
---
I got mine yesterday at 8449, keep going itll come eventually!
---
This was my thought. Brings 132~ items down to like 6. Simple solution.
---
Or liars
---
he will climb mountains to see if you are there.
---
Name checks out
---
Okay didn't know that for this particular clan.
---
But the other day there was a guy who paid like 300 ish mill to join a clan and he got backstabbed by them.
---
I'd say $15 per month is fair :)
---
If this isn't a Mimic Drop it will be one of the biggest blunders in recent history.
---
I had this same problem and requested to have a refund or have the unused membership moved to my other account. I paid for 4 months membership on a unplayed jronman and they gave me 6 months on my pure. Their customer support really isn't that bad. 
---
'All Irons' best cc in game for ironmans
---
Noiceee
---
Instead of making them the same, we could make it so they do considerably less damage than chins but poison everything they splat on.
---
“Meow Talk” cc a good social cc, not Ironman based 
---
This could be circumvented by people posting the current poll on reddit after they voted.  Only real way is hiding till its done
---
I think the consensus is yes because it gives mining exp on top of the crafting exp (the crafting exp rates stays about the same though)
---
Could be worse, could kill 1000 with under 32 qps.
---
anyone else think pets are kind of annoying and would rather just get a big money drop instead most times? like having FM pet is cool, would have rather had the tome tho.
---
Idk if you’re using Konar and have to kill lizards specifically in the desert, but if you’re not region-locked by Konar, I found thaf sulphur lizards in mount Karuluum were so much easier since you only need the special boots, they have better loot, and a cooler is not necessary to kill them
---
I think that happens when your name gets reported to many times.
---
Pkers chose to limit themselves.
---
impressive
---
No he just wanted it to feel like the good old days and as updates kept coming it stopped feeling like that more and more ...
---
Be happy he's back bro stop hating on a fellow scaper.
---
Well he can login but not talk until he has filled out the forced opend select new username prompt
---
Or u just got merked and can't come up with a decent response hahaha 
---
No one has mentioned this yet so I guess I will. There's a completionist clan on OSRS called Totus that has all of the Trouble Brewimg rewards listed as completionist content. As such, quite a few of their members have completed Trouble Brewing in its entirety. Therefore I don't think this item is the rarest ingame at all. It'll be up there but I wouldn't give it top 10.
---
The meta way to get these flags is to use an alt and start the game with just the 2 accounts. 
---
he has 4 items with prot item he didnt lose it
---
Until this post
---
Lol the worst
---
Alts 
---
mage you can just splash, if you dont wanna splash you can do rock/sand/swamp crabs for both mage and range, or if youre a bit higher lvl (70s) do nmz
---
You're trying to use logic against a subreddit that is almost exclusively salty vets circlejerking the latest memes.
---
Good luck with that. 
---
You obviously can't fucking read. The guy I replied to clearly said it's not a rule anymore, which was the ENTIRE fucking reason for my comment. 
---
The only obvious thing here, is that you are dumb as a rock.
---
How is swimming broken
---
If jagex wants, they can show you whatever results they desire. 
---
Hahahaha I'm being elitist when this subreddit is FULL of "no ezscape" and then you see them using runelite. It's even been used by swampletics to cheat in a minigame and everyone is okay with it, yet the whole point of his account is for the challenge? QoL and using it to cheat are different things. Not to mention "QoL" that gives a significant advantage in PvP to those who use it.
---
You know what else would be good "QoL"? If they added autoplay to the game so you don't have to interact with it all :) then you can take all of the challenge out of the game!
---
if you have no runes in your inv at some point then it turns the autocast off
---
Oh true that's weird then
---
Asking for a friend;
---
is there an actual 3 jad simulator per se? for those wanting to practice inferno flicks?
---
Same here
---
You didnt understand anything i said. Are you saying OSRS is the same game that RS was back in 2007? 
---
# I completely agree, new players can go fuck themselves. 
---
He’s talking about swimming underwater at fossil island, it’s one of the best agility methods. IDK how it’s bugged though, I’ve seen plenty of people do it just fine
---
Doesn't seem like something worth the effort due to the technical implementation that would be required.
---
Def a cool idea though.
---
Well after raping and pillaging the master farmer in draynor, i can finally do DT today!
---
credit: /u/vaccumshoes 
---
The game can't do stuff like that unfortunately. 126 new items and models would need to be created, along with the 6 hilts. 
---
No but the look and feel of it is and the mechanics. I'm guessing that's what op was starting to miss.
---
It’s happens in the middle of the fight, I use rune pouches idk if that matters
---
I recently got a bunch of talisman drops while grinding for my essence pouches, and I've been wondering why mind talismans and fire talismans are both ~4k each. 
---
Is it just the fact that they're uncommon so the prices are wacky or do they have some other purpose I'm not aware of (besides RC/tiara).
---
This is really not funny, just shut up and enjoy the memes
---
Haha yes because I'd like to avoid the traps haha
---
As a role-play nerd, I'm looking at those grey and brown hilts
---
Really hope this makes it, and also works on white weaponry
---
As long as its 20% thc i dont care
---
Nope
---
You could get muted/banned for just saying something like myspace or msn messenger, msn was even blocked, you had to say msm
---
No lol YouTube “mustang crowds” and there’s tons of videos of idiots who can’t handle the torque at car shows and they PLOW into crowds of people

changing your password frequently can actually make your account less secure because the manual recovery system asks for multiple passwords, and the more passwords youve had the more possible correct answers there are. the biggest thing is to not use the same password on any other sites
---
It's not on either the page for the chaos druid or the rare drop tables.
---
EU does dst at a different time than the US
---
Swearing isn’t against the rules nowadays iirc.
---
Whos Josh?
---
They removed it for raids, and NMZ too?
---
After the update it said it doesn't.
---
I want to know this to.
---
Look at ur flair 
---
Or just turn the profanity filter off lol
---
ya bad quality are those even achieved? =)
---
it's easy to escape until 40 people log at once
---
Did you not go to the ER when the pain started? I went within 18 hours and they removed it that day, before it ruptured. 
---
A popular twitch streamer and raiding in Method, the best guild in World Of Warcraft.
---
They'll look dope with their Armadyl and Bandos rune armour and probably some of the canifis gloves too. Wouldn't count on them working on white weapons as Beginner Clue Scrolls are aimed at F2P. Thanks for the support!
---
I think you get a maximum of 1 mahogany seed, not sure why you mention that one. As to your question: After doing a farming contract, I'd love to either sell my rewards for a little profit (or some decent profit if I get lucky) or to use the seeds I get. 
---
In short, I want this to be a special tree seed, not some 2 gp apple tree seed even iron man don't bother with. 
---
Are u using tome of fire by any chance? 
---
Stay away from me
---
What
---
It should remember your current spell, regardless of what you're switching to. As long as you haven't changed your spellbook or run out of runes, then it should remain on the same spell. If you can provide us with a video? Always helps.
---
Is botting at mlm even worthwhile? It’s pretty bad profit until 85 mining, which takes awhile. I would think most bots would be banned before they reach that point.
---
What are your stats?
---
Wrong game perhaps?
---
Been listening to them since their first album. Heard them playing on the radio in a Qdoba (fast food mexican restaurant) when I was in college
---
Thanks 😁
---
What he said ^
---
You look at that and tell there is a god 
---
the seed was 10-20k before zulrah and ge. i agree that theres too many calquat seeds coming into the game, but farming contracts are already OP so changing them out for something else would make them even better which isnt needed. It could also end up killing the price of some other seed the same way calquats have, id rather have a terribly balanced supply of 1 seed than all of them.
---
Happy hunting!
---
Smh. Believe what you want dude. 
---
Is that a fucking hunter potion?
---
Back when you'd play the game on Internet Explorer. Ohh, the memories
---
What weapon was on?
---
They made an update where it remembers your combat style based on weapon.
---
Maybe your weaponless is on defensive?
---
If not it could be the run energy glitching out.
---
They're experiencing astronomical price changes
---
Petition to just right click you lazy fuck.
---
Been wanting to go for high level RC soon and was considering Astral Runes since my friend made hundreds of millions of GP with them going to 99, but can someone tell me why they dropped and are fluctuating so much lately?
---
Here's something important about how item recoloring works in OSRS, which I rarely see brought up whenever this type of suggestion comes up. For all of its spaghetti, a neat thing that the game engine *is* capable of is borrowing pre-existing models for use in new items and applying new colors to them. A lot of early basic items such smithable equipment hinge on this to allow for there to be many tiers or versions of it with minimal effort.
---
It's just about the same as how 2d games can swap a sprite's palette without incurring an entirely new sprite, and it allows for this idea to be way more feasible than you'd think, especially because no time would have to be spent devising the new colors for config purposes; that work is already done in the god-trimmed armours.
---
As for the coding side, I'd like to believe that all ornament kits use similar, modern, flexible, re-usable code that would be easy to apply to these. The only big concern left after that would be QA making sure that the devs didn't make any mishaps where, say, one specific trimmed steel longsword reverts into a runite one...
---
Tfw you clicked the left button
---
Try level 5 in all BA roles
---
Sick idea
---
Maybe ur mage level was drained below the level u need to cast
---
he forgot to turn off ava accu propably

That's not true

I always have Little River Band playing
---
I appreciate it thanks.
---
I'm sure I'll rebuild some portals later on 
---
i'm so glad you explained this
---
Just a suggestion m8 don’t take it personally
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
I respect their grind, especially if it’s their best source of income. They also help keep the price of dragon bones down due to the huge supply. Still against TOS tho, so ban away Jagex
---
The winterthot
---
I'm a mad lad, arrest me.

You're also a dragon.

The 120k a year they waste on Deadman is like 2 CS employees at least. Idk much about financials.
---
#FIRMLY GRASP IT
---
Can this guy get a mute? That word is in no way okay.
---
Happy Birthday! 🥳
---
But that's true, no? For a large majority of the players, the experience is literally just click and wait.
---
Dude this is, our 4th post with this topic in less than a day...
---
Stop spamming please. 
---
Puff was censored too. I never would have known that it was a slur otherwise, thanks Jagex
---
I kinda wish more people had aid on. Every now and then when I'm doing some bankstanding skill with lunars on at GE I try to sneakily cure peoples' poison when I see someone run up with a poison hitsplat, but I've never found anybody with their aid turned on :(
---
rocket league keys lmfao
---
You won't get much better than 750k/hr with low/med requirements.
---
I think opening eclectic implings is 1m+ but only because of ranger boots, so it requires a large bankroll and experience to be fast.
---
Agro a spider and let it stand north of you and you never get hit
---
Yes sir
---
\&gt;brain stems
---
Uhhh I 3 hit hellhounds on task and prot fc/bgs/slayer helm? Common sense. 
---
I feel like raging jagex is what players do now no matter if they fixed something or not. I just ignore the shit I’m happy with the game 
---
Imagine golden trimmed hilt as clue reward 😍
---
? What like 4k an hour compared to the 120k~ at herbi
---
Not yet. I'm low slayer. Cerberus also isn't in the wilderness
---
Ye but they think thats literally the entire game
---
Yep, I got it a few days ago from there.
---
Still no Sceptre btw &gt;_&gt;
---
you dont spend a whole hour on 1 run. 1 run takes only 90 seconds. its over 200k/hr for the time spent actually training it. 
---
Or people marrying their sisters
---
Rip alright we’ll thanks. Will be soon enough hopefully!
---
you thirsty fucks lmfao.  i hope you all get lured by this 40 y/o dude. 
---
That spike was when the nexus came out and people had to buy like 10k of them I think? 
---
Wilderness slayer. Farming points. 
---
Smithed FTW, ez clap
---
This community shits on jagex. They brought us back the game we love, they interact with us in a way we've never seen, they're transparent with us in a way we've never seen, they poll and add so much content we want like we've never seen, they implement it well, and they update it to our liking. The community has put Jagex between a rock and a hard place for plenty more than a decade. I'm so glad they do all this.
---
Smited FTW, ez clap
---
Damn bro quality thread, sad it didn’t get the traction it deserves. I would attribute it to the wall of text you should see if you can get someone to do some graphics to go along with this 
---
It’s true by a slim margin if the monster has 0/1 defense bonus.. anything higher and it shifts towards d long
---
Haha yeah...it gets way to hot even when I’m only running runelite it’s nuts! Well thanks tho man I appreciate it
---
Have you heard of slayermusiq? He’s the alpha quest guide maker
---
They should add another patch that isn't located close to conventional teleports, just like the current patch. 
---
You're probably right, but I wanted to put my idea out there anyway.
---
Do you reckon every time you do a bird house run your gonna get one nest??
---
Well they say Deadman is for marketing but anyone who joins the game for Deadman mode is just going to hate the game because it's only good for clans.
---
If that 120k really needs to go towards marketing they should use those competitive Castle Wars guys or a different method entirely.
---
I personally think they should dump it into CS because while marketing may get people to try this game, it's so niche that there's nothing that they can really do to convince new players to stay.
---
From all of Discord or a particular server?
---
Integrity issue
---
No it's trash but I'll buy it off you for 20k and an emerald
---
They roasted my friend when he went there last time, I died laughing. They were like "Oh, I see you have $3 in your chequing account, would you like to open a saving account?". That shit was rude and hilarious as fuck.
---
Oh shit yeah, my bad haha
---
Damn. Buss Down that Thottianna bouncing on her boys dick.
---
I considered this but it's hard clues that offer altered rune equipment. Mediums for mith/addy. Easys for bronze/iron/steel. Rather than buck the trend I felt that having something you could equip on all weapon types was suitable for a beginner reward...but perhaps this was too ambitious.
---
GE tax when
---
he progressed a main account up to farming zulrah a few years ago and quit the game.
---
When I get there I'll remember this comment and give it a shot 
---
OP can proceed to cut the emerald with a chisel to make it even more valuable!
---
Too soon.
---
Meh, then they would be easily viewable through streams/screenshots, which means they're also easily manipulated by faking the screen shot
---
I think it’s underground only more so than caveman. 
---
2 invs and abyss you get like one extra run for hour xd
---
Oh I didn't know that, the way he spoke on stream sounded like he never really played before.
---
In the Wildy doing a clue I saw there were a bunch of pures and zerks looking for fights at one particular location, so I geared up and went there looking for fights. I'm 105 cb, but my account isn't a pk build, and not a single one of them wanted to fight me and they flamed me for not skulling (I would've been risking 8m if I skullled). I was a bit disappointed as I only had around 10-15 combat levels on them but basically no pk experience. Is there a reason why they didn't want a fight? None of them seemed like they were risking much
---
Why ask if it’s good? You literally see it’s worth 40m 
---
&gt; Also a cunt to anyone playing the same spec as him
---
thats just a feature of a ton of wow players. especially mages.
---
I don't get more than 1 nest usually, 2 if I'm lucky
---
Probably not just yet, unless you really grind, or do wilderness slayer for emblems. But you're super close to making good money from it. Wyverns at 72 and gargoyles at 75 are both great for money.
---
Wb, you made the right choice :D
---
I've played since 2003. I agree though that the game would probably be dead without it as well. 
---
Poor ignorant atheists... he'll be in for a surprise when he fights his first demon!
---
It was back when it was released, i used to play it regular and had all the outfits. Never had trouble getting a game.
---
Never in osrs though.
---
I agree that would be the best solution, assuming it's possible.
---
Volcanic mine with some friends is good fun
---
Paying them monthly/weekly so they don't kill you? Lots of trust in pvp clans.
---
thats what he was saying when he made the account.
---
I've been wanting to get into it because I've been told it's the best non-combat money making method in the game. It would give me a ton of money to burn on runes or train "expensive" skills like construction and prayer. My favorite skill is magic in case you couldn't guess by my skill levels. I don't feel I've ever really gone out of my way to "train" magic to get all the way up to 78. I also have desert treasure completed despite not even having the requirements to start Hero's Quest or do most of the diaries.
---
That's a full on buff for every meta training method
---
Knew about it but I rarely use it since it's only used in circumstantial matters, such as the inferno, Olm and some other places. 
---
I've seen his stream twice and to be honest he is a d**k to the learners. Not sure why people raid with him.
---
Well they hold all 1750 total worlds, if they kill me for 200k risk then they dont get my 'subscription fee" 
---
I can pay for the week and sit skulled for hours grinding revs and watching tv.
---
Without clan i have to tele every few minutes getting rushed by pkers

---
By not paying attention
---
I haven't tried but I might give it a go. Personally I just hate doing the more efficient methods which are all mine/drop, doing MLM is actually pretty chill
---
Except natures weren't on the Konar drop table either. Are you really gonna tell me that Astral runes dropped 80gp in price because elemental runes had a 1/400 chance to drop 5,000 at a time for 3 days? Every other response in this thread if valid but this one. Stop believing all of the Reddit drama you read here.

Wouldn't say he's a dick; just that he's firm about trying to teach people to do things correctly and when someone fucks up or does something wrong, then it screws everyone over for the raid.

Summoning is a no because that would ruin the game, but I feel rigor and augury already are way too strong of prayers and already feel like curses lol.
---
What I meant is that I want the HD graphics feel, I want dung even if it doesn’t bring chaotics but some other reward, is like QBD even though that’s like 2012, and stuff like that.

That's not PvM anymore though. It's a hybrid between PvM and PvP. That constant fear has nothing to do with the NPCs, that's the PvP aspect you're enjoying.

So I just downloaded Runelite. Do I have to switch my attack style when I log into it for the first time? Because I didn't and I just gained an attack level even though the last time I played I was on "Aggressive." I gotta trash my character now...Sigh.

It's actually funny you say that because it took me about 10 years but I eventually did get 99 RC. I almost maxed (Invention came out too late to do it all in one tick) on march 18th 2017, which was my goal since 2009 lol.

Yeah blowpipe slayer is expensive. Melee most tasks while you're poor

On my main back in 07 I got a perm mute because someone baited me into saying YouTube lmfao. Was muted for 2 years when I decided to message Jagex when you could actually send them direct messages on the website and they lifted my perm mute. These guys are great 
---
You’re a lovely chap, can we be friends?
---
why do you torment me like this
---
Amazing eggs would love to know what you fried them in. No flip I'm guessing too? 
---
Exactly.. They are infinity robes with a cosmetic upgrade which isn't a bad one at that, but they remain infinity robes. This is not infinity robes in the slightest 
---
Lmao
---
Taverly wouldn't count either as that's a ladder only access, but it definitely has caves.

You know what to do boys, report the shit out of this post.

My alarms have been sea shanty 2 and scape main for a while now... Great way to wake up
---
Twow
---
&gt; I do stream as well so extra cpu power
---
Oh yeah, then it's def not going to waste.
---
And yeah, I totally agree that upgrading if you're on a 1080 alredy is kinda useless unless you absolutely want to play on 4k resolution.
---
-
---
Kinda sad about the meh leap of power/performance we got from the last GPUs. Only 2080ti is basically superstrong, where as before the 980ti was basically a 1070 (meaning 1080 and 1080ti was really strong upgrades).
---
Although, from what I've understood these new cards have basically allowed us good performing and fast cards at cheaper prices (1660ti basically being a 1070 -2gb vram but at like -$150 less price than the 1070 was).

The kits don't apply to the boots (or gloves), I just put those on the light one for display purposes.

He can spawn randomly if someone is doing the desert treasure quest, and has one of the diamonds in their inventory.

I used to think country was spelled cuntry and was so confused why it came out as ****ry or whatever. I ended up asking my mom what cunt meant lmao.

If you're reported for macros and you're *not* botting, then you have nothing to worry about
---
You're getting downvoted for poor word choice but you're right to some extent. I watched his stream a couple times and he was almost terribly obnoxious.
---
Like, we get it man, you're a """teacher""". But don't treat your co-raiders like they are garbage, some dude fucked up on his first ever raid and Chymistry went on a full-blown shame and blame only to wrap it up with "I'm not scolding you, I just want you to do it right." The fuck bro, it's just  a game - chill the fuck out - dude just wanted to learn raids, not beat time records.
---
That was only one of many, I also recall him reprimanding his VIEWER (not even raiding with him) for asking a "stupid" question. I can't recall what the question was but it was legitimate. I believe Chymistry's answer was something among the lines of "Don't do that because I don't do that".
---
I've been wanting to bring it up for awhile how awful it is to watch because of how sweaty he is.
---
This was a change by jagex, not runelite. 
---
Ahh, ok
---
no it's not lol
---
Not sure what is worse - people not getting its a joke or the actual joke
---
Well, thank you all for the help, guys!
---
Augury compared to mystic might is still a pretty decent leap, and rigor is OP dude, there’s a reason why even though it’s the most common drop from CoX it’s one of the most expensive ones. I’ll be honest, part of me wants curses because I never got them pre-eoc lol.
---
See that’s what was wrong with the game. Curses + summ + OP weps made it easy to do that camp for 6 hours. I trust that if they released summoning again that they could maybe make it not as disgustingly game breaking. I also think armor like torva could be used in OSRS because torva was tank armor, and torva could be a better version of justicar that costs more. Again, my opinion is pretty much based off of what I want/missed out on pre-eoc and not at all what’s good for the game.
---
Again? Because I was aware of the change a little while back. Did it happen again?
---

Pkers are honestly the autism of osrs

Sounds like a fucking retard. 
---
Very proud of u , i also made the step 2months ago :)
---
My excuse for this was that I loved mining when I played Runescape when I kid back in the day, so young me would be very very happy to see this.
---
All i needed to know, ty for account kiddo
---
not a second time, but it was changed for every weapon.
---
On it.
---
Interesting... I know discord will show what music you're listening to, but discord also shows you what you're doing in game too
---
Funnily enough, Jagex's monetary support is the only type of support you can get reliably.
---
RATs don't end up on your computer by magic, you shouldn't worry about it

If it's helps, you're actually continually growing until somewhere in your mid-20s when the rate which your cells get replaced slows, and falls under the rate at which they're destroyed. That's when you begin dying.

This is so simple and small yet so satisfying and creative. Kudos to you, good sir. I hope your idea is seriously taken.

he will spawn when some1 is running around with a dt slayer gem and will just follow randoms looking for the gem lingers around for like 20-30 mins

---
K I guess I'll go on the forums and see if I can get a manual reset I suppose. Thanks for the info.
---
Nice
---
then don't play 5 accounts
---
Thanks for posting my video man, i need to be faster next time lol 
---
I absolutely think it's worth it. Even if it might be expensive, the money you'll make once you get around 75 and higher slayer will help make it back. As for slayer points, it really does vary from person to person. I'd make the number 1 priority skips and blocks simply because you want slayer to be fun, and if you force yourself to do tasks you don't want to then you'll end up burning out. After that, some say you should go for slayer rings since they're convenient, but I'd say fuck the rings there's other teleports and go for ones that make tasks less tedious instead. For example, auto smashing of gargoyles. Then I'd say extensions on good tasks like specters/wyverns/gargoyles, or a slayer helm. Then of course the bigger and badder (superior slayer monsters) unlock. As I said though, this is all variable and can be switched around without much harm. It all comes down to if you personally want the unlock or not.
---
Considering people who choose to downvote with the herd mentality without any contention, thats why they're stupid.  I'm open for disagreement, but silent disagreement is absurd.  I've got the stats and haven't needed to crash anyone to back my statements, people downvoting me probably don't even do crabs lol.
---
looking at the npc id really like to have sleeveless plate bodies
---
And the fucking runecrafting bots too. Fuck them
---
Personally I struggle to see the issue with a clue tier directed at f2p players to appeal more to f2p players then members
---
If anything, a better argument is that rune cosmetics are *too big* a reward for beginner clues, since other rune cosmetics we already have currently come from hard clues
---
Yea, I’m not sure if all games work like that, I just know RS does from listening to the artists speak of it. 
---
And I agree with that, seeing as it should just be recolors, it’s far simpler than entirely new meshes with new textures. Or at least I assume, that’s where my understanding of the systems the Jmof artists use falls off.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Way too far 
---
For what reason are you constantly worried that a rat would infect your pc? 
---
Let's say, hypothetically, that a rat does infect your PC. Why would it want your RuneScape account details of all things, surely there is much more sensitive, useful information it could have access to?
---
Unless you've downloaded a fake runelite client, or a bot client, or some sort of sketchy third party program, there is a severely low probability that a common virus would be after your RuneScape details.
---
Be wary of emails sent to you, be careful of what runelite client you're downloading, change your email password every year and honestly, your rs account should be relatively safe.
---
You clearly know more than I do so your guess is better than mine!
---
That’s a yikes from me. You could have made a crusade joke instead or something.
---
Then has probably there for someone else. 
---
Well its a pvm clan technically, the only time pvp occurs is when a "rogue" enters the cave.
---
And tbh i dont mind paying 10m to make 70m or 3m to make 10m haha its all good fun and great profit in GAME
---
devalues my frontal lobe only man\*

For everything else, there's RuneLite.

point out the errors in my sentences.

Just keep spamming "???" and one day you might figure it out.

Dragon fruit was real before RuneScape my dude

Cool ill check it out. Do you have a link to it?

just use arrow keys to scan through those parts, skips 5 seconds at a time.
---
Mostly Motherlode mine. I did Iron ore occasionally to compare exp rates, with Iron ore and banking in the mining guild giving up to 54k exp a hour while Motherlode mine peaked around 52k exp a hour with it being more profitable at around 250k gp per hour. 
---
I spent the last week or so doing nonstop Motherlode mining from level 96/97 to 99 which is just about 3 million exp.
---
*gets told their doing something wrong* "man this guy is a dick!"

Ironman cc

King Fire Giant and a Queen Ice Giant.  A little backstory could be that the two are at war and maybe spark a quest regarding them with them where the wise old man has been frozen and you need to get an eternal flame from the King Fire Giant and the Frost Gen from the Queen to unfreeze the wise old man.
---
Make you slaughter the two of them to restore order.  Later you find out they are being revived and restored to their full power by zammy who intends to start a new war, a new God wars.
---
Whenever you kill ice or fire giants from them on you can get the ice crystal or the flame shard to then use on an frozen and infernal door to fight them again where they are stronger than in the quest because of zammy. 
---
Could use this to bridge an opening to a quest surrounding God wars and an expansion of it.
---
Why not just keep the clue and grind the requirements? It’s supposed to motivate you lol
---
Your account being recovered is probably the most valid concern here, however, the "hacker" would still need access to your linked email account in order to recover your account. Making your Linked email as secure as possible is the true key to making your account secure.

Shut up you watermelon headass

I don't think anyone will answer your first question indepth other than redirect you to the wiki:https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Chaos_druid.
---
As for the second question, profanity is fine as long as it's not racist. You can call someone a cunt or a retard all day long but as long as you're not following someone for 15 minutes doing it, then you won't get banned p much

You've just ruined my wife's mornings. Thank you.

I've literally never heard of "what are you up to" posts

Grats from Mr Mammals twitch chat

It would help skillers, Pures, Ironmen, Area Locked ironmen.. all people that enjoy clues be able to do them that are also limiting themselves I suppose

&gt;It's a attempt on a log-in skulltrick. He attacks you, starts to fumble an escape until he's on a spot where he can log-out/log-in on a different account with a similar setup.

&gt;&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;He or someone like him tried to same while i was doing fire giants yesterday. Either don't chase or bring something to kill them quickly.
---
&gt;I got baited and got skulled for black mask archers ring and blowpipe and suddenly his 'main' in max mage got on me. He was not able to kill me while I only had 8 sharks, 2 ppots and was in black hides. 
---
I got attacked by 8 people while I was doing a slayer task at rogues last night, I escaped with 6 of my 8 brews. Love multi pking teams
---
Tanks usually go 50 (98/99str), 60(88str), or 75(73/75str) attack. I don't think 70/78 is correct for any build.
---
If you're going with 74 prayer, you can be 75 atk and up to 73 str and remain at 106 combat. 75 attack allows you to use Godswords (master clue req), Staff of the Dead, and Arclight. This has obvious PvM and PvP benefits.
---
If you're going with 77 prayer, you can be 75 atk and up to 75 str and max out at 107 combat. This will allow you to use every prayer and equip every item except for Ferocious Gloves. Compared to the above build, this unlocks Elder Maul/Augury, and Prims.
---
Having problems myself, except mine just doesn't launch when i try to open it
---
Doesn't sound too bad, would be interesting to see how much the RL Plugin helps for accumulating books.
---
the r/runescapegonewild was better tbh
---
They're splashing (a way to train magic). I think it sucks that they can do it literally in the game's first spawn because it's confusing for new players
---
You hate RS3 because you’re playing it like it’s supposed to be old school. They are entirely different games with extremely different play styles. 
---
I love both games. But that’s because I play them differently because they ARE different. 
---
I definitely would come back but I’ve been pretty inactive with my account for over a year now. I just actually recently started playing again so I probably don’t have the requirements, but I’ll go check out the fortis forum posts. Thanks for the info man.
---
because retardation and social pressure
---
Shit meme.
---
It's a very afk way to train magic, and it doesn't do damage because they're wearing items with enough negative magic attack that they always miss.
---
You wouldn't happen to be HankTehTank from WoW, are you? 
---
&gt;Typical pker lol, nice to see the pvmer get some justice. 
---
I've been doing a ton of wildy slayer recently and anti pking is so much fun, so many easy kills from people who think pvmers are useless
---
r/woooosh
---
someone deleted their comment so I'm gonna hijack this and say he sounds like he's forcing himself to stream when he does it. Not knocking the hustle but even though I'm not one to watch people stream, I wouldn't watch a guy who 80% of the time sounds tilted from having to interact with the OSRS community. Just be a regular dude with a job who happens to play runescape
---
Poll results aren't hidden when voting so it's more likely to influence how other people vote. People want Jagex to hide the results when voting is commencing people's vote won't be influenced by what's already been voted so far.
---
Jagex's counter argument is that it will probably make content less likely to pass in the future
---
Are you?
---
no they wouldn't. you don't need access to the linked email in order to recover the account, all you need to know is the email (not the password to the email). that's how Ice poseidon's account was recovered, and many more. 
---
that clown cannons moss giants i don't think he has any concept of what gp is
---
Nvm. I was able to figure it out. Thanks for your help and sorry for the hassle.
---
Nah bro I'm having a good time hby?
---
So in theory you could wind up with a trail that only has one clue and then you find the loot?
---
Epic fail!!!

Where is this room?

They should keep this in mind for the sequel to Forgettable Tale of a Drunken Dwarf
---
Welcome to the club! Gratz bro!
---
I felt bad for the viewers there to learn from his Inferno runs. The streamer would made careless mistakes to fail the waves pre-triple Jads, then downplay his negligence by saying he's "not worried about it".
---
I saw some viewers offer constructive feedback for next attempt and was told off by streamer. "There's a bunch of things I could've done differently, you think I don't know that now?"
---
So if I want to watch what not to do as a streamer/player I would tune in next time. If he could specialize at failing in a entertaining/endearing way he could be relevant to me again. Otherwise when ever he fails another run this streamer would shrug off the wasted time of his along with everybody's.
---
lmao dumb fucking idea
---
you zoomers are really reaching arent ya
---
yup. very common the higher the ranks you go. 
---
Same thing happened to me you're going to have to just get it again
---
I like this, but it should only be on rune tbh

Think about how much easier that would be with a tome

If you can get 43 prayer and then knock out agility for underground pass (all in mems) you could do barrows with ibans staff. Depending on drop luck, it’ll be your best bet
---
I like the dark version, but the hood would need to go. I don't like the light version, doesn't look like a magician 
---
Is there not a tick box on the log in screen? 
---
Well and in WoW in general once you complete your goals there's not really a point in grinding or gearing further. Every major update the item levels go up by another 30 so you can have all your gear replaced in a week. Why bother trying to gear up in preparation for the next tier when that gear is immediately irrelevant?
---
There are many unofficial services (Performed mainly by clans) to "swap" gold between OSRS and RS3. Basically, trade you in one game, give you the gold in the other.
---
 Damn. And I thought I was lucky to get 2 in 300 kills.
---
It’s still possible with Remote Desktop 
---
Be careful when he sticks his head out the window on the drive home

when i raided i struggled splitting the time between the game and my relationship. they're both pretty massive commitments.

sucks that it happened like that tho.

A FEW THOUSAND spins on a fresh account lol? Do you know how unreasonable you sound?

Why, when is a middle name ever even required beyond the initial? I served in the military. Went to college. Work in a trade. Had a child. None of these life events cared at all about my middle name. Initial was used at most.

Im gonna bingewatch the everloving shit out of these when they all come out. Great show. 
---
Ah i am indeed. Thanks.
---
You are allowed to trade someone RS3 gold for OSRS gold or vice versa. But of course, it's risky and you need to find a trustworthy person to trade with.
---
I had a guy do something similar where he kept trusting be back and forth up to 10M. After I returned his money he asked me to buy him a fury and give it to him noted. If I did he’d “make me richer than I could imagine.” He logged after I declined. Should have kept his 10M and walked in hindsight

Oh shit, haven't changed my flair in forever. Not using that rsn anymore

---
I'm currently 30-50 on all stats except a few.  So pretty low lvl.   The two things in working on right now is a rune pouch ( though I'm combat 60 and get worked by everyone) and barrow gloves.    In that order.  
---
I die alot doing Slayer wildy.  When I do it takes an.hour or two just to start back. https://imgur.com/a/gwnvmE8.  This is my general setup Everytime I die.   I go to ham storeroom till I find power amulrt then use the money from selling others to get hides and bones.   
---
Can anyone tell me a more efficient way to get back to doing wildy Slayer after death.    
---
Is void better for range if I don't have the d hides using Slayer helm?
---
Whoops, I meant that 55 is better cuz ardy knights, but fruit stalls you don't have to worry about health
---
Also Kourend for me, in addition to so little having "examine" text compared to the mainland.
---
If it takes me 120 seconds to get my inv ready for bird houses, do the run, and re-bank, then it's 2 minutes for 4K exp
---
I was pretty excited, ngl
---
I was a trimmed comp with 3b+ xp, quit 3+ years ago and never looked back. Osrs rocks!
---
While I do admire ur commitment.... I know you are but what am I?
---
Damn did you spend a whole inventory on 1 kill, lmao
---
Well not until I unlocked them, but yes. Even on days I don't play I log in for my herb/tree runs
---
buy them up, when venezuela gets power again they will skyrocket
---
pretty sure he wasnt doing that inferno run seriously. homie had on a pirate bandana 
---
also if you tried to insta spec in rs2 with a gmaul, it wouldn't work. You would just end up cancelling the first spec. You couldn't double click like you could in osrs. 
---
Please don't vote for the same shit that destroyed rs3.
---
Great first 99 honestly, I wanted this cape but ended up getting 99 farming first. Congrats!
---
Plenty of people play on fixed mode, it makes the distance your mouse needs to travel smaller. Ditto for OSRS fixed mode (though I tend to prefer a small resizeable window).
---
Pretty sure you need to cancel mobile subscriptions from your mobile account, not runescape. otherwise it will automatically charge you.
---
Work an irl job, buy gold via black market sites or buy bonds from Jamflex and sell via the GE.

Does the prospector outfit actually increase your xp in the motherload mine? I used to get 61 exp from each pay dirt and it hasn't changed to the 62 (62.625) exp that I thought you would get. Is there something I am missing here or does it not show updated values?
---
The bug was hotfixed a few hours after the patch
---
Keep up the good work j1mbo!
---
Fixed mode is perfectly viable for all the content in RS3. Some top PvMers and skillers even primarily used it.
---
Ya'll need God Ash

Out of curiosity then what would your idea be to stop pking polls always failing etc

Put it back where that shit belongs

What?

Some of your points are correct. he will shit on people in wdr for not wanting to do certain rooms then be like “you should play this game how you want to, do whats fun for you”. Like ??????

Haha thanks :)

Ah yes, the old ones are the best :)

This Phillip without hair is obviously a cursed being from an alternate dimension. We must get rid of him immediately to restore balance to the universe.

Well obviously they are doing it wrong they need to hide their whole screen.

You can bot and talk, nothing stops botters from talking homie

Up to you. Toxic is more expensive because of scales, so you can either test it or just use regular.

I also realize this may make 99's harder, the opposite of an easyscape update. What do you guys think about that?

This is funnier than anything you'll ever post

Not a fan of the Light, but that Dark would be nice. The current Dark Infinity just feels like Missing Textures to me... The redesign skill keeps the same colors, but the way it uses them feels more intentional and less like they forgot to replace the texture.

Considering most of the ornament kits come from elite+ and a lot of them are less than 100k and rare, I'd say they haven't held value very well either.
---
Sure, to get your own music you only need an API key.
---
To see what other people are listening to, realistically you'll need a backend with a database which would constantly be barraged with requests as you ran through the game, requesting the current songs people were listening to.
---
This made me laugh way harder than it should have 
---
You wouldn't pay for the instance. You would have to pay for your stuff if you die in the instance. It would be just like vorkath/zulrah.

On the url adress of the highscore, there is somewhere inbetween 2 "/" that it will be written "l=x" where x is a number. Remove that and it should go back to english.

I think most players leave it up to personal preference. You just drop the fish either way you fish. The xp/hr is just really similar. I prefer the agility and strength xp bonus.

They’re using their body to hit your shins. This is why pures get hit so hard by them, they tend to have very weak shins. Where as main accounts have rock solid steel plated shins that are unaffected by sand crabs
---
The Infernal Tools tried that and it didn't work so well. Also, if you needed Dragon Tools to repair, it would kinda make the Crystal Pickaxe useless; the only reason the Infernal Pickaxe doesn't have that issue is because you can repair with Smouldering Stones. And the new tools won't make Dragon irrelevant since they are upgraded from Dragon; they just don't also sink dragon...
---
Yep has been like this for a few days idk how how fix
---
I didn't mean to imply that's why OP wants the tome, hence the last part of my comment.
---
I just wanted to mention why any ironman would want the tome so badly now, which is because it's great @ ice demon.
---
Good :) op may hate it but drunk at the  bar for st. Patricks day it seemed like the best comment ever
---
It saves time because instead of running around for individual books, you just bank the same book 10-20 times. Then when you're done collecting you just put 2 of each book in inventory and soak in rc exp.    
---
Absolute unit, gz! How much time did you spend getting the keys?
---
I agree. I think it should be risky going for the full set so it's not too common. Maybe you have to get all the marks in the wildy course in one run or something? I like the idea if being pked a few times before actually getting the full run and winning a slightly rarer graceful recolour 
---
Lmao a 126 with 124m total exp, how's that nmz and gold buying working out for you 
---
Today I learned all mains have 5 defense.
---
Is it worth though if you need to spend an hour preparing? 
---
It’s mining for DS2 for me. I literally can’t do more than 5k xp without getting bored 
---
wish it was a script 
---
Purely because of defense bonuses? Just read up on dinhs and the damage reduction effect doesn't seem to apply to pvp engagements
---
I actually did this!
---
Lf osrs gf irl
---
Just to show how stright they were back in the day.
---
back my days i made so many friends at the yew trees lol... and all of them quit rs before i did...
---
I think osrs is good on cosmetics there’s only so many updates casual players can keep up with, which eventually leads to not having a clue what’s what, which ruins the simplicity of the game for me
---
&gt;It really sounds like you just have a grudge with Twitch in general.
---
Literally the first thing that came to my head while I was reading his comment lmao.

I wonder if he got "yelled" at constantly for being braindead.

https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1105463351008813056 seems to imply attas is 5% more yield, but could be wrong. I get about 5% more for herb runs but a LOT more for seaweed runs (80 per patch). 
---
Only if ur lonely

why limit it to rune? what about low attack pures and fashionscape?

The disconnect happend 8 times all of them back to back.
---
I'm pretty sure my post here is justified.
---
Btw I have never been disconnected once on pc except for when I'm too long in 1 world.
---
From a noob, how much exp should a 126 have? Isn't 124m enough for multiple skilling 99's for cash?
---
Yeah same here jagex fucked something up
---
G.E. was still in development when this version of the game came out, so I doubt that the problem lies there. :) Not sure about F2P restrictions tho
---
Lol it’s not much buddy
---
you can go with obsidian body and legs if you can't afford bandos and aren't willing to get the torso.  
---
losing defensive bonuses isn't that big of a deal because you'll be killing things quicker, so they hit you less, and have higher xp/hour and higher gp/hour which outweighs the cost of a couple sharks because most of your time will be spent in combat not at the bank. 
---
tasks that deal too much damage you'll be praying against and tasks that don't do much damage, you'll be fine with 70 defence without barrows armour. if you find your defensive bonuses are slightly lacking, you can wear barrows legs instead of obsidian legs because they only offer +1 strength bonus, but the obsidian body is +3 so keep that if you can.  
---
the same reasoning applies to getting a torture instead of a fury. higher offensive bonuses means killing stuff faster. I'd rather train for 10 hours with a higher strength gear and have to eat a bit more food than train for 11 in tank gear to get the same XP and save a tiny bit of money, because I could make more money in that one hour saved anyway.
---
Ty you made me join today so great 
---
Yeah same here jagex fucked something up been playing mobile since release and this is so annoying 
---
Some kind of group boss could be good too! Make a f2p boss with like a 1 hour spawn timer that people can mass
---
romeo and juliet gives 5 qp and it takes 10 minutes
---
Now this is the content I'm subscribed for
---
Great suggestion. Can't wait to see f2p noobs flexin
---
This should be a chest slot item. Duh.
---
Why can't the users who opted into the plugin just broadcast the song they are playing as an overhead?
---
Still would require infrastructure that RL don't want to pay for, especially seeing as all of the dev time put in at the moment is essentially free.
---
pay dirt gives 60 xp. the full set would give 60 * 1.025 = 61.5 xp meaning you'd be alternating between 61 and 62 xp drops each time you mined pay dirt.
---
I don't get it. Who are the jmods meant to be? What about the lobster? What's the blue liquid in the pool
---
Woooosh
---
You Swampletics losers have ruined Barrows for me.
---
Where would the data for the currently listened-to song come from? Unless you put a P2P network into a 3rd party client, you need a backend which is being queried by RL.
---
This goes against every law known to man. Be careful with what you're doing
---
Okay, you're going to have to explain that one lol

Ok but look at his skills, he has many hundreds of hours to go until he's there. He could be doing Wintertodt later with better skills for better rewards.

P2P either mining guild or ardy 1 cloak and ring of dueling (800gp per ring = 100gp per tele - Im sure you can afford that).

This is an interesting question. Before I answer, first we must ask ourselves, why are we mining iron ore?

why? it makes them easier to distinguish without making them look silly

If it doesn't apply to scimitars that's going to be pretty sad.
---
It’s a double standard to say Venezuelans are the problem, when it’s paradoxically “legit” players causing the situation.
---
These players are responding to a demand driven market. If players stopped buying gold, Venezuelans would have to stop farming it and go do something else. 
---
I guess we do not know the extent to which Jagex spends resources on banning gold farmers. Maybe Jagex would have more resources for other things (customer support or better anti-cheat) if this wasn’t such a problem.
---
Dude gratz, I got to 96 on iron before switching to questing.  I'll have to finish it up soon
---
Most legit players would probably have an upwards of 200m because of the nature of the game - your exp in all skills scales up naturally. Granted the combats are typically fast to max because they're so consistently trained but you usually don't end up with the gold needed to get the prayer level to get 126 at such a low total exp unless you're incredibly lucky with drops or you buy the gold to get it, because if you got lucky with the drops there's far more useful investments skill wise to make than maxing prayer. 
---
yeah about that... u will realize in 2-3 years in what kind of mess osrs currently is in

5% might be on the high end. The most I've gotten yield wise increased from Attas is 4.23%, but the average over 120 runs is 2.26% increase.

I Smith cannonballs @ edgeville on my alt and I will typically see 3+ lvl 50-60 combat range characters with full graceful no notable stats other than the 99-120+ runecrafting per day just in the one world doing abyss runecrafting. I highly suspect they’re bots but even if they’re not the fact that they’re gold farming and selling the GP should be enough for us to get rid of these accounts.

He's impatient and it comes off as being a dick perhaps.
---
But, in his defense, it comes with what he's doing. I don't think many others would be able to conduct themselves any differently given the same role. 
---
I honestly do feel you, I was just commenting on the length of the comment itself not the content. I'm the uncommon breed of player who both likes the pvm and pvp communities and I think it's sort of a "few bad apples spoil the bunch" situation. It doesn't matter if 95% of the pvp community just does whatever in the wildy and has fun, it's more the small minority of pvp clans that exist to make the wildy unfun for the rest of OSRS. Getting pk'd isn't really the end of the world, because you understand the risks. It's more about getting completely owned by what is essentially the RS mafia for even attempting to enter a major area of content for the pvm community in genuinely unfair fights. The "just a spade" joke grew from a genuine frustration of non pvp players not just being pk'd randomly, but being targeted over and over in what is essentially griefing which ruins the player experience.
---
At least Barrows has a brainlet loot spawn. Would be nice if this had a dibber/spade spawn too. 
---
Oh my god thank you for this nostalgia trip.

I actually wish they brought this back in.

Do bones to peaches for some levels. You can also ice burst dagannoths in catacombs for some fast xp

That's a different team

It just reminds me of a more comical interpretation of the Mimic Head in Dark Souls.

So I'm torn between making it a Mimic reward or making it F2P.

Seems like you're right, I could swear that you used to be able to pull other users current playing information from their web API (granted that their account is public) , I couldn't find any way to do that from a quick Google on my phone.

So yeah highly unlikely then, as you said.

Google "Bitterkoekje dps" and use his spreadsheet to determine which setup/style is best

---
Why should they do anything?
---
Jagex only allows you to disable the authenticator after verifying your identity. They do this either through the registered email or through the manual recovery form. If you fail to identify yourself, then Jagex does their job properly by denying you to remove the authenticator.
---
You have two options:
---
1. Re-create the registered email address. 
---
2. Go through the manual recovery form.
---
Cluck 
---
You will have to recover the account if you don’t have access to your email.

Must be a bug Jagexs side then it did it today on my note 9 but only once

Tbh i hate how easy it is to get pjed by another gorilla. If they do the rock fall attack move then it should count you as in combat still. So many times ive had them at super low hp only for them to get stuck on that certain attack cycle a couple times in a row and then boom i get pjed off by another and lose track of the almost dead one you were fighting. Which it would be hard to attack him again anyways if they were still aggressive to you so even if you could focus on where he went + focus on your prayers and fighting your current it wouldn't matter. 
---
Ive been meaning to post this forever now. Please make it so that it still sees you as in combat when you're dodging the rock falls. Only if you let yourself get hit it will see you as not in combat. Which can be quite irritating. Since you only have a few seconds after a npc last hits you to still be in combat if they do the falling rock attack a couple times in a row chances are while youre dodging you'll get pjed by another gorilla.

Change the attack requirement for all Elf crystal weapons to 65 attack and pair them with 70 agility (perhaps a higher agility level could constitute a higher spec damage output). There are enough lv 70 &amp; 75 weapons and not enough med level besides leaf bladed battleaxe which really isn't even that great.
---
Note: All Crystal Weapons must be recharged with Crystal leaves which can be obtained from Crystal trees.
---

Upon use the weilder will be imune to melee attacks for 6 game cycles and the spear will damage all targets within 8 tiles surrounding the player.

Tome is super good for Irons, and honestly without it it feels like a waste of all those burnt pages. I’m 95 fming on my iron and I have 300 pages so I’d hate to imagine leaving without it.
---
same. why.
---
It’s a blackweb keyboard. I have the same one 
---
Ice demon is weak to fire magic and the tome of fire increases dmg of fire spells by 50%. A week or two ago autocasting also received a massive qol change that allows staves to remember the autocast spell upon unequipping and re-equipping them. This has made fire spells a more viable option to kill ice demon with. Afaik you can 3 shot it with fire surge.
---
Around 100m, nothing crazy :D
---
There better than mine too, but in 2 months his total is still likely low. Also i doubt he has any 99s... its all perspective. Though at his rate it wont take long
---
They should add it to poll, with a one time option to toggle.I dont wanna have the hackers toggle it off after I toggle it on
---
Its a meme, but there was just literally a week ago person on this sub who got hacked after he posted a pic of him getting a tbow and he had nothing sensored. 
---
It started as people covering their username and some people then probably covered their hp, prayer as well and then people went as far as to cover everything as a meme. 
---
Are there any plans to update the thieving skill? The loot tables are probably close to 15 years out of date as well as the skill itself being one dominisional with little reward and incentive to train aside from quest requirements, a pet, and a level 99 cape.
---
Ahh. I remembered trying to do the demon with fire surge but it was super inaccurate and it was better to just use BP, but that was last year some time. Assumed you mentioning this meant that he had a reduction in his Mage def or something.
---
But saying “too” implies the other person already answered the question “how are you”

I got bgloves, firecape is really my next big account goal. I need to do it but I have a mental block. Arrrghhhj. 
---
Why are you even trying to optimize your gear and rotation around killing only two Dag Kings when you're 90 combats?
---
Just get the diary done and kill them all while getting noted bones. That's the meta (which is what your title asks for.) If you cba to do that, then there's definitely much better things you could be doing for cash lol.
---
Oof, imagine getting on the internet and being so strong and confident. This sounds like exactly the type of response you were complaining about. Except in your head you're the mature one.

I didn't go into detail, but the new area would naturally bring with it more content. Thinking along the lines of Prifddinas and Song of the Elves. The quest just opens access to this area.

If you do trade with others selling or buying its 90% a scam also.

They missed it and assumed I was anxious from my PTSD.  Didn’t even x-ray me or anything.  A week goes by and I collapsed at home and couldn’t really move, see, or hear.  Plus I was sick, couldn’t eat, everything tasted bad even if I wasn’t eating or drinking anything.  I went back and they removed it, however they missed an abscess at the bottom of my pelvis that was about half the size of a basket ball, and it caused inflammation and some separation of the lining in my guts.  I collapsed again at the store and was rushed to the ER.  They said that both the lining seperating, and the infection from the bacteria would have killed me by morning.

Charge back on their scummy asses

:-D

I’m sorry

We pay we gay. 
---
Im not a big fan of dropping the ore if a bank chest is right next to me in the mining guild so I was banking the Iron ore which I'm using right now into Steel at Blast Furnace into Steel Dart tips atm since aiming for 99 smithing next eventually.
---
r/cutenoobs
---
It's more the hespori rewards, i have 11 hespori seeds and 30+ of the other shit? 
---
I thought it would be rare...? 
---
Halfway there as my 2nd 99
---
Slayer is only good if you do bosses, otherwise Thieving is still higher
---
Thieving is more gp/hr than RC because of Pyramid Plunder, Blast Furnace is lower gp/hr than Master Farmers I think and definitely lower than Pyramid Plunder.
---
Omg this just reminded me of the 3 addicted brothers. Loved those RSMV's so much until YouTube started removing all the audio for copyright :(
---
I meant to say: "rather have fireball than normal attack", just so there is no chance of a range attack(if using dhcb) or mage attack if using a blowpipe. 
---
For the elite void bonuses, do I need to wear both the top and bottom to get the bonus or can I wear either one piece to get half the bonus ?
---
Also does elite void provide any boost for melee? Additional boost beyond regular melee void
---
ohhh no idea it worked that way!
---
thanks for the info, will check pray armor :)
---
Going with what zxj4k3xz suggested I'll post my gear setup, for whatever it's worth. Neitz helm, pros top/bottom, wiz boots, occult, god cape (i), ibans (u), unholy book, seers ring. blessed dhide top/bottom, avas, and BP switch for ahrim. whip and ddef for tunnels.
---
You real world traded, your account got banned. It really is that simple. If you want to continue playing, your only option is to make a new account. I'll be quite honest with you, it seems pretty shitty that you would try and use your sister's death in order to get your account back. 
---
Wtf is wrong with you?
---
Just obviously he's going to scam you before you can rent the account even. Or get the name.
---
But on ur question, yes illegal. 
---
Im so lost. lol
---
Was just a feelzbad RNG joke when you get these crappy RDT items and find out they come with a 1/8k drop rate. I dont ever "expect" a drop, makes it much more enjoyable when you finally get it. Plus no certain items im targeting since I'm not an ironman of any sort. I just want to do profitable npcs for pvm and slayer tasks to make $$. It comes and goes
---
xD...
---
This must have been in 06 or 07, but I was in Fally east bank banking some iron ores, and this dude said he was selling a rune pick, I asked him how much, he said 100k.
---
I said "are you on crack?"
---
24 hr mute lol...
---
I thought it was just me, iv been afk woodcutting n if I don’t pay attention for a while it signs me out instead of just logging me out like it normally would
---
Is he rocking an ava assembler?
---
Almost, but it seems that ship has sailed...
---
I was actually 41 hp just an idiot and looked away a lil too long :( i guess i’m glad it happened kinda early rather than when I’d really be mad 😂
---
oh so its normal..
---
Well, will keep at it, but was void any good? I have a set but didnt even consider using it for some reason.
---
In what ways is it profitable? Pyramid plunder is sheer luck, ardy knights is what 100k/hr?, and desert bandits is carpol tunnel waiting to happen.
---
Only decent source I can think of are the wilderness chests which come with inherent risk.
---
&gt;You can use it for any 3-ticking
---
That's a separate plugin called "shift anti drag".
---
The other 2 are minor qol, I don't even use them.
---
Thank you. I'm not 'using' it. It's actually embarrassing to talk about it even. I was just being bluntly honest with what happened in my life. 
---
Have a good day.
---
Yea horizontal keyboard is just awful
---
This happens almost every time to me omg
---
I was mocking you, your name and your unreadable sarcastic tone with the matching xd. Nobody's going to know you're being sarcastic, the way you write is superfluous and the xd definitely doesn't help lol.
---
Can't relate, normies talking about drops are nothing but a bore m80
---
It isn't recognized as a fire spell so no damage bonus, but it also doesn't consume pages for the same reason.
---
I'm upvoting the treefiddy comment purely out of spite for you. 
---
You're missing the point here mate. I am well aware of this lol. The point is that if the demonic gorilla USES that specific attack multiple times in a row while youre dodging even if you are attacking them you can still be PJ'd off because you're not "in combat" with him anymore since he is technically not attacking you. Thus allowing another gorilla to tag you. 
---
[He actually started streaming on Twitch4 years ago, but gave up on that rather quickly.](https://www.twitch.tv/tehnoobshowlive). His [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TehNoobWorld) was suspended, and his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TehNoobWorld) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheNoobShow) have been inactive since 2016. I don't think he will be returning any time soon. 
---
I'd agree that Sailing is a better idea since it is more unique without falling as much into existing skills. But just because it is a better idea doesn't mean that Warding isn't a good idea. And while one of Warding's biggest issues is it seems too similar to existing skills, Sailing's uniqueness made it too alien to other skills which is a large reason why it failed.
---
Master Farmers is like 1m/hr, Tzhaar are like 600k/hr with near efficient XP rates, you can say Pyramid Plunder is sheer luck but it averages out to 2m/hr in the long term.
---
My point is that an ice giant queen wouldn’t really make sense if there’s already an ice queen
---
Elite void gives a prayer bonus. 
---
Fally is my first 
---
You should have put your recyclable in the milk crate or the appropriate bin, mate
---
Well congratulations, this update does just that for you!
---
People ain’t readin the username. 
---
Missing the gambling bot
---
Awesome ! love the passion.
---
Lol buy a glory 
---
Yeah same for me, think it’s if you close the game without logging out 
---
Read it like J1mmy
---
Yo your stats are pretty similar to mine I’ve never done barrows tho 😭 lmk how 
---
What's your stats?
---
Hahahahahahah
---
&gt; but if hiding poll results gets more people to vote no
---
That is incorrect, it works both ways. If something like the God D'hide defence requirement was repolled with hidden results it would likely have a lot more yes votes.
---
As for skills, they already have a really slim chance of passing because of the way people vote when it comes to them. They vote on whether or not it is the skill they want rather than on the merit of the skill itself. If you don't belive me just check the reddit when ever warding gets polled, there will be hundreds of "screw warding poll summoning" or any other skill those specific people want. When ever raids 2 was polled no one was shouting to have a menaphos raid rather than the theatre, it is just so stupid people do it for skills.
---
Settled is the Zezima of our era
---
You forgot about artisan.
---
ever try 3tick mining?
---
Eh..i figured from the title and first sentence and random bits of laughter in the post kind of pointed out i wasnt being serious at all. I guess I'll do a better job next time at typing more..sarcastic..? for people to follow along and understand its just a joke. Literally just a "fml I'm sad now" post - to me that sounds like someones being facetious. 
---
I'll xd all i want. But i wont rawr. None of that shit. Ever. I'll neck before I do that. 
---
So my lifestyle of smoking, drinking, chronic stress, inflammation, depression and general oxidation from excessive physical stress won't start damaging my DNA until I'm 26? 
---
Then just run away and lure it to a section with no other gorillas (it's prob better just to get PJ'd tho, tag the last Gorilla and fight another Gorilla). There isn't any need to change the aggro mechanics because there's counterplay.
---
Used to exist pre eoc in like 2008ish
---
Pure Essence, its got a fucking gmaul

No appropriate bin pal. I would if it was available

Are you just looking for sympathy? Because anyone who is dumb enough to walk into the wilderness with their cash stack is not going to benefit from any advice this community has to offer.

Still no orange goblin mail?

This ^. I went to the wiki that says up to 75 teaks is best then move onto those mushrooms. 
---
How much are bonds ill calculate it
---
the best way is to make a f2p pure, low risk and easy to make
---
then you could turn that account into a low lvl 50 attack pure (p2p)
---
Your last sentence has literally killed me. Internal hemorrhaging. Im now undead.

They are protected by HA since the ores are made into bars and then platelegs or something, which is then high alched.

consider doing frem elite for noted dagannoth bones, and then kill the dagannoth kings

Gz! i got to wave 68 today.

Getting the oil changed in my car then afk some NMZ while playing destiny 2 woth my brother
---
This is kinda retarded.
---
Sell whip, buy welfare dag king gear, solo dag kings till 10m. Buy welfare zulrah setup. Camp zulrah for 30m. Unlock vorkath buy welfare vorkath gear camp till rich. Alternatively do raids at 100m or so.
---
Usd or gp?
---
Give your brightness level a bit of love brother
---
*programmed laughter*
---
Check again
---
Dude, that's a step too far. Last time I played before OSRS was when they removed the wilderness.
---
that is definitely on my list, thanks for the tip!
---
Anything simpler haha?
---
Haha, love it! This is amazing.
---
It would be like $900 if you bought gold from a rwt site 
---
Why would humans have a king for a certain part but other races not? You're not making any sense
---
Btw 
---
"Ice" isn't a race. You're the one with the flawed logic..
---
. 
---
Alternatively just camp zulrah forever. It's still good money, easy 3m/hr.
---
You can look up their stats thanks to RuneScape's hiscores that are already hosted.

Has there been an update to the favour system in Kourend? I could have swore I saw that favour does not need to be locked at 100% anymore as earning favour in different houses will not reduce favours in others. Can anyone point out the update is that's the case?
---
Why do you guys repost the same shit over and over
---
No, it's pretty clearly missing the horns. That's an attractor or accumulator
---
I just love how someone completely fucked up the sub's name and yet we all use that one.
---
Further suggestion, make it a train going to D.C. since that’s how your HCIM will go anyways.
---
Hope he smacks mine too

How would MY client know what you're listening to? You can't just "draw an overlay" and broadcast it to every other client without some sort of backend.
---
I did consider yes but I jist felt really burnt out and just wanted to get back to playing the game, so started doing the souls instead.
---
I'm supposed to be off today, but I'm at work. Taking frequent poop breaks for some grind
---
Yeah, I joined near the end of his stream and he was on his fourth or fifth raid full of people who were there from the beginning, so he didn't really go in-depth for the few new people who were in there. He skimped out on details for everything. I guess he was really just trying to get the experienced people better at Olm, so the bosses in the raid didn't matter too much to him. 
---
For Tekton he didn't explain the anvil or the ranged attacks at all, basically said "Pray melee and run counter clockwise, keep up or you're gonna die." Vespula wasn't too bad, we watched the video and he explained what to pray, took 20 seconds to finish the room. 
---
Ice Demon and Vanguards though were different. For Ice Demon he actually didn't give any instructions at all. Ice Demon is a simple boss now that I know what to do, but while I was in the room I had no clue what I was supposed to be doing until I asked. I didn't wanna get ahead and do something I wasn't supposed to do and mess the raid up for everyone. Vanguards he went way too quick, basically said "Melee kills range, mage kills melee, range kill mage. You guys go melee, you guys go range, you guys go mage, next rotation lets go." Barely had any time to comprehend what was going on, let alone remember where I was supposed to go or what Vanguard I was supposed to attack.
---
I don't blame him though, he'd already taught those bosses like 10 times that day, and it's not like he's getting paid for teaching us, he's counting on us to help him complete the raids so we can make GP. It's just a lot to take in in a short period of time and is definitely not the conditions you want to learn a raid in.
---
The game didn't become unrecognizable to you when eoc and the armour graphic updates hit?
---
Revs?
---
I've been doing allotments, herbs, bushes, hardwood trees and fruit trees and I was getting plenty before but then I stopped getting them after an update
---
Nah he just finished. The sigh was him being disgusted with himself.
---
For those that play multiple accounts - Is it worth it to make a second account for more $$? And any guides in starting them up?
---
Petition to align your face plez ser
---
thats the point 
---
I think he said he lives with his parents. They probably didn't want him streaming. I've also been wondering where he was because he had a really cool idea for an ironman.
---
Please enlighten me
---
what pure doesn't have 1 prayer? ^^/s
---
Light up a blunt and forget all about it. *It's all gone now*
---
I would love a quest line focusing on the events of the original God Wars.
---
RS3 did the whole apocalypse mahjarrat-line and the line where gods literally come back to us. (the latter of which I didn't like because it made the player out to be too much of an omnipotent hero) 
---
OSRS now did a line on the dragonkin (even content without quests has dots relating to them) which I love, we could somehow dig up the original God Wars and find out what happened precisely. With Seren and the elves coming up, we could do the other side with perhaps Zaros and find out what happened during the god wars.
---
Maybe after all there is a reason both Seren and Zaros are so quiet. Something we don't expect at all...

The problem is that you can get your account recovered without them having access to your email. 
---
So while extra security on your email is good to make sure it's not compromised, it doesn't help you at all if they recover your account. 
---
Sell them fpr tokkul and then buy am onyx
---
This post is déjà vu
---
You don't need access to the account email to recover an account. 
---
You can sell them for tokkul to the rune shop in Tz-Harr land. Then buy an onyx woth earned tokkul.

---
I don't think I can handle this after everything that's happened
---
Because it's more beneficial to keeping the people that give them money playing the game. 
---
Probably something you’re doing wrong 
---
i cant, your brain isnt fully developed yet so it cant accept the truth
---
Herb runs every 80 minutes for sooo much money
---
I'd say atleast 7.
---
But did they get a spade tho
---
Can he smack my ass with his third leg?
---
Get 72 slayer, safespot skeletal wyverns. It’s the easiest one for you. Afterwards when u got some money then you can do brutal black dragons at 77 slayer. 
---
This is low intensity stuff. I’ve never done barrows  because as a noob i chose the “killing ents” and slayer road. 
---
Barrows is luck based and requires a hard diary, while what i did was more consistent. + you can watch tv shows while it.
---
There are obby pures with 5, 10 or 20 attack and plenty of 30 attack f2p pures. I would make them usable on any material from bronze to rune, sure most will be used on rune, but you have the option to use them on a steel scim for your 5 attack pure too.
---
Damn that's crazy, nice one man.
---
Okay some advice then, dont rwt you wont be banned.
---
Not sure what ccnetminder was talking about, but if you have significant coin going in (~300mil) you can buy magic seeds and plant pots to make magic seedlings. Use humidify spell on pots. Wait. Turns over ~4+mil per hour.
---
Strfuck
---
There is! You can secure your account (reset password, check for any malware etc) and then start the grind of making everything back.
---
Make them usable on any weapon of any material up to rune.. So one kit for saradomin, usable on scims, swords, daggers etc
---
Came here from your newer post. I think I like this one more but I seriously love the concept and fun you’re having with these 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Godsword
---
I see, does that mean that I can't recover an account after a month without a proper computer, or can I avoid downloading osrs on my clunker?  
---
tl;dr at what point for lower level players (80 att/str/def, 82 mage, 87 range) is it worth doing Vorkath over Zulrah? I can consistently get 2 kills per trip, 15 kills per hour at Zulrah, but since I have low Construction and Agility levels I need to use Zulandra teleports and have slow resupply time, so supply cost included I net 1m gp/hr without uniques at Zulrah (since I haven't gotten anything except a Jar of Swamp...). I have about a 40m bank, and use blessed d'hide, Ahrims, ring of suffering, blowpipe and toxic trident. I think I can't get any faster kill times at this point besides leveling up and upgrading gear.
---
Would I be able to make as much money at Vorkath with these stats as at Zulrah? I believe the gp/kill is roughly the same at the two, but I assume that Vorkath has much lower supply costs. I think banking time would be roughly equivalent since my PoH sucks. If the kills per hour is roughly the same at the two with my stats, then this is what I think the comparision is:
---
Vorkath Pros:
---
\- Only have to focus on ranged leveling/gear instead of ranged + magic
---
\- Lower consumables cost and thus more gp/hr
---
\- Ava's assembler needs Vorkath's head anyway
---
Vorkath Cons:
---
\- \~40 hours to complete DS2, get void, and learn Vorkath. Could spend this time training range/magic for Zulrah and earning $ from the profit snek
---
\- Boss music doesn't even come close to Zulrah's
---
Sorry for the long post. Any help is appreciated!
---
They could be used to construct a demi-boss in the empty room on the museum with Fossil Island themed drops.
---
I mean you leveled some skills up, is it really that bad?
---
Yep, as of the 07/February/2019 game update (X marks the spot), you no longer lose favor even if you don't lock it in.
---
He said worth doing? I'm sure rs3 probably has more bosses than osrs.
---
F2P won't get this. 
---
I think he's meaning from just one birdhouse 
---
What other guy said except that warding is basically just crafting #2 and isn't a good idea.
---
Liar liar pants on fire &gt;:( there are runs where you even lose money. 
---
The seeds and herbs prices are too close because of the major supply of farm runners. 
---
Also herb runs are tedious without herb sack. 
---
This has been an issue for the last couple decades. It's not going away.
---
Maybe even 8...?
---
He’s talking bout herb runs
---
I was just betting on stupidity 🙃
---
Aw thanks, I appreciate it! Will definitely keep making more.
---
I think Surg1n's video is pretty decent and is fairly recent : [https://youtu.be/RlTagh6AYY4](https://youtu.be/RlTagh6AYY4)
---
Same with me 
---
Uhhh u dont always 3 hit them, ever heard of dps? U clearly bought ur acc, can’t wait till it’s recovered and u cry on reddit lmfao.
---
Ok I should have specified. For F2P weapons, you always discern what the item is based on blade shape and length. 
---
You FUCL{ed up son
---
What does the "jagex are powerless against a pop clan" one actually mean? Never really understood that one
