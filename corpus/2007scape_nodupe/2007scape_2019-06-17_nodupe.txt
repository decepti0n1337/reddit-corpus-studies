Please do, quests are my favorite part of the game but with memory loss problems I can‚Äôt remember a lot of them so I enjoy going to Luna for tears of guthix and recounting the story. These depictions make them very memorable and the adventure comes flooding back. I‚Äôm excited to see what you do next
---
I didn‚Äôt want to call you dumb, but holy shit. Funny that you called me a hypocrite, but called someone else out on their comparison and then made multiple really dumb ones. The fact that you think having your account hacked and using it for botting is the same thing as murdering someone and saying you are sorry is incredible. How did you think that was even close? I‚Äôm an truly baffled by how ignorant you are. It‚Äôs almost cute, in a sickening we feel bad for you way. Good luck in life, you gonna need it. I‚Äôm not gonna argue with you anymore. I really love a good debate and some wordplay, but I‚Äôm not getting it from you, so have a nice day.

---
u/pkilljonny I don‚Äôt know what will end up happening with your account, but if it doesn‚Äôt get unbanned AND you feel like playing OSRS still. Send me a DM and I‚Äôll give you whatever I can to help you out. Im pretty poor, but I will help you get started in anyway i can.

So he makes one mistake with his account security, therefore he, completely contrary to all the other accounts he lost, deserves to lose all the time he put into his Runescape account? That doesn't seem fair to me. I'm sure you would be holding that opinion if you were in his shoes, wouldn't you?

So someone steals your car and kills someone with it its neither their fault or yours but your cars?

Third image: on top of what you stated they are also for an alternative way to tie laces. It is called *Bar Lacing* and makes the shoe tighter around your feet. When Converse ruled the basketball shoe scene back in the day you would see pro players utilizing the bar lacing method.

Wait so if I download a cracked game that has nothing to do with osrs I could be hacked from it? I got cleaned last week and I'm baffled since no one knows my p/w. But I definitely have dodgy games.

I'd say the higher chance is from Twitch phishing streams and sites :p

Lol!

Law altar doesn't let you in, neither does the boat or the balloon. Even opening a casket from a clue doesn't work, you can't get weapons from it on Entrana.

I don't think they are even close to similar but that was what the person said so I called him out on his bullshit pointing out how wrong he was. I was actually the one who was pointing out how stupid his point was by saying that so you probably should be calling the other person stupid since he was the one who thought they were the same thing until I pointed it out.

Get Runeliteplus. They have a hydra plugin.

I think OP means the faint music in the background as Settled talks. Its some song from in-game.

Runeliteplus has a plugin for Hydra and it's free.

So jump into the specific member world labeled ‚ÄúBounty Hunter‚Äù make sure you get a looting bag and you have some food. Take off all armor and weapons just Incase you die, but you go into level 1 wild where everyone is, right above Edgeville. There you‚Äôll be assigned people to kill but just skip them as soon as you can and run around picking up tune or dragon daggers and the amethyst arrows. Once you have a good amount, run to the GE and sell everything. Rinse and repeat

I still use the chat window to view my 'valuable' drops so I want to keep that window open but remove the section I outlined in red so that I don't accidentally click on it while killing things. Unless I'm missing something I don't think I'm able to do that

Wait they removed mobilizing armies?? Barely play rs at all anymore but iirc you upgrade the onyx ring(if thats still good) there on rs3? How do you upgrade that stuff now?

My only experience PKing was F2P. Saw a bunch of PK videos, had no illusion that I could do anything at that level but wanted to try a couple fights and learn. I was something around combat level 30-40. Picked a fight with someone somewhat close to my level only to get made fun of the entire fight for how bad I was at PKing.
---
I stopped and haven't looked back. Why bother with that when I can have fun PvMing and skilling without dealing with toxic people? It probably wasn't my thing to begin with, but the unwelcoming community didn't help any.
---
You could farm infernal capes for 10m/hr similar to kiln with onyx now.
---
Social aspect? The only social aspect you'll ever see in the game is clan chats. There is hardly any "multiplayer" aspect of the game all the way up to end - game bossing or pvping.
---
The community doesn't like working together and most people rather have everything ultra solo efficient and not dependent on other people like unlike the classic MMORPG style of gameplay.
---
Looks nice but the tunic isn't one def 1 think thought
---
I've done over 100 scrolls combined between Hard/Elite/Master, but I always make sure to bank before going into the wildy for a step. I've never been PK'd doing any of those clues, but lord knows the SECOND I don't bank, I'm gonna get my ass PK'd. So I always make it a point to bank, no matter how irritating banking and then taking my stuff back out after the step is.

Everyone says this but I can assure you almost everyone would get shorter trips without the plugin, especially without an sgs. It's pretty easy to lose track of how many hits it's done when it does like 5 rocks in a row

Addy darts are usually ~5.8 gp/xp. Xp/hr varies based on your clicking stamina, but theoretically you could get well over 1m xp/hr if you can keep up the spam clicking.

Are you using a VPN on wifi? Dynamic nodes could cause that

Iirc the iphone login saving bug was fixed, so it shouldn't be that

Wait, so just to clarify, if I die with an imbued ring or slayer helmet outside of the wilderness will it lose imbue?

I‚Äôm confused as to why their items are on the floor

If you have a worthwile runescape account you HAVE to have 2FA on your e - mail PERIOD.

Here's an idea: You can't immediately attack someone if you just worldhopped.  Kinda ridiculous players can just go an hop every black chin spit on every world, for example, and just log in on someone and start attacking without even having to walk up.  Add a little fairness to the situation--if you want to kill people, you have to actually get to them legitimately
---
For raids
---
Permission granted.. oh wait
---
Exactly. There's the issue with gear, too. You have to take cheap, underperforming gear to fight some tough bosses. And even then, there's a good chance it's for nothing because opportunistic PKers can show up and steal your loot.

I spent 4m points on them like months ago lol

If I don't forget I'll take you, 292 kc

Nope, it's just a regular wifi. This is on Android btw

thats just the market dude... They are very heavily farmed and very easy to get through slayer. Prices change based on demand and an over saturated market lowers the overall value of the clue.

Yes, that point too. I honestly wouldnt care if the PVP went away again. I played in the RS2 days and I know the real life issues now surrounding that and the trading update but I loved being able to roam the wild without having to worry not only about losing gear but how long it might take to do anything constantly being killed for no reason.
---
IP bans are useless at best and prevent legitimate players from playing at worst.

Maybe put a really high price for insurance if u die in wilderness, like reaaaaaly high

I don't think a lot of people will actually farm there after the initial release.

This isn't a quick flip by any means, but just a few months ago the eggs were 130-140 each and I think thats where they will end up again once they are removed.

Your mentality of "his account so he's guilty" if like saying you should go to jail if I ran someone over with your car after stealing it, yeah I stole it &amp; committed the crime, but it was your car so screw you ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è see how retarded your mentality is?

Daily reminder to flair your posts so I can filter them out
---
Ah, okay.
---
You want as much magic damage boosting gear as possible (not magic accuracy, it doesn't matter). Void isn't optimal because it makes you less tanky and you sacrifice the gloves slot - better to go with a tormented bracelet since you have the bank for it, as well as occult necklace + imbued god cape and the rest tank gear. Verac's is popular to wear, would recommend the helm + plateskirt and then maybe a blessed dhide body.
---
[This is the setup I use](https://i.imgur.com/BlGW9jI.png) at Barrows, no Tormented at the moment but would highly recommend if you can afford it. I take a melee swap + salve amulet for getting KC in the tunnels and a 4-way range swap for Ahrim. If your melee is high enough, you can kill Ahrim with melee instead since 4 DDS specs can be enough to kill him or get him very close to death. If you're learning, I'd recommend bringing more food and prayer pots. Once you get good at Barrows and start doing sub-5 minute trips, you should barely ever need to eat, and you should only need to sip 1 prayer dose maybe 1/3rd of the time for when you encounter Dharok/Karil in the tunnels.
---
In terms of other weapon setups I'd recommend taking a look at [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8zaj5q/loot_from_10_hours_of_barrows_testing_4_methods/) and [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bu4xnx/testing_4_different_methods_at_barrows_75_magic/). Using a salamander to learn is fine, but your kills will be much slower and you'll be using a lot more food/prayer pots as a result. If your combat stats are in the mid-70s I'd recommend just tanking Guthan, Torag, and Verac since you'll spend too much on prayer otherwise.
---
Yep - https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/c161pw/buy_red_spider_eggs/
---
I do not think op is guilty of anything other than poor security but also the account should be banned because it has gained progress by botting and should be removed from the game
---
Sure, because listening to a bunch of teenagers yell "Get rekt noob!" when they're pk'ing as a clan when you just wanted to do your slayer task is totally worth the dev time.

Look at the 6 month graph, they are at a low point and are about to have a decrease in availablity.
---
While I get they are releasing a monster that will drop lots of them at once, I don't think as many people will be doing the dungeon as there are doing NMZ so the supply is likely to go down.

Total noob to most GWD stuff, if I'm duoing Sara then one player is supposed to do the standard solo Zilyana kill while the other player kills the minions with BP, right? Or do both players focus Zilyana immediately? If I'm attacking Zilyana and I'm not the player kiting, do I use BP or do I use a crossbow? Also, how do we ensure that Zilyana focuses the player who wants to kite as soon as she spawns?
---
I think you're currently dumping all of your red spider eggs
---
LOL nice find
---
I agree with you 100% on the wow half of the equation.  Being ganked by a capped character isn‚Äôt PvP. But in OSRS you never know when someone forgot to bank a cash stack or brought every law rune they own with them. So I feel PKing is way more legit. This is coming from someone who has never PKed a day in their life. But different strokes for different folks.
---
Google "bitterkoekje dps calc" and see for yourself

I‚Äôm sure you can find main matches . But if I were you I‚Äôd just make a 0 def. pure of some sort.  Whenever you are around 35 CL you can get engaging matches for practice . But of course it‚Äôll take some time to get rewarding kills. 
---
With the right gear you can definitely get some kills on this account but you‚Äôll find way more matches stacked in your favor if you make a pure.

I swear iron man can be so toxic it at time. Yeah there doing a good challenge but sometimes there just ass about it

I am brand new to the game &amp; the genre for that matter.  As I'm attempting to learn some basic mechanics I stepped into an apparent melee in the southwestern section of Varrock and was killed presumably by another player virtually instantly.
---
I just want to make sure I understand this mechanic so I know what I'm getting into before sinking lots of hours into OSRS.  I read the Wiki article on player killing and I am still confused because I wasn't in wilderness, and yet I was apparently vulnerable to random PvP killing.  I can't say which server I was on, I just play whichever free server I am placed into when I fire up the app on Android.  Also, after I respawned in the starter city, I noticed melee occurring within the castle, whereas the Wiki said that fighting is disallowed within the starter city.
---
Anyway, to my questions.  Can the possibility of being killed by other players be avoided or mitigated (if so, how?), or will there be constant possibility of instant death at the hands of any player greatly outmatching me?

This is basically what they are doing to every skill any j mod comment and prove me wrong, thieving is prime example look at how many accounts have 99 thieve pre purses and it hit a certain point enough people had it that theythought it was too easy to get and they didn‚Äôt want other people doing that. The botting wasn‚Äôt fixed with the example that was on here the other day with a thieve account with crazy amounts of exp not banned until it became a huge thing in reddit

Big - and probably easy update would be implementing something similar to RuneLite‚Äôs menu entry swapper. 
---
It‚Äôs damn near impossible to click some moving targets, let alone hold press to right click. Farming payments for example.
---
What im saying is that your acc cannot possibly have different stats, its either not the right account or you misremember your stats.
---
Teletabs dont require a magic level and its very common to buy range armor sets when you plan to train range before you actually train it. 
---
If you use a third party client check your level up screenshots, youll see its just one if the above 2 issues

Pm me which server that is, he always did good work

Just started grinding barrows recently myself and I prefer to switch less so I don't melee at all I bring a mage set up with mystic top bottom and boots, barrows gloves, fire cape, nieznot helm, occult neck, seers ring, trident of seas and book of darkness and then a range switch that is just blessed dhide top bottom and boots, blow pipe and a fury. With this set up I get sub 5 min runs rarely use any food and only use one dose of prayer pot if I get dharok karil or ahrim in the tunnels otherwise I don't even use a dose. Alot of people suggest full graceful and I tried this but I used more food and even without graceful i don't ever run out of energy in a run but that may be just because of my high agility

It's misleading to say that every medium clue is 160k worth of loot. Rares are not average, that's why they're worth so much.

It's Runelite. it's free to use and it has tools. The logo you see above it's prayer is its next possible attack style, just to help you prayer flick easier.

yesterday i was doing earth warriors for a slayer assignment (im 60 combat) and got ganked by 4 mage pures world-hopping that one shotted me.

so yeah that was fun

Level your slayer once you get 70ish money will really start to flow in.

FYI Make sure you get it from [the official site](https://runelite.net/).  Been a lot of phishing attempts using various other sites.

Yeah the hiscores already separates, but the most influential (&amp; difficult) factor would be trend/frequency over time. Would be interesting to know. Maybe someone tweet a mod?

Fair point!

I've done F2P pking exclusively for years, it's great. Back in the way early days of OSRS (August 2013 to be exact), I tried out members pking for the first time as a range pure and quickly found out it was a fucking money pit. I couldn't make any money at all because of how expensive supplies were. Oddly enough, this was the first time I got banned from Runescape because I would go kill green drags for quick money. Guess the game thought I was a bot? 
---
I made a F2P strength pure and I PK on it pretty frequently. My real passion in F2P pking isn't with 1 def pures, but with either mains or rune pures. I have prowled around edgeville and gone on deep wild trips but have come up empty. The few people I do see in full rune are way too fucking picky about the fights, stupid shit like no arm or wanting a big risk involved. It's like buddy, it's full fucking rune, the shit costs 130k max. If you want to stake then head over to the sand casino.
---
The arrow is on the wrong side of the bow.
---
That makes no sense. Each medium clue us a chance of awarding ranger boots and this chance is already known to be around 1/250. So you can compute the average medium clue to contain a 1/250 chance of awarding this item. That‚Äôs how an average works. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs ultra rare by your subjective definition, it‚Äôs still something that you can expect in the long run with a sizable sample
---
Shut
---
Easier maybe, but not long term sustainable. Selling scripts or taking a cut of premium scripts is nice and easy, BUT doesn‚Äôt come with retirement, 401K, benefits, or job security. The bot nuke COULD have ended it all completely. What if there wasn‚Äôt a fix to it? Then his income stream is completely gone. Whereas going to work for Jagex provides a career and something that can be on a resume
---
Can you elaborate? I work in radio frequency and come across and use them often.
---
Cheers!!
---
Wish they would ban ‚ÄúI got hacked‚Äù posts, so sick of seeing it all. People worrying about their fucking runescape account getting compromised when they should be worrying about more important shit that got compromised from someone getting into their email account. They are lucky it‚Äôs only their runescape account and not their bank account etc
---
Jagex should either make their own jmod-run subreddit purely for support queries, or improve their official site support infrastructure, either way they should stop answering support requests on the sub. I could quite honestly give a fuck if little timmy got banned for macroing or that suzy got phished and now she's frantically trying to get her account locked so the hacker doesn't make off with her bank.
---
This would A. preserve the integrity of the subreddit's content and ensure that the discussion is focused entirely on the shitposts we know and love and B. likely be much more efficient overall if Jagex's aim is to run their customer support through reddit (or improve their customer support in general, depending on what route they take)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
tl;dr ban account support related posts pls
---
this better be exactly what group-ironman construction looks like
---
Because then the market would crash and bots would still do it, because even at 5k/ore its still not terrible gp for a bot farm. Wait a minute. I have no idea why OP thinks this would help. 4head ha.
---
Bout to catch them Handos.
---
Well since you have a hard time telling varrock east from west while alreadt having played enough to have a 400 mil bank, i don't think anyone here expected you to be too bright.
---
&gt; temporary
---
They've existed for longer than they haven't, in the OSRS timeline.
---
Well unless you wanted to sell the bonds then idk.
---
Would it make sense to use a BP if zilyana isn‚Äôt focusing you, and then switch to a cbow if it‚Äôs your turn to kite?
---
so it would seem
---
Nah too much profit loss and honestly it only saves you like 1500 logs. Sooo

dude lmao

they can't

speed dialogue, yes

seen u at zulrah a few times lol

No, you just safespot the trolls

Yea wanted to sell em on osrs

No
---
Was buying them to sell em on the GE
---
I had a team of 6 log in on me at magic axes one while I had monk robes and a d scim on
---
nice
---
Ah you might be screwed then idk. How many did you buy?

thats a good idea, but i would rather knife myself in the dick than do kree off task

No. Your levels are still low, it doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Two weeks* but rest is correct
---
At this point im convinced that the vast majority of people who get their accounts hacked are either ridiculously and uncommonly stupid, or 10 years old. How hard is it to put on 2FA on your RS account and your gmail and not give anyone your password?
---
&gt; Need I remind you that player recovery questions are stored in plain text
---
Source?
---
Make this a hat pin plz
---
Yeah, I'm fairly sure it's meant as a compliment on the subtlety of the fact that it's RuneScape.
---
It takes more time to kill a single gorillas than it does to bank, reset your stats, and teleport back to the cavern, since the seed pod teleports you so close. How long the trips are really isn't as much of a factor for them as it is for other money makers.
---
Phishing is bad
---
Didn't choose stab
---
OMFG every time I see one of these meme posts, I know exactly the song I‚Äôm going to hear, I know exactly what to expect from the video.
---
And it still gets me every fucking time!
---
Literally unplayable.
---
We need an update disguised as a bot deterrent to make 99 agility harder because too many people have 99 agility and we definitely shouldn‚Äôt make those accounts abusing this ez method of training restart either
---
no point getting any wand except kodai imo
---
Yeah but it involves you trading them something.      
---
They offer to pay an exorbitant price on an item, and when you put it in trade, they offer a cammy tab, and say to mean their main there and accept.    
---
If you also hit accept you just traded your BGS for a Camelot teletab.
---
ooo, man what a save.
---
If my account ever got banned for something bullshit id just quit tbh, not interested in starting the entire grind from scratch again. Gl with ur acc tho bro.
---
That did not answer the question.
---
But like... what would starting over even accomplish?  Ever...?  You'd have to get all those stats back again... Lol this question has to be trolling.
---
Sweaty loot drop
---
Thanks, just didn't know if I screwed myself from the beginning. I've never played this game so thanks.
---
Quests unlock a whole lot of content, I would start with tree gnome village for spirit trees and Ardougne easy diary for the cloak, it‚Äôs a fast teleport to that area and not too far from a spirit tree and fairy ring
---
the effort of t his post is through the roof fam
---
Bruh this really got a nibba thinking. 
---
Why the fuck have I never considered taking the first route? It‚Äôs almost like it doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
Lmao wearing nothing doesn‚Äôt mean you have nothing, there‚Äôs 0 reasons why they shouldn‚Äôt kill you. 
---
Worst case they wasted their spec/pot
---
Best case they get loot.
---
Sorry, first time playing. Just didn't know if I screwed myself from the beginning.
---
Fucking hell, father‚Äôs day memes were on point this year, we really did all collectively grow up lmao
---
But he can't use it.. so effectively didn't get it  back?
---
Not problem solving, noooo :(
---
Just to with attack to 20. Then go for 30-30-30, 40-40-40 and then 60-40-40 for dragon. Easy games :-)
---
saradomin is a bit of a cunt.  armadyl best god
---
For me, I didn‚Äôt even know what I was looking at until I saw the top comment. I‚Äôve been dying at all the memes today lol
---
The one when they‚Äôre going in circles made me laugh so hard just thinking of kids following eachother at GE for days
---
Yes they were so fun back in the day!
---
iffy uh
---
Keep just enjoying the game and doing random shit. You can never get that back once you become efficient.
---
Wasting pots , runes, or ammo for nothing . Could also be a trick to get you skulled. I know pkers don't care just silly to think it would be worth the time.
---
Try w q p
---
             w
---
i dont think anyone actually disputes that lol, doesnt mean its efficient. I see so many nmz prods with 99 melees, 70 pray and broke with random skills still at lvl 1 and slayer ~70
---
he is currently having a breakdown on stream
---
I don't wanna get political or anything... but what's a support?
---
How does the game track queen kills? Your cape gamble can work the same way even without showing you the number of gamblers you have left.
---
You'll need 75 rc for that
---
I've seen him broken as well when I was doing thieving lol.
---
I said iron man have to go into wildy , everyone else can ge the items
---
Who cares?
---
People on this subreddit are so retarded - In my opinion, this post was alright, this guy didn't find it funny and commented as such. 62 downvotes? Are you people some sort of spergs? I see this all the time. 
---
Downvotes ARE NOT an "i disagree" button. To foster productivr discussion unpopular viewpoints have to stay visible, an unpopular voices should get to post.
---
This case in question is irrelevant to the point i'm making since there's not much to discuss here, but i see this ALL the time. This mob mentality that just rapidly downvotes everything so it gets buried six feet under.
---
Guys - Reddit is an echo chamber , this sub even more so. But you can stop that, you have to stop that. To make a community healthy and make it produce quality discussion you have to stop downvoting everything you disagree with. Downvoting should be used when the content or comment is directly detrimental, harmful, or offensive for the context or topic at hand.
---
Thanks for reading the rant. Now stop this because it's making me want quit coming to this place forever and i kind of like some of the stuff in this sub.

Eh

You telling me people are just going to ignore the new boss that is doable by most everyone and go do nmz. Your a special kind of stupid huh
---
Definitely. Dins bulwark is considered OP in pvp
---
You know you can just.....wear the Neit helm right? Literally nobody can make that choice for you...
---
What shield is 71 gp lol
---
yeah barrows is on my list, working towards quest still. I do plan for 90 magic and 90 range. Is there a better way to range other then chinning beside blowpipe NMZ? thats what I am doing atm
---
Speaking of going way off topic. Listen buddy I understand you‚Äôre a professional shrink n all that good stuff but your not what I would consider smart. I asked a genuine question about what I should do with my pure next and you wanna give me a half drunk lecture about your own life not mine. Since you wanna be doctor Phil of course we all had bad relationships I simply asked about advice. Since ANY account I ask about is harrased about relationship advice I simply responded. So look to your left. Pick up your heel and gently shove it up your ass. Want my # or @ then PM and we‚Äôll see
---
Lumpridge
---
Underrated
---
There are lots of people with low rc and almost 2000 total, I don't hear people say they are noobs. I have multiple 90 plus skills and farming is only skill below 70, but maybe I'm noob then when I enjoy playing this game and skipping one skill I don't like
---
&gt;how hard it can be to even find viable PK targets?
---
I hop on the wildy PK worlds and PVP worlds and all the standard areas are poppin. BH will give you a target if you're having trouble finding one. It's only 'hard' to find a PK target if your only PK targets are clue hunters wandering the open wild on dead worlds.
---
It's entrancing is what it is :p poor guys on the outside end up sprinting when it starts rotating
---
I lost all sorts of shit a couple years ago cos I didn‚Äôt know there was a 60 minute timer. I died and thought ‚Äúwell, I can‚Äôt get back there in 2 minutes. Guess I‚Äôll start again‚Äù.
---
Yup this is what I‚Äôve been doing. Things that take effort and are fun at night and 8 hours of nmz during the day
---
Hes not
---
OJ only follows one person on twitter and that person's avatar is God ash...
---
Woah that's crazy overkill.
---
  
---
I run slayer helm, obsidian with dboots and occult and avas with rune gloves (atm working towards barrows) and I have extremely short runs and only ever even need 1 sip of prayer.
---
Then again, I have a blow pipe, so I don't need any switches for accuracy with an avas on.
---
My only switches are BP for ahrim, and whip for underground. Trident the rest of the time.
---
They don't look like it be, but it do
---
Honestly, enjoy it.
---
Idk how many times I've heard people say they wish they could go back and 'enjoy being a noob' or 'wipe their memory and replay the game'.  
---
Find a skill or city or whatever that you enjoy and play around that.
---
I remember when I was a new player I used to spend so much time in the dwarven mines lol.  Or training ranged in Barbarian Village.  It really doesn't matter, the game is for fun!  If you hop immediately to 'EfficiencyScape' it loses the adventure and exploration.
---
Find some item you want to work for, get the stats to wear/make/use it.  Work towards that.  It's the little things :).  Enjoy, my friend!
---
I don't complain so much about getting killed, but about the mentality of pkers.  I was looking some greater demons for a Slayer task, a couple guys came along, and I told them I had nothing on me.  They killed me, got monk robes and a single str pot.  I came back about 4 minutes later and they were still there, not even killing the demons.  Told them I still had nothing, they kill me again.  I hop worlds, go back, they decided to *hunt* me.  For no good reason.  They got 3 sets of monk robes and 3 str pots.  And their reason?  "Just wanted to see you cry"
---
This is why people vote no on PvP polls.  Fuck those guys.  Rev caves are solid.  Chaos Altar is fine.  There's profit to be found for PvPers and others there who are training.  But what I was doing was offering zero profit to the PvPers.  They did it over a power fantasy and nothing more.
---
Wildy is fine, the PvPers are shit.  It's a system that enables griefing for no good reason.
---
Please finish it. I must know what happens.
---
Fuckin way she goes
---
Yeah he‚Äôs much shorter
---
Kapp
---
Maybe I'm daft but I can't find it. Which topic is it under?
---
Seriously though, it‚Äôs going to be life changing
---
All of you "in 15 years never been hacked" probably don't have 50b banks. There have been scandals of Jagex staff stealing high wealth accounts and RWT their cash, and others - a high profile streamer got DDOSed on stream and had his 2b authenticator protected account hacked and cleared on stream within minutes. 
---
Not saying everyone who is crying and got hacked are one of these people, but there are powers at play here you can't protect against, so have some consideration for others as you might not have the full picture.
---
Recipe for disaster
---
Is it wrong that i'd like to see my girlfriend dressed in this?
---
btw i have a bank pin ect
---
Lmao u fucked bro
---
tbh when you're bursting the +5 magic accuracy makes very little difference because you'll usually have like 90% accuracy anyways, even in proselyte.
---
I think you care a little too much dude
---
Thanks for the second opinion.
---
I guess I will wait and see as my slayer is pretty low anyway and I can't burst yet as I still need to do DT lol.
---
This 100%. If you go to the helmet shop in the Barbarian Village, they say the scorpion WAS in the village, but they gave it as a ‚Äúpresent‚Äù to their cousin in the barbarian outpost.
---

---
jesus christ just use a fucking computer you lazy bastard
---
Runelite is safe but runelite+ has some sketchy shit just stick to the free version and you'll be fine
---
as well as 95 RC to craft the maximum water runes possible for an invetory of Ess.
---
great that their customer support is none existant
---
:crab: Auth Delay :crab:
---
Also God Ash.
---
How does someone else randomly just get on your account. Amazing how they knew the pin and the password!
---
I see a bunch of guides saying to stun alch.
---
Is there such thing is enfreble alch if i havent unlocked stun yet?
---
Off-task bursting is usually break even I think. You might wanna try nechs if you have 80 slayer, the extra spawns mean you should be getting maximum xp from each cast, and the drops are also good.
---
Me (hard)
---
You were wearing your entire bank value?
---
It has nothing to do with customer service you idiot. Jagex DOES NOT return items, unless it was due to a mistake on their part. Sorry you didn't secure your account, but that is your problem, not theirs.
---
Playing oars is better money than most jobs so they have huge gold farms to make money
---
yeah all my money is in zulrah gear
---
We tend to think left to right, so left gets done first and right is unnecessary
---
Maybe if blessed dhide chaps and vambs didn't have the 40 defence requirement we'd see a decent increase in price for 12 different items received from hard clues, but nope. ToO mEtA cHaNgInG fOr PuReS!!1!1! 
---
Then we give them +1 str legs and +4 str boots with clue reward expansion.

if Sea Shanty 2 was so good how come they didn't make a Sea Shanty 2 2

---
69 defense
---
Taverley is correct name and taverly is shit name.
---
what specifically are you fighting? your cannon uses an attack role based on your magic setup but still rolls against ranged defence, so against (for example) metal dragons you're going to have pretty crap accuracy whatever you wear
---
What are you maging? If you are maging something with a low magic level, you don‚Äôt necessarily need a massive magic attack bonus
---
3, 2, 1 GO! "sorry this requires engine work"
---
we need osrs remastered, get rid of the  spaghetti code lol
---
Lmao, chill out buddy. I didn‚Äôt comment on advice, I commented on your insecure reply to someone else. Don‚Äôt know if you understand but conversations naturally deviate, same way you went off topic to someone making a joke. I‚Äôm not the one who can‚Äôt handle a joke, you are, not only that but you went a long rant boasting about how successful you are.
---
It‚Äôs quite pathetic to be fully honest
---
r/whoosh
---
Did mm1 without thinking about chinning or bursting as i had 90 ranged and completely forgot about magic.. Cant remember if Dust Devils req magic lvl?
---
Killing someone that looks like they don't have isnt necessarily greifing, true. But hunting someone you know has no loot or ability to put up a fight just to upset them is definitely griefing.
---
Just because it's a PvP zone does not mean that griefing is impossible, or even improbable.
---
I do I really liked his content before he started falling off
---
Thanks to you I checked my email with the website and it has been compromised 7 times too.. Time to switch passwords :D
---
You sound like one of those dumbfucks who think they're in an actual gang and tell people to "sit bitch" when you PK them.
---
You need to link your RS account to a brand new Gmail you use for absolutely nothing else than rs. Secure the email with authenticator and you're set.
---
Thank you, I'll just do the clue as much as I can at work and just use alt1 on my computer before bed. Was just hoping to be able to do more than 1 clue a day lol

She's firing the bow left handed, I think this may have been rendered incorrectly-
---
If you reflect the image, shen she face the other way, it works. (As in she hold the bow with her left hand and fires with her left. When you render out from a camera in 3D if you don't uncheck some settings, it'll flip the image through the lens which can dramatically affect the outcome of images.

The simple should be twitter/reddit to imply that's the real customer support

Yeah, they still practice bridal kidnapping and child marriage in Chechnya. The place is a shithole of the highest order.
---
This is mid game tbh
---
So what is it you think happened? Did someone hack into the jagex server and steal your password? Did the hacker brute force your password? Or have you considered for a second that people don't take the time to post everytime their account WASN'T hacked, so it makes perfect sense that you only see the posts from people whining about their account being hacked, even though they have been using the same password for all their accounts for the last ten years, don't even bother to use an authenticator, and can't even take the extra 10 seconds to deposit their entire bank value in gear before they log out?
---
Hi,
---
Using this logic, theoretically, do you have a higher chance of getting a log if you keep clicking the tree constantly? i.e. does each click reset the hitting tree action so you have an instant chance to get a log?
---
Dragon dagger, clue, spade.
---
I also bring a glory to get back out
---
Is the video from that country?
---
&gt;i have a bank pin ect
---
&gt;**etc**
---
&gt;i had to deactive the 2 way authenticator
---
Fancy man with his seed pod
---
It still baffles me that people say this stuff after a J Mod hacked accounts for hundreds of bils. 
---
On top of that an ironman was recently recovered who had informed account support on twitter that sensitive information was leaked and they did nothing to help him make sure his account wasn't recovered. Information gets leaked sometimes, you can't always stop being hacked
---
I suppose that's true to an extent, but I believe if there's more people flipping the same item it will take a longer time to buy or sell which isn't ideal. You could make a mil flipping feathers, buying for 2gp and selling at 3 but it could take a month to do so if everyone has the same idea. 
---
Also there's a chance of more people undercutting your offers (where their price is a few gp sweeter than yours so their offer buys/sells first) which can slowly eat away at profit margins
---
Got mine on kill 88, same PB tho!

I like to think it's because when you climb up the ladders, the bank tellers are facing you, so it feels more natural. Opposite to when you use the Northern ladders, you are kinda entering the bank from the wrong direction.

The nostalgia you brought upon me
---
thats right, the game would lose a lot of players. but is that going to hurt runelite or osbuddy financially? the guys from runelite do it for free and osbuddy has almost no VIP users nowadays.
---
you got a point that the developers are passionate and want to see osrs succeed, i was just speaking in hypotheticals in case the financial short term gain was too irresistible.
---
They all have around the same amount in game except purple, there was a glitch back in the day for a purple dupe so its a fair bit higher from what ive heard but again no real source just what I've heard over the years so take it however you want

Day One on r/2007Scape

- Jagex has done nothing for account security, customer service, the botting issues, or any of the other flops presented by the company. We're tired of paying upwards of $11 USD to go to what seems like a non existent effort.
---
Day Two on r/2007Scape

- Jagex is the perfect company, and I'm tired of seeing people say otherwise. Their customer support is superb and you'll be hard-pressed to even find any issues in game.

I used the spellsey guides, too.
---
The ranged one is about half as good as training Melee. Haven't tried mage, though.
---
bruh quit calling anything you disagree with ‚Äòsnowflake bs‚Äô.
---
Tbh you flipping out over the smallest change to the Wildy is more like snowflake bs
---
You're not getting the point, we want to do clues and experience everything the game has to offer *except pvp*, it sucks that there's a lot of shit that makes us go to the wild and get jumped by brainlets
---
That‚Äôs my face 95% of the time when I play osrs
---
Congratulations, you have the worst comment in the thread!
---
Pretty sure they removed the option because it was used as a lure
---
Surprisingly accurate, wow
---
Fighting players bad, killing monsters good
---
Didn't disable the attract feature on Ava's probably
---
Did you expect to get a different drop from hydra? Lol
---
Very good art although it seems like her breasts are oddly a few inches lower on her body than they really should be.
---
To be fair, if he's writing bots (or even running a private server), that likely is his real job and while he makes good income from it, it's not as stable as a regular programming job.
---
I love it when I get attacked with nothing.
---
sometimes i go out with just hides and a full inventory of crappy food like tuna or wines and just tank with pray mage to make them waste as much runes as possible.
---
Is that why scythe is dropping so much?
---
now thats what i call a pid swap
---
Swampletics by Settled is currently the most hyped and memed series.
---
Easier money sure, but not more stable money. A regular programming job is definitely much more stable.
---
Well if my face's like the meme, is it then ok that i made a spelling error?
---
Don't bother with youtubers for guides just read the wiki
---
Thank you
---
He likely had one, you don‚Äôt need to baby sit bots
---
Oh I get the point, I just don't think you have a valid argument for it. There is one single area in the game you rarely have to go to for a tiny bit of content, where a death would mean about 60 seconds of inconvenience. Taking this away would be stupid and not in any way 2007scape like.
---
42 def is not a pure
---
That is weird af.
---
Amen
---
didn't you hear the man, he clearly said he'd like to roll up a few joints and watch some YouTube RuneScape content??? üòÇ
---
Lol imagine defending a company‚Äôs almost nonexistent customer support
---
PM me the name of it, I'm interested in hearing about it as I know quite a few server owners.
---
Are you using runelite to display amulet charges? What plugin please? :)
---
I mean, that's what he's saying is the problem.
---
How does the game determine if you land a hit? I assume it has something to do with the difference between your accuracy and their defence.
---
no it isnt
---
I doubt it. Both private servers and bot scripts are surprisingly profitable - much more so than regular jobs, but still the extra stability is not there.
---
Get con up to sort out teleports and pool (worth it imo for pking) if you stay at edge just level str/range if you go deeper, get 52 prayer, get 94 magic without hp XP and 90 range without hp XP, then level str up to around 85, if your looking for fashionscape./cosmetics/1 Def completion stuff, go get halo, complete all quests you can, ma2 Cape, and then eventually grind for inferno
---
Reminds me of anytime I go to the mage bank and someone tries to PK me between the levers. Like, aight dude, you want my knife or smth?
---
it took longer for you to type your comment than to look him up
---
This isn't true.  You can get Jad as a slayer task as long as you have TzHaar unlocked.
---
I agree, on my btw account I always close the doors after I pass through. That's just good manners.
---
I‚Äôve been back for 7 months, I quit back in 2010. I‚Äôm really enjoying it and there‚Äôs heaps of new content :)
---
Nope, bracketed the level for clarification. I know a mistake that‚Äôs commonly made is people don‚Äôt go into the basement
---
Yo''r'
---
You wanna click the reply button under the comment you want to reply to. If you type it in the box at the top, it adds a new top level comment that is unrelated to the other comments.
---
No. If you keep the item the imbue will stay.
---
Nah, but they'll keep pumping out "blogs" and talk about "future changes" to quite the crowd
---
I learned it yesterday when I started vork LMAO
---
Is that what a dickhead looks like
---
runecraft bad rift guardian good
---
&gt;Except that the advertising revenue actually declines because bots don't click adverts so you're just nerfing the click-through-rate.    
---
On F2P yes, but there's scammers on P2P worlds too. So at least this'd achieve that they have to pay twice the membership fee.
---
Normal setting is still 85k/he for me... And no need to lower go at all. I'm using a whip. Truly once every 20min pot up and that's it. I get like 5 hour inventory's.
---
If you can be bothered and have a lot of time 80 agi for fire orbs is 40K xp/h and 500k/h. Another good method is enchanting diamond jewelry, it's uber afk and about 50k xp/h while being free.
---
lmao none. BH is strictly for experienced pkers, and the skill gap there is insane because of it. only a retard goes and tries to do BH to learn to PK. if not for emblems there is no reason to do BH. all youll be doing is sucking and dying and providing tier upgrades for sharks while simultaneously taking emblems out of the game if you somehow get kills. 
---
i have no idea why anyone would defend new accounts doing BH and using it to "learn to pk". as for experienced players, i understand, but it takes about a week to build and quest a competent low level pure anyways if youre extremely efficient but also have a life outside of runescape. 
---
and for sweaty neckbeards who make accounts in several days, theyll be disadvantaged, but theyre a niche part of the community and its a small price to pay for game integrity. 
---
ANY ACCOUNT, experienced or otherwise can literally go deep wild, edge pk, or PVP world before their timer is up, its not like they cant PK. it is retarded to go to BH and try to learn to PK there lmao. and like i said its a small price to pay for experienced neckbeards considering the amount of botting that will be stopped.
---
Petition to add Manners skill.
---
When I do use the app, I'll be doing something afk, and use screen lock option available on the android gaming app. I don't believe it has anything to do with my settings. It's only a been a common occurrence for about a week and a half. I guess others are experiencing the same problem. I'm assuming it has to do with jagex backend. ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Dharok
---
Get agility pleb, teleblock means nothing
---
&gt;it‚Äôs your wife‚Äôs fault she was in a PVP zone
---
i have no idea why anyone would defend new accounts doing BH and using it to "learn to pk". those people are noobs or people who dont PK apparently trying to make excuses for emblem farming.
---
as for experienced players, i understand, but it takes about a week to build and quest a competent low level pure anyways if youre extremely efficient but also have a life outside of runescape. 
---
I know, that's why I brought it up. Gorilla plugin should be removed too then, or plugins for zulrah or hydra put in/back. It's inconcistent
---
so windranger from dota 2?
---
/s love the art man
---
This problem is that this will reduce the amount that get reported, thus less information for the mods. It means that everyone not using RL with this filter will continue seeing them, it doesn't actually help the initial problem in the first place and people who start using it will care less about the problem because it's not affecting them any more - so less awareness for Jagex to do something about it.  
---
I know you have good intentions, but ignoring the underlying problems won't make it stop for the rest of the community and I believe we should be pushing the issue of it happening towards Jagex more instead of sweeping it under the carpet for those who play on 3rd party clients.
---
Yeah didn‚Äôt think it would but worth a try. Best bet is you‚Äôre just extremely unlucky
---
Oddly enough I found it instantly before even reading the title, I was immediately drawn to it and idk why, this scares me, what am I becoming?
---
Well runeliteplus and lyzrdlite are both clients that I'm sure jagex wouldn't accept. They're just not as public as the more moderate ones. I find them to be risky in the long run, since the more op plugins they introduce the more likely jagex is to intervene and make it against the rules.
---
Nice now fuck off my feed

Stranding
---
stats for that account when you wrote this comment lmao?
---
Very true, I didn't think about that. Still though, personally, I stopped reporting them a long time ago. I just couldn't be bothered dealing with it anymore since it's been going on for so long.
---
Sje'hs so hot!
---
He purely uses void, void pure.
---
Depends where you are and if you need to be on the standard spellbook. It's sometimes used in pking and barrows.
---
Top gear AND osrs? I love you.
---
Real talk, most of the people are braindead with their information ending up their account getting recoverd, the same retard that cry about account recovery system being "shit" are the same idiots that sell all their personal data to some shitty survey website for 2 pennys to pay rs membership.
---
Sure jagex can implent more security when it comes to authenticator
---
Welcome to the community!
---
1) Your account is available across all devices using the same login, be it mobile or desktop
---
2) The community has embraced mobile and it's really popular for new and old players. Particularly for veterans, the fact it's bringing in new players is another big reason to support it.
---
3) Unofficial clients aren't officially supported by Jagex, and they don't guarantee your account safety using them. That being said, the vast majority of players on desktop use Runelite instead of the official client (myself included) and given the community drama last time there was an issue with it, you aren't going to have any problems using it.
---
4) The population is the healthiest it's been since re-launch 5+ years ago. The online users consistently hits over 100,000, and even now in a relatively quiet time for the US it's at 56,000 users. The community is generally really friendly towards new players, and most veterans in-game are happy to answer questions and help when they can (although things like begging are generally frowned upon).
---
In terms of a game that lets you do whatever you want, OSRS is probably the best example you can find. Dozens of bosses, active PvP, 23 different skills to train, 142 quests, plus minigames, miniquests and more - people often joke the hardest decision of their childhood was deciding what to train on Runescape when they got home. Hope you enjoy your time here, and feel free to add me in-game if you have any questions or want advice, my IGN is Wazi.
---
What temple is this? I used to get zammy wines at the temple on the west side of the wildy, at level 38, and there's always bots there, but they can actually open the door if it's closed
---
Whoever you were trying to talk to won't see this
---
Nmz in obsidian gear would be the best way to train, unless you just want to slay
---
I bursted/barraged dust devils off task for 75-97 mage.  Bursting you 100% make profit.  Wear a ring of wealth, and the cash drops you get will be the profit.  The misc staves/runes and other drops will pay for the runes you use.  Barraging let‚Äôs you break even, but you won‚Äôt profit much if at all, since it‚Äôs like 1.8k per cast.  Hope this helps.
---
Source: 31k dust devils killed lol (no d chain :/)
---
Yeah, same. That's why I started using bots.
---
This is the one next to the Goblin Village, which has 2 floors and it's almost always occupied ([Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Chaos_Temple_(Asgarnia)))
---
Ahahahahhaa it kills me when the beat drops
---
Master clue step, death runes, song of the elves.
---
Hey. You gotcha, new account, new mod, yes - excited to engage with y'all.
---
Let the 'find the _____' trend begin
---
2147/2277 total, I'd consider that almost maxed.
---
Never noticed got full void all helms on my main, and loved pc back in the day lol
---
I'm no expert, but if he was ghostmousing wouldn't it continue to click but in entirely different spots having him run all over the place..?
---
I just went to try it out and can confirm they stop at the tile before the door, very cool, thanks.
---
Accurate
---
How exactly do you think case-sensitivity is going to help account security?
---
Most people that enter their details into a phishing site are going to do it regardless of case-sensitive passwords. People keylogged are going to have their password compromised the same way regardless of case-sensitivity. People re-using pwned passwords across sites are also going to be compromised the same way if they re-use a case-sensitive password with RS and some other site.
---
Flat and ever expanding... we‚Äôll eventually have a map ten miles long and it never connects to the other end...
---
If they respawned faster it would be a fantastic place for f2p ranged exp
---
I found a karambwan
---
I got mine yesterday at ZMI at level 72 :D
---
because you already used your rewards on your account. you cant just have unlimited membership by using prepaid cards to get prime
---
Alright, thank you all so so much for the replies! I feel very welcomed in here already. I'm planning to stick with the game for a long time. If anyone wants to add me, feel free to do so: 0Andorea0
---
Hope to see you all in Gielinor :)
---
not all hacked accounts are like that had a mate get hacked somehow through email auth and ingame auth he logged off after raiding and had almost max raid gear he learnt to bank after he was done i always bank before logging off i theroised he got ratted did a malware scan turned up positive but dont know what for still now 100% about getting pawned he said it was positive could have been addware you would imagine if he got ratted they would get the bank pin so no idea
---
I thought it was funny
---
their financial is irrelevant in determining if what you are paying is cheap or not
---
I can't, I'm contractually obligated to be here.
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks man. You're the type of person I give a shit about :)
---
na the spawn is to0 good , he can easly lure the healers and pray melee but seems that he is pretty noob so its probably rip.
---
Mobile will log you out if you close your phone.  It‚Äôs built into the Apple OS to save battery and data usage.
---
A reply from a person working at Jagex? Now, I really feel welcome.
---
no, just no.
---
Good to hear. :) 
---
I assume that we get your official introduction on the next Q&amp;A stream then, correct? Or are you from another department?
---
PvP world's exist my dude.
---
Not really it's just a shitty thing that shitty people do.
---
Awh hell yeah. Haven't actually seen it myself but I hadda look this up myself a few months ago after seeing it everywhere.
---
"PKers don't like to fight each other because they don't make money."
---
flexxxxx chad
---
Took me like 5 seconds to go from "Find the spade" to "Find the handle"
---
Wow, that is actually really interesting to know, thanks for the info! 
---
I just tried it out after seeing a comment on a week old thread and clearly not being as computer savvy as other people it did come as a shock that my password just works regardless of what is capitalised and isn't.
---
If you're telling me not to worry, I'll try!
---
runecraft bad
---
vazonas istikruju turi aptarnauti, ir tarnauk nx, dddvigubai dielos
---
I miss that man. Now everyone is a pure with million GP tribrid setups. It‚Äôs not fun for a casual player since you can‚Äôt compete. Back in the day the average PKer was just some dude who walked into the wildy with a rune or D scim looking to fight and it was fun.
---
There is some merit to it. If you post personal things about yourself on Reddit they can be related to your account and aid in recovery. It‚Äôs also a funny meme
---
Nope
---
Get a fighter torso
---
Eh, identifying an account through levels is like trying to hack a combination lock with preset combinations for hundreds of the same lock with slight variations... 
---
I doubt people have to worry about other people knowing what they‚Äôve been doing for 5 years...
---
you dont have to it looks messy but 1 defence level wont make a meaningful impact on your combat lvl so keep going and be the 2 def pure its double the defence of the other people
---
It's like Initial D meets economics.
---
Even when using super antifire?
---
I need imbues anyway so I need to get some nmz in for the three rings, slayer mask, and salve ammy
---
I don't know why, but i spent a good few minutes looking at this, only to realize i don't play OSRS anymore, and that i'm literally just wasting my time looking for a spade.
---
That being said i did find it.
---
I don't think theres any information to be gleaned from gamble bots. They're very basic bots, the reason they're so numerous is because its piss easy to start one. It's not like a zulrah bot that needs a very specific set up and a complex code to run.
---
I want more poster worthy images like this lol
---
You got it all wrong dude, no wonder you think its OP
---
It doesn't give you 2+ per cross, it heals you completely and gives you 2+ over, like this is'nt some RS3 Shit.
---
God damn it. I thought by cropping out my 'swap' option then it would have kept me safe. You have probably worked out I am spinning flax and that's why it's set to withdraw all. Please let me finish gaining the crafting XP from this and the subsequent fletching XP from adding the bow string to my yew longbow (u)'s - you have probably worked out I will be setting it to withdraw 14 for this process, but have sympathy on me before you take these yew longbows from my pathetically weak grasping hands.
---
The difference in WoW PvP is that you don't lose most of your shit to an obscure death mechanic when you die.
---
1m an hour for minimal effort and work.. is not cheap labour
---
now go learn about brute force attacks and why case sensitive passwords don't matter in rs
---
Doesn't even have to be luring. Back in 2007 someone kept closing the door on me trying to escape a losing fight with a man in Lumbridge castle and stole all my starter gear when I died
---
The dock is full with bots but this talk is typical for world 1. A lot of non bot players are fishing there nowadays.
---
You need to do a ton more games if you absorb full health
---
Reddit bout to hit me with 'popular on 2007scape' notification
---
Not sure actually. What department was the assumption?
---
(1074-1240)/1240 = -.13
---
x100 = 13%
---
This doesn't account for people like Natte Kaas who had someone attempting hundreds of recoveries a day. He tweeted Jagex saying someone was trying to recover him and they said there's nothing that can be done. He was later recovered and his iron lost all of it's items. He quit that account.
---
Even in cases where it is the player's fault, companies like blizzard restore your account and advise you how to prevent this from happening. With Jagex you can't even talk to "Customer Service", you just get directed to an article. 
---
They pulled in over 60m pounds last year, they can do better. Much much better.
---
This is very creative
---
It's very rhythmic and entrancing. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxSWVkPfVc8
---
It doesn't really matter - there are protections in place against brute force attacks
---
Maybe I should change my flair to Ironmen :/
---
World hop, go through door, hop back, grab stuff.
---
I personally like getting def first but im weird lol. You take less damage over time for the long run saving money in food and pots. Plus the untrim cape is nice
---
If you do this don‚Äôt forget the email! I did this once...
---
It‚Äôs a dog eat dog world out there, see what people will do for 25gps and a bucket if it keeps runes on the table
---
Fr though one of the most annoying mechanics in this game, to me, is the doors.  It‚Äôs such an old game design thing that really makes you feel like this is a late 90s/early 2000s game, but not in a good nostalgia goggles way.  It‚Äôs bad.  Stupid doors stay open ugh!
---
no but i mean, i'm getting 3k for the inadequacy when i should be getting up to 50k with this setup, i've done plenty of nmz, something is just off now.
---
Level 3 bald fucks everywhere
---
Engine work.
---
Not gonna lie bwana, you had us in the first half
---
1. Yes
---
2. Definitely not looked down on, or up to, but knowing someone plays mostly on mobile restricts some of the end game content (without loads of practice).  Completing fight caves for you on a phone will be significantly more challenging than on a computer for the first time.  That being said, players have completed inferno mobile only so I can't say much.  I enjoy mobile for some bankstanding skills, or slayer! (slayer ftw)
---
3. Runelite FTW.  Be careful about links for 'ad on packages' or other features.  Only trust verified sources.
---
4. Runescape's player base is pretty toxic not gonna lie.  Lots of people are around to help or guide newer players, but there are a TON of scammers, phishers, lurers etc... Join a clan or discord community within the game and make some friendships.  Talking to people at the grand exchange can be one of the most toxic experiences in runescape.  On the inverse i've had great conversations with randos.  Luck of the draw I guess
---
  Edit: That song slaps.
---
Sea Shanty 2 is what you hear on loop when you drop acid.
---
Probably not, good thing max isn't my goal.
---
If you pay for membership of the account
---
Credit card information would likely be enough to recover from jagex
---
Go through their channels
---
With your stats, you don‚Äôt need to be on task. You also don‚Äôt need to worry about healers at all. Just tag them and let them hit you, you won‚Äôt die if you‚Äôre wearing decent gear. I just got my fire cape after reaching Jad 4 times. There‚Äôs a really good flash simulator that I used to practice before my last attempt and it helped immensely. Don‚Äôt waste an hour getting to Jad just to die again. I‚Äôll link it when I‚Äôm on PC but the simulator saved me so many attempts and got me comfortable with tagging healers and prayer switching.
---
You miss all the pet drops you don't roll for brother. Best of luck
---
I just go barrows
---
Did this too with blowpipe. the XP is absurd
---
No. One twitch prime per acc
---
I see dragonball I upvote good day sir
---
Nmz made everyone level 120 what a joke
---
I'd rather have these old models.
---
We need a bot for this question on this sub
---
It‚Äôs time
---
Ahh yeah I see what you mean, one sounds like it was run through an 8-bit sound generator whereas the other has the more authentic windy kind of sound.
---
I'd still take either of those versions over the trap remix though, haha.
---
Literally takes a second to do so you god damn sperg.
---
I love that so many people are rediscovering how awesome the game is. In todays game market osrs is a throwback to older times. But damn if it wasn't better then.
---
I personally got strength first so I could use a whip to train the other two.
---
It could probably wont.
---
This guy said it perfectly! ü§ó
---
One thing I would like to add for you is if you‚Äôre really interested in the community aspect if the game, check out the osrs clan forums! There are different clan focuses ranging from social to skiller, pvp and pvm! So just look for one that fits your play style and goals and apply away!
---
Joining a clan enhanced my game 1000% and gave me a consistent group of friends to socialize and do activities with on top if just running into cool people in game!
---
Yes, that does explain why there's suddenly a new name.
---
Neither of them are completely open source
---
Its a different client which has plugins the RL team has been asked to remove by Jagex
---
great editing on this
---
That looks like a right fucking knees up
---
Meds are farmed at a much greater quantity than hards through implings regularly. However, the cost of implings is usually factored into the decision of farming medium clues, so the value of medium clues seems inflated.
---
Anyone got a list of what plugins runelite plus has/what they do?
---
As far as I know, runelite plus has no affiliation with regular runelite.  Could be wrong, but some YouTubers have said things about it in the past.
---
Yeah there's no base evidence the player was ghostmousing, but hey people like to assume stuff right.
---
I honestly love this, gonna follow you from here. Keep up the amazing work dude üëçüèª

Fool, this can‚Äôt even be considered a simple warmup to us creatures in the deep wilderness, we can smell spades from anywhere within the wilderness no matter where we are. I‚Äôll come back eventually and smite you down for your spade while continuing the search for the rumored gilded spade. Once I get over this curse  you people call ‚Äòagility‚Äô and ‚Äòquests‚Äô
---
I'd love that, you never have to leave the wildy to get your stuff
---
Also wildy only UIM would love it
---
But the Persians (Bots) won the battle of Thermopylae
---
God, I hated supervisors that sat on their phone all day...not only could at least assist your crew and help out but you could be watching out for any safety hazards or mistakes the crew makes. I understand lazy supervisors are the construction way but god damn it's like their work ethic immediately goes out the window. Do you're damn job
---
&gt;risking more than what it's worth
---
Why are you risking anything?
---
I use paypal
---
Hah! Finally someone hints at it. Took less time than I thought!
---
Because that spellbook came out after construction, and they couldn't be fucked to update it. $11
---
I usually lose a little bit of money bursting dusts off task, since I hate losing my spot while banking so I only pick up high value alchables. It's still pretty close to break even, though.
---
I know who is a bot when they stand in their scripted spot next to the bench. I would never lock out a fellow human woodcutter.
---
You gotta say no homo or else you gay, dad
---
Nice! I will look into thosen thanks &lt;3
---
Arcane aswell, but I got the pet with it so I'm legally not allowed to complain about anything CoX related anymore.
---
Great, now I have to go watch Rick and Morty
---
Yea, OP's picture is just terrible quality
---
Rip bro. Jagex should fix that it will be automaticly send to your bank tbh..
---
whoa, that's very helpful actually! thanks man will study it
---
I wish I would've taken off a couple more days n gone straight to bonaroo from STL.  STL was wild though. Go blues! I think there is a cc called pinscape. I've definitely met some other umph n phish phans playin lately though.
---
On the plus side, just means you'll have even more keys by the time you're ready to fight him.
---
*Thanks Junior Navigator*
---
What's on your feet?
---
I tried obor with base 60 melee, 57 range, and 59 mage and got destroyed. I wouldnt do it
---
You can be annoyed all you want. Complaining about it is what makes you cancer.
---
Same here. I'm also scared to death of accidentally logging into a PvP world and being killed anywhere, moreso because I remember some shit about hardcore PvP worlds where part of your bank would drop too. I have no idea how all that works.
---
And now one with RTX OFF 
---
Frickin RS3 graphics smh
---
Oh my god this is so god
---
Doesn‚Äôt work in pvp, sadly. The big defensive bonus it gives still works, but not the damage reduction sadly
---
You do make money, but ur main profit will come from smoke bstaff and occult over a task (if you're lucky enough to snag any).
---
Max melee bonus with karils top/bottom (arma gives negative melee bonuses so karils is preferred).
---
Spec wep is up to you, I like SGS

I'd have to agree - trying to explain things in game to people is a total pain in the ass. Had a guy asking me how to cut sullusceps (spelling...) the other day, had to write a novel in 80 char lines to help him out
---
Because people would rather be spoon-fed information to be efficient over entertaining any possibility of a 3rd-party client increasing account hijack risks.
---
Nope. Even the word "reclaim" is kind of misguided here, you never claimed it. It isn't yours lol
---
You can't really camp thermy. He's task only.
---
I usually make ~3m per task without uniques. Set up is karils top and bottom, d defender, tent whip, slayer helm, torture, prims, zerk ring, dds/sgs/Dclaws/Dwh depending what I have in my bank at the time.
---
Has he tried safespotting Troll Generals? Some even have a common key half drop and it's only a small walk to Burthorpe for him!
---
ah a man of culture after all. great series bro keep it up
---
Damn it's only 4 m for some reason I thought it was closer to 100
---
We getting a bot "nuke" this week or something?
---
&gt;Is the full obsidian set + sword worth it once I hit 60 combat stats? 
---
Yep
---
&gt;Once I hit 70, should I switch to dharok?
---
Nope. Dharok isn't better than obby till like 95 str/hp basically
---
Is one of the blocks attached to his chest?
---
Yes and no like
---
You have quite the rs3 way of seeing sets
---
In osrs what is important is that you pick max strength gear
---
Dharok is only good at nmz or at pking
---
Obby set isn't a great choice unless you're training strength
---
At 60 combat stats you need a dragon scimi, fighter torso, helm of neitzisnot, dragon boots, combat bracelet, amulet of glory, dragon defender and dragon platelegs
---
&gt;Is it against the rules to spread max cash across multiple accounts to avoid the trade limit and buy out an item?
---
&gt;Is this considered merchanting?
---
Maybe? I guess. But it's fine lol, merchanting isn't against the rules.
---
There are no grand money makers in f2p, I'd recommend just dropping some cash on members and playing the real game
---
Standing at the ge begging for cash, making 10k an hour, instead of killing literally anything for more
---
Masterpiece!
---
Depends what method you use. Would probably break even on the redemption method.
---
However the other method, you‚Äôll profit. Just gotta hope for the occult necklace to make money.
---
Set up- Karil‚Äôs top and bottom, primordials, avernic, abyssal tent, suffering (ri), torture, slayer helm, rada‚Äôs blessing 4, ferocious gloves and infernal cape.
---
Special attack weapon: claws/crystal hally or saradomin godsword.
---
Definitely a scythe. F in the chat boys
---
Sadly, this is true. Even the stronghold of security has pretty much lost its purpose

Who cares about points when this thread is about XP...

I personally went for herb sack first (just got at 77) then ring bling after because of the 75 crafting,if you want a nice few points try out Konar for 18 a task, although each task is location locked.
---
Rangers have been 30m+ for like 8 months
---
I can get 20 mins afk with absorbs and super combats. Not sure what you're talking about...
---
Trueee then i can try back to back
---
Now find a karrambwan
---
It was during 2008-2010 era iirc, they had these imrpoved upperfloor agility levels and barbarian one was the best post 80 or something. I could be miles off here but this is the image I have in my head.
---
Can't interact with eachother except for minigames and raids (end game content)
---
Galaxy phones since at least the S8 have had an oleophobic coating on the screen, to make it pick up fingerprints less, but it's literally just a coating similar to paint and it scratches really easily, I had very fine scratches all over my S8 two days after I bought it and I practically babied it. 
---
So it could be that which has scratched too. If the scratch is so deep that you can "feel it" then it's definitely the Gorilla Glass that has been damaged, though.
---
*Only we can smoke weed*
---
You know that‚Äôs gonna be an ugly kid.
---
I find 20 min afk is way better than 5 minute afk tho. I'd rather be able to do real life stuff (aka my job) while I'm making gains at home with remote desktop (OSRS mobile dces too easily for hours of this method)
---
I‚Äôve learned the most important thing is enjoying it. If you enjoy it, the levels and money will come.
---
We are few in number
---
With ward you still need super antifire and then pray Range
---
That's cook-cook from fallout new Vegas
---
Gtfo fgt
---
This is some quality shit right here
---
she has nipples lmfao
---
You use locator orb every 20 minutes so you never go above 20hp
---
Fuck. I just saw that like a couple days ago and you still got me.
---
They've talked about the difficulty of this change on stream before, don't think we will see it any time soon
---
C# and Java are basically the same language.
---
for some reason this hasnt been working for me. twice now i remote in after 12 min, drink a combat pot, hit an enemy, then remote back in 12 min later and im logged out. Can't figure out what im doing wrong
---
Ah rip i was hoping to cut my costs. The fact that supers only last 6 mins vs 8 for extended antis mean i have to repot for my 4th kill.
---
 I have about 2mil hard gold, and for the time being yes, I will depend on bonds!
---
That's why I craft a fake identity with their own backstory for every single account I make! ^^/s
---
Vorkath needs 3 "levels" of antifre shield is 1 level regular antifre is 1 level super antifre is 2 levels and pray mage is 1 level
---
So with dfw you use super antifre and pray range (the rang hits hit harder or are more common I can't recall which)
---
With blowpipe you pray mage and use a super antifre to fully protect from the dragonfire
---
So you still take a lot more damage making your games not even 1/4th of someone that stays 1hp..
---
Thanks for the detailed Explanation op!

Just flinch him.

Obor can hit 22s quite a lot, and the fight is instanced so if you're pretty low on gp you dont wanna take your best shit in there and lose everything except the 3 kept on death and be broke after. i got smacked at ~40 base melees if i remember right, maybe at base 50s give it a try and make sure you got the best food at your disposal

Jagex‚Äôs limited login attempts prevent brute force attacks via login screen, but in case someone steals the runescape password DB and has time to spend cracking password hashes, then yes, additional password complexity is useful.

So, I am a returning player but I seem to have encountered an issue with the GE that I haven't seen before. I am unable to sell a large quantity of items (crayfish), what is the issue? Gives me some weird alert.
---
Sorry it took you 20 seconds to recover
---
More likely in Hunter, or none
---
For me, early-game ends when you get barrows gloves.
---
Yeah, I didn't really mind it. I had a clue box and protect item on, so I really only lost a few manta rays and a pair of vambraces (which I've got about another half dozen of, so that's no big deal)
---
You have to enable challenge mode, go down the trapdoor and stand on it. It deals 2-3 damage per tick. It's faster than duelling ring to clan wars. :)
---
Just do birdhouses runs. Getting to 60 will fly by
---
This is quite possibly the best, most top quality post ever made on this sub, thx for the laugh
---
Oh damn but I heard this was taken out of runelite so I assume this runelite plus isn‚Äôt actually by the original creators of rune lite? So could maybe inherit a ban for its use? Or am I wrong I‚Äôm new to this shit
---
U need dt and rfd bosses on.
---
Ok this was one of the top gif memes ive seen since osrs launched well done
---
There's red chins as well before flax
---
I'm gonna preface this by saying i dont know too much about rev caves, but can't you just spam the agility shortcut to stall out the intervals between attacks and outlast the tb, then just tab out?
---
Name and stats can be used to id. Others are just a meme because u opened paint anyway might as well go ham
---
Aww.
---
Yep I gave 8k to someone the other day and they logged the moment the trade was accepted.  Freaking bots man.
---
Yes, it consumes a fire talisman every time you craft runes, and the talismans are 2.5k each. You also lose money on the essence and elemental runes, too. I might be wrong saying its a couple mil an hour, but you lose a decent amount of money doing it.
---
75, 90, and 70 on this account and you reckon I could pk?
---
How do most people get to their POH? Aside from the construction cape and teleport to house spell, do you just use the fairy rings? So a typical route would be glory to edgeville -&gt; fairy ring to house? Or is there an easier way that I'm not seeing?

[should have used old reddit](https://i.imgur.com/OJQQoGz.png)
---
THIS IS CONTENT!!
---
Daggers are on par with scimitars for attack speed while offering less strength and accuracy. They need to have some type of attack speed buff to make them more akin to a melee style dart/throwing knife with regards to attack speed.
---
Serious question, why is the 1 defense so crucial? Doesn‚Äôt higher def give a higher chance for them to 0 hit?
---
It broke from the last game update. We are still working on a fix for it but it will probably be fixed in the next release.
---
*Clicks "Support"*
---
Nothing Interesting Happens.
---
This is top notch content.
---
Wtf is this supposed to be? I can't tell at all...
---
Not accurate at all
---
People don't NH tribrid on pvp worlds. Some people prefer skilled pking over asinine edgeville style RNG prod fights.
---
 So if BH worlds are on UK rotation as a US pker my options are: deal with awful ping, hop around in deep wild on normal worlds, or go to a pvp world and engage in a style of PKing I actively despise.
---
Enjoy your new job!
---
You can duo DKs by killing different kings, typically when low levels duo, one kills Rex and the other kills Prime and Supreme. It‚Äôs a stress free way for low levels to kill the bosses when they can‚Äôt kill all three by themselves. Once you both have the unique drops you need you can swap roles.
---
You can also do raids, Wintertodt, quests, skilling, you just can‚Äôt do a lot of bosses together.
---
I just see it as kids know the world is still sensitive on whatever so they exploit it and apply it to things they hate... either that or they want to sound cool by attacking their own insecurities.
---
RFD bosses aren't required
---
you should play LMS (last man standing) its free and you cant even take your own items, its like a battle royal, and everyone has the same combat stats. 
---
really similar to PK'ing without the risk
---
As osrs players we don't really have a leg to stand on criticising graphics.

---
"I killed X thing for (absurd amount of time) to obtain one item"  
---
Such is the iron life.
---
Still the fact remains that reddit solved problems which the appeals didn't. For me and you this can be okay because we use reddit but for the players that don't have to rely on the appeals which as said by you they get thousands.
---
Flair checks out
---
Tue mode where you pick the bosses reduces pointa to about 33%
---
that's easily the worst idea I've ever heard of for the wildy and it is clear you've never once attempted it
---
I'm having to do the ice gloves method. Its just triggering because I am definitely quick enough, I'd just rather have the stam in there instead.

Dang, how is he one-hitting those lv99 hp bots with a bronze spear. Is it the j-mod status

If this aint the realest meme out there...

What about modifications to game mechanics for PVP? Like if they polled changing entangle so it doesn't get halved by pray mage?
---
How do you go about splitting a spade? One gets the handle and the other guy a metal part?
---
to add on to this, [having a huge friend/ignore list can cause serious FPS issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/3wsv16/big_friend_list_makes_the_game_running_on_lower/). (unsure if this has been fixed).
---
you don't use clay to make pies dude.....
---
and to save money is why you would do that. When you actually get farther into the game and things start costing 100's of millions of gp (such as construction) you don't want to spend 100k on clay cause that would just be going backwards when getting planks always costs money with no other option. So you grab it as you need it.
---
Doing a quest and need an item? You could go out of your to go back to the TGE (as you say even though it just GE). or you can just pick it up along the way if you happen to know where it spawns. which you probably will look up cause people do anyway. 
---
you are basically embrassing yourself at this point with how many wrong things you are saying.
---
Runelite to much mechanics for free that help u get better at game and use less skill
---
This is without a shadow of doubt THE best post ive seen on this reddit üòÇ
---
One of the best versions of this yet. 8/10, had a hearty chuckle.
---
no the risk is someone else who is geared comes and kills you while you're trying to kill the gearless noob. It happens more often than you'd like to think because you don't know the wildy
---
Lol when did I complain about PvM in the wildy? Who are you responding to? You said it's hard to find PK targets and I told you how to find them. It seems like your only response to that is you're not good enough to kill actual PKers:
---
&gt;do you know how hard it is to make money unless you have serious skills?
---
is ranged with dhcb + ward + arma viable for afk rune drags? or do i *need* justicar + lance to afk? 85 att, 90 str, 85 def, 92 hp, 90 ranged if it matters.
---
While as funny as this is, the last thing Jagex is doing is effectively tackling the bot issue in this game lmao.
---
Its not easyscape because you have to be paying attention to not end up like the dude who died... Can you really not put that together?

Hey, bad place for this question, but that won't stop me. I've never contributed to a project before, but is there anything useful I could do for yours? Finishing an undergrad CS degree, I promise I'm not a complete idiot about code and efficiency. Java's my most comfortable language.
---
Cmon dude everyone has a masters in political studies on reddit.
---
As a pker I personally wouldn't give a shit.
---
I agree with your second point, but not the first.
---
Gmaul will still be as threatening provided the 50% spec clamp is introduced, so this would remain an issue.
---
Why do you feel damage soak is trash? Is it not in line with the goal of defense as a skill?

That fills up eventually. The regex does not.

By far the best for irons is necklace of passage to wizards tower. I did a lot of gem mining early on for a long-lasting stack of teleport jewelry (sapphires, emeralds, etc), you get a ton of jades doing that. If you ever decide to farm easy clues from ham members you get a ton of jades there too. I use the necklace allll the time any time I need to get to a fairy ring.
---
I think you‚Äôve just convinced me to do cerb. The 1/128 drop rate sounds juicy
---
Whether they're cunts or not is completely irrelevant.  
---
They exist only because it's more than worth it to do it, and the only way to stop it is to kill the root cause.  
---
Your very own stupidity. Not that it's possible...
---
Honestly just do herb runs, birdhouse runs, and grind slayer. Once you get to 70+ slayer you'll start making quite a bit of money from tasks. Gargoyles, bursting dust devils/ nechs, Kurasks/ Turoths, Demonic Gorillas (once you complete MM2), etc. are all great for gold.
---
There's no "easy" money makers outside of higher level bossing, which you get to from grinding out the lower levels.
---
If you're just looking to turn a quick profit with an afk skill, then cooking, fletching, and firemaking (wintertodt) will all net you a profit and level up fairly quickly.
---
My anus creamy

You know there's a lever in edgeville that teleports you to deep wildy, right?

---
takes like 60s to get back to rogues castle mate
---
PKers are the most annoying part of the Runescape community and that‚Äôll happen regardless of whether you‚Äôre geared up in the wildy or naked. I would say there‚Äôs PvM, achievement diaries, slayer, questing, and if you want an utterly fresh and fun experience then Ironman mode. I got burnt out on my main, and early Ironman was really fun, and you can afk f2p skills to get past the grind on your other account while playing your Ironman
---
Better as in more diversity in loot values. Old Konar drop table had multiple drops over million which added bit more excitement to those tasks.
---
I dolo (solo with 2 accounts). Ones maxed combat, the others an old maxed ranged tank pking account.
---
I legit last 3hrs and 100+ boss kills.

Your guys stats are fine. Just gonna have to get used to it, and it heavily relies on the tank.

I think it‚Äôs a problem with mobile, it‚Äôs been happening to me too but everything‚Äôs fine when I play on pc.
---
funny
---
Maybe try playing the game however you want. Come up with a random idea for an account like for an example an Ironman account that can only do Slayer tasks from a specific Slayer master.
---
Or an account that can only use the standard spellbook or only can use Lunars.
---
My dad used to always blame Runescape every time we got a virus.

Just a clarification question: When you get a new 99, all your old skills capes become trimmed, and your newest one is untrimmed? I assume that's why you do the drop and telegrab trick to keep the untrimmed capes.   
---
If that's the case, then you have to drop all your untrimmed capes everytime you're about to get a 99 or else all of them become trimmed?
---
I just bring an invent im not afraid to loose. Biggest risk is a glory and skills neck. I usually bring like 10k coins and 20 laws for tele. Never bring xerics tali to wildy. For gear I just bring like ardy cape batrows gloves ddef and dds. Go to clan wars after every fight.

I unno man we have a pretty damn nice subreddit. Only issue is we caught crabs a few updates ago. Haven‚Äôt been able to get rid of them yet. This helps tho.

Honestly could be, I used to play on his server and a few others with him while on Skype with a few other buddies. Been years though, like 10+

Service was stable, log out occurred during combat and there was no delay when logging back in saying I had not logged out from my last session like a normal DC.

Wow amazing, please more üòÅ

Not sure, haven't tried!

This happened to me at Rogue's Castle the other day, but I saw the scout and managed to escape them up the stairs anyways. On my character: D'scim, Rune Defender, Slayer Helm. I was risking 2 lobsters and the respawning gold ore I was picking up in my inventory though. Would've been a terrible loss.

The best part is that there was someone doing the Mage Arena boss right beside me..

Its because your window is larger. If you shrink it from the sides it should look right.

As a dev myself, I'd like to hear a bit more about that, any examples on tools you guys and gals make?

If it is things like RuneMetrics/Adventure log for rs3, I'm just going to shamelessly toss out a thing on my wishlist in the hope that it sticks somewhere in the back of your mind!
---
I'd love to have a completed quest list available through the osrs API. I'd like to make an adapting quest requirement page for the wiki! :)
---
It‚Äôs time to up the ante.
---
perfect
---
A quick mod of the syntax and I'm back-bottin' slayer.
---
Surprisingly, the vast majority of osrs content exists outside of pvp areas. go do some of that instead of only hanging out in the one pvp area.
---
less facetiously, you should do more quests. barrows gloves and quest point cape are good long term goals that will keep you going until you're solidly mid level.
---
"google it" fits in one line
---
thats odd. if cape was removed you'd 100% have gotten a perm. try twitter?
---
should be illegal. They stick to butts too well. Do you know what that does to men. It's like dangling a smoked pork chop over a hungry dog.
---
What would I be ignorant of? Thinking you shouldn‚Äôt be able to hop worlds camping pvmers isn‚Äôt dumb just because it‚Äôs a suggestion that makes you salty. I‚Äôm sure that huge risk of 109k when you go pking hurts your bank, but it‚Äôs not a big risk in general when you‚Äôre hunting people who aren‚Äôt fighting back no matter ‚Äúhow often‚Äù you say you run into other pkers in the minute it might take you to kill a chin hunter. What‚Äôs really dumb is thinking that just because someone doesn‚Äôt share the same opinion as you about pvp that that person is is dumb. Btw probably a typo but you put your instead of you‚Äôre. Clear enough for you?

---
RL seems cheap as hell, surprised Jagex allows it at all.
---
its possibly bannable, but im not sure if they can detect it. However it seems clear that jagex does not approve of its use, and so it is at least against the spirit of the game. Not sure why i got downvoted for answering your question but c'est la vie.

Dragon/avernic defender plus extended super anti fire pots the way to go.

The bots can be killed by stacking the monks near the door. It was made it a bit more difficult in one of the last updates somehow though...  
---
trap the monks by standing on the empty tiles at the end of the 2 rows where they chase the player/bot out and wait, when the bot telegrabs, run through the monks and the bot so the monks can stack on top of each other to attack all at once. (easier with 2 accounts/players). Try to get them stacked and trapped all on 2 tiles. Attacking the furthest monk on the row(s) inside can also trap the rest near the door. This all takes some practice.
---
Its a great place to train range and chill while making mils on low lvl f2p accounts.
---
If Jagex were to add 1 or 2 extra monks, or increase their hit by 2, it would be much much easier.
---
Late to the thread so probably wont be seen, oh well.
---
yeah i am doing everything in that video (i think), thats where i got the idea. not sure what i am doing wrong.
---
Next one should run around the entire swamp.

I doubt they have ever perm banned someone for this. Never seen a case where they have.

Dagannoth Kings are my favorite boss to solo. Decent consistent money with noted bones, and nice boosts from archer's and zerker ring.

Was the same for us when we had the "family computer" (used exclusively by my brother and I, and our mother). RuneScape obviously created the viruses and distributed them via the "Bon_Jovi_Discography.exe music file" mum had downloaded from limewire. 
---
Once I had my own computer, there were never any issues. Mum still had us remove RuneScape from the family computer. Though this had little effect on the overall performance of said machine as she had also recently taken a liking to Shania Twain and AC/DC.

It‚Äôs amazing how many people actually believe the security system is flawless.  Probably the vast majority hackings are from people being dumb but the recovery system is most definitely flawed.

2FA on your email/account doesn‚Äôt matter whatsoever if your account is recovered.

I had something dirtier in mind.

Nice stolen post.

If they do add them it should take some kind of untradable resource that you have to grind for, similar to how you need dark essence blocks to make the teletabs.

thats what he gets for taking fighter boots over fancy

You are right that they can be disabled without a delay but you will need the account recovery information as well.

Pretty ridiculous to be polling that shit. Equally ridiculous is that it will probably pass.

Hi, my name is Eirika, and I'm a very naughty girl. I usually go to my sister's house in Seiyuu's room while she's in the shower. Even though she normally doesn't take part in such activities, she likes to see me like this, so there's no doubt it's her. She's so gentle that she's always whispering with a tender smile on her face. If you go to her room, I say hi with a sweet whisper, so when I kiss her, sometimes I touch her soft skin even after she's been completely naked before. I can't keep my lips closed when I'm masturbating as long as I want to, but I don't mind when I go to her room and have my tongue licking inside her little mouth. I just know that you'll understand, right? If I'm lying on my stomach, I lay my hips down on her small bedside table and kiss her gently, then I lean around and rest my face against her breast, so I can suck my own nipples. It's that kind of lovemaking that makes me want to keep on masturbating because I can feel my body getting closer and closer to orgasm. I want you to be sure to give me a hard slap for my insolence when everyone else starts masturbating too, and when all is finally over, I'll take that dirty toy back to

It costs mils/hour to hire essence runners and you need to read up on the Magic Imbue spell.

TBH, this is why they need to stop skipping the discussion part of polls. The point of Dev Blogs is to get community feedback before things make it to the poll, but too often they throw in questions last minute or revise the blog and then poll it a day later before most can review the changes.

You are just describing another attack vector to compromise your account.

Her design has a mix, it fits more with the elf look and it has a more range concept on it which it‚Äôs technically suppose to be. I just feel the improvements she made on it from before just sells the deal for me. If you could improve off of her final design that‚Äôd be cool!

many, many years ago

Because you can make the same and more doing something that doesnt suck dick :s

Ay pass the link

You should be using Full Obsidian with Berserker Necklace and Obby sword. As well as an Ardy Cape 3+ ideally for the stab bonus. Dharok's doesn't really become useful for you until 90+ HP/Strength.   
---
For your first time in NMZ, you'll need to use prayer pots and super combat potions. Maybe like 4-8 Super Combat Potions and the rest Prayer Pots while you pray melee. Do a hard rumble with all the correct bosses (different depending on whether you value points/hr or exp/hr), then from then on, you can just buy Absorption Potions from the NMZ Chest instead of Prayer pots. Super Combats aren't necessarily needed depending on how much you're willing to spend to increase xp/hr a bit.

You missed an opportunity to put NMZ for 99 combat stats to be honest.
---
&gt;Gets proven wrong, writes rage paragraph about the meaning of virtue signaling to divert attention
---
For the armor, I think that may be more of the case of buffing it post-release if needed. For the blade, it was probably a "if the community wants it" before reworking it; if it failed then they may have tried other versions. But there are times when seemingly majority feedback is ignored.

there's a guy who killed zuk, got kc, could get a task and did not get cape.

Dang.. but don‚Äôt you think something would have happened by now if anything was in danger? Like weird posts on social media or money taken from my bank account? 
---
I don‚Äôt know the exact date I clicked on the link but it was probably 4-5 months ago now.
---
Yeah, I get that. I guess I've just been playing with the mindset of average loot being regular drops. I always thought of uniques as being a bonus on top of what you're killing because since they're so rare, it's hard to calculate is as a consistent money maker (I got my first prim at 2238). It's a way to make myself be less disappointed when I'm having a dry streak. Sorry for calling you a dipshit, and hope that helps understand the point of view I'm coming from.
---
It may be fast and pretty afk but after getting my imbues i really dont feel like going in there again.
---
Boring if you pay attention and always feels like I should be doing something else in game. and if you just leave it i cant help but feel im not doing it right if i let my hp climb like normal.
---
How do you get your account changed to a new email?
---
Depends if you get a max hit (you don't for staking).
---
Then you finally get there missing gear and such so you go back to the ge and repeat.
---
Obviously if you're an efficiency-scaper who plays for optimum gp/h, pking isn't the proper method, but some people find PvM tediously boring, and use PvP to make money, you can't say that nobody pks for gp.

Java is almost identical to c# for the most parts, you should take a look around.

Positive boosts to all stats, brothers have no defense so just use it to make sure my magic and range are above 0.

Has group Ironman been polled or discussed officially? Can we expect it in the future for certain?

before coming back to OSRS the last time I did Monkey Madness, Underground Pass, Legend's Quest etc was when I was in elementary school, I printed the entire quest guide out in black and white and had had the pages stapled together on my desk

shit took me so fucking long to do, I was dreading doing those quests again

fast forward to whenever I started OSRS and I did all of those quests in the same day, they took me like &lt; 1 hr each even at my terrible pace

What exactly is so wrong with these poll questions?
---
Hey i started doing vorkath yesterday and i have the same problem that i cant get more than 2 kills per trip using bp + elite void + rigour. I think using a decent crossbow + antifire shield works better since you will be praying ranged instead of magic because the shield will negate vorkath's dragon breath
---
I only care about people who laugh at my shitty jokes too haha
---
Malwarebytes
---
Also a DFS instead of defender. That will negate all damage from his breath attacks (obviously apart from the  top down one) which will extend trips.
---
Alright thanks for being so detailed. I didn't know I only needed absorption if I'm using obsidian. Are overload potions only used with Dharoks?
---
As far as internet strangers go, I would hope so.
---
I would suggest just using trident on Ahrim.  I bring a mage chest switch though since you can't have a negative mage bonus.
---
I like this idea a lot. Easy way to showcase your head drops, and gives them another use other than just the slayer helm.
---
I had never seen an Alfie vid/stream until last night. He seems pretty irritating. His reaction to the whole thing caused people to talk about it in Purpps chat and Mintmadcows chat. Props to both of them for curbing the gossip in their own channels but I couldn‚Äôt help but pop over and see what was going on
---
I‚Äôve had terrible luck with drops, but things gotta start somewhere! This dragon med helm is the start isn‚Äôt it???

Gz now alch yoursef

And how many people do you see running around wearing ferocious gloves on their pk trips? Nobody because that extra risk isn't worth the small ass bonus. The gloves aren't that price solely for pvp fam

---
Cookie salesman lookin ass
---
This is good content.
---
I don't quite follow, perhaps we have pretty different perceptions on what make the elves and crystal what they are.
---
You see, I find the crystal bow to be the peak of something OSRS is missing lately: Aesthetics taking a backseat in favor of gameplay and lore. It's just an unusually colored bow with a different curve than your typical bow, yet its unique mechanics and the lore behind elven crystal make it such an iconic weapon that it'll have an armor set made around it.
---
By contrast, what Gee has come up with for the armor... I find it a bit much.
---
Apart from data breaches, you could also query/bruteforce the RS sign up pages with or without an existing email list to see which emails are already taken. I assume these osrs/rs3 email list are sold somewhere.
---
&gt;cain and abel
---
oh I remember cain and abel. Had some good times using it to lag switch on black ops
---
That is a fair point.
---
Trident. Blowpipe. Occult. Ahrims. God D hide. God cape. Avas. Infinity boots and gloves if you can afford. Basically best in slot mage and range and you can increase your amount of switches as you get better at it. I'd start with 4 switches.
---
Just get void ez swaps

Yeah those exist and are a big problem but there's people in this thread who've gotten phishing emails immediately after verifying the email for a fresh account. There's clearly something more urgent going on here

Dab!

Same. I tried to get into my super old account from 2008 or so, and kept getting my password reset requests denied even though the info was right (I had it written down). When I typed in the same info and @ed support on twitter, my request suddenly got accepted. Hmmmmmmmm

u should get ahrim's pretty mage armor for around 4 million
---
I'm usually pretty forgiving re ezscape but I voted no for all that shit. We need to signal our intent - one of the reasons this game is so great is that things are HARD, sometimes boring, but in any case not spoonfed to us, not always about the easiest experience possible.

i played oldschool when it was actually old-school back in 2005,  i do in fact play osrs my con level is 90 and i dumped 110m into my crib not including leveling it.

I‚Äôm interested in what database was breached too. My main email (that I don‚Äôt use for RS) was compromised a few days ago, but google thwarted the hack attempt. haveibeenpwned came up with no info on leaks for that email.

https://emkei.cz/

Yes

Https://haveibeenpwned.com has the information surrounding all these leaks. The site was created by Troy Hunt, a celebrity security expert, with multiple computer and web security awards.

It‚Äôs a chrome plugin called ‚ÄòOSRS wiki search‚Äô. Dunno for firefox, but that‚Äôs all I know.
---
This proposed change is not being suggested to address gmaul. I apologise for framing my argument that way.
---
The way defence works, for those who aren't familiar is this:
---
Current visible level * (equip defensive bonus+ 64) = "Max roll"
---
Each time you are attacked, the game engine randomly generates a number between 1 and your max def roll. At the same time, the attacker has a number generated between 1 and their max roll calculated using their visible attack level and equip offensive bonus.
---
The higher of the two numbers determines the success of the hit.
---
When the hit is successful, the damage is calculated and applied.
---
Therefore, while the possibilities are slim, it is possible to kill from full hp provided you're able to roll 99 on your damage roll. Even if your opponent grinded out 200m def xp.
---
Damage soak is already present ingame. My argument is to have it applied to melee armor pieces to ENHANCE the value of the skill.
---
An ely averages 17.5% damage soak while justiciar offers this weird scaling damage soak (which I agree is fuckin dumb), but with 450 def bonus, offers 15% soak as per the wiki.
---
So absolute MAX damage soak in game should be somewhere around 30% with every other armor piece offering less damage reduction.
---
This perk would be entirely dependent on the armor worn, and there would be absolutely no damage soak native to leveling the skill.
---
When you can't see the votes its a zero-sum game...

Bruh ditch the Ahrims and wear Proselyte

abbysal dagger is better than zamy against anything other than metal dragons basically. But a whip is basically better than an abysal dagger 99% of the time
---
Gunna upvote this in the hopes a mod sees it. This is the toxic immaturity that needs to be addressed.
---
Hope they get punished for this bro
---
Saw this last night, I‚Äôm at GE w320 and had to come back to see if name checks out, same guy lol
---
Yes and I already addressed most of that. Social engineering wont figure out that Where were you born? Is answered with Jelly79=iguana. If you answered with the city listed on Facebook you might as well not have recovery questions. Database breaches won't reveal your password or email if they are unique to Jagex unless that breach is one of Jagex.
---
Locking an account from recovery in the rare case you stated is a very different discussion from bad security in the first place as it gives just as much power to hackers as it does to the account owners.
---
I've been on mobile so long I apparently forgot both of those were a thing. I just built a PC and installed runelite like 4 days ago but haven't played in like 2 weeks lol
---
The game isn't even hard it's just a massive time sink
---
They're probably using email spoofing.
---
Solo bandos, assuming you mean the mage method?
---
This reminds me of how when I was growing up I don't think I ever once heard anyone's parents, including mine, pronounce Pokemon correctly.
---
I'm at 207 dry at CoX atm. I'm hoping I can get a drop on 208 like the guy below, but might not return as ToB is just nicer to me.
---
Well the mobile version is basically a port of the PC client. there is functionally 0 difference between mobile and PC. It is not like mobile has pay to win options over PC.
---
As a 14 year veteran I literally started when I was still in primary school and now I have a bachelor's degree and a full time job. Mobile lets me find some time to play when in the train from and to work. Otherwise I would barely have time to play.
---
Seers is +12, no?
---
Slayer is really annoying at low levels
---
Hard pass.
---
"those gosh dang 'poky-mans'
---
Or have the matching slayer helm and shield :D which would show you put your time in at that boss.  Personally I think it‚Äôs a great addition for boss head uses, but everyone has their own opinions.
---
Anyone wanna buy a maxed out main?
---
What an asshole
---
So?
---
Boosts?
---
tried doing lava runes the other day and it was legit miserable. i just want to get to the level where i can do the abyss but the early grind is *so* bad
---
Agreed. Having the matching shield and cape would be supreme fashionscape
---
Hahaha, exactly. They would always pluralize it. Never really got why.
---
Dust devils don't have any magic defense, so the prayer bonus from proselyte armour will be more beneficial than the magic bonus from ahrims. What's your rationale for using ahrims?
---
LMFAO I always forget he didn't even get rank 1 for his efforts. That's pretty shitty.
---
I‚Äôm glad you like it! Thank you :)
---
If you want to find that one you'll have to dig deeper
---
 As a deep wilderness pker, this took me a quarter of a second. I can spot a spade from 10 miles and pick up the scent from over 25. Was this supposed to be a challenge? Fool, all you‚Äôve done is rekindle my thirst for virgin cluehunter blood. I am cumming.
---
I actually love the quest. It feels 'immersive' somehow. Being inside the Underground Pass and doing all of the stuff to the doll to defeat Iban.
---
How are they doing that? The only thing that questionable is the Underground Pass skip in Regicide. Nothing on the poll would make MEP2 a breeze.
---
&gt; cuts away your time thinking what you're going to do next at the Grand Exchange.
---
The best minigame in os is trolling
---
Yeah the hydra one turned out super juicy.  But I‚Äôm sure the art developers could make them all look supreme!

Muslims wear those too.

moving stuff around in your inventory doesnt interrupt attacks

or am i misunderstanding this post

The sad part is that there is someone out there saying that unironically

ironmemes 12 items instead of 50 for death tali

Its only fun if its a challenge

Is it really? Can you use mouse with left click?

No idea. Give me a minute and I‚Äôll test.

Thank you for sharing, this is gold haha

Now repost it in Meme format and rake in the upvotes. Memers don't have time to read.

im happy for him ,but I already see his baby‚Äôs mother poisoning the kids mind to hate the father.. I‚Äôve known plenty of people like her
---
You can pay for bonds
---
Even over vestment robes? More p pots plus ahrim repair costs for slightly more accuracy
---
Works for me with my corsair bluetooth mouse, still some delay but not very noticable!
---
Also was this in a blog anywhere or was it just thrown into a poll?
---
As much as i want to see alfie banned for being annoying as hell this in no way deserves a ban.
---
Make it so every section of the puzzle is separate by handholds with a higher fail rate than MEP2 and if you fall you fall down to a lower floor, resetting all your progress up top. Also at some point in the puzzle you crawling through a passage and ending up in the Elemental Workshop's closed section and you need to do all those puzzles on a time limit to get back. Then maybe one or two would complete it on the first day... or week...
---
Lol this nerd.
---
Finally!
---
Thanks man for the fast response:)
---
"Suck a Dick F@$$0!" LMAO GG
---
Just do 1 kill trip with BP. House tele, pool replenish and rinse and repeat. 
---
I dont bother killing if bgs specs are less than 50 combined. I will tele to pool and back again, no banking needed. 
---
It's faster in the long run I found.
---
I offered to tele someone to Camelot because I couldn‚Äôt trade them the runes, they told me to go fuck myself, so I have at least enjoyed the interactions I‚Äôve had due to the spell
---
learn grammar you uneducated fk. its "you're" like wow go back to middle school and educated yourself.
---
Torvester must know...
---
English is my 5th language
---
Not sure why we need a post about this guy every day
---
He's a cool dude but why
---
I wouldn't get your hopes up any time this year at least. If next year, it'll probably be late into the year.
---
Idk how people forget when you literally have to go to an ex-botting website(rsbuddy) to download osbuddy
---
They even share similar names. Rsbuddy was basically the bot that everybody and their mom could use back in the day. 
---
Compared to today  which is mostly private scripts or suicide scripts. Which is a huge difference in botting
---
Says a hardcore. Lmao
---
Thank you very much. You just saved me a couple bonds
---
All of a sudden... you stole his pet?
---
Even with the runelite+ rs3 is easier üòâ
---
HYPE
---
Avg
---
Botting takes all the fun and meaning out of the game. If you dont have the time to grind then maybe you should play something a bit more casual.
---
Bots are still around, saw a bunch in barb vill last night.
---
You know... this is a good point.
---
Can't wait for the rest of kourend to be updated! Hosidious was brilliant as well as Kebos. West really is best
---
Your welcome! :D
---
Takes me less than 5 minutes to navigate to the end of it. People just bitch about how jumping across the paths is RNG.
---
this confused the shit out of me when it happened, i knew something looked off, but i couldn‚Äôt figure out what
---
Olaf's was super easy, it's highly dependent on agility level.
---
Wow, where is minimum wage that low? Here it's around ‚Ç¨10, depending in which branche you work.
---
People get banned for saying that?! That‚Äôs ridiculous. I don‚Äôt understand how people can get so offended BY A WORD
---
&gt; But if it truly was hacked and botted the original owner should not be culpable.
---
This is what they do now, in many cases they've stated if they determine (as best they can) and believe the account was not utilized by the owner, they return it, unbanned. It's a fine line though I'm sure, trying to determine who's telling the truth and who's fabricating a story about "wow I got hacked" vs. "wow I paid a guy to bot my account and he got caught : ("
---
If you use the head and mount it, can you get the head back to use for a slayer helm? Or is the head destroyed on use
---
Doesnt help when the guy who said he's on waters banks their rune pouch before going into olm though &gt;:[
---
Yo mod ed, do literally anything except for this.
---
You described any OSRS streamers.
---
Skrillex, getter, illenium, San holo and alison wonderland KILLED IT
---
Agility part of MM2 wasn't that bad, inventory space isn't an issue like it is in MEP2
---
You cant use the abyss until the quest is completed. It's just that when people teleport out before switching back the mirror its hella oof.
---
Legit 0 of runelites client is python
---
Your assuming I didnt and not asking. Practice makes perfect and yes I did I watched three videos.
---
Low arching this guy gives max cash tho.
---
ur gonna pull a muscle reaching that far
---
Ya and we also still have consequences for freedom of speech.
---
You realize freedom of speech isnt unique to the u.s. right?
---
I hope you looked up a guie before trying it out because if not, you're part of the fucking problem and you're the brainlet in the bicycle meme
---
I learned this a year after typing in my password every time with all the uppercase letters lol
---
They don't even need to have a ToS saying it, freedom of speech isnt freedom from consequences of your speech.
---
The Dev Blog said it was for Runecrafting; I don't know anyone would runs through the temple for that. And if you do forget to swap the mirror back, you can just take the back entrance to the Death Altar from the Underground Pass but yah, forgetting to swap it back is not fun.
---
He was panicking over a 30 day ban
---
I dont think it will. Tbh I think part of the mentality is either "wasnt that bad; no" or  "it sucked ass but I did it, so they have to also."
---
You can try the tournement world while they're here.
---
These world don't use your account progress and you can setup your stats. So you can test all the bracket such as 1def pure, a 45def zerker and 70def and see wich one you prefer.
---
I think post 200m, the skiller pets have higher chance of obtaining them. (Not Phoenix because wintertodt counts as pvm)

I was gonna say ive never been lured but then i remembered wen i was in 3rd grade my friend lured me for addy long

Finally got it. Around 1.4k kills post rune defender. Man that‚Äôs seriously unlucky. My mate came along to troll me and got one in 13 drops.

Use SoL or SotD. Little more point and click but you do get the rune saving chance *and* 15% damage boost

High af staring at meme creator

Is this joke about Americans or jews?

I unlocked the first troll herb patch today and I'm only getting 3-4 herbs per seed, is this intended?
---
I didn't use compost the first 2 times and then I used a normal compost but still yields the same
---
I came from rs3(started 06) and transferred a good chunk over when i finally decided to play osrs.
---
What are your stats?
---
Is he a content creator?
---
&gt; At this point im convinced that the vast majority of people 
---
I don't know if it's a majority, but CS has posted stats many times and a HUGE portion of this is ACCOUNT SHARING/BUYING. If the account is not originally yours, no shit the original owner who was there at account creation may have a better chance of recovering. It doesn't matter if you played many many hours on it recently, if someone has strong details of the account's birth then it's probably rightfully there's and they'll likely get it back.
---
Sorry, but that doesn't make what I said untrue. Mith darts are extremely cheap and obviously OP isn't an ironman.
---
Oof, this hits home
---
^^^I ^^^went ^^^3 ^^^days ^^^straight ^^^this ^^^week
---
This happens to me everytime with my wife, when our connection is slow she always blame me for playing runescape on my phone and I don't even use wi-fi when playing (mobile data is more stable) lmao
---
That‚Äôs not even remotely their fault. Any connection for internet should be sufficient to handle EVERYONE in the house or you‚Äôre just a cheapo
---
It was a challenge the first time round in old rs2. In osrs I enjoyed it. I got super pumped when my path is literally straight forward over the floor traps! Greatest achievement. I voted no as well because I kinda do enjoy it while it lasts cause post regicide means RIP underground pass.
---
Well perhaps now he can get a job and a better personality
---
same here, makes no sense
---
Most items seem to be undergoing regular summer deflation. If you want to see real price murder by bots look into:
---
Iron ore
---
Ranarr seed and herbs
---
Cannonballs
---
Tbh im always fuming when i tell people im on a clue in wild and when I die they just respond 'gf'
---
Where was the fight man, that was an execution
---
416 prolly
---
But if you put all your gear in the bank, why does it matter if half of them are in wildy? Sure they're a bit slower than normal steps but it's not that slow.
---
Neither, it‚Äôs about the twat in the picture. Look him up, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love him.
---
Squinting his eyes. He doesn‚Äôt know what his hat is for
---
Yeah I agree, I put off doing regicide and the rest of the Elven quest line for a long time, but over the weekend I was pushing for qp cape and I did regicide through to mep2 in about 4 and a half hours with the wiki quick guide, I think my fastest time through the underground pass was about 4 minutes.
---
So now they simply code in a low life check and teleport to falador if they get low on life, wow what a change. You did it, out smarted them coders!
---
I don't think the EoC was the worst decision imaginable (it was still very poorly implemented), but I stopped playing RS3 because they removed all of the end-game challenges without a suitable replacement.
---
Enemies like GWD, Nomad, QBD, Nex, Dungeoneering bosses were relatively challenging for a majority of my time in RS2. Then one day, they literally just became pushovers, relegated to mid-tier content with the implementation of EoC. It wasn't that the abilities themselves made the bosses less of a challenge, their damage output and health just were transitioned so poorly that they died in seconds and there was no legitimate threat.
---
Sure, they would make elite versions/revamps/not care about dungeoneering bosses later, but the challenge was gone for long enough that I don't feel like going back.
---
I could live with some microtransactions, but not being able to tell what equipment a player was wearing was also a very jarring and immersion breaking change that I didn't like.
---
This
---
Because in marketing image is everything and advertisers don't want to be associated with people that use homophobic slurs, which makes perfect sense. 
---
Alfie knew the rules, broke them repeatedly, and got punished.
---
Lets just remove quests since this community hates anything that requires more than a single iota of brain power and wants things to be ezscape and idle slayer simulator 2019
---
Avernic is never useful unless you already have gotten all other upgrades you want. It's 100m for very small stat bump that you can never get back.
---
Nah it just means they are reducing to lower case before hashing. I'm sure it's still secured.
---
It's not their fault, it's the mums fault for not understanding bandwidth and looking for any excuse to blame a thing she hates (Vidya gamezzzz)
---
Was I right as far as the defence and hp level?
---
it's still misspelled in the poll question
---
Admittedly I was only like 10 at the time, I didn‚Äôt even do tears of guthix, just pranced around with my zamorak staff and book
---
I like the effort and detail you have gone into, but I like the system the way it is.
---
You can go 43000kc dry of a dragon warhammer or get a tbow on your first raid.
---
Runelite.net
---
Team zaros for the win
---
Because stopping a Slayer task to bank everything is a pain in the ass
---
It means they are converting the string to lower case before submitting it to the servers to compare their hash to yours. I very much doubt jagex stores as plain text in 2019.
---
The dev that lead it literally talked about how it was made for irons on the QnA stream, hes also biased because hes an iron main. 
---
Its not the only reason, but it is a reason. Other jmods have spoken how they have to cater to ironmen and it holds them back and it stresses them out.
---
In a while? Has to be worst for the last 5 years
---
Wholeheartedly disagree. If you were capable of doing demonic thrones pre 99 then it would be a joke on playing maximally efficient, even though thrones would be completely unviable.
---
It's like saying doing rune 2hs for 99 smithing, would that be genuinely at all funny?
---
Fuck, ya got me. Thanks!
---
I hadn‚Äôt seen this pasta before now and I just cackled on a full bus on the commute home after barely managing not to laugh at the video.  Fair play, you had me
---
Just go ahead and do the lumby elite for the staffless fairy rings üëåüèº
---
Appreciate the response :) I have a unique iron that is  restricted to tirannwn and my only hope of killing zulrah is green d'hide and ibans and I am yet to get a successful kill when testing it out with that gear. But I'm no pro at zulrah so I'm trying to get all of the rotations down and hoping once I get better at it, it'll be possible
---
is this the dude that wouldn't open his church to the public during a storm or some other natural disaster

I imagine 2k total worlds like the hipster Starbucks everyone is checking each other out but cant get caught looking.

Hello FBI, this post right here

W77 for the world and I would do barrows instead with hard tasks if that's an option would be better gp.
---
and get rekt by the mage hits in full melee gear? No thanks
---
If you reallllllly want the pet the best way of doing it is the draynor village stalls. I got Rocky by doing the Tzhaar creatures. They were extremely afk and I got the pet at ~23m xp.
---
Gl!
---
Haha salty? Dude I can do whatever I want... Eat me.
---
oh no you lost ghost speak amulet too??
---
This is incorrect. They also need access to your email.
---
One room is better because they can't escape, same thing with Nech's.
---
I just start a conversation, make it seem like I like the company. If they think it's a battle of stubbornness they might stick it out, so they can "win". But if they think I don't mind they'll just peel out.
---
Oh boy
---
The cops are comin for ya
---
Nice! So basically the idea is getting prerequiste quests, doing hourly runs, like birdhouse as you said and herb farming as someone else mentioned -&gt; filling the time between runs with other stuff, right? I would love more suggestions! thanks
---
Eoc doesn‚Äôt work with a 0.6 tick system, the abilities are way too clunky and unresponsive for a hotkey based combat system. 
---
The graphics remind me of a ps2 game trying to look modern but failing, like look at the disgusting player models and chatheads. 
---
Dungeoneering, summoning, and divination are far too rewarding for how easy they are to train. 
---
The xp rates are insanely high so nothing feels rewarding, I got a max cape on rs3 in 2016 and I felt less excitement than I do for a single 99 on osrs. For example, there‚Äôs a single quest that gives over 1 million xp into a skill of your choosing, like wtf? There‚Äôs also loads of other quests that give hundreds of thousands of xp. 
---
The bonus xp and dailies make the game feel like a chore more than a game meant to be fun, whereas with osrs it‚Äôs just pickup and play. 
---
I guess my main complaint is balancing. Everything either feels far too rewarding or completely unrewarding, leaving very little satisfaction and enjoyment for the player. This is what osrs does perfectly in my opinion. We have so many options for everything where we decide between fast and expensive, slow and cheap, high effort and rewarding, low effort and less rewarding. Everything on rs3 is just handed to you freely for very little effort or expense. No balance at all.
---
I like it at dks too.
---
Gz man got it at 67
---
You shouldn't be training on monsters with good defence tho
---
Instead of drug tests employers now have to check your phone and computers for any evidence of runescape.
---
I agree I haven't enjoyed skilling in a long time.  PVM is the way forward for the game new raids and slayer updates.  Also better and more unique skilling methods.  I think it is more difficult to do things on an ironman because it's more tedious and requires a lot more time. But RS isn't a skill based game so you can't really Flaunt the achievement of wasting time.  Everything in this game is a personal achievement but so many people get mad because they had to do something when it was harder.
---
when some one tries to get into merching

And all the permanent open doors in lumbridge. Just more ezscape

Used gfs cracked phone camera, sorry for quality
---
Yeah if you already have ahrims and 77 prayer. I know they're only one time purchases and useful in some other situations but overall vestment robes just seem more easily obtainable. I guess "worth it" depends on your wealth. I'd personally be broke after buying the rest of Ahrims and 7 more prayer levels
---
Using gfs cracked phone for picture instead of a second alt...xp waste

Stop being so mad, go back to looking at all that
