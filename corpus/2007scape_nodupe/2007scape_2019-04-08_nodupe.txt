Lol nice try. But yes, some of the most reliable gp in the game is through slayer. It's not even worth arguing about it's just a simple fact. Hence your downvotes.

Does nobody actually remember playing stealing creations? Because I do. If you weren't playing in a "non combat" stealing creation clan chat, which is how 75% of people played it since that gave more points, then almost every game became 1 team camping the other team at their base with ice barrage 5 minutes into the game. 
---
Stealing creation is atrociously balanced, both the rewards and the actual gameplay. 
---
Dh is probably your best bet. Either way it‚Äôs gonna take time
---
Maybe a dragon bucket helm as well? (With stats of D med instead of full)
---
That'll be my video. xD

Historically speaking maxed tanks have had 99 prayer (92 pray soul split is the same as 99 cb levels) I chose to do it again despite not having a level 92 prayer because no one my level fights me anyways, so 3 cb levels aren‚Äôt that bad; and I‚Äôm able to risk more without a fear of being smited (read: Elysian)
---
Obviously many people disagree and say 74-77 so that one is up to you.  In my opinion there‚Äôs no right or wrong answer.

Yeah, it's useful for F2P ironmen. But certainly not for members haha.
---
I started playing at age 8. I guess just monitor  what they say (I remember being incredibly toxic at that age) and tell them about account security, ie not going to websites outside of the main runescape website and the wiki. And to never trust people with their stuff. Scamming and hacking is still unfortunately around but you can take steps to avoid it. Enjoy!

It would be amazing if they made this worth while, with small chances at getting an item of loot a dually worth it.
---
People who use the word "problematic" are "problematic" 
---
Well of course that goes without saying.
---
Awesome! What's your in game name? Mine is: xSilentBrad
---
60 attack med with 75 def or if you are a welfare type of guy 65 attack for leaf bladed and stay 70 def is also good 
---
I just scrolled through 4 months of twitter posts and the only thing I saw even slightly out of the ordinary was RS3 posts
---
I guess you see it pretty often in ironmen going for every item simply becuase of how many total chests they do. 
---
Who cares
---
Honestly, starting my ironman F2P was a pain due to all the people/bots. Starting p2p with easy quests for xp and maybe WT at 10hp is what I did and was a blast.
---
Fair enough!
---
&gt; The forge could be amazing if it wasn't unnecessarily tolled while being garbage.
---
What do you mean "being garbage"? It's by far the closest furnace to a bank, and the toll is so minimal that if you can make 30K an hour, it's worth the price.
---
How long you gona be on for
---
I mean shards could be from other gwd drops but the hilt and acb in under 10kc is amazing
---
Thank you! We wanted to keep his character with green skin as that is how he looks in-game, but changed the hue to be slightly darker/blue-er so it wouldnt blend in with the kalphites too much :)
---
Its impossible to be level 126 without all 99 melees
---
That sounds awful, I honestly didn‚Äôt think anyone would want that
---
Probably the same waders he uses for duck hunting etc.
---
Plus some people like the aesthetic 
---
Why not remove the Duradel tele from Karamja gloves completely and add it to Slayer cape? That way relevant content = relevant rewards. Also it's a bit odd giving how huge Karamja is that the main perks of the gloves are limited to Shilo. I for one would absolutely love to see Kharazi Jungle tele. Just a thought
---
Geez
---
They don't have zero risk, they're risking their glory 
---

This guy also has posts saying to stop posting swampletics LOL
---
This is sick! And I just happened to the the kalphite princess. New wallpaper for sure. 
---
It's not accessible enough. Pardon but it's been a bit since I tested it, but there's a process going through the door, isn't there? And the bankers not being one-click-bank makes it slightly more inconvenient to use. It just loses against the Edgeville furnace. I never see anyone use the one in Shilo. If it was useful I feel people would use it.
---
Is Dragon Slayer 2 doable on a mid level Ironman without access to Brews? 75 Range, 70 Pray, 75 Def, 80 HP. Only have DS2 and MM2 left for quest cape. Confident I can do MM2 as I have done it before on my main (albeit with much higher stats.)
---
I would tbh since I‚Äôm a lazy fuck who hates holding my phone with 2 hands
---
Nope, the blue thing is what holds the line.  
---
This is just speculation, but probably the camera makes it look farther than it is, and he was shooting at a group of fish and got lucky. 
---
Okay now I know. I‚Äôve been seeing this guy in RuneScape highlight clips left and right and had no idea who he was and why he was being featured so much lol
---
Depending if his hp level is 90+ otherwise obby is better
---
Tbh if you pk at 110+ cb you have to risk like at least a mil minimum to compete with anyone else. If you're with a team you usually won't die very often but still.
---
God dammit ya beat me to it :(

I haven‚Äôt played in over a year and I have an Ironman without obby so I have no experience with that set up 
---
My main does but my pure doesn‚Äôt
---
It saves loads of time. It‚Äôs definitely worth getting your own
---
At high level slayer you can make very good money if you're lucky with drops/alchables. Killing bosses is another great way to make cash. Once you do Dragon Slayer II for example, you'll unlock vorkath as a boss and you can pretty much pay for your membership in only a few hours of killing him.

Um what? The new Clan chat was dope. It held 500 people instead of 100. It tracked kills+ deaths and had open api so you could literally see how many kills and deaths a clan had vs another clan in a fight. It also removed the need to wear team capes because u couldnt left click attack clanmates. Plus the clan cloak was customizable. Not to mention clan skilling highscores. 
---
It could be a flaw, but how else could we at least make magic viable for F2P?
---
very nice. any of ur other work viewable?
---
On some servers the whole world is player versus player (pvp), but on most servers the only place you can attack/be attacked by other players is The Wilderness, a large northern region of the map. Some PKers (player killers) go there to fight other PKers, but lots of people not interested in PVP go there too as there is lots of high reward content in the wilderness (or ‚Äòthe wildy‚Äô) - but if you go into the wilderness to do this content you run the risk of being killed by PKers.
---
World of Warcraft still gives the feeling of achievement. It's just the game is so different and PvM is really bad. The only fun thing in World of Warcraft is the PvP which is always an after thought for Blizzard.

Runescape is full of toxic players and we always fucking cry when we don't get what we want. More than any game in existence.

As a pker, this is important. I've had really "bad" people tank 3-4 of us at revs for over a minute simply because they whip out a dinhs. They won't switch prayers, just spam food and brews and we hit a dozen 0s in a row.

With that being said, I don't really complain about it because its just part of the game and we're killing pvmers after all.

Sorry man, but 99.99% they are not going to give items back. Best chance is preventing this is to change the machine you play on, change your email, update your Authenticator, change all your passwords, and change your bank pin every time you log out (in the official osrs client)

Wrong about the timeframe. The DDoSing at GWD was one of the main reasons they changed the death mechanics later. I remember a significant amount of ddosing for gear happening at gwd and other locations of course. I don't remember exactly when the hour timer was added but [this tweet](https://twitter.com/oldschoolrs/status/601499857019219969) and [this news post](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=135/temporary-death-mechanic-changes?oldschool=1) make me think it was may 21st 2015.

"Temporary" death mechanics btw.

Not really. It's an mmo. If everyone was an ironman it would just be an rpg and a very boring one. I don't like the idea of being forced to play unenjoyable content to get good items. I'd rather just play the game how I want.

in the past update for clue expansions (masters) i believe that opening a casket that you obtained the day before **would roll the new loot**. 
---
However, they are also adding stackable caskets so I feel that only stacked caskets can roll new loot while ‚Äòold‚Äô caskets will not. 
---
Holding onto a clue scroll the day before the update though? I see no reason why that wouldn‚Äôt roll new loot. It certainly can roll any news steps regardless. Personally, I am logging out on Wednesday with all 5 clue tiers nearly completed. 
---
I remember we would have like 10
---
Ppl with rune scimitarz trying to kill the thing but it would just heal constantly. If you managed to kill one, it was the best feeling

Definitely not. You have the choices with almost every other non combat skill.

All my quest progress and skills have been reset, which I'm not too mad about. In fact, searching my email I even got a message from Jagex:

Serious question, can you explain to me how you would get defence xp without hp xp? Pest control is locked behind 40cb, warriors guild requires atk and str, quest will only get you to around 40, and dfs requires already having 75 def. I mean you could quest and then lamp it, but that would be torture.

What hes saying is that there are only two viable ways to train runecrafting
---
He meant to say "Bis" instead of "His", as in best in slot. 
---
Lol this is legit the only way I train RC
---
1. Dont bother with f2p.
---
2. QUESTS
---
3. QUESTS
---
4. Diaries 
---
5. QUESTS.
---
&gt;no depth or paths to take
---
It's pretty on par with other skill xp rates up until around level 50, and after that sure it's slow but there's more diversity in training methods than most skills. RC is undeniably one of the most well designed skills in the game in terms of actual gameplay.

yes, basically to add more requirement [as there is basically none] to the guild... also help curve bot farms... and then it does also give the outfit alittle bit of a buff.

If you mean holding onto the first step (but not completing it): nothing, that's exactly what he should do and what the calculator assumes he does! The "session" starts with a Mort step already in his inventory, which he can get via normal play rather than in a huge grind session.

You can change your display name twice using a bond. Once to change your name, a second to free your name up for a new account.
---
After this, you can go to Jagex support and request an information deletion. This clears all your information off their servers, and frees your email to create another account.
---
You can now use the same email to make an account with the same name.
---
It takes a day or so for Jagex to reach out to you for the deletion, but I‚Äôve done it a couple of times and it‚Äôs never been more then that.

Seriously, what the fuck.

Or a third more likely option stop botting and leaving when you get banned hoping to come back on a few weeks or months and cry that you were hacked and it wasn't you

If they pop on Twitch looking to watch an osrs streamer, stop them. There are none that are kid friendly. And there is always a fake rerun going that has links to phishing (account stealing) sites. Which may also infect your computer. These fakes get banned but another pops up right away. Usually advertising a give-away or double xp code.

Noob here - what‚Äôs wrong/funny with Ahrims?
---
Sure there is, there is
---
* Abyss
---
* ZMI
---
* Lava runes
---
* Profit Combo runes.
---
* Arceus Library
---
Sure these are all quite similar. However there is a good range of intensity/profit variance available.

It‚Äôs not THAT bad. But warn them about the wilderness.

---
Yeah I tried it out and there were other people there and no one pkd so itt seems safe enough :) just won't bring all of my cosmic runes at once haha
---
I think it‚Äôs agility, mining, and woodcutting obstacles to get there. I never went there till I personally maxed, but I‚Äôve never seen anyone there who wasn‚Äôt maxed lol
---
Slayer is actually fun, RC is not.
---
Fuck, congrats. My RNG in this game is such shit. I'm jealous.
---
Nah if you wanna live you gotta get payed in dollars there, US dollars are very much used there now
---
The only time I find myself using my elite void is Vorkath and undead slayer assignments that don‚Äôt require a specific head slot item to be worn, like ankous. It is very useful for any non slayer PVM where it makes sense to sacrifice some defense for attack.
---
Mix hide and seek with mining xp. 
---
Depends on your preferred methods of making money (bossing, combat, skilling, dailies...). I'll list off a few common ways
---
* Using blast furnace to smelt steel/mith/addy/rune bars. Has a very very low entrance requirement (30 smithing) and can potentially make 400k+ per hour at those levels. Will take a significant chunk of your week play time to make a bond every time, but you'll get some smithing exp and you can get started right away (after knight's sword quest)
---
* Take the bossing route and rush zulrah/vorkath. Takes one of the longest requirements to get, but potentially gives you 2m+ per hour and is one of the least "boring" methods to grind for gp according to popular opinion. I personally can't stand to do it for long hours.
---
* Take the slayer route and cash in after the mid levels. Gargoyles (400k+, 75 slayer), skeletal wyverns (500k+, 72 slayer), brutal black dragons (800k+, 77 slayer), cerberus (2.5m+, 91 slayer) are all great money makers
---
* Runecraft. This one generally gets a lot of hate for being mindless and boring but I personally love it. It's chill enough to watch a movie on a second screen and you get reasonable exp (for this skill, at least) and GREAT money. Natures (350k+, 44 rc), double cosmics (500k+, 59 rc), double astrals (900k+, 82 rc), double nature (1.2m+, 91 rc), wrath (1.6m+, 95 rc) and double death (1.3m+, 99 rc) are all easy to grind for looong hours if you focus on something else and are among the chillest money making methods imo.
---
* Dailies include mainly rushing varrock elite for a free ~180k per day buying battlestaves. Other tiers also yield the benefit, though less per day. If done everyday it pays for a reasonable chunk of the bond by itself. You can also do herb runs for additional money, among other minor things like buying herb boxes and picking cactus spines
---
* Mining is a notable mention, with ok exp and profit (650k+, 45k+ exp at 61 mining) and scales well until 75 (800k+, ~55k+ exp) doing blast mining.
---
For more obscure methods, check out https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide
---
Just take some methods with grain of salt, as some (like growing saplings) aren't really sustainable in the long run.
---
Lolol. Got pkd at the end of my slayer task with 12 cannon balls, 3 lobsters, a range pot (1), and a dueling ring that I dropped. Came back to grab my cannon and the dude took everything, even my bones. Gotta feed the clan somehow
---
Are you mad you can't kill the pvmer? Lol could always move to a different pvmer. 
---
Sucks a lot right now, foods skyrocketing in price and electricity is even more shittier than usual
---
He's not banned now, he only got a 7 day ban.
---
The levels are too aesthetically similar so it's easy to forget which floor had the satchel and what not if you're not using a guide. The restart mechanic was frustrating if you got caught. Six charges in total was probably excessive, and the charges being ruined while caught was tediousness just for tediousness' sake.
---
And people like you are what I hate about the pvp community
---
I don‚Äôt think its used in DKS if u can access to barrows gear. 
---
But proselyte is kind of meta in Slayer, on ironman I use it very often.
---
There is a taste of hope that you will get quest cape
---
This is a repost
---
I didn‚Äôt even consider the slayer points. Managing them is fun as well.
---
He really, really like King Roland and hates seeing him unsatisfied with the royal shrubbery.

Except in the only screenshot / evidence present. I haven't seen pvmers being hostile towards pkers. Quite the opposite actually when I go skilling in wildy.

Diaries seem to lock so much shit for seemingly no good reason. It often feels arbitrary and forced.

My 2 cents, don't hate me, Diary-lovers of /r/2007scape. 
---
I also got a ring of life :( 
---
I have another spreadsheet that's up-to-date with weightings and do/block/skip etc, just wanted to find a convenient one-stop list of good locations to do stuff that I could use as a resource to edit my personal block list. Looks like I'm going to have to do the work myself then, thanks
---
There are a few key activities to do to get "passive" gp. This prevents you having to spend half your time grinding the next bond. List includes: 
---
* Varrock Diary Battlestaffs
---
* Managing Miscellania
---
* Herb runs
---
* Birdhouse runs
---
Work on getting those set up ASAP so you don't come to resent the bond grind. Until you have those, things like blast furnace, MLM, runecrafting will all be decent with your stats and should be less than 8 hours of grinding per fortnight 
---
Is Vorkath immune to damage while the your character is frozen? I have noticed that when attacking while setting up to use crumble undead or immediately after killing the zombie I always hit 0.
---
Whatever the song is that plays at the login screen. That shit is so iconic.

---
With all of the xp you can get from tears, fossils, randoms, quests, diaries you can pretty much 1-70+ RC without training it.
---
Agility is just like that sometimes.
---
I was doing Icthalarins Little Helper yesterday, and at one point you gotta agility hop this crevice, and if you fall you get tp'd to an earlier point. I'm pretty sure Slayermusiq had like 36 agility and only fell once, where as I took 2 attempts to jump it on every single pass except one.
---
The worst RNG is also getting the little hopping stones routes in the tunnels of MM2, as those seem to be relatively easy to fail simply due to an agility check rather than picking the wrong path.
---
I think the updated room looks WAY better, but the room before wasn't /terrible/ \*dogshit\* terrible it was just like a 3.5/10. Now it looks really pretty.

---
Very nice dude. I returned to OSRS about 2 years ago, and decided to take up the ironman challenge. I recommend you give it a shot once you've gotten the hang of things.
---
Mining runite ore in the wilderness, doing Shiloh village to do gem mining, smithing at the blast furnace (good exp, slow $), fishing lobsters, runecrafting mud runes using balloon transports between castle wars and earth altar, crafting nature runes through the abyss.
---
I've thought about this too. I've actually had some sessions where my eyes get physically sore - specifically when I was trying doing Tzhaar safespot on 9 different worlds. It was madness, but a lot of fun!
---
People talk about the coal bag a lot.
---
All it does is basically save you one trip from the sack to deposit box, right?
---
Not at all, a lot of the grinds in f2p are not even grinds for members. But its where you find fun at.

Great idea!

u/Mod_West feast your eyes on this beauty of an idea! 10/10 best quest idea ive seen in ages
---
PvP does suck this expansion, and has sucked since probably after WotLK.
---
It's really noticeable this time around because of all the class pruning. Everyone feels the same.
---
Not only that, it's become very reactionary. It's no longer about playing to win, it's playing not to lose. There are very few ways to outplay someone and you often rely on capitalising on mistakes to win.
---
An arena match is literally a script. He popped this so I'll pop this. It's just cool down swapping. This started to rear its head in MoP but it's so blatant now.

I think keeping the prayer bonus of proselyte while giving defence stats equal to rune would be better. It would be useful for situations where you don't quite want to use protect from melee or ranged but you still want the prayer bonus for piety.

Hey man, idk where else to post this. Do you suggest I post a thread here with my evidence? So I quit Rs back in 2015 or something not sure exact date, when I wanted to come back I was hacked and when I recovered my account I was permanently banned for botting. I appealed and the ban was removed. I quit again because my account was ruined, all cash gone and it was a pure turned main. Recently i wanted to play again and tried logging in and i was banned for botting on Oct 2018. I never logged in so idk the account activity but the password remained the same. Idk if i was hacked or i was banned again because the hacker previously botted. I have pics of this (me being unbanned from a permanent ban and banned again). Sorry for the long post hope u can help. Do u think there is a chance for them to unban me since I cant appeal? 
---
what is shopped? someone posted about how they got 3/4 pieces of dh in 1 chest, along with the kc loot recorder, the other day.
---
I can imagine, that's one of the reason's I was attracted to the game, as I saw that there were a lot of items and that there was so much depth in the game.
---
Ok thanks for the quick response. Will do that.
---
That was my original idea. Let the players who's statue it would be choose their own look too.

Lynx could make his have a max cape, swampletics would have his barrows gear or default outfit, etc.

I bet the client just doesn't update often enough. It just prints whatever number it last received. That doesn't mean the point counter is bugged.
---
The great thing is there is so much to do so unless you decide getting a 99 skill within your first week then you should be fine.
---
There will be aspects of the game that you will LOVE and aspects of the game that you will HATE. Sometimes the latter is required to progress so it‚Äôs up to you to manage the time you spend on them so you don‚Äôt end up burning out. For things that are more AFK I tend to watch movies/netflix. For things more intensive that I hate I tend to do a level a day until it‚Äôs done (or however much xp you can manage before you want to stop).
---
But on the back of all that, the vast majority of the game is so fun to play. I‚Äôm currently part of the clan chat ‚ÄúOSRSHelpme‚Äù which is a casual chat full of players willing to help new players. If you join that and explain you‚Äôre new, you‚Äôll get tons of help and have tons of fun!
---
That‚Äôs a poor amount of scales. I have that many in 490 kills. 
---
thanks :)
---
Not 1 kc. Definitely not the same.
---
You mention being AFK, what is the majority opinion of it? Is it widely considered cheating or not?
---
I mean you could probably profit like 500k per hour in skilling supplies along with some possible uniques and a pet. You could get like 70-90k xp per hour split between the skills and it would be a way to profit while training construction. Not to mention I imagine some people will find it fun.
---
best of luck friend. You'll get it
---
probably easier to start over tbh.
---
Damn that's some hot luck. I've gotten 8 berserker rings in 300 kills so I'm happy
---
When I say AFK I mean tasks you can do whilst not paying attention to the game too much e.g clicking every minute or so whilst doing other things like watching a movie. It makes the slower tasks much more enjoyable. There‚Äôs no rules to being AFK as long as you‚Äôre not using a macro to click for you.

Barrows gloves is a good goal, itll keep you busy questing a while, and any gear improvements you make now shorten your future combat levelling

But it isn‚Äôt. No surprises!

99 runecrafting

I actually like rc it's pretty fun. But yeah it is a pain in the ass sometimes. A bit too repetitive

What if I told you people post on reddit for a wide variety of reasons not limited to being upset?

Is this why I sometimes end up ultracomposting twice?  
---
As soon as I harvest a patch I always compost and try my best to make sure its done (I get distracted a lot) and then after I plant on a herb run I also do another compost to make sure I didn't fuck up and I swear to god that I am double composting some patches (bottomless bucket).

Yeah I just did mm2 about a week ago. I had I think 55 agility at the time? I didn‚Äôt fail an obstacle unless I got the little message in my chat box that the path didn‚Äôt feel right. I got that I believe 2 times. The platforms legit fucked me up though, I was super tired because I was doing a bunch of grinding before and it was late and failed a bunch and ended up running out of stam pots halfway through and no graceful. I think I failed like 10 times lmao.

Haha it was kind of a joke, but: Lumby = Lumbridge = the place where you start your journey. "Lumby goblins" are goblins that are next to the bridge between Lumbridge and Al-Kharid gate. It's a popular training place.

Should just go for ecu keys in case, so you do not waste supply on the potential dragon boots drops. I remember back in the days these boots were going for like 100k ish and we just left them on the floor to rot away. For 0,5m I would gladly redo my KC if I was there in your boots.

Hi Chey 
---
Precisely the type of person you'd expect there
---
It's pretty good experience and money but you have to click a lot. It's a good skill with good trade offs. Bad suggestion.
---
In theory you could always make money, by staking double the amount you lost in the stake before. Say you lose 1 m, you stake 2m in your next duel. if you lose that you stake 4m and so on, until you win. The chances of you losing multiple stakes that are 50/50 is so slim, that you should always be able to make a profit when following this rule.
---
But the nature of gambling and human behaviour makes it really hard to stay disciplined.
---
Bonds are ingame items that can be purchased for real world money then sold in the game or used for various things like changing name, or activating it for 14 days of membership. The price of 2 bonds is higher than buying 1 month of membership but it gives you the freedom to decide if you want to activate them or sell them on the ingame market. This is healthy for the game since you directly support the company with your money and the bond will end up being used on either of the offered services, if not in your hands then in other players that paid you the ingame money for it. Its a win-win for everyone.

If you use res you can filter out posts with specific words used in them

You could kill blue dragons or lava dragons with those stats, granting decent magic exp too.
---
Also get iban‚Äôs staff, hits very high.
---
Checks out to me. That's actually surprisingly common god damn. Didn't expect that.
---
You just....YOU CANT DO THAT...
---
Yeah.. I doubt that applies here. As your example below: Hydra compared to Big is over 700% increase in exp/h. That justifies its higher gp/exp price. Dag bones is only 13% increase compared to Hydra.

Do fruit trees and hardwoods and it's essentially free. I never touch normal trees and still pull like 400k exp per week

You shouldn't rely on this. Emails can be deleted by anyone that has access to it. Instead I would highly recommend checking the **recent login activity** of your registered email.

There were like 4-6 large teams (&gt;25 people) out at the same time during the weekend, for quite a long time, so revs were basically "closed" for some time. Weekends are often quite busy, if you want to farm try going during the week.

Last time I trained farming magics were like 14 gp/xp or something ridiculous. They're nice but if money is an issue you really shouldn't do them

Homie if there was a 5 min guide for BA you bet I'd watch it. But when I was going for the diary tasks, I looked it up and all I found was a series of videos that were ~10 min each on all of the separate roles. I just took a shot and figured it out enough to get my diary tasks done.

Yea don't know who this gryff guy is but he should be banned

Maybe bonds or something or merching - sometimes I buy bonds for construction supplies etc cause I'd rather spend a bit of cash that takes no time to get, than grind for hours that I don't have.

It‚Äôs not that bad. The big problems with konar so far as exp are things like spectres and dragons in the catacombs of kourend. Also nechs and dust devils when they are not assigned in the catacombs. I‚Äôve been on greater demon tasks where I‚Äôve gotten 4 keys before. Sometimes you get really lucky with them. Sure duradel is better for xp, but there isn‚Äôt a difference if you skip konar‚Äôs shitty tasks.
---
That‚Äôs amazing man! Is it possible to have more Han one colour per foil?
---
I recently had some leftover cash to get it last week as well. And I completely agree with you. Doesn't seem to be a massive boost but whatever, got it now.
---
Click accuracy doesn't translate? What?
---
Put on some metallic armor of your choice and tell me what you see.
---
The platebody looks sick to be honest
---
56 keys got me almost exactly 5.6m. You get pretty lucky with these!
---
Mhmm but i also skip duradels shitty tasks and with 6 blocks you can maintain points while only doing the good tasks that get you 40-60k slayer xp/h
---
First attempt huh? 
---
Looks great
---
This is actually a pretty good suggestion!

What's a quarantine? Like a shadow ban? They'd just make a secondary viewing account to check on the shadow ban and move on to the next as soon as it doesn't show up

Oh wow. You mythic raid and get a meaningless cutting edge achievement that is no different from the dozens before, and maybe another shitty mount recolor that you can't even use because you can't fly in the piece of shit game right now and the water strider is OP.

If you actually played the game at a high level you would understand that. Instead you're had stuck on opulence and want to be condescending on reddit.
---
I support all of these ideas, nothing wrong with QOL content like this!

I had a relatively easy time with them so I honestly completely forgot about the tunnels being bad for people in mm2. With icthlarin's helper I believe the pyramid gap has a lower failure rate with your run turned on, but that may just be superstition.

I'm slightly bothered that the altar isn't facing the portal.
---
That's true, but in any good team the healer should always be last to finish by quite a large margin waves 5+. You shouldn't feel bad about being last as healer. There's a reason why half of the job of collector/defender is just helping the healer (assuming lvl 5 team)
---
r/runescapegonewild

Also if someone is camping, just go out there in full tank gear with some food to grab it, or hop worlds to the spot you died and stand in the same area, then hop back.  Just make sure to remember what world you died on
---
Nice work
---
at this point i'd almost miss it. i don't wanna think about how many free furies, whips, berings etc i'd have donated to people around me from going afk or falling asleep during slayer tasks
---
So if there's 3 aggressive monsters and 4 people the fourth guy can't log if the monsters are under attack?
---
Most monsters respawn in over 10 seconds, you can log out in that time.
---
There's also places where aggro is permanent (like dks). You can still xlog there. 
---
Pvmers: crying pvp too hard to learn

Pvmers also: give us 3 jad inferno and raids 2

Just learn it, it‚Äôs not that hard 
---
If you have a 60m bank and spend 60m on rigour it is not an upgrade because you have no bank. If you have a 150m bank, rigour is absolutely worth purchasing. His "opinion" on it's usefulness isn't just incorrect. It's 100% factually the best upgrade for the gold and that's not about interpretation that's just a fact.

So until recently, I thought that tears of Guthix just gave rc xp, until I got fishing xp and realized it was in the lowest skill

Did revs. Was really fun and didnt get pked. Going to go again tonight since pkers sre waking up now.

Also still slaying to 99
---
No sound?
---
Why are you doing them instead of other mobs?
---
change your name
---
Did you just tell me the item is balanced because I uhhh.... "don't have to attack them"?
---
What a stupid thing to say. If that's your reply there's even more of an issue with it. No item should be THAT annoying/overpowered that it makes someone not want to attack you instantly.
---
Get lost kid.
---
Eh. If you didnt get the 1/512 drop itd be garbage like just about every drake task. 
---
It looks like complete shit
---
What does that have to do with this? I literally just said that your bank pin is remembered for the session and is an opt in, just as this would be.
---
Why should i change it? I have 2 factor auth.. People know my pw to my discord and other sites i use simple pws like cheese123 and stuff but i have never been hacked with any place that has 2 factor auth
---
Only thing that concerns me is it turning into a prayer flicking overhead prayer contest like last man standing.  Pking has never been about endurance its around k0s.  So if there able to make it around killing some 1 in the fight instead of who has the tankier account then sure.
---
Daaaamn, that robe looks amazing.
---
why would i? i have 2 factor auth i should be safe even if i tell people my pw
---
Interesting
---
Yeah and to add to phase 3, you should be on the right tile row then run towards them.  once youre on the other side, you will be good to attack him again.  
---
Sundays 7pm Eastern is Clan Wars night. It may not be Jagex-sanctioned, but it's been a thing for four years now. W302.
---
I do wish they would take your suggestion, though. Their announcement on the News feed and presence of even a single Jmod would breathe life back into minigames like Clan Wars and Fight Pits.
---
It's a shame, especially since Clan Wars is much more than just team deathmatch on OSRS - they have King of the Hill and Oddskull, too.

---
Are you also falling for such low bait?
---
yeah thats the best way to do it.  Just understand his max hit and dont eat elsewhere unless youre below the max threshhold.  With DHCB, max hit is 30 and then I account for a random ruby spec (If I haven't switched to diamonds yet) so I only eat if my health is below 33 or 30, depending on the bolts.  Also, try and 1 tick eat a food and drink a potion if you can whenever you need to.  Just eat right after spawn died or during poison.  Youve got the right idea
---
Thank you for your response! I didn‚Äôt know if it was just myself as so many fixes had been implemented, thank you, I‚Äôll be patient :)

While I normally did dragon slayer as a member doing it f2p is easy as well. You'll want to use melee with a rune scimitar or range with a bronze crossbow since that is the most powerful one f2p.
---
Armor would be of course anti dragonfire shield and adamant or better if you can afford it. Try using swordfish as food and bring an attack and strength potion if you are lower leveled.
---
Elvarg is more dangerous than a normal green dragon so be careful. Praying magic has no effect over the dragonforce shield like most dragons either so just dont panic and make sure you stay healed up. 
---
Another tip is to open the door to the karjama volcano so you can make it back within the hour you have to get your stuff if you die. Best of luck PM me any questions on here or Marzelfritz on osrs
---
Thanks, but used oakdice to swap. They use a site instead of a cc I found out

Green d hide
---
No support, waste of dev time. Item is useless and does not increase dps during pvm or pvp because helmets that increase max hit are far more superior, therefore this would be dead content and only obtained by ba enthusiasts which is a very small minority.

I like your effort and creativity though.

Wow you have a whole *one* screenshot of a pker being toxic first (because he said shit to me off-camera multiple times over several days but you don't see me crying about it on reddit.

How to trigger a whole community with one picture
---
&gt;	I was only half paying attention really
---
Trim the quest cape and then you complete the game.
---
I think you are missing the point that in most cases, you are not risking anything by dying while pvming, while you are always risking something in pvp.
---
The other point is if you have a normal account, you are going to get smashed every time by someone with the same combat level that has a specific build.
---
Finally, if you still had any interest in learning pking, the toxicity of the pking community will probably convince you that it's not worth learning.
---
Id rather account security and dont mind the inconvenience of having to move for roughly 15 seconds to a safe spot before hopping repeatedly.
---
It would be useful in learning raids, inferno, zulrah and also hybriding in wildy
---
I'm also in the same book, played on and off since 2007. Started an ironman back in August 2018 and have loved it. My main complaint with mains is that for any buyable skill you just find a money maker to get the cash, then buy everything you need and bankstand for however many hours til 99. Ironman makes me think a bit more efficiently and gives me goals to work towards. Something as small as getting a glory feels like an accomplishment. Still only like 1300 total on my ironman, but god am I having fun.
---
100kc in and woox walking kills me every time. I'll just continue to walk around the poison like a scrub.

yeah then there's 70-77 which is the true 90-99 for the skill...

Seriously after 77 you just casually do bloods and soul rune after 90 and you'll get 99 without even noticing it. 
---
Out of SHEER curiosity, not trying to be rude, have you ever been on this reddit before today?

Getting scammed in RuneScape at such an early age is a GOOD thing. It prevents them from giving money to Nigerian princes. I learned a lot about the economy and stock market way before I entered high school thanks to this game. 
---
Furthermore, I understand wanting to keep them away from profanity and whatnot but I promise, most of your 11 year olds friends cuss worse than what you find on osrs. Additionally, you won't always be there to protect them and you already aren't (when at school etc.). It's good for them to get into the mindset early that they are capable of handling their own problems but CAN ask you for help later. This includes finding entertainment. Within reason, I highly recommend letting them play what games they want. My parents certainly didn't play RuneScape back in the day with me and I want to say I started at around 11ish? And that was okay! It helped me develop a lot of real life skills and coping strategies that I otherwise wouldn't have gotten as easily. 
---
Unironically using kid? Woosh if i missed the joke, but I'm really not sure if you're serious or trying to parody the angry pker stereotype. 
---
Just in case, again, nothing's forcing you to attack people using a bulwark. When people use it they're not able to attack back, so it leaves you to act however you want - either leave them be, bring in freezes and a tb, or try and pk them solo at no risk to yourself.
---
Im sure it will, you plan on making steel bars, correct? 
---
99 RC

100000% agree with the first one, I render all my doors closed and put up with the extra time and clicks cause I can't fucking stand how houses look with just random ass holes in the walls

You get a little over twice as much gp doing abyss runs on deaths/cosmics

no. WT loot sucks regardless of your level. Just get your firemaking grind out of the way and dont waste the bank space hoarding crates.
---
Thank you very much for taking the time to post here =)

Actually, I DO see you crying about it on Reddit. 
---
is it cuz of some recent nerf?
---
Dream gear right there

Original to OSRS Sequel Gang

But title says Max spec sooo
---
I don't think I've ever had that happen while they were in my ears and connected to a device. Besides, any knot made on the middle of a piece of string that doesn't involve the ends intersecting would be trivial to unwind. At least from my understanding of knots.
---
Again, I'll take your word for it too. If this is something that happens to people, I guess I'll just have to consider myself lucky?
---
How many kills? 
---
Only as a casual lurker.
---
Kinda slowly getting back into RS so never really paid attention past the crab raves ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
idk i can go "rng edge pking and got 20-1" no skil for sure lul.
---
God I‚Äôm so happy this is real
---
Looked dogshit
---
Wow! You could buy, like, a whole full adamant helm with that!
---
They took that out
---
Yeah normally most of these suggestions don't fit into RS but honestly this one I really like
---
650 kills after the i got elite diary. Didn't do any plucking.
---
You can't 
---
Rip the 2%
---
I appreciate the work needed for an iron man account but would rather just breezily enjoy leveling up my main instead, and live vicariously through settled's channel
---
This mini games sucks, nty
---
to fool RNGesus
---
Literally pray melee or mage and afk lol
---
Not on a old system like that, it is in 2019 though.
---
Beautiful 
---
No, todt loot has always been completely irrelevant on a main anyway. It is only useful for low level irons. 
---
You have 1 factor now. 2 factor means password + app
---
I feel like the people who make ironman are ones with maxed or near-maxed main, so they've already done a lot of the mundane content in OSRS anyway. They don't mind doing countless hours of barbfishing, agility, etc. one more time. They focus on the feelings of accomplishment, and don't dwell on how aids it was to get there.
---
But most OSRS players don't have a max main or even have maxing as a realistic goal. They still hear about how great ironman mode is without realizing how sugarcoated the reality of the gamemode is by players who are somehow ok with doing agiltiy pyramid for 10 hours.
---
imagine wasting 4m on mongoloids
---
Uhh bro...? That's an elder maul... 
---
If the first half hour isnt fun to you, the gamemode probably isnt for you. The early game is INFINITELY more fun than the midgame grind.
---
so roughly how many mils would i get at minimum level compared to max level (talking about total net worth)
---
They should Nerf blowpipe tbh
---
This gonna be a stupid question but how do you find people to befriend in this game now? Got back into RS a month ago again and obviously no one I know plays anymore. Before it was just play and talk to those around but now it just seems like everyone is minmaxing to get maxed doing 3 ticking with public off.
---
Another good thing to note about karabwans is the spot doesn't move so it's click and forget I didn't even think about cooking cooking sharks is good too if u don't burn them

---
if you want a short defender guide check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeuHY6Vmn1A) out. 3 minutes total, but only the first minute or so is really important.  
---
It shows Shir's placements for food and can be done the same way every time for waves 1-9. It's short enough people can watch in-between a wave. It'll get you started.
---
Untrimmed prayer cape is so much better for fashionscaoev
---
In terms of goals, finishing different Hard Diaries (e.g. Varrock Hard) is a good goal, as it gets your base stats up and offers nice rewards which are helpful going forward.
---
In terms of money making, the other comment has mentioned the best ones, but it largely depends on what goals you want to go for. There are some other high (but not elite) level moneymakers which shouldn't require too many stats (e.g. Barrows with Morytania Hard).
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
If you see these, report them immediately.
---
oof got me
---
Holy shit this is so cool
---
Now swords? 
---
1:27 is pretty fast. Did you see any difference in your average time? My best was 1:56 with blowpipe and eagle eye, but on average it took around 2:30 or so.
---
That's pretty dope. What's the process behind it?
---
This is one of the best things to ever be suggested on this subreddit. Brilliant idea, I love it.

Very cool, but now I'm annoyed that my smartphone can't have a moving wallpaper (to my feeble knowledge.)

I remember back in the day it was a struggle for everyone to survive the higher waves

Now with 2 attackers using range you don't need to heal anyone really. ~15 minute 1-10 wave runs. I enjoyed several of the teams I was on... And some others made me want to bash my head in.

Something about "kill 100 creatures because I said so" doesn't seem wildly exciting

While I loved the original game before Grand Exchange, the modern version of Old School needed it. With modern technologies and the amount of programmers playing the game, a third party alternative would have surfaced and slowly killed the original way of trading. 
---
Zybez was just a quick scratch on the surface of possible trading platforms. Imagine a trading platform being developed with manpower and talent equal to OSBuddy and RuneLite. The more the platform would have developed, the less real trade would have been going on. Eventually the community would have become so accustomed to the platform that Jagex might have has to bend rules, because the community wanted a smooth trading experience (trading bots etc.). It‚Äôs a bit of a stretch, but ‚Äùlocal trading‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work in most modern games. It‚Äôs good to have Jagex controlling the economy. [spoiler]It also would be good to have Jagex controlling the game client[/spoiler]

I hope this gets into the game, your post is incredibly detailed

---
I only did ~ lvl 80 FM WT for the first ~200k gp or so. The most fun I have had so far on my (~1950 total) account was just doing all of the quests. I left MEP2  , MM2 and DS2 for later into my account but doing every other quest was good fun and unlocked the game for me. Even when I finished all of those quests and was like ~1400 total (?) I would still consider myself early game.

So I'm going for quest cape and I have 14 quests to go. They include DS2 and MM2. Should I grind those out first for easy sailing? I've got all the requirements for them. Also have both Mournings Ends to do as well. Playing on mobile if that changes anything. 
---
I love this
---
I‚Äôd bank mine when pickpocketing HAM members on my ironmen for free smithing XP as well as GP from alching the plates.
---
Yeah and tbh it's never my actual money, it's mainly tip money that I cash in maybe once a month or something and buy myself some bonds and some new socks or something haha :D 
---
I made 6M whilst getting 99 cooking.
---
When using the cooking gaunlets (from the family crest quest - easy) and the hosidius range, sharks stop burning at level 89.
---
I think I cooked 39,000 sharks 89-99 and netted around 6M profit.
---
First 99 and I got a decent amount of profit so that I can buy a blowpipe and give jad a go.
---
I don't disagree. 
---
__It‚Äôs mesmerizing.__
---
I agree, I've always wanted to learn how to pk but I step into wildy or anything and just get smacked and then go back to my main. There is a definite skill gap with pking and I think an ELO system would prove popular if its done right.
---
Mobile + afk Vs maxed main + effort
---
Can you trim my rune plate pls
---
To maximize points, you want to have as many easily killable bosses selected as you can. Some of the harder ones, like these desert treasure bosses, give a flat boost percentage of points gained by the other bosses. I think having the DT boys gives 8% more points overall? Its not afk but you can get like 1m points an hour that method
---
That's pretty fucked.
---
Is there any chance you DCd and automatically world hopped?
---
Well, I looked back at the picture and figured out exactly why it happened, so it isn't so much r/blackmagicfuckery as it is an inconvenient result of humans being terrible at grasping "consequences" lol.
---
ever heard of NHing?
---
Needs 99 rc as a reward
---
Right? Everyone thinks it's "oh they're mad they got killed in the wilderness".
---
Nope, it's just because most of the community are toxic pieces of shit. 
---
Given the fact that the King gives entirely zero shits about you throughout the quest, this would be a good way to have this quest unfold
---
Swampletics Lite
---
\*headbutts\*
---
i used prop swap. just make sure you only talk with ranked users
---
My average isn‚Äôt significantly better either though.
---
Out of interest, do you still use blowpipe? 
---
How u gunna type this all out when u could have done the math in literally 1/10th the time 
---
I thought rs3 still has more devs, but the OSRS team has been growing for several years. 
---
But yeah I don‚Äôt play WoW, although I always enjoyed it and games like it, sucks to see that game failing. If they do wow classic wrong, that will be really sad. 
---
There are adblockers for mobile.
---
Main reason I could never do ironman is how aids getting quest items is
---
Why didn't you pluck
---
So you had zero downtime where plucking would've been you're only option?
---
Which rotation if i may ask?
---
Shut it Rajee
---
bp should be nerfed
---
Huge support, I really want to pk but I just get shit on every time I go wildy
---
He also forgot to add in 77 Bloods. Smh.
---
I mean it is a gathering skill. Of which there are plenty that have very ago methods. I obviously don‚Äôt want anything like runespan but there should be more afk methods that only give xp but no money
---
Bludgeon
---
Double hit luring is super hard tho, they never seem to walk where I want em to.
---
To be fair I think KQ is fairly profitable on task nowadays. But I understand that grinding it out for 100 or more kills sucks without the diary. The agility requirement is already really high. 
---
When I go I use bandos, I tried void and just got shit on, i take avernic,bandos then ext super fire +pray mage. 
---
You should sell dhcb for lance

You should aim to only sip your brews right on the 15s interval so you always stay 120 stats

This is straight up false information

No I think he said he wasn't going to fuck with that again until after he had a whip. He's got a green cape now.

Fist of Guthix...

Mate... Ironmen who could trade with each other would just be a normal account lol.... hope you're joking
---
Change name to "1kc rex btw"
---
You could look into AFK fishing and getting 80 for infernal eels (if you have a firecape to access the area)
---
It's around 250-300k an hour and you never need to bank
---
Now we just gotta wait until jagex hires more engine devs.
---
Winter 2020 anyone? 
---
No one said there has to be an instance where you have to be able to tell the difference, but i can and many other can with ease so i dont see the need for your long winded reply.
---
So no to "in one transfer" but yes to get them all onto one final art piece?
---
Clinic locked ultimate ironwife btw
---
A few problems with that:
---
\- FFA portal doesn't have nearly as many players as the old PVP minigames, and a good chunk of them are max accounts in max gear/dh trying to 1 hit you.
---
\- You have to use your own supplies at Clan Wars, and since there's NO REWARDS players aren't incentivized to participate.
---
Mehh
---
70 rc checks out
---
I see your point but I think an elo based pvp minigame would be really fun for the experienced pkers too. I think it could help resurge pvp if there were rewards kinda like they do in WoW, special gear/titles (maybe not a title, we don't want to turn into rs3 here) but maybe badges next to your name similar to Ironman that show your elo or something! Hardcore pkers are obviously highly competitive and I think they would like something like this to prove their skill and show off to others.
---
Yea but reaction time sure as hell matters and a top FPS player probably has a better reaction time than 99% of the player base.
---
Why did you push an update to the App Store specifically saying this issue was fixed when it wasn‚Äôt? Who does your testing? It seems to be quite a common occurrence updates get implemented with little to no testing. It‚Äôs frustrating for us when you tell us something is fixed and it‚Äôs not or you implement a new update that doesn‚Äôt work properly. 
---
I do zulrah /vorkath  and also PvP on mobile. So mobile isn‚Äôt a excuse. I actually think pking is easier on mobile. 
---
I really don‚Äôt think stealing creation and soul wars would do anything to revitalize pking, if anything, the opposite.
---
I understand that, but separating HCIM and Ironmen by just dying is dumb. *Only* being able to trade other ironmen in the traditional fashion would be a better separation from HCIM. 
---
I wish...
---
Aren‚Äôt they already doing this?
---
You literally have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. For raids 1/2 and ToB its extremely helpful, and you don‚Äôt even need to buy it, just check DPS charts and see that you‚Äôre spewing false info. Maybe your vorkath PB isn‚Äôt changing, but that‚Äôs anecdotal and doesn‚Äôt really matter. Don‚Äôt make posts like this if you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
The Venezuelans are gonna be so hyped over this.
---
But on the real, I‚Äôm not Venezuelan and this is badass.

But that doesnt mean they are shit xp. Can you guys not read.

Lol people genuinely think others care about their own achievements or something
---
The thing is, what exactly would you bind to what keys? If you're wanting a switch like setup there are phones that take controllers and look essentially like a mini nin-switch. Could I guess bind the 4 keys to like inventory, prayer, magic, and equipment tabs or something. Using the joystick to move would be like binding up to the top of minimal, left to the left, etc to walk but still wouldn't give a smooth aerial pan. Also would still require screen tapping to click items and such. 
---
Exactly, someone gets it 
---
It's hard to say what kind of an immediate effect re-introducing the PVP minigames might have on the wildy, having a larger percentage of your player base actively involved in *some* form of PVP is certainly better than what we have now. 
---
So you‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre legit now right?
---
Why is there a night elf Druid in Runescape
---
I hate it

Last time this was posted he had a nezzy on and the gavel was an elder maul. I liked that one better

The guy you responded to didnt say it was shit xp, he said it was shit xp/gp.

There are other ad providers outside of Google.

Call the quest "Statue of Limitations"
---
I miss duel tournaments.

That's the thing though.  I don't bot,  and I haven't since I played ACTUAL 2007 runescape back in Jr high.  And when I click the link to see evidence of my ban,  I get the auto-generated message that "weve been monitoring your account and noticed behavior yada yada yada"
---
&gt;no, i streamed a majority of my attempts, even the one where i got cape
---
You need to do quests to unlock cave horrors so right now I doubt you will get those.
---
Who said the value would go to 100gp? Everyone knows that the price is tied to alch value (and alch value of elemental staffs). The thread is saying why is the price higher than the discounted price of 7k. Not why is the price higher than 100gp.
---
Doesn‚Äôt King Roald have dialogue he shouts in Nightmare Zone about the statues?
---
Lil Nas X song who he recently remixed with Billy Ray Cyrus, it‚Äôs a good song
---
Yeah they're neat, you said you have a store for purchasing? :)
---
I'd pass on bow strings rn, the price of bow strings is suuupperr low at the moment. Tele tabs is definitely more like 300k/hr in my experience too, plus gives xp in magic which is really nice. Air orbs could be good too though! 
---
pretty crazy that most people don't have max in goal yet there are already over 6000 people maxed, insane.
---
Lol for high end PVM, rigor is huge. The defense + damage boost makes it really useful for things like CoX and ToB, which a lot of people do, and the people who heavily advocate for rigor are mostly people who do these. Again, you‚Äôre only doing it at bosses where it doesn‚Äôt matter that much because you‚Äôre using max gear and probably always potted to 113. It‚Äôs pretty garbage for slayer and bosses like zulrah and vork, but I‚Äôm more than willing to do the math once I have the time (on mobile rn) and will post back if you went.
---
my favourite part of the game and i'm getting close, other than that i think i will quit until there will be more quests :(
---
Which quest would that be?
---
Had to freaking mute my phone to make sure dancing crab didn't suddenly come up.
---
I do! They are available at: oneholyrobot.etsy.com

---
Agree with you on this - I know when you crunch the numbers it is worth it, but I hardly notice a difference either. I was expecting my Vorkath times to improve dramatically, but I haven't even beaten my personal best in 100 kills since I got rigour haha.
---
It is something you were going to get anyways, so don't feel bad about it. The small gains it provides will add up over time, regardless of if you notice it or not (you probably wont!)
---
Well rip me.
---
I would say no to buffing. Can be botted easily. Although I wouldn‚Äôt mind it as a item sink/gold sink overall.
---
For best progression of your account? Quest, quest, and quest some more.
---
For making your next bond? I'd look into the blast furnace or hunter (Hunter doesn't start really profiting til 63+...  But it's the best SKILL for moneymaking. End-game PvM still blows it away, but since that's pretty far out of your reach even if you were to no-life it for 2 weeks training... Skilling via the blast furnace (Less time spent training, but slower money) or hunting (More time spent training, but better money once you reach target levels) would let you buy a bond much quicker.
---
Also, get fossil island + some quests that give farming xp out of the way. Birdhouse + Herb runs can maintain a bond easily, and take less than 10 minutes every hour and a half or so.
---
Where‚Äôs the fact?
---
Play the game
---
Are you going to Jagex
---
So.. what about your spades 
---
Lmao. 
---

---
Some quests unlock bad tasks, like Lunar Diplomacy unlocks Suqahs, Roving Elves or Regicide (can't remember) unlocks elves. IMO these are bad for money and/or xp. You'll need to do desert treasure to unlock dust devils, I believe. Fremenik Isles unlocks a new troll location that is better for tasks than the troll stronghold location.
---
This was very helpful thank you! I don't have a fire cape yet but do have bgloves. My current set up is neitz helm or slayer helm but i don't have it imbued yet. I use full obsidian with obby Cape glory dboots rune defender. I used over 3k tickets dry on dragon defender. 
---
Events like stars and evil trees really increased the sense of community in rs2. Would be a great way to break the grind while not losing xp. 
---
He yells about hating the garden I think. Can‚Äôt remember anything about the statues off the top of my head but he might
---
Augury is actually pretty shit compared to Rigour and Piety, fyi
---
So if supply increased the price would drop (but not below the alch - Nat amount which is half the current price). That still has those scary real world economics laws but we have a bit of other stuff to add in because there are other constraints. 
---
Does that make sense to you? Supply would cause the price to drop. Thanks for agreeing with me.
---
You also need be pretty reputable so people can trust you with BiS gear such as twisted bow
---
Try shots lmao
---
Thank you for a reasonable response aha genuinely appreciate it.
---
Just to systematically comment on your points:
---
You have to less the increase from eagle eye to get a fair assessment on the bonus, so it‚Äôs +5% accuracy, 8% damage and 10% defence (you can use steel skin for +15%), but without a shadow of a doubt, it‚Äôs an upgrade, I still very much believe it‚Äôs not as ‚Äòvital‚Äô as people make out 
---
Completely agree re PB, wrong to me to take the one off, but since, I‚Äôve done the maths on Vorkath DPS and it‚Äôs maybe 1 extra kill an hour, even if it‚Äôs 2, which I‚Äôm not sure it is at all, that‚Äôs 200hours to make it back, if you are the average player, who plays only a few hours a week, it‚Äôs just not worth it in my opinion 
---
My bank isn‚Äôt bad, mostly limited on Raids because all my friends have quit and Just don‚Äôt really have a team, hours at work are easing off though so going to be looking at finding and joining a raids team soon :) I look forward to trying it their as it does seem to make an impact... however, just to query, to gain the extra points, are you theoretically taking away from someone else? If so, is it the same net points? In which case, I would always split the cash regardless so individual points aren‚Äôt as important to me, in the past, when I had much much less wealth, I would pool money with my buddy so he could get the BiS to help the team.
---
I‚Äôm at 99 range already, but fair comment all the same :) 
---
Lastly, I don‚Äôt think top Pvm clan requirements are anything to go by, by virtue of wanting the elite, the BiS will always be the min requirement, no matter how impactful it really is, they want to set records and money isn‚Äôt as much of an objective for them, my post is aimed at the average player who will never qualify for a top pvm clan 
---
But tanks for all the advice, genuinely, I appreciate your time and not just throwing down hate, I‚Äôll 100% keep using it maybe I‚Äôll change my mind :) 
---
I appreciate the compliment, and am so glad you love my painting, but please let's not put down other artists' work :)
---
I have a lot of other OSRS paintings to post and am working on more now! I hope you enjoy those too! &lt;3
---
Yeah. The ‚ÄûI sleep/real shit‚Äú would be 10 times better meme for this
---
Thanks!
---
100% should have been a minigame from the start I‚Äôve literally had people disagree with me when I‚Äôve said it and have no idea how anyone could think otherwise

Pretty hard for that person, apparently.

---
Use the forum for this.
---
No, that‚Äôs intended. If you‚Äôre reference what settled is doing, you‚Äôll notice he need all 3 clues at the same time to be able to complete it. This means that the steps are tracked for all currently spawned clues, but once you drop it and it disappears you lose all the step progress on it
---
Right and the questiom was how do i get faster kills, in which you just admitted yourself tbow is crucial for. Turn on brain before make comment
---
I doubt you would be able to make enough GP without a coal bag to get another bond. 
---
It's not likely someone will do it first try. It's very unlikely, in fact.
---
Ummmm.... https://youtu.be/oesOC7JvcwQ
---
Wow really has turned to absolute dogshite though.
---
True, but very few people use them. RS3 is about being progressive instead of overconservative
---
Jagex jagex jagex?
---
Get slayer up. Either BBD, Gargs or wyverns 
---
Eh, you might be surprised. If they can make it interesting enough, it'll pass. And I doubt they will poll it until they think they have a compelling skill to show off. Despite it being old school rs, people want new content.
---
Just pay the $11. Annoying to sustain a bond at lower levels.
---
I don't have info and sources on hand, no. Majority of what I say comes from stuff thats been read in passing over a long period of time. I dont document my readings incase I have someone ask for sources at some point. Why would you think osrs takes less time and effort? Seems more of an assumption than anything. It's pert near impossible to find sources on specifically how many devs jag has and who specifically works on what? I personally judge it on update frequency as well as how many names are at the bottom of each dev blog(osrs and rs3) but its hard to tell from a company whos "Online players" on their rs3 website and on their osrs website mean very different things. So statistics and citations are more or less whatever Jag wants you to see
---
-1/-1
---
yeah you have to actually be pathetic to brag about something you never did. Even if others wouldn't know. 
---
YouTube doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about anything lol
---
People are saying stuff like:  
---
"Because the demand is higher than the supply". 
---
" 
---
Because most high level players don‚Äôt bother with it.
---
Keeps supply low and demand high."
---
Unlike the real world where the over availability of Supply would make prices crash, in Runescape it will not because of an aritficial gold value that is not affected by supply and demand.
---
You're a special kind of special arnt you.
---
Now make a crab foil transfer
---
No shit Sherlock. I meant any tips on quests to get out the way early, advice on if I should do anything first that'll make it easier

But what about the people who like what I dislike? They're the true brainlets!

Dont bother anymore, not till you plan to do tob/plan to do a really large number of vorkath kills/plan to chin a lot of xp

Supply is not what drives the price of the item. Alchemy value is. Supply controls the price of T bows, not rune plate bodies. Even with an infinte amount of plate bodies in the game their price would remain the same. 
---
Oh it should be super easy then. Definitely support! If anything to keep pets/Butler from roaming around
---
Skip tasks in deep wilderness (30+) &amp; high levels monsters. The lower the level the better. If you want to just train slayer skill, wildy slayer is probably the worst way to do it. Just do the highest slayer master you can unless you‚Äôre going after points.

good choice, they are cute af
---
Basically how metas begin to form due to what's optimal which opens the room for teams to counter it. Example, someone on ancients with range switch. Some one focusing on alternative range damage and melee switches, etc.
---
I've always wished a "support" role was beneficial. Someone one lunars whose casting vengeance other, heal other and spec transfers. Shame it's not that useful in game right now.
---
In the theory of supply and demand there can never be a price floor. In Runescape it can. 
---
Because of Alchemy and experiance goals for people. No one in real life gains anything for combining two items, in Runescape you get the XP. Then you can alch the item for free/profit and even more XP.  The demand for the item itself does not exist (at least to the point where it affects the price), unlike with say a T Bow. Experiance is as crucial to the existance of Runescape as air is to the existance of humanity, so don't dissmiss it.

I really super don't like the new elf models in this game. It feels like what an elf redesign would have looked like in 2011, not like what an elf expansion would have looked like in 2007. Like the new troll quest they did, I am disappointed that new npcs of existing races are going to have drastically different models because "artists vision". I would much rather they kept the original elves and did smaller variations like clothes or other unique physical traits traits.

Any recommendations for what quests to start with?

Tremble, liberal, as this man is about to stack you out

I think technically everything that happened before 2007, is also part of OSRS history.
---
At low level grinds, you can try crafting Gold rings, Gold necklaces, Gold amulet (u), using the Edgeville furnace. Smelting Silver Ores into Silver bars is also ok at lower levels.
---
The quest thing is what is stopping me. I hated getting that cocktail for monkey madness when the quest came out and I am sure as hell not walking there while the GE exists
---
Wtf are you talking about lmfao. Price floors can't exist? Why do price floors exist in the real world? Why can't we consider these types of things when talking about prices in a game when we talk about these types of things when talking about prices IRL?
---
No one gains anything from combining two things? So you can never add value from creating something IRL? You don't think demand impacts prices that aren't at alch value except for things like T Bows? Jesus Christ man. Your trolling is bad.
---
Why because I don't find a phrase that's way overused to the point of just being a chore to see funny? Ok then.

I shouldn't splash 4 times against someone with torags top and legs, bulwark and protect mage, to the point where they get gap and escape. Rhats the point I'm trying to make, mage Is wildly inaccurate without spending 5m+ on gear

We are talking about WoW and Vanilla WoW. OSRS and RS3 is the obvious comparison. ToB and Inferno came after RS3 and the existance of RS3 is directly responsible for them.

\&gt; 
---
Retail wow is literally in the worst spot it's ever been in it's history.
---
Because of trashy transmog farmer and pet lovers. I am glad they are gone from the game. But yeah I won't fight the existance of vanilla, if people want to play it go ahead. It's just sad when people cry about how the game used to be so much harder back then, like bro..farming stuff to be able to use poision as rogue was not better content than Uldir.

\&gt;  Why do price floors exist in the real world?  
---
They do not. How much would an iphone be worth if every person got 100000 of them tomorrow magically? Nothing. How much would a rune plate be worth if everyone got 100000 of them tomorrow? Roughly the same. 
---
How about you stop trying to make it much more complicated than it is.
---

mage is hilariously strong with max. you can autocast people to death through mage pray and 10 brews because of how much % dmg you get.
---
Strange. I know i 100% have had to put mine in after closing and reopening the client.
---
Cc deliveritems is your best bet.. might have to pay but other than that it‚Äôs another trip
---
I say do Maple trees for that reason, easy to access still (not quite as easy as willow but still a bank at the trees so eh) and I almost never see anyone at them.
---
Quick question - I see people using tool leprechaun all the time, how does this work? also, do you have a comprehensive list of all farming tools?
---
Yeah i know, the way the game mode should be played. Smh casuals.
---
Interesting; I do like this as an alternative.
---
Ouch
---
Hey where do I order one?  I've been desperately trying to get an untrimmed Woodcut cape made (and perhaps I could convince you to leave off the pin back and instead add a top-loop for a keychain??)
---
gg that was me :)
---
mini quests yeah obviously, achievement diaries are pointless grinds mostly in my book
---
Use the EGO system instead of a ELO system and we gucci faM
---
I think it also depends on number of people in the world (if that's still active). The more people, the more logs. Just like how mining rocks respawned faster with more people in the world until it updated. But if you aren't making friends, runescape sort of sucks so the extra people aren't all bad
---

Just bought a T7, things went smoothly. Thanks for the rune pouch! :)

Quest quest quest. Best way to level an early game account.
---
I'm iron and the severe lack of dragon pickaxes in your loot is scaring me.  One is not enough!
---
Try right-clicking Diango and selecting the "Holiday-items" and see if it might be there, otherwise I have no idea.
---
Are you surprised? Politically, this community is a cesspool, lmao
---
You have my support governor
---
I really super don‚Äôt think the art style in 2007 was universally good or aesthetically pleasing. The old troll models are pretty janky looking and the new ones keep it similar, but not so do different that it‚Äôs cartoonish like in RS3. I think a refresh on the design while keeping it still old school with former elements incorporated is much more favorable for a game that has been around long past 2007.
---
If you are only training Slayer then it's fine to have your gear be all your bank, you can always resell it anyway
---
Oh yeah sure, I wouldnt check how much they make in 14hrs and I'd compare it to 24 hrs LOL. Yeah sure.
---
Btw idk if you can read, but I've never said Jagex never worked against bots. I'm just saying there are bots and make the game cancerous.
---
&gt;120 days of wasted time seeing as you have no knowledge to show for it.
---
Who knows? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
&gt;You obviously lack any knowledge of the game or how it works. 
---
Yeah sure I do
---
Pretty sure seer is better xp than werewolf though
---
Swap worlds
---
AFAIK, each log has a % chance to make the tree fall. I'm not sure if there is a max number assigned to this.
---
However, training on the emptiest server being optimal... Not quite. Fairly certain (At least, I know this is how it used to be) that the time it takes trees to respawn isn't set in stone. It varies based on how populated the server is (More people on that world = faster respawn times, less people = slower). So altho ideally you'd be the only one cutting logs in that location, you'd be better off on a high population world.
---
Also, just as a side note... If you are cutting trees with another person, cut the same damn tree. Each cutting your own tree is more "afk", but if the number of tree spawns is an issue then it means you're more likely to be left without any trees to cut (and waiting on respawn) rather than if you were to cut the same tree and stagger the spawns better. Granted there's a lot of RNG involved, but cutting the same tree lets you spend MORE time obtaining logs and LESS time with your thumb up your butt waiting for the trees to respawn :P
---
If the community wants it
---
The tool leprechaun can note herbs, fruit, logs, and anything else you would get from a farm patch. They also store one rake, seed dibber, spade, secateurs (including the magic secateurs), watering can, gardening trowel, and 1000 plant cures, empty buckets, compost, supercompost, and ultracompost.
---
Yeah more so for irl situations tho
---
You can simply cannon Mourners for elves task.
---
You mean he would be?
---
Yep I LOVE BA as well
---
After I get my quest cape I‚Äôm doing my Kandarin hares and grinding for the Queen pet
---
Never offering anything to back up your statements and just bashing jagex for being "bad". Cya hick.
---
Barrows gloves don't degrade

Yep totally agree! And it is hilariously bad against anyone in d hides+ with mystics.

I'm an iron man.

Void is used for theatre of blood and can be used for chambers of xeric

Only have one thing in there is one item that only members can take. Plus they‚Äôre emotes so I‚Äôm not too sure they would be a physical item. I do appreciate the help though
---
TLCdesigns on Etsy May have woodcut capes - no luck on the keychain though üò¢
---
Lol what? If Runescape removes the alch value from rune plate bodies then it will be zero. That's literally the logic you're using lol.
---
You don't understand economics at all lmao. I'm done with your obvious trolling lmao. I almost thought that you were just an idiot!
---
Me: dinhs is overpowered for these reasons.
---
You: My argument is somehow invalid because I've insulted you.
---
You're not my therapist. Go fuck yourself. I don't have to be kinder and I don't care if your point of view is that I'm wrong for acting this way. I'm not actively going to try and get it nerfed. But I can reply to some retard who says "lol just ignore them" if I feel like it. I really don't care if you mute me or this thread. People that mute people don't need to tell someone about it. It's like you're looking for some kind of special attention. Just mute be and be done with it I don't need you to tell me lmfao
---
Dont do wildy slayer on the weekends. Probably why you were getting pked. Weekends are really busy.
---
How much are these?! And whats shipping like?
---
Why
---
Quests are a great way to explore the game, the interactions are pretty funny and unique too. It‚Äôs a great way to adventure and progress at the same time.
---
I was thinking more in line of a temporary ban while the account is reviewed, but sure, I guess that makes more sense for false positives
---
Thanks for the explanation
---
Yeah but you need to do mage training arena for like 4-6 hours to unlock bones to peaches
---
It definitely isnt, Werewolf is faster but more clicky

I see. The runefest17 code is for the physical shield though, but it's still so weird you can't get it.
---
How about you do?
---
&gt;I was thinking more in line of a temporary ban while the account is reviewed
---
I mean yeah, that's what it is. The only distinction for a shadowban is that the user themself cannot tell that they're shadowbanned. That's it
---
Huh weird I did that quest today.
---
 I forgot how much they want you to do fpr him I was just like "just ask us to suck his dick and get it over with"
---
Unfortunately I haven't made it to all the endgame content yet. Though I see people using judiciar, ancestral, and armadyl more often than void during raids.
---
I never said we remove wheat from the world lmao. I said we stop using it. Can be countless of reason for it to still exist but humanity chose to not use it.
---
Your reading comprahension is too awful.
---
You had to kill the monsters for them, and you had to have the skill levels to open them. SW I join a game, run around doing nothing, and gain zeal or whatever for exp. Totally different.
---
Yeah mine are General, fishing/food, magic/rc, ore/bars, jewelry (so fucking stupid I have slots for glory ammy at all diff charges), potions (lol), farming/herblore, and "quest shit".  I feel like a bunch of that stuff can be condensed
---
could've triple dipped and split this into 2
---
He is cancer
---
smh blue cape getting slept on.
---
Make it weildable
---
I didnt tho, you did
---
Yeah, you never played or watch UIM, did you? It's not about being a hassle to store items, it's about being extremely selective with the items you keep, and maximizing alternative means of storage, which is the point of the game mode.
---
Yeah they sold out in a single weekend! Join the RuneScape pin grand exchange group on Facebook and you‚Äôll be able to see when new stuff drops. You can also favorite me on Etsy to get notifications.

Base 80's and 70 prayer gets you 100 combat.  Gl!

Just tried it out, I bought a T7 from a ranked member. I had no issues, everything was finished in like 5 minutes. Would definitely recommend!
---
Thanks!  Just a few levels off then
---
Having to spend money isn't the difficult part it's the practice
---
Why else would they put it in unrestricted worlds for so long?
---
Costing money isn't difficulty...
---
Damn I'm late to this....
---
Been with them for about a month now.  Here's the impression I get.
---
What I like about this CC more than previous ones would be the very low amount of toxicity.  The officers don't publicly insult one another as a joke assuming new arrivals would know that it's a joke.  There are a few very strong players that play a lot, but they don't carry themselves as an elitist like you'd get in most of the heavily populated CCs.
---
I've yet to see a member respond to a request for information/advice with "Google it" unless it's one of those things that simply cannot be thoroughly explained through the small character limit runescape provides...in which case they have typically suggested where to find the best explanations.
---
There's a decent number of willing voice participants for discord.  You do sometimes have to be the first one to step in the public lobby, but once you do you'll notice 5 or 6 more join shortly after.
---
They are also ironman friendly.
---
Should tweet a JMod to know for sure
---
I should've started contracts at 45 farming on my Ironman got back to back cactus contracts and that just so happens to be the most painful to acquire seed.
---
BA even with randoms is easy as fuck, i dont understand how people have problem with that minigame? 
---
as an attacker msb with void - best dps.
---
defender watch a defender guide for 5 mins and it will be easy as fuck, there are crucial luring positions to drop food thats all you need to know.
---
healer - easy as fuck posion all of them then kill one by one and heal when needed
---
collector - just collect eggs cant get easyer then that.
---
Does that include nhing, if so how can you say overheads should be removed.
---
Yeah. Sometimes I forget just how impactful they are just because I've had them on for yeeeears.
---
It was tilting me so hard for the little bit while twitch was getting their ads through adblock recently. I can't imagine not having an adblock lmao. How people get by without one blows my mind.
---
If you are placing as many toads as possible at once, then you'll never have downtime.
---
yea
---
BA is literally one of the best minigames to play. What I hate about it is all you randoms who can't understand how to play. It's literally got a tutorial in game for it.
---
Dat classic fire giant. üòç

I think you're pretty close then.  You could do barrows until you can afford trident/blowpipe then get your range and mage up to 75 and you should be good to go.

Op is not an iron Man
---
I think that really just forces players to go around the wayside to maintain their pvp character. If it only locks in PVP, then if you say die in the wilderness, or are losing money staking, etc. Then you need to get more money or gear again which often means doing PVE killing. Players would just get on another account, and transfer items over.
---
I would say that quest experience can not be locked out.
---
try the ironman cc's / discords
---
All i was saying is that Nh is fine if its in its own category for 1 def accs. I don't a 1v1 veng fight with pray mele, or 1v1 range fight with pray range. Regardless well have to see if we get anything.

How is fishing shit? It's the most afk skill in the game.

Short answer: be careful training prayer on mobile

It really isn't too difficult.  It takes some time to get all of the roles to L5 but its actually pretty engaging. I'd say go into it with an open mind and have fun!
---
Ok, so here we have a person who laid out their kneejerk "gotcha" moment about 10 hp ironmans.
---
I specifically asked in my post what problems you would see arise, and how you could handle them. Did you bother to think how this could be handled?(and to suggest it)
---
So, we have another player Gilzabizlo who said:
---
"Make the xp lock be non skill specific. You either get xp for combat or none. Prevent you from training a stat while neglecting hp gains"
---
That would solve that right there, but beyond that I can think of another solution. In the same way that Ironman characters are displayed, the game could differentiate a character who has locked their exp so that it is evident to all, and thus makes it clear what a player might be getting themselves into by engaging PVP.
---
No illicit gold. Just my main.
---
Are you trying to grind them out for a while or just a few kills? Id be happy to join you, i havent killed them much but theyre pretty easy from what i remember. IGN: death calls
---
Good post OP, nice round up. I personally enjoy UIM Verf and OneChunkMan. 
---
Some additions would be By Release, a dude doing all quests in the order they were released in. That guy is very entertaining. 
---
Another one I recently found and I really think deserves way more views is MaulerOSRS. He does a series on his 10 HP ironman, some of the craziest and most interesting theory crafting I've seen. His editing is really nice too for a guy that started youtube only a few months ago. Definitely recommend checking him out.

Ah right. I forgot getting a 1/128 drop and a 1/5,000 drop on the same drop evens out to a smooth 1/128.
---
Well yes aquring the gear is absolutely easier. The content itself is however much harder, even with BiS. Much more strategy and mechanical skill needed compared to just farming X amounts of hour to do content that can be done while half asleep
---
Fuk nig if u aint huffin da jenk til ya stank u doin sumthin wrong ma g lmfao fr fr

I've got a slayer task so grinding a bit out
---
Ya i see what you're saying but nh shouldn't be exclusively for 1def, it works for all builds and in my opinion is the best style of pking. Yes no one uses over heads in edge/bh style fights. Hopefully they allow all brackets and styles of pking.
---
I feel it goes along with the production value he has for his series
---
It's more of a TV show than a YouTube series in this aspect haha

I had 4 combat 99s. It was a lot of time to me :/.

Yes pls I would love this

well, I wish you good luck getting unbanned, assuming you're innocent and get fucked if you're not.

:)
---
This is basically my assumption every time I see a video posted.

That's what I do. Play a pseudo ironman to enjoy myself and use the GE if anything is too big of a hassle.

---
You'd be incorrect, I see youtube ads all the time for "Apex Legends Mobile beta" or "GTA V on Android"
---
Youtube not only allows harmful links and scam into their advertisements but since they are all just the same format as regular videos they can disable comments and likes so that nobody can call the ads out.
---
It's also worth noting that 1m risk, while potentially profitable, is also potentially a massive loss, discouraging most players from ever even trying pvp even moreso than today.
---
Do Zulrah, when you are bored of Zulrah grind slayer.
---
Untill the current players die. Lets be honest, most of the new people who come to this game have either played in the good old days or played for they leave in like 1 week
---
Not insuring your pet the moment you get it... wow
---
Or if you have an iPhone you can get osrs mobile and resubscribe through the app, they offer a 7 day free trial. Can‚Äôt vouch for android as i dont have an android device but I‚Äôd assume they offer it as well.

I do teach noobs, I don't expect someone to know all the mechanics but I do expect people to understand what their role does and how to right click a horn.

Yeah, I should try my iron man on mem but I don't play it enough to warrant getting members yet. 
---
My goal is to complete dragon slayer on f2p then decide if I want to keep going. If yes, then I'll get bonds for him.
---
Okay but you replied to a different comment than the one that you quoted lol
---
I see you are shilling your hideous t-shirt with multiple reddit accounts. Nice.
---
I got a d med helm at barrows the other day, that shit rng is real
---
Eh could always use bitcoin for online transactions if you're worried about chargebacks. Suppose it would be slower though waiting for confirmations.
---
Olm has this issue where he would use the white portal inside the flame wall, and often times you'd get OHKOed. Also on the final phase he would use that wall while crystal are falling.
---
The anti-fire effect would definitely have a impact here.
---
Oh gotcha, so he didn‚Äôt really get hacked right? He just said that because he sold them and wanted to try and get symphony or get them back?
---
Hope they release a private version when it does, i'll buy it and then just play ironman mode
---
Tan dragon hides
---
I posted it in the chat at the time weeks ago, and was laughed at. I did manage to escape and get my rune pouch. A refund isn't needed. I simply can't recommend the service, sorry.
---
The worst bone to go dry on during that quest was zogres. i was there for 2 hours trying to get it.
---
I actually find slayer way more boring than Zulrah, probably because my kc is only 900.
---
It's just a joke but ok
---
That looks cool! Finally someone with taste üòÇ
---
And even if I dont go all out maybe I could just do white and blue or something
---
If it isn't selling at or under market value you just have to increase the price until you get it.
---
Hit the lower 5% and keep trying to resell it until you get your gold.
---
If not doing ba is worth 100m, its cause youre trash, not youre teammates.
---
When I was doing Sullisceps I found that it was better to do it on a world noone else was on. More people mean more of the Tar Monsters will be agrod and attack you. But there is a world for it (don't remember which one) if you want to do it with other people.

 Bring pineapple pizzas instead of monkfish and you should have less trouble on food.
---
This happens. Typically if something is cheap or I'm impatient, I just click the up arrow next to the price and it raises it to something above the average price for what other things are selling for.
---
If you're planning on making money in the long term or skilling, you might be better off waiting to buy something for the average, default price since it will affect your total wealth down the line. However, if you have the cash to spare and really can't wait for something, like a weapon or armour, before your next task, it might be beneficial to buy a little high.
---
I would set it a tick above for the iron armor and just go mine or woodcut while you wait! You'll have a little bit of spending money that way!

This explains half my teams.

Nice.

if you are innocent, you can try to tweet mods. or maybe if i remember how to tag mods on reddit, u/mod stevew

can confirm if you were rightly banned or not privately. I think if someone was wrongfully banned he'd be more than happy to restore your account and if you are rightfully banned then... why bother with the story?
---
Honestly it comes down to the benefit being outdated. Originally it was because things were kept based on arch value which was later changed to ge value and this made it cheaper to buy some battle staves and what not and then making it a mystic instead of paying the raw change cost.

Ah ok thanks for the info :)
---
Community is split on that one, so wouldn't pass without it being a toggle
---
And it being a toggle is not realistic because it'd double the art team workload. Probably make it considerably harder on the content devs as well.
---
Who laughed at you and who was your seller? I'm shocked to hear this because most people say they have different experiences. Sorry there was a sniper trying to interfere with your sale. Some people are shitty and it's why we make everyone leave the clan chat and turn their private on friends and hop worlds for the sale.

I love the idea, but I‚Äôd say the purple and black should be inverted so it looks less like the Zamorak variant!

I was posting in this sub when the event went live and its impossible to reason with gamerbros. You have to teach them so much shit about why they're wrong.They have no idea what heteronormativity is or that literally everything is political, but when its something they agree with (e.g. hetero relationships in games) its not political anymore because its "normal". its a lost cause comrade
---
Lul.
---
If runescape existed in the 1960s people like you would be like:
---
"wow jagex way to shove identity politics down our throats by giving players an option to play as a dark skinned character smh."
---
Yeah, hes great at answering joke questions for the lulz, but he and the entire team constantly ignore actual complaints and questions.

I'm also curious

Imagine paying someone to complete parts of the game for you to the point that you have no sense of accomplishment or pride in your own doings. Baffling to me.

its not price manipulation, its just what happens when the source for all the ge tracking sites is osbuddy data and people stop using osbuddy.

You could even slowly lead yourself up to one of Runescape's greatest challenges, the Theater of Blood

You can't call him ben, because thats not his assigned name at birth. You are only allowed to call him Benjamin, Benji, Daddy, Big Ben and of course, the Big Cheese.

Varrock elite for the easy 180k a day

Kinda superfluous, but lumby elite was SO good imo. Fuck dramen staff.

Varrock is a nice big city, why not there?
---
Just curious, if they sold out so quickly and more people want them why not do it again and make some profit?
---
Ironmen like you give hardworking, honest, respected ironmen a bad name

Plus once you finish grinding them for a month you can sell all the logs you got for a nice 40k

Hey, this thread is for asking other players, mods don't generally look in here. Your best bet is opening a support ticket on their website.

Weapon swaps, a few prayer pots, some food, and your spade.

I go ahrim first so the weaken effect can wear off first. Then go in a circle starting with DH, Guthan, Karil, Torag, Verac. Never let your prayer drop below 11 when fighting a brother unless you understand the timing and try to time your door open sequence right after a face appears in tunnels. Also, don't forget that Verac ignores prayer. Best of luck to you!

Watch anime or play a second runescape account
---
Is it possible to do it first try, yes.
---
Has anyone done it? No.
---
Yeah, you do have to be careful for anti-pkers who act like bots like that. They know the shitty/new pkers go there for practice and are easy targets for experienced pkers.
---
Why?
---
Magic is fine being the lowest of the three. Theaters way more uses to the skill than just combat that balances out overall gameplay
---
Whats that? You stored your items somewhere else other than a bank? Sounds ultimate
---
2$ = 1m gp
---
Pretty much this. Thing is, that was bearable when I was 18. Now, I'm 27, and it's the same shit in clans. Demanding you attend like 75% of the weekend trips per month, getting bombarded with messages about why you're not on for the 9pm PK trip on a Saturday and how you should change your plans for Runescape.
---
Magic armor is the only armor that isn't strong against the triangle corner its supposed to beat.
---
I think that says it all.

I think he is referring to the farm tele not the monastery

I'll be there!

This guy isn't privy you the basic rules of english.

Multiple colours can be done similarly to this [Infinity Gauntlet artwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/b88a53/infinity_gauntlet_art_reveal/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

or u just get 70 and prayer to be 40cb for pest control then 70-75 in about a week :^)
---
Omg this was so beautiful to watch.
---
The ranged armors got all 3 corners covered dont worry
---
Huh like an A.I. simulated round would be kinda neat lol
---
I really doubt it. People really did not like the Zeah favour girnd. And they have made it a lot faster to get post release.

Wouldn't hosidius be best?

Yeah this happened multiple times when I merch items in volumes.Happened with arcanes, rapiers, and anc top in the past month alone where the item would get manipulated on graphs to show 5-10m from actual price so some mercher could pick it up cheaper/or dump his merch item.Kinda sad actually it hasnt been fixed
---
Thats what I've been trying. Takes a long time since my weapon is a d hally and no piety yet. For whatever reason the pkers think I have loot while obviously 3-iteming. Oh well, let them waste ammo and pots on me.
---
I questioned the value of it myself but upgraded eventually once I had the money to blow. Moved to a 3x3 layout and been very pleased. I think it has been worth it and definitely wouldn't say it's any slower than navigating my old portal rooms.
---
This isn‚Äôt how this is supposed to be used
---
Second DOS2, great game.

Also did Hollow Knights and occasionally Civ6.

OMG that‚Äôs why people randomly trade me but don‚Äôt show me anything once I accept.
---
Oh no. It's retarded
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure but isn‚Äôt abyssal whip better than abyssal dagger? But I‚Äôd assume you know about whip so maybe I should get dagger lol
---
Torture
---
I guess this is more real than those choosing beggars stories since it actually exists.
---
Lmfao tbh you might be spot on... actually...
---
That‚Äôs nice but I thought we were talking about getting a torso at BA?
---
I don't know if it's better dps but I know it doesn't have a str option, hence the Abby dagger. Working towards 99 str while doing slayer.
---
&gt; or giving LGBT representation
---
Can you expand on this? Representation? Very vague.
---
I'm wondering if the route to giving the LGBT community (more) representations is through politics or not?
---
And if that is indeed the course of action, how can you claim it's not political?
---
For the record being political isn't a good or bad thing, it simply is what is is.
---
Politics don't have to be (and aren't) harmful or scary :)
---
If you're taking damage already with 1:0 don't even bother with it, learn 4:1 immediately the DPS is wayyyyy faster. Like he said, a mithril scim 4:1 is same dps as 1:0 maul. Elder maul is still good at tekton though, because you don't use any run energy and you have highest dps besides scythe after 2 specs hit. 4:1 is a little difficult to learn, but the time you will save overtime is definitely more than the time it will take you to learn it.
---
Because the subreddit has a super negative view of something that really isn‚Äôt that bad....
---
He played before that and it was only one of his alt accounts that got a 7 day ban. The ban really did nothing to him.

And before that, it was reposted from a month ago, and before that, it was reposted from a month ago..

Fingers crossed the excuse to not look at this is ‚Äúsomething something engine work‚Äù. I support this. I think the first and third are doable but not sure of the second.
---
Unless you're solely training strength right now, the whip is better than the dagger. And yeah you should get torture next
---
Now THIS is epic.
---
It's better, but the only way to train strength is through Dragon Scimitar, Abyssal Dagger, or Abyssal Bludgeon.
---
Very good response

Man, you are something else. Where did anyone say that liberals are stupid? And when did I call Shapiro a genius? I said the dude was smart lmfao. And I called you ignorant for saying he‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm not even a Ben Shapiro dick rider, I just saw some of his speeches and I wanted to see what his background was like. Do I think most liberals are giant cry babies? Yes. Do I think they‚Äôre all stupid? Not at all.
---
Ohh I see, cheers for info guys
---
lolol
---
I just got one of your goblin pins in the mail and I really love it! I would love to see some skillcape designs, or maybe a damage splat would be cool
---
That's a life changer omg
---
Nice ! :)
---
torture then ferocious gloves
---
How about no. BH would be filled with nothing but prods.
---
This is a terrible idea.
---
You are comparing tier 40 armor against tier 70 armor going the wrong way against the combat triangle.
---
Congrats! This was my life when my twins were born!
---
idk if your berserker ring is (I) but if not, do that
---
Bruh is this legal lmao
---
i remembered beforehand it used to be dhing w/dclaws at nmz and it was like 140k-160k xp/hr. crystal math labs uses such an unrealistic rate of xp now a days to even be considered efficient.
---
Just like how they say paying for runners at zmi is most efficient to 99. would literally cost over 1.3b to 99, it only saves you like 90 hrs. Your money maker would have to be 14m/hr for it to be efficient. which it most likely isnt.
---
&gt; Farming cape isn't a +5% yield, but a 5% increased chance to not lose a "life" when harvesting herbs.
---
What does that come out to be in +yield? as opposed to if it was 5% increased yield
---
It is, all my rings are done
---
TeamViewer was so shit for me before  mobile I couldn't even do a herb run efficiently, how people manage to do high end pvm with that is nothing short of amazing.
---
It's cutting into ROI, not necessarily net profit. Clear speed matters a lot for calculating actual net profit.
---
Doesn‚Äôt stack with salve amulet bro.
---
There are scouts on basically every world at peak times the fuck are you on about "exaggerated" lmao
---
Possibly, though I was imagining splice the two data sets into a continuous piecewise function.
---
This doesn‚Äôt even make sense. I swear people are just taking RuneScape buzzwords, plugging them into whatever template is popular and calling it good.   
---
You don‚Äôt have to try hard with memes. But it helps if you try at all.
---
I would definitely spend the monthly 11$ to play the game. You support Jagex and help the longevity of the game all while not having to stress over making a few mill every 2 weeks. IMO the game gets really boring when there isn't any progression due to spending your money on bonds.
---
im missing anguish/assembler rangers unfortunately still a lot of bis to aquire
---
Not a meme, just based on whats efficient and reasonable.

Doesn't the added accuracy help though?

Any idea of where I can find runescape stickers
---
Imagine if you were the wierdo though. Imagine if gay were the norm, and you were cast out and had hate crimes committed against you because you were straight. Imagine having to hide who you were into on pain of death. Imagine lying every single time the topic came up, for your entire life. Imagine being villified and made out as subhuman or demonic, your relationships trashed or straight-up illegal, having to do in the dark what everyone else does publically. Imagine never, not once, seeing any evidence that others like you exist in media, and imagine if every representation which did exist was insulting. Imagine growing up not understanding what was "wrong with you," why you couldn't just be "normal." Imagine knowing that hiding in the shadows would be your entire life.
---
Then imagine someone standing up and saying, "You are just as valuable as everyone else."
---
Imagine, after all of that, actually getting to have an identity. Imagine how utterly unbelievable that would be. 
---
Sounds like something worth celebrating, right?
---
Besides, it seems like you don't actually know any gay people IRL, because none of the ones I know make being gay their whole identity. They have hobbies, jobs, friends...you know, normal human things. Yes, the movement is all about being loud and proud, but if you don't know any gay people your only exposure to them is while they are being loud, rather than while they are shooting the shit with coworkers. Try meeting some gay people, come back, and tell me they make everything about being gay. I promise you, your thougghts on the matter will change.
---
I've had the most stupid dragon pickaxe luck but I am a main.  4 of them from going for chaos ele pet (got pet at 302 KC) and I am at I think 6 from Venenatis in ~600 kills
---
Lmao you definitely give a shit. People who don't care are the ones that *aren't* throwing a tantrum over an optional, purely cosmetic scarf.
---
Don't play the game that is most enjoyable for you, rush end game content cause that's what a real runescape does /s

Holy fucking shit that is epic. Maaaaad props!

If it beats 1760 total, 67m xp in 2 months with fire cape in the 2nd week, trimmed skill cape on the 4th week and first CoX clear in 5th week then youve got me

Why else do you think range tanks win/get real far in DMM?
---
It's only one step above the shitty veracs meta we had. 
---
Just sitting there camping in Karils or Arma and forcing the opponent to RNG for a splash OR turn it into a range/melee fight, except the other guy is down x amount of invent slots because he brought mage swaps, runes etc.
---
(I do think magic needs to be reworked though, mostly due to the skilling side of it being tied into the combat parts)
---
ITT; people are shit at a social minigame because they are incapable of working with people  
---
Not everything needs to be a BIS reward, sometimes people play minigames for FUN you know.

Not without risking 2m+ in gear. With MA2 Cape SOTD and occult you can max a 21 through prayer. I can tell you don't PK so I'm going to stop arguing with you in particular, and focus my autism elsewhere

Wiki says onyx bolts end up being just under 7gp/xp

Calling a genuine issue with clanning something "nobody complains about" is daft. Makes you noticably behind on clan issues mate. Then you get the big yikes for being a prat about it.

Let me get this straight.

You think UIM would be LESS tedious if you only had like 10 inv slots? What the fuck are you smoking? Have you tried uim??

Should I be using obby platebody instead of dragon chain?

Unfortunately no.

YouTube ‚Äúhow to pk osrs‚Äù, buy 10 sets of rune and an ags, it‚Äôs not that difficult, if you get stuck ... ask someone who knows how to do it

I've been reading most of the quests and while some are brilliant some of the earlier quests are shitty and pointless. The Feud comes to mind as one where the dialogue reads like shitty fanfic. It's bizarre that this game has spelling mistakes and grammatical errors that are nearly old enough to drive, surely it can't be that hard to go and polish up the pre-07 dialogue

Those people are probably the same guys that cry ezscape and complain that updates are dead content

You can be my friend. Most friends I made is because I end up talking to random people while we‚Äôre doing the same activity and just see what they‚Äôre up to
---
Thats because no one has the free time like they did when they were 12 anymore boss. When you have 1 hour to play a day you have to be efficient or else youve wasted an entire day of playing. Nice retarded argument though, retard.
---
Technically it is true but obviously they can't prove if you walked away or just stopped moving
---
Id say that it means in the looooong run it is a 5% yield Increase, because you cant really get 8.5 herbs from  a patch.

You know, that's why a tutorial exists. Maybe don't be braindead and actually look up guides? And great statistic pull out of your ass, it's no one's fault but yours if you're too retarded to play a minigame from 2007.
---
THAT was an insult!? Hahahaha I could insult myself better than that; 394k isn‚Äôt that great of a profit to begin with! He basically said what my title reads, he just used different (and misspelled) words. Gotta love it
---
Hm okay. Silly that you can't use a bond to change the name as a f2p account. I guess I'll make it mems then see what the options are. I appreciate the help.
---
This was too clever
---
dont bother blocking your name or anything else for that matter if you leave up your total exp and your boosted stats. It's easy enough to figure out your name
---
These are really awesome man! Maybe try and do the gwd bosses?
---
&gt; Or maybe people don't like identity politics being shoved down our throats in a video game.
---
Yup, those 5 tiles in an area not really populated by anyone past early-game and about 5 minutes of running around, without any mention of politics or the word "gay", is totally shoving politics down your throat.
---
Lmao people like really reaching far for agendas...

What about cow hides? Are those worth it lol cuz I'm picking them up rn

Ah man Nostalrius, I unfortunately joined near the end and didn't get too far as a lock. Did enjoy what I played, though. And I gotta agree, it's really different when everyone's on the same level ground. You get caught up in that rush with everyone and it's just awesome.

How is lock lategame, anyway? I know the old joke of them being relegated to mushroom farmers for most of classic, but I never did learn the class meta.

Free and no need for house portal in Brimhaven: Fairy ring BJR to the Fisher Realm (from the Holy Grail quest) and use the [magic whistle](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Magic_whistle) you get from the quest (they respawn in the Fisher Realm after the quest). This teleports you to the peninsula northwest of Brimhaven. The whistle works in reverse too to get from Brimhaven to Fisher Realm for quick access to a fairy ring.
---
This may not be the fastest way to the calquat patch but its really close to the Brimhaven fruit tree patch, so do your fruit tree first and then run south to the calquat patch.
---
Depends on what your chance of losing a life is to begin with. With ultracompost you have 6 lives, and if you have a base (no secateurs/cape) 20% chance to not lose a life then your expected yield will be:
---
6 / 0.8 = 7.5 herbs *(see negative binomial distribution)*
---
If you add magic secateurs, increasing your chance of not losing a life by 10% from 20% to 22%, then your expected yield will be:
---
6 / 0.78 = 7.69 herbs (2.5% increase in yield)
---
If you instead had a 30% chance to not lose a life your expected yield would be:
---
6 / 0.7 = 8.57 herbs
---
Add 10% for magic secateurs so your chance of not losing a life goes up from 30% to 33%:
---
6 / 0.67 = 8.96 herbs (4.6% increase in yield)
---

lagunarium, Torvesta does a few different series from time to time, can't think of others worth watching, I'll sometimes watch Framed but I keep video muted.

Textbook hypocrisy.

Arceuus teleport to salve river, you can make teletabs for them its what I used before qp cape teleport.
---
Lmfao
---
I was ready for the flip over to dozens of orange foil crabs
---
Wouldn't even make it over 25% yes as a skill. A majority of players hate PvP would never want to have to level it to get a max cape so no way it would ever pass.
---
How many kills did you already have when switching to rigour? 
---
It‚Äôs possible what your seeing is just getting better at the boss ?
---
You probably buy gold.
---
collect stuff for cook's assistant and do that and sheep sheerer for 2qp.
---
kill some cows (maybe a dozen each?) for cowhides to sell.
---
Do romeo and juliet for 5qp. You need 7qp to sell cowhides.
---
Buy iron armor set and scimitar and some trout.
---
Do stronghold
---
This is exactly what I mean :) thanks pal
---
Salve river teleport on the necromancy book. Can make teletabs of them too.
---
Have you tried watching every settled video again?
---
It's a valid comment, as someone with a 2k+ total uim

Nah.
---
That doesn't answer the question at all
---
I transitioned ingame thanks to the makeover mage. Then irl I transitioned a few months ago. RS helped me discover myself in a way I never knew was possible.
---
Im not super involved in runescape, but wasn't that stuff mostly a joke? Like I can't imagine the Majority of people doing it weren't just trolling
---
I normally don‚Äôt have a problem with dialogue, but so much of it on osrs is just silly banter that doesn‚Äôt add to the lore of the quest in any way.
---
I'd LOVE to have the runes. As well as a character dressed with flowers, a beret, villager sandles, etc.. that skiller look üòç
---
I incrementally run around like a nut job killing imps for their champion scroll. I have a few in the bank but my philosophy is if I can't get an imp one, I'm not farming the rest of them. 5000 imp kills is just F'd. I wonder what people think when they see a dude running around in full bandos smacking imps with an abyssal bludgeon.
---
this is me currently. I am in the early parts of the game, most stats are around 40 base and I am having so much fun, I know once i get further down the road
---
I‚Äôm another guy, I feel like you keep going back to damage. Like you‚Äôre treating all 3 corners of the triangle the same. Magic is particularly strong compared to the other corners due to utility. It stuns and it teleblocks. To make up for this obviously it‚Äôs harder to hit with and the good gear for it is pricey. There is a reason the mage prayers have mage defense as an added benefit. Jagex didn‚Äôt just drool and throw that it for fun. You‚Äôre supposed to splash quite a bit.

---
&gt;Wtf does I barely worked your minimum when I was on test mean? That's 40-50 hours a week
---
You understand that I mean testosterone when I say test. You somehow do not understand what working your minimum while on performance enchancers could possibly mean? You'd even remotely think that it means working a job? Are you truly that dumb? Well, of fucking course you are, wasting your time training and not getting the results you could be getting. And lmao for assuming I train for mass for some reason!
---
Post a fit, you dyel! Although I can already imagine your weak, insectoid body; I don't even need the actual proof to know.

You have to get it back yourself

It hurts
---
Yeah, I typed that because I hear the same thing from retards constantly. Hardly anyone buys gold in this game, but the amount of people who accuse each other of doing so (even though you can make unlimited money with zero talent in this game) is truly staggering. Tell me about me mum's credit card m8.

im linking your vid to friends of mine so we can help you make that dislike bar bigger

To clarify for people who don't know about it: cleaning specimen in Varrock museum has a slim chance of yielding a xp lamp. Not sure what the exact rates are, but you barely get a few 1000 xp/h.

I‚Äôll upvote you for dark souls but I just can‚Äôt agree with you lol, the mechanics of the game are just so different, pvp is tits though

How much gold would I have made from Barb Fishing to 99?

Are there any other monsters that have the same effect as Wyrms for drops while on slayer assignment?

How about a Prophet of Profit? Praise the Void!

Are you actually stupid you dont even understand what I said.

you need 75 defense and 75 attack for dhins. You ALSO need 75 range for blowpipe at revenants. putting you at a level where maxed mains can sneak your shit.

You are just angry somebody called you out for being toxic on reddit and are justifying your horrifying behavior with DHINS OP THO LOL.

Is the item delivery service clan still around?
---
Same reason why an Obby cape you can get from the GE cheaply is better than a Legend's Cape that has way harder requirements; nobody important enough cares about stat balancing...
---
(but on an unrelated note, RS3 actually buffed the Legend's Cape with a recent update for combat integrity)
---
When you have to resort to extremes in an argument you‚Äôve already lost it

&gt;msb into a melee doesn't have nearly the lo potential

And this is how I know you're trolling. You can quite literally stack msb ags and gmaul in 1 tick. You've never stepped foot in the wilderness and this comment here confirmed it for me
