I doubt they would really force a soverign internet, the logistics behind that would be crazy and ineffective for a looonnnng time. At most maybe they could do what China does with the 'great firewall of china'. 
---
They would not get their own special Russia servers, they would have to use VPN to get to the normal ones
---
Anyone here good at NH pking on pures that wanna prac with me :D?
---
Ouch

Did 88-97 at internals, switched to sacred since scale prices are so good

Just another kpop avvie ♿
---
No it doesnt. It feels like the complete opposite...
---
&gt; would do that shit
---
Would do what? Which part?
---
And on top of that each tier clue has its own min and max number of steps
---
Why would you comment the first thing you said? People, mostly, aren't even against things because they want others to go through the same thing but people do want things easier for themselves. Idk how you can bring up 1 side and say it's wrong when the other side is far more wrong. It's how you end up with AFK methods for every skill that give the best xp rates. Looking at RS3.
---
Nice
---
Correct. I dont see that as a personalised message same as quest dialogue is not personalised for me purely because it says my username.
---
For example Lynx and Hey Jase didn't both get a beer chat dialogue popup when hitting it. So those are different entirely custom personalised messages.
---
I am all for a chatbox saying "Congratulations (username) on reaching 200m in every skill! Truly amazing!" Etc. 
---
Just like how right now the chatbox says congratulations you are now level 73 woodcutting.
---
Last time I posted me getting a 1.5b clue, people we're saying the same shit and nothing has happened so far :P
---
I can only get so hard.
---
I loved the system a private server did for items sets. I had 4 item sets. One for questing and running around, one for melee slayer, one for non boss slayer, and a mage one. It was super cool and banking was always super fast.
---
d
---
Pretty sure that is a socialism problem? Lol
---
I can see how one could make that connection, there's definitely overlap between the two in certain arguments, but they're both their own things. An analogy is a fallacy if it's a false equivalency, and I don't think comparing instanced boss rooms to people dying of cancer was an apt comparison.
---
Is the medias story the facts that are known? ALA the same story the justice department delivered? What other story would you like the media to report on? Your completely baseless conspiracy theory?
---
Your login stays the same if you change names
---
Thanks Maxy you're the best &lt;3
---
You're implying it by basically saying that if you can sit on your ass playing video games that you can also become a genius in an actual useful study which is just beyond idiotic. It's mind boggling to me how someone can even compare these 2 things and unironically keep defending this terrible argument.
---
Yeah, but this is your job dude. Hope nobody harasses your company and gets you fired.
---
This was more because of creditcard theft/charge backs, and buying membership for vid

Bots
---
I brought ancients for blood spells to heal up if needed but a guthans set will also do the trick if need be. Neither is necessary but can save some brews or other food options for the big guy.
---
Seriously. Grandayy successfully popularized the Number One meme and then singlehandedly kept it alive *long* after when it would otherwise have fizzled out and died through sheer quantity of high-quality OC. That's fucking impressive no matter what way you look at it.
---
His eternal punishment will be to runecraft but never make it to 77 and always reset to level 1 when he reached 76.
---
If you think it’s completely baseless, you haven’t been paying attention.
---
People are just retarded. You're fine.
---
&gt; Jagex profits are through the roof.
---
And you know who controls that? The management, and their job is to maximize profit. If you want to play a game where the developers are treated decently at all or have control over the content, only buy indie. No big studio treats its employees better than livestock.
---
Yes its far better for the minority to be continually alienated at the hands of people who don't even partake in the things they're voting on.
---
How did you get him to stop attacking you?

You don’t need assembler for anything, but it’s bis ranges strength, so if you have it you should use it

The entire city of Oslo?! That's gotta be against the TOS!
---
Funny how when lynx titan did it everyone was up his ass, but when another dude does it all were talking about is wasted life and metal illness.
---
Youre right, but still.
---
here is my advice. when you start your slayer grind do 9 tasks with Turael in Burthorpe and do your 10 task at Konar. Use the points in the following order:
---
Block List/extensions
---
Superiors
---
Ring Bling
---
Slayer helm
---
Rune Pouch
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
you can get upwards of 1k points in a few hours so this should be a very easy grind. Also if you cant do Konar slayer dont use this method. Vannaka is not worth using lol
---
$11
---
Hard work pays off.
---
Is it upside down?
---
Play?
---
just like they keep pandering to the pvp community failed poll after failed poll?
---
So about half an inch thick, got it thanks.
---
No his feet are above the top on my knee

Open bobs

Ding ding ding we have a winner
---
Rs2 had it for a fair bit.
---
Baseless meaning without evidence. Not a lack of evidence. Evidence. 
---
Our shitty, underfunded prison system and a once powerful and wealthy man who committees atrocities facing an embarrassing and long public trial and life in jail killing himself are literally more believable than a vast conspiracy. That said, I wouldn't doubt either, but there is no evidence of one of these things.
---
expected cerb completion is like /1k ish dont really have much to complain about mate
---
Fuck it
---
Joe who?

you're gonna want 55 rc for the new frem quest.
---
84 run energy, account is mine
---
&gt;Nice straw man.
---
&gt;cause obviously you come from a place where you think you can’t make anything of yourself because of circumstances you don’t have control of.

Hahahahhahahahhaha, do I waste more time arguing with a hypocrite like you? I think not.

Not yet, I had to tele out the beginning of a trip when I got some lag but that was about it.

Nice try, UIM.

I am also aware the uniques are 1/512 for a specific, but for any unique it's 1/128

This guy is definitely being paid by the Clinton administration to make these comments

Wow. Swampletics really is huge. Bigger than I thought

Got about a 200m bank, 80m cash after liquidating a lot of shit. I'm really enjoying vorkath and CoX right now and going for a big upgrade but not sure what to do. 
---
Thinking about selling my Warhammer and grabbing a dragon hunter crossbow or selling my bgs and grabbing the lance. I have rigour zenyte jewellery and raid in a 3 or 4 typically.
---
300 something vorkath and 11 CoX kc
---
You made me look if e24 was out aswell

Isn't most of that stuff 1/1k+? Crystals and stones are 1/512, Jar 1/2000...?

You do know that in the US federal unemployment has been the lowest it’s been like in the last 5 decades. So.... yea about that heading into another recession thing

Fucking who?

My bad, BTWa

Used GPlayer on Android for four years. Customisable with everything. Usually download a series to watch. It also supports an online video from YouTube(just share its link to the GPlayer app).
---
Takes time to get used too tho, but it's been great with every game I played in the phone
---
the F meme is this old??? i thought RSC was way older. no?
---
67 attack  
---
88 str

43 def

41 range  
---
55 magic  
---
43 prayer  
---
88 hp  
---
WOW VERY COOL ACCOUNT
---
Probably like 1-2 weeks.
---
'Larie' is far more impressive IMO.
---
F
---
They banned for literally everything back then lol
---
Yup, I agree. Playing RuneScape for many hours a day to escape life is not a healthy habit.
---
I switched over to Android (iPhone 6 to a OnePlus 7 Pro) for the PiP support, 100% worth it.
---
Same thought lmao
---
Nice guy. Used to see him at the pond when I was dicken out 91 fish
---
I'm pretty impressed by Solo Misssion' s Pure. Can't wait to watch him attempt the infernal.
---
People say the N word and never get banned or muted unfortunately.
---
Bill Barr knows the real truth.
---
I’d just play on my phone in bed tbh lol
---
When is bounty hunter returning?
---
How much do cop that username “Dank” ??
---
Just because he made edgy jokes and maybe even affiliates himself with people do such things.... Doesn't make him a bad pker or even a seasoned one at that. So yes, that is probably the person... He still probably contributable suggestions.
---
The owner of Runelite has discussed with Jagex which plugins are acceptable and has already removed any that aren't so I would assume any plugins remaining are safe to use.
---
If bonds are mtx, how are so many people able to play the game for free with bonds?
---
Dont worry Link the CC got ur back even when you get absolutely hammered on stream. :)
---
No, because you don't want to give him hope of success.
---
December 5th
---
No problem man. I follow Runescape on Facebook just so I can see when they’re giving stuff away for Twitch Prime and for other random news.
---
That's a true entrepreneur right there!
---
How does more gear mean you need to equip it from the bank lmfao
---
Would you introduce MTX into the game as the new ~~Chinese overlord~~ owner?
---
2004 is pretty old yeah, oldest though? doubt
---
Especially on a pure lol
---
YouTube, YouTube TV and Netflix all do pip on Android 8.1 and newer. YouTube does it from 8.0 onward I believe. I think twitch does it too if you have the premium, but I can't confirm that
---
Why when tweeting is perfectly fine, easier, and faster? Any qualified economists can immediately get in touch with them and they can begin the vetting process. 
---
Do you think professionals don’t use twitter or something?
---
Well what did you say to get banned? They usually give evidence on mutes.
---
Start now. Its a great game. I understand your fear, we all do. But dont let fear stop you from doing something you love. If youre unsure, stay f2p for a bit that way you didnt contribute and wont lose much
---
FeelsDeathMan
---
One more and I can finally go to zulrah
---
They are still pretty afkable as if you have auto retaliate on your character just manually breaks out of the special.
---
there's a game called vindictus thats still alive and getting updates, playerbase is like 1/200th the size of osrs, the game is jam packed with mtx but still alive after many years of having barely any players. Its save to assume OSRS has atleast a decade left in it.
---
also, on my iPad Air I can do this with Netflix.  I thank 80% of my skilling levels from this and osrs mobile.
---
We don’t git got. We gon git

It may be a dead meme but but unlike Epstein’s death it’s real

Can’t take a pic atm but mine is 6200+

Please look into my account that has been perm muted for 3 years it has been so long and i have still been loyal to the account it would mean so much to me to get another chance i am reformed i have been punished long enough i just want to be able to fully enjoy the game again :(
---
You’re a legend dude. Thanks for the reply. Im team ragh but only b/c I want to see you “fuming”
---
I read this as "Einstein" and was confused for a moment.
---
Not even close. 
---
People were getting their 15 year vet capes on rs3 the day they released them like 2/3 years ago
---
Lmao ok "tough guy" hahahhaha you're a fuckin pussu and we both know it
---
I don't think they neccessarily know about this tweet. K bye.
---
Lmao if the graphics  are what turned them off then this game isn't for them
---
I can't wait to grind for that hammer...
---
Could someone translate this? I cant find my amulet of btwspeak.
---
Nope.  I'm healthily into 6k+ days and I know there are a few who currently play that joined before I did.
---
Yeah I’m gonna train my magic up some more before I try it again. I screwed up a couple times and got too close to her melee attacks so that was a problem as well.
---

---
Everyone is freaking out. It’s not like they did a LBO iand leveraged the shit out of Jagex to get a better ROI.
---
You can literally see his calf in the picture.
---
thanks for correcting, missed that.
---
I don't agree though, bosses are easier to kill than ever, with 3rd party plugins making them easier than ever. Gold is also easier to come by than before thus probably keeping the gold vs item prices nearly the same (although there are some items that have dropped a lot lately). Bots also probably have quite a lot to do with it. Bonds on the other hand don't enter the game without someone actually paying for them which is why they keep increasing in price.
---
Ok RS3er
---
No offense dude but that sounds super boring
---
But staves switch to whatever your last attack style was if you run out of runes so how would they get def if they weren't using defensive before already? 🤔 I'm calling bullshite, they'd also need auto retaliate on 🤨🧐
---
You have a small dick
---
Lol I looked them up on high score, account doesn't exist guys.
---
Sure, but if you're willing to take those allegations at face value, you should also be skeptical about Donald Trump since he (allegedly, but judging by the tone of this thread *not actually allegedly*) raped a minor.
---
At least change ur bong water dude
---
Show vagene.
---
That's valuable recovery info.. delete this post.
---
Time well spent.
---
How do I suck at the game? Grind 1 bill or just spend some cash and buy 1 bill to flex on broke peasants like you
---
Both. Jagex releases drop rates most often on Twitter, and the wiki adds them in. They also recently gave them a full list a month ago with exact rates, though I don’t know whether Jagex wants to do it again, though I hope they do!
---
Okay, and 'it's honestly crazy' how many teenage girls Donald Trump has raped.
---
Sometimes drop rates are released, but usually it's not. The wiki tends to cite whenever official drop rates were given
---
Do it. It’s tons of fun and even if you don’t stick with it long term you’ll still feel good about reliving that nostalgia
---
Too many emojis
---
I'd drop 2007scape in a heartbeat if official jagex rsc servers rolled out.
---
They give drop rates when it feels "right" but the community is often close to the real drop rate right before hand
---
67 here lol. I think sliding down a razor blade slide and landing in a pool of saltwater would be more appealing than achieving 99 through MLM 😂
---
Why do you have to be trying to get rich. If someone enjoys doing this for 30k hours.more than getting rich who cares. There's nothing mentally disturbed about caring more about a video game than money. It's all meaningless. When you die your wealth means nothing same way your RS account means nothing. And don't pull something out about money changing how you live. Some people also don't value living in a wealthy means. I cannot believe I'm using such an example, but look at wow steamer asmongold. The guy makes millions a year, tens of thousands of viewers each stream. He still lives with his mom in his filthy room he'd record in years ago when he started. Some people genuinely don't care about shit like financial success. It's not a mental disability, it's just how people live.

You act like Bill Clinton was Epstein's lone 'partner in crime', or something.
---
listen, I'm as fed up with Clinton conspiracies as any liberal, but if Clinton did that shit I'm all ears. Let's hear it. Let him get what he deserves.
---
But don't act like Donald Trump wasn't on that same goddamn island.
---
Oh dear, you are dead!
---
It honestly could be; It's very hard to tell without some data on the items and gold entering and leaving the game. It's my hunch since I remember the hyper-inflation days from rs2, though, when it was extremely clear all items were skyrocketing because the game was being flooded with gold. But your arguments are solid and the most likely answer is that both sides are at play to some degree
---
Hey is barb fishing afk?
---
Doesn't matter at all, either works

Possibly a wonky question, but would it be easy to make it so the 'fog' in the runelite plug-in auto-increment periodically over time and have skybox toggle on/off based on a specified fog number? I don't have any experience with writing runelite plug-ins, but it's catching my eye as a way to simulate night-day cycles in osrs.
---
Love the concept here. It's a series I'll probably check out. But it's a series I would be very interest in if you did more than a single hour...
---
Mr No Sleep is great because he does a ton allowing you to see a true average. I'm not saying do 100 hours of these things, but 5-10 would be way better than one. That way you can show consistency in the numbers.
---
Meh

Daaaaamn

No one cares who came in second (or third)

I think every time I pitch it it sounds like it lol.

But to each their own.

Happy cake day sir!

That's what I assumed, was wondering if there was a legit reason.
---
What about pures?  are they welcome?
---
If he is... I am not aware let me go take a look.
---
To be honest with you we only have about 4 people who reliably do GWD and they are all pet hunting, most people give up gwd after they do raids due to GWD being a huge time investment if you want a good chance at a drop. In your own interests I would say if you enjoy GWD more than raiding you would be happier in another clan. I dont want you to join and get let down. But if you just wanna do the occasional GWD then we do do that. We have clan sponsored Boss of the month and Skill of the month and GWD is chosen every about every 4 times

What is the best method to get started with nmz and get points. Dont really want to use any prayer pots (btw). I have Desert treasure and dream mentor completed if that matters for getting started.
---
They've already data mined p2w mtx for the game
---
Generally stats don't make too big of a difference when you are lower level because you level up so fast you just upgrade again soon anywayd and it's more your raw stats that are making the Initial differences.
---
So if you are using magic you can skip a lot of the obscure weird armors anyways. Most people go from blue wizard hats and robes to mystic when training mage then use that until ahrims. It's only when you start hitting the higher levels that you are going to be fighting stuff where you would want the stats anyways. If you are just chaos bolting some blue dragons or something it's not going to hurt to wear a black cav Instead of like a mystic hat.
---
If you're going to zulrah or doing a kraken task obviously the scenario is much different.
---
Slayer helm (i) and ancestral hat are the only headslot that give mage damage increase if i recall correctly and ancestral is only like \~2% damage boost
---
I am currently grinding for diary Cape. CBA to grind most of these skills even. Can't imagine maxing

Lmfao. Good thing he has it on. Now he can jump right into bed for a week crying in the fetal position. 😂
---
Yes
---
Would help me carry my team at raids
---
pretty much. 
---
the game is simple: you set goals and you achieve them. the goals take longer to achieve as you progress. nothing wrong with that, right?
---
however, the goals eventually become quite difficult to achieve, requiring many hours of repetitive actions in order to achieve them. your patience is tested and your desire for the goal is questioned. then you start questioning whether you actually value the rewards that you'll get. once you're there, it's all downhill.
---
of course, all games eventually become uninteresting. you have to really, REALLY love this game to have been here since the beginning and still want to play it. those players do exist, and they keep rs3 afloat, but they're rare. 
---
the problem is one of new user acquisition. they're not getting enough new players to replace the ones that are leaving. osrs does little advertising and has no plan for player growth: their goal is simply to keep player churn as low as possible in the short term. i have no idea how they're going to get out of this but if they don't, the runescape brand will die.
---
orry mate but I'm a mobile only Redditor, if you're on PC I cant help.

Hm last time I had this task it was, well, not too easy... I had to resupply often... not sure about it. But thanks for the idea.
---
Jagex used to be indie. It’s going to be a problem when there’s no devs left to make the game. Better yet bigger problem when you lose your playerbase from lack of new content. This isn’t something they can just keep throwing MTX at to fix.

Well back in the day in Australia we could actually use our phone plans to get free membership. Like if you recharged $30 prepaid you'd get talk, sms and data, but also the original $30 to spend on paybysms memberships. Unfortunately they got rid of this so now we're stuck with inflated prices due to the falling aussie dollar.

It's nice, but not sure why you didn't use the image of Swampletics?

There's some details missing for sure.

Its pretty good. Theres some more rural areas near where i livewhere signal will drop out sometime but otherwise id say service is pretty good. No real complaints

try to get enough gp for a bond since u are member and u can easily have free member forever :)
---
I think the idea is that the prayer would have a higher defensive buff than piety, but no offensive buff to compensate. It could be as high as like 50% and still be pretty niche, since this game is pretty much all about dps.

Title should say he lost the chance of getting one.

Basically what happened during the stream is that the servers caused a lot of people to DC, and for some reason that caused the raid to register he had died twice. Despite never dying at all.

This is just Karma for all the shitty quest guides he made.

Can everyone give me their opinion on why OSRS makes a good esport, why turning OSRS into an esport has warranted all the attention it's gotten (admittedly not much), and why OSRS needs a head of "esports"?

But I’ll be back in a year or 2. I’ve quit so many god damn times, the RuneScape itch always wins.

Tattoos aren’t permanent, because your life isn’t permanent, might as well enjoy the little things.

You could, this just means whoever is the holding company of Jagex does not.

I used super combats and so id buy 100 in waves. lets say ive used 600-800? people say its usually 3800-4200 per kill so ive made 200m forsure on average
---
If they don’t I’m joining the rc guild I’ve been waiting to long for this.
---
Okay, show me evidence of this shadowy Clinton cabal. 
---
You think my conspiracy theory is bullshit but yours is on the money?

You ever think both are bullshit?
---
No, bad, stop. *sprays squirty bottle at op*
---
I keep seeing TBow drops and its making me want to start raiding again but at 110 KC ive had only one drop in my name and the shit is so demoralizing to go so dry on
---
Would lower the value of all the John Deere tractors in my bank
---
Wont take long if you're being legit lol
---
I just checked and can confirm.
---
Wow.
---
Why no color?
---
I believe it, but some people can do some absolutely mental things in this game, so I imagine some.people can react in time haha.
---
Very ipressive, but can you do it with only your left hand (or right hand if you're left handed)?
---
How much farming xp do you have?
---
87m
---
I'm waiting until the finale for that.
---
Is the 2nd one even useful for anything?
---
absolutely probably
---
you shouldnt be doing work for other people thats ridiculous. get the free quest done get some lvls up in everything you can. well except maybe hold off on prayer then get a bond and actually have fun playing the game

Last two times I attempted I logged out a round before Jad to take a break to calm nerves and take a piss. Both times I can back I fucking lagged in the middle of two of his attacks and got thwacked down. About 3 hours wasted for 3 seconds of lag. Lololololololololololol 😂😂😭😭😭😭😢😢😢

Or is it the best part?

Did you want to game end yourself? If so, how often?

u/melbcentralisleaking removed his original post because it was posted as a link &amp; not an image. OP downloaded, added the spade pvmer &amp; uploaded.

Which Id be fine with had the original post not been removed &amp; no mention of here.
---
it was a calm profitable experience
---
What makes you think either of these accounts are theirs?
---
I *would* say the same thing about this sub
---
pls explain
---
I agree that the polling system so served well so far, but I also agree with jagex when they say that niche communities doing niche activities need to be heard of, and that the current poll system does very little to account for these group of people. Things that the broader majority of players not even know matters. I think its a good call to have expert opinion have more weight on their votes in polls. The problem is, how do we decide what counts as expert opinion in the first place. If they somehow figure that out, then yeah I'd be all for it.
---
obs
---
All the mobile people have had their fill and quit
---
also there wasn't really a ton of engaging updates this year (imo)
---
pls explain this, i get everything up to RC
---
And succeeded. It was amazing
---
Pretty sure it represents nature, as per the name 'Nature Rune' - Blood rune however definitely has references to his case..
---
Why? Because how dare it be in alphabetical order?

The rs3 bank interface now (post-rework) could be a way they could do it, i.e. having a tab on the right side showing worn items and then inventory below that with an option to minimize the worn items tab. It also has some nice features like showing the armour/str bonuses etc. as well on screen without making it look cluttered.

No just a few edge lords hate weebs. They are projecting their hate for themselves onto the weeb, for they are to "cool" to pursue things that they enjoy and have become jealous of the weeb.
---
OSRS is just an exe, you don't have to install it. Java would probably be the dependency, and the host computer would have to have that installed in order to successfully launch the exe from USB.
---
About fucking time this got some attention!

I just got an account I myself botted 5 years ago unbanned. Just https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115002238729-Account-Bans "Appeal ban"

If you don't trust that link, go on google and type Rs appeal ban and click  "Account bans"

Amen, brother.

I have like base 80+ combats, 87 range with rigour. got about 50m budget for gear. Think I might be able to pop in?

I'm at level 66 FM right now, deciding whether I should drop it or not.

yes this is dead time of night. also pc before 100 combat isnt meta

This is the one where you gamble with Robin until he loses enough that he's willing to sign a bow for you

I hate fight caves. Getting to Jad is easy as fuck, but takes over an hour. Mess up one prayer switch and you just wasted over an hour and half a mil in prayer potions and scales for no reason except some range exp.

If it makes you feel better, fam, the (current) word from Jagex is that DMM is coming back. There's a recently-hired "esports expert" person in the company now; they might be able to re-tune things to avoid all the clanmanmode / ddos-vulnerability / other problems the mode suffered from...
---
I don’t disagree but to play devils advocate how often do you actually scroll through your log to the point that seeing green and yellow would annoy you? It’s kinda like a quest list. Personally I think it’d be nice and just cool to see the lines change color eventually but that’s me.
---
I'd recommend looking around the /r/ironscape sub. It's not as big as this one, but caters specifically to ironmen
---
Was there the other day and there were tonnes of people about

I'm personally not a fan of multi-clanning  due to it making the multi-clanner get alienated for the most part. Using the clan as an LFG is fine but people would see you as a person who is there for the raids and not the community and would probably see you as a high risk for scamming because you wouldnt have any strong ties to the clan. You might be able to catch the occasional raid when people need a third but I'd rather if you spent your time 50/50 between the two clans so you make friends and become part of the community.

Implings came out 12 years ago though hmm

I laughed so hard at the nonstop shark gobbling

i think that items on top are what went into and what he felt while geting 99 RC. so his "blood and soul" and feeling "wrath" and when he finally got 99 he felt "glory"
---
I could ask you the same thing.
---
Lance and crossbow are almost identical at vorkath. 
---
The lance setup requires much more expensive gear but ends up being cheaper on supplies.

Only jamflex would still use facsimiles
---
... You know scales cap out in the collection log at the number showing, right? 20k kills on log will only show 65k scales in the log
---
slayer. you have 2 weeks so you wont get that far but if you pay for just one extra month after that you should be able to start selfsustaining bonds w slayer
---
Make sure to keep them in your inventory at all times too.
---
Bird up
---
How long did 50k kills take? And what was your profit an hour?
---
Second time Ive seen someone incorrectly call this an error.
---
How are there people that still can't figure out the scales stop getting counted at 65k
---
And your logic doesn't make sense, you're saying his log only counted 330 kills but his kc says 1300 since the log came out.
---
I also think that if its not a reward specific to an activity, it needs to be polled.
---
Take the godsword special attack recolours that were polled for BH. Just because they're only a reward from BH doesn't mean that the rest of the community shouldn't get a say in what cosmetics exist in game.
---
For other monetary rewards I'm a lot happier for it to be kept to PvPers
---
lmao mad?
---
Hmm mine was just in my payment settings then clicked cancle subscription
---
Did you even read my statement??? i asked a fucking question...... i want to do the fastest xp i never complained about it. If something saves me time i will do it. I clearly made an educated guess at what ardy knights xp rates would be at my level and asked if there were faster alternates bwcause i have no knowledge of this skill whatsoever. Ego maniacs like you disgust me, preying on others for your own satisfaction, misrepresenting others just so you feel good. Either that or you dont know how to read a question, all i asked was for a faster way with my near 0 knowledge of a skill and then you belittle me, what a guy.... bet your one of those toxic pkers too, wouldnt surprise me
---
If it's any consolation I'm at 2250 vorkath kc with just a jar to show for it too. I've also gotten the dragon shield left half!
---
You could use TeamViewer and run it from your computer at home? Though obviously they will see TeamViewer but if that's okay with them then that's one way to do it
---
Proud of you.

are boss pets and cosmetic recolours the same for you?

I was a part of a police force on Habbo Hotel and people would report casinos to us all the time. Obviously, we’d attend the calls only to realise that we were powerless against a room ban.
---
sister?
---
Not an Ironman but I was thinking of this recently.
---
I would be inclined to spend a few hours at the agility pyramid for some gp.
---
Other than that some high alchemy runes, an axe and a yew tree could be a really afk method, just chop trees cut them into longbows and alch away.
---
Also I’d bring alch runes to every slayer task.
---
Settled had an interesting method of afk training for smithing, crafting, mining and mage.
---
He would go to the fight cave entrance and mine the gold rocks then go over to the furnace nearby and using goldsmiths gauntlets smelt all the bars into gold and then in turn into gold bracelets, he would then alch them all and repeat. 
---
He did this because he was a uim and everything was very close so he didn’t have to bank but a similar method seems like a good mix of skills to train at once while making steady gp.
---
At least this one has the requirement of needing amazon prime. I do agree though that these promotions are not good for the game.
---
Normie shit
---
Battle staffs, ecumenical keys, slayer with RoW and alchs.
---
5.3m
---
PvP will die just due to the fact that it’s typically way less gp/hr then pvming despite having to actually risk and potential to lose what you have when pking... less reward then the risk you’re having to take.
---
Use it to move the nature altar straight to edgevillr bank. Rc fixed
---
zulrah isn't engaging at all. It has no exciting/particularly valuable drops, and its so close to a tele that you don't really get punished for most mistakes. It's just pure memorization. Compare that to chin method arma, 2:1 shield swap zammy, 2:1 mage flick bandos, etc. and they're way more exciting and engaging. Not only are there actually valuable drops you can get, there's also actual motivation to improve because of how long it takes to get back. If anything, the one I would agree is boring is hydra since you take no damage and it's right next to a tele.
---
Also, there's way more to being fun than being engaging. Cox isn't particularly engaging pre-olm, but it's more fun because the potential rewards are huge. Same with tob, gwd, and hydra. One of the things that a lot of people hate about zulrah is how you can't really get a big drop. The uniques are dirt cheap, meaning there's never really any surprise unless you get the pet/mutagens. It's just the same thing, over and over, with very little variation in profit.
---
The point of the chaos altar is to save you money by saving bones. Why would you pay somebody to protect you so that you save money? Just use world 30 house portal guilded altars instead. That or just do the suicide pvp world method where you take 28 bones at a time and a burning ammy and use them up and die by chaos fanatic, that puts you in lumby 2 steps from a bank and repeat. OR do the alt method where you bring a lvl 3 as your alt that carries all your bones and unnotes them, just be careful and watch for low level pkers.
---
The runecrafting guild
---
I wonder just how much it cost them to run.
---
YIKES
---
Wintertodt is a place of pure suffering. When the chat box isn’t filled with pure shanter or toxicity, WT decided to combo stack you out and smites you for your yak hide.
---
Low population world during off hours for that worlds location. Total world's tend to be a common hunting ground for pkers due to people thinking they're safer, so try and avoid em.
---
Somewhat related: I remember when RS3 added the ability to drop items from the bank screen inventory. Many people didn't realise this and dropped expensive items without knowing, so Jagex removed the function.
---
You’re totally missing my point. 
---
Just because you might not like it 20 years down the line doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get it, because none of us even know if we’ll be here that long.
---
Yeah man your 80 year old self is going to be really happy you decided to not ever mark your skin with things you liked or were passionate about when you were 20. 
---
!Remind me 65 years.
---
Gz man, but I gotta ask... How did it take you almost 90 minutes with elite void and a BP? That’s crazy long.
---
Green complete,another color for pet. Red, yellow, green, w/e
---
Oh yea well today I got back to back rock shell legs at Rex AND a dragon med helm
---
hitting rdt isnt the same as hitting the ONE SPECIFIC RARE DROP you want... the rdt is common and has many items making each specific one seem rare..
---
Bam, done. Thank you!!!
---
Why? I'd say it's pretty good
---
Mom said it's my turn to repost this
---
Dharoks would be good only if planning to train in NMZ, but for any other training bandos is way better bcs of str bonus, dragons boots is fine till you get premordial boots. Like W-Virginia said, get zenyte jewels.
---
Just give the money you made from botting away. And grind out the cash again at like green drags or something should make you feel a little more good about yourself doing that haha
---
512*512*75? 19 66 0800
---
Or try and grind out the money at revs.. skulled so you get pked a lot and get pissed at all the nub pkers piling on you!
---
That’s insane! Great loot :D
---
Damn good art goes unrecognized. Shits dope my dude

Why even craft another string?

ok sjw go eat ur avocado toast now with ur frappucino
---
This is what I would do aswell
---
I’d like this, as long as we knew subs from OSRS would cover it. It seems MTX is the majority of the revenue for Jagex though, which at the end of the day pays both our investors and our developers, both of whom need to earn profit out of this in order to want to continue work on it.
---
Others have vilified investors making profit, which is absurd. If we could get accurate pricing info and membership numbers (both might be available idk) then we could see if this idea would work, but I also don’t think Jagex will do anything major that’ll worry investors.
---
Nice name lol
---
The big three
---
How do u get twitch prime?
---
It's an understandable viewpoint though - why should people vote in content that directly makes it easier for them to die in the wilderness? 
---
Promoting pker vs pker fights and making it easier/cheaper to get into the pking scene are healthier ways to improve the state of pvp, without fostering (more) resentment in entitled pvmers.
---
I agree as long as stuff affect other types of players I don't think it's fair to limit who has a say.
---
Whereas things like LMS and BH if it doesn't affect me then I don't care what you do with it. But if it does then I deserve a say.
---
I also think BH and LMS are good and should get the attention they require even though I don't participate.
---
The point I was making is that bis is subjective.
---
Does it have the best strength bonus? Sure.
---
It's still not better than slayer helms for on task, it's got less features than the deep helm. It probably won't increase max hit for the vast majority of loadouts.
---
It's nowhere near deserving of the drama it caused.
---
Voting no to things that make it easier to pk people is not spite in the slightest, this is an MMO, practically everything has an effect on others.
---
Almost every hard clue or above does ? Or have I just been unlucky
---
gz
---
which client allows me to do things that are specifically against the rules????
---
If at first you don't succeed, change the rules until you do.
---
If there's not enough incentive, we can always add more.   
---
Correct - rogue kills don't get any extra bonuses in hotspots as that'd way too farmable.
---
Authenticator on email?
---
As I said in the post the prerequisite wouldn't be one clue and it's not just limited to clues. I'm just someone who loves doing clues, so I spend a LOT of time in wilderness. 
---
Master Clues are not easy to get, you don't drop them because there's a wildy step or you'd never finish one.
---
Will the slayer masters sell the rune pouch for 1,5m gp even after the update? 
---
Since the poll of making them tradeable did not pass they are currently over three times as expensive as before or require considerable amount of time to get through playing bh or getting slayer points. This is annoying for us who like to pk outside bounty hunter.
---
So with the new BH rework, will ironmen still be able to get runepouch through wildy slayer or will we be required to ~~buy kills~~ participate in pvp?
---
That sounds good, thanks for the reply Gambit. I'm hoping we can have some PvP updates soon that don't follow the typical poll route - the PK scene is dying quickly.
---
okay thank you for answering my questions :) luckily my pk acc is ready soonish so ill be a bit late haha
---
This is the funniest response. Avocado toast the food of sjw’s lol
---
There is now since this has happened, didn’t have it before.
---
 Added it to pretty much everything I can this morning lol
---
its top 2,000,000 so just search for by rank for rank 2000000 on the highscores
---
Lock your account to the draynor village jail.
---
It started off so well, that really let it down.
---
Is there a way to obtain the ornament kits as an ironman?
---
Overall I'd say this update improved BH slightly. If unique are added, it'll be worthwhile imo.
---
Also, I'm a long time pker with 5 maxed pking accounts(would make more but stopped since pvp has been dead), and thousands of hours worth of pking. 
---
That being said, I think that having a pvp council would be fantastic and you should just allow there to different ones for different parts of the game and should work like this -
---
* Players are allowed to vote on anything pertaining to updates and the % to pass will remain 75%. However, between 50 - 74.99% it should be repolled through the council.
---
* Players in the council will be voted on every 3 - 6 months and only those who apply will be eligible. If someone drops out, they're position will be repolled the following set day. 
---
* The council will be a max of 10 players per categories, which will be broken up into 4.
---
* PvP, Ironman, PvM, and Skills.
---
* QoL changes, or changes that may cover multiple categories will be comprised of 2 members from each council.
---
* Changes will need to be 9/10 or 7/8 for the grand council. If a resolution cannot be met, the council will come up with new suggestion or change that they decide(after jagex reviews it). 
---
* Council members cannot have any prior bans in the last 3 years and will be removed if they abuse their power. 
---
* Council members will get free membership for 1 account for their duration. 
---
This, in my opinion, would be the far best to do. While everyone's opinion does matter, not everyone fully understand ramifications of certain updates, or even nessesities that are sometimes required for the games integrity.
---
What's wrong with it? The system worked well with new players. A poll isn't going to guage something like that without setting up an entirely new polling system that only works for new players, which honestly sounds like kind of a good idea.
---
I just don't understand your point. It's a part of the game, and you can literally bring 3 items and never lose a clue in the wilderness.
---
Dagionhide 40 def req and more rare are the same stats as 1 def elder hood.... it’s not balanced
---
Yes, the free membership bot wheel is gone now. Well at least was.
---
Ehh I get them sometimes, but definitely not on every clue. Even then I just bring 3 items so I don't lose my clue if I die.
---
Oh no I didn’t know this. 
---
F to me closing in on the pity head for what was going to be my new slayer helm
---
I think player limited polls is a genuinely horrible idea that should never make its way into the game.
---
People have made very good points as to why PvP updates fail and changing the poll system to get them to pass artificially will only further divide the community and create more friction between the PvM/PvP crowd.
---
All these AMG drivers in deep wildy. They drove me iber so manny times while clue hunting.
---
Im gonna vote no on every AMG Poll.
---
 The content on Reddit I want to see.
---
The Jmods have said on stream that they don't want to have it this way. They want the collection log to be a neat way to track your stuff, not something to strive to complete.
---
~006~@cya@System Update: We're fixing the crystal chest
---
Not with that attitude you're not
---
How the fuck do you have all those drops on that low kc? I don't understand luck like that lol, and makes it seem like accounts are in a "bracket" of sorts vs certain bosses. I got 2300+ hydra kc, only 3 brim rings, 4 leather, 6 tails, 2 jars, 5 heads, and pet at 1200 kc. Still no claw. Your luck there is actually insane..beyond insane lol that you get a unique literally every 5 kills. That's just bullshit. /a very salty hydra farmer
---
Understandable, yeah, just kinda sucks since they’re left with the problem of trying to revive PvP mini games without having rewards to make it worthwhile. Yeah, some players will just say ‘Well just don’t update PvP then and let it die’, but that’s not really a fantastic approach to take and isn’t really in anyone’s best interests. 
---
For the record I’m not saying the rewards they polled were perfect, and you make good points about what could be offered instead, I just wanted to point out how tough it is to be able to come up with rewards that suit both PvP and PvMers.
---
But every time Jagex offers rewards that incentivise pkers fighting each other the spite voters vote them down, just look at LMS..
---
Sick, wish i had that determination. What are you gonna do now?
---
‘Just use a rune pickaxe’
---
‘But I have a crystal tool seed for a Dragon Pickaxe’
---
‘Then go get a Dragon Pickaxe’
---
‘But I have to enter the wilderness and risk getting pked’
---
‘Don’t enter the wildy if you don’t want to get pked’
---
‘But I want a crystal pickaxe....’
---
Gratz, thats crazy luck!!!  Although in future you should take a picture of the picture of a picture using another camera, that way it's more clear you're mentally disabled...
---
I do that all the time?
---
Lol 😂
---
As a pker, I also have to partake in content that I don't want to do if I want to optimise my account. It's just how the game works.
---
In order to get the best in slot gloves that are essential for PvP, I have to get 175 quest points and train numerous skills, and I also have to kill multiple NPCs along the way.
---
In order to get the best in slot ranged weapon, I have to complete the grandmaster quest MM2 which in itself is a grind given the skill and quest requirements.
---
If I want the best in slot cape for ranged, I have to complete Dragon Slayer 2, which requires 200 quest points and multiple high level skills. This quest boss is also the hardest out of any by far.
---
If I want the best in slot melee cape, I have to undertake the hardest PvM challenge to date and spend millions on supplies and countless hours to acquire it.
---
My point is that whether or not somebody likes PvP, the wilderness is a part of the game, and naturally there are going to be things locked behind it. That's just how the game works. Nobody is "forcing" you to get those items in the same way that nobody is "forcing" me to have to quest and skill for weeks to acquire items that I want. However I accept that it's a part of the game and I just have get it over with if I want to optimise my account.
---
I really do understand your perspective, because I hate questing &amp; skilling and I have had to acquire barrows gloves on multiple accounts to optimise my accounts for PvP. Of course I'm free to not quest and skill my way to best in slot, but I'd be at a heavy disadvantage if I weren't to do so.
---
You go to the big issue, putting too much non pvp content out there, if they hadn't overdone that i'd wager the polls wouldn't be an issue, its a Jagex problem more than a polling/pker/non pker problem.
---
4000 hours over the last 7 years literally equates to an average of an hour and a half of playtime per day.  
---
While I myself have never been able to play this game for a consistent stretch of time, I think that amount of playtime is perfectly reasonable.
---
I'm trying to get a Rune Pouch. On the wiki it says I can buy one for 750 slayer points or 1.5m but when I open up the slayer shop I see no Rune Pouch. Am I looking at the wrong place?
---
Just as a heads up, the price reduction for the rune pouch from 1,250 to 750 **was** polled, and passed. Not saying your other points are invalid, just wanted to clarify that one at least :p
---
thanks &lt;3
---
We have enough to worry about with all these russian and Latvians dicking around as it is
---
Pking dead wild is dead yet here we are cry babies are still here....
---
Oof
---
Unfortunately I'm not free to get barrows gloves (item that shouldn't at all be locked behind 175 quest points) outside of questing and skilling for 10s of hours.
---
nice
---
I only play this account after like 2 months for 1 week ish. i have a main account that i do raids on which has 2k CoX and 1k Tob KC. Skilling is still fun tho from time to time :P
---
thanks for making runepouch infinitely harder to get for pvp world only pkers, that’s SUPER helpful lol
---
What did it cost?
---
Probably 4hp since it'll be bonuses added on the same tick.
---
First time poster, more like first time computer user Kek
---
Is that a cum stain on your screen?
---
Seriously you need to watch [this](https://youtu.be/EoTpIYLBtKs)

If you have a job irl, just pay for membership. Unless you are making 1m+ an hour it is not worth it to use bonds bought ingame. A bond gets you 2 weeks. Even if you are working for minimum wage in the US it only takes 2 hours of work to pay for a full month. Thus to not put pressure on you having to play to make money to pay for the bonds just buy membership with irl cash, if you have a job.
---
You tell us to plan our twisted league strategy based on the task list, but the full task list isn't anywhere. 
---
Also, the link to the wiki is broken.
---
&gt;I accept the risk of death.
---
yes because black d hide is such a risk
---
how exactly are pvp world only pkers supposed to get rune pouches now? they are mainly used by NHers, something no one does in BH...? This wasn’t thought through at all
---
LMAO all of that work and dedication and then you forgot to censor FPS, thanks for the maxed account lad!
---
12 second pj timer in singles only cause let’s face it. Multi is a special kind of awesome just as it is I think that would cure all
---
Did that guy really say the gamer word?
---
Looks cool, what max cape is this?
---
Damb idijot aj em smaarter dan everyvan
---
You think having multi everywhere would cure the wild?
---
Yes I'm sure the 20% of players who admitted in a poll that they actively vote no because they "don't like PvP" has absolutely nothing to do with it. I'm sure that's why PvP polls and shot down time and time again and I'm sure that's why Jagex are going to be restricting PvP polls to pkers.
---
Is this someone complaining?
---
Relatively how long did it take to get the points for it?
---
I’d get 99 RC very quickly with all that banked dark essence...
---
It's that simple
---
🤢
---
He's a silent btw
---
Imagine you're in wildy and get told "sit" by someone wearing these ughhh
---
I tried twice yesterday on mobile. Got to Jad, misclicked prayer and died! TWICE! 4 hours of my life I'm never getting back!
---
I never said it was a bad update, nor that I disagree with it existing in the game. Calm down, mate.
---
The 1/128 counts the onyx tho
---
Let me guess you're not a pker. Your opinion holds little weight since I'm sure you've voted no to pvp polls.
---
I have found it's not my patience for things but my unwillingness to learn new things sometimes holds me back. I recommend jumping into the fire and you'll learn you like random things you wouldn't of thought you did. My two cents.
---
It wont removal of the emblems from wildy slayer pretty much kills it besides farming points and less shit tasks for low lvl slayer.
---
I have some really good tattoos, also a couple "shitty" ones. I love them all the same
---
benis
---
Its so frustrating as its like 55 minutes just to get to him and if you mess up once thats it 55 minutes wasted!
---
Yep. I got an MSB(i) scroll yesterday, and just got a RoW(i) now.
---
No, I'm super lucky. But it is a very rare situation I find funny.
---
Not that I'm aware of. I think they said on the original blog that they'd look to find somewhere else to sell them if not on the new BH shop, but not 100% sure on that.
---
This is why osrs pking was great, everyone was clumped at edgeville 1vs1 and was able to use their human instinct and copy how others pked
---
Jagex should realize this
---
Yeah rendi’s firecape isn’t significant
---
I’m not sure why dragon pick axe isn’t on zulcano drop table anyway, it makes sense, much more than having to safe spot Wildy bosses until you get lucky.
---
There's normally some pures that nh their non-nh targets in low wild, a few hang out at wests sometimes, often there will be some at graves and lava maze tele/44s. People that don't like singles teams will nh in bh because it has a pj timer. They also polled rune pouches to be tradeable but it failed so... big rip. They will probably re poll it though.
---
Is there still a 30 combat requirement to play the new BH?
---
Didn't ask.
---
rsps have better customer support than jagex....
---
If we see a serious decline in people doing Wildy Slayer, we can re-incentivise it in other ways like increasing the value/frequency of Larran's Key drops.
---
Do agility and then afk with redwoods or bloods, that’s how I’m slowly doing it.
---
This, but unironically
---
Now you can finally play the game
---
So you're downing his opinion for not agreeing with your opinion. Ok then
---
Yeah this is a great point, I’m not sure why people are quite so opposed to going into the wilderness for a clue you just minimise your risk and evaluate the reward and whether it’s worth it.
---
I understand hardcore ironmen may dislike it but the whole idea of that game mode is to make it more challenging and changing the way you play compared to normal accounts.
---
None of that is mid level really
---
I feel like the best thing it can do is extend the use of boosts. If you only get 60s from boosting to the desired level, you'd be able to perform more actions and get more done by limiting the amount of time you're in the bank interface. Tack on Preserve for another 30s and you're potentially getting an additional full inventory or two every boost
---
Damn you caught them, Jamflex is out to get pkers so they only include skip votes for pvp polls and don't include them for pvm because fuck pkers. /s
---
As much as I would love that, I'm not worthy!
---
Wow that cake is so huge
---
can skip them without a penalty, giving you the option to prioritise targets with Emblems that match your tier.
---
give points to rogue kills in hotspot areas? what the fuck is the point in leaving edgeville, regearing (2mins might lose targ) to then go to the hotspot where your target wont even come too because he cant tell if ur in the hotzone ur just some deep wild somewhere.
---
yes sell the dagger.. a d scim is a good option till you earn enough to buy it back
---
This sums up why I play ironman lol
---
You can train at the Gnome Agility course... Thank god rooftop courses were added in aside from the marks of grace and graceful. The early levels back in the day were so much worse. I remember doing  1 - 25 at the gnome course.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Gnome_Stronghold_Agility_Course
---
Im really hoping this increases the odds of Warding being implemented; The voters forgot that the best thing in 07 was a new skill release.
---
Currently the limit gets players get 2fa to protect their accounts, other than that can't think of anything
---
You have to use two forms of antifire for vorkath so you have to use dfs. There was a guide posted 2 days ago with bp/dhcb/melee setups. Ranged is super easy but costs more supplies. Melee is just different and requires a little more movement.
---
&gt; but judging by the tone of this thread not actually allegedly
---
Yeah those are two things that are definitely connected /s
---
Yeah but to his credit strength amulet (t) came out before that cap was removed.
---
&gt;farmable in f2p
---
&gt;tradable 
---
&gt;worth gp
---
Go on, have a guess.
---
Ty, a good mini-guide!
---
I have no interest in safe instance pvm and I still "have" to go do safe instance pvm to get bis items and the best profit in the game.
---
The Runelite guys are communicating with Jagex about these changes and will remove the plugins themselves, so you don't have to worry about it
---
It was brought up in QA streams, they don't want players hoarding them, don't remember why.
---
So more people will camp the Larran's chests so I can't redeem my keys. Great. Atleast before I had a chance to make money with wildy slayer and escape with an emblem or two.
---
I used them yesterday for a whopping 3m to 500k for all it counts
---
Theyve flip flopped on it being world/wildy/etc specific a few times. The main point is wilderness on all worlds is very different from BH/PvP worlds. The normal world Wilderness contains a few camps involved in these polls rather than PvM vs PvP. 
---
Some people only PK to kill defenseless PvMers and dont care. Others pvp for fun and prefer to fight other pvpers. PvMers are excluded due to optimal inventories and setups, the meta was to just dinhs up and run until the unpolled nerf. But content keeps getting designed to lure us out into the wilderness like cattle. 
---
It just seems asinine to simultaneously take away PvMs best option for defense due to "integrity" and add even stronger weapons to kill PvMers with, which also would never be used by a pvmer. 
---
FWIW I've voted and will continue to vote in favor of PvP updates going to their own worlds. Regular world wilderness needs no changes.
---
Yeah I’ve actually planned on starting farming pretty soon, been watching some videos about it. It seems kinda complicated but I’m sure I’ll be able to figure it out. Honestly I don’t even really need the money from it but I do realize I’m missing out by not having the passive income while I’m skilling, which is less than ideal.
---
Nice!! Yeah I wasnt sure what is specific to certain phones.
---
Plot twist twist: This is part of a quest and so certification is required to equip the quest cape
---
Had me at pointer finger lmao 🤣
---
The goal of the wilderness isn't to create pvpers. if I wanted to stand and 1v1 people I'd go to a PVP world or play BH.  The wilderness is a balance of predator and prey and risk/reward content.
---
Fantastic thank you. I misread that as the Gnome village course so thought I had to do that quest first... I'll get on it tonight.
---
Slayer points LOL. And jagex pretends they're helping.
---
i want my 500 slayer points back &gt;:(
---
And instead of working on the problem you'd rather fuel the divide by making false assumptions. 
---
Hope you can adapt when you're forced into BH worlds to fight people who are actually able to fight back.
---
If you had actually read my post rather than just jumping on the PVP BAD train, you'd have saw I mentioned that. Those are updates to the wild, not pvp. Pvpers gained nothing from those, only the wild. All of those updates are why pvp is where it is now due to the divide the updates caused. So again, all we have gotten are those poorly made updates because nothing passes polls for pvp.
---
Rewards are cool, but if the majority doesn't like them... why implement them then?
---
I’m saying if they are going to joke-but-maybe-not-actually-joke about Clinton doing X, I’m gonna do the same about Trump doing Y.
---
Are you implying bots? That'd be one interesting botting method
---
The Dinh nerf is a whole different monster because it wasn't a limited poll, it was just a change Jagex decided to make which is why people were so miffed about it. I agree though, wildy content being added for PVM players gets obnoxious because it really is just more of the same "mind your business until people come, then just tank until you die or get away"
---
I believe that if Jagex makes PVP only weapons in the polls they should be for PVP voters only **if** it is restricted to PVP/BH worlds only but if it's for all worlds in the wilderness it should be an unrestricted poll as it would affect PVM players.
---
Just don't tell your parents and bring a sleeping bag.
---
Do players get refunded the slayer points used to purchase a rune pouch prior to this update? I had an unfortunate death almost immediately after getting my first rune pouch and I had to dump a ton of slayer points to get another.  Would be pretty nice to get some of those points back
---
I would make a new Gmail account, name it completely unrelated to your RuneScape, and ONLY use it for your RuneScape account Gmail. That's it. You'll never get spams or fished as long as you're vigilant
---
"My heart"
---
That’s some mighty fine detective work. Hate when people have different RS and Reddit names so you can’t look up their ranks.
---
Infernal or Sacred Eels?
---
Yes let's add cabbage robes and mud staff to BH store, weve fixed pvp. 
---
There is no such thing as pvp gear except maybe ballista. Which I'm fine removing.
---
It's worth noting they've expressed wanting to offer it from more content, that said they mentioned MTA which is one of the downright worst pieces of content in the game.
---
TIL 1.2m gp/h is trash.
---
Maxed melee double claw into scythe. I got b2b max his with the claws.
---
Might be a case of detecting player direction angles? I think you rotate towards the person you report. Not sure though.
---
Thats what I expected it to be, Thanks! Time to start theory crafting.
---
If the D-Pick is 1/5k from KBD, i‘d hope it would be around 1/10-20k from Zalcano. 
---
As for the wilderness being the best money I agree to an extent.. while there should be the best rewards for the highest risks, I don‘t think PvM belongs in the wildy but since it does.. 
---
They should have released revs to be roaming and not in a cave. The deeper in the wildy you go, the better loot. Rather than just L.35 wildy for the highest level rev? They could‘ve made them roam  north of the ‚F2P‘ gate and given the revs a chance to cast teleblock. 
---
Instead we got a ‚Nieves wilderness cave, where you take 0 damage as long as you wear a bracelet.
---
Great thank you.
---
That is a whitest person I've ever seen.
---
Agreed. I think the GGs need an additional unique of some kind as well. I would've liked to see the granite maul handle go there but that went to BH.
---
Personally prefer the Combi-CB but y'know tomato tomato
---
Awe bro 😩 that was literally my thoughts exactly before today. 12 long years it took, hope your day comes soon.
---
Reddit is crazy as fuck. Filled with tons of pvmers no reason for u to get downvotes besides someone being butthurt bc they refuse to learn the game
---
At least the ratios are improving
---
When has this sub spoken out against PJ timers?
---
Swapping between the games is allowed but be careful.

I have heard oakdice is good but have never done it myself.

6T has PIP, even the OP3 has it

Ah nice. I found it in OP's reddit name.
---
They ban thousands of bots a day 
---
Thousands more are made everyday 
---
Idk how you guys don’t seem to understand this lol
---
Old
---
IMO if you want to revitalize the wilderness add content for pvp not pvm ... Whoever had the idea that forcing playing into the wildy for drops or skilling wouldnt revitalize pvp was poorly mistaken.
---
Hop worlds in draynor til you find bob in the old mans house
---
I feel for you but you had 3 weeks! Why did you drag your feet? I started my grind 3 weeks ago and finished 2-3 days ago
---
I did the same, saved att str def and slayer for last. Never had a negative comment about how I didn't have 99 slayer yet. Quite the opposite, some people noticed and were saying how nice it must be to be done with every other skill except slayer and combat. Turns out I started my maxing grind as a slayer person, throughout the year long grind I didn't realize that I started really enjoying skilling, because when I was done and only had atr str def and slayer, I didn't enjoy it much and wish that I still had non combat stats to level up
---
Big congrats to you! I hope to someday be there
---
The concept of two individuals engaged in  simultaneous oral sex is rather humorous is it not?
---
You can see interplayer interactions through developer mode(when there is an interaction but not what it is) so I'm sure the bots can tell when a player is interacting with them through this. That's how but for why I have no idea of guess to try get away from being mass reported.
---
Herb runs and whatever level varrock diaries and the easiest and lowest effort income. If you can plant whiteberry bushes you can pick them over and over without replanting the bush. Planting limpwort roots is also an underrated way to increase herb run yeilds
---
😍
---
Completely agree, maybe he didn't have fun with imp catcher, but many eons ago when I first did it, it led me across the lands, searching far and wide and then a dark wizard got me.
---
And like 10 on f2p karamja, nearer the volcano.
---
i am using runelite with setting "chat timestamps" enabled, but its not showing timestamp anywhere.
---
was using osbuddy before and it was adding timestamp to every message in chat. is it bugged or something im missing?
---
Well it was a nice discussion tbh but yeah agree to disagree
---
The line for me would just have been to avoid PvP areas being the only way to obtain an item because of my view on the wilderness (being used for PvP) along side the whole ‘if you don’t want to get PKd don’t go in the Wilderness’
---
It was and my timing sucked, got to 900k points as of last night and started Monday last week, I was just not able to devote any time to OSRS in the two weeks prior, so not at all Jagex's fault.
---
I'm just saying they could have allowed archaic emblems another week whilst telling us in today's update post that they would be removed on X date. Rather than pulling them and not converting our points.
---
If the dust wasn't buffing the cannon I'd be okay with it.  Honestly I don't even like them as a reward at all, I'd prefer the cannon just be left alone.
---
No, I just got my 100th account recently. That migh be my friend King Awzyn.
---
What should his rc level be then
---
Not exactly but I made a spreadsheet that calculates your "shortest path" to a given total level goal. It uses Excel Solver optimization so it has some quirks but it's still pretty useful and does what you described.
---
They do but it was limited edition so you'll have to find someone who would sell it to you
---
I think so, I got them pretty consistently just ranging them in the lumbrige area. Using darts is really fast if you don't want to usea  cannon.
---
I have the Wildy 4 sword and I go there frequently, and I have never pked; I feel like I should be qualified too
---
Do you mean wherever you rotate the arrow, the amulet lights up only if the arrow points straight North?
---
You have saved me time and money thank you king
---
By trump*
---
Hang around the anvil in west varrock and world hop that's how I found him, took a few worlds but managed in about 5 mins
---
Definitely not mistaken as without wild bosses the wild would be even more dead then it is now only pvmers moan about wildy bosses while PKers think they are a good idea
---
Totally agree. I don't care if it's more "efficient" to just go use the GE, not every struggle should be resolved with a trip the GE.
---
Even though it was P2W S1 and S2 were so good, the learning curve was insane(unless you were kai).
---
Sorry if this is a leading question but would you vote yes in a poll that made the Tomb of Fire an extremely rare drop from the Chaos mages?
---
Many reason realistically. RS3 has become a lot more complicated. RS was built around simplicity. The combat system is complicated and the ways to level doesnt result in accomplishment with the amount of micro transactions that  can practically level yourself with no effort in addition to the endless amount of ways to level with 3x more exp per hour then OSRS. Accomplishments just seem greater is OSRS
---
Whats so funny?
---
The very first thing I did on my maxing gring was get 99 rc. I thought that if I got the worst out of the way it would be easy after (hence why I left slayer for last but that backfired) I started enjoying blood rc and agility instead was hands down the worst lol
---
If you're risking more than a spade during a wilderness clue, you're doing it wrong.
---
Thanks for giving the back story!
---
Rune dragons are only an example, sorry if that wasn't clear somehow. The effects of this would go far beyond just rune dragons. As I said, it's a change specifically tied to the value of rune.
---
Vorkath, KBD, Gargoyles, Grotesque Guardians, Skeletal Wyverns, Alchemical Hydra, brutal blacks, Skotizo, jellies, hard clues, gauntlet, Zalcano, superior nechryaels, kurasks, etc etc etc will ALL lose value alongside pretty much anything that has a sizable number of rune drops. The list goes on much farther than that.
---
Wait, I've been absent playing wow classic they polled the dmm weapons?
---
Excellent strawman. I never said you shouldn't do that. Don't get me wrong, I think this tattoo is pretty horrific, but it's his body and he can do what makes him happy. Your statement however, was ridiculous.
---
All third age and gilded is beyond achievable, sadly.
---
Damn I really wanted those ghostly robe revolves added :/ most of the recolors weren’t praised but everyone I talked to liked that one
---
X D
---
I'm arguing about whether or not it makes the content easier which it isn't it's already easy just making it more efficient to do
---
What happened to the godsword special attack recolors that passed the poll? Are they in the game and just not mentioned in the update post?
---
So uhhh... can people who bought the rune pouch for 1250 slayer points maybe get 500 slayer points refunded? Similar to how people who did architectural alliance before the rework still got to grab the 10k xp lamp? Feels a bit shit to have spent so much time boosting for points when the requirements were going to be nearly halved later on.
---
There is so much wrong with this. 
---
PvP is the smallest community group and it’s also the most toxic. Jagex could give 101 new updates to the wilderness and the fact will still be that no new players want to PvP.
---
Go play a private server if you want crazy PvP updates because it’s literally wasting money for Jagex to do it. I could see some long-term updates, especially regarding integrity and maybe a piece of content every couple years... but your post takes the cake for unrealistic suggestions.
---
Its okay. They can just be used in pvp/wildy. Also gloves have/had hard reqs on them now. Anything would just be updated to have the hard reqs. 
---
Hurt pvm profit? Sure i suppose a little bit. But... we’re talking about making things fair. Theres no end game wep or armor that comes from pvp. And thats partly why i think the communities are split. Pvpers got to do everything but pvp is optional. So im going full separation route. But im not opposed to full integration either.
---
Doing the quest "normally" and selling all the duplicate beads is an easy 10k for a new account, also it should only take like 15 minutes
---
is that fortnite?
---
I use carrack armory 3 and it seems to work pretty well.
---
&gt; was to switch the primary way of getting rune pouches from wildy slayer and pvp to slayer shop
---
But why would that ever be a good idea if you need a new rune pouch after every single pvp death while you never lose it in pvm?
---
Rip :(
---
No and no.
---
Clue steps can easily go down a route that stays south of the ditch and the clue hunters would be completely fine with it. Their game doesn't really change. The PKers can't really get what they're after outside of the northern wasteland. 
---
Clue hunters use the Wilderness in spite of the PvP mechanics. PKers use the Wilderness because of the PvP mechanics.
---
?yunnuf os s'tahw
---
Appeal it saying you were hacked, you can always do that even if it's an unappealable botting ban.
---
That's kind of ignorant for someone to say. When it comes to majority opinion and community-driven updates it's your opinion that hold little to no weight.
---
Thank you! 😊🙏🏻
---
This update is honestly hot garbage that is just made to be flashy and new, so when people try it out and content creators have something new to make videos about it you can put that boost of activity down as a success for your annual performance review.
---
Stuff like KBD and mage arena been in the game since forever. It's in the wilderness to make it more difficult and to add a certain risk to it (the risk to die to other players). It's honestly a really cool mechanic/design choice if you think about it that way. A lot of people nowadays don't like the idea of risk vs reward though.
---
Yes there would be no “food chain” without pvm and skilling content in the wilderness and would be truly dead. As much as people hate on that model I think it works quite well because as you improve at pking you tend to move up the chain. The alternative if there was no food chain would involve willingly jumping in to drown in the deep end until you suddenly learn to swim
---
Just do lavas and don't look back.
---
Dang D:
---
&gt; Pvp (and Settled) is what shows up on YouTube for rs related videos
---
Recommended related videos are based on your personal viewing history, or the viewing history according to the cookies in your browser. I don't get any pking videos suggested to me because I don't watch that content.
---
I should, but I also kinda like the look of my 1/1 RC
---
Zmi is slower but takes like no attention so you could do other stuff and just casually get xp.
---
Top tier suggestion. I’m all in.
---
I laughed way too hard at this.
---
But everyone in f2p is already slapping goblins
---
[deleted]
---
Those arguments sound like nothing a person that actually pk's would type out. Like /u/altF4Ded said already, this is really just generalizing an entire group of different people.
---
Also, why would anyone that occasionally pk's be in favor of removing the entire wilderness? This really makes no sense
---
Dont fail its simple
---
So you can watch your friends steak?
---
Considering the origins of runescape had PvP enabled everywhere and a heavy focus on it, it seems like whether they belong in osrs or not is a subjective opinion, I feel they're fine (Maybe not the current weapons proposed from DMM as you say though)
---
The feeling I have is that with how some of the players seem to feel about being *'forced'* into the wilderness, no matter how well balanced or minor an upgrade would be proposed for PvP, it would fail due to these players, hence why they're proposing a polling participation requirement.
---
Thsi problem is relatively evident in itself if you look at the fact that only PvM items pass the PvP content polls and by a tiny margin, and even reasonable suggestions for niche/heavily requested pvp items such as a magic-spec weapon or even just general changes such as f2p teleblock or spell effects don't pass.
---
MTA is literally just 98% bots, 1% people unlocking bones to peaches and 1% ironman grinding infinity boots, mages book and masterwand.
---
Its such a bad minigame.
---
"amagine getting a clue from like a god lol" -Crazypete3
---
That's what I was thinking is just really give it a shot
---
You'd be better off just doing agi on your main while getting the reqs on the alt, RDs on the main are a pretty big waste of time on your main if your goal is to make gp with alts. Also keep in mind that double astrals and double nats blow bloods out of the water in terms of gp, and it's pretty easy to do those methods while doing the bankstanding skills/agi on your main. Nothing wrong with your plan if that's what you want to do, just wanted to offer a possible alternative to keep in mind.
---
Fortnite stealing our shit now? leeching cunts
---
Dmm is all outlast. They aint overpowered in osrs
---
&gt;Not even going to bother if you can't see the blatant anti PvP sentiment that is present not only on this sub but that is also clearly visible in the poll booth.
---
Im not arguing that there isn't, I'm just saying that not every pvp poll is a good poll and not every no vote is a spite vote. Most of the first LMS poll passed. The 2nd LMS poll was no'd out because it was a fucking garbage poll.
---
&gt; You people literally voted no to making scorpions/skeletons non aggressive in BH worlds lmfao
---
I dunno anything about the scorpions, i havent voted in or paid attention to any of the bh stuff because it only affects bh worlds, and tbf, i dont give a shit what happens on bh worlds. I know im not alone in that sentiment. 
---
&gt;You also voted no to an emote automatically playing in LMS
---
No, it would automatically play upon killing a player **anywhere in the game**, not just LMS. This is not fortnite. If you wanna taunt kids after a sick pk, feel free to use any of the available emotes in the emote tab.
---
&gt; the team has finally acknowledged that toxic spite voting is a problem 
---
They've also started to realize that pushing people with no interest in pvp to enter pvp zones to do non-pvp things is not a healthy path to continue down and are attempting to address it as an issue. 
---
If you can't understand that people don't want more powerful items/methods for pkers to kill them with, and that game-wide rewards shouldn't be locked behind pvp, then you're right, we shouldn't bother continuing this discussion.
---
I'm having a blast. The amount of customization options for your gun makes progressing a lot more fun than back in the day. IMO, its the best in terms of game play. Some guns are OP but hopefully that'll be fixed in the future.
---
You're one of the reasons why there is going to be a kill cap before you can vote for PvP updates. ZzZ
---
Just like ring imbue scrolls that could have been added to LMS; the only people that ever need multiple scrolls are PKers, but apparently it devalued the endless hours of NMZ grinding that this community seems to love.

I agree but you are also the reason why we need kill cap on PvP updates.
---
Not really, the people responsible for that coming in are the ones doing the spite voting. Either way I don't consider adding polling participation requirements bad (Plus they may not require kills, maybe just being in the wilderness, or engaging in combat whether or not you fight back?)
---
7* lol
---
If you don't PvP you don't get a say so, that's how jagex is going to start looking at it. So, that being said. Looks like you better start pking on ya main or build a pure.
---
I hated ZMI. Honestly I hated doing it for the first few days. At some point I realised I did ZMI tor 2 hours straight and I didn't even complain. I don't even follow the people when running to the altars. I just zoom out and click near it, feels more afk that way. 
---
I heard lavas are the same. It's click intensive but once you get the groove, it's not as bad.
---
&gt;  dangerous pvm and skilling is a staple of the wilderness and is at heart very well designed content
---
It's inherently not well designed content. There is no counterplay to being attacked by a PKer while doing PVM content in the wilderness - the game's inventory system makes it such that you're not going to be able to fight back against somebody geared to PK you if you're doing, say, Callisto. The lack of counterplay turns the entire experience into a frustrating RNG-fest where kills are determined by random chance - freeze catches, teleblocks connecting, logouts during combat - these are not good mechanics, and they are the foundation of wilderness encounters.
---
Essentially this turns the wilderness into an area where you're rewarded for doing content at the lowest activity periods. It's incredibly frustrating feeling like I'm wrong for not using my bones at the Wilderness altar as an Ironman, and as a result feeling like I have to do my prayer training at 3am on a Tuesday morning, or kill Venenatis at 1am after getting home from work just to ever have a chance at a dragon pickaxe.
---
There's nothing interesting or compelling about cat and mouse gameplay. It's a miserable experience for everyone involved except for the person who gets a rise out of making someone else's gameplay less fun.
---
There's a reason no other game has a region similar to the wilderness in OSRS. It's because the wilderness is not good content, and if the game were designed today, it probably wouldn't exist. People only think they enjoy it because of nostalgia goggles.
---
PVP updates need to keep going in the direction of LMS/DMM. There's interesting counterplay, high skillcap/apm and dynamism to all of those gamemodes. Support that, get rid of the miserable aspects of gameplay that the wilderness creates. That's the only way you'll create a healthy PvP community in OSRS.
---
How? 11,200 said they don’t belong in OSRS. 5000 said they don’t like PVP. Voter turnout for the poll was slightly under 40,000. That is 1/8 people who voted flat out admitting they spite voted the polls. And who knows how many people simply voted no and then voted “ they don’t belong in PVP” or skipped the question. 
---
That’s a big problem, and if you can’t see that, then I don’t know what to tell you.
---
Except for a new player these shitty beads are pretty expensive.
---
I’d argue that PvP has dissolved into hunting people that have literally zero interest in participating in PvP but are enticed by the updates that focus on pulling said people into the wildly. 
---
PvP has moved away from its roots of fighting each other to see who wins for fun, and has become Jagex developing new content to get PvMers to risk going into the wild for PvPers to prey upon. So much so that many PKers seem to avoid others that look even remotely like a threat. Why hop worlds looking for a fight when we can just hit up Callisto or Revs and attack easy targets?
---
Instead of designing new ways to get people like myself to actually want to learn and participate in PvP, they constantly come out with high gp or xp to entice me to risk losing my gear.
---
There’s very little to gain for people like myself with zero experience to try out actual server PvP, and that doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon
---
Have you tried inferno? It's like half the time and a fraction of the costs with a better cape I think too just a few more waves
---
If Venezuelans can do it you can do it.
---
Not that I'm aware of. I'd imagine a lot of the tasks are getting specific drops/gaining favour/doing certain activities/completing the diary though.
---
Yeah we should really help them

Do your achievement diaries and use every lamp on rc and don't forget tears of guthix.

Yea I guess I am on here to have worthless internet point to validate my existence. That does really get me going.
---
Barrows get a iban staff or salamanders
---
&gt;  But for every person who voted fairly there’s many other who didn’t.
---
This is a categorically false statement. You are framing the situation as if there are a few non pvpers voting fairly while there are "many other[s]" voting unfairly. Completely disingenuous and destroys whatever point you were trying to make.
---
If everyone that said they did not like pvp in the poll had voted yes instead of voting no, the other questions would have STILL failed.
---
Not saying im in favor of the limited polls per se, but something needs to be done in order to allow some pvp updates to enter the game. 
---
Also, what's the pvm use of a dhins exactly, except for some very niche applications like raids 1 speedrunning? It was mostly the mage defense that got nerfed, iirc.
---
Exactly, though I think suicide is where I'd draw the line as objectively bad. Life is meaningless but as far as we know it's all we have. So while there might be no difference if you were a doctor or a shut in in life, there is a difference in if you are alive or dead. As long as you're alive there's more to experience, good and bad. The same can't be said if you're dead. So protecting your life should be seen as objectively good.

how do you get looting bags and rune pouches if you dont do bh and die like 10 times a day at pvp or deep wildy? you cant buy them ad having to farm bh points for em is a no for me.
---
Mining and smithing are mini game skills now days. I would say it's in a nice spot, I would say the only thing it's missing is that smithing needs more utility items to make.
---
You only need to do one round with prayer to get enough points. Alternatively you could do an easy rumble with food instead (with easy bosses that don't hit too much).
---
Cabbages?
---
So currently, there already exists a system in which players can just fight with the exclusive intention of PKing each other; pvp worlds.
---
If that's the means to your end of people engaging in mutual pvp, then why even have a wilderness?
---
Inversely, if PvP worlds were gone so people could fight with each other in the *actual* wilderness, one devoid of PvM content, what is the purpose of the *rest* of the wilderness beyond Edgeville?
---
It's my assumption that players in-general do want a wilderness to exist, and not just some box for them to fight in, but if we go down the road of avoiding "cat and mouse" type content, then do you think the rest of the wildy should be for?
---
That isn't to say you're wrong about "cat and mouse" being bad, I'm just curious what you think the rest of the wildy would or should be used for in lieu of that.
---
Did they get the level reworks or is Rune still in the high 80s of mining and smithing?
---
&gt;	If you are a non-competitive PvM player who wants nothing to do with pvp, why are you going there? There are other bosses, other money making methods, other skilling areas.
---
&gt;	The Wilderness is a host of many powerful bosses, who are able to drop rare items that can't be obtained anywhere else.
---
🤔
---
"I don't like PvP" is also vague. Because the number of skips on ancient warrior weapons is 40% higher than on other questions, it's also reasonable to assume many people who don't like PvP skipped those questions and put that as their answer while voting no to a separate question.
---
Additionally, the final question itself was vague because it had no guideline for players who skipped every question. A player who skipped every question very likely would skip every question because they don't like PvP.
---
Basically, no, this doesn't prove spite voting is a big enough factor. Jagex was just shit at wording things again.
---
Okay? That doesnt contradict what i said at all

I like the RS3 system, and it's a pretty good money sink. When you die you appear at deaths office where you can choose to pay to receive your gear. Everything is priced with a "tax" and the tax is higher on expensive items.

That's not what bothers me. I'm 99 all, so I snatch mvps 80% of the time anyways and get plenty of loot. That being said, I like coordinating with my team and we both know most of these guys are gold farming. A sudden influx of people who only speak Spanish doing one of the most profitable activity in the game and we shouldn't suspect anything? [C'mon son.](http://i.imgur.com/yI6cqIU.png)
---
Thats some damn good luck!
---
Move rev cave to 55 wildly and make it single way combat, and multi on the sides, where you can easily avoid. This makes mage bank super popular as well as the obelisk and lever. You can even make the drop rate of items higher if your in multi. Revs is the only popular spot in the wilderness and it's in multi. This could be a start.
---
Credit to Faux on this idea.
---
Correct. You had a few weeks- you are now too late unfortunately.
---
Blp i think fits better for Blobs in the inferno.
---
So basically you have decided to drastically nerf looting bag? It was supposed to become _TRADEBLE_ but now it its impossible to get trough trading. I do not understand what you have against pking community this is getting ridiculous.
---
Clearly! Wishing that I could coordinate with teammates that understand me is too much to ask. See? This is what I meant by "we can't have a reasonable conversation." You're not even trying to understand my point of view, let alone the complexity of this situation as a whole.

My melees are 91/93/91, 97 HP. Range, Magic, Prayer 99. 99 Herb and 86 Farm. Shit at bossing and never touched a raid. Would this place be a good fit?

There's little to no coordination at Zalcano, though. Not sure how you are coming to the conclusion that it is a shitshow
---
This is correct.
---
&gt; **Removing pvm and Skilling from it.**
---
Then may I ask what's the point of having the wilderness at all then? The core reason why pkers show up at east drags, chins, wildy bosses, revs, Larran's chest etc is because that's where they'll most likely bump into other player, be it pvmers or fellow pkers with the same train of thought. Pvmers have an incentive to enter the wildy, and wherever they go pkers will follow, creating a so-called hotspot. You may not like this system and think it's flawed, which is perfectly fair, but that's the premise of the wilderness and how it always has worked in OSRS. And before someone says "wildy had loads of pkers in RS2 when there were no revs, wildy bosses or anything", then imo the combination of casual, fun and honour pking (no 6-way switches and constant pjing) made wildy 12 years ago a completely different area than today. I don't think this state will ever return.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt; **Realistically, doing this will just show how small pvp community is, and the wildy will naturally die out.**
---
Yea because now there's not a single reason to enter wildy anymore outside BH. Should I wait with my acc at the Eastern Ruins and pray for a pker to randomly pass by? Then I'll rather go to BH or PvP worlds where I'll actually find other players. But the issue is wildy pking is very different to edge or pvp world pking. Entering the unknown in a lawless area where every pvp fight is a struggle for survival is something else than having a safezone 5 steps away. 
---
If they wanted to bring pkers into an empty wilderness then these pkers need reasons to travel and fight there in the first place, which would likely have been done through a series of objectives or goals for them to reach. It could quickly become very artificial if you know what I mean if the game tells you how you should go about things rather than you doing what you want wherever you want.
---
It's a really tough situation. I can't see a solution to the wildy which the community as a whole would agree on, whether it's adding more content, removing content, making pking more profitable, add roaming revs to some or all worlds or something else. It's also clear that the issues with PvP reaches beyond just the wildy, like recruitment (steep learning curve, expensive to learn etc) and reputation (toxicity, clans etc.)
---
**TL:DR:** Removing skilling and pvm from the wilderness would also remove any incentive to go there at all, making it a huge landmass with neither content nor players in it. Trying to attract pkers only by giving them a reason to fight in the wildy instead of BH, PvP worlds or LMS would quickly end up with having a series of goals or objectives for them to achieve. This would lean more towards a minigame than anything remotely close to the current wildy pking experience.
---
I'm aware reading comprehension is hard, but come on now. Look back at my replies, I never replied to OP. That's not what this has been about. Although I think there should be some restrictions for pvp voting, I don't believe all pvmers shouldn't be able to vote. YOU replied to ME when I responded to a guy saying it's a waste of time for Jagex to focus on pvp and pvpers should stop bitching and play a private server. Now, either actually read ALL of my replies or don't bother responding at all, I don't appreciate you putting words in my mouth bud.
---
Nothing in osrs has had a lvl rework
---
69*
---
All right, let's poll a new skill but only let accounts with less than 16 combat but higher than 900 total level vote on it. It will introduce new items which just makes skillers immortal in the wilderness but hey, pkers have been shown to spite vote skilling updates like Warding so they can just go suck the fattest cock in the woods.
---
That's basically what this is.
---
It is when like 23% of voters always vote no. That means that every pvp poll has almost no chance since 23% of the base will almost always vote no. That means if other players vote no because they don't like the direction of the content or with a valid reason there is no way it will pass. That's why pvp polls are always around 66%. 23% said no because it's pvp and another 10 didn't like what it was. That's not fair.
---
People are generally capable of empathy towards what is mean to be a fairly major part of OSRS. But the way it is people vote no because they genuinely hate the other side. The best way to go about it would be for Jagex to find a way to make PvP inclusive again cause it has been min/maxed and stretched so much that even learning the basics just isn't worth it to most people.

But the alternative to me is worse. I wouldn't do any quests if I had to go around to stores to get basic things.
---
No idea why the GE doesn't have a fee though like every other game and real life. Would encourage trading again when doing lots of stuff since you could save/make a little extra.
---
Probably because you're used to bad groups? Good groups will call out their remaining tephra so they can dose how many they can/should use before the demonic symbols phase, they will coordinate to share 2nd Golems if a first one has been claim and much more.

Often Public script bots get banned within the first day of their creation. From there people use private scripts or a service like ridz. They can usually avoid bans for a week where usually by Friday a bulk of them are banned.
---
The people who like make their own scripts they don't sell or something more creative are the ones who last the longest and go unnoticed. Sometimes manually training before botting. These are the ones that rely on getting reported.
---
Usually the most common method is suicide bots. You just make a shit ton and hope some make it through, these are the ones that get banned at the end of the week. They usually train in three different spots before hitting the stats they need to farm gold at blue/green dragons. For instance you'll find them training on the crab things in the security of stronghold before they get the stats to kill green dragons. Then they will have a day or two to make money and transfer it off before they get banned. If one gets banned they just make more so they're in a constant state of training and farming. 
---
A lot is being done to combat botting, it's just a natural evolution of things for things to evolve and get better. I'm not sure just throwing more money at it is going to fix it, it's not a problem that can be solved over night or potentially ever without removing free trade completely. The other end game option is to encorperate botting into the game itself and sell it as a service. Many mobile MMOs have "autoplay" as a feature for their game.
---
If we want to stop bots like they say you suggested there have to be big changes that will effect every user, otherwise preventative and banning script patterns is the best we can really do. Go read some botting forums if you're really concerned it's pretty grim for them over there and I would say the osrs team is doing a alright job.

Its just not new players. But yes,, Its more exciting. Hence why jagex feels pvp is worth saving

I don't like the concept of removing pking from the game and putting it elsewhere. I think pkers killing others gathering resources is a valid part of the wilderness.
---
Now we're making the distinction between deep wilderness pking, and honor fighting that you are probably most familiar with. Deep wilderness pking wouldn't work in a different enviorment because in part it's supposed to be a organic fighting ground. No rules, no safing or level brackets you have to pay attention to. You just kill people and use whatever you can to kill them. 
---
The wilderness updates did work, and they do their part. Removing the Skilling content and the pvmers from the equation is just going to result in a dead wilderness. No one going to deep wildly pk if no one's there.
---
You can say that pkers that want to fight other pkers would go there but it's not bounty Hunter world, there is no incentive. The incentive with deep wildly pking is that slight hope that's always there that someone will forget to bank their stack of coins, or brought all their gear to a Slayer task because they had a lapse of judgment. 
---
Bounty Hunter world's, and Pvp world's are WAAAAY different from deep wilderness and just because theyt pvp doesn't mean they act the same way. Pvp world's are huge and open like the wilderness and people only fight in two different spots. When pkers fight other pkers it's with honor fighting because we know the game is broken, and we work around that by not safing, and no arming, ECT. Wilderness pking only works because you can smite, and over head prayer without asking. They're completely different enviorments and you can't just swap them around like they're interchangeable and expect that logic to follow through.
---
If you used a cannon you probably wouldnt be crashed
---
The thing is, there is no type of balancing to get rid of the skill gap. I can tell you don't pk by that statement (no shade or anything intended!!!). The skill comes in from fakies, gear switches, prayer switches, spec timings, and footwork. You can't balance that, it's skill. And I personally don't like the argument, "you still end up running into people that'll make you look like a monkey". That's in every game, there will always be people better than you. Like i said, i lost 40 fucking mil learning how to pk in the wildy. If you can't handle dying repeatedly, then pking in general isn't right for you. On the plus side, in LMS you dont lose anything when you die. Only suggestion i have for LMS (aside from reworking the rewards, but they'll never pass a poll), is an elo system. That way, the matches would be balanced slightly better
---
Bulwark is broken against melee and range. I typically pk at chins with whip defender d boots b ring(I) melee switch with claws and literal level 105 Venezuelans with dhide and bulwark can tank you for several minutes by straight running south with pray mage. I shouldn’t be hitting 80% zeros against someone that level with that tier of gear when I’m maxed

Same but I wish that the “regular” way was better for some skills. Like mining your own ores and smithing them to make your own armor and weapons. Or mining your own rune essence to make your own runes to train magic.

---
Didn’t realize this till just now, kms

That's understandable and one of my replies to you, i acknowledged that. I then said, if you're going to type out a relatively long reply to someone, you should at least know what they're talking about in the first place. That was my point as we got further into our discussion.

That's what I did, next was empty too. :)
---
Inb4 people complain about how new content is put in the wildy.
---
Listen. The content thats put in the wildy always passes polls, spite voting actual pvp changes like last poll always happens. Jagex needs a way to seperate the polls, one for pvp, and one for when pvp content is in the wildy.
---
I feel for the plight of Venezualans, but it is not Jagex's nor the community's responsibility to allow violations of the game rules to allow them to provide for themselves. They should 100% be allowed to play the game, but if they turn around and RWT then they break the rules and should be held accountable like everyone else would be if they RWT'd.

Im 3 days late, but lmfao. 2007 version of you walked past al kharid mine to do that
---
Right, and if you follow this line of logic, then there is really no solution. If we are going to continue to put pvm content into the wilderness, then everyone should get a vote on content that affects the wilderness. That has been the central idea behind everything I've said. My last post was an alternate proposal for those who do not feel the way that you do. 
---
My point, again, is that excluding certain groups from voting in wildy-related polls does nothing to solve the problem. It shifts the imbalance to the opposite extreme.
---

As a student i find it pretty easy to avg 6 hrs a day ngl, public transport is like 2 hrs for me, prob afk like 1-2 hrs during class, then its just play 2 hrs in your free time 😁
---
Yea there's nothing wrong with the wild, just people mad they die in the no rules part of the game. But people also complained about getting killed in sea of thieves
---
Yeah I tried learning one rotation. But cant seem to figure which one is easier. Also not good at switching gear.
---
someone said too that instead of smelting the steel bars its more profitable to buy steel bars and make cballs? which is better?
---
Did you download a fake Runelite?
---
On the bright side, that'll be great when you go for 200m ranged

Supposedly he resides in Barbarian Assault

I would stay at lvl 1 in all skills, let my group achieve all 99's, bask in the glory of the team
---
Scorpia, KBD, Choas Ele, Herion, Beaver, Phoenix, skotizl and got Golem and Guardian final push to max! :)
---
So much skill to not have 99 HP already. Wow
---
I heard he got caught up in the Colombian drug trade. Real nasty stuff.

Clue scrolls in the wilderness are the worst form of wilderness content and I am all for PvM, chins, dark crabs, and chaos altar etc. being in the wilderness.  Clue scrolls are lame as hell in the wildy because it forces a lot of players to regear(let's say you stopped your slayer task to do your hard clue).  That's annoying for that player, and probably 99% of the time they literally bring nothing to the wilderness so there's basically no benefit of a Pker to kill them.  Wildy steps for clues are just god awful content.

Mudkip and his UIM series. I genuinely get sad when he doesn’t stream at night

One of the best I think. I love it.

Never!

---
Sadly not many want to try to learn the meta because they’re not defending against predictable boss mechanics, so it’s outside of their comfort zone.
---
Yea I mean there would certainly have to be some sort of pj mechanic with this along with skulling too. Would have to involve something like entering combat with X enters you into multi with X and Y if X and Y have a contract. If that were the case then attacking either X or Y first skulls you but both are free to retaliate.
---
As far as theme goes, I don't really know the god lore that well so yea whatever is fine.
---
In terms of the actual physical guild, I was picturing something like the farming guild but the different wings are decorated in theme. So the guards and charges would be in the same place, but the contract board would allow for easier matchmaking.
---
Xp rates are pretty bad tbh, like 30k/hr
---
Skill and will power!

Mage, Ranger, and Warrior (others train mage somewhat for the def and teles, but only the main mage goes beyond 80 ish)

Gathering skills split among all 3

Production skills split among all 3

Warrior gets all bones first

We need either skill overhauls or major engine work next year,, mod Kieran as a conductor riding a train set zoomed in following the train move around for the whole keynote at runefest.

You do realize there's minimum requirements for voting right?
---
bruh i merched the shit out of those beads. supply and demand buddy. 
---
but nah, tbh the best part of runescape was when we could scape inefficiently and have fun. 
---
now, it's all about BIS and max efficiency and it makes it unenjoyable. i still play tho despite the nuisance of the grind
---
I think it's more along the lines of acknowledging that the current player base is now 30 year old men and not 10 year old kids that need to be protected from profanity
---
That's exactly right. You always wanna fight someone better, that's how you learn, but they can't be so much better that they stomp you in 3 seconds. And hell yeah man! I don't really have any resources. Nothing YouTube or reading a post can teach you other than the basics. So here they are-
---
Main thing to focus on is prayer switches. Prayer reduces 40% of incoming damage from the respective skill. Protecting your hp is always better than higher dps. All it takes is one big spec/bolt proc.
---
Second thing, you'll have a whip, USE IT. Not enough people use the whip in lms, they try to hybrid instead. Whip can slap 40s if they are off prayer.
---
Third, make sure you know how to combo eat with sharks-karambam, sharks-brews. Good to combo eat if they get repeated big hits.
---
Fourth, get your offensive prayers on before doing your gear switch. You want them to have as little time to change their prayers as possible, but you also want the correct offensive prayer on while you hit them.
---
Fifth, Dont sit in robes. You're incredibly weak in them. Can easily get k0d by a spec even while praying melee.
---
Sixth, dont get discouraged by someone safe spotting you with a tree. Wear your tank gear, get out your cbow, and focus on prayer switches. As soon as the freeze timer is up, try to freeze them so they dont have the opportunity.
---
That's all of the basics i can think of. They also aren't in order of most important, except for the prayer switching one. That def is the most important. Dont stress over it though. Obviously try to do well but recognize it won't be incredibly quick. Play a game or two and find one thing you want to focus on improving. That's how i did it at least. I focused on getting my prayer switches down first, them moved on to gear switching. Only worry about treeing and dding when you're better. I'll dm you my rsn if you want!
---
More granite based weaponry would be cool. Maybe thrown hammer and a melee weapon charged with (tradable) granite dust. I’d like the idea of a granite lance. Maybe something with marble like the superior? Marble weapon hilt that improves granite hammer and/or long sword to compete with d scim. There’s a lot of possibilities for them
---
Thanks for the suggestions!
---
&gt; you literally have to entice and coerce non-competitive PvM players into the PvP zone and serve them up on a silver platter just so that PvPers have someone to kill
---
That's not really the intention of this system though.  I think pretty much everyone agrees it has some big problems currently, but conceptually speaking ("at its heart" as he said) it's not inherently bad.  
---
It's not about "serving up" PvMers to be killed.  That's just one part of it, and it shouldn't even be a problem because they should be getting something lucrative out of the deal as well, like they do at revs.  What this is SUPPOSED to do is create a "food chain" in a location.  You start the food chain at the bottom, with the grass - PvMers.  You entice them with a profitable or fast method of getting something done.  Once you have the grass, the grasshoppers come - people out there to snack on the easy targets to make money.  Now that you've got grasshoppers, here come the frogs, who don't really give a damn about the grass but want to take out those easy grasshoppers.  Then come the snakes, who are mostly out here to catch some frogs in this new ecosystem.  Now the hawks have figured out that somethings going on here, so here they come around to check for snakes to grab.  
---
I wouldn't say they've ever pulled that off particularly well, but it did work a lot better in RS2 than it seems to today.  In my opinion, the major issue here is just a tuning one - an issue of numbers, not of concept.  In RS2, stuff was worth a lot more, relatively speaking.  A pk of a glory and black d hide was actually fairly decent, fairly worth your time.  Today you might as well just leave it on the ground it's so worthless.  So, I think it'd work a lot better if a lot of the numbers got shifted around a little.  Create something (or rebalance existing things) to do in the wilderness that gives very good profit but that you also really don't want to die out there with - 80k risk of black chins before banking just isn't cutting it.  Then totally rebalance the cost vs effectiveness of some of our gear, on both sides of this equation.  Black dhide, salad robes, etc. are all way too good at what they do relative to the risk they provide, which is basically zero.  Give us some new things to wear (or again, rebalance existing things) such that if you want to live (which you really do, in this hypothetical), you have to actually risk some value, and equally if you want to kill people, you're gonna have to bring something good.  By starting the "food chain" out with some higher-value stuff going on, the whole system should become a lot better than what we have now.
---
And a spell/grammar checker wouldnt hurt either
---
Right but the point is, there is no reason to assume. Fucking read lmao
---
I want to skill and stuff but I can't really raid so I'm essentially fucked.
---
Lmao honestly that's fair, wouldn't be surprised either!
---
Why is it that you think PvP is terrible? I agree with your initial points, but saying that PvP mechanics aren't effective is shortsighted imo since we have direct evidence of the opposite. Osrs is old as fuck and pvp has always been a huge aspect of the game, where you see people creating multiple accounts just for them to explore different combat brackets. 
---
Removing the wilderness was one of the first updates that started to kill the game back in the day. If PvP wasn't deep and engaging then no one would have had a problem with that.
---
I think you're getting a few things mixed up. Not every player is going to identify with PvP in this game not because its bad, but because it doesn't align with their vision for the game. A lot of people don't view osrs as a high intensity game, they play it to chill out. And they've done this for years. One of the greatest aspects of the game is you can play it however you want and you'll probably never run out of content unless you play an unhealthy amount. They don't have to enter into the PvP scene to feel a sense of fulfillment from the game, and there's nothing wrong with that.
---
These people wouldn't be drawn in by the addition or change of mechanics. And you'd also risk losing the people that do commonly PvP.
---
I know you're kidding, but Settled is one of the most sincere people I know. He could milk it and release more filler videos, but he genuinely enjoys making content that people love.
---
YOU GUYS CAN BUY THOSE BEADS FROM GE? WHAT THE FUCK? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT UNTIL NOW!
---
Bruh just imagine getting 200 m slayer xp
---
It's not really a big deal. Like it's just a few lines on your skin, you can always have it removed. Besides, as someone with a few tats I don't think that having a a regretful tattoo is that traumatic.
---
Issue with pvp is clans and the high skill gap between new pkr and old pkr. Also getting in pking is really hard since you pretty much have to make and train pvp account.
---
Also forcing people in wilderness will just make non-pkrs hate wilderness and pvp updates more and more. 
---
And lets face it you cant fix these things.
---
If you say his name three times in a row, your socks will start sliding off
---
Sure if you see this everyday. . . once a lifetime and its more like that "something epic is happening and I've gotta get up to speed feel." Then you chuckle and go about your day.
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
I'm relatively new to the game itself, the majority of my stats are in the upper 40s, except for my fishing, cooking, mining, and smithing, which are 60, 67, 63, and 61 respectively.
---
Combat level?
---
I think you can empty the contents into your bank
---
I was very clear in my replies about what i was talking about. It's clear you ONLY read my reply and OP and made assumptions based off that. Not the person i was actually replying to.
---
Another update to discourage an inexperienced PvPer to ever try to start.
---
sounds like ironman is something for you, i prefer buying my essences, but like the slower and more chil methods for ruelnecraft8ng way more than teleporting around all the time running lavas or whatever the fastest method atm is
---
Wildy clues are the biggest pains in the ass are you kidding me?  Throw everything in the bank, pull out dds/blowpipe, spade, and clue.  Teleport with lever, run north, cut web, run west, keep running west, run west past mage bank, south, cross shortcut, go through agility lap, dig at clue spot, kill idiot, dig again "new clue, DIP then dig...  Finish agility lap, cross exit, east, north, east, east to mage bank, lever in, regear.
---
As opposed to
---
DIP, teleport to house, use fairy ring, click, dig done
---
You're a clown.
---
Btw wildy clue steps should be removed from the game, the only reason I would think they shouldn't is because of ultimate ironmen and hardcore ironmen that would probably bring bank to the wilderness if they were feeling frisky enough to try their luck at completing a wildy clue.
---
The only tradeable ones are the OG items, like the three colors of Halloween masks and pumpkins. As for all the other cosmetic ones you unlock, sadly no, they are not able to be traded.
---
That's a little bit of a dream world, don't you think? Work takes up way more time than 8 hours for example (commute and lunch). If you want to call runescape a hobby I won't argue you but to average 7 hours of anything throughout a year is not a healthy habit.
---
Your first part is only true if you disregard RSC when it was the only version of the game.
---
OP for jmod

Good lord

Are you upset your salad clan couldn't kill one shieldy boi?

Legit every Australian world has a 4 man that just spam “hop men, hop” at this point I just latch on and do it anyway, if they start speaking proper a english I’ll sometimes leave, if they start saying shot like “c como y esta idiota” etc. I just crash and steal mvp. It’s incredibly frustrating, I seriously hope one of them doesn’t make a bot script, it’ll be over at that point
---
Nice lure
---
At least you'e getting some rings, I'm at around half your kc with 1 Berserker, 1 Warrior, and 1 Dragon Axe (that I got within my first 50kc). If I didn't have the elite diary done I wouldn't even be breaking even.
---
Of course you can PK outside the wilderness. PVP world GEs have a thriving PK community, full of willing and happy participants. And fun fact, the duel arena isn't just a casino! You can actually fight other players there!
---
Yes, if "what you're after" is attacking helpless players as they run away, you can only find that in the wilderness. But then you need the participation of other players who will run away from you, and those players get to vote.
---
GE was the death of the game
---
Yeah a pvmer idea on how to change pvp. Cool story bro. It’s about time Jagex takes control away from you fat fucking iron dweebs
---
That's basically what I'm saying, but people see "Spanish" and "Venezuela" in my post and they automatically assume I'm Trump &amp; Hitler's even more racist uncle.
---
bro 😎💪
---
I’ve prob done 1b rs3 to OS. Good rates, fast service, and legit.
---
Perhaps something similar to the CoX raiding chest "Private" bank and then a shared bank
---
probably just because slayer makes you big money, so why save it for last when that money will help you with herblore/construction/etc
---
My point is that if adding content that makes people participate in pvp activity in order to do the content they WANT to do is the best method Jagex can think of to keep pvp alive, then pvp isn't worth keeping alive at all in it's current state. People should participate in pvp content because they WANT to. If pvp were designed well and Jagex would address the many glaring issues that pvp (particularly, the wilderness) is plagued with, I and many others would be more willing to actually engage in it.
---
jagex helpers are not jagex employees.
---
I see 2 or 3 people,  I stay. They say hop, I turn of Public chat. I'm never the 5th guy though, that's rude
---
All at mlm?
---
You asked for an explanation, I gave one. If you wanna keep typing angry paragraphs at me go ahead I’ll keep laughing.
---
“I don’t wanna die in the pvp area so I’m gonna vote to make that happen.” That’s pretty much what you are saying is ok.
---
I wouldn't mind 8 or even 10 damage, but that may be a problem for pvp.
---
Cause you have an hour to pick it back up
---
750 slayer points my man
---
That's my fault I typed it up on mobile. I can separate it
---
Can anyone else pick it up within that hour?
---
From like 83, yeah
---
well, yeah, that's what I said. I just don't think comparing it to Cerb is any of any use. While they should be way better than just camping normal gargs, they also shouldn't be anywhere near as good as Cerb is
---
Multi zone is pretty much always centered around clans. The collective mind of Reddit (from what I observe) is mostly pvmers who genuinely wouldn't step into the wilderness for the sake of PvP but would rather just have the rewards that are out there
---
I will spite vote your kind from now until the end of this god forsaken game
---
They reduced the slayer point cost not the gp cost
---
Pvp
---
So JaGex just hates girlfriends haha
---
and what was the explanation? and what would leave you to believe that my words are "angry?" I am giving my opinion back with what I know and think, just the same as you are.
---
So what is it with gold ore?
---
I’m not saying I disagree, but I am suggesting a way for them to poll something and exclude PvM players.  You can’t exclude someone from a poll that impacts them.
---
lol running out in 3 items doing a clue doesnt count as pvp
---
Tons do it with 1 so
---
My first temp mute came from me telling my friend (through pm) that I made all my money from armor trimming. Was like super obviously sarcastic about the whole ordeal. Dude reported me for encouraging rule breaking ;_;
---
The wilderness was never for PvPers even back in the day it was Edge, Varrock Multi and Mage Arena but Mage Arena died when it changed from a Ladder to a Lever. It's always been about killing PVMers: Rune Ore, Mage Arena, KBD, etc. You're just butt hurt that you have to learn to Anti-PK and don't want to.
---
I keep trying to get my friends to play but they get bored in the early game because they've done all that content multiple times before but they aren't willing to stick around to get to mid game which is the most fun in my opinion.
---
If you can do the twitch prime trial, do it &amp; claim another 14 days of membership. Level up your stats in the meantime then try to do different type of moneymakers when you have less than a week of membership

Just so you know, for whatever reason in the future if you want to change  so that the F Keys function is normal F keys, and the function key will allow you to control the volume etcetera there is a way!
---
When you boot up your computer open the BIOS screens, there is an option in there to toggle the function key. I know you already switch them with runelite but just in case you're ever curious
---
No, after that hour it disappears for everyone. I'm pretty sure that back in the old days it was like a 1min timer, and that after that people could pick up your stuff
---
Do you think it's good design that clans camp the total level worlds and essentially just farm gp to sell for real money? Is it good design to have the majority of all activity take place in one single location that can be scouted with bots? 
---
Not saying I necessarily dislike revs entirely, but tbh there's some serious issues that jagex doesn't really seem to care about
---
sorry for taking an eon to reply. i dont reddit good. 
---
you get crafting xp when you cast glass make and you can then blow the molten glass for more crafting xp or sell it for a profit as the spell is pretty cheap to cast.
---
Not viable because of hitpoints. Only one could do combat
---
I came from League of Legends which has by far the most toxic community that I have ever played with so this seems mild to me.
---
I turned some into bars unfortunately.
---
Reminds me of playing before GE though, this quest really was a pain in the ass.... When an imp would tele just before I killed it (low lvl), and getting scammed for the beads, it used to be a pain in the ass for low lvl players hahaha. Good times.
---
Got mine at lvl 92 last year doing hops

still my only pet
---
I wonder what the chance of evil chicken outfit is if you pick up every nest going to 200m wc
---
&gt;because you idiots make suggestions as retarded as this.
---
How is that suggestion retarded?
---
Everyone constantly crys about how multi clans only hunt pvmers instead of fighting eachother and how several spots are constantly filled with clans, yet they shit on pure clans who want a low def world so they can clan at normal warring spots like gdz without getting crashed by mains 5minutes after logging in. 
---
And then next week there is another ironman complaining about dying while hunting black salamanders because hes in the middle of a fucking pure clan war.
---
Damn boy, I need Addy bars rn, might go get some MLM done! What do you think is better first, the extra sack (Ow,o) or the upstairs?
---
The wilderness is a pvp area and you should know the risk and expect to be attacked. The PvM in that area is not meant to be easy. You also shouldn’t expect to win the fight if you are PvM geared vs a PvP player.
---
And your wording makes you seem angry or at least a little upset. The connotation is pretty obvious if you would like to go back and read your previous messages.
---
The wilderness is not solely a pvp area. Jagex has stuffed it with a ton of non-pvp content (some of which cannot be done/acquired anywhere else in the game). Again, my issue is with the idea that I shouldn't get a vote in a poll that directly impacts me. You're taking what I've said and moulding it until it fits what you want to talk about.
---
Did they forget to capitalize can?
---
Lok that's so funny
---
I'm going to still do it. Mainly for my own enjoyment and because although slayermusiq is already doing something similar mine is still different. I'll be doing it on a UIM and I am restricting the order I do my levels. Whether anyone wants to watch is entirely up to them.
---
Upstairs all day.
---
*Keeferz has joined the chat*
---
hit me up if you wanna play sometime
---
how do you know he hasn't gotten a quest cape, all his hard diarys completed, and kourend favours?
---
Upstairs, full prospector, then upgraded sack.
---
Oh wow. I wonder why they made that change.
---
In an ideal world, people would self regulate, it's not realistic to expect the current system not to breed clans &amp; opportunistic ez kills. And as always the solution isn't to lure more non-pvp players in... It's to make solo pvp more appealing. Change the system and the players will follow
---
honestly it would be annoying for me as everything in the list would end up being yellow.
---
So why are you not doing zulrah or vorkath, or fighting other pkers? All of which should be better rebuilding options than looking for ez targets
---
It really depends on what type of player you are, some people really enjoy questing and grinding skills out to complete a quest.
---
Others enjoy grinding skills first, making money, and then doing the quests on easy mode.
---
It's not impossible I just don't think anyone really knows exactly what's the best way to do solve it. I personally believe if people where more accepting of how others played that we'd at least be in a good mind set to think about it and a community which we some how managed to do for a lot of the content that's put into the game, you know minus new skills and the obvious ones.
---
But yes when the conversation comes back around it all does come full circle and try to work with each other and understand more aspects of people enjoy from the game. The poll suggestion is still silly to me, it doesn't feel much like polling as much as it could eventually start to feel like using demographics to pass specific content.
---
Like I could understand the want for poll specific content because the community on Reddit seems to genuinely hate them sometimes, but I don't think that's going to get that nail on the head content that we are looking for, as much as it is going to allow some new toys to be passed just staving off the inevitable. I also don't think the things we see and read on Reddit are exactly representive of how people feel or what they mean. I genuinely think a lot of people think it's funny to shit on pkers because of the brainlet memes. A lot of those same people probably watch torvesta and see him get loot like 30m in loot from someone doing clue scrolls. They understand why, they just think it's funny to make people mad on Reddit. Im sure there people who are genuinely mad too because they just want to do black salamanders or something and keep getting pked, and they probably also make a lot more noise on Reddit then they do represent a real community. Because that's what this sub Reddit is for, over opinionated whiny gamers to complain.
---
Howmuch money do you make now? Like per kill with spending the money on crates?
---
Not anymore
---
You can fucking buy them????????????? Years of academy training wasted
---
No, don’t disclude pvm players.
---
Set up a system were it requires x amount of kills to vote just like there’s an x amount of skill level to vote. Suuuuper easy 
---
It’s really simple, life rarely is hard in general it’s mostly stupid people being stupid. And in osrs case it’s stupid people who are bad at pvp, instead of getting good they spite vote to get rid of it.
---
There is still Hope
---
I would rock the guthix or Sara book because they were the cheapest to complete. I also loved the white of the Sara book.
---
Work towards higher farming and do fairytale part 1 for tool upgrade, then do varrock easy diary (aim for medium) and get kingdom of Miscellania going. Aim towards farming ranar weeds. All these will make you money on the background while you can enjoy the game. Of course you can focus on making money aswell but remember to enjoy doing what you like about the game.
---
It can be. And it could be your subreddit where you're the big dick mod calling the shots.

What’s the process for applying for memphership? I’m a zerker with 83 atk, 91 str, 93 hp, 94 mage, 89 range, 74 prayer, and elite void and all imbues. 130m-ish bank. Would you guys raid with me?
---
&gt; just join PvP worlds if you want to PvP 
---
Pvp worlds have a large level range where someone can hit you. A level 50 baby gmauler with 50 att/62 str/54 hp (levels based on leveling through normal combat) can be attacked by a level 63 "prodded" gmauler with 50 att/90 str/70 hp who can two hit him.
---
A spicy one with some paprika in (orange spice)
---
This would make me sad since skorpia is already a pk hotspot for farming pvmers and the only profit from that boss is the unique drops.
---
I'd still vote against changing them. The current system is fine.
---
I'm also against having separate systems for different account types.
---
Don't you need the same tier as your target to get their emblem?  Or just any emblem?
---
Wouldn't an OP spec weapon be _more_ overpowered in the main game? 
---
Also, perhaps I'm missing something, but why is outlasting viewed as an illegitimate way of winning a fight?
---
John Deere's are shit anyways.
---
Source: Own Case tractors
---
Yes, most defenitly!
---
it wasnt, they only polled rewards
---
emblem again motherfucker
---
Meh I did 601 venenatis kills, 1.8k callisto, and 1.1k vet'ion kills without safe spotting. If you gear up correctly you literally risk like 50k, keep prayer up and it's fine. Yes you do die frequently. But that's the point. They just need to fix multi zones a bit in my opinion. Also, learning how to anti pk at these bosses can make you mills. Learn to 1 tick, venge, and properly utilize the boss for more damage and it's not so bad. I do think multi zones are a bit extreme at callisto however, and venenatis its steps away to single so that's fine.

Med is a med level account. Typically maxed in range/mage/str with 70/74/77 pray for Piety/Rigour/Augury and 70 def so they can use pretty much BiS everything in terms of armor and prayer. Attack can be as low as 50 for a Gmaul and as high as 75 for an AGS. Depending on what attack you choose, you'll be somewhere from 100-108 combat. Super strong build because of how strong piety and rigour are.
---
Steak in the boot
---
Some people are paying $11 a month lol, but true.
---
&gt;  Like just go on Pvp worlds. 
---
&gt; Then "pvp rewards" are just boostable no matter what you do which will always be a problem.  If you are not good enough at pking to have over a 1 k/d you are going to lose money just how it works.  
---
Jagex wants to encourage pking activity because:
---
* pkers maintain membership on multiple accounts with different pking builds
---
* more pkers leveling accounts = more hours spent in game, which looks good on their metrics
---
* pkers are more likely to buy bonds to purchase supplies/gear
---
Well that's how meme templates work I gues.
---
That's like saying you want Skyrim to feel more like Morrowind then removing the quest markers, and fast travel, and you're like "oh fuck put it back" while I agree 100% with the sentiment with this post I also understand things have changed and attention spans are shorter. We're shifting to more 15 minute high dopamine experiences and enough loot boxes to get your rush for the day. If you try to play more after that the experience only dulls down.

It's a fundamental shift on how developers have veiwed the rewarding experience, and old school RuneScape is way to far in the past. Hell the game is essentially a 3d conversion of dungeons and dragons from like the 70's where you have to dedicate a while fucking day to get like a quarter of the way through anyone's playthrough.
---
Says you...

Congratulatory ass spank

If you’ve seen their other comments you’d understand why my assumption was he was being serious.
---
The guy who got the zenyte could give a bond to the Ironman. Use your brain bud

I'm a high-level main and have recently been feeling confident enough to try NHing for real in the wildy and I feel your pain, been hopping all day for the past two days and most of that time was spent killing Venezuelans tele-ing into Lava Maze heading toward Revs with the cookieclutter bp+black d hide/snakeskin setup for their ether and ethereum bracelets at 100k a pop. Although there was a range of hours where I starting running into proper hybridders, mostly max mains, but that was only for a couple hours. Didn't find anyone anywhere else outside of that kbd gate/Chaos Altar hotspot.
---
Anyway I've been looking for folks to practice with, PM me if you're down! I'm 116 cb lvl slowly working on maxing out my combat.
---
Gratz brother!
---
You really need to read my comments, i said im fine with the risks as long as i get to vote in the polls, if im excluded from the polls then i shouldnt have to go in there as i have no say over what comes into that part of the game and so cannot veto updates that make me more vulnerable.
---
Who said anything about fucking? They're cheering on their boy after a huge victory
---
50/50
---
Based off their other comments. Seems unlikely. Also if they are it’s hard to tell when that belief is widely accepted here.
---
Can someone explain, I had like 50 total emblems (archait or some shit) and i went and sold 1 tier 1 emblem and then everything disappeared from my bank (emblems)???
---
Sure it's exactly like what happened with Wilderness Removal if you forget to include a variety of other aspects of the Wilderness updates between 2007 and 2009, and ignore 80% of my recommendation. Depends on how you want to interpret "roughly" I suppose.
---
Additionally, I said PvP related worlds, not PVP worlds. PvP related worlds would include BH worlds, high risk worlds, wildy PK worlds. My suggestion also mentioned adding more worlds to this category - likely just more wildy PK worlds as those are generic.
---
Thanks!

Shoot for barrows gloves and 60 slayer. Maybe go for full void, or try and find a sustainable fun money maker like magic tree chopping.
---
.... and tell me, what is half of $11, aka the cost of 14 days and the specific length of time mentioned in this post that jagex isn't "crediting"?
---
Name checks out with text.
---
Yeah I think they would have to write this quest in as an exception just like the few other quests so we are able to get herblore up on Zeah. Otherwise no one will be able to complete the, "Elite Kourend &amp; Kebos Diary". They already made a few of the diary tasks completed already because we would be unable to complete them.
---
Not really. Wildy altar would be marginally more op, but the bosses in wildy are already outclasses by stupidly op shit like hydra and the relatively less op vork/zulrah. Raids are also more gp/hr but they're inconsistent and much higher effort. Black chins would be pretty good but still worse gp/hr than pvm, because of course pvming will always win. It's not like green drags aren't already botted, revs are op anyway and having pkers there doesn't fix anything (though removing them entirely is probably the best move...).
---
In short, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
---
You know they have a clan wars minigame where clans can fight uninterrupted? If you're organizing clan wars you can literally just go there.
---
It's like you say, going into the wilderness is a choice. Don't go in if you don't want to get attacked by other people.
---
He did it the OG way. Respect.
---
I mean if you end up only doing veng msb ags smite fights 24/7 it might be better the stay a zerker. If you only go rev caves, it might be better to stay a low level zerk to avoid mains. If you never multi pk staying a 60 atk med is a good idea. If you always multi pk a 75/70 or 75/75 build is probs best. 
---
Once youve got some semi ok stats, join a clan. Try different types of multi, try baiting and skulltricks, try BH, try pvp ge, try NH, do solo pvmer hunting. Try as many types of pvp as you can think of and get a feel for what you think you'll do the most, then base your build of that type of pking.
---
1. PKers camp the Chaos altar at all times, and you can't do wilderness bosses for more than a few minutes without running into a team. Your statement is verifiably false. 
---
2. King Black dragon was released in 2002, 2 years before Runescape 2 was even a thing, the year after the wilderness was released. 
---
On top of this I'm clearly talking about OSRS, not RuneScape Classic 18 years ago lol
---
There's a list of items you basically cannot just expect to finish...
---
\-Gilded
---
\-3a (minus ring)
---
\-Other select clue items (elites: tuxedo, ring of nature, lava mask; masters: ankou, mummy, dplate, dkite, bucket helm g, ring of coins)
---
\-Evil Chicken
---
\-Dragonstone armor
---
\-Imbued heart/eternal gem (definitely debatable) 
---
\-Jar of Darkness
---
That accounts for 140 of the 1372 current collection log slots to fill.
---
Interesting! I'm curious to see someone who does ~83-99 with them done now, to see exactly how much of a difference having the diaries done makes. "Slightly increased chance at receiving higher level ores" is frustratingly vague, and the grind to 99 would be a big enough sample size to get a reasonably good guess at how much it's actually worth.
---
Frozen throne
---
tbh its the first time i see someone with gnome pet
---
Between those 2, why would you not do the 44 prayer?
---
Make deep desert south of menaphos a new pvp zone
---
Oh my lord Jagex there was a WHOLE THREAD with essays on why the Wilderness is fucked. Instead of trying to fix the polling issue maybe fix the issues that created the whole anti-pvp sentiment. For example, there are BIS skilling activities such as Chaos Temple's altar and Black chinchompas in the wilderness.
---
Once alternative BIS training areas (locked behind a high requirement) are introduced, a good chunk of players will stop spite voting and start voting yes to pvp content since it would not hinder them. If you want to fix pvp you have to fix the reasons that non-pvpers were spite voting for. Then once you guys do that, it'll will be infinitely easier to revitalize pvp and get newer content for pvpers into the game.
---
So what makes someone who actively pks more qualified to vote on pvp content than somebody who does pvm in the wilderness? Both of them interact with pkers
---
There’s a common slayer strategy where Ironmen don’t complete dragon slayer so they don’t get bombarded with drag tasks.
---
How would that stop him from doing ds?
---
Jesus christ this makes too much sense. I think the angle Jagex are going for, however, is they want to incentivise hotspot PKing. They've done this by making it so you are free to fight people with lower tier emblems in hotspots, because they'll just drop the emblem when they die. I don't like how this is tied to killstreaks though, and that's probably the weakpoint of the whole scheme. If you die you are penalised through whatever you risked *on top of* being forced to risk a low tier emblem for your first target while you rebuild your killstreak.
---
It took me 15 minutes lmao
---
Dad Naruto ran and got ops mom
---
:) love seeing myself on reddit- free hong k
---
Insanely lucky dude my guess 1/100k or someshit
---
im pretty sure youre under drop rate for all of those rares tbh
---
Absolutely love this idea.
---
It literally has 0 mage defense
---
Very well said, I couldn't agree more.
---
I think they should provide some option, surely a good portion of the player base comes from there but I guess it comes down to how many bonds etc they pop and whether they’re just happy to cop other worlds. I hope at least for your sake it happens eventually.
---
Anyone else like to lure the vampire over to the farming patch before you tele away?
---
U r stoopid
---
Probably blew it all on puts
---
Sent it to you on GroupMe :)
---
I mean its probably one of the most common untrimmed. If you train slayer on a main you'll naturally get it first
---
He probably didn't do it so he doesn't get iron and steel dragon tasks while slaying
---
I actually think you get the drag task by STARTING ds not sure though
---
Who has time to make an alt that requires dragon slayer 2? Not all content has to be aimed at people willing to spend 10 hours a day on the game. As someone who started in april, Venenatis and Callisto are great money makers for me, about the same gp an hour as Zulrah (if not higher), which is also considered one of the best money making methods in the game.
---
I still do it even though my banks over 300m. Still got that f2p mentality
---
But that's the only way they can start the money making grind
---
Nice Addy boots loser
---
Rich get richer smh
---
How long did it take?
---
Barely noticeable but well done anyway
---
I was thinking slayer but just saw the glory+obby cape and thought not
---
How’d you guess?
---
"Son, this Runescape account was given to me by my father, and his father before him. And now, it's yours. Go forth and finish the collection log that we have been attempting to finish for over 100 years."
---
Why not both?
---
It seems clear that there isnt a great solution
---
Cancelled my membership some time ago because I wanted a break from the game. Seeing this shit regularly does not make me want to come back.
---
Should be doing 1hr runs with italy, maybe 50 without
---
Don't ruin the mans first experiences on runescape with the grand exchange
---
I just came back from a 3 year break as well. The game is way more refreshing now and there’s so much to do. I set long term goals like fire cape and have been grinding out nmz for imbues. I would start with slayer for combat and work towards requirements for the achievement diaries for skilling and questing
---
Stevie has feelings too
---
Pvmers haven’t got the heart for it you either like it or don’t pvp updates aren’t going to drag moaners to refuse who enter the wild into pvp. 9/10 PKers also pvm its the strict pvmers that don’t pk moaning 24 7
---
You can get it at any level same odds just lucky you man gz
---
WARDING OKAY
---
SAILING GOOD BABYYYYYYYY
---
&gt;You will never get what people want because different people want different things. Make good update for one group, two other groups will flood reddit with negative posts.
---
Which is why you look at legitimate criticisms from people who know what they're talking about.
---
Of those there are plenty about this new BH.  I'm sure once you get off your high horse you'll add some yourself.
---
How the fuck is dying in the wilderness to a lvl 126 hyper-brid with claws and AGS being dumb? Those guys are seriously hard to kill if youre showing up completely naked to do your clue.
---
That being said, you should bring a clue box anyways
---
None of the added stuff in the wilderness since OSRS's release is old school to begin with if you want to go that route.
---
Fishing to 99 only gives you 1m agility xp so you’re going to have to both regardless
---
Btw×btw^btw(btw..)
---
P.s..
---
            *btw*
---
To be honest; fury, zerker ring and blowpipe are quite a lot of money for those stats.
---
They're saying it SHOULD be 1:4 not that it is. I think it's fine at 1:1 personally
---
Depends on how well you do. You can make 1.5-2m/h im guessing (4 man)
---
Nerf or remove, whatever. I don't see the harm in at least an opinion poll.
---
I literally quoted myself, from the comment you replied to and you have the balls to try to say it's irrelevant because it's not part of my argument.
---
Nah fam im out.
---
Gz man! I completed Jad for the first time today as well!
---
My RD Alt got 11 limbs in the same number of kills...
---
Sorry I took your RNG
---
The Fe is silent.

You’re saying the wilderness is shit GP/hr? Are you not?
---

---
ah the classic "I don't know shit but I'm going to assume this random player got his own account locked then muted for no reason" Stop posting and looking like such a jackass
---
Lmfao
---
Can you not still buy rune pouch in the BH store?
---
I try to put them behind mages, I'll flick proc melee to run under them if necessary
---
Oooo I always wondered about this. Dds special attack always confused me - is it stabbing or slashing? But if it's slashing, don't I have crappy slash bonus?  
---
  
---
Dds' spec is now confirmed to be based on stab attack bonus offensively and slash bonus defensively. This makes it better than expected at skele wyverns, which from personal experience could be true, yet pretty bad against dragons in general, which also seems true. I've brought my dds to rune dragons before and can confirm the spec sucks even with all BiS equipment. Rune dragons have +115 slash def, but +30 stab def, so are perfect for confirming dds is a stab-slash spec if anyone wants to. I am convinced personally, though.
---
This is genuinely a very good idea. Having it as a rare drop from cows makes it a novelty item and a market to be created.
---
Not anymore unless you hoarded old points
---
What do the other effects look like?
---
I hear you're that loser basement dweller who spec tabs like a lil weiner bitch
---
I usually play with sounds yes
---
It's not something they can detect on their end. The only person who can truly know if a specific vote was made out of spite is the individual voter them self, and they might even be disingenuous in their evaluation of themselves in the first place.
---
Something we can say for sure is that spite voting to some extent does occur, though if it has ever effected the end result of the poll is something we can't have absolute confidence in. Making the assumption that a poll failed due to mass spite voting is an even greater assumption than assuming 1 individual spite voted, which we've already said the only person who even has a chance of knowing is the voter them self.
---
Basically while the stipulation of interaction with the content comes with the positive of removing most of the spite voters, it unfortunately does remove genuine voters who just don't happen to interact with the content but might vote no due to perceived negative impacts it will have on the game as a whole. (Which I think is something Jagex is willing to accept the compromise of.) There's also the large probability that this will even further divide the already fragmented community of PvPer's and PvMer's. While that's not a big deal on it's own, it will eventually make the wilderness less and less hospitibale for Pvmer's, which is already being done pretty well as it is. Haha holy shit what the fuck am I even doing, I haven't played this game in months.

I reckon I'll go for melee flicks on the zeks to run through next. Currently I run around them because they are spoopy.
---
If they end up doing a magic attack is there time to switch to magic pray on reaction?
---
I suppose it's also an option to stand exactly two spaces away so the mejkots get stuck on them, but that's also dependent on the n/s axis.
---
“Thats the joke”
---
DeuteraNOPEia
---
jk, I support some kind of change to this.
---
Do you think there is any hope to solve the root cause instead of focusing on bandaid solutions like restricting votes?
---
I ask this, because I feel like the more Jagex doesn’t poll, and forces decisions on players, the more the players distrust them.
---
It seemed like the gmaul update did more harm than good and hurt entry level pking.
---
Isn't that how the food chain works? I think a better way to put it would be this: You shouldn't be allowed to regulate the way someone else has to play the game when you yourself shall never suffer the same regulations. Non PKers having the vote of how PKers get to play makes zero sense when PKers have zero influence over the way you play. They literally don't have other places to go, PvP worlds are a joke. For them to PK, they have to be in the wild. So why should someone who doesn't PvP be allowed to control the way PKers play the game? My votes don't mean shit to the state south of me, why would they? It wouldn't make sense. Allowing polling for specific target audiences may be the best balance between PKers and Non-PKers if it was given a chance to be tested.
---
Gz
---
you prayed at the monnestery probaby and it boosts it a bit
---
Used a specific altar or boost.
---
This is my main, I was just greatly lazy, but I haven’t done it in a long time.
---
Oh cool didnt know that was a thing
---
You guys have RC exp right?
---
🦀We pay to PK🦀
---
Any change to one part of the game can potentially affect another aspect of the game in unexpected ways.  To deny one group the ability to vote for or against changes simply because they don't want "something" and never have doesn't make that "something" a good idea.
---
Jagex already adds "integrity" changes to the game when something they want fails a poll or re-poll questions which pass until they fail(by 0.7%).  Allowing Jagex to completely ignore groups which will likely feel the effects of updates is a decent way to get things like MTX or EoC
---
to be fair there's no much point to get 99 construction other than the (admittedly extremely good) cape. obviously like, 83 for a max house is amazing but beyond that more levels don't really do much. as opposed to prayer while although levels above 77 may have very marginal impact they at least do something.
---
100% support. 
---
Did they ever add a free skip to killerwatt tasks given the epilepsy warnings etc?
---
I like your stance
---
Thank you for putting the time in your original comment and replies. Puts nicely into words a lot of what I was feeling
---
Yea, they kinda ruined it. What made it worse is they failed the poll to have it tradeable.
---
I don't pvm but I feel you. I'm in a similar situation for looting bags, I don't Pk on bh worlds because 
---
1. Sweaty people (gmaul rush n tab) 
---
2. 300 ping 
---
Maybe they'll figure a solution out soon.
---
Ok cool
---
Real talk why is there a steel armor wearing whip wielding, dragon defender holdin sum bitch killing dem goblins.
---
Let alone the bot fishing in the background wearing lederhosen.
---
they hated him because he told the truth
---
ge was the worst addition to the game, change my mind
---
I have rc xp from:
---
Quests, lamps, fossil island lamps, tears of guthix and spending millions to combine boots.
---
Is there other ways of earning rc xp?
---
Cool man. You still play OSRS? We should get some bossing going together.
---
I seem to be getting a bit more rune ore since doing the diary for sure. Maybe a 50% increase in rune ores? Can't say much about the other ore quantities, but the more rune ore is definitely a noticeable profit increase.
---
Funny sidefact:
---
You could go way over your level, if you hit with the spec of the ancient mace☝️
---
its medium clues
---
I’m thinking Jagex might have a chance at not being brain dead though and will move the PvM content I’m here for out of PvP areas.
---
"We've... we've done it...
---
...shit those old men never beat the Inferno how much is Justiciar"
---
Well, they should balance it so everyone can't have 20 players on one guy first! That way when they nerf the bulwark it actually makes sense as a means to promote solo pkers.
---
If they nerf the bulwark first, singles clans are just going to have even less counterplay. Singles clans existed before the bulwark was introduced - don't forget that. The bulwark is being used as the counterplay to singles clans with the side effect that it is too strong for actual solo pkers.
---
Balance 101: you nerf the cancerous strategy first and then nerf that strategy's counterplay.
---
Mainly USA timezones but we have members from all over the world
---
Yeah, the d scim will actually boost his dps. Makes sense to prioritize that. D slayer has decent xp rewards at low levels, but if you don't want dragon slayer tasks it makes sense.
---
Just hop around looking for a 3 man team. Fyi, most 4 man teams dont appreciate you joining as their loot gets worse, but you can ask and 5 man sometimes.
---
If you are a pure let us know and we will wave that requirement.
