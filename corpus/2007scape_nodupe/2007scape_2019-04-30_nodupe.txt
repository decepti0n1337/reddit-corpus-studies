Like a savage, correct. I do use small windows if I'm watching shit though
---
---
---
Nibba you still gotta use magic to get the final product, correct me if I'm wrong but I still think that means getting magic XP alongside multiple other skills while still making 80gp every bow. From the way I look at it, it seems to be an ok method for training

Spitballing ideas here, what if the bounty store sold identical items that were made to have no alch value?
---
Bless your heart. This is as pretty as you are.
---
I was doing about 1,000 kills a week up until about a month ago. Lately I have been doing less, but still a consistent ~100 per day when I can. I get about 28 kills/hour when focused, so you could call that 430 hours
---
4 runners but you can alt 1-2, which is considered the efficient way to do it.
---
Iirc i got alot of them from farming contracts
---
This wins.
---
That's all.
---
It’s literal bug abuse too lmao
---
So you have no problem with other methods using runners?  Im curious what the xp rate is for lavas or other combo runes are normally and then with runners.  I imagine there will be away to get similar xp/hr and with how much it cost at ZMI, I'm sure the price cant go too much higher.
---
Afaik the nail beasts sound effect is bugged and plays 3x louder than anything else in the game on top of already being a horrible sound.
---
Hey a real answer lmao Ty
---
Sorry was wearing my slayer helm
---
Nah man, the LBS is almost as good!
---
I've never once used it, and I disagree. If people wanna spend ridiculous amounts of gp for good xp/h so be it. Speak for yourself on this one chief I wanna be rich in the game one day and enjoy the fruits of my labor.
---
Sounds like you should start grinding for pets, slayer helm recolors, etc.
---
yeah worth it, 10k is a lot of hits don't stress
---
I also 1-tick flick Slayer, and yes it's pretty forgiving. I'm pretty lenient with the 0.6s window and almost never miss.
---
But it's actually still above the skill level of a lot of people. It took me a few weeks to learn and it obviously requires focus to maintain it. The only reason I do it is because I can't buy more supplies, so I try to be extremely frugal with my limited amount.
---
I'm biased but I don't think flicking is hard -- it just requires practice. But a lot of people don't want to do it because it makes things not AFK. That's still not a good reason to remove it. It's not like Slayer is _supposed_ to be AFK. If you want to PVM "actively", then it's nice for there to be a method for it (i.e. Protect from Melee + Piety or whatever other combos you can think of depending on what you're killing and what you're using).
---
when the ghost moves instantly switch to next prayer
---
Mmm, your example would be closer to having a merch clan of 20+ people buy out every single daxe or something to drive the price up, which is also heavily frowned upon/discouraged by jagex afaik
---
Real Bwana shit
---
Yeah, fuck Runecrafting. I'm not selling my soul to the god of repetition just to make some chump change. There's a reason most people have RC as their lowest skill. Fuck. That. Shit. .
---
BRO NO WAY
---
I will not be stopping until I get my first one. =] Then a long break before I go for the other one. Thanks!
---
Also paying a clan an exorbitant amount of money to let you leech a fighter torso in a few hours

this is a joke thread but they really should add a 1-click teleport to duel arena and reduce the rate of pouch degradation
---
How are you suppose to have time for your newborn and 99 slayer? Do you not work? Do you bot? Do you afk while she's awake and grind as she sleeps? I'd like to know!
---
Regex &gt; Jagex confirmed
---
Perhaps the halo would work
---
well when you literally do the math incorrectly...
---
im going base it off 75+ so you have the good pouches. pre 75 is not relevant. 
---
75k an hour vs 180k an hour. 11.8m xp needed. 4 runners at 4m an hour takes 66 hours. solo lavas is 157 hours. 90 hours saved 1056m spent. 12m an hour. thats very reasonable, without alts. if you play alts it makes even more sense to buy runners.
---
people who are paying zmi runners aren't using an alt to run lavas for themselves, thats just you trying to be as dishonest as fucking possible with the numbers to make it look not so bad.
---
zmi is was very overpowered.
---
You can just call it that marine song, same meaning.
---
How else to play RuneScape other than numbing my mind to do RC :)
---
Ahh, classic Jagex. 
---
Patching something years after people have taken advantage of it. 
---
If you really thought this was a problem, why wasn't it done earlier? Makes no god damn sense like 80% of their decisions.
---
Wrong thread
---
You only need to kill one for it to count btw. Its happened to me a couple times. Because of this, you can also always force spawn them somewhere else if you don't like where they spawned the first time.
---
No, it's not. Your sample size is definitely a lot smaller than most peoples who are making 6m+/hr at ToB. Look at his sample size, 700, compared to your 150. Almost 5x your sample. If you're running ToB with less than 1m/hr then you're doing something VERY wrong. Probably dying 20 times/raid and getting cabbages nonstop?
---
Very cool thanks
---
Not to mention a 2 character name which are highly targettable.
---
He has said similar things for a very long time but  he clearly enjoys 2 tick pure ess mining more than pking
---
Trust Jagex to nerf it almost 3 years after release. What's the point lol? I've never seen anyone complaining about it.
---
?
---
yea i was going to use it at demonic gorillas because arclight is low and i cant be bothered to farm charges for it
---
yep im sure jagex can link a random reddit throwaway to one of millions of runescape accounts
---
Not sure we will get much but thought I’d ask. Can’t seem to find it anywhere based on those numbers alone. 
---
If we don’t get an answer I’ll set a reminder for myself. I’ll be 75 slayer by the end of the week and will do 20 hours of it this coming week or the next depending on time. I’ll report back if no one gives us a good answer
---
u can see me cannon in the pic?

---
I know what you’re trying to say. Your first comment did not make it clear whatsoever what you meant. Nobody does bosses for xp/hr so nobody would ever assume you meant anything other than profit. 
---
What I’m trying to ask you is why does less xp/hr than Abby demons make sire a bad boss?
---
Same reason pvpers are scum

If an update is polled to be a certain rate, then it ends up not being that rate, then it is not allowed to be in the game. The poll system allows players to choose what updates can enter the game so only updates that work as polled can be allowed. Corp or raids were never polled at x kills per hour, so even if people complete it faster than anticipated, that doesn’t demand a nerf.
---
What thread is it not showing on? The XP rates at ZMI one? Either automod is drunk and lazy again or it *doesn't* flair Jmod replies that are comment replies rather than top level comments (my comment here being a reply and yours being a top-level).

Granted, the reason that it's shit is probably cos it's popular. Doesn't change the fact that it's shit tho
---
What? They're only removing ZMI running. I don't see other click-intensive methods like 3-tick Barbarian Fishing, 2-tick teak woodcutting, 3-tick granite mining, 1.5-tick teak woodcutting, etc. being removed at all. 1-tick prayer flicking is just another thing on that list that has been in the game since the beginning and is not being touched, just like the rest.
---
Don't bother trying to explain... Just do what you think is best.  Had someone questioning why I was using BCP at demonics.  Asked them why and they said because I would have to pick up my darts lmao
---
Rip lol.

I definitely haven’t made a single strong opinion. “Not overpowered” is pretty neutral, I’ve even pointed out in this thread that I haven’t even stated an opinion about the change. My whole point was that the word “overpowered” just seems like an exaggeration.

---
You missed the one where he uses the one-hit-ko dragonfire whenever you look away from the game window
---
Sure. But the only content that requires flicking of any form is the Inferno, and even then it's only lazy-flicking, not 1-tick flicking.
---
I actually think that 1-tick flicking isn't that hard, but quite a lot of people do for some reason. It still requires attention IMO because if even if you can maintain a rhythm, it's important to pay attention.
---
For example, if you're in a deaggroed zone and are flicking a mob and someone else runs through the area, the NPC will aggro them and you may accidentally step out of your aggression zone if you're not paying attention.
---
This is especially bad in the Catacombs.
---
The farmable teak trees on fossil island have an extra layer of manipulation, where you can move to a different tile in between chops to basically double your chance at logs (and thus double your xp rate). Combined with herb tar or spiky vambrace 3-tick manipulation, this increases the chop rate immensely.
---
The difference is ranks on the high scores actually are competitive where as the bossing just isn’t as much altho I agree there is a clear distinction between what they consider broken and what most of the community do
---

---
This amazing. The more I stare at it, the more I realise all the minute details. Great job!
---
This is a really one sided generalization. I could say all iron men play to get admired by other players for playing alone, being that the normal account mode literally can do all the same content, and yet people still felt the need to restart (many multiple times) to play on the gimmick account with a new high score page
---
Yeah I like the extra dps
---
lol what
---
Yeah I mean you need 75 RC to get good pay rates for running ess, because of rune pouches.
---
This game literally doesn’t ‘need’ a single update.
---
150k is really really really relaxed for 4 runners though. It's the low of the low end for 4xing
---
Id like to know more, as well
---
I'll be honest: Is something like this even fixable? Like, is there anything they could do without re-writing the game from scratch to prevent it?
---
I don't think pray flicking should be removed until they make the inferno reasonable to complete without it.
---
How many infernal capes have you done?
---
I agree, though I'm sure people would pay that much or more if it means restoring their accounts. Personally I think maybe it should scale. The first time removing 50xp could cost 250k, with a 250k increase each time, e.g. 250k, 500k, 750k... all the way up to 2500k for the 10th use. This would lower the cost from a total of 50m for 500xp to 13.75m.
---
Thank you I think I understand, unfortunately regexr doesn't seem to support the (?!) so I can't test these to learn more but this is interesting
---
I literally had this problem when doing the Barcrawl miniquest like last week. I thought I was going blind for not finding the Pub
---
The real problem with this is alts imo. People want to play with alts and others complain they break the skilling metas. Jagex can’t make either side happy so they do what they can and nerf the method itself
---
Nah, you’re a fucking idiot. I saw no drama in his post, just facts, meanwhile you’re sperging out of your mind like a true autist because you can’t handle the fact that runecrafting is a shit skill. Fuck off.
---
You dont use the private instance for kraken?

there's a map showing the locations of each dig for the hot/cold clues for f2p

---
Shit
---
Watch his breathing lol
---
People have done no flick inferno. Its honestly no different than normal inferno if you want for sgs specs, just slower
---
Oh yeah that makes sense. My bad.
---
What you mean? People have been selling barb assault leeches since osrs came out, as well as other stuff
---
That’s very cheep. The normal rate is 3-4m/hr.
---
Kinda along what others have said, its an unintended part of the game. Sadly they made content around it so they can no longer fix it without changing other things in the game as well. I can easily learn it, but why? I dont like having to abuse tick systems, glitches or anything of the like.
---
Wait did they update the red graceful? It looks like a darker red closer in color to dragon items
---
Yes I do. Are you suggesting a study completed by one person is anecdotal? OP had a structured experiment and tracked his data. Just because it's one study does not mean it's anecdotal
---
What would u consider baseline gear for slayer at my stats?
---
Honestly right now i just wanted to do range related stuff til i can get the dscim
---
it was a serious question but whatever
---
No different from clicking your stack of nechs/smoke devils/dust devils or clicking your cannon as it kills dags and kalphites. Wew so engaging. Or by slayer did you mean doing garbage tasks like gargs and meleeing things down 1 by 1 while being 75% afk.
---
I don’t have either :/ I think gyazo is allowed, can you pm the link if possible just incase it isn’t on this sub. I sincerely appreciate getting back to me mate.

There's nothing wrong with playing alts. The issue is the rule they removed quite a while ago; that your alts could not interact with each other to provide benefits in training. You couldn't even log into the same world with 2 different accounts.
---
The biggest thing, is that anything you can do with alts, you can do far easier, and more efficiently, with just paying other people. So you're not really changing the meta by not allowing alts, you're just making it more expensive.
---
I got to naked until I realized you were bsing lol.
---
&gt; If that's not a frightening look into how passwords are likely stored
---
Stop this meme, pretending we're all IT experts. Jagex is a company bound by multiple data protection laws. They are not fucking storing passwords plaintext, this is a literal delusional meme by people trying to gas the fire for an invalid reason. At least point out real issues?

If you pay 4 runners with 75+ rc (4m each per hour) you can get 160-180k/hr.

Just killed a lizardman myself!  Boy what a rush.  Absolute savagery that was.  Pure adrenaline.  Holy shit what a rush.  No talisman though.  But boy what a rush.
---
Yea there aren't too many cuhhrazy 1m+ money making methods available for lowstat characters but if you're thrifty and pay attention easy 500k+/h is still doable. Recent topic relevant with rune running for other people though.
---
I remember when I made a fresh account a few years ago I made nearly 1m an hour at level 3 for a few days by gnome cooking stuff that was selling for 5-8k each until bots crashed my market. Then I started selling boozes and other junk for 1k each and was bot crashed again. so I quit that at 70 cooking and some numbskull on the g.e was buying garlic for a few hundred each for a while so I found a freaking unlimited supply of garlic in Draynor and was picking 500k's worth an hour for a while. This games econemy is hilarious and amazing if you're creative. One of my favorite parts of the game.
---
Recently I've been selling maple longs &amp; shorts to the Rimmingtonjob shop for 440 each on the ol iron hardly any competition, I string shorts and longs so I can sell my bows faster. G.E sells most of the bows the shop buys for half the price! Literally just load up your inventory and sell 5 of each bow and double your freaking money enjoy the freebie and don't ever tell me you can't make good money as a noob. I can just make this shit up by playing the game it's everywhere.
---
You can say the exact same thing about MTX.
---
Stopping ZMI: disable trading in a specific area
---
Stopping Barb Assault Leeches: a lot more complicated
---
Now you're punished for not camping justiciar and pray mage in inferno because prayer is more valuable than hp (blood barrage). Nice.
---
Demonic thrones were a thing before osrs release. This wasn’t. Construction is also a skill that revolves around gp
---
Doesn't max cape have all teles from skill capes? You know, like the tele to your PoH?
---
&gt; and prayer flicking
---
Personally I rather the price of ppots crash so flicking isn't "mandatory". I get people want farming to be profitable but it's kind of ridiculous.
---
&gt; Having exactly 1 piece of content where it is necessary is fine by me. As long as future content doesn't also require it, that's great.
---
Not a slippery slope. Remember how only a few NPCS have dodge moves? Then later on just about everything else have it. Who's to say tick-flicking isn't next? 
---
&gt; including knowledge of the tick system. It's not an exploit.
---
Being able to benefit from prayers without a cost using a manipulation technique is by definition an exploit. It's pretty much cheating in a sense. 
---
If someone found some elaborate trick to use dragon claw specs indefinitely in PvP without draining the spec bar, it would be the same thing.
---
&gt; I have nothing further to say because I think you are deliberately misinterpreting what I am writing.
---
I'm not.
---

Ironman Skilling Discord server recommends using alts for almost all slayer tasks. They abuse mechanics just the same.

I know, they're old, but it's at least a somewhat similar idea. Rcing has always had GP involved, running is also not a new idea.

---
Dude that kind of pisses me off. Why the fuck can't I be in the loop for once
---
Dragon weapons are ideal, obsidian stuff would be good, prayer and stat pots, a black mask, a cannon, cross bow with decent bolt. I mentioned the quests first to unlock the dragon weapons. By the time you are done them you should be close to using a whip. Other than that fighter torso, d legs, dragon boots, and combat bracelet till you get adamant gloves I think. Range: blessed d'hide at 70 until then best dragon hide you can wear. Get an available accumulator from a quest.
---
That's my point. The Inferno has to be tweaked in some way. 
---
The real skill involved is figuring out how to lure the monsters to the right place each wave. That and prayer switching the blobs. 
---
The only issue with it is you start overheads at wave 6, supplies will not last until 69 (let alone finish Zuk) without using the pray-flicking cheat.
---
If this content was in 2010-2011 in RS2, players would be required to bring a Beast of Burden to carry extra supplies.
---
They removed house training and now zmi running, the other thing is zmi running to get the 160k/h xp is really click intensive
---
i wont lie, I got given  most of it randomly. but the rest was from flipping  items in the background while skilling, drop parties, getting lucky at obor and oggresses.
---
Also i know its stupid, but doublers usually try and gain your trust after a few trades. But you just do it once and take their money and move on to the next one haha
---
Nice
---
Lol forgot to block out the clock in the back gg account
---
When you combine the max cape with any other cape, you lose all max cape abilities.
---
What are the advantages of removing prayer flicking? If your rationale is "it's unintended" would you support prayer flicking if they added a new button that you explicitly press every tick to counter prayer drain?
---
If you're mates with Mod Kieren, you must be a pretty cool cat.
---
Partially due to bots, but also the massive amount of mobile players coming in means a ton of low/mid level resources being fished/mined/woodcut/etc and coming into the game
---
Yes, complete f2p quests while you're f2p is what I'm suggesting. It is true that waterfall would help a bunch, especially with dragon slayer.
---
At the end of the day, the choice is yours. If you wanna be p2p badly, just go ahead. After all, you can do whatever you want to progress. Don't need to worry about efficiency if you're having fun!

&gt;manipulating game ticks people are gaining way faster exp then normal methods, in most cases they are doubling the avg exp per hour...
---
You explained what tick manipulation does, but not why it is bad for the game.
---
&gt; Also by manipulating game ticks people are able to spec people for over 140 damage in 1 game tick, how is that healthy for the game?
---
Are you really calling timing attacks so that they all hit at the same tick manipulation?

The exterminators are fucking useless. They keep trying to kill the rats but they keep doing no damage to them, they're powerless against rats.
---
Currently it's dead content but they're probably going to find a way to make it usable in due time.
---
Of course not. The whole problem with prayer flicking is that it allows you to use prayer without spending prayer points. Not simply "it's unintended." It would be like if you could press a button every tick and get HP for free. Even if Jagex made that an official mechanic,  it would be really really stupid. That's essentially what prayer flicking overheads is. You get extra HP (from preventing damage) for free. The whole game is about resource management. Time, materials, gold, health, prayer. Getting stuff for free without spending your resources fundamentally breaks the game.
---
aight now remove 3 ticking
---
Do you actually not realize that the game is subject to constant and rampant form of inflation every day?
---
The game is simply not well designed for that, especially with the knowledge people have about money-making methods and alch these days.
---
Knew it :(
---
What if we could just use excess marks to make it look... fancier? Unhooded, shredded Cape (similar to legends) and have the boots more pegasus-greaves looking as quick examples?
---
11m/hr and you get a 10-15min break ezpz
---
me too! i spent an extra 20 minutes looking for the stupid pub
---
Easy. Turning on a prayer automatically consumes one prayer point as a start-up cost. Now, rapidly changing prayers or flicking prayers burns through your prayer, while prayer bonus gear gains huge value since it is the only way to conserve those points.
---
1. The original runescape evolved to become runescape 3 over a period of time, and your old character is still there. Old school runescape came out in 2013 and no data was ported over, so everyone started on tutorial island.
---
2. Login names and display names are separate things now, you can change your display name to xyz789 or anything else but you'll still use the same old credentials to log in.
---
The engine of the game with ticks can't be changed. If they did, the entire game would have to be reworked, hence why prayer flicking and tick manipulation hasn't been touched.
---
Lol the capes are on the wall behind him...

In his jacket he has for sale some fine looking Jal-nib-rek pets.

It works with any visible boost that makes the number on the stat screen go up, including the weapon specs.
---
Because it is relevant. The cost offsets the higher cost rates.

I can't tell how ironic you're being.

Redditors always circlejerking over how idiotic they think all Redditors are, failing to see the irony.

In this case: a Redditor proposing to Jagex that Jagex doesn't take proposals from Redditors.

I don't get why people get angry about the suggestion of adding Curses, but then go along their days in Runescape flicking prayers.

Honestly dude imagine if you couldn't play OSRS ever without punishing any auto-typer you ever saw.  Eventually you'd have a day where you were just AFKing in the G.E. while getting some work done IRL, and you'd end up on Reddit with people calling for your deposition.

Guy who did the c-hally week here, to clarify it hit 10 players the same number of npcs it could and still can hit. Thats also the cap for barrage/chinchompas but the halberd needs special attack to be used in that way. Considering it was working as intended, it was a nerf.
---
f2p mobile player here, been playing for a couple days.  
---
The only quests I've done have been the cook one in Lumbridge, the Restless Ghost and the one with the murder.  I've been trying to do other ones but I keep getting...lost.  For example, I tried doing the quest where you try to join the thieves guild by stealing those crossbows.  Kat(?) said to go to the east to some fortress, but I can never seem to find it.  This keeps happening with other quests so I end up just wandering around the world.  Any tips for not getting lost?  I've been trying to use the map, but idk if I don't know how to use it or what, but it doesn't seem to help much.  Overall, I just don't really know what to do with how much stuff there is :s  I've kind of just been going around talking to random npcs.
---
Also, is there anything I can do with the dagger from the murder quest?  I can't really seem to do anything with it.
---
I saw him tank a couple mob hits. Did he tank a Zuk hit?
---
Its shit gp/xp and not fast compared the vast majority of skills. Also 180k/73k is not 3
---
Okay well, I don't want to mislead or misrepresent the situation.
---
Not sure how it takes 12mins? 
---
I know I personally had to make over 20 stews for a +5 con boost once.
---
But /u/BoulderFalcon  said
---
&gt; The 150k ZMI xp/hr also required near tick perfect efficiency
---
when in reality it's about as imperfect as you can get
---
You could maybe turn it into a zerker if you have all the quests done, but if the account isn't made a pk account from the start you're going to struggle.
---
Lol I remember you from zmi fc today
---
Muuling
---
You are my saviour
---
RS3 does this, so it likely won't get good reception as a suggestion here.
---
Thank you?
---
IMO they should release the content they want to then poll us after a month or two to see if we want change to it.
---
Never once did I say that pointing and clicking is a bad thing. I just said that slayer is also repetitive pointing and clicking just like runecraft. It's just infinitely more popular because more people like combat than skilling. That doesn't mean that skilling needs to be changed to accommodate people who like combat more.
---
You idiots talk like you've been somewhere in the world 😂 gtfoh mommy's basement doesn't count. Keep being brainwashed by your television.

If you had more money I would, you can mount a gloey and get teleports pretty early, which are the most used things. 
---
I'm not saying don't do con, con is great, but you don't wanna blow all your money on a stat that doesn't earn you money when you will need gear and supplies and more stats to earn some good gold per hour.
---
While I agree with the ZMI nerf I disagree in regards to playing alts. People actually play on their alts.
---

---
Could you elaborate on how I would struggle? My understanding is that my combat will be too high for my strength level compared to pures thus getting stomped. Is that right?
---
Would i be able to do thay with me stats
---
I think so just buy super anti fire and maybe super attacks and super strengths. Also using a stab weapon is good like rune sword
---
Basically, that, try looking at zerker guides and see if you can salvage that account build.
---
Life is not like the game, nor should it be like the game. They spent 5 hours doing top tier pvming in 1 hour because jagex lets them play on 5 accounts and trade all the money onto one account because they did a big fuck up. That is the point, should be the end of the conversation.
---
let me vote no to warding first
---
She should perk her boobs up then
---
Do you always fight so poorly?
---
ZMI affects a tiny player bass and was extremely heavily botted, they nerfed it because the exp rates they promised was 10x higher. That place is botted beyond belief. Essence running wasn’t banned, I swear no one understands this, ZMI was nerfed but you can still fucking essence run. The market will just move elsewhere, a handful of people were affected by an *integrity* change. Absolute ridiculous to now suggest nerfing 3t and prayer flicking? For what reason??
---
I haven't had issues on that world.
---
I think so just make sure to buy super anti fire and maybe super strengths plus super attack potions. Using the best stab weapon available will help which i think for you is rune sword. Also buy varrock teleports to escape from pkers
---

I believe there's a scroll you have to click/read after the quest
---
If you have a wily cat you can get a (4) spice of that color in about 60 seconds, and there is an 8% chance of getting a +5 to the skill you need. So in 12 minutes you can make 16 stews, you’d be pretty unlucky to not get it with 16

I don't think providing a "recovery code" for emergency uses when you first create the account that the original and only original owner would be able to know, would be all that difficult tbh. Might be easier than an authenticator delay actually.
---
magnum capes are the same size as regular capes it's all branding.....compensating, are we?
---
Imagine doing this on mobile. My firecape cost 4m
---
That is and has always been how the runecrafting skill works. Runners are not new, and fixating on the fact that the experience rates that were polled were based on solo experience is just a distraction. This is the logical result of the original update, as it was polled.
---

Lets nerf this thing 10 people use that was the most heavily botted rc area, that’s fine. Let’s all nerf a core aspect of the game that supremely affects the entire player base because I’m lazy

Now that this has been posted in the OSRS reddit, it does not matter anymore. I only did it twice btw, sold the unstrung for far more than its strung version when i got it at around 7 kc rune dragons 3 months ago and this week at 81 kc. You're right that it's pure dumb luck that I was able to sell it and even my kc are so low.
---
I was you a few months ago. Then I went for 1750 total. Then 2k total. Then all elite diaries. Now I'm closing in on 2200 total and then I'm maxing. Keep up the grind!
---
high level players spite voting low level players wtf? lmfao
---
Yes but the problem is they are trying to treat the symptom instead of the illness, spoiler if you try to bucket out a sinking ship without patching the hole.. it will still be sinking. They need to work on new ways to ban bots before they even get off tutorial island, because with the current system even if they only last a day they are bringing in 500k-5m per bot, and these people are making hundreds at a time.
---
Schweizer in the huus!
---
You know that would mean the chance to get it in 12 kills would be a fraction of the chance to get it in 1. See the problem?
---
This is nothing like free trade getting taken away.
---
I would wager the vast majority of free trials used are either bots or alts. I don't believe the trial can be used on existing accounts (correct me if I'm wrong)?
---
Wrong ep. That's Montage :)
---
100% a while back I suggested making slightly better by increasing xp rates with less runes or make it more profitable some how and everyone hated this suggestion. 
---
Everyone bitches about how bad RC is rightfully so but god forbid they try to make it somewhat bearable
---
How about no
---
Yeah you deserve these down votes as a pvmer tbh. Scammers =/= pkers
---
Zuk max hit is 251 dmg, you very rarely tank a hit from him
---
Still it's probably still less gp than is removed by staking each day
---
I said it once and i'll say it before, the current OSRS dev team needs to be flushed out (aside from maybe mod ash) 
---
Things are going downhill like Rs3 was.
---
Ah! The classic singing Torvesta before he started pk’ing.
---
Chinning on monkeys has higher XP than runners, while costing less. Yet they essentially promote this method, while they are happy to ban runners. I'm sure that if chinning wasn't so popular, they would be happy to ban it too. 
---
To me this seems like they're trying to crack down on these unintentionally high XP rates but at some point they have to acknowledge that for some of these methods the community backlash probably isn't worth it. If it were ocmpletely up to them, then all of these crazy methods would be banned. Runners are only really viable to extremely wealthy players so it's a safe bet to ban it without a lot of complaints. Chinning is way more viable for more players and would be a significantly more unpopular decision.
---
Because beyond this I'm struggling to understand why they're so selective in cracking down on these types of methods that get higher rates than they intended upon release.
---
prayer bonus gear should be the only way to conserve points imo.
---
This i support
---
0 gp hes the original owner. Or so he claims
---
Oh I get it, thanks!
---
&gt; Arguing against pray flicking or tick manipulation... Yikes.
---
I mean i don't care about tick manip when skilling as it doesn't affect other players. Pray flicking is more controversial as you are not suppose to benefit from prayer boosts without a cost.
---
Got 120 smithing in rs3 that way!
---
Same size as the towels that all the seniors decide to use at the public gym showers.
---
The difference between need and want for this game's community is very thin. This game will die out without updates, it would've died out a long time ago if they weren't constantly adding new stuff.
---
And if zmi ruins the integrity of the game, it should've be nerfed shortly after the release of it. To remove zmi running now is so fucking random I can't even begin to think of a reason as to why they would.
---
So you think the optimal strategy should be camping pray mage and justiciar (considering hp is less valuable than prayer due to blood barrage). You must be trolling.
---
People for some reason confuse long and boring skill capes with “achievement”, so reducing the amount of boredom you experience or RSI you suffer somehow ruins the game for them
---
This is one of the best rs pics I have seen! Great job!
---
Doesnt play enough for barrows gloves. Has 99 slayer.
---
Lavas are lower skill cap when running because there is downtime when running at maximum speed.
---
Perfect running at zmi is like 4.2 runners/crafter so with 4 runners, every tick counts.
---
Perfect running at Lavas is like 2.5 runners per crafter so with 3, you will always have downtime
---
Now jagex is gonna hotfix this xp method you asshole
---
How much effort do you put into making your money? Once you know the ins and outs of the game, running essence is just as little effort as any other money maker.
---
&gt;  The only reason I do it is because I can't buy more supplies, so I try to be extremely frugal with my limited amount.
---
If you don't have the required supplies, you shouldn't be able to use prayers indefinitely. It's that simple.
---
Hm, that's true. Unfortunately I can't think of any way to make 1 tick karambwans like 700k or something. Perhaps out of any skill, cooking is the most apropriate one to have a 1m xp per hour method.
---
I dont wanna underplay the problem, cause i totally agree with you, but i do think that a lot of ppl make the issue seem lighter/easier than it is. How can you pre-emptively ban bots, without collateral damage? Thats one hell of a task, in all fairness
---
Gonna have to check the math on that one.
---
No, they have a high magic stat, and higher magic defense then range defense. Plus, if you have 77 slayer to kill them, you probably have better things you could be using magic on, like dust devils.
---
Just getting into slayer but doing a bit of MLM for the quest Cape/hard diary. I'm about 60 nuggs off the full prospector set, is it worth hanging around for another 100 for the gem bag for slayer or other useful purposes?
---
 I'm not rich but not poor either so more money is quite welcome; jump back into slayer or stick it out for the gem bag?
---
High efficiency tob and cox are a damn sight more effort than banking, using an essence on someone, and trading someone.

---
zammy wines are pain, and i havent heard of any non 99 300k+ moneymakers.
---
2019 easyscape definition of good money maker seems to be a bond in 15min or less while being afk..
---
I can see where you're coming from, but having a skill practically impossible to train, and making it actually counter productive to train, is kinda silly.
---
Plus, they wouldn't need the whole 7x exp per bone, they could simply have some basic xp boost, and keep the risk, to make more pkers hopefully come up and breathe a little life back into it.
---
Problem is that botting just isn't fixable. Every single video game where it's possible to benefit from botting, has bots. It's just a constant game of cat and mouse, and the number of bot developers usually far outnumbers the number of anti-bot devs.
---
I don't think changing xp rates would solve it, it's still boring af, and then you'd also have a huge resistance from those who had already grinded rc levels and would sit sobbing "but muh achievement :("
---
imo something has to be done about the core gameplay first. Ultimately if it's interesting to do on its own, a lowish xp rate doesn't matter too much. I mean look at slayer, I'd be willing to bet half of people get worse xp rates than rc
---
IDK, f2p might be a trial but its the thing that's supposed to get you hooked enough to pay 11$ per month, a way to train an otherwise slow af skill is a pretty nice hook imo.

This needs to be at least polled. This is done using nothing but in-game mechanics and 1 out of 4 or 5 players doing it is the only one getting xp. This is the best money maker in the game other than pvm currently. Why take this away from us skillers?

---
cool but will this make my dad come back home?
---
i already said i average like 15+ kills, but my max is 29
---
kills per trip isnt really important when banking takes literally 30 secs
---
ur asking me for pb, but u havent stated yours...
---
you can do what you want, but dont claim youre set up is like revolutionary or something. youre getting that many kills per trip because thats how this boss is, you didnt find some amazing tank strat.
---
i guarantee you'd have better pb and more kills per trip if you focuses a little more dps.
---
It is. I'm debating it. The price paid for that exp rate isn't something that's worth it for any players except like 100? That xp rate you're going on is bullshit without context. Just like this change and everything you're spouting.
---
With that that def level of yours, i recommed going for 60att/70def/74 pray build. Train str,range and mage as much as you can and avoid training att and def for now. 
---
Do as many quests as you can, and try complete recipe for disaster quest early. You don't want to 'overlevel' your def and att so it's important to do many quests early.
---
[This page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quest_experience_rewards) shows all quest experience rewards, which makes it easier to not overlevel your att and def.

Good luck with the grind.

94 rings a bell
---
But not pumping out those rates to any average player... it seems that’s the glaringly obvious point you’re missing.
---
Mod Matt K. The guy in charge of the entire OSRS team
---
I'd say that being able to use altars is the incentive to buy membership
---
What if it has uwu?
---
This gives me a headache
---
What are the mods' stances on Dungeoneering as a minigame as opposed to a skill. Perhaps increasing in-game experience for the various gatherer/ artisan skills and nerfing the rewards to suit osrs. Perhaps skilling rewards?
---
Are there plans to drastically upgrade the Official Old School client?
---
I would like to use it over 3rd party clients, but there are some core features of 3rd party clients (UI rescalling, GPU rendering, etc) that make the official client a poor Runescape experience by comparison.
---
I was refering to the guy who got 115m str xp in a week.
---
I remember you. You were the dumbfuck who wanted to turn runecrafting into a more AFK skill than cooking. 
---
You suggested stackable pure essence with a complete disregard of the massive negative impact of having RC give 10+ times the amount of runes per run. Your suggestion would destroy the value of runes.
---
I like the arena it’s definitely unique, and the mechanics, but it could be a little easier if you could re-stun Sire before the stun expires, and maybe reduce the health of the tentacles to 10hp (I think they’re 20?) so you can get killing the boss quicker.. also the reward mechanism is cool although it is just luck based
---
I’m going for mine soon, good job btw

When they were releasing the alter they polled it with set xp rates. The rates people are getting are higher than those xp rates. So this is already technically been polled
---
Can we have a ctrl walk feature when the run orb is on that is the same as the current ctrl run feature when the run orb is off.
---
An alternative would be making ctrl toggle the run orb.
---
Yet the low iq brainlet tricked and killed this highly intelligent PvMer
---
It always ticks me off seeing how far away his mouse is from his body. That can't be proper ergonomics, can it?
---
Give them a solid punch in the face for me, will ya?
---
Forgot to cover up “walk” in the top left you’re getting hacked pleb
---
Clean and simple, I like it.
---
Not sure why they haven't done those two simple fixes.  I'd probably spend a solid 10 minutes a day muting bots, and some days even longer while I flip items at the g/e just because of how much I HATE those bots.
---
They really need to just get rid of NMZ, make maxing a pure account respectable again
---
Pretty sure that just an alt..
---
I have no idea where the fuck you got 190k exp/hr from but that's simply impossible, this is coming from someone who has paid for runners.  It's not even close to that amount, most you'll get if you're tick perfect is like 145-150k xp/hr assuming the runners are spot on and you hire 4.
---
Here we go again
---
I understand it's not the optimal way to play. But, why do we care when people choose to play differently? So he doesn't skill or quest. Who gives a shit.
---
With the proposed nerf to ZMI runners, should I be worried about other methods such as use of alts for moneymaking purposes or tick manipulation skilling methods be nerfed?
---
Group IM is just an example of content we want rather than content being forced on us that we don’t want, and surely a new skill would require some engine work
---
Personally I had to click a bit away from the altar (like ten steps away from it) and more to the wall. Otherwise I ended up going the slow path.
---
yep my eyes are bleeding now
---
thnx….
---
Yupppp, if a single account gets max 10 lines in before being muted, the bots would eventually give up.
---
I showed Runelite to my co-workers who have just started getting into OSRS (one fell has gotten up to 1200total in just a few weeks -- from never having played before) -- his response? The actual Runescape client is literally unplayable. I told him about Runelite and he couldn't believe how cool the addons were that improved the gameplay experience. The client has been abandoned, they don't have the team size or skill to perhaps implement features like Runelite does
---
It's really sad we have to go to a third party website, careful which one though cuz one extension is real and one is a phish, then you can actually play the game
---
Well, RIP
---
How were runners a problem exactly? Changing the pouches doesn't make sense at all, just feels like lazyscape.
---
Will you revisit Minus XP Lamps? It failed the poll with 71% approval of voters. While it's not enough to pass, it should be enough to revisit the idea. I’ve read many discussions, and most of the players against the concept had fair reasons, such as exploits, meta shifts, or would have liked to see other or more limitations added to the concept. I believe XP removal could pass a new poll if revised and details are shared with voters.
---
I made a [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/biucmw/new_dialogue_minus_xp_lamps/) yesterday on the matter to try to create discussion and hopefully breathe life back into the concept.
---
About 5k.
---
So, not bad yet, they're just shitting out curved bones for some reason.
---
Is the change to trading at zmi being polled? If not, when are you removing tick manipulation?
---
The best part is only .0001% of Redditors ever used a runner.
---
&gt; Quick skills
---
Farming for game time-spent, is incredibly fast. There's a bunch of quests you can do for it as well. [Here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quest_experience_rewards#Farming) is the relevant info.
---
For real life time, Herblore and Crafting are really fast if you have money to spend.
---
&gt; AFK skills
---
Woodcutting and Fishing are good AFK skills to do, so you're on the right track.
---
Thought's on revisiting a unified mini-game shop?
---
The idea being some mini games are more fun then others, players would be able to unlock mini-game content from any they choose to play. The current rewards when added to the global shop should be balanced around hours needed to obtain them.
---
To further breath life into mini-games, what about introducing a weekly rotation where one mini-game is chosen to give bonus rewards during the week.
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Can the Northern boat on fossil island used to get to the underwater area have right click travel option added?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Can we hold another player designed content contest?
---
Two really unique ways of training skills (mining and agility) came from player designed content ideas.
---
A new skill like the proposed warding just simply isn’t needed. It can be integrated into the game by updating already existing skills. The split it would cause in the community would be comparatible to the split in the nation that brexit has caused and would cause. 
---
The developers are forcing this new skill upon us and it just isn’t needed or wanted. It already failed polls and has been reworked time and time again. The point of this post is for them to scrap it and move on and stop forcing it on us. It’s failed time and time again to appease the majority of the community, just like T May and brexit.
---
That’s disappointing
---
If you're 99+ sure?
---
But at the levels people are doing runners at it's not bad
---
When player owned houses was first talked about, this was how I envisioned it. Was quite disappointed I couldn't say hi to my neighbor...
---
Oh, specifically 1 tick flicking. Got it
---
those things didn't get polled, let alone with xp rates
---
Didn't ask
---
It sucks you spend most of your income to buying food. Still, thank you for your reply.
---
how much gold would have been removed if this was used all time. pre nerf i mean.
---
Wasted.
---
Surprisingly few options for “a”. 
---
I recommend air wizard, would be a fun, easy and nostalgic one to start things off
---
The fact that warding will be polled and requires a super-majority of 75% to pass already makes it more democratic than the atrocity that the brexit referendum was.
---
One should note that warding doesn't stand to take anything significant away from anyone, while brexit has obvious, devastating, and lasting implications for a huge number of people in the UK.
---
what mining level is that at? I was thinking of gem rock mining to see what kind of profits i can pull but only at 70 mining atm
---
He hid his name. Move to the next thread boys
---
Scythe
---
"Base" is just a minimum, there are skills that require less than 70 like runecrafting (need 65) but theres also a decent amount of 75~ requirements
---
Went back to zmi to do some running while the opportunity was available
---
Lowkey, this is the most "MMO"-esque a skill has ever felt to me. Had to organize runners, prove ability to run efficiently, coordinate as a 4-5 person team for a chunk of time, take rests chat, resume with maybe a few switched members
---
Dead ass makes me want more skills to have that *similar* experience.
---
8 😂
---
That makes about as much sense as complaining that nerfing zmi ess running devalues rc cape. Just because nmz has been for so long and plenty of people have used it doesn't mean we shouldn't want to remove it.
---
zenyte shards from demonic gorillas. its a pretty fun monster to fight, and the zenytes are 1/300, which is pretty low for how many you can kill an hr
---
Aren't you supposed to pray ranged?
---
Of course not lol
---
"Base" is just the lowest point, he could theoretically have 126 combat level while also having just achieved "base 70 stats" because his RC lacked behind or something
---
I love this art style. More please, good sir!
---
Can we see a change in the desert diary being protection from heat with the amulet worn being a hard reward and full immunity form heat with elite? I feel after elite desert diary you don’t spend anytime in the desert really, Aswell as the teleport, all the hard diaries give unlimited teleports to certain places but the desert amulet only teleports you to the Kalphites after elite? Can we change that to hard Aswell?
---
I can't even find people to do it one time!  Grats on the RNG man!
---
Nice job dude - Mobile is awesome for cooking.
---
I know it’s probably not high up in the list but how cool would it be if pets could do a wee emote? Like kbd breaths fire or the heron catches a fish or the tangleroot grows a flower? This would be so awesome to see
---
I was equally satisfied when I saw my ruby dragon bolts hit 2 100s in a row ^^
---
Runelite is old school by the way. But no, no warding cuz that isnt old school!!
---
What’s the proposed release date for song of the elves?
---
tell us what happened. we are all mods
---
Thoughts on adding an obsidian plate skirt variant?
---
Not a runelite specific feature, it's on like every third-party client. But it's not part of the main client.
---
There’s just so many problems with this
---
1. What’s the point of going one higher level to 100, it doesn’t unlock anything, just adds more unnecessary grinding to get to the highest level of each skill
---
2. Why would you be forced to wear the skillcape to get further xp towards 100? 
---
Would all xp gained past 99 without the cape not count anymore? That could hinder training rates for many different skills, and people going for post 99 xp anyways would be forced to wear a certain slot, instead of maybe a fire/infernal cape or Ava’s.
---
Would xp gain still count but just not towards the 100? What happens to people that get 200m xp before they get level 100 because they weren’t wearing the skillcape? Are they just not able to get it anymore since xp isn’t tracked post 200m?
---
What about when things train multiple skills at once. Are you just not able to work on say, ranged an hp, or strength and hp, or strength, ranged, and slayer at the same time? You’d have to pick one skillcape and all the rest of that xp would go to waste until you get your level and swap over.
---
Any more thoughts on the Keri’s dagger buff similar to what you made the arc light into?
---
I miss the good old days of just logging in and getting surprised by the new eoc update instead of dissecting it to pieces before it drops like a dog going through it's own poopoo
---
gottem
---
I watched a poker podcast today with the ceo of a company, he legitimately made this suggestion.. dont see it ending well
---
What a hellscape to live in - literally looks like a concentration camp.
---
Thanks man! I’m 5 months out of chemo and going strong.  Everything is looking good too, so hopefully I can put that part of my life behind me.  I want farming to be my first 99... just need to spend money on seeds
---
They're objectively not worth doing on a main though
---
Wouldn't double nature or laws be the closest things to double nature/law running we have left?
---
arguably it doesnt though. having max combat and doing zulrah for an hour or doing vorkath for an hour isnt nearly as hard as getting your first mil after starting a fresh account, which both are way easier than just buying bonds. tick manipulation specifically is done by the player and requires more effort than doing it the intended way, having someone do literally 99% of the activity except the one part that gains you xp isnt "more effort" regardless of how much money it costs
---
recoil/B ring (i)
---
Mithril gloves/cb bracelet
---
D bolts if using rcb, opal if using DCB+
---
Occult/glory
---
MA2 cape
---
Both recently discovered methods where as tick manipulation has been made use of forever. Not to mention there was a big demand for ZMI to get nerfed
---
Lol. 
---
This is my legit account. You seem salty and obsessed friendo.
---
Whats the point of doing a minor change just to make a skill more braindead.
---
Definitely not too late for that. They changed zulrah droptable, 6hr afking, ardy knights etc years after they'd been in game for years
---
\*Stares at computer from Iraq\* ...yup...never been anywhere. Brb going back to afk on mobile.
---
Can i repost it tomorrow?
---
He's a cunt
---
Tbow is a bit inconsistent but you also don’t use any scales or have to do any switches. Using blowpipe on blue phase is extra dps though and you can use its spec.
---
For your freedom murica
---
Shit sorry fam, was hoping for better news
---
I would have worded it differently but yes you are right
---
There are good things, but there are also some very serious problems with completely unacceptable "jokes" that are accepted and normalised by a worrying number of people in this community. Misogynistic, racist and ableist jokes are common, along with widespread misunderstanding and mockery of autism.
---
Calm your tits brahz
---
So you’re telling me nobody asked if it would work in the same fashion they were already paying runners to do laws or natures. Hey guys we have this new zmi alter it gives more exp than the others, oh cool can we still do that thing I’m paying people for like in my other runecrafting method?
---
Removing a player created mini game because they forgot something was possible is not a fix and it's actually disrepescrful to the players. It's not our fault that jagex forgot that running essence was possible they should have polled it and it would have passed. No one should care if people can afford to hire players to increase their xp/hr. That's what makes this game great. Player created content.
---
Interesting ground items
---
Yes it appears that way, because that is their stated reason for removing it.
---
Bot farms use VPNs so ip bans will do nothing
---
You're acting like it's a hard thing to do, while RuneLite literally has an add-on for it. People don't learn tick manipulation, because it's incredibly tedious. And the reason it is tedious, is because it's a glitch; it go through a development process to make it fit into the game. It's the randomly appearing shit-stain Jesus, that gets corroded around a leaky toilet.
---
A shitty glitch, used by an overwhelming minority, is currently affecting future update scaling. Like actually think about that. It's goddamn retarded.
---
It was polled at a certain rate and people got 3x the polled rate. It needed fixing. For most people it wasnt an issue of not being able to afford it, it was an integrity issue. Runecrafting shouldn't be that fast,  whether you like it or not. Especially unpolled.
---
hired with the quickness, not fired with the nepotismness
---
Most people don't play for EHP. Get back in your cave.
---
Are you living in an alternate universe?
---
Salt.
---
What’s wrong with zmi
---
Given the nature of Runecrafting. It's not meant to be a fast skill. However that being said, for those who can afford it, it makes sense to have a viable way to train it at high xp/hr. the hardest part is being rich enough to afford it, and then even finding people willing to run for you.
---
Yes he did. Which has exactly nothing to do with the current discussion about posting spoilers of someone else's content.
---
Wtf you talking about lmao. I've already been in and got out you twat

Karambwans are purely an afk. Your teleport methods will also play a role in how profitable they are, but I calculate them to be a bit over 300k/hr as a baseline when I do them. How efficient Karambwans are compared to other methods depends entirely on how you're playing. If you're doing it for 8 hours a day while you're at work and can't pay much attention attention, they're a solid option. If you're at home on a Saturday and want to spend 6 hours grinding out some OSRS cash then it's not great at all. Blast Furnace is probably twice as profitable, but requires almost full attention. 
---
Something like Barrows is also quite profitable (depends on Mory Hard diaries and luck) when you can pay attention.
---
One ring of dueling, bottom right inv space, 2 cheese pizza, top right, top left and one down. get ready for some social engineering, GG noob enjoy the hack.

Selling rare viking boat that you built in Tutorial Island !

If you're referring to mahog tables, sure but you also then get twice as much time to rebuild your bank.

just wait

Can seed boxes given from farming contracts contain seaweed spores, and or be pick pocketable from master farmers.? Would nice to have another to get them other than lobstrosities or waiting for them to spawn.

i like this content because it doesn’t craft runes and because runecrafting bad
---
would not be surprised if this IS rendi
---
That's not what it means

Hell yeah, I played while deployed but I wasn't lucky enough to have mobile. Should make time go a little faster! Stay safe brother
---
If warding fails they will move imbues somewhere else, they didn't say anything about elves
---
That's the resellers price, if you wanna bulk sell you get less from those same resellers.
---
Are you serious? If he didn’t want the possibility of people spoiling it why the fuck would he Be walking around the GE with it on?
---
Some kind of teleporter in the lithkren vault would be a cool way to do it if ds2 is deemed a more appropriate requirement.
---
Problem is not about the runners. Nobody complained about runners getting paid 2m with 50rc and 3,5m with 75rc without any requirements other than lunar book and 82 magic. The problem lies in the fact that such exp rates are achievable for a skill like runecrafting. In a game where alting is not banned and you can literally have 0 effort moneymaking machines running in the background in infinite numbers, money is not a concern for anyone when it comes to the balance of a content. Gp is literally not a valid argument here since its generated by alts and by it its a 0 time thing, and would be only a valid point if we had a rule which states that one person can have only one account.
---
I don't know man. If you can't click out of the fire a tick faster then you should be taking your own waters instead of blaming the guy who sped up prep.
---
I like having atleast one humidify on the team. It feels rather silly to have it as "the dumbest brainlet" in the meme.
---
So happy they nerfed it as it was devaluing my max cape :)
---
Congrats! I've been playing before the GE, and have no capes lol
---
Or you can right click empty them which takes 2 seconds!
---
Wtf why??
---
Can you imagine if they forbid banking on Entrana or Karmja back in 2006?
---
Warding will fail 100%
---
Context please I dont play anymore just browse the sub reddit
---
Nothing from that link reassured me. Jagex doesn’t indorse it and even if you’re unaware the seller is a RWTer you can risk a ban yourself. Telling people you can legally do it is spreading misinformation.
---
looks like someone played a little too much Call of Duty and believed the propaganda. Keep it up champ ! go shoot some ~~innocents~~ talibans to free the shit our of their ~~oil~~ country
---
Dude nice maxed account. How many hours?
---
this is art
---
I think if chompies are gonna give hunter xp they should tie it to claiming the hats off rantz. That way the people who already did the western diary don't miss out as much.
---
pretty sure openly admitting to rwt makes u a bad person and this is karma for it

Or only bring 2/3 items that will protect over your clue, you can do all except for master clue steps like that.

&gt; RS isn't even a hard or **time consuming game**,
---
Have you ever played the game?
---
So let's say the players competing for ranks switch to wrath tiaras with runners, which is 735 xp per inventory. Should Jagex then restrict trading at the wrath alter?
---
Plays game with 07 graphics, Complains that armour looks terrible 
---
Bruh the entire game looks like a steamed potatoes, calm down
---
I know. I set my ZMI up so “esc” was my mage book and “f1” was my invy. That made it so afk when I got the groove
---
I hate the 'there's bigger problems' argument. This probably took a couple hours to organise and sort out, they probably spent years trying to catch bots
---
170k/hr is the minimum expected with 4 experienced runners @90 rc and above. If you werent getting anywhere close to that, you either suck at dropping/trading or you were using beginners/bad runners.
---
:(
---
the new layout is so godawful i doubt anyone uses it
---
It's because brats like OP are entitled as shit and stick their fingers in their ears
---
Exactly, he's calculating max efficiency ZMI with runners, and chooses to calculate lavas solo.
---
ironic
---
they've chosen to limit themselves
---
Do you have all the colors? Can you show me what green legs and body looks like with the rest purple? Been thinking of going that route but no way to test it out first hah.
---
rendi more like rendirrelevant.
---
Why are you comparing ZMI exp/hour with runners to lavas WITHOUT runners?
---
Shit I just came here to post this lol
---
Any chances to change the charging mechanics of the Ancient Wyvern Shield? All charges are lost upon death and charging it again is way more tedious than it’s ranged/melee variants. Especially for ironmen (btw).
---
Dude... ruined my money maker

not to mention doublers, dice bots, "give me your fury and you won't regret it" people
---
It's progress in the right direction. Rome wasn't built in a day as they say.
---
Would you consider **changing warhammers' requirements from Attack to Strength?** This would apply only to warhammers up to rune - steel, black, white, mithril, adamant and rune.
---
* Revamps dead content: gives a niche to some unused weapons **without changing their stats**.
---
* Next to no effect on economy, as they are unlikely to rise above alch price.
---
* More options for Strength pures.
---
* Introduces a new viable low level KO weapon without changing P2P or F2P meta.
---
why? chompies are great, if you enjoy them you can do them and get cool cosmetic hats / your counter up just for fun. if you dont enjoy them you don't lose out on anything by not doing them
---
Clever
---
Well for starters, your first mistake was looking at your stats and thinking "yep that's what a high level player is". You have almost the exact minimum range required to wield a blowpipe lol. 
---
The general consensus on the mimic fight is that the best gameplan is to ignore the minion spawns and just hit the boss, avoiding the candy attacks. Is that what you've been trying?
---
First to get an infernal counts as his fire cape record I think
---
I decided to check up on some of these names, although some did get banned. a lot of them are now over 100 cmb with very similar stats again. its kind of crazy that theyre able to survive this long

Holden is that you

Sorry for your loss, may his soul rest in peace. Hopefully your alright, it must've be devastating for you to hear such bad news. ❤
---
What your thoughts on adding a necromancy skill and reworking the zeah spellbook to be able to control your undead army?
---
Cleaning finds in the museum for xp lamps. I think that is roughly 1.5k xp per hour.
---
Another option is chasing down gangs in zeah with a cannon and then using Intel for strength times.
---
* Authenticator delay has been going on for years
---
* Dicing bots / player games of chance have been an on going issue which could be dealt with over time and rather easily to some degree
---
* Emblem farming has been mentioned but never looked upon at the true extent up until recent videos
---
I mean I had 0 clue. Maybe I'll check out his channel in a month and that video will be up.
---
You either live to be a hero or die long enough to become a villain
---
Zmi was a 30% increase, not sure what bf was.
---
I hope it passes and comes out just before you max to piss you off
---
people werent thinking about essence running when they voted on that poll. Maybe the right course of action would be nerfing the running xp, but removing it is just way too far.
---
Switching to TeamViewer on mobile while taking a shit to not disrupt the gains
---
I used ultracompost. I think I had like 4 or 5 die on the way to 99, and I was able to resurrect most of them anyway. Protecting them absolutely isn't worth the cost.
---
Tbh I haven’t played in weeks, I go through a I’m heavily addicted for a month, then I won’t play for 1-2 months it’s just a bad cycle but if warding comes I just won’t return
---
i like to think so
---
This comment really speaks to me, good job and keep it up.
---
You know not to update it till the end.
---
Undeserved
---
Altscape will never be done away with. They would be cutting both legs and arms off at the joint if they did that. It's not progress in the right direction, it's just bullshit. Even if you agree that the method needs to be fixed, how it's being fixed is not the proper way.
---
Hmm you don’t piss your hands good
---
1.5 tick. It somehow makes fishing faster.
---
Cooking is allright. Your close to bank it’s like 3-5seconds bank then 1minute AFk. Cannonballs is about 25-30secs bank and 2.30-3mjnutes afk.
---
30-45 seconds is sounding generous. It’s more like 15-20. I’ve gone back after a quick text and I was out. One click login helps but still
---
Lmaooooo
---
Can you make what requests have been noted down and put in the backlog change list?
---
Looks like rs3
---
This is just laziness at this point
---
Nope, I only have dark blue, regular, and red. The white gloves in the pic are actually cooking gauntlets. Wish I could help you.
---
The month isn't over yet

Shut up Shawn

&gt; There are 0 situations where someone chooses to use the twisted bow because of the prayer bonus
---
This contradicts 
---
&gt; most people don't even know the bonus exists.
---
This. 
---
&gt;There's no logical reason for the bow to have a prayer bonus
---
It's a divine bow. 
---
&gt; and it could be offered back in the future as an upgrade, which would make the bow better, but not actually power creep dps.
---
I agree but I doubt it's good idea to devalue the twisted bow as that would really devalue COX.
---
Anyway that fixes the problem is the proper way. Atleast this ensures there can't be any "alternative methods" for zmi rc in the future.
---
Rendimento? As in the guy who has the *second* lowest combat fire cape?
---
Literally zero afk this way and no multitasking on phone. We need it changed. There are some topics about it on runescape forums but havent seen jmod reply yet.
---
No you did the right thing buddy. This sub reddit is the perfect place to share your beautiful moments with your friend playing Runescape. We are all proud of him of achieving such a stressfull skill and hopefully he will be climbing the walls in heaven. Rip brother.

🦀🦀🦀 IRONMAN (btw) DOESN'T TEST ITS ATHLETES 🦀🦀🦀
---
Ah well thanks anyways!
---
Investing in this meme
---
got hacked somehow, they took all my measly 2m I've made so far :( any ideas for what I should do? I was able to scrape together like 10k, any ideas to make some gold? or should I just keep doing quests like I was doing before?
---
oh damn. Did you just straight DPS through the heals?
---
Ironmen use arclight for those bosses
---
Obby capes get more respect from me. fire/inferno cape basically just says i am a sheep
---
How does it contradict? People don't choose to use the tbow because of the prayer bonus, partially because they don't know it exists. Where is the contradiction?
---
??
---
Lol could you imagine if after he writes out this sort of wholesome story he gets insta-banned right after you report him?
---
I don't know whats going on but I would like to buy that thingy for 15 million gp

jase consistently gets 180-200 doing 0+4

Where's the guy that shit himself?
---
No... it’s an app called Apollo for Reddit... i just came across this ad.
---
Private servers will hack your RuneScape account. 
---
If you want to learn PvP - start from F2P pking.
---
*insert lame chemistry joke how alcohol is technically a solution* 🦀
---
Guess they should rollback the thousands of accounts who've spent dozens or hundreds of hours training melee stats in there.
---
Oh, and 2 step click manipulation on skills too.
---
And the 1m/hr xp Con garden fence crafting method.
---
I wouldn't mind it if they made the teleport take you to the highest tower in the guild. It would provide a little utility for doing the quest and things in that area, but would be far inferior to the quest cape teleport.
---
Some of my favorite times of the game. I didn't really play much RS until OSRS came out and I got my first ever million running nats.
---
Snitches get stitches
---
Hard to say. I kept most of the drops. The gems, gold ore and seeds I used for XP. I think I got maybe 15 dpicks in total. But I lost 30m when selling the dhcb back (after I got kbd), and 32m when selling the the craws bow back (after I got ele pet)
---
Go to the PvP Members World, loot shit, zero skill... Maybe buy some Stamina Pots to outrun the bots. Profit.
---
Finally a suggestion I can get behind
---
Honestly, I enjoyed the dinner dungeoneering minigame when it first dropped. I didn't care about the rewards, or training the skill, just that it was a fun activity to do with a group.
---
I'd honestly support seeing it reworked as some kind of minigame in OSRS. Doesn't need rewards or a skill, just as something to do. It was a nice way to let skillers and fighters enjoy an activity together. I sucked at combat back in the day, but all my skills were higher than the folks I played with. They fought bosses, I fished and runecrafted.
---
It's a decent collaborative activity.
---
Here I can't stand to do agility for even an hour!  Sorry about your loss man he is maxed in a better place now.
---
Underwater swimming, bounty hunter etc. This method is way low on the totem pole compared to those.
---
Barrows should be relatively easy for you. A higher Magic level would probably help though.
---
Fire Cape is probably out of your reach if you haven't done it before. I'd suggest higher prayer (If you're going for 70 at some point, might as well get it) and 75+ ranged.
---
Pfff EZscape
---
Sure, it’s an insanely good weapon. However, it also had an insanely heavy price tag at almost 1.15 billion go right now, and has pretty much been in that region since release.
---
Only a select few of players will ever get their hands on this bow, and as such it should feel like a great accomplishment when someone does. The prayer bonus only adds to this sense of accomplishment.
---
Furthermore, the weapon has some drawbacks against enemies with low/zero magic level.
---
Do not nerf the twisted bow, it’s fun to talk about it’s price tag and how great a weapon it is. A nerf would just be uncool, to put it plainly.
---
I think I remember specifically the image from the op being posted a few months ago
---
Damn, can't wait to watch the video.
---
Make it to where players are able to click through other players random events just like pets work. This is especially annoying to deal with when doing rooftop agility and the random is stuck on the click-box of an obstacle.
---
This was brought up in a previous Q&amp;A, it was a suggestion for having the Alchemical Hydra having an option to spawn as asleep similar to Vorkath. This would be very convenient and would not increase the kills per hour or anything.
---
How do you guys as staff feel about possibly changing the polling system? Perhaps taking a little more power back from the players for the overall good of the game, or maybe lowering the percentage required to pass.
---
alchmate is helpful too.
---
Yet I have trouble killing it with 90 base stats. Nice achievement tho!
---
It ignores magic defense which is a function of magic level and magic defense bonus. That being said suffering is the best because you always want magic defense at kraken. So i would say suffering&gt;seers&gt;brimstone
---
thank you!
---
I understand those are big issues that need to be solved, but why not fix this one while we can with such an easy fix?
---
recently discovered???
---
there were d2h parties in pohs way back in the day, and essence running has damn near always been a thing. im not sure when you started but i remember running ess for nats as a kid when i started rs
---
Why? He's about to get a lot of views.
---
Love the special attack
---
I doubt you'd notice any practical difference, but yeah brimstone would be a smidge better then seers (i)
---
For the non meme answer, idle animations are cut in high population areas to prevent client-sided lag. Most if not all modern computers shouldn't have an issue with it anymore, but its a left-over from the original game.
---
Jagex loves taking steps in removing the MMO out of MMORPG
---
I was worried that it was at first, luckily it isn't.
---
just ban botters, it's that easy!
---
&gt; because you always want magic defense at 
---
thank you.  I was just wondering if the passive from brim ring would out dps seers (i)
---
 I didn't want to waste 1-2 inventory spaces as a UIM with the untradeable ring pieces and tbh didn't expect to be able to make so many extra brimstone rings before the claw drop. Hope you get lucky soon!
---
Smart man. Logging is an xp waste
---
Good luck! I hope you're successful in your journey my friend.
---
Fucking wow, gg
---
Interesting, but I do feel it would devalue UIM. What would you make harder in your proposed HUIM?
---
Or HUIW, or HUIP (since it’s ‘19 n u must be PC)
---
I just started a Hardcore Ironman a few nights ago but have barely played it. I am more now. Currently I’m getting woodcutting up to get up firemaking, as well as killing chickens for feathers to get up fishing.  
---
Is there any really basic stuff that Ironmen should do right away?
---
“NoT QuITe W0T I WaS HoPiNg FoR” .......😒
---
Well, looks like I’m heading over to the wilderness then 😍
---
I was the one who ags/gmauled, we split it.
---
I'm not even going to bother dissecting your comment you absolute bottom feeder. All I can say is your IQ is very much under the Congolese average.
---
Original OSRS client if you don’t want your stuff stolen.
---
Correct
---
What did he change?
---
Fastest access to a fairy ring until high farming and in general the teleports are really useful for getting you to tasks. Getting to 70 crafting to boost is a bit of a pain but totally worth it for the time saved
---
Will implies all, which is not true.
---
If it isn't obvious..  don't use the same login information on a private server. You should just learn to pk within the real game though. Go to white clanwars portal if you want safe pvp experience
---
This very much belongs here. Lots of us have had friends come and go on RuneScape. I'm sorry for your loss.

Keep in mind that the sender's address can be spoofed, so you can't be sure that the email was actually sent from that address. That happened with the first email you got. The second one is almost certainly real.

“ forcing a new skill on us” —— ooh you are so hard done by, should we all feel sorry for you? Are you sad? Would u like a tissue for all those years? Does ur ass hurt after we forced you?

Imagine 3 man vetion like 400k an hour lmao

Thanks so much man, that means a lot to me for real! :)

I think that iOS is very aggressive about killing apps running in the background to preserve battery so this might be out of Jagex's control.

I still keep a tab for a panic tab because I always screw up when I try to panic tele through the magic book.
---
Can Xarpus defense be nerfed like tekton was... Its annoying to  kill without hitting your dwh....and mostly leads to a wipe. I get that TOB is suppose to be hard pvm content but can't it be less RNG depedent..
---
https://i.imgur.com/bQCs9cG.png

I have to agree. Would love to do some questing on work breaks but don’t have time to exit and read a guide without logging out.
---
Or, just install a toilet where your computer is.
---
Keep in mind the average drop value wasn't significantly higher, it just had a few "lottery winner" drops
---
Thank you for your reaction. The second one is probably real because I requested it myself to change my pwd.
---
I’m doing normal just because it’s more AFK like you mentioned, tried void and it seems to be working fine. I’m 94 defence so it’s pretty good. I may change from the Magic Shotbow tho.
---
Who gives a fuck. “Buyable” is subjective in this game. You can put money into many non-“buyable” skills and render more exp. I can get more exp in combat with better bought gear. I can get more exp in ranged with bought chinchompas. Hell I can even use a shit load of Camelot teleports to boost agility exp, “genius.”
---
So my goal on my uim has been to get a firecape before I start slayer.  Just find the idea fun so Im rolling with it.  I already have barrow gloves and a glory.
---
But kinda wondering on the rest of a reliable setup.  I haven't played in over three years and even then only did fc twice.  Should I grind out barrows for karils body and verac helm/skirt for amour or use black dhide?
---
Would a msb w/ rune arrows on jad and addy arrows for rest of cave be enough to get through?  Already 71 fletching so can grind out four more lvls to boost to msb if its good enough.  My smithing for ammo and funds to train it are low so I dont think rcb is doable.  Or also hunt for karils cbow and use this?
---
If it matters my range lvl is 75 (still have 8k red chins to use in tunnels) def 75 prayer 60.
---
Edit:  forgot to mention that I do have D darts from dragon imps.  Idk if thats useful at all w/o blowpipe.
---
Ok champ
---
funny how you guys happened to create the exact same https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/4qj0xu/miniquest_point_cape/
---
Maybe between lithkren and the elvarg lab
---
I just applied for best rng...
---
I'll post when I'm home but I'm 500 total with low 40s combat stats
---
Can’t trade inside ZMI anymore so you can’t have accounts running ess to your account while all you do is runecraft.
---
* Train thieving for cash. 
---
* Get some teleports since you can't just buy tabs or jewelry from the GE. 
---
* Do quests for XP. Waterfall for 30 attack/strength, varrock museum miniquest for 9 slayer/hunter, restless ghost for 9 prayer, etc.
---
* If you plan to train melee, get an amulet of accuracy, iron gloves, rock climbing boots and some attack/strength potions for extra damage.
---
* Complete the Stronghold of Security for a quick 10k gold.
---
If it was actually being botted. I'd be for curtailing it, but it's not. It's a guy paying over 15 mil to get others to coordinate. Even if they werent spending bank it would become such a fringe case that no one would ever know or care.
---
I don't think you will ever get a torso or bcp, but I do sense 5 bandos boots in your future
---
How did you get to see it? I'd assume they'd want to keep it kind of secret to make it a little more difficult for botters.
---
Better have an unique RS only password, authenticator on your account and e-mail. Would be a shame if someone managed to get your login name/email to just log in and get you perm banned.
---
Not the same at all.. using prayer doesn't give xp, magic does.
---

JUST MAKE A MAXXED TANK.

at least link the tweet u vulture
---
Looks like you forgot you logged into your alt to downvote people further.  235 Karma on this sad little alt.  Imagine having two accounts for that purpose.  
---
Jesus, going through your post history you commented on your main account's post in a different sub and DISAGREED with yourself?  
---
This isn't normal behavior, even for an online messaging forum.  Please seek help
---
The only outfit worth getting for exp is lumberjack if you're gonna stop at 99. All the outfits are worth it if you consider 200m as a goal.
---
Nope, not worth it. Especially give how painful tithe farm is.
---
Fucking Lagex.
---
On the log in screen where it shows “ you last logged in Earlier today “ can that be changed to you last logged in x minutes ago?
---
I bet u kiss ur dad on the lips
---
You can you just get the message and a counter in your log. But no actual pet.
---
Also, going to your altscape, interaction between your alt accounts used to always be a reportable offense. So, why is it okay for one thing the change despite "always being that way" but not for another?
---
i do demonic gorillas while i ride my bike in the motogp
---
Just down voted all your post, enjoy :)
---
Rogues outfit isnt worth getting?
---
Lmao.. yea I have that guy feeling 2
---
Less sad about the rc method getting nerfed. More sad about losing a 12m gp/hr method lmao
---
What was your gear for chaos elemental and Vetion?
---
You tortured your toys as a child, huh?
---
Cheers mate!
---
Do you like how he's using an alt account now to try to help his argument and looking worse?
---
im p sure they wont, but i mean the only reason they dont is because not enough people play it for that to be added.
---
I've seen some morality issues thrown around because of swampletics but they literally already map so many things that aren't much different, ie clues, places to stand for volcano cape thing. And a few other things. So i don't think thats a valid reason not to add it. 
---
Lack of interest might be, though i would be really easy for them to add.
---
Untrimmed skillcapes;
---
Currently there is no safe way to keep your untrimmed skillcape without abusing unintended mechanics.
---
The untrimmed version of skillcapes are mostly used in fashionscape, or to experience nostalgia. Some people even build their account with these skillcapes in mind.
---
People who care about their untrimmed cape currently have to jump through hoops/pay attention for the entirety of their account, until they max.
---
So, would it be possible to have your untrimmed skillcape locked to your account, where you always could buy more no matter how many 99's you have?
---
It would mean a lot to the people who care about their first cape, and help out new people who simply do not know about the trimming mechanic and how to keep it untrimmed. (especially with the influx of new players through mobile)
---
Yeah something like that, I was kind of planning on keeping my attack/str low but then saw that dragon slayer gives attack xp hence my post. Not sure which direction to go.
---
Can't do it, gotcha. Thank you, next
---
Lead me to heaven when we die
---
Afair the early plans by Jagex did indeed involve the houses in East Falador, somehow. That was before the Party Room was moved there.
---
It's actually worse ehp an hour if you are a solo player. Because while you get 180k an hour you shell out 15 mil, which you then need to pvm for 5 more hours to make that back up. That's 6 hours of work for 180k. Lavas would net you over 400k xp in 6 hours if you are super efficient.
---
I know and I want iOS devices to be fine aswell :)
---
Can you imagine what prime real estate marching might’ve looked like in this game had non-instances been a thing?
---
D
---
What percentage do you open the chest at? I saw that 86% is ideal but I have a hard time getting right on 86.
---
TIL if you have that quest completed you don't need the rope
---
You can’t trade in the area
---
Oh shit I forgot about Konar.
---
Can you elaborate on that last statement? I don't know anything about exilent or its features
---
I literally did it, and you replied to about a quarter of what I said.
---
You are either genuinely unintelligent or a troll. My moneys on the former.
---
DUDE I CANT STOP LAUGHING
---
That’s god damn hilarious
---
Yep I’m with this
---
How can you be sure it's not being botted? Or that it wouldn't become botted in the near future?
---
No one would care? I think the people that actually care about highscores care. But I guess these people are "no one".
---
You know exactly what he meant, stop being annoying
---
This makes it so easy
---
As a few others have said, this is an iPhone issue. Jagex can't just wave their magic wand and make apple do anything lol
---
This makes me so sad.. he was only 23,24? /: o feel so bad for you and his family. I could feel his happiness and sense of accomplishment from getting 99 agility..
---
If jagex reverts altscape they will again be shooting themselves in the foot. You think  100k people actually play this game? It's like 20% bots and 30% alts
---
African Gielinorian
---
I would say they don't make it clear but I am almost certain that in the quest dialog the leader of the camp tells you that he would inform the person at the rock to let you pass freely. It is your own fault for skipping the dialog lol
---
What about mine?
---
Damn, it's really already been an entire year of $11
---
I'm a totaly noob but can you ignore brothers that spawns in tunels?
---
Lol aye Construction is so damn easy to train now. I was for some reason dreading to get 83 on my new Pking account but finished within a couple hours doing mahogany bench method. It was so quick..
---
“If you tab out while entering the last character in a captcha while shift clicking your animation will carry over for .2 seconds giving you a .2 second window to perform another action at the end of your animation, therefore allowing 1.5 tick fishing”
---
Cant say I understand that
---
No I'm talking about the troll &lt;3 your good
---
It is the end, there is about 10 hours left
---
In which case maxed range with veracs helm then
---
These titles usually fit better on people getting their first d chain or something lmao. It's a yikes from me dawg
---
&gt; So who the fuck is with me?
---
Lmao!  Are you camped outside their HQ, ready to go on strike?  Sounds like Gaston from Beauty &amp; The Beast marching to the castle.
---
You only have done about 10 chests since the collection log came out judging by that amount of bolt racks
---
Community mad, brain out window.
---
Theres also cape sellers like Deezer who openly sell capes via port forwarding which is basically the customer allowing the seller to play on their IP for 2-3 hours. And then the more common method of selling capes via teamviewer/chrome remote both of which are 0% ban rate but are more challenging due to latency/lag.
---
tl;dr there's plenty of sellers who offer capes with a 0% ban rate the only people who get banned are the dumbasses who try to use vpns thinking that will be enough to fool jagex.
---
Could we get a QoL update for the smithing menu please.
---
At the very bottom there are 4 empty squares, just put a menu that has 1,5,10,x,all ; then you can just click an item to make and itll make whatever option you have on
---
You may disagree with the reason but there clearly is one.
---
What if I'm lactose intolerant
---
Maybe, but there also exists alts whose sole purpose is to make money for bonds to avoid having to pay membership. So, who knows how big of an impact it will really make.
---
Looks sick
---
As could May, strap in boys
---
Why wouldnt you just...look behind your character to see if you have a squirrel chasing you?
---
Fairy ring nats are comfy af
---
&gt; It's time to start attacking Jagex by force
---
Jesus man, chill. There is rarely an appropriate time to attack someone by force
---
I do them off task occasionally but that’s mostly just because I suck and need practice
---
Because most people train runecrafting for the shitty diary system, they don't give a fuck about achievement.
---
If infernal cape was made tradable, how much would it cost and how much profit per hour would Inferno be?
---
They didn't poll no trading in the caves though. They polled it with the XP rates a single player would get by themselves.
---
No, the whole point is to dedicate time to gather those resources. Not abuse bugs to do the same thing anyway.
---
shit directly into bottomless compost bucket for max ehp
---
I afk bandits
---
I think that's worth it.
---
I noped the fuck out of there when Real Human Bean started playing. 
---
No feelies today
---
I just overheal with sara brews, and take a restore at the end of the phase
---
Not needed if people play hcim like it should be. They quit the account as soon as they die.
---
Ok
---
GWD &amp; DK's are good to learn the basics (Gear swaps, prayer flicking/ticking, understanding when you COULD eat v.s. when you NEED to eat)
---
Zulrah is good for slightly more advanced tactics (Gear + prayer switching while watching your positioning)
---
CoX is viable as well, tho not technically a beginner boss it's pretty low penalty if you mess up (Worst case scenario you die and lose a few points, you'll still be able to finish the raid)
---
ive got a boomerang with your name on it
---
Pet counts are pretty useful for estimating the amount of items in the game. Ratio of drop rates and all that
---
They are worth less than the runes they replace
---
Fashionscape for life bro
---
Fuck this nostalgia argument.. play the game because you enjoy it, not because you're reliving your childhood. The game nearly died because people at one point couldn't agree on which updates they wanted.
---
Imo the only reason anyone should have for voting no is they just don't like the new skill and even then I still think it should pass, not everyone likes the same skills. Warding would complete the crafting triangle (smithing, crafting, warding). People pushed back on the grand exchange for so long just because of nostalgia.
---
Nostalgia is honestly holding back so many good updates.
---
One last thing, if you want to preserve your nostalgia, just don't train the skill? You can do anything you want in game.
---
Ending up sick by a dirty screen infested with bacteria is an insane xp waste
---
You guys don’t have a shit bucket?
---
Visually update malediction and odium ward base plz obby shield recolour looks trash
---
new mid-level group boss?
---
No efficient person has ever had this.
---
His reaction is a great example of what i probably look like getting a 99 alone. RIP brother
---
sometimes it is. othertimes it is 48hrs for first offense. reminds me that its been a week since some of my accts were temp banned so theyre good now :)
---
IDK the odds of tanking a zuk hit on 1 defense. But that alone makes it super lucky
---
You’re incorrect. If you try to reset your password they do in fact send you an email that allows you to change your password. There is no cancel button but you do get an email.
---
Leveling up combat because I got wrecked in The Fremennik Isles by the Ice Troll King.  I will come back with a vengeance.
---
Real time. You plant the herb. It grows in four 20 minute stages. Then you harvest and plant again. There are 9 herb patches. But for you probably only 5. Herb run takes 5-10 minutes at most without the good teleports. And you make bank. Problem is the initial cost is a but pricey but so worth
---
hey stop posting these screenshots thanks
---
No one seems to mind that much about this reasonable nerf. Just a couple of people playing devil's advocate as always.
---
Youre literally playing the premium version of a cowclicker dude. Nice job on the obvious state of denial you are in.
---
Everyone who talks about zmi has no idea what they’re talking about. “Up to 150k” lol
---
You're welcome :)
---
My go-to has always been onyx bolts (e), they alch at a slight profit.
---
At your level there are much more viable options tho, plenty of lunar spells that break even / profit while getting 100k+/h or you could always burst nechs/dust devils if you're not looking for something AFK.
---
I‘m using teamviewer for almost 3 years now and never had any problems
---
So tick eating basically?
---
Yw
---
then its time for the hotfix
---
a lot of people in my old mythic guild started playing because i was spending almost no time on wow and all my time in runescape, when they asked me why i just said "it has more content and is more rewarding to progress in"
---
you can't overcome the 5 minute runescape sniff test tho. people either fucking hate the game or play it for the rest of their damn lives.
---
I have this! It’s really disappointing you can’t slide them through each other.
---
u got me alread at new pvp area i would love it! nice concept!
---
I wouldn't say so, I started as a hardcore when I started my iron because there was no downside to it
---
Filter yo spellbook my dude
---
You could´buy a service of running accs providing you essence at the ZMI altar. Could reach like 150-200k xp/h with this expensive method. You won't be able to trade anymore, after the nerf has been implemented. The devblog before they implemented ZMI claimed that 50k-ish would be the max rate, that's partially why it's being nerfed.
---
Plenty of people did zmi before running was a thing
---
Can Make-X Smithing be brought in line with the rest of Make X, similar to the recent Goldsmithing QoL update?  Currently you can left click the anvil but have to right click &gt; X to select how many items you want to smith. Can it be changed to set an amount &amp; left click the item the same as other skills?  It's no more than the other skills have and it would make smithing a lot less aggravating when doing large batches of the same item.
---
Besides the fact that you are playing a failed account
---
What?
---
How do people do mlm without a hammer in invent ?
---
It’s like a free 2k smithing xp an hour lol
---
Using GIMP, huh?
---
this is default in rs3 without any add-in
---
aww :(
---
skilling - e2effBN
---
wdr - gREZC7f
---
zmi - dtEqAD8
---
i don't think it's photoshopped
---
oh so thats why the ZMI changes are happening
---
I didn't say that but nice reading comprehension.
---
cheetoman sucks
---
Hcim dying by world lag occured more this month im sure
---
Chrome* remote desktop
---
Rs07 is boring, they need to make changes and make it into pre-eoc rs, you are playing a game that is over 10 years old

Why?

They have to deal with the failure somehow. Throwing away an acc you've invested a lot of time in probably isn't the answer, so they continue playing on it.

Opt-out of the redesign. I've never had to type "old" at the start of the URL to use the retro design..

Sorry what? Were the polled rates the expected for solo players? I think it’s sort of obvious that the rate for running will be higher than the solo rate. Why is that a problem, especially considering it costs 18-20m per hour
---
The current OS dev team should be fired. simple as that.
---
Runners was never an issue.

Or because they're just casuals who doesn't care.

Bruh like one time I was in the wilderness and this guy that was like not my combat level attacked me but it's ok he apologized so I slapped his ass with the quickness
---
Nice.

Runelite.

Membership speeds up the leveling a lot too. You can do waterfall quest right off the start for 30 attack and strength for example.
---
You can I've gotten 80 kills at Cerberus now mobile only.  Only part that is annoying is the ghosts really.

Or just taking your laptop with you to the bathroom

What are the teams thoughts on making Spirit Seeds tradable?
---
It wasn’t really removed - it just can no longer be used from the launcher you’d normally use. They already were discussing that change when Settled posted that episode
---
Even if you don't agree entirely with suggestions like these, they still do a great job of sparking creative ideas. It's nice.
---
Did you just upload and not even read it 😂😂

Oh wow that image is huge and it looks like a normal screenshot, it’s also so clear and crisp. Absolutely stunning, what phone is that?

I'm even lower melee stats than you and i just hit 93 2 days ago lol but to be fair I bursted a ton of tasks.

If that's the case, internet users don't have a fucking clue what a storefront is.

Rune dagger has a higher Magic attack bonus than a Rune scimitar

It's easyscape, theres no need to eliminate more clicks on this game. Already easy enough to bank all your items fast enough and needs no more buffs.

Is there a reason to not be getting exactly 88% With Two worms, 1 rat and 1 skelly? I've been doing barrows as a money maker as I don't think i'm ready for Zulrah yet in terms of stats and just wanna make sure i'm doing it right, here's my KC so far: https://i.imgur.com/x816qYR.png

once i was my with my friend in the wildy and there was some stairs deep in the wildy
---
so we tried to run in and there was a f2p clan which rushed us my friend didnt made it alive out but me i was the lucky one i laughed the shit out of me was funny af he raged and im since then laughing over him vecause of that 
---
ahhh i loved that times:)
---
All of the above

The konar shit was a massive overreaction. Her tasks were (and are) absolute shit unless you had a huge stockpile of points to skip constantly. The extra drop table was a bonus for doing shit tasks. Now Konar is basically dead content because without a substantial reward for doing Konar tasks they're just not worth it, outside of maybe hitting her up for milestone tasks to get more points.
---
If you want to slay for money, you do slayer bosses and demonic gorillas, which is a hell of a lot less likely to be assigned at Konar (impossible in the case of gorillas). A 1 in 25,000 chance of a 2500 brew drop doesn't change that. I think it's very, very likely that her drops could've remained completely untouched and she'd still be dead content today.
---
Damn bro. I'm at 2k with no claw as well. I feel your pain, but not to this extent.
---
Probably not unless you really enjoy tithe farm. 400 points would take ages and I doubt time saved in the future will exceed time spent on the outfit if you aren't going for 200mil xp. On the other hand, tithe farm is actually pretty fun and relatively quick farming xp that you can do actively so if you dont hate it it doesnt hurt. Theres no right way to level.
---
If you go to the g/e (Grand Exchange) you can buy any tradeable item in the game!
---
Thats the whole point of the reward of mountain daughter
---
I used to shit in a sock, until I realized I could also use it as a cum sock at the same time. Unfortunately the shit should solidify in the sock, preventing my semen from being able to absorb into the texture of the sock. The solution I found was to microwave it for approximately 45 seconds after both shitting and cumming into the sock, which really helps it to absorb and make more space for round two.
---
Or inventory
---
Not all do. I mainly play desktop. But I play mobile to grind tasks and afk shit while I work when I get some down time. Some things could change on mobile for quality of life I just wish the interface was customizable to a sense. Cause that chat box would be gone if it was fuck tryna talk to people on mobile lol.
---
I ain't saying to afk it, just telling the boss isn't balanced for the time to kill it needs, I just said a boss giving 30k/h isn't a broken thing since you have the option to do tasks afk for more exp. You told "30k+ slay xp/h" is a problem in this case and I'm just saying 30k slay xp/h isn't something whenn you have better options to chose when you just want exp.
---
Give a call to MIT they will want to award you the degree now
---
Not a lot of money to be made with magic in f2p. Switching to member's is gonna be worth it at some point. You're going to level faster and make way more money in the higher levels.
---
As to what the other guy said, fire spells are (almost) always gonna be your best attack option on the regular spellbook.

It's been so long with no concrete evidence posted on the sub that I'm pretty sure they aren't bugged. The most likely thing is that people using the bottomless compost bucket and attas together just miss ultracomposting the patch (it's easier to do with bcb because you don't have separate buckets in your inventory) and then get less than 6 herbs.
---
If it were actually bugged, by now there would almost certainly be some record of the bug.
---
Nop
---
I like this idea for the antlions
---
It is, but it's occasionally worth a laugh. I'm just doing it because it's basically mandatory at this point.
---
It’s not balance, it’s the way probability works. Expected value is the average as the number of rolls tend toward infinity. 1/300 means your expected value is 1 per 300 kills. Even if you got 5 in your first 5 KC, this is what you’ll trend toward over time.
---
Not to mention it's a great free travel method to canifis
---
People wont pay more than they did at ZMI, the xp rates are much lower.
---
Nice bro looks sweet!

DND in a nutshell too. It’s basically just cumbersome in most cases and is just QOL like why would anyone wanna carry feathers to plume helmets.

If you need specific advice on herb runs. Or good orders and habits. Let me know. But that sounds like a perfect plan.

Would be pretty cool to have a timestamp of how old your hc was at death.

Cool idea. I hate the desert though so I'm fine without it I think haha.
---
I have around 550kc on mobile. It's not really that bad...just can't woox walk cause my phone has little ping spikes every now and then.
---
I'm debating whether I should try to max a skill on my free to play account. I have 73 woodcutting and 75 firemaking just from cutting and burning willows, and I'm not necessarily planning on getting a membership soon. More realistically I'll probably just grind melee stats for Dragon Slayer.
---
Also, are willows really the fastest way to max woodcutting on free-to-play? Everywhere I search says this but it still feels like yews give enough experience to offset the lower experience gain rate.
---
Who cares?
---
it's fucking 2k19. Use youtube/google to find good guides.

Bruh it was a joke.

Recently got the itch to get into runescape again. Now battling with my self to stay f2p and get 70 att before mems or deciding I’ll actually play if I get mems and going for childhood dreams. I always wanted to wear full bandos with a god sword but was always into Pures.

He’s using the 2010 interface on runelite

It is yes, but needs to be approved IIRC by jagex or else be used at your own risk.
---
Never said it wasn't for good just kind of distasteful post in spite of what's going on there at the time.
---
Lmao your such a pussy, why would anyone in there mind deny a 500m kill, fucking dumbshit
---
Seriously, that one took me so long to complete...
---
Definitely the first one
---
That’s pretty much exactly what I’m doing, but without the BGS spec.
---
On the bright side you made 178k from the grind so it's not all bad.
---
Rng isn't something you can ruin
---
I’m pretty sure it’s a joke

I've never done it, just heard from a friend. I'll pass your recommendation on to him 👍

I think it's just this sub's way of discussing current events and their relation to the game without being a bleeding heart about it all

This is one of the more satisfying videos I’ve seen on this sub in a long time lmaoooo.

They have been dealing with gambling in an ongoing fashion. Do you think the little horses say "say neigh to gambling" cuz that's what they said in 2005? 
---
Emblem farming is a real problem, but legitimately hard to solve whereas the zmi one is comparatively pretty simple so they're solving the one they can right now. I'm seeing a company taking reasonable steps in a reasonable order.

The drop tables are already trash and bosses like Scorpios and Vet are annoying a'f to kill

Absolute no reason to patch

Fk'ng RIP man, hate it when I accidentally get 99 def

If a single entity "imposes" socialism, its not socialism you dunce.  Go back to T_D

Why would you stay in f2p to get 70 atk when that would take forever and you'd get it way faster in members
---
feel free to link a vid of 165k lavas with runners

Sure thing!
---
What about being 100% mobile so it's not a concern
---
Shit looks like it’s a KQ pet in that form

Maxing in f2p is a good way to make you never want to play osrs again.
---
A new pyramind, imagines, lessor gods, Menephos.. I like it

When I take fiber (Metamucil) shitting is wonderful. Getting fiber through veggies in your diet is the best way... but if you don’t want to eat tons of veggies then supplementing will make your shits glide out like your asshole is coated in Teflon.
---
I couldn't hear you past that 12'' Bernie 2016-branded dildo
---
Thats assuming you’re in max gear and killing efficiently which he wont be anymore...what I meant was, the dwh alone could take him 500 hours to get. So he lost a lot of his BIS and would more than likely need to obtain them items again to efficiently kill shamans if you get what I’m saying. Its gunna be a long time before hes back on the dwh grind, he may need another blowipe which in itself could be a tedious task.
---
I believe you need to speak to Oziach first.
---
Cant tell if hes happy or in a recurring state of pain from all of that agility
---
I can just imagine the size of the development lot would probably taken up the entire F2P map including the wilderness...
---
If you die a pvm desth (majority dealt by a monster) then no. If you die a pvp death then yes. 
---
Glories for abyss. You're kinda just wasting time loading the house and running to the box every time.
---
Lavas best exp, zmi more afk (still not really)
---
The amount of people salty on this post shows what too much osrs and not enough female interaction does to a man
---
Also pures don't have to claim the xp to complete the quest anymore(it gives like 2k prayer XP)
---
That quest was ez literally just overhead prayer
---
Can still get free casts at wildy fountain of rune. Also i never turn that boss on but i think u can pick up those runes still and cast it on the boss.
---
But you have thermy pet in your inventory which means it was most likely following you at the time and the kq pet drop went into your inventory and shocked you there, instead of following you.
---
I mean obviously using piety would help lol
---
Yes you get hurt, but it takes while to add up.  When I did it I'd bring a few brews, but I had 99 hp so I used hp cape + regen bracelet
---
Also in this community afk = low focus.  If you can get near max efficiency while watching netflix then it's "afk"
---
Huh TIL. Despite recoloring mine twice I didn’t know that. Noob indeed
---
Nah, it’s because I never did the quest lol
---
Yeah his are still pretty much exactly as they've always been, if that style suits you then it is fine.
---
Go for pet grinds.

I sold bandos for spectral idk if it's worth at this point as I seem to suck at pray flicking these things even after almost 80 kills.

Nice therapy pet flex
---
What is going on with group ironman? Will it happen in 2019, and what is the plan?
---
Start an ironman.
---
So like 80% of the gear in game?
---
As the masses cheer from the sidewalk
---
what kind of fucking freak has 60 theiving...and 80 firemaking, i hate you
---
Does the chance to roll a clue still happen below 88%?
---
You mean like feathers for an arrowshaft? Hmm...
---
Honestly stop promoting efficiency and let the man have fun.
---
You can talk to a banker and you won't have to put you bank pin in if you log back in within 5 mins from the same up
---
It's very nice for quick hoping
---
Realistically how much do you think implementing this method would buff most xp rates and kills per hour for bosses? My understanding is that this would literally only save a couple of clicks at a time, which couldn't even be more than a couple seconds every time you bank.
---
I would begin to call it easyscape if it realistically buffs all xp rates and kills per hour by even like 3-5%, but I just have a hard time seeing it buff even 1%. That's why I see it as qol.
---
What reminds of easyscape are things like an additional 20% damage and accuracy buff to a crossbow. That's just game breaking right there.

Air Orbs are pretty good at 66 if you're looking to make a bit of money on the way. Also good for crafting if you're at the right level.

K cool downvote i was just asking a legit question
---
step one: dont stake
---
New ironman here.
---
1. I have 51 thieving. Is it worth doing pyramid plunder now, or should I train to 71? I don't plan to put a thousand hours into this account, and I probably won't get a single 99.
---
2. What's the fastest way to get from 31 to 40 smithing? I have 50 mining.
---
3. Is it worth training slayer early on and using it for combat training, or should I get base 70s first?
---
Can't im a Pker :S
---
Piety is huge, you'll definitely want to be using that. Also, if you've got a b ring (i) you'll definitely want that
---
Thanks for the downvote
---
Shiet i had been getting the racks on my ironman before i upgraded to a bp. I shoulda just bought the racks all along

Bbbut but you had food left
---
With the farming contracts in the farming guild,  is it possible to remove the fruit tree patch tasks from easy assignments? or give us an option to either pay with gp/seeds in order to skip that task.
---
I'm at a 7 way right now and it feels kinda silly. I couldn't imagine adding another 2 pairs of boots to switch
---
You’re using super pots? What’s your magic lvl? Mine is 85 and I usually only get hit one every few hits. If yours is lower maybe a magic pot might help a bit? Or maybe just getting really unlucky.
---
Since you downvoted me I'll be real and say you probably just suck if ice troll killed you rofl
---
Except all the new gear?
---
Yes that would be the other 20%...
---
What kind of build?
---
Rest easy King
---
For bh style pking it aint that big a deal. 95% of people only do 1 way switches. Even two way aint bad. It just goes from “you have to try to fuck up” to “i have to try to not fuck up.”  
---
Also we only had 1 world for both pvp and bh, uk, for 4 years. West coast still pked on it. People in eu were just spoiled.
---
Congrats man

Quit if your dumb enough to get cleaned and ask reddit for help

Darkscape is cool and dmm is cool they just need to have it be a just for fun, with a yearly reset on 45

76 mage. Maybe? I killed him once when I was cb lvl 90 or so. But more recently I’ve had to tele our 3 times.

I honestly feel bad that they can’t even attempt to enjoy a humor post like this, even though I know it isn’t particularly funny.
---
She thought it was funny and had fun with it, it wasn’t serious
---
Nani!?
---
It's a video game homie, if you wanna play it play it and if you don't then don't. Nobody can make you and it isn't actually meaningful in the scheme of things so if you don't play you won't be worse off. If you wanna go learn to cook or rock climb or play soccer nobody will be upset with you lol.
---
I just have to do the Defender role now for my last 375 points and I'm dreading it, simply for the fact that I'm gonna slow down/ruin the game for the other people unlucky enough to recruit me.
---
Meanwhile I run into buttfuck nowhere just to drop trade 200k over to my alt.

Not just prices, but item specs as well. Sometimes I want to know what I'm buying before I buy it and compare it to what I'm using.  Or looking up npc weakness, ect.

Dude, for like the 50th time, it was because zmi rates were polled

Alllllll these other comparisons don't have polled XP rates.

Lumbridge has a store south of the castle entrance that stocks axes and a bronze pickaxe. The general store north of the castle has a hammer, tinderbox and other useful things.

Fair. A graphical update need not be "Identical to RS3". Not to mention RS3's graphics are moderately to severely inconsistent, since at least a quarter of the stuff in it isn't terribly far updated from mid-late RS2 if updated at all.

you sure ur guy wasn't lifting his leg to let a fart rip?

The consensus is barrows gloves.

reddit loves taking steps in removing the "reasonable" out of "reasonable complaints."

So either you're full of shit or your rng on hits is godly,

I figured I'd try it out.

2:04

2:27
---
3:01
---
2:22
---
That's 8 kills and i survived on 22hp.
---
Yes I do have SGS.
---
No I did not get a food drop, but regardless of that, when I do it my way I don't run out of food until like 13 kills and the time on kills didn't lower at all. Which makes sense btw since they don't have any def, this is like going to kraken or bloodvelds with full offensive gear. It makes no sense, it's dumb and stupid as I have just proven.
---
Now you can all keep being ignorant, but at least I can say I've tested it. Which you can't.
---
I'd love to see a screen of your PB btw. But I doubt I'll get it.
---
And you can't argue about me not having gotten food drops this trip, because clearly the time just does not decrease. Small sample? Sure, but as you stated you "rarely hit the 2min mark **ever**", this shouldn't matter. 8 kills, all are above 2 min.
---
I'll do another trip with my gear now and post those results aswell. Cya in like an hour.
---
Ahh okay, thank you!
---
Weird cash stack flex but okay
---
Kinda sexy, kinda no context.  Looks good bud.
---
20FPS? 
---
Task manager -&gt; Details -&gt; RS Client -&gt; Set affinity -&gt; Only check CPU1 
---
There you go, constant 50FPS even at wintertodt.
---
yeet
---
But where is tho?
---
It's funny, because anything else they add to the game unpolled gets reeeeeeeeee's left and right on reddit's part. Yet this is okay for some reason?
---
A cow is definitely going to do damage on you through the dharoks lmfaoooooo

How easy/hard is it to earn bonds in game
---
Pretty damn clear it was an oversight.
---
Why are nokbs that can't even afford a tbow replying to this post
---
Then you shouldn’t be getting wilderness tasks. What task was it?
---
The wilderness God wars dungeon doesn't have any bosses, just the mobs like the main room of the non-wilderness gwd and the same mechanic that they're aggressive if you don't have an item of their god.
---
The benefit of the wilderness gwd is that mobs drop ecumenical keys, which can be used to skip getting the killcount to enter boss rooms of the regular gwd.
---
Wow, I didn't know Task Manager could realtime inject an OpenGL renderer into a Java engine from 2003.

If you dont have any non-prayer armor I'd get some. You'll save a lot of money on prayer pots (or sanity from flicking) as a lot of tasks don't need to be done with prayer.

Fashionscape..getting 99 in ANYTHING and bragging about it to my friends. Eventually poorly PKing with bad pures cuz it was fun. Now it’s just any skill I can AFK while I work or when I have time working on maxing my account.

When didn't the game have f2p? It's been f2p as long as a remember with having extra content for members. Now it's more f2p than ever. You don't have to spend a penny on the game to have membership. Stop being pissy because everything isn't perfect how you want it to be. All I ever see on this sub is complaining about stupid shit and never a serious issue.

Scum

**Can you guys do some cleanup on the Mushroom Meadow in Fossil Island?**

It tanks the performance on my computer and on mobile as well. Pretty sure it's the 30,000 mushroom polys all over the place, and to be honest they're an eyesore anyway.

I understand if something epic is going to eat up PC resources to create an awesome visual effect, but some rinky dink mushroom meadow shouldn't be pushing my computer to its limits.

I would be totally cool with making the remote areas of the desert pvp. Maybe only like lvl 5-10 pvp tho.
---
You look like an absolute unit
---
no idea, I only watch a handful of osrs youtubers, however I do plan to finish the series before christmas, sorry if it doesn't interest you man! :( (I credited the person I saw do it on my 1st vid tho) hopefully some of my future stuff will interest you, thanks for the reply.

fletching unstrung longbows is pretty chill
---
the warning that looks exactly like high risk worlds? on a world that isnt 325 that most ppl arent used to pvp worlds cycling between worlds.

Don’t forget the rune boots one that casually requires 80 slayer

During 1 firecape attempt or a bunch, 1 attempt isnt 61 to 68
---
Thanks man, made some decent profit, I only grinded it cuz it was afk &amp; needed some cash for my videos lmao, I'll have some better ones soon :D
---
I'll be the asshole here then.  You actually deserved this.  Hacking is SO FUCKING COMMON in this game, and you didn't even bother to take the basic steps to protect yourself.  You've learned the lesson the hard way, good luck on the rebuild.
---
Yeah  in melee tank gear with protect from magic on I usually take very little damage, so I just overhead from two sips, take it, drink my third dose, then restore for 25 of the 30 lost prayer points
---
Well, saying you don't like something is one thing. But saying, "Stay out" is another thing to me. Maybe I'm misreading the situation, maybe I'm looking at it as, "You're some lesser moron who would hurt the game" when it's just, "Well if you don't like it, just don't come over here". I'm able to be wrong, it just actively confuses me as to why this particular topic seems to be so uniquely reviled.
---
you can eat to full when the white ranged attack is fired and not lose any ticks. 
---
If you don't, you can tank the spawn with a shark+karambwan.
---
Showing less information (threads/comments) and creating more ad space is not an improvement for the end user. If you really work in software, you'd know that.

i wish i was dead

Atleast real life is actual hardcore mode.

KEEP PVP IN WILDERNESS
---
It's not, but it's fucking delicious
---
The inferno is already hard, would be obscene if you had to drop more supplies for prayer.
---
I didnt click that guy but i went from 92-93 farming without a hespori seed.
---
Lmfaooooooo
---
press the camera icon at the top right courner :)
---
Snipping tool is your friend
---
It was kill green dragons
---
personal points doesn't increase chance for drop in your name, the total team points increase chance for a drop. Who gets the drop is random.
---
Yes I got green dragons
---
Honestly yeah you do. It's not hard with bp and blessed dhide
---
Our ironmen have very similar levels. Im working on medium diaries and barrow gloves atm. Longer term goal is mort/varrock/ardy hard and barrows.
---
Should say "hahaha look at this noob, he was a HCIM before BTW" when ex HCIMers walk next to him.
---
The amount of points you have divided by the total points is your chance of getting the drop in your name. So if you had 10k/50k total points, you have a %20 chance at a drop in your name.
---
Thought for a second that this was just another, absolutely excellent photoshop
---

This is magical lol
---
You didnt even 1hit the cow
---
If the servers are lagging the entire game will freeze, meaning you can't actually die or take damage... Your internet is shit, not the servers
---
That's what we thought, but I'm not sure if that's even the case, so I'm confused.
---
Killer Random events. At Seer’s maples there was a guy who died wearing Dh pl8 and legs, whip, glory and a Santa hat. All of the WCers knew this fool was logged out. And we just waited as this god tier player got pelted to death by 1’s(compared to us noobs. Whips were around 20m and Santa’s were under 3m. The glory was about 60k). I picked up the glory and the Santa hat. 
---
I was the cool kid among my friends at school for like 3 days...!
---
It's amazing! It's the only game where my 600mb/s internet is bad!
---
Post like these are a lot more annoying than 1 line of text in runescape
---
Give buddy some weed mayn
---
Logging out
---
They could nerf ToB, but they shouldn't.  The rewards are uniques, with values  that are set by the playerbase and are natural results.  
---
I've got no problem with someone dumping a boat load of gp on a skill, and I know people run other runes, but my concern is just that Runecrafting shouldn't be THIS buyable. Other skills are, and that's fine.
---
That’s not all that bad if you don’t wanna skip it. Just bring 3 items plus anti fire shield and go to the ones in lvl 13 wildy above edgeville if you can find an open world. But if you just don’t wanna bother you can skip it though turiel in butthrope but it will reset your task streak
---
oh... i honestly didnt even realize thats what that button did. lol okay ill keep that in mind now
---
If by 'fix it' you mean 'made it so the game does it for you,' sure.
---
It's 2m+/hr even if you leave every single drop except zenyte on the ground
---
All joking aside, how long does 99 rcing take?
---
only slayer staff and i think staff of the dead can autocast it. other staves cant.
---
At least you can get a task for the next one and get that 20% slayer helm boost :)
---
He's just virtue signalling to all the misanthropes in the world. Don't mind him.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssIY8NYwvh4
---
TIL! Thanks.
---
The devs already said that prayer flicking was a skill and was acceptable considering the effort vs supplies saved
---
You can get Jad tasks without kc. Its only inferno ywhere you cant
---
Why not allow runecraft to be a massive waste of gp to boost rates slightly?  This just allows players to play within the mechanics in a unique way. I think it is an amazing way for players to interact for mutual gain.
---
Dont need a website, only spawn that matters is Jad really and he spawns where the lvl 45 spawns on wave 3, or where the orange 360 spawns on wave 62. On a main account it's really easy to lure the 180s/90s/360s regardless of where they spawn.
---
Can we really call them people though
---
Damn that’s whack.
---
The only time I die is trying to Wood walk, I’m stubborn in that I demand I get it down perfectly and it becoming second nature because in the long run it will add a lot more kills.
---
Nut shack

Yup, your account gets locked if you die without buying those lives
---
This picture is taken from inside the camp, where you don't need a rope regardless of mountain daughter completion. The guard will let you leave at any time, just not come in.
---
That’s definitely a concern, but there are solutions. The lamps could require players to remove all equipment before usage. Achievement and quest items could have the skill requirements attached to reward items. Maybe lamps would only remove up to a base level which accounts for quest reward xp.
---
Thanks!
---
I read Venazuela pet and thought  why isn't it a green dragon.
---
Can we please just disable exp already
---
I'll be pissed but I will 100% vote yes to this.
---
This wastes a inv space because with dusts + laws + chaos in your rune pouch you have your home tele and crumble undead runes all in 1 slot. With a staff youd need to waste a spot on teletabs.
---
Yeah you did lol
---
Not sure why this post is getting any hate.. Seems great to me man I don't agree with everything, but I love the effort.
---
Fast money or fast xp?
---
what i recomend for starting bridding on a pure is these stats:
---
50 att
---
78 str
---
1 def
---
79 hp
---
45 prayer
---
85 in both mage and range
---
the money needed to train a account like this is dependent on how fast you want to do it. you can use the wiki training guides on how to train the different skills [link](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Skill_training_guides)
---
What many people don't know is that the new layout has 3 settings. Card, classic and compact view. It's on card view by default but that one sucks. Classic view is fairly similar to the old one and compact actually can fot wya more threads on the screen than the old one.
---
Marginal xp increase or marginal gp increase ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Thank you!
---
must be leveling his walking skill....
---
Both lul
---
Killer BOB
---
Yeah it def needs a little tweaking haha
---
99 range was a goal i had for quite a long time. Now ive nearly got it 3 times
---
How do I delete someones comment!?
---
took about 4ish hours to make but like 2.5 hours to render haha, i have a p bad computer.
---
Any GWD and DK's would probably work.
---
I got a pet, better post it on reddit! no one has ever done that!!
---
Is att/str really that necessary at first? (Against pvmers)? I know i'll definitely need it down the road when i hop into bountry hunter and so on, but i reckon at wildy, i can do with mage/range only? 
---
Plus, questing att/str is probably the best idea, right?
---
Thanks! I think I am planning on making a high rez version of Silverlight or something
---
This is cool. Can you give me a TL;DR on what blender is?
---
Thanks man, i cheked them out too. Keep up the good work!
---
I'd be ok with the recolor and the inferno Jad if they required you to do inferno to get them. No way giving firecapers that shit is gunna pass.
---
It's called RNG my guy, how are you doing raids and not know this. It's the same way someone gets a Tbow on 1KC.
---
you can drop it and pick it back up and sell it instantly
---
That sound happens on pc too, even when I have sounds disabled. Never knew what causes it.
---
They change things immediately, aka, there isn't a delay on it and they don't send you an email with a link to cancel pending changes. Because there are no pending changes. They don't email you about that.
---
Moving to teach. Thanks for the heads up! I’ve been paying through s subscription on the iTunes store so I think it’ll be fine on that end.
---
There I was. Minding my own business. Autoclick alching the coinstack I bought online in the comfort of my own home that the guy who I bought this account from built from scratch. I went to stop alching so I could stake my whole bank for a tbow so I could finally beat elvarg when it happened. I didn’t disengage my autoclicker. It was over before it began. I spec’d 42 of my p ess mining alts I kept around to make it look like I had friends with my crystal halberd. Instantly maxed combat stats. 200m all. My zerker that I spent so much time saving the money to buy completely wasted.
---
Can't feel bad for people with no account security. You live and you learn.
---
I mod several subreddits and can see traffic stats for those subs: more people use the redesign than old.reddit.com.
---
It's not so bad, but when you initially start using it it is put in card mode by default. That's arguably the worst mode to use. The other 2 are way more user friendly.
---
great question
---
Just ask Jagex to fix it and I'm sure they'll set you back to 70m prayer xp.
---

Just use Redemption + Rapid heal w/ a HP Cape or a Regen bracelet. As long as you dont get brazier smacked you RARELY take enough damage to trigger redemption + die, and you carry a couple brews on you just in case.
---
Home TP each round and reset HP.

If you buy mems you'll unlock a ton more contact, therefore you'll probably play more.

yeah, its a free 3D modeling tool but it can do a lot more. Like I 3d modeled everything in the scene, made the trees with a plugin, created the materials procedurally, and rendered the scene all in blender. If your curious I could send you the project file for this scene.
---
Yeah, but there is same probability of getting 2 zeynte shards in 30 kc making it 30m/h :)
---
Nice, I wonder if it still says that on 3scape now after the mining update.
---
Thanks! Yeah this is my first attempt at making a fully edited video like this, so I think I'll improve. 
---
And yeah I plan to use emerald bolts (e) in the fight caves, which I've done on other accounts before.
---
That seems to be the way. I was planning to do Temple Trekking for silver bars for crafting because fuck merchantman-mode, but now I'm not so sure.

The issue is pretty cut and dry- ZMI was polled at a certain exp rate and the rates are currently exceeding that dramatically.
---
Never knew this lol
---
Sure! I get bored sometimes, and doing stuff like this has always interested me.
---
you dont play the game.
---
Glad it wasn't just me who keeps getting logged out
---
IIRC it was like that when ironman first came out, but they added the DC insurance afterwards
---
False report. Good luck with that.  Turn your public chat off or go watch it because people are going to spoil shit.
---
Those bf clans were actually so toxic lol I used to hop around and find the world on my ironman and they'd sit there swearing and screaming at me for not paying or being in the cc
---
Can we get an NPC (maybe in the Farming Guild) that would plant saplings for a fee in the same vein as the unfinished potion maker?
---
Same man let’s get a beer
---
That's just funny though, not some good old school drama.
---
This hit me right in the feels. He seemed like a very cool dude.
---
Time to commit seppuku
---
I am groot
---
how? i dont take pics lol
---
Sure, but not everyone can do it *right*.
---
That's all that has been stopping me from getting a fire cape. ... and the panic I can't seem to stop myself from experiencing.
---
ooooo ouch pat yourself on the back for that one. Couldn't tell you were one of the elietist.
---
Yes, with this: "See it for the good. Soon, the corrupt socialist dictator that destroyed an entire country will be swinging from a rope for the world to see."
---
Don’t care, I just wanted the cape
---
I didn’t say zmi, I said zmi running. They require runners to have 75 for the big pouch and lunar to tele to the bank to get more ess for the person they’re running for.
---
Got those back when they were 1.5m
---
On newer phones the quality is flawless. My IPhone X makes it look HD
---
How much do you Play?
---
If you don't need it, don't bring it. More weight means your run energy drains faster.
---
Nothing helps run speed but you can get weight reducing gear which will make your energy drain slower. I think under 0kg doesn't make a difference, nor does over 60-something.
---
Lotta stuff to get in there, I'll work on it for part 2
---
Just realized, Jagex will need to add some additional null squares to cover the result bars by the yes/no
---
Done this twice and people still wonder why I'd prefer to do mep2 than bother with regicide again.
---
they will never fix money making alts, because that'll hurt them in their own pockets.
---
Random events like drill demon/Molly/Pinball trolls do exactly that though. That’s why I’m curious how this is different.
---
Unless you’re killing high def dragons (black brutal, vork, etc.) BP is the best range dps. Anguish, peg boots, barrows gloves, Ava’s assembler, and archer ring (i) before upgrading to arma.
---
They got me too, took a couple months break, came back and everything was gone. What i don't understand is i had a authenticator and a bank pin... Luckily it wasn't anywhere near maxed but definitely lost about 100m.. All this player has!
---
&gt;With the new elf armor, it'll be a lot more accessible for most. Player flicking should have been nerfed a long time ago.
---
Link to stats of new elf armor?
---
Yeah just getting a lamp would be so much better than them designing interactive content
---
People like pvm, you can't expect them to update the game in a way only you want when a majority want pvm
---
What you want =/= what works
---
The account kempq is banned, brainlet.
---
People stroke their dicks so hard for dhing in nmz but it actually sucks till u have 90+ stats. Use the obby setup for strength and a whip for attack.
---
I like the way you think
---
How could you justify that tho. It cheapens the necessity for high prayer. If we’re being honest here, protection prayers are terrible game design as well (which is why it was removed in rs3). Now, I’d never call for the nerfing of overheads but we shouldnt have a mechanic that makes you invincible if you continuously click a button. Additionally clicking a button is not fun, and this is a game after all.
---
The exact criteria for eligibility wasn't publicly shown, so we can't be absolutely sure what you need.
---
Has the account ever been a member before?
---
same
---
this is like the epitome of the meme
---
How do you know this?
---
I play at work, saves me time at home to get my RS fix.
---
XD i play osrs so i have to hate rs3 even though ive never played it XD
---
Yes, but if you want to duo wt(best way to get pet, and gives a ton of con XP) your screwed, ofc w9 is easy, but trying to stay there for more than 3 mins at 99 hp is pretty costly
---
Yeah, the guy you're referring to is Chymistry. He's a mentor on We Do Raids. Also, all your info is good and all bro, but if you have any specific questions, try keeping it succinct. Keeping it short and simple will allow people to help you out more effectively.
---
Maybe in a wt world where you're only going for 500 points
---
But it's cancer if you're trying to solo/duo
---
Make it so dangerous that you need to risk good Armour or monsters kill you so that way it encourages pvp and make the monsters drop dope stuff like “Bag of Sand” which when thrown at enemies causes them to hit a 0 for next attack and when examined it says “is this what a boob feels like”. It’ll be stupid expensive 1 time use wep so the price is high and pvp won’t be ruined
---
So this kind of post has been a long time coming for me. 
---
I’ve intentionally held back my comments to try &amp; better see what a lot of the discussion tended to focus on when it came to both Warding as a concept &amp; new skills in general. Though the most recent dev blog was the thing that really pushed me from being a bit of a fence-sitter &amp; onto the side of thinking Warding as a skill just isn’t being made for the right reasons &amp; wouldn’t result in the best possible version of OSRS for the future. 
---
I’ve genuinely tried to be as fair, insightful, thorough, constructive &amp; critical as possible. But I’ve also tried to be brutally honest &amp; of course, like all things, this post is going to be steeped in my own personal bias &amp; opinions. That much is unavoidable. I’m mostly just curious at this point to see what people think to some of the things I’ve said here, whether there’s agreement or disagreement, &amp; why that is. 
---
#For those who came straight to the comments, the overall TL:DR of the post is as follows:
---
- We need to definitively establish just how many people are for &amp; how many are against the notion of a new skill altogether, once &amp; for all, via a simple, unambiguous, in game poll.
---
- I personally like the idea of a new skill(s), at some point. However I do not think we ever *need* a new skill, &amp; would rather see no new skill than a bad new skill. 
---
- I very much like a lot of the proposed Warding content ideas &amp; topics covered within the skill pitch, &amp; would like to see much of it come into the game in some way.
---
- Battle Wards sound wholly inappropriate &amp; would turn Warding into a literal combat skill, while pushing OSRS away from some of its core sensibilities &amp; design philosophies. 
---
- I believe we would end up with a better OSRS if most of the good Warding ideas were pursued as additions to existing content &amp; taken as individual projects tackled 1 at a time, while separating out new skill discussion into its own much broader &amp; deeper conversation. 
---
- I think the notion that any new skill should only ever be a simplistic copy-paste replica of an existing skill is both irrational &amp; inconsistent with how most people are open to wildly different experiences when it comes to new PvM, PvP, Quest, Minigame &amp; other content.
---
I'd say it's more panic because flicking prayers is probably unnecessary for the fight caves on a regular main account
---
Sure thing buddy.
---
haha ouch! thanks for replying though, I'm leaning towards thinking this situation just bad luck too. I'm going to start keeping a record of how many trees I've gone without one and go from there
---
They already said that it was because they had polled XP rates and runners were breaking that
---
It's not the runners, you can still run lavas, it was the fact that it was breaking a poll
---
Chally tho, They were way more vague about

hi bro, was wondering how these accounts panned out for you?? I might be interested in following suit based on your feedback.
---
what else is there?
---
I only really noticed the sara-brew inferno thing not sure where that even came from in the first place but I think he was pissed off because someone brought it mainstream (but it was already public)  and it was patched before his video dropped.
---
Yeah but at least you have a main, right?

If reddit can't do it nerf it to the ground, if reddit can do it don't you dare touch it. That's why everyone cheered for the zulrah nerf and everyone raged at the konar drop table nerf.

Go for 500 total and telegrab the wines upstairs.
---
Let me guess, you're one of those "PVP is the most skilled content in the game" kids with one failed attempt at inferno?
---
The players that are opposed to prayer flicking are those that aren't good at it - simple
---
Blow pipe is good. Also craw bow  in the wilderness at chaise druids is like 85k xp per hour
---
That takes 75 range? I'm 70
---
If you wear the red monk robes top and bottom you can telegrab just the upper level wines but you need 500 total.

Planted over 1k ranarr seeds never got 18.

damn they're down to 6m now... I know when I got mine way back when, it was 18m

My bad, you're right.
---
Best if unlimited budget would probably be to chin to 75 for blowpipe then.
---
Makes sense. I'm gonna grind out assembler than go back to gorillas, then.
---
Thanks for the informed response!
---
Do the quest lmao
---
As a beginner I think you should casually watch some twitch streams (beware of phishing streams; ie, don’t enter ur osrs password on anything other the official osrs website). You’ll learn all kinds of different small things from the way they play.
---
The redesign only exists to show you more ads
---
Did you get it?

i mean yeah both questions are dumb tbh, his response just didn't make sense to me at the time, I had also just woken up
---
Fuck I had a good one last week. I saw the white dragonfire, clicked to spellbook, lagged for a split second. I got blown up by an invisible crab just because the hiccup was the exact moment the crab would have spawned.

I can get behind this just a place to store things used to get your favor up, it would be good

Wondering if you tried a logout? I just did this quest on Saturday. It was in the crate immediately after climbing down the ladder.

imagine being on your death bed that young and thinking about how you spent a not insignificant amount of your life grinding agility
---
you play league and rs at the same time lol
---
It was in varrock too originally.
---
Also, in terms of mechanics and general design of the game (game tick design) I don't think there is really anything they can do to change this. 
---
Maybe unless they charge you 1 prayer point to turn a prayer on...
---
Got it
---
Gone
---
I agree with a lot of this. Warding appears to be designed with the right intentions, but is far too ambitious in its scope. 
---
On the terminology of warding, I don't think it's too off base. Although there's no dictionary definition of warding, it's a actually common term in the fantasy genre. In D&amp;D, a ward is a defensive spell that can be used for protection via invisible magic barrier. In the context of armor, I guess it could make sense. Whether or not it fits in the game world of OSRS is another question. However, there's other games that use this term, so I think your critique of it being a bizarre term is a bit misplaced.
---
is that the mighty cow1337killr?

I'm not hating on it. I made a sarcastic observation. Play what you want, who gives a shit?
