Man I used to love this minigame. Got pretty good at it too. After I got my strategy figured out, I don't think I ever lost to anyone who didn't outlevel me, and I usually beat those who did.

---
---
&gt;It feels so empty right now with just 40 something songs out of over 400

---
At least read the op
---
Lmao u dumb
---
Eh, you've been able to safespot skeletal wyverns despite them having a ranged attack since they were released, allowing you to make a pretty great amount of money considering that it's completely AFK. It's not like what he's suggesting is unheard of. 
---
But I'd argue that wyverns should be changed to remove that, rather than used as a precedent going forward...
---
fuck yes please i would play the game again just for that
---
stealing creation and soul wars too
---
Ew you‚Äôre one cringy lil weirdo aren‚Äôt you. 
---
You probably definitely deserve this hacking.
---
While this might be an easy stereotype of gaming culture, I don‚Äôt even think it reflects 2007scape. This comment only feels worth disputing because it actually seems like there‚Äôs way less obesity in RS communities than you‚Äôd expect. Almost always a surprising amount of fit people. 
---
I think the gameplay caters to less indulgent and more goal driven personalities? Either that or my bubble is inconsistent with everyone else‚Äôs experience.
---
Isn't one of those guys a PhD in Sports Physiology?
---
Quote that otherwise you‚Äôre bullshitting 
---
This is fucking fake bullshit the only people who ever got hacked with full acc security are Jed victims and Jed hacked mostly real world traders lmao. Fuck off with that paranoid conspiracy theory horse shit
---
God I can't stand the +1 Cox spammers in my cc. There's a few who just cannot take a hint. They ask, no one wants to atm, so then they keep asking every 15 minutes. So God damn annoying. Look idiot no one wants to raid right now go do something else with your shit acct
---
I'm not usually one to care all that much about graphical changes, but this and the super weird divine potions are the two changes I'd really like to see.
---
Neither do you though
---
:,v
---
That‚Äôs not how bots are detected lmao
---
holy,  thats alot of investment for sub 1:20 kills...  our 99 range/mage bots using void are around 1:23 avg... people think void mage is underpowerd, the way the formula works actually makes stupid  it powerful when used with prayer and a high mage bonus.
---
If you did 8 hours of hard clues it day it would take around 6 years to get all of the hard clue 3a pieces on average.
---
As with all hoods in the game is a separate item equipped to the head slot.

This is amazing

I'm an amateur bodybuilder and I had this exact conversation with my gf. The reason I can fish for hours straight and do constant farm runs is the same reason I can not eat no matter how hungry I am and do 90 min of fasted cardio every morning on prep. You set goals and you deliver on them no matter what.
---
I know that people get fucked over by Jagex's bullshit system all the time, and their unwillingness to help their player base, I know that.
---
The thought behind this is to help make the normal spell book a little bit more relevant in pvp by giving it some nice offensive utility and a nice defensive edge against other players using ancients.
---
I would play
---
The wiki is a god send, use Google search and put Reddit at the end of the search and it will show up all the previous same type of qiestio, so the very same one your asking now, theres no secret answer besides efficiency which is why people track there exp per hour hour to know what to do at what level. Also early game questing is clutch, waterfall particularly.
---
44 crystals at that KC is insane
---
Spend points to roll at a higher drop rate imo but that's just what I prefer
---
He can literally pay 25k for an instance lol. If you have 87 slayer, you can spare 25k for a private instance.
---
Lol
---
theirs some insanely complex calculations that are done in osrs just look at some drop rate calculations
---
Oh 100%. Either this jackass uses the same password for literally everything and has never changed it *and* has his IP address publicly avaliable or he's RWTing and using this as some kind of cover story.
---
Or just do what a lot of people do and be about 110 cb lvl before even doing rfd.

What cape is this?

If they don‚Äôt find the game enjoyable then don‚Äôt play lol

could also have used re-charge scrolls on the normal ammy of glory.  each scroll is like 215gp for 4 charges...

I do enjoy runecrafting but agility is a drag. I do like woodcutting. Yews are pretty fun

At the top of Gu'Tanoth so people will stop complaining about the clue step there

Who doesn't get mad when you rag them like a scumbag?

"lol they don't seem to enjoy when you dedicate your time to preventing them from enjoying the game LuL"

add me: almighty502

Hardest part when I do it now is my fat fingers making the character run somewhere else when I am using the spec orb.
---
That's technically reverse commission staking which is bannable
---
That‚Äôs brutal. And omg wow all those jars lol
---
Yeah, wielding a tbow is not even close to the same as affording one. I could login and buy one right now, but RIP every plan I had for the account with that 1bil gone.
---
Congrats on the RS girlfriend
---
drop rates still aren't all that complex though. it's algebraic probabilities.
---
nah it's cuz he is pulling facts out of his ass, I left a long reply explaining why but apparently reddit doesn't know shit about pvm so i got downvoted anyways lol
---
It is technically against the rules. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs an actual client bot, your cat trained to hit the button, an automatic dildo alching for you, whatever
---
The message should say ‚ÄúPlease go outside.  We‚Äôre worried.‚Äù
---
I guess his slow slayer means he actually buys bonds for gp?
---
I once (Admittedly not proudly these days) botted an account to 99 craft on bowstrings and it didnt take THAT long if I recall correctly
---
200m+ worth of gear from 77 slayer?
---
You can make decent dosh with that slayer level
---
Dozens!
---
No
---
I bestow upon you this most sincere of F‚Äôs
---
Wtf is this lol
---
It's against the rules still. They can't enforce it well or at all but it's against the rules.
---
98 slayer myself. 1.1m away.

but league is coming out with all this cool stuff ;_;

Kinda like how that one dude is always waving at you at the end of each agility lap on the rooftop courses.

Sometimes when I get home I want to just watch Netflix and chill at the Woodcutting guild while in bed with my S/O (who also plays).

Who cares as long as people have fun.  Fun isn‚Äôt always efficient.  Runescape is not a job (for most). It‚Äôs a hobby.  Hobbies should be fun.

Did it with 25 agil back in 06, young me was scarred for life I hated the quest ever since.

I‚Äôd suck a dick for the claw, instead I‚Äôve been blessed with many tails

Thats crazy lol
---
I do this but with slayer
---
That‚Äôd be sick
---
Of course I do. I own a vape shop and actively participate in SFATA, VTA, and other organizations. The meme was about JUUL, so I posted about JUUL.
---
Bro, what?? Shaving (not with a razor, obviously, clippers) is the way to go. I cannot imagine the pain of waxing. I feel like that‚Äôd be  dangerous too lol
---
Altria has a pretty controlling stake in JUUL. In fact, look into the latest CEO.
---
The robe dissolving didn't matter so much for an item sink as it did for just being thematically consistent as a training method (being able to break down metal, leather and magic armour).
---
However, you were also going to be able to break down clue scroll uniques, god pages and boss drops which was going to be HUGE. How many worthless clue scroll uniques do we currently have ingame? Most god book pages are worth a couple thousand gp tops. We could have made clue scrolls great again. 
---
Boss drop dissolving might have made items like the Seercull and Hydra Tail actually worth something. From this perspective, it was actually a massive shame that Warding failed. Maybe it wasn't the most fitting skill, but the effect it would have had on the economy would have been largely positive for the long-term health of the game.

No you can‚Äôt lmao, Gargs that‚Äôs it. That man has an avernic defender and prims at 77 slayer. He buys gold

Runecrafting Guild Please?
---
Features:
---
Rune Vendor
---
Bank chest
---
Small agility course inside
---
&gt;&gt;One path goes to a cave system with a ladder to the pure essence mine
---
&gt;&gt;One path leads up to Stone Henge looking area with portal to Abyss surrounded with Zamarok mages
---
Note: Agility/Runecrafting exp rates would be less then the best courses/routes (wildy abyss), but still be a viable way to train RC and Agility side by side.
---
Why: Myself and many others love training Runecrafting and Agility, but we also love doing two things at once. Since Runecrafting is at the very core of Runescape as a game, it makes sense to have a Guild that would incorporate a fun way to mine essence, then run over and craft the runes, and make a small amount of Agility exp at the same time!
---
(Any combination of the above suggestion with additions or subtractions would be welcome as long as we have a guild to make Runecrafting fun!)
---
#MakeRunecraftingFunAgain #MRFA

Which would be the same thing as generating input, so would be pointless.

who wants to know

i dunno how either, maybe its a specific tile that was left normal instead of being a safezone

&gt;If my memory serves right, bonds have been around the same price for a *long* time, like 3-4m, right?? If yes why did they go up so much suddenly
---
6 months ago they were 4.2m, they're currently at 5.2.
---
I'm not saying they're not going up but it's slower than you're making out
---
I have herblore 6 levels lower than runcrafting... and I'm happy for the tears xp to go toward it.
---
It's not very useful. It should've been low priced this whole time, but it stayed stable at 1.5bil which tricked a lot of people (me included) that it was going to stay there.
---
Unless you need some sort of quest/skill lvl/diary to enter the cave, you can't stop someone from mass creating lvl 3s for the purpose of scouting.
---
Disclaimer: this is a game and you can play it however your heart desires
---
I found that the bone crossbow meta helped catapult my ironman account into mid game before I had any respectable melee stats. I was doing higher level (safespottable) slayer monsters somewhat efficiently. This then brought me to the rcb and broadbolt era which unlocked basically everything mid game. 
---
Many important quests had safespottable bosses too - when all was said and done I completely skipped the rune scimmy grind. I got most of my attack levels from quests, and eased into d scim which carried me quite far.
---
hahaha yup, thats where I am now
---
Right? Unless this is some CIA level hacker and has learned how to divert Gmail 2FA codes to a spoofed number, there's no way.

I don't know who sick nerd is, but grats on the 99!
---
Void's damage boost gives a flat +10% DPS, while accuracy bonuses have diminishing returns i.e. the more accuracy you already have, the smaller DPS boost you'll get from any extra bonuses. Solo Olm has low enough defence that the accuracy bonus from dhide gives less than +10% DPS.
---
I mean its possible at 77 slayer, basilisk knights w/ some insane rng or third age from a clue scroll. Not likely but it's still possible
---
What do people expect? For them to tell you they rwt? You‚Äôd report them and get them banned.
---
I thought avernic would be 40m by now but it isn't. All the talk of people farming raids 2 for other items checks out, but people really like their gear upgrades. 
---
Besides you can sell the jaw whenever. If it drops 2m then panic and sell it if you care about 15m that much
---
For every achievement there's another shit grind that's not fun at all.
---
Gratz! I still have 0 clue how farming works in this game
---
Guaranteed to hit does not mean it will always hit well, and it also doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt hit a zero in some situations.
---
The seercull is used pretty much exclusively in castle wars at this point but before super meta pvp, it was really popular for pures, because a guaranteed hit could be a good KO but also dumping the spec at the start of the fight could make a persons mage useless. But now bringing a restore is commonplace.
---
But the seerculls spec is 100%, and while it‚Äôs a guaranteed hit, nobody uses it for that or ever did. Same with the magic longbow, unless you have a massive team of people with these things it just means instead of hitting a bunch of zeroes, you might hit a bunch of 1‚Äôs. It‚Äôs not guaranteed to hit a 20, it just won‚Äôt zero.
---
Also both the mlb and seercull aren‚Äôt actually guaranteed to hit, along with defense effects like an ely or justiciar, just super high range defense can still make it hit a zero. Speculation is that it bumps ranged accuracy up over 300, so 300+ ranged defense would nullify it. Full torags and a rune kite would accomplish that. The dihns + any basic tank gear would make the seercull and presumably the magic longbow spec useless.
---
Disregard that condescending asshat
---
Nice how many times did a team show up?
---
Lower def solo.  Higher def group.  Void good vs low def, bad vs high def.  Accuracy bonus on void is minimal vs actual range bonus from dragonhide at higher def levels.  Look at the accuracy rolls for each.
---
I literally just did that because the smelting took sooooo long.
---
Seriously, stick to flower. I got pneumonia from a shitty cart and never had one since. Fuck that shit
---
Thanks for the detailed response! Yeah I'm slowly making money with Slayer now but in about 5 more levels it will start coming in faster for the gear you mentioned. I'll stick with slayer for sure then.
---
This actually made me lol
---
yes, my mistake. his account is clearly quested. and the 2 [easy clues](https://i.imgur.com/WT1Pkt0.png) he did he got 3rd age from
---
Hey hey hey..... I refuse to make an alt until I max.
---
If you think mentioning to people to not trust everyone that tells them to pm them for the promise of a giveaway is an asshole, you're delusional.
---
Me and a buddy built some level 33 acc's just to jump through revs and kill level 3 mules/scouts. It's pretty fun and requires 0 skill
---
So others have mentioned guilted altar but I would say that the wildy altar is also very viable. The rates are about 80% of guilted altar so still pretty viable but it‚Äôs half the cost. However since it‚Äôs half the cost you can up to better bones and end up getting better do for the same or less cost as the guides altar
---
it's a joke don't take it serious

"Dad, when can I go to school?"

What up 90s baby?!

I‚Äôm working on that now! 4 levels to go still reee
---
Is it that much faster than using Phials to un-note things?
---
There's no way someone hacked you with 2fa on both your email and the account. Calling bullshit, 100%.
---
Oshd like 2008/09 graphics?
---
i have basically the exact same account other than maxed, it‚Äôs a beast in BH your hp is pretty crazy low but you can have fun rushing until in the 80‚Äôs+ one big thing is getting mm2 done and i did DS2 on mine the myth cape is nice fashion. my only advice at your level skip maxed gmaulers in your bracket they are aids stick to 60 att- 75 att pures. 50 attack zerks the rare breed :)
---
You have to make sure the attack goes off before he pulls you then run back immediately.  If you run in, get pulled, then try to attack he has enough time to pull you back.
---
As soon as I saw he could hit in the 50's with melee I bought the dark bow and loaded up with rune arrows, I'm a little bitch
---
Jesus Christ he is so bad at video games
---
I was gonna say this, isnt there an autoclicker which randomizes delays?
---
Almost there! Keep on grinding!
---
Lmao fucking legend
---
lmao
---
I always used torags. The run energy sap always got em quick. I can imagine that I'd would also be effective today as well.

best of luck!

The real meta is buying gp from venezuelan/chinese/dutch people then buying bonds with it for membership
---
Straight hell is coming to him.

I would show him off more but he's shy

I'm not sure the other posters understand what you are asking. You can't sprit tree to one you haven't planted. Ofc they can use the one in your house like a normal tree for their account.

We all do friend.

Whaaaaaat

Cries in colorblind
---
Nice!
---
literally fucking botting
---
I use a program that clicks for me because of a physical issue I have, it still takes action on my part (have to move the mouse) to make it click so it's not botting. If Jagex could tell where the clicks came from I would probably be banned by now.
---
Haha wow, I'm at like 600 and have only gotten the pet, d throwing axes, and a couple heads
---
I've bought literally 2 boxes in 100+ clues and I only lost one because KBD gangbanged me. It's 100% worth it for peace of mind.
---
You can check on the forums. There are plenty of social clan chats you could join.
---
A lot of zones is also like this. Do quest and some skilling then never go back to it.
---
Not factoring in any sales, data mesured by 1 month prices not year packages
---
Just wait until someone develops a neural network that emulates a human.
---
I've been bringing black d'hide/snakeskin and a crystal bow, 1 dose stamina pot, some food, and a knife. People are gonna try to PK you anyway so you might as well have some magic defense.  It makes it more exciting than just accepting the death and it makes the wizard kills much faster.
---
Too much work. I used bagges trees in my poh for farming lmao expensive af but only thing i knew to do
---
Lmao false. There is literally no way someone is going to guess my old login. Way safer than having an email that is static
---
Just do normal tree runs lol
---
Idk what that is
---
 Don't forget your 1k yew long bows to alch you bought from seers bank.
---
Name 1
---
All jagex can detect is your datapackets, not your clicks. Every tick the client tells the server which commands you made, it doesnt send the server your clicks for the server to determine what commands you made. For this reason you can autoclick something like fletching darts pretty safely if you dont do it for hours on end and the click speed is humanly plausible, for example turn on mousekeys and make a macro that presses the key sequence 20% faster than you can do it and leave it running for &lt;20 mins. It works because the client sends "they fletched darts 5 times in this tick" and not "click(x,y) wait(5ms) x5" to the server; menu entry swaps are undetectable for the same reason, notice how when you lag out you can still right click on things and see their menu options. The way people get caught is by leaving their autoclickers running for too long, or while they arent playing. If you fletch exactly 5 darts a tick for 3 hours something is likely up, but if its just a short time then its not as certain. Similarly, if you have been playing all day and then at 1am your character starts sending alch commands to the server every single tick for the next 6 hours, something is likely up.
---
Any suggestions for how to get to 5 million through f2p to buy a bond? Currently only viable method for me is to telegrab wine of zamorak when there are low number of players playing and hope that there are no bots. Other methods are highly situational and not as consistent. I currently have 1.6 million of bank (1 million in cash). Also what levels should I train my skills to before I go for members as i cant play much and I want to have enough gold per hour once i reach members to sustain my bond.

I've got the better Zenphone 2, not the 'Razor' or 'Lazor' or whatever; 4gigs of RAM. Well, guess it's probably compatibility. Desktop life for me

Scythe definitely beats twisted bow at cerb.
---
Same ive only ever watched any of his videos to learn boss mechanics and it seems every time hes like, " this boss is pretty easy" as he starts it with max combat and 100+ mil gp gear. I end up going to other guides for cheaper gear set ups and strats.
---
Took me a solid 3 years of consistent training lol. Talking about bench.
---
I have fun doing both
---
It's because he hates them and always has. That's why he's the "Grump."
---
And now this noob will fatefully find a set of magical green robes and his soul will forever haunt the wilderness seeking revenge: killing clue hunters and telling them to "sit." Repeating his trauma to future generations and continuing the cycle of the of salad warrior. The legend of the salad man is born. The end.
---
If you have high magic the final boss might be easier than Galvek, but I found it much more difficult.  I recommend trident of the swamp, eternals, imbued heart, mage arena 2 cape, and bring plenty of brews.
---
Convert able chrome book?
---
What's the point of killing people in the wildy if they give you nothing and it makes them all stop coming to the wildy?  If your only goal is to beat up on people who don't fight back for practically no value to you, you might not be the kind of person that anyone should make a game for.
---
Matt started the petition are you daft?
---
When did he say he jogged? I‚Äôm just basing this off his AMA he did years ago
---
I would buy members once with real money, f2p grind isnt worth it. As for money makers, try selling jewelry to that shop in port sarim, selling items at bandit camp in wildly, merching once you get a couple mil, and try reselling team capes, probably better than wines of zammy.
---
But again don‚Äôt waste your time in f2p it sucks especially with bonds at 5m+
---
If you can‚Äôt play much, focus on dailies like battle staves and miscellania
---
Is this game still going strong? How long do you think it will keep its playerbase?
---
Its dig is considered magical because it teleports him

Is that the ender 3 or 5?

Go skill or PvM bro I love trolling you noobs

Dude congrats. I can‚Äôt farm. Everything dies. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
In game and irl.
---
Hehehehe
---
You can notice it really early on if you make an ironman even. When I started mine and was getting some early quests done I fucking hated Imps. Because so many you'd kill and get nothing because some guy attacked it a while ago and it teleported away and then regenerated.
---
It's certainly not a common occurance but yeah it can definitely happen with anything in the open world.
---
That's funny cause I just saw my little sister doing the exact same thing and I told her it was a really good idea. Except she was playing Skyrim while watching youtube
---
Can something be done about the useless filler text?  
---
I'm on Filtered but there's still so much spam from places like Zalcano.

---
Ironman mode doesnt have to be about maxing, its about the early - mid game content IMO, getting items, doing quests, getting drops, everything is up to you and only you to achieve, its more rewarding and only slightly more time consuming if you're efficient and smart.
---
You dont even have to be efficient and smart, on my UIM, i literally only do slayer and clues 1 hr a day or so and i have so many sweet items and gear from that.
---
Main reason I see people do it is for anything PvP. There's basically 0 reasons to as an actual Ironman because you can't loot anything.
---
It's not self sustaining is the issue.  If you want to beat up on people who don't fight back, you don't exactly get to wonder why people stop wanting to be in a place where you're allowed to beat them up without them fighting back.  *Technically*, you're allowed to do it, but you're not exactly the kind of person that the game should be developed and balanced around.  You're the kind of person that should be told to fuck off because you want to have fun at other people's expense.
---
I work 4 jobs and have 9 kids. My wife's boyfriend let's me play exactly 12 minutes and 48 seconds per day so I shouldn't have to put in all this time and effort.
---
Hell yeah brotherrr
---
Item overlays are from 3rd party clients. Jagex doesn't give a shit about updating their client and from what I understand 3rd party devs can't make a mobile version.
---
So basically, no, never.
---
The problem isn't only that you're clicking at a set interval. What stands out is the fact that you're clicking the same spot for 6+ hours without ever taking a break.
---
Tbow is BiS in most rooms for CM, and in higher scales it's better in mystics as well as being best for hitting the magers in the rope room. It's amazing in CoX.
---
I think above 50 agility it won‚Äôt be complete ass. I did it at 53 and I fell maybe 2-3 times.

Should be using ruby dragon bolts when vorkath is above ~35% hp. You'll max hit 100s

Sometimes when you're on YouTube too long you start watching some really weird videos.

‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs in great shape.‚Äù

It's because everything takes so much time you got to pick and choose how to spend and hour or two: fight caves for fire cape/Slayer task? Or fight pits? I think we all know everyone wants to make progress of some kind

This subs rules bro, go read them.

What dbz track is this
---
Hey you stop with your logic! Cant you see we like to assume the worst in peoplr here.
---
They try too hard to make everyone happy that they make no one really happy.
---
Just grow some balls brother.
---
Yeah I did a little bit more research. We had these things at school, I loved them but I wasn't a fan of learning to code.
---
I played with the (and I know I'm going to ruin how I explain this...) toys that you could clip one end to a battery (usually only AA, or DD) and make like little electrical toys, with motors etc.
---
I remeber making an f1 model car (the plastic ones you get at toy shops) with my dad, and we ended up throwing a few motors in it and it was just a lot of fun.
---
For some reason this made me feel really nostalgic
---
So can you explain to me whats going on here? http://imgur.com/gallery/XFXhGTU

I remember 14 years ago that reaching level 30 was one of my biggest achievements in gaming at the time. I felt so accomplished but I ended up not succeeding past 45 because that was like 9000x worse than levelling 1-30. It truly was a grindfest. At least in runescape 2 i would run around killing random mobs and doing quests over several month periods at a time and still feel like the game was offering me a something new to experience every time.
---
You forgot the last bit:
---
You wake up back in the Jungle. There are scorch marks in front of you.
---
For your questions.
---
1) I would assume a cc and discord, no one uses forums...
---
2) why would it matter... that‚Äôs just weird asking for ages.
---
I'm sorry man, the logging out fast part isnt anything abnormal though. It's looks the same as getting 6h logged
---
Please go play a hc, for over a years worth of progress on the account tell me how you feel when you die and you don't know how you died.
---
It‚Äôs called sarcasm, a common form of humor
---
Sucks, sorry that you now have a level 1 thieving locked hcim :/
---
I struggled so hard to ever watch game grumps for that reason.
---
Just watching Arin absolutely blast through the tutorial and then spend a 30 minute video not knowing how to play a simple fucking platformer or something was just infuriating.
---
Or 5 because apparently I cant read for shit
---
Can't he jus reclaim it for like 60k outside the boss room?
---
I did hunter to 79 with mixture of birdhouses and most efficient training method. I enjoyed it. Just doing red chins is a hassle. So many bots.
---
Was this meant to be a PM?
---
Probably because Jagex see "botting" methods that gain GP as more important to deal with than just gaining exp
---
I mean, there was nothing he could do right? He had no control over that death... Messed up! Makes me want to never make a hardcore üòÖ
---
It‚Äôs not against the rules but do so at your own risk.
---
I did this and it has been a tough but fun rebuild, just keep at it and you‚Äôll be ripping shit again in no time
---
Wouldnt a 10 kill streak give u 2 t5s which are 1.2m ea?
---
You have ventured somewhere else, there is an official OSRS classics album made by Ian Taylor with 43 of the most popular OSRS songs composed by him. I'm not sure what live orchestra you have found, perhaps rs3 music?
---
What do you think about POH portals having a 1/??? chance to break and require reconstruction?
---
Congrats dude! Started here last week with farming, was such a mountain to look upto, but now it's quite okay!  
---
I think a lot of it is due to the Guides all containing s√≥ much information which put me of, while it's really not all too much to handle.
---
Quick Question, I'm now at 69 farming, doing snapdragons for money and  snape grass for xp, along with Fruit trees. Do you recommend changing up anything?
---
This just unlocked memories I didn't think I had anymore
---
hitting close to home are we
---
Asia too please
---
Well said
---
False. I botted 99 agility using ahk and the only randomness was time between clicks and click area.
---
And it was a standard random number generator too
---
Can we see a 'casual' GIM mode where we can have &gt;5 players in a group? I love the concept but only up to 5 players means my group will have to split into smaller groups.
---
Hiscores could be limited in any way, i.e. only normal, only ironman+normal, etc. The point is to be casual and for fun, not for competition.
---
I don't know what's less likely to have actually happened:  
---
\- Toddler opening up OSRS  
---
or  
---
\- Actually playing with music on
---

I literally cant imagine how much money does people spend on a skill that can give you decent amount of money with low effort
---
500k to insure, but it's a 1mil deductible to claim the pet back if it dies. 
---
Highly worth it OP.
---
Prayer is the same 1-92 and 92-99
---
I watched this live and was pissed that little fucker gnome got him killed
---
This was the best thing that happened to runescape way back, i remember i had so much blast playing this, it saddens me that u/jagexgambit u/jagexash u/jagexsween u/jagexlottie u/jagexeverybody has missed this awesome opportunity to add this to the game and bring us players enjoyment and pleasure having extremely fun in this game
---
why osrs team? why do you keep focus on wrong updates and not great ones like this one? it saddens me the games direction atm
---
2006 me trying to figure out how combat lvl worked
---
Can we have a damage nerf for vanguards when they hit players thru the right prayer? Currently vanguards is the worst combat room in chambers of xerics both supply and time-wise, nor do they give enough points for a boss that has reset mechanics. Making vanguards hit consistent 20s through the right prayer doesn‚Äôt help supplies either. Alternatively can we have at least a guaranteed ovl drop for the whole room instead of a chance of having one?
---
Its atleast worth a look right?
---
Na they've come out and said they dont ban for account sharing at all and it's fine to do it as long as you dont boost minigames or have a friend do inferno for you.
---
Any skill with training method relying on extensive rightclicking is cancer that justifies the use of ToG, change my mind
---
I played an HC, died to dark wizards near draynor when I was afk fishing while taking a dump. I was two hours in, broke my heart.
---
That title was a stretch...but it worked

Yeah lmao 2000 hours over the course of 7 years is a lot of time to play video games, I‚Äôm certain nobody with a ‚Äúreal life‚Äù or a job could possibly invest that many hours into a video game.
---
Its a great gp sink
---
Ah yes, the classic "i don't have a mic, so you get to watch me hunt and peck my way through an entire essay..." video. I'm glad mics are much more common now.
---
Just l0l it would have been the same without that retard making his video. Soup is a fucking little rat. Dick ride him if you want.
---
Not tell us the accounts full history after someone said hi
---
I agree with the normal ironmen that it‚Äôs so much more rewarding, but just wait untill you try Ultimate Ironman :D
---
From 1-2 years of experience as an Ultimate I can say that it changed my life. I work at a repetetive and boring factory job, but the past two years has been so much more fun because I constantly think of my account of what to do next, im constantly planning different routes and try them out when I get home from work. 
---
I started this ultimate as a joke to play mobile only, because of the hype back in winter 2017.
---
I had too much fun to stop playing it, I even stopped playing on my hardcore Ironman because I didnt feel like I could focus on two accounts at once. I scrapped the ‚Äùmobile only‚Äù id√©a and started thinking of epic long term goals such as getting all the wilderness pets or getting the evil chicken outfit (wich I still plan on doing in the far future), but for now I focus on getting every storeable outfit I can get.

It warns you before the 6 hour log out timer.
---
Making bars other than gold is more profitable than dart tips (much more click intensive though). I‚Äôm making like 500k plus an hour in gp with mithril bars rn. And the xp rates are still really good. Addy and rune bars increase this profit per hour
---
You can if you want, but you don't have to. There isn't some sort of monthly exp quota you need to meet. I'd say it's more worth it to do something fun with the only hour you can play than do the same repetitive task over and over to eventually hit a 99 that doesn't really matter.
---
Yes!!! OpenOSRS (formally Runelite+) is working on a mobile client. Keep an eye on their discord :)

Wrong

Just do foot knights lol

I‚Äôm going to join in and say I also want a sticker of this.

Almost certainly a reference to this scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQnOYZ_Glt8

No.

Yeah but that guy literally came up with the idea of rooftop agility

Doing the same, at the end of S4 about to start 5.

Now sell it and stake it for double the gp

it maxes like 255 iirc?

do prayers in the same category stack? so can i use together  Clarity of Thought +5% and  Improved Reflexes +10% 
---
for a +15% attack bonus for example?
---
After the success of the farming guild, is the rework of other guilds in the pipeline for future work? It could be a great piece of content that if revived properly, and to community satisfaction, would have a very rewarding impact. Similar to have the farming guild has three tiers that pushes players to continue to level up their skill for all access to the guild.
---
I have been championing for a SlayerMusiq and a Lynx Titan reference for a while now. There's two Boaty references, so why not these two, too
---
Isnt it 9
---
&gt; Probably looking for certain colors.
---
Only way to prevent this is to make the game black and white
---
Is this from whines? I still don‚Äôt get it. Do they ferment in the bank or do you have to take them out? Can they be in notes?
---
&gt; Guess we can't have our little brothers doing it for us either then, that's against the rules.
---
No you can't? Just because people do it, doesn't mean it's not against the rules
---
imps
---
Prayer training is such a massive luxury imo.
---
You could do herb runs too, they're decent profit.
---
You can't boost the same stat with 2 different prayers. So e.g. piety (boosts atk, str, def) can't be activated at the same time as any of the 15% prayers.
---
Also you can't activate offensive prayers of 2 different attack styles at once, e.g. mystic might and eagle eye.
---
if you look at the pic again thats actually what i was in the middle of when i took the stats pic lmao
---
Yes, doing wines. They ferment into wine in the bank after the last one you make is 14 seconds old. So I had to bank them, retrieve 14 each of grapes and jugs of water and start the process over every 14 seconds before the fermenting finishes. No need to note them as they ferment in the bank.
---
Also nobody chopped magics that were just south of the yews, you HAD to go to the sorcerer's castle with the garden hedge. Even though it was an entire screen further away from the bank, it was just cooler there.
---
Yea same thing happens to me whenever I get MVP I really ever see rune drops
---
Sardonic brews
---
they ferment in the bank, but only after 12 seconds (20 ticks), and every time you make a new wine the timer resets.
---
so as long as you bank and start making a new wine in less than 12 seconds of finishing the inventory, you can stop them fermenting indefinitely
---
Id rather not have to learn to flick defensive + protect. Itd only be useful to be aids in wildy if flicking like that wouldnt be possible
---
Haha great. I just read moratainia hard diary and jumped to you doing some quests lol.
---
&gt; Why is that the go-to with you people? 
---
its quick and an easy way to set people off.
---
whith
---
I tried playing Maplestory for a bit a while back. I tried out one of the new classes and literally hit level 30 on the same day, and way before I even finished up the introduction quest. Shit's gonna easy.
---
I feel like getting shredded is faster then getting fat,
---
If you worked out.
---
Noobs Playin
---
Mostly GWD/Cox/Corp and a place to hang. Its also fun when we go PKing as most are PvMers, come and join :)
---
&gt; to see if they lived
---
How can you improve the likelihood of this? Compost? Paying them to watch your shit?
---
Whatever you say nerd
---
They gain attention because other people enjoy seeing them. People are here on the OSRS sub because they enjoy OSRS and things related to it, or as you so eloquently put it "from a game!!!". Why wouldn't they enjoy drawings relates to OSRS which clearly display an artistic talent? Fair enough if you think they're mediocre let's see your drawings then?
---
Lemme guess, that was just for noted dagganoth bones?
---
I want to grind slayer but I want to do it through as many boss tasks as possible (to start a pet collection) and I keep delaying my slayer grind for diary requirements lmao
---
Im only 81 slayer but I want to get 83 RC for dag bones and 91 thieving for KQ shortcut before continuing
---
Dutch?
---
duuude fuck you lol. already up to 500, no luck
---
I presume not hitting zuk so healers don't spawn
---
Again yes you are already telling me things I already know and my original post said IMAGINE EVERYONE doing zulrah content because it‚Äôs the best thing to do, the price would drop because every single Person in geilinor would be getting zulrah drops so no one would have the need to buy scales or anything. Imagine reddit users reading posts before going off
---
Don't show this on the Pok√©mon Subreddit. They'll have a fit that Charizard has received even *more* love.
---
Also: The artpiece looks great!
---
thats disgusting gz mate
---
Nice.
---
Mobile has the ability to tap a button once that then makes all other taps a ‚Äúshift click to drop‚Äù
---
You‚Äôre doing effectively the same thing by toggling shift to drop once, dropping stuff with individual clicks, and then toggling it off again. 
---
That‚Äôs the same intensity as how it‚Äôs done with the official mobile client. You‚Äôre all good.
---
Is this still possible? I read somewhere that they patched it, but I haven't tried myself in OSRS.
---
&gt;If you eat the same tick the mob‚Äôs hit is calculated
---
The tick the hit splat appears
---
47 d picks is an odd number to go for
---
You can make it cost more than herblore if you try.
---
Would there be a possibility of F2P wilderness improvements? For instance, F2P revenant caves with access to hellhounds and popular mobs, the ability to offer big bones on altar, and making demi-bosses F2P as endgame challenge too.
---
From my experience doing just that, to splash vulnerability for hours at a time, it never got me banned.
---
I recorded a 5 minute segment of me doing it by hand and then looped that. 
---
What did get me banned was doing the same thing but cammy telealching instead.
---
people would flick it everywhere
---
What is the reasoning for  not already having fist of guthix? the rewards are not necessarily needed and they could be made into reality with communitys help.
---
no
---
Can't wait for the mod response. This is fucking ridiculous, this shouldn't happen from a company that's been in the online multiplayer scene for as long as Jagex has.
---
With the quickness
---
Prob more than 1000 times
---
Barrows is a good shout. Could probably do some GWD solo or in groups depending on the boss. Would recommend getting some slayer in too. Passive combat stat exp and you make money on the higher level monsters. Defo worth the time investment
---
No minigame came even close to castle wars in popularity.
---
Well Bloodborne was already one of his favorite games that he played a ton before doing it on Game Grumps. He wasn't learning it on camera. 
---
You can see the same thing in the Mario Odyssey playthrough, even though they did it like the same week it came out, Arin had already played almost the whole way through at home just because he loved it so much.
---
That's fucking brutal
---
Should have used DeliverItems
---
What are you on about, tbow rebuild is one of, if not the most, fun rebuilds in the entire game. Even when talking about efficiency, the tbow is the extremely good  at many high-profit locations. Any boss where the BP is equal to the tbow, the tbow immediately wins on profit/hr because of operating costs. People love to assume that dragon/rune dart blowpipe is just as cheap as a tbow to use, when in reality the difference can be as much as 1m/hr in costs.
---
But yeah, a general rule of thumb is don't try to tbow something with less than ~200mage or mage attack. Around that point it isn't worth it for many enemies with defence.
---
I mean I slated my mage up from 75 to 99 in like a week so yeah you probably aren't trying
---
Same Lul
---
Yeah and we play 2007scape so it came out before runescape even existed *mindblown*
---
"Our team have reviewed the evidence"
---
Apparently not since the jmod /actually/ watching the stream immediately reversed it as a mistake. Your account can really just be fucked by Jagex for no legitimate reason and you have nothing to do if you're not a content creator or make a deal of it online. What a joke of a company.
---
Ok and efficient Slayer is basically bursting as many tasks as you can with gloves to prevent kills. even if you waited till Max combat to start you would still be missing Slayer helm superiors and bursting which would make it slower I don't see your point
---
She is on to something
---
Why was detached camera taken away from RL client? Thanks.
---
Don't forget to consider operating costs when considering how good something is. If profit is your primary goal, it doesn't matter if you can get an extra 500k/hr revenue when it comes at the cost of spending an extra 1m.
---
So is ba (obv not as much but still brain dead easy) and it‚Äôs pet is very very rare. It should be around the same avg time imo assuming max efficiency.
---
He was using the official client. Smh
---
Jagex are able to accurately detect all illegal 3rd party software and any promises from their makers about being 'totally undetectable' or 'no ban guaranteed' are inaccurate. As such your account has been permanently removed from game. This is not an appealable offence and we will not review it should you contact us by email, ticket or social media. Please take this time to familiarise yourself with the rules should you wish to create another account.
---
Imagine if he wasn't a streamer, he would've lost his account for ages until he won the reddit lottery to get customer support. We're all at risk of this happening.
---
Nah dude, it was more fun to get banned using kami/full map attack and mob tele. Oh Blight, how easy you made it to cheat.
---
Took me a year of playing without F keys like a nub but once u start using them the game is hella lot easier üòÇ
---
I bet your mother is proud of her special boy.
---
mechanically no, but no one played the real mechanics of fog.  if u just random middle and tank tested and ur opponent did the same, a LMS fight is the same thing but both hunter&amp;hunted.
---
Like the urinal situation , plenty of free ones but u decide to standto the one next to me üòÖ
---
AFAIK it depends on your farming lvl
---
Also if you aren‚Äôt that high, Maple logs are like 7 or 8gp and the unstrung bows sell for 45-50 I believe. Not massive profit, but a bit for good xp rates till yews.
---
Doubt any normal player will get this treatment. Makes me not want to play. I'm so paranoid about my account and I'm clean as a whistle.
---
Congrats!!
---
Okay but what if it wasn‚Äôt a streamer? Why can‚Äôt you guys get it through your head that we need a proper channel for this? 
---
It‚Äôs been shown time and time again that it‚Äôs impossible to appeal bans. 
---
Your company is a joke and it‚Äôs actually incredible you‚Äôve lasted thing long riding on nostalgia‚Äôs coattails.
---
oof
---
I'm not sure why you think rebuilding with a tbow is fun, I found it far more rewarding and fun to grind CoX for a tbow.
---
Thank you for replying to this matter quickly, but personally I think this is an issue which almost supersedes any a lot of other problems and hence requires the team's attention.
---
Getting falsely banned "With no ability to appeal", on an account on which a player has spent 1000s of hours is incredibly demotivating, and can easily impact a player's mental health. A lot of players love this game and spend all their free time on it, and I would not be surprised if banned unjustly, a form of depression would hit them. I can't say I'm speaking from personal experience here, but I have a close friend who had this happen to them.
---
I am glad that you on behalf of Jagex can at least acknowledge the problem, which is infinitely better 'ignoring the matter'. However, I feel like some work requires to be done on implementing a system which can eliminate the false-positives, or at least rectify them quickly. How I do not know, and I know it is a complex problem without an easy solution. All I ask is that this problem is taken incredibly seriously.
---
That is on them to develop better anti-botting systems, to prevent bots from getting started in the first place.
---
Sorry, but we shouldn't have good updates and good customer service because Jagex can't deal with bots.
---
I dont get this joke or hell maybe it's not an joke and people believe that. Most of the player boss is working adults. They probably spent their own money.
---
If you go to the castle wars worlds there's lots of people playing there. Like everything else it's super min maxed though so like 75% of people are ice barragers and the rest are armadyl tanks...
---
who knows if he did cheat?
---
Similar thing with me a while back I was using Remote Desktop to thieve Ardy knights before mobile was out and copped a 2 day ban, tried appealing but they had solid evidence of AHK apparently haha
---
It is called a bait
---
I'm not saying that he did or didn't, I'm just saying that this isn't corruption.
---
I used Splashworlds but yeah.  The 95+ cc‚Äôs are more private though so they don‚Äôt get swamped with &lt;95‚Äôs who would ruin the whole ‚Äúcan‚Äôt fail‚Äù aspect.
---
yes b u t $11
---
Jagex..? If he did cheat he wouldn‚Äôt have been unbanned at all
---
Nothing infuriates me more on this game than the no lifes that scout worlds for people trying to solo and crash, either by themselves or 5-6 of them in max gear, etc. I wish they would do something about it, it‚Äôs demoralizing
---
I use snugglequest :(
---
Cant tell if flexing or actually thinks he is dry
---
REDDIT SHOULD NOT BE UR FUCKING CUSTOMER SERVICE!! GIVE US LIVE CHAT NOW U FUCKS
---
Lol what???? Maybe in 07 bud because it was the only one, after that it was completely dead.
---
o7
---
If any of you people want to learn raids, or join an active pvming clan. Join 'Rad Pvm' clan chat and ask how to join :)
---
Ill give you the benefit of the doubt, upvoted for Jmod attention. Goodluck Fam
---
That sucks but at least it was only 2 days. If I get my account back I'm sure as shit never using remote desktop again. Can't see anything else that would've flagged other than someone botting on the IP I was on (cloud server with presumably shared IP)
---
Could this guy have been hit with the same false positive?? Hes not a streamer... https://reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dlg0i4/account_wrongfully_suspended/
---
Favorite by far. When I recently got back my oldest account I had 60 fist of guthix points in the bank and the nostalgia wave hit me, and it hit me hard.
---
Sorry, new artist here
---
Go to Venezuela and start a sweatshop of gold farmers.
---
Jagex presumably - All I'm saying is that master_AK is wrong for implying that it's corruption that EV was unbanned because he has more clout than the average person to get the attention of Jagex. That isn't corruption.
---
pretty obvious you should do away with unappealable bans.
---
Herb runs and narrows are viable
---
Pre-eoc obviously. Are you lost? Castle wars clans went into multiple 100s in members. Nearly comparable to warring clans.
---
If you have an xbox controller you can use software(can't for the life of me remember what its called) to bind click to all the directions on the analog sticks. Its what I did to get 70 thieve from about 50.
---
Its probably not strictly legal but I saw it as I was still doing the inputs so I took the risk.
---
you want them to be 24/7 livestreaming your gameplay? because that's what it would take. the benefit of being a streamer who has a lot of current viewers is that sometimes you have jmod's watching you, for positive and negative reasons - they are livestreaming their moderation over a large portion of the playerbase.  
---
sween talks about it here: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dlfosg/evscape_just_got_macro_majored_on_stream_and/f4ptm9o/)
---
example: evscape was quietly pming people in an attempt to scam them, but he was doing it on stream.. would you rather jagex wait to see if the guy in the pm works it out and reports him? or just deal with it quickly?  
---
jagex is made up of humans, humans can make mistakes. focus on realistic opportunities to help them grow as a company - this fight ain't it.
---
Regarding false positives, a friend of mine got hit with one a couple of months back. He got banned for macroing aswell, despite the fact he plays exclusively on mobile and just trains fishing. He definitely does not bot, so he possible had his account stolen? He hasn't had the time to try get his account back recently. We think he most likely got his account hijacked and turned into a bit, but we aren't sure. Where should I direct him to try get this issue sorted?
---
And I know, before you guys jump on this as another sob story from a supposed bitter losing his account, I can confirm that this isn't the case this time. Just need some advice to try get his account back for him.
---
Honestly, disappear into the wiki for a while.  
---
You need a bunch of quests done to unlock more growing plots/teleport methods to make farming not aids
---
I know you guys are understaffed and underpaid, but it's still your job to review stuff. Each automatic ban should be checked for false positive. Someone on your team thought "automatic bans not being appeable is a good idea" and nobody else stopped them. This is proof that's not true.
---
I won't say we know what goes behind the scenes. This time a streamer got caught, and made you guys check why. I'm sure that happens when people are not streaming, and maybe community is overreacting. But we don't see enough proof of this happening to non-streamers. Periodical posts about "identifying false bans and unbanning X falsely accused players" would probably help building a better image of your customer support.
---
I'm 95 at the moment (with ardy hard FWIW), could you pm me a 95+ cc? 
---
I never thought about it like that
---
I‚Äôm confused how do they get these figures.
---
Because let me tell you if they base it on whether you pick a boy or girl on account creation sometimes people lie. 
---
U kno?
---
honestly i think if you made it from scratch it should be allowed
---
True.. perhaps they can add a wait period before appeal or something and make it shorter for accounts that fit a certain criteria: that pay $11, high level, etc, anything for for fucks sake. 
---
I actually hesitated playing this fucking game for several months because of shit like this. It's not worth it for a game that require so much fucking investment
---
I have 2 of those suckers on my spare phone and I've been standing it up on my laptop this whole time. Feels like a facepalm moment haha thank you for this
---
&gt; That led to the offence being reviewed in minutes (rather than as part of the normal sampling process)
---
Who in the right mind thinks that the mindset of 'fire aim ready' is better?
---
You should NEVER ban someone before it is reviewed. For cases like this. Yes, it is a false positive. The false positive should had been caught with manual review (you said this was NOT yet reviewed, that the normal sample process takes time AFTER the ban is done) before they are banned. 
---
Flag accounts for ban.
---
Then review them. 
---
If false positive, nothing happens to your customer.
---
Then if it is an actual correct flag, ban. 
---
Stop fucking up your customers. That's like the cops locking you into solitary confinement before they even _ask you your name_
---
Lmao now that is some r/redneckengineering

Ive done this too, we need more people doing this constantly.
---
And honestly blizzards customer support from my experience is probably the best out there for games
---
My merching alt and my main was banned back in 2014. The main was banned for Macroing Major and the alt for RWT due to trading wealth back and forth with the main.
---
Four years it took. FOUR YEARS. Before they finally actually reviewed the ban on my main and unbanned it. Now, they won't review the ban on my alt because it's on the list of unappealable offences, so I can't get my 400m bank back.
---
Most bans are not false bans. But when false bans do happen, they are ignored.
---
I'll buy one too
---
It's all a big meme by now really lol

I'd bet that it's just tap water that hasn't touched an actual human.

TBH I'm don't follow her on social media and just know about this stunt purely through memes, but from what I've seen of her she's pretty savvy with the stuff she does. If I was born a woman and bothered to keep myself fit I'd probably at the very least consider trying the whole "instagram thot" thing for a while. Seems like easy money if you're comfortable with the realization millions of thirsty creeps will be jerking off to you.

They should make training skills fun then. No one actually enjoys training most of the skills since they are boring af.

Augury needs 5% magic damage, and we need an ultimate end game turmoil-like melee prayer.  Melee cannot hang with a BP or T bow these days, and magic boosting dmg would help out the trident and fire wave a bit.  A rapier is decent but really can't hang.  Wouldn't even mention scythe because it's too niche
---
Huh weird. I used remote desktop for like a year straight with multiple accounts going at once in nmz / sand crabs. I've heard of others getting banned for it though
---
you're obviously fighting a different battle than the rest of us, we have a problem with being banned for false bans that are done by their bot detection. You're talking about how a jmod banned your ass for doing some dumbshit. There is a difference
---
Wanted that 250k xp drop haha
---
Yeah afk watching something or reading etc. I have long stints of the tic granite mining where u mine the 4 rocks in a row and use herb tar each time. I find trying to keep the constant pace and never stop kind of like a meditation. Its a good mix for super concentration and braindead shit. I like other high intensity flow state stuff like that too. I mix it up between super sweaty ehp nerd and lazy af casual every other day. 
---
Note i havnt tried the 3t fishing because i love my chill fishing in barb village so much.
---
No it's not, that would be if instead of banning they deleted the account without a backup. Stop thinking of bad analogies and just accept that reviewing every botting ban is absurdly unrealistic unless you want even shittier customer support (yep, it CAN get worse) or pay $13.

Tons of companies have reps who comments on reddit about shit like this all the time lol

Pretty sure you misread his sentence cause it legitimately makes sense
---
How did you make the 250m exactly?

If I had to guess like 200-300m. Should‚Äôve just used a chinese gold trading site

Love how your playing rs while in the gym hahaha don't you get embarrassed when that fit girl walks past and catches you killing goblins and elves or smelting cannonballs?? :'D
---
I'm not denying it's an awful decision but I work in finance and the investments I'm allowed to make are extremely limited. 
---
Anyway, this isn't /r/personalfinance so I'm not going to go into it here.
---
Comes off a little more casual to me, which is surprising considering how toxic the responses can be towards them
---
What happend?
---
not really true, fishing is a 5 tick action which means afking you have a chance to get a fish every 5 game ticks. if you are 3 ticking all it is doing is giving you a chance to catch a fish every 3 ticks instead of 5. The % of exp gain is the same regardless of the success rate. Sharks for example are \~15k/hr, 2t sharks are still \~45k even tho the success rate is very low to catch a shark the exp gain from tick manipulation is the same as regular tuna/swordfish which is \~45k vs 2t at \~135k
---
What happened this time?
---
Oh boy what happened this time
---
8 unsired at that kc? You have no right to complain
---
Best time to play while driving, just make sure it's afk then it's just like changing the radio station
---
how much tho
---
Tf you mean it takes too long to level?.. Plant allotments and herbs until you get to wood trees and just do wood tree runs daily to collect that exp drop. Then throw in fruit trees when you get them. Literally easy as fuck and doesn't take long. Normal and fruit tree runs together maybe 10 mins a day.
---
...yes it is? what do you think being arrested under suspicion of X crime is?
---
Please don't ignore the basilisk knight questions 2-3 weeks in a row.  They are ridiculously tanky and aren't worth the effort/supplies.  Compared to other slayer monsters that dropped former BiS items/item components they're ridiculous.  Compare them to kraken, abyssal demons, etc.
---
If you aren't going to at least update their drop table or nerf their defenses a bit then I suggest you do a stream of you doing 1 extended basilisk task using BiS gear on a maxed account so we can see how long it takes you.
---
I mean he ‚Äúgot a fat bonus‚Äù he‚Äôs obviously not incompetent and deemed this financial decision beneficial for his hobby. He literally mentioned how it‚Äôs better to spunk his money then grind it earning 2m/hr

Let the dude spend HIS money how HE deems beneficial
---
Gz on selling you and your friends gear. You'll spend that 1000$ like you never had it.
---
The claim that there is "no customer support" shouldn't be taken *that* literally, it's usually said to express that CS isn't offering the stuff they want, like live chat support ([which they are interested in offering, by the way.](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/player-support---upgrading-systems?oldschool=1)) There is a customer support team, coincidentally Sween started out in CS himself. [They're hiring a new lead too.](https://jobs.lever.co/jagex/ee4edf7b-f976-4305-ba45-35bf5ea1cb2e)
---
As far as I know there's no way to highlight NPCs using the official client...
---
Try the "NPC Indicator" menu in RL, then type the exact in-game name of the Healers in the "Highlight NPC" box.
---
(Let me know if that worked please, as I plan on doing this for my FC attempt!)
---
And good luck - hopefully it's third time lucky for you.
---
Haha 1 head in ~75 kc and that only because 50 is a lock
---
No those are 4t. Been doing a lot of inferno so I've kind of forgotten the fight caves mobs, but they should all be 4t, except for Jad which is 9t (at least Jad is 9t in inferno)
---
The bats miggt be 3t like they're in inferno thoufh, but I cant say ive had any use for knowing whether theyre 3t or 4t
---
It would pass because it makes the bulwark babies safer in the wildy, but it's a terrible idea because all it does is lower the skullcap of certain pvm (inferno) while furthering the tank capability of someone with a bulwark in PvP.
---
More like 3000 upvotes on reddit or 300 viewers on stream. I doubt jmods give a fuck if you stream, you have to have an audience. It's all about the backup.
---
Only a small amount of pkers use the ge or edge for 1v1 honour fights. Op is talking about deep wild.
---
The meme you dip
---
The difference isnt the ammount of time out in. It's that one is intentional and the other is unintentional. The kbd comes down to the iron should suck it up. The corp comes down to someone being a dousche.
---
Also I thought irons are able to make a private instance
---
(400/11)*4.2m so ~152m
---
I believe you can appeal it then they get back to you through email. Reading is also a crazy concept though.
---
Support!
---
I'd counter it perhaps with the slower DPS provides with the reduced offensive stats, making it not that great for inferno. Who knows though, flickers would probably make it OP.. but then they can do inferno anyway
---
If you spent $420 on 60 bonds and sold them for 5mil each it's *only* 300m
---
Do you remember a guy from like a year ago had a wilderness expansion north of mage bank.. went to like wildy lvl70? Shit was dope

I guess that‚Äôs a no :(

Lol Runecrafting &gt; literally the entirety of Maplestory
---
Life after max is so boring dude.. I lost interest for a few months. Then I made an ironman and now I‚Äôm hooked again
---
Not everyone is a streamer and people are worried they could lose their HC ironman due to a flaw in a system. This situation adds to their fears
---
In reference to https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dlfosg/evscape_just_got_macro_majored_on_stream_and/

Can we prioritize clue scroll bottles when dropped? It's impossible to find them again on mobile if you accidentally drop them
---
I'm not being defensive about something you didn't say, when I meant my word against yours I'm not actually talking about you it's a figure of speech. I'm actually talking about a banned player and Jagex.
---
Sorry if you thought I was talking about you.
---
it's not like he said he paid $400 to be a better pvper, what's the skilled content in RS, clicking at the right time on cue?
---
Gz
---
He gets to enjoy the game with his friends. What's wrong with that?
---
Because scythe is pretty crap outside of tob tbh. Therefore it's a vicious cycle. The less people who do tob, the more scythe drops, then even less people do it

I mean its true tho. It's alot of wasted dev time. just because it existed before doesnt mean its just a plug n play update. it needs to be completely recoded and implemented as it was the very first time. I personally would rather that time be spent on new refreshing content that wont be boring after the first week because the nostalgia is gone
---
We used to anti these fools before they became autistically efficient and low-risk. Rarely worth it any more now that two clueless kids trying to make a quick buck barraging and claw-rushing were replaced by literal armies of salad robe mongoloids risking fuck-all.

Keep digging your holes.
---

Exactly. When I was 14 I could play RS2 8 hours a day and 14 hours on a weekend and not really give a shit about time management. Nowadays I'm lucky to play 1/2 or even 1/3 that much. Time is just too important in a game where almost everything has a time cost.
---
&gt; he would've lost his account for ages
---
Probably forever
---
Right. What I‚Äôm trying to say here is that via a streamer the anti-cheat specialist was able to identify a situation that may cause false-positives. They then went and looked into similar situations of the one recorded and investigated those as well.
---
That‚Äôs a net benefit for everyone involved is it not? Streamers and non-streamers alike.
---
Why would that add to their fears when it‚Äôs actively improving the system that may cause an unjustified ban to occur?
---
Sacred clay was the shit and souls wars was pretty neat
---
Also, why didn't his account instantly log out when banned, imagine if you died and lost your items due to a manual permanent ban that was later found to be an error.
---
"And there is zero chance of this being introduced with the current polling system  And there is zero chance of this being introduced with the current polling system." A BiS strength helmet was added less than a month ago and OSRS has added many new items that have changed the META of pking, especially taken it out of its primordial stages in only 6 years. Like I said, I don't PK, but I would love PvP armors to be added, just not in the manner or conditions you're suggesting.
---
The anticheat does not scan for running processes you imbecile stop spreading misinformation. The runescape client (or the runelite client) does not have those permissions.

My son just turned one.. only a few more years...

pssh, didn't even fail to shotgun a beer

Damn your account was worth $50 million? Could have bought a yacht.
---
Almost there! Questing just becomes so much faster. Without a mount in zones like Tanaris or Un'Goro, you're gonna have a bad time. So it's definitely a worthwhile investment!
---
If you want money I would suggest doing Yanillian hops too. Super cheap seeds and each hop is 980-1020 gp each. Make sure you do hardwood trees too (teaks or mahoganies)
---
Changing your ingame name does not change your account name.
---
I purposely enjoy doing what I enjoy more which is progressing my account and achieving the goals I want to achieve. I dont find minigame like BA, c wars etc fun nor rewarding anymore. It's not about enjoying the game less, but what I enjoy now as an adult is different from when I was 11.
---
Lol, this isn't the prison system we're talking about. Yes false bans suck, yes having to wait weeks to get your account back is bullshit but quit being so dramatic.
---
Its like George from Seinfeld
---
It's hard to make fun of people for having disposable income.

I agree except for dagganoths. At peak times its hard enough to find a world without someone else already cannoning, and why the fuck are you people doing dags with no cannon

Well earned.

Who is the preferred slayer master now? Steve/Nieve/Duradel or is Konar worth using?
---
Gratz! I'm at 94 myself. Can't wait to spirit tree the shit out of Gielinor.

No, they are regular accounts with a runeite plugin that shows the ironman icon. Its expected this summer though

Hunter gets all kc cuz I try to avoid ks'ing by lowering my dps or turning to minions after some damage, spec transfers.. hopping between 2 worlds to skip spawns.. etc

Thats what I did to get 3 zammy pets on my accs, might as well sell pets lmao

This

you seem to be very attached to the GE for some reason...

No,it's not worth playing this game at this stage unless your a streamer, You might be falsely banned and have your account perm gone

No pet :(

I lost all my RNG when I got the agility pet at 71 agility at seers course üò≠
---
Hybrid fight on mobile? Damn, respect lol.

He's troloing and got pet on tank on that kc. Just not on the acc he wanted lul
---
Any automated system is going to have error. Unless you think they should only do it manually, which in that case have fun with a bot infested game 1000x worse than it is now.
---
Yeah probably, but there's of course a difference between having the possibility to do so &amp; actually doing it. Besides that is the Razer Chroma considered the best MMO mouse, mainly for this reason. I can also follow the potential thought process of people that when it's a hardware button, it's different than a software macro (while it's not). 
---
It's just a guessing game as long as OP doesn't respond though.
---
Crazy rng vn
---
Dick per second
---
Getting a 99 might matter to you, but it could be a very rewarding feeling to someone else. Much greater than playing a "for fun" no reward mini game. If that's what you like to do, then right on, you should do it. If you enjoy grinding out a boss/exp and seeing progression, you should do that. I personally think all the mini game blow and if there isnt a reward from it I dont want to do it period. Fun is subjective
---
I doubt soulsplit would ever pass a poll turmoil possibly but soulsplit would turn PvM into a joke with people prayer flicking nowadays.
---
Wow so funny. Iiterally was going to swap with them but I asked for proof of their vouches, only to be kicked shortly after. Hope this post gets up voted.
---
Thanks! I boosted to 99 and planted all them bad boys everywhere, pretty fat exp drops too
---
Wrong your

Didn‚Äôt know about the Cerberus did know about the basilisk knights yes

Too high-effort for this sub. :P
---
lol
---
You can sir, I did it 2 weeks ago

The optimal way to do slayer would instantly become go farm wildy slayer for a few thousand points -&gt; barrage nechs 30 tasks in a row. 
---
And it would also make hydra and cerb limitlessly farmable among others. No thanks

Seriously let me buy a sticker drop the link

Can you explain in more detail and what you will do to fix/remedy the scenario where you inaccurately perm banned EvScape?

Tbow isn't worth your bank unless your grinding non stop the handful of bosses that it's useful on. 
---
Side note, no one ever mentions prime. Doing dks with tbow... Easy money with very little supplies. 
---
Also if your going for jad pet. I was able to four shot jad lol.
---
Wait so you mean those automatic messages are totally full of shit and they basically just allow their automated systems to yeet accounts into the garbage can without any manual review? Shocker, that.
---
&gt; You not only somehow decide to assume that 17000 accounts are banned per day
---
Its not an assumption, they publish their stats on the support site.
---
&gt;you also assume that all of those accounts will take an equally long amount of time to sort through
---
Also not an assumption I made, I'm just pointing out the sheer volume of workload you're proposing.
---
&gt;I do believe that if you cannot afford to hire more people that you should absolutely look into getting the community's help.
---
You're incredibly ignorant on this issue. I don't know of any game company that does this because exposing logs of players like this could create privacy concerns, in addition to the obvious security concerns and bots improving once people figure out what metrics are used in determining bans.
---
are you suggesting that a human manually reads every single appeal and report that gets sent from a user to the system, regardless if the automation/spam filter/whatever other mechanics they have in place to filter out all the crap, triggers a false positive?  
---
it's possible sure, but the amount of time, resources and people required to do it is far more than current jagex staff can handle. so the real issue is either hiring more staff for customer support, or informing the community of the rules more, so the amount of spam and false appeals is reduced?
---
Not trying to be a dick, just helpin out
---
Dude this NEVER happens. I‚Äôve been on this sub for like 5 years now and what always happens is tons of people post about their account getting unfairly banned and then a Jmod shows up and tells them no, they botted. I‚Äôve seen a legit false positive get posted like twice ever. I don‚Äôt believe a single person in this thread claiming they had their account ruined by a false ban.
---
It doesn't take a Java Developer, to realize withdrawing all on an item with one in the stack shouldn't withdraw two items.
---
It's going to happen anyway, so no reason to keep cancer training methods around anymore anyway. Most skilling, hell most of the game is unplayable cancer on mobile for most people. Any minor change Jagex makes to mobile OSRS to make it even 1% easier/better has a much more profound effect on desktop, probably closer to 10%.
---
My account got hijacked yday took me 5 minutes to get it back???
---
+1 this is great
---
11$
---
Why do you assume the streamer's is some magical hand wave solution? Why would the support specialist assume that? From Jagex's perspective it should be another account where they'll use the same info to confirm or deny it. A stream shouldn't be used as evidence, it could be hiding 3rd party applications with overlays.
---
Have you even checked his new Quick guide series? He teleports everywhere.
---
he should have to make a random twitter/reddit account so no one knows who he is and make a post about being banned unfairly, then hope it catches on enough so jagex will look at it.
---
you know, the osrs support system.
---
This will 100% get you banned btw
---
when i little i asked my mom why i had to shovel the snow off the sidewalk, she said it was the reason she had me. i will pay it forward and make my son train my rc
---
Reason why Sire is an ass boss. Id rather have the head and jar on the boss droptable itself as 1/3k drops or something. Atleast the Unsired would be guaranteed profit apart from the pet.
---
-11 Unsireds 4 jars 3 heads
---
I'm ranked in the top 500 in Construction and STRONGLY support adding left-click Construction. I don't want Jagex to think every maxed player is a maxed sweaty screeching about skill devaluement.
---
Fastest construction exp would be giving Barlak inventories of long and curved bones. You get 4500exp per long bone and 6750exp per curved bone. Obviously this isn't optimal since they aren't tradeable and it would take a very long time to gather all of the bones, but you do get 126k exp per inv of long bones.
---
You must know a lot about programming
---
just do something like mut3 or mu7e
---
Buy bonds
---
I mean, I got a macroing major while recording but because I'm not a streamer, it was unappealable... I was telegrabbing wines of zammy, which is commonly bottled, but wasn't using mousekeys or anything. Perm ban, no appeal.
---
The one downvote is from a wine botter
---
I can vouch for this as well. Seems broken.
---
This happened on Vorakth. I got pet at 110 and just loved doing it but now I feel i can‚Äôt chase the pet now
---
i'm struggling to see what kind of positive effect expanding the wild will have on the game.
---
it's already big, and rather empty because of it.
---
Helping
---
It's not weeks though. It's automatic permabans with no appeals. Unless you're a streamer, your account is done and there's no getting it back.
---
$400 is nothing.
---
9 hunter, good lad getting that Varrock Museum done!
---
Get chrome cast app for the computer or screen share for Mac. You can then.
---
I love it but don‚Äôt know if it truly fits, might be too OP. Upvoting for effort though.
---
Most other MMO‚Äôs earn a lot more money. Also the jmods handling these bans and the mods we deal with on reddit don‚Äôt have a say in the CS, I‚Äôm sure if they were allowed the funds they‚Äôd love to improve the CS, but if you ‚Äòpay attention to reality‚Äô you‚Äôd realise they have extremely limited resources at hand, they make do with what they can.
---
I don‚Äôt think that him streaming at DK‚Äôs really counts as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù. Sure there wasn‚Äôt anything apparent that was showing him macroing while he was streaming, but account bans on an automated system could be delayed and take place hours after the offense actually occurred. 
---
Back to your point, if that saves people from faulty bans, do players start recording themselves every time they log in to provide ‚Äúevidence‚Äù if they get banned against it? 
---
At the end of the day this is a customer support issue. We‚Äôre all players of the game and should have equal ways of settling disputes such as this one. Not having to stream your gameplay and hope someone from Jagex is watching you as a viewer to protect you from faulty account bans. Everyone should feel protected and have means of getting in contact with someone who can fix the problem.
---
Oof
---
Weird. I had a false positive ban and appealed. Got denied and told that the system was right and didn't falsely ban me. I tweeted mod tyran and he personally looked into it for me and unbanned me. Shit system u have
---
2k? What 2k?
---
That sounds like fucking cancer. Why would kills be 3+ minutes each?
---
so you think its a bad idea bc of wildy slayer being the most optimal?
---
Don't try and ride a high horse.
---
Everyone knows this game's code is garbage. They wouldn't be trying to rewrite it all if it wasn't.
---
You dont need to be good at the game to get a firecape with those stats.
---
I don‚Äôt know the finer details of the issue identified or the information used to derive that.
---
However, in general, if I see what looks like an issue and then double check to verify that is in fact what I thought occurred actually did...that whole process is going to be way quicker than having to look into an issue with no context at all.
---
You‚Äôll still continue playing the game though ay lmfao
---
Well at 80 mage the best investment is burst/barrage runes lol
---
I don't see an issue with this tbh.
---
2k total level

"  This is not an appealable offence and we will not review it should you contact us by email, ticket or social media. "
---
I think it‚Äôs a bad idea because always paying for a specific task will be the best way to train slayer. Pretty much defeats the entire purpose of slayer which is to get some variety and kill different shit.
---
isnt efficient venenatis actually better than zulrah/vorkath? So still pretty good money.
---
Very nice work showing that my analogy was inaccurate. I hadn‚Äôt thought of it like that.
---
He didn‚Äôt even appeal. Jagex fucked up with human error and someone was in attendance to fix it with human effort. It would‚Äôve happened to anyone being watched by a jmod at that exact moment. 
---
If you still don‚Äôt want to see it that way, there‚Äôs nothing else to possibly say.
---
When the majority of the players that engage in PvP want a specific update that affects PvP and it somehow doesn't pass, what do you interpret that as? When players brag about voting no to PvP updates because they dislike the "toxicity" of pkers, what do you interpret that as?
---
Are you addicted perhaps? Don't knopw where else to blow your free time? Some book reading or reading random trivia will do more for you than playing a game. You also don't risk a ban.
---
-1055 now. How time flies.
---
There are two different kinds of permanent bans: perms for rwt and perms for botting. When you are banned for real world trading, the system will clear your account and have all its stats reset. When the ban concerns macroing only, the system will lock the account, but the account in itself will remain untouched. This means that the account can be recovered and nothing will habe changed if the appeal was succesful. I personnaly had a perm for macroing and I managed to recover it after 4 years.
---
So basically your point is ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a grumpy goose who doesn‚Äôt want other people to play the games they enjoy‚Äô
---
What about friends I know who have submitted requests a month ago (during your not ban) when they got accidentally banned too. The reason for the ban changed several times apparently and nobody has even looked at it. 
---
Also what about the reports of someone I caught actively cheating and have reported on all of my accounts multiple times yet they are still logging in everyday.
---
Although with eve, CCP artificially effect plex prices by doing loads of sales to keep the price down, which in turn is the best time to make a big profit, buy loads of plex during a sale then wait a few weeks after then dump :)

Seems to be a bigger issue, reports of false positive bans are way up in the last few days
---
Literally 15 mins later 1050 lmao
---
Isn't a heavier script easier to detect?
---
Congratulations, you released your account into and now your account is gone. 
---
Be more careful next time and gl on the new account.
---
Ha! -1066 now.
---
You can still apply for a job that isnt taking applications. The point is, you can do whatever you want but it wont go through the appeal process. Therefore, you cant appeal it.

My clanmate took 10k KC to get his, good luck and I hope you don't end up like him
---
I'm intrigued. How much xp/hr is reading books?
---
That's what he's saying.  Change your name, now your username is different than your login name.
---
Ok, fam.
---
I mean yeah. But you can always get stuff from friends. Like my mate gave me BCP and I buy him beers from time to time. Or like someone stated you can get funneled from main. 
---
Myself, I like to play casually. So when I got stuff done by my friend (firecape) i was like sure. I tried got to jad wave 5 times and let my friend do it. I just like to kill shit and farm. No need to flex with my "superior" pvm skills.
---
Let me make sure I understand the process.
---
- The system automatically bans.
---
- A random daily sample gets checked.
---
- If your account is not part of this daily sample, you are permanently banned with no appeal process.
---
Back in the trade limit days, mint cakes were used as currency. What a strange time.
---
&gt; it's possible sure, but the amount of time, resources and people required to do it is far more than current jagex staff can handle.
---
Then they need to dial back their fucking cheating detection systems immediately if they can't bother/afford to hire more support staff. I'd rather more botters go unbanned than innocent players get banned.
---
Even if it takes them **5 hours** to review a single high-level account ban (it doesn't), that's barely a drop in the bucket to the player that just had 2,000+ hours of their life stolen from them. It's the absolute least we deserve as players.
---
Planning out my first ever attempts for fight caves. Will be using rune cbow broad bolts and dhide. I‚Äôll be using Sara brews and have two questions.  In conjunction with the brews should I be using super restores, ranging potions, or both? I am going to use diamond bolts(e) for Jad. Should I also bring ruby bolts(e) for the beginning of Jad? I feel like they would be helpful as they could potentially hit up to 50 with the effect, but I could also see them being a waste of an inventory slot
---
Then how cant we
---
So what this is, is clue juggling. Which is the process of keeping 2 or more clues "active" by constantly dropping and picking them up so they dont despawn. The way the game is supposed to work is if you have 1 medium clue in your bank or on your person, you will not receive another medium clue. By leaving it on the ground, the game does not count that as you having one so you can get another drop.
---
The way this saves your step is because you dont let the clue despawn you keep the step count, and the game just treats the clues on the ground as one. 
---
Basically, its only worth doing if you are hunting clue scrolls and somehow get 2. Or if you are swamp man or uim verf with a region locked account.
---
Not gonna lie, I expected you'd say "I did see a lot of cute guys." after typing " Never met any cute girls that play but ."
---
Also look at how many people didn‚Äôt quit because they enjoyed the game. ay lmao
---
None of you seem to be enjoying the game thanks to this thread....
---
Given how important death mechanics are for UIMs, that would be a really interesting challenge. For example, to my knowledge, the only way to empty a looting bag outside of a bank interface is through suiciding. So HCUIM would completely remove looting bags from the UIM meta.
---
Bro, I'm gonna try to say this without being an asshole... just learn when to give up. You're making yourself look like an absolute dolt in this thread. Just leave before you get stuck in this grave you're incessantly digging yourself.
---
That was a very enjoyable read
---
Pass.  Your suggestion is just "What if there was new item that boosted earth damage? And how about we wrap an extra layer of drop chance around it?"  It's not so much an "dungeon update" as it is a single item and a single monster to drop that item.
---
Basically if you start at 1 and keep adding halves of halves of halves, you get impossibly close to 2.
---
You work for a joke of a company
---
Cya
---
I‚Äôll give you a set of full rune if you need it and me in game T3A.
---
My man, it's a joke.
---
You wont lol
---
I just think there's a time and place lol, me or you wouldn't think badly on someone for playing in the gym I'm sure, but i can imagine someone who has never played it to look down and think "wtf is he doing at the gym cutting that tree over and over again what a saddo" haha
---
Do you have any NMZ points already? You need some for absorb and overload potions for a proper run.
---
Check the strategy guide on the wiki and double check you did the quest for the best lineup of melee only enemies.
---
I looked at a YouTube video that covered everything for nmz beginners.
---
Lol me to (not the snow shoveling part) my ex lvl is 1 and a total of 1184 will definitely make my son trading rc for me
---
I think jagex implied that the new clan system needs to be implemented first for the group Ironman mode to work correctly. I would assume sometime in the middle of next year, considering the amount of work the clan system will take to complete. Take this with a grain of salt but that‚Äôs my best guess, June-Sep 2020
---
The ticket process is trash compared to other companies.
---
Cause I'm at work and dont have access to my google shit
---
10/10 would trade
---
My PB is with a tbow too, that doesn't mean it's consistent. It's highly variable. The *average* kill time with a twisted bow is 2 minutes, meaning on average 45 seconds longer than max mage/ranged. You definitely do go above 2 minutes with it. You're either lying or mis-remembering. I've done Literally 500+ tbow only kills at max efficiency for that setup and it wasn't even uncommon to go over 3 minutes.
---
Sad really how the sub seems to discourage any JMod from posting here by just sending negativity holy shit
---
I like your work ethic. Im sorry this happened to you man. Best of luck!
---
I have 1 rc and hunter lvl
---
I didn‚Äôt make a post calling you a brainlet lol. I don‚Äôt care if pvpers have to do pvm shit. I think it would be great if they could jump straight into pvp if that‚Äôs how they want to play the game. That doesn‚Äôt mean that the majority of players should have to do an activity that they don‚Äôt find remotely enjoyable. Being in the majority does matter, unfortunately for the minority. 
---
The wild has MA, a ton of bosses, rev caves, wildy slayer, chaos altar, Hunter, and clue hunting that all incentivizes non pvp players to go into the wild. What more is needed?
---
I really don't see what there is to complain about though. 
---
Do you think literally every player should get a response time within minutes?
---
Or do you think that if a Jmod happens to be watching a stream and because of that be informed that he should look into the latest ban wave, he should ignore it to be more fair to non-streamers?
---
Grants players experience equivalent to their level in a skill times 15
---
If you can afford it you can be in the 80s in about 1 month or  few hours of in game time
---
Works for right click too. If you right click, leave the menu open and then do this, the right click menu will stay open as it freezes your screen while you make a selection.
---
So are you just missing the part where you click my link, go through all the steps and send in an appeal for your ban?
---
[Worked for me and plenty of other.](https://imgur.com/a/YnQE6ZR)
---
I don't care what you do, I'm just telling you that this is the way you can appeal a false botting ban.
---
I've done around 300 with tbow and have only gone over 3minutes 10 times max. No lie. I'm geared in absolute max with 99 ranged and drag arrows.
---
Oi. Thx
---
Lmao no you aren‚Äôt
---
They've never said no ban guaranteed, they've said numerous times that 3rd party clients are at your own risk and can trigger their bot detection system.
---
You're absolutely right.
---
That was the conclusion I came to. I always liked the fun of clue scrolls and slayer but after awhile I realized thats *all I do.*
---
Anytime I had to grind something I gave up, lol.
---
That's what I mean by WoW is so much more accessible to the casual player. I can actually progress in the game and maintain my life! 
---
Seems like everything fun to do in OSRS requires 90+ combat stats. My ranged is still 77 lmao.
---
Haha I guess that‚Äôs one way of telling someone you‚Äôre into them
---
I don‚Äôt even play runescape anymore, I just browse reddit
---
I'm in the same boat. Made an alt to experiment with afk money making and got banned the same day. I've got all the level up screenshots but I'm not a streamer so I guess I'm fucked ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
You made it sound it was not possible to do so lul
---
Not really, I see tons of Jmod replies that get a lot of upvotes. They only get downvoted to hell if they're spouting bullshit or keep repeating the same non-statement over and over again.
---
The player was unbanned. Other associated players were unbanned. Feedback was given to the anti-cheating specialist was responsible. Mod Tyran talks about the issue in more detail here: [https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dlhzok/why\_shouldnt\_evscape\_get\_a\_faster\_recovery\_than/f4qk34l/](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dlhzok/why_shouldnt_evscape_get_a_faster_recovery_than/f4qk34l/)
---
I understand that, but the general mindset has changed since the old days, and theres a lot more guides out there to help you. There‚Äôs even a jad simulator so you can familiarize with the mechanics. Jad isn‚Äôt really an endgame challenge anymore.
---
Yet funnily enough this post is about a false ban and the streamer had his account unbanned because he streams. I've seen it happen at the very least 5 times over the past few years. Downvote me all you like, I'm not saying anything that isn't fact.
---
Also, you've proven my point. You don't believe anyone in the thread about a false ban, imagine Evscape coming here having to ask for help if he wasn't a streamer and you're one of the people reading it...
---
So I just got a macro major yesterday and I was not using Macros at all? What do I do in this case because I have not been replied to yet.
---
You mean all I hotta do to get customer support is stream on twitch whenever I play?  Ha,  DEAL!
---
How can you encounter a false positive if there is no avenue for these banned players to even CONTACT jagex.
---
If so they weren‚Äôt very good or weren‚Äôt well known or something, the only guides I was aware of were the regular lengthy ones
---
I wouldn't be averse to reducing the length of time each trawl takes, but I'd prefer to separate that from any change in the droprate of the angler's outfit.
---
&gt;Seems like everything fun to do in OSRS requires 90+ combat stats. My ranged is still 77 lmao.
---
Honestly, I don't think it **seems** that way, I think it **is** that way. OSRS has been around long enough now that it's basically become EndgameScape. I started this August on a new account and I feel have this perception that I am super far behind everyone and need to play twice as much to catch up.
---
I personally don't mind playing that much to catch up, I'm having fun. Still though, I wouldn't have been able to enjoy any endgame PVM until next Spring or Summer if I wasn't going at it so hard. 105m total XP since 8/7/19.
---
This wouldn't make it heavier, it would be 1 more line.
---
I had to quit playing once I realized that spending 5000 hours clicking on a screen to earn accomplishments on a game isn‚Äôt how I want to look back on my early teens/early 20s. Other online games I at least have fun while I‚Äôm playing but runescape is just 100 hours of doing a skill then feeling good for 10 minutes when you get a 99.
---
I think you need to further explain the idea. How could gp suddenly become worthless? Would that not just be banning the account and removing the gp?
---
No he values having things RIGHT NOW. You can easily afk for loads of money with little time investment by the player, just takes a while in real time.
---
I‚Äôm not defending this system. The general rallying cry of ‚Äúeveryone gets streamer treatment or no one gets streamer treatment‚Äù is fairly ridiculous considering it‚Äôs not arbitrary that streamers get special treatment, it‚Äôs a result of them throwing all their weight and influence at jagex directly, forcing a response. Would the community be any happier if the streamers would get falsely banned and stayed that way? No. Would jagex be any better off without streamers showcasing their game? No. 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to defend streamer favoritism, but it‚Äôs not arbitrary. The average player can‚Äôt get the scrutiny that streamers have, and the amount of true positives that get appealed is massive. How do people suggest jagex fix the system?
---
Yes, I think it‚Äôs broken as hell. I also think it‚Äôs the nature of the beast when dealing with a game with consistently peaks at over 100k online at a time with thousands upon thousands of macroing offenses. If jagex allowed appeals for every ban, a majority of appeals (that would need to be manually reviewed) would be for true positives, bans that were deserved, and the system wouldn‚Äôt work better. 
---
Maybe this is being the devils advocate, but seriously, how do people propose the fix here?
---
You gotta find a way to make PKing profitable - every other part of the game involves increasing skill to increase profits. So the better at PKing you become the better your profits, but even at the lowest level of succes it can‚Äôt be a GP loss every fight or no one will continue trying and continue learning.
---
They even say "imagine if we weren't streamers" in the video. That about sums it up.
---
Solid shout here.
---
Yes. If  you X out and dont die/kill the monster in a minute you auto-log out.
---
Fyi you can only stack 10 reward tokens, so its not like purple sweets which are not usable in the inferno.
---
Were you streaming? If not you‚Äôre sol.
---
I did fight caves last night.  Literally kept my prayer on 50% of the time, 80% of that time was after wave 40 when you start getting rangers and magers on your ass.  Died at wave 61 because I didn't realize the magers also had a melee that can hit for about 50.  12 Sara brews, 3 bastion potions, and the rest super restores, had plenty of restores left by the end. And was intending to just keep my prayer up 100%.  Fuck prayer flicking that shit, I'm not good enough yet.
---
Nobody can win the Reddit lottery for macroing anymore. Look at the sidebar. Sadly me and others have had accounts banned that won't ever be properly reviewed.
---
Fixed it for you: https://i.imgur.com/8a8DlSd.png
---
My fav thing is when ur in pvp world and u see a guy who just got a kill get rushed instantly and you cant even pj the lame ass rusher off cuz it says hes fighting an opponent.
---
I don't disagree either but downvoting their posts when they do something like this is pretty much the only way to show you don't agree or aren't satisfied with the answer. It's not like they'd poll stuff like this or read this entire subreddit. It's also not like downvotes are such a big deal anyway. 
---
They avoid topics like this so answering here is pretty much the only way to get your feedback across, and everyone always has something to say on reddit, so it's immediately a ton of negative feedback. But to be fair, the top replies are very civil and the most upvoted one even starts with "I know you're not responsible for the bot detection system".
---
I just got to 32 Farming and I'm looking to start growing trees.  If I pay the farmer to look after my trees, will I get the full exp if I don't check the health of the trees myself since the farmer checks them?
---
Bungie does the same shit in Destiny and noone cares there either.
---
It's sad really.
---
yeah i wish i could do that but im a hcim
---
Mad cuz doesn't have 400 dollars to spend on what they want.

Mod Tyran talks about the issue in some detail here: https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dlhzok/why_shouldnt_evscape_get_a_faster_recovery_than/f4qk34l/

That‚Äôs fair enough. Thanks for the reply Sween.
---
There's something in the works for Rune pouches for the duration of the beta. Blog coming imminently.
---
How do you have money for bossing gear starting from nothing?
---
Only 2 things to do in the wild. Revs or pk lol
---
Oof just realized Ironman can‚Äôt pickup your stuff and you can‚Äôt see it. That‚Äôs sucks. RIP 18M. :( I feel like if an iron PKd you that you should be able to go back and get your stuff.
---
spoken like someone with no disposable income
---
I mean they just appeal the ban which is marginally better than a 0% chance
---
Definitely grind out stats for mm2 and ds2. My stats are relatively comparable and I got them both finished no problem
---
It wouldn't be as simple as copy and pasting a minigame from RS3 to OSRS. We've seen the state of multiple minigames which lack enthralling rewards (they aren't very active) and I think the same would be said for FoG.
---
They've stated perm bans can be automatic but they 100% check all perm bans to ensure they're 100% correct.  
---
So while a false positive can happen, they fix it after. Just as they've said.
---
Warframe is free, yet I have customer support help within the hour.  What's the excuse?
---
of course roald plays tau, smdh. would 100% steal a manta for shits and giggles
---
We've spoken about it in recent Q&amp;As. We're looking to poll some Sire questions soon, and then I think we'll be looking at Grotesque Guardians.
---
You're the fucking bafoon here. Sween has straight up admitted that false bans happen, and essentially said "fuck you" to the entire player base.  The fact that you accept that and then go onto suck off Jagex is laughably pathetic.
---
I knew it was a built in windows tool i should have guessed it had a shortcut lol. Ive snipped tens of thousands of of imagine. I guess it was better than using print screen and cropping in paint back in the early days.l
---
yep!
---
My f2p skiller was also perm banned for the same reason. Was just fishing on it alongside my other account doing a actual things. It's really annoying.
---
No stat restrictions? Loot a pvp world until you can afford some pure essence, make wraths, double nats, or double deaths (whatever is most gp/hr right now) until you can buy the gear for a boss you'd like to camp as you continue the rebuild.
---
I don't understand what you mean by this comment. Wyverns? What are you referring to? Respond to the wrong comment?
---
I guess I'm assuming you can scrounge up a couple of hundred K from menial shit beforehand.
---
What content would you want to see added to the guilds?
---
Like he said, if your reading comprehension is good.
---
Each their own i guess. I hated being broke aside from the bow, felt like I essentially ironmemed myself haha
---
You must click on every pure essence individually and use it on the alter to craft a rune. 
---
Make every NPC/stall/chest require the pickpocket/steal/open option to be moved down the dropdown list. So all thieving activities will require you to right click. 
---
No more skips or blocks in slayer. You must do every task, you also can‚Äôt reset the task at a lower slayer master.
---
Jagex have said in the past that they check all perm bans manually (if the perm ban was automatic), so it would have been unbanned eventually, just not instantly, assuming the ban was incorrect.
---
You still can. You have until the BH update happens. Which will occur in 1-2 weeks from this Thursday. Jagex hasn‚Äôt set the date in stone as of yet. But it will occur in that time frame.
---
What would make it useful without also making it abusable via exacerbated points/XP gain?
---
Getting fired doesn't stain your resume. If a company does a reference call to a previous employer the previous employer just confirms dates of employment and nothing else 99.99999% of the time. Your previous employer doesn't want to be sued to Oblivion so literally the only thing they will answer is what dates you were employed.
---
Use your phone then
---
ü¶Ä
---
Thankyou and *facepalm*
---
I feel attacked.
---
You can‚Äôt appeal a Macroing major, that‚Äôs the issue.. it‚Äôs a permanent ban without any avenue to contact Jagex support
---
there was also library pattern man who got banned even though he didn't cheat
---
Will we still get the Prif drop rates today like you promised? 
---
And please get someone to make some changes around Jagex before the game dies. This account security and customer service is dreadful.
---
Just work towards a goal bro. Same as any fresh account. Quest cape, diary cape, max combats, raids, etc.
---
That fucking sucked
---
Go to world 18???? Jesus do some research before posting
---
Andddd perm banned
---
Good thing there is no Dragon Cape.
---
&gt;The issue is simply that Jagex has always insisted up to now that their system does not throw out false positives
---
This is untrue, there's been tons of false bans in the past where Jagex admitted the cases were false positives. The most notable are Lynx Titan and some random redditor who got banned for using a touchscreen to fletch or enchant bolts (something like that) before mobile came out.
---
&gt;This is made worse by the fact that there is no appeals process in place for accounts banned in this way
---
This is also wrong, there's a separate support article where you can appeal your account from and you can contact support on Twitter, granted the latter isn't the most ideal way.
---
And this is my argument for not raising minimum wage. Mini wagies are like this guy, not willing to put in the effort to get that fire cape. Totally willing to stick with that obby cape forever, even though its the least effort and least rewarding cape in the game. Why SHOULD the cape get a buff? Just GET A FIRE CAPE 4HEAD. LEARN TO JAD. LEARN A TRADE/SKILL
---
they don't ban rwt to begin with
---
If you are talking about PvP, no. You need ranged to stack damage or else it‚Äôs just an eatting battle. Otherwise, go P2P and actually enjoy the PvM bruv
---
You can though I've done it before.  My account got hacked and botted on then banned.  I appealed and got unbanned in 2 days.
---
Your login email stays the same, but you can change the associated email at any time.
---
I agree, while I dont mind the idea, I just think it's a little to simple, and I would like to know what he believes the drop rate should be for all these items, the lvl of the boss, and I think 30% is a little high
---
Yeah I mean I get that. I guess I just don't understand why the Mod said "he"
---
Longer response from anti-cheating specialist Mod Tyran:
---
&gt; It's human error that acts as a double edged sword - even though we use very few of them, automated bans are actually very accurate (much more so than human) but they are fed from human learning to help improve and make them effective, otherwise they would be wildly inaccurate and flag entire swaths of innocent users, or be very niche and therefore not effective in aiding to take out mass amount of bots (contrary to popular belief, we do ban over 15,000 bots per day in OSRS - mostly made up of 'suicide bots' created to generate a small amount of wealth and trade it off as quickly as possible). Whilst the automated system does ban a number of accounts, these are from heuristics built by the team and are only made live after vigorous checks. When they do eventually get made live, they are very restrictive on what type of account they look for and are reviewed frequently. The vast majority of accounts are all checked by members of staff - hence where human error unfortunately comes in to play.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; When assessing if an account is a bot or not, we do not examine if they belong to any noteworthy players in the community, members of staff or anything else of the sort - they are all assessed on the same basis, hence the ban on the account aforementioned. It just so happened I was watching a stream at the time, and therefore was made aware of a false-positive ban and could remove it in real time, rather than it being picked up in our daily quality and sampling checks - something we do to audit ourselves as a team to ensure we remain consistent and as accurate as possible. These are additional checks we do on top of verifying if a flagged account is a bot or not. I would have, and have unbanned players where the ban is incorrect as and when I see it, just players who are in the public eye are much more obvious.
---
&gt; I know this doesn't provide a clear answer on "why not just allow all bans to be appealable?" which has been addressed elsewhere in the past, but I hope it gives a little bit of information on how our team works when looking for and applying punishments to accounts.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dlhzok/why_shouldnt_evscape_get_a_faster_recovery_than/f4qk34l/?context=3
---
That reminds me of when i played it last year for a couple weeks and I reached level 120 in like 5 hours( i think double exp weekend was going on tho). it ended up still being a grind but with more reward. It also lost its charm of a having a big community, sadly.
---
I'd vote ESH considering that the guy was in the wilderness afterall. :^)
---
Lets remove the wildy while we are at it
---
They‚Äôre not that bad. Pretty consistent mechanics. The tough part on galvek is it can be a little rng with bolt specs if you don‚Äôt have a decent setup, but your range level is fairly high for the quest. It‚Äôll just take some practice if you‚Äôre not great at PVM. But it‚Äôs consistent.
---
If I die and lose it can I get it back?
---
After looking at a few more posts I believe it could potentially be due to using remote desktop idk if this ruin my chances of appeal and suggestions are much appreciated
---
RS2 removed free trade and added trade limits, it didn't go too well
---
270*
---
Wait how
---
&gt;No not minutes but within a week there should be responses, which typically doesn't happen.
---
That, if anything, is an entirely separate issue. In this case the streamer never even made an attempt to get a response from Jagex, it was just pure happenchance.
---
&gt;It's just bullshit lol. You don't pull these special strings when half of your playerbase has nearly zero customer service.
---
Ah, okay, so we should *not* revert automatic bans because Jagex has shit customer service.
---
No it isn't it's like 200 dollars?
---
They have said that the last 60 seconds of activity is recorded when a report is issued. I imagine they do the same here. Though I'm not sure. I think it's more difficult than people think to look into every case. If you look at pretty much every single "I got banned but did nothing wrong" post, they end with a JMOD saying they personally reviewed the ban and know for sure they botted. Because it's such a small minority of people who are falsely banned it's pretty difficult to review every case in a timely manner.
---
I spend 98% of my time playing in the wilderness. Farming will have to be a no from me lol
---
I'm sure most do and claim they buy bonds
---
If they implement the rewards the same way they did last time and make those rewards relevant for both F2P and P2P? Yes. Combat robes were BIS mage, Druidic robes had their niche in F2P PVP wars, and the rune berserker shields were BIS *and* those four shields were the only shields in F2P that provided a strength bonus. While the uncharged rewards were tradeable, you needed FoG tokens to recharge them, and all the armor (aside from the gauntlets) drained charge just like Barrows armor, and since the only way you can recharge your BIS equipment is to play the minigame, yeah I see people playing this. 
---
As for P2P, Battle robes weren't BIS, but when combined with the Staff of Light, it saved 50% of your runes. I don't know if it'd be EHP, but I'm sure there's some people who'd like to save some money on bursting by playing a fun minigame for a few hours. There were also plenty of skilling rewards that Jagex could re-add, like the herb gloves or the dragon slayer gloves.
---
Also, Pest Control and Barbarian Assault both provide really powerful equipment, and people hate those minigames. If FoG had worthwhile rewards like that, there would absolutely people be playing it just for the sake of having those rewards.
---
Hmm I guess that‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs not OP like the crushed bird nest boxes or whatever that got patched
---
Now that I don't know
---
You‚Äôre the one whose being pedantic here
---
That‚Äôs one of the worst things about this life, imo.
---
Unfortunately the only way to effectively stop RWT is to remove the wild, duel arena, and free trade all at once. 
---
They've done this before and the game never truly recovered.
---
Is w318 a Bounty Hunter World?
---
It‚Äôs ok guys lets  sink thousands of hours into this game to get falsely banned because this dude said humans make mistakes and it‚Äôs all good, we should just forgive them and continue to get fucked in the ass
---
What you said about forgiving people is true but open your fucking eyes
---
I think it's still ridiculous it happens to even a small percentage of players. They don't even have customer support to fix these types of mistakes either.
---
Suddenly all the Mod Weath smackdowns aren't as funny
---
540*
---
Streaming is not evidence. He could just as easily bot, rwt, or break any other rule while not on stream. It is simply favouritism.
---
LMAO
---
slater's had this pfp for years, him and ash have interacted a bunch of times
---
The one thing that really needs to be discussed and fixed ASAP is the false positives in your bot-detection system. EVScape just got falsely perm-banned on stream. The only reason he got his account back is because he is a popular streamer and a JMod was in the audience. This is really just unacceptable, that seemingly anyone can have their accounts permanently banned, with no option to appeal, for no reason whatsoever, other than your faulty macro/bot-detection system. Fix it Jagex.

not OP but average age matters to me because I don't want to be in a clan with super immature people / kids

Never said working at your irl job is a way of playing... but having an irl job or other real life priorities almost surely take away from the ability to play the game the amount he would need to in order to earn these items purely in game. He or she looks like they decided to spend their money to shave this time off. 
---
Also how the hell are people expected to literally research which items are best now? Is this the level of elitism the community has hit? Believe it or not some people don‚Äôt play for pure maximum efficiency. Some people play the game for *gasp* fun...
---
Just edit lool

Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8. M8ke your own g8me

Are there any F2P money makers that can help you escape? I don‚Äôt mind putting in some decent hours!
---
There is a trade limit, it's based on certain items for F2P, how long you've played and how many quest points you have.

I have deleted them all this morning and will return to the vanilla client

I edited my original comment because I misunderstood what was happening in the clip.

Politics and recent events aside, you have to give credit where it's do. Blizzard has always had top tier customer service when it comes to their games and their accounts. It's gone down hill imo over the last couple of years - like pretty much everything else about the company since the Activision merger. But it's still better then anything Jagex has implemented by a mile.
---
If your purely after the pet and not concerned about efficiency (as much as you can afking) then lobsters are you best bet as the have higher catch rate/hour

you can \*gasp\* google it. first link for best in slot items for literally any setup. as i said, if that's how he wants to spend his money, fine. It's not against the rules assuming he's paying for it through bonds. But at least own it. If you feel you've done nothing wrong, own it. Lying about how you got the money is what makes people upset. I earned those items by genuinely grinding out 99 slayer (I work 50 hours a week by the way, and I found the time to do it the way it's intended to be done, so let's not use that as an excuse) for the items i have. It's offensive to have people who clearly pulled out their credit card claim to have put in the work that I (and many others) have put in. Can you sympathize with that?
---
&gt;Let's be realistic here. Mods are people. They only have so much vision and so much time in a day. 
---
No ones acting if they aren't lol.
---
&gt;Yes, if they are personally affected and witness a false positive ban, they will look into it right away if they have the power. 
---
And again, that's where the bullshit lies.
---
&gt;Jagex could do better on support, but you need to get off your high horse and just don't play the game if you are such a whiner and can't understand how people act in a real scenario.
---
Lmao what the fuck? What high horse? What the fuck is this 'just don't play the game if you are such a whiner'? Me complaining about the actions j mods are taking in response to their notorious shitty customer service has nothing to do with how I play the game. Fucking stupid lmao. You shouldn't do things like this in the public eye when there are so many issues with the current system. I don't give a shit about this 'oh they're humans they can do what they can', Jagex can also hire 100 more people to look over these bans. It's simply shit practice to do this while there are people waiting for weeks+ to get ANYTHING about their bans. Somehow you don't see the issue with it so please don't respond to me whatsoever because I'm not having this stupid ass conversation again.
---
If it can be frozen with ancients or entangle that might help a lot

Shout out to the dwarfs putting up with that fat twat all day
---
Trust the osrs community of big brains to not understand sarcasm.
---
Excellent idea. I never even considered it. I think im gonna hold out though. Theres rumor of a DS3 quest coming and the leather body will become fully immune to all dragon damage. Figure in a few months I can trade it for like, 300 tbows. (May look suspicious letting it go that cheap but hey I like to cut deals)
---
Or maybe they fucking hate their stakeholders and this is a passive aggressive jab at them
---
Efficient skilling is innately more machine-like than playing for fun. I'm not saying it's like botting, but that logically it should be more likely to trip a system.
---
Brawler pet ftw

I'm a really old RS player who has recently come back and been lurking here, what's BIS?  sorry for unrelated
---
Haha woah Mexican pesos looking good too. Live near the border so I could get em easily. thanks for this info, may think about buying bonds like a whale if i ever have to rebuild again instead of going to boglagold lol
---
They've banned people for using metronomes and other methods in the past, I wouldnt say this is risk free
---
Completely false.
---
What did i Just watch?

I got mine @75 doing an herb run

i know right, cant believe he lets him get on for over 12 minutes, im jealous

 Are there any plans on removing the surplus of worlds? This would be a simple solution to help revive the wilderness.
---
I'll upvote pretty much any suggestion that has thought put into it, even if it isn't content I'd personally want to play.
---
Slayer does not need a buff to its exp/hr or gp/he. Sorry, its a no from me.
---
&gt; DI pretty much ran high level wild between 2004-2007
---
I'd say they really started getting challenged in 2006 by TD and IP. Then After TD and IP closed and formed AG they run mage bank until free trade came out. RSD was the only challenge to DI 04-06 though, so that's accurate.
---
cant relate, maxed and immediately began afking castle wars and trouble brewing
---
He would not have gotten automaticly unbanned like Tyran suggest.
---
He would have to file an appeal to get around a 50% chance of getting unbanned.
---
You obviously have no idea what you're talking about lol.
---
What's the video you mentioned?
---
Didnt put 2 and 2 together at first. Thanks. Thats fucking hilarious.
---
Not sure I understand your argument? Alcohol is super dangerous, tens of thousands of people die to drunk drivers alone each year. Thousands of people die each year due to underaged drinking. Getting drunk ruins lives for families. 
---
Meanwhile, studies by the UK have found vaping to be at least 95% safer than smoking cigarettes and that‚Äôs what our government is choosing to ban? And it‚Äôs not like vaping leads to reckless deaths or domestic abuse. 
---
I agree that teen vaping is an issue, but let‚Äôs not pretend that the bans aren‚Äôt knee jerk reactions and driven by big tobacco money.
---
Oi, i know your name!

This is just my opinion, but UIM seems like the dumbest thing these days. No banking/storing items is a neat mode. Using 600 other not-technically-banks-but-functionally-banks instead really ruins the spirit of the mode. It's just less convenient ironman at this point, not sure why people bother.
---
Try not to let your health drop to zero
---
Yeah that's why my friend quit. He refuses to play the game now because of how much of a joke Jagex is when it comes to bots. Theres something wrong when I can see the same account logged in to the same world on the same tile for 3 days straight just HAing at GE non stop and doesn't get flagged or banned, but my friends 3 year iron acc is permanently banned with 0 evidence provided and 0 chance of fighting the ban. And that HA acc isnt as easy to spot as a gambling bot yet they both rarely see action taken against them. Just a damn joke
---
I got banned for doing agility trying to get zulrah shortcut. It was my first long agility grind, and I stuck there for like 2-3 days and on my final hour I got banned because of macroing and cannot appeal. Luckily it wasn't a major macro and I only got like 3 day ban.  
---
The only sin I did is because I watched a movie while doing it and half asleep and moving my mouse too slow and not a streamer nor a youtuber. And for that, jagex, I apologize.
---
Alchemy

Would rather have a berserker prayer.
---
Let me know what you are able to rightfully unban my accounts. It's been 2 years and cost me 3bil. And I reached out over Runescape facebook, twitter, and Reddit. No one cares unless they are famous.
---
when that happened i legit thought people were scamming with it
---
It stands for Best In Slot, but it is sometimes used to refer to the best possible option, not just best gear.
---
It's just group Ironman mode
---
Take the win? The only win is if you're a streamer, if you got falsely banned I'm sure you'd really tkae the win waiting months to be reviewed if it even would be. That unappealable offense would leave you no way to contact them about it. Sooo take that win bro.
---
I think part of it is that it'd be a lot easier to do than Wintertodt, just killing monsters normally. Longer binds would actually be a really good idea to add on to it though.
---
I‚Äôve had several accounts banned over my brief OSRS play, and I‚Äôll say most are rightfully done. I‚Äôm sad to say I have Botted on several accounts, and those that have been banned were rightfully so, nothing more to say about that. What I‚Äôm in constant fear of is my main (which I‚Äôve had since I started playing OSRS around a year ago) which I‚Äôve put hundreds of hours into getting banned for macroing or botting. I only play organically on my main, yet I did receive a macroing/botting Permanent ban around August,  thankfully I was able to appeal it and get it back, I‚Äôm not sure why they gave it to me but the only reason I got it back (from what I could tell) was that I was traveling around and because I had logged in on several different IPs from different countries and they thought that was ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù and returned my account. This is silly, but I feel like I can‚Äôt do any repetitive level grind (such as mining iron for a couple hours) because I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll get some form of ban from doing something so repetitive for too long. This is more stupid fear on my part, but I‚Äôve never played a game which I feel like this.
---
No i been trying to get my account back. I only got hacked and banned omce thanks
---
You're the guy that does 5 raids and complains about no tbow and says raids is shit loot

Thanks for showing everyone that you measure your self worth by some worthless clicks in a game most gamers make fun of. Cheers.

Thank you. I‚Äôll let you know when I try again!

Not true.

It's not runelite plugin,they are beta testing for jagex I think

You only notice vegans who go out of their way to announce their lifestyle. Those who don't announce their lifestyle go unnoticed, so you just assume they're omnivores. Therefore you think all vegans are outspoken.

Extremely false. Been banned for working on coding projects for classes while afking on rs. Accurate is very far from the truth. I'm guessing it looks for programs running simultaneously. Almost always got banned when working on java projects. Be aware
---
Well a few years ago I swapped from rs3 to osrs and it was legit.  Just a random CC I saw advertised
---
Post it in NSFW Runescape?
---
I'm always interested in seeing people's art.
---
another thing in the list for reasons for ban is account hijacking, an unappealable ban. so is rwting. and bug abuse. if you try to appeal for those, including macroing, you'll get an immediate bot response saying you can't appeal those, iirc from another thread awhile back.
---
it is all manual permabans, they just listen two examples, not an exhaustive list (otherwise they would've just listed those two and not "other manual permabans").
---
Tysm ! Finally some useful info that I can work with :). Will do that then.
---
No, it's between the time the hit is calced and when it hits

There can‚Äôt be a %, your pool of tasks are always changing, its based off the weighting dude. Says it all right on the wiki.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZ1AHb2xEk

&gt;it's the convenience of not having to run your own stopwatch or pray early

so materially longer trips and thanks for proving my point

just wait til you do some medium clues and all you get is 5 chaos runes and 30 earth runes
---
Make every even world pvp everywhere. Every odd world shall have no pvp, but shit ping

The wiki has task weights and everything

Huh what?

How come you're still running Android 5.0?
---
This could actually be a really funny if not impractical way of dealing with bots / rwt. If a gold farming bot is discovered, instead of banning it, allow it to continue farming gp, but the account is quietly marked. 
---
Any gp or items it trades (in any way) to players will become useless once the other player receives what they rwt purchased. For gp you could have the entire cash stack they traded for turn into a single chocolate gold coin who‚Äôs only purpose is the examine text ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt pay for this!‚Äù  
---
The implementation might be tricky and i‚Äôm sure there are plenty of problems with this approach, but the anger of being caught rwt from the players side would now be targeted toward the site they purchased from rather than jagex. Also the uncertainty of knowing whether a bot has been detected and flagged to trade junk would likely dampen the amount of rwt that goes on since players wouldn‚Äôt know whether or not they are wasting their money and bot farms would have no way of guaranteeing they aren‚Äôt.
---
Go look at the fucking Duradel wiki page you nunce and scroll down

free exchange of bolivares is forbidden by the venezuelan government and the only legal means is through them, using conversion rates and caps that are detached from reality.

so yeah, you cant
---
Worth it for most bosses. Cox it isn't that great, but for most other bosses they are good. They sometimes let you trade out strength bonus items for def/prayer bonus gear if you don't get a max hit from the extra str bonus. For example, at hydra with tbow, you can use range cape instead of assembler. At cerb with infernal and scythe, you can drop tassets for justiciar legs.
---
I'm just looking at the % for my available tasks rn.
---
When LMS first got updated I seen a couple of posts from Mod Roq I think which said they were hoping to implement other game modes, like a pure mode and that sort of thing. But, this was before all proposed updates failed to pass the poll and since then it feels like anything to do with LMS has been put on the back burner.
---
The way I‚Äôd like to see that work would be to have each game be in a random mode. So you have a bunch of loadouts for each combat bracket/build then when the game starts it‚Äôll be random which mode you‚Äôre in. It would mean that there‚Äôd be more variation on a game by game basis. Some games everyone would be pures, some games zerks, etc.
---
Wow the first google result for ‚Äúslayer task weight‚Äù has this same formula

Sometimes, you google something and get halfway there

So then you have to.... google twice

Got quite a chuckle out of this.

that's even worse damn
---
Oh no I can't draw, I meant I need a sub for your art hehe
---
And you think that's an option Jagex is simply unwilling to explore...?
---
there is no %. This was explained to you by me and the other commenter, you can find it if you want by using the method of adding and deviding wieghts explained by the commenter above me.
---
The post by klott was the information I was looking for. Please take your advice and get lost.

I'm only 1k KC I have 3 jars 4 necklaces and 16 heads but nothing else, so I feel your pain but only about 40% of it KC wise lol

Fuck off
---
&gt; if you try to appeal for those, including macroing, you'll get an immediate bot response saying you can't appeal those, iirc from another thread awhile back.
---
They're wrong. IDK about the other options but when I appealed a ban on RS3 for macroing they gave me a proper response after a few weeks.
---
Perma ban anyone who clicks, no appeals
---
if they ever get banned you‚Äôre just going to have a spawn of people developing non injection clients for a price that they‚Äôll sell to people. no one would be able to detect it if you‚Äôre not a streamer lol. i‚Äôd for sure use one of those.
---
The profile picture is god ash
---
I didn't know until I read this thread. If I'm understanding it right that means that anyone who plays the game is a stakeholder yeah?
---
It would be a PK weapon.

Anyone know if a BGS works against King Kurask? I know SGS can (according to the wiki at least), so maybe...?

Yes all I wanted was that method. Nothing more.

I like skill grinding too but it has to be balanced with... literally anything else.

are you even listening to yourself?

Why would you even mention Jars?are they on the same roll or what

Noted. People were like Google duradel and I'm like....

Doesnt take googling to learn how to find the mean or average of something guy

Stakeholder is anyone who has an interest in the game, so yes anyone who plays it is included. 
---
Loads of people have made that mistake dw

The typical player doesn't even watch streamers, they'd rather play themselves.

Sire's droptable is fine, his only problems are the actual mechanics of the fight that prolong it by too much.

If what happened to you is in no way related to what happened in this instance then why are you posting it?

---
This is not me btw
---
I was asked to not go into the wildy if I didn't want to risk anything. You can't complain now that I've taken the advice
---
He straight up said he did it. That's why it was only a total of two minutes literally for the entire deal. So that whole argument is irrelevant. And as far as that whole "you're crying" thing goes...drop that bullshit, kid. I'm making points. They saw that it happened publicly and acted as quickly as possible for damage control. It's not the streamer favoritism in general I care about so much. It was him that manually fixed it, that's confirmed. So if you're at work, you should be more productive than watching twitch or whatever, especially when you're product has this many issues. That's a main point and if you wanna argue against that, I sympathize with your employer. However if it was done in off time (remember its confirmed that he did it), then he should extend that to every time he comes across an osrs injustice, and we know they get tweeted and see it on here constantly.
---
That's also rejected. Can you believe it? Even 'mewt3d' is a rejected name.
---
It got removed because it's against the rules.
---
The average person is fat though
---
How is posting the exact same ban reason (major macroing) and bringing up the time frame for unban in the discussion of how long people might lose their accounts for not related?
---
Ask for your refund now.
---
Even that has a low success rate if you do that.
---
Actually mining at motherload mine while studying on my laptop.
---
A specific block list and doing specific tasks quickly. 300 is like max gear max efficiency. You can average like 7ish tasks an hour for 25 points each I think then add on the 10 task bonus of 125 points.
---
The reason they've been going on so long is because Reddit takes *everything* at face value. If someone makes a post saying they didn't bot and now their ten year old account is banned it's instantly front page material. Then the Jmod comes through and says you definitely did bot and suddenly everyone reverses their opinion despite no one actually knowing anything about the case. It's stupid.
---
Hire 100 people and solve any situation. If only that was how technology or solving any problem really worked, no one has money or time for your innane ridiculousness. You expect a company to make their software or support better for little to no gain. You were probably banned since you feel so personally wronged by a company trying to cut down on botting. They could always do better.
---
As well, your main argument is favoring streamers. Jagex isn't favoring anyone as a company. That is why people are being people. This is a person taking action using the abilities of his job. Not Jagex paying him to monitor and support streamers better.
---
I think it‚Äôs a 1/64 with a RoW(i).
---
lost mine like this üôÉ
---
I don't condone RWT by any means, but to be clear... you want to contact a Mod to BAN the account you now own... that you paid REAL MONEY for...
---
Yeah seems legit, someone made you salty in game and now your trying to get them back?.. you know jagex can quickly determine if an account is subject to RWT, right?
---
is this torvesta
---
gold is .5
---
Imagine having a billion dollar parent company and having a game with Twitter/Reddit as your support service. ü¶Ä
---
Fathering a child to train your account for you will be picked up just easily as free botting software, unless you program the child to be random?
---
My child: \*pees into toaster\*
---
Grimy Ranarr Weed will do just fine, thanks.
---
I thought it was .61 or something like that.  So that‚Äôs what my example was based off of. Maybe that‚Äôs why bonds didn‚Äôt go over 6M, maybe those websites started buying bonds in Real instead of buying gold from players.
---
Is there a possibility to remove all the dialogue in the Legends Quest dungeon after you've completed the quest?  
---
Going there for a master clue step is annoying enough because of all the items needed but every single action having 2-3 dialogue boxes and a confirmation prompt is kind of annoying every time.
---
It astounds me that you cant? Click to move, read a few sentences. Normal people can multitask, my guy.
---
Fashionscape already.  Go boi. Be the mr moneybags we never deserved
---
my account is safe atm then. however getting a lot of reports will almost certainly get u banned no matter what you do.

---
Did he get to keep the exp or what did they do?

Oh look a skotizo clone. Well thought up overall besides the reward. But why? There isnt any demand for content here. Konar already slightly revitalized this area why does it need content for the sake of content.

Are you f2p? Can you wear rune? I'll give you a set of rune to help you on your way.

You can still get false bans on the official client. Speaking from experience.
---
I had an account (falsely) banned several years ago for macro major. After my appeal was immediately denied with no explanation, I posted about it on reddit and all I got were comments claiming the system was infalliable and that I must therefore clearly be lying. 
---
I'm always a little glad when I see these bad bans get reversed; it gives a little more hope each time for us little guys.
---
How the hell am I suppressed to be sure my account is safe from something like this?
---
Go kill a thousand of them on task and let me know how long it takes and how many supplies you use
---
That's something I'm realizing with this post (That I might damage someone with this action). I'm not salty or anything alike... I just felt.. bad. Like I did something wrong. Like I'm playing on something that's not really mine, and that can be taken away from me anytime. Sure, I should have thought of that before... I know. But, I didnt. I was so fascinated by the idea of having a high level account lol (I don't have time to do that myself, currently)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Do you think I'm overreacting?
---
Didn't he? Maybe he did bot but can't ban streamers.
---

Also Reddit:

My first zulrah kill was only done thanks to a buddy watching and telling me where to stand. I couldn't keep up with prayer flicks and checking where zulrah would go next. Brandon, you the real mvp.

Yeah and if jagex could do the same for mobile it would be such a big QoL
---
You need a Brazilian tax ID to buy them, which is possible to get illegitimately, but hardly worth the possibility of being caught for fraud.
---
What does the inbox message say? It sounds like they told you why
---
I kinda doubt jmods care about gold stickers on reddit tbh.
---
cant tell if this is like a "hurr hurr i would never spend money on VIDEO GAMES like you nerds" thing or not
---
why?
---
If I were to record 100% of my gameplay and have indisputable proof of my innocence, it would still be worthless as there is no way to appeal these bans so nobody would ever review it.  I'd have to create a Twitter account, spam every Jmod and hope to get extraordinarily lucky that they both read my message as well as decide to actually look into it.  Then I'd have to get lucky in it being a mod who knows what they're doing and can conclude I wasnt botting.
---
If they actually had a reasonable appeals system, I would seriously consider recording my screen when I play.  Throwing 1000s of hours away scares the shit out of me.
---
Crazy
---
It's funny how when presented with the evidence that they do in fact review it, you just repeat the same thing like a broken bot.
---
They do review it. As a matter of fact, [here's the page right before submitting your appeal.](https://i.imgur.com/dAUZeOn.png) Notice how it doesn't say Macroing? But I guess people posting screenshots of their false botting bans getting squashed ([heres mine](https://i.imgur.com/Hd7NCBC.png)) telling you this is the method they used won't convince you, so I don't know what will.
---
A major reason why I stopped playing :(
---
Because you don‚Äôt do damage to Kurasks without the leaf bladed weps. But if the sgs works then the bgs probably works.

Xp is decent but not amazing, but the profit can be - especially if you made a lot of gold bracelets yourself, which is another pretty afk xp/profit thing by itself.
---
This is assuming you're studying a book or something though. Doesn't work so well for web content.
---
It's not. It's in reply to the guy saying "get a job". I do have a job that's high stress and I work very hard. I dont see the point in spending money on something that can be achieved by just playing the game
---
I don't think there's such a thing as content that isn't for the sake of content.
---
Oh boy so a few things here, you‚Äôre comparing getting gear to forcing PvM in PvP areas which isnt even close to the same thing. Not even remotely. A more fair comparison would be IF wow had no PvE only servers. PvP servers are the equivalent of the wildy. But even the largest, most successful MMO ever realizes that forcing people that don‚Äôt like pvp into pvp situations is bad. 
---
You don‚Äôt have to be good at both to be a great player. Some of the best pvmers in the game are garbage pkers and vice versa. Being good at the content you like is what makes you a great player.
---
On to your point about not liking PvP meaning your depressed. I‚Äôm sorry what? I think you might be projecting here. I don‚Äôt really know what to say other than this is just ludicrous. 
---
And finally, you‚Äôre right in a PvP world you could kill and loot another player but again WoW, the biggest mmorpg as you put it, offers wholly PvE worlds where thats just not possible excluding specific content that is purely PvP.
---
No I think you genuinely believe that jagex are so simple minded that they would ban "your" account based purely on the evidence that you RWT the account.
---
This makes no logical sense but thankyou for amusing us all with this post.
---
P.S please update us all with Jagex's response lol
---
Want him to mine for you too?
---
I can't tell if this is pasta
---
Content that fills a niche or demand for something. This isnt that. I don't see the point. Earth spells will still be dead content outside of earth surge and even then that wont have a use outside of pking.
---
From himself?
---
Lmaoo I made this comment reverse about rs3
---
Must habe made no money at all, so sad!
---
Ur a donut u donut

But it's not out of the realm of possibility that a jmod likes to watch osrs streams, like you previously said
---
"Love Runescape, Hate Jagex"  A motto to live by.  Hopefully this gets fixed but honestly the chances are pretty fucking slim.  Goodluck.
---
you clowns need to realize that a revamped customer support process is not something that jmods handle. Its a top down choice, and all the top sees is record profits and mtx purchases going up up up up up.

use your high magic and woodcutting to half the cost of getting 85 construction to about 25m using mahogany you cut and plankmake
---
77 rcr
---
use 76 magic to do flax spin spell to get high crating
---
60 fire and farm
---
70 agil and theif
---
I honestly believe indirect changes to the game had drastic negative implications towards Pvp. Instant world hop seems ideal for every facet of the game, but it becomes extremely difficult for small clans/small teams to be able to pk around the wilderness. There isn't a significant delay in scouting worlds, which means clans don't have to worry about having any serious intel or track on a clan to be able to just hit them. They can just have mages quick hop and cover every world in literally a minute. This causes a breakdown in the pvp "foodchain" of resource collectors/pvmers -&gt; small teams -&gt; clans -&gt; clans hunting clans
---
As soon as a bigger clan is out, the pk trip simply devolves into trying to avoid the bigger clan. That's just one of the small changes to the game i think that made pvp dead.
---
Trimming armor
---
Well you should, if left unchallenged, bots have the potential to wipe out the entire game for everybody. Jagex didn't nuke their own game by banning free trade back in the day for nothing. A dead game for everybody is a little worse than a tiny group of players getting banned unfairly imo.
---
Finally an old school RS player thats like me.
---
Of course it does
---
How many times have you seen someone get upset and then apologize for yelling once they were proven wrong?
---
How many times have you seen someone get upset and then apologize for yelling once they proved themselves right?
---
Not sure who the person is (I know he's a streamer) but maybe he did something that would trigger an alert or something in the previous day.
---
Regular magic damage spells are so underused, they should indeed come with secondary effects to atleast make them have a unique use.
---
This is a good idea because of the randomness. Sure, people might trade themselves to test the coins getting ruined and catch it once in a while... but imagine the:
---
1. 1 star reviews on the RWT website for people that legit lost the money
---
2. The number of dishonest people lying to the RWT website and claiming their GP got wiped
---
Chaos all around. The perfect thing to derail and ruin a RWT site.
---
F
---
It is cool, earth spells and brimhaven do need a revamp. The concept is great but the actuality of it needs more refinement. The effort is appreciated!
---
The iron price
---
I think what that means is that a jmod muted your account manually and not a program that has detected you said something offensive. So because the jmod did it manually, it cant show you which exact message it was. Maybe it where multiple idk.. 
---
But yeah i think that is it
---
It's not out of the realms of possibility, but I was wondering if he was watching the stream for work reasons to check if he was botting, which is also possible.
---
my account was also perma'd (i know i didnt hack but think i got phished but i also use vpn so dont have a consistent ip) but jamflux doesnt care bc they know we are addicted and will still spend our ü¶Ä$11ü¶Ä on a new account
---
I think its hilarious
---
Same reason people bother with an ironman, it's just less convenient normal account.
---
Why was evscape banned?
---
Let us know how your appeal goes dude.
---
Y‚Äôall still using runelite or something else given the recent bans or y‚Äôall switch to the vanilla client ?
---
That's still today
---
And you thought "What's the most sociable place in Runescape? F2P Yew trees!"?
---
A account security blog is coming out later this week, they might have changed something with the bot detection/ banning recently which might be causing this
---
I'm STILL laughing at this shit.
---
OP only lasts for a snare.
---
slayer. Great intro to pvm and your bound to get 99 str attack def hp range and def doing slayer. I know youll get 1 or 2 before 99 slayer but its just fun post 99 itll train the otehr levels
---
Also got falso macro ban because right off tutorial island I got 60wc. Never overturned because customer service is an absolute joke.
---
runelite has always been fine to use
---
So what, the occasionally false ban happens but it‚Äôs when everyone and their fucking cousins joins saying they were also got a false ban that drive me insane in fucking reddit. a few mistakes the rest of you who say it was also falsey banned‚Äô you‚Äôre the cheating scumbags. Go back and whine to your parents assholes.
---
Nah mate, the people training prayer are the real test of PvP skill.
---
Thought so, people are just paranoid with Ev‚Äôs ban
---
Yeah I got banned for acting like a bot on purpose as an experiment. Jagex is total bollocks.
---
I'm pretty much right there with you. 3 dexes 13 arcanes
---
This recently happened to me...on Jad.
---
Nice joke, but Incorrectly used meme.
---
1 tick 2 tick suck my dick bullshit
---
Hahahaha
---
Jagex doesn't tell people how the ban happened.
---
You can also just bot on your account from a vpn and it would look the same probably
---
So no thats not evidence enough
---
Baguette
---
If only you realized that time is the most valuable thing in the world and he was saving it
---
You seem very upset. What clan(s) were you in which got killed by rot lol
---
Yikes that photobomb in the public chat
---
But would you say it‚Äôs better than turoths in terms of gp
---
Makes sense actually
---
70 Prayer, Quest Cape/ atleast all the stats for it
---
Ironman is a way different experience than a main. A UIM is just making everything tedious imo
---
Damn didn't even think about practicing there. Thanks!
---
Lmfao üòÇ
---
Even at 60% on 2x2 monsters it is dead content everywhere.
---
I'm not sure if its the same on normal Reddit but I have the Enhancement Suite plugin and its the permalink button under the comment.  Either that or you could just copy paste his whole statement and link the thread.
---
I wonder what the lowest possible clue scroll reward is? I remember a Jmod tweet a while ago, and I thought at the time the lowest clue reward on that tweet was about 15gp, we may have a new winner!
---
166 before log
---
&gt; but with the money jagax makes they can hire a few dedicated people to look into them.
---
&gt;If they got the money to make an automated system that detect certain things they got enough money to make a way to appeal bans and a solution for bots/cheaters that will try and abuse it.
---
Entirely speculative, the fact you even think you can know about Jagex internal money flows proves how much your opinion is worth.
---
Before log

50kc and all I have is top, gloves, and  torch...

---
You can appeal any ban (even botting or macroing) as long as it's not: 
---
‚Ä¢ Bug abuse  
---
‚Ä¢ Real world trading  
---
‚Ä¢ Account hijacking  
---
‚Ä¢ Other manual permanent ban (fraud, community safety)
---
That‚Äôs good, I thought it was unappealable and was so disheartened. Didn‚Äôt want to start over and lose all those hours. Still feels dirty that it did some PvM without me but oh well, it was just zulrah
---
I'll bet that half of those downvotes were people downvoting for the sake of downvoting. A lot of people on Reddit have the tendency to downvote a post strictly because others have downvoted it.
---
The only time I ever "figured out" prayer flicking was against infernal mages. And even then it was just turning the prayer on and off instead of leaving it on, so my prayer still drained just a lot slower. I don't have the time or the focus to do tick prayer flicks to not lose prayer points or whatever.
---
Then I hope you never multi-log or alt. Because that's all he's doing. Still playing 5 accs.
---
Definitely a mob mentality around here.
---
No why would a game be concerned about retaining players and attracting new ones right?
---
Honestly? It's rock solid on my device. I'll probably update now, but this is the first problem I've had with it.
---
His name is CEO you forgot the trade window
---
Seems legit.
---
&gt;needs to be nuked, literally and figuratively
---
&gt; You quite literally cant be intelligent and disagree with this statement.
---
Well, some of the earliest bots did just that, use color recognition to farm materials.  One of the earliest flax picking bots could be easily broken by making a new character with the light blue shirt and standing over the flax.  The bot would start trying to click on you and you could lure it away so you could dominate the flax market.
---
This turned out to be a lie, minimum threshold is live streaming now.
---
But you won't go play a ps no matter how bad customer support is lmao. Youre gonna sit here and whinge on reddit and continue paying 11$ a month and playing.
---
1/5k chance to drop pet rock, just to piss off collection log purists.
---
Didn't block out the d boots, say goodbye.
---
People were telling me on a post I made like a week ago to go through and appeal anyway even though it says it‚Äôs permanent and they just came back with the ‚Äúyup, looks like unusual activity during this time, it has been appealed‚Äù.  It sucks there‚Äôs no where to try and write something or plea your case other then Twitter/reddit
---
Ah yes poor record profit Jamflex is too busy making RS3 TH promo "content" to have a proper customer service department like every other MMO. Too bad you can't play that "content" when your account gets false banned
---
My account got banned in 2017 I tried for days on my other reddit account (I forgot log in for) got 3 threads to the top and the sub mods instantly deleted them, I know your struggles.
---
I do, but they arent all overlayed onto of one another and I'm not performing the exact same action.
---
By overlaying them all on top of one another, he is skipping mouse movement with at least 3 of the accounts which is infact cheating.
---
He has to move the mouse on top of the client for the first account and last account, but the three inbetween just instantly get the mouse pointer to where it needs to go.
---
Its cheating and thats why he was banned on only three of the accounts.
---
Technically the downvote is meant for low effort, irrelevant, inflammatory, or comments otherwise not conductive of a discussion. Reddit tries to be explicit in mentioning that it's not meant to be used as a disagree button because using it as such discourages discussion.
---
Downvote is not for disagreement. You‚Äôre supposed to downvote if ‚Äúit does not contribute to a discussion or is off topic‚Äù -reddit rules
---
You're a weirdo and you should admit that you were talking out of your ass.
---
But only because a jmod was watching the stream as it happened.
---
But it is solved aoready, i just was a little angry bcs my alt had a lock and my main did not... many accounts have been hacked and i do not wanna lose my 10b that i worked for over 4years to a stupid moron in less than 10minuts
---
Just did, can't really explain past that tbh
---
only advantage is that they are semi afk and good xp, thats it. not good for money/hr at all
---
he said "downvoted for posting before the end of the month"

This needs to be a fucking hairstyle in game LOOOL

"deep wilderness pk" video preview shows lv 9 wildy.

the varrock stray dog needs love too
---
Love it when random 15-24 year olds from the internet think they're better at running a multi million business than a team of experienced professionals.
---
Which is why am trying to go through Jagex for a refund so I shouldn't have to deal with that. If they say no, then it's oh well 30bucks down the drain
---
how isnt it bis if it has double acc and 25% xtra dmg?
---
Christmas time
---
Slayer usually gets better just by knowing how to do it and getting access to Duradel.
---
Most folks aren't setting up perfect ban lists and perfect cannon positioning when they're 65 slayer.  They usually don't have BiS gear either.
---
For me specifically, I'm already 72 slayer and likely won't get to use Duradel until I'm past 75 (due to being under 100cb).
---
vorkath confirmed for 200k gp loss/h

Love it when a worthless corporate bootlicker tries to say that it's ok for a company to shit on their paying customers because "THEY'RE NOT MAKING ENOUGH MONEY GUYS"

Looks like a dagannoth bone to me
---
Aah I see, in that case I've just always misunderstood that droptable.  
---
regadless of any of that I'm still happy with having gotten 3.
---
I see four grievous sins in this post
---
1: Reporting it to us instead of jagex
---
2: Posting that horrendous failed link
---
3: Taking a picture of your screen with your phone
---
4: The guy trolling you
---
This meme would be relevant if it passed. But it didnt so who cares?
---
No joke that‚Äôs a lot of money there. :P
---
How much gp is your bank worth
---
&gt;Oh, rune pouches have been unobtainable for almost a week now btw.
---
Didn't they add emblems back to wildy slayer until the BH update is out of Beta? Also slayer points.
---
Shows how flawed the system is. They say their system is 100% accurate and do not offer appeals, your statement proves otherwise.
---
This is some next level meme that requires a basic GCSE chemistry knowledge
---
Lmaoooo
---
Still means it was trash back then.
---
I'd say this is about average
---
&gt;You suddenly bitching about being banned while you could have done that 2 years ago how does that sound
---
It's almost like that's what the title of the post say....
---
According to the wiki the least valuable drop would be leather chaps. So I guess its possible to roll just chaps üòÇ talk about depressing.
---
If you have a supply of burst runes from barrows I would still go nieve/dura, if not then konar chests have some decent supplies i guess. Try like 10 tasks of both, see which one you like more.
---
Sick bait bro. Maybe if you had a fucking brain you would know that the ban he got cannot be appealed, and so if he wasn‚Äôt a streamer his account would be gone forever. Nobody is mad that they make mistakes, they are mad that they are confident in their mistakes and will not offer second chances.
---
Make the scam viable again
---
Either scale to 200% or deal with the tinyness.
---
You made this post because you suffer from adhd
---
I wish that armor wasn't piss easy to get, looks so cool would be worth a good amount as a clue reward or somethin.
---
Nope. If you care about graphics then osrs is definitely not the game for you.
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve ever claimed that... if so, please show me when they‚Äôve said it‚Äôs 100% effective.
---
This account is weird af
---
I do, actually. Stakeholders are people with a vested interest in the company and its policies. They aren't necessarily shareholders, but every shareholder is definitely a stakeholder because the success of the company means better returns on the initial investment.
---
The problem is Stakeholder in itself is very vague in the context and the stakeholder may not always have the best interest of us players. For instance, OSBuddy might have a recognized stake in OSRS's success and the statement on 3rd party clients may be going through both investors and OSBuddy employees.
---
You are many months late on this
---
I‚Äôm good with no content anyways, been had no new content for years as a pvp player. Time to get fucked slayer boy.
---
But you don't need to know anything about ticks or prayer flicking for a fire cape. You just have to have a reaction time faster than a dead sloth.
---
"tiny minority"
---
If a game is known to not care about its people it will die. If people get banned for no reason they will not want to play. The game is hard enough to get new people with everything being locked behind p2p and the rising cost of bonds/membership in general. If they have to fear being unjustly banned they just won't play at all.
---
don't believe you risk either, as the mechanics on pvp worlds are generally the same as in low wildy. Definitely do not take my word for this and check for yourself though
---
Nah. The mindset is that if you see someone wearing nothing you kill them because it's very little effort for a possible high reward. Most of the time yeah they don't have shit but every so often it's someone just trying to look like they don't have anything but actually have a full inventory.
---
Evscape gets promptly unbanned because a mod was in right place right time
---
Everybody : (ACB Spec)
---
Sadly no. I played this game back when it started in the early 2000s üòÖ
---
&gt;due to the common sense of killing you naked gets them nothing
---
And yet people kill people at the wildy course and black salamanders all the time
---
So, forgive me if I'm wrong, but I thought Jagex had a zero tolerance policy for AHK.
---
Can only scale to 175% and still doesn't look as good as it does at 100% there's no other option?
---
Wait runelite literally shows you how to do them? Meanwhile i have been doing it myself while on the bus on my way to university
---
What do you suggest they use instead of salad robes vs. the 20k risk black dhide setup that gives near-endgame offensive and defensive bonuses?
---
And why do you think people are justified in risking more than that?
---
Got him
---
Props for fighting misinformation, ‚Äúboot drop table‚Äù is one of the most common myths in RS.
---
I cried laughing thanks.
---
Dhcb imo. If you grind vork enough, its definitely worth it. I tried near max melee setup vs dhcb, but its definitely not as relaxing.
---
"Check health" on trees is analogous to harvesting for herbs/allotments etc. You can only do it at the end, once it's fully grown.
---
My maxed rs3 account was hacked and botted on at green dragons on osrs and it was permanently banned . I contacted mod weath on twitter and after jagexsupport told me I wouldn't be unbanned mod weath unbanned me. Crazy to think I had to go to twitter to get actual customer support
---
If you're using runelite it should take a picture of the pet drop.
---
Not everything has to be ehp. Incentivizing like that makes for a shit game
---
You can, rendi made a video recently for the lowest combat barrows gloves
---
To be fair, incredibly rare things happen on stream all the time. Statistically bound to happen eventually.
---
I‚Äôm OOTL but where are these bans? I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone who‚Äôs been banned for using RL. AFAIK RL has removed any plugins that were considered bannable offenses by Jagex. Using any 3pc‚Äôs that have bannable plugins as described in their post would be deserving. If the bans are for plugins unmentioned, then yeah rally the pitchforks. 
---
Also rune pouches are obtainable via Slayer and BH shop still. You just can‚Äôt insta-buy them from traded emblems anymore. Which I do think is bs. Hopefully they make them tradeable or more cost/time-effective now that the easy option is removed.
---
Well the game is nearly 20 years old I wouldn‚Äôt expect red dead redemption 2

Anyways, I'm not saying anything for or against vaping. I just don't know why anyone does it, same reason why I don't understand why people smoke. You don't get anything out of it. There's no high or buzz to it. Like, why do you vape? Genuine question.

‚ÄúYo mama so fat, I buried her bones and got 99 prayer‚Äù

OSRS is only 6 years old?

I think he's going for 100,000 of each color regardless of prices
---
please i have a family
---
Then you made the whole thing up to see if jagex would give you those items for free.
---
Oh thank god, i needed my chaos runes.
---
There's functionally no difference between considering it a separate table, and it's a set of items that are clustered together psychologically,  so it's not a particularly harmful myth
---
I like the idea but Konar already provides a bit more life to brimhaven dungeon. I've a bit of a radical suggestion that instead of all monsters in the dungeon dropping the key that only the metal dragons within the dungeon do as they are an unpopular slayer monster to kill but brimhaven dungeon is a great spot for them, I think a stone dragon boss would be a little bit cooler and more fitting to the dungeon than an earth titan and since the keys themselves would be rare the tablet could be an uncommon droo from the boss and there could also be room for it to have a much rarer drop in the form of a magic based dragonbane weapon.

---
The difference between a ban thats 100% confirmed and a system that is 100% effective is astronomical. The ban system is based on human effort and is therefore subject to human error, to which no one has ever claimed it to be 100% effective.
---
Crazy how this simple answer makes me feel like a negative IQ.
---
Of course. Makes sense why they have a one trade limit then.
---
People hate evscape, judging by this, account was disable mid stream, but fixed pretty quick after
---
I didn't take a screenshot because I was so angry in the moment I forgot. Is it that hard to envisage what I said? Showing usernames that are not yours is banned on this subreddit anyway.
---
You can also add a waterbirth teleport to your house and it cuts down on trips
---
Hi Sween, not OP but I think some current guilds could use some QoL:
---
**Cooking Guild**
---
Those with hard Varrok diary done have access to a bank near a range. This becomes obsolete however if players wish to have closer bank trips like Burthorpe fire or Myth‚Äôs Guild range, or reduced burn rates like the range in the Lumbridge kitchen. I think the guild for master chefs should offer one of the best places to cook. Maybe that range can get the same effect as the Cook-o-matic 100? I also think the guild could use a hidden Cooking boost to be consistent with other guilds and to offer less burn rates overall. 
---
**Mining Guild**
---
It‚Äôs too easy for bots to farm runite here. Perhaps the Falador diary can give access to a Mining Guild Adamant and Runite spot, similar to karamja Hard for gem rocks?
---
**Edgeville Monastery**
---
The unofficial Prayer Guild. If this were to become a Prayer Guild, perhaps the altar upstairs could get a similar affect to PoH/Chaos altars at a reduced rate? Maybe using bones on the altar gives 150% xp. This would offer f2p players a better way to train their Prayer, and members could use combat bracelets to make trips faster, although it would still be better for members to use a hosted PoH. There could also be a hidden Prayer bonus effect while in the vicinity of holy grounds. It would allow Prayers to last slightly longer for any players training on Monks before recharging at the altar.

Why would you be screwed out of 5mil? You can sell the trident anytime you want. Cost of using it every task would be your main concern.
---
I mean they did host a questionnaire about customer support and are probably slowly working on rolling out some stuff. Might not be soon, but a lot of people voice the same opinion. So they know they have to do something a out it. Can't be overnight though :( 
---
Unless they add it to the rc skill then maybe they won't have to worry because people wouldn't want to rc just to get customer support.

you might want to check out ''we do raids'' for your first couple of kcs
---
So if the ban is un-appealable... What steps does a regular bloke like myself need take to get the account back? Or is it a big shit out of luck type of deal?
---
This needs to be properly addressed. So many hours are spent on accounts only for a faulty bot detection system to permaban.
